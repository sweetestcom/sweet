    <p>The following is a conversation with Steve Vasile,</p>
<p>formerly a truck driver and now a sociologist</p>
<p>at the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>who studies freight transportation.</p>
<p>His first book, The Big Rig,</p>
<p>Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream,</p>
<p>explains how long haul trucking</p>
<p>went from being one of the best blue collar jobs</p>
<p>to one of the toughest.</p>
<p>His current ongoing book project,</p>
<p>Driverless, Autonomous Trucks</p>
<p>and the Future of the American Trucker,</p>
<p>explores self driving trucks</p>
<p>and their potential impacts on labor and on society.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Steve Vasile.</p>
<p>You wrote a book about trucking</p>
<p>called The Big Rig, Trucking and the Decline</p>
<p>of the American Dream,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re currently working on a book</p>
<p>about autonomous trucking called Driverless,</p>
<p>Autonomous Trucks and the Future of the American Trucker.</p>
<p>I have to bring up some Johnny Cash to you</p>
<p>because I was just listening to this song.</p>
<p>He has a ton of songs about trucking,</p>
<p>but one of them I was just listening to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called All I Do is Drive,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s talking to an old truck driver.</p>
<p>It goes, I asked them if those trucking songs</p>
<p>tell about a life like his.</p>
<p>He said, if you want to know the truth about it,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>All I do is drive, drive, drive,</p>
<p>try to stay alive, that&rsquo;s the chorus,</p>
<p>and keep my mind on my load,</p>
<p>keep my eye upon the road.</p>
<p>I got nothing in common with any man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s home every day at five.</p>
<p>All I do is drive, drive, drive,</p>
<p>drive, drive, drive, drive.</p>
<p>So I got to ask you,</p>
<p>same thing that he asked the trucker.</p>
<p>You worked as a trucker for six months</p>
<p>while working on the previous book.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to be a truck driver?</p>
<p>I think that captures it.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>Can you take me through the whole experience,</p>
<p>what it takes to become a trucker,</p>
<p>what actual day to day life was on day one,</p>
<p>week one, and then over time how that changed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the book is really about how that changed over time.</p>
<p>So my experience, and I&rsquo;m an ethnographer, right?</p>
<p>So I go in, I live with people,</p>
<p>I work with people, I talk to them,</p>
<p>try to understand their world.</p>
<p>Ethnographer, by the way, what is that?</p>
<p>The science and art of capturing the spirit of a people?</p>
<p>Yeah, life ways.</p>
<p>I think that would be a good way to capture it,</p>
<p>try to understand what makes them unique as a society,</p>
<p>maybe as a subculture, what kind of makes them tick,</p>
<p>that might be different than the way you and I are wired.</p>
<p>And really sort of thickly describe it</p>
<p>would be at least one component of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the basic essential.</p>
<p>And then for me, I want to exercise what C. Wright Mills</p>
<p>called the sociological imagination,</p>
<p>which is to put that individual biography</p>
<p>into the long historical sweep of humanity,</p>
<p>if at all possible.</p>
<p>My goals are typically more modest than C. Wright Mills&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And to then put that biography in the larger social structure</p>
<p>to try to understand that person&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and the way they see the world,</p>
<p>their decisions in light of their interests</p>
<p>relative to others and conflict and power</p>
<p>and all these things that I find interesting.</p>
<p>And conflict and power.</p>
<p>And interesting.</p>
<p>In the context of society and in the context of history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the small tangent, what does it take to do that,</p>
<p>to capture this particular group, the spirit, the music,</p>
<p>the full landscape of experiences</p>
<p>that a particular group goes through</p>
<p>in the context of everything else?</p>
<p>You only have a limited amount of time</p>
<p>and you come to the table probably with preconceived notions</p>
<p>that are then quickly destroyed, all that whole process.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s more art or science,</p>
<p>but what does it take to be great at this?</p>
<p>I do think my first book was a success</p>
<p>relative to my goals of trying to really get at the heart</p>
<p>of sort of the central issues</p>
<p>and the lives being led by people.</p>
<p>If I have a resource, a talent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m a good listener.</p>
<p>I can talk with anybody.</p>
<p>My wife loves to remark on this</p>
<p>that I can sort of sit down with anyone.</p>
<p>I think I learned that from my dad who worked at a factory</p>
<p>and actually had a lot of truckers go through</p>
<p>the gate that he operated.</p>
<p>And he always had a story, a joke for everybody,</p>
<p>kind of got to know everyone individually.</p>
<p>And he just taught me that essentially</p>
<p>everyone has something to teach you.</p>
<p>And I try to embody that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the rule is for me is every single person</p>
<p>I interact with can teach me something.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m clearly of the two of us, the poorer listener.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a great listener.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a great listener.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a large number of interviews,</p>
<p>like you said, of truckers for this book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious, what are some lessons you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about what it takes to listen to a person enough,</p>
<p>maybe guide the conversation enough</p>
<p>to get to the core of the person, the idea,</p>
<p>again, the ethnographer goal to get to the core?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it doesn&rsquo;t happen in the moment, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a ruminator.</p>
<p>I just sit with the data for years.</p>
<p>I sat with the trucking data for almost 10 full years</p>
<p>and just thought about the problems and the questions</p>
<p>using everything that I possibly could.</p>
<p>And so in the moment, my ideal interview is I open up</p>
<p>and I say, tell me about your life as a trucker.</p>
<p>And they never shut up.</p>
<p>And they keep telling me the things that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>Now, it never works out that way</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re interested in, right?</p>
<p>And so a lot of it is the, as you know,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a great interviewer, prep, right?</p>
<p>So you try to get to know a little bit about the person</p>
<p>and sort of understand kind of the central questions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in that they can help you explore.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve done hundreds of interviews with truck drivers</p>
<p>at this point and I should really go back</p>
<p>and read the original ones.</p>
<p>They were probably terrible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process like?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting down, do you have an audio recorder</p>
<p>and also taking notes or do you do no audio, just notes or?</p>
<p>Yeah, audio recorder and social scientists</p>
<p>always have to struggle with sampling, right?</p>
<p>Like who do you interview?</p>
<p>Where do you find them?</p>
<p>How do you recruit them?</p>
<p>I just happened to have a sort of natural place to go</p>
<p>that gave me essentially the population</p>
<p>that I was interested in.</p>
<p>So all these long haul truck drivers that I was interested in</p>
<p>they have to stop and get fuel</p>
<p>and get services at truck stops.</p>
<p>So I picked a truck stop at the juncture</p>
<p>of a couple of major interstates,</p>
<p>went into the lounge that drivers have to walk through</p>
<p>with my clipboard and everybody who came through,</p>
<p>I said, hey, are you on break?</p>
<p>And that was sort of the first criteria was,</p>
<p>do you have time, right?</p>
<p>And if they said, yes, I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m a graduate student at Indiana University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a study,</p>
<p>trying to understand more about truck drivers.</p>
<p>Will you sit down with me?</p>
<p>And I think the first,</p>
<p>I think I probably asked like 104 or 103 people</p>
<p>to get the first 100 interviews.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good odds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, right?</p>
<p>For any response rate like that for interviewing,</p>
<p>these are people who sat down and gave me an hour</p>
<p>or sometimes more of their time,</p>
<p>just randomly at a truck stop.</p>
<p>And it just tells you something about like,</p>
<p>truckers have something to say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re alone a lot.</p>
<p>And so I had to figure out how to kind of</p>
<p>turn the spigot on, you know?</p>
<p>And I got pretty good at it, I think, yeah.</p>
<p>So they have good stories to tell</p>
<p>and they have an active life in the mind</p>
<p>because they spend so much time on the road</p>
<p>just basically thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of reflection,</p>
<p>a lot of struggles, you know?</p>
<p>And they take different forms.</p>
<p>One of the things that they talk about</p>
<p>is the impact on their families.</p>
<p>They say truckers have the same rate of divorce</p>
<p>as everybody else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because trucking saves so many marriages</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not around and ruins so many.</p>
<p>And so it ends up being a wash.</p>
<p>So I had this experience.</p>
<p>I met another person and he recognized me from a podcast.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, I&rsquo;m a fan of yours</p>
<p>and a fan of Joe Rogan, but you guys never talk.</p>
<p>You always talk to people with Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>You always talk to these kinds of people.</p>
<p>You never talk to us regular folk.</p>
<p>And that guy really stuck with me.</p>
<p>First of all, the idea of regular folk is a silly notion.</p>
<p>I think people that win Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>are often more boring than the people, these regular folks</p>
<p>in terms of stories, in terms of richness of experience,</p>
<p>in terms of the ups and downs of life.</p>
<p>And, you know, that really stuck with me</p>
<p>because I set that as a goal for myself</p>
<p>to make sure I talked to regular folk.</p>
<p>And you did just this talking, again, regular folk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human beings.</p>
<p>All of them have experiences.</p>
<p>If you were to recommend to talk some of these folks</p>
<p>with stories, how would you find them?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do do this sometimes for journalists</p>
<p>who will come and they want to write about</p>
<p>sort of what&rsquo;s happening right now in trucking, you know.</p>
<p>And I send them to truck stops.</p>
<p>I say, you know, yeah, there&rsquo;s a town</p>
<p>called Effingham, Illinois.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just this place where, you know,</p>
<p>bunch of huge truck stops, tons of trucks</p>
<p>and really nothing else out there.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s in the middle of corn country.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, truckers in this, you know,</p>
<p>sadly, I think, you know, the politics of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s changing a little bit.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a little, the polarization is getting</p>
<p>to the trucking industry in ways that, you know,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re seeing in other parts of our social world.</p>
<p>But truckers are generally, you know,</p>
<p>real open sort of friendly folks.</p>
<p>Some of them ultimately like to work alone and be alone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a relatively small subset, I think.</p>
<p>But all of them are generally, you know,</p>
<p>kind of open, you know, trusting,</p>
<p>willing to have a conversation.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you go to the truck stop</p>
<p>and you go in the lounge and they&rsquo;re usually,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually a booth down there</p>
<p>and somebody is sitting at their laptop</p>
<p>or on their phone and willing to strike up a conversation.</p>
<p>You should try that.</p>
<p>You should, you know.</p>
<p>That 100% will try this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just again, we&rsquo;re just going from tangent to tangent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to the main question,</p>
<p>but what do they listen to?</p>
<p>Do they listen to talk radio?</p>
<p>Do they listen to podcasts, audio books?</p>
<p>Do they listen to music?</p>
<p>Do they listen to silence?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Some, I mean, and some still listen to the CB,</p>
<p>which, you know, it&rsquo;s a ever dwindling group.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll call it the Original Internet Citizens Band.</p>
<p>You know, back in the 70s,</p>
<p>they thought it was going to be the medium of democracy.</p>
<p>And they love to just get on there</p>
<p>and, you know, cruise along one truck after the other</p>
<p>and chat away.</p>
<p>Usually, you know, it&rsquo;s guys who know each other</p>
<p>from the same company or happen to run into each other.</p>
<p>But other than that, it&rsquo;s everything under the sun.</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s probably one of the stereotypes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, I think it was more true in the past, you know,</p>
<p>about the sort of heterogeneity of truck drivers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a really diverse group now.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s definitely a large,</p>
<p>still a large component of rural white guys</p>
<p>who work in the industry,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge growing chunk of the industry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s immigrants, people of color, and even some women.</p>
<p>Still huge barriers to women entering it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much more diverse place than most people think.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to your journey as a truck driver.</p>
<p>What did it take to become a truck driver?</p>
<p>What were the early days like?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is, I mean, this is a central part</p>
<p>of the story, right, that I uncovered.</p>
<p>And the good part was that I went in</p>
<p>without knowing what was gonna happen.</p>
<p>So I was able to experience it as a new truck driver would.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the important stories in the book</p>
<p>is how that experience is constructed by employers</p>
<p>to sort of, you know, help you think the way</p>
<p>that they would like you to think about the job</p>
<p>and about the industry and about the social relations of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s super intimidating.</p>
<p>I say in the book, you know, pretty handy guy,</p>
<p>you know, familiar with tools, machines,</p>
<p>like, you know, comfortable operating stuff,</p>
<p>like from time I was a kid.</p>
<p>The truck was just like a whole nother experience.</p>
<p>I mean, as I think most people think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this big, huge vehicle, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really long, it&rsquo;s 70 feet long,</p>
<p>it can weigh 80,000 pounds.</p>
<p>You know, it does not stop like a car.</p>
<p>It does not turn like a car.</p>
<p>But at least when I started, and this has changed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s part of the technology story of trucking,</p>
<p>the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t shift like a manual car.</p>
<p>The clutch isn&rsquo;t synchronized.</p>
<p>So you have to do what&rsquo;s called double clutch.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically the foundational skill</p>
<p>that a truck driver used to have to learn.</p>
<p>So you would, you know, accelerate, say you&rsquo;re in first gear,</p>
<p>you push in the clutch,</p>
<p>you pull the shifter out of first gear,</p>
<p>you let the clutch out,</p>
<p>and then you let the RPMs of the engine drop an exact amount.</p>
<p>Then you push the clutch back in</p>
<p>and you put it in second gear.</p>
<p>If your timing is off,</p>
<p>those gears aren&rsquo;t gonna go together.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in an intersection,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna get this horrible grinding sound</p>
<p>as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the,</p>
<p>you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is.</p>
<p>So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it.</p>
<p>And so at least for me and a lot of drivers</p>
<p>who are going to private company CDL schools,</p>
<p>what happens is it&rsquo;s kind of like a bootcamp.</p>
<p>They ship me three states away from home,</p>
<p>send you a bus ticket and say,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, we&rsquo;ll put you up for two weeks.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>You sit in a classroom,</p>
<p>you sort of learn the theory of shifting,</p>
<p>the theory of kind of how you fill out your log book,</p>
<p>rules of the road, you know, you do that maybe half the day.</p>
<p>And then the other half you&rsquo;re in this giant parking lot</p>
<p>with one of these old trucks and just like, you know,</p>
<p>destroying what&rsquo;s left of the thing, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s lurching and belching smoke</p>
<p>and just making horrible noises and like rattling.</p>
<p>I mean, in these things, like there&rsquo;s a lot of torque.</p>
<p>And so if you do manage to get it into gear,</p>
<p>but the engine&rsquo;s lugging,</p>
<p>I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s bull,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to ride and it&rsquo;s super intimidating.</p>
<p>And the thing about it is that for everybody there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost everybody there, it&rsquo;s super high stakes.</p>
<p>So trucking has become a job of last resort</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing,</p>
<p>they get too old to do construction any longer, right?</p>
<p>The knees can no longer handle it.</p>
<p>And they get replaced by a machine,</p>
<p>their job gets, you know, offshored</p>
<p>and they end up going to trucking because it&rsquo;s a place</p>
<p>where they can maintain their income.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s super high stress.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve left their family behind,</p>
<p>maybe they quit another job.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re typically being charged a lot of money.</p>
<p>So that first couple of weeks,</p>
<p>like you might get charged $8,000 by the company</p>
<p>that you have to pay back if you don&rsquo;t get hired.</p>
<p>And so the stakes are high and this machine is huge</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s super stressful.</p>
<p>I mean, I watched, you know, grown men break down crying</p>
<p>about like how they couldn&rsquo;t go home and tell their son</p>
<p>that they had been telling they were gonna, you know,</p>
<p>go become a long haul truck driver that they&rsquo;d failed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of this super high stress system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s designed that way partly</p>
<p>because as one of my trainers later told me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a two week job interview.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re testing you, they&rsquo;re seeing like, you know,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s this person gonna respond when it&rsquo;s tough, you know,</p>
<p>when they have to do the right thing and it&rsquo;s slow</p>
<p>and, you know, they need to learn something,</p>
<p>are they gonna rush, you know,</p>
<p>or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out,</p>
<p>you know, nose to the grindstone.</p>
<p>Cause when you&rsquo;re a new truck driver, you&rsquo;re unsupervised,</p>
<p>you know, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re really looking for</p>
<p>is that kind of quality of conscientious work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna carry through to the job.</p>
<p>Well, so the truck is such an imposing part</p>
<p>of a traffic scenario.</p>
<p>So you said like turning, it stresses me out every time</p>
<p>I look at a truck cause they, I mean,</p>
<p>the geometry of the problem is so tricky.</p>
<p>And so if you combine the fact that they have to,</p>
<p>like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene</p>
<p>are staring at the truck and they&rsquo;re waiting,</p>
<p>often in frustration.</p>
<p>And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly</p>
<p>and move perfectly.</p>
<p>And if, when you&rsquo;re new, especially,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ll probably, for somebody like me,</p>
<p>it feels like it would take years to become calm</p>
<p>and comfortable in that situation</p>
<p>as opposed to be exceptionally stressed under the eyes</p>
<p>of the road, everybody looking at you, waiting for you.</p>
<p>Is that the psychological pressure of that?</p>
<p>Is that something that was really difficult?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Again, just, I saw people freeze up, you know,</p>
<p>in that intersection as, you know, horns are blaring</p>
<p>and the truck&rsquo;s grinding, you know, gears</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t, you know, and they just shut down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, this isn&rsquo;t for me, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it takes years.</p>
<p>If, you know, trucking is not considered</p>
<p>a skilled occupation, but, you know, my six months there,</p>
<p>and I was a pretty good rookie, but when I finished,</p>
<p>I was still a rookie, even shifting, definitely backing,</p>
<p>tight corners and situations, you know,</p>
<p>I could drive competently, but the difference between me</p>
<p>and someone who had, you know, two, three years</p>
<p>of experience was, it was a giant gulf between us.</p>
<p>And between that and the really skilled drivers</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been doing it for 20 years, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still another step beyond that.</p>
<p>So it is highly skilled.</p>
<p>Would it be fair to break trucking into the task</p>
<p>of driving a truck into two categories?</p>
<p>One is like the local stuff, getting out of the parking lot,</p>
<p>getting into, you know, driving down local streets</p>
<p>and then highway driving, those two tasks.</p>
<p>What are the challenges associated with each task?</p>
<p>You kind of emphasized the first one.</p>
<p>What about the actual like long haul highway driving?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, and they are very different, right?</p>
<p>And the key with the long haul driving is really a set of,</p>
<p>the way I came to understand it was a set of habits, right?</p>
<p>We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think,</p>
<p>have a sense of driving as like being really skilled,</p>
<p>is like the goal and you can kind of maneuver yourself</p>
<p>out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed</p>
<p>and breaking and acceleration, you know.</p>
<p>For a really good truck driver,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about understanding traffic and traffic patterns</p>
<p>and making good decisions</p>
<p>so you never have to use those skills.</p>
<p>And the really good drivers, you know,</p>
<p>the mantra is always leave yourself an out, right?</p>
<p>So always have that safe place that you can put that truck</p>
<p>in case that four wheeler in front of you</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s texting loses control.</p>
<p>You know, what are you gonna do in that situation?</p>
<p>And what really good truck drivers do on the highway</p>
<p>is they just keep themselves</p>
<p>out of those situations entirely.</p>
<p>They see it, they slow down, you know, they avoid it.</p>
<p>And then the local driving is really something</p>
<p>that takes just practice and routine to learn.</p>
<p>You know, this quarter turn,</p>
<p>it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re backing it up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, all right, I&rsquo;m gonna do a quarter turn</p>
<p>of the wheel now to get the effect that I want</p>
<p>like five seconds from now</p>
<p>in where that tail of that trailer is gonna be.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just no,</p>
<p>I mean, some people have a natural talent for that,</p>
<p>you know, spatial visualization</p>
<p>and kind of calculating those angles and everything,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s really no escaping the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve gotta just do it over and over again</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re gonna learn how to do it well.</p>
<p>Do you mind sharing how much you were getting paid,</p>
<p>how much you were making as a truck driver</p>
<p>in your time as a truck driver?</p>
<p>Yeah, I started out at 25 cents a mile</p>
<p>and then I got bumped up to 26 cents a mile.</p>
<p>So we had a minimum pay,</p>
<p>which was sort of a new pay scheme</p>
<p>that the industry had started to introduce to, you know,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of unpaid work and time.</p>
<p>And so we had a minimum pay of $500 a week</p>
<p>that you would get</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t drive enough miles to exceed that.</p>
<p>You get paid in sort of,</p>
<p>so you get paid when you turn the bills in,</p>
<p>which is the paperwork that goes with the load.</p>
<p>So, you know, you have to get that back to your company</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s how they bill the customer.</p>
<p>And so you might get a bunch of those bills</p>
<p>that kind of bunch up in one week.</p>
<p>So, you know, I might get a paycheck for, you know, $1,200.</p>
<p>And I mean, I was a poor graduate student.</p>
<p>So this was real, real money to me.</p>
<p>And so I had this sort of natural incentive to,</p>
<p>you know, earn a lot or to maximize my pay.</p>
<p>Some weeks were that minimum, 500, very few.</p>
<p>And then some I&rsquo;d get 1200, 1300 bucks.</p>
<p>Pay has gone up, you know,</p>
<p>typical drivers now starting in the 30s, you know,</p>
<p>in the kind of job that I was in.</p>
<p>30 cents per mile, 30 to 35.</p>
<p>So can we try to reverse engineer that math,</p>
<p>how that maps to the actual hours?</p>
<p>So the hours connected to driving are so widely dispersed,</p>
<p>as you said, some of them don&rsquo;t count as actual work,</p>
<p>some of it does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting discussion</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll then continue</p>
<p>when we start talking about autonomous trucking.</p>
<p>But, you know, you&rsquo;re saying all these cents per mile</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>What, how does that map to like average hourly wage?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, and this is kind of the,</p>
<p>this is also an interesting technology story in the end.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the technology story that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So pay per mile was, you know,</p>
<p>invented by companies when you couldn&rsquo;t surveil drivers,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing, right?</p>
<p>And you wanted them to have some skin in the game.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d say, you know, here&rsquo;s the load,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going from, you know, for me,</p>
<p>I might start in, you know, the Northeast,</p>
<p>maybe in upstate New York with a load of beer,</p>
<p>and say, here&rsquo;s this load of beer,</p>
<p>bring it to this address in Michigan,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna pay you by the mile, right?</p>
<p>If I was being paid by the hour,</p>
<p>I might just pull over at the diner and have breakfast.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re paid by the mile,</p>
<p>but increasingly over time,</p>
<p>the typical driver is spending more and more time</p>
<p>doing non driving tasks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of reasons for that.</p>
<p>One of which is railroads captured a lot of freight</p>
<p>that goes long distances now.</p>
<p>Another one is traffic congestion.</p>
<p>And the other one is that drivers are pretty cheap.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re almost always the low people</p>
<p>on the totem pole in some segments.</p>
<p>And so their time is used really inefficiently.</p>
<p>So I might go to that brewery</p>
<p>to pick up that load of Bud Light.</p>
<p>And, you know, their dock staff may be busy</p>
<p>loading up five other trucks.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, you know, go over there and sit and wait,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll call you on the CB when the dock&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<p>So you wait there a couple hours, they bring you in,</p>
<p>you know, you never know what&rsquo;s happening in the truck.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re loading it with a forklift,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re throwing 14 pallets on there full of kegs.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&rsquo;ll take them hours, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sitting in that truck.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re essentially unpaid.</p>
<p>You know, then you pull out, you&rsquo;ve got control</p>
<p>over what you&rsquo;re gonna get paid</p>
<p>based on how you drive that load.</p>
<p>And then on the other end,</p>
<p>you got a similar situation of kind of waiting, so.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the way truck drivers are paid,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a low incentive for the optimization</p>
<p>of the supply chain to make them more efficient, right?</p>
<p>To utilize truck labor more efficiently.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a technology problem that,</p>
<p>one of several technology problems that could be addressed.</p>
<p>I mean, so what did, if we just linger on it,</p>
<p>what are we talking about in terms of dollars per hour?</p>
<p>Is it close to minimum wage?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, there&rsquo;s something you talk about,</p>
<p>there was a conception or a misconception</p>
<p>that truckers get paid a lot for their work.</p>
<p>Do they get paid a lot for their work?</p>
<p>Some do.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s part of the complexity.</p>
<p>So, you know, what interested me as an ethnographer</p>
<p>about this was, you know, I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in the kind of economic conceptions</p>
<p>that people have in their heads</p>
<p>and how they lead to certain decisions in labor markets.</p>
<p>You know, why some people become an entrepreneur</p>
<p>and other people become a wage laborer,</p>
<p>or, you know, why some people wanna be doctors</p>
<p>and other people wanna be truck drivers.</p>
<p>That conception, right, is getting shaped</p>
<p>in these labor markets is the argument of the book.</p>
<p>And the fact that drivers can hear,</p>
<p>or potential drivers can hear about these, you know,</p>
<p>workers who make $100,000 plus,</p>
<p>which happens regularly in the trucking industry.</p>
<p>There are many truck drivers who make more</p>
<p>than $100,000 a year, you know, is an attraction.</p>
<p>But the industry is highly segmented.</p>
<p>And so the entry level segment,</p>
<p>and we can probably get into this,</p>
<p>but, you know, the industry is dominated</p>
<p>by a few dozen really large companies</p>
<p>that are self insured and can train new drivers.</p>
<p>So if you want those good jobs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta have several years,</p>
<p>up until recently, now the labor market&rsquo;s becoming tighter,</p>
<p>but you had to have several years of accident free,</p>
<p>you know, perfectly clean record driving</p>
<p>to get into them.</p>
<p>The other part of the segment, you know,</p>
<p>those drivers often don&rsquo;t make minimum wage.</p>
<p>But this leads to one of the sort of central issues</p>
<p>that has been in the courts,</p>
<p>and in the legislature, in some states,</p>
<p>is, you know, what should truck drivers get paid for?</p>
<p>Right, the industry, you know,</p>
<p>for the last 30 years or so has said, essentially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hours that they log for safety reasons</p>
<p>for the Department of Transportation, right?</p>
<p>Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile,</p>
<p>they try to minimize those,</p>
<p>because those hours are limited by the federal government.</p>
<p>So the federal government says,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t drive more than 60 hours in a week</p>
<p>as a long haul truck driver.</p>
<p>And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can</p>
<p>in those 60 hours, and so you under report them, right?</p>
<p>And so what happens is the companies say,</p>
<p>well, that guy, you know, he only said he logged 45 hours</p>
<p>of work that week, or 50 hours of work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we have to pay him minimum wage for.</p>
<p>When in fact, typical truck driver in these jobs will work,</p>
<p>according to most people, would sort of define it as like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m at the customer location, I&rsquo;m waiting to load,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some paperwork, you know,</p>
<p>inspecting the truck, I&rsquo;m fueling it,</p>
<p>just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock,</p>
<p>80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week</p>
<p>for one of these drivers.</p>
<p>And just when you look at that,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make minimum wage oftentimes.</p>
<p>Right, just to be clear, what we&rsquo;re dancing around here</p>
<p>is that a little bit over, a little bit under minimum wage</p>
<p>is nevertheless most truck drivers seem to be making</p>
<p>close to minimum wage.</p>
<p>Like this is the, so like we maybe haven&rsquo;t made that clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few that make quite a bit of money,</p>
<p>but like you&rsquo;re as an entry and for years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re operating essentially minimum wage</p>
<p>and potentially far less than minimum wage</p>
<p>if you actually count the number of hours</p>
<p>that are taken out of your life</p>
<p>due to your dedication to trucking.</p>
<p>Well, if you count like the hours taken out of your life,</p>
<p>then you gotta go, you know, maybe a full 24.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah, from family,</p>
<p>from the high quality of life parts of your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a whole nother set of rules</p>
<p>that the Department of Labor has,</p>
<p>which basically say that a truck driver</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s dispatched away from home for more than a day</p>
<p>should get minimum wage 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>And that could be a state minimum wage,</p>
<p>but typically what it would work out to for most drivers</p>
<p>is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver</p>
<p>should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000</p>
<p>should be the minimum wage of a truck driver.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve probably heard about the truck driver shortage.</p>
<p>If, you know, which I hope we can talk about,</p>
<p>if the minimum wage for truck drivers</p>
<p>is as it should be on the books at, you know,</p>
<p>around $60,000, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a shortage of truck drivers.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And to me, 60,000 is not a lot of money</p>
<p>for this kind of job.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re, this isn&rsquo;t, this is essentially two jobs</p>
<p>and two jobs where you don&rsquo;t get to sleep</p>
<p>with your wife or see your kids at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 60,000 is a very little money for that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying if it was 60,000,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t even have the shortage.</p>
<p>If that was the minimum.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>now we have drivers who start in the 30s.</p>
<p>Wow, but yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, so we&rsquo;re talking two, three jobs really,</p>
<p>when you look at the total hours</p>
<p>that people are working at, you know,</p>
<p>they can work over a hundred.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re a trainer, you know,</p>
<p>training other truck drivers,</p>
<p>well over a hundred hours a week.</p>
<p>So a job of last resort.</p>
<p>Maybe you can jump around from tangent to tangent.</p>
<p>This is such a fascinating and difficult topic.</p>
<p>I heard that there&rsquo;s a shortage of truck drivers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more jobs than truck drivers</p>
<p>willing to take on the job.</p>
<p>Is that the state of affairs currently?</p>
<p>I mean, I think the way that you just put that is right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a shortage of people</p>
<p>who are currently licensed to do the jobs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m working on a project for the state of California</p>
<p>to look at the shortage of agricultural drivers.</p>
<p>And the first thing that the DMV commissioner of the state</p>
<p>wanted to look at was, you know,</p>
<p>is there actually a shortage of licensed drivers?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve got a database here</p>
<p>of all the people who have a commercial driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>who could potentially have the credential to do this.</p>
<p>There are about 145,000 jobs in California</p>
<p>that require a class A CDL,</p>
<p>which would be that commercial driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>that you need for the big trucks.</p>
<p>About 145,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The industry in their, you know,</p>
<p>regular promotion of the idea that there&rsquo;s a shortage</p>
<p>is always projecting forward and says,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re gonna need 165,000 or so</p>
<p>in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re currently like 435,000 people licensed</p>
<p>in the state of California to drive one of these big trucks.</p>
<p>So it is not at all an absence of people who,</p>
<p>I mean, and again, going back</p>
<p>to what we were talking about before,</p>
<p>getting that license is not something</p>
<p>that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test.</p>
<p>Like this is somebody who probably quit another job,</p>
<p>was unemployed, and took months to go to a training school,</p>
<p>paid for that training school oftentimes,</p>
<p>left their family for months,</p>
<p>invested in what they thought was gonna be</p>
<p>a long term career, and then said,</p>
<p>you know what, forget it, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So yeah, so it&rsquo;s not just skill,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they were psychologically invested</p>
<p>potentially for months, if not years,</p>
<p>into this kinds of position as perhaps a position</p>
<p>that if they lose their current job, they could fall too.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s an indication</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something deeply wrong with the job,</p>
<p>if so many licensed people are not willing to take it.</p>
<p>What are the biggest problems</p>
<p>of the job of truck driver currently?</p>
<p>Yeah, the job, the problems with the job</p>
<p>and the labor market, right?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start with the job, which is, you know, again,</p>
<p>just so much time that&rsquo;s not compensated directly</p>
<p>for the amount of time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just psychologically,</p>
<p>and this was a big part of what I studied</p>
<p>for the first book was, you know,</p>
<p>that conception of like, what&rsquo;s my time worth, right?</p>
<p>And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes,</p>
<p>is that tangible outcome based compensation.</p>
<p>So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work,</p>
<p>I work hard, I get paid for what I do,</p>
<p>I drive 500 miles today,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna get paid for.</p>
<p>And then you get to that dock,</p>
<p>and they tell you, sorry, the load&rsquo;s not ready,</p>
<p>go sit over there, and you stew.</p>
<p>And that weight can break you psychologically</p>
<p>because your time every second becomes more worthless.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or worth less.</p>
<p>Yeah, and again, the industry is gonna say, for instance,</p>
<p>okay, well, you know, they&rsquo;ve got skin in the game, right?</p>
<p>That argument about sort of compensation</p>
<p>based on sort of output, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a holdover from when you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>observe truckers.</p>
<p>Now they all have, you know, satellite linked computers</p>
<p>in the trucks that tell these large companies,</p>
<p>this driver was, you know, at this GPS location</p>
<p>for four and a half hours, right?</p>
<p>So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly,</p>
<p>and the trucker can&rsquo;t control what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>on that customer location, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re waiting for that, you know, firm,</p>
<p>that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there.</p>
<p>And so what it becomes is just a way to shift</p>
<p>the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s competitive for customers.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re Walmart, you might have your choice</p>
<p>of a dozen different trucking companies</p>
<p>that could move your stuff.</p>
<p>And if one of them tells you, hey, you&rsquo;re not moving</p>
<p>our trucks in and out of your docks fast enough,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna charge you for how long our truck</p>
<p>is sitting on your lot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Walmart, you&rsquo;re gonna say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go see what the other guy says, right?</p>
<p>And so companies are gonna allow that customer</p>
<p>to essentially waste that driver&rsquo;s time, you know,</p>
<p>in order to keep that business.</p>
<p>Can you try to describe the economics,</p>
<p>the labor market of the situation?</p>
<p>You mentioned freight and railroad.</p>
<p>What is the sort of the dynamic financials,</p>
<p>the economics of this that allow for such low salaries</p>
<p>to be paid to truckers?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the competition?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the alternative to transporting goods via trucks?</p>
<p>Like what seems to be broken here</p>
<p>from an economics perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s, well, nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfect market, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so for economists, this is how it should work, right?</p>
<p>But the inefficiencies, like you said,</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt, are pushed to the truck driver.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that like spiral, doesn&rsquo;t that lead to</p>
<p>a poor performance on the part of the truck driver</p>
<p>and just like make the whole thing more and more inefficient</p>
<p>and it results in lower payment</p>
<p>to the truck driver and so on.</p>
<p>It just feels like in capitalism,</p>
<p>you should have a competing solution</p>
<p>in terms of truck drivers.</p>
<p>Like another company that provides transportation via trucks</p>
<p>that creates a much better experience for truck drivers,</p>
<p>making them more efficient, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>How is the competition being suppressed here?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it is, the competition is based on who&rsquo;s cheaper.</p>
<p>And this is the cheapest way to move the freight.</p>
<p>Now, there are externalities, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so this is the explanation</p>
<p>that I think is obvious for this, right?</p>
<p>There are lots of costs that,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s that driver&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the time without their family,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the fact that they drive through congestion</p>
<p>and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities</p>
<p>where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer</p>
<p>rather than more efficiently use their time</p>
<p>by sort of routing them around congestion</p>
<p>and rush hour and things like that.</p>
<p>This is the cheapest way to move freight.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the most competitive.</p>
<p>A big part of this is public subsidy of training.</p>
<p>So when those workers are not paying for the training,</p>
<p>you and I often are.</p>
<p>So if you lose your job because of foreign trade</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a veteran using your GI benefits,</p>
<p>you may very well be offered training,</p>
<p>publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver.</p>
<p>And so all of these are externalities</p>
<p>that the companies don&rsquo;t have to pay for.</p>
<p>And so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight.</p>
<p>So trucks is way cheaper than trains?</p>
<p>Well, over the long,</p>
<p>so one of the big stories for these companies</p>
<p>is that the average length of haul,</p>
<p>which becomes very important for self driving trucks,</p>
<p>the average length of haul has been steadily declining.</p>
<p>Over the last 15 years or so,</p>
<p>and this is industry collected data</p>
<p>from sort of the big firms that report it,</p>
<p>but roughly been cut in half from typically</p>
<p>about a thousand miles to under 500.</p>
<p>And under 500 is what a driver can move in a day, right?</p>
<p>So you can get loaded, drive and unload,</p>
<p>around 400 miles or something like that.</p>
<p>I wanna steal a good question from the Penn Gazette</p>
<p>interview you did, which people should read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great interview.</p>
<p>Was there a golden age for long haul truckers in America?</p>
<p>And if so, this is just a journalistic question.</p>
<p>And if so, what enabled it and what brought it to an end?</p>
<p>Wow, I might have to have you read my answer to that.</p>
<p>That was a few years ago,</p>
<p>be interesting to compare what I&rsquo;ll say, but.</p>
<p>I mean, one bigger question to ask, I guess,</p>
<p>is like Johnny Cash wrote a lot of songs about truckers.</p>
<p>There used to be a time when perhaps falsely,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s part of the kind of perception</p>
<p>that you study with the labor markets and so on.</p>
<p>There was a perception of truckers being,</p>
<p>first of all, a lucrative job</p>
<p>and second of all, a job to be desired.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, this is,</p>
<p>the trucking industry to me is fascinating,</p>
<p>but I think it should be fascinating to a lot of people.</p>
<p>So the golden age was really two different kinds</p>
<p>of markets as well, right?</p>
<p>Today we have really good jobs and some really bad jobs.</p>
<p>We had the Teamsters Union</p>
<p>that controlled the vast majority of employee jobs.</p>
<p>And even where they had something called</p>
<p>the National Master Freight Agreement.</p>
<p>And this was Jimmy Hoffa who led the union</p>
<p>through its sort of critical period by the mid 60s</p>
<p>had unified essentially the entire nation&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trucking labor force under one contract.</p>
<p>Now you were either covered by that contract</p>
<p>or your employer paid a lot of attention to it.</p>
<p>And so by the end of the 1970s,</p>
<p>the typical truck driver was making</p>
<p>well more than $100,000,</p>
<p>typical truck driver was making more than $100,000</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s dollars and was home every night.</p>
<p>That was without a doubt and even more</p>
<p>than unionized auto workers, steel workers,</p>
<p>10, 20% more than those workers made.</p>
<p>That was the golden age for sort of job quality,</p>
<p>wages, teamster power.</p>
<p>They were without a doubt the most powerful union</p>
<p>in the United States at that time.</p>
<p>At the same time in the 1970s,</p>
<p>you had the mythic long haul trucker.</p>
<p>And these were the guys who were kind of on the margins</p>
<p>of the regulated market,</p>
<p>which is what the teamsters controlled.</p>
<p>A lot of them were in agriculture,</p>
<p>which was never regulated.</p>
<p>So in the new deal, when they decided to regulate trucking,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t regulate agriculture</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t wanna drive up food prices,</p>
<p>which would hurt workers in urban areas.</p>
<p>So they essentially left agricultural truckers out of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where a lot of the kind of outlaw,</p>
<p>you know, asphalt cowboy imagery that we get.</p>
<p>And I grew up, I know you didn&rsquo;t grow up in the US</p>
<p>at this sort of, you know, as a young child.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a bit older than you, but in the late 70s,</p>
<p>there were movies and TV shows and CBs were a craze.</p>
<p>And it was all these kind of outlaw truckers</p>
<p>who were out there hauling some unregulated freight.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t supposed to be trying to avoid the bears,</p>
<p>you know, who are the cops.</p>
<p>And, you know, with all this salty language</p>
<p>and these like, you know, terms that only they understood</p>
<p>and, you know, the partying at diners and popping pills,</p>
<p>you know, the California turnarounds.</p>
<p>So asphalt cowboys, truly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like another form of cowboy movies.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think that sort of masculine ethos of like,</p>
<p>you got 40,000 pounds of something you care about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your guy, you know,</p>
<p>you needed to go from New York to California,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it, I got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s appealing and it&rsquo;s tangible, right?</p>
<p>And you think about people who don&rsquo;t wanna be paper pusher</p>
<p>and sit in the, I deal with office politics,</p>
<p>like just give me what you care about</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take care of it, you know, just pay me fair,</p>
<p>you know, and that appeals.</p>
<p>You mentioned unions, Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa.</p>
<p>Big question, maybe difficult question.</p>
<p>What are some pros and cons of unions historically</p>
<p>and today in the trucking space?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if you&rsquo;re a worker, there are a lot of pros.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>and this was one of the things I talked to truckers about</p>
<p>a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s their perception of Jimmy Hoffa,</p>
<p>for example, of unions?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and this was probably one of the central</p>
<p>hypotheses that I had going in there.</p>
<p>And it may sound, you know,</p>
<p>someone who does hard science, right?</p>
<p>You may hear a social scientist, you know,</p>
<p>sort of use that terminology,</p>
<p>even other social scientists.</p>
<p>Hypothesis?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, they don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>but I do like to think that way.</p>
<p>And my initial hypothesis was that, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very simple,</p>
<p>that, you know, the tenure of the driver in the industry</p>
<p>would have a strong effect on how they viewed unions.</p>
<p>That, you know, somebody who had experienced unions</p>
<p>would be more favorable</p>
<p>and someone who had not would not be, right?</p>
<p>And that turned out to be the case without a doubt.</p>
<p>But in an interesting way,</p>
<p>which was that even the drivers</p>
<p>who were not part of the union,</p>
<p>who in the kind of public debate of deregulation</p>
<p>were portrayed as these kind of small business truckers</p>
<p>who were getting shut out by the big regulated monopolies</p>
<p>and the Teamsters Union, you know,</p>
<p>the corrupt Teamsters Union.</p>
<p>Even those drivers longed for the days of the Teamsters</p>
<p>because they recognized the overall market impact</p>
<p>that they had.</p>
<p>That trucking just naturally</p>
<p>tended toward excessive competition</p>
<p>that meant that there was no profit to be made</p>
<p>and oftentimes you&rsquo;d be operating at a loss.</p>
<p>And so even these, you know,</p>
<p>the asphalt cowboy owner operators from back in the day</p>
<p>would tell me when the Teamsters were in power,</p>
<p>I made a lot more money.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is, you know, unions,</p>
<p>at least those kinds of unions, like the Teamsters,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s, I think a lot of misconceptions today</p>
<p>sort of popularly about what unions did back then.</p>
<p>They tied wages to productivity.</p>
<p>Like that was the central thing that the Teamsters Union did.</p>
<p>And, you know, there were great accounts</p>
<p>of sort of Jimmy Hoffa&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt</p>
<p>and criminal, and there&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m not disputing that.</p>
<p>He broke a lot of laws.</p>
<p>He was remarkably open about who he was and what he did.</p>
<p>He actually invited a pair, a husband and wife team</p>
<p>of Harvard economists to follow him around</p>
<p>and like opened up the Teamsters books to them</p>
<p>so that they could see how he was, you know,</p>
<p>thinking about negotiating with the employers.</p>
<p>And the Teamsters, and this goes back to the beginning,</p>
<p>and this goes back well before Hoffa,</p>
<p>back to the, you know, 1800s,</p>
<p>they understood that workers did better</p>
<p>if their employers did better.</p>
<p>And the only way the employers would do better</p>
<p>was if they controlled the market.</p>
<p>And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking</p>
<p>was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition</p>
<p>and they knew they couldn&rsquo;t limit competition</p>
<p>without the support of labor.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d get these collusive arrangements</p>
<p>between employers and labor to say no new trucking companies.</p>
<p>There are 10 of us, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>We control Seattle, we&rsquo;re gonna set the price</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not gonna be undercut.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a shortage of trucks around, it&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>rates go up, but you get too many trucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very often that you end up operating at a loss</p>
<p>just to keep the doors open.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have any choice.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s what economists called derived demand.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t like make up a bunch of trucking services</p>
<p>and store it in a warehouse, right?</p>
<p>You gotta keep those trucks moving to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Can we also lay out the kind of jobs that are in trucking?</p>
<p>What are the best jobs in trucking?</p>
<p>What are the worst jobs in trucking?</p>
<p>What are we, how many jobs are we talking about today?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what kind of jobs are there?</p>
<p>So there are a number of different segments</p>
<p>and the first part would be, you know, are you offering,</p>
<p>the first question would be,</p>
<p>are you offering services to the public</p>
<p>or are you moving your own freight, right?</p>
<p>So are you a retailer, say Walmart or, you know,</p>
<p>a paper company or something like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s operating your own fleet of trucks?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s private trucking.</p>
<p>For hire are the folks who, you know,</p>
<p>offer their services out to other customers.</p>
<p>So you have private and for hire.</p>
<p>In general, for hire pays less.</p>
<p>Is that because of the, something you talk about</p>
<p>with employee versus contractor situation</p>
<p>or are they all tricked or led to become contractors?</p>
<p>That can become a part of it as a strategy,</p>
<p>but the fundamental reason is competition.</p>
<p>So those private carriers aren&rsquo;t in competition</p>
<p>with other trucking fleets, right?</p>
<p>For their own in house services.</p>
<p>So, you know, they tend to, and this, you know,</p>
<p>the question of why private versus for hire</p>
<p>because for hire is cheaper, right?</p>
<p>And so if you need that, if that trucking service</p>
<p>is central to what you do and you cannot afford disruptions</p>
<p>or volatility in the price of it, you keep it in house.</p>
<p>You should be willing to pay more for that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more valuable too</p>
<p>and you keep it in house and that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting distinction.</p>
<p>What about, and this is kind of moving towards</p>
<p>our conversation of what can and can&rsquo;t be automated.</p>
<p>How else does it divide the different trucking jobs?</p>
<p>So the next big chunk is kind of</p>
<p>how much stuff are you moving, right?</p>
<p>And so we have what&rsquo;s called truckload</p>
<p>and truckload means, you know, you can fill up a trailer</p>
<p>either by volume or by weight and then less than truckload.</p>
<p>Less than truckload, the official definition</p>
<p>is like less than 10,000 pounds.</p>
<p>You know, this is gonna be a couple of pallets of this,</p>
<p>a couple of pallets of that.</p>
<p>The process looks really different, right?</p>
<p>So that truckload is, you know, point A to point B,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying, you know, a truckload of bounty paper towels,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bringing it into, you know, my distribution center,</p>
<p>go pick it up at the bounty plant,</p>
<p>bring it to my distribution center, right?</p>
<p>Nowhere in between do you stop.</p>
<p>At least process that freight.</p>
<p>Less than truckload, what you&rsquo;ve got is terminal systems.</p>
<p>And this is what you had under regulation too.</p>
<p>And so these terminal systems, what you do is you do</p>
<p>a bunch of local pickup and delivery,</p>
<p>maybe with smaller trucks,</p>
<p>and you pick up two pallets of this here,</p>
<p>four pallets of this there, you bring it to the terminal,</p>
<p>you combine it based on the destination,</p>
<p>you then create a full truckload, you know, trailer,</p>
<p>and you send it to another terminal</p>
<p>where it gets broken back down,</p>
<p>and then out for local delivery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna look a lot like if you send a package by UPS,</p>
<p>right, they pick all these parcels, right,</p>
<p>figure out where they&rsquo;re all going,</p>
<p>put them on planes or in trailers</p>
<p>going to the same destination,</p>
<p>then break them out to put them</p>
<p>in what they call package cars.</p>
<p>So, before I ask you about autonomous trucks,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just pause for your experience as a trucker.</p>
<p>Did it get lonely?</p>
<p>Like, can you talk about some of your experiences</p>
<p>of what it was actually like?</p>
<p>Did it get lonely?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, it was, I didn&rsquo;t have kids at the time.</p>
<p>Now I have kids, I can&rsquo;t even imagine it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been married for five years at the time.</p>
<p>My wife hated it, I hated it.</p>
<p>You know, I describe in the book</p>
<p>the experience of being stuck,</p>
<p>if I remember correctly, it was like Ohio</p>
<p>at this truck stop in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>and like, you know, sitting on this concrete barrier</p>
<p>and just watching fireworks in the distance</p>
<p>and like eating Chinese food on the 4th of July.</p>
<p>And you know, my wife calls me from like the family barbecue</p>
<p>and our anniversary is July 8th.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, are you gonna be home?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, you know.</p>
<p>I have a cousin whose husband drove truck</p>
<p>as a truck driver would say, drove truck for a while.</p>
<p>And he told me before I went into it,</p>
<p>he was like, the advantage you have is that you know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not gonna be doing this long term.</p>
<p>Like, and Lex, I can&rsquo;t even like,</p>
<p>the emotional content of some of these interviews,</p>
<p>I mean, I would sit down at a truck stop with somebody</p>
<p>I had never met before and you know, you open the spicket</p>
<p>and the last question I would ask drivers</p>
<p>was that by the time I really sort of figured out</p>
<p>how to do it, the last question I would ask them is,</p>
<p>you know, what advice would you give to somebody,</p>
<p>like your nephew, you know, a family friend asks you</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s like to be a driver and should they do it?</p>
<p>What advice would you give them?</p>
<p>And this question, some of these, you know,</p>
<p>grizzled old drivers, you know, tough, tough guys,</p>
<p>would that question would like, some of them would break down</p>
<p>and they would say, I would say to them,</p>
<p>you better have everything</p>
<p>that you ever wanted in life already.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve had a car that I&rsquo;ve had for 10 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got 7,000 miles on it.</p>
<p>I own a boat that hasn&rsquo;t seen the water in five years.</p>
<p>My kids, I didn&rsquo;t raise them.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d be out for two weeks at a time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d come home, my wife would give me two kids to punish,</p>
<p>a list of things to do, you know, on Saturday night</p>
<p>and I might leave out Sunday night or Monday morning.</p>
<p>You know, I come home dead tired,</p>
<p>my kids don&rsquo;t know who I am.</p>
<p>And you know, it was just like,</p>
<p>it was heartbreaking to hear those stories.</p>
<p>And then before you know it, you know,</p>
<p>life is short and just the years run away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hard question to ask in that context,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the best,</p>
<p>what was the best part of being a truck driver?</p>
<p>Was there moments that you truly enjoyed on the road?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>There was, there&rsquo;s definitely a pride and mastery of,</p>
<p>you know, even basic competence</p>
<p>of sort of piloting this thing safely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of responsibility to it.</p>
<p>That thing&rsquo;s dangerous and you know it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pride there.</p>
<p>For me personally, and I know for a lot of other drivers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like seeing these behind the scenes places</p>
<p>that you know exist in our economy.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re all much more aware of them now</p>
<p>after COVID and supply chain mess that we have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll talk about that,</p>
<p>but you know, you get to see those places.</p>
<p>You know, you get to see those ports.</p>
<p>You get to see the place where they make the cardboard boxes</p>
<p>that the Huggies diapers go in.</p>
<p>Or the warehouse full of Bud Light.</p>
<p>I moved Bud Light from like upstate New York</p>
<p>and the first load like went to Atlanta, you know?</p>
<p>And then a couple months later,</p>
<p>I circled back through that same brewery</p>
<p>and I brought a load of Bud Light out to Michigan.</p>
<p>And I was like, holy shit, all the Bud Light,</p>
<p>like, you know, for this whole giant swath</p>
<p>of the United States comes from this one plant,</p>
<p>this cavernous plant with like kegs of beer.</p>
<p>And you see that part of the economy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re almost like you&rsquo;re an economic tourist.</p>
<p>And I think all, everybody kind of appreciates that.</p>
<p>Like kind of, it&rsquo;s almost like a behind the scenes tour.</p>
<p>That wears off after a few months, you know?</p>
<p>You start to see new things less and less frequently.</p>
<p>At first, everything&rsquo;s novel and sort of life on the road.</p>
<p>And then it becomes just endless miles of white lines</p>
<p>and yellow lines and truck stops.</p>
<p>And the days just blur together.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one loading dock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one loading dock after another.</p>
<p>So you lose the magic of being on the road.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very rare the driver that doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You mentioned COVID and supply chain.</p>
<p>While being this, for a brief time,</p>
<p>this member of the supply chain,</p>
<p>what have you come to understand about our supply chain,</p>
<p>United States and global and its resilience</p>
<p>against strategies, catastrophic in the world?</p>
<p>Like COVID, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we have built really long,</p>
<p>really lean supply chains.</p>
<p>And just by definition, they&rsquo;re fragile.</p>
<p>You know, the current mess that we have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna clear by Christmas.</p>
<p>It will be lucky if it clears by next Christmas.</p>
<p>Can you describe the current mess in supply chain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;ve got pile ups of ships</p>
<p>off the coast of California, Long Beach,</p>
<p>and LA in particular, in bad shape.</p>
<p>You know, last I checked, it was around 60 ships,</p>
<p>all of which are holding thousands of containers</p>
<p>full of stuff that retailers were hoping</p>
<p>was gonna be on shelves for the holiday season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the port itself has stacks and stacks</p>
<p>of containers that they can&rsquo;t get rid of.</p>
<p>The truckers aren&rsquo;t showing up to pick up</p>
<p>the containers that are there,</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t offload the ships that are waiting.</p>
<p>And why aren&rsquo;t the truckers picking it up?</p>
<p>Partly because there&rsquo;s a long history of inefficiency</p>
<p>in making them wait,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because the warehouses are full.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had all these perverse outcomes</p>
<p>that no one really expected.</p>
<p>Like in the middle of all these shortages,</p>
<p>people are stockpiling stuff.</p>
<p>So there are suppliers who used to keep two months</p>
<p>of supply of bottled water on hand.</p>
<p>And after going through COVID and not having supply</p>
<p>to send to their customers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, we need three months.</p>
<p>Well, our system is not designed for major storage of goods</p>
<p>to go up 50% in a category.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lean.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a warehouse operator,</p>
<p>you know, you wanna be 90% plus.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a lot of open bays sitting around.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have 10% extra capacity in warehouses.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have 10% of them.</p>
<p>Trucking capacity can fluctuate a bit,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have that kind of slack.</p>
<p>And now, I mean, and we saw this</p>
<p>right when people shifted consumption.</p>
<p>And I get a little mad when people talk about panic buying</p>
<p>as kind of the reason that we had all these shortages.</p>
<p>It really, like it&rsquo;s preventing us from understanding,</p>
<p>you know, the real problem there,</p>
<p>which is that lean supply chain.</p>
<p>Sure, there was some panic buying, you know,</p>
<p>no doubt about it,</p>
<p>but we had an enormous shift in people&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>So with my sister and brother in law,</p>
<p>I own a couple of small businesses and we serve food, right?</p>
<p>So we get, you know, food from Cisco.</p>
<p>Cisco couldn&rsquo;t get rid of food, right?</p>
<p>Because nobody&rsquo;s eating out.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got, you know, 50 pounds sacks of flour,</p>
<p>you know, sitting in their warehouse</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t get rid of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got cases of lettuce and meat and everything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just gonna go bad.</p>
<p>So that panic buying certainly exacerbated some things</p>
<p>like toilet paper and whatever,</p>
<p>but we saw just a massive change in demand.</p>
<p>And our supply chains are based on historical data, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, that stuff leaves Asia,</p>
<p>you know, months before you wanna have it on the shelves</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re predicting based on last year, you know,</p>
<p>what you want on that shelf.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a, you know, I guess at its best,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful symphony of lots of moving parts,</p>
<p>but now everyone can&rsquo;t get on the same page of music.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not resilient to changes</p>
<p>in on mass human behavior.</p>
<p>So even like I read somewhere,</p>
<p>maybe you can tell me if it&rsquo;s true in relation to food,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the change of human behavior</p>
<p>between going out to restaurants versus eating at home.</p>
<p>As a species, we consume a lot less food that way.</p>
<p>Apparently what I read in restaurants,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of food just thrown out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the business model.</p>
<p>And so like you then have to move a lot more food</p>
<p>through the whole supply chain.</p>
<p>And now because you&rsquo;re consuming, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s leftovers at home,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming much more of the food you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating at home,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating these bottleneck situations,</p>
<p>problems as you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>too much in a certain place, not enough in another place.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the supply chain is not robust</p>
<p>those kinds of dynamic shifts in who gets what where.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so, and I have worked in agriculture a bit</p>
<p>on sort of the supply side, you know,</p>
<p>and there are product categories, right?</p>
<p>Where 30% of the crop raised does not get used, right?</p>
<p>Just gets plowed under or wasted.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the importance of this</p>
<p>in sort of getting this right, you know, like that,</p>
<p>not that like panic buying, you know,</p>
<p>blame the irrational consumer, you know,</p>
<p>look at the hard sort of truth</p>
<p>of the way we&rsquo;ve set up our economy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll ask you this, Lex, I know you&rsquo;re a hopeful,</p>
<p>optimistic person.</p>
<p>100%, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am too.</p>
<p>I mean, I write about problems all the time.</p>
<p>And so people think I&rsquo;m sort of like a,</p>
<p>just a Debbie Downer, you know, pessimist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a glass half full kind of guy.</p>
<p>Like I want to identify problems so we can solve them.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got these long lean supply chains.</p>
<p>In the future, do you see more environmental problems</p>
<p>that could disrupt them,</p>
<p>more geopolitical problems that could disrupt trade</p>
<p>from Asia, you know, other institutional failures?</p>
<p>Do those things seem, you know,</p>
<p>potentially more likely in the future</p>
<p>than they have been in say the last 20 years?</p>
<p>Yeah, it almost absolutely seems to be the case.</p>
<p>So you then have to ask the question of</p>
<p>how do we change our supply chains?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s making more resilient</p>
<p>or make them less densely connected,</p>
<p>you know, building a, it&rsquo;s like a, what is it?</p>
<p>You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector</p>
<p>of like trying to build everything,</p>
<p>like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible</p>
<p>with as little reliance on widely distributed sources</p>
<p>of the supply chain as possible.</p>
<p>So maybe like rethinking how much we rely</p>
<p>on the infrastructure of the supply chain.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know, there&rsquo;s some basic,</p>
<p>and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks</p>
<p>in corporate boardrooms looking at risk</p>
<p>and saying that didn&rsquo;t go well,</p>
<p>and maybe it could have even gone worse.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?</p>
<p>At the very least, one of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m hearing about anecdotally</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re starting stuff up, you know,</p>
<p>when they can, right?</p>
<p>Which is, that&rsquo;s probably not sustainable, right?</p>
<p>I mean, at some point, somebody in that corporate boardroom</p>
<p>is gonna say, you know, guys, inventory is getting</p>
<p>kind of heavy and the cost of that is like,</p>
<p>do we, can we really justify that much longer</p>
<p>to the shareholders, right?</p>
<p>We can back off and start, you know,</p>
<p>back, things are back to normal, let&rsquo;s lean out.</p>
<p>Well, my hope is that there&rsquo;s a technology solution</p>
<p>to a lot of aspects of this.</p>
<p>So one of them on the supply chain side</p>
<p>is collecting a lot more data,</p>
<p>like having much more integrated</p>
<p>and accurate representation of the inventory</p>
<p>all over the place,</p>
<p>and the available transportation mechanisms,</p>
<p>the trucks, the all kinds of freight,</p>
<p>and how in the different models</p>
<p>of the possible catastrophes that can happen,</p>
<p>like how will the system respond?</p>
<p>So having a really solid model that you&rsquo;re operating under</p>
<p>as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode</p>
<p>under poor, incomplete information,</p>
<p>which is what seems like is more commonly the case,</p>
<p>except for things like you said, Walmart and Amazon,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to internally get their stuff together</p>
<p>on that front, but that doesn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>So another exciting technological development</p>
<p>as you write about, as you think about is autonomous trucks.</p>
<p>So these are often brought up in different contexts</p>
<p>as the examples of AI and robots taking our jobs.</p>
<p>How true is this?</p>
<p>Should we be concerned?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve really come to epitomize</p>
<p>this anxiety over automation, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a simple idea, right?</p>
<p>Truck that drives itself,</p>
<p>classic blue collar job that pays well,</p>
<p>guy maybe with not a lot of other good options, right?</p>
<p>To sort of make that same income easily,</p>
<p>and you build a robot to take his job away, right?</p>
<p>So I think 2016 or so,</p>
<p>that was the sort of big question out there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually how I started studying it, right?</p>
<p>I just wrapped up the book,</p>
<p>just so happened that somebody was working at Uber,</p>
<p>Uber had just bought auto, saw the book and was like,</p>
<p>hey, can you come out and talk to our engineering teams</p>
<p>about what life is like for truck drivers</p>
<p>and maybe how our technology could make it better.</p>
<p>And at that time, there were a lot of different ideas</p>
<p>about how they were gonna play out, right?</p>
<p>So while the press was saying,</p>
<p>all truckers are gonna lose their jobs,</p>
<p>there were a lot of people in these engineering teams</p>
<p>who thought, okay, if we&rsquo;ve got an individual owner operator</p>
<p>and they can only drive eight or 10 hours a day,</p>
<p>they hop in the back, they get their rest,</p>
<p>and the asset that they own works for them, right?</p>
<p>Sort of perfect, right?</p>
<p>And at that time, there were a bunch of reports</p>
<p>that came out and sort of basically what people did</p>
<p>was they took the category of truck driver.</p>
<p>Some people took a larger category from BLS</p>
<p>of sales and delivery workers</p>
<p>that was about three and a half million workers</p>
<p>and others took the heavy duty truck driver category,</p>
<p>which was at the time about 1.8 million or so.</p>
<p>And they picked a start date and a slope</p>
<p>and said, let&rsquo;s assume that all these jobs</p>
<p>are just gonna disappear.</p>
<p>And really smart researcher, Annette Bernhardt</p>
<p>at the Labor Center at UC Berkeley</p>
<p>was sort of looking around for people</p>
<p>who were sort of deeply into industries</p>
<p>to complicate those analyses, right?</p>
<p>And reached out to me and was like,</p>
<p>what do you think of this?</p>
<p>And I said, the industry is super diverse.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given a ton of thought, but it can&rsquo;t be that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that simple, it never is.</p>
<p>And so she was like, will you do this?</p>
<p>And I was like ready to move on to another topic.</p>
<p>I had like been in trucking for 10 years</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I started looking at it.</p>
<p>And it is, it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>And the initial impacts, and here&rsquo;s the challenge I think,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just a research challenge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fundamental public policy challenge</p>
<p>is we look at the existing industry</p>
<p>and the impacts, the potential impacts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not, you know, nothing.</p>
<p>For some communities and some kinds of drivers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be hard.</p>
<p>And there are a significant number of them.</p>
<p>Nowhere near what people thought.</p>
<p>You know, I estimate it&rsquo;s like around 300,000,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a static picture of the existing industry.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the key with this is, at least in my conclusion</p>
<p>is this is a transformative technology.</p>
<p>We are not going to swap in self driving trucks</p>
<p>for human driven trucks and all else stays the same.</p>
<p>This is gonna reshape our supply chains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna reshape landscapes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna affect our ability to fight climate change.</p>
<p>This is a really important technology in this space.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to predict the future</p>
<p>of the kind of opportunities it will create,</p>
<p>how it will change the world?</p>
<p>So like when you have the internet,</p>
<p>you can start saying like all the kinds of ways</p>
<p>that office work, all jobs will be lost</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to network.</p>
<p>And then software engineering allows you to automate</p>
<p>a lot of the tasks like Microsoft Excel does, you know.</p>
<p>But it opened up so many opportunities,</p>
<p>even with things that are difficult to imagine,</p>
<p>like with the internet, I don&rsquo;t know, Wikipedia,</p>
<p>which is widely making accessible information.</p>
<p>And that increased the general education globally by a lot,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then the ripple effects of that</p>
<p>in terms of your ability to find other jobs</p>
<p>is probably immeasurable.</p>
<p>So is it just a hopeless pursuit to try to predict</p>
<p>if you talk about these six different trajectories</p>
<p>that we might take in automating trucks,</p>
<p>but like as a result of taking those trajectories,</p>
<p>is it a hopeless pursuit to predict</p>
<p>what the future will result in?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It absolutely is.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p>
<p>The question is, what do we want the future to be</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s shape it, right?</p>
<p>And I think this is, and this is the only point</p>
<p>that I really wanna make in my work</p>
<p>for the foreseeable future,</p>
<p>is that we have got to get out of this mindset</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just gonna let technology kind of go</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a natural process and whatever pops out</p>
<p>will fix the problems on the backside.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to recognize that one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we do, right?</p>
<p>You know, and self driving vehicles</p>
<p>is just such a perfect example, right?</p>
<p>We would not be sitting here today</p>
<p>if the Defense Department, right?</p>
<p>If Congress in 2000 had not written into legislation</p>
<p>funding for the DARPA challenges,</p>
<p>which followed, actually I think the funding came</p>
<p>a couple of years later,</p>
<p>but the priority that they wrote in 2000</p>
<p>was let&rsquo;s get a third of all ground vehicles</p>
<p>in our military forces unmanned, right?</p>
<p>And this was before aerial unmanned vehicles</p>
<p>had really sort of proven their worth.</p>
<p>They would come to be incredibly,</p>
<p>like, you know, just blow people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>in terms of their additional capabilities,</p>
<p>the lower costs, you know,</p>
<p>keeping soldiers out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Now, of course they raised other problems</p>
<p>and considerations that I think we&rsquo;re still wrestling with,</p>
<p>but that was even before that they had this priority.</p>
<p>We would not be sitting here today</p>
<p>if Congress in 2000 had not said, let&rsquo;s bring this about.</p>
<p>So they already had that vision, actually.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know the DARPA challenges</p>
<p>is the events that were just kind of like</p>
<p>these seemingly small scale challenges</p>
<p>that brought together some of the smartest roboticists</p>
<p>in the world, and that somehow created enough of a magic</p>
<p>where ideas flourished,</p>
<p>both engineering and scientific,</p>
<p>that eventually then was the catalyst</p>
<p>for creating all these different companies</p>
<p>that took on the challenge.</p>
<p>Some failed, some succeeded,</p>
<p>some are still fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>And that somehow just that little bit of challenge</p>
<p>was the essential spark of progress</p>
<p>that now resulted in this beautiful up and down wave</p>
<p>of hype and profit and all this kind of weird dance</p>
<p>where the B word, billions of dollars</p>
<p>have been thrown around and we still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the T word, trillions of dollars</p>
<p>in terms of transformative effects of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And all that started from DARPA</p>
<p>and that initial vision of, I guess, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>of automating part of the military supply chain.</p>
<p>I did not know that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So they had the same kind of vision for the military</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re not talking about a vision for the civilian,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s trucking or whether it&rsquo;s autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>sort of a ride sharing kind of application.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, what an incredible spark, right?</p>
<p>And just the story of what it produced, right?</p>
<p>I mean, your own work on self driving, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve studied it as an academic, right?</p>
<p>How many great researchers and minds have been harnessed</p>
<p>by this outcome of that spark, right?</p>
<p>And I think this is sort of theoretically about technology,</p>
<p>right, this is what makes it sort of so great</p>
<p>is that this is what makes us human, in my opinion, right?</p>
<p>Is that you conceive of something in your mind</p>
<p>and then you bring it into reality, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what is so great about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re too dumb to realize how difficult it is</p>
<p>so you take it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then eventually you&rsquo;re in too deep.</p>
<p>You might as well solve the problem.</p>
<p>Well, and maybe we&rsquo;re in that situation right now</p>
<p>with self driving.</p>
<p>But, you know, and so let me throw this out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to hear your thoughts on it.</p>
<p>But truck drivers always ask me, like, is this for real?</p>
<p>Like, is this really, like, it&rsquo;s harder than they think,</p>
<p>like, right, and they can&rsquo;t really do this.</p>
<p>And, you know, at first I was like, look, you know,</p>
<p>this is like the defense department</p>
<p>and like basically the top computer science</p>
<p>and robotics departments in the world.</p>
<p>And now Silicon Valley with billions of dollars in funding</p>
<p>and just, you know, some of the smartest, hardest working,</p>
<p>most visionary people focused on what is clearly,</p>
<p>you know, a gigantic market, right?</p>
<p>And what I tell them is like,</p>
<p>if self driving vehicles don&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>I think this will be the biggest technology failure story</p>
<p>in human history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anything else that is just galvanized.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve had people in garages or weird inventors</p>
<p>work on things their whole lives and come really close</p>
<p>and it never happens and it&rsquo;s a great failure story, right?</p>
<p>But never have we had like whole,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about GM, right?</p>
<p>And these are not, you know, these are not tech companies,</p>
<p>right, these are industrial giants, right?</p>
<p>What were in the 20th century,</p>
<p>the pinnacle of industrial production in the world</p>
<p>in human history, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re focused on it now.</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t pull this off, it&rsquo;s like, wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>There was a mass hysteria on a level</p>
<p>in terms of excitement and hype</p>
<p>on a level that&rsquo;s probably unparalleled in technology space.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen that kind of hysteria just studying history</p>
<p>when you talk about military conflict.</p>
<p>So we often wage war with a dream of making a better world</p>
<p>and then realize it costs trillions of dollars</p>
<p>and then we step back and like, and go, wait a minute,</p>
<p>what do we actually get for this?</p>
<p>But in the space of technology,</p>
<p>it seems like all these kinds of large efforts</p>
<p>have paid off.</p>
<p>This, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It seems like, it seems like even GM and Ford</p>
<p>and all these companies now are a little bit like,</p>
<p>hey, or Toyota and even Tesla,</p>
<p>like, are we sure about this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to think about</p>
<p>when you tell the story of this,</p>
<p>this could be one of the big first, perhaps,</p>
<p>but by far the biggest failures of the dream</p>
<p>in the space of technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I was a skeptic for a long time</p>
<p>because of the human factor.</p>
<p>Because for business to work in the space,</p>
<p>you have to work with humans</p>
<p>and you have to work with humans at every level.</p>
<p>So in the truck driving space,</p>
<p>you have to work with the truck driver,</p>
<p>but you also have to work with the society</p>
<p>that has a certain conception of what driving means.</p>
<p>And also you have to have work with businesses</p>
<p>that are not used to this extreme level of technology,</p>
<p>you know, in the basic operation of their business.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be really difficult</p>
<p>to move to autonomous vehicles in that way.</p>
<p>But then I realized that there&rsquo;s certain companies</p>
<p>that are just willing to take big risks</p>
<p>and really innovate.</p>
<p>I think the first impressive company to me was Waymo</p>
<p>or what was used to be the Google self driving car.</p>
<p>And I saw, okay, here&rsquo;s a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to really think longterm</p>
<p>and really try to solve this problem, hire great engineers.</p>
<p>Then I saw Tesla with Mobileye when they first had.</p>
<p>I thought, actually Mobileye is the thing that impressed me.</p>
<p>When I sat down, I thought,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a computer vision person,</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no way a system could keep me in lane</p>
<p>long enough for it to be a pleasant experience for me.</p>
<p>So from a computer vision perspective,</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;d be too many failures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really annoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a gimmick, a toy.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t actually create a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>And when I first was gotten Tesla with Mobileye,</p>
<p>the initial Mobileye system,</p>
<p>it actually held to lane for quite a long time</p>
<p>to where I could relax a little bit.</p>
<p>And it was a really pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t exactly explain why it&rsquo;s pleasant</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like I still have to really pay attention,</p>
<p>but I can relax my shoulders a little bit.</p>
<p>I can look around a little bit more.</p>
<p>And for some reason that was really reducing the stress.</p>
<p>And then over time, Tesla with a lot of the revolutionary</p>
<p>stuff they&rsquo;re doing on the machine learning space</p>
<p>made me believe that there&rsquo;s opportunities here to innovate,</p>
<p>to come up with totally new ideas.</p>
<p>Another very sad story that I was really excited about</p>
<p>is Cadillac SuperCruise system.</p>
<p>It is a sad story because I think I vaguely read in the news</p>
<p>they just said they&rsquo;re discontinuing SuperCruise,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a nice innovative way</p>
<p>of doing driver attention monitoring</p>
<p>and also doing lane keeping.</p>
<p>And it just innovation could solve this</p>
<p>in ways we don&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>And same with in the trucking space,</p>
<p>it might not be as simple as like journalists envision</p>
<p>a few years ago, where everything&rsquo;s just automated.</p>
<p>It might be gradually helping out the truck driver</p>
<p>in some ways that make their life more efficient,</p>
<p>more effective, more pleasant,</p>
<p>remove some of the inefficiencies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about in totally innovative ways.</p>
<p>And that I still have that dream</p>
<p>that I believe to solve the fully autonomous driving problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still many years away,</p>
<p>but on the way to solving that problem,</p>
<p>it feels like there could be,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s bold risk takers and innovators in this space,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an opportunity to come up</p>
<p>with like subtle technologies that make all the difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually just what I realized</p>
<p>is sometimes little design decisions</p>
<p>make all the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Blackberry versus the iPhone.</p>
<p>Why is it that you have a glass and you&rsquo;re using your finger</p>
<p>for all of the work versus the buttons</p>
<p>makes all the difference.</p>
<p>This idea that now that you have a giant screen</p>
<p>so that every part of the experience</p>
<p>is now a digital experience.</p>
<p>So you can have things like apps that change everything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, when you first thinking about</p>
<p>do I want a keyboard or not on a smartphone,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s just the keyboard decision.</p>
<p>But then you later realize by removing the keyboard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re enabling a whole ecosystem of technologies</p>
<p>that are inside the phone.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re making the smartphone into a computer.</p>
<p>And that same way,</p>
<p>who knows how you can transform trucks, right?</p>
<p>By like automating some parts of it,</p>
<p>maybe adding some displays,</p>
<p>maybe allows you to,</p>
<p>maybe giving the truck driver some control</p>
<p>in the supply chain to make decisions</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So where are you on the spectrum of hope</p>
<p>for the role of automation in trucking?</p>
<p>I think automation is inevitable.</p>
<p>And again, I think this is really going to be transformative</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve studied the history of trucking technology</p>
<p>as much as I can.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of great stuff written</p>
<p>and you kind of have to,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a lot of data and places to know</p>
<p>sort of volumes of stuff and how they&rsquo;re changing, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the big revolutionary changes in trucking</p>
<p>are because of constellations of factors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one thing, right?</p>
<p>So Daimler builds a motorized truck</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s 1896, right?</p>
<p>Intercity trucking.</p>
<p>So basically what they use that truck for</p>
<p>is just to swap out horses, right?</p>
<p>They basically do the same thing.</p>
<p>The service doesn&rsquo;t really change, you know?</p>
<p>And then World War I really spurs the development</p>
<p>of sort of bigger, larger trucks,</p>
<p>like spreads air filled tires.</p>
<p>And then we start paving roads, right?</p>
<p>And paved roads, right?</p>
<p>Air filled tires and the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>Now you got a winning mix.</p>
<p>Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out</p>
<p>from under the thumb of the railroads, right?</p>
<p>So there was all of this pent up demand</p>
<p>to get cheaper freight from the countryside</p>
<p>into cities and between cities</p>
<p>that typically had to go by rail.</p>
<p>And so now, you know, 40 years</p>
<p>after that internal combustion engine,</p>
<p>it becomes this absolutely essential, right?</p>
<p>This necessary but not sufficient piece of technology</p>
<p>to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And I think self driving is gonna be,</p>
<p>self driving trucks are gonna be part of that.</p>
<p>And the idea, I guess we credit Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>The idea is, you know, okay, so Sam Walton,</p>
<p>if we can do it like a slight tangent</p>
<p>on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy</p>
<p>and sort of how it has transformed our world.</p>
<p>The central insight that Sam Walton had</p>
<p>that made him the giant that he was</p>
<p>in influencing the way that so many people get stuff</p>
<p>was a trucking insight.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the way that he developed his system,</p>
<p>you build a distribution center</p>
<p>and then you ring it with stores.</p>
<p>Those stores are never further out</p>
<p>from that distribution center</p>
<p>than a human driven truck</p>
<p>can drive back and forth in one day.</p>
<p>And so rather than the way all of his competitors</p>
<p>were doing it with sending trucks all over the place</p>
<p>and having people sleep overnight</p>
<p>and sort of making the trucking service fit</p>
<p>where they had stores,</p>
<p>he designed the layout of the stores</p>
<p>to fit what trucks could do.</p>
<p>And so transportation and logistics</p>
<p>become Walmart&rsquo;s edge</p>
<p>and allows them to dominate the space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge that Amazon has now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve mastered the digital part of it.</p>
<p>And now they got to figure out</p>
<p>how do we dominate the actual physical movement</p>
<p>that complements that.</p>
<p>Others are obviously gonna follow.</p>
<p>But the capabilities of these trucks</p>
<p>is completely different</p>
<p>than the capability of a human driven truck.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re Smith packing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of meat in a warehouse</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to grocery distribution centers,</p>
<p>you have that trucker probably come in the night before</p>
<p>and you make him wait</p>
<p>so that he has a full 10 hour break,</p>
<p>which is what the law requires</p>
<p>so that he can get to the furthest reaches</p>
<p>that he can of one of those stores.</p>
<p>So he can drive his full 11 hours</p>
<p>and bring that meat</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t have to sit overnight</p>
<p>in that refrigerated trailer.</p>
<p>And so their system is based on that.</p>
<p>Now, what happens when that truck</p>
<p>can now travel two times as far, right?</p>
<p>Three times as far.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t need the warehouses where they were.</p>
<p>Now you can go super lean with your inventory.</p>
<p>Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there,</p>
<p>you can put it all right here.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s cheap enough,</p>
<p>substitute those transportation costs</p>
<p>for all that warehousing costs, right?</p>
<p>So this is gonna remake landscapes</p>
<p>in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?</p>
<p>And then of course, the further compliment of that is,</p>
<p>how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?</p>
<p>And the big box supply chain,</p>
<p>it moves very few items in really large quantities</p>
<p>to very few locations pretty slowly, right?</p>
<p>Ecommerce aspires to do something completely different,</p>
<p>move huge varieties of things in small quantities,</p>
<p>virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?</p>
<p>And so that is like that intercity trucking</p>
<p>under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?</p>
<p>The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>so right now I think a lot of the business plans</p>
<p>for sort of automated trucks, right?</p>
<p>And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it</p>
<p>is like, okay, if we swap out a human for a computer,</p>
<p>what are the labor costs per mile?</p>
<p>And like, oh, here&rsquo;s the profitability</p>
<p>of self driving trucks, uh uh.</p>
<p>Like this is transformative technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna change the way we get stuff.</p>
<p>So we could actually get a lot more trucks period</p>
<p>with like with autonomous trucks</p>
<p>because they would enable a very different kind</p>
<p>of transportation networks you think.</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s, and this is where it&rsquo;s like, uh oh.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, so we really thought</p>
<p>we were gonna be electrifying trucks.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re going twice as far,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re moving three times as much,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going three times as far, right?</p>
<p>What does that mean for how far we are</p>
<p>behind on batteries, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got sort of these, you know, ideas about like, man,</p>
<p>we, you know, here&rsquo;s how far,</p>
<p>how close we could get to meet this demand.</p>
<p>That demand is gonna radically change, right?</p>
<p>These trucks are, you know, so then we&rsquo;ve got to think</p>
<p>about, all right, if it&rsquo;s not batteries, you know,</p>
<p>how are we powering these things?</p>
<p>And how many of them are they&rsquo;re gonna be?</p>
<p>Like right now we&rsquo;ve got 5 million containers</p>
<p>that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail.</p>
<p>Rail is three or four times at least more efficient</p>
<p>than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand,</p>
<p>but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a couple of days slower.</p>
<p>So now you cut the cost of that truck,</p>
<p>transportation per mile by 30%.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there</p>
<p>five days faster than rail.</p>
<p>How many millions of containers are gonna leave LA</p>
<p>and Long Beach on self driving trucks and go to Chicago?</p>
<p>And it might look very much like a train</p>
<p>if we go with the platooning solution,</p>
<p>where you have these rows of like,</p>
<p>imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks</p>
<p>or like hundreds of trucks, like some absurd situation.</p>
<p>Just going from LA to Chicago, just this train,</p>
<p>but taking up a highway.</p>
<p>I mean, this is probably a good place</p>
<p>to talk about various scenarios.</p>
<p>Well, before we get there,</p>
<p>can I just make one interesting observation</p>
<p>that I made as a driver?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a truck, you&rsquo;re up higher.</p>
<p>So you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns</p>
<p>and cars move in packs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s academic research on this, right?</p>
<p>But they move in packs.</p>
<p>They kind of bunch up behind a slower car</p>
<p>and then a bunch of them break free.</p>
<p>And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways.</p>
<p>They kind of move in packs</p>
<p>and you can kind of see them in the truck.</p>
<p>So, rather than platoons,</p>
<p>we might have like hives of trucks, right?</p>
<p>So you have like 20 trucks moving</p>
<p>in some coordinated fashion, right?</p>
<p>And then maybe the self driving cars are,</p>
<p>cause people don&rsquo;t like to be around them</p>
<p>or whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>You might have a pod of 20 self driving cars</p>
<p>sort of moving in a packet behind them.</p>
<p>This is what, if the aliens came down</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just observing cars,</p>
<p>which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics</p>
<p>of human civilization is there seems to be these cars</p>
<p>like moving around that would do this kind of analysis</p>
<p>of like, huh, what&rsquo;s the interesting clustering</p>
<p>of situations here,</p>
<p>especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this.</p>
<p>Okay, so what technologically speaking</p>
<p>do you see are the different scenarios</p>
<p>of increasing automation in trucks?</p>
<p>What are some ideas that you think about?</p>
<p>For the most part, I have no influence</p>
<p>on sort of what these ideas were.</p>
<p>So what the project was that I did was I said,</p>
<p>technology is created by people, they solve for X</p>
<p>and they have some conception of what they wanna do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we should start in sort of thinking</p>
<p>about what the impacts might be.</p>
<p>So I went and I talked to everybody I could find</p>
<p>who was thinking about developing a self driving truck.</p>
<p>And the question was essentially,</p>
<p>what are you trying to build?</p>
<p>Like, what do you envision this thing doing?</p>
<p>It turned out that that for a lot of them</p>
<p>was an afterthought.</p>
<p>They knew the sort of technological capabilities</p>
<p>that a self driving vehicle would have.</p>
<p>And those were the problems that they were tackling.</p>
<p>They were engineers and computer scientists and&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, robotics people, I love you so much.</p>
<p>This is, I could talk forever about this,</p>
<p>but yes, there&rsquo;s a technology problem,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s focus on that and we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>the actual impact on society,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s actually going to be applied,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s actually going to be integrated</p>
<p>from a policy and from a human perspective,</p>
<p>from a business perspective later.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s solve the technology problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how life works, friends, but okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know the division of labor</p>
<p>in these companies, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of a business development side,</p>
<p>you know, and then there&rsquo;s the engineering side, right?</p>
<p>And the engineers are like, oh my God,</p>
<p>what are these business development people, you know,</p>
<p>why are they involved in this process?</p>
<p>So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas</p>
<p>that people seem to be batting around</p>
<p>and then really tried to zero in</p>
<p>on a layman&rsquo;s understanding of the limitations, right?</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s really obvious and quite simple.</p>
<p>Highway driving&rsquo;s a lot simpler, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, the plan is simplify the problem, right?</p>
<p>And focus on highways because city driving</p>
<p>is so much more complicated.</p>
<p>So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios,</p>
<p>actually I came up with five</p>
<p>that the developers were talking about.</p>
<p>And then one that I thought was a good idea</p>
<p>that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014,</p>
<p>which was actually something</p>
<p>that the US military was looking at.</p>
<p>I actually first heard about the idea</p>
<p>of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form</p>
<p>in like 2011, I guess it was with Peloton,</p>
<p>which was this sort of early technology entrant</p>
<p>into the trucking industry,</p>
<p>which was working on platooning trucks.</p>
<p>And all they were doing was, you know,</p>
<p>a cooperative adaptive cruise control</p>
<p>as they came to call it.</p>
<p>And we ended up on a panel together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting because I was on that panel</p>
<p>because I was thinking about how we got the best return</p>
<p>on investment for fuel efficient technologies.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s cool, I&rsquo;ll sort of set this up</p>
<p>because it does, it comes into sort of the story</p>
<p>of some of these scenarios.</p>
<p>So when I studied the drivers,</p>
<p>you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks,</p>
<p>like we were talking about before</p>
<p>with long haul and city, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not paid in the city,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got congestion, the turns are tight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of, you know, pedestrians, you know,</p>
<p>all the things that self driving trucks don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>truckers don&rsquo;t like, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not paid, there&rsquo;s lots of waiting time.</p>
<p>And then in the highway, they get to cruise,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting paid, they have control,</p>
<p>they go at their own pace,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making money, they&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010,</p>
<p>this is still when we were thinking</p>
<p>about regenerative braking, you know,</p>
<p>and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution.</p>
<p>The problems with them sort of,</p>
<p>and the advantages, you know,</p>
<p>also split on what I was thinking of</p>
<p>as kind of the rural urban divide at that time, right?</p>
<p>So, like you got the regenerative braking, right?</p>
<p>You can make the truck lighter,</p>
<p>you can keep it local, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get any benefit from that, you know,</p>
<p>hybrid electric on the rural highway,</p>
<p>you want aerodynamics, right?</p>
<p>There, you want low rolling resistance tires</p>
<p>and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?</p>
<p>Where we know with off the shelf technology today,</p>
<p>we could double the fuel economy,</p>
<p>more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck</p>
<p>in that highway segment,</p>
<p>if we segmented the duty cycle, right?</p>
<p>And so in the urban environment,</p>
<p>you want a clean burning truck,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not giving kids asthma,</p>
<p>you want it lighter,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not destroying those less strong pavements, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you can make tighter turns,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a sleeper cab,</p>
<p>because the driver, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully is getting home at night, right?</p>
<p>In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t get you anything in the city,</p>
<p>and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems,</p>
<p>because you turn too tight,</p>
<p>you crunch up all the aerodynamics</p>
<p>that connect the tractor and the trailer.</p>
<p>So the idea that I had was like, okay,</p>
<p>what if we deliberately segmented it?</p>
<p>Like, what if we created these droplets outside cities,</p>
<p>where, you know, a local city driver who&rsquo;s paid by the hour</p>
<p>kind of runs these trailers out once they&rsquo;re loaded,</p>
<p>you know, doesn&rsquo;t sit there and wait while it&rsquo;s being loaded,</p>
<p>they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that&rsquo;s loaded,</p>
<p>they run it out, when it&rsquo;s loaded, they call them,</p>
<p>and they just run them out there and stage them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an Uber driver, but for truckloads.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we have like intermodal.</p>
<p>We have like, basically this would be the equivalent</p>
<p>of like rail to truck intermodal, right?</p>
<p>So you put it on the rail, and then, you know,</p>
<p>a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?</p>
<p>So instead of having the rail,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons,</p>
<p>or what at the time was called long combination vehicles,</p>
<p>which is basically two trailers connected together, right?</p>
<p>Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?</p>
<p>And then instead of that driver like me,</p>
<p>I would pick up something in upstate New York,</p>
<p>drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know,</p>
<p>drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get home every two weeks.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m just running that, you know, that double trailer,</p>
<p>I might be able to go back and forth</p>
<p>from Chicago to Detroit, right?</p>
<p>Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back,</p>
<p>right, and be home every night.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with that at the time,</p>
<p>or one of them was, you know, bridge weights.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t, not all bridges can handle</p>
<p>that much weight on them.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t handle these doubles, right?</p>
<p>And some places can, some places can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time,</p>
<p>and we ended up on the same panel,</p>
<p>and the founders were like,</p>
<p>hey, so what&rsquo;s it like to follow</p>
<p>really close behind another truck?</p>
<p>Which was kind of the stage that they were at was like,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s that experience gonna be like?</p>
<p>And I was like, truckers aren&rsquo;t gonna like it, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just like the cardinal rule</p>
<p>is following distance.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the one you really shouldn&rsquo;t violate, right?</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re out on the road,</p>
<p>like you have that trucker like right on your ass,</p>
<p>you know, people remember that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t remember the 99.9% of truckers</p>
<p>that are not on their ass, you know?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re very careful about that.</p>
<p>But when the trucks are really close together,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s benefits in terms of aerodynamics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon,</p>
<p>you want them to be close together,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s very uncomfortable for truckers.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the,</p>
<p>I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down</p>
<p>their work on this.</p>
<p>And I think that ended up being still an open question.</p>
<p>Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers</p>
<p>who at least one, maybe two of which</p>
<p>had actually driven in their platoons.</p>
<p>And I got completely different experiences.</p>
<p>Some of them were like, it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m like in communication with that other driver.</p>
<p>You know, I can see on a screen what&rsquo;s out,</p>
<p>you know, the front of his truck.</p>
<p>And then some were like, it&rsquo;s too close.</p>
<p>And it might be one of those things that&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know, it takes an adjustment to sort of get there.</p>
<p>So you get the aerodynamic advantage,</p>
<p>which, you know, saves fuel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some problems though, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;re getting that aerodynamic advantage</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a low pressure system</p>
<p>in front of that following truck.</p>
<p>But the engine is designed with higher pressure</p>
<p>feeding that engine, right?</p>
<p>So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make</p>
<p>and, you know, still the benefits are there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one scenario.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the automation</p>
<p>of that acceleration and braking.</p>
<p>Starsky, which, you know,</p>
<p>probably a lot of your listeners heard about,</p>
<p>was working on another scenario,</p>
<p>which was, you know, to solve that local problem</p>
<p>was gonna do teleoperation, right?</p>
<p>Sort of remote piloting.</p>
<p>I had the chance to, you know,</p>
<p>sort of watch them do that.</p>
<p>You know, they drove a truck in Florida</p>
<p>from San Francisco in one of their offices.</p>
<p>That was really interesting.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>In case it&rsquo;s not clear,</p>
<p>teleoperation means you&rsquo;re controlling the truck remotely,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a video game.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to witness it.</p>
<p>Does it actually work?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons?</p>
<p>You know, one of the problems with doing research like this</p>
<p>with all these Silicon Valley folks is the NDAs.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m able to say</p>
<p>about sort of watching it,</p>
<p>but obviously they&rsquo;re public statements</p>
<p>about sort of what the challenges are, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about the latency</p>
<p>and the ability to sort of in real time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s challenges there.</p>
<p>Let me say one thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking to the&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve talked to the Waymo CTO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in conversations with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the head of trucking, Boris Softman,</p>
<p>in next month, actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of his because he was,</p>
<p>I think the founder of Anki,</p>
<p>which is a toy robotics company.</p>
<p>So I love human robot interaction.</p>
<p>And he created one of the most effective</p>
<p>and beautiful toy robots.</p>
<p>Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s way too much marketing in these conversations</p>
<p>and not enough showing off both the challenge</p>
<p>and the beauty of the engineering efforts.</p>
<p>And that seems to be the case</p>
<p>for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies.</p>
<p>They put up this, you&rsquo;re talking about NDAs.</p>
<p>For some reason, rightfully or wrongfully,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s been so much hype</p>
<p>and so much money being made,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see the upside in being transparent</p>
<p>and educating the public about how difficult the problem is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more effective for them to say,</p>
<p>we have everything solved.</p>
<p>This will change everything.</p>
<p>This will change society as we know it.</p>
<p>And just kind of wave their hands</p>
<p>as opposed to exploring together</p>
<p>like these different scenarios.</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons?</p>
<p>Why is it really difficult?</p>
<p>You know, what are the gray areas</p>
<p>of where it works and doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the human in this picture</p>
<p>of the both sort of the operators</p>
<p>and the other humans on the road?</p>
<p>All of that, which are fascinating human problems,</p>
<p>fascinating engineering problems</p>
<p>that I wish we could have a conversation about</p>
<p>as opposed to always feeling like it&rsquo;s just marketing talk.</p>
<p>Because a lot of what we&rsquo;re talking about now,</p>
<p>even you with having private conversations under NDA,</p>
<p>you still don&rsquo;t have the full picture of everything,</p>
<p>of how difficult this problem is.</p>
<p>One of the big questions I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>still have is how difficult is driving?</p>
<p>I disagree with Elon Musk and Jim Keller on this point.</p>
<p>I have a sense that driving is really difficult.</p>
<p>You know, the task of driving, just broadly.</p>
<p>This is like philosophy talk.</p>
<p>How much intelligence is required to drive a car?</p>
<p>So from like a Jim Keller,</p>
<p>who used to be the head of autopilot,</p>
<p>the idea is that it&rsquo;s just a collision avoidance problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like billiard balls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to convert the drive.</p>
<p>You have to do some basic perception,</p>
<p>a computer vision to convert driving into a game of pool.</p>
<p>And then you just have to get everything into a pocket.</p>
<p>To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance</p>
<p>combined with the fact that people&rsquo;s life is at stake.</p>
<p>And then when people die at the hands of a robot,</p>
<p>the reaction is going to be much more complicated.</p>
<p>So all of that, but that&rsquo;s still an open question.</p>
<p>And the cool thing is all of these companies</p>
<p>are struggling with this question</p>
<p>of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently</p>
<p>such that we can build a business on top of it</p>
<p>and have a product that&rsquo;s going to make</p>
<p>a huge amount of money</p>
<p>and compete with the manually driven vehicles.</p>
<p>And so their teleoperation from Starsky&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is really interesting idea.</p>
<p>How much can, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>that tried to integrate teleoperation in the picture.</p>
<p>Can we reduce some of the costs</p>
<p>while still having reliability,</p>
<p>like catch when the vehicle fails</p>
<p>by having teleoperation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for you scenario number two</p>
<p>is to use teleoperation as part of the picture.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me follow up on that question</p>
<p>of how hard driving is,</p>
<p>because this becomes a big question for researchers</p>
<p>who are thinking about labor market impacts,</p>
<p>because we start from a perspective</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s hard or easy for humans.</p>
<p>And so if you were to look at truck driving prior to a lot,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s been a lot of thinking and debate</p>
<p>in academic research circles</p>
<p>around sort of how you estimate labor impacts,</p>
<p>what these models look like.</p>
<p>And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job,</p>
<p>object recognition, really easy for people, right?</p>
<p>Really hard for computers.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that truck drivers do that we see as super easy</p>
<p>and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago,</p>
<p>routine, and it&rsquo;s not for a computer, right?</p>
<p>It turns out to be something that we do naturally</p>
<p>that is sort of cutting edge, right?</p>
<p>Computer science.</p>
<p>So on the teleoperation question,</p>
<p>I think this is a more interesting one</p>
<p>than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly.</p>
<p>There are gonna be problems, right?</p>
<p>And this is one of the complexities</p>
<p>of sort of putting these things out in the world.</p>
<p>And if you see the real world of trucking,</p>
<p>you realize, wow, it&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>There are dirt lots, there&rsquo;s gravel,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s salt and ice and cold weather,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s equipment that just gets left out</p>
<p>in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>and the brakes don&rsquo;t get maintained,</p>
<p>and somebody was supposed to service something</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t, you know?</p>
<p>And so you imagine, okay, we&rsquo;ve got this vehicle</p>
<p>that can drive itself,</p>
<p>which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors</p>
<p>to tell it that the doors are still closed</p>
<p>and the trailer&rsquo;s still hooked up</p>
<p>and each of the tires has adequate pressure,</p>
<p>and any number of, probably hundreds of sensors</p>
<p>that are gonna be sort of relaying information.</p>
<p>And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever,</p>
<p>it goes out.</p>
<p>Now, do we have some fleet of technicians</p>
<p>sort of continually cruising the highways</p>
<p>and sort of servicing these things as they do what?</p>
<p>Pull themselves off to the side of the road</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;ve got a sensor fault, I&rsquo;m pulling over,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s some level of safety critical faults</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>So that suggests that there might be a role</p>
<p>for teleoperation even with self driving.</p>
<p>And when I push people on it in the conversations,</p>
<p>they all are like, yeah, we kind of have that</p>
<p>on the bottom of the list,</p>
<p>figure out how to rescue truck, you know?</p>
<p>I guess on the to do list, right?</p>
<p>After solving the self driving question is like,</p>
<p>yeah, what do we do with the problems, right?</p>
<p>I mean, no, we could imagine like, all right,</p>
<p>we have some protocol that the truck is not,</p>
<p>realizes the system says not safe for operation,</p>
<p>pull to the side.</p>
<p>Good, you have a crash, but now you got a truck stranded</p>
<p>on the side of the road.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna send out somebody to like calibrate things</p>
<p>and check out what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>or that sounds like expensive labor,</p>
<p>it sounds like downtime, it sounds like the kind of things</p>
<p>that shippers don&rsquo;t like to happen to their freight,</p>
<p>you know, in a just in time world.</p>
<p>And so wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could just sort of,</p>
<p>you know, loop your way into the controls of that truck</p>
<p>and say, all right, we&rsquo;ve got a sensor out,</p>
<p>says that the tire is bad,</p>
<p>but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna drive it to our next depot,</p>
<p>you know, maybe the next rider or Penske location, right?</p>
<p>Sort of all these service locations around</p>
<p>and have a technician take a look at it.</p>
<p>So teleoperation often gets this, you know,</p>
<p>so dismissive, you know, commentary from other folks</p>
<p>working on other scenarios.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s potentially more relevant</p>
<p>than we hear publicly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a hard problem.</p>
<p>And, you know, for me, I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to interact with people that take on hard problems</p>
<p>and solve them and they&rsquo;re rare.</p>
<p>What Tesla has done with their data engine.</p>
<p>So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved</p>
<p>without collecting a huge amount of data</p>
<p>and organizing it well,</p>
<p>not just collecting, but organizing it.</p>
<p>And exactly what Tesla is doing now</p>
<p>is what I thought it would be,</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t see car companies doing that,</p>
<p>including Tesla.</p>
<p>And now that they&rsquo;re doing that, it&rsquo;s like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to take on this huge effort seriously.</p>
<p>To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like taking seriously what happens when it fails.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer,</p>
<p>like ride sharing, what&rsquo;s the customer experience like?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of videos online now</p>
<p>where people are like the car fails and it pulls off</p>
<p>to the side and you call like customer service</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically sitting there for a long time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s confusion.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a rescue that comes</p>
<p>and they start to drive.</p>
<p>I mean, just the whole experience is a mess</p>
<p>that has a ripple effect to how you trust</p>
<p>in the entirety of the experience.</p>
<p>But like actually taking on the problem</p>
<p>of that failure case and revolutionizing that experience,</p>
<p>both for trucking and for ride sharing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an amazing opportunity there</p>
<p>because that feels like it would change everything.</p>
<p>If you can reliably know when the failures happen,</p>
<p>which they will, you have a clear plan</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t significantly affect the efficiency</p>
<p>of the whole process, that could be the game changer.</p>
<p>And if teleoperation is part of that,</p>
<p>it could be just like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>it could be teleoperation or it could be like a fleet</p>
<p>of rescuers that can come in, which is a similar idea.</p>
<p>But teleoperation, obviously that allows you</p>
<p>to just have a network of monitors</p>
<p>of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks</p>
<p>and taking over when needed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful vision of the future</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s millions of robots</p>
<p>and only thousands of humans monitoring</p>
<p>those millions of robots.</p>
<p>That seems like a perfect dance</p>
<p>of allowing humans to do what they do best</p>
<p>and allowing robots to do what they do best.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are,</p>
<p>and we just applied for an NSF we didn&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s watching, but with some folks from Wisconsin</p>
<p>who do teleoperation, right?</p>
<p>And some of this is used for like rovers</p>
<p>and I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems.</p>
<p>But one of the things we wanted to study</p>
<p>were these mines, these Rio Tinto mines in Australia</p>
<p>where they remotely pilot the trucks.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some autonomy, I guess,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s overseen by a remote operator</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s near Perth and it&rsquo;s quite remote</p>
<p>and they retrained the truck drivers</p>
<p>to be the remote operators, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s autonomy in the port of Rotterdam</p>
<p>and places like that where there are jobs there.</p>
<p>And so I think, and maybe we&rsquo;ll get to this later,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a real policy question</p>
<p>about sort of who&rsquo;s gonna lose and what we do about it</p>
<p>and whether or not there are opportunities there</p>
<p>that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale</p>
<p>a little bit to make sure that there&rsquo;s some give back</p>
<p>to the community that&rsquo;s taking the hit.</p>
<p>So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers,</p>
<p>maybe they go in these communities</p>
<p>that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It may not be the cheapest place to do it</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have great connectivity</p>
<p>and it may not be where the upper level managers wanna be</p>
<p>and places like that, issues like that, right?</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>both from sort of a practical scenario situation</p>
<p>of how it&rsquo;s gonna work, but also from a policy perspective.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s platoons, there&rsquo;s teleoperation,</p>
<p>and this is taking care of some of the highway driving</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Is there other ideas like,</p>
<p>is there other ideas, scenarios</p>
<p>that you have for autonomous trucks?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually</p>
<p>is just facility to facility, right?</p>
<p>The sort of, it can&rsquo;t go everywhere,</p>
<p>but a lot of logistics facilities</p>
<p>are very close to interstates</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re on big commercial roads</p>
<p>without bikes and parked cars and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And some of the jobs that I think are really first</p>
<p>on the chopping block are these LTL,</p>
<p>that less than truckload, what&rsquo;s called line haul, right?</p>
<p>So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal</p>
<p>with those full trailers.</p>
<p>And those facilities are often located strategically</p>
<p>to avoid congestion, right?</p>
<p>And to be in big industrial facilities.</p>
<p>So you could imagine that being the first place</p>
<p>you see a Waymo self driving truck rollout</p>
<p>might be sort of direct facility to facility</p>
<p>for UPS or FedEx or less than truckload care.</p>
<p>And the idea there is fully driverless,</p>
<p>so potentially not even a driver in the truck,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going from facility to facility empty,</p>
<p>zero occupancy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t keep those drivers out overnight,</p>
<p>those drivers do a run back and forth typically,</p>
<p>or in a team go back and forth in one day.</p>
<p>So from the people you&rsquo;ve spoken with so far,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>How far are we away from, which scenario is closest</p>
<p>and how far away are we from that scenario</p>
<p>of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?</p>
<p>Most folks are focused on another scenario,</p>
<p>which is the exit to exit, right?</p>
<p>Which looks like that urban truck ports thing</p>
<p>that I laid out earlier.</p>
<p>So you have a human driven truck</p>
<p>that comes out to a drop lot,</p>
<p>it meets up with an autonomous truck,</p>
<p>that truck then drives it on the interstate to another lot,</p>
<p>and then a human driver picks it up.</p>
<p>There are a couple variations maybe on that.</p>
<p>So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The other thing you could do, right,</p>
<p>is to say, all right, I&rsquo;ve got a truck that can drive itself,</p>
<p>and I refer to this one as autopilot,</p>
<p>but you have a human drive it out to the interstate,</p>
<p>but rather than have that transaction</p>
<p>where the human driven truck detaches the trailer</p>
<p>and it gets coupled up to a self driving truck,</p>
<p>they just, that human driver just hops on the interstate</p>
<p>with that truck and goes in back and goes off duty</p>
<p>while the truck drives itself.</p>
<p>And so you have a self driving truck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not driverless, right?</p>
<p>And just to clarify,</p>
<p>because Tesla uses the term autopilot instead of airplanes,</p>
<p>and so everybody uses the word autopilot,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re referring to essentially full autonomy,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s exit to exit,</p>
<p>the truck driver is onboard the truck,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re sleeping in the back or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy policy questions,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So basically for the Department of Transportation,</p>
<p>for you to be off duty for safety reasons,</p>
<p>you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility.</p>
<p>So that truck has to not encounter a construction site</p>
<p>or inclement weather or whatever it might be,</p>
<p>and call to you and say, hey, you know,</p>
<p>or I mean, obviously, right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re imagining connected vehicles as well, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in a self driving truck,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the back and trucks 20 miles ahead</p>
<p>experience some problem, right?</p>
<p>That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>And it signals to your truck,</p>
<p>hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got to hop in the seat.</p>
<p>That would mean that they&rsquo;re on duty</p>
<p>according to the way that the current rules are written,</p>
<p>they have some responsibility.</p>
<p>And part of that is, you know,</p>
<p>we need them to get rest, right?</p>
<p>They need to have uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I call autopilot.</p>
<p>The final scenario is one that I thought was actually</p>
<p>the one scenario that was good for labor, you know,</p>
<p>which I proposed is I was like, well, here&rsquo;s an idea,</p>
<p>you know, that would be like, actually good for workers.</p>
<p>And just another brief aside here.</p>
<p>The history of trucking over the last, you know, 40 years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of technological change.</p>
<p>So when I learned to drive the truck,</p>
<p>I had to learn to manually shift it like I was describing,</p>
<p>you had to read these fairly complicated, you know,</p>
<p>big sets of laminated maps to figure out</p>
<p>where the truck can go and where it couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which is a big deal, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, you take these trucks on the wrong road</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re destroying a bridge</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re doing a can opener,</p>
<p>which is where you try to drive it under a bridge too low.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen that on YouTube,</p>
<p>if not, you know, check it out, you know, truck can opener.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some bridges that are famous for it,</p>
<p>right, and there&rsquo;s one I think called the can opener</p>
<p>and you can find on YouTube.</p>
<p>And, you know, you had to log those hours like manually</p>
<p>and sort of do the math and plan your work routine.</p>
<p>And I would do this every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna get up at five.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to think about Buffalo and there&rsquo;s traffic there.</p>
<p>So I wanna be through Buffalo by 6.30, you know,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;ll put me, you know, in Cleveland at,</p>
<p>you know, 9.30, which means I&rsquo;ll miss that rush hour, right,</p>
<p>which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know,</p>
<p>and so you do this and now today, you know,</p>
<p>15 years later, truck drivers don&rsquo;t have to do any of that.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have to shift the truck,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to map, you know,</p>
<p>you can figure out the least congested route</p>
<p>to go on and your hours of service are recorded</p>
<p>or a good portion of them are reported automatically.</p>
<p>All of that has been a substantial de skilling</p>
<p>that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages</p>
<p>and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor</p>
<p>and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know,</p>
<p>that I did work under is satellite linked computers.</p>
<p>So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work</p>
<p>and the boss really couldn&rsquo;t see what you were doing</p>
<p>and push you and say, you know, you&rsquo;ve been on break</p>
<p>for 10 hours, why aren&rsquo;t you moving?</p>
<p>You know, and you might tell them, you know,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m tired, you know, like I didn&rsquo;t sleep well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to get a couple more hours, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only gonna accept that so many times</p>
<p>or at least some of those dispatchers are.</p>
<p>So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know,</p>
<p>de skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers</p>
<p>in the labor market, made the work worse.</p>
<p>So I think the burden it&rsquo;s really on the technologists</p>
<p>who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better</p>
<p>and sort of envision ways that it would.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the burden&rsquo;s really, a proof is really on you</p>
<p>to sort of really clearly lay out what that</p>
<p>is gonna look like because it&rsquo;s 30 or 40 years of history</p>
<p>suggests that that technology into labor markets</p>
<p>where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins</p>
<p>that new technology doesn&rsquo;t help workers</p>
<p>or raise their wages.</p>
<p>So it lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tough to know what to do with because yeah,</p>
<p>from a technology perspective, you wanna make the life</p>
<p>of the people doing the job today easier.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Is that what you want?</p>
<p>No, but that like, when you think about like what exactly,</p>
<p>because the reality is you will make their life</p>
<p>potentially a little bit easier,</p>
<p>but that will allow the companies to then hire people</p>
<p>that are less skilled, get those people</p>
<p>that were previously working there fired or lower wages.</p>
<p>And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dark actually.</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>But you were saying that was for you initially the hopeful.</p>
<p>Oh no, so I&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>But one more thing, cause this is not stopping.</p>
<p>And this is another interesting question</p>
<p>about the sort of automation.</p>
<p>And I think Uber is an interesting example here</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, okay, if we had self driving trucks</p>
<p>or self driving cars, we could automate</p>
<p>what used to be taxi service.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already been automated, like the dispatching.</p>
<p>So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare</p>
<p>and the payment is already automated.</p>
<p>So you have to automate steps like this.</p>
<p>So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck.</p>
<p>You have to have the automated mapping.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sort of done all this incremental automation</p>
<p>that could make the truck completely driverless.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some important things happening right now</p>
<p>with the remaining good jobs.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re really paying for</p>
<p>when you get a good truck driver is, like I said,</p>
<p>you get those kind of local skills</p>
<p>of like backing and congested traffic.</p>
<p>Those, it&rsquo;s really impressive to watch</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some value on it certainly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s relatively low value</p>
<p>in the actual driving technique, right?</p>
<p>So you bump something backing into the dock,</p>
<p>it might be a couple of thousand dollars</p>
<p>because you ruin a canopy or something over a dock</p>
<p>or tear up a trailer.</p>
<p>What you really want,</p>
<p>those highly skilled conscientious drivers,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what computers are really good at</p>
<p>is about being conscientious, right?</p>
<p>In the sense of like, they pay attention continually, right?</p>
<p>And how I was describing those long haul segments</p>
<p>where the driver just keeps out of the situations</p>
<p>that could become problematic</p>
<p>and just, they don&rsquo;t look at their phone.</p>
<p>I mean, they take the job seriously and they&rsquo;re safe</p>
<p>and you can give somebody a skills test, right?</p>
<p>As a CDL examiner, you could take them out and say,</p>
<p>all right, I need you to go around these cones</p>
<p>and drive safely through this school zone.</p>
<p>But what really proves that you&rsquo;re a safe driver</p>
<p>is two years without an accident, right?</p>
<p>Because that means that day after day,</p>
<p>hour after hour, mile after mile,</p>
<p>you did the right thing, right?</p>
<p>And not when it was like, oh, some situations emerging,</p>
<p>but just consistently over time</p>
<p>kept yourself out of accident situations.</p>
<p>And you can see this with drivers who are a million</p>
<p>or 2 million safe miles.</p>
<p>The value of those drivers for Walmart</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t run over minivans.</p>
<p>The company I worked for,</p>
<p>they ran over minivans on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So when I was trained, they said, we kill 20 people a year.</p>
<p>We send someone to the funeral,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big check involved, don&rsquo;t be that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna go to your funeral</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna be the person who caused that funeral.</p>
<p>Okay, so they just write that off.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s just part of the business model.</p>
<p>Now, forward collision avoidance</p>
<p>can basically eliminate the vast majority</p>
<p>of those accidents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the value of a really expensive</p>
<p>conscientious driver is based on.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t run over minivans.</p>
<p>So as soon as you have that forward collision avoidance,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen to the wages of those drivers?</p>
<p>By way of a therapy session, help me understand,</p>
<p>is a collision avoidance,</p>
<p>automated collision avoidance systems,</p>
<p>are they good or bad for society?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is, they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Right. They&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>But what do we do about the pain of a workforce</p>
<p>in the short term because their wages are gonna go down</p>
<p>because the job starts requiring less and less skill?</p>
<p>Is there a hopeful message here</p>
<p>where other jobs are created?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a sociologist, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna think about what&rsquo;s the structure behind that</p>
<p>that creates that pain, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s ownership, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t call it capitalism for nothing.</p>
<p>What capitalists do is they figure out cheaper,</p>
<p>more efficient ways to do stuff.</p>
<p>And they use technology to do that oftentimes, right?</p>
<p>This is the remarkable history of the last couple centuries</p>
<p>and all the productivity gains is,</p>
<p>people who were in a competitive market saying,</p>
<p>if I have to do it, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>Cause like my competitor over there is gonna eat my lunch</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not on my game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to invest in this technology</p>
<p>to make it more efficient, to make it cheaper.</p>
<p>And what do you look for?</p>
<p>You look for oftentimes, you look for labor costs, right?</p>
<p>You look for high value labor.</p>
<p>If I can take a hundred and,</p>
<p>a lot of these truck drivers make good money,</p>
<p>a hundred thousand dollars, good benefits,</p>
<p>vacation, retirement.</p>
<p>If I can replace them with a $35,000 worker</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m competing with maybe a low wage retail employer</p>
<p>rather than some other more expensive employers</p>
<p>for skilled blue collar workers, I&rsquo;m gonna do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>And so I think those are the bigger questions</p>
<p>around this technology, right?</p>
<p>Is like, are workers gonna get screwed by this?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, most likely.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>So one of the things you say is,</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, the numbers of workers</p>
<p>that will feel this pain is not perhaps as large</p>
<p>as the journalists kind of articulate,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, the pain is real.</p>
<p>And I guess my question here is,</p>
<p>do you have an optimistic vision</p>
<p>about the transformative effects</p>
<p>of autonomous trucks on society?</p>
<p>Like if you look 20 years from now</p>
<p>and perhaps see maybe 30 years from now,</p>
<p>perhaps see these autonomous trucks</p>
<p>doing the various parts of the scenarios you listed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just hundreds of thousands of them,</p>
<p>just like veins, like blood flowing through veins</p>
<p>on the interstate system.</p>
<p>What kind of world do you see that&rsquo;s a better world</p>
<p>than today that involves such trucks?</p>
<p>Yeah, can I defend myself first?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m reading the comments right now</p>
<p>of people, of the economists who are telling me.</p>
<p>Another commenter, dear PhD in economics.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, dear PhD in economics,</p>
<p>I know that higher skilled jobs</p>
<p>are created by technological advancement, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there are big questions about how many of them,</p>
<p>right, so the idea that we would create</p>
<p>more expensive labor positions, right,</p>
<p>with a new technology, right?</p>
<p>You better check your business plan</p>
<p>if your idea is to take a bunch of low wage labor</p>
<p>and replace it with the same amount of high wage labor,</p>
<p>right, so there&rsquo;s a question about how many of those jobs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the really important social</p>
<p>and political question of are they the same people, right?</p>
<p>And do they live in the same places?</p>
<p>And I think that kind of geography</p>
<p>is a huge issue here with the impacts, right?</p>
<p>Lots of rural workers.</p>
<p>Interesting politically, lots of red state workers, right?</p>
<p>Lots of blue state, maybe union folks</p>
<p>who are gonna try to slow autonomy</p>
<p>and lots of red state representatives in the house maybe</p>
<p>who wanna stand up for their trucker constituents.</p>
<p>So just to defend myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field</p>
<p>is not good at measuring the landscape</p>
<p>of human pain and suffering.</p>
<p>So sometimes you can forget in the numbers</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s real lives that are at stake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I suppose sociology is better at doing.</p>
<p>So we try sometimes, sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, the problem with, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who loves psychology and psychiatry</p>
<p>and a little bit, I guess, of sociology.</p>
<p>I realize how little, how tragically flawed the field is,</p>
<p>not because of lack of trying,</p>
<p>but just how difficult the problems are.</p>
<p>To do really thorough studies</p>
<p>that understand the fundamentals of human behavior</p>
<p>and this, yes, landscape of human suffering,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost an impossible task without the data.</p>
<p>And we currently don&rsquo;t, not everybody&rsquo;s richly integrated</p>
<p>to where they&rsquo;re fully connected</p>
<p>and all their information is being recorded</p>
<p>for sociologists to study.</p>
<p>So you have to make a lot of inferences.</p>
<p>You have to talk to people.</p>
<p>You have to do the interviews as you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And through that really difficult work,</p>
<p>try to understand, hear the music</p>
<p>that nobody else is hearing,</p>
<p>the music of what people are feeling,</p>
<p>their hopes, their dreams, and the crushing of their dreams</p>
<p>due to some kind of economic forces.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;ve just lived that</p>
<p>for four and a half years of probably elites,</p>
<p>let me just go out on a limb and say,</p>
<p>not understanding the sort of emotional</p>
<p>and psychological currents</p>
<p>of a large portion of the population, right?</p>
<p>And just being stunned by it and confused, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t confusing for me after having talked to truckers.</p>
<p>Again, trucking is a job of last resort.</p>
<p>These are people who&rsquo;ve already lost</p>
<p>that manufacturing job oftentimes,</p>
<p>already lost that construction job to just aging, right?</p>
<p>So what can we do, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sort of the positive vision?</p>
<p>Because like, we&rsquo;ve got tons of highway deaths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, and just the big picture is,</p>
<p>and this is the opportunity, I guess, for investors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hugely inefficient system.</p>
<p>So we buy this truck,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this low wage worker in it oftentimes.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m setting aside those really good</p>
<p>line haul jobs in LTL, those are a different case.</p>
<p>That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might,</p>
<p>the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the truck is designed to do</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes the money for the company.</p>
<p>In other seven, eight hours a day,</p>
<p>the driver&rsquo;s doing other kinds of work</p>
<p>that is not driving.</p>
<p>And then the rest of the day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically living out of the truck.</p>
<p>You really can&rsquo;t find a more inefficient use of an asset</p>
<p>than that, right?</p>
<p>Now, a big part of that is we pay for the roads</p>
<p>and we pay for the rest areas and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>So the way that I work and the way that I think</p>
<p>about these problems is I try to find analogies, right?</p>
<p>Sort of labor processes and things that make economic sense</p>
<p>that seem in the same area of the economy,</p>
<p>but have some different characteristics for workers, right?</p>
<p>And sort of try to figure out</p>
<p>why does the economics work there, right?</p>
<p>And so if you look at those really good jobs,</p>
<p>the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver</p>
<p>would know that it&rsquo;s one of those drivers</p>
<p>is that there are multiple trailers, right?</p>
<p>So you see these, like maybe it&rsquo;s three small trailers,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s two sort of medium sized trailers.</p>
<p>Some places you might even see</p>
<p>two really big trailers together.</p>
<p>You do that because labor is expensive, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s highly skilled.</p>
<p>And so you use it efficiently and you say, all right,</p>
<p>rather than having you haul that little trailer</p>
<p>out of the ports, that sort of half size container,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna wait till we get three</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna coordinate the movement</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re three ready.</p>
<p>You go do what truckers call make a set,</p>
<p>put them together, right, and you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a massive productivity gain, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re hauling two, three times as much freight.</p>
<p>So the positive scenario that I threw out in 2018</p>
<p>was why not have a human driven truck</p>
<p>with a self driving truck that follows it, right?</p>
<p>Just a drone unit.</p>
<p>And to me, this seemed as a non computer scientist,</p>
<p>a non computer scientist, a sociologist, right?</p>
<p>This made a lot of sense because when I got done talking</p>
<p>to the computer scientists and the engineers,</p>
<p>they were like, well, it&rsquo;s like object recognition,</p>
<p>decision making algorithm, all this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, so why don&rsquo;t you leave</p>
<p>the human brain in the lead vehicle, right?</p>
<p>You got all that processing and then all that following.</p>
<p>Now, again, this is sort of me being a lay person.</p>
<p>I said, why don&rsquo;t, then that following truck, right,</p>
<p>makes direction from the front.</p>
<p>It uses the rear of the trailer as a reference point.</p>
<p>It maintains the lane.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got cooperative adaptive cruise control</p>
<p>and that you double the productivity of that driver.</p>
<p>You solve that problem that I hated</p>
<p>in my urban truck ports thing about the bridge weight.</p>
<p>Cause when you get to the bridges,</p>
<p>the two trucks can just spread out just enough</p>
<p>to make the bridge weight, right?</p>
<p>And you can just program that in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re 50 feet further apart,</p>
<p>100 feet further apart.</p>
<p>So interesting sort of, I think, story about this</p>
<p>that leads to kind of, I think, the policy questions.</p>
<p>In, I guess, 2017, Jack Reed and Susan Collins</p>
<p>and requested from the Senate,</p>
<p>the Senate requested research on what the impacts</p>
<p>of self driving trucks would be.</p>
<p>And the first stage of that was for the GAO</p>
<p>to do a report, sort of looking at the lay of the land,</p>
<p>talking to some experts.</p>
<p>And I was working on my 2018 report,</p>
<p>help contribute to that GAO report.</p>
<p>And I had the six scenarios, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, here&rsquo;s what Starsky&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Embark and Uber are doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Waymo might be doing.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Peloton&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the autopilot scenario.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s this one that I think</p>
<p>actually could be good for drivers.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got that driver who&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>two times the freight.</p>
<p>Their decisions are more important.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re managing a more complex system, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably gonna have to have</p>
<p>some global understanding of how to,</p>
<p>the environments in which it can operate safely, right?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking upskilling, right?</p>
<p>And so the GAO sort of writes up these different scenarios</p>
<p>and the idea is that it&rsquo;s gonna prepare</p>
<p>for this Department of Transportation,</p>
<p>Department of Labor set of processes</p>
<p>to engage stakeholders and sort of get industry perspectives</p>
<p>and then do a study on the labor impacts.</p>
<p>So that DOT, DOL process starts to happen</p>
<p>and I get to the workshop and a friend was sitting</p>
<p>at the table next to me and he holds up the scenarios</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna have us discuss at this workshop.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, hey, these look really familiar, right?</p>
<p>They were the scenarios from the report,</p>
<p>but there were only five instead of six.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>The sixth scenario, which was the upskilling labor,</p>
<p>good for workers scenario, wasn&rsquo;t discussed.</p>
<p>So to clarify that the integral piece of technology</p>
<p>there is platooning.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in a sense it&rsquo;s platooning,</p>
<p>but, and in fairness, right, as I pitched that idea</p>
<p>or sort of ran that idea by the computer scientists</p>
<p>and engineers and product managers that I would talk to,</p>
<p>they would say, we thought about that,</p>
<p>but that following truck, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<p>That thing, basically we had to engineer that</p>
<p>to be capable of independent self driving,</p>
<p>because what if there was a cut in</p>
<p>or any number of scenarios in which it lost</p>
<p>that connection to the lead truck for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Boo hoo, platooning is hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s edge cases.</p>
<p>I guarantee the number of edge cases in platooning</p>
<p>is orders of magnitude lower than the number of edge cases</p>
<p>in the general solo full self drive.</p>
<p>You do not need to solve the full self driving problem.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>probability of dangerous events,</p>
<p>it just seems with platooning,</p>
<p>then like you can deal with cut ins.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is beyond,</p>
<p>this is one of the challenge obviously of being a researcher</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t really have any background</p>
<p>in the technology, right?</p>
<p>So I can dream this up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I have no idea if it&rsquo;s feasible.</p>
<p>Well, let me speak, you spoke to the PhDs in economics.</p>
<p>Let me speak to the PhDs in computer science.</p>
<p>If you think platooning is as hard</p>
<p>as the full self driving problem,</p>
<p>we need to talk, because I think that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I think platooning, and in fact,</p>
<p>I think platooning is an interesting idea</p>
<p>for ride sharing as well,</p>
<p>for the general autonomous driving problem,</p>
<p>not just trucking, but obviously trucking</p>
<p>is the big, big benefit,</p>
<p>because the number of A to B points in trucking</p>
<p>is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think that&rsquo;s a great idea,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying it was removed.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you can go, you know,</p>
<p>and listeners could go to these reports.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re publicly available.</p>
<p>And they explain why in the footnote.</p>
<p>And they note that there was this other scenario</p>
<p>suggested by at least me,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t remember if they said someone else did too.</p>
<p>But they said, you know, we didn&rsquo;t include it</p>
<p>because no developers were working on it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Full disclosure,</p>
<p>that was the approach that I took in my research, right?</p>
<p>Which was to go to the developers and say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your vision, right?</p>
<p>What are you trying to develop?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>And maybe, you know,</p>
<p>and then I tried to think outside the box at the end</p>
<p>by adding that one, right?</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s one that I have, you know,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t talking about that could be cool.</p>
<p>Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014</p>
<p>for like fuel convoys.</p>
<p>So you could just have like one super armored lead fuel</p>
<p>truck, right?</p>
<p>In a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases</p>
<p>in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And then you wouldn&rsquo;t need, you know, the super heavy,</p>
<p>you know, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to protect the human life</p>
<p>in the following truck.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying like, when you talk to Waymo,</p>
<p>when you talk to these kinds of companies,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t at least openly saying they&rsquo;re working on this.</p>
<p>So then it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to include in the list.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, but here&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>This is the Department of Transportation, right?</p>
<p>And the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Maybe they could consider some scenarios.</p>
<p>Like maybe we could say, you know, this, we,</p>
<p>this technology has got a lot of potential.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d like it to do.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d like it to reduce highway deaths,</p>
<p>help us fight climate change, reduce congestion,</p>
<p>you know, all these other, other things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how our policy conversation</p>
<p>around technology is happening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, and people don&rsquo;t think that we should.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the fundamental shift</p>
<p>that we need to have, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved with this a little bit like NHTSA and DOT.</p>
<p>The approach they took is saying,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what the heck we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to just let the innovators do their thing</p>
<p>and not regulate it for a while, just to see.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, you think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you think DOT should provide ideas themselves.</p>
<p>Well, so this is the, this is the great trick</p>
<p>in policy of private actors,</p>
<p>is you get narrow mandates for government agencies, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, the safety case will be handled</p>
<p>by organizations whose mandate is safety.</p>
<p>So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,</p>
<p>who is, you know, going to be a key player,</p>
<p>I argue in an article that I wrote, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be a key player in actually determining</p>
<p>which scenario is most profitable</p>
<p>by setting the rules for truck drivers.</p>
<p>Their mandate is safety, right?</p>
<p>Now they have lots of good people there who want,</p>
<p>you know, who care about truck drivers</p>
<p>and who wish truck drivers jobs were better,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have the authority to say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to write this rule</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for truck drivers, right?</p>
<p>And so when you, you know, we need to say,</p>
<p>you know, as a society, we need to not restrict technology,</p>
<p>not stand in the way of things.</p>
<p>We need to harness it towards the goals that matter, right?</p>
<p>Not whatever comes out the end of the pipeline</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the easiest thing to develop</p>
<p>or whatever is most profitable for the first actor</p>
<p>or whatever, but, you know, and we do,</p>
<p>the thing is we do that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like when we sent people to the moon,</p>
<p>you know, we did that,</p>
<p>and there were tremendous benefits</p>
<p>that followed from it, right?</p>
<p>And we do this all the time in, you know,</p>
<p>trying to cure cancer or whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we can do this, right?</p>
<p>Now the interesting sort of epilogue to that story is,</p>
<p>you know, six months or so, I don&rsquo;t know how long it was,</p>
<p>after those meetings in which that sixth scenario</p>
<p>was not considered, a company called Locomation,</p>
<p>you know, ends up using that,</p>
<p>essentially that basic scenario with a slight variation.</p>
<p>So they leave the human driver in both trucks</p>
<p>and then that following driver goes off duty.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I&rsquo;ve been trying to think</p>
<p>of what the term is, they kind of,</p>
<p>I think of it as like slingshotting,</p>
<p>they sort of, when one runs out of hours,</p>
<p>you know, the one who&rsquo;s off duty goes in front and,</p>
<p>you know, and so, you know, if only they had been,</p>
<p>you know, around six months earlier,</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve been considered by the OT,</p>
<p>but it just says, you know, who has the authority</p>
<p>to propose what these visions of the future are?</p>
<p>Well, some of it is also just the company stepping up</p>
<p>and just doing it, screw the authority,</p>
<p>and showing that it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and then the authority follows.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I really love innovators in the space.</p>
<p>The criticism I have, the very sort of real,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, harsh criticism I have</p>
<p>towards autonomous vehicle companies in the space</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ve gotten culturally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve, it&rsquo;s become acceptable somehow</p>
<p>to do demos and videos,</p>
<p>as opposed to the old school American way</p>
<p>of solving problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a culture in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking to VCs</p>
<p>that have lost that kind of love of solving problems.</p>
<p>They kind of like envision,</p>
<p>if the story you told me in your PowerPoint presentation</p>
<p>is true, how many trillions of dollars</p>
<p>might I be able to make?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something lost in that conversation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not really taking on like the problem</p>
<p>in a real way, so these autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>realize we don&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>we just need to make nice PowerPoint presentations</p>
<p>and not actually deliver products</p>
<p>that like everybody looks outside and says,</p>
<p>holy shit, this is life changing.</p>
<p>This is where I have to give props to Waymo</p>
<p>is they put driverless cars on the road</p>
<p>and like forget PowerPoint slide presentations,</p>
<p>actual cars on the road.</p>
<p>Then you can criticize like,</p>
<p>is that actually going to work?</p>
<p>Who knows, but the thing is they have cars on the road</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I have to give props to Tesla.</p>
<p>They have whatever you want to say about risk</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>they have cars on the road</p>
<p>that have some level of automation</p>
<p>and soon they have trucks on the road as well.</p>
<p>And that kind of, that component,</p>
<p>I think is important part of the policy conversation</p>
<p>because you start getting data from these companies</p>
<p>that are willing to take the big risks</p>
<p>as opposed to making slide decks,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually putting cars on the road</p>
<p>and like real lives are at stake.</p>
<p>They could be lost and they could bankrupt the company</p>
<p>if they make the wrong decisions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s deeply admirable to me.</p>
<p>Speaking of which I have to ask Waymo trucks,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called Waymo Via.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking to the head of trucking at Waymo.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to interact with them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good question to ask the guy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good question of Waymo?</p>
<p>Because they seem to be one of the leaders in the space.</p>
<p>They have the zen like calm</p>
<p>of like being willing to stick with it for the longterm</p>
<p>in order to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I guess they have that luxury, right?</p>
<p>Which I don&rsquo;t think I,</p>
<p>if I had another life as a researcher,</p>
<p>I would love to just study the business strategies</p>
<p>of startups and Silicon Valley sort of structure.</p>
<p>Would you consider Waymo a startup?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s at least not in the things</p>
<p>that seem to matter in this self driving space.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the demos,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have enough data as a sociologist</p>
<p>to really say like, oh, this is why they do what they do.</p>
<p>But my hypothesis is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real scarcity of talent and money for this.</p>
<p>And there certainly was a scarcity of like partnerships</p>
<p>with OEMs and the big trucking companies.</p>
<p>And there was a race for it, right?</p>
<p>And the way that if you don&rsquo;t have the backing of Alphabet,</p>
<p>you do a demo, right?</p>
<p>And you get a few more good engineers who say,</p>
<p>hey, look, they did that cool thing.</p>
<p>Like Anthony Levandowski did with Otto</p>
<p>and that resulted in the Uber purchase of that program.</p>
<p>So what would I ask?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I would ask a lot of questions,</p>
<p>but I think the markets.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also on record and off record conversations</p>
<p>which unfortunately,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking for an on record conversation.</p>
<p>And that I don&rsquo;t know if these companies</p>
<p>are willing to have interesting on record conversations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I assume that like there are questions</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have to ask.</p>
<p>Like I assume they&rsquo;re gonna be actually driverless, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna like keep the driver in there.</p>
<p>So I mean, for the industry,</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting to know</p>
<p>where they see that first adopter, right?</p>
<p>Oh, you mean from like the scenarios that laid out</p>
<p>which one are they going to take on?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, cause that&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s those really expensive good jobs, right?</p>
<p>So those LTL jobs, the like UPS jobs.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s gonna be, that&rsquo;s where labor is too, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the teamsters are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only place they are left, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna be the big fight on the hill</p>
<p>and if labor can muster it, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really cool,</p>
<p>like one thing I would recommend to you and your listeners,</p>
<p>if you really wanna see some like a remarkable page</p>
<p>in sort of the history of labor and automation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a report that Harry Bridges,</p>
<p>who was the socialist leader of the Longshoremen</p>
<p>on the West Coast and just, you know, galvanize that union</p>
<p>and they still control the ports today</p>
<p>because of the sort of vision that he laid down.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, he put out a photo journal report</p>
<p>called Men and Machines and basically what it was,</p>
<p>was it was an internal education campaign</p>
<p>to convince the membership</p>
<p>that they had to go along with automation.</p>
<p>Machines were coming for their jobs</p>
<p>and what the photo journal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a hundred pages or something like that</p>
<p>is like, here&rsquo;s how we used to do it.</p>
<p>Some of you old timers remember it.</p>
<p>Like we used to take the barrels of olive oil</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d stack them in the hold and we&rsquo;d roll them by hand</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d put the timber in and we&rsquo;d, you know,</p>
<p>stack the crates tight, you know,</p>
<p>and that was the pride of the Longshoremen,</p>
<p>was a tight stow.</p>
<p>And now you all know, you know,</p>
<p>there are cranes that come down</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no longer any, you know, rope slings</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re loading bulldozers into the hold</p>
<p>to push the ore up into piles</p>
<p>and then clamshells are coming down</p>
<p>and he made this case to them and he said,</p>
<p>this is why we&rsquo;re signing this agreement</p>
<p>to basically allow the employer to automate</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna lose jobs,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna get a share of the benefits.</p>
<p>And so our wages are gonna go up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna continue to control the hiring</p>
<p>and training of workers.</p>
<p>Our numbers are gonna go down,</p>
<p>but you know, basically that last son of a bitch</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working at the ports,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be one really well paid son of a bitch,</p>
<p>you know, he may just be one standing,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s gonna love his job.</p>
<p>You should check out that report.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting vision of a future</p>
<p>that probably still holds.</p>
<p>That is, I mean, there is some level</p>
<p>to which you have to embrace the automation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and who gets, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the benefits, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, think of the public dollars</p>
<p>that went into developing self driving vehicles</p>
<p>in the early days, right?</p>
<p>Not just the vision of it, right?</p>
<p>Which was a public vision to, you know,</p>
<p>take soldiers out of harm&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>but you know, a lot of money.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some way if you are a business</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s leveraging the technology</p>
<p>from a broad historical ethical perspective,</p>
<p>you do owe it to the bigger community to pay back,</p>
<p>like for all the investment that was paid</p>
<p>to make that technology a reality.</p>
<p>In some sense, I don&rsquo;t know how to make that right, right?</p>
<p>On one, there&rsquo;s this pure capitalism</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s communism and I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to get that balance right.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t have all the answers in here,</p>
<p>you know, and I wouldn&rsquo;t expect, you know,</p>
<p>individual private companies to kind of kick back, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, capitalism doesn&rsquo;t allow that, right?</p>
<p>Unless you have a huge monopoly, right?</p>
<p>And then you can on the backside,</p>
<p>create music halls and libraries and things like that.</p>
<p>But you know, here&rsquo;s what I think, you know,</p>
<p>the basic obligation is, is, you know, come to the table,</p>
<p>like, and have an honest conversation</p>
<p>with the policymakers, with the truck drivers, you know,</p>
<p>with the communities that are at risk.</p>
<p>Like, at least let&rsquo;s talk about these things, you know,</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t look like</p>
<p>the way lobbying works right now.</p>
<p>Where you send a well paid lobbyist to the Hill</p>
<p>to, you know, convince some representative or Senator</p>
<p>to stick a sentence or two in that favors you into the,</p>
<p>like, let&rsquo;s have a real conversation.</p>
<p>Real human conversation.</p>
<p>Can we just do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t play games.</p>
<p>Real, real human conversation.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, mention Autopilot.</p>
<p>Gotta ask you about Tesla, this renegade little company</p>
<p>that seems to be, from my perspective,</p>
<p>revolutionizing autonomous driving</p>
<p>or semi autonomous driving,</p>
<p>or at least the problem of perception and control.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a semi on the way.</p>
<p>They got a truck on the way.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Tesla Semi?</p>
<p>You know, I, and I did have</p>
<p>some very preliminary conversations</p>
<p>with, you know, policy folks there.</p>
<p>You know, nothing really in the tech</p>
<p>or business side of it too much.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>I think because electrification and autonomy</p>
<p>run in opposite directions.</p>
<p>And I just, you know, I don&rsquo;t see the application,</p>
<p>the value in self driving for the truck</p>
<p>that Tesla&rsquo;s gonna produce in the near term.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re not gonna have the battery.</p>
<p>And now you could have wonderful safety systems</p>
<p>and, you know, reinforcing, you know, the auto,</p>
<p>you know, self driving features supporting a skilled driver,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to pull that driver out</p>
<p>for long stretches the way that you are</p>
<p>with driverless trucks.</p>
<p>So do you think, I mean, the reason,</p>
<p>so yeah, the electrification</p>
<p>is not obviously coupled with the automation.</p>
<p>They have a very interesting approach</p>
<p>to semi autonomous pushing towards autonomous driving.</p>
<p>All right, it&rsquo;s very unique.</p>
<p>No LIDAR, now no radar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s computer vision alone from a large,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re collecting huge amounts of data from a large fleet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, unique approach,</p>
<p>bold and fearless in this direction.</p>
<p>If I were to guess whether this approach would work,</p>
<p>I would say, no, it started.</p>
<p>One, you would need a lot of data</p>
<p>and two, because you have actual cars deployed on the road</p>
<p>using a beta version of this product,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a system that&rsquo;s far less safe</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to run into trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible PR, like it just seems like a nightmare,</p>
<p>but it seems to not be the case, at least up to this point.</p>
<p>It seems to be not, you know, on par, if not safer</p>
<p>and it seems to work really well</p>
<p>and the human factor somehow manages,</p>
<p>like drivers still pay attention.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a selection of who is inside</p>
<p>the Tesla autopilot user base, right?</p>
<p>There could be a self selection mechanism there,</p>
<p>but however it works,</p>
<p>these things are not running off the road all the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting whether that can sort of creep</p>
<p>into the trucking space.</p>
<p>Yes, at first the long haul problem is not solved.</p>
<p>They need to charge, but maybe you can solve, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of your scenarios involved small distances</p>
<p>and you know, that last mile aspect,</p>
<p>which is exactly what Tesla is trying to solve</p>
<p>for the regular passenger vehicle space</p>
<p>is the city driving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that you have these trucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, yeah, you solved the last mile delivery</p>
<p>part of some of the scenarios that you mentioned</p>
<p>in autonomous driving space.</p>
<p>Is that, do you think that&rsquo;s from the people you&rsquo;ve spoken</p>
<p>with too difficult of a problem?</p>
<p>The thing that, you know, keeps me so interested</p>
<p>in this space and thinking that it&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>you know, is again, that efficiency question,</p>
<p>that safety question and the way that these economics</p>
<p>can push us potentially, you know,</p>
<p>toward a more efficient system.</p>
<p>So I wanna see those Tesla electric trucks running out</p>
<p>to those truck ports where you&rsquo;ve got those two,</p>
<p>you know, two trucks with a human driver in front, right?</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s now what&rsquo;s powering those</p>
<p>is that hydrogen, you know, I mean, I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s very interesting as a researcher</p>
<p>who does not have a background in technology</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have a horse, you know, in this race.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, for all I know,</p>
<p>self driving trucks will ultimately be achieved</p>
<p>by some biomechanical sensor that uses echolocation</p>
<p>because we took stem cells of bats.</p>
<p>And you know, I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I am completely unable to assess who&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the head or who&rsquo;s behind or who makes sense.</p>
<p>But I think one key component there,</p>
<p>and this is what I see with Tesla often,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite sad to me that other companies</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do this enough, is that first principles thinking,</p>
<p>like, wait, wait, wait, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking at the inefficiencies as opposed to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with quite a few car companies</p>
<p>and they basically have a lot of meetings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of meetings.</p>
<p>And the discussion is like,</p>
<p>how can we make this cheaper, this cheaper, this cheaper,</p>
<p>this component cheaper, this cheaper,</p>
<p>the cheapification of everything, just like you said,</p>
<p>as opposed to saying, wait a minute, let&rsquo;s step back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the entirety of the inefficiencies</p>
<p>in the system.</p>
<p>Like, why have we been doing this like this</p>
<p>for the last few decades?</p>
<p>Like, start from scratch.</p>
<p>Can this be 10X, 100X cheaper?</p>
<p>Like, if we not just decrease the cost</p>
<p>of one component here or this component here</p>
<p>or this component here,</p>
<p>but like, let&rsquo;s like redesign everything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s infrastructure, let&rsquo;s have special lanes</p>
<p>or in terms of truck ports,</p>
<p>as opposed to having regular human control truck ports,</p>
<p>have some kind of weird like sensors,</p>
<p>like where everything about the truck connecting</p>
<p>at that final destination is automated fully</p>
<p>from the ground up.</p>
<p>You build the facility from the ground up</p>
<p>for the autonomous truck.</p>
<p>All those kinds of sort of questions are platooning.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Okay, I know we think platooning is hard,</p>
<p>but can we think through exactly why it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>and can we actually solve it?</p>
<p>Like if we collect a huge amount of data, can we solve it?</p>
<p>And then teleoperation, like, okay, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to have good signal,</p>
<p>but can we actually, can we have,</p>
<p>can we consider the probability of those edge cases</p>
<p>and what to do in the edge cases</p>
<p>when the teleoperation fails?</p>
<p>Like how difficult is this?</p>
<p>What are the costs?</p>
<p>How do we actually construct a teleoperation center</p>
<p>full of humans that are able to pay attention</p>
<p>to a large fleet where the average number of vehicles</p>
<p>per human is like 10 or a hundred?</p>
<p>Like having that conversation as opposed to kind of having,</p>
<p>you show up to work and say, all right,</p>
<p>it seems like because of COVID,</p>
<p>we are not making as much money.</p>
<p>Can we have a cheaper,</p>
<p>can we give less salary to the trucker?</p>
<p>And can we build like decrease the cost</p>
<p>or decrease the frequency at which we buy new trucks?</p>
<p>And when we do buy new trucks,</p>
<p>make them cheaper by making them crappier,</p>
<p>like this kind of discussion.</p>
<p>This is why, to me, it&rsquo;s like Tesla is like rare on this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some sectors in which innovation</p>
<p>is part of the culture.</p>
<p>In the automotive sector, for some reason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as much.</p>
<p>This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM</p>
<p>are struggling with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re really good at making cars at scale cheap.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like legit good.</p>
<p>Like Toyota at this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re some of the greatest manufacturing people</p>
<p>in the world, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But then when it comes to hiring software people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re horrible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s such a difficult thing</p>
<p>for them to sort of embrace,</p>
<p>but greatness requires that they embrace this,</p>
<p>embrace whatever is required</p>
<p>to remove the inefficiencies in the system.</p>
<p>And that may require you to do things very differently</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are certain things</p>
<p>that the market can do well.</p>
<p>And this is how I see the world, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to organize certain kinds of activities</p>
<p>is the market and private interest.</p>
<p>But I think we go too far in some areas.</p>
<p>Transportation is,</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t have a public debate about the roads</p>
<p>that we all pay for,</p>
<p>forget about it.</p>
<p>Private factories and all these other,</p>
<p>healthcare and other places,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be way harder there.</p>
<p>Healthcare I guess has some direct contact</p>
<p>with the consumer where we&rsquo;re probably gonna have lots of</p>
<p>sort of hands on public policy</p>
<p>about concerns around patient rights and things like that.</p>
<p>But if we can&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>how to have a public policy conversation</p>
<p>around how technology is gonna reform our public roadways</p>
<p>and our transportation system,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really leaving way too much to private companies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not in there.</p>
<p>I get asked this question, like, what should companies do?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, just go about doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, please come to the table and talk about it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not their role.</p>
<p>I mean, I appreciate Ilan&rsquo;s attempts</p>
<p>to have species level goals,</p>
<p>like, we&rsquo;re gonna go to Mars.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s incredible that someone can realize that,</p>
<p>have a chance at realizing that vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But when it comes to so many areas of our economy,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t wait for a hero.</p>
<p>We have to have,</p>
<p>and there are way too many interests involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s who builds the roads.</p>
<p>I mean, the money that sloshes around on Capitol Hill</p>
<p>to decide what happens in these infrastructure bills</p>
<p>and the transportation bill is just obscene, right?</p>
<p>See, I think it&rsquo;s an interesting view of markets.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, let me propose a theory to you.</p>
<p>That progress in the world is made by heroes</p>
<p>and the markets remove the inefficiencies</p>
<p>from the work the heroes did.</p>
<p>So going to Mars from the perspective of markets</p>
<p>probably has no value.</p>
<p>Maybe you can argue it&rsquo;s good for hiring</p>
<p>to have a vision or something like that,</p>
<p>but like those big projects</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to have an obvious value,</p>
<p>but our world progresses by those big leaps.</p>
<p>And then after the leaps are taken,</p>
<p>then the markets are very good</p>
<p>at removing sort of inefficiencies.</p>
<p>But it just feels like the autonomous vehicle space</p>
<p>and the autonomous trucking space requires leaps.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like we can sneak up into a good solution</p>
<p>that is ultimately good for labor,</p>
<p>like for human beings in the system.</p>
<p>It feels like some, like probably a bad example,</p>
<p>but like a Henry Ford type of character steps in</p>
<p>and say like, we need to do stuff completely differently.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you said we can&rsquo;t hope for a hero,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, no, but we can say we need a hero.</p>
<p>We need more heroes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a young kid right now listening to this,</p>
<p>we need you to be a hero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we need you to start a company</p>
<p>that makes a lot of money, no.</p>
<p>You need to start a company that makes a lot of money</p>
<p>so that you can feed your family</p>
<p>as you become a hero and take huge risks</p>
<p>and potentially go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Those risks is how we move society forward, I think.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a romantic view, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I totally disagree.</p>
<p>You disagree, goddammit.</p>
<p>I mean, I&hellip;</p>
<p>And out of the two of us, you&rsquo;re the knowledgeable one.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No, no, I think it&rsquo;s a matter of like,</p>
<p>do we need those heroes?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I saw the boosters come down from space,</p>
<p>boosters come down from SpaceX&rsquo;s rockets</p>
<p>and land nearly simultaneously with my kids</p>
<p>after school one day.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh my god,</p>
<p>like science fiction has been made real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pinnacle of human achievement, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is what we&rsquo;re capable of.</p>
<p>But we need to have those heroes oriented.</p>
<p>We need to allow them to orient toward the goals, right?</p>
<p>We gotta&hellip;</p>
<p>Climate change, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, all the heroes out there, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The clock is ticking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s past time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on climate change issues</p>
<p>since the mid 90s.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time in 2010</p>
<p>when I got a grant that was completely focused</p>
<p>on adaptation rather than prevention.</p>
<p>And just when it hit me, that like, wow.</p>
<p>So adaptation versus prevention is like acceptance</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be catastrophic impact.</p>
<p>We need to figure out how do we at least live with that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, the grant was like,</p>
<p>okay, our agriculture system is gonna move,</p>
<p>our breadbasket is no longer gonna be California,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be Illinois.</p>
<p>What does that mean for truck transportation?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, so in terms of a big philosophical</p>
<p>societal level, that&rsquo;s kind of like giving up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of the big heroic actions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, failures in human history, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be, let&rsquo;s hope not the biggest, but could be.</p>
<p>Do you&hellip;</p>
<p>So let me say why I disagree, right?</p>
<p>Henry Ford, amazing, right?</p>
<p>To sort of mass produce cars, right?</p>
<p>Daimler to put that first truck on the road</p>
<p>without the roads, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, we need that innovation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And there are rules for that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s big public stuff that sets the stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s critical.</p>
<p>And you know, and what it really is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sociological problem, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a political problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a social problem.</p>
<p>We have to say, and we have these screwed up ideas, right?</p>
<p>So we have this politics right now</p>
<p>where like everybody feels like they&rsquo;re getting screwed</p>
<p>and someone undeserving is benefiting.</p>
<p>When in fact, like, you know, at least in the middle, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re huge.</p>
<p>I used to teach this course in rich and poor,</p>
<p>you know, in economic inequality.</p>
<p>And I would go through public housing subsidies</p>
<p>in Philadelphia, you know, section eight subsidies,</p>
<p>you know, and then I would go through my housing subsidies</p>
<p>for my mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p>And it worked out to basically the average payment</p>
<p>for a section eight housing voucher in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a welfare recipient</p>
<p>according to the dominant discourse.</p>
<p>And so we have this completely screwed up sense</p>
<p>of like where our dollars go and you know,</p>
<p>who benefits from the investment.</p>
<p>And you know, we need to, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we can do it,</p>
<p>but you know, if we&rsquo;re gonna survive,</p>
<p>we need to figure out how to have honest conversations</p>
<p>where private interest is where we need it to be</p>
<p>in fostering innovation and, you know,</p>
<p>and rewarding the people who do incredible things.</p>
<p>Please, you know, we don&rsquo;t wanna squash that,</p>
<p>but we need to harness that power</p>
<p>to solve what I think are some pretty big,</p>
<p>you know, existential problems.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a like government level,</p>
<p>national level collaboration required</p>
<p>for infrastructure project.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, we should really have large moonshot projects</p>
<p>that are funded by our governments.</p>
<p>At least guided by, I mean,</p>
<p>I think there are ways to finance them</p>
<p>and you know, other things,</p>
<p>but we gotta be careful, right?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s where you get all these sort of perverse,</p>
<p>you know, unintended consequences and whatnot.</p>
<p>But if you look at transportation in the United States</p>
<p>and it is the foundation of the, you know,</p>
<p>manifest destiny, economic growth, right?</p>
<p>That built the United States into the world superpower</p>
<p>that it became and the industrial power that it became.</p>
<p>It rested on transportation, right?</p>
<p>It was like, you know, the Erie Canal,</p>
<p>I grew up a few miles from where they dug</p>
<p>the first shovel full of the Erie Canal</p>
<p>and everyone thought it was, you know, crazy, right?</p>
<p>But those public infrastructure projects,</p>
<p>the canals, right, the railroads, yeah,</p>
<p>they were privately built,</p>
<p>but they wouldn&rsquo;t have been privately built without,</p>
<p>you know, Lincoln funding them essentially</p>
<p>and giving, you know, the railroads, you know, land</p>
<p>in exchange for building them.</p>
<p>The highway system, the Eisenhower,</p>
<p>the payback that the US economy got</p>
<p>from the Dwight D. Eisenhower interstate system</p>
<p>is phenomenal, right?</p>
<p>No private entity was gonna do that.</p>
<p>Electrification, dams, water, you know,</p>
<p>we need to do these infrastructure, infrastructure.</p>
<p>And now more than ever, it&rsquo;s been really upsetting to me</p>
<p>on the COVID front.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one of the solutions to COVID,</p>
<p>which seems obvious to me from the very beginning</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s opposed to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the only bipartisan things is at home testing,</p>
<p>rapid at home testing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why at the government level,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t manufacture hundreds of millions of tests</p>
<p>a month.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason starting in May, 2020.</p>
<p>And that gives power to a country that values freedom,</p>
<p>that gives power information to each individual</p>
<p>to know whether they have COVID or not.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to manufacture them for under a dollar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an obvious thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the roads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everybody&rsquo;s invested.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put countless tests in the hands</p>
<p>of every single American citizen,</p>
<p>maybe every citizen of the world.</p>
<p>The fact that we haven&rsquo;t done that today</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some regulation stuff with the FDA,</p>
<p>all the kind of dragging of feet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not actually a good explanation</p>
<p>except our leaders and culturally,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lost the sort of, not lost,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit dormant.</p>
<p>The will to do these big projects that better the world.</p>
<p>I still have the hope that when faced</p>
<p>with catastrophic events, the more dramatic,</p>
<p>the more damaging, the more painful they are,</p>
<p>the higher we will rise to meet those.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the infrastructure style projects</p>
<p>are really important.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly a little bit challenging</p>
<p>to remain an optimist in the times of COVID</p>
<p>because the response of our leaders has not been as great</p>
<p>and as historic as I would have hoped.</p>
<p>I would hope that the actions of leaders</p>
<p>in the past few years in response to COVID</p>
<p>would be ones that are written in the history books.</p>
<p>And we talk about it as we talk about FDR,</p>
<p>but sadly, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think the history books will forget</p>
<p>the actions of our leaders.</p>
<p>So let me just, to wrap up autonomy,</p>
<p>when you look into the future,</p>
<p>are you excited about automation in the space of trucking?</p>
<p>Is it, when you go to bed at night,</p>
<p>do you see a beautiful world in your vision</p>
<p>that involves autonomous trucks?</p>
<p>Like all of the truckers you&rsquo;ve become close with,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked to, do you see a better world for them</p>
<p>because of autonomous trucks?</p>
<p>Damn you, Alex.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Because I mean, I want to be an optimist,</p>
<p>and I want to think of myself, I guess,</p>
<p>as a half glass bowl kind of person.</p>
<p>But when you ask it like that,</p>
<p>and I think about like,</p>
<p>when I look at the challenges to harnessing that for,</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s take just labor and climate, right?</p>
<p>There are other issues,</p>
<p>congestion, et cetera, infrastructure,</p>
<p>that are gonna be affected by this,</p>
<p>again, those big transformational issues.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna take the best of us.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s gonna take the best of our policy approaches.</p>
<p>We need to start investing in building those,</p>
<p>rebuilding those institutions.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen in the last four years, right?</p>
<p>And the erosion of that was so clear</p>
<p>among these truck drivers.</p>
<p>Like when Trump came in and said like,</p>
<p>free trades, good for workers, like, yeah, right.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>I watched factory after factory close.</p>
<p>All of my ancestors worked at the same factory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still holding on by a thread.</p>
<p>Like, the Democratic Party told blue collar workers</p>
<p>for years, I don&rsquo;t worry about free trade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad for you.</p>
<p>And I know the economists will probably</p>
<p>get in the comment box now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look forward to your comments.</p>
<p>Look forward to your comments</p>
<p>about how free trade benefits everybody.</p>
<p>But, you know, immigration, you know, you go,</p>
<p>and I think immigration is great.</p>
<p>The United States benefits from it tremendously, right?</p>
<p>But there are costs, right?</p>
<p>Go down to South Philadelphia and find a drywaller</p>
<p>and tell him that immigration hasn&rsquo;t hurt him, right?</p>
<p>You know, go to these places where there&rsquo;s competition,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And yes, we benefit overall,</p>
<p>but we have a system that allows some people</p>
<p>to pay really high costs.</p>
<p>And Trump tapped into that, you know?</p>
<p>And there was no, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more than that too, obviously.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of really dark stuff</p>
<p>that goes along with it, you know,</p>
<p>the sort of racialization of others and things like that.</p>
<p>But he hit on those core, you know, issues that, you know,</p>
<p>if you were to go back over my trucking interviews</p>
<p>for 15 years, you would have heard those stories</p>
<p>over and over and over again, that sense of voicelessness,</p>
<p>that sense of powerlessness,</p>
<p>that sense that there&rsquo;s no difference</p>
<p>between the Democrats and the Republicans</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all gonna screw us over.</p>
<p>And that was there, you know?</p>
<p>And you just ignore it as long as you want</p>
<p>and tell people, don&rsquo;t worry, trade&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, immigration&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>As their communities lose factories.</p>
<p>And I mean, a lot of them were lost to the South</p>
<p>before they were lost to overseas, whatever,</p>
<p>but tapped into that, you know?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a fundamental distrust of,</p>
<p>you know, you look at these like pupils on like,</p>
<p>you know, whether people trust the media, right?</p>
<p>But whether or not they trust higher education, you know,</p>
<p>these institutions that I find magical, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you look at the vaccine research and stuff,</p>
<p>that, you know, just, you know, brilliant, you know,</p>
<p>people doing incredible things for humanity.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the idea that like, you know,</p>
<p>we can take these viruses that, you know,</p>
<p>used to ravage through the human population</p>
<p>that we had to be terrified of.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve suffered, but, you know,</p>
<p>we have such power now to defend ourselves, right?</p>
<p>Behind these programs, right?</p>
<p>And to see those, people would be like,</p>
<p>eh, I&rsquo;m not sure if higher education&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for the country or not, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>where are we, you know?</p>
<p>So we need to rebuild the faith and trust</p>
<p>in those institutions and have these,</p>
<p>but we need to have honest conversations</p>
<p>before people are gonna buy it, you know?</p>
<p>Do you have ideas for rebuilding the trust</p>
<p>and giving a voice to the voices?</p>
<p>So is the, many of the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>is so sort of deeply integrated.</p>
<p>You think like, this is the trouble I have</p>
<p>with people that work on AI and autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and so on, it&rsquo;s not just a technology problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this human pain problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the robot essentially silencing the voice</p>
<p>of a human being because it&rsquo;s lowering their wage,</p>
<p>making them suffer more and giving them no tools</p>
<p>of how to escape that suffering.</p>
<p>Is there something, I mean, it even gets</p>
<p>into the question of meaning, you know?</p>
<p>So if money is one thing, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>what makes us happy in life.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of those truckers,</p>
<p>the set of jobs they&rsquo;ve had in their life</p>
<p>were defining to them as human beings.</p>
<p>And so, and the question with automation</p>
<p>is not just how do we have a job that gives you money</p>
<p>to feed your family, but also a job that gives you meaning,</p>
<p>that gives you pride.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for me, the hope is that AI and automation</p>
<p>will provide other jobs that will be a source of meaning.</p>
<p>But coupled with that hope is that there will not</p>
<p>be too much suffering in the transition.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not obvious from the people you&rsquo;ve spoken with.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we need to differentiate</p>
<p>between the effects of technology</p>
<p>and the effects of capitalism, right?</p>
<p>And they are, you know, the fact that workers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a lot of power, right, in the system matters.</p>
<p>Now, we had a system, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I would say, you know,</p>
<p>go to that, you know, Harry Bridges report.</p>
<p>And, you know, those were workers who had a sense of power.</p>
<p>They said, you know what, we can demand</p>
<p>some of the benefits, like, yeah, automate our jobs away,</p>
<p>but, you know, kick a little down to us, right?</p>
<p>And we had, in the golden era of American industrialism</p>
<p>in post World War II, that was the contract.</p>
<p>The contract was employers can do what they want</p>
<p>in automation and all these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, there&rsquo;s some union rules</p>
<p>that make things less efficient in places,</p>
<p>but the key compromise is tie wages to productivity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>We tied, that&rsquo;s what unions did.</p>
<p>They tied wages to productivity, kept demand up, right?</p>
<p>It was good for the economy, some economists think, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, you know, we need to,</p>
<p>I think we need to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s technology in a social context</p>
<p>in which some people have a lot of power</p>
<p>to determine what happens.</p>
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t have all the answers,</p>
<p>but I know what my answer is.</p>
<p>And my answer is, and I think I started with this, you know,</p>
<p>I can learn from every single person, you know?</p>
<p>Did I have to talk to the 200th truck driver?</p>
<p>In my opinion, yes, because I was gonna learn something</p>
<p>from that 200th truck driver.</p>
<p>Now, people with more power might talk to none,</p>
<p>or they might talk to five and say, okay, I got it.</p>
<p>You know, people are amazing</p>
<p>and every one of them has a life experience</p>
<p>and concerns and, you know, can teach us something.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not in the conversation, you know?</p>
<p>And I know this because I&rsquo;m the expert, you know?</p>
<p>So I get pulled in to these conversations</p>
<p>and people wanna know, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen to labor, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, so I try to be a sounding board</p>
<p>and I feel a tremendous weight of responsibility,</p>
<p>you know, for that.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;m not those workers, you know?</p>
<p>And they may listen to this or, you know,</p>
<p>walk in the door sometime, it&rsquo;s about to be like,</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s full of shit, that&rsquo;s not what I think at all.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t get heard over and over and over.</p>
<p>But in a small way, you are providing a voice to them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of the, if at scale,</p>
<p>we apply that empathy and listening,</p>
<p>that we could provide the voice to the voiceless</p>
<p>through our votes, through our money, through,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one way to make capitalism work</p>
<p>at not making the powerless more powerless,</p>
<p>is by all of us being a community</p>
<p>that listens to the pain of others</p>
<p>and tries to minimize that,</p>
<p>to try to give a voice to the voiceless,</p>
<p>to give power to the powerless.</p>
<p>I have to ask you on, by way of advice,</p>
<p>young people, high school students, college students,</p>
<p>entering this world full of automation,</p>
<p>full of these complex labor markets and markets period,</p>
<p>what would you, what kind of advice would you give</p>
<p>to that person about how to have a career?</p>
<p>How to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, you know, this is such a great question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s okay to quote Steve Jobs, right?</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so, and I just heard this recently.</p>
<p>It was a commencement speech that he gave</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t remember where it was.</p>
<p>And he was talking about, you know,</p>
<p>he had famously dropped out of school,</p>
<p>but continued to take classes, right?</p>
<p>And he took a calligraphy class</p>
<p>that influenced the design of the Mac and sort of fonts.</p>
<p>And, you know, just was something that he had no,</p>
<p>you know, sense of what it was gonna be useful for.</p>
<p>And his lesson was, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward.</p>
<p>You know, looking back, you can see all the pieces</p>
<p>that sort of led you to where you ended up.</p>
<p>And for me, studying truck driving,</p>
<p>like, I mean, I literally went to graduate school</p>
<p>because I was worried about climate change.</p>
<p>And like, you know, I had a whole other dissertation plan</p>
<p>and then was like driving home.</p>
<p>And like, I had read about all this management literature</p>
<p>and sort of like how you get workers to work hard</p>
<p>for my qualifying exams.</p>
<p>And then read a popular article</p>
<p>on satellite linked computers.</p>
<p>And the story in the literature was,</p>
<p>you know, a sense of autonomy.</p>
<p>And I was like, well,</p>
<p>that monitoring must affect the sense of autonomy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just this question that I found interesting.</p>
<p>And it never in a million years</p>
<p>that I ever thought I was gonna like study, you know,</p>
<p>spend 15 years of my life studying truck driving.</p>
<p>And it was like, if you were to map out a career path</p>
<p>in academia or research, like, you know,</p>
<p>you would do none of the things that I did</p>
<p>that many people advise me against.</p>
<p>Where like, you can&rsquo;t like go spend a year</p>
<p>working as a truck driver, you know, like that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Or, you know, you can&rsquo;t, you know, spend all this time</p>
<p>trying to write like one huge book and, you know.</p>
<p>But by the way, if I could just interrupt,</p>
<p>what was the fire that got you to take the leap</p>
<p>and go and work as a truck driver</p>
<p>and go interview truck drivers?</p>
<p>This is what a lot of people would be incapable of doing,</p>
<p>just took that leap.</p>
<p>What the heck is up with your mind</p>
<p>that allowed you to take that big leap?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s probably like Tolkien.</p>
<p>And Lord of the Rings, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think as a teenager, you know,</p>
<p>I sort of adopted some sense of needing to, you know,</p>
<p>heroically go out in the world and, you know,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve done at various points in my life</p>
<p>and like looking back in absolutely stupid ways</p>
<p>that, you know, where I could have completely,</p>
<p>I ended up dead and traumatized my family,</p>
<p>including like, I took a couple week trip in the Pacific,</p>
<p>like a solo trip on a kayak.</p>
<p>And basically my kayak experience up till that, you know,</p>
<p>point had been, you know, on a fairly calm lake</p>
<p>and like class one rapids on a river.</p>
<p>Solo trip on a kayak in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was working on forestry issues</p>
<p>and we were starting a campaign</p>
<p>up in really remote British Columbia.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, if I&rsquo;m gonna work on this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to actually go there myself</p>
<p>and see what this is all about</p>
<p>and see whether it&rsquo;s worth like devoting my sort of,</p>
<p>you know, life right now too.</p>
<p>And just drove up there with this kayak</p>
<p>and, you know, put into the Pacific and it was insane.</p>
<p>You know, like the tides are huge</p>
<p>and, you know, there was one point</p>
<p>in which I was going down a fjord</p>
<p>and two fjords kind of came up and there was a cross channel</p>
<p>and I had hit the timing completely wrong</p>
<p>and the tide was sort of rushing up like, you know,</p>
<p>rivers in these, you know, two fjords</p>
<p>and then coming through this cross channel and met</p>
<p>and created this giant standing wave</p>
<p>that I had to paddle through.</p>
<p>And now actually very recently,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone out on whitewater with some people</p>
<p>who know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and I realized like just how absolutely stupid</p>
<p>and, you know, ill fit I was,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just, I think I&rsquo;ve always had that.</p>
<p>Were you afraid when you had that wave before you?</p>
<p>That wave scared the shit out of me, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, what about taking a leap and becoming a trucker?</p>
<p>Yeah, there was some nervousness for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, and, you know, I guess my advantage</p>
<p>as an ethnographer is I grew up in a blue collar environment.</p>
<p>You know, again, all my ancestors were factory workers.</p>
<p>So I can move through spaces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really, I feel, I can become comfortable</p>
<p>in lots and lots of places, you know, not everywhere,</p>
<p>but, you know, along class lines for sort of white,</p>
<p>you know, even white ethnic workers,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I can move in those spaces fairly easily.</p>
<p>I mean, not entirely, there was one time</p>
<p>where I was like, okay, you know,</p>
<p>and I grew up around people who worked on cars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been to drag races in NASCAR</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d been to, you know, Colgate University.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d, and I think that was probably</p>
<p>my initial training was, you know,</p>
<p>being this just working class kid who ends up in this,</p>
<p>you know, sort of blue blood, small liberal arts college</p>
<p>and just feeling like, you know,</p>
<p>both having the entire world opened up to me,</p>
<p>like philosophy and Buddhism</p>
<p>and things that I had never heard of, you know,</p>
<p>and just became totally obsessed with</p>
<p>and just like, you know, just following my interests.</p>
<p>But also culturally perhaps didn&rsquo;t feel like you fit in.</p>
<p>Feeling like just a fish out of water.</p>
<p>I just, you know, but, and at the same time</p>
<p>that sort of drove me in the sense</p>
<p>that it drove an opening of my mind</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>You know, I was like, I didn&rsquo;t know that this world existed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I think maybe that&rsquo;s where my real first step</p>
<p>in trying to understand other people</p>
<p>because they were my friends, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, they were my teammates.</p>
<p>I played lacrosse in college.</p>
<p>So like, you know, I was close to people</p>
<p>who came from such different backgrounds than I did.</p>
<p>And I just, I was so confused, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think I learned to learn</p>
<p>and then, you know, sort of went from there.</p>
<p>And then develop your fascination with people.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is you went from trucking now</p>
<p>to autonomous trucks.</p>
<p>I mean, this is speaking of not being able</p>
<p>to connect the dots and, you know,</p>
<p>your life in the next 10 years</p>
<p>could take very interesting directions</p>
<p>that are very difficult to,</p>
<p>first of all, us meeting is a funny little thing</p>
<p>given the things I&rsquo;m working on with robots currently.</p>
<p>But, you know, it may not relate to trucks at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, at a certain point,</p>
<p>autonomous trucks are just robots.</p>
<p>And then it starts getting into a conversation</p>
<p>about the roles of robots in society.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the roles of humans and robots.</p>
<p>And that interplay is right up your alley.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As somebody who deeply cares about humans</p>
<p>and have somehow found themselves studying robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, even four or five years ago,</p>
<p>I would, if you had asked me</p>
<p>if I was gonna be studying trucking still,</p>
<p>I would have said no.</p>
<p>And so my advice is, I think if I was gonna give advice,</p>
<p>you know, is, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward.</p>
<p>You just gotta follow what interests you, you know?</p>
<p>And I think we downplay, right,</p>
<p>that when we talk to, you know, kids,</p>
<p>especially, you know, if you have some bright gifted kid</p>
<p>that gets identified as like, oh, you could go somewhere.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re like, we feed them stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ll learn the piano</p>
<p>and learn another language, right?</p>
<p>Or learn robotics.</p>
<p>And then we tell other kids like,</p>
<p>oh, learn a trade, you know,</p>
<p>like figure out what&rsquo;s gonna pay well.</p>
<p>And not that there&rsquo;s anything against trades.</p>
<p>I think everyone should learn like manual skills</p>
<p>to make things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredibly satisfying and wonderful,</p>
<p>and we need more of that.</p>
<p>But also, you know, tell, you know, all kids,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to like take a class in something random</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>any economic return on.</p>
<p>Well, because maybe you will end up going into a trade,</p>
<p>but that class that you took in studio art</p>
<p>is gonna mean that, you know,</p>
<p>you look at buildings differently, right?</p>
<p>Or you end up sort of putting your own stamp on,</p>
<p>you know, woodworking, you know?</p>
<p>It just, I think that&rsquo;s the key is like,</p>
<p>follow, you know, it&rsquo;s cheesy</p>
<p>because everybody says, follow your passion.</p>
<p>But you know, we say that, and then we just, you know,</p>
<p>the 90% of what people hear is, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the return on investment for that, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re a human being.</p>
<p>Like things interest you, music interests you,</p>
<p>literature interests you, video games interests you,</p>
<p>like follow it, you know?</p>
<p>Go grab a kayak and go into the pool.</p>
<p>Go do something really, no, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Go do something stupid and something you&rsquo;ll regret</p>
<p>a lot later.</p>
<p>My poor mother, thank God she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, because for a lot of people work,</p>
<p>for me it is, quote unquote, work is a source of meaning.</p>
<p>And at the core of something we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>with jobs is meaning.</p>
<p>So the big ridiculous question,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Do you think work for us humans in modern society</p>
<p>is as core to that meaning?</p>
<p>Is that something you think about in your work?</p>
<p>So the deeper question of meaning,</p>
<p>not just financial wellbeing and the quality of life,</p>
<p>but the deeper search for meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah, the meaning of life is love</p>
<p>and you can find love in your work.</p>
<p>Now, and I don&rsquo;t think everybody can.</p>
<p>There are a lot of jobs out there that just, you know,</p>
<p>you do it for a paycheck.</p>
<p>And I think we do have to be honest about that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who don&rsquo;t love their jobs</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have jobs that they&rsquo;re gonna love.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s not a sort of realistic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a utopia, right?</p>
<p>But for those of us that have the luxury,</p>
<p>I mean, I think you love what you do that people say that.</p>
<p>I think the key for real happiness</p>
<p>is to love what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>and maybe love trying to build a company</p>
<p>and make a lot of money just for the sake of doing that.</p>
<p>But I think the people who are really happy</p>
<p>and have great impacts, they love what they do</p>
<p>because it has an impact on the world</p>
<p>that they think is, it expresses that love, right?</p>
<p>And that could be at a counseling center,</p>
<p>that could be in your community,</p>
<p>that could be sending people to Mars, you know.</p>
<p>Well, I also think it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>the expression of love isn&rsquo;t necessary</p>
<p>about helping other people directly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about craftsmanship and skill</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re celebrating humanity</p>
<p>by like searching for mastery in the task,</p>
<p>in the simple, like, especially tasks that people outside me</p>
<p>see as menial, as not important.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, searching for mastery,</p>
<p>for excellence in that task.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply human to that</p>
<p>and also fulfilling that just like driving a truck</p>
<p>and getting damn good at it.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the best who&rsquo;s ever lived</p>
<p>and driving the truck and taking pride in that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply meaningful.</p>
<p>And also like a real celebration of humanity</p>
<p>and a real show of love, I think, for humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just had my floors redone</p>
<p>and the guy who did it was an artist.</p>
<p>You know, he sanded these old 100 year old floors</p>
<p>and made them look gorgeous and this is craft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s love right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he showed us some love.</p>
<p>The product was just like, is enriching our lives.</p>
<p>Steve, this was an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground, your work,</p>
<p>just like you said, impossible to connect the dots,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad you did all the amazing work you did.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exploring human nature at the core</p>
<p>of what America is, the blue collar America.</p>
<p>So thank you for your work.</p>
<p>Thank you for the care and the love you put in your work.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan, so it&rsquo;s just been great to be on.</p>

<p>from Napoleon Hill.</p>
<p>If you cannot do great things,</p>
<p>do small things in a great way.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
