    <p>The following is a conversation with Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>a venture capitalist and engineer,</p>
<p>founder and CEO of Social Capital,</p>
<p>previously an early senior executive at Facebook,</p>
<p>and is the co-host of the All In podcast,</p>
<p>a podcast that I highly recommend for the wisdom</p>
<p>and the camaraderie of the four co-hosts,</p>
<p>also known as besties.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Bambi for HR services,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>NetSuite for business management software,</p>
<p>SimpliSafe for home security,</p>
<p>and indeed for hiring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a new sponsor</p>
<p>called Bambi,</p>
<p>an outsourced and automated human resources,</p>
<p>HR solution for businesses.</p>
<p>I think in the video on their website,</p>
<p>it says that many businesses would need to hire</p>
<p>an HR person,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like 70K a year plus.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re offering is super cost effective</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just 99 bucks per month,</p>
<p>and they take care of the HR compliance</p>
<p>and all the complexities involved with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to hire people</p>
<p>that can take care of human resources.</p>
<p>HR is one of those things that when done poorly,</p>
<p>it can really hurt.</p>
<p>And when done well,</p>
<p>it just makes everything work beautifully.</p>
<p>And so you should use the best tools for the job,</p>
<p>and a really cost effective one is Bambi.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think of the human body</p>
<p>as just a source of signals.</p>
<p>You got a hierarchy of living organisms,</p>
<p>millions of them, billions of them,</p>
<p>depending how you define the atomic organisms</p>
<p>that make up the human body.</p>
<p>And so all of them are sending signals,</p>
<p>tiny signals, big signals,</p>
<p>and all of those that conglomerate,</p>
<p>that orchestra sends just a huge amount of data,</p>
<p>which is used by the brain and the nervous system</p>
<p>and the immune system and all the different systems</p>
<p>that make up the anatomy and the physiology of the body</p>
<p>to sort of coordinate everything.</p>
<p>And for us to plug in and collect some of that data</p>
<p>in order to make lifestyle and health recommendations,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the future.</p>
<p>Recommendations should be done based primarily on your body,</p>
<p>grounded, of course, in the wisdom</p>
<p>that science provides for the population.</p>
<p>Anyway, InsideTracker is a step into that direction.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by NetSuite,</p>
<p>an all-in-one cloud business management system.</p>
<p>They manage financials, inventory, e-commerce,</p>
<p>all the different business-related details.</p>
<p>The Ed Reads today,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s on the Chamath episode,</p>
<p>and Chamath is one of the greatest business leaders</p>
<p>and minds and investors and VCs and technologists,</p>
<p>engineers, and just intellectuals, honestly,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever listened to</p>
<p>and gotten a chance to interact with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really a brilliant guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, just first principles thinker, bold thinker.</p>
<p>Even when he&rsquo;s wrong, he&rsquo;ll push forward</p>
<p>and then realize through first principles</p>
<p>thinking that he&rsquo;s wrong and he&rsquo;ll admit it.</p>
<p>I mean, just really honest, brilliant person.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s funny that on this episode,</p>
<p>we got all kinds of business-related advertisers,</p>
<p>and I think that makes perfect sense, and that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>because running a business is not just</p>
<p>about great leadership or about hiring a great team.</p>
<p>All those are obviously exceptionally important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also running and taking care of all the glue</p>
<p>that ties everything together.</p>
<p>So that means human resources,</p>
<p>but that also means managing the inventory, the e-commerce,</p>
<p>managing all the financial stuff,</p>
<p>automating everything that you can automate,</p>
<p>making it easy, efficient, using the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where NetSuite fits in.</p>
<p>Go to netsuite.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to access their one-of-a-kind financing program.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by SimpliSafe,</p>
<p>a home security company designed to be simple and effective.</p>
<p>It took me no time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how long it was, maybe 30 minutes,</p>
<p>maybe less, I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>but they say it takes you 30 minutes to set up.</p>
<p>You can customize the system for your needs.</p>
<p>I have it set up in my place.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first layer of physical security to my place.</p>
<p>I have many layers of physical and cyber,</p>
<p>digital, emotional, psychological security,</p>
<p>although probably the biggest vulnerabilities to me</p>
<p>is psychological security</p>
<p>because I really try to wear my heart on my sleeve</p>
<p>and really take the world in,</p>
<p>the opinion of the world,</p>
<p>the pain of the world, the struggle of the world,</p>
<p>and not in the way where I want the approval of the world.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I want to empathize with the experience of others</p>
<p>and understand it.</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>what you find is your mind can be hacked.</p>
<p>This complicated psychological landscape to operate in</p>
<p>is so tricky,</p>
<p>but of course,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way more complicated than physical security.</p>
<p>Physical security should be taken care of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the smart thing to do.</p>
<p>You should use a simple system for that,</p>
<p>an effective system,</p>
<p>easy to set up, easy to use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what SimpliSafe is.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>Like I told you, Chamath episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking all about business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just to me,</p>
<p>but I think the most important thing for successful business</p>
<p>is building a great team.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also the most important thing</p>
<p>for your own personal happiness and growth</p>
<p>and psychological flourishing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the process of hiring,</p>
<p>the early stage of selecting a great pool of candidates</p>
<p>quickly,</p>
<p>then from those candidates,</p>
<p>selecting it down to a good fit,</p>
<p>good resume, good skill,</p>
<p>good personality, diversity,</p>
<p>all those elements that make up a great team.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a stepwise process that&rsquo;s really painful,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really difficult to turn into a science.</p>
<p>I really do think it&rsquo;s part art, part science,</p>
<p>just like conversation.</p>
<p>And whatever can be made easier,</p>
<p>more efficient, more organized,</p>
<p>you should do.</p>
<p>Indeed does that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>They have an instant match tool</p>
<p>that does that first step of finding</p>
<p>the set of candidates that fit the job description.</p>
<p>They do that immediately.</p>
<p>Anyway, they have a special offer</p>
<p>only available for a limited time.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Chamath Balahapatiya.</p>
<p>You grew up in a dysfunctional household on welfare.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>What were for you personally, psychologically,</p>
<p>some difficult moments in your childhood?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer that question in a slightly different way,</p>
<p>which is that I think when you grow up</p>
<p>in a household that&rsquo;s defined by physical abuse</p>
<p>and psychological abuse,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hypervigilant all the time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s actually easier for me to point to moments</p>
<p>where I was happy,</p>
<p>or I felt compassion,</p>
<p>or I felt safe.</p>
<p>Otherwise, every moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Like, I was thinking about this a while ago.</p>
<p>There was a tree outside of my apartment</p>
<p>where we lived when I was growing up.</p>
<p>And my father would sometimes would make me go outside</p>
<p>to take the tree branch that he would hit me with.</p>
<p>And so you can imagine if you&rsquo;re a 10, 11-year-old kid</p>
<p>and you have to deal with that, what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, a hypervigilant child learns</p>
<p>how to basically estimate the strength of these branches.</p>
<p>How far can he go before it breaks?</p>
<p>You have to estimate his anger</p>
<p>and estimate the effective strength of branches</p>
<p>and bring back something.</p>
<p>Because I remember these moments where if it was,</p>
<p>he would look at it and then he would make me go out again</p>
<p>and get it, get a different one.</p>
<p>Or there was a certain belt that he wore</p>
<p>that had this kind of belt buckle that stuck out.</p>
<p>And you just wanted to make sure</p>
<p>if that was the thing that you were gonna get hit by,</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t the buckle facing out</p>
<p>because that really hurt.</p>
<p>And so you became hyper aware</p>
<p>of which part of the buckle was facing out</p>
<p>versus facing in in those moments.</p>
<p>And there are like hundreds of these little examples,</p>
<p>which essentially I would say the through line</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re just so on edge, right?</p>
<p>And you walk into this house</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just basically trying to get to the point</p>
<p>where you leave the house.</p>
<p>And so in that microcosm of growing up,</p>
<p>any moment that&rsquo;s not like that is seared in my memory</p>
<p>in a way that I just can&rsquo;t describe to a person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>I volunteered when I was in grade five or six,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember which it was,</p>
<p>in the kindergarten of my school.</p>
<p>And I would just go and the teacher would</p>
<p>ask you to clean things up.</p>
<p>And at the end of that grade five year,</p>
<p>she took me and two other kids to Dairy Queen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d never gone to a restaurant, literally,</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
<p>And I remember the first time I tasted this</p>
<p>Dairy Queen meal, it was like a hamburger, fries,</p>
<p>and a Coke, and a Blizzard.</p>
<p>And I was like, what is this?</p>
<p>And I felt so special, because you&rsquo;re getting something</p>
<p>that most people would take for granted.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a Sunday, or I&rsquo;m really busy,</p>
<p>let me go take my kid to fast food.</p>
<p>I think that until I left high school,</p>
<p>I think, and this is not just specific to me,</p>
<p>but a lot of other people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re in this hypervigilant loop,</p>
<p>punctuated with these incredibly visceral moments</p>
<p>of compassion by other people.</p>
<p>A different example, we had such a strict budget,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t have a car.</p>
<p>And so, I was responsible with my mom</p>
<p>to always go shopping.</p>
<p>And so I learned very early on how to look for coupons,</p>
<p>how to buy things that were on sale or special.</p>
<p>And we had a very basic diet,</p>
<p>because you have to budget this thing really precisely.</p>
<p>But the end of every year where I lived,</p>
<p>there was a large grocery chain called Loblaws.</p>
<p>And Loblaws would discount a cheesecake</p>
<p>from 7.99 to 4.99.</p>
<p>And my parents would buy that once a year.</p>
<p>And we probably did that six or seven times.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t imagine how special we felt.</p>
<p>Myself, my two sisters, we would sit there,</p>
<p>we would watch the New Year&rsquo;s Eve celebration on TV,</p>
<p>we would cut this cheesecake into five pieces.</p>
<p>It felt like everything.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of how my existence</p>
<p>when I was at that age is,</p>
<p>for better or for worse, that&rsquo;s how I remember it.</p>
<p>The hyper-vigilance loop, is that still with you today?</p>
<p>What are the echoes of that that&rsquo;s still with you today,</p>
<p>the good and the bad?</p>
<p>If you put yourself in the mind of a young child,</p>
<p>the thing that that does to you</p>
<p>is at a very core basic level, it says you&rsquo;re worthless.</p>
<p>Because if you can step outside of that</p>
<p>and you think about any child in the world,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t deserve to go through that.</p>
<p>And at some point, by the way, I should tell you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame my parents anymore.</p>
<p>It was a process to get there,</p>
<p>but I feel like they did the best they could.</p>
<p>And they suffered their own issues</p>
<p>and enormous pressures and stresses.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve really, for the most part, forgiven them.</p>
<p>How did you, sorry to interrupt, let go of that blame?</p>
<p>That was a really long process where for,</p>
<p>I would say the first 35 years of my life,</p>
<p>I compartmentalized and I avoided all of those memories.</p>
<p>And I sought external validation.</p>
<p>Right, going back to this self-worth idea.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re taught as a child that you&rsquo;re worthless,</p>
<p>because why would somebody do these things to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re worth something,</p>
<p>you think to yourself, very viscerally, you&rsquo;re worth nothing.</p>
<p>And so then you go out and you seek external validation.</p>
<p>Maybe you try to go and get into a great college.</p>
<p>You try to get a good job.</p>
<p>You try to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>You try to demonstrate in superficial ways</p>
<p>with the car you drive or the clothes you wear</p>
<p>that you deserve people to care about you,</p>
<p>to try to make up for that really deep hole.</p>
<p>But at some point, it doesn&rsquo;t get filled in.</p>
<p>And so you have a choice.</p>
<p>And so for me, what happened was</p>
<p>in the course of a six month period,</p>
<p>I lost my best friend and I lost my father.</p>
<p>And it was really like the dam broke loose</p>
<p>because the compartmentalization stopped working</p>
<p>because the reminder</p>
<p>of why I was compartmentalizing was gone.</p>
<p>And so I had to go through this period of disharmony</p>
<p>to really understand and steel man his perspective.</p>
<p>And can you imagine trying to do that,</p>
<p>to go through all of the things</p>
<p>where you have to now look at it from his perspective</p>
<p>and find compassion and empathy for what he went through?</p>
<p>And then I shift the focus to my mom.</p>
<p>And I said, well, you were not the victim, actually.</p>
<p>You were somewhat complicit as well</p>
<p>because you were of sound mind and body</p>
<p>and you were in the room when it happened.</p>
<p>So then I had to go through that process with her</p>
<p>and steel man her perspective.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, I never justified what they did,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been able to forgive what they did.</p>
<p>I think they did the best they could.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>they did the most important thing,</p>
<p>which is they gave me and my sisters a shot</p>
<p>by emigrating, by giving up everything,</p>
<p>by staying in Canada</p>
<p>and doing whatever it took between the two of them</p>
<p>to sort of claw and scrape together enough money to live</p>
<p>so that my sisters and I could have a shot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very thankful for them.</p>
<p>Could they have done better?</p>
<p>Obviously, but I&rsquo;m okay with what has taken place.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been a long process of that steel manning</p>
<p>so that you can develop some empathy</p>
<p>and compassion and forgive.</p>
<p>Do you think if you talk to your dad</p>
<p>shortly after he died and you went through that process,</p>
<p>or today, you&rsquo;ll be able to have the same strength</p>
<p>to forgive him?</p>
<p>I think it would be a very complicated journey.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve learned to be incredibly open</p>
<p>about what has happened</p>
<p>and all of the mistakes I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>I think it would require him to be pretty radically honest</p>
<p>about confirming what I think he went through</p>
<p>because otherwise it just wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Otherwise I would say, let&rsquo;s keep things where they are,</p>
<p>which is I did the work with people that have helped me,</p>
<p>obviously, but it&rsquo;s better for him to just,</p>
<p>kind of hopefully he&rsquo;s looking from some place</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s thinking it was worth it.</p>
<p>I think he deserves to think that all of this,</p>
<p>because I think the immigrant challenge,</p>
<p>not even the immigrant challenge,</p>
<p>the lower middle class challenge,</p>
<p>anybody who really wants better for their kids</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have a good toolkit to give it to them,</p>
<p>some of them just, they choke up on the bat.</p>
<p>They just get so agitated about this idea</p>
<p>that all this sacrifice will not be worth it,</p>
<p>that it spills out in really unproductive ways.</p>
<p>And I would put him in that category.</p>
<p>And their self-evaluation, introspection,</p>
<p>they have tunnel vision,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not able to often see the damage that did.</p>
<p>I mean, I know, like yourself, a few successful people</p>
<p>that had very difficult relationships with their dad.</p>
<p>And when you take the perspective of the dad,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely in denial about any of it.</p>
<p>So if you actually have a conversation,</p>
<p>there would not be a deep honesty there.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s maybe in part the way of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I remember pretty distinctly after I left</p>
<p>and in my middle 30s, where by all measure,</p>
<p>I had roughly become reasonably successful.</p>
<p>And my dad didn&rsquo;t particularly care about that,</p>
<p>which was so odd because I had to confront the fact</p>
<p>that whether it was a title or money or press clippings,</p>
<p>he never really cared.</p>
<p>He moved on to a different set of goals,</p>
<p>which was more about my character</p>
<p>and being a good person to my family</p>
<p>and really preparing me to lead our family</p>
<p>when he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And that bothered me because I thought I got</p>
<p>to the finish line and I thought there was going to be</p>
<p>a medal, meaning like, I can tell you, Lex,</p>
<p>he never told me that he loved me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s normal or not.</p>
<p>It was my normality.</p>
<p>And I thought there&rsquo;s gonna be something, some gold star,</p>
<p>which never appeared.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s like a hard thing to kind of confront</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, well, now what is this all about?</p>
<p>Was this all just kind of a ruse?</p>
<p>But then I realized, well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>There were these moments where in his way,</p>
<p>again, putting yourself in his shoes,</p>
<p>I think he was trying to say he was sorry.</p>
<p>He would hold my hand and he would interlock the fingers,</p>
<p>which I felt is, that&rsquo;s a really intimate way</p>
<p>of holding somebody&rsquo;s hand, I think.</p>
<p>So I remember those things.</p>
<p>So these are the things that are just etched in,</p>
<p>at least in my mind.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, I think I&rsquo;ve done a decent job</p>
<p>in repairing my relationship with him,</p>
<p>even though it was posthumous.</p>
<p>It does make me wonder in which way you and I,</p>
<p>we might be broken and not see it.</p>
<p>It might be hurting others and not see it.</p>
<p>Well, I think that when you grew up</p>
<p>in those kinds of environments,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all different kinds of this kind of dysfunction,</p>
<p>but if what you get from that is that you&rsquo;re not worthwhile,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re less than many, many other people,</p>
<p>when you enter adulthood or semi-adulthood</p>
<p>in your early 20s, you will be in a cycle</p>
<p>where you are hurting other people.</p>
<p>You may not know it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find somebody who holds you accountable</p>
<p>and tells you and loves you enough through that.</p>
<p>But you are going to take all of that disharmony</p>
<p>in your childhood and you&rsquo;re gonna inject that disharmony</p>
<p>into whether it&rsquo;s your professional relationships</p>
<p>or your personal relationships or both</p>
<p>until you get to some form of rock bottom</p>
<p>and you start to repair.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people that resonate with that</p>
<p>because they have each suffered their own things</p>
<p>that at some point in their lives have told them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re less than.</p>
<p>And then they go and cope.</p>
<p>And when you cope, eventually those coping mechanisms</p>
<p>escalate and at some point it&rsquo;ll be unhealthy,</p>
<p>either for you, but oftentimes it&rsquo;s for the people</p>
<p>around you.</p>
<p>Well, from those humble beginnings,</p>
<p>you are now a billionaire.</p>
<p>How has money changed your life</p>
<p>or maybe the landscape of experience in your life?</p>
<p>Does it buy happiness?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness,</p>
<p>but it buys you a level of comfort</p>
<p>for you to really amplify what happiness is.</p>
<p>I kind of think about it in the following way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that there&rsquo;s a hundred things on a table</p>
<p>and the table says, find happiness here.</p>
<p>And there are different prices.</p>
<p>The way that the world works</p>
<p>is that many of these experiences are cordoned off</p>
<p>a little bit behind the velvet rope,</p>
<p>where you think that there&rsquo;s more happiness</p>
<p>as the prices of things escalate.</p>
<p>If you live in an apartment,</p>
<p>you admire the person with the house.</p>
<p>If you live in a house,</p>
<p>you admire the person with the bigger house.</p>
<p>That person admires the person with an island.</p>
<p>Some person drives their car,</p>
<p>admires the person who flies,</p>
<p>who admires the person who flies business class,</p>
<p>who admires the person who flies first to private.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all of these escalations on this table.</p>
<p>And most people get to the first five or six.</p>
<p>And so they just naturally assume that items seven</p>
<p>through a hundred is really where happiness is found.</p>
<p>And just to tell you the finish line,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a hundred and back</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tried two more hundred to it.</p>
<p>And happiness isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>But it does give you a level of comfort.</p>
<p>I read a study and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>but it said that the absolute sort of like maximal link</p>
<p>between money and happiness is around $50 million.</p>
<p>And it was just like a social studies kind of thing</p>
<p>that I think one of the Ivy Leagues put out.</p>
<p>And underneath it, the way that they explained it</p>
<p>was because you could have a home,</p>
<p>you could have all kinds of the creature comforts,</p>
<p>you could take care of your family,</p>
<p>and then you were left to ponder</p>
<p>what it is that you really want.</p>
<p>I think the challenge for most people is to realize</p>
<p>that this escalating arms race of more things</p>
<p>will solve your problems is not true.</p>
<p>More and better is not the solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that you are on a very precise journey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unique to yourself.</p>
<p>You are playing a game of which only you are the player.</p>
<p>Everybody else is an interloper.</p>
<p>And you have a responsibility to design the gameplay.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>because if they did,</p>
<p>I think they would make a lot of different decisions</p>
<p>about how they live their life.</p>
<p>And I still do the same thing.</p>
<p>I mean revert to basically running around</p>
<p>asking other people, what will make you like me more?</p>
<p>What will make me more popular in your eyes?</p>
<p>And I try to do it, and it never works.</p>
<p>It is just a complete dead end.</p>
<p>Is there negative aspects to money?</p>
<p>Like for example, it becoming harder</p>
<p>to find people you can trust?</p>
<p>I think the most negative aspect is that it amplifies</p>
<p>a 360 degree view of your personality.</p>
<p>Because there are a lot of people and society tells you</p>
<p>that more money is actually better.</p>
<p>You are a better person somehow.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re factually more worthwhile</p>
<p>than some other people that have less money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a lie.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re given that kind of attention,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy for you to become a caricature of yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the single worst thing that happens to you.</p>
<p>But I say it in the opposite way.</p>
<p>I think all I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Silicon Valley as an example,</p>
<p>is that when somebody gets a hold of a lot of money,</p>
<p>it tends to cause them to become exactly</p>
<p>who they were meant to be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either a kind person,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re either a curious person,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re either a jerk,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re either cheap.</p>
<p>They can use all kinds of masks,</p>
<p>but now that there&rsquo;s no expectations</p>
<p>and society gives you a get out of jail free card,</p>
<p>you start to behave the way that&rsquo;s most comfortable to you.</p>
<p>So you see somebody&rsquo;s innate personality.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really interesting thing to observe</p>
<p>because then you can very quickly bucket sort</p>
<p>where do you want to spend time</p>
<p>and who is really additive to your gameplay</p>
<p>and who is really a negative detractor to your gameplay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an investor, but you&rsquo;re also a kind of philosopher.</p>
<p>You analyze the world in all its different perspectives</p>
<p>on all in podcasts, on Twitter, everywhere.</p>
<p>Do you worry that money puts you out of touch</p>
<p>from being able to truly empathize</p>
<p>with the experience of the general population,</p>
<p>which in part, first of all on a human level,</p>
<p>that could be limiting,</p>
<p>but also as an analyst of human civilization</p>
<p>that could be limiting?</p>
<p>I think it definitely can for a lot of people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an abstraction for you to stop caring.</p>
<p>I also think the other thing is that you can very quickly,</p>
<p>especially in today&rsquo;s world, become the scapegoat</p>
<p>just to use a Girardian, like Rene Girard.</p>
<p>If you think about mimetic theory in a nutshell,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re all competing for these very scarce resources</p>
<p>that we are told is worthwhile.</p>
<p>And if you view the world through that Girardian lens,</p>
<p>what are we really doing?</p>
<p>We are all fighting for scarce resources,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s Twitter followers, money, acclaim, notoriety,</p>
<p>and we all compete with each other.</p>
<p>And in that competition, you know, Girard writes like,</p>
<p>the only way you escape that loop</p>
<p>is by scapegoating something or somebody.</p>
<p>And I think we are in that loop right now</p>
<p>where just the fact of being successful</p>
<p>is a thing that one should scapegoat</p>
<p>to end all of this tension that we have in the world.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s a little misguided</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it solves the fundamental problem.</p>
<p>And we can talk about what the solution</p>
<p>to some of these problems are,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, I think, the loop that we&rsquo;re all living.</p>
<p>And so if you become a caricature</p>
<p>and you feed yourself into it,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not doing anything to really advance things.</p>
<p>Your nickname is The Dictator.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get the nickname?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the corrupting nature of money.</p>
<p>That came from poker.</p>
<p>In a poker game, you know, when you sit down, it&rsquo;s chaos,</p>
<p>especially like in our home game,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of big egos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people always watching, you know,</p>
<p>rail-birding the game, all kinds of interesting folks.</p>
<p>And in that, somebody needs to establish hygiene and rules.</p>
<p>And I really care about the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>And it would just require somebody to just say,</p>
<p>okay, enough.</p>
<p>And so, and then people were just like,</p>
<p>okay, stop dictating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where that nickname.</p>
<p>So who to you, speaking of which,</p>
<p>is the greatest poker player of all time</p>
<p>and why is it Phil Hellmuth?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know, Muth probably knew this question was coming.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>I think Hellmuth is the antidote to computers</p>
<p>more than any other player playing today.</p>
<p>And when you see him in a heads-up situation,</p>
<p>so I think like he&rsquo;s played</p>
<p>nine or 10 heads-up tournaments in a row,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s played like basically,</p>
<p>call it 10 of the top 20 people so far,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s beaten all but one of them.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re playing heads-up,</p>
<p>you know, 1v1,</p>
<p>that is the most</p>
<p>GTO understandable spot,</p>
<p>meaning game theory optimal position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where computers can give you an enormous edge.</p>
<p>The minute you add even a third player,</p>
<p>the value of computers</p>
<p>and the value of their recommendations</p>
<p>basically falls off a cliff, okay?</p>
<p>So one way to think about it is</p>
<p>Hellmuth is forced to play against people</p>
<p>that are essentially trained like AIs.</p>
<p>And so to be able to beat, you know,</p>
<p>eight out of nine of them</p>
<p>means that you are playing so orthogonally</p>
<p>to what is considered game theory optimal,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re overlaying human reasoning,</p>
<p>the judgment to say,</p>
<p>well, in this spot, I should do X, but I&rsquo;m going to do Y.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dissimilar in chess,</p>
<p>like what makes, you know, Magnus Carlsen so good.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes he takes these weird lines,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll sacrifice positions,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;ll overplay certain positions</p>
<p>or certain, you know, bishops versus knights</p>
<p>and all of these spots that are very confusing.</p>
<p>And what it does is it throws people off their game.</p>
<p>I think he just won a recent online tournament</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like by move six,</p>
<p>there is no GTO move for his opponent to make</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like out of the rule book.</p>
<p>Maybe he read some game.</p>
<p>You know, I read the quote,</p>
<p>it was like he probably read some game</p>
<p>in some bar in Russia in 1954, memorized it.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden by six moves in,</p>
<p>the computer AI is worthless.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what makes Helmuth great.</p>
<p>There is one person that I think is superior.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s what Daniel also said,</p>
<p>and I would echo that because I played Phil as well,</p>
<p>but Phil Ivey is the most well-rounded,</p>
<p>cold-blooded, bloodthirsty animal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, and he sees into your soul, Lex,</p>
<p>in a way where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>oh my God, stop looking at me.</p>
<p>Have you ever played him?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;ve played.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve played and you know, he crushes the games.</p>
<p>Crushes the games.</p>
<p>So what does feeling crushed mean and feel like in poker?</p>
<p>Is it like that you just can&rsquo;t read at all?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being constantly pressured?</p>
<p>You feel off balance?</p>
<p>You try to bluff and the person reads you perfectly?</p>
<p>That kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So this is a really, really excellent question</p>
<p>because I think this has parallels</p>
<p>to a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just use poker as a microcosm</p>
<p>to explain a bunch of other systems or games.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s running a company or investing, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use those three examples,</p>
<p>but we use poker to explain it.</p>
<p>What does success look like?</p>
<p>Well, success looks like you have positive expected value.</p>
<p>Right, in poker, the simple way to summarize that</p>
<p>is your opponent, let&rsquo;s just say you and I are playing,</p>
<p>are gonna make a bunch of mistakes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of it that&rsquo;s gonna be absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a few spots where you make mistakes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of places in the poker game</p>
<p>where I play perfectly and I make a few mistakes.</p>
<p>Basically your mistakes minus my mistakes is the edge, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how poker works.</p>
<p>If I make fewer mistakes than you make,</p>
<p>I will make money and I will win.</p>
<p>That is the objective of the game.</p>
<p>Translate that into business.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running a company, you have a team of employees,</p>
<p>you have a pool of human capital that&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of being productive in the world and creating something.</p>
<p>But you are going to make mistakes in making that.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t completely fit the market.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s mispriced.</p>
<p>Maybe it actually doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>all of the people that you need, so the margins are wrong.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the competitive set</p>
<p>of all the other alternatives that customer has.</p>
<p>Their mistakes minus your mistakes is the expected value</p>
<p>of Google, Facebook, Apple, et cetera, okay?</p>
<p>Now take investing.</p>
<p>Every time you buy something,</p>
<p>somebody else on the other side is selling it to you.</p>
<p>Is that their mistake?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>But their mistakes minus your mistakes</p>
<p>is how you make a lot of money</p>
<p>over long periods of time as an investor.</p>
<p>Somebody sold you Google at $40 a share.</p>
<p>You bought it and you kept it.</p>
<p>Huge mistake on their part, minimum mistakes on your part.</p>
<p>The difference of that is the money that you made.</p>
<p>So life can be summarized in many ways in that way.</p>
<p>So the question is, what can you do</p>
<p>about other people&rsquo;s mistakes?</p>
<p>And the answer is nothing.</p>
<p>That is somebody else&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>You can try to influence them.</p>
<p>You could try to subvert them.</p>
<p>Maybe you plant a spy inside of that other person&rsquo;s company</p>
<p>to sabotage them.</p>
<p>I guess there are things at the edges that you can do.</p>
<p>But my firm belief is that life success</p>
<p>really boils down to how do you control your mistakes?</p>
<p>Now this is a bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>The way you control your mistakes</p>
<p>is by making a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>So taking risks is somehow a way to minimize</p>
<p>the number of mistakes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say you want to find love.</p>
<p>You want to find somebody to be deeply connected with.</p>
<p>Do you do that by not going out on dates?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only person that thinks that&rsquo;s a yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking, I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>No, but you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You have to date people.</p>
<p>You have to open yourself up.</p>
<p>You have to be authentic.</p>
<p>And you give yourself a chance to get hurt.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a good person.</p>
<p>So you know what happens when you get hurt?</p>
<p>That is actually their mistake.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And if you are inauthentic, that&rsquo;s your mistake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a controllable thing in you.</p>
<p>You can tell them the truth, who you are,</p>
<p>and say, here&rsquo;s my pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>My point is there are very few things in life</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t break down, I think,</p>
<p>into that very simple idea.</p>
<p>And in terms of your mistakes,</p>
<p>society tells you don&rsquo;t make them</p>
<p>because we will judge you and we will look down on you.</p>
<p>And I think the really successful people realize</p>
<p>that actually, no, it&rsquo;s the cycle time of mistakes</p>
<p>that gets you to success.</p>
<p>Because your error rate will diminish</p>
<p>the more mistakes that you make.</p>
<p>You observe them.</p>
<p>You figure out where it&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>Is it a psychological thing?</p>
<p>Is it a cognitive thing?</p>
<p>And then you fix it.</p>
<p>So the implied thing there is that there is,</p>
<p>in business and investing, in poker, in dating, in life,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this platonic, GTO,</p>
<p>game theory optimal thing out there.</p>
<p>And so when you say mistakes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always comparing to that optimal path</p>
<p>you could have taken.</p>
<p>I think slightly different, I would say,</p>
<p>mistake is maybe a bad proxy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the best proxy I have for learning.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m using the language of what society tells you.</p>
<p>Sure, got it.</p>
<p>Society tells you that when you try something</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>So I just use that word</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the word that resonates most with most people.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>The real thing that it is is learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like in neural networks, it&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neural network, it&rsquo;s loss, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, so you&rsquo;re using the mistake</p>
<p>that is the word that is most understandable,</p>
<p>especially by the way people experience it.</p>
<p>I guess most of life is a sequence of mistakes.</p>
<p>The problem is when you use the word mistake</p>
<p>and you think about mistakes,</p>
<p>it actually has a counterproductive effect</p>
<p>of you becoming conservative and just being risk averse.</p>
<p>So if you flip it and say,</p>
<p>try to maximize the number of successes,</p>
<p>somehow that leads you to take more risk.</p>
<p>Mistake scares people.</p>
<p>I think mistakes scare people</p>
<p>because society likes these very simplified boundaries</p>
<p>of who is winning and who is losing.</p>
<p>And they want to reward people</p>
<p>who make traditional choices and succeed.</p>
<p>But the thing is, what&rsquo;s so corrosive about that</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re actually not even being put in a position</p>
<p>to actually make a quote unquote mistake and fail.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you, if you look at like</p>
<p>getting into an elite school, right?</p>
<p>Society rewards you for being in the Ivy Leagues</p>
<p>in a way that, in my opinion, incorrectly,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t reward you for being in a non Ivy League school.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain level of status</p>
<p>and presumption of intellect and capability</p>
<p>that comes with being there.</p>
<p>But that system doesn&rsquo;t really have a counterfactual</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as if you both go to MIT and Ohio State.</p>
<p>And then we can see two versions of Lex Friedman</p>
<p>so that we can figure out that the jig is up</p>
<p>and there was no difference, right?</p>
<p>And so instead it reinforces this idea</p>
<p>that there is no truth seeking function.</p>
<p>There is no way to actually make this thing whole.</p>
<p>And so it tells you, you have to get in here.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, your life is over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake, or you&rsquo;ve failed completely.</p>
<p>And so you have to find different,</p>
<p>unique ways of dismantling this.</p>
<p>This is why part of what I&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>where I got very lucky is I had no friends in high school.</p>
<p>I had a few cohort of acquaintances,</p>
<p>but part of being so hypervigilant when I grew up</p>
<p>was I was so ashamed of that world that I had to live in.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna bring anyone into it.</p>
<p>I could not see myself that anybody would accept me.</p>
<p>But the thing with that is that I had no definition</p>
<p>of what expectations should be.</p>
<p>So they were not guided by the people around me.</p>
<p>And so I would escape to define my expectations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but you didn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like your dad didn&rsquo;t put you in a prison of expectation?</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have a friend,</p>
<p>so the flip side of that, you don&rsquo;t have any other signals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to believe when you&rsquo;re in a cult that.</p>
<p>Well, he was angry.</p>
<p>He pushed me.</p>
<p>He used me as a mechanism to alleviate his own frustration.</p>
<p>And this may sound very crazy, but he also believed in me.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what created this weird duality</p>
<p>where you were just, I was always confused about.</p>
<p>You could be somebody great.</p>
<p>He believed that you could be somebody truly special.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe him</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t reconcile</p>
<p>than the other half of the day, those behaviors.</p>
<p>But what it allowed me to do was I escaped in my mind</p>
<p>and I found these archetypes around me</p>
<p>that were saviors to me.</p>
<p>So I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>I grew up right at the point</p>
<p>where the telecom boom was happening.</p>
<p>Companies like Nortel and Newbridge Networks and Mitel,</p>
<p>Bell Northern Research,</p>
<p>these were all built in the suburbs of Ottawa.</p>
<p>And so there were these larger than life figures,</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, Terry Matthews, Michael Copeland.</p>
<p>And so I thought I&rsquo;m gonna be like them.</p>
<p>I would read Forbes Magazine.</p>
<p>I would read Fortune Magazine.</p>
<p>I would look at the rich people on that list</p>
<p>and say, I would be like them,</p>
<p>not knowing that maybe that&rsquo;s not who you wanted to be,</p>
<p>but it was a lifeline.</p>
<p>And it kept my mind relatively whole</p>
<p>because I could direct my ambition in a direction.</p>
<p>And so why that&rsquo;s so important just circling back to this is</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a group of friends who were like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to community college.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a group of friends that said,</p>
<p>well, the goal is just to go to university,</p>
<p>get a simple job and join the public service,</p>
<p>have a good life.</p>
<p>And so because I had no expectations</p>
<p>and I was so afraid to venture out of my own house,</p>
<p>I never saw what middle-class life was like.</p>
<p>And so I never aspired to it.</p>
<p>Now, if I was close to it,</p>
<p>I probably would have aspired to it</p>
<p>because my parents in their best year</p>
<p>made 32,000 Canadian together.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to raise a family of five people</p>
<p>on $32,000, it&rsquo;s a complicated job.</p>
<p>And most of the time</p>
<p>they were probably making 20 something thousand.</p>
<p>And I was working since I was 14.</p>
<p>So I knew that our station in life was not the destination.</p>
<p>We had to get out.</p>
<p>But because I didn&rsquo;t have an obvious place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like I had a best friend</p>
<p>whose house I was going to,</p>
<p>and I saw some normal functional home.</p>
<p>If I had had that in this weird way,</p>
<p>I would have aspired to that.</p>
<p>What was the worst job you had to do?</p>
<p>The best job, but the worst job</p>
<p>was I worked at Burger King when I was 14 years old</p>
<p>and I would do the closing shift.</p>
<p>And that was from like 6 p.m.</p>
<p>till about two in the morning.</p>
<p>And in Ontario, where I lived, Ottawa borders Quebec.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the drinking age is 19.</p>
<p>You can see where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>
<p>The drinking age in Quebec is 18.</p>
<p>And that year made all the difference to all these kids.</p>
<p>And so they would go get completely drunk.</p>
<p>They would come back.</p>
<p>They would come to the Burger King.</p>
<p>You would see all these kids you went to high school with.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how mortifying it is?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working there in this getup.</p>
<p>And they would light that place on fire,</p>
<p>vomit everywhere, puking, pooing, peeing.</p>
<p>And when the thing shuts down at one o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>you got to clean that all up, all of it.</p>
<p>Changing the garbage, taking it out.</p>
<p>It was a grind.</p>
<p>And it really teaches you, okay, I do not want this job.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that that didn&rsquo;t push you</p>
<p>towards the stability and the security of the middle class.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any good examples of that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have those around me.</p>
<p>I was so ashamed.</p>
<p>I could have never built a relationship</p>
<p>where I could have seen those interactions to want that.</p>
<p>And so my desires were framed by these two random rich</p>
<p>people that lived in my town who I&rsquo;d never met</p>
<p>and what I read in magazines about people</p>
<p>like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>You were an early senior executive at Facebook</p>
<p>during a period of a lot of scaling in the company history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fascinating period of human history</p>
<p>in terms of technology.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of human civilization, honestly.</p>
<p>What did you learn from that time about what it takes</p>
<p>to build and scale a successful tech company?</p>
<p>A company that has almost immeasurable impact on the world.</p>
<p>That was an incredible moment in time</p>
<p>because everything was so new.</p>
<p>To your point, even how the standards of Web 2.0</p>
<p>at that time were being defined, we were defining them.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I think if you look in sort of the,</p>
<p>if you search in the patents, patent library,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of these patents that like me and Zuck have</p>
<p>for like random things like cookies, you know,</p>
<p>or like cross-site JavaScript,</p>
<p>like all these crazy things that are just like</p>
<p>these duh kind of ideas in 2023.</p>
<p>We had to invent our way around.</p>
<p>How do websites communicate with each other?</p>
<p>You know, how do we build in the cloud</p>
<p>versus in a data center?</p>
<p>How do we actually have high-performance systems?</p>
<p>You mentioned data science, the term and the idea.</p>
<p>We invented this, I invented this thing</p>
<p>called data scientist because we had a PhD from Google</p>
<p>that refused to join unless,</p>
<p>because he got a job offer that says data analyst.</p>
<p>And so we said, call him a scientist</p>
<p>because he was a PhD in particle physics.</p>
<p>So he really, you know, he was a scientist.</p>
<p>And I said, great, you&rsquo;re a scientist here.</p>
<p>And that launched a discipline.</p>
<p>I mean, a term, you know, what&rsquo;s a rose by any other name,</p>
<p>but yeah, like, you know, sometimes words like this</p>
<p>can launch entire fields.</p>
<p>And it did in that case.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t, I mean, I guess at that time</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t anticipate the impact of machine learning</p>
<p>on the entirety of this whole process</p>
<p>because you need machine learning to have both ads</p>
<p>and recommender systems to have the feed</p>
<p>for the social networks.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>The first real scaled version of machine learning,</p>
<p>not AI, but machine learning was this thing</p>
<p>that Facebook introduced called PYMK,</p>
<p>which is people you may know.</p>
<p>And the simple idea was that can we initiate</p>
<p>a viral mechanic inside the application</p>
<p>where you log in, we grab your credentials,</p>
<p>we go to your email inbox, we harvest your address book,</p>
<p>we do a compare, we make some guesses,</p>
<p>and we start to present to other people</p>
<p>that you may actually know</p>
<p>that may not be in your address book.</p>
<p>Really simple, you know, a couple of joins</p>
<p>or some tables, whatever.</p>
<p>And it started to just go crazy.</p>
<p>And the number of people that,</p>
<p>you were creating this density and entropy</p>
<p>inside this social graph</p>
<p>with what was some really simple basic math.</p>
<p>And that was eyeopening for us.</p>
<p>And what it led us down this path of</p>
<p>is really understanding the power</p>
<p>of like all this machine learning.</p>
<p>And so that infused itself into newsfeed,</p>
<p>you know, and how the content that you saw</p>
<p>could be tailored to who you were</p>
<p>and the type of person that you were.</p>
<p>So there was a moment in time</p>
<p>that all of this stuff was so new.</p>
<p>How did you translate the app to multiple languages?</p>
<p>How do you launch the company in all of these countries?</p>
<p>How much of it is just kind of stumbling into things</p>
<p>using your best, like first principles, gut thinking?</p>
<p>And how much is it like five, 10, 15, 20 year vision?</p>
<p>Like how much was thinking about the future</p>
<p>of the internet and the metaverse</p>
<p>and the humanity and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Like, cause the newsfeed sounds trivial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like changes everything.</p>
<p>Well, you have to remember like, you know,</p>
<p>newsfeed was named and we had this thing</p>
<p>where we would just name things what they were.</p>
<p>And at the time, all of these other companies,</p>
<p>and if you go back into the Wayback Machine,</p>
<p>you can see this.</p>
<p>People would invent, you know, an MP3 player</p>
<p>and they would come up with some crazy name</p>
<p>or they would invent a software product</p>
<p>and come up with a crazy name, right?</p>
<p>And it sounded like the pharma industry, you know,</p>
<p>blow Casimab, you know, tag your best friends.</p>
<p>And you think, what is this?</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p>
<p>And, you know, this was Zuck&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>He was like, well, this is a feed of news.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to call it newsfeed.</p>
<p>This is where you tag your photos.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to call that photo tagging.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, you know, pretty obvious stuff.</p>
<p>So the thing, the way that those things came about though</p>
<p>was very experimentally.</p>
<p>And this is where I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>for people to understand.</p>
<p>I think Bezos explains this the best.</p>
<p>There is a tendency after things work</p>
<p>to create a narrative fallacy because it feeds your ego.</p>
<p>And you want to have been the person that saw it coming.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s much more honest to say,</p>
<p>we were very good probabilistic thinkers</p>
<p>that tried to learn as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>meaning to make as many mistakes as possible.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, if you look at this very famous placard</p>
<p>that Facebook had from back in the day, what did it say?</p>
<p>It said, move fast and break things.</p>
<p>In societal language, that&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>make mistakes as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>Because the minute you break something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do that by design.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a feature.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it&rsquo;s a bug.</p>
<p>But he understood that and we embraced that idea.</p>
<p>I used to run this meeting once a week</p>
<p>where the whole goal was,</p>
<p>I want to see that there was a thousand experiments</p>
<p>that were run and show me them all</p>
<p>from the dumbest to the most impactful.</p>
<p>And we would go through that loop</p>
<p>and what did it train people?</p>
<p>Not that you got celebrated for the right answer,</p>
<p>but you got celebrated for trying.</p>
<p>I ran 12 experiments, 12 failed,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d be like, you&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>Can I just take a small tangent on that?</p>
<p>Is that move fast and break things</p>
<p>has become like a catchphrase</p>
<p>of the thing that embodies the toxic culture</p>
<p>of Silicon Valley in today&rsquo;s discourse,</p>
<p>which confuses me.</p>
<p>Of course, words and phrases get sort of captured and so on.</p>
<p>Becomes very reductive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very loaded set of words</p>
<p>that together can be, many years later,</p>
<p>people can view very reductive.</p>
<p>Can you steel man each side of that?</p>
<p>So pro move fast and break things</p>
<p>and against move fast and break things.</p>
<p>So I think the pro of move fast and break things</p>
<p>is saying the following.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a space of things we know</p>
<p>and a massive space of things we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a rate of growth of the things we know.</p>
<p>But the rate of growth of the things we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is actually, we have to assume, growing faster.</p>
<p>So the most important thing is to move into the space</p>
<p>of the things we don&rsquo;t know as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>And so in order to acquire knowledge,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to assume that the failure mode</p>
<p>is the nominal state.</p>
<p>And so we just need to move as quickly as we can,</p>
<p>break as many things as possible,</p>
<p>which means like things are breaking in code.</p>
<p>Do the root cause analysis,</p>
<p>figure out how to make things better,</p>
<p>and then rapidly move into the space.</p>
<p>And he or she who moves fastest into that space will win.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t imply carelessness, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t imply moving fast</p>
<p>without also aggressively picking up the lessons</p>
<p>from the mistakes you make.</p>
<p>Well, again, that&rsquo;s steel manning the pro,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s a thoughtful movement</p>
<p>around velocity and acquisition of knowledge.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s steel man the con case.</p>
<p>When these systems become big enough,</p>
<p>there is no more room to experiment in an open-ended way</p>
<p>because the implications have broad societal impacts</p>
<p>that are not clear upfront.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a different, less controversial example.</p>
<p>If we said Lipitor worked well</p>
<p>for all people except South Asians,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a specific immunoresponse</p>
<p>that we can iterate to.</p>
<p>And if we move quickly enough,</p>
<p>we can run 10,000 experiments</p>
<p>and we think the answer is in that space.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is that those 10,000 experiments</p>
<p>may kill 10 million people.</p>
<p>So you have to move methodically.</p>
<p>When that drug was experimental</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t being given to 500 million people in the world,</p>
<p>moving fast made sense because you could have a pig model,</p>
<p>a mouse model, a monkey model,</p>
<p>you could figure out toxicity,</p>
<p>but we picked all that low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>And so now these small iterations have huge impacts</p>
<p>that need to be measured and implemented.</p>
<p>Different example is like, you know, if you work at Boeing</p>
<p>and you have an implementation</p>
<p>that gives you a 2% efficiency</p>
<p>by reshaping the wing or adding winglets,</p>
<p>there needs to be a methodical move slow, be right process</p>
<p>because mistakes when they compound</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s already implemented and at scale</p>
<p>have huge externalities</p>
<p>that are impossible to measure until after the fact.</p>
<p>And you see this in the 737 Max.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how one would steel man the con case,</p>
<p>which is that when an industry becomes critical,</p>
<p>you got to slow down.</p>
<p>This makes me sad because some industries</p>
<p>like Twitter and Facebook are a good example.</p>
<p>They achieve scale very quickly</p>
<p>before really exploring the big area of things to learn.</p>
<p>So you basically pick one low hanging fruit</p>
<p>and that became your huge success.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re sitting there with that stupid fruit.</p>
<p>Well, so I think, so as an example, like, you know,</p>
<p>if you had to, you know,</p>
<p>if I was running Facebook for a day,</p>
<p>you know, the big opportunity in my opinion</p>
<p>was really not the metaverse,</p>
<p>but it was actually getting the closest</p>
<p>that anybody could get to AGI.</p>
<p>And if I had to steel man that product case,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what how I would have pitched it to the board</p>
<p>and to Zuck, I would have said, listen,</p>
<p>there are three and a half billion people monthly</p>
<p>using this thing.</p>
<p>If we think about human intelligence very reductively,</p>
<p>we would say that there&rsquo;s a large portion of it,</p>
<p>which is cognitive.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a large portion of it, which is emotional.</p>
<p>We have the best ability to build a multimodal model</p>
<p>that basically takes all of these massive inputs together</p>
<p>to try to intuit how a system would react</p>
<p>to all kinds of stimuli.</p>
<p>That to me would been a profound leap forward for humanity.</p>
<p>Can you dig into that a little bit more?</p>
<p>So in terms of, now this is a board meeting,</p>
<p>how would that make Facebook money?</p>
<p>I think that you have all of these systems over time</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know could benefit from some layer of reasoning</p>
<p>to make it better.</p>
<p>What does Spotify look like when instead of just</p>
<p>a very simple recommendation engine,</p>
<p>it actually understands sort of your emotional context</p>
<p>and your mood and can move you to a body of music</p>
<p>that you would like?</p>
<p>What does it look like if your television,</p>
<p>instead of having to go and channel surf 50,000 shows</p>
<p>on a horrible UI, instead just has a sense</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re into and shows it to you.</p>
<p>What does it mean when you get in your car</p>
<p>and it actually drives you to a place</p>
<p>because you should actually eat there</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>These are all random things that make no sense a priori,</p>
<p>but it starts to make the person or the provider</p>
<p>of that service, the critical reasoning layer</p>
<p>for all these everyday products that today</p>
<p>would look very flat without that reasoning.</p>
<p>And I think you license that and you make a lot of money.</p>
<p>So in many ways, instead of becoming more of the pixels</p>
<p>that you see, you become more of the bare metal</p>
<p>that actually creates that experience.</p>
<p>And if you look at the companies</p>
<p>that are multi-decade legacy kinds of businesses,</p>
<p>the thing that they have done is quietly</p>
<p>and surreptitiously move down the stack.</p>
<p>You never move up the stack to survive.</p>
<p>You need to move down the stack.</p>
<p>So if you take that OSI reference stack, right?</p>
<p>These layers, how you build an app from the physical layer</p>
<p>to the transport layer, all the way up to the app layer,</p>
<p>you can map from the 1980s,</p>
<p>all the big companies that have been created, right?</p>
<p>All the way from Fairchild Semiconductor and NatSemi</p>
<p>to Intel, to Cisco, to 3Com, you know,</p>
<p>Oracle, Netscape at one point,</p>
<p>all the way up to the Googles and Facebooks of the world.</p>
<p>But if you look at where all the lock-in happened,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by companies like Apple who used to make software</p>
<p>saying, I&rsquo;m gonna get one close.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make the bare metal</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna become the platform.</p>
<p>Or Google, same thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna create this dominant platform</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna create a substrate</p>
<p>that organizes all this information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just omnipresent and everywhere.</p>
<p>So the key is, if you are lucky enough</p>
<p>to be one of these apps that are in front of people,</p>
<p>you better start digging quickly and moving your way down</p>
<p>and get out of the way and disappear.</p>
<p>But by disappearing, you will become much, much bigger</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impossible to usurp you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I 100% agree with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so smart.</p>
<p>This is the depersonalization</p>
<p>and the algorithms that enable depersonalization</p>
<p>almost like a operating system layer.</p>
<p>So pushing away from the interface</p>
<p>and the actual system that does the personalization.</p>
<p>I think the challenges there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously technical challenges,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also societal challenges</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like in a relationship.</p>
<p>If you have an intimate algorithmic connection</p>
<p>with individual humans, you can do both good and bad.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s risks that you&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re making a lot of money now</p>
<p>as Twitter and Facebook with ads, surface layer ads,</p>
<p>what is the incentive to take the risk</p>
<p>of guiding people more?</p>
<p>Because you can hurt people, you can piss off people,</p>
<p>you can, I mean, there&rsquo;s a cost</p>
<p>to forming a more intimate relationship with the users</p>
<p>in the short term, I think.</p>
<p>You said a really, really key thing,</p>
<p>which was a really great emotional instinctive reaction,</p>
<p>which is when I said the AGI thing,</p>
<p>you said, well, how would you ever make money from that?</p>
<p>That is the key.</p>
<p>The presumption is that this thing</p>
<p>would not be an important thing at the beginning.</p>
<p>And I think what that allows you to do,</p>
<p>if you were Twitter or Google or Apple or Facebook,</p>
<p>anybody, Microsoft embarking on building something like this</p>
<p>is that you can actually have it off the critical path</p>
<p>and you can experiment with this for years</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what it takes to find a version one</p>
<p>that is special enough where it&rsquo;s worth showcasing.</p>
<p>And so in many ways, you get the free option.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be spending, any of these companies</p>
<p>will be spending tens of billions of dollars</p>
<p>in OpEx and CapEx every year and all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>It is not a thing that money</p>
<p>actually makes more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>In fact, you actually don&rsquo;t need to give</p>
<p>these kinds of things a lot of money at all</p>
<p>because starting in 2023, right now,</p>
<p>you have the two most important tectonic shifts</p>
<p>that have ever happened in our lifetime in technology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not talked about, but these things allow AGI,</p>
<p>I think, to emerge over the next 10 or 15 years</p>
<p>where it wasn&rsquo;t possible for.</p>
<p>The first thing is that the marginal cost of energy is zero.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to pay for anything anymore, right?</p>
<p>And we can double click into why that is.</p>
<p>And the second is the marginal cost of compute is zero.</p>
<p>And so when you take the multiplication or, you know,</p>
<p>if you want to get really fancy mathematically,</p>
<p>the convolution of these two things together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to change everything.</p>
<p>So think about what a billion dollars gets today.</p>
<p>And we can use open AI as an example.</p>
<p>A billion dollars gets open AI</p>
<p>a handful of functional models</p>
<p>and a pretty fast iterative loop, right?</p>
<p>But imagine what open AI had to overcome.</p>
<p>They had to overcome a compute challenge.</p>
<p>They had to strip together a whole bunch of GPUs.</p>
<p>They had to build all kinds of scaffolding software.</p>
<p>They had to find data center support.</p>
<p>That consumes all kinds of money.</p>
<p>So that billion dollars didn&rsquo;t go that far.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a testament to how clever that open AI team is.</p>
<p>But in four years from now, when energy costs zero</p>
<p>and basically GPUs are like, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re falling off a truck</p>
<p>and you can use them effectively for free,</p>
<p>now all of a sudden a billion dollars</p>
<p>gives you some amount of teraflops of compute</p>
<p>that is probably the total number of teraflops</p>
<p>available today in the world.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s how gargantuan this move is</p>
<p>when you take these two variables to zero.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a million things to ask.</p>
<p>I almost don&rsquo;t want to get distracted</p>
<p>by the marginal cost of energy going to zero</p>
<p>because I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Can I give you the 30 seconds?</p>
<p>Sure, yes.</p>
<p>So if you look inside of the two most progressive states,</p>
<p>the three most progressive states,</p>
<p>New York, California, and Massachusetts,</p>
<p>a lot of left-leaning folks,</p>
<p>a lot of people who believe in climate science</p>
<p>and climate change,</p>
<p>the energy costs in those three states</p>
<p>are the worst they are in the entire country.</p>
<p>And energy is compounding at three to 4% per annum.</p>
<p>So every decade to 15 years,</p>
<p>energy costs in these states double.</p>
<p>In some cases and in some months,</p>
<p>our energy costs are increasing by 11% a month.</p>
<p>But the ability to actually generate energy</p>
<p>is now effectively zero.</p>
<p>The cost per kilowatt hour</p>
<p>to put a solar panel on your roof</p>
<p>and a battery wall inside your garage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the cheapest it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>These things are the most efficient they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>And so to acquire energy from the sun</p>
<p>and store it for your use later on</p>
<p>literally is a zero cost proposition.</p>
<p>So how do you explain the gap between the cost going up?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>So this is the other side of regulatory capture, right?</p>
<p>You know, we all fight to build monopolies.</p>
<p>While there are monopolies hiding in plain sight,</p>
<p>the utilities are a perfect example.</p>
<p>There are a hundred million homes in America.</p>
<p>There are about 1700 utilities in America.</p>
<p>So they have captive markets.</p>
<p>But in return for that captive market,</p>
<p>the law says need to invest a certain amount per year</p>
<p>in upgrading that power line,</p>
<p>in changing out that turbine,</p>
<p>in making sure you transition from coal to wind or whatever.</p>
<p>Just as an example,</p>
<p>upgrading power lines in the United States</p>
<p>over the next decade is a $2 trillion proposition.</p>
<p>These 1700 organizations have to spend,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a quarter of a trillion dollars a year</p>
<p>just to change the power lines.</p>
<p>That is why, even though it costs nothing to make energy,</p>
<p>you are paying double every seven or eight years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s CapEx and OpEx of a very brittle old infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you trying to build an app</p>
<p>and being forced to build your own data center.</p>
<p>And you say, but wait, I just want to write to AWS.</p>
<p>I just want to use GCP.</p>
<p>I just want to move on.</p>
<p>All that complexity is solved for me.</p>
<p>And some law says, no, you can&rsquo;t, you got to use it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what consumers are dealing with,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also what industrial</p>
<p>and manufacturing organizations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what we all deal with.</p>
<p>So how do we get rid ourselves</p>
<p>of this old infrastructure that we&rsquo;re paying for?</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s happening today, which I think is,</p>
<p>this is why I think it&rsquo;s the most important trend</p>
<p>right now in the world,</p>
<p>is that 100 million homeowners</p>
<p>are each going to become their own little power plant</p>
<p>and compete with these 1700 utilities.</p>
<p>And that is a great-</p>
<p>In the United States or globally?</p>
<p>No, just deal with the United States for a second,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s easier to see here.</p>
<p>100 million homes, solar panel on the roof.</p>
<p>And by the way, just to make it clear,</p>
<p>the sun doesn&rsquo;t need to shine, right?</p>
<p>These panels now work where you have these UV bands</p>
<p>that can actually extrapolate beyond the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re usable in all weather conditions.</p>
<p>And a simple system can support you collecting enough power</p>
<p>to not just run your functional day-to-day life,</p>
<p>but then to contribute what&rsquo;s left over back into the grid</p>
<p>for Google&rsquo;s data center or Facebook&rsquo;s data center,</p>
<p>where you get a small check.</p>
<p>The cost is going to zero.</p>
<p>How obvious is this to people?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making this out?</p>
<p>Okay, so, because this is a pretty profound prediction.</p>
<p>If the cost is indeed go to zero,</p>
<p>that, I mean, the compute,</p>
<p>the cost of compute going to zero, I can-</p>
<p>So the cost of compute going to zero is-</p>
<p>Can kind of understand,</p>
<p>but the energy seems like a radical prediction of yours.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just naturally what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>Now, let me give you a different way of explaining this.</p>
<p>If you look at any system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really important thing that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Clay Christensen calls crossing the chasm.</p>
<p>If you explained it numerically,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how I would explain it to you, Lex.</p>
<p>If you introduce a disruptive product,</p>
<p>typically what happens is the first three to 5% of people</p>
<p>are these zealous believers,</p>
<p>and they ignore all the logical reasons</p>
<p>why this product doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>because they believe in the proposition of the future</p>
<p>and they buy it.</p>
<p>The problem is at 5%.</p>
<p>If you want a product to get to mass market,</p>
<p>you have one of two choices,</p>
<p>which is you either bring the cost down,</p>
<p>low enough, or the feature set becomes so compelling</p>
<p>that even at a high price point.</p>
<p>An example of the latter is the iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone today, the 14 iPhone,</p>
<p>costs more than the original iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably doubled in price over the last 14 or 15 years,</p>
<p>but we view it as an essential element</p>
<p>of what we need in our daily lives.</p>
<p>It turns out that battery EVs and solar panels</p>
<p>are an example of the former,</p>
<p>because people like President Biden,</p>
<p>with all of these subsidies,</p>
<p>have now introduced so much money for people</p>
<p>to just do this,</p>
<p>where it is a money-making proposition</p>
<p>for 100 million homes.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re seeing as a result</p>
<p>are all of these companies</p>
<p>who want to get in front of that trend.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they want to own the relationship</p>
<p>with 100 million homeowners.</p>
<p>They want to manage the power infrastructure,</p>
<p>Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Just name the company.</p>
<p>So if you do that and you control that relationship,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna show you&hellip;</p>
<p>For example, Amazon will probably say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a member of Prime,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll stick the panels on your house for free.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do all the work for you for free.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a feature of being a member of Prime.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll manage all that energy for you.</p>
<p>It makes so much sense.</p>
<p>And it is mathematically accretive for Amazon to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not accretive for the existing energy industry</p>
<p>because they get blown up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely accretive for peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>If you think the number of wars we fight</p>
<p>over natural resources,</p>
<p>take them all off the table</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t need energy from abroad,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to fight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to find a reason to fight.</p>
<p>Meaning, sorry, there&rsquo;d be a moral reason to fight,</p>
<p>but the last number of wars that we fought</p>
<p>were not as much rooted in morality as they were rooted in.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like they were very much rooted</p>
<p>in conflict over resources, energy specifically.</p>
<p>And then, sorry, just the last thing I want to say,</p>
<p>I keep interrupting, apologies,</p>
<p>but the chips,</p>
<p>what people want to say is that,</p>
<p>now that we&rsquo;re at two and three nanometer scale</p>
<p>for typical kind of like transistor fab, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>And forget about transistor density,</p>
<p>forget about Moore&rsquo;s Law, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And I would just say, no, look at teraflops.</p>
<p>And really, teraflops is the combination of CPUs,</p>
<p>but much and much less important,</p>
<p>and really is the combination of ASICs,</p>
<p>so application-specific ICs, and GPUs.</p>
<p>And so you put the two together,</p>
<p>I mean, if I gave you a billion dollars five years from now,</p>
<p>the amount of damage you could do, damage in good way,</p>
<p>in terms of building racks and racks of GPUs,</p>
<p>the kind of models that you could build,</p>
<p>the training sets and the data that you could consume</p>
<p>to solve a problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s enough to do something really powerful.</p>
<p>Whereas today, it&rsquo;s not yet quite enough.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really interesting idea that you talk about</p>
<p>in terms of Facebook and Twitter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected to this,</p>
<p>that if you were running sort of Twitter or Facebook,</p>
<p>that you would move them all to like AWS.</p>
<p>So you would have somebody else</p>
<p>to compute the infrastructure.</p>
<p>It probably, if you could explain that reasoning,</p>
<p>means that you believe in this idea of energy going to zero,</p>
<p>compute going to zero,</p>
<p>so let people that are optimized in that do the best job.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>the initially in the early 2000s</p>
<p>and the beginning of the 2010s,</p>
<p>if you were big enough scale,</p>
<p>oh, sorry, everybody was building their own stuff.</p>
<p>Then between 2010 through 2020,</p>
<p>really the idea was everybody should be on AWS</p>
<p>except the biggest of the biggest folks.</p>
<p>I think in the 2020s and 30s,</p>
<p>I think the answer is actually</p>
<p>everybody should be in these public clouds.</p>
<p>And the reason is the engineering velocity of the guts.</p>
<p>So, you know, take a simple example,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>we have not seen a massive iteration in database design</p>
<p>until Snowflake, right?</p>
<p>I think maybe Postgres was like</p>
<p>the last big turn of the dial.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly know,</p>
<p>except that everybody that&rsquo;s on AWS</p>
<p>and everybody that&rsquo;s on GCP and Azure</p>
<p>gets to now benefit from a hundred plus billion dollars</p>
<p>of aggregate market cap,</p>
<p>rapidly iterating, making mistakes,</p>
<p>fixing, solving, learning.</p>
<p>And that is a best in class industry now, right?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>all these AI layers around analytics</p>
<p>so that app companies can make better decisions.</p>
<p>All of these things</p>
<p>will allow you to build more nimble organizations</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll have this federated model of development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take these things off the shelf.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll roll my own stitching over here</p>
<p>because the thing that where you make money</p>
<p>is still for most people</p>
<p>and how the apps provision an experience to a user.</p>
<p>And everybody else can make a lot of money</p>
<p>just servicing that.</p>
<p>So they work in a really,</p>
<p>they play well together in the sandbox.</p>
<p>So in the future, everybody just should be there.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for anybody, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>because if you were to roll your own data centers,</p>
<p>for example, like Google for a long time</p>
<p>had these massive leaps where they had GFS and Bigtable.</p>
<p>Those are really good in the 2000s and 2010s.</p>
<p>And this is not to throw shade at Google.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for whatever exists</p>
<p>that is the progeny of GFS and Bigtable</p>
<p>to be anywhere near as good</p>
<p>as $100 billion industries attempt to build that stack.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re putting your organization</p>
<p>under enormous pressure to be that good.</p>
<p>I guess the implied risk taken there</p>
<p>is that you could become the next AWS,</p>
<p>like Tesla doing some of the compute in-house.</p>
<p>I guess the bet there is that you can become</p>
<p>the next AWS for the new wave of computation</p>
<p>if that level, if that kind of computation is different.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s machine learning,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone&rsquo;s won that battle yet,</p>
<p>which is machine learning centric compute.</p>
<p>Well, I think that software has a very powerful property</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that can happen asynchronously</p>
<p>so that real-time inference</p>
<p>can be actually really lightweight code deployment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think you can have</p>
<p>a very federated ecosystem inside of all of these places.</p>
<p>Tesla is very different</p>
<p>because in order to build the best car,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like trying to build the best iPhone,</p>
<p>which is that you need to control it</p>
<p>all the way down to the bare metal in order to do it well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not possible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to be a systems integrator,</p>
<p>which is what everybody,</p>
<p>other than this modern generation of car companies have been.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done a very good job of that,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t be the experience</p>
<p>that allows you to win in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s linger on the social media thing.</p>
<p>So you said if you ran Facebook for a day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s extend that.</p>
<p>If you were to build a new social network today,</p>
<p>how would you fix Twitter?</p>
<p>How would you fix social media?</p>
<p>If you wanna answer a different question</p>
<p>is if you were Elon Musk, somebody you know,</p>
<p>and you were taking over Twitter, what would you fix?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this a little bit.</p>
<p>First of all, let me give you a backdrop.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t actually build a social media company at all.</p>
<p>And the answer is, the reasoning is the following.</p>
<p>I really tend to believe, as you probably got in a sense,</p>
<p>of sort of patterns and probabilities.</p>
<p>And if you said to me,</p>
<p>probabilistically answer where are we going</p>
<p>in apps and social experiences,</p>
<p>what I would say is, Lex,</p>
<p>we spent the first decade building platforms</p>
<p>and getting them to scale.</p>
<p>And if you wanna think about it,</p>
<p>again, back to sort of this poker analogy,</p>
<p>others&rsquo; mistakes minus your mistakes is the value.</p>
<p>Well, the value that was captured was trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>essentially to Apple and to Google.</p>
<p>And they did that by basically attracting billions</p>
<p>of monthly active users to their platform.</p>
<p>Then this next wave were the apps,</p>
<p>Facebook, QQ, Tencent, TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat,</p>
<p>that whole panoply of apps.</p>
<p>And interestingly, they were in many ways</p>
<p>an atomized version of the platforms, right?</p>
<p>They sat on top of them.</p>
<p>They were an ecosystem participant,</p>
<p>but the value they created was the same.</p>
<p>Trillions of dollars of enterprise value,</p>
<p>billions of monthly active users.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of hiding in plain sight,</p>
<p>which is that the next most obvious atomic unit</p>
<p>are content creators.</p>
<p>Now, let me give you two examples.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, this random crazy guy,</p>
<p>Mr. Beast, Jimmy Donaldson,</p>
<p>just the two of you alone added up, okay?</p>
<p>And you guys are going to approach</p>
<p>in the next five years a billion people.</p>
<p>The only thing that you guys haven&rsquo;t figured out yet</p>
<p>is how to capture trillions of dollars of value.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s not your stated mission.</p>
<p>Right, right, but let&rsquo;s just look at Mr. Beast alone</p>
<p>because he is trying to do exactly that probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think Jimmy is gonna build</p>
<p>an enormous business.</p>
<p>But if you take Jimmy</p>
<p>and all of the other content creators, right?</p>
<p>You guys are atomizing what the apps have done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re providing your own curated newsfeeds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re providing your own curated communities.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed, you let people move in and out</p>
<p>of these things in a very lightweight way.</p>
<p>And value is accruing to you.</p>
<p>So the honest answer to your question</p>
<p>is I would focus on the content creator side of things</p>
<p>because I believe that&rsquo;s where the puck is going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much more important shift</p>
<p>in how we all consume information and content</p>
<p>and are entertained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through brands like you.</p>
<p>Individual people that we can humanize</p>
<p>and understand are the filter.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t you just arguing</p>
<p>against the point you made earlier,</p>
<p>which is what you would recommend</p>
<p>is the invest in the AGI, the depersonalization?</p>
<p>Because they could still be a participant.</p>
<p>In that end state, if that happens,</p>
<p>you have the option value of being an enabler of that.</p>
<p>You can help improve what they do.</p>
<p>Again, you can be this bare metal service provider</p>
<p>where you can be a tax.</p>
<p>You can participate in everything that you do,</p>
<p>every question that&rsquo;s asked, every comment that&rsquo;s curated.</p>
<p>If you could have more intelligence</p>
<p>as you provide a service to your fans and your audience,</p>
<p>you would probably pay a small percentage of that revenue.</p>
<p>I suspect all content creators would.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s that stack of services</p>
<p>that is like a smart human being.</p>
<p>How do you help produce this information?</p>
<p>You would pay a producer for that.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you would.</p>
<p>So back to your question.</p>
<p>So what would I do?</p>
<p>I think that you have to move into that world</p>
<p>pretty aggressively.</p>
<p>I think that right now you first have to solve</p>
<p>what is broken inside of these social networks.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a technical problem.</p>
<p>So just to put it out there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>where there are these nefarious organizations.</p>
<p>That happens.</p>
<p>Brigading X, Y, Z, that happens.</p>
<p>But the real problem is a psychological one</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dealing with,</p>
<p>which is people through a whole set of situations</p>
<p>have lost belief in themselves.</p>
<p>And I think that that comes up</p>
<p>as this very virulent form of rejection</p>
<p>that they tried to put into these social networks.</p>
<p>So if you look inside of comments on anything,</p>
<p>like you could have a person that says on Twitter,</p>
<p>I saved this dog from a fiery building</p>
<p>and there would be negative commenters.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, well, again, put yourself in their shoes.</p>
<p>How do I steel man their case?</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I get people throw shade at me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, let me steel man their point of view.</p>
<p>And the best that I can come up with is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working really hard over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying, I played by all the rules</p>
<p>that were told to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played well, I&rsquo;ve played fairly,</p>
<p>and I am not being rewarded in a system of value</p>
<p>that you recognize.</p>
<p>And that is making me mad.</p>
<p>And now I need to cope and I need to vent.</p>
<p>So back in the day, my dad used to drink.</p>
<p>He would make me go get things to hit me with.</p>
<p>Today, you go to Twitter, you spot off,</p>
<p>you try to deal with the latent anger that you feel.</p>
<p>So a social network has to be designed in my opinion</p>
<p>to solve that psychological corner case</p>
<p>because it is what makes a network unusable.</p>
<p>To get real density, you have to find a way</p>
<p>of moving away from that toxicity</p>
<p>because it ruins a product experience.</p>
<p>You could have the best pixels in the world,</p>
<p>but if people are virulently spitting into their keyboards,</p>
<p>other people are just gonna say,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;m done with this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good.</p>
<p>So the social network has to have a social cost.</p>
<p>You can do it in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>One is where you have real world identity.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s a cost to being virulent</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a cost to being caustic.</p>
<p>A second way is to actually just overlay</p>
<p>an economic framework so that there&rsquo;s a more</p>
<p>pertinent economic value that you assign</p>
<p>to basically spouting off.</p>
<p>And the more you wanna spend, the more you can say.</p>
<p>And I think both have a lot of value.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is.</p>
<p>I tend to like the latter.</p>
<p>I think real world identity shuts down a lot of debate</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s still too much,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a sensation</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be some retribution.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s more free speech over there,</p>
<p>but it cannot be costless because in that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a level of toxicity</p>
<p>that just makes these products unusable.</p>
<p>Third option.</p>
<p>And by the way, all of these can work together.</p>
<p>If we look at this, what you call the corner case,</p>
<p>which is hilarious, what I would call the human condition,</p>
<p>which is, you know, that anger is rooted</p>
<p>with the challenges of life.</p>
<p>And what about having an algorithm</p>
<p>that shows you what you see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s personalized to you</p>
<p>and helps you maximize your personal growth in the longterm</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re challenging yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re improving, you&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just enough of criticism to keep you on your toes,</p>
<p>but just enough of like the dopamine rush</p>
<p>to keep you entertained</p>
<p>and finding that balance for each individual person.</p>
<p>You just described an AGI</p>
<p>of a very empathetic, well-rounded friend.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you can throw that person, even anonymous,</p>
<p>into a pool of discourse and they would be better.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>That is a very, very, very elegant way of stating it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But like you said, the AGI might be a few years away,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a huge investment.</p>
<p>My concern, my gut feeling is this thing we&rsquo;re calling AGI</p>
<p>is actually not that difficult to build technically,</p>
<p>but it requires a certain culture</p>
<p>and it requires a certain risks to be taken.</p>
<p>I think you could reductively boil down</p>
<p>the human intellect into cognition and emotion.</p>
<p>And depending on who you are and depending on the moment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re weighted very differently, obviously.</p>
<p>Cognition is so easily done by computers</p>
<p>that we should assume that that&rsquo;s a soft problem.</p>
<p>So our differentiation is the reasoning part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the emotional overlay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to steel man the opposite person&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>and feel why that person, you can forgive them</p>
<p>without excusing what they did, as an example.</p>
<p>That is a very difficult thing, I think,</p>
<p>to capture in software,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>If done crudely, it takes a form of censorship,</p>
<p>just banning people off the platform.</p>
<p>Let me ask you some tricky questions.</p>
<p>Do you think Trump should have been removed from Twitter?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the pro case?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having fun here.</p>
<p>Do you steel man each side?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s steel man the, get him off the platform.</p>
<p>Here we have a guy who is virulent in all ways.</p>
<p>He promotes confrontation.</p>
<p>He lacks decorum.</p>
<p>He incites the fervent believers of his cause</p>
<p>to act up and push the boundaries bordering on</p>
<p>and potentially even including breaking the law.</p>
<p>He does not observe the social norms</p>
<p>of a society that keep us well-functioning,</p>
<p>including an orderly transition of power.</p>
<p>If he is left in a moment where he feels trapped</p>
<p>and cornered, he could behave in ways</p>
<p>that will confuse the people that believe in him</p>
<p>to act in ways that they so regret</p>
<p>that it could bring our democracy to an end</p>
<p>or create so much damage or create a wound that&rsquo;s so deep,</p>
<p>it will take years of conflict</p>
<p>and years of confrontation to heal it.</p>
<p>We need to remove him and we need to do it now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been too long.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve let it go on too long.</p>
<p>The other side of the argument would be</p>
<p>he was a duly elected person whose views</p>
<p>have been run over for way too long.</p>
<p>And he uses the ability to say extreme things</p>
<p>in order to showcase how corrupt these systems have become</p>
<p>and how insular these organizations are</p>
<p>in protecting their own class.</p>
<p>And so if you really wanna prevent class warfare,</p>
<p>and if you really wanna keep the American dream alive</p>
<p>for everybody, we need to show that the First Amendment,</p>
<p>the Constitution, the Second Amendment,</p>
<p>all of this infrastructure is actually bigger</p>
<p>than any partisan view, no matter how bad it is.</p>
<p>And that people will make their own decisions.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of people</p>
<p>that can see past the words he uses</p>
<p>and focus on the substance of what he&rsquo;s trying to get across</p>
<p>and more generally agree than disagree.</p>
<p>And so when you silence that voice,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re effectively saying is this is a rigged game.</p>
<p>And all of those things that we were told were not true</p>
<p>are actually true.</p>
<p>If you were to look at the crude algorithms of Twitter,</p>
<p>of course, I don&rsquo;t have any insider knowledge,</p>
<p>but I could imagine that they saw the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a metric that measures</p>
<p>how negative the experience is of the platform.</p>
<p>And they probably saw in several ways,</p>
<p>you could look at this,</p>
<p>but the presence of Donald Trump on the platform</p>
<p>was consistently increasing how shitty people are feeling,</p>
<p>short-term and long-term,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re probably yelling at each other,</p>
<p>having worse and worse and worse experience.</p>
<p>If you even do a survey of how do you feel</p>
<p>about using this platform over the last week,</p>
<p>they would say horrible relative to maybe a year ago</p>
<p>when Donald Trump was not actively tweeting or so on.</p>
<p>So here you&rsquo;re sitting at Twitter and saying,</p>
<p>okay, I know everyone&rsquo;s talking about speech</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but I kind of want to build a platform</p>
<p>where the users are happy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re becoming more and more unhappy.</p>
<p>How do I solve this happiness problem?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s ban the sources of the unhappiness.</p>
<p>Now we can&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a source of unhappiness, we&rsquo;ll ban you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wait until that source says something</p>
<p>that we can claim breaks our rules,</p>
<p>like incites violence or so on.</p>
<p>That would work if you could measure</p>
<p>your construct of happiness properly.</p>
<p>The problem is I think what Twitter looked at</p>
<p>was that people were active commenters</p>
<p>and got it confused for overall system happiness.</p>
<p>Because for every piece of content</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created on the internet,</p>
<p>of the hundred people that consume it,</p>
<p>maybe one or two people comment on it.</p>
<p>And so by over amplifying that signal</p>
<p>and assuming that it was the plurality of people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they actually made a huge blunder</p>
<p>because there was no scientific method, I think,</p>
<p>to get to the answer of deplatforming him.</p>
<p>And it did expose this idea that it&rsquo;s a bit of a rigged game</p>
<p>and that there are these deep biases</p>
<p>that some of these organizations have</p>
<p>to opinions that are counter to theirs</p>
<p>and to their orthodox view of the world.</p>
<p>So in general, you lean towards keeping,</p>
<p>first of all, presidents on the platform,</p>
<p>but also controversial voices.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important to keep them there.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a tricky one in the recent news</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s become especially relevant for me.</p>
<p>What do you think about if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention</p>
<p>to Kanye West, a recent controversial outburst</p>
<p>on social media about Jews, black people,</p>
<p>racism in general, slavery, Holocaust,</p>
<p>all of these topics that he touched on in different ways</p>
<p>on different platforms, but including Twitter.</p>
<p>What do you do with that?</p>
<p>And what do you do with that from a platform perspective</p>
<p>or what do you do from a humanity perspective</p>
<p>of how to add love to the world?</p>
<p>Should we take both sides of that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Option one is he is completely out of line</p>
<p>and option two is he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Just to simplify.</p>
<p>So the path one is he&rsquo;s an incredibly important</p>
<p>tastemaker in the world that defines the belief system</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And there just is no room for any form of racism</p>
<p>or bias or antisemitism in today&rsquo;s day and age,</p>
<p>particularly by people whose words and comments</p>
<p>will be amplified around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already paid a large price for that.</p>
<p>And then the expectation of success is some amount</p>
<p>of societal decorum that keeps moving the ball forward.</p>
<p>The other side would say life, I think,</p>
<p>goes from harmony to disharmony to repair.</p>
<p>And anybody who has gone through a very complicated divorce</p>
<p>will tell you that in that moment,</p>
<p>your life is extremely disharmonious</p>
<p>and you are struggling to cope.</p>
<p>And because he is famous, we are seeing</p>
<p>a person really struggling in a moment that may need help.</p>
<p>And we owe it to him, not for what he said</p>
<p>because that stuff isn&rsquo;t excusable,</p>
<p>but we owe it to him to help him in a way.</p>
<p>And particularly his friends.</p>
<p>And if he has real friends, hopefully what they see</p>
<p>is that what I see on the outside looking in</p>
<p>is a person that is clearly struggling.</p>
<p>Can I ask you like a human question?</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s outside looking in,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s several questions I wanna ask.</p>
<p>So one is about the pain of going through a divorce</p>
<p>and having kids and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And two, when you&rsquo;re rich and powerful and famous,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can enlighten me</p>
<p>to which is the most corruptive.</p>
<p>But how do you know who are the friends to trust?</p>
<p>So a lot of the world is calling Kanye insane</p>
<p>or like has mental illness, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so how do you have friends close to you</p>
<p>that say something like that message,</p>
<p>but from a place of love</p>
<p>and where they actually care for you</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to get you to shut up?</p>
<p>The reason I ask all those questions, I think,</p>
<p>if you care about the guy, how do you help him?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a divorce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gut-wrenching.</p>
<p>The most horrible part is having to tell your kids.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even describe to you how proud I am</p>
<p>and how resilient these three beautiful little creatures</p>
<p>were when my ex-wife and I had to sit them down</p>
<p>and talk through it.</p>
<p>And for that thing, I&rsquo;ll be just so protective of them</p>
<p>and so proud of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s what he went through,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>In that moment, there&rsquo;s no fame, there&rsquo;s no money,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just the raw intimacy of a nuclear family</p>
<p>breaking up in that.</p>
<p>There is a death, and it&rsquo;s the death of that idea.</p>
<p>And that is extremely, extremely profound in its impact,</p>
<p>especially in your children.</p>
<p>It is really hard, really hard.</p>
<p>Could you have seen yourself in the way you see the world</p>
<p>being clouded during, especially at first,</p>
<p>to where you would make poor decisions</p>
<p>outside of that nuclear family?</p>
<p>So like poor business decisions, poor tweeting decisions,</p>
<p>poor writing decisions.</p>
<p>I think that if I had to boil down a lot of those,</p>
<p>what I would say is that there are moments in my life, Lex,</p>
<p>where I have felt meaningfully less than.</p>
<p>And in those moments, the loop that I would fall into</p>
<p>is I would look to cope and be seen by other people.</p>
<p>So I would throw away all of the work I was doing</p>
<p>around my own internal validation.</p>
<p>And I would try to say something or do something</p>
<p>that would get the attention of others.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, when that loop was unproductive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because those things had really crappy consequences.</p>
<p>So that was, yeah, so yeah, I went through that as well.</p>
<p>So I had to go through this disharmonious phase in my life</p>
<p>and then to repair it.</p>
<p>I had the benefit of meeting someone</p>
<p>and building a relationship block by block</p>
<p>where there was just enormous accountability,</p>
<p>where my partner Nat has just incredible empathy,</p>
<p>but accountability.</p>
<p>And so she can put herself in my shoes</p>
<p>sometimes when I&rsquo;m a really tough person to be around,</p>
<p>but then she doesn&rsquo;t let me off the hook.</p>
<p>She can forgive me, but it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>what I may have said or whatever excusable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been really healthy for me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s helped me repair my relationships,</p>
<p>be a better parent, be a better friend to my ex-wife,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a beautiful woman who I love deeply</p>
<p>and will always love her.</p>
<p>And it took me a few years to see that,</p>
<p>that it was just a chapter that had come to an end,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s an incredible mother</p>
<p>and an incredible business woman.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so thankful that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>two incredible women in my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a blessing.</p>
<p>To what it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So with Nat, it&rsquo;s hard to find a person that has that.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of stuff you said is pretty profound,</p>
<p>but having that person who has empathy and accountability.</p>
<p>So basically that&rsquo;s ultimately what great friendship is,</p>
<p>which is people that love you, have empathy for you,</p>
<p>but can also call you out on your bullshit.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a LeBron James-like figure.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>and met so many people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the distribution on the scale</p>
<p>of friendship and empathy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the LeBron James of friendship.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a goat.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s so funny is like,</p>
<p>we have a dinner around poker</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taken on a life of its own,</p>
<p>mostly because of her, because these guys look to her.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s taking like, her registers are already full.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s thinking of all kinds of crap with me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very innate skill and it&rsquo;s paired with,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just an emotional thing,</p>
<p>meaning she&rsquo;s the person that I make all my decisions with.</p>
<p>These decisions we&rsquo;re making together as a team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood that.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s that African proverb,</p>
<p>like go fast, go alone, go far, go together.</p>
<p>And Lex, since I was born, I was by myself</p>
<p>and I had to cope.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have a good toolkit to use into the world.</p>
<p>And in these last five or six years, she&rsquo;s helped me.</p>
<p>And at first my toolkit was literally like sticks, you know?</p>
<p>And then I found a way to, you know,</p>
<p>she helped me sharpen a little rock</p>
<p>and that became a little knife, but even that was crap.</p>
<p>And then she showed me fire and then I forged a knife.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it feels like.</p>
<p>Where now this toolkit is like most average people.</p>
<p>And I feel humbled to be average</p>
<p>because I was here, down here on the ground.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s made all these things more reasonable.</p>
<p>So I see what comes from having deep,</p>
<p>profound friendships and love</p>
<p>to help you through these critical moments.</p>
<p>I have another friend who I would say</p>
<p>just completely unabashedly loves me.</p>
<p>This guy, Rob Goldberg.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t hold me accountable that much, which I love.</p>
<p>Like I could say, I killed a homeless person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, ah, they probably deserve it.</p>
<p>You know, whereas Nat would be like,</p>
<p>that was not good, what you just did.</p>
<p>So, but I have both.</p>
<p>I mean, I have Nat every day.</p>
<p>You know, Rob, I don&rsquo;t talk to that often,</p>
<p>but to have two people, I had zero.</p>
<p>I think most people unfortunately have zero.</p>
<p>So I think like what he needs</p>
<p>is somebody to just listen.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to put a label on these things.</p>
<p>And you just have to try to guide</p>
<p>in these very unique moments</p>
<p>where you can just like deescalate</p>
<p>what is going on in your mind.</p>
<p>And I suspect what&rsquo;s going on in his mind,</p>
<p>again, to play armchair quarterback, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>is that he is in a moment</p>
<p>where he just feels lower than low.</p>
<p>And we all do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had these moments</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t know how to get attention.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t grow up in a healthy environment,</p>
<p>you may go through a negative way to get attention.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to excuse it, but it&rsquo;s to understand it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so profound, the feeling less than</p>
<p>and at those low points going externally to find it</p>
<p>and maybe creating conflict and scandal</p>
<p>to get that attention.</p>
<p>The way that my doctor explained it to me is</p>
<p>you have to think about your self-worth like a knot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inside of a very complicated set of knots.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like some people don&rsquo;t have these knots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just presented to you on a platter.</p>
<p>But for some of us, because of the way we grow up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s covered in all these knots.</p>
<p>So the whole goal is to loosen those knots.</p>
<p>And it happens slowly, it happens unpredictably,</p>
<p>and it takes a long time.</p>
<p>And so while you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>you are gonna have moments where when you feel less than,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not prepared to look inside and say,</p>
<p>actually, here&rsquo;s how I feel about myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool, I&rsquo;m happy with where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>I have to ask on the topic of friendship,</p>
<p>you do an amazing podcast called All In Podcast.</p>
<p>People should stop listening to this and go listen to that.</p>
<p>You just did your 100th episode.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite podcasts, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>For the technical and the human psychological wisdom</p>
<p>that you guys constantly give</p>
<p>in the way you analyze the world,</p>
<p>but also just the chemistry between you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clearly, there&rsquo;s a tension,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a camaraderie that&rsquo;s all laid out on the table.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know the two Davids that well,</p>
<p>but I have met Jason.</p>
<p>What do you love about him?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll give you a little psychological breakdown</p>
<p>of all three of these guys.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I love you guys.</p>
<p>Would they agree with your psychological breakdown?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that what I would say about Jekyll</p>
<p>is he is unbelievably loyal to no end.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like any of those movies</p>
<p>which are about the mafia or whatever,</p>
<p>where something bad&rsquo;s going wrong</p>
<p>and you need somebody to show up, that&rsquo;s Jekyll.</p>
<p>So if you killed the said proverbial homeless person,</p>
<p>he would be right there to help you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d bury the body. Yeah.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the one that he&rsquo;ll defend you</p>
<p>in every way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not, doesn&rsquo;t make sense in that moment.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t see that as an action</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;ll solve the problem.</p>
<p>He sees that as an act of devotion to you, your friend.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredible gift that he gives us.</p>
<p>The other side of it is that Jekyll needs to learn</p>
<p>how to trust that other people love him back</p>
<p>as much as he loves us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where he makes mistakes</p>
<p>because he assumes that he&rsquo;s not as lovable</p>
<p>as the rest of us.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s infinitely more lovable than he understands.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to see Lex, he is unbelievably funny.</p>
<p>I mean, I cannot tell you how funny this guy is.</p>
<p>Next level funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, his timing.</p>
<p>Timing. Everything, everything.</p>
<p>Charm, the care he takes.</p>
<p>So he is as lovable, but he doesn&rsquo;t believe himself to be.</p>
<p>And that manifests itself in areas</p>
<p>that drive us all crazy from time to time.</p>
<p>Which makes it for a very pleasant listening experience.</p>
<p>Okay, so what about the two Davids?</p>
<p>David Sachs and David Friedberg?</p>
<p>David Sachs is the one that I would say</p>
<p>I have the most emotional connection with.</p>
<p>He and I can go a year without talking</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk for four hours straight.</p>
<p>And then we know where we are.</p>
<p>And we have this ability to pick up</p>
<p>and have a level of intimacy with each other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;ve known David</p>
<p>for so long now.</p>
<p>That I find really comforting.</p>
<p>And then Friedberg is this person who I think similar to me</p>
<p>had a very turbulent upbringing,</p>
<p>has fought through it to build an incredible life</p>
<p>for himself.</p>
<p>And I have this enormous respect for his journey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly care about his outcomes, to be honest.</p>
<p>But I just have, I look at that guy and I think,</p>
<p>he did it.</p>
<p>And so if I didn&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>I would be glad that he did it.</p>
<p>If it makes any sense.</p>
<p>And you can see that he feels like his entire responsibility</p>
<p>is really around his kids.</p>
<p>And to kind of like give a better counterfactual.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think he gets that right and wrong.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a very special human being that way.</p>
<p>On that show, the two of you have a very kind of,</p>
<p>like from a geopolitics perspective,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s just a very effective way</p>
<p>to think deeply about the world,</p>
<p>the big picture of the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very systems level thinker,</p>
<p>which I really, really like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to put it, yeah.</p>
<p>Very, very.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Very systems level.</p>
<p>So looking at everything.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very rooted in a broad body of knowledge,</p>
<p>which I have a tremendous respect for.</p>
<p>He brings all these things in.</p>
<p>Sachs is incredible</p>
<p>because he has this unbelievable understanding of things,</p>
<p>but it has a core nucleus.</p>
<p>So Freeberg can just basically abstract</p>
<p>a whole bunch of systems and talk about it.</p>
<p>I tend to be more like that,</p>
<p>where I try to kind of, I find it to be more of a puzzle.</p>
<p>Sachs is more like anchored in a philosophical</p>
<p>and historical context as the answer.</p>
<p>And he starts there,</p>
<p>but he gets to these profound understandings</p>
<p>of systems as well.</p>
<p>On the podcast, in life,</p>
<p>you guys hold to your opinion pretty strong.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret to being able</p>
<p>to argue passionately with friends?</p>
<p>So hold your position,</p>
<p>but also not murder each other,</p>
<p>which you guys seem to come close to.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like strong opinions, weakly held.</p>
<p>So I think that they&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Wait, is that a haiku or is it?</p>
<p>Can you explain that please?</p>
<p>You know, like, look, today, you and I,</p>
<p>what have we, we steel man,</p>
<p>like the two sides of three different things.</p>
<p>Now you could be confused</p>
<p>and think I believe in those things.</p>
<p>I believe that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to be able to intellectually traverse there,</p>
<p>whether I believe in it or not.</p>
<p>And like steel man, not strong man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really-</p>
<p>But we intro those things by saying,</p>
<p>let us steel man this position.</p>
<p>Sometimes you guys skip the-</p>
<p>We skip, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We edit those things out</p>
<p>and sometimes we&rsquo;ll sit on either sides</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll just kind of bat things back and forth</p>
<p>just to see what the other person thinks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how, like, as fans,</p>
<p>we should listen to that sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, so sometimes,</p>
<p>because you hold a strong opinion sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, for example, the cost of energy going to zero.</p>
<p>Is that, like, what&rsquo;s the degree of certainty on that?</p>
<p>Is this kind of like you really taking a prediction</p>
<p>of how the world will unroll?</p>
<p>And if it does, this will benefit a huge amount</p>
<p>of companies and people that will believe that idea.</p>
<p>So you really, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you spend a few days, a few weeks with that idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending two years with that idea.</p>
<p>And that idea has manifested into many pages and pages</p>
<p>of more and more branches of a tree.</p>
<p>But it started with that idea.</p>
<p>So if you think about this tree,</p>
<p>this logical tree that I built,</p>
<p>I would consider it more of a mosaic.</p>
<p>And at the base or root,</p>
<p>however you want to talk about it,</p>
<p>is this idea, the incremental cost of energy goes to zero.</p>
<p>How does it manifest?</p>
<p>And so I talked about one traversal,</p>
<p>which is the competition of households versus utilities.</p>
<p>But if even some of that comes to pass,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see a bunch of other implications</p>
<p>from a regulatory and technology perspective.</p>
<p>If some of those come to pass,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve tried to think sort of this,</p>
<p>you know, six, seven, eight hops forward.</p>
<p>And I have some, like to use the chess analogy,</p>
<p>I have a bunch of short lines, which I think can work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve started to test those by making investments,</p>
<p>tens of millions over here to a hundred millions over there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a distribution based on how probabilistic</p>
<p>I think these outcomes are</p>
<p>and how downside protected I can be</p>
<p>and how much I will learn,</p>
<p>how many mistakes I can make, you know, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then very quickly over the next two years,</p>
<p>some of those things will happen or not happen</p>
<p>and I will rapidly re-underwrite.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll rewrite that tree</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll get some more data,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make some more investments</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll rapidly re-underwrite.</p>
<p>So, you know, in order for me to get to this tree,</p>
<p>maybe you can ask, how did I get there?</p>
<p>It was complete accident.</p>
<p>The way that it happened was I have a friend of mine</p>
<p>who works at a great organization called Fortress.</p>
<p>His name is Drew McKnight.</p>
<p>And he called me one day and he said,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m doing a deal, will you anchor it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going public.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a rare earth mining company.</p>
<p>And I said, Drew, like if I&rsquo;m gonna get tarred</p>
<p>and feathered in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>for backing a mining company.</p>
<p>And he said, Chamath, just talk to the guy and learn.</p>
<p>And the guy, Jim Latinsky blew me away.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s what it means for energy</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what it means for the supply chain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it means for the United States versus China.</p>
<p>But Lex, I did that deal and then I did seven others.</p>
<p>And that deal made money, the seven others did not.</p>
<p>But I learned, I made enough mistakes</p>
<p>where the net of it was I got to a thesis</p>
<p>that I believed in, I could see it.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, I paid the price.</p>
<p>I acquired the learning.</p>
<p>I made my mistakes.</p>
<p>I know where I am at.</p>
<p>And this is step one.</p>
<p>And then I learned a little bit more.</p>
<p>I made some more investments.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I do the job.</p>
<p>The minute that you try to wait for perfection</p>
<p>in order to make a bet either on yourself</p>
<p>or a company, a girlfriend, whatever, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>So if we just linger on that tree,</p>
<p>it seems like a lot of geopolitics,</p>
<p>a lot of international military even conflict</p>
<p>is around energy.</p>
<p>So how does your thinking about energy</p>
<p>connect to what you see happening in the next 10, 20 years?</p>
<p>Maybe you can look at the war in Ukraine</p>
<p>or relationship with China and other places</p>
<p>through this lens of energy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hopeful, what&rsquo;s the cynical trajectory</p>
<p>that the world might take with this drive</p>
<p>towards zero energy, zero cost energy?</p>
<p>So the United States was in a period of energy surplus</p>
<p>until the last few years, some number of years in Trump.</p>
<p>And I think some number of now the current administration</p>
<p>with President Biden.</p>
<p>But we know what it means</p>
<p>to basically have more than enough energy</p>
<p>to fund our own domestic manufacturing and living standards.</p>
<p>And I think that by being able to generate this energy</p>
<p>from the sun, that is very capex efficient,</p>
<p>that is very climate efficient, gives us a huge tailwind.</p>
<p>The second thing is that we are now in a world,</p>
<p>in a regime for many years to come</p>
<p>of non-zero interest rates.</p>
<p>And it may interest you to know</p>
<p>that really the last time</p>
<p>that we had long dated wars supported</p>
<p>at low interest rates was World War II,</p>
<p>where I think the average interest rates</p>
<p>was like 1.07% in the 10 year.</p>
<p>And every other war tends to have</p>
<p>these very quick open and closes</p>
<p>because these long protracted fights</p>
<p>get very difficult to finance when rates are non-zero.</p>
<p>So just as an example, even starting in 2023,</p>
<p>so the practical example today in the United States</p>
<p>is President Biden&rsquo;s budget is about 1.5 trillion</p>
<p>for next year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not including the entitlement spending, okay?</p>
<p>Meaning Medicare, Social Security, right?</p>
<p>So the stuff that he wants to spend</p>
<p>that he has discretion over is about 1.582 trillion</p>
<p>is the exact number.</p>
<p>Next year, our interest payments</p>
<p>are going to be $455 billion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 29% of every budget dollar is going to pay interest.</p>
<p>So you have these two worlds coming together, right, Lex?</p>
<p>If you have us hurtling forward</p>
<p>to being able to generate our own energy</p>
<p>and the economic peril that comes</p>
<p>with trying to underwrite several trillion dollars for war,</p>
<p>which we can&rsquo;t afford to pay when rates are at 5%,</p>
<p>means that despite all the bluster,</p>
<p>the probabilistic distribution of us engaging in war</p>
<p>with Russia and Ukraine seems relatively low.</p>
<p>The override would obviously be a moral reason to do it</p>
<p>that may or may not come</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>But now you have to steel man</p>
<p>the other side of the equation,</p>
<p>which is, well, what were to happen</p>
<p>if you were sitting there and you were Putin?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s steel man setting off a tactical nuke someplace.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m getting calls every other day</p>
<p>from my two largest energy buyers, India and China,</p>
<p>telling me, slow my roll.</p>
<p>I have the entire world looking to find the final excuse</p>
<p>to turn me off and unplug me from the entire world economy.</p>
<p>The only morally reprehensible thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s left in my arsenal</p>
<p>that could do all of these things together</p>
<p>would be to set off a tactical nuke.</p>
<p>I would be the only person since World War II</p>
<p>to have done that.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like it&rsquo;s a really, really,</p>
<p>really big step to take.</p>
<p>And so I think that X of the clamoring for war</p>
<p>that the military industrial complex wants us to buy into,</p>
<p>the financial reasons to do it</p>
<p>and the natural resources needs to do it</p>
<p>are making it very unlikely.</p>
<p>That is not just true for us.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also true for Europe.</p>
<p>I think the European economy is going to roll over.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going, I see a very hard landing for them,</p>
<p>which means that if the economy slows down,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be less need for energy.</p>
<p>And so it starts to become a thing</p>
<p>where a negotiated settlement</p>
<p>is actually the win-win for everybody.</p>
<p>But none of this would be possible</p>
<p>without zero interest rates.</p>
<p>In a world of zero interest rates, we would be in war.</p>
<p>So you believe in the financial forces</p>
<p>and pressures overpowering the human ones?</p>
<p>I believe in the invisible hand.</p>
<p>I really do believe in the invisible hand.</p>
<p>Even in international war?</p>
<p>More so there.</p>
<p>I think the invisible hand,</p>
<p>and by the invisible hand for the audience,</p>
<p>I think really what it means is</p>
<p>the financial complex and really the central bank complex</p>
<p>and the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy</p>
<p>is a very convoluted and complicated set of things.</p>
<p>But if we had zero interest rates,</p>
<p>we would be probably in the middle of it now.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s a complexity to this game</p>
<p>at the international level</p>
<p>where some nations are authoritarian</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s significant corruption.</p>
<p>And so that adds, from a game theoretic optimal perspective,</p>
<p>you know, the invisible hand is operating in the mud.</p>
<p>Preventing war.</p>
<p>The person that is the most important figure</p>
<p>in the world right now is Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>He is probably doing more to prevent war than anybody else.</p>
<p>He keeps ratcheting rates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical impossibility for the United States</p>
<p>unless there is such a cataclysmic</p>
<p>moral transgression by Russia.</p>
<p>So there is tail risk that it is possible</p>
<p>where we say, forget it, all bets are off.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going back to zero rates.</p>
<p>Issue a hundred year bond.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna finance a war machine.</p>
<p>There is a small risk of that.</p>
<p>But I think the majority of outcomes</p>
<p>is more of a negotiated settlement.</p>
<p>So what about, I mean,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the motivation of Putin</p>
<p>to invade Ukraine in the first place?</p>
<p>If financial forces are the most</p>
<p>powerful forces, why did it happen?</p>
<p>Because it seems like there&rsquo;s other forces at play</p>
<p>of maintaining superpower status on the world stage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It seems like geopolitics doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>just with the invisible hand in consideration.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t beg to know, to be honest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But he did it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s easier for me</p>
<p>to guess the outcome from here.</p>
<p>It would have been impossible for me to really understand.</p>
<p>It is what got him to this place.</p>
<p>But it seems like there&rsquo;s an end game here</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not much playability.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m on unsteady ground</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s been so many experts</p>
<p>at every stage of this that have been wrong.</p>
<p>Well, there are no experts.</p>
<p>Well, on this.</p>
<p>There are no experts, Lex.</p>
<p>I understand this.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s dig into that.</p>
<p>Because we just said Phil Hellmuth</p>
<p>is the greatest poker player of all time.</p>
<p>He has an opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t, they would be mistaken.</p>
<p>Phil, are you an expert at poker?</p>
<p>Phil has an opinion.</p>
<p>Ivy has an opinion as well on how to play all these games.</p>
<p>Meaning an opinion means here&rsquo;s the lines I take,</p>
<p>here are the decisions I make.</p>
<p>I live and die by those.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m right, I win.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong, I lose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made more mistakes than my opponent.</p>
<p>I thought you said there&rsquo;s an optimal.</p>
<p>So aren&rsquo;t there people that have a deeper understanding,</p>
<p>a higher likelihood of being able to describe</p>
<p>and know the optimal, the optimal set of actions here</p>
<p>at every layer?</p>
<p>Well, there may be a theoretically</p>
<p>set of optimal decisions,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t play your life against a computer.</p>
<p>Like meaning the minute that you face an opponent</p>
<p>and that person takes you off that optimal path,</p>
<p>you have to adjust.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like what happens if a tactical nuke?</p>
<p>It would be really bad.</p>
<p>I think the world is resilient enough.</p>
<p>I think the Ukrainians are resilient enough to overcome it.</p>
<p>It would be really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an incredibly sad moment in human history.</p>
<p>But do you wonder what US does?</p>
<p>Is there any understanding?</p>
<p>Do you think people inside the United States understand?</p>
<p>Not the regular citizens, but people in the military.</p>
<p>Do you think Joe Biden understands?</p>
<p>Do you think-</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden does understand.</p>
<p>I think that-</p>
<p>You think they have a clear plan?</p>
<p>I think that there are few reasons</p>
<p>to let the gerontocracy rule,</p>
<p>but this is one of the reasons</p>
<p>where I think they are better adept than other people.</p>
<p>You know, folks that were around during the Bay of Pigs,</p>
<p>folks that hopefully have studied that</p>
<p>and studied nuclear de-escalation</p>
<p>will have a better playbook than I do.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that there is a,</p>
<p>in an emergency break glass plan.</p>
<p>And I think before military intervention or anything else,</p>
<p>I think that there are an enormous number</p>
<p>of financial sanctions that you can do</p>
<p>to just completely cripple Russia</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t undertaken yet.</p>
<p>And if you couple that with an economic system in Europe</p>
<p>that is less and less in need of energy,</p>
<p>because it is going into a recession,</p>
<p>it makes it easier for them to be able to walk away</p>
<p>while the US ships a bunch of LNG over there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know the game theory on all of this,</p>
<p>but does it make you nervous</p>
<p>that or are we just being temperamental?</p>
<p>It feels like the world hangs in a balance.</p>
<p>Like it feels like, at least from my naive perspective,</p>
<p>I thought we were getting to a place</p>
<p>where surely human civilization can&rsquo;t destroy itself.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a presentation of what looks like a hot war</p>
<p>where multiple parties involved in escalating,</p>
<p>escalation towards a world war</p>
<p>is not entirely out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I would really, really hope that he is spending time</p>
<p>with his two young twins.</p>
<p>Well, this is part of what I-</p>
<p>I really hope he&rsquo;s spending time with his kids.</p>
<p>Agreed, but not kids, not just kids, but friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that he may not have friends,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard for anybody to look at their kids</p>
<p>and not think about protecting the future.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s partially because of the pandemic,</p>
<p>but partially because of the nature of power,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re surrounded by people</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t trust more and more.</p>
<p>I do think the pandemic had an effect on that too,</p>
<p>the isolating effect.</p>
<p>A lot of people were not their best selves</p>
<p>during the pandemic.</p>
<p>From a super heavy topic, let me go back to the space</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re one of the most successful people in the world.</p>
<p>How to build companies, how to find good companies,</p>
<p>what it takes to find good companies,</p>
<p>what it takes to build good companies.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for someone</p>
<p>who wants to build the next super successful startup</p>
<p>in the tech space and have a chance to be impactful,</p>
<p>like Facebook, Apple?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s the key word.</p>
<p>If your precondition is to start something successful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already failed</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re playing somebody else&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>What success means is not clear.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re walking into the woods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s murky, it&rsquo;s dark, it&rsquo;s wet, it&rsquo;s raining.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these animals about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no comfort there.</p>
<p>So you better really like hiking.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no short way to shortcut that.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious what success is?</p>
<p>Like success is scale, so it&rsquo;s not, what are the-</p>
<p>No, I think that there&rsquo;s a very brittle, basic definition</p>
<p>of success that&rsquo;s outside in,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not what it is.</p>
<p>I know people that are much, much, much richer than I am,</p>
<p>and they are just so completely broken.</p>
<p>And I think to myself,</p>
<p>the only difference between you and me</p>
<p>is outsider&rsquo;s perception of your wealth versus mine.</p>
<p>But the happiness and the joy that I have</p>
<p>in the simple, basic routines of my life</p>
<p>give me enormous joy.</p>
<p>And so I feel successful,</p>
<p>no matter what anybody says about my success</p>
<p>or lack of success.</p>
<p>There are people that live normal lives,</p>
<p>that have good jobs, that have good families.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this like idyllic sense,</p>
<p>like I see it on TikTok all the time, so I know it exists.</p>
<p>These neighborhoods where there&rsquo;s like a cul-de-sac</p>
<p>and these beautiful homes and these kids are biking around.</p>
<p>And every time I see that, Lex,</p>
<p>I immediately flashback to what I didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Look at how happy those kids are.</p>
<p>So no, there is no one definition.</p>
<p>And so if people are starting out</p>
<p>to try to make a million dollars,</p>
<p>a hundred million dollars, a billion dollars,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a definition of personal success,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some level of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different from person to person,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some level of the responsibility you have</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a mission to have a positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure that Elon is happy.</p>
<p>No, in fact, I think if you focus</p>
<p>on trying to have an impact on the world,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna end up deeply unhappy.</p>
<p>But does that matter?</p>
<p>Like why does your own personal happiness matter?</p>
<p>It may happen as a byproduct,</p>
<p>but I think that you should strive</p>
<p>to find your own personal happiness</p>
<p>and then measure how that manifests</p>
<p>as it relates to society and to other people.</p>
<p>But if the answer to those questions is zero,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make you less of a person.</p>
<p>No, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>But then the other way,</p>
<p>is there times when you need to sacrifice</p>
<p>your own personal happiness for a bigger thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve created?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re in a position to do it,</p>
<p>I think some folks are tested.</p>
<p>Elon is probably the best example.</p>
<p>And it must be really, really hard to be him.</p>
<p>Really hard.</p>
<p>I have enormous levels of empathy and care for him.</p>
<p>I really love him as a person</p>
<p>because I just see that it&rsquo;s not that fun.</p>
<p>And he has these ways of being human</p>
<p>that in his position, I just think are so dear</p>
<p>that if he never, I just hope he never loses them.</p>
<p>Just a simple example, like two days ago,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I went on Twitter</p>
<p>and I saw the perfume thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, ah, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go buy some perfume.</p>
<p>So I bought his perfume, the burnt hair thing.</p>
<p>And I said, and I emailed him the receipt</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, all right, you got me for a bottle.</p>
<p>And he responded in like eight seconds</p>
<p>and it was just a smiley face or whatever.</p>
<p>Just deeply normal things that you do amongst people</p>
<p>that are just, so nobody sees that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But it would be, he deserves for that stuff to be seen</p>
<p>because the rest of his life is so brutally hard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a normal guy that is just caught</p>
<p>in this ultra mega vortex.</p>
<p>Why do you think there&rsquo;s so few elons?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extremely lonely set of trade-offs.</p>
<p>Because to your point, if you get tested,</p>
<p>so if you think about it again probabilistically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 8 billion people in the world.</p>
<p>Maybe 50 of them get put in a position</p>
<p>where they are building something</p>
<p>of such colossal importance that they even have this choice.</p>
<p>And then of that 50, maybe 10 of them are put in a moment</p>
<p>where they actually have to make a trade-off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be able to see your family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making this up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be able to see your family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to basically move into your factory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to sleep on the floor.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the outcome, energy independence</p>
<p>and resource abundance and a massive peace dividend.</p>
<p>And then he says to himself, I don&rsquo;t know that he did</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never had this.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what, that&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>And then you look at your kids and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making this decision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain that to you.</p>
<p>You wanna be in that position?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no amount of money</p>
<p>where I would wanna be in that position.</p>
<p>So that takes an enormous fortitude</p>
<p>and a moral compass that he has.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think people need</p>
<p>to appreciate about that guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also on the first number you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s confusing that there&rsquo;s 50 people or 10 people</p>
<p>like that are put in the position</p>
<p>to have that level of impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear that that has to be that way.</p>
<p>It seems like there could be much more.</p>
<p>There should be, there&rsquo;s definitely people</p>
<p>with the potential.</p>
<p>But think about his journey.</p>
<p>His mom had to leave a very complicated environment,</p>
<p>moved to Canada, moved to Toronto,</p>
<p>a small apartment just north of Bayon Bloor,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever been to Toronto.</p>
<p>I remember talking to her about this apartment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so crazy because I used to live</p>
<p>like around the corner from that place</p>
<p>and raise these three kids and just have to.</p>
<p>So how many people are gonna start</p>
<p>with those boundary conditions?</p>
<p>And really grind it out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very few people in the end</p>
<p>that will have the resiliency to stick it through</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t give into the self-doubt.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really, it&rsquo;s just a really hard set</p>
<p>of boundary conditions where you can have 50</p>
<p>or 100 of these people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they needed to be really,</p>
<p>they need to be really appreciated.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s true for all humans</p>
<p>that follow the thread of their passion</p>
<p>and do something beautiful in this world.</p>
<p>That could be on a small scale or a big scale.</p>
<p>Appreciation is, that&rsquo;s a gift you give</p>
<p>to the other person, but also a gift to yourself.</p>
<p>That somehow it becomes like this contagious thing.</p>
<p>I went to this, you are so right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, my brain just lit up</p>
<p>because yesterday I went to an investor day</p>
<p>of my friend of mine, this guy, Brad Gerstner.</p>
<p>And on the one very reductive world,</p>
<p>Brad and I are theoretically competitors, but we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>He makes his own set of decisions.</p>
<p>I make my own set of decisions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both trying to do our own view</p>
<p>of what is good work in the world,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been profoundly successful.</p>
<p>And it was really the first moment of my adult life</p>
<p>where I could sit in a moment like that</p>
<p>and really be appreciative of his success</p>
<p>and not feel less than.</p>
<p>And so, a little selfishly for me,</p>
<p>but mostly for him as well,</p>
<p>I was so proud to be in the room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my friend.</p>
<p>That guy plays poker with me every Thursday.</p>
<p>He is crushing it.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s a really amazing feeling.</p>
<p>I mean, to linger on the trade-offs,</p>
<p>the complicated trade-offs with all of this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your take on work-life balance</p>
<p>in a company that&rsquo;s trying to do big things?</p>
<p>I think that you have to have</p>
<p>some very, very strict boundaries,</p>
<p>but otherwise I think balance is kind of dumb.</p>
<p>It will make you limited.</p>
<p>I think you need to immerse yourself in the problem,</p>
<p>but you need to define that immersion with boundaries.</p>
<p>So if you ask me, what does my process look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s monotonous and regimented,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all the time except when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also monotonous and regimented.</p>
<p>Um, and I think that makes me very good at my craft</p>
<p>because it gives me what I need</p>
<p>to stay connected to the problem</p>
<p>without feeling resentful about the problem.</p>
<p>Which part, the monotonous all-in nature of it,</p>
<p>or the, when you say hard boundaries,</p>
<p>essentially go all out until you stop,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t stop often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a little bit of a quandary right now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to redefine my goals.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re catching me in a moment where</p>
<p>I have, even in these last few years of evolution,</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve made some good progress,</p>
<p>but in one very specific way, I&rsquo;m still very reptilian.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to let go.</p>
<p>Which way is that exactly?</p>
<p>If you can-</p>
<p>You know, in my business, it really gets reduced</p>
<p>to what is your annual rate of compounding?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my demarcation.</p>
<p>You know, Steph Curry and LeBron James, Michael Jordan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how many points did you average?</p>
<p>Not just in a season, but over your career.</p>
<p>You know, and in their case,</p>
<p>to really be the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s points, rebounds, assists, steals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of measures to be, you know,</p>
<p>in that pantheon of being really, really good at your craft.</p>
<p>And in my business, it&rsquo;s very reductive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how well have you compounded?</p>
<p>And if you look at all the heroes</p>
<p>that I have put on a pedestal in my mind,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve compounded, you know,</p>
<p>at above 30% for a very long time, as have I.</p>
<p>But now I feel like I really need to let go</p>
<p>because I think I know how to do the basics of my job.</p>
<p>And if I had to summarize like an investing challenge</p>
<p>or investing, I think really it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>when you first start out investing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a momentum person.</p>
<p>You saw it in GameStop,</p>
<p>just a bunch of people aping each other.</p>
<p>And then it goes from momentum</p>
<p>to you start to think about cash flows.</p>
<p>You know, how much profit is this person gonna make?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the evolution, you know?</p>
<p>This is the basic thing to,</p>
<p>this is a reasonably sophisticated way.</p>
<p>Then a much smaller group of people</p>
<p>think about it in terms of macro geopolitics.</p>
<p>But then a very finite few crack this special code,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s a philosophy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the philosophy that creates the system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m scratching at that furiously,</p>
<p>but I cannot break through and I haven&rsquo;t broken through.</p>
<p>And I know that in order to break through,</p>
<p>I gotta let go.</p>
<p>So this is the journey that I&rsquo;m in as in my,</p>
<p>in my professional life.</p>
<p>So it is an all-consuming thing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always home for dinner.</p>
<p>You know, we have very prescribed moments</p>
<p>where we take vacation.</p>
<p>The weekends, you know, like if I,</p>
<p>I can tell you about my week if you&rsquo;re curious,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>I would love, I would love to know your week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s since it&rsquo;s regimented and monotonous.</p>
<p>I woke up, I wake up at 6.45,</p>
<p>get the kids, go downstairs.</p>
<p>We all have some form of, you know,</p>
<p>not super healthy breakfast.</p>
<p>I make a latte.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become in, and the latte is like,</p>
<p>I have a machine.</p>
<p>I measure the beans.</p>
<p>You know, I make sure that the timer is such</p>
<p>where I have to pull it for a certain specific ratio.</p>
<p>You know, just so you know, 20 grams,</p>
<p>I got to pull 30 grams with the water.</p>
<p>And I got, you know, I got to do it in 30 seconds, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a coffee snob.</p>
<p>It helps me stay in rhythm.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Before I used to have another machine,</p>
<p>I just pushed a button.</p>
<p>But then I would push the button religiously</p>
<p>in the exact same way.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Okay, can I say actually on that topic,</p>
<p>you know, the morning with kids</p>
<p>can be a pretty stressful thing.</p>
<p>Are you able to find sort of happiness?</p>
<p>Is that also that morning is a source of happiness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>My kids are lovely.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re maniacs.</p>
<p>I just see, you know, and maybe I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never asked Friedberg this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just put my words.</p>
<p>I see all of the things in moments</p>
<p>where there was no compassion given to me.</p>
<p>And so I just give them a ton of love and compassion.</p>
<p>I have an infinite patience for my children,</p>
<p>not for other kids.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>But for my kids.</p>
<p>So anyway, so we have a breakfast thing.</p>
<p>And then I go upstairs and I go,</p>
<p>I change and I work out from eight to nine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the first 15 minutes</p>
<p>I walk up on a steep incline, you know,</p>
<p>12 to 14%, you know, three and a half</p>
<p>to four miles per hour walk.</p>
<p>And then, you know, Monday&rsquo;s a push day,</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s front of the legs,</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s pull, Thursday&rsquo;s back of the legs.</p>
<p>Eight to nine.</p>
<p>Monday, I always start,</p>
<p>I talk to my therapist from nine to 10.</p>
<p>So as soon as I finished working out,</p>
<p>I get on the phone and I talk to him.</p>
<p>And it helps me lock in for the week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just talking about the past.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just helping me.</p>
<p>The recent past?</p>
<p>Usually, sometimes the recent past,</p>
<p>but usually it&rsquo;s about the past past.</p>
<p>Something that I remember when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the work</p>
<p>about just loosening those knots, you know?</p>
<p>So I put in that hour of work, respect that hour.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m in the office.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, you know, I go until 12, 15, 12, 30,</p>
<p>go home, have lunch, like a proper,</p>
<p>like go home, sit down, have lunch with Nat, talk.</p>
<p>She leaves her work and we talk, how are we doing?</p>
<p>You know, just check in.</p>
<p>Our youngest daughter will be there</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s one and she&rsquo;s making a mess.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll have another coffee.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, my limit for the day.</p>
<p>Oh, no more caffeine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And then I go back to the office</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be there until six, seven sometimes.</p>
<p>And I do that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.</p>
<p>Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowed to have meetings.</p>
<p>Wednesday, nothing, it&rsquo;s all reading, must be.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s a complete emergency,</p>
<p>it has to be kind of a full reading.</p>
<p>Reading is a bunch of blogs, YouTube videos.</p>
<p>So no, try not to do any talking.</p>
<p>No talking, it&rsquo;s like being in silence,</p>
<p>being present, thinking about things.</p>
<p>By the way, how do you take notes?</p>
<p>Do you have a-</p>
<p>A sketch, I have a pad and I write stuff down.</p>
<p>Sometimes I go to my phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little all over the place.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do Google Docs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, this is one thing</p>
<p>I need to get better at actually.</p>
<p>But typically what happens is</p>
<p>I actually do a lot of thinking in my mind</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sort of filing a lot of stuff away.</p>
<p>And then it all spills out and then I have to write.</p>
<p>And then that gives me a body of work</p>
<p>that I can evaluate and think about.</p>
<p>And then I usually put it away.</p>
<p>And a lot of the time it goes nowhere.</p>
<p>But every now and then I come back to it</p>
<p>and it just unlocks two or three things</p>
<p>and I have a sense of how else I&rsquo;m thinking about things.</p>
<p>And then Friday at the end of the day,</p>
<p>Nat and I talked to a couples therapist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about checking out properly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, now it&rsquo;s like focusing.</p>
<p>The weekend is family, being present, being aware.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s email, obviously.</p>
<p>If I have to do meetings from time to time, no problem.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s boundaries.</p>
<p>Checking out properly.</p>
<p>Oh man, that is so powerful.</p>
<p>Just like officially transitioning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So these are really important boundaries</p>
<p>so that I can be immersed.</p>
<p>And what that means is like, look,</p>
<p>on a Saturday afternoon, on a random day,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll be like, where&rsquo;s Chamath?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be up in my room.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve found a podcast talking about like a thesis,</p>
<p>which is like ductal cancer in situ</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been fascinated about breast cancer surgeries</p>
<p>for a while and learning about that.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast about thesis.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, ductal cancer in situ.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>And so I have time to continue</p>
<p>to just constantly learning, learning,</p>
<p>putting stuff in my memory banks to organize into something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a week.</p>
<p>But then in these fixed moments of time,</p>
<p>phone down, everything down.</p>
<p>We go on vacation, we go on a boat,</p>
<p>we go to whatever, where it&rsquo;s just us and the kids.</p>
<p>Is there a structure when you&rsquo;re at work?</p>
<p>Is there a structure to your day in terms of meetings,</p>
<p>in terms of South Side of Wednesday?</p>
<p>You know, cause you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Have to keep meetings to less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Have to.</p>
<p>And, you know, oftentimes meetings can be as short</p>
<p>as like 10 or 15 minutes because then I&rsquo;m just like, okay.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m trying to reinforce that it&rsquo;s very rare</p>
<p>that we all have something really important to say.</p>
<p>And so the ritual that is becomes really valuable</p>
<p>to get scale is not the ritual of meetings,</p>
<p>but the ritual of respecting the collective time</p>
<p>of the unit.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, you know what, folks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna assume that you guys are also tackling</p>
<p>really important projects.</p>
<p>You also wanna have good boundaries in this immersion.</p>
<p>Go back to your kids and have dinner with them every night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just for me, it&rsquo;s for you.</p>
<p>So how about this?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you go and do your work?</p>
<p>This meeting didn&rsquo;t need to be 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It could be five.</p>
<p>And the rest of the time is yours.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird because when people join that system</p>
<p>at Social Capital, they just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like FaceTime and it&rsquo;s like, let me make sure,</p>
<p>and let me talk a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>I respect the person that says nothing for two years</p>
<p>and the first thing that they say is not obvious.</p>
<p>That person is immensely more valuable</p>
<p>than the person that tries to talk all the time.</p>
<p>What have you learned from your,</p>
<p>so after Facebook, you started Social Capital,</p>
<p>or what is now called Social Capital.</p>
<p>What have you learned from all the successful investing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done there?</p>
<p>About investing or about life?</p>
<p>Or about running a team?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very loath to give advice</p>
<p>because I think so much of it is situational,</p>
<p>but my observation is that starting a business</p>
<p>is really hard, any kind of business.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And as a result, we make enormous mistakes.</p>
<p>But I would summarize this,</p>
<p>and this may be a little heterodoxical.</p>
<p>I think there are only three kinds of mistakes.</p>
<p>Because if we go back to what we said before,</p>
<p>in the business, it&rsquo;s just learning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exploring the dark space</p>
<p>to get to the answer faster than other people.</p>
<p>And those, the mistakes that you make are three.</p>
<p>Or the three kinds of decisions, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hire somebody and they&rsquo;re really, really,</p>
<p>really average, but they&rsquo;re a really good person.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hire somebody and they really weren&rsquo;t candid</p>
<p>with who they are and their real personality</p>
<p>and their morality and their ethics</p>
<p>only expose them over a long period of time.</p>
<p>And then you hire somebody and they&rsquo;re not that good.</p>
<p>Morally, but they&rsquo;re highly performant.</p>
<p>What do you do with those three things?</p>
<p>And I think successful companies have figured out</p>
<p>how to answer those three things,</p>
<p>because those are the things that, in my opinion,</p>
<p>determine success and failure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically hiring and you just identified</p>
<p>three failure cases for hiring.</p>
<p>But very different failure cases</p>
<p>and very complicated ones, right?</p>
<p>Like the highly performant person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not that great as a human being.</p>
<p>Do you keep them around?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people would err</p>
<p>towards keeping that person around.</p>
<p>What is the right answer?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s the context of the situation.</p>
<p>And the second one is also very tricky.</p>
<p>What about if they really turned out</p>
<p>that they were just not candid with who they are</p>
<p>and it took you a long time to figure out who you were?</p>
<p>These are all mistakes of the senior person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running this organization.</p>
<p>I think if you can learn to manage those situations well,</p>
<p>those are the real edge cases where you can make mistakes</p>
<p>that are fatal to a company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned over 11 and a half years, honestly.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the business of investing,</p>
<p>I feel that it&rsquo;s a secret.</p>
<p>And if you are willing to just keep chipping away,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll peel back enough of these, you know,</p>
<p>layers will come off and you&rsquo;ll see it,</p>
<p>the scales will come off and you&rsquo;ll eventually see it.</p>
<p>I really struggle with,</p>
<p>maybe you can be my therapist for a little bit,</p>
<p>with that first case which you originally mentioned.</p>
<p>Because I love people, I see the good in people,</p>
<p>I really struggle with just a mediocre performing person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a good human being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that those are incredibly important and useful people.</p>
<p>I think that if a company is like a body,</p>
<p>they are like cartilage.</p>
<p>Can you replace cartilage?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But would you if he didn&rsquo;t have to?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, can I play devil&rsquo;s advocate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So those folks, because of their goodness,</p>
<p>make it okay to be mediocre.</p>
<p>They create a culture where,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s important in life,</p>
<p>which is something I agree in my personal life,</p>
<p>is to be good to each other, to be friendly,</p>
<p>to be good vibes, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You know, when I was at Google,</p>
<p>just like the good atmosphere,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s playing and just, it&rsquo;s fun, fun, right?</p>
<p>But to me, like when I put on my hat</p>
<p>of like having a mission and a goal,</p>
<p>what I love to see is the superstars that shine in some way.</p>
<p>Like do something incredible.</p>
<p>And I want everyone to also admire those superstars.</p>
<p>Perhaps not just for the productivity&rsquo;s sake</p>
<p>or performing or successful company&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>but because that too is an incredible thing</p>
<p>that humans are able to accomplish, which is shine.</p>
<p>I hear you, but that&rsquo;s not a decision you make.</p>
<p>Meaning you get lucky</p>
<p>when you have those people in your company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the hard part for you.</p>
<p>The hard part is figuring out what to do</p>
<p>with one, two, and three.</p>
<p>Keep, demote, promote, fire.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>And this is why it&rsquo;s all about those three buckets.</p>
<p>I personally believe that folks in that bucket one,</p>
<p>as long as those folks aren&rsquo;t more than 50 to 60%</p>
<p>of a company, are good, and they can be managed</p>
<p>as long as they are one to two degrees away</p>
<p>from one of those people that you just mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easy then to drag the entire company down</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re too far away from the LeBron James,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what LeBron James looks</p>
<p>and feels and smells and, you know.</p>
<p>So you need that tactile sense</p>
<p>of what excellence looks like in front of you.</p>
<p>A great example is if you just go on YouTube</p>
<p>and you search these clips</p>
<p>of how Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s teammates described,</p>
<p>not Kobe, but how their own behavior, not performance,</p>
<p>because there was a bunch of average people</p>
<p>that Kobe played with his whole career,</p>
<p>but their behavior changed by being somewhat closer to him.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important psychological thing to note</p>
<p>for how you can do reasonably good team construction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to find those generational talents,</p>
<p>you have to find a composition of a team</p>
<p>that keeps them roughly close to enough of the org.</p>
<p>That way that group of people can continue to add value</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll have courage</p>
<p>to fire these next two groups of people.</p>
<p>And I think the answer is to fire those two groups of people.</p>
<p>Because no matter how good you are,</p>
<p>that stuff just injects poison into a living organism</p>
<p>and that living organism will die when exposed to poison.</p>
<p>So you invest in a lot of companies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of companies.</p>
<p>What do you think makes for a good leader?</p>
<p>So we talked about building a team,</p>
<p>but a good leader for a company.</p>
<p>What are the qualities?</p>
<p>When I first meet people, I never ask to see a resume.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m meeting a company CEO for the first time,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the business, in fact.</p>
<p>And I try to take the time to let them reveal themselves.</p>
<p>Now in this environment, I&rsquo;m doing most of the talking.</p>
<p>But if this were the other way around</p>
<p>and you were ever raising capital and you said,</p>
<p>Schmoth, I&rsquo;d be interested in you looking at this business,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably say eight to 10 words for hours.</p>
<p>Let me just listen.</p>
<p>Prod, you know, I throw things out.</p>
<p>Prod, and I let you meander.</p>
<p>And in you meandering,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a sense of who this person is.</p>
<p>Once I have a rough sense of that,</p>
<p>which is not necessarily right, but it&rsquo;s a starting point,</p>
<p>then I can go and understand</p>
<p>why this idea makes sense in this moment.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m really trying to do</p>
<p>is just kind of like unpack where are the biases</p>
<p>that may make you fail.</p>
<p>And then we go back to you.</p>
<p>The thing that Silicon Valley has the benefit of though</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t have to do any of this stuff</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s momentum,</p>
<p>because then the rule book goes out the window</p>
<p>and people clamor to invest.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I do,</p>
<p>and this is again, back to this pugilism</p>
<p>that I inflict on myself,</p>
<p>is I have these two things that I look at.</p>
<p>Thing number one is I have a table that says,</p>
<p>how much did we make from all of our best investments?</p>
<p>How much did we lose from all of our worst investments?</p>
<p>What is the ratio of winners to losers over 11 years?</p>
<p>And in our case, it&rsquo;s 23 to one.</p>
<p>On billions of dollars.</p>
<p>So you can kind of like, you can see a lot of signal.</p>
<p>But what that allows me to do is really like say,</p>
<p>wait a minute, like we cannot violate these rules</p>
<p>around how much money we&rsquo;re willing to commit</p>
<p>in an errant personality.</p>
<p>The second is I ask myself,</p>
<p>of all the other top VCs in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>name them all, what&rsquo;s our correlation?</p>
<p>Meaning when I do a deal,</p>
<p>how often does anybody from Sequoia, Excel,</p>
<p>Benchmark, Kleiner, you name it,</p>
<p>do it at the same time or after and vice versa?</p>
<p>And then I look at the data</p>
<p>to see how much they do it amongst themselves.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good sign?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at zero, as virtually close to zero as possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a good thing when the markets are way,</p>
<p>way up because it creates an enormous amount of momentum.</p>
<p>So I have to make money the hard way.</p>
<p>I have to, you know,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m trafficking in things that are highly uncorrelated</p>
<p>to the gestalt of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>which can be a lonely business,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really valuable in moments where markets get</p>
<p>crushed because correlation is the first thing that causes</p>
<p>massive destruction of capital, massive.</p>
<p>Because one person, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>with one blow up in one company, boom,</p>
<p>the contagion hits everybody except the person that was,</p>
<p>you know, not.</p>
<p>And so now those are like more sophisticated elements</p>
<p>of risk management, which is again,</p>
<p>this pugilism that I inflict on my,</p>
<p>nobody asks me to do that.</p>
<p>Nobody actually, at some level,</p>
<p>when the markets are up, really care.</p>
<p>And when markets are sideways or when markets are down,</p>
<p>I think that that allows me to feel proud of our process.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>It allows you to think a lot outside of the box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lonely because you&rsquo;re taking risks.</p>
<p>Also your public personality.</p>
<p>So you say stuff that if it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>you get yelled at for being,</p>
<p>I mean, your mistakes aren&rsquo;t private.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that has been a really,</p>
<p>really healthy moment of growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an athlete.</p>
<p>You know, if you really want to be a winner,</p>
<p>you got to hit the shot in front of the fans.</p>
<p>And if you miss it,</p>
<p>you have to be willing to take the responsibility</p>
<p>of the fact that you bricked it.</p>
<p>And over time, hopefully there&rsquo;s a body of work</p>
<p>that says you&rsquo;ve generally hit more than you&rsquo;ve missed.</p>
<p>But if you look at even the best shooters,</p>
<p>what are they?</p>
<p>52%.</p>
<p>So these are razor thin margins at the end of the day,</p>
<p>which is really, so then what can you control?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control the defense.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control what they throw at me.</p>
<p>I can just control my preparation</p>
<p>and whether I&rsquo;m in the best position</p>
<p>to launch a reasonable shot.</p>
<p>You said that the world&rsquo;s first trillionaire</p>
<p>would be somebody in climate change in the past.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s update that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s today, as we stand here today,</p>
<p>what sector will the world&rsquo;s first trillionaire come from?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s energy transition.</p>
<p>So energy, so the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t that, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I think the way that I think about.</p>
<p>So this is a single individual.</p>
<p>You see their ability to actually build a company</p>
<p>that makes huge amount of money</p>
<p>as opposed to this distributed idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my philosophy on wealth.</p>
<p>Most of it is not you.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of it is the genetic distribution</p>
<p>of being born in the right place and blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>irrespective of the boundary conditions</p>
<p>of how you were born or where you were raised, right?</p>
<p>So at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you and I ended up in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge benefit to us.</p>
<p>Second is the benefit of our age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much better and much more likely to be successful</p>
<p>as a 46-year-old in 2023 than a 26-year-old in 2023.</p>
<p>Because in my case, I have demographics working for me.</p>
<p>For the 26-year-old,</p>
<p>he or she has demographics working slightly against them.</p>
<p>Can you explain that a little bit?</p>
<p>What are the demographics here?</p>
<p>In the case of me,</p>
<p>the distribution of population in America</p>
<p>looks like a pyramid.</p>
<p>And in that pyramid,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wedged in between these two massive population cohorts,</p>
<p>the boomers and then these Gen Z and millennials.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very advantageous position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dissimilar to the position that Buffett was,</p>
<p>where he was packaged in between boomers beneath him</p>
<p>and the silent generation above him.</p>
<p>And being in between two massive population cohorts</p>
<p>turns out to be extremely advantageous</p>
<p>because when the cohort above you transitions power</p>
<p>and capital and all of this stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the next person that&rsquo;s likely gets handed it.</p>
<p>So we have a disproportionate likelihood to be,</p>
<p>we are lucky to be older than younger.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an advantage.</p>
<p>And then the other advantage that has nothing to do with me</p>
<p>is that I stumbled into technology.</p>
<p>I got a degree in electrical engineering</p>
<p>and I ended up coming to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And it turned out that in that moment,</p>
<p>it was such a transformational wind of change</p>
<p>that was at my back, right?</p>
<p>So the wealth that one creates</p>
<p>is a huge part of those variables.</p>
<p>And then the last variable is your direct contributions</p>
<p>in that moment.</p>
<p>And the reason why that can create extreme wealth</p>
<p>is because when those things come together</p>
<p>at the right moment, it&rsquo;s like a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>So that was sort of part number one</p>
<p>of what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>The second thing is when you look then</p>
<p>inside of these systems</p>
<p>where you have all these tailwinds, right?</p>
<p>So in tech, I think I benefit from these three big tailwinds.</p>
<p>If you build a company or are part of a company</p>
<p>or a part of a movement,</p>
<p>your economic participation tends to be a direct byproduct</p>
<p>of the actual value that that thing creates in the world.</p>
<p>And the thing that that creates in the world</p>
<p>will be bigger if it is not just an economic system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a philosophical system.</p>
<p>It changes the way that governance happens.</p>
<p>It changes the way that people think</p>
<p>about all kinds of other things about their lives.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reason I think why database companies</p>
<p>are worth X, social companies are worth Y,</p>
<p>but the military industrial complex is worth as much.</p>
<p>And I think there is a reason why that if you, for example,</p>
<p>were to go off and build some newfangled source of energy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clean and hyperabundant and safe,</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re really going to displace</p>
<p>or reshape is trillions and trillions of dollars</p>
<p>of worldwide GDP.</p>
<p>So the global GDP is, I call it 85 trillion, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going at two to 3% a year.</p>
<p>So in the next 10 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be dealing with $100 trillion of GDP, right?</p>
<p>Somebody who develops clean energy in 2035</p>
<p>will probably shift 10% of that around, $10 trillion.</p>
<p>A company can easily capture 30% of a market,</p>
<p>$3 trillion.</p>
<p>A human being can typically own</p>
<p>a third of one of these companies, $1 trillion.</p>
<p>So you can kind of get to this answer where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to happen in our lifetime,</p>
<p>but you have to, I think, find these systems</p>
<p>that are so gargantuan and they exist today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more bounded because price discovery takes longer.</p>
<p>In an existing thing, it&rsquo;s more unbounded</p>
<p>because you know what it is.</p>
<p>You know the tentacles that energy reaches, right?</p>
<p>Of that $80 trillion of worldwide GDP,</p>
<p>I bet you if you added up all the energy companies,</p>
<p>but then you added up all of manufacturing,</p>
<p>if you added up all of transport,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably get to like 60 of the 80.</p>
<p>Do you have an idea of which energy,</p>
<p>which alternate energy, sustainable energy,</p>
<p>is the most promising?</p>
<p>Well, I think that we have to do a better job</p>
<p>of exploring what I call the suburbs of the periodic table.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really good in Seattle, the upper Northwest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of good in Portland,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re non-existent in San Diego,</p>
<p>and we have zero plan for North Carolina through Florida.</p>
<p>Yeah, so is that a fancy way of saying</p>
<p>nuclear should be part of the discussion?</p>
<p>I think nuclear, I think room temperature semiconductors,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced right now</p>
<p>that the existing set of nuclear solutions</p>
<p>will do a good job of scaling beyond bench scale.</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of complicated technical problems</p>
<p>that make it work at a bench scale level, even partially,</p>
<p>but the energy equation is gonna be very difficult</p>
<p>to overcome in the absence</p>
<p>of some leaps in material science.</p>
<p>Have you seen any leaps?</p>
<p>Is there promising stuff?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re seeing the cutting edge</p>
<p>from a company perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say not yet, but the precursor, yes.</p>
<p>I have been spending a fair amount of time,</p>
<p>so talking about like a new framework that&rsquo;s in my mind,</p>
<p>is around these room temp superconductors.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been kind of bumbling around in that forest</p>
<p>for about a year.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really put together any meaningful perspectives,</p>
<p>but again, talking about like trafficking</p>
<p>in companies and investments that are very lonely,</p>
<p>but they allow me to generate returns</p>
<p>that are relatively unique and independent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an area where I don&rsquo;t see anybody else</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you another area.</p>
<p>You know, we, I think, are about to unleash</p>
<p>in a world of zero energy and zero compute costs,</p>
<p>computational biology will replace white chemistry.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you will be able to iterate on tools</p>
<p>that will be able to solve a lot of human disease.</p>
<p>I think like, if you look at the head</p>
<p>of like the top 400 most recurring rare diseases,</p>
<p>I think like half the number, 200,</p>
<p>is specific point mutation,</p>
<p>is just the mis-methylation between C and T.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like, whoa, wait,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling me in billions of lines of code,</p>
<p>I forgot a semicolon right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s causing this whole thing to miscompile.</p>
<p>So I just got to go in there and boop, and it&rsquo;s all done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crazy idea.</p>
<p>That was a C++, C throwback for people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t know what I said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two people who are clapping.</p>
<p>Two people there, everybody else is like,</p>
<p>what, this is not a pipe, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But, but.</p>
<p>So that, couldn&rsquo;t that be a truly, a source of a huge,</p>
<p>the computational biology unlocks,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously medicine is begging for.</p>
<p>The thing with energy, though,</p>
<p>is that the groundwork is well laid.</p>
<p>And talking about sort of like the upper bound</p>
<p>is well defined.</p>
<p>The upper bound in medicine is not well defined</p>
<p>because it is not the sum total of the market cap</p>
<p>of the pharma industries.</p>
<p>It is actually the sum total of the value of human life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an extremely ethical and moral question.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there special interests that are resisting</p>
<p>moving, making progress on the energy side?</p>
<p>So like governments, and how do you break through that?</p>
<p>I mean, you have to acknowledge the reality of that, right?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s less governments.</p>
<p>In fact, like I said,</p>
<p>I think President Biden has done a really incredible job.</p>
<p>Well, Chuck Schumer really has done a really incredible job</p>
<p>because, so just to give you the math on this, right?</p>
<p>Like back to this,</p>
<p>so 3% of everything is of a market or zealots.</p>
<p>But when you get past 5%,</p>
<p>things tend to just go nuclear to 50, 60%.</p>
<p>The way that they wrote this last bill,</p>
<p>the cost, I&rsquo;ll just use the cars as an example.</p>
<p>The cost of an average car is 22 and a half thousand.</p>
<p>The cost of the cheapest battery car is 30,000.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, there&rsquo;s a $7,500 credit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like to think the invisible hand</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know that that math was right,</p>
<p>I think is kind of a little bit malarkey.</p>
<p>And so the battery EV car</p>
<p>is gonna be the same price as the thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna go to 40, 50%.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re already at this tipping point.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of ready to go.</p>
<p>In these other markets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of infrastructure</p>
<p>that needs to get built.</p>
<p>So, you know, the gene editing thing, as an example,</p>
<p>you know, we have to build a tool chain</p>
<p>that looks more like code that you can write to.</p>
<p>Facebook has written in, I think, PHP originally,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;m still a big fan of.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to use the ugly solution</p>
<p>and make it look good</p>
<p>versus trying to come up with a good solution,</p>
<p>which will be too late.</p>
<p>Let me ask you,</p>
<p>you consider a run for governor of California</p>
<p>then decided against it.</p>
<p>What went into each of these decisions?</p>
<p>And broadly, I just have maybe a selfish question</p>
<p>about Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Is it over as a world leader for new tech companies?</p>
<p>As this beacon of promise of young minds</p>
<p>stepping in and creating something that changes the world?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if those two questions are connected.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not over,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s definitely,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a challenging moment because,</p>
<p>so back to that analogy of the demographics,</p>
<p>if you think about the,</p>
<p>like if you bucketed,</p>
<p>forget like our relative successes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of us in this mid-50s</p>
<p>to mid-30s cohort of people</p>
<p>that have now been around for 20 years,</p>
<p>15 years to 25 years that have done stuff, right?</p>
<p>From Andreessen to Zuck to Jack Dorsey, et cetera,</p>
<p>Elon, whatever, maybe you throw me in the mix,</p>
<p>David Sachs, whatever, okay?</p>
<p>None of us have done a really good job</p>
<p>of becoming a statesman or a stateswoman,</p>
<p>and really showing a broad empathy and awareness</p>
<p>for the broader systems.</p>
<p>So Silicon Valley is to survive as a system.</p>
<p>We need to know that we&rsquo;ve transitioned</p>
<p>from move fast and break things</p>
<p>to get to the right answer and take your time</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what it means.</p>
<p>And so we have to be a participant of the system.</p>
<p>And I believe that.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s important to not be a dilettante</p>
<p>and not be thumbing your face to Washington</p>
<p>or not push the boundaries and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll deal with it after the fact,</p>
<p>but to work with folks that are trying to do the best,</p>
<p>again, steel men, their point of view.</p>
<p>Work with them, potentially run for office.</p>
<p>So potentially like be, understand the system.</p>
<p>Be a part of their system.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that there&rsquo;s no tech people</p>
<p>or not many tech people in Congress</p>
<p>and certainly not in the presidential level,</p>
<p>not many governors or senators.</p>
<p>Well, I think that we also have roughly,</p>
<p>our rules will never allow some of the best</p>
<p>and brightest folks to run for president</p>
<p>because of just the rules against it.</p>
<p>But if-</p>
<p>Oh, you mean, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think David Sacks</p>
<p>would be an incredible presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Now, I also think he&rsquo;d be a great governor.</p>
<p>No, he was born in South Africa.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;d be a great governor.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;d be a great secretary of state.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;d be great at whatever he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Friedberg wasn&rsquo;t born here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people that could contribute</p>
<p>at different levels.</p>
<p>And I hope that&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, the other thing I like about the pod is like,</p>
<p>I also think it helps normalize tech a little bit</p>
<p>because you just see like normal people</p>
<p>dealing with normal situations.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It is a really normative place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the caricature that it&rsquo;s made out to be,</p>
<p>but there is a small virulent strain of people</p>
<p>that make it caricature-like.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s in one direction.</p>
<p>What do you think about the whole culture of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if better terms, but woke activism?</p>
<p>So sort of activism, which in some contexts</p>
<p>is a powerful and important thing,</p>
<p>but infiltrating companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer this in the context of Rene Girard.</p>
<p>So like he says that people tend to copy each other.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;re copying each other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re fighting over some scarce resource.</p>
<p>And then you find a way to organize against the group of you</p>
<p>against the person or a thing that you think</p>
<p>is the actual cause of all of this conflict</p>
<p>and you try to expel them.</p>
<p>The thing that wokeism doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is that unless that person is truly to blame,</p>
<p>the cycle just continues.</p>
<p>And that was a framework that he developed</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s really conclusively proven to be true</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s observable in humanity, in life.</p>
<p>So these movements, I think the extreme left</p>
<p>and the extreme right are trying to interpret a way</p>
<p>to allow people to compete for some scarce resource.</p>
<p>But I also think that in all of that,</p>
<p>what they don&rsquo;t realize is that</p>
<p>they can scapegoat whoever they want,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna work</p>
<p>because the bulwark of people in the middle</p>
<p>realize that it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>Yeah, they realize, but they&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>because in leadership positions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still momentum and they still scapegoat</p>
<p>and they continue.</p>
<p>And it seems to hurt the actual ability</p>
<p>of those companies to be successful.</p>
<p>In fairness, though,</p>
<p>if you had to graph the effectiveness of that function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s decaying rapidly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the least effective it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Being canceled five years ago was a huge deal.</p>
<p>Today, I think it was Jordan Peterson on your podcast.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ve been canceled and it was amazing.</p>
<p>He said 38 times or 40.</p>
<p>He said some number, which was a ginormous number,</p>
<p>A, that he kept account of it</p>
<p>and B, was able to classify it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what classifier is going on in his mind</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, ah, that&rsquo;s an attempt to cancel me,</p>
<p>but this one is not.</p>
<p>But my point is, well, it&rsquo;s clearly not working.</p>
<p>And so the guy is still there</p>
<p>and the guy is putting his view out into the world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not to judge</p>
<p>whether what he says is right or wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to observe that this mechanism of action</p>
<p>is now weakened.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s weakened because it&rsquo;s not the thing</p>
<p>that people think is really to blame.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been canceled on a small scale a few times.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m sure it didn&rsquo;t feel small.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t small.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to minimize it.</p>
<p>Did that psychologically hurt you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was tough.</p>
<p>In the moment, you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But I would like to thank a certain CEO</p>
<p>of a certain well-known company.</p>
<p>And he sent me basically like a step-by-step manual.</p>
<p>Does it involve mushrooms?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, and he was right.</p>
<p>The storm passed and life went on.</p>
<p>Is it, I don&rsquo;t know if you can share</p>
<p>the list of steps, but is the fundamental core ideas</p>
<p>that just life goes on?</p>
<p>The core fundamental idea is like you need to be willing</p>
<p>and able to apologize for what is in your control,</p>
<p>but not for other people&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>
<p>Your mistakes, yes.</p>
<p>And if you feel like there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>then you should take accountability of that.</p>
<p>But to apologize for somebody else,</p>
<p>for something that they want to hear,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna solve anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about apologies.</p>
<p>If you do them, they should be authentic</p>
<p>to what you actually want to say</p>
<p>versus what somebody else wants to hear.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it doesn&rsquo;t ring true.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people can see through that.</p>
<p>And people can see through it.</p>
<p>And also, what people see through is not just the fact</p>
<p>that your apology was somewhat hollow,</p>
<p>but also that this entire majority of people</p>
<p>now walked away.</p>
<p>The mob was like, okay, thanks.</p>
<p>And then people are like, oh, so you didn&rsquo;t care at all?</p>
<p>This was like, and so then it reflects</p>
<p>more probably on them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know you said you don&rsquo;t like to give advice,</p>
<p>but what advice would you give to a young person?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived an incredible life</p>
<p>from very humble beginnings, difficult childhood,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re one of the most successful people in the world.</p>
<p>So what advice, I mean, a lot of people look to you</p>
<p>for inspiration.</p>
<p>Kids in high school or early college</p>
<p>that are not doing good</p>
<p>or are trying to figure out basically what to do</p>
<p>when they have complete doubt in themselves.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them?</p>
<p>It is really important that if somebody that you respect,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna, just for the purpose of this,</p>
<p>put myself in that bucket.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>I wish somebody had told this to me.</p>
<p>We are all equal.</p>
<p>And you will fight this demon inside you</p>
<p>that says you are less than a lot of other people</p>
<p>for reasons that will be hard to see</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re much, much older.</p>
<p>And so you have to find either a set of people</p>
<p>far, far away, like what I did,</p>
<p>or one or two people really, really close to you.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s both that will remind you</p>
<p>in key moments of your life that that is true.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will give in to that beast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the end of the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll recover from it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes,</p>
<p>but it requires a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to just stop and give up.</p>
<p>So I think that if you&rsquo;re starting out in the world,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been lucky to have a wonderful life</p>
<p>and you had wonderful parents,</p>
<p>man, you should go and give them a huge hug</p>
<p>because they did you such a service</p>
<p>that most folks don&rsquo;t do to most kids, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the fault of these parents,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just tough, life is tough.</p>
<p>So give them a kiss and then figure out a way</p>
<p>where you can just do work that validates you</p>
<p>and where you feel like you&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>some kind of mastery.</p>
<p>Who cares what anybody else thinks about it?</p>
<p>Just do it because it feels good.</p>
<p>Do it because you like to get good at something.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not one of those lucky people,</p>
<p>you can believe in your friends</p>
<p>or you can just believe in me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, preserve optionality.</p>
<p>How you do that is by regulating your reactions to things.</p>
<p>And your reactions are going to be largely guided</p>
<p>in moments where you think that you are not the same</p>
<p>as everybody else.</p>
<p>And specifically that you are less than those people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So just save this part of this podcast</p>
<p>and just play it on a loop if you need to.</p>
<p>But that is my biggest learning is I am equal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same as all these other people.</p>
<p>And you can imagine what that means to me</p>
<p>to go out in the world, to see people</p>
<p>and think, okay, I&rsquo;m the same as this person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m as good as them.</p>
<p>And you could imagine what you&rsquo;re probably thinking</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m thinking is not that thing.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re probably thinking, man, this guy, yeah,</p>
<p>this guy, I&rsquo;m so much better.</p>
<p>No, I am fighting this thing all the time.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve also met a bunch of folks</p>
<p>who I think is a counter reaction to that.</p>
<p>Once they become successful,</p>
<p>they start developing a philosophy that they are better</p>
<p>or even some people are better than others,</p>
<p>which I understand, there&rsquo;s LeBron James</p>
<p>versus other people and so on.</p>
<p>But I always really resisted that thought</p>
<p>because I feel like it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not better.</p>
<p>They have mastery in a thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve fallen in love with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to develop mastery in a thing that I love.</p>
<p>I love the art, I love investing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like solving puzzles.</p>
<p>And I love that.</p>
<p>I love trying to develop mastery in poker.</p>
<p>I really love that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning how to be a parent to a teenager</p>
<p>because I finally have one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all new stuff to me and I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t wanna think you&rsquo;re lesser than</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna think you&rsquo;re better than</p>
<p>because those both lead you astray.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought I was better than.</p>
<p>I manifested better than</p>
<p>because I was trying to compensate for feeling less than.</p>
<p>My goal is just to feel like everybody else feels</p>
<p>on the presumption that everybody had a normal life.</p>
<p>Given your nickname is The Dictator,</p>
<p>do you trust yourself with power?</p>
<p>Like if the world gave you absolute power for a month?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, because I think that I&rsquo;m still riddled with bias.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deserve that position.</p>
<p>And I would not want that weight on my shoulders.</p>
<p>I had a spot actually where it was a very</p>
<p>important and big poker game.</p>
<p>And it was a spot where I was in the pot.</p>
<p>And it was a really large pot.</p>
<p>It was like a million dollar pot.</p>
<p>And I had to make a ruling and the ruling was in my favor.</p>
<p>And I was just beside myself.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t play, I play for the challenge.</p>
<p>I like to get pushed to the limit of my capabilities.</p>
<p>I wanna see, can I think at the same level of these folks?</p>
<p>Because these guys are all experts, they&rsquo;re all pros.</p>
<p>And I get enormous joy from that challenge.</p>
<p>And I like to win, but I like to win just a small amount.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And then I never wanted to win in that way.</p>
<p>But because it was my game, I had to make this call</p>
<p>on a million dollar pot and I wanted to just shoot myself.</p>
<p>I just was like, this is gross and disgusting.</p>
<p>And he was a complete gentleman,</p>
<p>which made it even worse.</p>
<p>So I do not want absolute power.</p>
<p>Well, those are the people you do want to have power</p>
<p>is the ones that don&rsquo;t want it,</p>
<p>which is a weird system to have.</p>
<p>Because then you, in that kind of system,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get the leaders that you should have.</p>
<p>Because the ones that want power</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the ones that should have power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird, weird system.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Let me sneak this question in there.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, well.</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>You ever look up at the stars</p>
<p>and think about the big why question?</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s a chance to just enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it really,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in this idea of legacy that much.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a real trap.</p>
<p>So do you think you&rsquo;ll be forgotten by history?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I really, really hope so.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it,</p>
<p>there are two or three people</p>
<p>that are remembered for positive things,</p>
<p>and everybody else, it&rsquo;s all negative things.</p>
<p>And the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll be remembered</p>
<p>for a positive thing is harder and harder and harder.</p>
<p>And so the surface area of being remembered is negative.</p>
<p>And then the second, what will it matter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be gone.</p>
<p>I really just wanna like have fun,</p>
<p>do my thing, learn, get better.</p>
<p>But I want to reward myself by feeling like,</p>
<p>well, that was awesome.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve told this story many times,</p>
<p>and I have put, again,</p>
<p>my own narrative fallacy on top of this,</p>
<p>but Steve Jobs&rsquo;s sister wrote this obit</p>
<p>in the New York Times when he died.</p>
<p>And she ends it by saying his last words were,</p>
<p>oh, wow, oh, wow, oh, wow.</p>
<p>That seems like an awesome way to die.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re surrounded by your friends and family,</p>
<p>not the fact that he died, obviously,</p>
<p>but in a moment where what I read into it</p>
<p>was your family was there.</p>
<p>Maybe you thought about all the cool shit</p>
<p>that you were able to do.</p>
<p>And then you just started the simulation all over again.</p>
<p>And so just on the off chance that that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna take this thing too seriously.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Just enjoy it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not afraid of it, the end?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Could end tomorrow, could end right now.</p>
<p>So every day you can go, and you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re happy with the things you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are obviously things I want to do</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>But there are no gaping things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really, really, really been in love.</p>
<p>Total gift.</p>
<p>There have been moments where I&rsquo;ve really, really felt</p>
<p>like everybody else.</p>
<p>There have been moments where I had deep, deep, deep joy</p>
<p>and connection with my children.</p>
<p>There are moments where I&rsquo;ve had incredible giggling fun</p>
<p>with my friends.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s moments where I&rsquo;ve been able to enjoy</p>
<p>really incredible experiences, wine, food, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Great, I mean, what more do you want?</p>
<p>Like I could keep asking for more,</p>
<p>but I would just be a really crappy human being</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>This life is pretty beautiful</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s better than it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For most of us, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty nice.</p>
<p>You know, and all of the like, you know,</p>
<p>millennials and Gen Zs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to get a boatload of money from your parents.</p>
<p>And you better figure out how to be happy</p>
<p>before you get that money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you will be miserable.</p>
<p>Get a lot of Dairy Queen.</p>
<p>No, that only worked the first time.</p>
<p>It worked two times in grade five and grade six.</p>
<p>My God, that next year.</p>
<p>Flex, I worked my ass off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, but I could never bring myself to ask her.</p>
<p>And then she did it.</p>
<p>And I was like, man, this woman&rsquo;s a Ms. Bruni.</p>
<p>This woman&rsquo;s a gem.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the third time it faded.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the sad thing about life?</p>
<p>You know, the finiteness of it, the scarcity of it.</p>
<p>Without that, we perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>ice cream wouldn&rsquo;t be so damn delicious.</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;re an incredible human.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend that people listen to you</p>
<p>on all platforms.</p>
<p>Just, we&rsquo;re very lucky to be able to get your wisdom.</p>
<p>I agree with, I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about you</p>
<p>with Andrej Karpathy, who&rsquo;s somebody I really respect.</p>
<p>And he just loves the shit out of you</p>
<p>in how much you, how deeply you understand the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible human being, so that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And a different, yeah, speaking of semicolons,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some human beings that understand everything</p>
<p>at the very low level and at the very high level.</p>
<p>And those people are also very rare.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge honor, and also a huge honor</p>
<p>that you would be so kind to me,</p>
<p>just like in subtle ways offline,</p>
<p>that you would make me feel like I&rsquo;m worthwhile.</p>
<p>Well, can I just say something as just a layman listener?</p>
<p>What you do, just so I could give you my version,</p>
<p>is that you take things and people,</p>
<p>so ideas and people, that are mostly behind a rope,</p>
<p>and you demystify it.</p>
<p>And what that does for all of us is it makes me feel</p>
<p>like I can be a part of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really inspiring thing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not giving advice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not telling us how to solve the problem,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re allowing it to be understood</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really accessible.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re intellectually curious in ways</p>
<p>that some of us would never expect that we were,</p>
<p>and then you kind of end up in this rabbit hole.</p>
<p>And then you have the courage to go and talk to people</p>
<p>that are really all over the map.</p>
<p>Like for example, when I saw your Jordan Peterson example,</p>
<p>you went there, like you talked about Nazism,</p>
<p>and I was just like, man, this is a complicated argument</p>
<p>these guys are gonna tackle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s really, really impressive.</p>
<p>So I have an enormous amount of respect for what you do.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard to do what you do so consistently.</p>
<p>And so I look at you as somebody I respect</p>
<p>because it just shows like somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s immersed in something and who&rsquo;s very special.</p>
<p>So thank you for including me in this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna play that clip to myself privately over and over</p>
<p>just when I feel low and self-critical about myself.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, brother.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Jonathan Swift.</p>
<p>A wise person should have money in their head,</p>
<p>but not in their heart.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
