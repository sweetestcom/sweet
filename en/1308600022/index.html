    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today is the third episode in our series of episodes</p>
<p>about physical and athletic skill performance</p>
<p>and skill learning in general.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about the science</p>
<p>of tools for fat loss.</p>
<p>And fat loss is something</p>
<p>that interests a large number of people.</p>
<p>Many people want to lose fat.</p>
<p>Many people are athletes who need to lose fat.</p>
<p>And in general, we know that having body fat percentages</p>
<p>that are too high is unhealthy for us.</p>
<p>And most people struggle to lose fat.</p>
<p>Most people struggle to lose weight generally,</p>
<p>but most people especially struggle to lose body fat</p>
<p>or what we call adipose tissue.</p>
<p>Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about some things</p>
<p>related to fat loss and that are powerful for fat loss</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m guessing most of you have never heard about before.</p>
<p>You may have heard about a few of them,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing you haven&rsquo;t heard about all of them.</p>
<p>This episode is going to be rich with science-based tools</p>
<p>that are gleaned from a variety of aspects</p>
<p>of the literature, including the use of cold,</p>
<p>including brown fat, including something called beige fat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about something called NEAT.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss</p>
<p>that are governed by your nervous system.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, an important gap</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s missing in the discussion about fat loss.</p>
<p>You can hear a lot of information out there</p>
<p>about the role of things like insulin</p>
<p>and various diets like ketogenic diets</p>
<p>or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some great stuff out there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some really terrible information out there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>We did a number of episodes talking about</p>
<p>the role of hormones on metabolism</p>
<p>and the role of food on mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in those topics,</p>
<p>please check them out.</p>
<p>I will touch a little bit on hormones today,</p>
<p>things like insulin and leptin, just a little bit,</p>
<p>but today&rsquo;s episode is mainly going to be focused</p>
<p>on how the nervous system, neurons,</p>
<p>and some of the cells they collaborate with,</p>
<p>like glia and macrophages,</p>
<p>how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss</p>
<p>because it turns out they can.</p>
<p>Remember, your nervous system,</p>
<p>which includes your brain and your spinal cord</p>
<p>and all the connections that they make</p>
<p>with the organs of the body, governs everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the on switch and the off switch for your immune system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the on switch and the off switch,</p>
<p>it turns out, also for fat burning.</p>
<p>And so the nervous system and the role of the brain</p>
<p>and other neurons has been vastly overlooked</p>
<p>in the discussion about losing fat.</p>
<p>Now, I would be remiss,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d probably come under a pretty considerable attack</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t just acknowledge upfront a core truth</p>
<p>of metabolic science and also of neuroscience, frankly,</p>
<p>which is that calories in versus calories out,</p>
<p>meaning how many calories you ingest</p>
<p>versus how many calories you burn,</p>
<p>is the fundamental and most important formula</p>
<p>in this business of fat loss</p>
<p>and weight management in general.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no way around the fact</p>
<p>that if you ingest far more calories than you burn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to gain weight.</p>
<p>And a good portion of that weight</p>
<p>is likely to be adipose tissue, fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also true that if you ingest fewer calories</p>
<p>than you burn, that you will lose weight</p>
<p>and that a significant portion of that</p>
<p>will come from body fat.</p>
<p>What portion depends on a number of factors,</p>
<p>but that simple formula is important.</p>
<p>On a previous episode, I mentioned the complications</p>
<p>with the statement of a calorie is a calorie.</p>
<p>And indeed, there is evidence from, for instance,</p>
<p>Robert Lustig, who&rsquo;s a pediatric endocrinologist</p>
<p>at UC San Francisco,</p>
<p>has talked about how highly processed foods</p>
<p>change the way that we utilize food</p>
<p>and can lead to higher incidences of obesity</p>
<p>and other metabolic syndromes</p>
<p>that go against the idea that a calorie is a calorie</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy,</p>
<p>and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in,</p>
<p>meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula,</p>
<p>but the calories burned portion is strongly influenced</p>
<p>by a number of things that you can control</p>
<p>that can greatly accelerate</p>
<p>or increase the amount of adipose tissue</p>
<p>or the proportion of adipose tissue</p>
<p>that you burn in response to exercise and food.</p>
<p>So your hormones are important.</p>
<p>Your thermogenic milieu,</p>
<p>meaning how warm or how cold your body is,</p>
<p>how cold you make it, how warm you make it,</p>
<p>but also your level of metabolism,</p>
<p>your levels of thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s hardly ever discussed,</p>
<p>but is well-supported by the scientific literature,</p>
<p>how much innervation,</p>
<p>meaning how much connectivity there is</p>
<p>between your nervous system and fat.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the fact</p>
<p>that your body fat of various kinds,</p>
<p>and there are several kinds of body fat,</p>
<p>are actually innervated by neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons connect to your body fat</p>
<p>and can change the probability</p>
<p>that that body fat will be burned or not.</p>
<p>So your nervous system is the master controller</p>
<p>of this process,</p>
<p>and it plays a strong role in the calories out,</p>
<p>the calories burned component.</p>
<p>So as usual, we&rsquo;re going to discuss a little bit of science.</p>
<p>I promise I won&rsquo;t go too deep into lipolysis</p>
<p>and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to break down that process</p>
<p>into two important steps.</p>
<p>And if you can understand those two important steps,</p>
<p>then the rest of the tools</p>
<p>will be very straightforward to understand and manage.</p>
<p>And I do believe that today you will walk away</p>
<p>with many new tools that you could incorporate</p>
<p>into any kind of fat loss regimen</p>
<p>that will greatly accelerate that process</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s grounded in quality peer-reviewed science.</p>
<p>Throughout the episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about some behavioral tools.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll mostly talk about behavioral tools.</p>
<p>I will also talk about compounds, supplements.</p>
<p>Many of you are into supplements.</p>
<p>Some of you aren&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>For those of you that are into supplements,</p>
<p>an important issue in a discussion about supplements</p>
<p>for fat loss or otherwise</p>
<p>is going to be the quality of those supplements</p>
<p>and the accuracy about what&rsquo;s in those supplement bottles</p>
<p>and tablets, et cetera.</p>
<p>I usually mention this at the end of the podcast,</p>
<p>but this podcast, we&rsquo;ve partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,</p>
<p>because Thorne, we believe,</p>
<p>has the highest levels of stringency</p>
<p>in terms of the quality of the compounds</p>
<p>in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds.</p>
<p>If you want to see the supplements I take,</p>
<p>you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You can see the supplements that I take.</p>
<p>That will also allow you to get 20% off</p>
<p>any of those supplements</p>
<p>or 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.</p>
<p>Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic</p>
<p>and all the major sports teams,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a very strong basis for their stringency.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need to use supplements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not encouraging anyone to use supplements</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not your thing,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to use supplements,</p>
<p>make sure that your supplement source</p>
<p>is one of very high quality.</p>
<p>With that said, I want to get started</p>
<p>and talk about the various tools for fat loss</p>
<p>and how neuroscience, neurons, control fat loss.</p>
<p>Before I do that, I want to set the context correctly</p>
<p>and extract some of the key takeaways</p>
<p>from previous episodes,</p>
<p>because if your foundation of health</p>
<p>and your foundation of hormones</p>
<p>and your foundation of metabolism isn&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to get the most</p>
<p>out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol.</p>
<p>In previous episodes, I talked all about the science</p>
<p>and the details going into particular protocols.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to do that now,</p>
<p>and I want to get to the new material.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple bins,</p>
<p>a couple items that you should make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting correctly,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not perfect about these,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Most people are not perfect about them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not perfect about them,</p>
<p>but we should all be striving to get quality</p>
<p>and sufficient sleep.</p>
<p>I did four full episodes on sleep</p>
<p>and how to get better at sleeping</p>
<p>through things like light exposure, temperature,</p>
<p>timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a night owl or a morning person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first four or I think five episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Get your sleep right.</p>
<p>Get your light exposure right.</p>
<p>Avoid bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>at times you want to be asleep,</p>
<p>and get bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>at times you want to be awake.</p>
<p>So get your sleep right.</p>
<p>The other thing is essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the food and mood episode,</p>
<p>but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes.</p>
<p>We need fatty acids.</p>
<p>They are vital to so many aspects of our health.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get them from supplements.</p>
<p>You can if you want to,</p>
<p>but you need to get them from your food.</p>
<p>They are essential.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason there&rsquo;s an E, the essential part there.</p>
<p>Of the fatty acids, there are multiple kinds,</p>
<p>but for the antidepressant effects</p>
<p>or the levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood</p>
<p>and also healthy metabolism,</p>
<p>and will start to shift the needle in the right direction</p>
<p>on bloodborne cardiovascular factors,</p>
<p>the key thing is to get the levels of EPA that you ingest</p>
<p>above 1,000 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t mean just taking 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>or more of say fish oil or krill oil</p>
<p>or whatever your preferred source is.</p>
<p>It means getting above 1,000 milligrams of EPA,</p>
<p>which may require that you ingest more essential fatty</p>
<p>acids than just 1,000 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>That of course can be done through food sources,</p>
<p>things like fatty fish,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not into eating fish,</p>
<p>you have quality meats that are grass-raised can do that.</p>
<p>There are other sources of essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>of course, also from plant sources.</p>
<p>So look those up online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to find,</p>
<p>but the research and the literature shows</p>
<p>that you want to get above 1,000 milligrams of EPA per day,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you can best support your metabolism</p>
<p>and position yourself for good fat loss.</p>
<p>As well for people who have cravings issues,</p>
<p>they crave sweets all the time.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the gut brain episode</p>
<p>and hormones and food that you have neurons in your gut</p>
<p>that are craving, they&rsquo;re seeking essential fatty acids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re craving and seeking amino acids from your food.</p>
<p>Now, these are not supplements that they crave per se,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re craving those things because that&rsquo;s what your body</p>
<p>needs and your brain needs.</p>
<p>But those same neurons will respond to sugars.</p>
<p>And so many people who are craving sugar</p>
<p>can satisfy that sugar craving by giving the neurons,</p>
<p>so to speak, what they actually want,</p>
<p>which are amino acids and essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine</p>
<p>and amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings</p>
<p>if you take a teaspoon of that</p>
<p>or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day.</p>
<p>You have to ease into that a little bit</p>
<p>because some people can get a little bit of GI distress</p>
<p>from too much glutamine,</p>
<p>but glutamine has also been shown</p>
<p>to improve symptoms of leaky gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful amino acid.</p>
<p>And yes, you can also get it from food.</p>
<p>Things like cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then finally, you can&rsquo;t really position yourself</p>
<p>to have a strong metabolism</p>
<p>if your iodine levels aren&rsquo;t correct</p>
<p>and your thyroid levels aren&rsquo;t correct.</p>
<p>You can overdo iodine, so you don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>A lot of table salt has iodine added to it,</p>
<p>but some people need to add iodine</p>
<p>by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.</p>
<p>But one of the best ways to support the thyroid system</p>
<p>and metabolism in general</p>
<p>is to make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough selenium,</p>
<p>sometimes called selenium.</p>
<p>Each day, simple way to do that</p>
<p>is to ingest the highest concentration of selenium food</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of, which is Brazil nuts.</p>
<p>One or two or three of those per day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have more than enough selenium</p>
<p>to meet the thyroid needs.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your selenium to be too high.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a diet too high in anything.</p>
<p>So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs, glutamine,</p>
<p>if you have issues with leaky gut</p>
<p>or sugar cravings can really help.</p>
<p>Get your gut microbiome right.</p>
<p>I may have missed saying that,</p>
<p>but get your gut microbiome right.</p>
<p>That does not necessarily mean you need to ingest probiotics.</p>
<p>You can if you want to,</p>
<p>but you can also just simply ingest a serving or two</p>
<p>of fermented foods per day.</p>
<p>That can greatly assist.</p>
<p>So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,</p>
<p>every culture has a different source</p>
<p>or sources of fermented foods.</p>
<p>Those can really help the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And then make sure that your thyroid hormone is supported</p>
<p>through the ingestion of sufficient iodine, not too much,</p>
<p>and sufficient selenium, not too much.</p>
<p>Okay, sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods,</p>
<p>iodine, selenium, that sets the basis</p>
<p>for how things like exercise, cold,</p>
<p>and some of the compounds and other things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about today that are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing, going to be truly new to many of you</p>
<p>that can really increase the burn factor</p>
<p>in the equation of calories in versus calories burned, okay?</p>
<p>So on the one hand, we have this reality</p>
<p>of calories in versus calories burned.</p>
<p>However, I would also be remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t mention an incredible study</p>
<p>that was done by my colleague, Aaliyah Crum at Stanford.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a faculty member,</p>
<p>a professor in the psychology department,</p>
<p>looking at how belief effects, just thinking,</p>
<p>can impact the effects of things</p>
<p>like exercise on weight loss.</p>
<p>These are just incredible results.</p>
<p>What they did was they took subjects</p>
<p>who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels</p>
<p>and come in and change the linens and so forth,</p>
<p>divide them into two groups.</p>
<p>One group, they were told moving around</p>
<p>and doing your duties for your job,</p>
<p>meet the standards for US guidelines</p>
<p>for activity and movement, et cetera,</p>
<p>and a basic lecture about how movement</p>
<p>is good for you, et cetera,</p>
<p>but mostly just that their daily activities</p>
<p>met the standards for the US.</p>
<p>The other group, however, was given a bunch of information</p>
<p>about how movement and their daily routine</p>
<p>was very good for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>It could be good for weight loss, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then they tracked these subjects</p>
<p>over a period of many weeks.</p>
<p>The take-home message from this study</p>
<p>was that simply being told that movement is good for you,</p>
<p>can lead to weight loss, et cetera,</p>
<p>led to significantly more body fat loss,</p>
<p>waist to hip ratio changes in the direction</p>
<p>that most people would want,</p>
<p>essentially a slimming down, if you will,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other positive effects</p>
<p>on things like cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise</p>
<p>can help various health markers.</p>
<p>So this is remarkable and it speaks to the power</p>
<p>of the nervous system and the power of belief</p>
<p>in governing aspects of our body and our physiology</p>
<p>that one would otherwise think</p>
<p>were outside our conscious control.</p>
<p>Now, of course, any of you that think scientifically,</p>
<p>which I imagine if you watch this podcast</p>
<p>or listen to this podcast is all of you by now,</p>
<p>probably thinking, well, maybe they just moved around more</p>
<p>or maybe they stood up and sat down more.</p>
<p>Maybe they did something else that was different.</p>
<p>And indeed there&rsquo;s a strong possibility</p>
<p>that they did things differently than the other group.</p>
<p>But the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you,</p>
<p>that movement is good for you,</p>
<p>shifted their behavior and their physiology</p>
<p>in the direction of enhanced weight loss,</p>
<p>fat loss, et cetera.</p>
<p>So how we think about a given set of activities</p>
<p>affects how we perform those activities</p>
<p>and how we think about and perform those activities</p>
<p>has a real effect on our physiology.</p>
<p>So somewhere between the hard and fast rule</p>
<p>that governs fat loss and weight loss,</p>
<p>which is if you ingest more calories than you burn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll either maintain or gain weight.</p>
<p>Typically you&rsquo;ll gain weight, although not always.</p>
<p>If you ingest about as many calories as you burn,</p>
<p>you maintain weight typically.</p>
<p>And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn,</p>
<p>typically you&rsquo;ll lose weight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of rule of fat loss.</p>
<p>And yet we also have these belief effects which show,</p>
<p>and this has been replicated again and again,</p>
<p>that how we think about a process,</p>
<p>whether or not we think it&rsquo;s beneficial</p>
<p>can change our physiology</p>
<p>in ways that can be beneficial to us.</p>
<p>Somewhere in between those two extremes</p>
<p>of hardcore metabolic science and belief effects</p>
<p>lie a bunch of protocols</p>
<p>that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed science</p>
<p>and in physiology that you can leverage</p>
<p>to increase the rates of fat loss.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to talk about today.</p>
<p>I love this topic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m so obsessed with fat loss,</p>
<p>but rather the first project I ever worked on in science</p>
<p>was thermogenesis and fat loss.</p>
<p>I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate</p>
<p>and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds</p>
<p>and how they impacted thermogenesis.</p>
<p>And so we looked at how things like MDMA, ecstasy,</p>
<p>how antipsychotics, antidepressants,</p>
<p>various weight loss drugs that were on the market,</p>
<p>how those impacted body temperature</p>
<p>and fat loss and metabolism.</p>
<p>And we just had so much fun doing it.</p>
<p>So if you detect a smile on my face,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And I also learned a lot.</p>
<p>And I also came to really appreciate</p>
<p>that this tissue of our bodies, adipose tissue and fat,</p>
<p>we think of as just this unfortunate thing,</p>
<p>this like we&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s a core energy source</p>
<p>if we ever entered a famine and that&rsquo;s all true, et cetera.</p>
<p>We come to realize that these cells in our body,</p>
<p>they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body,</p>
<p>which is our metabolism.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a third player.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it really gets interesting</p>
<p>that the nervous system, neurons,</p>
<p>has the opportunity to turn up the intensity</p>
<p>of that furnace.</p>
<p>It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat</p>
<p>that we produce and therefore the amount of energy</p>
<p>that we burn.</p>
<p>And I was also really intrigued by something,</p>
<p>which is that growing up, I think we all know people</p>
<p>who can eat a ton and never seem to gain any body fat</p>
<p>or people who seem to eat very little</p>
<p>and seem to gain body fat very easily.</p>
<p>And I was always intrigued by that.</p>
<p>And it turns out there are a number of different factors</p>
<p>that relate to that, but the nervous system</p>
<p>is the one that we can really control,</p>
<p>both through behaviors and what we eat,</p>
<p>but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis.</p>
<p>There was one particular story I want to relate to you</p>
<p>that does not suggest any protocol.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m going to discourage you</p>
<p>from following this protocol.</p>
<p>Please do not try the compound that I&rsquo;m about to describe.</p>
<p>One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab</p>
<p>was to find rare compounds and test them.</p>
<p>And at the time I was reading about thermogenesis</p>
<p>and I learned about a compound that was actually discovered</p>
<p>in the armory factories of World War II.</p>
<p>And it was discovered because women in particular</p>
<p>who were working in these factories would take a brush</p>
<p>and dip it in a compound or a paint rather,</p>
<p>and they would then paint the numbers with a stencil</p>
<p>onto things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds.</p>
<p>And they were losing weight like crazy.</p>
<p>It turns out that occasionally they&rsquo;d lick the brush</p>
<p>and then they would go back</p>
<p>just to get a sharper point on the brush.</p>
<p>And then they would paint onto these various bullets</p>
<p>and missiles and so forth, bombs and so forth.</p>
<p>And they started shedding all their body fat.</p>
<p>And many of them lost a lot of weight,</p>
<p>a significant portion of their weight</p>
<p>without changing anything else that they were doing,</p>
<p>what they were eating, et cetera.</p>
<p>Turned out that that compound</p>
<p>is something called dinitrophenol, DNP.</p>
<p>And over the years, dinitrophenol, DNP,</p>
<p>has gained popularity in some niche cultures,</p>
<p>mainly bodybuilders, athletes,</p>
<p>even in the kind of modeling industry.</p>
<p>It is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to use</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s highly fatal</p>
<p>if your body temperature goes too high.</p>
<p>Hyperthermia will kill you.</p>
<p>And indeed, many people have died</p>
<p>using dinitrophenol as a weight loss drug</p>
<p>or attempting to use it as a weight loss drug.</p>
<p>But dinitrophenol really illustrates a principle,</p>
<p>which is that your metabolism</p>
<p>includes things like thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and growth hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>But your body temperature and the way you utilize energy</p>
<p>is controlled by your nervous system.</p>
<p>And the way dinitrophenol works is by changing the neurons</p>
<p>and the way that the neurons that connect to fat</p>
<p>change the way fat burns up.</p>
<p>So we are not going to suggest,</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that you use dinitrophenol.</p>
<p>However, there are other things that you can do</p>
<p>that can change the relationship between these neurons</p>
<p>and the fat of your body</p>
<p>in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why we don&rsquo;t hear about these things more,</p>
<p>but probably because most of what you see out there</p>
<p>on the internet focuses more on what you could eat</p>
<p>and should eat or shouldn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>It concentrates on exercise regimens,</p>
<p>which we will also talk about.</p>
<p>But the burn factor, your thermogenic environment</p>
<p>is one of the, if not the most important factors</p>
<p>in this business of fat loss.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to talk about.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about fat utilization.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how fat is converted into energy,</p>
<p>which is sometimes also called fat burning.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like you to know</p>
<p>is that this is a two-part process, okay?</p>
<p>In reality, there are many biochemical steps.</p>
<p>And if you log onto the internet or you open up a textbook</p>
<p>and you want to learn about fat utilization,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a lot of chemistry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to go deep into that chemistry if you like,</p>
<p>but I think most of you are probably interested</p>
<p>in what are the leverage points?</p>
<p>Where can you exert control over this process</p>
<p>in ways that benefit you?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to focus mainly on those, okay?</p>
<p>This is not to upset the aficionados,</p>
<p>and I will put in some nomenclature, but here we go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two parts to this process.</p>
<p>One is fat mobilization.</p>
<p>And the second is fat oxidation or utilization, okay?</p>
<p>So the first thing that has to happen</p>
<p>for body fat to get burned up or used and reduced</p>
<p>is that it has to get mobilized.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a process called lipolysis.</p>
<p>But I actually don&rsquo;t care if you know the name lipolysis,</p>
<p>you just have to move that fat</p>
<p>out of the position that it&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>You have to get it out of the fat cells, all right?</p>
<p>Fat cells can be visceral around our viscera, our organs,</p>
<p>or they can be subcutaneous under our skin.</p>
<p>Most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat</p>
<p>when they think about fat.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>And if you want more detail, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch on that in a bit.</p>
<p>But basically stored fat</p>
<p>has two parts that are relevant here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the fatty acid part,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the part that your body can use.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s attached to something called glycerol,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re linked by a backbone.</p>
<p>So already probably too much chemistry for both of you,</p>
<p>but what you want is you want to break the backbone.</p>
<p>So if you just can remember to mobilize fat,</p>
<p>you got to break the backbone</p>
<p>between glycerol and these fatty acids, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s accomplished by an enzyme called lipase,</p>
<p>but you can forget all that if you want.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re just trying to mobilize fat.</p>
<p>So the first step is to get those fatty acids</p>
<p>moving around in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>to get them out of those fat cells.</p>
<p>And then they can travel and be used for energy.</p>
<p>And that second part,</p>
<p>remember, first part is mobilization.</p>
<p>The second part is oxidation,</p>
<p>is then those fatty acids, those are potential fuel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just potential fuel,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t burned the fat yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just moved it out of your fat cells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go into cells</p>
<p>that can use them for energy.</p>
<p>And once they are inside those cells,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still not burned up.</p>
<p>You need to oxidize them.</p>
<p>Think oxidation is the burn up part.</p>
<p>They need to be moved into the mitochondria,</p>
<p>and then they can be converted into ATP, into energy.</p>
<p>So just to really zoom out again</p>
<p>to make sure I don&rsquo;t lose anybody,</p>
<p>you got to mobilize the fat,</p>
<p>then you have to oxidize the fat.</p>
<p>You have to, in other words, you have to mobilize it,</p>
<p>then you actually have to convert it into energy.</p>
<p>If you just mobilize it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t convert it into energy,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t oxidize it,</p>
<p>it can be returned to body fat.</p>
<p>And many of the things that the nervous system can do</p>
<p>is to increase the mobilization of fat,</p>
<p>but also the oxidation of fat, okay?</p>
<p>So you have two opportunities to burn more fat.</p>
<p>And both of those opportunities</p>
<p>are governed by your nervous system,</p>
<p>by neurons that literally send little wires</p>
<p>that we call axons into fat</p>
<p>and release chemicals that provide a stimulus</p>
<p>for more of that fat to be mobilized,</p>
<p>and then later for more of that fat to be burned up, okay?</p>
<p>So we could go really deep on this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to go much deeper than that</p>
<p>because this isn&rsquo;t a biochemistry</p>
<p>of fatty acid metabolism lecture.</p>
<p>This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system.</p>
<p>But remember, there&rsquo;s a mobilization step,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s an oxidation step.</p>
<p>I think any one of you,</p>
<p>all of you should be able to internalize that.</p>
<p>Mobilize, then oxidize, okay?</p>
<p>Mobilize, then oxidize.</p>
<p>So what are these neurons that connect to fat doing?</p>
<p>What are they releasing exactly?</p>
<p>How do they actually increase fat mobilization</p>
<p>and how do they increase fat oxidation, burning of fat?</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of things that they release</p>
<p>that encourage that process.</p>
<p>And the main one that you need to know about</p>
<p>is epinephrine or adrenaline.</p>
<p>The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP</p>
<p>in the mitochondria of cells</p>
<p>is favored by adrenaline, okay?</p>
<p>And adrenaline is released from two sources.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which sit atop our kidneys and our lower back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also released</p>
<p>from the so-called sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>although that name is a bit of a misnomer</p>
<p>because it has nothing to do with sympathy,</p>
<p>has to do with stimulating alertness</p>
<p>and promoting action of the body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big mistake in the literature</p>
<p>that is finally being corrected among those who know.</p>
<p>The mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands</p>
<p>and the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>is what stimulates fat loss and fat oxidation.</p>
<p>In fact, it was thought for a long time</p>
<p>that adrenaline swimming around in your body</p>
<p>of when you&rsquo;re fasted,</p>
<p>because fasting can increase adrenaline,</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re engaging in intense exercise</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re stressed is going to promote fat oxidation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation,</p>
<p>the burning of fat,</p>
<p>is coming from neurons that actually connect to the fat,</p>
<p>not hormones like adrenaline</p>
<p>that are swimming around in your system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a local process.</p>
<p>And this is very important</p>
<p>because it means that what you do,</p>
<p>the specific patterns of movements</p>
<p>and the specific environment you create</p>
<p>that can stimulate these particular neurons</p>
<p>to activate fat,</p>
<p>meaning to release fat, to mobilize it,</p>
<p>and then to burn it is going to be a powerful lever</p>
<p>that you can use in order to increase fat loss.</p>
<p>So what have we said so far?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said that you got to mobilize,</p>
<p>you got to burn fat,</p>
<p>and that your nervous system is in control of that process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about calorie deficit.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>how to activate the nervous system</p>
<p>in ways that it promotes more liberation,</p>
<p>movement, mobilization of fat,</p>
<p>and more oxidation of fat.</p>
<p>So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is also called adrenaline,</p>
<p>from these neurons that connect to fat</p>
<p>and to thereby stimulate more fat mobilization</p>
<p>and oxidation is through movement.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not talking about exercise.</p>
<p>The type of movement that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is extremely subtle.</p>
<p>And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re probably not familiar</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m about to tell you,</p>
<p>which is that shiver or shivering</p>
<p>is a strong stimulus for the release of adrenaline,</p>
<p>epinephrine into fat,</p>
<p>and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization.</p>
<p>But shiver is not just induced by cold,</p>
<p>and there are other subtle forms of movement</p>
<p>that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss.</p>
<p>There was a group in England during the 1960s and 70s</p>
<p>that discovered a pathway</p>
<p>by which subtle forms of movement</p>
<p>can greatly increase fat loss.</p>
<p>This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very famous in the thermogenesis literature.</p>
<p>And I learned about this early on</p>
<p>when I was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>And I asked, how did they come across this?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how the story goes.</p>
<p>They were aware that some people overeat</p>
<p>and yet don&rsquo;t put on weight.</p>
<p>Other people overeat even just a little bit,</p>
<p>and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue.</p>
<p>Now, this is long before all the discussions</p>
<p>about microbiome and hormone factors,</p>
<p>and it was long before many of the hormone factors</p>
<p>besides insulin had even been discovered.</p>
<p>What they did was they examined people who overate</p>
<p>and did not gain weight.</p>
<p>And what they observed was that those people</p>
<p>engaged in lots of subtle movement throughout the day.</p>
<p>In other words, they were fidgeters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they called them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters.</p>
<p>But Rothwell and Stock were British.</p>
<p>What they found were people that overeat</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t gain weight as a consequence.</p>
<p>And in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat</p>
<p>had a lot of resting tremor, not of the Parkinsonian type,</p>
<p>but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting.</p>
<p>When they would talk,</p>
<p>they would engage in very angular movements.</p>
<p>They were sort of electric.</p>
<p>In fact, now in science, I was chuckling about this</p>
<p>as I was diving back into this literature</p>
<p>because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture</p>
<p>on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine,</p>
<p>and we all adore him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s over in Europe</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s this tremendously successful scientist,</p>
<p>so we like to poke fun at him.</p>
<p>And every one of his movements</p>
<p>is incredibly electric and staccato.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s rail thin and he eats like a horse.</p>
<p>And so it fits very well into the discovery</p>
<p>of Rothwell and Stock who discovered that fidgeters,</p>
<p>people that bounce their knee,</p>
<p>people that have a head bob while they&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>people that nod a lot,</p>
<p>people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day,</p>
<p>and people that pace,</p>
<p>burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories more</p>
<p>than the control group in the experiments</p>
<p>that they looked at.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s been a modern look into all this,</p>
<p>and these numbers check out,</p>
<p>that simply moving around a lot,</p>
<p>even if those are subtle movements,</p>
<p>greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn.</p>
<p>And people who overeat,</p>
<p>the people who can have the second or the third donut</p>
<p>or donuts at all,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t seem to put on weight to the same degree,</p>
<p>they are people that move around a lot, even when seated.</p>
<p>There are people that will often move their limbs</p>
<p>very quickly as well.</p>
<p>There even have been studies that have explored</p>
<p>other things that correlate with fidgeters.</p>
<p>Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture,</p>
<p>or they start to gather their things very quickly,</p>
<p>whereas non-fidgeters don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So dogs like my bulldog Costello, definitely not a fidgeter.</p>
<p>Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate.</p>
<p>Sitting down is a process.</p>
<p>If you ask him to sit down, it&rsquo;s sort of a slow motion.</p>
<p>You ask him to get up,</p>
<p>and he kind of looks at you, sighs, and then stands up.</p>
<p>The fidgeters are the opposite of that, right?</p>
<p>You say, how are you doing?</p>
<p>They go, great.</p>
<p>So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated,</p>
<p>although not always,</p>
<p>but staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera.</p>
<p>And in 2015, and again, in 2017,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been studies that have explored this</p>
<p>using some modern metabolic tracking,</p>
<p>and indeed, simply moving a lot,</p>
<p>being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,</p>
<p>standing up and pacing several times</p>
<p>or many times throughout the day</p>
<p>led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss</p>
<p>when people were ingesting the same amount of food.</p>
<p>If they overate, they were able to compensate</p>
<p>and burn off that food.</p>
<p>And if they were trying to lose weight,</p>
<p>and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol</p>
<p>of deliberately trying to fidget more</p>
<p>and move around during the day,</p>
<p>pace, stand up more quickly, sit down more often,</p>
<p>sit down and stand up more often, rather,</p>
<p>they found that they greatly increased their weight loss</p>
<p>anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.</p>
<p>And in some cases,</p>
<p>there are always those few people who burned a lot more.</p>
<p>It seems to work best in people</p>
<p>who are already slightly overweight.</p>
<p>So for people that are overweight,</p>
<p>who are kind of averse to exercise,</p>
<p>fidgeting might actually be a good entry point.</p>
<p>And 800 to 2,500 calories is a considerable amount</p>
<p>of calories when you really think about it.</p>
<p>Now, why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s clearly a tool to export from this,</p>
<p>which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned</p>
<p>without having to go on additional long runs.</p>
<p>I do hope that people are exercising regularly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so important for other aspects</p>
<p>of brain and body health,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, we are all time limited</p>
<p>and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise.</p>
<p>I have a family member</p>
<p>who has been slowly coaxed into exercise,</p>
<p>but if I were to tell her, for instance,</p>
<p>you need to fidget more, she&rsquo;d probably go for it.</p>
<p>So this is a powerful way to increase</p>
<p>the calories that are burned.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s great, and you can think about the protocols,</p>
<p>but I want to nest that protocol in what I said before,</p>
<p>which is that fat is controlled by these neurons</p>
<p>and the epinephrine they release.</p>
<p>You might say, well, how could these little micro movements</p>
<p>lead to so much caloric burn?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it really gets interesting.</p>
<p>Rothwell and Stock and others that they worked with</p>
<p>subsequently found that these little fidgety movements,</p>
<p>the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature</p>
<p>that are nothing like exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not these large coordinated or rhythmic body movements,</p>
<p>but rather subtle little bits of fidgety movement.</p>
<p>And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement.</p>
<p>As an example, tapping the pen, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I was probably that kid in class most of the time.</p>
<p>And I was like, I try not to do it to irritate people,</p>
<p>but I was definitely a knee bouncer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly lean or not,</p>
<p>but I was definitely, this is a common activity for me.</p>
<p>People that do that sort of thing,</p>
<p>it turns out that it&rsquo;s not the kind of caloric burn</p>
<p>that we normally think of, of like, oh, you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>lifting weights, swimming, yoga, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those subtle movements of our core musculature,</p>
<p>not just the core, but all our limbs and our musculature,</p>
<p>those low level movements,</p>
<p>they trigger epinephrine release from these neurons</p>
<p>and they stimulate the mobilization of fat.</p>
<p>And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.</p>
<p>And I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>I wish more people knew about it,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m telling you about it today.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with exercise</p>
<p>in the traditional form.</p>
<p>And yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a considerable amount of fat oxidized.</p>
<p>If you are in a calorie maintenance mode</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re sub caloric,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to add to still additional fat loss.</p>
<p>The data on this are tremendous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll link to a few studies.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really interested in learning</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s called NEAT, N-E-A-T,</p>
<p>which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis, NEAT.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the protocol?</p>
<p>Fidget.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really interested in burning calories</p>
<p>and you already exercise, you want to burn more,</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to exercise</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re averse to exercise for whatever reason,</p>
<p>fidgeting movements, staccato movements,</p>
<p>standing up, walking around, pacing,</p>
<p>all the sort of nervous activities</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re so critical of in other people</p>
<p>and sometimes in ourselves are actually mobilizing</p>
<p>and oxidizing a lot of fat and a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And while this probably won&rsquo;t compensate</p>
<p>for chronic overeating,</p>
<p>the caloric burn from this is considerable</p>
<p>and very likely can offset a meal</p>
<p>that had excessive calories</p>
<p>or a kind of steady state of eating too much.</p>
<p>And it also starts to open up</p>
<p>all sorts of thoughts and discussion about,</p>
<p>you know, when you travel,</p>
<p>you tend to eat foods that are kind of</p>
<p>outside your normal ones.</p>
<p>We tend to eat foods that aren&rsquo;t so great for us.</p>
<p>We also tend to be a little bit more sedentary</p>
<p>when we travel, we&rsquo;re on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>But all of that aside,</p>
<p>just the use of something like low-level movement,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like a tremor,</p>
<p>but also these like short, small, fidgety movements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intentionally doing a lot of these today.</p>
<p>So you have examples that you can use</p>
<p>that to select from if you like.</p>
<p>These can have a major effect on fat loss.</p>
<p>And it raises a second tool.</p>
<p>If these low, meaning these small movements</p>
<p>that we engage in trigger epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline release from these neurons</p>
<p>of the sympathetic nervous system that innervate fat</p>
<p>and increase fat mobilization and oxidation.</p>
<p>Now it should make sense why shivering</p>
<p>is one of the strongest stimuli</p>
<p>that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss.</p>
<p>Now, shivering is almost always associated with cold.</p>
<p>We think shivering, we think cold,</p>
<p>because when we get cold, we shiver.</p>
<p>And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss.</p>
<p>And there are several ways that you can use shivering,</p>
<p>you can leverage shivering,</p>
<p>and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss,</p>
<p>but you have to do it correctly.</p>
<p>And most of the people that are using cold</p>
<p>and frankly suggesting cold</p>
<p>as a means to increase metabolism fat loss</p>
<p>are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.</p>
<p>In fact, the one I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p>
<p>is 180 degrees in the opposite direction</p>
<p>to the typical protocol that you&rsquo;d hear about.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about how to use cold</p>
<p>and how to leverage shiver</p>
<p>as a particularly strong stimulus to increase fat loss</p>
<p>through mobilization and oxidation of these fatty acids.</p>
<p>So in recent years, there&rsquo;s been a growing interest</p>
<p>in the use of cold for various things</p>
<p>like improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism,</p>
<p>recovery from exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about a number of those things</p>
<p>and the uses of cold on this podcast.</p>
<p>In fact, did an episode on how to supercharge performance</p>
<p>through Palmer cooling, cooling the palms in specific ways</p>
<p>or the bottoms of the feet.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in that</p>
<p>and how to improve performance in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>you can check out that episode.</p>
<p>But most people out there are using cold exposure</p>
<p>typically by taking cold showers</p>
<p>or by getting into cold water of some other kind,</p>
<p>a lake or a river or a cold bath or an ice bath.</p>
<p>And they are doing that probably with mixed goals,</p>
<p>meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism</p>
<p>and burn fat as well as improve mental resilience.</p>
<p>Since today we&rsquo;re talking about accelerating fat loss</p>
<p>through the use of science-based tools,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize a study that was published in Nature</p>
<p>just a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have several kinds of fat, three kinds in fact.</p>
<p>We have white fat, white adipose tissue,</p>
<p>and we have brown fat or brown adipose tissue.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a third kind, which is beige adipose tissue.</p>
<p>White fat is the type that we traditionally think of</p>
<p>as fat, subcutaneous fat.</p>
<p>And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria.</p>
<p>It is there as an energy storage site.</p>
<p>And we have to mobilize the fat out</p>
<p>as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades</p>
<p>and on the back of our neck, between the scapulae.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s rich with mitochondria,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s called brown fat.</p>
<p>And brown fat has a particular biochemical cascade</p>
<p>whereby it can take food energy</p>
<p>and it can take food basically,</p>
<p>break it down and convert it into energy within those cells.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some additional steps involved,</p>
<p>but unlike fatty acids from white fat,</p>
<p>which have to travel elsewhere,</p>
<p>get broken down in mitochondria</p>
<p>and convert into ATP, et cetera,</p>
<p>used by the mitochondria rather,</p>
<p>brown fat is thermogenic.</p>
<p>It can actually use energy directly.</p>
<p>It skips a step.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to get diverted</p>
<p>by going into all the biochemistry of it.</p>
<p>Beige fat is sort of in between.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s white fat that could be brown fat</p>
<p>because it has some mitochondria in it,</p>
<p>but not as many as brown fat.</p>
<p>Now, cold exposure does several things.</p>
<p>Making ourselves cold can allow us</p>
<p>to build up mental resilience</p>
<p>because getting into cold of any kind,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a cryo chamber,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a cold day</p>
<p>and you forgot your sweater or your parka,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s an ice bath</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re lying down in the snow.</p>
<p>Cold causes the release of adrenaline from your adrenals.</p>
<p>And it causes the release of epinephrine</p>
<p>from these neurons that connect to fat.</p>
<p>Now, the big effects of cold</p>
<p>on metabolism and fat burning</p>
<p>are going to be through two routes.</p>
<p>One is that if you expose yourself to cold,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity to trigger activation</p>
<p>of brown fat as well as to convert more beige fat</p>
<p>into true brown fat.</p>
<p>So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter furnace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to think about brown fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a furnace.</p>
<p>And so with this principle that we started with</p>
<p>of calories in versus calories burned,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re increasing</p>
<p>the amount of burning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re increasing the burn of energy</p>
<p>by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you,</p>
<p>so to speak, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking here as kind of metaphorically.</p>
<p>Now, how can you do that?</p>
<p>Well, if you get into cold water or an ice bath</p>
<p>or a cold day and you try and remain calm</p>
<p>and resist shivering, you actually short circuit</p>
<p>this mechanism for increasing brown fat thermogenesis.</p>
<p>The paper published in Nature shows</p>
<p>that it is shivering itself</p>
<p>that causes the brown fat to increase your burning,</p>
<p>your burn rate and your metabolism.</p>
<p>And it works like this.</p>
<p>When you get into cold and you shiver,</p>
<p>the shivering, that low level movement of the muscle,</p>
<p>those small movements,</p>
<p>triggers the release of a molecule called succinate,</p>
<p>S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.</p>
<p>And succinate acts on the brown fat</p>
<p>to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning overall.</p>
<p>It actually increases body heat</p>
<p>through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway.</p>
<p>And it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat</p>
<p>by converting beige fat into true brown fat.</p>
<p>Now, how much cold exposure and how often, that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>But before I give that detail or set of details,</p>
<p>remember, if you resist the shiver,</p>
<p>you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect</p>
<p>because you are not going to get the succinate release.</p>
<p>So if you want to get your body heat,</p>
<p>your thermogenic level to go up, you need to shiver.</p>
<p>So now we have the NEAT,</p>
<p>the non-exercise activity thermogenesis.</p>
<p>So low levels of activity, as I described before,</p>
<p>which are done away from cold,</p>
<p>maybe do them in cold as well,</p>
<p>as well as shiver in response to cold.</p>
<p>And so the shiver itself is valuable</p>
<p>for triggering the release of succinate.</p>
<p>In fact, succinate is being evolved now</p>
<p>by various drug manufacturers</p>
<p>as a potential treatment for obesity,</p>
<p>although it hasn&rsquo;t really hit the market</p>
<p>in its final form yet.</p>
<p>Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat.</p>
<p>So how many times a week do you need</p>
<p>to expose yourself to cold</p>
<p>will depend on how much fat you&rsquo;re trying to lose</p>
<p>and how much you&rsquo;re trying to increase your metabolism.</p>
<p>There are studies that describe positive effects</p>
<p>on fat loss of exposing yourself to cold,</p>
<p>either through cold shower or through ice bath</p>
<p>or other cold water,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually have ice in it</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s cold enough,</p>
<p>for anytime, anywhere, excuse me,</p>
<p>between one and five times per week.</p>
<p>But it turns out that just one exposure per week</p>
<p>can be valuable.</p>
<p>The question then is how long</p>
<p>to get into that cold environment</p>
<p>and how cold should that environment be?</p>
<p>So first let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>how long to get into that cold environment.</p>
<p>The answer here might be a little bit different</p>
<p>than you might imagine.</p>
<p>Most of you might think,</p>
<p>oh, well, if one minute is good, three minutes is better.</p>
<p>And if three minutes is better than 10 minutes is best.</p>
<p>But remember the goal</p>
<p>is to get the shiver induced release of succinate</p>
<p>so that succinate can trigger the brown fat.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver,</p>
<p>what you want to do is to get into the cold</p>
<p>and then get out of the cold</p>
<p>and typically not dry off</p>
<p>and then get back into the cold and out of the cold.</p>
<p>That will definitely stimulate more shivering</p>
<p>than just getting into the cold itself.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m not referring to</p>
<p>is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath</p>
<p>and waiting until you shiver</p>
<p>and staying there shivering, okay?</p>
<p>You also don&rsquo;t want to get hypothermic.</p>
<p>And I want to be clear,</p>
<p>you want to get approval from your doctor</p>
<p>before you do any of this.</p>
<p>When you get into cold water,</p>
<p>there are two factors that will dictate</p>
<p>whether or not you shiver.</p>
<p>Probably three, but let&rsquo;s just talk about the main two.</p>
<p>One is how cold it is.</p>
<p>So how cold should it be?</p>
<p>And look, if you get into water that&rsquo;s very, very cold,</p>
<p>it can actually shock your heart.</p>
<p>It can actually give you a heart attack</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s truly, truly ice cold</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not adapted to that.</p>
<p>So proceed with caution, please.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physician and I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone get hurt.</p>
<p>Just cold enough to be uncomfortable</p>
<p>is a good place to start.</p>
<p>So for some of you, that&rsquo;s going to be 60 degrees.</p>
<p>For some of you, that&rsquo;s going to be 55 degrees.</p>
<p>For some of you, it&rsquo;s going to be high 30s, right?</p>
<p>Depends on how cold adapted you are</p>
<p>and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold.</p>
<p>So what you need to do is find a temperature</p>
<p>that you can get into one to five,</p>
<p>probably one to three times a week,</p>
<p>if you really want this to accelerate fat loss.</p>
<p>And you want to get in until you just start to shiver.</p>
<p>And then you want to get out and not dry off.</p>
<p>Wait anywhere from one to three minutes</p>
<p>and then get back into the cold.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll notice when you get back into the cold,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll almost seem soothing.</p>
<p>It might actually not induce shiver.</p>
<p>It might take away the shiver that you had.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a potential kind of sets reps protocol</p>
<p>that you can play with.</p>
<p>Find a temperature that induces shiver for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to vary depending on your cold tolerance</p>
<p>and how cold adapted you are.</p>
<p>One to three, maybe five times a week,</p>
<p>get in until you, or get under the shower</p>
<p>or whatever it is until you start to shiver,</p>
<p>genuinely shiver.</p>
<p>Then after about a minute or so, get out,</p>
<p>spend one to three minutes out, but don&rsquo;t dry off.</p>
<p>Get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes,</p>
<p>but try and access the shiver point again.</p>
<p>And you might do three repetitions of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s three times in and three times out total, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great starting place.</p>
<p>And what you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>is build up your tolerance to cold so fast</p>
<p>that pretty soon you&rsquo;re able to resist the shiver</p>
<p>because remember the shiver is the source</p>
<p>of the succinate release</p>
<p>that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like to see this protocol spelled out,</p>
<p>you can access it zero cost at a website,</p>
<p>which is thecoldplunge.com.</p>
<p>The Cold Plunge is a company, they make cold plunges,</p>
<p>and they were kind enough to gift one</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize that these protocols</p>
<p>are free of cost.</p>
<p>The folks at The Cold Plunge are not just interested</p>
<p>in marketing their product,</p>
<p>but one of their main interests is encouraging people</p>
<p>to engage in cold exposure</p>
<p>for particular end points and goals,</p>
<p>like fat loss, resilience, et cetera,</p>
<p>resisting inflammation.</p>
<p>But their main focus is providing people protocols</p>
<p>and encouraging people to use cold exposure of various kinds,</p>
<p>not just through their products, but through cold rivers</p>
<p>and jumps in the ocean and things that cold showers,</p>
<p>whatever is most convenient</p>
<p>and accessible for various people.</p>
<p>And so we needed a place</p>
<p>where we could house these protocols in a permanent way,</p>
<p>and not just for this episode.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;ve agreed to do is to post the protocols there.</p>
<p>They should be very easy to find on their website.</p>
<p>This particular protocol we&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>as the Fat Loss Optimization Protocol,</p>
<p>for lack of a better name.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really grounded in how cold can be used</p>
<p>to induce shiver.</p>
<p>And again, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re accessing that cold,</p>
<p>provided you access the shiver,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re moving from the cold environment</p>
<p>to a slightly warmer environment.</p>
<p>So getting out of the cold shower,</p>
<p>or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,</p>
<p>or out of the cold plunge, and then back in.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that the cooling</p>
<p>and rewarming process of the body is where shiver kicks in.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s distinctly different</p>
<p>than just trying to get into the cold</p>
<p>and stay in the cold for as long as possible.</p>
<p>And if you zoom out a little bit</p>
<p>and think about some examples in life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll understand why that must be the case.</p>
<p>For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims,</p>
<p>you have these polar bear clubs,</p>
<p>I think they call themselves,</p>
<p>do these cold water swims.</p>
<p>I would sometimes see these people swimming back and forth</p>
<p>to Alcatraz and stuff like that, which just seems risky.</p>
<p>And they tell me it&rsquo;s very stimulating</p>
<p>for the mind and body, great.</p>
<p>Sometimes those people are very lean.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re getting a lot of cold exposure.</p>
<p>And one of the things that happens</p>
<p>is if you expose yourself to cold over and over,</p>
<p>you adapt, you become cold adapted.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you no longer get the epinephrine,</p>
<p>the adrenaline release from the cold.</p>
<p>And therefore you don&rsquo;t get the succinate release</p>
<p>and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect</p>
<p>quite as intensely.</p>
<p>So if you want to use cold for other reasons,</p>
<p>certainly cold water swims can be fun.</p>
<p>And as long as you can do them safely, they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten into cold water swimming</p>
<p>for some period of time.</p>
<p>You can use cold for resilience, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss,</p>
<p>then getting this shiver process going,</p>
<p>the cooling and rewarming, which accelerates the amount</p>
<p>or increases the amount of shiver,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be the way to go.</p>
<p>One note about cold and some of the factors</p>
<p>that it releases.</p>
<p>A few years back, there was a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,</p>
<p>which was associated with cold.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about its potential role in increasing metabolism,</p>
<p>so much so that people were starting to explore this</p>
<p>as a potential fat loss drug.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, that went nowhere.</p>
<p>The science eventually shifted over to succinate</p>
<p>as the main factor in cold-induced thermogenesis</p>
<p>through this brown fat pathway.</p>
<p>But if anyone out there is aware of any positive effects</p>
<p>of irisin or of any science of irisin</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m overlooking here</p>
<p>or that I&rsquo;m speaking about incorrectly,</p>
<p>please let me know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious to learn.</p>
<p>Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more</p>
<p>and talk about a period in your life</p>
<p>in which you were rich with brown fat.</p>
<p>You had a ton of brown fat,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you were a baby.</p>
<p>Babies can&rsquo;t shiver.</p>
<p>These neurons that release epinephrine into fat</p>
<p>are not wired up and really aren&rsquo;t present</p>
<p>at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers</p>
<p>when you are a baby.</p>
<p>And therefore, you can&rsquo;t shiver as a baby,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t warm yourself up</p>
<p>in cold environments very well.</p>
<p>To compensate for that,</p>
<p>Mother Nature installed in all of us</p>
<p>an excess of brown fat early in life</p>
<p>that exists, again, in the upper back,</p>
<p>in the middle of the back, and the back of the neck.</p>
<p>Over time, if we don&rsquo;t expose ourselves</p>
<p>to cold environments or do other things</p>
<p>that make us shiver, we lose a lot of that brown fat.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting about brown fat</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s some evidence that brown fat,</p>
<p>just like white fat, can both increase in size,</p>
<p>but that you can also add new cells.</p>
<p>Now, this is a little bit controversial.</p>
<p>People always say,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t change the number of fat cells.</p>
<p>You can just shrink them or increase their size.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that epinephrine released</p>
<p>from these little nerve endings in brown fat</p>
<p>and suconate circulating in the body may,</p>
<p>and I want to underscore may,</p>
<p>have the effect of increasing the amount of brown fat cells</p>
<p>probably by converting these beige fat cells</p>
<p>into brown fat.</p>
<p>So that allows us to become much as we were early in life</p>
<p>where we metabolized like crazy,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d heat ourselves up without shivering.</p>
<p>Some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme,</p>
<p>putting ice packs on the back of their neck</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this, let&rsquo;s just call it a very niche,</p>
<p>I have to imagine very, very niche culture</p>
<p>of people who are wearing, literally, I&rsquo;m not joking,</p>
<p>they are these cool pack, ice pack underpants.</p>
<p>They go by a name that I&rsquo;m not going to repeat on here,</p>
<p>but you can find them on Amazon.</p>
<p>Those are people that are using cold packs on the body</p>
<p>and on the groin to try and increase things like testosterone</p>
<p>but as well to try and increase thermogenesis</p>
<p>and trying to increase their metabolism.</p>
<p>Just remember, if you become cold adapted,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get the fat burning effects</p>
<p>to the same degree.</p>
<p>So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to adapt.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of a rule that you hear about</p>
<p>in endurance exercise and in strength exercise as well,</p>
<p>which is that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus</p>
<p>to promote growth or progress,</p>
<p>so growth of the muscle or improvements in endurance.</p>
<p>If you go 10% further on a run or 10% faster,</p>
<p>you will likely see an improvement in performance</p>
<p>provided you recovery the next time you come back</p>
<p>and do that same round of exercise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to do more work</p>
<p>or complete the work more easily, et cetera, you&rsquo;ve adapted.</p>
<p>If you do 20% more distance or 20% more weight,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t necessarily see the same commiserate level</p>
<p>of gain or improvement.</p>
<p>And so likewise with cold,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re quickly moving from 30 seconds of exposure</p>
<p>to 10 minutes of exposure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re overlooking the opportunity</p>
<p>to get the most fat loss and increase in metabolism</p>
<p>by stepping it up in smaller increments, okay?</p>
<p>And this also speaks to the rationale</p>
<p>for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss</p>
<p>for certain periods, but then maybe not doing it year round</p>
<p>if fat loss is your goal.</p>
<p>Maybe use it for two, three months at a time</p>
<p>and then stop for two, three months at a time</p>
<p>because it is such a potent stimulus</p>
<p>provided you engage in the shiver.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to move to exercise</p>
<p>and how particular timing and types of exercise</p>
<p>can vastly improve fat loss.</p>
<p>Before I do that, I just want to mention</p>
<p>a really important reference for those of you</p>
<p>that are interested in learning more</p>
<p>about how neurons connect to fat.</p>
<p>This is certainly a paper that you&rsquo;d want to look at</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in diving deep into the literature</p>
<p>and reading all the various studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a review, and the title of the review</p>
<p>is Neural Innervation of White Adipose Tissue</p>
<p>and the Control of Lipolysis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Neural Innervation of White Adipose Tissue</p>
<p>and the Control of Lipolysis.</p>
<p>It was published in Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology.</p>
<p>You can find that free online.</p>
<p>They have the full text available.</p>
<p>The first author is Bartnes, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great review, and I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>a number of things that are mentioned in the review.</p>
<p>Follow the references in that review</p>
<p>and the reference trail, as we say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about</p>
<p>also how neurons control brown fat.</p>
<p>And before I move to exercise,</p>
<p>I also just want to highlight something</p>
<p>that comes up every few years</p>
<p>and has largely been considered myth now,</p>
<p>but that is actually more interesting</p>
<p>than most people might think,</p>
<p>which is this issue of spot reduction.</p>
<p>You know, in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>there were a lot of commercials, late night infomercials,</p>
<p>where they would talk about spot reduction.</p>
<p>You know, if you do sit-ups, will you lose abdominal fat?</p>
<p>If you do hip raises or glute raises,</p>
<p>will you lose glute and hip fat?</p>
<p>And I think everybody now believes that</p>
<p>and understands that fat metabolism</p>
<p>is something that happens systemically throughout the body,</p>
<p>that some body fat is, quote-unquote,</p>
<p>more stubborn than others.</p>
<p>Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat</p>
<p>or lose fat last,</p>
<p>number of factors that influence that,</p>
<p>in particular, hormone receptors.</p>
<p>But now, at least in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>spot reduction and the possibility</p>
<p>of real, true spot reduction,</p>
<p>reductions in fat in a targeted way,</p>
<p>a body part or body area targeted way,</p>
<p>is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon</p>
<p>because exercise that triggers the activation</p>
<p>of these nerve fibers, these neurons that innervate fat,</p>
<p>in theory, if you can increase the amount of epinephrine</p>
<p>released at those particular fat pads, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually called fat pads</p>
<p>in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>in theory, you could increase mobilization</p>
<p>from those particular body fat sites, okay?</p>
<p>So because the new view, the modern understanding,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not adrenaline released systemically,</p>
<p>kind of bathing all your fat tissue,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s neurons releasing adrenaline,</p>
<p>epinephrine, locally, that in theory,</p>
<p>exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrine</p>
<p>or exercise coupled with things like shiver</p>
<p>or low-grade shaking movement or the NEAT,</p>
<p>the non-exercise activity, thermogenesis,</p>
<p>could, in theory, lead to local enhancement</p>
<p>of mobilization of fat tissue.</p>
<p>So I think that spot reduction</p>
<p>actually will soon be something that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>using the appropriate technology.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you now?</p>
<p>What could you possibly do with this information now?</p>
<p>Well, I think it speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that if one is going to engage in exercise,</p>
<p>that doing exercise that involve</p>
<p>lots of different body parts and movements</p>
<p>is likely to encourage the maintenance</p>
<p>and or growth of these neurons</p>
<p>that innervate fat throughout the body.</p>
<p>What this means is changing up the pattern of exercise,</p>
<p>engaging in novel types of movements</p>
<p>may actually be one way that one can access</p>
<p>these so-called stubborn body fat pads.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a little bit of speculation</p>
<p>in the statement that I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>but if you think about it, it makes sense.</p>
<p>If you become very adapted</p>
<p>to a particular pattern of exercise,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re subcaloric or not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on maintenance calories or not,</p>
<p>you are oxidizing some fat always,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re utilizing the neurons that innervate fat</p>
<p>in a regular way, and pretty soon,</p>
<p>this innervation is going to shut off</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no reason why this neural innervation of fat</p>
<p>should continue to release epinephrine</p>
<p>unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold</p>
<p>or the fidgeting, or in this case,</p>
<p>to do novel forms of exercise.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some anecdotal evidence,</p>
<p>and there, I don&rsquo;t even want to call it data,</p>
<p>but anecdotal evidence that people</p>
<p>who have quote-unquote stubborn body fat,</p>
<p>if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise,</p>
<p>they can start to access those stubborn fat pads.</p>
<p>And again, fat pads is the correct way to refer to these</p>
<p>in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re focusing on today is the fact that fat</p>
<p>indeed will be mobilized and oxidized</p>
<p>in response to a deficit in calories,</p>
<p>but that the way that neurons control those fat pads</p>
<p>and those body fat stores affords you a lot more control</p>
<p>than perhaps you ever previously thought.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about movement</p>
<p>and the more traditional kinds of movement,</p>
<p>aka exercise, that has been shown to lead</p>
<p>to increases in metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasted when you do it or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you do your cardio first</p>
<p>or your resistance training first.</p>
<p>And this is, again, in a literature</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy,</p>
<p>but in digging through all the studies on this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re finally starting to arrive at a consensus</p>
<p>of when is best to do exercise</p>
<p>and what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss.</p>
<p>The topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one,</p>
<p>not as controversial as nutrition and diet,</p>
<p>which we will talk about in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a particularly interesting one</p>
<p>because different types of exercise</p>
<p>engage the musculature of the body</p>
<p>and the heart and the lungs in different ways</p>
<p>and can have vastly different effects</p>
<p>on things like hormones and metabolism,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it&rsquo;s of high intensity,</p>
<p>moderate intensity, or low intensity.</p>
<p>So rather than think about weight training</p>
<p>versus cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>I think the most simple way,</p>
<p>the most fluid way to have this conversation</p>
<p>about exercise and fat loss</p>
<p>is in terms of three general types of training,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s done with weights or body weight,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>And those are high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>something that seems to have gained a lot of popularity</p>
<p>in recent years, so-called HIIT, H-I-I-T,</p>
<p>so high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>sprint interval training,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s going to be very high intensity or S-I-T,</p>
<p>or moderate intensity continuous training, M-I-C-T.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got HIIT, SIT, and MICT, M-I-C-T.</p>
<p>And we can get a little bit more precise if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not somebody who measures my VO2 max or anything</p>
<p>while I exercise.</p>
<p>I generally know whether or not I&rsquo;m doing something</p>
<p>I could continue for a very long time</p>
<p>or whether or not I&rsquo;m doing something</p>
<p>that I realize is going to be</p>
<p>of short duration, high intensity.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;d like to map this to VO2 max,</p>
<p>S-I-T, this sprint interval training,</p>
<p>was defined as all out greater than 100% of VO2 max</p>
<p>bursts of activity that last eight to 30 seconds</p>
<p>interspersed with less intense recovery period.</p>
<p>So this would be sprinting down field for eight to 30 seconds</p>
<p>then maybe walking back for about a minute or two</p>
<p>and then sprinting again and then continuing.</p>
<p>So that would be S-I-T.</p>
<p>HIIT, H-I-I-T, is defined as submaximal,</p>
<p>so 80 to 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity</p>
<p>that last 60 to 240 seconds</p>
<p>interspersed with less intense recovery periods.</p>
<p>So on a standard 400 meter track,</p>
<p>just to give us a little bit of a visual,</p>
<p>a four minute mile would be fantastic for most people,</p>
<p>although people run faster than that, of course.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s four 60 second laps,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s back to back to back.</p>
<p>I think in my best shape or maybe it was in my dreams,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall which,</p>
<p>I was able to do 60 seconds around the track,</p>
<p>but of course I couldn&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>on the second or third or fourth.</p>
<p>If I did, that was certainly in fantasy land and not reality</p>
<p>but 60 seconds would be about one revolution</p>
<p>around the track, maybe 90 seconds,</p>
<p>depending on how fast one is running.</p>
<p>So 60 to 240 seconds.</p>
<p>M-I-C-T, okay?</p>
<p>This moderate intensity continuous training</p>
<p>is steady state cardio,</p>
<p>sometimes called zone two cardio these days</p>
<p>on the internet,</p>
<p>which is performed continuously for 20 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>at moderate intensity of 40 to 60% of VO2 max.</p>
<p>Or if you prefer heart rate 55 to 70% of max heart rate.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So we can think about high, medium</p>
<p>and low intensity exercise.</p>
<p>Although low intensity usually means</p>
<p>that you could carry on a conversation</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;d have to gasp every few steps or so</p>
<p>while trying to talk and run.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think going to be the most useful way</p>
<p>to have this conversation that we&rsquo;re having now</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many different forms of exercise</p>
<p>that people do and intensity is important.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask the question that I think many of people</p>
<p>are wondering about, which is, is it better,</p>
<p>meaning do you burn more fat if you do your exercise fasted?</p>
<p>And fasted in this respect could be</p>
<p>that you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been fasting all night,</p>
<p>you just hydrate and you exercise.</p>
<p>Or sometimes people will ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s controversy as to whether or not</p>
<p>that quote unquote breaks the fast,</p>
<p>has to do with whether or not your caffeine adapted</p>
<p>something for another episode.</p>
<p>In any case, that would be fasted.</p>
<p>So probably not having eaten anything</p>
<p>for anywhere from three to 24 hours or maybe even more.</p>
<p>As you could also be fasted in the afternoon</p>
<p>if you had lunch at noon and it&rsquo;s four or five or 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Is it, will you burn more fat if you exercise</p>
<p>without eating anything first,</p>
<p>without ingesting any calories first?</p>
<p>And people have tried to really split hairs</p>
<p>on this every which way.</p>
<p>People say, well, you can fat fast</p>
<p>because fat and protein doesn&rsquo;t lead</p>
<p>to as great increases in insulin as other things.</p>
<p>Maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train.</p>
<p>And indeed, insulin will prevent fat oxidation.</p>
<p>I want to be really clear.</p>
<p>The burning part of fat in the cell,</p>
<p>the movement of the fatty acid to mitochondria</p>
<p>and the conversion to ATP, insulin inhibits that process.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s been shown that at least</p>
<p>for short periods of training,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to matter</p>
<p>whether or not you eat before training or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if your goal is fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Now, I want to put an asterisk near that</p>
<p>because there are some exceptions,</p>
<p>but there were several studies done</p>
<p>and kind of the classic ones of these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read out to you.</p>
<p>What they basically did is they gave people glucose,</p>
<p>sugar, to increase their blood sugar before training or not.</p>
<p>And the kind of classic study of this is Alborg et al.</p>
<p>So 1976, so it goes way back,</p>
<p>which is that glucose reduces fat burning in exercise.</p>
<p>And then some other studies, if you want to look these up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very easy to find on PubMed.</p>
<p>You put in Horowitz, 1999.</p>
<p>Lee et al is another one where they have people drink milk</p>
<p>with glucose in it.</p>
<p>So sweet, sugary milk before exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you can find a number of examples</p>
<p>where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s oxidized during the exercise.</p>
<p>And you can also find a lot of studies showing</p>
<p>that eating during exercise or prior to exercise</p>
<p>will not reduce the amount of fat that&rsquo;s oxidized.</p>
<p>However, the types of exercise,</p>
<p>whether that was medium intensity or high intensity</p>
<p>or low intensity is all over the map for these studies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to target an ideal protocol.</p>
<p>And then if you look really deep in the literature,</p>
<p>you start to find meta-analyses</p>
<p>where people have actually aggregated all the findings</p>
<p>and some modern studies where it points</p>
<p>to some very specific and useful protocols.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s the rule or the protocol</p>
<p>that I extracted from that literature.</p>
<p>At a period of about 90 minutes</p>
<p>of moderate intensity exercise, I want to be clear,</p>
<p>after at about or after 90 minutes</p>
<p>of moderate intensity exercise,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a switch over point</p>
<p>whereby if you ate before the exercise,</p>
<p>you will reduce, excuse me,</p>
<p>you will burn far less fat</p>
<p>from the 90 minute point onward</p>
<p>than you would if you had gone into the training fasted.</p>
<p>So let me repeat that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s moderate intensity,</p>
<p>so-called zone two cardio type exercise,</p>
<p>at the 90 minute point,</p>
<p>if you happen to have eaten before the exercise</p>
<p>within one to three hours prior to the exercise,</p>
<p>then you reduce the amount of fat</p>
<p>that you will burn from 90 minutes onward.</p>
<p>Whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise,</p>
<p>you hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything for three hours</p>
<p>or more prior to the exercise,</p>
<p>at the 90 minute point,</p>
<p>you will, 90 minutes of exercise,</p>
<p>you will start to burn more fat</p>
<p>than you would had you eaten.</p>
<p>Now, 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise is a lot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pretty long run.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re running at a pretty slow pace,</p>
<p>like a 10 or 12 minute mile,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of running.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of swimming.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of walking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of hiking.</p>
<p>However, there are people who are going out hiking all day</p>
<p>or running all day or walking all day.</p>
<p>And if you want to burn more fat per unit time,</p>
<p>you want to oxidize more fat,</p>
<p>then you would do that fasted.</p>
<p>Now, there are also studies</p>
<p>that point to the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to wait to 90 minutes</p>
<p>in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect.</p>
<p>The studies I was able to find</p>
<p>and that looked to me like quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>with no company bias or no product bias of any kind.</p>
<p>These are studies that were largely funded</p>
<p>by the federal government in the university context,</p>
<p>pointed to the fact that if one does high intensity training</p>
<p>or even the very high intensity forms of training</p>
<p>like sprints or squats or deadlifts</p>
<p>or any kind of activity that can&rsquo;t be maintained</p>
<p>for more than these, you know,</p>
<p>eight or I would say up to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>So a set of lifting weights, repeated, repeated.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s done for anywhere from 20 minutes,</p>
<p>so weight training or power lifting</p>
<p>or these kinds of things or kettlebell swings</p>
<p>or up to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>well then the switch over point</p>
<p>in which you can burn more fat</p>
<p>if you go into that fasted comes earlier.</p>
<p>And this makes sense because there&rsquo;s nothing wholly</p>
<p>about the 90 minute point</p>
<p>for medium intensity zone two cardio.</p>
<p>That 90 minute point is the point</p>
<p>in which the body shifts over from mainly burning glycogen,</p>
<p>basically sugar that comes from muscles or the liver</p>
<p>and realizes this is going on for a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to shift over to a storage site fuel</p>
<p>that is in reserve like body fat.</p>
<p>This is going to happen for a while.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to start tapping into body fat stores.</p>
<p>Now, fat doesn&rsquo;t have a little brain there.</p>
<p>It is innervated by neurons, but it doesn&rsquo;t have thoughts.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t actually control this switch with your mind.</p>
<p>This is something that has to do</p>
<p>with the milieu of various hormones.</p>
<p>What has to happen is insulin has to go down far enough.</p>
<p>So if you ate before the exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have an increase in insulin.</p>
<p>If you ate carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a bigger increase in insulin,</p>
<p>fat and proteins indeed will have lower amounts of insulin</p>
<p>and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin.</p>
<p>Well, then that switch over point</p>
<p>is going to come earlier in the exercise.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>if you were to do something high intensity</p>
<p>for 20, 30, 40 minutes,</p>
<p>so maybe lift weights and then get into zone two cardio,</p>
<p>if you were fasted,</p>
<p>the literature says that you&rsquo;re going to burn more body fat</p>
<p>per unit time than if you had eaten before</p>
<p>or during the exercise.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means if you want to burn more body fat,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in your protocols</p>
<p>and you have been approved to do this safely,</p>
<p>exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>the higher the intensity,</p>
<p>obviously the shorter that bout is going to be</p>
<p>and then move over into zone two cardio.</p>
<p>And if you do that fasted</p>
<p>or the medium intensity cardio, I should say,</p>
<p>and if you do that fasted,</p>
<p>then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat.</p>
<p>If you need to eat or you like to eat before you train,</p>
<p>that also can work.</p>
<p>And if you train very intensely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to shift over to the fat burning pattern</p>
<p>more quickly as well.</p>
<p>So again, this isn&rsquo;t really an issue</p>
<p>of how long you exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an issue of how intensely you exercise</p>
<p>and therefore what fuel source you&rsquo;re drawing from.</p>
<p>So hopefully I&rsquo;ve made that clear,</p>
<p>but basically you need to deplete glycogen</p>
<p>or through high intensity exercise</p>
<p>and then move to a steady state exercise</p>
<p>that will allow you to burn more fat,</p>
<p>or you need to perform a medium intensity</p>
<p>or low intensity type exercise for a long period of time</p>
<p>before you shift over to burning fat.</p>
<p>And indeed, it seems that going into all that fasted</p>
<p>will facilitate the burning of more fat overall.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t even get to the exercise,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who just can&rsquo;t do the training at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unwilling to or you&rsquo;re incapable of training</p>
<p>unless you eat something,</p>
<p>then obviously eating something makes the most sense.</p>
<p>And what you eat prior to exercise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole other biz that people argue about</p>
<p>and fight about whether or not you should go into it</p>
<p>with low carbohydrates or high carbohydrates, all of that.</p>
<p>But in general, the theme there is very simple,</p>
<p>which is that you want insulin levels to be pretty low</p>
<p>if your goal is body fat reduction,</p>
<p>if you want to oxidize body fat.</p>
<p>So fasting in some cases, fat fasting in other cases</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just ingesting fats,</p>
<p>fat and protein in some cases,</p>
<p>or for some people that will be eating carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to dictate a particular nutrition regimen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how the hormone balance of these things</p>
<p>and fat oxidation works.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>and cannot be overlooked is this issue</p>
<p>of how much energy you burn during and after the activity.</p>
<p>And some of you probably already know about this,</p>
<p>but the whole business of calories in versus calories out</p>
<p>and people counting the number of calories they burn</p>
<p>during their aerobic session</p>
<p>or during their whatever session</p>
<p>is only one half of the equation.</p>
<p>And it really eclipses the more important issue,</p>
<p>which is how much of an increase in metabolism</p>
<p>does a given exercise create after the exercise?</p>
<p>And we could talk for hours about this,</p>
<p>but the simple way to view this</p>
<p>is that high intensity training, anaerobic training</p>
<p>of weight training, sprints, burpees, any kind of thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, these days I hear</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not supposed to do burpees,</p>
<p>that people think burpees are dangerous.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not suggesting any particular movements here,</p>
<p>you have to decide what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>I do burpees, I don&rsquo;t seem to be injured from them,</p>
<p>but I hear that they&rsquo;re terrible for some people.</p>
<p>So anyway, pushups, sit-ups, whatever it happens to be,</p>
<p>that anaerobic exercise that&rsquo;s of higher intensity</p>
<p>or sprints taps into glycogen stores during the movement</p>
<p>and will burn more energy per unit time</p>
<p>than moderate intensity.</p>
<p>High intensity burns more than moderate intensity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s straightforward.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that all the studies</p>
<p>that I was able to find on what happens</p>
<p>after that type of exercise showed that the percentage</p>
<p>of fat that you burn after high intensity exercise</p>
<p>is actually greater.</p>
<p>In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen</p>
<p>during the high intensity exercise,</p>
<p>and then after the exercise,</p>
<p>the post-exercise oxygen consumption,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s sometimes called, goes up.</p>
<p>We know this after you train intensely,</p>
<p>that post-exercise oxygen consumption goes up,</p>
<p>sometimes for up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>And it is during that period of time</p>
<p>that you oxidize more fat, not glycogen.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that the reverse is also true.</p>
<p>For people that do long bouts</p>
<p>of low or moderate intensity exercise,</p>
<p>so typically this would be things like running,</p>
<p>swimming, biking, et cetera.</p>
<p>So 60, 90 minutes, two hours,</p>
<p>maybe even people that are training for marathons</p>
<p>or half marathons, when they stop training,</p>
<p>they burn more glycogen, more carbohydrate,</p>
<p>even though they were burning more body fat per unit time</p>
<p>during the low intensity exercise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of inversion.</p>
<p>High intensity burns more glycogen during the activity,</p>
<p>more body fat afterwards.</p>
<p>Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage-wise,</p>
<p>more body fat is oxidized than glycogen</p>
<p>during the actual exercise.</p>
<p>Afterward, it&rsquo;s more glycogen.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want this to get too complicated.</p>
<p>The point is you should pick exercise that you like,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do regularly,</p>
<p>but it does seem that the high intensity exercise</p>
<p>followed by moderate intensity exercise</p>
<p>is going to be optimal for fat burning overall,</p>
<p>because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned</p>
<p>and you look at the overall increase</p>
<p>in basal metabolic rate,</p>
<p>moderate and high intensity training</p>
<p>followed by low intensity training,</p>
<p>or even just followed by going back into life</p>
<p>is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat</p>
<p>because of the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Now, this could be distilled into a simple protocol</p>
<p>whereby three or four times a week,</p>
<p>you do high intensity training followed by either nothing</p>
<p>or followed by low intensity training,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re able to do that fasted.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that none of this stuff</p>
<p>about fasted is about performance.</p>
<p>If you want to perform really well,</p>
<p>you want to, this is for reasons of performance</p>
<p>and you want to, you know, it&rsquo;s for a sport or a competition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for body fat purposes.</p>
<p>Well, then all of this kind of falls away</p>
<p>and is modified by what&rsquo;s ideal to eat for performance.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>is how to optimize body fat, body fat loss.</p>
<p>So train moderately to intensely, to very high intensity</p>
<p>and then moderate to low intensity</p>
<p>or train moderate to high intensity and then go about life.</p>
<p>And in fact, I have a friend who uses this strategy.</p>
<p>He likes to train intensely and not that often protocol</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a very busy person.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;ll train for 20 or 30 minutes intensely with weights</p>
<p>or just body weight movement, doing a lot.</p>
<p>He does burpees and pushups and sit ups and pull ups</p>
<p>and just kind of moving and kind of circuit type training.</p>
<p>But where he&rsquo;s breathing really hard,</p>
<p>the goal he always says is I want to breathe hard</p>
<p>for 30 minutes every day.</p>
<p>And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee</p>
<p>and moves into his day and he&rsquo;s walking around</p>
<p>and taking calls and carrying around his children</p>
<p>and doing all these kinds of things</p>
<p>that keep him really busy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like low intensity work.</p>
<p>So I think you get the principle now,</p>
<p>but you should all be asking yourselves</p>
<p>as scientists of yourselves,</p>
<p>why would it be that certain patterns of exercise</p>
<p>would lead to more or less fat loss?</p>
<p>I mean, it can&rsquo;t just be about the energy burned.</p>
<p>We already established that.</p>
<p>And again, it has to do with the neurons.</p>
<p>It has to do with how we engage the nervous system.</p>
<p>So while non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis,</p>
<p>NEAT, the fidgeting and cold can induce thermogenesis</p>
<p>by engaging shiver type movement or low level movements.</p>
<p>Big movements that are of very high intensity,</p>
<p>meaning they require a lot of effort,</p>
<p>deploy a lot of adrenaline, epinephrine from our neurons</p>
<p>and signal particular types and amounts</p>
<p>of fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Whereas low level intensity exercise,</p>
<p>low or moderate intensity exercise,</p>
<p>you know, walking, running, biking,</p>
<p>where you can do that easily,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not very much adrenaline release.</p>
<p>So adrenaline and aka epinephrine</p>
<p>is really the final common path</p>
<p>by which movement of any kind,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s low level shiver,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s lifting a barbell,</p>
<p>sprinting up a hill or doing a long bike ride.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trigger and it&rsquo;s the effector.</p>
<p>So now I want to turn our attention to compounds</p>
<p>that increase epinephrine and adrenaline,</p>
<p>as well as compounds that work outside</p>
<p>the adrenaline epinephrine pathway</p>
<p>to increase the rates of fat loss.</p>
<p>I almost always save compounds and supplements</p>
<p>and things of that sort to the end,</p>
<p>because I do believe that people should look first</p>
<p>toward behavioral tools and an understanding of the science</p>
<p>before they look toward a supplement</p>
<p>or a particular thing that they can extract from diet.</p>
<p>This is mainly to try and shift people away</p>
<p>from the kind of magic pill phenomenon</p>
<p>or the idea that there is a magic pill</p>
<p>because there really isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and frankly, there never will be.</p>
<p>But there are some compounds that can greatly increase</p>
<p>fat oxidation and mobilization.</p>
<p>And understanding which compounds</p>
<p>increase oxidation or mobilization</p>
<p>can be very useful if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.</p>
<p>There are things that people can ingest</p>
<p>that will allow them to oxidize more fat.</p>
<p>And that occurs mainly by increasing the amount</p>
<p>of epinephrine that is released from neurons</p>
<p>that innervate fat tissue.</p>
<p>One of the more common ones is one</p>
<p>that you may already be using, which is caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-established that caffeine can enhance performance</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re caffeine adapted.</p>
<p>I talked about this in an earlier episode,</p>
<p>so I want to make sure I&rsquo;m very clear about this.</p>
<p>If you are not used to drinking caffeine</p>
<p>and you suddenly decide I&rsquo;m going to drink</p>
<p>a big cup of coffee before training,</p>
<p>you will vasoconstrict and you will limit performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re caffeine adapted, however,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>where ingestion of caffeine serves more</p>
<p>as a performance enhancer, both by increasing alertness,</p>
<p>but also by way of dilating vasculature,</p>
<p>of allowing more blood flow.</p>
<p>Now, caffeine for burning more fat,</p>
<p>for oxidizing and mobilizing more fat is an interesting one.</p>
<p>It can be effective at dosages up to 400 milligrams.</p>
<p>You have to be careful if you&rsquo;re caffeine sensitive.</p>
<p>Some people have just the littlest bit of caffeine</p>
<p>and their mind goes crazy and they&rsquo;re very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It can have cardiovascular effects</p>
<p>for some people with hypertension, et cetera.</p>
<p>So please check with your doctor.</p>
<p>But 400 milligrams is roughly a cup and a half of coffee</p>
<p>or two cups of coffee.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot more caffeine in coffee.</p>
<p>So if you go to a typical cafe</p>
<p>and you were to get their medium size,</p>
<p>that would have close to a gram of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is why if you&rsquo;re a regular caffeine consumer</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get that gram of caffeine</p>
<p>in your coffee each day, you will get a headache.</p>
<p>It can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels</p>
<p>in ways that&rsquo;s complicated, but you&rsquo;ll get a headache.</p>
<p>Some people like the way they feel,</p>
<p>drinking 100 to 200, 300,</p>
<p>maybe even 400 milligrams of caffeine before training.</p>
<p>And indeed that will lead to increased fat oxidation.</p>
<p>It will do that because you will release</p>
<p>more epinephrine and adrenaline.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just place this in the context</p>
<p>of what we said previously.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you normally do zone two cardio.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going out for a moderately intense run</p>
<p>for 30 to 60 minutes or so.</p>
<p>I think the current recommendation guidelines in the States</p>
<p>are that people engage in 30 minutes</p>
<p>of moderate intensity exercise five days a week</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 150 minutes,</p>
<p>if their goal is to improve or maintain health</p>
<p>of the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>80% of people in the United States fail to do that</p>
<p>or anything close to it.</p>
<p>We are way below threshold</p>
<p>for what the government has recommended.</p>
<p>In this case, the government recommendations</p>
<p>I think are pretty good.</p>
<p>One could always do better, of course,</p>
<p>but 80% of people aren&rsquo;t even doing that.</p>
<p>However, just using the logic and the understanding</p>
<p>of how epinephrine, adrenaline</p>
<p>is affecting this fat oxidation process.</p>
<p>If you were to go out for 15 minutes</p>
<p>and you drank caffeine before you went,</p>
<p>yes, you will probably oxidize more fat per unit time.</p>
<p>Can you compensate for the exercise you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>just by drinking caffeine?</p>
<p>Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss,</p>
<p>if that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right?</p>
<p>The amount of calories that you burn in a 30 minute run,</p>
<p>unless the run is very intense</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wearing a weight vest and it&rsquo;s up a hill,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that great, right?</p>
<p>But you probably get somewhere</p>
<p>into the 400, 500 calories burned area.</p>
<p>But I said earlier, and there are a lot of data now</p>
<p>to support that fidgeting for a day</p>
<p>can burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories a day.</p>
<p>So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than running.</p>
<p>Ah, but it doesn&rsquo;t trigger the activation</p>
<p>and the positive health effects</p>
<p>of the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>So fidgeting alone can be great,</p>
<p>but you need exercise for other reasons.</p>
<p>Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat that you burn</p>
<p>in any duration of exercise,</p>
<p>and it can shift the percentage of fat that you oxidize</p>
<p>compared to glycogen.</p>
<p>Unless you take that caffeine and it ramps you up so much</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re training really, really intensely.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if you like caffeine</p>
<p>and you can use it safely,</p>
<p>ingesting somewhere between 100 and 400 milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine prior to exercise,</p>
<p>somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes before exercise</p>
<p>can be beneficial if we&rsquo;re talking about fat oxidation,</p>
<p>burning more body fat.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s caffeine.</p>
<p>There are a number of other things</p>
<p>that have existed over the years that are in this pathway.</p>
<p>Things like ephedrine, which is now illegal in most states.</p>
<p>I think maybe in all states</p>
<p>because people were dropping dead from taking ephedrine</p>
<p>because they were heating up too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t direct effects on the heart causing heart attack.</p>
<p>It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to know,</p>
<p>increases in body temperature and heat.</p>
<p>Now, those drugs turned out to be dangerous</p>
<p>because people were overheating and dying.</p>
<p>There was also the big fen-phen craze.</p>
<p>There was a drug that was released, fenfluramine,</p>
<p>which actually was quite effective as an anti-obesity drug,</p>
<p>a treatment for obesity.</p>
<p>That had to be outlawed as well.</p>
<p>FDA approval was removed because again,</p>
<p>people were dying because of cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people were overheating on it as well.</p>
<p>So what is the solution?</p>
<p>If caffeine is the kind of the entry point for most people</p>
<p>of using compounds to increase the rate</p>
<p>or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest,</p>
<p>what are some of the other things</p>
<p>that are useful and interesting?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of tools that are actionable</p>
<p>and have reasonable safety margins,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about something called GLP-1.</p>
<p>This is something that can be triggered</p>
<p>by the ingestion of yerba mate, which is a tea.</p>
<p>I guess because I&rsquo;m half Argentine,</p>
<p>they grew up drinking mate.</p>
<p>I think I was drinking mate</p>
<p>from the time I was about three or four years old.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest that for kids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think kids should be ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>but anyway, I did it and I still ingest mate.</p>
<p>Mate increases GLP-1.</p>
<p>GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just quickly return to our biochemistry.</p>
<p>As you recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s burned up, it&rsquo;s oxidized in cells.</p>
<p>It actually needs to be converted into ATP.</p>
<p>And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP</p>
<p>in the mitochondria of the cell.</p>
<p>High insulin prevents that from happening.</p>
<p>And glucagon facilitates that process.</p>
<p>Glucagon facilitates that process through increases in GLP-1.</p>
<p>The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1</p>
<p>and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you&rsquo;ll burn.</p>
<p>It increases fat burning.</p>
<p>And that is especially true,</p>
<p>it turns out from the scientific literature,</p>
<p>if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind.</p>
<p>So if you want to burn more fat,</p>
<p>drinking mate before exercise is good.</p>
<p>Drinking it at rest when you&rsquo;re not exercising</p>
<p>will also help shift your metabolism</p>
<p>toward enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a whole category of pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being developed right now</p>
<p>that are in late stage trials</p>
<p>or are in use for the treatment of diabetes,</p>
<p>which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.</p>
<p>They go by various names</p>
<p>and there are people on the internet</p>
<p>who are selling these things.</p>
<p>They are prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that they are prescription drugs</p>
<p>and you obviously wouldn&rsquo;t want to use any of these</p>
<p>without a prescription and a requirement.</p>
<p>It does seem that they are effective</p>
<p>for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes</p>
<p>and lead to fairly significant weight loss</p>
<p>and reduction in appetite.</p>
<p>So this is kind of the modern version of GLP-1</p>
<p>is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism</p>
<p>are drugs such as semaglutide.</p>
<p>I can never pronounce this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to pronounce many things it seems.</p>
<p>Semaglutide is the way I would pronounce it.</p>
<p>S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.</p>
<p>Semaglutide, but that&rsquo;s not the way you pronounce it,</p>
<p>but semaglutide is the way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been described on the internet.</p>
<p>In any case, this compound increases GLP-1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a GLP-1 analog in some cases,</p>
<p>and they go by various types of trade names.</p>
<p>So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.</p>
<p>Most people, including myself,</p>
<p>are not interested in taking a prescription drug</p>
<p>to increase GLP-1.</p>
<p>I do it through the ingestion of mate.</p>
<p>I just get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s kind of interesting that&rsquo;s not often discussed</p>
<p>is that you can increase the amount of GLP-1</p>
<p>by, you can essentially reuse the tea.</p>
<p>The first time you drink it, it&rsquo;s going to be very,</p>
<p>very intense, and in fact, some people find</p>
<p>that mate, it almost tastes like burnt leaves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too intense.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the water to be too hot,</p>
<p>but I learned this trick from a friend.</p>
<p>You can reuse the leaves over and over again,</p>
<p>probably for about a day before they go bad,</p>
<p>and in doing that, you start to extract more and more</p>
<p>of the compounds from the mate leaf</p>
<p>that increased GLP-1.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>You can kind of get an increased effect.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll typically do is make about 16 to 30 ounces</p>
<p>of it and just sip it throughout the day,</p>
<p>and I do like it before I train.</p>
<p>Some people who don&rsquo;t like mate might prefer</p>
<p>something like guayusa, which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.</p>
<p>G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa, which is from Ecuador,</p>
<p>despite the USA ending to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from Ecuador, and it&rsquo;s a sweeter tasting tea.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have any sweetener in it,</p>
<p>but the leaf of the guayusa plant</p>
<p>is sweeter than the mate plant.</p>
<p>I sometimes will mix the two and then make the tea with that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast.</p>
<p>These are just tools to increase GLP-1 and fat oxidation.</p>
<p>And again, the semaglutide is the prescription version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of the heavy artillery GLP-1 stimulant.</p>
<p>And again, should be only explored with a prescription.</p>
<p>So those are the compounds</p>
<p>that really increase fat oxidation directly.</p>
<p>There are going to be a number of things</p>
<p>that impact insulin and glucagon</p>
<p>that are going to shift the body toward more fat burning.</p>
<p>We talked about a lot of these</p>
<p>during the episode on hormones.</p>
<p>We talked about it,</p>
<p>we did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism.</p>
<p>And so for instance, berberine, which comes from a plant,</p>
<p>or metformin are compounds that are now</p>
<p>in kind of growing use for reducing blood glucose.</p>
<p>They are very potent at reducing blood glucose,</p>
<p>which will reduce insulin</p>
<p>because the job of the hormone insulin</p>
<p>is to essentially manage glucose in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So there are a huge gallery of compounds</p>
<p>that will reduce insulin</p>
<p>and thereby can increase fat oxidation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>fat oxidation, this conversion of fatty acids</p>
<p>into ATP and the mitochondria is inhibited by insulin.</p>
<p>So if you keep insulin low,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to increase that process.</p>
<p>Which brings us full circle</p>
<p>back to the issue of diet and nutrition.</p>
<p>There is really solid evidence</p>
<p>from the Gardner Lab at Stanford and from other labs</p>
<p>showing that when you look at different diets,</p>
<p>you look at low-fat diets, high-fat diets,</p>
<p>keto diets, intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>provided people stick to their particular diet,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter which diet you follow.</p>
<p>You can still get a caloric deficit and you get weight loss.</p>
<p>Adherence, however, is always an issue.</p>
<p>And so what I always say is</p>
<p>that you want to use the eating plan</p>
<p>that is obviously beneficial to your health,</p>
<p>but the one that allows you to adhere to whatever it is</p>
<p>that the particular nutrition protocol is, right?</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t stick with something,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not very worthwhile.</p>
<p>But from the purely scientific standpoint,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also an advantage to keeping insulin low.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>you go to zero carbohydrate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about my preferred way of eating</p>
<p>is to go low or no carbohydrate</p>
<p>throughout the day for alertness,</p>
<p>to get that adrenaline release</p>
<p>and the focus that goes with it, et cetera,</p>
<p>and the ability to think and move</p>
<p>and do all the things I need to do during the day.</p>
<p>And then I eat carbohydrates at night</p>
<p>because it facilitates the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>But when insulin is low,</p>
<p>you do place your system in a position to oxidize more fat.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think a lot of people</p>
<p>do see benefit from lower carbohydrate</p>
<p>or moderate carbohydrate diets,</p>
<p>because when insulin is low,</p>
<p>you are in a position to oxidize more fat,</p>
<p>both from exercise and at rest.</p>
<p>And I should mention, because I often mention,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s appropriate to mention,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re interested in looking at the effects</p>
<p>of caffeine, of mate, guayusa, things of that sort,</p>
<p>GLP-1, you want to learn more about those,</p>
<p>you can go to this wonderful website,</p>
<p>which is free, examine.com.</p>
<p>You can put in yerba mate.</p>
<p>It will describe the three studies</p>
<p>that show increased fat oxidation,</p>
<p>both during exercise and at rest,</p>
<p>as a consequence, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>an increase in metabolic rate.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s interesting about mate</p>
<p>is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate</p>
<p>for reasons that still escape me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a single study showing</p>
<p>that heart rate is slightly reduced,</p>
<p>which is kind of nice,</p>
<p>because when I drink too much caffeine,</p>
<p>my heart rate goes up.</p>
<p>Maybe that would increase my fidgeting and my fat burning,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t like the feeling</p>
<p>of having my basal heart rate being up too high.</p>
<p>I like my heart rate elevated during exercise,</p>
<p>but not when I&rsquo;m just kind of resting or working</p>
<p>and throughout the day.</p>
<p>And for some reason that I don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation,</p>
<p>but reducing heart rate just slightly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>and it probably lends itself to my,</p>
<p>explains the subjective experience that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>of that mate is kind of a nice, even, mellow stimulant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this, you know,</p>
<p>really supercharged stimulant like caffeine</p>
<p>from coffee or other sources.</p>
<p>Although if you drink too much mate,</p>
<p>it will also make you jittery.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one more compound</p>
<p>that I think we should discuss</p>
<p>in terms of increasing fat loss,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>They lie in the same pathway.</p>
<p>We can return to our basic knowledge now</p>
<p>of fat mobilization and oxidation.</p>
<p>After fat is mobilized and makes it into cells</p>
<p>and needs to be oxidized,</p>
<p>so literally the burning of fat</p>
<p>and conversion of it into energy,</p>
<p>that is accomplished and is facilitated</p>
<p>by the presence of glucagon being elevated,</p>
<p>GLP increases that process,</p>
<p>and insulin being low.</p>
<p>And we talked about some ways to manage insulin</p>
<p>both in this episode and in a previous episode.</p>
<p>L-carnitine and acetyl L-carnitine in particular</p>
<p>facilitates fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Helps convert fatty acids into ATP.</p>
<p>And indeed supplementing L-carnitine</p>
<p>can increase fat loss, that&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>At what dosages?</p>
<p>Well, people ingest anywhere from 500 milligrams</p>
<p>to two grams per day in divided doses typically.</p>
<p>Some people who are really extreme</p>
<p>are taking injectable L-carnitine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly not tried that.</p>
<p>I confess I have used it in pill form from time to time,</p>
<p>but in part because of the fat oxidation effects,</p>
<p>but also because of the other effects</p>
<p>that it tends to have.</p>
<p>So in exploring the effects that L-carnitine has,</p>
<p>it has a huge variety of effects on cellular metabolism.</p>
<p>It can reduce ammonia in the blood.</p>
<p>That is actually a quite strong effect.</p>
<p>It can reduce things like C-reactive protein,</p>
<p>which is you want C-reactive protein levels to be managed.</p>
<p>You do not want them too high.</p>
<p>Can slightly reduce blood glucose.</p>
<p>It can slightly increase HDLC,</p>
<p>the good form of the blood lipid,</p>
<p>and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned,</p>
<p>it can slightly modify the pathway involving glucagon</p>
<p>such that you get a considerable effect,</p>
<p>not a huge effect on fat oxidation.</p>
<p>So it can improve fat oxidation rates.</p>
<p>It has a number of other effects,</p>
<p>some of which I talked about during the month on hormones</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy</p>
<p>and sperm quality.</p>
<p>So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things</p>
<p>in lots of different cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impacting sperm motility.</p>
<p>There are a large number of studies supporting that.</p>
<p>Slight reductions in blood pressure</p>
<p>and has these interesting effects</p>
<p>on reducing fatigue during exercise,</p>
<p>reducing inflammatory markers like interleukin-6.</p>
<p>So it has a number of effects that on the whole</p>
<p>are quote-unquote positive,</p>
<p>or at least in the direction of things</p>
<p>that you may want.</p>
<p>And I should emphasize may.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t need acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>in order to lose fat.</p>
<p>But now that you understand the cellular process</p>
<p>by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,</p>
<p>it should make sense that if L-carnitine is important</p>
<p>for converting fatty acids into energy,</p>
<p>then supplementing L-carnitine makes sense.</p>
<p>Acetyl L-carnitine is the type of L-carnitine</p>
<p>or the form of L-carnitine I should say</p>
<p>that is transported and utilized most easily by the body.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why sometimes we distinguish</p>
<p>between L-carnitine and acetyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>So once again, we&rsquo;ve covered an enormous amount of material.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the science of fat loss.</p>
<p>And in particular, we&rsquo;ve explored this topic</p>
<p>from the perspective of the nervous system,</p>
<p>how neurons and in particular the release</p>
<p>of things like adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>can facilitate fat mobilization and oxidation.</p>
<p>We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,</p>
<p>this non-exercise type movement</p>
<p>that can greatly increase caloric burn and why that is.</p>
<p>We talked about shiver, another form of non-exercise movement</p>
<p>that can really increase both caloric expenditure</p>
<p>due to the shiver, due to the movement,</p>
<p>as well as increase thermogenesis,</p>
<p>the heating up of the body through things like brown fat,</p>
<p>and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat,</p>
<p>which is a good thing if you want to oxidize fat.</p>
<p>We talked about cold as a particular stimulus</p>
<p>to induce shiver and how to use getting into</p>
<p>and out of cold as a way to stimulate shiver</p>
<p>and avoid cold adaptation so that you continue</p>
<p>to oxidize and burn fat, if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the protocols for that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at thecoldplunge.com.</p>
<p>And in weeks to come, we&rsquo;re going to be adding</p>
<p>more protocols to that website, not just for fat loss,</p>
<p>but for things like resilience,</p>
<p>reducing inflammation, et cetera.</p>
<p>So be sure to check those out.</p>
<p>Again, those are totally cost-free.</p>
<p>Talked about exercise, how rather than thinking</p>
<p>about cardiovascular or weight training exercise,</p>
<p>that we should perhaps look through the lens</p>
<p>of this adrenaline system and how it interacts</p>
<p>with fat stores and think about low, medium,</p>
<p>or high-intensity exercise,</p>
<p>whether or not we show up to that fasted or not.</p>
<p>Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful</p>
<p>if you start with high-intensity movements</p>
<p>and then move into lower-intensity type exercise.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go long duration,</p>
<p>it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter unless you&rsquo;re exercising longer</p>
<p>than 90 minutes, whether or not you eat or not.</p>
<p>We talked about caffeine as a stimulant</p>
<p>and a stimulus for epinephrine and adrenaline release.</p>
<p>As a way to access more fat metabolism.</p>
<p>And we talked about compounds that come from things</p>
<p>like yerba mate and guayusa tea, this GLP-1 pathway</p>
<p>that can trigger increased fat oxidation.</p>
<p>So much so that the pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>are now developing compounds specifically</p>
<p>to increase GLP-1 for treatment of diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway</p>
<p>through the ingestion of things like mate or guayusa</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s of interest to you.</p>
<p>And then we talked about L-carnitine</p>
<p>and how L-carnitine itself is critical</p>
<p>for the fat oxidation within individual cells.</p>
<p>The conversion of fatty acids to energy</p>
<p>and why having your insulin low</p>
<p>and things like L-carnitine and glucagon levels</p>
<p>high or sufficient at least</p>
<p>to can facilitate the burning of fat, fat oxidation.</p>
<p>So we covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of protocols I realize.</p>
<p>The little list I just gave right there</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even begin to get into all the details</p>
<p>and corners that we discussed.</p>
<p>I hope you found this conversation interesting</p>
<p>both for sake of understanding fat loss</p>
<p>and how to lose fat more quickly and to lose more of it</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal, as well as simply to understand</p>
<p>the biology of fat metabolism from a different perspective,</p>
<p>from the perspective of the nervous system.</p>
