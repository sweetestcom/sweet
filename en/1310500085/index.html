    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Roger Penrose,</p>
<p>physicist, mathematician, and philosopher</p>
<p>at University of Oxford.</p>
<p>He has made fundamental contributions in many disciplines</p>
<p>from the mathematical physics of general relativity</p>
<p>and cosmology to the limitations</p>
<p>of a computational view of consciousness.</p>
<p>In his book, The Emperor&rsquo;s New Mind,</p>
<p>Roger writes that, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Children are not afraid to pose basic questions</p>
<p>that may embarrass us as adults to ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In many ways, my goal with this podcast</p>
<p>is to embrace the inner child</p>
<p>that is not constrained by how one should behave,</p>
<p>speak, and think in the adult world.</p>
<p>Roger is one of the most important minds of our time,</p>
<p>so it was truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with him.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded</p>
<p>before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the medical, psychological,</p>
<p>and financial burden of the crisis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong, we&rsquo;re in this together, we&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads.</p>
<p>Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the podcast</p>
<p>by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod</p>
<p>and downloading Cash App and using code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the app store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market</p>
<p>with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading,</p>
<p>let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that works behind the scenes</p>
<p>to create the abstraction of the fractional orders</p>
<p>is an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers</p>
<p>for solving a hard problem</p>
<p>that in the end provides an easy interface</p>
<p>that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction</p>
<p>over the stock market,</p>
<p>making trading more accessible for new investors</p>
<p>and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store</p>
<p>or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Roger Penrose.</p>
<p>You mentioned in conversation with Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>on the Portal podcast that 2001 Space Odyssey</p>
<p>is your favorite movie.</p>
<p>Which aspect, if you could mention,</p>
<p>of its representation of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>science, engineering connected with you?</p>
<p>There are all sorts of scenes there which are so amazing.</p>
<p>And how science was so well done.</p>
<p>I mean, people say, oh no, Interstellar is this amazing movie</p>
<p>which is the most scientific movie.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;s not a patch on 2001.</p>
<p>I mean, 2001, they really went into all sorts of details.</p>
<p>And regarding getting the free fall well done and everything,</p>
<p>I thought it was extremely well done.</p>
<p>So just the details were mesmerizing in terms of this.</p>
<p>And also things like the scene where at the beginning</p>
<p>they have these sort of human ancestors</p>
<p>which are sort of apes becoming humans.</p>
<p>The monolith.</p>
<p>Yes, and well, it&rsquo;s the one where he throws the bone</p>
<p>up into the air and then it becomes this.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an amazing sequence there.</p>
<p>What do you make of the monolith?</p>
<p>Does it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you,</p>
<p>this kind of thing that sparks innovation?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>That comes from Arthur C. Clarke.</p>
<p>I was always a great fan of Arthur C. Clarke.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a nice plot device.</p>
<p>Yeah, that plot is excellent, yes.</p>
<p>So Hal 9000 decides to get rid of the astronauts</p>
<p>because he, it, she believes that they will interfere</p>
<p>with the mission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this view.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether I disagree with it</p>
<p>because in a certain sense it was telling you it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>See, the machine seemed to think it was superior</p>
<p>to the human and so it was entitled to get rid</p>
<p>of the human beings and run the show itself.</p>
<p>Well, do you think Hal did the right thing?</p>
<p>Do you think Hal&rsquo;s flawed evil?</p>
<p>Or if we think about systems like Hal,</p>
<p>would we want Hal to do the same thing in the future?</p>
<p>What was the flaw there?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re basically touching on questions.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s one supposed to believe</p>
<p>that Hal was actually conscious.</p>
<p>I mean, it was played rather that way,</p>
<p>as though Hal was a conscious being.</p>
<p>Because Hal showed some pain, some cognizance,</p>
<p>Hal appeared to be cognizant of what it means to die.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And therefore had an inkling of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure that aspect</p>
<p>of it was made completely clear,</p>
<p>whether Hal was really just a very sophisticated computer,</p>
<p>which really didn&rsquo;t actually have these feelings</p>
<p>and somehow, but you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t like the idea of being turned off.</p>
<p>How does it change things if Hal was or wasn&rsquo;t conscious?</p>
<p>Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off</p>
<p>if it was actually conscious.</p>
<p>I mean, these questions arise if you think.</p>
<p>I mean, AI, one of the ideas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a mixture in a sense.</p>
<p>You say, if it&rsquo;s trying to do everything a human can do,</p>
<p>and if you take the view that consciousness</p>
<p>is something which would come along</p>
<p>when the computer is sufficiently complicated,</p>
<p>sufficiently whatever criterion you use</p>
<p>to characterize its consciousness</p>
<p>in terms of some computational criteria,</p>
<p>computational criterion.</p>
<p>So how does consciousness change our evaluation</p>
<p>of the decision that Hal made?</p>
<p>I guess I was trying to say</p>
<p>that people are a bit confused about this,</p>
<p>because if they say these machines will become conscious,</p>
<p>but just simply because it&rsquo;s a degree of computation,</p>
<p>and when you get beyond that certain degree of computation,</p>
<p>it will become conscious,</p>
<p>then of course you have all these problems.</p>
<p>I mean, you might say, well,</p>
<p>one of the reasons you&rsquo;re doing AI</p>
<p>is because you want to send a device</p>
<p>out to some distant planet,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to send a human out there,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;d have to bring it back again,</p>
<p>and that costs you far more</p>
<p>than just sending it there and leaving it there.</p>
<p>But if this device is actually a conscious entity,</p>
<p>then you have to face up to the fact that that&rsquo;s immoral.</p>
<p>And so the mere fact that you&rsquo;re making some AI device</p>
<p>and thinking that removes your responsibility to it</p>
<p>would be incorrect.</p>
<p>And so this is a sign of flaw in that kind of viewpoint.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how people who take it very seriously,</p>
<p>I mean, I had this curious conversation</p>
<p>with, I&rsquo;m going to forget names, I&rsquo;m afraid,</p>
<p>because this is what happens to me at the wrong moment,</p>
<p>Hofstadter, Douglas Hofstadter.</p>
<p>Douglas Hofstadter, yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d written this book,</p>
<p>God Will Let You Up, which I liked.</p>
<p>I thought it was a fantastic book.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t agree with his conclusion</p>
<p>from G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem.</p>
<p>I think he got it wrong, you see.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just tell you my story, you see,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d never met him.</p>
<p>And then I knew I was going to meet him,</p>
<p>the occasion I realized he was coming in,</p>
<p>he wanted to talk to me, and I said, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And I thought in my mind,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to paint him into a corner, you see,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll use his arguments to convince him</p>
<p>that certain numbers are conscious.</p>
<p>Some integers, large enough integers are actually conscious.</p>
<p>And this was going to be my reductio ad absurdum.</p>
<p>So I started having this argument with him.</p>
<p>He simply leapt into the corner.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even need to be painted into it.</p>
<p>He took the view that certain numbers were conscious.</p>
<p>I thought that was a reductio ad absurdum,</p>
<p>but he seemed to think it was perfectly</p>
<p>a reasonable point of view.</p>
<p>Without the absurdum there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Interesting, but the thing you mentioned about how</p>
<p>is the intuition that a lot of the people,</p>
<p>at least in the artificial intelligence world,</p>
<p>had and have, I think.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make it explicit,</p>
<p>but that if you increase the power of computation,</p>
<p>naturally consciousness will emerge.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s what they think.</p>
<p>But basically that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t think of anything else.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a reasonable thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you think, what does the brain do?</p>
<p>Well, it does do a lot of computation.</p>
<p>I think most of what you actually call computation</p>
<p>is done by the cerebellum.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the things</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t much mention.</p>
<p>I mean, I come to this subject from the outside</p>
<p>and certain things strike me,</p>
<p>which you hardly ever hear mentioned.</p>
<p>I mean, you hear mentioned about the left right business.</p>
<p>They move your right arm,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the left side of the brain</p>
<p>and so on and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>If you have these plots of different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>there are two of these things called the homunculi,</p>
<p>which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure</p>
<p>and showing different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>controlling different parts of the body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not simply things like,</p>
<p>okay, the right hand is controlled</p>
<p>and both sensory and motor on the left side,</p>
<p>left hand on the right side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Vision is the back basically,</p>
<p>your feet at the top.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as though it&rsquo;s about the worst organization</p>
<p>you could imagine.</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t just be a mistake in nature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something going on there.</p>
<p>And this is made more pronounced</p>
<p>when you think of the cerebellum.</p>
<p>The cerebellum has,</p>
<p>when I was first thinking about these things,</p>
<p>I was told that it had half as many neurons</p>
<p>or something like that, comparable.</p>
<p>And now they tell me it&rsquo;s got far more neurons</p>
<p>than the cerebrum, and cerebrum is this sort of</p>
<p>convoluted thing at the top people always talk about.</p>
<p>Cerebellum is this thing just looks a bit like</p>
<p>a ball of wool right at the back underneath them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got more neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got more connections.</p>
<p>Computationally, it&rsquo;s got much more going on</p>
<p>than this from the cerebrum.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, that&rsquo;s slightly controversial,</p>
<p>the cerebellum is entirely unconscious.</p>
<p>So the actions, you have a pianist</p>
<p>who plays an incredible piece of music</p>
<p>and think of, and he moves his little finger</p>
<p>into this little key to get it, hit it,</p>
<p>just the right moment.</p>
<p>Does he or she consciously will that movement?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, the consciousness is coming in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably to do with the feeling</p>
<p>of the piece of music that&rsquo;s being performed</p>
<p>and that sort of thing, which is going on.</p>
<p>But the details of what&rsquo;s going on are controlled.</p>
<p>I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you have this precision</p>
<p>and the really detailed.</p>
<p>Once you get, I mean, you think of a tennis player</p>
<p>or something, does that tennis player</p>
<p>think exactly which muscles should be moved</p>
<p>in what direction and so on?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>But he or she will maybe think,</p>
<p>well, if the ball is angled in such a way in that corner,</p>
<p>that will be tricky for the opponent.</p>
<p>And the details of that are all done</p>
<p>largely with the cerebellum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the precise motions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unconscious.</p>
<p>So why is it interesting to you</p>
<p>that so much computation is done in the cerebellum</p>
<p>and yet it is unconscious?</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the view</p>
<p>that somehow it&rsquo;s computation</p>
<p>which is producing the consciousness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here you have an incredible amount</p>
<p>of computation going on.</p>
<p>And as far as we know, it&rsquo;s completely unconscious.</p>
<p>So why, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s an important thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Why is the cerebrum, all this very peculiar stuff</p>
<p>that very hard to see on a computational perspective,</p>
<p>like having the, everything have to cross over</p>
<p>under the other side and do something</p>
<p>which looks completely inefficient.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got funny things like the frontal lobe</p>
<p>and the, what do we call the lobes?</p>
<p>And the place where they come together,</p>
<p>you have the different parts, the control,</p>
<p>you see one to do with motor</p>
<p>and the other to do with sensory.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re sort of opposite each other</p>
<p>rather than being connected by,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as though you&rsquo;ve got electrical circuits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else going on there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the idea that it&rsquo;s like a complicated computer</p>
<p>just seems to me to be completely missing the point.</p>
<p>There must be a lot of computation going on,</p>
<p>but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that</p>
<p>than the cerebrum is.</p>
<p>So for sure, I think what explains it is like half hope</p>
<p>and half we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And therefore from the computer science perspective,</p>
<p>you hope that a Turing machine can be perfectly,</p>
<p>can achieve general intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, you have this wonderful thing about Turing</p>
<p>and G√∂del and Church and Curry and various people,</p>
<p>particularly Turing, and I guess Post was the other one.</p>
<p>These people who developed the idea</p>
<p>of what a computation is.</p>
<p>And there were different ideas of what a computation,</p>
<p>developed differently.</p>
<p>I mean, Church&rsquo;s way of doing it,</p>
<p>was very different from Turing&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but then they were shown to be equivalent.</p>
<p>And so the view emerged that what we mean by computation</p>
<p>is a very clear concept.</p>
<p>And one of the wonderful things that Turing did</p>
<p>was to show that you could have</p>
<p>what we call the universal Turing machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you just have to have a certain finite device.</p>
<p>Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space,</p>
<p>which is accessible to it,</p>
<p>but the actual computation, if you like,</p>
<p>is performed by this one universal device.</p>
<p>And so the view comes away,</p>
<p>well, you have this universal Turing machine,</p>
<p>and maybe the brain is something like that,</p>
<p>a universal Turing machine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got maybe not unlimited storage,</p>
<p>but a huge storage accessible to it.</p>
<p>And this model is one,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s used in ordinary computation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very powerful model.</p>
<p>And the universallness of computation is very useful.</p>
<p>You could have some problem</p>
<p>and you may not see immediately</p>
<p>how to put it onto a computer,</p>
<p>but if it is something of that nature,</p>
<p>then there are all sorts of subprograms</p>
<p>and subroutines when all the,</p>
<p>I mean, I learned a little bit of computing</p>
<p>when I was a student, but not very much.</p>
<p>But it was enough to get the general ideas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something really pleasant</p>
<p>about a formal system like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where you can start discussing about what&rsquo;s provable,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s not, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got a notion, which is an absolute notion,</p>
<p>this notion of computability,</p>
<p>and you can address when things are,</p>
<p>mathematical problems are computably solvable</p>
<p>and what chance.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very beautiful area of mathematics,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very powerful area of mathematics.</p>
<p>And it underlies the whole sort of,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say, the principles of computing machines</p>
<p>that we have today.</p>
<p>Could you say, what is Gayle&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorem?</p>
<p>And how does it, maybe also say,</p>
<p>is it heartbreaking to you?</p>
<p>And how does it interfere with this notion of computation</p>
<p>and consciousness?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, the ideas, basically ideas,</p>
<p>which I formulated in my first year</p>
<p>as a graduate student in Cambridge.</p>
<p>I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London,</p>
<p>and I had a colleague, Ian Percival.</p>
<p>We used to discuss things like computational</p>
<p>and logical systems quite a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d heard about Gayle&rsquo;s theorem.</p>
<p>I was a bit worried by the idea that it seemed to say</p>
<p>there were things in mathematics that you could never prove.</p>
<p>And so when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student,</p>
<p>I went to various courses.</p>
<p>You see, I was doing pure mathematics.</p>
<p>I was doing algebraic geometry of a sort.</p>
<p>A little bit different from what my supervisor and people,</p>
<p>but it was algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was interested,</p>
<p>I got particularly interested in three lecture courses</p>
<p>that were nothing to do with what I was supposed</p>
<p>to be doing.</p>
<p>One was a course by Herman Bondy</p>
<p>on Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity,</p>
<p>which was a beautiful course.</p>
<p>He was an amazing lecturer,</p>
<p>brought these things alive, absolutely.</p>
<p>Another was a course on quantum mechanics</p>
<p>given by a great physicist, Paul Dirac.</p>
<p>Very beautiful course in a completely different way.</p>
<p>It was, he was very kind of organized</p>
<p>and never got excited about anything seemingly.</p>
<p>But it was extremely well put together.</p>
<p>And I found that amazing too.</p>
<p>Third course that was nothing to do</p>
<p>with what I should be doing was a course</p>
<p>on mathematical logic.</p>
<p>I got excited, as I say, my discussions with Ian Percival</p>
<p>was incompleteness theorem already deeply</p>
<p>within mathematical logic space.</p>
<p>Were you introduced to it?</p>
<p>I was introduced to it in detail by the course, by Steen.</p>
<p>And he, it was two things he described</p>
<p>which were very fundamental to my understanding.</p>
<p>One was Turing machines and the whole idea</p>
<p>of computability and all that.</p>
<p>So that was all very much part of the course.</p>
<p>The other one was the G√∂del theorem.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t what I was afraid it was</p>
<p>to tell you there were things in mathematics</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t prove.</p>
<p>It was basically, and he phrased it in a way</p>
<p>which often people didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if you read Douglas Soft status book,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t, you see.</p>
<p>But Steen made it very clear.</p>
<p>And also in a sort of public lecture</p>
<p>that he gave to a mathematical,</p>
<p>I think it may be the Adams Society,</p>
<p>one of the mathematical undergraduate societies.</p>
<p>And he made this point again very clearly.</p>
<p>That if you&rsquo;ve got a formal system of proof,</p>
<p>so suppose what you mean by proof</p>
<p>is something which you could check with a computer.</p>
<p>So to say whether you&rsquo;ve got it right or not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a lot of steps.</p>
<p>Have you carried this computational procedure?</p>
<p>Well, following the proof, steps of the proof correctly,</p>
<p>that can be checked by an algorithm, by a computer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>Now what you have to, now you see, is this any good?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got an algorithmic system,</p>
<p>which claims to say, yes, this is right,</p>
<p>this you&rsquo;ve proved it correctly, this is true.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve proved it, if you made a mistake,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s true or false.</p>
<p>But if you have, if you&rsquo;ve done it right,</p>
<p>then the conclusion you&rsquo;ve come to is correct.</p>
<p>Now you say, why do you believe it&rsquo;s correct?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve looked at the rules and you said,</p>
<p>well, okay, that one&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that one&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>What about that?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I see, I see why it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>Okay, you go through all the rules.</p>
<p>You say, yes, following those rules,</p>
<p>if it says, yes, it&rsquo;s true, it is true.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to make sure that these rules</p>
<p>are ones that you trust.</p>
<p>If you follow the rules and it says it&rsquo;s a proof,</p>
<p>is the result actually true?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that your belief that it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>depends upon looking at the rules and understanding them.</p>
<p>Now, what G√∂del shows, that if you have such a system,</p>
<p>then you can construct a statement of the very kind</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s supposed to look at, a mathematical statement,</p>
<p>and you can see by the way it&rsquo;s constructed</p>
<p>and what it means that it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but not provable by the rules that you&rsquo;ve been given.</p>
<p>And it depends on your trust in the rules.</p>
<p>Do you believe that the rules only give you truths?</p>
<p>If you believe the rules only give you truths,</p>
<p>then you believe this other statement is also true.</p>
<p>I found this absolutely mind blowing.</p>
<p>When I saw this, it blew my mind.</p>
<p>I thought, my God, you can see that this statement is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as good as any proof,</p>
<p>because it only depends on your belief</p>
<p>in the reliability of the proof procedure, that&rsquo;s all it is,</p>
<p>and understanding that the coding is done correctly.</p>
<p>And it enables you to transcend that system.</p>
<p>So whatever system you have,</p>
<p>as long as you can understand what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and why you believe it only gives you truths,</p>
<p>then you can see beyond that system.</p>
<p>Now, how do you see beyond it?</p>
<p>What is it that enables you to transcend that system?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s your understanding</p>
<p>of what the system is actually saying</p>
<p>and what the statement that you&rsquo;ve constructed</p>
<p>is actually saying.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this quality of understanding, whatever it is,</p>
<p>which is not governed by rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a computational procedure.</p>
<p>So this idea of understanding is not going to be</p>
<p>within the rules of the, within the formal system.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re only using those rules anyway,</p>
<p>because you have understood them to be rules</p>
<p>which only give you truths.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be no point in it otherwise.</p>
<p>I mean, people say, well, okay, this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one set of rules as good as any other.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You see, you have to understand what the rules mean.</p>
<p>And why does that understanding of the mean</p>
<p>give you something beyond the rules themselves?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what blew my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow understanding why the rules give you truths</p>
<p>enables you to transcend the rules.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where, I mean, even at that time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already where the thought entered your mind</p>
<p>that the idea of understanding, or we can start calling it</p>
<p>things like intelligence or even consciousness</p>
<p>is outside the rules.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;ve always concentrated on understanding.</p>
<p>You know, people say, people come and point out things.</p>
<p>Well, you know, what about creativity?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something a machine can&rsquo;t do is create.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What is creativity?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, somebody can put some funny things</p>
<p>on a piece of paper and say that&rsquo;s creative</p>
<p>and you could make a machine do that.</p>
<p>Is it really creative?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You see, I worry about that one.</p>
<p>I sort of agree with it in a sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so hard to do anything with that statement.</p>
<p>But understanding, yes, you can.</p>
<p>You can make, go see that understanding, whatever it is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard to put your finger on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>Can you try to define or maybe dance around</p>
<p>a definition of understanding?</p>
<p>To some degree, but I don&rsquo;t, I often wondered about this,</p>
<p>but there is something there which is very slippery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like standing back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got to be something, you see,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also got to be something which was of value</p>
<p>to our remote ancestors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because sometimes, there&rsquo;s a cartoon</p>
<p>which I drew sometimes showing you how all these,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s in the foreground, you see this mathematician</p>
<p>just doing some mathematical theorem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of a joke in that theorem,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not go into that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to prove some theorem.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s about to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s hiding in the undergrowth, you see.</p>
<p>And in the distance, you see his cousins</p>
<p>building, growing crops, building shelters,</p>
<p>domesticating animals, and in the slight foreground,</p>
<p>you see they&rsquo;ve built a mammoth trap</p>
<p>and this poor old mammoth is falling into a pit, you see,</p>
<p>and all these people around them are about to grab him,</p>
<p>you see, and well, you see, those are the ones who,</p>
<p>the quality of understanding, which goes with all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the mathematician doing his mathematics,</p>
<p>this understanding quality is something else,</p>
<p>which has been a tremendous advantage to us,</p>
<p>not just to us.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t think consciousness is limited to humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the interesting question,</p>
<p>at which point, if it is indeed connected</p>
<p>to the evolutionary process,</p>
<p>at which point did we pick up this?</p>
<p>A very hard question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s primates,</p>
<p>you know, you see these pictures of African hunting dogs</p>
<p>and how they can plan amongst themselves</p>
<p>how to catch the antelopes.</p>
<p>Some of these David Attenborough films,</p>
<p>I think this probably was one of them,</p>
<p>and you could see the hunting dogs,</p>
<p>and they divide themselves into two groups</p>
<p>and they go in two routes, two different routes.</p>
<p>One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river.</p>
<p>And the other group goes around</p>
<p>and they start yelping at these, they don&rsquo;t bark,</p>
<p>I guess whatever noise hunting dogs do,</p>
<p>the antelopes, and they sort of round them up</p>
<p>and they chase them in the direction of the river.</p>
<p>And there are the other ones just waiting for them,</p>
<p>just to get, because when they get to the river,</p>
<p>it slows them down.</p>
<p>And so they pounce on them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve obviously planned this all out somehow.</p>
<p>I have no idea how.</p>
<p>And there is some element of conscious planning,</p>
<p>as far as I can see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just some kind of,</p>
<p>so much of AI these days is done on what they call</p>
<p>bottom up systems, is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, where you have neural networks</p>
<p>and you give them a zillion different things to look at</p>
<p>and then they sort of can choose one thing over another,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s seen so many examples</p>
<p>and picks up on little signals,</p>
<p>which one may not even be conscious of.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t feel like understanding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no understanding in that whatsoever.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re being a little bit human centric, so.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m talking about, I&rsquo;m not with the dogs, am I?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Sorry, not human centric, but I misspoke.</p>
<p>Biology centric.</p>
<p>Is it possible that consciousness</p>
<p>would just look slightly different?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s biological,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think other examples of elephants</p>
<p>is a wonderful example, too.</p>
<p>Where they, this was, I think this was an Attenborough one,</p>
<p>where the elephants have to go from along,</p>
<p>the troop of them have to go long distances.</p>
<p>And the leader of a troop is a female.</p>
<p>They all are, apparently.</p>
<p>And this female, she had to go all the way</p>
<p>from one part of the country to another.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, she made a detour.</p>
<p>And they went off in this big detour.</p>
<p>All the troop came with her.</p>
<p>And this was where her sister had died.</p>
<p>And there were her bones lying around.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to pick up the bones,</p>
<p>and they hand it around, and they caress the bones.</p>
<p>And then they put them back, and they go back again.</p>
<p>What in the hell are they doing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clear connection with natural selection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just some deep feeling going on there,</p>
<p>which has to do with their conscious experience.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s something that, overall,</p>
<p>is advantageous, our natural selection,</p>
<p>but not directly to do with natural selection.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something going on there.</p>
<p>Like I told you, I&rsquo;m Russian,</p>
<p>so I tend to romanticize all things of this nature,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not merely cold, hard computation.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could just slightly answer your question.</p>
<p>You were asking me, what is it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about sort of standing back</p>
<p>and thinking about your own thought processes.</p>
<p>I mean, there is something like that in the G√∂del thing,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not following the rules.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re standing back and thinking about the rules.</p>
<p>And so there is something that you might say,</p>
<p>you think about you&rsquo;re doing something,</p>
<p>and you think, what the hell am I doing?</p>
<p>And you sort of stand back and think about</p>
<p>what it is that&rsquo;s making you think in such a way.</p>
<p>Just take a step back outside the game you&rsquo;ve been playing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you back up and you think about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just not playing the game anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about what the hell you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in playing this game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somehow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a very precise description,</p>
<p>but somehow it feels very true</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s somehow understanding.</p>
<p>This kind of reflection.</p>
<p>The reflection, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a bit hard to put your finger on,</p>
<p>but there is something there,</p>
<p>which I think maybe could be unearthed at some point</p>
<p>and see this is really what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>why conscious beings have this advantage,</p>
<p>what it is that gives them advantage.</p>
<p>And I think it goes way back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re talking about the hunting dogs</p>
<p>and the elephants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that octopuses have</p>
<p>the same sort of quality,</p>
<p>and we call it consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Seen enough examples of the way that they behave</p>
<p>and the evolution route is completely different.</p>
<p>Does it go way back to some common ancestor</p>
<p>or did it come separately?</p>
<p>My hope is it&rsquo;s something simple,</p>
<p>but the hard question if there&rsquo;s a hardware prerequisite.</p>
<p>We have to develop some kind of hardware mechanisms</p>
<p>in our computers.</p>
<p>Like basically, as you suggest,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get to in a second,</p>
<p>we kind of have to throw away the computer</p>
<p>as we know it today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The deterministic machines we know today</p>
<p>to try to create it.</p>
<p>I mean, my hope, of course, is not, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I should go really back to the story</p>
<p>which, in a sense, I haven&rsquo;t finished</p>
<p>because I went to these three courses, you see,</p>
<p>when I was a graduate student.</p>
<p>And so I started to think, well, I&rsquo;m really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty, what you might call a materialist</p>
<p>in the sense of thinking that there&rsquo;s no kind of mystical</p>
<p>something or other which comes in from who knows where.</p>
<p>You still that?</p>
<p>Are you still, throughout your life, been a materialist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the word materialist</p>
<p>because it suggests we know what material is.</p>
<p>And that is a bad word because&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no mystical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some mystical something</p>
<p>which is not treatable by science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so beautifully put,</p>
<p>just to pause on that for a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a materialist, but you acknowledge</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really know what the material is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, I like to call myself a scientist, I suppose,</p>
<p>but it means that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, well, you see, the question goes on here.</p>
<p>So I began thinking, okay, if consciousness</p>
<p>or understanding is something</p>
<p>which is not a computational process, what can it be?</p>
<p>And I knew enough from my undergraduate work.</p>
<p>I knew about Newtonian mechanics,</p>
<p>and I knew how basically you could put it on a computer.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental issue, which is it important or not?</p>
<p>That computation depends upon discrete things.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using discrete elements,</p>
<p>whereas the physical laws depend on the continuum.</p>
<p>Now, is this something to do with it?</p>
<p>Is it the fact that we use the continuum in our physics?</p>
<p>And if we model our physical system,</p>
<p>we use discrete systems like ordinary computers?</p>
<p>I came to the view that that&rsquo;s probably not it.</p>
<p>I might have to retract on that someday,</p>
<p>but the view was no, you can get close enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not altogether clear, I have to say,</p>
<p>but you can get close enough.</p>
<p>And I went to this course by Bondi on general relativity,</p>
<p>and I thought, well, you can put that on a computer,</p>
<p>because that was a long time before people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve sort of grown up with this,</p>
<p>how people have done better and better calculations,</p>
<p>and they could work out about black holes,</p>
<p>and they can then work out how black holes</p>
<p>can interact with each other, spiral around,</p>
<p>and what kind of gravitational waves can out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very impressive piece of computational work,</p>
<p>how you can actually work out the shapes of those signals.</p>
<p>And now we have LIGO seeing these signals,</p>
<p>and they say, yeah, those black holes spiral into each other.</p>
<p>This is just a vindication of the power of computation</p>
<p>in describing Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity.</p>
<p>So in that case, we can get close,</p>
<p>but with computation, we can get close</p>
<p>to our understanding of the physics.</p>
<p>You can get very, very close.</p>
<p>Now, is that close enough, you see?</p>
<p>And then I went to this course by Dirac.</p>
<p>Now, you see, I think it was the very first lecture</p>
<p>that he gave, and he was talking about</p>
<p>a superposition principle.</p>
<p>And he said, if you have a particle,</p>
<p>you usually think of particle can be over here</p>
<p>or over there, but in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>it can be over here and over there at the same time.</p>
<p>And you have these states which involve</p>
<p>a superposition in some sense</p>
<p>of different locations for that particle.</p>
<p>And then he got out his piece of chalk.</p>
<p>Some people say he broke it in two</p>
<p>as a kind of illustration of how the piece of chalk</p>
<p>might be over here and over there at the same time.</p>
<p>And he was talking about this, and my mind wandered.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what he said.</p>
<p>All I can remember, he&rsquo;s just moved on to the next topic,</p>
<p>and something about energy he&rsquo;d mentioned,</p>
<p>which I had no idea what it had to do with anything.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d been struck with this</p>
<p>and worried about it ever since.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just as well I didn&rsquo;t hear his explanation</p>
<p>because it was probably one of these things</p>
<p>to calm me down and not worry about it anymore.</p>
<p>Whereas in my case, I&rsquo;ve worried about it ever since.</p>
<p>So I thought maybe that&rsquo;s the catch.</p>
<p>There is something in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>where the superpositions become one or the other,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not part of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something missing in the theory.</p>
<p>The theory is incomplete.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just incomplete.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a certain sense not quite right</p>
<p>because if you follow the equation,</p>
<p>the basic equation of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Schrodinger equation,</p>
<p>you could put that on a computer too.</p>
<p>There are lots of difficulties</p>
<p>about how many parameters you have to put in and so on.</p>
<p>That can be very tricky,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, it is a computational process.</p>
<p>Modulo this question about the continuum as before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not clear that makes any difference.</p>
<p>So our theories of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>may be missing the same element</p>
<p>that the universal Turing machine</p>
<p>is missing about consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the view I held is that you need a theory</p>
<p>and that what people call the reduction of the state</p>
<p>or the collapse of the wave function,</p>
<p>which you have to have,</p>
<p>otherwise quantum mechanics doesn&rsquo;t relate</p>
<p>to the world we see.</p>
<p>To make it relate to the world we see,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to break the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>Schrodinger himself was absolutely appalled by this idea,</p>
<p>his own equation.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why he introduced</p>
<p>this famous Schrodinger&rsquo;s cat as a thought experiment.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really saying, look,</p>
<p>this is where my equation leads you into it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong,</p>
<p>something we haven&rsquo;t understood,</p>
<p>which is basically fundamental.</p>
<p>And so I was trying to put all these things together</p>
<p>and said, well, it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>the noncomputability comes in there.</p>
<p>And I also can&rsquo;t quite remember when I thought this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s when gravity is involved in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the combination of those two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that point</p>
<p>when you have good reasons to believe,</p>
<p>this came much later,</p>
<p>that I have good reason to believe</p>
<p>that the principles of general relativity</p>
<p>and those of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>most particularly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the basic principle of equivalence,</p>
<p>which goes back to Galileo.</p>
<p>If you fall freely,</p>
<p>you eliminate the gravitational field.</p>
<p>So you imagine Galileo</p>
<p>dropping his big rock and his little rock</p>
<p>from the leaning tower,</p>
<p>whether he actually ever did that or not,</p>
<p>pretty irrelevant.</p>
<p>And as the rocks fall to the ground,</p>
<p>you have a little insect sitting on one of them,</p>
<p>looking at the other one.</p>
<p>And it seems to think, oh, there&rsquo;s no gravity here.</p>
<p>Of course, it hits the ground</p>
<p>and then you realize something&rsquo;s difference going on.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s in free fall,</p>
<p>the gravity has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Galileo understood that very beautifully.</p>
<p>He gives these wonderful examples of fireworks.</p>
<p>And you see the fireworks and explode,</p>
<p>and you see this fear of sparkling fireworks.</p>
<p>It remains as fear as it falls down,</p>
<p>as though there were no gravity.</p>
<p>So he understood that principle,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t make a theory out of it.</p>
<p>Einstein came along,</p>
<p>used exactly the same principle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the basis</p>
<p>of Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>Now, there is a conflict.</p>
<p>This is something I did much, much later.</p>
<p>So this wasn&rsquo;t at those days,</p>
<p>much, much later.</p>
<p>You can see there is a basic conflict</p>
<p>between the principle of superposition,</p>
<p>the thing that Dirac was talking about,</p>
<p>and the principle of general covariance.</p>
<p>Well, principle of equivalence.</p>
<p>Gravitational field&rsquo;s equivalent to an acceleration.</p>
<p>Can you pause for a second?</p>
<p>What is the principle of equivalence?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this Galileo principle</p>
<p>that we can eliminate, at least locally.</p>
<p>You have to be in a small neighborhood</p>
<p>because if you have people dropping rocks</p>
<p>all around the world somewhere,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of it all at once.</p>
<p>But in the local neighborhood,</p>
<p>you can eliminate the gravitational field</p>
<p>by falling freely with it.</p>
<p>And we now see this with astronauts,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t, you know, the Earth is right there.</p>
<p>You can see the great globe of the Earth</p>
<p>right beneath them.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>As far as they&rsquo;re concerned, there&rsquo;s no gravity.</p>
<p>They fall freely within the gravitational field,</p>
<p>and that gets rid of the gravitational field.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the principle of equivalence.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the contradiction?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the tension with superposition</p>
<p>and equivalence?</p>
<p>Oh, well, that&rsquo;s technical.</p>
<p>So just to backtrack for a second</p>
<p>just to see if we can weave a thread through it all.</p>
<p>So we started to think about consciousness</p>
<p>as potentially needing some of the same,</p>
<p>not mystical, but some of the same magic.</p>
<p>You see, it is a complicated story.</p>
<p>So, you know, people think,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m drifting away from the point or something.</p>
<p>But I think it is a complicated story.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say,</p>
<p>I mean, I try to put it in a nutshell,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say that whatever consciousness is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a computation.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s not a physical process</p>
<p>which can be described by computation.</p>
<p>But it nevertheless could be,</p>
<p>so one of the interesting models</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve proposed</p>
<p>is the orchestrated objective reduction.</p>
<p>Yes, well, you see, that&rsquo;s going from there, you see.</p>
<p>So I say I have no idea.</p>
<p>So I wrote this book through my scientific career.</p>
<p>I thought, you know, when I&rsquo;m retired,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have enough time to write a sort of a popularish book</p>
<p>which I will explain my ideas and puzzles,</p>
<p>what I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics,</p>
<p>and this puzzle about computability</p>
<p>and consciousness and so on.</p>
<p>And in the process of writing this book,</p>
<p>well, I thought I&rsquo;d do it when I was retired.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually, I didn&rsquo;t wait that long</p>
<p>because there was a radio discussion</p>
<p>between Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky.</p>
<p>And they were talking about what computers could do.</p>
<p>And they were entering a big room.</p>
<p>They imagined entering this big room</p>
<p>where at the other end of the room,</p>
<p>two computers were talking to each other.</p>
<p>And as you walk up to the computers,</p>
<p>they will have communicated to each other</p>
<p>more ideas, concepts, things than the entire human race</p>
<p>had ever done.</p>
<p>So I thought, well, I know where you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something missing.</p>
<p>So I thought, well, I should write my book.</p>
<p>And so I did.</p>
<p>It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>was writing his brief history of time.</p>
<p>In the 80s at some point.</p>
<p>The book you&rsquo;re talking about is The Emperor&rsquo;s New Mind.</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Mind, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And both are incredible books,</p>
<p>The Brief History of Time and The Emperor&rsquo;s New Mind.</p>
<p>Yes, it was quite interesting</p>
<p>because he told me he&rsquo;d got Carl Sagan, I think,</p>
<p>to write a foreword for the book, you see.</p>
<p>So I thought, gosh, what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna get anywhere unless I get somebody.</p>
<p>So I said, oh, I know Martin Gardner,</p>
<p>so I wonder if he&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p>So he did, and he did a very nice foreword.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an incredible book,</p>
<p>and some of the same people you mentioned,</p>
<p>Ed Franken, which I guess of expert systems fame,</p>
<p>and Minsky, of course, people know in the AI world,</p>
<p>but they represent the artificial intelligence world</p>
<p>that do hope and dream that AI&rsquo;s intelligence is.</p>
<p>Well, you see, it was my thinking,</p>
<p>well, you know, I see where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>From that perspective, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not my perspective.</p>
<p>So I thought I had to say it.</p>
<p>And as I was writing my book, you see,</p>
<p>I thought, well, I don&rsquo;t really know anything</p>
<p>about neurophysiology.</p>
<p>What am I doing writing this book?</p>
<p>So I started reading up about neurophysiology,</p>
<p>and I read up, and I think,</p>
<p>now, I&rsquo;m trying to find out how it is</p>
<p>that nerve signals could possibly</p>
<p>preserve quantum coherence.</p>
<p>And all I read is that the electrical signals</p>
<p>which go along the nerves create effects through the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no chance you can isolate it.</p>
<p>So I thought, this is hopeless.</p>
<p>So I come to the end of the book,</p>
<p>and I more or less give up.</p>
<p>I just think of something which I didn&rsquo;t believe in.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a way around it, but no.</p>
<p>And then, you see, I thought, well,</p>
<p>maybe this book will at least stimulate young people</p>
<p>to do science or something.</p>
<p>And I got all these letters from old, retired people instead.</p>
<p>These are the only people who had time to read my book.</p>
<p>So, I mean, but.</p>
<p>Except for Stuart Hameroff.</p>
<p>Stuart Hameroff wrote to me, and he said,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing something.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know about microtubules, do you?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t put it quite like that.</p>
<p>But that was more or less it.</p>
<p>And he said, this is what you really need to consider.</p>
<p>So I thought, my God, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much more promising structure.</p>
<p>So, I mean, fundamentally, you were searching</p>
<p>for the source of, noncomputable source of consciousness</p>
<p>within the human brain, in the biology.</p>
<p>And so, what are, if I may ask, what are microtubules?</p>
<p>Well, you see, I was ignorant in what I&rsquo;d read.</p>
<p>I never came across them in the books I looked at.</p>
<p>Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know about microtubules.</p>
<p>Stuart, I think one of the things</p>
<p>that impressed him about them was,</p>
<p>when you see pictures of mitosis, that&rsquo;s a cell dividing,</p>
<p>and you see all the chromosomes.</p>
<p>And the chromosomes, they all get lined up,</p>
<p>and then they get pulled apart.</p>
<p>And so, as the cell divides, half the chromosomes go,</p>
<p>they divide into the two parts,</p>
<p>and they go two different ways.</p>
<p>And what is it that&rsquo;s pulling them apart?</p>
<p>Well, those are these little things called microtubules.</p>
<p>And so, he started to get interested in them.</p>
<p>And he formed the view, well, he was,</p>
<p>his day job or night job or whatever you call it,</p>
<p>is to put people to sleep,</p>
<p>except he doesn&rsquo;t like calling it sleep</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>General anesthetics in a reversible way.</p>
<p>So, you want to make sure that they don&rsquo;t experience</p>
<p>the pain that would otherwise be something that they feel.</p>
<p>And consciousness is turned off for a while,</p>
<p>and it can be turned back on again.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on.</p>
<p>And what do you do when you&rsquo;re doing that?</p>
<p>What do general anesthetic gases do?</p>
<p>And see, he formed the view that it&rsquo;s the microtubules</p>
<p>that they affect.</p>
<p>And the details of why he formed that view is not,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re clear to me,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an interesting story he keeps talking about.</p>
<p>But I found this very exciting</p>
<p>because I thought these structures,</p>
<p>these little tubes which inhabit pretty well all cells,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just neurons,</p>
<p>apart from red blood cells,</p>
<p>they inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not all the same kind.</p>
<p>You get different kinds of microtubules.</p>
<p>And the ones that excited me the most,</p>
<p>this may still not be totally clear,</p>
<p>but the ones that excited me most</p>
<p>were the only ones that I knew about at the time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very, very symmetrical structures.</p>
<p>And I had reason to believe</p>
<p>that these very symmetrical structures</p>
<p>would be much better at preserving a quantum state,</p>
<p>quantum coherence, preserving the thing without,</p>
<p>you just need to preserve certain degrees of freedom</p>
<p>without them leaking into the environment.</p>
<p>Once they leak into the environment, you&rsquo;re lost.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to preserve these quantum states at a level</p>
<p>which the state reduction process comes in</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I think the noncomputability comes in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the measurement process in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So something about the measurement process</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>something about the structure of the microtubules,</p>
<p>your intuition says maybe there&rsquo;s something here,</p>
<p>maybe this kind of structure allows</p>
<p>for the mystery of the quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There was a much better chance, yes.</p>
<p>It just struck me that partly it was the symmetry</p>
<p>because there is a feature of symmetry</p>
<p>you can preserve quantum coherence</p>
<p>much better with symmetrical structures.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason for that.</p>
<p>And that impressed me a lot.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the difference between the A lattice</p>
<p>and B lattice at that time, which could be important.</p>
<p>Now that could even, see, which isn&rsquo;t talked about much.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s some, in some sense, details.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to take a step back just to say</p>
<p>in case people are not familiar.</p>
<p>So this was called the orchestrated objective reduction</p>
<p>idea or ORCOR, which is a biological philosophy of mind</p>
<p>that postulates that consciousness originates</p>
<p>at the quantum level inside neurons.</p>
<p>So that has to do with your search for where,</p>
<p>where is it coming from?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s counter to the notion that consciousness</p>
<p>may arise from the computation performed by the synapses.</p>
<p>Yes, I think the key point.</p>
<p>Sometimes people say it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s quantum mechanical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s more outrageous than that.</p>
<p>You see, this is one reason I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so far off from it,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t even know the physics right.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s not just quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>People say, oh, you know, quantum systems</p>
<p>and biological structures.</p>
<p>No, will you starting to see that</p>
<p>some basic biological systems does depend on quantum.</p>
<p>I mean, look, in the first place,</p>
<p>all of chemistry is quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>People got used to that, so they don&rsquo;t count that.</p>
<p>So he said, let&rsquo;s not count quantum chemistry.</p>
<p>We sort of got the hang of that, I think.</p>
<p>But you have quantum effects,</p>
<p>which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>And this is one of the striking things</p>
<p>in the last several years,</p>
<p>that photosynthesis seems to be a basically quantum process,</p>
<p>which is not simply chemical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using quantum mechanics in a very basic way.</p>
<p>So you could start saying, oh, well,</p>
<p>if photosynthesis is based on quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>why not behavior of neurons and things like that?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>which is a bit like photosynthesis in that respect.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is even more outrageous than that,</p>
<p>because those things are talking</p>
<p>about conventional quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Now, my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just following the Schrodinger equation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still computable.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to go beyond that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to go to where</p>
<p>quantum mechanics goes wrong in a certain sense.</p>
<p>You have to be a little bit careful about that,</p>
<p>because the way people do quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is a sort of mixture of two different processes.</p>
<p>One of them is the Schrodinger equation,</p>
<p>which is an equation Schrodinger wrote down,</p>
<p>and it tells you how the state of a system evolves.</p>
<p>And it evolves according to this equation,</p>
<p>completely deterministic,</p>
<p>but it evolves into ridiculous situations.</p>
<p>And this was what Schrodinger</p>
<p>was very much pointing out with his cat.</p>
<p>He said, you follow my equation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation,</p>
<p>and you could say that you have to get a cat,</p>
<p>a cat which is dead and alive at the same time.</p>
<p>That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation,</p>
<p>would lead to a state, which is the cat being dead</p>
<p>and alive at the same time.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s more or less saying, this is an absurdity.</p>
<p>People nowadays say, oh, well, Schrodinger said</p>
<p>you can have a cat which is dead, that&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>You see, he was saying, this is an absurdity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something missing.</p>
<p>And that the reduction of the state</p>
<p>or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is,</p>
<p>is something which has to be understood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not following the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something more than that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to quote authority here because Einstein,</p>
<p>at least three of the greatest physicists</p>
<p>of 20th century who were very fundamental</p>
<p>in developing quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>Einstein, one of them, Schrodinger, another,</p>
<p>Dirac, another.</p>
<p>You have to look carefully at Dirac&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t tend to say this out loud too much</p>
<p>because he was very cautious about what he said.</p>
<p>You find the right place and you see he says</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is a provisional theory.</p>
<p>We need something which explains</p>
<p>the collapse of the wave function.</p>
<p>We need to go beyond the theory we have now.</p>
<p>I happen to be one of the kinds of people,</p>
<p>there are many, there is a whole group of people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all considered to be a bit mavericks,</p>
<p>who believe that quantum mechanics needs to be modified.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small minority of those people,</p>
<p>which are already a minority,</p>
<p>who think that the way in which it&rsquo;s modified</p>
<p>has to be with gravity.</p>
<p>And there is an even smaller minority of those people</p>
<p>who think it&rsquo;s the particular way that I think it is.</p>
<p>You see.</p>
<p>So those are the quantum gravity folks.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, quantum gravity is already not this.</p>
<p>Because when you say quantum gravity,</p>
<p>what you really mean is quantum mechanics</p>
<p>applied to gravitational theory.</p>
<p>So you say, let&rsquo;s take this wonderful formalism</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit into it.</p>
<p>So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;ve got to be more even handed</p>
<p>that gravity affects the structure of quantum mechanics too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just you quantize gravity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to gravitate quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a two way thing.</p>
<p>But then when do you even get started?</p>
<p>So that you&rsquo;re saying that we have to figure out</p>
<p>a totally new ideas in there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the trouble.</p>
<p>So this is a big problem.</p>
<p>If you say, okay, well, what&rsquo;s the theory?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So maybe in the very early days, sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>It is in the very early days.</p>
<p>But just making this point.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You see, Stuart Hammeroff tends to be,</p>
<p>oh, Penrose says that it&rsquo;s got to be a reduction</p>
<p>of the state and so on, so let&rsquo;s use it.</p>
<p>The trouble is Penrose doesn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Penrose says, well, I think that we have no experiments</p>
<p>as yet, which shows that.</p>
<p>There are experiments which are being thought through</p>
<p>and which I&rsquo;m hoping will be performed.</p>
<p>There is an experiment which is being developed</p>
<p>by Dirk Baumeister, who I&rsquo;ve known for a long time,</p>
<p>who shares his time between Leiden in the Netherlands</p>
<p>and Santa Barbara in the US.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been working on an experiment</p>
<p>which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>as we now understand it, if you don&rsquo;t bring in</p>
<p>the gravitational effects, it has to be modified.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also experiments that are underway</p>
<p>that kind of look at the microtubule side of things</p>
<p>to see if there&rsquo;s, in the biology,</p>
<p>you could see something like that.</p>
<p>Could you briefly mention it?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s really sort of one of the only</p>
<p>experimental attempts in the very early days</p>
<p>of even thinking about consciousness.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very serious area here,</p>
<p>which is what Stuart Hammeroff is doing,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>One of the few places that you can really get</p>
<p>a bit of a handle on what consciousness is</p>
<p>is what turns it off.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re thinking about general anesthetics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very specific.</p>
<p>These things turn consciousness off.</p>
<p>What the hell do they do?</p>
<p>Well, Stuart and a number of people who work with him</p>
<p>and others happen to believe that the general anesthetics</p>
<p>directly affect microtubules.</p>
<p>And there is some evidence for this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how strong it is</p>
<p>and how watertight the case is,</p>
<p>but I think there is some evidence pointing</p>
<p>in that kind of direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an ordinary chemical process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something quite different about it.</p>
<p>And one of the main candidates</p>
<p>is that these anesthetic gases</p>
<p>do affect directly microtubules.</p>
<p>And how strong that evidence is,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be in a position to say,</p>
<p>but I think there is fairly impressive evidence.</p>
<p>And the point is the experiments are being undertaken,</p>
<p>which is. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that is experimental.</p>
<p>You see, so it&rsquo;s a very clear direction</p>
<p>where you can think of experiments</p>
<p>which could indicate whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really microtubules which the anesthetic gases</p>
<p>directly affect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>One of the sad things is as far as I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>from my outside perspective,</p>
<p>is not many people are working on this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very, like with Stuart,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s very few people</p>
<p>are carrying the flag forward on this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not many in the sense it&rsquo;s a minority,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not zero anymore.</p>
<p>You see, when Stuart and I were originally taught by us,</p>
<p>we were just us and a few of our friends,</p>
<p>there weren&rsquo;t many people taking it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s grown into one of the main viewpoints.</p>
<p>There might be about four or five or six different</p>
<p>views which people hold,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s considered as one of the possible</p>
<p>lines of thinking, yes.</p>
<p>You describe physics theories</p>
<p>as falling into one of three categories,</p>
<p>the superb, the useful, or the tentative.</p>
<p>I like those words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful categorization.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever have a superb theory</p>
<p>of intelligence and of consciousness?</p>
<p>We might.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a long way from it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re even,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re in the tentative scale.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve even entered the realm of tentative?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Now, when you see this, it&rsquo;s so controversial.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a clear view</p>
<p>which is accepted by a majority.</p>
<p>I mean, you see, yeah, people,</p>
<p>most views are computational in one form or another.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s some, but it&rsquo;s not very clear,</p>
<p>because even the IIT people who</p>
<p>think of them as computational,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard them say,</p>
<p>no, consciousness is supposed to be not computational.</p>
<p>I say, well, if it&rsquo;s not computational,</p>
<p>what in the hell is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>What physical processes are going on which are that?</p>
<p>What does it mean for something to be computational then?</p>
<p>So, is&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, there has to be a process which is&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s very curious</p>
<p>the way the history has developed in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>because very early on,</p>
<p>people thought there was something to do with consciousness,</p>
<p>but it was almost the other way around.</p>
<p>You see, you have to say the Schrodinger equation</p>
<p>says all these different alternatives happen all at once,</p>
<p>and then when is it that only one of them happens?</p>
<p>Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held</p>
<p>by a few distinguished quantum physicists,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when a conscious being looks at the system</p>
<p>or becomes aware of it,</p>
<p>and at that point, it becomes one or the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a role where consciousness</p>
<p>is somehow actively reducing the state.</p>
<p>My view is almost the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the state reduces itself in some way which&hellip;</p>
<p>Some noncomputational way which we don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a proper theory of,</p>
<p>and that is the building block of what consciousness is.</p>
<p>So consciousness is the other way around.</p>
<p>It depends on that choice which nature makes all the time</p>
<p>when the state becomes one or the other</p>
<p>rather than the superposition of one and the other,</p>
<p>and when that happens, there is what we&rsquo;re saying now,</p>
<p>an element of proto consciousness takes place.</p>
<p>Proto consciousness is, roughly speaking,</p>
<p>the building block out of which</p>
<p>actual consciousness is constructed.</p>
<p>So you have these proto conscious elements,</p>
<p>which are when the state decides</p>
<p>to do one thing or the other,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing which when organized together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the OR part in ORCOR, but the ORC part,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the OR part at least one can see</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re driving at a theory.</p>
<p>You can say it&rsquo;s the quantum choice</p>
<p>of going this way or that way,</p>
<p>but the ORC part, which is the orchestration of this,</p>
<p>is much more mysterious,</p>
<p>and how does the brain somehow orchestrate</p>
<p>all these individual OR processes</p>
<p>into a genuine, genuine conscious experience?</p>
<p>And it might be something that&rsquo;s beautifully simple,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re completely in the dark about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think at the moment, that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>you know, we happily put the word ORC down there</p>
<p>to say orchestrated, but that&rsquo;s even more unclear</p>
<p>what that really means.</p>
<p>Just like the word material, orchestrated, who knows?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been dancing a little bit</p>
<p>between the word intelligence</p>
<p>or understanding and consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you kind of see those as sitting</p>
<p>in the same space of mystery as we discussed?</p>
<p>Yes, well, you see, I tend to say</p>
<p>you have understanding and intelligence and awareness,</p>
<p>and somehow understanding is in the middle of it, you see.</p>
<p>I like to say, could you say of an entity</p>
<p>that is actually intelligent</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t have the quality of understanding?</p>
<p>Now, you see, I&rsquo;m using terms I don&rsquo;t even know how to define,</p>
<p>but who cares?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just relating them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somewhat poetic, so if I somehow understand them.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, we don&rsquo;t, exactly.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not mathematical in nature.</p>
<p>Yes, you see, as a mathematician,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to define any of them,</p>
<p>but at least I can point to the connections.</p>
<p>So the idea is intelligence is something</p>
<p>which I believe needs understanding,</p>
<p>otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s really intelligence.</p>
<p>And understanding needs awareness,</p>
<p>otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s understanding.</p>
<p>Do you say of an entity that understands something,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s really aware of it, you know, normal usage.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a three sort of awareness,</p>
<p>understanding, and intelligence.</p>
<p>And I just tend to concentrate on understanding</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where I can say something.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the G√∂del theorem, things like that.</p>
<p>But what does it mean to be,</p>
<p>perceive the color blue or something?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m foggiest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much more difficult question.</p>
<p>I mean, is it the same if I see a color blue and you see it?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody with this condition,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it called then?</p>
<p>Or where you assign a sound to a color.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You get colors and sounds mixed up.</p>
<p>And that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I mean, an interesting subject.</p>
<p>But from the physics perspective,</p>
<p>from the fundamentals perspective, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re way off having much understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>In your 2010 book, Cycles of Time,</p>
<p>you suggest that another universe may have existed</p>
<p>before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Can you describe this idea?</p>
<p>First of all, what is the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Sounds like a funny word.</p>
<p>And what may have been there before it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just as a matter of terminology,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to call it another universe.</p>
<p>Because when you have another universe,</p>
<p>you think of it kind of quite separate from us.</p>
<p>But these things, they&rsquo;re not separate.</p>
<p>Now the Big Bang, conventional theory.</p>
<p>You see, I was actually brought up</p>
<p>in the sense of when I started getting</p>
<p>interested in cosmology,</p>
<p>there was a thing called the Steady State Model,</p>
<p>which was sort of philosophically very interesting.</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t a Big Bang in that theory.</p>
<p>But somehow, new material was created all the time</p>
<p>in the form of hydrogen,</p>
<p>and the universe kept on expanding, expanding, expanding,</p>
<p>and there was room for more hydrogen.</p>
<p>It was a rather philosophically nice picture.</p>
<p>It was disproved when the Big Bang,</p>
<p>well, when I say the Big Bang,</p>
<p>this was theoretically discovered</p>
<p>by people trying to solve Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>and apply it to cosmology.</p>
<p>Einstein didn&rsquo;t like the idea.</p>
<p>He liked a universe which was there all the time.</p>
<p>And he had a model which was there all the time.</p>
<p>But then there was this discovery,</p>
<p>accidental discovery, very important discovery,</p>
<p>of this microwave background.</p>
<p>And if you, there&rsquo;s the crackle on your television screen</p>
<p>which is already sensing this microwave background,</p>
<p>which is coming at us from all directions.</p>
<p>And you can trace it back and back and back and back.</p>
<p>And it came from a very early stage of the universe.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s part of the Big Bang theory.</p>
<p>The Big Bang theory was when people tried</p>
<p>to solve Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>They really found you had to have this initial state</p>
<p>where the universe, it used to be called</p>
<p>the primordial atom and things like this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Friedman and Lemaitre.</p>
<p>Friedman was a Russian, Lemaitre was a Belgian.</p>
<p>And they independently, well, basically Friedman first.</p>
<p>And Lemaitre talked about the initial state,</p>
<p>which is a very, very concentrated initial state</p>
<p>which seemed to be the origin of the universe.</p>
<p>Primordial atom.</p>
<p>Primordial atom is what he called it, yes.</p>
<p>And then it became, well, Fred Hoyle used the term</p>
<p>Big Bang in a kind of derogatory sense.</p>
<p>Just like with the Schrodinger and the cats, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s like sort of got picked up on</p>
<p>whereas it wasn&rsquo;t his intention originally.</p>
<p>But then the evidence piled up and piled up.</p>
<p>And one of my friends and I learned a lot from him</p>
<p>when I was in Cambridge was Dennis Sharma.</p>
<p>He was a great proponent of steady state.</p>
<p>And then he got converted.</p>
<p>He said, no, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I had a great respect for him.</p>
<p>He went around lecturing and said, I was wrong.</p>
<p>The steady state model doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>There was this Big Bang.</p>
<p>And this microwave background that you see,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s not actually quite the Big Bang.</p>
<p>When I say not quite, it&rsquo;s about 380,000 years</p>
<p>after the Big Bang, but that&rsquo;s what you see.</p>
<p>But then you have to have had this Big Bang before it</p>
<p>in order to make the equations work.</p>
<p>And it works beautifully except for one little thing,</p>
<p>which is this thing called inflation,</p>
<p>which people had to put into it to make it work.</p>
<p>When I first heard of it, I didn&rsquo;t like it at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s inflation?</p>
<p>Inflation is that in the first,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a very tiny number.</p>
<p>Think of a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very long.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna give you a fraction of a second,</p>
<p>one over a number.</p>
<p>This number has 32 digits between,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s say between 36 and 32 digits.</p>
<p>Tiny, tiny time between those two tiny,</p>
<p>ridiculous seconds, fraction of a second,</p>
<p>the universe was supposed to have expanded</p>
<p>in this exponential way, an enormous way.</p>
<p>For no apparent reason, you had to invent</p>
<p>a particular thing called the inflaton field</p>
<p>to make it do it.</p>
<p>And I thought this is completely crazy.</p>
<p>There are reasons why people stuck with this idea.</p>
<p>You see, the thing is that I formed my model</p>
<p>for reasons which are very fundamental, if you like.</p>
<p>It has to do with this very fundamental principle,</p>
<p>which is known as the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics says more or less,</p>
<p>things get more and more random as time goes on.</p>
<p>Now, another way of saying exactly the same thing</p>
<p>is things get less and less random.</p>
<p>As things go back, as you go back in time,</p>
<p>they get less and less random.</p>
<p>They go back and back and back and back.</p>
<p>And the earliest thing you can directly see</p>
<p>is this microwave background.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one of the most striking features of it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s random.</p>
<p>It has this, what you call this spectrum of,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s called the Planck spectrum,</p>
<p>of frequencies, different intensities</p>
<p>for different frequencies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this wonderful curve due to Max Planck.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s it telling you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling you that the entropy is at a maximum.</p>
<p>Started off at a maximum and it&rsquo;s going up ever since.</p>
<p>I call that the mammoth in the room.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a paradox.</p>
<p>A mammoth, yeah, it is.</p>
<p>And so people, why don&rsquo;t cosmologists worry about this?</p>
<p>So I worried about it.</p>
<p>And then I thought, well, it&rsquo;s not really a paradox</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at matter and radiation</p>
<p>at a maximum entropy state.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re not seeing directly in that is the gravitation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gravitation, which is not thermalized.</p>
<p>The gravitation was very, very low entropy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s low entropy by the uniformity.</p>
<p>And you see that in the microwave too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very uniform over the whole sky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m compressing a long story</p>
<p>into a very short few sentences.</p>
<p>And doing a great job, yeah.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that there&rsquo;s a huge puzzle.</p>
<p>Why was gravity in this very low entropy state,</p>
<p>very highly organized state, everything else was all random?</p>
<p>And that to me was the biggest problem in cosmology.</p>
<p>The biggest problem, nobody seems to even worry about it.</p>
<p>People say they solved all the problems</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even worry about it.</p>
<p>They think inflation solves it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just that&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to clarify, that was your problem</p>
<p>with the inflation describing some aspect</p>
<p>of the moments right after the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Inflation is supposed to stretch it out</p>
<p>and make it all uniform, you see.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do it because it can only do it</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s uniform already at the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you just have to look at,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go into the details, but it doesn&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>And it was completely clear to me it doesn&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology</p>
<p>of starting to talk about something before</p>
<p>that singular and the Big Bang?</p>
<p>I was just thinking to myself,</p>
<p>how boring this universe is going to be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this exponential expansion.</p>
<p>This was discovered early in the,</p>
<p>in this century, 21st century.</p>
<p>People discovered that these supernova exploding stars</p>
<p>showed that the universe is actually undergoing</p>
<p>this exponential expansion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a self similar expansion.</p>
<p>And it seems to be a feature of this term</p>
<p>that Einstein introduced into his cosmology</p>
<p>for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>He wanted a universe that was static.</p>
<p>He put this new term into his cosmology.</p>
<p>To make it make sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the cosmological constant.</p>
<p>And then when he got convinced</p>
<p>that the universe had a Big Bang,</p>
<p>he retracted it complaining this was his greatest blunder.</p>
<p>The trouble is it wasn&rsquo;t a blunder.</p>
<p>It was actually right, very ironic.</p>
<p>And so the universe seems to be behaving</p>
<p>with this cosmological constant.</p>
<p>Okay, so this universe is expanding and expanding.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen in the future?</p>
<p>Well, it gets more and more boring for a while.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most interesting thing in the universe?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s black holes.</p>
<p>The black holes more or less gulp down</p>
<p>entire clusters of galaxies.</p>
<p>The cluster, it&rsquo;ll swallow up most of our galaxy.</p>
<p>We will run into our Andromeda galaxy&rsquo;s black hole.</p>
<p>That black hole will swallow our one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll basically swallow up</p>
<p>the whole cluster of galaxies, gulp it all down.</p>
<p>Pretty well all, most of it, maybe not all, most of it.</p>
<p>Okay, then that&rsquo;ll happen to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be just these black holes around.</p>
<p>Pretty boring, but still not as boring as it&rsquo;s gonna get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get more boring because these black holes,</p>
<p>you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait</p>
<p>an unbelievable length of time</p>
<p>and Hawking&rsquo;s black hole evaporation starts to come in.</p>
<p>And the black holes, you just, it&rsquo;s incredibly tedious.</p>
<p>Finally evaporate away.</p>
<p>Each one goes away, disappears with a pop at the end.</p>
<p>What could be more boring?</p>
<p>It was boring then, now this is really boring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, not even black holes.</p>
<p>Universe gets colder and colder and colder and colder.</p>
<p>And I thought, this is very, very boring.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not science, is it?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s emotional.</p>
<p>So I thought, who&rsquo;s gonna be bored by this universe?</p>
<p>Not us, we won&rsquo;t be around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be mostly photons running around.</p>
<p>And what the photons do, they don&rsquo;t get bored</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of relativity, you see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really that they don&rsquo;t experience anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>Photons get right out to infinity</p>
<p>without experience any time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way relativity works.</p>
<p>And this was part of what I used to do in my old days</p>
<p>when I was looking at gravitational radiation</p>
<p>and how things behaved to infinity.</p>
<p>Infinity is just like another place.</p>
<p>You can squash it down.</p>
<p>As long as you don&rsquo;t have any mass in the world,</p>
<p>infinity is just another place.</p>
<p>The photons get there, the gravitons get there.</p>
<p>What do they get?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve run into infinity.</p>
<p>They say, well, now I&rsquo;m here, what do I?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something on the other side, is there?</p>
<p>The usual view, it&rsquo;s just a mathematical notion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing on the other side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the boundary of it.</p>
<p>A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures</p>
<p>by the Dutch artist MC Escher.</p>
<p>You may know them.</p>
<p>The one&rsquo;s called Circle Limits.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a very famous one with the angels and the devils.</p>
<p>And you can see them crowding and crowding</p>
<p>and crowding up to the edge.</p>
<p>Now, the kind of geometry that these angels and devils</p>
<p>inhabit, that&rsquo;s their infinity.</p>
<p>But from our perspective, infinity is just a place.</p>
<p>Okay, there is&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, can you just take a brief pause?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In just the words you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>infinity is just a place.</p>
<p>So for the most part, infinity, sort of even just going back,</p>
<p>infinity is a mathematical concept.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the things&hellip;</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s an actual physical manifest&hellip;</p>
<p>In which way does infinity ever manifest itself</p>
<p>in our physical universe?</p>
<p>Well, it does in various places.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s a thing that if you&rsquo;re not a mathematician,</p>
<p>you think, oh, infinity, I can&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>Mathematicians think about affinity all the time.</p>
<p>They get used to the idea and they just play around</p>
<p>with different kinds of infinities</p>
<p>and it becomes no problem.</p>
<p>But you just have to take my word for it.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things is,</p>
<p>you see, you take a Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Well, it just keeps on going and it goes out to infinity.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s other kinds of geometry</p>
<p>and this is what&rsquo;s called hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like Euclidean geometry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what Escher was trying to describe</p>
<p>in his angels and devils.</p>
<p>And he learned about this from Coxeter</p>
<p>and he think that&rsquo;s a very nice thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I represent this infinity</p>
<p>to this kind of geometry.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not quite Euclidean geometry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit like it,</p>
<p>that the angels and the devils inhabit.</p>
<p>And their infinity, by this nice transformation,</p>
<p>you squash their infinity down</p>
<p>so you can draw it as this nice circle boundary</p>
<p>to their universe.</p>
<p>Now, from our outside perspective,</p>
<p>we can see their infinity as this boundary.</p>
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;m saying is that it&rsquo;s very like that.</p>
<p>The infinity that we might experience</p>
<p>like those angels and devils in their world</p>
<p>can be thought of as a boundary.</p>
<p>Now, I found this a very useful way</p>
<p>of talking about radiation,</p>
<p>gravitational radiation and things like that.</p>
<p>It was a trick, mathematical trick.</p>
<p>So now what I&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>that mathematical trick becomes real.</p>
<p>That somehow, the photons,</p>
<p>they need to go somewhere</p>
<p>because from their perspective,</p>
<p>infinity is just another place.</p>
<p>Now, this is a difficult idea to get your mind around.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the reasons cosmologists</p>
<p>are finding a lot of trouble taking me seriously.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s not such a wild idea.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s on the other side of that infinity?</p>
<p>You have to think, why am I allowed to think of this?</p>
<p>Why am I allowed to think of this?</p>
<p>Because photons don&rsquo;t have any mass.</p>
<p>And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time.</p>
<p>There are incredibly precise clocks,</p>
<p>atomic and nuclear clocks, unbelievably precise.</p>
<p>Why are they so precise?</p>
<p>Because of the two most famous equations</p>
<p>of 20th century physics.</p>
<p>One of them is Einstein&rsquo;s E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that tell us?</p>
<p>Energy and mass are equivalent.</p>
<p>The other one is even older than that,</p>
<p>still 20th century, only just.</p>
<p>Max Planck, E equals h nu.</p>
<p>Nu is a frequency,</p>
<p>h is a constant, again, like C.</p>
<p>E is energy.</p>
<p>Energy and frequency are equivalent.</p>
<p>Put the two together,</p>
<p>energy and mass are equivalent, Einstein.</p>
<p>Energy and frequency are equivalent, Max Planck.</p>
<p>Put the two together, mass and frequency are equivalent.</p>
<p>Absolutely basic physical principle.</p>
<p>If you have a massive entity, a massive particle,</p>
<p>it is a clock with a very, very precise frequency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t directly use it,</p>
<p>you have to scale it down.</p>
<p>So your atomic and nuclear clocks,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the basic principle.</p>
<p>You scale it down to something you can actually perceive.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same principle.</p>
<p>If you have mass, you have beautiful clocks.</p>
<p>But the other side of that coin is,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have mass, you don&rsquo;t have clocks.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have clocks, you don&rsquo;t have rulers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have scale.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have space and time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a measure of the scale of space and time.</p>
<p>Oh, scale of space and time.</p>
<p>You do have the structure,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the conformal structure.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s what the angels and devils have.</p>
<p>If you look at the eye of the devil,</p>
<p>no matter how close to the boundary it is,</p>
<p>it has the same shape, but it has a different size.</p>
<p>So you can scale up and you can scale down,</p>
<p>but you mustn&rsquo;t change the shape.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically the same idea,</p>
<p>but applied to space time now.</p>
<p>In the very remote future,</p>
<p>you have things which don&rsquo;t measure the scale,</p>
<p>but the shape, if you like, is still there.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s in the remote future.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna go way back into the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Now as you get there, things get hotter and hotter,</p>
<p>denser and denser.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the universe dominated by?</p>
<p>Particles moving around almost with the speed of light.</p>
<p>When they get almost with the speed of light,</p>
<p>okay, they begin to lose the mass too.</p>
<p>So for completely opposite reason,</p>
<p>they lose the sense of scale as well.</p>
<p>So my crazy idea is the Big Bang and the remote future,</p>
<p>they seem completely different.</p>
<p>One is extremely dense, extremely hot.</p>
<p>The other is very, very rarefied and very, very cold.</p>
<p>But if you squash one down by this conformal scaling,</p>
<p>you get the other.</p>
<p>So although they look and feel very different,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really almost the same.</p>
<p>The remote future on the other side,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m claiming is that where do the photons go?</p>
<p>They go into the next Big Bang.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get your mind around that crazy idea.</p>
<p>Taking a step on the other side of the place</p>
<p>that is infinity.</p>
<p>Okay, but.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m saying the other side of our Big Bang,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m going back into the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Back, backwards.</p>
<p>There was the remote future of a previous eon.</p>
<p>Previous eon.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying is that previous eon,</p>
<p>there are signals coming through to us,</p>
<p>which we can see and which we do see.</p>
<p>And these are both signals,</p>
<p>the two main signals are to do with black holes.</p>
<p>One of them is the collisions between black holes.</p>
<p>And as they spiral into each other,</p>
<p>they release a lot of energy</p>
<p>in the form of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Those gravitational waves get through</p>
<p>in a certain form into the next eon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but that means that some information can travel</p>
<p>from another eon.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen somewhere described</p>
<p>sort of the discussion of the Fermi Paradox,</p>
<p>you know, that if there&rsquo;s intelligent life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Being, you know, communication immediately takes you there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>We have a paper, I have my colleague,</p>
<p>Vahid Guzajan, who I worked with on these ideas for a while.</p>
<p>We have a crazy paper on that, yes.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Looking at the Fermi Paradox, yes.</p>
<p>Right, so if the universe is just cycling</p>
<p>over and over and over,</p>
<p>punctuated by the, punctuated the singularity</p>
<p>of the Big Bang,</p>
<p>and then intelligent or any kind of intelligent systems</p>
<p>can communicate through from eon to eon,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we heard anything from our alien friends?</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know how to look.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamentally the reason, is we.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you see, it&rsquo;s speculation.</p>
<p>I mean, the SETI program is a reasonable thing to do,</p>
<p>but still speculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away</p>
<p>was a civilization which got there first, before us,</p>
<p>early enough that they could send us signals,</p>
<p>but how far away would you need to go before,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, we have so little knowledge</p>
<p>about that, we haven&rsquo;t seen any signals yet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worth looking, it&rsquo;s worth looking.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say, here&rsquo;s another possible place</p>
<p>where you might look.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re not looking at civilizations</p>
<p>which got there first,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at those civilizations</p>
<p>which were so successful,</p>
<p>probably a lot more successful than they&rsquo;re likely to be</p>
<p>by the looks of things,</p>
<p>which knew how to handle their own global warming</p>
<p>or whatever it is and to get through it all</p>
<p>and to live to a ripe old age in the sense of a civilization</p>
<p>to the extent that they could harness signals</p>
<p>that they could propagate through for some reason</p>
<p>of their own desires, whatever we wouldn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>to other civilizations</p>
<p>which might be able to pick up the signals.</p>
<p>But what kind of signals would they be?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t the foggiest.</p>
<p>Let me ask the question.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful idea</p>
<p>in physics or mathematics or the art</p>
<p>at the intersection of the two?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to say complex analysis.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve said infinities.</p>
<p>And one of the most single, most beautiful idea</p>
<p>I think was the fact that you can have</p>
<p>infinities of different sizes and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s in a way, I think complex analysis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got so much magic in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple idea.</p>
<p>You take these, you take numbers,</p>
<p>you take the integers and then you fill them up</p>
<p>into the fractions and the real numbers.</p>
<p>You imagine you&rsquo;re trying to measure a continuous line</p>
<p>and then you think of how you can solve equations.</p>
<p>Then what about X squared equals minus one?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no real number which has to satisfy that.</p>
<p>So you have to think of, well, there&rsquo;s a number called I.</p>
<p>You think you invent it.</p>
<p>Well, in a certain sense, it&rsquo;s there already.</p>
<p>But this number, when you add that square root</p>
<p>of minus one to it,</p>
<p>you have what&rsquo;s called the complex numbers.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re an incredible system.</p>
<p>If you like, you put one little thing in,</p>
<p>you put square root of minus one in</p>
<p>and you get how much benefit out of it.</p>
<p>All sorts of things that you&rsquo;d never imagined before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that amazing, all hiding there</p>
<p>in putting that square root of minus one in.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most magical thing I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in mathematics or physics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s there already.</p>
<p>You might think, what&rsquo;s it doing there?</p>
<p>Okay, just a nice beautiful piece of mathematics.</p>
<p>And then suddenly we see, nope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the very crucial basis of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there and the way the world works.</p>
<p>So on the question of whether math</p>
<p>is discovered or invented,</p>
<p>it sounds like you may be suggesting</p>
<p>that partially it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that math is indeed discovered.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s more like archeology than you might think.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So let me ask the most ridiculous,</p>
<p>maybe the most important question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,</p>
<p>happiness, and meaning?</p>
<p>Why do you think we&rsquo;re here on this?</p>
<p>Given all the big bang and the infinities of photons</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>All I would say, I think it&rsquo;s not a stupid question.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some people, you know,</p>
<p>many of my colleagues who are scientists,</p>
<p>and they say, well, that&rsquo;s a stupid question,</p>
<p>meaning, yeah, well, we&rsquo;re just here</p>
<p>because things came together and produced life</p>
<p>and so what.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more to it.</p>
<p>But what there is that&rsquo;s more to it,</p>
<p>I have really much idea.</p>
<p>And it might be somehow connected</p>
<p>to the mechanisms of consciousness</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about, the mystery there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s connected with all sorts of, yeah,</p>
<p>I think these things are tied up in ways which are,</p>
<p>you see, I tend to think the mystery of consciousness</p>
<p>is tied up with the mystery of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and how it fits in with the classical world,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all to do with the mystery of complex numbers.</p>
<p>And there are mysteries there</p>
<p>which look like mathematical mysteries,</p>
<p>but they seem to have a bearing</p>
<p>on the way the physical world operates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re scratching the surface.</p>
<p>We have a long, huge way to go</p>
<p>before we really understand that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful idea that the depth,</p>
<p>the mathematical depth could be discovered,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s tragedies of ghettos</p>
<p>and completeness along the way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll have to somehow figure our ways around.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, Roger, it was a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom</p>
<p>that Roger Penrose wrote in his book,</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Mind.</p>
<p>Beneath all this technicality is the feeling</p>
<p>that it is indeed, quote unquote, obvious</p>
<p>that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer,</p>
<p>even though much of what is involved</p>
<p>in mental activity might do so.</p>
<p>This is the kind of obviousness that a child can see,</p>
<p>though the child may later in life become browbeaten</p>
<p>into believing that the obvious problems</p>
<p>are quote unquote, non problems,</p>
<p>to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning</p>
<p>and clever choices of definition.</p>
<p>Children sometimes see things clearly</p>
<p>that are obscured in later life.</p>
<p>We often forget the wonder that we felt as children</p>
<p>when the cares of the quote unquote, real world</p>
<p>had begun to settle on our shoulders.</p>
<p>Children are not afraid to pose basic questions</p>
<p>that may embarrass us as adults to ask.</p>
<p>What happens to each of our streams of consciousness</p>
<p>after we die?</p>
<p>Where was it before we were born?</p>
<p>Might we become or have been someone else?</p>
<p>Why do we perceive it all?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Why is there a universe here at all</p>
<p>in which we can actually be?</p>
<p>These are puzzles that tend to come</p>
<p>with the awakenings of awareness in any of us</p>
<p>and no doubt with the awakening of self awareness</p>
<p>within whichever creature or other entity it first came.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
