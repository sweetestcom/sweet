    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing meditation.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss the science of meditation,</p>
<p>that is, what happens in the brain and body</p>
<p>while we are meditating,</p>
<p>and we will talk about the science of meditation</p>
<p>as it relates to how the brain and body change</p>
<p>as a consequence of meditation.</p>
<p>That is, what you export or take from a meditation practice</p>
<p>that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood.</p>
<p>For instance, meditation has been shown</p>
<p>to alleviate symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>and we will also talk about how meditation can be used</p>
<p>to enhance focus and other states of mind</p>
<p>that are useful for work and other aspects of life.</p>
<p>Now, of course, most of you have probably heard</p>
<p>of meditation, and when we think of meditation,</p>
<p>most often we think of somebody</p>
<p>either sitting or lying down.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re sitting, we might imagine them</p>
<p>in the so-called lotus position,</p>
<p>sitting with legs crossed, very upright,</p>
<p>with hands on the knees or crossed in our lap</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Typically, we think of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in a very calm state, eyes closed,</p>
<p>focused on their so-called third eye center.</p>
<p>The third eye center is the area just behind one&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no third eye there, at least there shouldn&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you why it&rsquo;s called the third eye center</p>
<p>and what the origins of that are</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s relevant, actually, for a meditative practice.</p>
<p>With all that said, it turns out that meditation</p>
<p>encompasses a huge variety of different practices.</p>
<p>Some of those practices indeed are done</p>
<p>sitting or lying down with one&rsquo;s eyes closed,</p>
<p>focusing on the third eye center.</p>
<p>Other of those practices are focused on a body scan,</p>
<p>you know, really focusing on one area of the body</p>
<p>and its contact with whatever surface</p>
<p>you happen to be sitting or lying on,</p>
<p>or can be done walking.</p>
<p>In fact, there are walking meditations done with eyes open.</p>
<p>So there are many different forms of meditation,</p>
<p>but today we are going to focus mainly</p>
<p>on how specific types of meditation</p>
<p>and specific areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are activated during those meditations</p>
<p>change our way of being in fundamental ways,</p>
<p>not just during the meditation practice,</p>
<p>but afterwards as well.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in changing your default state of mood,</p>
<p>or of thinking, or enhancing your ability to focus,</p>
<p>or improving your sleep, or improving performance</p>
<p>in some cognitive or physical endeavor,</p>
<p>meditation is powerful, but you want to make sure</p>
<p>that you pick the right meditation practice.</p>
<p>So we will talk about picking a meditation practice</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just feasible because you&rsquo;ll do it,</p>
<p>but is actually directed at the goals specific to you</p>
<p>and what you need most.</p>
<p>So to give you some sense of the contour of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>first, I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the underlying biology,</p>
<p>the mechanisms and the brain areas,</p>
<p>and also the areas of the body that are activated</p>
<p>during certain forms of meditation,</p>
<p>and equally important, which areas of the brain and body</p>
<p>are shut down or reduced in their activity</p>
<p>during specific types of meditation.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll transition into</p>
<p>how to best do a meditation practice,</p>
<p>how to get the most out of that meditation practice.</p>
<p>And then I will talk about how to change</p>
<p>or alter your meditation practices</p>
<p>according to your specific goals,</p>
<p>and as you get better at meditation.</p>
<p>And this can get a little bit counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but in a positive way.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is, for instance,</p>
<p>a lot of people think that as you meditate</p>
<p>and get better at meditating,</p>
<p>you need to meditate more and more and more.</p>
<p>Sort of like if you get better at running endurance races</p>
<p>that you need to keep running longer and longer,</p>
<p>first a 5K, then a 10K, then a marathon, then ultras.</p>
<p>With meditation, it&rsquo;s actually quite the opposite.</p>
<p>The better that you get</p>
<p>at dropping into a particular brain state,</p>
<p>and the more your so-called traits of brain state shift,</p>
<p>not just states as they&rsquo;re sometimes referred to,</p>
<p>but traits.</p>
<p>This is a theme that I&rsquo;ve picked up</p>
<p>from a terrific book that I&rsquo;ll refer to later.</p>
<p>But the more that you can get</p>
<p>into specific neural circuits quickly,</p>
<p>actually, the less you need to meditate</p>
<p>in order to derive the benefits of meditation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a wonderful aspect of meditative practices</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise</p>
<p>and cognitive enhancing exercises.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about all of that today.</p>
<p>And I promise that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have a rich array of meditative practices</p>
<p>to select from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know why each of them work</p>
<p>and why they can be directed toward particular goals</p>
<p>and how to do that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll also know how to modify</p>
<p>those meditation practices</p>
<p>under conditions where you might get busier</p>
<p>or where you&rsquo;re suffering from lack of sleep.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people will be excited to know</p>
<p>that today we&rsquo;re going to discuss</p>
<p>a specific form of meditation</p>
<p>that can indeed reduce your need for sleep</p>
<p>and still allow you to enhance</p>
<p>your cognitive and physical abilities.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about meditation.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we are going to talk about</p>
<p>what areas of the brain and body are active</p>
<p>during meditation and after meditation,</p>
<p>and why that can be so beneficial.</p>
<p>We will also talk about when and how best to meditate.</p>
<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve long been interested in.</p>
<p>I was first given a book on meditation</p>
<p>when I was in high school,</p>
<p>because to make a long story short,</p>
<p>it was a bit of a wild one early in my high school years.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of a program that I was in,</p>
<p>somebody handed me a book on meditation.</p>
<p>That book is still available now.</p>
<p>That book is called</p>
<p>Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn.</p>
<p>He was one of the first, not the only,</p>
<p>but one of the first people</p>
<p>to really start popularizing meditation</p>
<p>and mindfulness practices in the United States.</p>
<p>So this was in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>And it was really only until recently</p>
<p>that there were very few studies of meditation,</p>
<p>although those really picked up in the 90s.</p>
<p>Now you can find many, many thousands of studies</p>
<p>on meditation and their mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>So brain imaging studies, changes in hormones in the body.</p>
<p>But in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>because functional imaging of the brain,</p>
<p>so-called MRI or fMRI,</p>
<p>was really just starting to emerge as a popular tool</p>
<p>in laboratories and hospitals,</p>
<p>there really wasn&rsquo;t that much mechanistic understanding</p>
<p>about how meditation worked.</p>
<p>But of course, there was a deep understanding</p>
<p>from cultures outside the United States</p>
<p>that meditation was extremely useful.</p>
<p>I should just mention,</p>
<p>as long as we&rsquo;re talking about the history of meditation,</p>
<p>any discussion about meditation</p>
<p>is going to be a discussion about states of mind.</p>
<p>And any discussion about states of mind</p>
<p>invokes the word consciousness,</p>
<p>a kind of a dangerous topic to get into in any format,</p>
<p>because a lot of people talk about consciousness,</p>
<p>but people use consciousness,</p>
<p>the word to mean different things.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have one standard operational definition</p>
<p>as scientists call it.</p>
<p>However, discussions about consciousness</p>
<p>are often part and parcel with conversations</p>
<p>about things like psychedelics</p>
<p>and kind of alternative therapies.</p>
<p>And so in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s,</p>
<p>meditation and psychedelics were actually close cousins</p>
<p>in the conversation about consciousness and states of mind.</p>
<p>That conversation started to split</p>
<p>into two different divisions,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain why in a moment.</p>
<p>It gets to a little bit of interesting academic sociology,</p>
<p>but what happened was there were a couple of guys</p>
<p>at Harvard, including Timothy Leary and others,</p>
<p>who got really interested in psychedelics,</p>
<p>in particular LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide.</p>
<p>And at that time,</p>
<p>that was part of the whole counterculture movement.</p>
<p>It was considered very anti-establishment,</p>
<p>and they were really encouraging students at Harvard</p>
<p>to take LSD.</p>
<p>They were also very interested in meditation,</p>
<p>but what ended up happening is they essentially</p>
<p>got kicked out or fired from Harvard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a book that I&rsquo;ll refer you to</p>
<p>in the show note captions,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about all this,</p>
<p>but they got kicked out and fired</p>
<p>for their emphasis on psychedelics.</p>
<p>Now, nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in psychedelics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had episodes with Dr. Matthew Johnson</p>
<p>from Johns Hopkins University,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s running clinical trials on psychedelics</p>
<p>like psilocybin and LSD for the treatment</p>
<p>of depression and PTSD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also had Dr. Nolan Williams on the podcast,</p>
<p>my colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing incredible studies</p>
<p>on some of those compounds as well.</p>
<p>So nowadays the conversation about psychedelics</p>
<p>is coming back,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s somewhat divorced from the conversation</p>
<p>about meditation.</p>
<p>But in the 1960s and 1970s,</p>
<p>the conversation about psychedelics and meditation</p>
<p>was sort of one in the same.</p>
<p>That changed in the late 1980s and early 1990s,</p>
<p>when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books</p>
<p>that were purely about meditation</p>
<p>and suggesting that people explore meditative practices</p>
<p>for the utility to bring calmness, adjust stress,</p>
<p>improve sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>divorced from the conversation about psychedelics.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that the scientific community</p>
<p>immediately embraced the conversation about meditation.</p>
<p>In fact, it took quite a long while</p>
<p>for schools like Harvard and Stanford</p>
<p>and other universities around the world</p>
<p>to start embracing and funding studies of meditation,</p>
<p>asking what sorts of brain areas are involved,</p>
<p>how it changes the body,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>how a meditation practice can shift the brain and body</p>
<p>when somebody is finished meditating</p>
<p>and is off in their life doing their everyday things.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, and especially within the 1990s,</p>
<p>the advent of brain imaging technology</p>
<p>like magnetic resonance imaging, MRI,</p>
<p>or functional magnetic resonance imaging</p>
<p>was a way to look at the brain while it was active,</p>
<p>not just to get an image of its structure,</p>
<p>but also how it&rsquo;s functioning,</p>
<p>the areas that so-called light up.</p>
<p>When all of that technology became accessible and popular,</p>
<p>well, that allowed a large number of laboratories</p>
<p>to start asking how specific patterns</p>
<p>of thinking and breathing,</p>
<p>maybe people sitting in the lotus position,</p>
<p>but more often than that,</p>
<p>it would be people inside of an MRI magnet,</p>
<p>because it is a magnet,</p>
<p>so it would put you into a little tube</p>
<p>and push you into the tube,</p>
<p>not against your will, of course,</p>
<p>but put people into the tube,</p>
<p>have them meditate,</p>
<p>and then look at how the brain changed</p>
<p>and to do that over time.</p>
<p>When those studies were done,</p>
<p>what was discovered was really quite miraculous, really.</p>
<p>And now we don&rsquo;t think of it as surprising,</p>
<p>but what was discovered</p>
<p>was a huge laundry list of brain changes.</p>
<p>And then when people were evaluated in their outside life,</p>
<p>so when they would fill out reports</p>
<p>of their subjective feelings of happiness,</p>
<p>or they would report their sleep,</p>
<p>or even if objective measures were taken,</p>
<p>changes in hormones or markers of inflammation, et cetera,</p>
<p>a large list of information fell out of that,</p>
<p>which revealed that indeed there are many,</p>
<p>a dozen or more clear benefits</p>
<p>of a regular meditation practice.</p>
<p>And some of those meditation practices could be quite short.</p>
<p>So nowadays we think of meditation</p>
<p>as pretty commonly accepted.</p>
<p>And in fact, that has a lot to do with the fact</p>
<p>that many of the major tech companies</p>
<p>in the Bay Area during the 2000s,</p>
<p>such as Google and Apple</p>
<p>and any number of different social media companies</p>
<p>and other companies and business ventures, et cetera,</p>
<p>investment firms all over the world</p>
<p>started hiring people to train meditation</p>
<p>or had online courses for meditation.</p>
<p>So nowadays we think of meditation as this thing</p>
<p>that almost everybody understands can benefit us,</p>
<p>but we now sit at an interesting frontier</p>
<p>where most people think of meditation as one thing,</p>
<p>sort of like the word exercise,</p>
<p>which of course could mean weight training,</p>
<p>it could mean running,</p>
<p>it could mean high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>all of which, as you know,</p>
<p>will get you different results depending on what you do,</p>
<p>how often you do it,</p>
<p>and the specifics of what you actually do.</p>
<p>So too, meditation can give you very specific results.</p>
<p>It can give you more focus.</p>
<p>It can give you better sleep.</p>
<p>It can give you a combination of results,</p>
<p>just like exercise can, depending on the exercise.</p>
<p>So what we are going to talk about next</p>
<p>is the specific changes that happen in the brain</p>
<p>with specific aspects of meditation.</p>
<p>That is, what happens when you close your eyes?</p>
<p>What happens when you focus your attention inward</p>
<p>versus focusing your attention outward?</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s third eye meditation where you close your eyes</p>
<p>and focus on that spot just behind your forehead</p>
<p>and you focus on your breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also meditation practices</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re focusing on what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>with a lot of so-called mindfulness,</p>
<p>being very present to whatever&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>not letting your mind wander</p>
<p>or think about yesterday or tomorrow,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening next,</p>
<p>but really focusing on the present.</p>
<p>There are also meditation practices, of course,</p>
<p>where you are in a format of interpersonal communication,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really listening very intensely.</p>
<p>That too is a form of mindfulness.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to parse each of these things</p>
<p>and we are going to ask what&rsquo;s happening in the brain</p>
<p>and body during each of these meditation practices</p>
<p>so that you can develop specific meditation practices</p>
<p>that you can invoke in your real life on a daily basis,</p>
<p>or thankfully, I would say for some who are pretty busy,</p>
<p>that you could even do once a week or even once a month</p>
<p>that will still clearly benefit you in specific ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend the next 10 minutes or so</p>
<p>talking about the neuroscience of meditation.</p>
<p>I promise you, I&rsquo;m not going to just list off</p>
<p>a bunch of different brain areas</p>
<p>that are active during meditation.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be useful to you.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t believe in throwing out</p>
<p>a lot of nomenclature</p>
<p>without also giving some mechanistic explanation</p>
<p>as to what different brain areas do.</p>
<p>And you could say, well, what good is it</p>
<p>knowing what different brain areas do and their names</p>
<p>if I can&rsquo;t actually manipulate those brain areas?</p>
<p>But the good news is you actually can manipulate</p>
<p>those brain areas.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ll tell you today,</p>
<p>you can turn up the activity in certain brain areas</p>
<p>and turn down the activity in specific brain areas</p>
<p>with specific elements of a meditation practice.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s quite exciting and quite different really</p>
<p>from other aspects of neuroscience</p>
<p>that we might discuss on this podcast.</p>
<p>So there are a few different brain areas</p>
<p>whose names I&rsquo;d like to arm you with.</p>
<p>And again, the names themselves aren&rsquo;t essential,</p>
<p>but if you can grasp even the top contour</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be in a much better position to parse</p>
<p>and use the information that follows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an area of your brain</p>
<p>that sits right behind your forehead</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s the front bumper of your head</p>
<p>just behind the bone, okay?</p>
<p>That area just behind your forehead</p>
<p>that we call the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>actually encompasses a lot of different things.</p>
<p>And actually you have two of them.</p>
<p>You have one on the right side of your brain</p>
<p>and you have one on the left side of your brain</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re connected to one another,</p>
<p>but they actually do different things.</p>
<p>The area that I&rsquo;d like to focus on today for a bit</p>
<p>is the so-called left prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Or if we were going to get really specific,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d say the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side.</p>
<p>So if you want to touch the left side of your head</p>
<p>and move your hand just toward the midline,</p>
<p>toward the sort of top of your head a little bit,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s dorsal, and then lateral.</p>
<p>As long as your hand is still on the side of your head,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, okay?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got your hand probably right over</p>
<p>your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>That area of the brain we know from lesion studies</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been damaged in animals or humans,</p>
<p>and we know from stimulation studies</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been selectively stimulated in animals,</p>
<p>or yes, indeed, also it&rsquo;s been done in humans,</p>
<p>has an incredible ability to control your bodily senses</p>
<p>and to make sense, that is to interpret what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in terms of your emotions and your bodily sensations.</p>
<p>So from now on, unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>if I say prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m specifically referring</p>
<p>to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to shorten that up</p>
<p>just for sake of simplicity and ease of communication.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to talk about another area</p>
<p>of prefrontal cortex, I&rsquo;ll talk about another area.</p>
<p>But if I say prefrontal cortex today,</p>
<p>what I mean is left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>or I should say more appropriately,</p>
<p>when your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is active,</p>
<p>you are in a great position to interpret</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with you emotionally,</p>
<p>to interpret your bodily signals of comfort or discomfort,</p>
<p>and then to make really good decisions</p>
<p>on the basis of that interpretation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is in direct communication with,</p>
<p>and is directly connected to another brain area</p>
<p>called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m just going to refer to it as the ACC, okay?</p>
<p>The ACC is an area of your brain</p>
<p>that is interpreting a lot of different things</p>
<p>about bodily signals.</p>
<p>For instance, how fast you&rsquo;re breathing,</p>
<p>whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly,</p>
<p>and more importantly,</p>
<p>whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly</p>
<p>for the circumstance that you are in.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re running up a hill</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re even in great shape</p>
<p>and your heart is beating very fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely that you are going to be concerned</p>
<p>about your heart beating fast</p>
<p>because that is appropriate for the circumstance.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re just walking along</p>
<p>and all of a sudden your heart starts beating very quickly</p>
<p>for no apparent reason,</p>
<p>well, then you are going to interpret that</p>
<p>as either pathologic or uncomfortable,</p>
<p>inappropriate for the context that you happen to be in.</p>
<p>The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is the area of the brain that actually has some control over</p>
<p>and especially can interpret</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in this ACC region.</p>
<p>Now, most of you probably haven&rsquo;t heard of the ACC.</p>
<p>Most of you probably have heard of a brain area</p>
<p>called the amygdala.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an almond-shaped structure</p>
<p>on the two sides of the brain.</p>
<p>People talk about it as the fear center, et cetera.</p>
<p>But your ACC, the inter-cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>gets input from areas like the amygdala,</p>
<p>your threat detection centers,</p>
<p>but it also gets input from an enormous number</p>
<p>of other areas of your brain and body,</p>
<p>including your heart, your gut.</p>
<p>So it gets information about how full that is distended</p>
<p>or how empty your gut is.</p>
<p>It gets information about how quickly you&rsquo;re breathing</p>
<p>from input from your lungs and related structures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely critical station</p>
<p>for making sense of what&rsquo;s going on in your body.</p>
<p>And it works very closely along with one other structure.</p>
<p>And I promise it&rsquo;s going to be the third structure</p>
<p>in this triad, and then I&rsquo;ll stop listing off names.</p>
<p>So we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Think of that as sort of the interpreter</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on inside of you.</p>
<p>You have the ACC or anterior cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>which is the area of your brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bringing in all this information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on inside your body</p>
<p>and even on the surface of your body.</p>
<p>If you have any pain or an itch or a mosquito bite</p>
<p>on the surface of your body,</p>
<p>your ACC would definitely register that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other</p>
<p>absolutely incredible brain structure,</p>
<p>which is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula.</p>
<p>And the insula has a bunch of different parts to it,</p>
<p>but the insula is another area that is interpreting signals</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in your brain and body.</p>
<p>So the ACC and the insula are working together</p>
<p>to try and figure out what&rsquo;s going on inside me.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>the insula is interpreting information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on outside of you.</p>
<p>So your insula is saying, for instance,</p>
<p>hey, this is a steep hill that I&rsquo;m running up.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>whatever heart rate increase that I&rsquo;m experiencing</p>
<p>or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs,</p>
<p>this all makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be worried.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be scared.</p>
<p>I might want to slow down, but this makes sense.</p>
<p>Whereas it, for instance,</p>
<p>in the example I previously gave,</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re sitting in a room</p>
<p>and everything is pretty calm,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you start feeling really uncomfortable,</p>
<p>like your stomach doesn&rsquo;t feel right,</p>
<p>or you start breathing quickly,</p>
<p>or you start having a so-called anxiety or panic attack,</p>
<p>in large part, that&rsquo;s because the shift</p>
<p>in your bodily sensations doesn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t correspond to something in the outside world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this incredible triad,</p>
<p>which includes the left orsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>the cingulate or anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula.</p>
<p>And those three are working together</p>
<p>in a kind of conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neural conversation,</p>
<p>but a conversation nonetheless,</p>
<p>trying to figure out, okay, what&rsquo;s going on inside me?</p>
<p>How do I feel?</p>
<p>What am I thinking about?</p>
<p>And this could be thoughts about the past</p>
<p>or the future or the present.</p>
<p>They are also in a conversation</p>
<p>as to whether or not the sensations that you&rsquo;re experiencing,</p>
<p>meaning how quick your breathing is</p>
<p>or how slow your breathing is,</p>
<p>how your heart feels, how your skin feels,</p>
<p>any sensations of pain or pleasure for that matter,</p>
<p>whether or not that makes sense for the situation you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and trying to determine whether or not</p>
<p>you are doing the right things</p>
<p>as a consequence of those sensations, okay?</p>
<p>So again, if you can&rsquo;t remember the names</p>
<p>of these different neural structures in the brain,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not that critical.</p>
<p>What is critical is that you understand</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a conversation that&rsquo;s constantly occurring</p>
<p>as long as you are awake,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what&rsquo;s going on inside of you</p>
<p>and whether or not it makes sense</p>
<p>relative to what&rsquo;s going on outside and around you.</p>
<p>Now, humans are smart.</p>
<p>That is, we are, to some extent,</p>
<p>conscious of the fact that we have memories of the past,</p>
<p>awareness of the present, and anticipation of the future.</p>
<p>So we do realize, for instance,</p>
<p>that we can be seated at the dinner table, excuse me,</p>
<p>and have a thought about something tomorrow,</p>
<p>maybe an exam that&rsquo;s stressing us out</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>and that will change our bodily state</p>
<p>in a way that is not optimal</p>
<p>for what we&rsquo;re doing in the moment,</p>
<p>but that can still make sense to us</p>
<p>because that exam is important.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re feeling some pressure</p>
<p>about a hard conversation we have to have,</p>
<p>or maybe we are very excited about the next day</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t eat because we&rsquo;re so excited,</p>
<p>and that can make perfect sense to us</p>
<p>because we do have access to this knowledge about self</p>
<p>that we can think about the past,</p>
<p>the present, or the future.</p>
<p>So that makes the conversation</p>
<p>these three structures are in</p>
<p>even more interesting and dynamic,</p>
<p>because what it means is that we can be doing something,</p>
<p>eating, talking, running,</p>
<p>any number of different activities,</p>
<p>and our bodily state may or may not match</p>
<p>what we are doing in a way that&rsquo;s adaptive for that,</p>
<p>and yet that can be completely okay</p>
<p>or at least understandable for us.</p>
<p>Now, a major emphasis of a meditation practice</p>
<p>is to make us so-called more mindful.</p>
<p>What is mindfulness?</p>
<p>Well, again, there isn&rsquo;t one perfect,</p>
<p>universally accepted operational definition of mindfulness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically nerd speak for saying</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t agree exactly what mindfulness should be,</p>
<p>is, and means for everyone,</p>
<p>but most people assume, and I think agree,</p>
<p>that mindfulness includes something about being present,</p>
<p>and when I say present,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean present to one&rsquo;s surroundings</p>
<p>because, of course, a lot of meditation practices</p>
<p>that are designed to make us more mindful and present</p>
<p>are designed to make us more mindful and present</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s happening internally</p>
<p>while ignoring everything that&rsquo;s happening externally,</p>
<p>but they are designed to make us more present</p>
<p>to our bodily sensations,</p>
<p>and in particular, our breathing</p>
<p>and our thoughts in the moment.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s now explore</p>
<p>what a generic meditation practice looks like,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s evaluate how that tends to change the activity</p>
<p>of these neural circuits in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and then from there,</p>
<p>we can split the conversation into a couple different bins.</p>
<p>That is meditation practices</p>
<p>that are ideal for enhancing focus,</p>
<p>meditation practices that are ideal for improving mood,</p>
<p>meditation practices that are ideal for improving sleep,</p>
<p>and meditation practices that, believe it or not,</p>
<p>benefit all of those things in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Okay, so what happens during a meditation practice</p>
<p>at the neural level?</p>
<p>In order to answer that question,</p>
<p>we are going to be scientists.</p>
<p>That means you and I are going to be scientists now.</p>
<p>We are going to break down a practice</p>
<p>into its different component parts</p>
<p>and address what we know for sure</p>
<p>about the brain activation states</p>
<p>that occur with those different component parts.</p>
<p>In order to do that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s use a somewhat generic form of meditation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s generic and pretty far-reaching</p>
<p>because I would say that for most people,</p>
<p>about 75%, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>a meditation practice is going to involve stopping,</p>
<p>meaning getting out of motion,</p>
<p>sitting or lying down,</p>
<p>and in most cases, closing one&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>although it is absolutely not required</p>
<p>to close one&rsquo;s eyes during meditation.</p>
<p>There are many forms of meditation that are done eyes open,</p>
<p>but for most people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to involve stopping our movement,</p>
<p>that is not ambulating, not walking or running,</p>
<p>so seated or lying down with eyes closed.</p>
<p>When we do that,</p>
<p>meaning when we sit or lie down and close our eyes,</p>
<p>as trivial as that shift might sound to you,</p>
<p>it actually is a profound shift</p>
<p>in the way that your brain</p>
<p>and other neural circuits in your body function</p>
<p>for the following reason.</p>
<p>When we close our eyes,</p>
<p>we shut down a major avenue of what&rsquo;s called exteroception.</p>
<p>What do I mean by exteroception?</p>
<p>Well, very briefly,</p>
<p>we are sensing things on our body</p>
<p>and in our body all the time.</p>
<p>We are also sensing things from outside of us all the time,</p>
<p>so these could be sights or sounds, touch on our body,</p>
<p>sensations with inside our body, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, sensation is distinct from what we call perception.</p>
<p>Perception is, put simply,</p>
<p>the sensations that we happen to be paying attention to.</p>
<p>So at any given moment,</p>
<p>you are sensing many, many things.</p>
<p>There are sound waves hitting your ears,</p>
<p>there are pressure receptors on the bottoms of your feet</p>
<p>sensing your shoes or your sandals or the floor, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not perceiving them</p>
<p>until you place your attention on them.</p>
<p>Now, the way perception works</p>
<p>is that you have so-called spotlights of attention.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t perceive everything all at once,</p>
<p>every sound, every sight, every touch.</p>
<p>That would be overwhelming.</p>
<p>In fact, that would be terrible.</p>
<p>Rather, you have spotlights of perception</p>
<p>that can either be very narrow.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>you could focus all of your perception right now</p>
<p>on your big toe of your right foot</p>
<p>and really pour all of your awareness, your attention,</p>
<p>into what you&rsquo;re perceiving there, what it feels like,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s tingling or pressure, heat or cold, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or you can broaden that spotlight to include both feet</p>
<p>or all your toes on both feet,</p>
<p>and then your legs and your whole body or the entire room.</p>
<p>Perception is like a spotlight, and I should mention,</p>
<p>there are very good data that we can split our attention</p>
<p>into two, but probably not more than two spotlights.</p>
<p>And we can make those spotlights of perception</p>
<p>either very broad and diffuse or very narrow.</p>
<p>You can practice this now if you like.</p>
<p>You can pick a spot on the wall away from you anywhere,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re driving, you can look at some location,</p>
<p>and you can focus intensely on one small location.</p>
<p>For instance, a tree in the horizon</p>
<p>or a person on the street</p>
<p>or any number of different things outside of you.</p>
<p>Or you can broaden that spotlight</p>
<p>to include the entire scene at once.</p>
<p>You can also focus a spotlight of perception on your body,</p>
<p>say on the left upper portion of your chest.</p>
<p>And of course, you can focus</p>
<p>on the left upper portion of your chest</p>
<p>and something outside of you can split your attention</p>
<p>between those two perceptual spotlights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard, although not impossible</p>
<p>to have three perceptual spotlights,</p>
<p>but most people can split to two points of attention</p>
<p>or perception pretty easily.</p>
<p>The other thing that most people can do pretty easily</p>
<p>is merge those two spotlights</p>
<p>or rather to have just one spotlight of attention.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t always have</p>
<p>to have two spotlights of attention on,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m using the word attention</p>
<p>and perception interchangeably.</p>
<p>But you could, for instance, have two points of attention.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking to somebody and you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to whether or not somebody&rsquo;s walking in the door or not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>Or you could be completely focused</p>
<p>on the person you&rsquo;re talking to,</p>
<p>or you could be completely focused on the stomach ache</p>
<p>or the great sensation of hunger that you have in your belly</p>
<p>while talking to somebody.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re not even listening</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re saying at all.</p>
<p>So you have two spotlights of perception.</p>
<p>You can split them or merge them into one.</p>
<p>And this is very important.</p>
<p>Those spotlights of perception can intensify or dim.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m using analogy.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is your perception</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening within those spotlights</p>
<p>can be very, very high acuity.</p>
<p>That is, you can register very fine changes in detail,</p>
<p>like tingling on one side of your big toe</p>
<p>of your right foot versus the other,</p>
<p>or it can be somewhat more diffuse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just thinking about your whole toe,</p>
<p>which in that case seems like a small area.</p>
<p>But the point is that you can consciously adjust the acuity</p>
<p>that is the fineness of your perception.</p>
<p>All of this is under your power</p>
<p>because of the incredible ability of a brain structure</p>
<p>whose name you now understand and know,</p>
<p>which is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Although there are other areas of your brain</p>
<p>involved as well.</p>
<p>Your ability to direct your attention</p>
<p>to specific things in your environment or within your body</p>
<p>or to split those points of attention or merge them</p>
<p>or dial up the intensity</p>
<p>of how closely you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to every little shift or ripple and change in sensation there</p>
<p>or to kind of dissociate, if you will,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>to disengage from that perception.</p>
<p>All of that is under control because of your ability</p>
<p>to engage this area that we call the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and in particular,</p>
<p>the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Okay, so now if we look at the example of what happens</p>
<p>when you sit or lie down and close your eyes</p>
<p>and decide to meditate,</p>
<p>you should immediately realize</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a tremendous shift in your perceptual ability.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that spotlight of attention,</p>
<p>while it can be oriented toward, for instance,</p>
<p>what you hear in the room,</p>
<p>or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees</p>
<p>in the environment that you happen to be in,</p>
<p>when we close our eyes,</p>
<p>we shut down one of the major avenues for sensory input,</p>
<p>which is vision.</p>
<p>And when we do that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for those perceptual spotlights</p>
<p>to be focused more so on what happens</p>
<p>at the level of the surface of our skin</p>
<p>and inside of our bodies.</p>
<p>And that informs us about something very important,</p>
<p>which is that there are actually two axes</p>
<p>or two ends of a continuum of perception.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about perception</p>
<p>and intention as kind of the same thing,</p>
<p>and indeed they are,</p>
<p>at least for sake of this conversation.</p>
<p>But within that word perception,</p>
<p>or within that word attention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a continuum.</p>
<p>And that continuum has on one end</p>
<p>something called interoception.</p>
<p>Interoception, spelled with an I,</p>
<p>is everything that we sense</p>
<p>at the level of our skin and inward.</p>
<p>So the sensation inside our stomach,</p>
<p>the sensation of our heart beating.</p>
<p>Some people can sense their heart beating pretty easily.</p>
<p>Other people have more challenge doing that.</p>
<p>What we are feeling on the surface of our skin,</p>
<p>how hot or cold we feel, that&rsquo;s interoception.</p>
<p>In contrast, at the other end of the continuum</p>
<p>is so-called exteroception, spelled with an E.</p>
<p>Exteroception is perception of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside or beyond the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>So by shutting our eyes,</p>
<p>and in particular in a meditative practice</p>
<p>where we direct our attention</p>
<p>toward our so-called third eye center,</p>
<p>this area right behind our forehead,</p>
<p>which not so incidentally is the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>or in some cases where people will focus on their breathing,</p>
<p>so the movement of their stomach</p>
<p>or the movement of their diaphragm</p>
<p>or the lifting of their chest</p>
<p>or the extension of their belly while they breathe.</p>
<p>By doing that,</p>
<p>we are taking what ordinarily is a perceptual state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s split between the outside world, exteroception,</p>
<p>and usually also toward our inner state.</p>
<p>You know, most people are generally in touch</p>
<p>with how they are feeling from the skin inward</p>
<p>while they are also paying attention</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s outside of them.</p>
<p>You can think about somebody, for instance,</p>
<p>at a restaurant or sandwich shop about to order a sandwich</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re reading the menu, so that&rsquo;s exteroception, right?</p>
<p>The menu is outside the confines of your skin.</p>
<p>And little ideas or maybe big ideas come to mind</p>
<p>about what the roast beef sandwich</p>
<p>or the vegetarian sandwich will taste like,</p>
<p>what it will do for you, what&rsquo;s in it,</p>
<p>what you like, what you don&rsquo;t like, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s splitting interoception and exteroception.</p>
<p>But when we close our eyes, we stop, we slow down,</p>
<p>we focus on our breathing or that third eye center,</p>
<p>the majority of our perception then shifts to interoception.</p>
<p>And when we shift down to that end</p>
<p>of the continuum of interoception,</p>
<p>something very important happens.</p>
<p>What happens is that those two regions, the ACC,</p>
<p>the anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula</p>
<p>really ramp up their levels of neural activity.</p>
<p>And that should make perfect sense to you</p>
<p>because those are areas of your brain</p>
<p>that are registering and paying attention</p>
<p>to the various sensations of how full</p>
<p>or empty your stomach feels,</p>
<p>whether or not the surface of your skin feels hot or cold</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>So by just sitting down or lying down and closing your eyes,</p>
<p>your brain undergoes a massive shift</p>
<p>from exteroception to interoception.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t be distracted</p>
<p>by external events, and in fact, many people are,</p>
<p>but the early stages of transitioning</p>
<p>into a meditative state involve this shift</p>
<p>down the continuum, or I should say,</p>
<p>to one end of the continuum, because there&rsquo;s no down up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just the continuum.</p>
<p>Shift along the continuum</p>
<p>to heightened levels of interoception.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned this briefly before,</p>
<p>but many people are very interoceptively aware,</p>
<p>just naturally, even if they don&rsquo;t do a meditation practice.</p>
<p>Other people are not.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a pretty good measure of whether or not</p>
<p>you have high levels of interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>or capability, and that is your ability</p>
<p>to count your heartbeats without placing your fingers</p>
<p>anywhere with any pressure to take your pulse.</p>
<p>You can do this if you like,</p>
<p>you can actually try and estimate your number of heartbeats</p>
<p>simply by trying to feel your heartbeat.</p>
<p>Some people are very good,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re very accurate at doing this.</p>
<p>Other people are not.</p>
<p>It does seem to be an ability</p>
<p>that can be trained up quite a bit,</p>
<p>and in fact, meditative practices will improve</p>
<p>your interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>but, and this is a very important point,</p>
<p>heightened levels of interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>while that might sound attractive,</p>
<p>oh, but to be really in touch with your body,</p>
<p>that is not always beneficial.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because many people who, for instance,</p>
<p>have excessive levels of anxiety</p>
<p>have excessive levels of anxiety</p>
<p>because they are very keenly aware</p>
<p>of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing</p>
<p>or change in the sensations within their stomach,</p>
<p>whereas other people who are less aware</p>
<p>of their bodily state, that can be beneficial, right?</p>
<p>It can be adaptive or not, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not adaptive to be very, very aware</p>
<p>of your internal state.</p>
<p>If, for instance, you&rsquo;re doing public speaking,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be thinking about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in your stomach or how quickly you&rsquo;re breathing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly trying to ignore all those signals,</p>
<p>those sensations now, but for somebody who has no awareness</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on, very little interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>that can be problematic too,</p>
<p>because these are the very people who can ignore the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re having a heart attack</p>
<p>or can ignore the fact that they have high blood pressure</p>
<p>and are caring about life, focused on everything external</p>
<p>with no awareness of their own body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re quote-unquote out of touch with their body.</p>
<p>So we want to be very careful about placing valence,</p>
<p>which is a sort of value of good or bad</p>
<p>on interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness.</p>
<p>More importantly, we want to emphasize</p>
<p>that when you undergo a meditation practice,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s of the sort where you stop your movement</p>
<p>and close your eyes,</p>
<p>you are training for interoceptive awareness.</p>
<p>This becomes important later.</p>
<p>We get into discussions about meditation</p>
<p>for reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>Some people may opt.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say some people ought to opt</p>
<p>for a meditative practice,</p>
<p>which involves more exteroceptive awareness,</p>
<p>actually a meditation like a walking meditation</p>
<p>or even a seated meditation</p>
<p>where they are bringing their focus</p>
<p>to a place outside their body</p>
<p>as opposed to inside their body.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are examples of people</p>
<p>who have meditated quite a lot</p>
<p>who develop such a heightened state or awareness</p>
<p>of their interoceptive components.</p>
<p>That is just fancy, again, nerd speak</p>
<p>for so aware of their breathing and of their heart</p>
<p>and of the state of their gut</p>
<p>that it actually is intrusive for daily activities.</p>
<p>So I will ask you to ask this question of yourself now.</p>
<p>Are you somebody who tends to be very in touch</p>
<p>with your bodily sensations?</p>
<p>So for instance, from the skin inwards,</p>
<p>or are you somebody who tends to be less in touch with</p>
<p>or aware of your interoceptive state?</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get an A or an F or a D or a C</p>
<p>depending on your answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a good question</p>
<p>for each and every one of us to answer.</p>
<p>And I think most people will answer that it depends.</p>
<p>It depends on whether or not you are in a social setting</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re alone,</p>
<p>but we are going to return to that answer.</p>
<p>So keep it in mind because it will become very beneficial</p>
<p>in building an optimal meditation practice for you.</p>
<p>But for now, just know there&rsquo;s this continuum of perception,</p>
<p>interoception and exteroception.</p>
<p>Closing your eyes increases interoception.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes dramatically increases exteroception,</p>
<p>just automatically, just automatically</p>
<p>because so much of your brain,</p>
<p>in fact, 40% or more is dedicated to vision.</p>
<p>And this, I should say, for those of you</p>
<p>that are low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>and those of you that are blind or have poor vision,</p>
<p>this entire process is translated to the auditory,</p>
<p>to the sound domain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s true for people that can see</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true for people that can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Of course, people that can&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>closing the eyes doesn&rsquo;t have this huge shift</p>
<p>towards interoception, but there have been a few studies,</p>
<p>not as many as I would have liked to find,</p>
<p>but a few studies of, for instance,</p>
<p>people who are blind or have low vision,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see very well.</p>
<p>And when they close their ears</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t hear the external world</p>
<p>or they put headphones on or noise canceling headphones,</p>
<p>then the world inside of them becomes very prominent</p>
<p>relative to the world outside of them for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>So I asked you to ask yourself</p>
<p>whether or not you are somebody</p>
<p>who tends to be more interoceptively aware or not,</p>
<p>more exteroceptively aware or not.</p>
<p>And some of you might not be able to answer that question.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t, chances are</p>
<p>that you are effectively sliding along that continuum,</p>
<p>depending on the activities that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re probably the kind of person</p>
<p>where if somebody comes over to you</p>
<p>and starts talking to you,</p>
<p>you will engage in that conversation</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel so inside your body</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about your heart beating</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re flushing red, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to pay attention to what they say.</p>
<p>Many people, however, when somebody talks to them,</p>
<p>if they have social anxiety</p>
<p>or even a slight bit of social anxiety,</p>
<p>will be thinking about</p>
<p>whether or not their cheeks are flushing</p>
<p>or whether or not they look right or sound right</p>
<p>or whether or not they have something in their teeth.</p>
<p>These are normal responses,</p>
<p>but they really speak to this issue</p>
<p>of whether or not you tend to shift</p>
<p>more towards interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>or exteroceptive awareness.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s context dependent.</p>
<p>It will depend on whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out on a date with somebody</p>
<p>that you would loathe to find out later</p>
<p>that you had food in your teeth</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re with somebody</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more familiar with</p>
<p>where that would not really matter much</p>
<p>or the other person would tell you this kind of thing.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be at one location</p>
<p>or another location along this continuum</p>
<p>of interoception or exteroception?</p>
<p>Well, we know what it means neurally, right?</p>
<p>We know that if you are more interoceptively aware,</p>
<p>your insulin, ACC are active, but that&rsquo;s not very useful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not helpful as a tool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>Now, there have actually been studies</p>
<p>of what a meditation practice can do</p>
<p>in terms of moving you along this continuum</p>
<p>from where you naturally sit</p>
<p>in order to help you function,</p>
<p>not just during the meditation, but at all times.</p>
<p>And in order to illustrate this,</p>
<p>I want to start with a description</p>
<p>of what is now a classic study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very cool study, has a very cool name.</p>
<p>It talks about something very important</p>
<p>that will come up again and again in today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something called the default mode network.</p>
<p>The default mode network</p>
<p>is a collection of different brain areas</p>
<p>that essentially are active</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not doing much of anything.</p>
<p>And certainly is active when we are not focused</p>
<p>on one particular task or conversation or activity.</p>
<p>The default mode network can be thought of</p>
<p>more or less as the network that generates mind wandering</p>
<p>or our thoughts drifting from the past</p>
<p>to the present, to the future.</p>
<p>Remember earlier, I talked about</p>
<p>how your perceptual spotlight</p>
<p>can either be two spotlights or they can merge.</p>
<p>Well, similarly, human beings can think about the past,</p>
<p>surely, the present, definitely, and the future.</p>
<p>And it turns out we can also split our thoughts</p>
<p>just like we can split our perception</p>
<p>into two of those three things.</p>
<p>So I can think about the past, a past event,</p>
<p>and I can think about the present.</p>
<p>I can split my thinking and my memory in that way.</p>
<p>I can also think about the present and the future.</p>
<p>I can also think about the future and the past,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s very difficult, although not impossible,</p>
<p>to split one&rsquo;s thinking and memory into the past,</p>
<p>the present, and future simultaneously.</p>
<p>Not easily done, but pretty easy</p>
<p>to split one&rsquo;s attention and thinking</p>
<p>into two of those three things,</p>
<p>either the past, the present, and the future,</p>
<p>or any two of those three things, okay?</p>
<p>Just like with attentional spotlighting,</p>
<p>you can place your mind, your thinking, and your memory,</p>
<p>your cognition onto one of those things</p>
<p>and be very, very present,</p>
<p>or the past and the present, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The default mode network,</p>
<p>while it involves a lot of different brain areas,</p>
<p>can be thought of simply as the network of brain areas</p>
<p>that are active when your mind is wandering</p>
<p>between these different time domains.</p>
<p>And the paper I&rsquo;d like to share with you,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, is now a classic paper,</p>
<p>has a wonderful title, which is</p>
<p>A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind.</p>
<p>Now, that sounds almost like a news article</p>
<p>or a news article about a scientific paper,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually the title of the scientific paper,</p>
<p>which was published in the journal Science,</p>
<p>which is one of the three apex journals.</p>
<p>Scientific publishing is competitive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s especially competitive</p>
<p>to get manuscripts accepted into science,</p>
<p>into nature, and into the journal Cell.</p>
<p>So it represents kind of the,</p>
<p>one of the kind of Super Bowl, NBA championships,</p>
<p>and Stanley Cup, if you will,</p>
<p>for you sports aficionados of scientific publishing.</p>
<p>This is a paper from Matthew Killingsworth</p>
<p>and Dan Gilbert.</p>
<p>It was published in 2010,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still considered a classic.</p>
<p>And this paper, A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind,</p>
<p>has a number of very important points.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to paraphrase certain elements of it for you,</p>
<p>because they say essentially what I would like you to know</p>
<p>far better than I could say.</p>
<p>So first of all, they start out with a statement,</p>
<p>which I confess I disagree with,</p>
<p>which is unlike other animals,</p>
<p>human beings spend a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p>what is not going on around them.</p>
<p>Contemplating events that happened in the past</p>
<p>might happen in the future or will never happen at all.</p>
<p>I agree with their assertion that human beings do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly my experience.</p>
<p>Although I must say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that other animals don&rsquo;t do it also.</p>
<p>So my apologies, Killingsworth and Gilbert,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be happy to go toe to toe with you on that.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any data that prove one way or the other</p>
<p>what other animals are thinking.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s set aside other animals</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s focus on the human animal.</p>
<p>Now, their point is still a very good one,</p>
<p>which is that humans have this wandering of the mind</p>
<p>that they call stimulus independent thought.</p>
<p>That is, there&rsquo;s nothing happening to create these thoughts</p>
<p>or anything happening in the immediate environment.</p>
<p>These thoughts are just happening on their own internally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the default mode network.</p>
<p>This study was important.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a landmark study</p>
<p>because they did it right about the time</p>
<p>that smartphones became widely available and in use.</p>
<p>So again, 2010.</p>
<p>So they basically pinged people.</p>
<p>They contacted people on their iPhones many times per day.</p>
<p>And they did this for well over 2,200 adults.</p>
<p>They had a mix of male and female people in this study.</p>
<p>The mean age was 34 years,</p>
<p>but there was a mean, of course, mean average,</p>
<p>but there were a range of different ages and so forth.</p>
<p>And at any moment they asked people,</p>
<p>what are you feeling right now?</p>
<p>And they also asked them, what are you doing right now?</p>
<p>So they were looking for the match or mismatch</p>
<p>between what people were doing and what they were feeling.</p>
<p>They were essentially trying to probe</p>
<p>what people were thinking about.</p>
<p>And they also addressed that.</p>
<p>And they came up with a kind of a bubble chart,</p>
<p>if you will, where the bigger the bubble,</p>
<p>the more answers came back about one particular thing.</p>
<p>And they assessed whether or not people were happy</p>
<p>or not in that moment, or sad or not,</p>
<p>whether or not they were focused</p>
<p>on what they were doing or not.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bubbles in this chart,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not going to read them all.</p>
<p>But the important points that came from the data,</p>
<p>and again, there&rsquo;s a very large data set,</p>
<p>was that, and here again, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing.</p>
<p>First, people&rsquo;s minds wandered frequently</p>
<p>regardless of what they were doing.</p>
<p>In nearly half of the samples taken,</p>
<p>people were generally thinking about something else,</p>
<p>except it turns out there&rsquo;s just one little bubble</p>
<p>sitting way far out on the horizon here.</p>
<p>People claimed, and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe them,</p>
<p>that they tend to be very focused on making love</p>
<p>if they weren&rsquo;t making love in the moment</p>
<p>where they were pinged on their iPhone.</p>
<p>Now, why their iPhone was there with them at that moment,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t included in this description of the study.</p>
<p>But all the other activities, grooming and self-care,</p>
<p>listening to the news, watching television,</p>
<p>relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>during all those activities,</p>
<p>people claim that their mind wandered a lot.</p>
<p>And then they also assessed, of course, their mood</p>
<p>and how those people felt at any given moment,</p>
<p>depending on what they were doing</p>
<p>and how well their mind and their emotions</p>
<p>matched what they were doing.</p>
<p>And what they say here is, second,</p>
<p>they revealed that people were less happy</p>
<p>when their minds were wandering than when they were not.</p>
<p>And this was true during all activities.</p>
<p>And then third, what people were thinking at a given moment</p>
<p>was far better a predictor of their happiness</p>
<p>than what they were doing.</p>
<p>So this is interesting,</p>
<p>and I think matches a lot of people&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>In fact, I think as you hear about this study,</p>
<p>many of you will probably just say, well, duh.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re working and you don&rsquo;t like your work</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about something bad that happened,</p>
<p>well, then of course you&rsquo;re not going to be happy.</p>
<p>But the key point of this study is that</p>
<p>it did not necessarily have to be the case</p>
<p>that people were thinking about something unpleasant.</p>
<p>In fact, if people were working</p>
<p>and they were thinking about something else</p>
<p>that was pleasant, that also made them feel unhappy.</p>
<p>In other words, the mismatch between being in an activity</p>
<p>and having our mind elsewhere led people to report themselves</p>
<p>as feeling more unhappy in that moment.</p>
<p>And when you total this up,</p>
<p>what you find is that people are often not present</p>
<p>to what they are doing,</p>
<p>and that is a great source of unhappiness,</p>
<p>even if their thoughts are those of happy, joyful thoughts.</p>
<p>So this is interesting, and I think runs counter</p>
<p>to what most of us have heard or have been taught,</p>
<p>which is think good thoughts,</p>
<p>try and suppress bad thoughts,</p>
<p>have a good internal landscape, create a good narrative.</p>
<p>That is all true.</p>
<p>But equally, if not more important,</p>
<p>is to have the ability to be fully engaged</p>
<p>in what you are doing at a given moment.</p>
<p>That is the strongest predictor of being happy.</p>
<p>And there were several other studies</p>
<p>that followed up on this,</p>
<p>but their conclusion that they put</p>
<p>in the final short paragraph of this paper,</p>
<p>I think really captures it beautifully.</p>
<p>They say, and here I&rsquo;m quoting directly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In conclusion, a human mind is a wandering mind,</p>
<p>and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.</p>
<p>The ability to think about what is not happening</p>
<p>in a moment,&rsquo; I added the in a moment part,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;is a cognitive achievement</p>
<p>that comes at an emotional cost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I know I&rsquo;m not alone in believing that this paper,</p>
<p>a wandering mind is an unhappy mind,</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to this paper</p>
<p>in the show note captions,</p>
<p>is absolutely key in understanding</p>
<p>why a meditation practice is so important.</p>
<p>Because a meditation practice</p>
<p>is really about adjusting your place</p>
<p>along that interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum</p>
<p>to what you happen to be experiencing in that moment.</p>
<p>And while most people think of a meditative practice</p>
<p>as focusing on what&rsquo;s going on internally</p>
<p>with your eyes closed, third eye center,</p>
<p>focusing on your breathing, et cetera,</p>
<p>for any number of minutes, or maybe even an hour or longer,</p>
<p>there are other forms of meditation</p>
<p>in which your exteroception dominates,</p>
<p>in which you are actively focusing on things outside</p>
<p>or beyond the confines of your skin and internal landscape.</p>
<p>And that too is meditation.</p>
<p>And if we are to take the work</p>
<p>of Killingsworth and Gilbert,</p>
<p>this a wandering mind is an unhappy mind,</p>
<p>seriously, and I know a number of other laboratories have</p>
<p>and have supported this research with their findings</p>
<p>again and again and again,</p>
<p>what this means is that meditating</p>
<p>is not necessarily a practice that we do</p>
<p>divorced from the rest of life.</p>
<p>Meditation and mindfulness in particular,</p>
<p>being present to what we are doing in a given moment</p>
<p>is one of the essential keys to happiness</p>
<p>and improved mood, even if what we are doing is unpleasant.</p>
<p>So that brings us to a tool,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a tool that any and all of us can use,</p>
<p>whether or not you tend to be interoceptively dominant,</p>
<p>right, that you tend to pay more attention</p>
<p>to your bodily sensations or exteroceptively dominant.</p>
<p>And again, if you don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a simple test that you can do.</p>
<p>You can just sit down or lie down, close your eyes,</p>
<p>and you can ask yourself or assess</p>
<p>whether or not your attention tends to fleet</p>
<p>to things outside of you, right?</p>
<p>Cars honking or going by, people in the room,</p>
<p>or whether or not you tend to be able to focus</p>
<p>on your internal landscape to the exclusion of exteroception</p>
<p>and attention to things outside the confines</p>
<p>of your skin easily.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this will depend on context and situation,</p>
<p>even how well rested you are, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing you want to do</p>
<p>every time you decide to do a meditation practice.</p>
<p>In fact, I would suggest that you use this</p>
<p>to determine what meditation you do at any given moment.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you are somebody who is a regular meditator,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s never meditated</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to develop a meditation practice.</p>
<p>I suggest that you do a test of whether or not</p>
<p>you are more interoceptively dominant</p>
<p>or exteroceptively dominant in that moment, right?</p>
<p>Again, this is not a personality trait.</p>
<p>This is a question about where you happen to be in a moment.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re on a plane or you&rsquo;re in the car.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the car,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t close your eyes while driving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of obvious,</p>
<p>but do this in a safe way, please.</p>
<p>But stop, close your eyes,</p>
<p>and assess whether or not you can access</p>
<p>and focus your attention primarily on your internal state,</p>
<p>or whether or not your attention and perception</p>
<p>gets pulled to something external, to exteroception.</p>
<p>And again, that will vary</p>
<p>depending on circumstance and who you are.</p>
<p>Then I suggest opening your eyes</p>
<p>and trying to focus your attention</p>
<p>to something external to you,</p>
<p>and seeing or evaluating the extent</p>
<p>to which you can divorce your perception</p>
<p>from sensations that occur at the level of your skin</p>
<p>or internally.</p>
<p>Now, I should say that there&rsquo;s no technology,</p>
<p>at least not that I&rsquo;m aware of,</p>
<p>absence of fMRI machine,</p>
<p>in which case you are inside an fMRI machine</p>
<p>while you do this.</p>
<p>But unless you are in that experiment,</p>
<p>and most of us aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no technology that can tell you,</p>
<p>for instance, whether or not you are</p>
<p>interoceptively dominant or exteroceptively dominant,</p>
<p>and whether or not the ratio is 75 to 25,</p>
<p>or what have you at any given moment.</p>
<p>You have to assess this subjectively.</p>
<p>However, if you sit down, for instance,</p>
<p>and you notice that you can equally split your attention</p>
<p>between internal sensations and external sensations,</p>
<p>or whether or not you find yourself</p>
<p>pulled into external sensations</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to focus inward,</p>
<p>or you find yourself pulled inward</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to focus outward,</p>
<p>well, that will dictate the sort of meditation</p>
<p>that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment.</p>
<p>Let me give an example of how you would do this.</p>
<p>You would stop in some way,</p>
<p>so sit or lie down, close your eyes,</p>
<p>and evaluate whether or not you can essentially</p>
<p>rule out or eliminate attention to all outside events.</p>
<p>Most people won&rsquo;t be able to do that entirely,</p>
<p>but try and focus your attention,</p>
<p>for instance, on your breathing</p>
<p>or the typical third eye center,</p>
<p>focusing at a spot right behind your forehead.</p>
<p>If you feel you can do that reasonably well</p>
<p>to the exclusion of what&rsquo;s happening around you,</p>
<p>well, then an important question arises.</p>
<p>Should you meditate in a way</p>
<p>to enhance that interoceptive awareness?</p>
<p>Or rather, should you meditate in a way,</p>
<p>for instance, with your eyes open</p>
<p>and your attention on a particular portion</p>
<p>of the landscape you&rsquo;re in, like a tree</p>
<p>or maybe even an object or a plant</p>
<p>or something else in your immediate environment,</p>
<p>to try and cultivate or enhance</p>
<p>your exteroceptive awareness?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you, but my bias would be one</p>
<p>in which you work against your default state.</p>
<p>Again, the default mode network is where you land</p>
<p>on this interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum</p>
<p>is going to lead to more mind-wandering,</p>
<p>whereas when you encourage, or we could even say,</p>
<p>force yourself a little bit to anchor your attention</p>
<p>to either inside your body or outside your body,</p>
<p>and you make that decision</p>
<p>according to what you are doing less easily,</p>
<p>well, then you are actively training up the neural circuits.</p>
<p>You are engaging so-called neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>You are deliberately engaging a shift along that continuum.</p>
<p>To make this crystal clear, what I mean is this.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>If I were to sit down and I want to do some meditation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say three minutes of meditation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s good evidence that even three minutes of meditation</p>
<p>can be beneficial for a variety of things,</p>
<p>including enhanced focus and enhanced anxiety management.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I sit down and I notice</p>
<p>that I can really focus inward</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s happening at the level of my skin</p>
<p>and my internal organs, and I can rule out everything.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because the room is quiet,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s just because my brain is in a state</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m particularly good at that at that moment,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s just a natural ability.</p>
<p>Well, then I would opt for a three-minute meditation practice</p>
<p>in which I deliberately exterocept</p>
<p>that I build up the circuitry</p>
<p>to focus on something external to me,</p>
<p>because I want, and I think most people would like,</p>
<p>to have an adaptive mechanism within them</p>
<p>so that they can slide along that continuum,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t default to whatever happens to be easiest</p>
<p>for them in that moment.</p>
<p>Now, if I were to sit down and try and focus</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s going on internally,</p>
<p>and I kept getting distracted by things happening</p>
<p>outside of me, opening my eyes,</p>
<p>or feeling like I need to reach for my phone,</p>
<p>or paying attention to the sounds in the room,</p>
<p>well, then I would actively engage a meditation practice,</p>
<p>in this case, a three-minute example,</p>
<p>but it could be longer,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m deliberately trying to focus my perception</p>
<p>on events at the level of the confines of my skin</p>
<p>and internally.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Well, I love to use the phrase anytime with kids,</p>
<p>when they say, this is really hard,</p>
<p>or something&rsquo;s challenging,</p>
<p>or adults will say, that&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>Well, as my graduate advisor used to say,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>If something were easy,</p>
<p>if you can perform any activity or thought, et cetera,</p>
<p>well, then there is absolutely zero reason</p>
<p>for your neural circuits to change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the friction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the feeling that something is hard,</p>
<p>that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms</p>
<p>at the level of cells, et cetera,</p>
<p>that allow you to potentially change your neural circuitry.</p>
<p>So challenge and discomfort is the signal</p>
<p>to your brain and body that something needs to change.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m encouraging you to embark on meditative practices</p>
<p>that are not your default, okay?</p>
<p>To essentially go against the grain</p>
<p>of where your interoceptive bias</p>
<p>or your extra receptive bias</p>
<p>happens to be at a given moment.</p>
<p>And again, this will change for some of you,</p>
<p>this will change across the day,</p>
<p>where early in the day,</p>
<p>you are very, very good</p>
<p>at doing an interoceptive biased meditation,</p>
<p>and later in the day, you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I actually believe based on the data that I&rsquo;ve covered,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get into a few more papers about this,</p>
<p>and my lab is actively working on this as well,</p>
<p>that a meditative practice can be made far more effective.</p>
<p>That is, it can invoke more neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>more shift in brain states and brain circuitry</p>
<p>if we do not take the easy path.</p>
<p>That is, we go against the grain</p>
<p>of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a crowded airport</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re finding that everything&rsquo;s very distracting,</p>
<p>well then, that would be a great time</p>
<p>to do some interoceptive focused meditation.</p>
<p>Whereas if you are really in your head,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looping thoughts about the past and present,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re even in obsessive thought,</p>
<p>well, that would be a terrific time,</p>
<p>an ideal time really,</p>
<p>to do a short meditation</p>
<p>focused on something external to you.</p>
<p>In both cases, whether or not you&rsquo;re focused</p>
<p>on interoceptive bias or extra receptive bias,</p>
<p>you are going against,</p>
<p>or I should say you&rsquo;re pushing back</p>
<p>against your default mode network.</p>
<p>I would argue it&rsquo;s going to be far more effective.</p>
<p>That is, you&rsquo;re going to reduce or shift the activity</p>
<p>of that default mode network far more</p>
<p>and in a far more beneficial way</p>
<p>if you actively try and suppress your bias</p>
<p>toward being more interoceptive or extra receptive.</p>
<p>Now, I think that&rsquo;s immensely beneficial</p>
<p>both for the immediate changes that you experience,</p>
<p>what others have called a state change,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And it also can lead to, as we referred to earlier,</p>
<p>more neuroplasticity, more changes in the brain circuits</p>
<p>that underlie your default mode network</p>
<p>and lead to what are called trait changes.</p>
<p>And I want to be very clear</p>
<p>that I am not the first to make this</p>
<p>state versus trait distinction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a distinction that was raised</p>
<p>in a really wonderful book.</p>
<p>In fact, I can&rsquo;t recommend this book highly enough.</p>
<p>The book is Altered Traits,</p>
<p>Science Reveals How Meditation Changes</p>
<p>Your Mind, Brain, and Body.</p>
<p>This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done terrific work in many writings</p>
<p>and many TED Talks, et cetera, about meditation.</p>
<p>I would say that circa 2016, 2017,</p>
<p>this book really captured what I believe to be</p>
<p>the most essential elements of the science of meditation</p>
<p>and a lot of the history of it as well.</p>
<p>Today, we are focusing on much of what&rsquo;s covered</p>
<p>in this book, but also a lot of things</p>
<p>that have happened, excuse me, since 2017.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the papers that I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>are papers that were published after 2017.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s a wonderful book</p>
<p>where they very clearly distinguish</p>
<p>between state changes and trait changes,</p>
<p>trait changes being the more long-lasting ones.</p>
<p>My read of this book and the literature that follows</p>
<p>is, again, that when you sit down to meditate,</p>
<p>it is going to be most effective</p>
<p>to do that interoceptive, exteroceptive bias assessment.</p>
<p>Ask yourself whether or not you are more in your head</p>
<p>or outside your head, if you will,</p>
<p>and then to do a meditation practice</p>
<p>that runs counter to where you happen to be at.</p>
<p>That is, that pushes you more externally</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in your head.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re more focused on what&rsquo;s going on around you,</p>
<p>that pushes you more internally.</p>
<p>Now, I think most people are familiar</p>
<p>with how to do an interoceptive biased meditation.</p>
<p>Again, that would be setting a timer.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t even set a timer.</p>
<p>You just sit or lie down, close your eyes,</p>
<p>focus on that third eye center behind your forehead</p>
<p>or focus on your breathing or your bodily sensations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typical and often discussed.</p>
<p>Exteroceptive based meditations,</p>
<p>you pick a focal point outside</p>
<p>or beyond the confines of your skin.</p>
<p>So that could be, for instance, a point on the wall.</p>
<p>If you are indoors, it could be a plant.</p>
<p>It could be a point on the horizon far away.</p>
<p>What you will find is that your visual system</p>
<p>will fatigue a little bit when you concentrate</p>
<p>your visual focus at that location.</p>
<p>I want to remind you that it is perfectly okay</p>
<p>and in fact, necessary to blink.</p>
<p>So you should blink.</p>
<p>You can relax your face.</p>
<p>You can change your expression.</p>
<p>There is no rule that says that you can&rsquo;t do those things.</p>
<p>This is not just beaming a particular location in space</p>
<p>and holding your eyelids open.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accused many times of not blinking very often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for other reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the way I access memory</p>
<p>about what I want to say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a prompter here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m accessing from a sort of internal image in my head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how my memory works.</p>
<p>But in any case,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to do an exteroceptive biased meditation,</p>
<p>there is absolutely no reason why you wouldn&rsquo;t look away</p>
<p>from that location every once in a while.</p>
<p>In the same way that if you&rsquo;re focused on internal thoughts</p>
<p>with your eyes closed and focused on your breathing,</p>
<p>every once in a while,</p>
<p>your thoughts will skip away from that breathing</p>
<p>or from your third eye center.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is discussed in the book,</p>
<p>Altered Traits, but by many other people as well.</p>
<p>One of the key elements of any meditative practice,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s interoceptively focused</p>
<p>or exteroceptively focused,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s really a refocusing practice.</p>
<p>The more number of times that you have to yank yourself</p>
<p>back into attending or perceiving one specific things.</p>
<p>In other words, the more times your mind wanders</p>
<p>and you bring it back,</p>
<p>actually the more effective that practice is.</p>
<p>Again, if you can just focus on one location</p>
<p>with laser precision and your mind never darts away</p>
<p>from that and you don&rsquo;t have to bring it back,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s no neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Nothing needs to change</p>
<p>because your nervous system will effectively know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s performing perfectly.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who tries to do meditation</p>
<p>and you find that your mind just wanders,</p>
<p>just remember every time you scruff yourself</p>
<p>and pull yourself back to focusing</p>
<p>on some location externally,</p>
<p>or focus back on your breath or your third eye center,</p>
<p>each one of those are just opportunities to do better.</p>
<p>They are essential to the improvement process.</p>
<p>Think about them as ascending a staircase of refocusing.</p>
<p>Every time you refocus, you&rsquo;re going up one more level,</p>
<p>another stair, another stair, another stair.</p>
<p>And I think that will move you away</p>
<p>from the kind of judgmental process of thinking,</p>
<p>oh, like I can&rsquo;t focus on anything.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, what you&rsquo;ll notice is</p>
<p>that the refocusing process will happen so quickly</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even perceive it.</p>
<p>And again, this is something that&rsquo;s born out</p>
<p>in the neuroimaging data.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that they can focus</p>
<p>with laser precision,</p>
<p>but actually what they are better at doing</p>
<p>is refocusing more quickly and consistently over time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a classic study about this</p>
<p>in very experienced meditators that was done in Japan</p>
<p>where they had people</p>
<p>with varying levels of meditation ability.</p>
<p>So some who had never meditated,</p>
<p>others who were really expert meditators</p>
<p>with many hundreds, if not thousands of hours</p>
<p>of meditation under their belt.</p>
<p>And they had those people listen to 20 tones</p>
<p>repeated over and over, the same tone.</p>
<p>And they found that the expert meditators</p>
<p>could really focus, and they did this by brain imaging,</p>
<p>they could really focus on all 20 tones.</p>
<p>Whereas most people kind of attenuate</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s called habituate to the tone</p>
<p>so that by the 10th or 11th tone,</p>
<p>their mind is really going to something else.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>but that really just tells us</p>
<p>that expert meditators have better focus.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the more modern neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>have shown that they don&rsquo;t have better focus</p>
<p>such that they&rsquo;re staying in a very narrow trench of focus.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re exiting focus</p>
<p>and going back in more quickly, more quickly, more quickly</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>So rather than think about your ability to focus,</p>
<p>think about your ability to refocus.</p>
<p>And the more number of times you have to refocus,</p>
<p>the better training you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>So earlier I mentioned doing this interoceptive biased</p>
<p>or exteroceptive biased meditation for three minutes.</p>
<p>Why did I say three minutes?</p>
<p>Well, three minutes seems like a reasonable number</p>
<p>for most people to do consistently, you know, once a day.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are some studies</p>
<p>of one minute meditations and three minute meditations</p>
<p>and 10 and 60.</p>
<p>My laboratory has been studying</p>
<p>a five minute a day meditation</p>
<p>and that clearly has benefits.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also clear that by three minutes,</p>
<p>many of the benefits are starting to arrive.</p>
<p>And so while I&rsquo;m not pointing</p>
<p>at any one particular data point here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that forcing oneself</p>
<p>to direct one&rsquo;s perception, that is your attention</p>
<p>to your internal state or to something external to you</p>
<p>is immensely beneficial if you do it consistently</p>
<p>and is again, especially beneficial</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re focusing your attention</p>
<p>on the portion of your experience,</p>
<p>either internal or external to you</p>
<p>that is not the one that you would default to</p>
<p>in that moment.</p>
<p>And some people have taken this to the extreme</p>
<p>to say that, you know, you can even just move about your day</p>
<p>and then every once in a while,</p>
<p>just do a one breath meditation.</p>
<p>To be honest, when I look at the whole of the data,</p>
<p>it seems as if it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>in order to derive most of the benefits</p>
<p>of a meditation practice.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a big fan of some of the newer meditation apps</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>One in particular that I&rsquo;ve been using</p>
<p>and that actually I started using</p>
<p>because my dad is a big fan of it</p>
<p>and he does now fairly long meditations.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing about 10 or 20 minutes</p>
<p>at least every other day and often every day.</p>
<p>And he convinced me to check out the Waking Up app</p>
<p>that Sam Harris has put out.</p>
<p>I looked at it.</p>
<p>I think some of it sits behind a paywall,</p>
<p>but you can access much of it</p>
<p>or at least do a trial and try it out</p>
<p>without having to get behind that paywall.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a sponsor of this podcast I should mention,</p>
<p>but I decided to use the Waking Up app.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And I think one of the reasons it&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>is that Sam includes short descriptions</p>
<p>of what meditation is doing</p>
<p>and what a specific meditation can do for you</p>
<p>just prior to doing that meditation.</p>
<p>So those meditations can be quite brief.</p>
<p>Some of them are a minute long, two minutes long,</p>
<p>some are longer or even quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>That app I think includes a variety of meditations</p>
<p>that really encompasses the huge range of possibilities</p>
<p>that are possible with meditation.</p>
<p>And that at least by my experience of the Waking Up app</p>
<p>has led to my most consistent meditation practice.</p>
<p>And of course I would love to get Sam</p>
<p>on the podcast as a guest so we could talk</p>
<p>about the sort of underpinnings of the Waking Up app</p>
<p>and his views on everything from meditation</p>
<p>to I know he&rsquo;s big in the discussion</p>
<p>about free will and consciousness,</p>
<p>some of the very deep and somewhat abstract discussions.</p>
<p>Really hope to get Sam on the podcast</p>
<p>at a time not too far from now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&rsquo;ve never met in person,</p>
<p>but I absolutely love the Waking Up app, Sam.</p>
<p>And I know my father does as well.</p>
<p>And I know many of you already use it.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried it already,</p>
<p>I really do encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>I want to talk just briefly</p>
<p>about this third eye center business</p>
<p>because it turns out to be pretty interesting.</p>
<p>The third eye is actually a name that&rsquo;s been given</p>
<p>to another neural structure, or I should say structure</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not strictly neural.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the pineal gland.</p>
<p>And this has an interesting history.</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;m not taking off on a tangent here</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t relevant to meditation.</p>
<p>So you have a brain, of course,</p>
<p>and on both sides of your brain,</p>
<p>you tend to have mirror symmetric representations</p>
<p>of the same things.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>You have a prefrontal cortex on the right,</p>
<p>you have a prefrontal cortex on the left,</p>
<p>and they actually do slightly different things.</p>
<p>Language is sometimes lateralized to one side,</p>
<p>but in general, for every structure</p>
<p>that you have on one side of the brain,</p>
<p>you have the same structure</p>
<p>on the opposite side of the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one clear exception to that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the pineal gland.</p>
<p>The pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin,</p>
<p>which at night, when it gets dark, secretes melatonin.</p>
<p>And that melatonin makes you sleepy,</p>
<p>helps you fall asleep, but not stay asleep.</p>
<p>Descartes, the philosopher Descartes,</p>
<p>asserted that the pineal was the seat of the soul</p>
<p>because it was the one structure in the brain</p>
<p>that he saw was not on both sides of the brain.</p>
<p>It was only one of them and in the middle.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the seat of the soul or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in a position to make assessments like that,</p>
<p>but what do we know about the pineal?</p>
<p>The pineal, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>is involved in releasing melatonin.</p>
<p>It does a few other things as well,</p>
<p>but it is also considered the third eye</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is that it responds to light,</p>
<p>although in humans, not directly.</p>
<p>So in birds and lizards and snakes,</p>
<p>they actually either have a thin skull</p>
<p>or believe it or not, two holes in the top of their skull</p>
<p>that allow light to go directly in.</p>
<p>If you look at the head of a snake,</p>
<p>light can go directly into their brain through these holes</p>
<p>and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin</p>
<p>and control their wakefulness, sleep rhythms.</p>
<p>In birds, they don&rsquo;t have holes in their skull,</p>
<p>but they have very thin skulls.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>light can penetrate the thinness of the skull</p>
<p>in many birds and communicates information</p>
<p>about time of day and even time of year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s translating to hormonal signals</p>
<p>such as melatonin release from the pineal.</p>
<p>And so the pineal has been called the third eye</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a light-sensitive organ inside the brain.</p>
<p>In humans, the pineal sits deep, deep, deep to the surface</p>
<p>and light cannot get in there.</p>
<p>In fact, if light can get into your brain,</p>
<p>unless you are part of a specific experiment</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s the intention</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re having neurosurgery or something of that sort,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got serious issues happening.</p>
<p>That pineal sits deep, deep, deep</p>
<p>near what&rsquo;s called the fourth ventricle</p>
<p>and it absolutely should not see light directly.</p>
<p>So the idea that the pineal is the third eye in humans</p>
<p>is not true.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>So anytime someone says,</p>
<p>oh, the pineal is your third eye,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the third eye center</p>
<p>that people are referring to</p>
<p>when they talk about meditation.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll see a number of different forms of art</p>
<p>where somebody will,</p>
<p>it will be a picture of a face and the eyes will be closed</p>
<p>or sometimes open.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be literally a third eye,</p>
<p>like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead.</p>
<p>That has been proposed for many thousands of years</p>
<p>to be quote unquote, the seat of our consciousness.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting because that real estate</p>
<p>behind the forehead actually turns out</p>
<p>to be the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies.</p>
<p>If you remove that brain area,</p>
<p>people become very reflexive.</p>
<p>They are not thinking intentionally.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t become deliberate.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is kind of an eerie result,</p>
<p>but if you inactivate,</p>
<p>you turn off the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and you give somebody the opportunity</p>
<p>to play a shooting game, for instance,</p>
<p>their accuracy goes through the roof.</p>
<p>They become essentially like a machine.</p>
<p>They see a stimulus, they shoot at it.</p>
<p>They see a stimulus, they shoot at it.</p>
<p>Their accuracy is exceptional,</p>
<p>but their ability to distinguish between enemy</p>
<p>and friend completely disappears.</p>
<p>So they become at a highly effective motor</p>
<p>or I should say sensory motor machine,</p>
<p>but their assessment and their judgment</p>
<p>about right or wrong completely disappears.</p>
<p>This is also true for people that have prefrontal damage.</p>
<p>They often will have inappropriate behavior</p>
<p>or a hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the third eye center as the seat of consciousness</p>
<p>and our intention is something that makes sense generally</p>
<p>with what we know about the neuroscience and neurology,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something more to it</p>
<p>that I think is especially important for all of you</p>
<p>that goes beyond anything about ancient traditions</p>
<p>or pineals or birds or snakes</p>
<p>and pits in the top of the head.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>The brain itself, meaning the brain tissue,</p>
<p>does not have any sensory neurons.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if I touch the top of my hand, I can feel that.</p>
<p>If I want to sense my heartbeat,</p>
<p>if I work at it, I can feel that.</p>
<p>If I want to sense how I feel internally</p>
<p>at the level of my stomach, is it full?</p>
<p>Is it empty?</p>
<p>Am I hungry?</p>
<p>Is it acidic?</p>
<p>Does it ache or does it feel pleasant, et cetera?</p>
<p>I can sense that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we have sensory neurons on our skin</p>
<p>and in our body, et cetera.</p>
<p>We also have sensory neurons in our eyes</p>
<p>that let us perceive things externally.</p>
<p>We have no sensory neurons on our brain.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull</p>
<p>and do brain surgery on somebody who&rsquo;s wide awake</p>
<p>and be poking around in there,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t need any anesthetic on the brain itself.</p>
<p>They need anesthetic for the incision site,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t need anesthetic on the brain</p>
<p>because it has no feeling.</p>
<p>You have emotions, but there&rsquo;s no feeling.</p>
<p>So normally we are perceiving and paying attention</p>
<p>to what we are sensing either externally,</p>
<p>sights and sounds, again, exteroception,</p>
<p>or internally, interoception, touch, et cetera.</p>
<p>But by focusing our perception and our attention,</p>
<p>not on our bodily surface like a body scan,</p>
<p>but to a point a couple centimeters</p>
<p>or inches behind our forehead,</p>
<p>we essentially are bringing that attentional,</p>
<p>that perceptual spotlight to a location</p>
<p>in which there is no sensation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to feel there.</p>
<p>And when we do that by closing our eyes</p>
<p>and focusing on that, quote unquote, third eye center,</p>
<p>which is the prefrontal cortex, to be quite honest,</p>
<p>when we do that, something else happens.</p>
<p>And what happens is when we are not thinking about</p>
<p>and perceiving our sensations, because there are none there,</p>
<p>our thoughts and our emotions and our memories</p>
<p>sort of mushroom up, a better way to put it</p>
<p>would be that they geyser up</p>
<p>and take on more prominence in our perception.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is that normally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about the contact point</p>
<p>between me and this chair, but as I&rsquo;m speaking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in contact with the chair and those neurons are firing.</p>
<p>But if I focus my energy and attention on them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to fire the same,</p>
<p>but more of my perception goes there.</p>
<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;m thinking things all the time, you are too,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m perceiving things all the time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m remembering things all the time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m anticipating things all the time about the future.</p>
<p>But by focusing my attention on the one organ,</p>
<p>for which I have no sensation, that is my brain,</p>
<p>well, then thoughts, feelings, and memories,</p>
<p>feelings meaning emotional feelings,</p>
<p>start to grow in their prominence</p>
<p>in my awareness and in my perception.</p>
<p>And so this is why when you sit down</p>
<p>to a meditative practice, if it&rsquo;s a meditative practice</p>
<p>where you close your eyes or you&rsquo;re focused</p>
<p>on that third eye center, where you&rsquo;re focused on your brain</p>
<p>as opposed to your bodily surface</p>
<p>or something external to you,</p>
<p>the thoughts seem to come by in waves</p>
<p>and they can almost be overwhelming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to, as it&rsquo;s often described,</p>
<p>just sit back and watch your thoughts go by</p>
<p>because there are so many of them.</p>
<p>Actually, the best way to stop thinking</p>
<p>is to really focus on something external</p>
<p>or to focus on sensation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s less thinking than it is perceiving senses.</p>
<p>Okay, so I don&rsquo;t want this to get too abstract.</p>
<p>When people talk about the third eye center,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not talking about the pineal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And when you direct your own attention</p>
<p>to the very area of your brain that directs attention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to sense there.</p>
<p>The only things that will become present to you</p>
<p>are feelings, emotions, that is, thoughts and memories.</p>
<p>And they will often arrive</p>
<p>in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion.</p>
<p>And the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion</p>
<p>is because normally we just don&rsquo;t perceive things that way.</p>
<p>Normally we are splitting our attention,</p>
<p>our perception, that is, to multiple things,</p>
<p>our sensation and our thoughts.</p>
<p>When we put all of our perception into our thoughts,</p>
<p>we see how disorganized, how wandering they are,</p>
<p>and how, in fact, how random and intrusive those can be.</p>
<p>Again, random and intrusive.</p>
<p>And much of what we talked about in that paper earlier,</p>
<p>the one where they asked people,</p>
<p>what are you doing and what are you feeling</p>
<p>and how happy or how unhappy you are,</p>
<p>what they discovered was that most people</p>
<p>in their head a lot,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really present to what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which leads me to the statement that I believe,</p>
<p>at least based on the data, that paper included,</p>
<p>that most people have an interoceptive bias.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re focused more on what&rsquo;s going on internally</p>
<p>than they are focused on what&rsquo;s happening externally.</p>
<p>There are certainly people who, for the opposite is true,</p>
<p>but I think that this is an issue</p>
<p>because we hear so often</p>
<p>about the need to do a meditation practice</p>
<p>that allows us to focus inward</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re getting yanked around</p>
<p>by all the stressors of life, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we are, we&rsquo;re getting yanked around</p>
<p>by all the stressors and demands of life.</p>
<p>But as we do that,</p>
<p>we tend to be very focused on what&rsquo;s happening with us.</p>
<p>The data clearly point to the fact</p>
<p>that being mindful and being aware</p>
<p>can enhance one&rsquo;s level of presence and happiness,</p>
<p>but we can go so far as to say</p>
<p>that being mindful and aware of what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>not just with us, but external to us</p>
<p>in our immediate environment,</p>
<p>and that includes what other people are saying and doing,</p>
<p>that also can really enhance</p>
<p>our sense of wellbeing and happiness.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what the data point to.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s briefly recap where we&rsquo;ve been so far.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about the brain networks</p>
<p>that are activated during meditation,</p>
<p>which include prefrontal cortex, ACC, the insula.</p>
<p>We also talked about the difference</p>
<p>between interoception and exteroception</p>
<p>and the importance of assessing</p>
<p>where you are along that continuum.</p>
<p>And I should mention, of course,</p>
<p>that you can be right in the middle of that continuum.</p>
<p>You might sit down to do meditation</p>
<p>and find that you are smack dab in the middle</p>
<p>of being able to attend to things outside of you,</p>
<p>but also attending to things inside of you,</p>
<p>in which case I suggest doing a meditation</p>
<p>that is either exteroceptive biased or interoceptive biased.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>if you find that you are more, quote unquote,</p>
<p>in your head or in your body,</p>
<p>well then focus on an exteroceptive biased meditation</p>
<p>to build up that set of circuits,</p>
<p>whereas if you are more exteroceptively focused</p>
<p>at any given moment,</p>
<p>well then I encourage you to do</p>
<p>an interoceptively focused meditation practice.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this issue of how long to do a practice.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different data on these,</p>
<p>but some of the practices we&rsquo;ve covered on this podcast</p>
<p>before when we had guests, for instance,</p>
<p>highlighted the 13 minute meditation</p>
<p>that Dr. Wendy Suzuki</p>
<p>from New York University&rsquo;s laboratory has popularized</p>
<p>and they popularized it because they have a wonderful paper</p>
<p>that we will provide a link to,</p>
<p>which shows that a daily 13 minute meditation,</p>
<p>which is of the traditional third eye</p>
<p>interoceptively biased,</p>
<p>focus on breathing and focus on that location</p>
<p>directly behind one&rsquo;s forehead or both,</p>
<p>that meditation done daily for about eight weeks,</p>
<p>maybe shorter, but in that study, eight weeks,</p>
<p>greatly improved mood, improved ability to sleep,</p>
<p>improved cognitive ability and focus, memory,</p>
<p>a huge number of metrics were looked at very specifically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a terrific one.</p>
<p>And you may be asking yourself,</p>
<p>do you need to do the full 13 minutes?</p>
<p>Could you get away with five minutes or three minutes?</p>
<p>Well, my laboratory has shown benefits in stress reduction,</p>
<p>improvement in sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>with a five minute a day meditation.</p>
<p>However, in trying to establish</p>
<p>how long you should meditate,</p>
<p>I would ask yourself a couple of questions.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>what is a practice that you can do consistently?</p>
<p>And by consistently,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean every day.</p>
<p>If you answer the question about consistency honestly,</p>
<p>and you find that you can only do</p>
<p>one meditation session per week,</p>
<p>well, then I would encourage you to go a little bit longer,</p>
<p>maybe 10 or 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Again, understanding that you&rsquo;re going to have to refocus</p>
<p>repeatedly throughout that meditation,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re focusing</p>
<p>on internal perceptions or external perceptions.</p>
<p>If however, you can set aside</p>
<p>five or 10 or 15 minutes per day,</p>
<p>and you can meditate every day,</p>
<p>well, then I think you have a bit more flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of how long you meditate.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s three minutes one day,</p>
<p>one minute the next day,</p>
<p>10 minutes to the next and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Just like with exercise,</p>
<p>the key component is consistency.</p>
<p>And this is borne out in all the data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s covered in altered traits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also borne out in all the recent studies</p>
<p>that have come out since that book was published.</p>
<p>Consistency is key.</p>
<p>So ask yourself what you can do consistently,</p>
<p>and also don&rsquo;t necessarily burden yourself</p>
<p>with always having to do the same amount</p>
<p>or duration of meditation.</p>
<p>So earlier we decided we were going to parse</p>
<p>or fine slice the meditation practice.</p>
<p>And indeed we&rsquo;ve been doing that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been talking about where you place</p>
<p>your perception or your focus.</p>
<p>Another key component of meditation</p>
<p>is the pattern of breathing that you embrace.</p>
<p>In fact, the pattern of breathing that you embrace</p>
<p>during your meditation practice</p>
<p>can itself be its own form of meditation.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, these days we hear a lot about breathwork.</p>
<p>Breathwork has really grown in popularity</p>
<p>in the last five, 10 years.</p>
<p>And there are a number of reasons for that.</p>
<p>First of all, I think we need to credit Wim Hof,</p>
<p>or can we call him, I think appropriately,</p>
<p>the great Wim Hof.</p>
<p>You know, certainly there were people before Wim</p>
<p>who were doing deliberate breathwork</p>
<p>and talking about deliberate breathwork.</p>
<p>But it was really about 2015 or so</p>
<p>that Wim Hof started to grow in recognition and popularity</p>
<p>for a particular style of breathing,</p>
<p>which in the laboratory we call cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>I know there are other names for it</p>
<p>that come from ancient traditions.</p>
<p>He named it, or people named it after him, Wim Hof.</p>
<p>Wim Hof, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>is a Dutchman who is known to hold many world records</p>
<p>for deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>including swimming under icebergs,</p>
<p>longest period of time buried in ice up to his neck,</p>
<p>et cetera, but who&rsquo;s also expert</p>
<p>in the use of breathing in particular ways</p>
<p>in order to manage and maneuver through those challenges.</p>
<p>And he started speaking about</p>
<p>different patterns of breathwork,</p>
<p>in particular the use of cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>deep, deliberate breathing.</p>
<p>So big inhales, exhales, big inhales, exhales.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, again,</p>
<p>we call that cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear from studies both done on Wim specifically,</p>
<p>but on the general population as well,</p>
<p>by my lab and other labs,</p>
<p>that that pattern of cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>of deliberately breathing deeply and repetitively,</p>
<p>typically in through the nose, out through the mouth,</p>
<p>generates a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>or causes adrenaline release from the brain and body.</p>
<p>It, quote unquote, heats up the body.</p>
<p>Indeed, it raises body temperature,</p>
<p>but the liberation of adrenaline</p>
<p>does a number of things</p>
<p>to shift the state of the brain and body.</p>
<p>That more or less is what Wim Hof breathing is,</p>
<p>although Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>or some people will call it tumo breathing</p>
<p>or cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>is not a pattern of breathing typical of most meditations</p>
<p>that have been discussed,</p>
<p>at least not in the research literature.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be incorporated into a meditation practice,</p>
<p>but Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>aka cyclic hyperventilation tumo,</p>
<p>is typically considered its own practice, okay?</p>
<p>Its own breathwork practice divorced from meditation.</p>
<p>It might have a meditative component,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not often discussed as meditation</p>
<p>or as part of meditation.</p>
<p>More typically, a meditation practice</p>
<p>involves slowing one&rsquo;s breathing,</p>
<p>and this could be in the form of cyclic breathing</p>
<p>of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, which is cyclic,</p>
<p>or in some cases, doubling up on inhales and then exhaling.</p>
<p>So inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>or controlling the duration of inhale, breath, hold,</p>
<p>exhale, breath, hold, repeat, so-called box breathing,</p>
<p>where the inhale, the hold, the exhale, and the hold</p>
<p>are of equivalent durations.</p>
<p>Any number of different breathing patterns,</p>
<p>slow cyclic breathing, box breathing,</p>
<p>a cadence of three to six seconds in,</p>
<p>holding for two seconds, and seven seconds out,</p>
<p>regardless of what cadence of breathing one uses,</p>
<p>there is a tendency during most meditative practices</p>
<p>to slow one&rsquo;s breathing and or control one&rsquo;s breathing</p>
<p>in deliberate fashion.</p>
<p>This is essential because when we default our breathing,</p>
<p>that is when we don&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>to how long we are inhaling relative to our exhales,</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t deliberately exhale,</p>
<p>that is normally we just passively exhale,</p>
<p>but we actively inhale, I repeat that normally,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not thinking about breathing,</p>
<p>we deliberately inhale, there&rsquo;s a motor command</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sent to inflate the lungs,</p>
<p>and then we passively exhale,</p>
<p>but in many breathwork practices or meditation practices,</p>
<p>we actually actively exhale as well.</p>
<p>Well, when we do that, a number of things happen.</p>
<p>First of all, it forces us into interoception, why?</p>
<p>Because the diaphragm, the muscle that helps</p>
<p>move the lungs essentially,</p>
<p>and create a specific cadence of breathing</p>
<p>or depth of breathing, as one would with box breathing</p>
<p>or deliberately slow breathing,</p>
<p>well, that muscle resides inside of us,</p>
<p>and so when we focus on our breathing,</p>
<p>more often than not, we aren&rsquo;t focused</p>
<p>on the actual air leaving our nasal passages or mouth,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit, but more typically,</p>
<p>we are forced to focus or we just default</p>
<p>to focusing on the movement of our diaphragm</p>
<p>or of our belly or the rising and falling of our chest.</p>
<p>All of that is to say that by deliberately focusing</p>
<p>on our breathing, we shift to interoception.</p>
<p>So breathing and specific patterns of breathing</p>
<p>sort of along for the ride in meditation,</p>
<p>but the reverse can also be said,</p>
<p>that when we focus on our breathing,</p>
<p>we shift to interoception and away from external events.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t still pay attention</p>
<p>at external events, we can still exterocept,</p>
<p>but at least some portion of our perception,</p>
<p>of our attention shifts to interoception.</p>
<p>So we of course need to breathe to stay alive.</p>
<p>We have to breathe at least every so often</p>
<p>in order to stay alive.</p>
<p>So of course, breathing is part of any meditative practice,</p>
<p>just like it&rsquo;s part of any living activity, even sleep.</p>
<p>But if the first component of meditation</p>
<p>is to direct our perception in a deliberate way,</p>
<p>using that prefrontal cortex to a specific location,</p>
<p>either on the surface of or within our body</p>
<p>or external to our body or both,</p>
<p>but typically one or the other,</p>
<p>then we can say that the second element</p>
<p>of a meditative practice is the pattern of breathing.</p>
<p>And we can ask ourselves,</p>
<p>can it and should it be deliberate or not?</p>
<p>In other words, do we just default</p>
<p>to however we happen to be breathing</p>
<p>or should it be deliberate?</p>
<p>That is, should we be controlling the depth and the cadence?</p>
<p>And I do believe that based on what we know</p>
<p>about the capacity for specific patterns of breathing</p>
<p>to shift our brain state,</p>
<p>that controlling one&rsquo;s pattern of breathing</p>
<p>during meditation can be enormously useful.</p>
<p>And that is true regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>one is focusing on interoceptive perceptions</p>
<p>within our body or exteroceptive perceptions.</p>
<p>So that raises the question,</p>
<p>how should we breathe during meditation?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s again, no simple one size fits all rule there,</p>
<p>but there are some general rules of respiration physiology</p>
<p>that can help us access and develop a meditation practice</p>
<p>that is going to best serve our goals.</p>
<p>And since this is not an episode all about respiration</p>
<p>and we will do one,</p>
<p>but I simply want to give you the basics</p>
<p>of what respiration can do</p>
<p>to shift your brain and body state.</p>
<p>Before I do that, however,</p>
<p>I want to give a very specific instruction,</p>
<p>which is when you sit down to meditate,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re going to do your meditation walking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>I should just say,</p>
<p>when you are about to begin your meditative practice,</p>
<p>you need to ask yourself a question.</p>
<p>Do you want to be more relaxed than you are at present?</p>
<p>Or do you want to be more alert than you are at present</p>
<p>when you exit the meditation practice?</p>
<p>Do you want to calm down</p>
<p>or do you want to become more alert?</p>
<p>Simple question.</p>
<p>You can decide from session to session,</p>
<p>you could even switch within a session,</p>
<p>but just as you need to assess whether or not</p>
<p>you are leaning more interoceptively or exteroceptively,</p>
<p>you also need to ask yourself,</p>
<p>do you need to calm down or want to calm down</p>
<p>or do you want to be more alert</p>
<p>at the end of your meditation session?</p>
<p>Or maybe you want to go into a state of deep relaxation</p>
<p>and then exit with more alertness.</p>
<p>The way to do that is very simple.</p>
<p>Using breath work and specific patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the general rule</p>
<p>that is supported by all the respiration physiology</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m oversimplifying here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m oversimplifying intentionally</p>
<p>so you can simply apply the tool.</p>
<p>And then, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>we will do an episode all about respiration physiology</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>Essentially, if your inhales are longer</p>
<p>and or more vigorous than your exhales,</p>
<p>then you will tend to be more alert</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll shift your brain and body</p>
<p>towards a state of more alertness.</p>
<p>This is simply based on the way that the neural circuits</p>
<p>like the pre-Botzinger nucleus and the parafacial nucleus,</p>
<p>they govern respiration physiology and alertness</p>
<p>simply the way they work.</p>
<p>They communicate with brain areas</p>
<p>that release noradrenaline, norepinephrine, et cetera.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you emphasize longer duration</p>
<p>and or more vigorous exhales relative to your inhales,</p>
<p>you will tend to relax more.</p>
<p>You will tend to calm your nervous system.</p>
<p>Now you might be saying,</p>
<p>okay, I understand what it is to make an inhale</p>
<p>longer than my exhale, but how do I make it more vigorous?</p>
<p>Well, it simply means drawing more air</p>
<p>into your lungs more quickly</p>
<p>than you allow yourself to exhale that air.</p>
<p>So an example of inhale biased breath work would be,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an active emphasis on the inhale</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little bit longer than the exhale,</p>
<p>which is passive.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you want to relax,</p>
<p>then you want to extend your exhales</p>
<p>relative to your inhales</p>
<p>and you can even make them active exhales.</p>
<p>So it can be inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to shift your nervous system</p>
<p>in a direction of more calm.</p>
<p>And of course, if you would like to stay</p>
<p>at the level of alertness, aka calmness,</p>
<p>because those are two sides of the same seesaw</p>
<p>or the same continuum,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to be right where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>at the end of your meditation as where you started,</p>
<p>at least in terms of levels of alertness and calmness,</p>
<p>well, then you would just keep your inhales</p>
<p>and your exhales relatively balanced in terms of duration.</p>
<p>Now, the introduction of things like breath holds</p>
<p>with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>typically it&rsquo;s 25 or 30 deep inhale,</p>
<p>exhales, deep inhale, exhales,</p>
<p>and then exhale all your air,</p>
<p>hold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds</p>
<p>and then repeat and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes some inhales and holds.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a whole business into itself.</p>
<p>But for sake of meditation,</p>
<p>the key thing to understand is that</p>
<p>if you are going to do a complicated breathing practice,</p>
<p>it will, by design, by necessity,</p>
<p>shift much of your attention to the breathing practice,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s not cyclic.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not inhales, follow exhales.</p>
<p>Cyclic breathing is where inhales always follow exhales,</p>
<p>follow inhales, follow exhales.</p>
<p>It actually relies on a specific brain center</p>
<p>called the Prebrot-Singer Complex</p>
<p>discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.</p>
<p>He was a guest on this podcast previously.</p>
<p>However, if you are doubling up on your inhale,</p>
<p>so two inhales and then an exhale,</p>
<p>a pattern of breathing my laboratory</p>
<p>has studied extensively,</p>
<p>well, then that relies on a different brain center,</p>
<p>the parafacial nucleus.</p>
<p>The point is that if you are engaging</p>
<p>in non-cyclic breathing,</p>
<p>or you are deliberately emphasizing</p>
<p>inhales or exhales,</p>
<p>or the vigor of inhales and exhales, et cetera,</p>
<p>well, then some portion of your attention</p>
<p>will be devoted to making sure</p>
<p>that you follow that breathing practice.</p>
<p>We are very good at going into cyclic breathing practices</p>
<p>by default, and our attention can drift to other things,</p>
<p>interoceptive or exteroceptive, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We can just drift into how our body feels</p>
<p>or something we see or hear in the room, et cetera.</p>
<p>When we are focused on our breathing</p>
<p>and the breathing pattern is non-cyclic or complex</p>
<p>in some way in that it involves</p>
<p>deliberate voluntary commands,</p>
<p>again, from those so-called top-down mechanisms</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>well, that by design requires some portion,</p>
<p>often a significant portion of our attention</p>
<p>to be devoted to the breathing practice itself.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means that breath work itself</p>
<p>can be a form of meditation,</p>
<p>and meditation can involve breath work,</p>
<p>but one should know that the more deliberate</p>
<p>and unnatural that pattern of breathing is,</p>
<p>the less you will be able to focus on other things.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>You can actually leverage this.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very much caught in your own head, right?</p>
<p>We talked about this earlier.</p>
<p>You happen to be, or you&rsquo;re in a moment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really stuck in your head</p>
<p>and you want to get out of your head.</p>
<p>Well, then that meditation practice that you do</p>
<p>really should be focused on exteroceptive bias.</p>
<p>You should really focus on something external to you,</p>
<p>and I would encourage you to use</p>
<p>a natural cyclic pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>where inhales follow, exhales follow,</p>
<p>inhales follow, exhales.</p>
<p>If, however, you are finding that you&rsquo;re sort of caught</p>
<p>in the landscape of things happening around you,</p>
<p>and you want to ground yourself as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a loose language, not a scientific language.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s this practice of grounding,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a whole thing people are always writing to me</p>
<p>is grounding a real thing,</p>
<p>walking barefoot on the earth and magnetic fields</p>
<p>and gravitational fields.</p>
<p>Well, gravity is real, but grounding,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a lot of science for it, to be frank.</p>
<p>Does feel nice to walk on the ground, however.</p>
<p>But if you are somebody who&rsquo;s kind of feeling pulled out</p>
<p>of yourself a lot or in a moment,</p>
<p>and you want to bring your awareness into your body</p>
<p>and sort of calm down, well, then I would encourage you</p>
<p>to, yes, use a deliberate, somewhat unnatural</p>
<p>or non-default pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>which by definition will force you to attend</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on interoceptively.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not aware of any place</p>
<p>that this has been discussed in detail such as this before.</p>
<p>If there is a research literature on this,</p>
<p>please let me know.</p>
<p>My laboratory has been working on this extensively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for new colleagues and collaborators.</p>
<p>We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel, who&rsquo;s an expert in hypnosis,</p>
<p>again, who&rsquo;s been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;s our associate chair of psychiatry,</p>
<p>world expert in hypnosis.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on this podcast before.</p>
<p>We have an active research program focused on these issues.</p>
<p>We are very much of the belief</p>
<p>that a breathwork practice itself can be meditative.</p>
<p>A meditation practice can include breathing,</p>
<p>but the more that that meditative practice focuses</p>
<p>on the breathing itself,</p>
<p>the more interoceptive biased it will be.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that an interoceptive biased breathwork practice</p>
<p>will have a specific effect,</p>
<p>which is to make you more interoceptively aware.</p>
<p>And if you think back to earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>for many people, that will be a wonderful thing</p>
<p>and something that they are actively seeking</p>
<p>or ought to seek because it can help people gain awareness.</p>
<p>For instance, if they&rsquo;re stressed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not realizing it till the end of the day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just exhausted,</p>
<p>more interoceptive awareness throughout the day</p>
<p>can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>If, however, you are somebody who is overly focused</p>
<p>on your bodily sensations,</p>
<p>well, then more exteroceptive awareness is important.</p>
<p>And this brings us to a yet larger theme,</p>
<p>but a theme that I think really emphasizes</p>
<p>what particular types of meditative practices</p>
<p>are going to be best for certain people,</p>
<p>especially people who are using meditation</p>
<p>to combat certain challenges,</p>
<p>in particular mood-based challenges</p>
<p>or sleep-based challenges or focus-based challenges.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t listed off all the positive benefits</p>
<p>of meditation yet in this episode,</p>
<p>but they are many, many, many.</p>
<p>In fact, there are now tens of thousands</p>
<p>of scientific studies showing, for instance,</p>
<p>there are known benefits of doing meditation</p>
<p>for enhancing sleep.</p>
<p>There are known benefits of a regular meditation practice</p>
<p>for enhancing focus.</p>
<p>There are known benefits of a regular meditation practice</p>
<p>for reducing inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>even improving outcomes in cancer,</p>
<p>reducing pain, improving mood,</p>
<p>reducing the symptoms of ADHD and clinically diagnosed ACI</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And again, rather than focus</p>
<p>on all those beautiful studies today,</p>
<p>which all basically point to the fact</p>
<p>that some meditation practice done regularly,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s very brief,</p>
<p>has tremendous, even outsized benefits on our health,</p>
<p>even relative to some drug treatments that&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on all that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been more focused on what sorts</p>
<p>of brain and body changes occur</p>
<p>when we do a meditation practice.</p>
<p>And perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>what really constitutes a meditation practice?</p>
<p>We have this thing about a continuum of perception.</p>
<p>We also now are talking about breathing.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s another component that I&rsquo;d like to raise now,</p>
<p>which we could say is the third major component.</p>
<p>The first one that I raised was interoceptive</p>
<p>versus extroceptive bias or continuum.</p>
<p>Second being breathing.</p>
<p>Is it going to be default or deliberate breathing?</p>
<p>Is it going to be natural cadence or unnatural cadence?</p>
<p>Again, no right or wrong.</p>
<p>It just depends on what your goal is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a third component.</p>
<p>And this is a component, again,</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t really been formalized in the literature,</p>
<p>but that Dr. Spiegel and I are working hard to formalize</p>
<p>through some research and through an upcoming review</p>
<p>that we will provide links to once it&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a separate continuum,</p>
<p>which is the continuum</p>
<p>between interoception and dissociation.</p>
<p>So now all of you know what interoception is,</p>
<p>but most people probably don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t realize what dissociation is.</p>
<p>Often we hear about dissociation,</p>
<p>sometimes called disassociation.</p>
<p>Some people pronounce it dissociation.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Despite being corrected many times</p>
<p>for each of those pronunciations,</p>
<p>I checked with my colleagues who are experts</p>
<p>in dissociation or disassociation, and guess what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same thing.</p>
<p>Tomato, tomato, potato, potato.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to say dissociation.</p>
<p>Some people will say disassociation, like I disassociate.</p>
<p>Other people will say I dissociate, okay?</p>
<p>Both of those refer to essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>Dissociation is often talked about</p>
<p>in the context of a negative event.</p>
<p>And indeed, dissociation is unfortunately,</p>
<p>or I should say is adaptively associated</p>
<p>with traumatic events.</p>
<p>In particular, violent or sexual trauma,</p>
<p>people will report feeling out of body</p>
<p>or out of the experience during the experience</p>
<p>or during a recollection of the experience.</p>
<p>Dissociation has also been described</p>
<p>in terms of people who are in a traumatic accident</p>
<p>or they see someone killed right in front of them.</p>
<p>First responders will talk about dissociating</p>
<p>when they arrive on a scene.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to provide gruesome imagery here</p>
<p>because I know people can be pretty sensitive to this,</p>
<p>but showing up on the scene of a car crash</p>
<p>and just seeing carnage or incredible damage to bodies</p>
<p>or this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Dissociation lies at the opposite end</p>
<p>of a continuum with interoception.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said the interoception</p>
<p>is on the opposite end of a continuum with exteroception,</p>
<p>but it also is on the opposite end</p>
<p>of a continuum with dissociation.</p>
<p>We can provide some better definitions perhaps</p>
<p>to make this crystal clear.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m actually reading from an upcoming review.</p>
<p>I feel comfortable reading from it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an author on the review,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, interoception refers to a process</p>
<p>by which your nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning your brain and connections with your body,</p>
<p>senses, interprets, integrates, and regulate signals</p>
<p>originating from within the body</p>
<p>and thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping</p>
<p>of your internal landscape</p>
<p>at both a conscious and unconscious level.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a lot of words to describe</p>
<p>basically the process of perceiving what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>at the level of the surface of your skin or inward.</p>
<p>Dissociation can be thought of as the opposite</p>
<p>of interoception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lack of bodily awareness</p>
<p>or a removal of one&rsquo;s conscious experience</p>
<p>from one&rsquo;s bodily experience and awareness.</p>
<p>Again, this is most often talked about</p>
<p>in the context of something traumatic,</p>
<p>but really, if we think about health and mental health</p>
<p>and physical health, the optimal place to reside</p>
<p>on the continuum between interoception and dissociation</p>
<p>is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be dissociated from life&rsquo;s experiences,</p>
<p>but we also don&rsquo;t want everything that happens in the world</p>
<p>to profoundly impact our heart rate and our breathing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be yanked around by every experience.</p>
<p>Okay, there are instances in which being yanked around</p>
<p>or pulled into an experience</p>
<p>is something that we desire and want,</p>
<p>like seeing a movie that we want to see,</p>
<p>or for instance, clinical hypnosis,</p>
<p>or falling in love, wonderful experiences,</p>
<p>and sometimes also sad experiences, right?</p>
<p>Being able to feel one&rsquo;s feelings</p>
<p>depending on life&rsquo;s events is important,</p>
<p>but being too dissociated or being too feeling,</p>
<p>that is feeling so much in response</p>
<p>to everything that happens, is also problematic.</p>
<p>There are certain people, for instance,</p>
<p>that have challenges with what&rsquo;s called narrative distancing.</p>
<p>That is, they see someone in a movie getting hit</p>
<p>and they almost flinch as if they are getting hit.</p>
<p>They see someone who&rsquo;s scared or happy in a movie</p>
<p>and they feel scared or happy in a way</p>
<p>that seems like they&rsquo;re along for the ride</p>
<p>a little bit too much.</p>
<p>This is important because what it speaks to</p>
<p>is the ability for that,</p>
<p>remember way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>that ACC, that anterior cingulate cortex and the insula?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a prefrontal cortex that can say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s be rational.</p>
<p>That movie, that person who&rsquo;s happy or sad,</p>
<p>that person in your environment who&rsquo;s breaking down crying,</p>
<p>yes, they&rsquo;re sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to be sympathetic,</p>
<p>maybe even empathic towards them,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not get pulled into the experience</p>
<p>so much that we lose ourselves.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are areas of your brain</p>
<p>that are also leaning on, and here I&rsquo;m using metaphor,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re leaning on the insula and ACC and saying,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s somebody that I care about that&rsquo;s upset,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to be upset.</p>
<p>Or somebody I care about is happy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to be happy.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re scared, so I&rsquo;m also going to be scared.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a push-pull between our recognition</p>
<p>that we are each distinct entities</p>
<p>and also, of course, the very healthy desire</p>
<p>to be attached to others&rsquo; experiences</p>
<p>and the experiences around us.</p>
<p>So why am I raising yet another continuum, right?</p>
<p>We already have the one continuum</p>
<p>of interoceptive-extroceptive awareness.</p>
<p>Well, if we want to think about how meditation</p>
<p>can serve our mental health and our ability to focus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very particular mental model</p>
<p>that we can arrive at</p>
<p>that incorporates this interoceptive-dissociative continuum.</p>
<p>Again, if you are extremely interoceptive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling everything in your body,</p>
<p>and those feelings in your body</p>
<p>nearly completely account for all of your experience</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re that far into the continuum.</p>
<p>On the dissociative end of things,</p>
<p>you can see what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>you can react to what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but your bodily response to that is essentially shut down.</p>
<p>You could either be paralyzed, shut down,</p>
<p>so in kind of no movement,</p>
<p>or you could still be engaging in behaviors,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re dissociated.</p>
<p>Again, sadly, this is often what victims of trauma report,</p>
<p>that they are able to just go through the motions,</p>
<p>but just shut off their emotions</p>
<p>or their emotions just shut off.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t feeling the elevated heart rate or breathing.</p>
<p>Sometimes they can even be quite scared,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not even perspiring</p>
<p>or showing any signs of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>that is, fright or stress or panic.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about this model</p>
<p>of interoception and dissociation,</p>
<p>and then a meditative practice that can be used</p>
<p>to try and anchor us at the right location</p>
<p>or the healthy location along that continuum.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first imagine the ideal mental health state,</p>
<p>and here I want to acknowledge nobody achieves</p>
<p>or at least maintains this mental health state.</p>
<p>Once you do imagine that where you are</p>
<p>along this interoceptive to dissociative continuum</p>
<p>is like a ball bearing,</p>
<p>or you represent a sphere</p>
<p>that can roll back and forth along the continuum.</p>
<p>At one end, you have pure interoception.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just feeling everything.</p>
<p>At the other end, you&rsquo;re completely dissociated.</p>
<p>Well, in this one version of mental health,</p>
<p>we take that continuum and we fold up the sides</p>
<p>so that it looks like a V, okay?</p>
<p>On one end, you have interoception,</p>
<p>on the other end, you have dissociation.</p>
<p>I realize a number of people are listening to this,</p>
<p>not watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t see that my hands are now,</p>
<p>the heel of my hands are together,</p>
<p>my fingers and my hands are apart,</p>
<p>so it looks like a V, and you are like a ball bearing.</p>
<p>Your state is like a ball bearing at the base of that.</p>
<p>You are in a trench of perfectly balanced interoception</p>
<p>and dissociation.</p>
<p>So you can feel things,</p>
<p>you can register what&rsquo;s going on in the outside world,</p>
<p>but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s happening in the outside world.</p>
<p>You are in a perfect place of being able</p>
<p>to make rational decisions</p>
<p>and yet still feel your feelings.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be lovely?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be lovely if we could be like that</p>
<p>whenever we wanted to?</p>
<p>And frankly, nobody is like that all the time.</p>
<p>More typically, the model of mental health</p>
<p>and mood and wellbeing and perception</p>
<p>of self versus others and internal versus external states</p>
<p>is one of more of a U, a U shape,</p>
<p>where at one end, we have interoception</p>
<p>and at the other end, we have dissociation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of U shaped,</p>
<p>and your state is more or less like a ball bearing</p>
<p>at the base of that U that can,</p>
<p>it gets pushed from side to side.</p>
<p>Maybe your heart races a little bit</p>
<p>because of something bad or good,</p>
<p>and that ball bearing shifts</p>
<p>towards interoception a little bit more,</p>
<p>and you notice that your heart is racing.</p>
<p>Or perhaps at any given moment,</p>
<p>your mind drifts a little bit while watching a movie</p>
<p>or while talking to your partner</p>
<p>or while your child is complaining about something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about something else,</p>
<p>and that ball bearing shifts</p>
<p>towards the dissociative state a little bit.</p>
<p>That is a mild form of dissociation,</p>
<p>and I think most people would agree</p>
<p>that being mentally healthy</p>
<p>would involve this kind of U shaped model as well,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s kind of, can shift back and forth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not extreme.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going from interoceptive biased</p>
<p>all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way.</p>
<p>The ball bearing stays down near the base of that U.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there are states that we all, frankly,</p>
<p>go into from time to time</p>
<p>where the continuum of interoception and dissociation</p>
<p>is essentially flat,</p>
<p>where you are a ball bearing at one location or another,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re watching a movie</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re very engrossed in</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a conversation with</p>
<p>or in an activity with your partner or a friend, et cetera,</p>
<p>has you very engrossed, maybe matching their state, right?</p>
<p>There are a number of states you can imagine</p>
<p>where matching one state is actually healthy and good,</p>
<p>and then there are a number of conditions in life</p>
<p>and situations in life</p>
<p>where being matched to someone else&rsquo;s condition,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re getting yelled at and they&rsquo;re angry,</p>
<p>so then you&rsquo;re getting angry,</p>
<p>and then pretty soon, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not in the best place along that continuum.</p>
<p>And I think that for many people,</p>
<p>they find themselves somewhere along that continuum,</p>
<p>and a number of practices, including meditation,</p>
<p>including exercise, including getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>including therapy, including journaling,</p>
<p>including just doing activities</p>
<p>like social engagement that you enjoy,</p>
<p>are designed to sort of bring up the edges</p>
<p>of that flat continuum into more of a U or concave shape</p>
<p>so that that ball bearing,</p>
<p>meaning your state of awareness</p>
<p>and your state of feeling your own feelings</p>
<p>versus paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on around you,</p>
<p>is somewhere, again, biased toward the middle.</p>
<p>By curling up the edges of that continuum on either end,</p>
<p>it biases that state toward the middle.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s the extreme</p>
<p>that I think almost everybody would agree</p>
<p>is more or less pathologic,</p>
<p>which is one in which that continuum</p>
<p>is no longer shaped like a deep trench, like a V.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not shaped like a U.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not flat with the edges curled up a little bit</p>
<p>or even flat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually now convex.</p>
<p>It looks like a mountain shape, a peak.</p>
<p>And that little ball bearing at the top</p>
<p>can either drop all the way to one side</p>
<p>of pure interoception,</p>
<p>just feeling beyond any ability</p>
<p>to pay attention to anything else,</p>
<p>just feeling one&rsquo;s feelings,</p>
<p>being angry, being sad, or even happy, right?</p>
<p>Being so extremely happy or manic</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t pay attention to the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s totally out of context, right?</p>
<p>Inappropriate for what&rsquo;s going on around you,</p>
<p>or dropping to the other side of the continuum</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re so dissociated</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not engaged with what&rsquo;s going around you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re truly, quote-unquote, checked out.</p>
<p>That shape is one that I think almost all clinicians,</p>
<p>if not all clinicians, and most people would say</p>
<p>is pathologic because you are either completely checked out</p>
<p>or you are completely absorbed</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s going on within you or around you.</p>
<p>That mental model that I just created</p>
<p>is a simple mental model.</p>
<p>It is by no means exhaustive,</p>
<p>but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about</p>
<p>when we think about mental health.</p>
<p>And we talk about the ability to be mentally stable,</p>
<p>to feel one&rsquo;s feelings,</p>
<p>but to still be actively engaged</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s happening around us.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a continuum</p>
<p>that spans from interoceptive awareness to dissociation,</p>
<p>where the extremes are pathologic</p>
<p>and somewhere in the middle is healthier.</p>
<p>And then there are practices that bias us</p>
<p>toward being in the middle by default.</p>
<p>What are those practices?</p>
<p>Well, we know for sure</p>
<p>that being sleep-deprived, for instance,</p>
<p>tends to take us away from that trench shape</p>
<p>or U-shape continuum or even flat continuum</p>
<p>and starts to make that continuum more convex.</p>
<p>It tends to make us either feel</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re completely checked out and exhausted</p>
<p>or that we are completely labile.</p>
<p>We are yanked around by whatever experience is happening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not able to manage.</p>
<p>So sleep is, as I always say,</p>
<p>the fundamental or foundational layer of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>because it tends to put us in a healthier place.</p>
<p>That is, when we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>enough quality sleep consistently,</p>
<p>it tends to put us in the middle of that continuum.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation does exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>It pulls us apart.</p>
<p>And when I say pulls us apart, that&rsquo;s not a real term.</p>
<p>What it does is it tends to make</p>
<p>that continuum less concave, right?</p>
<p>Less bowl-shaped and more convex, more hill-shaped,</p>
<p>if not a peak mountain shape</p>
<p>where it drops us to one side or the other.</p>
<p>In addition, a meditative practice done regularly,</p>
<p>because it can allow us to become</p>
<p>more interoceptively aware,</p>
<p>or it can allow us to become more exteroceptively aware,</p>
<p>which is really just another form of dissociation.</p>
<p>Again, dissociation isn&rsquo;t always bad,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not at the extreme.</p>
<p>A meditative practice can actually teach us</p>
<p>to deliberately move along this continuum.</p>
<p>So this is something, again,</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been discussed a whole lot in the literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been discussed, I should say, in pieces,</p>
<p>in different literatures.</p>
<p>If you look in the clinical psychiatry literature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful collection of studies and reviews</p>
<p>that will say that interoceptive awareness is terrific,</p>
<p>except for the person that is so aware</p>
<p>of their internal functioning</p>
<p>that they are not able to engage in the world.</p>
<p>Similarly, you&rsquo;ll find a beautiful literature,</p>
<p>research and clinical literature,</p>
<p>that will say that dissociation is terrible</p>
<p>in the case of trauma.</p>
<p>In fact, it can put people in positions</p>
<p>of repeating a behavior over and over</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s damaging to them,</p>
<p>but because they can disengage</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re dissociated from it,</p>
<p>that they continue the behavior.</p>
<p>Or dissociation can be very adaptive and beneficial</p>
<p>if it allows people, for instance,</p>
<p>to create some narrative distancing</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not getting pulled into every argument.</p>
<p>Or if someone screams at them,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily think that it&rsquo;s their fault.</p>
<p>They are able to say, hey, wait,</p>
<p>use their prefrontal cortex and say, hey, wait,</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>does not mean that I did something wrong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the evidence rationally.</p>
<p>So in thinking about the positive effects</p>
<p>of meditation on mood,</p>
<p>there are two aspects that are important.</p>
<p>The first one we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which is being present to one&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>correlates with increased happiness.</p>
<p>Having your mind wander,</p>
<p>having your default mode network be one of mind wandering</p>
<p>actually is correlated with being more unhappy.</p>
<p>That was the earlier study that we talked about,</p>
<p>that study published in Science.</p>
<p>Now, of course, meditation can make us more present,</p>
<p>but if we do not pay attention to whether or not</p>
<p>we are becoming more present to interoception</p>
<p>or exteroception, that is to interoception or dissociation,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t pay attention to whether or not</p>
<p>our bias is one of dissociation versus interoception,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know where we are in the continuum,</p>
<p>well, then the meditation actually can make things worse,</p>
<p>not better.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who has a tremendous amount of interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>well, then meditating on your internal state</p>
<p>may not be good, and actually there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that it may actually be bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one little tiny example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this previously in the podcast,</p>
<p>but in that very study from Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>showing that 13 minute a day meditation</p>
<p>is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very clear that for a number of people</p>
<p>that do that typical third eye meditation</p>
<p>for 13 minutes a day,</p>
<p>if they do that too close to sleep</p>
<p>or when they want to go to sleep,</p>
<p>they have a hard time falling asleep,</p>
<p>which makes perfect sense</p>
<p>because they are becoming more interoceptively aware,</p>
<p>they are ramping up their level of focus.</p>
<p>A meditation practice typically</p>
<p>is a focus and refocus practice,</p>
<p>and falling asleep involves turning off your thoughts</p>
<p>and your focus and focusing purely on sensation,</p>
<p>and then your thoughts kind of fragment</p>
<p>and you drift off to sleep.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m a big fan of using non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>or yoga nidra.</p>
<p>We will provide links to non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>and yoga nidra protocols.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about them on the podcast before,</p>
<p>but those protocols are not meditation per se.</p>
<p>They tend to have people defocus.</p>
<p>They are anti-focus practices,</p>
<p>whereas meditation tends to be a focusing practice.</p>
<p>Along those lines,</p>
<p>a meditation practice that is one</p>
<p>that is exteroceptively biased,</p>
<p>where you focus on things that are outside your body</p>
<p>can be wonderful for somebody</p>
<p>who tends to focus too much on their inner landscape</p>
<p>and their inner narrative, et cetera,</p>
<p>can help get them out of their head and body,</p>
<p>which can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>But for people that are not in touch with their emotions,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t in touch with how they feel,</p>
<p>it actually can drive them down the exact path</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrong for them.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion is about meditation,</p>
<p>and we want to make sure that we are parsing meditation</p>
<p>in a rational way that matches the neural circuitry involved</p>
<p>and more importantly, for sake of practical purposes,</p>
<p>that you are asking yourselves the right question.</p>
<p>Are you interoceptively or exteroceptively biased?</p>
<p>Do you tend to dissociate</p>
<p>or do you tend to sort of feel everything in a big way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this term of hypersensitive people</p>
<p>or things of that sort,</p>
<p>and some of those are clinical terms, some of them are not,</p>
<p>but you need to assess this,</p>
<p>and you also need to assess where you happen to be at</p>
<p>on a given day, which will be dictated, of course,</p>
<p>by how well you slept, life experience, et cetera.</p>
<p>So this interoceptive to dissociative continuum</p>
<p>is one that you need to address</p>
<p>prior to any meditative practice.</p>
<p>And again, the solution or the answer of what to do</p>
<p>in response to your answer</p>
<p>of whether or not you are more inward-focused</p>
<p>or outward-focused, again, is very simple.</p>
<p>Just do the opposite of where your bias lies.</p>
<p>That is, if you&rsquo;re tilted towards interoception,</p>
<p>do an exteroceptive-focused practice.</p>
<p>If you are more dissociative and you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>that sounds sort of pejorative, that sounds bad, right?</p>
<p>But again, if you are somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s more focused on events outside your body</p>
<p>and you want to gain more interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>and feeling state, if you will,</p>
<p>well, then you want to do a practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s third eye center practice or breathing-focused.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that many people meditate</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve heard before or they&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>that meditation can replace sleep</p>
<p>or can reduce one&rsquo;s overall sleep need.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting set of questions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that I dove into the literature</p>
<p>to pursue an answer to.</p>
<p>And I came up with an answer that was, frankly,</p>
<p>a little bit complicated on the face of it,</p>
<p>but boils down to some very simple protocols</p>
<p>that I think any and all of us can leverage</p>
<p>in order to sleep better and maybe even reduce</p>
<p>the total amount of sleep that we need,</p>
<p>something that I think most people would want.</p>
<p>I realized that we all probably should enjoy sleeping.</p>
<p>I certainly do, but that it&rsquo;s hard to get enough sleep.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful, for instance,</p>
<p>to be able to get by on a little less sleep</p>
<p>and still feel alert and rested?</p>
<p>First of all, I want to point to the recent study.</p>
<p>And again, this is one that I&rsquo;ve raised a few times</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll post a link to it entitled,</p>
<p>Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory,</p>
<p>Mood, and Emotion Regulation in Non-Experienced Meditators.</p>
<p>This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki,</p>
<p>who was a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences</p>
<p>at New York University and has run a laboratory</p>
<p>focused on memory for a long time.</p>
<p>Is a terrific neuroscientist and researcher</p>
<p>and teacher, et cetera,</p>
<p>and was a terrific guest on the podcast.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this paper</p>
<p>because they used so many measures</p>
<p>and they were very thorough</p>
<p>and the results were really interesting.</p>
<p>Again, this is the 13 minute a day guided meditation session.</p>
<p>I should just mention that the control group in this study</p>
<p>listened to a podcast for 13 minutes</p>
<p>that did not improve attention, memory, mood,</p>
<p>emotion regulation, et cetera, as much as meditation did,</p>
<p>which is not to say that podcasts aren&rsquo;t useful.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention which podcast they use.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was not the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>which I like to think at least increases understanding</p>
<p>of certain key concepts of science and science-based tools.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to look at the paper</p>
<p>and see which podcast they used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quite a well-known podcast,</p>
<p>which is an interesting podcast,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t change the brain in any fundamental way</p>
<p>in this 13 minute session,</p>
<p>whereas 13 minutes of daily meditation did.</p>
<p>And again, something I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>but very important to reemphasize now</p>
<p>is that they mentioned that if people in the experiment</p>
<p>meditated too close to bedtime,</p>
<p>they had trouble sleeping again,</p>
<p>which makes sense because meditation,</p>
<p>at least in its most common form</p>
<p>and the form used in this paper</p>
<p>is a focusing and refocusing exercise.</p>
<p>Falling asleep involves focusing less.</p>
<p>There are other studies, however, that have shown</p>
<p>or that asserted rather,</p>
<p>that doing two 20 minute sessions per day of meditation</p>
<p>can reduce the need for sleep.</p>
<p>Those results are debated.</p>
<p>First of all, understanding what sleep need is</p>
<p>is very individual</p>
<p>and determining what people can manage on,</p>
<p>meaning some people can manage to get by</p>
<p>with six hours of sleep, but would do better with eight.</p>
<p>Some people would actually manage probably better</p>
<p>in terms of focusing and alertness</p>
<p>if they slept a little bit less</p>
<p>because they might be waking up</p>
<p>midway through a sleep cycle.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this,</p>
<p>you can check out any one of three different episodes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>One is Master Your Sleep.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Everything is timestamped in that episode.</p>
<p>The other is Perfect Your Sleep.</p>
<p>And then of course we&rsquo;ve done episodes on sleep</p>
<p>with expert guests like Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>All of those can be found at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>in all formats, they&rsquo;re all timestamped.</p>
<p>With that said, this assertion that has been made</p>
<p>many times over and certainly in the popular press</p>
<p>that regular meditation can reduce one&rsquo;s overall sleep need</p>
<p>is controversial for the following reason.</p>
<p>Some groups find that indeed that is the case.</p>
<p>And the interpretation is that the stress reduction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s brought about by regular meditative practice,</p>
<p>and in this case, very regular,</p>
<p>tends to be one or more typically</p>
<p>two 20-minute per day meditation sessions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a lot, I think, for most people.</p>
<p>If you think about 40 minutes,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that much time overall?</p>
<p>But very few people will stick to that</p>
<p>twice a day, 20-minute meditation practice</p>
<p>very consistently.</p>
<p>Well, the idea is that the stress reduction,</p>
<p>which is clear and not debated,</p>
<p>brought about by that type of meditation practice,</p>
<p>is good at offsetting some of the cortisol increases</p>
<p>associated with reduced sleep and leading people</p>
<p>to be able to function cognitively and physically</p>
<p>better on reduced sleep than they would</p>
<p>had they not been doing the meditation practice.</p>
<p>So the simple way of putting this is that</p>
<p>if people meditate regularly, that&rsquo;s reducing stress.</p>
<p>The reduction in stress is reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>Again, cortisol is healthy,</p>
<p>but it should be restricted to early part of the day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too many peaks in cortisol,</p>
<p>especially not late in the day.</p>
<p>By meditating, you get the healthy pattern</p>
<p>of cortisol release.</p>
<p>You sort of inoculate yourself somewhat</p>
<p>against the unhealthy pattern of cortisol release.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>either the sleep that people get is deeper</p>
<p>and or the total amount of sleep that they need is reduced.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people took that result</p>
<p>and interpreted it as saying, well, if you can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>then you can just meditate.</p>
<p>So one night you don&rsquo;t sleep or you have trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>you just meditate the next day and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Well, certainly that is not supported by the literature.</p>
<p>However, there is a practice.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>on this podcast many times before,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t heard me talk about it,</p>
<p>it is a practice called yoga nidra,</p>
<p>which literally means yoga sleep.</p>
<p>It is a practice of doing not so much a focus meditation,</p>
<p>but more of a body scan,</p>
<p>focusing on the sensation of the body</p>
<p>and actually trying to turn off that prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>or reduce its activity.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra scripts can be found on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>
<p>They are paralleled by a similar practice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about called NSDR</p>
<p>or non-sleep depressed.</p>
<p>I put one out into the world,</p>
<p>a short one that&rsquo;s 10 minutes long.</p>
<p>You can just simply go to YouTube and put in NSDR</p>
<p>and my last name, Huberman.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one there.</p>
<p>Again, all of this is completely zero cost.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown</p>
<p>in a fair number of studies.</p>
<p>Not as many as been done on traditional meditation,</p>
<p>or I should say third eye centered meditation</p>
<p>or mindfulness meditation,</p>
<p>but have been shown to replenish levels</p>
<p>of certain neuromodulators like dopamine</p>
<p>and reduce cortisol, reduce a stress hormone</p>
<p>at least as much.</p>
<p>And by my read of the literature,</p>
<p>significantly more than with traditional meditation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a nice paper that we will provide a link to,</p>
<p>which is entitled,</p>
<p>Yoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep</p>
<p>in patients with chronic insomnia,</p>
<p>a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>Basically the study looks at,</p>
<p>as the title suggests, people with chronic insomnia,</p>
<p>although the results certainly carry over</p>
<p>or would carry over for people who don&rsquo;t have insomnia.</p>
<p>The key result I believe in this paper,</p>
<p>although there are many,</p>
<p>is that quote, salivary cortisol reduced statistically</p>
<p>significantly after yoga nidra.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>There was a statistically significant reduction</p>
<p>in cortisol levels, the stress hormone,</p>
<p>immediately after the yoga nidra practice</p>
<p>that we believe would be paralleled by a very similar,</p>
<p>if not equivalent practice of NSDR.</p>
<p>NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>but removes a lot of the kind of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it the sort of mystical language</p>
<p>and the intentions.</p>
<p>It focuses more on the physiology and the body scans.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that yoga nidra</p>
<p>has been around for thousands of years</p>
<p>and was certainly there before NSDR.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge that,</p>
<p>and this was brought up also in altered traits,</p>
<p>that sometimes language can be a barrier</p>
<p>toward people embracing practices.</p>
<p>In fact, this was recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn</p>
<p>when he created what he called</p>
<p>mindfulness-based stress reduction practices or MBSR,</p>
<p>which was simply mindfulness meditation to reduce stress,</p>
<p>but he called it MBSR,</p>
<p>mindfulness-based stress reduction,</p>
<p>as a way to bring it into the clinics</p>
<p>that would otherwise perhaps be averse</p>
<p>to something called mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>Again, this gets more to the sociology</p>
<p>and the cultural aspects</p>
<p>than it does to any specific utility</p>
<p>of one practice versus another.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the takeaway point.</p>
<p>If you want to get better at falling and staying asleep</p>
<p>or falling back asleep</p>
<p>if you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>or if you are generally challenged with sleep issues,</p>
<p>an excellent behavioral practice</p>
<p>for which there are terrific data</p>
<p>meaning data that show that a stress hormone,</p>
<p>cortisol, can be significantly reduced,</p>
<p>as well as certain neurotransmitters can be replenished,</p>
<p>as well as, and this is key and covered in this paper</p>
<p>that I mentioned a few moments ago on yoga nidra,</p>
<p>that the total amount of sleep that you need</p>
<p>can be reduced at least somewhat,</p>
<p>well, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice</p>
<p>done frankly any time of day is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>Whereas if your goal, I believe,</p>
<p>is to increase your ability to focus,</p>
<p>to improve your mood,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>to be able to maneuver yourself in a deliberate way</p>
<p>along that interoceptive, exteroceptive,</p>
<p>or interoceptive dissociative continuum</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about so much,</p>
<p>and to really shift your default mode network</p>
<p>from one of being a mind wanderer</p>
<p>to somebody who can focus and who frankly is happier,</p>
<p>well, then a more traditional</p>
<p>third eye center type meditation</p>
<p>or a more traditional exteroceptive focused meditation</p>
<p>would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Again, which one of those you choose,</p>
<p>either focusing inward or focusing on a point outside of you</p>
<p>again should be dictated by whether or not</p>
<p>you tend to be interoceptively biased</p>
<p>or exteroceptively biased.</p>
<p>But if you want to get better at sleeping,</p>
<p>you want to get better at falling asleep,</p>
<p>and you want to replace sleep that you&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>I put that in quotes</p>
<p>so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come after me with,</p>
<p>what would you come after me with, Matt?</p>
<p>Probably with an alarm clock and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>blankets and a pillow or something of that sort.</p>
<p>In all seriousness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that replacing sleep that we&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>is an area of research that&rsquo;s still active and ongoing,</p>
<p>but NSDR and Yoga Nidra are very promising,</p>
<p>if not downright useful for replacing sleep</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>Certainly the small amount of data that exists now</p>
<p>point to the fact that they are,</p>
<p>not the least of which is a beautiful study</p>
<p>published out of Scandinavia</p>
<p>showing that a 30-minute Yoga Nidra, aka NSDR practice,</p>
<p>can replenish levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>which puts people in a position</p>
<p>to be more action-oriented and focused, et cetera,</p>
<p>when they come out of the Yoga Nidra.</p>
<p>So certainly very useful practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of meditation.</p>
<p>We could call it meditation-ish,</p>
<p>but Yoga Nidra and NSDR are not typically</p>
<p>what people think about when we talk about meditation.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an episode about meditation.</p>
<p>The reason I bring up Yoga Nidra and NSDR</p>
<p>is that many people meditate</p>
<p>to enhance their sleep ability,</p>
<p>to reduce their total amount of sleep need.</p>
<p>It appears that meditation is probably not ideal for that</p>
<p>in comparison to Yoga Nidra and NSDR,</p>
<p>but meditation is excellent, if not superb,</p>
<p>for adjusting the default mode network</p>
<p>toward more happiness by being more mindful and present,</p>
<p>and for placing oneself in that healthy model</p>
<p>of interoceptive dissociative continuum.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of information,</p>
<p>and I like to think that I&rsquo;ve given you</p>
<p>some key decisions to make</p>
<p>in developing a meditative practice.</p>
<p>The most important one, of course,</p>
<p>being what will you do regularly?</p>
<p>And maybe you&rsquo;re somebody who just answers that question</p>
<p>by saying, look, I&rsquo;m not going to meditate regularly.</p>
<p>I just want to do the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow me to feel rested when I&rsquo;m tired,</p>
<p>and is going to allow me to adjust my state of mind</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m not where I want to be, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera.</p>
<p>And for those people, I would say a practice like NSDR</p>
<p>or Yoga Nidra will be immensely beneficial,</p>
<p>as will a more traditional form of meditation.</p>
<p>I also want to just remind everybody</p>
<p>that an app that guides meditation,</p>
<p>also with some information and some intention setting,</p>
<p>such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris,</p>
<p>can be immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly found it to be beneficial.</p>
<p>I know millions of other people have as well,</p>
<p>so I encourage you to check that out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about determining where you are</p>
<p>on these continuums of interoception and exteroception</p>
<p>in order to dictate what particular type</p>
<p>of meditation practice you should do in a given moment,</p>
<p>whether or not you should focus your vision inward</p>
<p>with eyes closed, or focus your vision</p>
<p>and your attention outward, being a key component,</p>
<p>whether or not you should do cyclic breathing,</p>
<p>which will allow your focus to be off your breathing</p>
<p>somewhat easier than if you do non-cyclic breathing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doubling up on inhales or exhales,</p>
<p>whether or not your breathing is going to be natural or not.</p>
<p>And of course, you need to determine</p>
<p>whether or not your meditation practice</p>
<p>is designed to enhance your level of focus</p>
<p>or to relax you.</p>
<p>I would say that if it&rsquo;s designed</p>
<p>to enhance your level of focus,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it won&rsquo;t be relaxing.</p>
<p>You could do slow cadence breathing,</p>
<p>third eye meditation can be very relaxing,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s a focus and refocus practice</p>
<p>where something like yoga nidra and NSDR</p>
<p>is going to be more along the lines</p>
<p>of replenishing yourself, replacing sleep that you&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>or maybe even reducing your sleep need.</p>
<p>On previous podcasts, I&rsquo;ve talked about hypnosis</p>
<p>and particularly the episode with Dr. David Spiegel,</p>
<p>our Associate Chair of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into hypnosis now,</p>
<p>but just understand that hypnosis is distinct</p>
<p>from breath work, from yoga nidra, from NSDR,</p>
<p>and from meditation,</p>
<p>even though it includes some of those components</p>
<p>like focusing your attention,</p>
<p>it involves actually directing your visual attention</p>
<p>outward than inward to go into the hypnosis,</p>
<p>it involves some breathing of a particular kind,</p>
<p>it involves a specific imagery, et cetera.</p>
<p>But hypnosis is distinct because hypnosis</p>
<p>is really designed to fix or address a specific problem,</p>
<p>whereas meditation, NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera,</p>
<p>typically are not.</p>
<p>They can help fix problems such as anxiety,</p>
<p>sleep issues, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they generally are not directed</p>
<p>toward a particular line of thinking.</p>
<p>They can be, but typically they are not,</p>
<p>whereas hypnosis almost always,</p>
<p>especially in the clinical context, not stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>but the clinical context for which there&rsquo;s a lot of research</p>
<p>to show it can, for instance, help with quitting smoking,</p>
<p>literally a quadrupling of the effectiveness</p>
<p>for smoking cessation with something like the Reverie app</p>
<p>than if people just try and go cold turkey,</p>
<p>or for reducing insomnia, or for reducing pain,</p>
<p>or for any number of things, including trauma, et cetera.</p>
<p>Hypnosis is really great at dealing with specific issues</p>
<p>and problems and tackling those.</p>
<p>Meditation tends to be focused on other things,</p>
<p>no pun intended.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing some of you are probably wondering</p>
<p>where to start, or if you&rsquo;re already an avid meditator,</p>
<p>where to go with all this information.</p>
<p>For that reason, I just wanted to offer you</p>
<p>a particular form of meditation</p>
<p>that incorporates all of the features</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about up until now</p>
<p>in a single meditation practice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a meditation practice</p>
<p>that for lack of a better name,</p>
<p>I called STB or space-time bridging.</p>
<p>And the time component has to do with a very simple fact,</p>
<p>which is when we focus our attention,</p>
<p>visual attention or otherwise,</p>
<p>on things close to or within our body,</p>
<p>we tend to be fine slicing time.</p>
<p>You can sort of think of your breath</p>
<p>as more or less the second hands on your clock of existence.</p>
<p>Whereas when we tend to focus on things far away from us,</p>
<p>we tend to parse or carve up time in bigger bins.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen a airplane flying at a distance,</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s moving very, very slowly.</p>
<p>If you were right up next to that airplane,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going five or 600 miles an hour,</p>
<p>it would go by very quickly.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>how you slice the time domain of your life</p>
<p>and your experience has everything to do with your vision.</p>
<p>And the closer things are,</p>
<p>the more finally you slice up time.</p>
<p>The more closely your attention is placed on yourself,</p>
<p>the more closely you slice up time.</p>
<p>If you focus your visual attention very far,</p>
<p>or you think about the other side of the world,</p>
<p>for instance, and you envision that,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re actually slicing time more broadly.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense.</p>
<p>Fine slicing would be like slow motion,</p>
<p>but it would have a higher frame rate.</p>
<p>Looking in the distance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually taking bigger time bins.</p>
<p>So even though things look like they&rsquo;re moving more slowly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because your fidelity,</p>
<p>your precision of measuring time is actually not as good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re only have the hour&rsquo;s hand on the clock.</p>
<p>So it seems like it moves very slowly.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense to you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a meditation practice</p>
<p>that I call space-time bridging</p>
<p>that incorporates everything that I&rsquo;ve talked about today.</p>
<p>It balances interoception and exteroception.</p>
<p>It balances interoception and dissociation.</p>
<p>And it crosses the various time domains</p>
<p>that the brain can encompass using vision.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very simple meditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve been doing for years,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that we&rsquo;re starting to do some research on,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to share with you</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s actually quite fun</p>
<p>and can be quite informative.</p>
<p>In fact, people have told me</p>
<p>that it can even lead to some interesting insights,</p>
<p>both during the meditation and outside the meditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>What you do, ideally you would do this outside</p>
<p>or at a window,</p>
<p>but what you do is you essentially close your eyes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do this now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to close my eyes and do the meditation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll describe it.</p>
<p>You close your eyes and you focus your attention</p>
<p>either on your third eye center or your breathing.</p>
<p>And you try and put 100% of your perceptual awareness</p>
<p>onto your breathing or your third eye center</p>
<p>for the duration of three breaths.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re 100% or trying to be 100% in interoception.</p>
<p>Then you open your eyes.</p>
<p>You focus on the surface of your body someplace.</p>
<p>I find that I&rsquo;m holding out my hand at sort of arms distance</p>
<p>and focusing on the palm of my hand</p>
<p>and focusing there visually.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m splitting my attention now between my hand</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also going to pay attention to my breath</p>
<p>for the duration of three full inhales and exhales</p>
<p>while also focusing on my hand.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re splitting interoception and exteroception</p>
<p>as best you can about 50-50.</p>
<p>Then you subsequently look at some location</p>
<p>in your immediate environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away.</p>
<p>And you focus your attention on that location</p>
<p>while also splitting your attention</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re still paying attention to your breathing.</p>
<p>You do that for the duration of three breaths.</p>
<p>But now you are in exteroception and interoception.</p>
<p>Then you focus your attention at some distance further away,</p>
<p>maybe the furthest distance you can see.</p>
<p>Now, this is why it&rsquo;s useful to do out of a window</p>
<p>or on a balcony or outdoors.</p>
<p>You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon,</p>
<p>some furthest point for the duration of three breaths</p>
<p>while also paying attention to your breathing</p>
<p>and sort of imagine a bridge between the two</p>
<p>if you find it to be challenging to focus on both.</p>
<p>And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky,</p>
<p>but then what you actually focus on is the fact,</p>
<p>and this is not an imaginary thing,</p>
<p>this is a fact that you are a tiny speck</p>
<p>on this big ball that&rsquo;s floating out in space, right?</p>
<p>The earth that&rsquo;s floating out in space.</p>
<p>And you try and focus on your three breaths</p>
<p>while also acknowledging that you are a small body,</p>
<p>literally, on this very seemingly large body, the earth,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s floating in a much larger,</p>
<p>larger expansive place, the universe.</p>
<p>And you do that for three breaths.</p>
<p>And then you close your eyes</p>
<p>and you go right back into interoception.</p>
<p>And you might want to, and you do that for three breaths.</p>
<p>You focus on your interoception for three breaths.</p>
<p>And you might want to march through</p>
<p>these different locations a few times</p>
<p>or back and forth if you like,</p>
<p>but typically I will just do it for one segment</p>
<p>at pure interoception, palm of hand,</p>
<p>some distance in front of me, horizon,</p>
<p>whole globe, universe thing, back into body, et cetera.</p>
<p>Why is this useful?</p>
<p>Why would this be useful?</p>
<p>Why is it at all interesting?</p>
<p>Or is this just some crazy idea?</p>
<p>Well, the reason it&rsquo;s useful, I believe,</p>
<p>is that it has you deliberately step your awareness,</p>
<p>your perception through every position</p>
<p>along that interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum.</p>
<p>Now I did say to remain connected to,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ll say in the yoga classes, aware of,</p>
<p>I guess would be the more scientific way to state it,</p>
<p>aware of one&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>But if you wanted, you could actually try</p>
<p>and put your awareness completely outside yourself.</p>
<p>But most people will find that challenging to do</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re already paying attention to their breath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to do.</p>
<p>So I find it easier to just split my awareness</p>
<p>from interoception to exteroception.</p>
<p>But by stepping through these different locations</p>
<p>and then deliberately placing your perception,</p>
<p>your awareness back into pure interoception,</p>
<p>what you do is you essentially are practicing</p>
<p>or exercising this incredible ability</p>
<p>that the human mind has</p>
<p>to deliberately place your perception</p>
<p>at specific locations</p>
<p>along the interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum.</p>
<p>And I think this is very useful</p>
<p>because many of us, including myself,</p>
<p>tend to get locked at one location along that continuum.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re scrolling your phone</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>you may forget about your bodily sensations,</p>
<p>but you generally forget about other things</p>
<p>going on in the world.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re very focused on things out in the world,</p>
<p>you oftentimes can forget about your internal sensations</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on internally.</p>
<p>And being functional in work, in life, in relationship,</p>
<p>and in all aspects, including your ability to fall asleep,</p>
<p>involves stepping yourself along these different locations,</p>
<p>which again, are not just physical locations</p>
<p>of third eye center, or your breathing,</p>
<p>or your hand, or horizon.</p>
<p>Those are just stations within space.</p>
<p>But remember, each one of those,</p>
<p>just by way of how your visual system</p>
<p>and the time domain are interlocked with one another,</p>
<p>sets your mind in a particular time domain.</p>
<p>And so much of what involves being a functional human being</p>
<p>involves dynamically adjusting our attention</p>
<p>from what we are doing on our computer</p>
<p>to a question somebody asks, and then back again.</p>
<p>Or from text messaging to listening to a lecture</p>
<p>or a podcast.</p>
<p>Or from listening to a lecture or podcast,</p>
<p>and then going back into a mode of commuting,</p>
<p>but making that commute either relaxing,</p>
<p>or maybe you do work on your commute,</p>
<p>or connect with family or friends, et cetera.</p>
<p>So much of the fatigue of life,</p>
<p>and the, I should say, the maladaptive behaviors</p>
<p>and emotions that show up in life,</p>
<p>are really not about any set of behaviors or emotions</p>
<p>being wrong or right,</p>
<p>but rather inappropriately matched</p>
<p>to the space-time domain that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>which again is just fancy nerd speak for saying,</p>
<p>being present and being mindful</p>
<p>is a wonderful by-product of a meditation practice,</p>
<p>but it is but one of those stations</p>
<p>along that space-time continuum.</p>
<p>The key element here is to step yourself</p>
<p>through a practice deliberately</p>
<p>so that you are flexibly and dynamically able</p>
<p>to engage in conversation, then disengage and focus.</p>
<p>Or focus and then disengage from the work you&rsquo;re focusing on</p>
<p>and actually have a conversation or be in the world</p>
<p>and move out of that interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>to one in which you are dynamically engaged</p>
<p>with the things around you.</p>
<p>I realize this might sound a little bit vague.</p>
<p>For that reason, I encourage you</p>
<p>not to think about it too much,</p>
<p>but rather to try the practice,</p>
<p>see if it works for you.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I think it is a good one for people that find</p>
<p>that a third eye center or breathing focus</p>
<p>interoceptive meditation might be enjoyable to them</p>
<p>or very beneficial to them,</p>
<p>but they might want to try something new.</p>
<p>And other people who might find that</p>
<p>that tends to put them too much in their own head.</p>
<p>I think it also ought to be very useful for people</p>
<p>that tend to be overly exteroceptive,</p>
<p>more in the dissociative end of the continuum,</p>
<p>and need to bring in a bit more of interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>but either can&rsquo;t do that or uncomfortable doing that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re simply not interested in</p>
<p>or comfortable with feeling so much of their internal state</p>
<p>because that can either be overwhelming</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s just simply not the way they want to feel.</p>
<p>Now, as we round up,</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge that there are an enormous number</p>
<p>of rooms within the house,</p>
<p>or rather I should say within the castle that is meditation,</p>
<p>including for instance, intention setting and mantras</p>
<p>and an enormous number of different features</p>
<p>of meditation practices</p>
<p>that we simply did not have time to go into</p>
<p>and or for which the research on</p>
<p>is not completely ironed out yet.</p>
<p>And for that reason, in future episodes,</p>
<p>not long from now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be sitting down with experts in meditation</p>
<p>that include neuroscientists and clinicians,</p>
<p>but other experts in meditation</p>
<p>that certainly are versed in those topics</p>
<p>and where they can&rsquo;t point to specific research studies</p>
<p>can certainly point us toward the utility of things</p>
<p>like mantras and intentions</p>
<p>as they relate to getting the most</p>
<p>out of a meditative practice.</p>
<p>So I eagerly await those conversations</p>
<p>and I hope you&rsquo;ll join me for those as well.</p>

<p>And all three of those places,</p>
<p>I cover science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Thanks again for joining me for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>about the science and practice of meditation.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
