    <p>Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in</p>
<p>podcast, your favorite podcast. And a lot of a lot of topics on</p>
<p>the docket, including, well, we&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>Tons of stuff to talk about not just politics, but a lot of tech</p>
<p>news. You do sound really hung over today. J. Cal, you sound</p>
<p>like an old man that&rsquo;s been smoking cigarettes for three</p>
<p>weeks. You sound wrecked. How big was your night last night?</p>
<p>Admit it. I didn&rsquo;t go that big. On a scale of one to Charlie</p>
<p>Sheen, it was like a six. There&rsquo;s like a Martin Sheen in</p>
<p>his 30s. What does that mean? One to Charlie? We had a couple</p>
<p>of beverages. I&rsquo;m sorry, on a scale of one to Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been past the one in my life. So what</p>
<p>is a six? A six is like, you know, Paris Hilton, you know,</p>
<p>in her heyday, or like Lindsay Lohan in Hollywood in the 90s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, like a good time, but not crazy. Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they have to go to rehab?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I&rsquo;m super high functioning. Let me tell you</p>
<p>something. Charlie Sheen cannot. Oh, it was just like Lindsay</p>
<p>Lohan. Wait, Lindsay Lohan, the one who went to rehab like five</p>
<p>times. Like what are you talking about? Yeah, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>six.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know what seven is.</p>
<p>Joining us, of course, the queen of quinoa is here. The</p>
<p>thriller from the Milla Valley. He puts the eye in anxiety. He</p>
<p>got his degree from his Google pedigree, the Sultan of Science,</p>
<p>David Freeberg with us again.</p>
<p>All right, next up, of course, is czar of ARR. He perfected the</p>
<p>flywheel with his boy Peter Thiel. LPs, don&rsquo;t be nervous</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s only investing in software as a service. The</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s biggest asshole, the Rain Man himself, David Sachs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a sasshole. Wait, you call me a sasshole? A sasshole. That</p>
<p>might stick. I don&rsquo;t know. I feel like this might be heading</p>
<p>towards kind of like a high school talent show kind of</p>
<p>episode. But yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>And finally, the king of SPACs himself, the guru of growth. He</p>
<p>puts the dick in dictator. He&rsquo;s going to upset her with his</p>
<p>sweater. Jamath Palihapitiya. All right, boys. I&rsquo;m just letting</p>
<p>the audience know I can&rsquo;t keep this up every week.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. It&rsquo;s become a very anticipated new feature of the</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>It is. It&rsquo;s a new feature. But you know, I forgot we had like</p>
<p>wet your beak and, you know, all this stuff and all these-</p>
<p>It ebbs and flows. We come up with new things.</p>
<p>It ebbs and flows. We come up with new things. All right,</p>
<p>listen, just a quick programming update. All In Summit sold out,</p>
<p>basically. It&rsquo;s going to be a great show. We got about a</p>
<p>dozen speakers lined up, all kinds of great folks. And three</p>
<p>great parties I want to highlight. Monday, Sunday night</p>
<p>will be the poker tournament. That&rsquo;s going to be our</p>
<p>Goodfellas, Godfather kind of theme, dressed to impress the</p>
<p>family. Night number two, Monday night, is going to be our</p>
<p>Havana White Party. Wear your best linens and whites. And then</p>
<p>closing night party on Tuesday night is going to be our Miami</p>
<p>Vice Big 80s party. Neon and t-shirts under suits. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a hell of a party.</p>
<p>2,999,700 people don&rsquo;t give a shit about what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about right now. There&rsquo;s like maybe 300 people that are going</p>
<p>to go to this party that you&rsquo;re throwing and they&rsquo;re enjoying</p>
<p>it. 700 tickets, I think there&rsquo;s gonna be 700 tickets</p>
<p>issued and there&rsquo;ll be probably 400 people at the party. So</p>
<p>they were pretty good parties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the party business here at the All In pod.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the world needs some good parties. In my</p>
<p>opinion, it&rsquo;s gonna be three back to back great parties. And</p>
<p>the theme of the conference is the problem I most want to solve</p>
<p>in the world or the problem I most want to see solved in the</p>
<p>world. So we&rsquo;re asking every speaker to think about that. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to kind of talk about the world&rsquo;s biggest</p>
<p>problems and then who actually wants to solve them.</p>
<p>The world needs more parties.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing. That&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be my 10 minute talk. My TED talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been watching the WeWork show. Have you guys</p>
<p>been watching it on Apple TV plus? Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. Elevating</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s Jared Leto is so freaking good in as that</p>
<p>character, by the way. Yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible. He got to get</p>
<p>an Emmy like elevating the world&rsquo;s consciousness as the</p>
<p>mission and then just throw parties is the way to do it.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re you really get that vibe like yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>aspirational. You could elevate the world&rsquo;s consciousness with</p>
<p>your with your summits. I told Bill pocketing millions of</p>
<p>dollars. It&rsquo;s not going to make a profit. Whatever profit it</p>
<p>makes is going to go to Chamath Star Chamber 50 person</p>
<p>conference he&rsquo;s doing with the all in brand. So everybody</p>
<p>gets to leverage the brand. Yeah, first you did it sacks</p>
<p>with your call in. Now I&rsquo;m doing it with the summit. Chamath&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do what his think tank and I&rsquo;m not going to do it.</p>
<p>Coming soon from Friedberg, the all in Munich special lose</p>
<p>weight like your besties. He&rsquo;s going to the it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>all in brand that allows you to lose weight in the following</p>
<p>way. He brings his best vegan chef to you. Oh yeah. He spins</p>
<p>up some **** Tempe garbage. Tempe and and vegan shakes. Your</p>
<p>favorite Chamath. It&rsquo;s double **** yuck. Right. Yes. You</p>
<p>vomit after you eat it. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in a caloric deficit for</p>
<p>the month that that person refuses to leave your house.</p>
<p>Boom. You lose weight. Everything&rsquo;s solved. You lose</p>
<p>weight. They&rsquo;re like, hey, want some quinoa? You&rsquo;re like, no.</p>
<p>And then you lose weight. No. That&rsquo;s pretty. Give me. Give me</p>
<p>my olive infused beef. Please. The olive infused beef. No, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry. Not olive infused. Olive fat. These beef only ate</p>
<p>olives, guys. Right. And then we murder them and ate them. You</p>
<p>know, you know, you guys are like, you&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>great life. Yeah. You guys need you guys need to elevate your</p>
<p>consciousness, okay? And have a party. Let&rsquo;s go. We need to get</p>
<p>some morels and some chickens and make some. Yesterday, we</p>
<p>had morels. Sean made morels. White asparagus with morels for</p>
<p>you. Mm. Mm. So good. So good. The morel season has started.</p>
<p>Everybody enjoy it. Lots of different news this week. You</p>
<p>guys appeal. You guys appeal to the common man. The morel</p>
<p>season has started. Morels aren&rsquo;t that expensive. Tempe is</p>
<p>more expensive than both quinoa and morels. 100%. That vegan</p>
<p>**** is way more expensive than normal people. Alright, listen.</p>
<p>Uh we have to elevate the world&rsquo;s consumption of steak</p>
<p>and meats. Um I think a good place to start is we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>talking. By the way, by the way, have you guys ever looked</p>
<p>at on the back of any carton of oat milk? How much chemical</p>
<p>nonsense is in that stuff? Yeah. Can that really be, can</p>
<p>that really be good for you? No. You know what I want? Oh my</p>
<p>god. Give me. Where&rsquo;s the, where&rsquo;s the oat milk that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>oats and water? Doesn&rsquo;t exist. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s like soy</p>
<p>lexithin, xanthan gum, like is that stuff can&rsquo;t be good for</p>
<p>you? You know, Saks drinks and a twelve ounce glass of milk</p>
<p>with every dinner. They just drinks it. By the way, the</p>
<p>almond, the almond milk at like the Whole Foods riddled with</p>
<p>sugar and all this other nonsensical chemicals as well.</p>
<p>Man, I mean, I mean, people trash milk, I get it but like</p>
<p>uh and as if you&rsquo;re lactose intolerant, I understand you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a pinch but why go to an alternative milk that is just</p>
<p>riddled with just all of this terrible, terrible stuff? You</p>
<p>know, Saks used to love to eat breeches so much that whenever</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have a party, somebody would bring the blocks with the</p>
<p>with the with the wheel of brie. He would literally eat an</p>
<p>entire brie wheel on brown sugar. No, they would put the</p>
<p>brown sugar on top. They would belt it and Saks, Freebrook,</p>
<p>Saks is eating an entire brick of brie in front of us. Oh my</p>
<p>lord. What was the origin of your brie obsession, Saks?</p>
<p>Stanford. I&rsquo;ve been to Stanford. You just at some point</p>
<p>became a francophile. Yeah. The last guy I would think that</p>
<p>would eat brie. What&rsquo;s the matter? You just don&rsquo;t have, I</p>
<p>mean, what about cheddar? A great American cheese? No, you</p>
<p>just prefer the French, huh? Yeah, you know. You still got</p>
<p>that fetish for I gotta go. Yeah, we got shit to do. I got</p>
<p>45 minutes. Saks, Saks, is that fermented kombucha? Stop. Stop.</p>
<p>This is just plain iced tea. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just good to be</p>
<p>normal. Oh, oh, you&rsquo;re back on trying to catch up? Trying to</p>
<p>catch up? Okay, here we go. Listen, we&rsquo;ve been talking a</p>
<p>little bit about the contraction in tech, the growth</p>
<p>stocks having their multiples lowered, and we knew this was</p>
<p>coming, but it&rsquo;s been a horrible week for large companies</p>
<p>starting the layoffs. We knew this was coming. We predicted</p>
<p>it probably six months ago. Fast.com is a one-click checkout</p>
<p>startup. Fast.co, they announced they&rsquo;re shutting down on</p>
<p>Tuesday, this after the company grew to 450 employees and</p>
<p>generated reported $600,000 in revenue. I think that their</p>
<p>employees could have made more money if they did one door dash</p>
<p>a day delivery. At its peak, Fast was burning $10 million a</p>
<p>month according to reports. I think the information got most</p>
<p>of this information while only generating about 50k a month in</p>
<p>revenue. Their $102 million Series B was led by Stripe in</p>
<p>January of 2021. Company raised $124 million in total. Also</p>
<p>better.com, which we talked about, you remember, they had</p>
<p>their horrific, cringeworthy founder lay off a bunch of</p>
<p>employees over zoom. And they laid off 900 people December</p>
<p>1 3000 people on March 8, according to TechCrunch. For the</p>
<p>5000 remaining employees on April 5, better.com offer</p>
<p>corporate and product design and engineering employees the</p>
<p>opportunity to voluntarily resign in exchange for 60 days</p>
<p>paid severance and health insurance coverage. Better CEOs</p>
<p>Vishal Garg, hopefully I&rsquo;m not correct noted the uncertain</p>
<p>mortgage market conditions of the last couple of weeks have</p>
<p>created an exceedingly challenging operating</p>
<p>environment for many companies in our industry. And then going</p>
<p>to go puff, which, you know, I had the founder on this week at</p>
<p>startups, and he&rsquo;s a pretty good, you know, like pretty</p>
<p>realistic about the margins in that business. They&rsquo;re making a</p>
<p>modest cut of 3% of their 15,000 staff seems like a</p>
<p>reasonable thing to do, given how the market has changed. But</p>
<p>again, their valuation was absurd. 1.5 billion at 40 at a</p>
<p>$40 billion valuation in December. Chamathi predicted a</p>
<p>lot of this, and that people would have to sharpen their</p>
<p>pencils. We had a discussion about this, you know, the good</p>
<p>times are our IP. What&rsquo;s your take? Is this the the beginning</p>
<p>of the end? The middle? Where are we at in the cycle? And</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reasonable thing for founders to do here?</p>
<p>I think so we probably should take the the macro and then</p>
<p>boil it down to the startup. So at the at the macro level, I</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re playing a very dangerous game of chicken with</p>
<p>the Fed. And you can kind of summarize it in the following</p>
<p>way, which is that, you know, three or four months ago, we</p>
<p>only thought that there was going to be a handful of</p>
<p>interest rate increases. And increasingly, what has happened</p>
<p>the market has remained so resilient, that the Fed is sort</p>
<p>of put out more and more data as the data has justified them</p>
<p>being a lot more aggressive. And it kind of crescendoed this</p>
<p>past week, where they basically said, Listen, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to move by 50 basis point increments for the foreseeable</p>
<p>two or three rate hikes, and we&rsquo;re going to start</p>
<p>quantitative tightening. What does that mean? That means that</p>
<p>instead of basically printing money and coming in and buying</p>
<p>securities from the market, right? So what happens when they</p>
<p>enter the market with money that they literally do print, and buy</p>
<p>your bonds, they&rsquo;re giving you cash in return. And typically</p>
<p>what that has led to is the inflation of all assets, right?</p>
<p>equity assets have gone up, bond assets have gone up, because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just nothing else to buy. When quantitative</p>
<p>tightening happens, they reverse that. And what they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do is about $95 billion a month of the opposite action, which</p>
<p>means they&rsquo;re taking money out of the system, right? Or in this</p>
<p>case, what they&rsquo;re going to do is they&rsquo;re going to let a bunch</p>
<p>of maturities roll off and not rot, not renew them. Okay, so</p>
<p>why is this important? Well, it&rsquo;s important because, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re still 4% from the highs. So we have 7% inflation,</p>
<p>we have all this crazy stuff happening, we have a war, you</p>
<p>know, going on, we have massive price issues, we have supply</p>
<p>demand issues, and the market keeps shaking it off. So I think</p>
<p>what the Fed is going to do is get even more aggressive, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to probably see, you know, a lot of 50s, maybe even a 75</p>
<p>point hike, you probably are going to see them, you know,</p>
<p>even ratchet up quantitative tightening, until there is a bit</p>
<p>of a bloodletting in the equity market. They need to see that</p>
<p>the markets crack.</p>
<p>And so they literally need to see what percentage drawdown or</p>
<p>just to go sideways, what do they need to see in order to</p>
<p>or is it inflation coming down a couple of points?</p>
<p>Well, the problem that we suffer from is that they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>look at the highest level indexes, right? They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking at single stocks. And so when they like when you and I</p>
<p>think this market is down 4%, we don&rsquo;t feel that because some of</p>
<p>our companies are down 50 and 60%. Right. But that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all focused on high tech growth. But they look at the</p>
<p>broad indices and the broad indices have held up really</p>
<p>well. And mostly, it&rsquo;s because you know, if you look inside the</p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 40% of every dollar is, you know, Apple, Amazon, you</p>
<p>know, Microsoft, etc, Tesla. So we&rsquo;re in a situation where I</p>
<p>think until the Fed see that there&rsquo;s a massive trading of</p>
<p>liquidity, which means like you see these indices crack big time</p>
<p>35 3600 in the S&amp;P, they&rsquo;re just going to keep ratcheting things</p>
<p>up. As it comes all the way down to our companies in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley and tech. What that means is like you have to start</p>
<p>planning for the worst. And I think the worst means that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an 18 month period where you cannot raise money</p>
<p>on your terms, you have to raise money on the market terms. And</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re not in a position to show good growth over these</p>
<p>next two years, I would encourage you to just get your</p>
<p>balance sheet in order to wait it out.</p>
<p>Saks nuclear winner is a possibility here markets for</p>
<p>startups. Raising money, again, a strong saying could be on the</p>
<p>terms of the capital allocators. What what&rsquo;s your advice to</p>
<p>founders? What are you seeing in the boardrooms that you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the board of? And if you were running one of these high growth</p>
<p>companies for the past year, what are the first two or three</p>
<p>things you do?</p>
<p>I mean, the first thing you got to do is look at your burn</p>
<p>multiple. I mean, how much are you burning relative to how</p>
<p>much incremental error are you generating, you look at fast,</p>
<p>they raised 120 million, what, like a year ago, that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of money now. So they burnt 10 million months, like you</p>
<p>said, here&rsquo;s the crazy thing. If they just slammed on the</p>
<p>brakes three or four months ago, when we were talking on the</p>
<p>spot about the coming downturn, they could still have $30</p>
<p>million in the bank, that&rsquo;s a lot of money. The only reason</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot of money is because they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>burning 100 million over the past year. But objectively $30</p>
<p>million is a gross series B, which is actually a lot of money</p>
<p>for a company that only has 100,000 in revenue. So they</p>
<p>could have saved that company if they had slammed on the brakes</p>
<p>three months ago, and rationalize the cost structure,</p>
<p>and they did it. So they hit the wall at 100 miles an hour</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s responsible when something like that happens, David,</p>
<p>because you we&rsquo;ve all seen it. What is the suspension of</p>
<p>disbelief that creates this kind of stupidity?</p>
<p>That I mean, that&rsquo;s what it is. I mean, you&rsquo;ve got you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>people who are kind of drinking the Kool Aid and there&rsquo;s nobody</p>
<p>advising them to stop or if there is they&rsquo;re not listening.</p>
<p>I mean, look, PayPal had this situation back in 2000, the</p>
<p>year 2000. Right after the.com crash, we were burning $10</p>
<p>million a month like fast, we had no revenue and no business</p>
<p>model. Okay, we had said that the service would be always</p>
<p>free. We had four months basically of life, and we</p>
<p>pulled up on the throttle. And what we did is we basically</p>
<p>introduced paid accounts, we started charging transaction</p>
<p>fees, and we cut the cost structure of the company. And</p>
<p>we made that last $40 million last a lot longer than four</p>
<p>months. It lasted until we could then do another fundraise</p>
<p>the following year. And we were able to then raise with good</p>
<p>numbers, real revenue, a business model, etc. So, you</p>
<p>know, and that was because we were just paying attention to</p>
<p>the changing environment, the world had changed from sort of</p>
<p>the pre.com crash, you know, 1999, your business model</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter, your margins didn&rsquo;t matter, revenue didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter, none of that stuff mattered. All that mattered was</p>
<p>growth. But by, you know, mid 2000, everything had changed. So</p>
<p>you have to be attuned to what the fundraising environment is</p>
<p>looking like. And if you&rsquo;re a high burn company right now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not generating a lot of revenue to go along with it,</p>
<p>you better slam on the brakes and rationalize your cost</p>
<p>structure before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>David, tell me like, what do you think is going on in this</p>
<p>board meeting? I mean, like, this is a group of incompetent</p>
<p>incompetence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know who&rsquo;s on the board, because Stripe led two</p>
<p>rounds, I think. And so</p>
<p>is that part of it, David, that you and listen, we all love</p>
<p>Stripe. It&rsquo;s a great company. It&rsquo;s a legendary company. But</p>
<p>one of the reasons we don&rsquo;t like to have strategics is maybe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not thinking the same as a proper capital allocator.</p>
<p>And for them, this is peanuts.</p>
<p>Right, exactly. No, look, the reason why a strategic investor,</p>
<p>I think the reason why a strategic investor invests is</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s strategic for them. I mean, it was in stripes</p>
<p>interest to try and back a winner in the whole e commerce</p>
<p>checkout line, sort of payment space. And so they did that. And</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they had a board seat. And so no one was</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t understand that strategic decision, because</p>
<p>I suspect the rationale somewhere internally, and in</p>
<p>Stripe, which is pretty flawed is, hey, we can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>ourselves. Because if we did, we will be competing with our</p>
<p>customers. But picking a winner and putting $120 million is</p>
<p>tantamount to the same thing. So I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, right? And Stripe raised</p>
<p>money at what $9500 billion valuation. So look, it all flows</p>
<p>down from, you know, the frothiness at the peak.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying I think I would have, it would have been much</p>
<p>more credible for Stripe to say this is a critical piece of the</p>
<p>infrastructure and value chain and payments that we want to</p>
<p>own. So we&rsquo;re just going to go and put some of our better</p>
<p>engineers as like a, you know, side project and see if we can</p>
<p>tack away at something that works. I mean, I think a lot of</p>
<p>people would have adopted it.</p>
<p>But I guess there was a clear stripe was on the board index</p>
<p>was okay. Okay, that&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, those are</p>
<p>some good investors. There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a couple of people on</p>
<p>the board index and who else,</p>
<p>according to crunchbase stripe was on the board, a business</p>
<p>development person from their index was on the board. And Dom</p>
<p>the founder, and looks like Brian sugar, who I know, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an angel investor and a founder. But who knows if that&rsquo;s outdated</p>
<p>information in crunchbase.</p>
<p>Remember when Philip Kaplan used to run a website called fucked</p>
<p>company?</p>
<p>Absolutely. A friend of mine. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you want to tell the fuck company story? Jake out for all</p>
<p>the people that have no, I mean,</p>
<p>basically, what happened was.com, the.com world was</p>
<p>imploding, all the employees didn&rsquo;t have a voice, there was</p>
<p>no social media at the time, there was no blogs at the time.</p>
<p>The only thing you could really publish on the in the world was</p>
<p>like a geocities page, you could put up a homepage, if you knew</p>
<p>how to do HTML is even pre my space. And so a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Phil Kaplan, who does a very successful company called</p>
<p>distro kid now started fuck company. And it was a message</p>
<p>board. And what he basically let people do was, he would write</p>
<p>three headlines, one sentence each kind of like before Reddit</p>
<p>existed, where you just put a one line hit, and then there</p>
<p>was comments underneath them, they&rsquo;d say, this company, we</p>
<p>just got an email, this company&rsquo;s laying off people, and</p>
<p>he would beat all the news stories to the layoffs, because</p>
<p>he would just run with any email that came in. And then</p>
<p>people would detail and savage the management of those</p>
<p>companies underneath that for malfeasance and explain exactly</p>
<p>how ridiculous the spending was in that era where people were</p>
<p>burning money like drunken sellers.</p>
<p>I think this time around, it&rsquo;s probably important for</p>
<p>employees to understand a couple things. One is like, who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing, right? So like companies</p>
<p>that are making layoffs, those are those are happening, they</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t get punished for that. But you got to think like</p>
<p>the fiduciaries that are ripping this money. And I mean, do you</p>
<p>really want to be the person that goes to work at a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s backed by these folks in round two? I mean, that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>signal like, like the opposite is always been a signal, right?</p>
<p>Meaning when Mike Moritz makes an investment, we all pay</p>
<p>attention. Because we all think, wow, there&rsquo;s a picker, you</p>
<p>know. And he did that with Stripe. And with so many other,</p>
<p>you know, great companies. And so the likelihood of an employee</p>
<p>wanting to work for a Mike Moritz backed company or Mike</p>
<p>Moritz governed company is very high, right? Same thing with</p>
<p>Gurley&rsquo;s, you know, same thing with a lot of a lot of really,</p>
<p>really good investors, john door. But the opposite should</p>
<p>also be true, then, because if it if you really want to work</p>
<p>for a Peter Thiel back company, you should probably not work for</p>
<p>one of these companies, where these folks were just completely</p>
<p>absent are also governing the board. Because that just means</p>
<p>like nobody knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had proper governance for a long time in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. So I mean, I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re weak, we</p>
<p>crashed, we crashed and the dropout were, in some ways about</p>
<p>incompetent boards, both of those TV shows.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I definitely see this. You know, I think you guys</p>
<p>know the the incentive for a traditional venture capitalist</p>
<p>that that that maybe isn&rsquo;t, you know, motivated by improving</p>
<p>their craft. But they&rsquo;re motivated, you know,</p>
<p>incentivized primarily by making money is to raise more</p>
<p>capital and getting more deals. And as you guys know, like every</p>
<p>venture firm has maybe one or two superstars. And then they</p>
<p>fill out the ranks and hire a bunch of folks who are maybe not</p>
<p>superstars. Or they don&rsquo;t pay as much attention, you know, it</p>
<p>used to be maybe a VC would sit on a handful of boards. And now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re the board representative for 12 companies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a, you know, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to provide</p>
<p>quality time and service to and support to the CEO and the</p>
<p>company. And more importantly, as you guys point out, like not</p>
<p>provide good governance and governance isn&rsquo;t just about are</p>
<p>you signing the docu signs as they come in to approve stuff.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about actually critiquing the business strategy</p>
<p>with the CEO at the board discussion, critiquing the</p>
<p>spending, reviewing the financial plan, making sure that</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s aligned that this makes sense in this funding</p>
<p>environment to continue to do this work. And I don&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>a lot. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys. But I see a lot of VCs</p>
<p>either handling to the CEO, because we have founder culture,</p>
<p>hysteria in Silicon Valley, where it&rsquo;s true, the best</p>
<p>founders make 1000x returns, and that&rsquo;s it. But that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily mean that the rest of the businesses should be left</p>
<p>to their own vices, just because there are a few ultra successful</p>
<p>founders that there are a lot of businesses that actually need</p>
<p>governance in order to achieve outcomes. And I see that lacking</p>
<p>heavily in Silicon Valley, because the VCs are more</p>
<p>incentivized to raise more money to make more investments</p>
<p>and then pay less attention and just go raise the next fund.</p>
<p>Well, I think I think you said the key thing. There are really</p>
<p>very few star pickers in our business. It takes decades to</p>
<p>really prove that out. And, and those people, but those people</p>
<p>that are real pickers, I don&rsquo;t think put up with bullshit from</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not just pickers, like so john door was deeply involved</p>
<p>in Google in the early days, like, you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>simplifying our job. But what I&rsquo;m saying is our job, okay, at</p>
<p>the end of the day is we&rsquo;re picking, okay. And then once you</p>
<p>pick, you got to do the work. If you pick poorly, and you do</p>
<p>the same amount of work, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Nobody&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to remember you. Yeah, what ends what ends up happening is</p>
<p>the VC flushes the deal, because it&rsquo;s not going to be the 100</p>
<p>bagger, they don&rsquo;t pay as much attention, they let the thing</p>
<p>right into the sunset. And they&rsquo;re moving on to the next</p>
<p>thing. But there is still a duty and a responsibility, I think,</p>
<p>to the shareholders and the employees of that company, to</p>
<p>you know, do what Saks mentioned, which is can you</p>
<p>reduce burn under these circumstances? And can you</p>
<p>actively engage as a board member to encourage leadership</p>
<p>to do that. And that doesn&rsquo;t happen. You said the key thing,</p>
<p>there are few practitioners that really have the gravitas to</p>
<p>actually enforce those decisions. So, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason why in during the great financial crisis, there</p>
<p>was only one organization that even had the courage, forget</p>
<p>whether it was right or wrong at the time to even write the</p>
<p>RIP good times deck, right? It was Sequoia, nobody else dared</p>
<p>to even put that on a page, let alone give it to all of their</p>
<p>companies, knowing that it would leak less they&rsquo;d be wrong. And</p>
<p>the reason Sequoia could do it is they&rsquo;re looking at a 40 year</p>
<p>franchise and saying the integrity of our franchise is</p>
<p>at stake, we need to keep doing what we&rsquo;ve done before. And what</p>
<p>it did, I think, in that case was pulled along a bunch of</p>
<p>folks that were not as good as the top few folks. And it helped</p>
<p>reorganize because if you see the three or four years after</p>
<p>that GFC deck, Sequoia flush that whole business, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entire turnover of that team. And so I think what</p>
<p>it speaks to is, and we talked about this in a few episodes</p>
<p>ago, if you&rsquo;re seeking out AUM, you&rsquo;re going to hire a very</p>
<p>different kind of person than if you&rsquo;re helping trying to help</p>
<p>build companies. And the difference is that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to raise AUM, your customer is not the company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the customer is the LP. And what the LP wants to do is be</p>
<p>able to write their investment memo and not get fired. And the</p>
<p>way that you do that is by pointing to the team and saying,</p>
<p>well, this person worked at this company, this person was a VP</p>
<p>of that company. And it seems credible. But between but being</p>
<p>able to invest and being able to actually be a good operator</p>
<p>is so different.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll also say one thing that&rsquo;s important, you know, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like this celebration, or sorry, the mockery and</p>
<p>entertainment that comes from failure, I, I thought fuck</p>
<p>company. Like I was young when it when it was out, and you</p>
<p>know, I would read it and kind of giggle at the stupid</p>
<p>companies that got funding. You know, but to me, it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the kind of thing that could should kind of be funny or</p>
<p>laughed at, or even to mock failed companies. I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cynical. I think the capital that&rsquo;s available in the markets</p>
<p>today to support the building.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t that that&rsquo;s not what fuck company was. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was people taking potshots as much as there was a</p>
<p>lot of that. Oh, yeah, there was a lot of that. And because</p>
<p>yeah, there was a</p>
<p>thing to admit. But would you admit in fairness that there was</p>
<p>a lot of people telling the truth?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, totally. No, no, but but but a lot of it was</p>
<p>like this mockery. Like, can you believe this shit even</p>
<p>existed? Yada, yada. And the cynicism, I think, you know,</p>
<p>kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s it stales out the opportunity for</p>
<p>capital to support, you know, new new ventures, new</p>
<p>initiatives like this. You know, I also think that these</p>
<p>businesses that today are looking to raise capital that</p>
<p>are, you know, let&rsquo;s call them good businesses, they have a</p>
<p>good opportunity, they&rsquo;re going to be challenged in a</p>
<p>marketplace where everyone is cynical. And I&rsquo;ll say, like,</p>
<p>scarcity breeds success, when there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of venture</p>
<p>money. And there were only a, you know, kind of a few</p>
<p>investments that could be made each year, there was a</p>
<p>decision making process that says, you know, look, how</p>
<p>valuable could this be, versus this other opportunity that I</p>
<p>could invest my capital into that says, okay, the best</p>
<p>opportunity wins and gets picked and gets capital in a</p>
<p>world where everyone was raising a billion dollar second</p>
<p>fund, or a $3 billion fourth fund, and you suddenly had an</p>
<p>influx of $100 billion of venture money in a year. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot like what we saw in crypto markets, which is an</p>
<p>extraordinary explosion and highly speculative bubble</p>
<p>assets. And a lot of these businesses maybe shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>existed in the first place, too much demand for the stock of</p>
<p>private companies. And all the hedge funds that came into it</p>
<p>all the mutual funds, not enough supply of great founders and</p>
<p>serious teams that are working hard on this. I think with the</p>
<p>case of fast, I agree with your general sentiment about dunking.</p>
<p>In the case of fast, what you had was a founder who was on</p>
<p>Twitter every day, tweeting about how great the company</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t giving startup advice, while he was taking none of it</p>
<p>and should not have been giving any of it because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have product market fit lesson learned, you know, you</p>
<p>know, you know, it should be criticized the next person that</p>
<p>backs that guy. You know, that guy, he&rsquo;s got a very</p>
<p>interesting history, actually, as well. I think they didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>any diligence on him. Apparently, he had two companies</p>
<p>that were kind of major red flags. And I think the</p>
<p>diligence issue sacks is one maybe you are having a similar</p>
<p>experience to be on the early stage. We were seeing deals last</p>
<p>year close in a week. We normally have 30 days to vet a</p>
<p>deal and maybe a week or two to get our diligence wrapped up.</p>
<p>Sometimes these things overlap, but it&rsquo;s what was it, you know,</p>
<p>historically, a four to six week process, and then it went</p>
<p>down to a four to six day process. And then people were</p>
<p>meeting with you one day and saying they&rsquo;re closed the next.</p>
<p>Were you did you feel like over the last couple years, people</p>
<p>were doing proper diligence or not? And what impacted</p>
<p>diligence have on any of this,</p>
<p>you know, certainly, I can&rsquo;t speak to what our competitors</p>
<p>were doing. I don&rsquo;t think our diligence process changed much,</p>
<p>we would just have a mentality of when there was a deal that</p>
<p>was urgent, we would drop everything and focus on that</p>
<p>deal and get our work done. And it can be done quickly. Although</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier for SAS companies, because the metrics that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at are so standardized. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s an easier</p>
<p>process. What&rsquo;s the most important thing in diligence? In</p>
<p>your mind? What is the like, bullet that like people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the silver bullet thing people can&rsquo;t fake?</p>
<p>Probably offsheet customer references. So the first thing</p>
<p>we do is focus on the on the metrics, right? And the</p>
<p>financials, the SAS metrics, all that kind of stuff. But then</p>
<p>you want to talk to customers. And you want to understand the</p>
<p>value they&rsquo;re getting out of the product. And ideally, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>offsheet customers.</p>
<p>Explain what offsheet just means that, you know, you</p>
<p>frequently ask a founder to give you customer references.</p>
<p>Those are onsheet references, the offsheet references are the</p>
<p>ones that you find yourself that they never gave you. So like</p>
<p>the easiest offsheet references to do are when your own</p>
<p>portfolio companies are using some other like piece of</p>
<p>software, and they tell you about it. So no, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a totally non conflicted situation. So that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>So one of your companies is using Stripe, they tell you how</p>
<p>great Stripe is, they tell you what&rsquo;s good, what&rsquo;s bad about</p>
<p>it. But right references you&rsquo;re giving. So it&rsquo;s sort of like</p>
<p>backdoor references. If somebody tells you here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Yeah, you can do the same thing on founders to you can have</p>
<p>onsheet and offsheet references for founders.</p>
<p>And you can do it for VCs.</p>
<p>Yeah, but but look, I think I think it&rsquo;s probably a little bit</p>
<p>unfair to blame the board of this company too much. Because</p>
<p>the reality is that VCs don&rsquo;t have the leverage or the power</p>
<p>in this business. I mean, it&rsquo;s found this this whole</p>
<p>construction of the industry is set up around founders. And at</p>
<p>the end of the day, it&rsquo;s up to the founder to run the company</p>
<p>and they get to do what they want. Unless they do something</p>
<p>criminal. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re gonna be able to do whatever</p>
<p>they want. And I disagree. Hold on boards generally are very</p>
<p>deferential to founders. And if the founders not willing to</p>
<p>listen to advice, what are you going to do about that?</p>
<p>Well, that this is but this is the point you&rsquo;re making, I think</p>
<p>is not right. You think that if Peter Thiel gave some advice to</p>
<p>slow the company down that this guy would have not taken it?</p>
<p>Of course, he would have. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>that. And we would have to consider it. If Mike Moritz</p>
<p>actually said it, he would have had to consider it. I think what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually speaking to is in the hold on in the rush to</p>
<p>put so much money to work. We&rsquo;ve elevated people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what the job is to do the job. And if they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>credible, of course, they&rsquo;re going to be ignored. We all have</p>
<p>ignored stupid board members. You&rsquo;ve done it too, David. But</p>
<p>even you know, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s actually look at Yammer as an</p>
<p>example. There were one or two of us that you would talk to</p>
<p>pretty consistently. You didn&rsquo;t talk to all of them. I would</p>
<p>always seek out advice. Look at a great founder, a good founder</p>
<p>always seeks out advice, no question about it. But look,</p>
<p>this idea that it&rsquo;s governance versus advice. I mean, the</p>
<p>problem with it being governance is all the institutional</p>
<p>incentives for VCs are to be profounder. So no one wants to</p>
<p>jam a founder by making them do something they don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the way it is. No, to be</p>
<p>clear, that became a competitive tactic that emerged as more</p>
<p>venture capital funds were raised and more venture capital</p>
<p>was raised from LPs. Prior to that, there was a scarcity of</p>
<p>venture capital. And VCs could be could have good governance</p>
<p>and not have to have this whole profounder model that became the</p>
<p>thing that founders fund and Andreessen and others kind of</p>
<p>proclaimed as being core to their advantage and the reason</p>
<p>to pick them over some other VC who&rsquo;s going to meddle in your</p>
<p>affairs. And by the way, both are true. There are most VCs as</p>
<p>Vinod has said publicly, add negative value. And I totally</p>
<p>agree with him on this, because they many VCs, particularly the</p>
<p>ones who aren&rsquo;t, you know, valuable and don&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>much to add, try to add stuff, try to say stuff, and they just,</p>
<p>you know, create negative value in the process. But on the</p>
<p>other hand, the whole profounder model led to the we work and</p>
<p>ubers of the world that, you know, I think there&rsquo;s a trade</p>
<p>off. I mean, look, I remember in the 1990s, the default was</p>
<p>that the founder just got replaced, right? Like, as soon</p>
<p>as the company successful, you hire a professional CEO, that</p>
<p>was just like rule of Eric Schmidt. I mean, even the</p>
<p>mighty Google did that. Yeah, no, I mean, that wasn&rsquo;t that,</p>
<p>by the way, that was a point I was trying to make, which was</p>
<p>like, so much of john doors influence was in getting Larry</p>
<p>and Sergey to take Eric on as CEO. And I really do think that</p>
<p>that was like, you know, a critical move that created</p>
<p>probably the created most valuable company in history.</p>
<p>Right. And, you know, it&rsquo;s, it was an important, imagine if you</p>
<p>had one of these founders fund. And by the way, you know, as you</p>
<p>guys know, I&rsquo;m very close to the guys at founders fund. And</p>
<p>but imagine if you had a founders fund type approach,</p>
<p>where you said, Look, Larry and Sergey are the founders, they</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing, let them do it, as opposed to the</p>
<p>john door nuance of, let&rsquo;s make sure that we think about the</p>
<p>development of this company successfully over time. And then</p>
<p>convince Larry and Sergey through a bunch of meetings and</p>
<p>riding bikes and whatever else they did with Eric, you know,</p>
<p>to like, and then and then what about Jim Breyer? Didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>bring Cheryl over to Facebook? I mean, like, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>these stories of the really, you know, the VCs that really</p>
<p>changed the trajectory of the business through their work,</p>
<p>right. And but look, all I&rsquo;m saying is that the good VCs can</p>
<p>still have that influence, but it&rsquo;s in the form of advice</p>
<p>rather than governance, right? Look, we just don&rsquo;t call the</p>
<p>shots. You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s it is it is advice. But But for</p>
<p>example, governance as an example, in every board that I</p>
<p>take, the first thing that I say is, here&rsquo;s a template I want,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to ask you a bunch of stuff, but I just want some</p>
<p>transparent reporting. And the first page is always how much</p>
<p>money at the beginning of the month? How much money did you</p>
<p>burn? You know, how much equity did we give out? How much is</p>
<p>left in the pool, simple, basic checks and balances, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re not asking all kinds of crazy questions. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like, all right, how much money are we burning? How much</p>
<p>dilution did we take? Now tell me what we&rsquo;ve done. And those</p>
<p>are simple elements of governance way before you get</p>
<p>into a level setting, what&rsquo;s the speed of the plane? What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the elevation? Where are we at? What&rsquo;s the altitude? And</p>
<p>when you ask people for this today, I should do that, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know anyone that doesn&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;ll be honest,</p>
<p>like, yeah, anybody that doesn&rsquo;t do it, honestly, is being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about. I don&rsquo;t know anyone that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do that. I mean, I&rsquo;m talking about, I would love to</p>
<p>see, I would love to see a little bit of that going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to see a fast board deck and to see if that</p>
<p>first page is that page, the first page. And by the way, you</p>
<p>know where I learned that from, from Sequoia and Kleiner</p>
<p>Perkins. Because back in the day, what I saw from founders</p>
<p>was, oh, this is the first thing I have to report on. I was</p>
<p>taught by founders when I was a when I was a principal at</p>
<p>Mayfield. They&rsquo;re like, this is how you do the job. And I was</p>
<p>like, great, thanks. I mean, I was, you know, sitting beside</p>
<p>these guys that were old hands at doing it. And that&rsquo;s how I</p>
<p>learned this business through that apprenticeship. But there</p>
<p>was governance and advice. And the governance is just about</p>
<p>being transparent about how much money are you burning. And so</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, you know, to David&rsquo;s point, if you had just seen that</p>
<p>data, even if you take those board decks, by the way, because</p>
<p>you have these information rights, I don&rsquo;t know about you</p>
<p>guys, but we do it, we did it as well. You take the board deck,</p>
<p>you circulate it to your other partners. There&rsquo;s lots of times</p>
<p>where I see board decks and companies where one of my</p>
<p>partners are on the board, and I send them an email of like,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s some bullet points of things to think about that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen before, etc, etc. You don&rsquo;t think nobody at Stripe or</p>
<p>index could have said, you&rsquo;re burning $10 million a month, and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no revenue. So the point is that data is only 30 or $40</p>
<p>million in the bank, give me a break, guys. So this was a</p>
<p>cataclysmic failure at the advice level and at the</p>
<p>governance level. And all I&rsquo;m saying is, it&rsquo;s a good lesson</p>
<p>for folks to learn. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, so many point people&rsquo;s attention to articles I wrote</p>
<p>that I think are relevant. So first, we actually published an</p>
<p>article on the SAS board meeting deck that we&rsquo;d like people to</p>
<p>use. And obviously, they&rsquo;re free to use or not to Tomas point</p>
<p>right up at the top as a context center, we need to know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your monthly burn and how much money is in the bank.</p>
<p>And that and then we just divide those things to create runway,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like looking at projections runway.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>We just look at how much you burn last month, and how much</p>
<p>money you got in the bank, like, right, exactly. And when they</p>
<p>were down to 30 or $40 million, burning 10 million a month,</p>
<p>somebody should have like thrown up a red flag and said,</p>
<p>better slam on the brakes right now, because you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>out of business in three or four months. So so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of piece number one. The other piece was an archive wrote</p>
<p>a couple years ago called blitz fail, which is how not to go</p>
<p>off the rails because a lot. There&rsquo;s a lot of literature out</p>
<p>there about blitz scaling. And a lot of startups think they need</p>
<p>to scale as rapidly as humanly possible. And I wrote this</p>
<p>piece about how fast growing companies that raise lots of</p>
<p>money at high valuations, basically go off the rails, and</p>
<p>they end up imploding. And there&rsquo;s like 11 reasons why this</p>
<p>happens, I sort of categorize them. One of the biggest ones is</p>
<p>founder psychology, you have a founder who believes that</p>
<p>things are always going to be up into the right. It&rsquo;s they,</p>
<p>they, it&rsquo;s funny, they&rsquo;re always described the same way,</p>
<p>described as visionary, charismatic, and the word crazy</p>
<p>is often used, but it&rsquo;s crazy good. And then when everything</p>
<p>goes to shit, all of a sudden, the word crazy means something</p>
<p>pejorative and bad. And, you know, the problem is that, you</p>
<p>know, these characteristics of being highly visionary and</p>
<p>charismatic, they also can be combined with an unwillingness</p>
<p>to listen to advice. And so, you know, founders who have those</p>
<p>qualities there, they can be a good thing, but they have to</p>
<p>seek out advice from people who&rsquo;ve had experience,</p>
<p>otherwise, they&rsquo;re going to make a mistake and hit the wall</p>
<p>being delusional is, you know, what you need to start these</p>
<p>companies, like, I&rsquo;m going to beat these incumbents, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to change the world. A little bit of delusion is good, but</p>
<p>not when you&rsquo;re looking at the runway, right? Like, that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you need to be pragmatic. I think, you know, there&rsquo;s a term</p>
<p>of coachability, you know, how coachable is this person as a</p>
<p>CEO as a leader. And I do think that coachability goes hand in</p>
<p>hand with intellectual curiosity. I mean, if you look</p>
<p>at the Collison&rsquo;s Patrick Collison, and how much breadth</p>
<p>he has, and some of the topics he&rsquo;s interested in, and the</p>
<p>things he writes about, it indicates to me a high degree</p>
<p>of intellectual curiosity. And people who are intellectually</p>
<p>curious, generally are very humble, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly seeking things they don&rsquo;t know. And they recognize</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t know a lot of things. And in that same kind</p>
<p>of mentality, they are willing to recognize that other</p>
<p>individuals can have good points of view that can inform</p>
<p>their perspective, and they&rsquo;re willing to change their</p>
<p>perspective. And I think that&rsquo;s a really key, key thing that if</p>
<p>you look across the range of successful founders, CEOs that</p>
<p>scale to $100 billion plus valuations for their businesses,</p>
<p>that to me is one of the more common threads is this kind of</p>
<p>intellectual curiosity, which translates into a coachability,</p>
<p>which translates into an adaptability as and being</p>
<p>willing to take advice. And so your board is a tool, not kind</p>
<p>of a governance structure sitting over you. I think the</p>
<p>less you are like that, the more you are likely to feel like</p>
<p>your board is a governance structure, an umbrella sitting</p>
<p>over you telling you what you can&rsquo;t do. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what governance means, by the way. Well, governance meant to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s meant to look out for the shareholders. That&rsquo;s the job.</p>
<p>Right. But to act as a fiduciary doesn&rsquo;t mean to like tell the</p>
<p>CEO what to do. This is my point. Like, yeah, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s right about, I think freebirds right about how</p>
<p>boards are often perceived by founders, I think there is an</p>
<p>increasing, let&rsquo;s call it a Hollywood director, a Hollywood</p>
<p>auteur mentality towards VCs,</p>
<p>Jake Allen, the all in podcast, right?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s basically look, there, there</p>
<p>are certain incubators out there and accelerators and whatever</p>
<p>who teach these young founders, that it&rsquo;s all about their</p>
<p>vision. And anyone who stands in the way of it is basically</p>
<p>interfering with them. And they are the auteur like a Hollywood</p>
<p>director, and you got to stay away from those suits, the</p>
<p>studio guys, right? Ever. That&rsquo;s the mentality they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re teaching them</p>
<p>an adversarial mentality,</p>
<p>an adversarial mentality. And look, there are to Jamal&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>there are plenty of VCs who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they have no useful advice to offer. But the better mentality</p>
<p>to teach a founder would be like, look, the world is so</p>
<p>complicated and building a company is so complicated, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be 10 times more difficult if you don&rsquo;t seek out advice. So</p>
<p>go find board members who will let you ultimately do what you</p>
<p>want, but will still give you the advice if something&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>And what was true at one point in time when Paul Graham gave</p>
<p>this advice, and he set up Y Combinator, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>say their name, but it is Paul Graham had a terrible</p>
<p>experience in his company with venture capitalists. So he set</p>
<p>up that wartime stance between founders and the investment</p>
<p>community. And you know, founders fund became the</p>
<p>antithesis of the traditional venture funds, and they were</p>
<p>going to be founder focused. So but that advice then might have</p>
<p>been true. And now it&rsquo;s not now we&rsquo;ve sung the pendulum too far</p>
<p>the other way. We did two things because we saw this 10 years</p>
<p>ago, when I started seed investing. And then when I</p>
<p>started building positions of over 5%, I just said to</p>
<p>founders, if we own over five or 10%, we should have an option</p>
<p>of a board seat. And we&rsquo;ll do board seat, we&rsquo;ll do board</p>
<p>training with you. We will just teach you we&rsquo;ll take like here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some decks that we&rsquo;ve seen from other, you know, here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>decks that are available. And we&rsquo;ll show you what a board is</p>
<p>like. And then I would have three founders come to would</p>
<p>sit on one board meeting, and I would do three back to back</p>
<p>board meetings, bring your counsel, bring your founders,</p>
<p>and sit in on the other two board meetings. And we&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>little Socratic discussion about what was good about each board</p>
<p>meeting, we did board meeting training as a proxy for venture</p>
<p>worthiness later on. And when those companies did go out to</p>
<p>get venture, and they had an ESOP, and they had board minute</p>
<p>meetings, they just looked more impressive to the venture</p>
<p>community. So I know people say don&rsquo;t do a board, it&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>It actually turns out doing a one hour board meeting four</p>
<p>times a year, six times a year, even as a seed stage company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it does differentiate you to the venture community, I</p>
<p>find. All right, moving on. And speaking of boards, Elon bought</p>
<p>a chunk of Twitter last week, a 9% stake, and he&rsquo;s joining the</p>
<p>board that makes him the largest individual or the largest</p>
<p>shareholder, individual or institutional. He bought the</p>
<p>shares in March, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal tweeted, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited to share we&rsquo;re appointing Elon Musk to our</p>
<p>board. And then Jack tweeted in support. I&rsquo;m really happy Elon</p>
<p>is joining the Twitter board exclamation point just to give</p>
<p>some level setting here in q4 of 2021. Twitter had 1.5 billion</p>
<p>in revenue up 22% year over year, they&rsquo;ve really been</p>
<p>starting to ring the register over their daily active users</p>
<p>are solid but modest 217 million daily active users 38 million of</p>
<p>which in the US 179 million are international. And their stated</p>
<p>goals for q4 of next year 2023. So in a year and a half, they</p>
<p>want to have 315 million, and they want revenue in 2023 to hit</p>
<p>7.5 billion again, they&rsquo;re on a $6 billion run rate. So I guess</p>
<p>that would be an increase of 25%. Just general thoughts on</p>
<p>and Elon obviously has been making some Twitter suggestions</p>
<p>for the product. sacks you worked with Elon at PayPal.</p>
<p>Thoughts on what this does for that wasn&rsquo;t why you&rsquo;re laughing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like such a funny transition. sacks you work with Elon at PayPal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s gonna have some great product ideas. But what this</p>
<p>is really about is free speech. You know, right before Elon</p>
<p>announces he was doing polling, asking the Twitter user base</p>
<p>whether Twitter was succeeding or failing in his mission to be an</p>
<p>open town square and open marketplace of ideas. Something</p>
<p>like 70% said they were failing at it. Elon, on many occasions</p>
<p>has spoken up for free speech. He believes that Twitter&rsquo;s historic</p>
<p>mission is as an open town square. And I think he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>bring that emphasis to the board. And it&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>Now, I think the person who had the best take on the reaction to</p>
<p>this was Mike Solana. And he had a few funny tweets.</p>
<p>Who is Mike Solana? Who does he work for? Is he a Founders Fund guy?</p>
<p>I think Yeah, I think he works for Peter Founders Fund. But he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a he also writes a great news substack newsletter, kind of</p>
<p>like a blog post called pirate wires. It&rsquo;s worth checking out</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a pretty, in addition to being a pretty sharp analyst, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually says a lot of funny things, too.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s iconoclastic. And yeah, yeah, he he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll swing the sword.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the way he put it is that, you know, Elon joining the</p>
<p>board has all the worst people on Twitter furious. They think</p>
<p>that this guy might actually say free speech. And for</p>
<p>authoritarians, that is an existential threat. And then he</p>
<p>added, I don&rsquo;t get what the problem is, guys, if you want</p>
<p>censorship, you can just go build a new social media company</p>
<p>and do censorship there. It&rsquo;s a free market, thereby turning on</p>
<p>its head, everything they&rsquo;ve been saying, which is, you know,</p>
<p>when the people who the authoritarian, the authoritarian</p>
<p>people who love censorship, whenever anyone complained about</p>
<p>censorship, they would always say, well, just go create your</p>
<p>own social network. You know, we&rsquo;re free to do whatever,</p>
<p>truth, whatever.</p>
<p>Exactly. Well, this is this is the free market acting in a way</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like, which is finally somebody who believes in</p>
<p>free speech is wanting to stand up by the largest stake in</p>
<p>Twitter, join the board. I mean, this is fabulous.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really fabulous.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty amazing. Yeah. And the stock went up 30%.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I texted you guys in the group chat, I think that if he is able</p>
<p>to make free speech cool, again, he&rsquo;ll, he&rsquo;ll actually do more</p>
<p>doing that than potentially through SpaceX and Tesla. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already saying a lot. Because free speech really is</p>
<p>this fundamental principle of democracy, and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>decaying. We don&rsquo;t know the implications of a large</p>
<p>technology company, keeping free speech as a principled pillar of</p>
<p>their reason to exist. Right? Because we have seen free speech</p>
<p>kind of decay. And we&rsquo;ve seen sort of, you know, random</p>
<p>decision making that seems arbitrary by a lot of these</p>
<p>technology companies. And, you know, the payments companies,</p>
<p>free broke was mentioning visa and MasterCard earlier in the</p>
<p>group chat. But all of these things can change on a dime if</p>
<p>Elon makes free speech cool, again, and figures out a way to</p>
<p>make that a principle that everybody can embrace. Because</p>
<p>then if you really believe in that, then you go to the next</p>
<p>logical conclusion, which is what David has said for forever,</p>
<p>which is the only solution to, you know, speech, you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>is more speech. And then that creates a surface area that I</p>
<p>think you can technically maneuver around. So meaning what</p>
<p>are the real problems in all of this speech creates, it creates</p>
<p>a, you know, content moderation issue, right? It creates a spam</p>
<p>issue. And it creates a sort of wisdom of the crowds ranking</p>
<p>rating issue. So misinformation comes to mind. Yeah. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. That&rsquo;s the wisdom of the crowds ranking rating issue in</p>
<p>my book. So I guess the point is that, you know, if he can get</p>
<p>the Twitter employee base, fundamentally on side of this</p>
<p>idea of free speech as a principle, that I think is</p>
<p>enormous, because you know that none of the other big tech</p>
<p>companies will ever even do that. And the capital structures</p>
<p>of those companies will never allow a single strong voice like</p>
<p>his to enforce that idea. So this is the only company where</p>
<p>that could happen. And I think, you know, we want to see what</p>
<p>this how this plays out. I think it&rsquo;s a really, really big</p>
<p>deal. All right, freeberg. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think</p>
<p>changes. Facebook, Twitter, even Google all acquiesced to</p>
<p>significant external pressure over the years. I&rsquo;ve said this</p>
<p>in the past, I believe the founders of those companies are</p>
<p>all philosophically, fundamentally philosophically</p>
<p>aligned with the notion of free speech, and absolute freedom of</p>
<p>information, you know, enabling truth finding over time. And</p>
<p>the, the edge cases of those platforms, ultimately, identify</p>
<p>and uncover ways that they can be used against what, you know,</p>
<p>many would consider kind of the betterment of society. And as a</p>
<p>result, they acquiesce to external pressure that drive</p>
<p>some of these censorship decisions and drive some of</p>
<p>these, these behavioral changes by management. But I think that</p>
<p>if you concentrate the ownership of those businesses, and rather</p>
<p>than have kind of a distributed shareholder base, meaning the</p>
<p>public markets were the largest single shareholder in Twitter to</p>
<p>date, has been jack Dorsey at 2.3%. He actually serves the</p>
<p>shareholders, and the shareholders ultimately want to</p>
<p>see the stock price go up. And they ultimately want to see the</p>
<p>business make more money. And as a result, they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>same sort of, you know, the stakeholders there have kind of a</p>
<p>different set of alignments over time, you know, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>necessarily the same long term, or focus meeting, does the</p>
<p>philosophy come before the money. And I think as you kind</p>
<p>of concentrate ownership, you have the opportunity and the</p>
<p>option now to, you know, make make those sorts of decisions</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t make when you&rsquo;re a broadly owned stock. But</p>
<p>Facebook and Google are concentrated. Yeah. So what are</p>
<p>you talking about? The issue chemoph is in those companies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scared to death that they&rsquo;ll lose their employees and</p>
<p>have chaos at work government. No, the issue is government.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s your employees. And below it&rsquo;s Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shareholders, it&rsquo;s shareholders and government regulators, right.</p>
<p>And so in both cases, you have to the pressure and employees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good point. Yeah.</p>
<p>I understand. But I&rsquo;m not sure how Twitter changes any of that.</p>
<p>It does. I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because if we look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened is, let sometime last year, I think it happened</p>
<p>around Chappelle. And I think it happened because a coinbase we</p>
<p>saw a group of folks say, you know what, enough is enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, we told you to bring your whole self to work. We told you</p>
<p>we would do your laundry. And then at some point, Netflix was</p>
<p>like, listen, you don&rsquo;t have to agree with every comedian on our</p>
<p>platform. There&rsquo;s a range of comedians. And if you disagree</p>
<p>with this one, you can do a walkout, you can protest, you</p>
<p>can make your feelings hurt, or you can choose to not work</p>
<p>here. And then Daniel Eck kind of did the same thing. He said,</p>
<p>Listen, at Spotify, we&rsquo;re gonna put labels on it. If you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like Joe Rogan, don&rsquo;t work here. And then of course, we know</p>
<p>coinbase did it. And Toby from Shopify did it, and I have</p>
<p>Twitter doing it. And when you apologize, and you start</p>
<p>listening to this very vocal minority, when they&rsquo;re upset,</p>
<p>and they want to cancel people, or they want to D platform</p>
<p>people. What do they do? They double down, you&rsquo;ve shown that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to listen to them. They&rsquo;re not doing it at coinbase</p>
<p>anymore. They&rsquo;re not going to do it at Spotify anymore. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing it at Netflix. And Apple acquiesced, right? They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, we don&rsquo;t like, you know, Antonio&rsquo;s book, chaos monkeys.</p>
<p>And he said these three things in an award winning book that</p>
<p>we find are, we&rsquo;re gonna fire him. I think at some point,</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s gonna have to say, you know what, leave your feelings</p>
<p>at work. And this is a company, leave them at home. Thank you.</p>
<p>This is why Elon is so dangerous to these people is</p>
<p>because he won&rsquo;t be pushed around. The fact the matter is</p>
<p>that this whole woke mob thing, it&rsquo;s a paper tiger, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the support of most of the population. It&rsquo;s a handful of</p>
<p>very noisy voices on Twitter, and social media who insist on</p>
<p>having a monopoly on the right to shape all of our narratives.</p>
<p>And they want a monopoly on moral outrage, they want a</p>
<p>monopoly, moral outrage, they want a monopoly, but they also</p>
<p>want a monopoly on the ability to basically to define what is</p>
<p>acceptable and what the what the narrative on any topic is going</p>
<p>to be. And all it takes is one strong person to stand up to the</p>
<p>mob, as we saw Brian Armstrong do at Coinbase, and the mob</p>
<p>dissipated, he took, you know, Brian,</p>
<p>they go find another target, they find another target.</p>
<p>Exactly. So yeah, Elon doing this is a really big deal.</p>
<p>Because again, he cannot be pushed around. And he is showing</p>
<p>leadership here. And all it will take to end this woke censorship</p>
<p>is for other founders to stand tall the way that Elon has.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go into the nuance.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll care what employees kind of gripe about, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll care what regulators gripe about. And I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>care what other shareholders gripe about. He&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>the long term opportunity, the philosophical alignment with</p>
<p>mission, and and plow forward. And I think that that level of</p>
<p>leadership is what separates some, you know, great businesses</p>
<p>from others. But this is a very</p>
<p>listen, there were moments of D platforming that were earned by</p>
<p>people like Alex Jones, who was saying that the, you know,</p>
<p>families of Sandy Hook were false flags, and their children</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t murdered. There are, you know, Milo Yiannopoulos, and</p>
<p>some of these alt right Nazi sympathizing people throwing up</p>
<p>swat stickers, you know, people promoting violence or</p>
<p>brigading on these services to attack people into docks,</p>
<p>people, those people, those were just cancellations, D</p>
<p>platforming from YouTube,</p>
<p>in your opinion?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, anybody inciting violence, I think we would all</p>
<p>agree should be dis platform.</p>
<p>Jason, look at how it&rsquo;s evolved. We start with isolated</p>
<p>cases, like Alex Jones, like a Milo that nobody likes, and</p>
<p>nobody supports. The next thing you know, the President of the</p>
<p>United States is being D platform. But again, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposedly based on him inciting a crowd. Then what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>today, now we have entire categories of opinion being</p>
<p>banned. It starts with COVID.</p>
<p>I agree. That&rsquo;s exactly my point.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a dissenting opinion.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s invalid. I agree.</p>
<p>Anybody who has a dissenting opinion on COVID gets banned.</p>
<p>Now, anybody who has a dissenting opinion on climate</p>
<p>change can be banned. There&rsquo;s a story this week on CNN, where</p>
<p>Pinterest of all Pinterest is a photo sharing site. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. No one&rsquo;s talking about climate change on Pinterest.</p>
<p>And yet I was, but then I got you.</p>
<p>I mean, it just shows this censorship now is on autopilot.</p>
<p>I mean, even sites where the conversation is not taking</p>
<p>place, are banning entire categories of thought and</p>
<p>opinion. Because it disagrees with you know, what the experts</p>
<p>say, and Jake, how you could point out your Alex Jones case</p>
<p>to make the case that D platforming should be allowed.</p>
<p>The problem is, as soon as you make that case, it&rsquo;s only a</p>
<p>slight degree point to a slight degree away from the next case,</p>
<p>and then a slight degree away from the next case. And then</p>
<p>fast forward three years, and you&rsquo;re banning entire topics of</p>
<p>conversation that ultimately may end up being proven to be a</p>
<p>topic of conversation we should have had. And if you look back,</p>
<p>by the way, what great movie Woody Harrelson, the people</p>
<p>versus Larry Flint, Larry Flint was a pornographer, it was easy</p>
<p>for everyone to chastise him. And for everyone to say, you</p>
<p>know what, let&rsquo;s go ahead and D platform, this guy back then and</p>
<p>ban him and charge him by the government. And at the end of</p>
<p>the day, he fought for his rights for free speech. Now, all</p>
<p>that being said, Larry Flint was publishing using his own</p>
<p>printers and selling on the street in a very legally</p>
<p>compliant way. There is a difference in having someone</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s platform be the mechanism that you use to promote your</p>
<p>voice. If they choose like Pinterest and Twitter and</p>
<p>YouTube and Facebook and Google to change how their platform</p>
<p>operates sex. I actually think that&rsquo;s a commercial decision</p>
<p>made by a private company, they should have the right to do</p>
<p>that. But they&rsquo;re going to lose users over time, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to end up looking like idiots when they&rsquo;re wrong by banning</p>
<p>certain topics that we should be having conversations about</p>
<p>over time. And I do think that there are other mechanisms for</p>
<p>us to use the free and open internet. This is why I think</p>
<p>the free and open internet is more important than anything to</p>
<p>have conversations using other platforms.</p>
<p>I mean, and I mean, hold on, I just want to respond to David</p>
<p>since he did, you know, counter my point. I agree with you. I</p>
<p>think it went overboard. And I think there are more reasonable</p>
<p>solutions. I think a time based ban would have been better for</p>
<p>somebody like Trump, and maybe waiting to see what happens with</p>
<p>the January 6 Commission. Putting that aside, I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very controversial. You know, when you just look at what</p>
<p>Spotify did to our podcast, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve looked at</p>
<p>us in Spotify, every other episode says COVID-19</p>
<p>information here. I think this is one of the best things if</p>
<p>people want to talk about ivermectin, and it&rsquo;s an open</p>
<p>science and free bird, you know more about it than any of us.</p>
<p>And people want to debate it. Why not link them to the most</p>
<p>credible sources? I think that&rsquo;s a great solution. I have</p>
<p>a question. Yeah. Is there an oat milk tag on Spotify? Yes.</p>
<p>Because if there is oat milk, oat milk, oat milk, when you</p>
<p>listen to the all in pod on Spotify, there&rsquo;s a tag that</p>
<p>says there&rsquo;s COVID COVID-19. Yeah, get COVID-19 information</p>
<p>here. Yeah,</p>
<p>to free birds argument about these companies should be free</p>
<p>to do whatever they want. So I know that free bird, I want to</p>
<p>make two points about this. First of all, I know free bird</p>
<p>is sincere and genuine in that belief. However, most of the</p>
<p>people making that argument are completely disingenuous about</p>
<p>it. Because on the one hand, they say that these companies</p>
<p>should be free to limit speech when they like the outcome of</p>
<p>that censorship. But meanwhile, in Congress, they&rsquo;re pushing</p>
<p>six bills for to regulate these companies as monopolies. So</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t believe that they should be free to do whatever</p>
<p>they want. They believe that they&rsquo;re monopolies. And indeed,</p>
<p>many of them are monopolies. And even the ones that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>monopolies act the same as all the other ones, they act as a</p>
<p>cartel to limit speech. So that&rsquo;s point number one is that</p>
<p>nobody believes this argument that these companies should be</p>
<p>free to do whatever they want. The second point is that listen,</p>
<p>the founding document of our country, the is the Declaration</p>
<p>of Independence, it says that all of us have rights, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>inalienable, that means they cannot be taken away. Okay. And</p>
<p>in the first couple 100 years of this country, it meant that</p>
<p>those rights meant that the government couldn&rsquo;t take away</p>
<p>your right to free speech. But now today, where does speech</p>
<p>occur it, it occurs on these giant social networks that are</p>
<p>privately owned, they&rsquo;re owned by these large corporations. And</p>
<p>the fact the matter is, if they take away your right to free</p>
<p>speech on these platforms, if they censor you, if they do not</p>
<p>have a right to free speech in this country, that right needs</p>
<p>to be protected. The founding fathers did not anticipate that</p>
<p>for people would be mitigating the majority of conversations</p>
<p>online. It&rsquo;s you know, like if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re taking off, if</p>
<p>you look what happened to below and Alex Jones, like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in the public sphere anymore, right? Like literally</p>
<p>person when these big tech companies all get together as a</p>
<p>cartel to deprive you of your free speech rights, you have</p>
<p>been deperson you&rsquo;ve been digitally deperson and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not just doing it on speech. They&rsquo;re also taking away your</p>
<p>right to engage in payments in transactions to earn a living.</p>
<p>And unless we stop this now, it&rsquo;ll keep going.</p>
<p>We have to address the giant elephant in the room, huge,</p>
<p>which is Trump. I think a lot of this, you know, he hit its</p>
<p>pinnacle when people were saying the the sitting president of</p>
<p>the United States could not be on Twitter. That was I think we</p>
<p>all agree ridiculous and absurd that the president who was duly</p>
<p>elected couldn&rsquo;t have a Twitter account. But then with the</p>
<p>January 6, and the inciting of the violence and you know, all</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s coming out, and obviously, we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>where that all winds up. I&rsquo;m curious what everybody thinks</p>
<p>here about should Trump or is Trump being put back and</p>
<p>reinstated on Facebook or Twitter, and it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>a lifetime ban on Twitter. But if corporate governance changes</p>
<p>and people lobby for that, do we think that there is any kind</p>
<p>of situation where Trump has his Twitter handle or Facebook</p>
<p>accounts reinstated? And should he have them reinstated? I think</p>
<p>Jason, what you suggested is probably the most reasonable</p>
<p>thing, which was there was a time based penalty. You know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re getting through, we&rsquo;re probably what, a third or</p>
<p>two thirds of the way through the January 6 stuff. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to come and go. And I think all roads will probably</p>
<p>lead to a conclusion that after three years, it&rsquo;s probably okay</p>
<p>to let this guy back and be able to tweet. I mean, it&rsquo;s not this</p>
<p>is not, you know, controversial stuff at this point, you know,</p>
<p>that the current thing is moving on from Ukraine, when the topic</p>
<p>all of a sudden is January 6, all over again, and Trump, which</p>
<p>it is on MSNBC, it&rsquo;s all January 6, all the time again. So</p>
<p>listen, I mean, this is not a justification for the widespread</p>
<p>censorship that we&rsquo;ve seen. Like I mentioned, we&rsquo;ve gone so far</p>
<p>beyond isolated cases. Now it&rsquo;s entire categories of thought.</p>
<p>And this has to be stopped.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s your feeling on Trump? Should he be reinstated?</p>
<p>If you were running Twitter, would you have done a time based</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like Trump, just don&rsquo;t follow him? I mean, but</p>
<p>but frankly, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, listen, I don&rsquo;t miss the tweets at all.</p>
<p>My thoughts. I don&rsquo;t miss the tweets at all. I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They were damaging your party. That&rsquo;s how you felt.</p>
<p>My thoughts have evolved before when he first got banned, I was</p>
<p>really supportive of it. And there was part of me which was</p>
<p>just afraid that he would get reelected, etc, etc. Now come</p>
<p>two years later, and to see all of the stuff and the escalation</p>
<p>of D platforming. I think the problem is exactly what you guys</p>
<p>have just talked about, which is the person that does it today</p>
<p>points to the person that does it yesterday, who points to the</p>
<p>person that did it the day before as the justification. And</p>
<p>so even though we don&rsquo;t want to draw a straight line between an</p>
<p>Alex Jones and a Trump and climate change, unfortunately,</p>
<p>there is this line. And so in general, now a much more free</p>
<p>speech, because I think it&rsquo;s much more fragile than I thought</p>
<p>it was before.</p>
<p>Got your opinion has evolved and intelligent people should</p>
<p>respond to new data. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>And I was a person that, you know, as David said, was a</p>
<p>little disingenuous in the sense that I kind of was for</p>
<p>free speech, as long as it was stuff that I agreed with. But</p>
<p>two years later, how much more on David&rsquo;s original camp now,</p>
<p>which is we just need to establish this as a pillar of</p>
<p>society, and not deviate and find credible voices on both</p>
<p>sides. And then algorithmically and through people power,</p>
<p>meaning through crowd, you know, wisdom of the crowds type</p>
<p>stuff, help people figure out what is truthful and how much</p>
<p>truth there is, because that&rsquo;s a tractable problem. But the</p>
<p>minute you start cancelling stuff today, as I sit in 2022,</p>
<p>what I would tell you is I think it&rsquo;s very, very bad, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going in a really bad place.</p>
<p>For what are your thoughts on Trump specifically, because it</p>
<p>does seem like that&rsquo;s a part of the undercurrent here of, you</p>
<p>know, he&rsquo;s going to be coming back possibly going to be</p>
<p>running again. And January 6 is considering the truth social</p>
<p>network, download the app, listen to what he&rsquo;s got to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rocking and rolling over there on the truth app. I heard</p>
<p>they took it down, like it wasn&rsquo;t even working, right? The</p>
<p>the new thing he built.</p>
<p>But what is that? What is that smack trading at? Was it a 20</p>
<p>billion or something?</p>
<p>Still doing well. But look, they had, you know, obviously a</p>
<p>reaction, a market driven reaction to the fact that he was</p>
<p>taken off Twitter. And he said, I&rsquo;m going to go make an</p>
<p>alternative. And that&rsquo;s, you know, certainly proving to be</p>
<p>technically difficult. But as we all know, it&rsquo;s not technically</p>
<p>impossible. He&rsquo;s just got probably the wrong people</p>
<p>working on it. But if they wanted to have an alternative</p>
<p>platform for hearing that voice, you know, have at it. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what else to say. I mean, it&rsquo;s Twitter&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re curating their audience. All these guys want to</p>
<p>be free speech advocates. But at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all editorializing. And that&rsquo;s just the world we found</p>
<p>ourselves in.</p>
<p>I hope Elon takes a sledgehammer to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s exactly what Shema said is they&rsquo;re all they</p>
<p>all believe in free speech and free markets when it produces</p>
<p>the outcome they like. But when the outcome is not what they</p>
<p>like, all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re like, Whoa, these companies are</p>
<p>monopolies.</p>
<p>Well, and here&rsquo;s another opportunity. If you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>libertarian and believe in like, you know, free speech, and you</p>
<p>know, Constitution, like it, you could buy shares, you could</p>
<p>lead a group, start a Dow start a hedge fund, whatever, build a</p>
<p>block to buy a bunch of shares, and then you can get a board</p>
<p>seat on Twitter. And you can have this debate on the board of</p>
<p>Twitter. And it&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right. And you can see, by the way, you</p>
<p>know, small hedge funds with small amounts of capital, like</p>
<p>engine number one, you know, they were able to go up against</p>
<p>Exxon and beat them. So to your point, Jason, for the people</p>
<p>that actually want to censor more, if they can organize the</p>
<p>capital, they absolutely have the right to do that. And I and</p>
<p>I think that they if they if they&rsquo;re able to do it, they</p>
<p>should win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what Mike Solano was kind of getting</p>
<p>out. It&rsquo;s like, look, if you don&rsquo;t like if you don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>the free speech that&rsquo;s happening on Twitter, go create your own</p>
<p>social network, because that&rsquo;s what they were saying before by</p>
<p>the shares and have influence. That&rsquo;s how corporations work.</p>
<p>The shares are the votes. Yeah, Friedberg update us on, you</p>
<p>know, the Ukraine is in month two now. I&rsquo;m sorry, Ukraine is</p>
<p>in month two. Sorry for putting the thumb before it. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tough habit to break. Friedberg tell us, you know, the second</p>
<p>order third order effects of fertilizer and food. At this</p>
<p>point, we&rsquo;ve had this back and forth. And now I think the world</p>
<p>is starting to realize, hey, Friedberg was right. These</p>
<p>downstream effects are going to be significant. I asked you a</p>
<p>question about these, which is, can the world not mobilize if</p>
<p>these are about 1% of the calories 20 or 30% of calories</p>
<p>in certain country? Could the world not mobilize to find other</p>
<p>caloric sources, rice, fish, soybeans, whatever? Or is our</p>
<p>system so fragile, that we can&rsquo;t rally around sending food to</p>
<p>anywhere on the planet, despite the fact that we can fly</p>
<p>anywhere and go on vacation for two weeks anywhere on the</p>
<p>planet? No, the food system is complex and efficient. But it</p>
<p>does not have strong redundancy, or malleability. So take for</p>
<p>example, you know, how do you get flour, you get flour in in</p>
<p>your food, from a food company that bought the flour from a</p>
<p>miller, there are mills around the world that process flat</p>
<p>wheat into flour, you can&rsquo;t take that same mill and process</p>
<p>corn into flour, there&rsquo;s different technology, different</p>
<p>equipment that&rsquo;s used, same with soybeans, and so on. So when</p>
<p>you look at how the food supply chain is constructed, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a local point of consumption, which is a store,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a food processor, and you work your way kind of up</p>
<p>the supply chain. And there&rsquo;s a certain input that&rsquo;s required to</p>
<p>make the output that people consume. And so calories, while</p>
<p>they might be fungible, practically speaking, or</p>
<p>philosophical, or fundamentally speaking, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>necessarily fungible, practically speaking, on the</p>
<p>ground, when you actually try and plug in, let&rsquo;s say soybeans</p>
<p>into the milling supply chain, to make the pasta or the bread</p>
<p>that everyone consumes, in Tunisia, it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>And the same is true with rice. And then the more important</p>
<p>dynamic force that&rsquo;s underway, is that these markets for food</p>
<p>and commodities globally, are not controlled by government,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re controlled by private businesses. And there&rsquo;s a market</p>
<p>for these products. And so what happens is, as the food supply</p>
<p>chain threat hit, countries like China and others started to</p>
<p>stockpile, they started to buy lots and lots of supply, drive</p>
<p>up their stocks and their reserves, you know, for fear of</p>
<p>the famine that&rsquo;s about to hit us in about nine months. And when</p>
<p>they did that, there was now less food available to Tunisia</p>
<p>to Eritrea and to Egypt and so on. And so we&rsquo;re starting to see</p>
<p>the effects of that dislocation, driving dynamic market forces</p>
<p>where certain buyers stock up, and then the folks that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afford to step in not being able to acquire product and being</p>
<p>left. So not only do we have a local production differential</p>
<p>that makes it hard to have all calories be fungible, we&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>seeing this dynamic where there&rsquo;s a bifurcation where the</p>
<p>haves have more and have not have less. And that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>really make this famine kind of hit home in a really, really</p>
<p>sad way. In the months to come. We&rsquo;re already seeing, as I</p>
<p>mentioned two weeks ago, yeah, as I mentioned a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>the fertilizer problem driving acreage down. So the USDA farm</p>
<p>report comes out, they survey farmers and figure out how much</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to plant every year. And they just downgraded</p>
<p>the number of corn acres are going to get planted this year,</p>
<p>which is happening, starting this month, from 93 million</p>
<p>acres to 89 million. That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but</p>
<p>4 million percent, yeah, 4 million acres coming out of</p>
<p>production of corn in the US is an incredible amount of calories</p>
<p>that are not going to be planted to corn. And so that has all</p>
<p>these downstream effects. And again, this, this crop doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come to harvest till, you know, September, October, then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get processed, and it turns into food. So by the time</p>
<p>the the effect of this decision making hit the marketplace, the</p>
<p>availability of calories and the stockpiling that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, boom, some countries are going to be, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have a limited budget, they&rsquo;re only going to be</p>
<p>able to access so much food, and they can&rsquo;t access any and other</p>
<p>countries are going to be fine. The United States can be fine.</p>
<p>Western Europe will be fine. China will be fine. Sri Lanka is</p>
<p>going to be a mess. Northern and Eastern Africa is going to be a</p>
<p>mess. I mean, there&rsquo;s like places around the world that we</p>
<p>are going to have to scramble. I don&rsquo;t have a real easy answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no simple plug and play here. It&rsquo;s going to be a really</p>
<p>complex set of problems that are going to need to be solved.</p>
<p>Well, Sri Lanka does grow a lot of its own food. So they may be</p>
<p>okay, because they&rsquo;re an importer, right? I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty big net importer. So they make a lot of food, but they</p>
<p>rely on imports a lot for calories there. So yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the case with a lot of places around the world. A lot</p>
<p>of people think, oh, we have farmers, but most countries, you</p>
<p>know, particularly in the developing world are net</p>
<p>importers, they rely on third party supplies of food. So but</p>
<p>a lot of what you&rsquo;re talking about, though, or not. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>processed foods that come into the country. sacks anything to</p>
<p>add here? Well, I mean, I think that the Ukrainian war is kind</p>
<p>of entering a chronic phase. I mean, the sort of entering a</p>
<p>new phase, the first phase, you&rsquo;d have to say that the</p>
<p>Ukrainians one, you know, the Russia wanted to topple</p>
<p>Zelensky&rsquo;s regime, maybe take Kiev, they obviously failed in</p>
<p>that. Now, we&rsquo;re in this phase where the fighting is over in</p>
<p>the Donbass. It&rsquo;s basically the civil war has been going on</p>
<p>there since 2014. And, and really, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>about. Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine will</p>
<p>not be part of NATO. So that issue is kind of off the table.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;re really fighting over now is the status</p>
<p>of these disputed territories in eastern Ukraine. And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to go on for a long time. That&rsquo;s what you know,</p>
<p>General Milley testified, it could go on for years, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna become a sort of permanent feature in the</p>
<p>background of Biden&rsquo;s presidency. And I mean, I think</p>
<p>the good news is that hopefully the war three aspect is off the</p>
<p>table, it seems like the calls for us to impose a no fly zone</p>
<p>or to put boots on the ground, which you were hearing a lot of</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, seems like that&rsquo;s off the table. So now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to be a protracted, I think, civil war</p>
<p>going on in the Donbass with between Ukraine and and Russia</p>
<p>and their proxies, which would mean sex, correct me if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong, that Putin will be hobbled forever, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be a world power. And his power is going to deprecate</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s going to be busy fighting this non winnable war</p>
<p>for some period of time, which is in a way saying Biden did it</p>
<p>perfectly, and checkmated him. I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>your assessment. If there&rsquo;s like a civil war going on, and and</p>
<p>Putin is crippled, that would be checkmate or no,</p>
<p>I think I think that clearly the the State Department</p>
<p>strategy here is to make Putin bleed in eastern Ukraine and</p>
<p>protract this thing make it go on as long as possible. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a risky strategy. Because this thing could always</p>
<p>spin out of control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s risky, but could it be effective? Is there a chance it</p>
<p>could be effective?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if the goal is to blue Pete bleed Putin, yes, it</p>
<p>could be effective bleeding Putin. However, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that that needed to be the key geostrategic objective of the</p>
<p>United States right now. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. Because</p>
<p>look, China is our main threat. China is a peer competitor to</p>
<p>the United States. Russia is not our economy is 15 times bigger</p>
<p>than Russia&rsquo;s. China&rsquo;s economy is about the same size as ours.</p>
<p>That is a real threat. So you know, there are costs to us as</p>
<p>well. There are clearly cost to Putin of this, but there are</p>
<p>huge costs to us as well. Freebird described the risk to</p>
<p>supply chain, we&rsquo;ve had to now spend a lot more money building</p>
<p>the defense in Europe, we&rsquo;re going to be pinned down in</p>
<p>Europe, we should really be moving some of those resources</p>
<p>from Europe to East Asia. I mean, that&rsquo;s really where the</p>
<p>pivot to Asia is what we thought we were supposed to be doing</p>
<p>until quite recently. Now we&rsquo;re gonna be bogged down there. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still risks of inflation and recession in the US. And I</p>
<p>think if we are in a recession later this year, I think a lot</p>
<p>of people in the US will be asking what was this all for?</p>
<p>And if you go read my article that just came out yesterday,</p>
<p>based on my speech is published in the American conservative.</p>
<p>Look, this war was easily avoidable. I mean, the State</p>
<p>Department could have avoided this war very easily.</p>
<p>I thought your I listened to your speech, I thought your</p>
<p>points that you were very clear on, hey, Putin started this, he</p>
<p>is the aggressor, it&rsquo;s his responsibility. But you know, we</p>
<p>do need to think about our foreign policy as a country. And</p>
<p>regime change is probably not a winning strategy for us.</p>
<p>Although in this case, it might, it seems like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>possibility now. So who knows?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna get regime change. But if</p>
<p>we do, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that we&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>something much better. In every case where we push for regime</p>
<p>change, we&rsquo;ve actually gotten the same or worse. So yeah, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that should be our objective. You know, I look, I</p>
<p>think we have a bunch of bad options. Now the war&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>started, the best option would have been to avoid this war in</p>
<p>the first place. And if this thing drags on for years, and</p>
<p>the US economy tips into recession, people will look</p>
<p>back and say, why didn&rsquo;t Joe Biden State Department in the</p>
<p>year 2021, do a much more effective job preventing this</p>
<p>war?</p>
<p>Let me ask, let me ask this follow up question as we wrap</p>
<p>here. Chamath, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what should a</p>
<p>strategic objective be for America. And the number one</p>
<p>strategic objective I could think of was, or one of the top</p>
<p>ones would be to build a strong relationship with India, which</p>
<p>obviously, you know, it has an adversarial relationship with</p>
<p>China already, on the border of Pakistan, and then obviously,</p>
<p>you know, has relations with Russia. What would be on the top</p>
<p>of each of your lists, Sachs and Chamath Chamath, you go first</p>
<p>on priority here, if we&rsquo;re thinking fresh looking at the</p>
<p>world with China in retreat, sort of disengaging from the</p>
<p>West with Russia on their heels, what could the United States in</p>
<p>the West do as a preemptive measure to really solidify</p>
<p>democracy? And, you know, the the world order, a peaceful</p>
<p>world order?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer it slightly differently, which is, we need to</p>
<p>put ourselves in a position to not be dependent on any country.</p>
<p>Because then we can actually dictate what we think the right</p>
<p>approach and solution is from first principles, and have the</p>
<p>courage to stick it through to get to the other side of it. So</p>
<p>there are really two things we need to do. The first, which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of perverted, unnecessarily is energy</p>
<p>independence. And we&rsquo;ve allowed too many people to conflate and</p>
<p>muddy the water on what energy independence means, you know,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s nobody was ever advocating for coal. But you</p>
<p>know, the amount of coal that we could have burned as a bridge</p>
<p>fuel to LNG, which could have been a bridge fuel to things</p>
<p>like nuclear and wind and solar, that path was pretty clear. But</p>
<p>we got in our own way, we have to get out of our own way. Okay,</p>
<p>so energy independence, I think beyond anything else,</p>
<p>strategic, probably an order of magnitude, it is the most</p>
<p>important thing. And then secondarily, there are certain</p>
<p>areas for the future of those future economies, where we need</p>
<p>to have complete capability and know how. And the most important</p>
<p>ones there are the specialty chemicals that we need</p>
<p>specialty chemicals, that we need to basically support</p>
<p>climate change writ large to support battery production writ</p>
<p>large. And then semiconductors get those two things completely</p>
<p>under us control. On top of energy independence, and</p>
<p>honesty, we would be a dominant world power for the next 200</p>
<p>years on our terms.</p>
<p>So the road to resiliency sacks, you&rsquo;re now the Secretary of</p>
<p>State, what are your key priorities?</p>
<p>The US grand strategy has always been to prevent the rise of a</p>
<p>pure competitor who can dominate their region and then challenge</p>
<p>us for global hegemony. There&rsquo;s only one country in the world</p>
<p>that can do that right now to us, which is China. So the pivot</p>
<p>to Asia, as Obama said, was fundamentally correct, but we have</p>
<p>not followed through and executed it. And now our attention is</p>
<p>distracted and bogged down by what&rsquo;s happening in Europe, I</p>
<p>would seek a negotiated settlement to this war. Now that</p>
<p>this Zelensky government has survived, Putin has been unable</p>
<p>to take Western Ukraine. And furthermore, that Zelensky has</p>
<p>given up being part of NATO. The only thing left, okay, is this</p>
<p>fight in the Donbass. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s an agreement already on</p>
<p>the table called the Minsk Accords that can allow us to</p>
<p>settle that. Meanwhile, pivoting to Asia, wrap it up. Meanwhile,</p>
<p>pivot to Asia, create a strong alliance of countries in East</p>
<p>Asia who are threatened by China, we already are friends</p>
<p>with many of them. You&rsquo;ve got Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got Vietnam, create a balancing alliance of those</p>
<p>countries to prevent China from rising to the point where it</p>
<p>can threaten us for global hegemony. That should be our</p>
<p>main priority geopolitically. Great. All right, there you have</p>
<p>it, folks for the rain man, David Sachs, the dictator</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, and the sultan of science, David</p>
<p>Friedberg. I&rsquo;m your boy Jay cow, and we will see you all in</p>
<p>Miami, May 15 16th and 17th. Love you, boys. Bye bye. Love</p>
<p>you besties. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man. We should all just get a room and just have one big</p>
<p>huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B. We need to get merch.</p>
