in this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about how to read your cholesterol okay so what&amp;rsquo;s the function of cholesterol well it acts as a cell membrane coding so every single cell in the body every single cell has a coating of cholesterol so we need that all the outside of your skin has a cholesterol layer cholesterol is needed to make hormones specifically stress hormones in certain other hormones for anti-inflammation also it&amp;rsquo;s involved in brain activity and so when you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough cholesterol it can affect your memory and that&amp;rsquo;s why one of the side effects of statin drugs which lower the cholesterol is memory loss okay there&amp;rsquo;s many other functions but those are the top three big functions okay cholesterol is also needed to make vitamin D it&amp;rsquo;s also needed to make bile B il e to actually help you dissolve fats now what&amp;rsquo;s funny to me is that you know we talk about good and bad cholesterol like HDL is called good cholesterol you can kind of think of the H is like a healthy cholesterol and then LDL is supposed to the bad cholesterol like if there&amp;rsquo;s two types of cholesterol but there&amp;rsquo;s really no such thing as two different types of cholesterol it&amp;rsquo;s really one cholesterol that&amp;rsquo;s inside of both of these little guys this stands for high density lipoproteins okay this is low-density lipoproteins do you notice I didn&amp;rsquo;t say cholesterol in order to transport cholesterol which it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mix well with water or blood you have to put it in a protein capsule and that&amp;rsquo;s what these are these are little tiny shuttles that deliver cholesterol in certain directions in the body so let&amp;rsquo;s talk about like let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the LDL first so we have this outer covering of this protein okay that surrounds the cholesterol and the purpose of the LDL is to transport the cholesterol from your gut and liver to your intestinal tract and then write to the blood so basically LDL takes the cholesterol from the liver in the blood and then from the blood it goes to the rest of the tissues okay that&amp;rsquo;s what LDL does now HDL takes the excess cholesterol that the LDL put in there and removes it and brings it back to the liver and then the liver can actually dismantle it and take care of it so basically we have this exchange between cholesterol coming out of the liver right here and cholesterol going into the liver and we need that balance so when you see that you have high levels of bad cholesterol you know doctors instantly give you a drug to shut it down but what I want to do is I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you what&amp;rsquo;s behind that like what&amp;rsquo;s causing that problem we want to use this as a little indicator light to tell us that there&amp;rsquo;s some problem inside a body normally the LDL should be below 130 now in 2004 a group of 15 doctors panels of doctors that basically decided to lower the LDL to 102 even as low as 70 for certain people that are risk factors okay so what they did is they adjusted the numbers they changed the normal values and put 8 million people on cholesterol medication overnight that&amp;rsquo;s what they did well then we find out and I put a link down there that a lot of these doctors had ties to the drug companies yeah I know surprise right so unfortunately people are freaked out about if that LDL is too high and so we&amp;rsquo;ll get more into that but basically that&amp;rsquo;s what it does so LDL takes the cholesterol and drives it into the the blood and then out to the tissues and then HDL takes the excess cleans it up and puts it back into the liver a normal HDL is in a male body should be at 40 or greater okay and a female body at 47 or greater now let&amp;rsquo;s talk first about let&amp;rsquo;s talk about triglycerides for a second what is triglycerides those basically those are blood fats and basic 5 glycerides are converted sugars okay so triglycerides are used to transport excess carbohydrates so if you have high triglycerides I know for a fact you have too much sugar in your body because the hormone insulin is the converting hormone that makes triglycerides high so we want about 150 or less that&amp;rsquo;s the value petrol glyceride so we don&amp;rsquo;t want them greater than 150 it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get to change this and it&amp;rsquo;s simply by getting rid of sugar out of the diet now they also talked about total cholesterol to HDL ratios and all these different calculations I don&amp;rsquo;t like that I like the triglyceride to HDL ratio the best this will give the best indicator of your risk for heart disease and basically you just divide your total cholesterol by I&amp;rsquo;m sorry total triglycerides by the HDL and that gives you the ratio and if it&amp;rsquo;s greater than 6 there&amp;rsquo;s a problem if it&amp;rsquo;s 2 or less it&amp;rsquo;s good so we want it to be lower okay so that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a ratio you can look at but really in reality there&amp;rsquo;s really no such thing as good or bad cholesterol it just because you need cholesterol you cannot live without cholesterol you just want the exchange there I would say about 99."><title>How to Read and Understand Your Cholesterol Levels ｜ DrEricBergDC |

to talk about how to read your cholesterol okay so  </p><p>what&rsquo;s the function of cholesterol well it acts 
as a cell membrane coding so every single cell  </p><p>in the body every single cell has a coating of 
cholesterol so we need that all the outside of  </p><p>your skin has a cholesterol layer cholesterol 
is needed to make hormones specifically stress  </p><p>hormones in certain other hormones for 
anti-inflammation also it&rsquo;s involved in  </p><p>brain activity and so when you don&rsquo;t have enough 
cholesterol it can affect your memory and that&rsquo;s  </p><p>why one of the side effects of statin drugs which 
lower the cholesterol is memory loss okay there&rsquo;s  </p><p>many other functions but those are the top three 
big functions okay cholesterol is also needed to  </p><p>make vitamin D it&rsquo;s also needed to make bile B il 
e to actually help you dissolve fats now what&rsquo;s  </p><p>funny to me is that you know we talk about 
good and bad cholesterol like HDL is called  </p><p>good cholesterol you can kind of think of the 
H is like a healthy cholesterol and then LDL is  </p><p>supposed to the bad cholesterol like if there&rsquo;s 
two types of cholesterol but there&rsquo;s really no  </p><p>such thing as two different types of cholesterol 
it&rsquo;s really one cholesterol that&rsquo;s inside of both  </p><p>of these little guys this stands for high density 
lipoproteins okay this is low-density lipoproteins  </p><p>do you notice I didn&rsquo;t say cholesterol in order 
to transport cholesterol which it doesn&rsquo;t mix  </p><p>well with water or blood you have to put it in a 
protein capsule and that&rsquo;s what these are these  </p><p>are little tiny shuttles that deliver cholesterol 
in certain directions in the body so let&rsquo;s talk  </p><p>about like let&rsquo;s talk about the LDL first so we 
have this outer covering of this protein okay  </p><p>that surrounds the cholesterol and the purpose 
of the LDL is to transport the cholesterol from  </p><p>your gut and liver to your intestinal tract and 
then write to the blood so basically LDL takes  </p><p>the cholesterol from the liver in the blood 
and then from the blood it goes to the rest  </p><p>of the tissues okay that&rsquo;s what LDL does now HDL 
takes the excess cholesterol that the LDL put in  </p><p>there and removes it and brings it back to the 
liver and then the liver can actually dismantle  </p><p>it and take care of it so basically we have this 
exchange between cholesterol coming out of the  </p><p>liver right here and cholesterol going into the 
liver and we need that balance so when you see  </p><p>that you have high levels of bad cholesterol you 
know doctors instantly give you a drug to shut it  </p><p>down but what I want to do is I&rsquo;m going to teach 
you what&rsquo;s behind that like what&rsquo;s causing that  </p><p>problem we want to use this as a little indicator 
light to tell us that there&rsquo;s some problem inside  </p><p>a body normally the LDL should be below 130 now in 
2004 a group of 15 doctors panels of doctors that  </p><p>basically decided to lower the LDL to 102 even 
as low as 70 for certain people that are risk  </p><p>factors okay so what they did is they adjusted 
the numbers they changed the normal values and  </p><p>put 8 million people on cholesterol medication 
overnight that&rsquo;s what they did well then we  </p><p>find out and I put a link down there that a lot of 
these doctors had ties to the drug companies yeah  </p><p>I know surprise right so unfortunately people are 
freaked out about if that LDL is too high and so  </p><p>we&rsquo;ll get more into that but basically that&rsquo;s what 
it does so LDL takes the cholesterol and drives it  </p><p>into the the blood and then out to the tissues 
and then HDL takes the excess cleans it up and  </p><p>puts it back into the liver a normal HDL is in 
a male body should be at 40 or greater okay and  </p><p>a female body at 47 or greater now let&rsquo;s talk 
first about let&rsquo;s talk about triglycerides for  </p><p>a second what is triglycerides those basically 
those are blood fats and basic 5 glycerides are  </p><p>converted sugars okay so triglycerides are used to 
transport excess carbohydrates so if you have high  </p><p>triglycerides I know for a fact you have too much 
sugar in your body because the hormone insulin is  </p><p>the converting hormone that makes triglycerides 
high so we want about 150 or less that&rsquo;s the value  </p><p>petrol glyceride so we don&rsquo;t want them greater 
than 150 it&rsquo;s very easy to get to change this  </p><p>and it&rsquo;s simply by getting rid of sugar out of the 
diet now they also talked about total cholesterol  </p><p>to HDL ratios and all these different calculations 
I don&rsquo;t like that I like the triglyceride to HDL  </p><p>ratio the best this will give the best indicator 
of your risk for heart disease and basically you  </p><p>just divide your total cholesterol by I&rsquo;m sorry 
total triglycerides by the HDL and that gives  </p><p>you the ratio and if it&rsquo;s greater than 6 there&rsquo;s 
a problem if it&rsquo;s 2 or less it&rsquo;s good so we want  </p><p>it to be lower okay so that&rsquo;s kind of a ratio 
you can look at but really in reality there&rsquo;s  </p><p>really no such thing as good or bad cholesterol it 
just because you need cholesterol you cannot live  </p><p>without cholesterol you just want the exchange 
there I would say about 99.99% of the time just  </p><p>by cleaning up the sugar the carbs the bread the 
pasta the alcohol you can clean this up so fast  </p><p>and bring it back to normal ranges ok there are 
genetic cholesterol issues but it&rsquo;s very rare  </p><p>it&rsquo;s not as common as you think but if you do have 
a genetic tendency to have high cholesterol even  </p><p>if you had 350 this studies showed that there&rsquo;s 
still no risk for heart disease so the so for  </p><p>them to put you on statins right away is a big 
mistake because there&rsquo;s no study that shows that  </p><p>it&rsquo;s actually going to create a problem for you 
especially if these other things are working fine  </p><p>in fact I never ever look at total cholesterol 
as anything I ignore the total cholesterol and  </p><p>because they did drop that down to 200 used to be 
like 225 but even if it&rsquo;s like 350 if it&rsquo;s less  </p><p>than 350 I&rsquo;m not going to worry about if these 
other things are working fine and it&rsquo;s very rare  </p><p>for it to go up if you&rsquo;re off sugars usually it&rsquo;ll 
come right down the other point I want to make is  </p><p>that 75% of the cholesterol in your body right now 
is made by your own body it&rsquo;s made by your liver  </p><p>and the cells you liver makes 2,000 milligrams of 
cholesterol every single day and the rest of the  </p><p>cells make a thousand milligrams and only 25% of 
the cholesterol in your body comes from diet okay  </p><p>the rest comes from your body making it so that 
might shift your viewpoint because if you eat less  </p><p>your body makes more if you eat more your body 
makes less because we have this feedback mechanism  </p><p>so I just want to kind of cover some of these 
basics and kind of give you the simplicity of what  </p><p>it is so you&rsquo;re not freaked out about it but for 
people to be put on medication when they should be  </p><p>working like this is what most people do if it&rsquo;s 
high they go in a low-fat diet it&rsquo;s usually high  </p><p>carbs they go on medication to go and exercise 
that they never cut out the sugar okay all right  </p><p>so go ahead and apply this information make 
it put your comments below thanks for watching</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
