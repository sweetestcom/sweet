    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is our fourth and final episode in this month,</p>
<p>which is all about skills and athletic performance.</p>
<p>Now, in a previous episode,</p>
<p>we talked about science-based,</p>
<p>in particular neuroscience-based tools</p>
<p>for accelerating fat loss.</p>
<p>Previous to that,</p>
<p>we talked about ways to improve skill learning,</p>
<p>motor movements,</p>
<p>which also included things like music and piano playing,</p>
<p>not just athletic performance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also been exploring other aspects</p>
<p>of physical performance throughout the entire month.</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about something</p>
<p>that is vitally important</p>
<p>for not just athletic performance,</p>
<p>but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s muscle.</p>
<p>Now, many of you, when you hear the word muscle,</p>
<p>think muscle growth and building big muscles.</p>
<p>And while we will touch on muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>muscle growth today,</p>
<p>and science-based protocols to enhance hypertrophy,</p>
<p>we will mainly be talking about muscle</p>
<p>as it relates to the nervous system.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>The whole reason why you have a brain</p>
<p>is so that you can move.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s exquisite</p>
<p>and fantastic about the human brain</p>
<p>is that it can direct all sorts</p>
<p>of different kinds of movement,</p>
<p>different speeds of movement,</p>
<p>movement of different durations.</p>
<p>We can train our musculature</p>
<p>to lift heavier and heavier objects,</p>
<p>or we can train our musculature</p>
<p>to take us further and further, so-called endurance.</p>
<p>We can also build smoothness of movement, excuse me,</p>
<p>smoothness of movement,</p>
<p>as well as speed of movement, suppleness of movement.</p>
<p>All of that is governed by the relationship</p>
<p>between the nervous system, neurons,</p>
<p>and their connections to muscle.</p>
<p>So when you hear the science of muscle</p>
<p>and muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you might think, oh, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in building muscle,</p>
<p>but muscle does many critical things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for metabolism.</p>
<p>The more muscle you have,</p>
<p>and not just muscle size,</p>
<p>but the quality of muscle, that&rsquo;s a real thing,</p>
<p>the higher your metabolism is,</p>
<p>and indeed the healthier you are.</p>
<p>It turns out that jumping ability</p>
<p>and ability to stand up quickly</p>
<p>and to get up off the floor quickly</p>
<p>is one of the most predictive markers of aging</p>
<p>and biological aging, and no surprise,</p>
<p>that is governed by the brain to muscle connection.</p>
<p>In addition, muscle and musculature is vital for posture,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t talk about posture enough.</p>
<p>We all have been told we need to sit up straight</p>
<p>or stand up straight,</p>
<p>but posture is vitally important</p>
<p>for how the rest of our body works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vital to how we breathe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about the musculature for posture.</p>
<p>We also are going to talk about muscle</p>
<p>as it relates to aesthetic things.</p>
<p>Now, these are all linked.</p>
<p>Muscle for metabolism, movement, posture, and aesthetics,</p>
<p>of course, are linked, right?</p>
<p>As our posture changes, our aesthetic changes.</p>
<p>As our posture and aesthetic changes, how we move changes.</p>
<p>And as we improve muscle quality,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s increasing muscle size or not,</p>
<p>that changes the way that our entire system,</p>
<p>not just our nervous system and our muscular system,</p>
<p>but our immune system and the other organs of the body work.</p>
<p>So today, as always,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit of mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain how neurons control muscle,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to look at muscle metabolism,</p>
<p>how muscle uses energy.</p>
<p>I promise to make all of this very simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually going to keep it very brief,</p>
<p>probably about 10 minutes total.</p>
<p>And by the end of that 10 minutes,</p>
<p>you will understand a lot about the neuromuscular connection,</p>
<p>how your brain and nervous system control your muscle</p>
<p>and how those muscles work.</p>
<p>Then we are going to talk about how muscles use energy</p>
<p>and can change how they use energy</p>
<p>for sake of getting stronger.</p>
<p>If you like for also increasing the size,</p>
<p>so-called hypertrophy of muscle,</p>
<p>and for improving endurance,</p>
<p>as well as for improving posture</p>
<p>and how you move generally.</p>
<p>We will touch on some nutritional themes</p>
<p>and how that relates to muscle in particular,</p>
<p>a specific amino acid that if it&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>in your bloodstream frequently enough</p>
<p>and at sufficient levels can help you build</p>
<p>and improve the quality of muscle.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about specific exercise regimes</p>
<p>as well as of course, supplementation</p>
<p>and things that can enhance</p>
<p>neuromuscular performance overall.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about recovery.</p>
<p>Recovery as everybody knows is when things improve.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when neurons get better at controlling muscle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when muscle grows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when muscle gets more flexible.</p>
<p>None of that actually happens during training.</p>
<p>It happens after training.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of confusion</p>
<p>about how to optimize recovery</p>
<p>and how to measure whether or not you are recovered</p>
<p>and ready to come back in</p>
<p>for another neuromuscular training session.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about that as well.</p>
<p>Today is going to have a lot of protocols</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to come away with a lot of understanding</p>
<p>about how you move, how you work</p>
<p>and these incredible organs</p>
<p>that we call the nervous system and the musculature,</p>
<p>the so-called neuromuscular system.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>I want to just take about three minutes</p>
<p>and cover some essential summary of the previous episode.</p>
<p>In the previous episode, we talked about fat loss,</p>
<p>talked about shiver-induced fat loss.</p>
<p>We talked about NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis</p>
<p>for increasing caloric burn and fat oxidation.</p>
<p>And we talked about how to use cold</p>
<p>specifically to enhance fat loss.</p>
<p>I described a protocol</p>
<p>involving getting into cold of some sort,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s ice bath, cold shower,</p>
<p>some form of cold, it could even be a river or an ocean</p>
<p>if you have access to that,</p>
<p>and inducing shiver and then getting out,</p>
<p>not crossing your arms or huddling,</p>
<p>but allowing that cold to evaporate off you</p>
<p>and continuing to shiver</p>
<p>and then getting back into the colder environment</p>
<p>of water or stream or shower, et cetera.</p>
<p>All of that is described</p>
<p>in a beautifully illustrated protocol</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t illustrate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s beautifully illustrated</p>
<p>at thecoldplunge.com.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made that protocol for you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve made it available free of charge for you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no obligation there of any kind financially.</p>
<p>You can go to thecoldplunge.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little tab that says protocols</p>
<p>and you can download that protocol.</p>
<p>Someone there, I don&rsquo;t know who exactly illustrated it</p>
<p>and you can come away with a PDF</p>
<p>of what I described in the previous episode.</p>
<p>So I just want to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re aware of that resource.</p>
<p>The other announcement I&rsquo;d like to make</p>
<p>is that many of you have asked</p>
<p>how you can help support the podcast</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a very straightforward,</p>
<p>zero cost way to do that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to subscribe to our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>So if you go to YouTube,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already there watching this now,</p>
<p>hit the subscribe button.</p>
<p>That helps us tremendously</p>
<p>to get the word out more broadly about the podcast</p>
<p>and we thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Most people, when they hear the word muscle,</p>
<p>they just think about strength.</p>
<p>But of course, muscles are involved</p>
<p>in everything that we do.</p>
<p>They are involved in speaking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re involved in sitting and standing up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re involved in lifting objects, including ourselves.</p>
<p>They are absolutely essential</p>
<p>for maintaining how we breathe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving</p>
<p>and for skills of any kind.</p>
<p>So when we think about muscle,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t just want to think about muscle,</p>
<p>the meat that is muscle,</p>
<p>but what controls that muscle.</p>
<p>And no surprise,</p>
<p>what controls muscle is the nervous system.</p>
<p>The nervous system does that</p>
<p>through three main nodes of control, areas of control.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about these before on a previous podcast,</p>
<p>so I will keep this very brief.</p>
<p>Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex.</p>
<p>So those are in our skull</p>
<p>and those are involved in deliberate movement.</p>
<p>So if I decide that I&rsquo;m going to pick my pen up</p>
<p>and put it down, which is what I&rsquo;m doing right now,</p>
<p>my upper motor neurons were involved</p>
<p>in generating that movement.</p>
<p>Those upper motor neurons send signals</p>
<p>down to my spinal cord,</p>
<p>where there are two categories of neurons.</p>
<p>One are the lower motor neurons</p>
<p>and those lower motor neurons send little wires</p>
<p>that we call axons out to our muscles</p>
<p>and cause those muscles to contract.</p>
<p>They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle.</p>
<p>In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about acetylcholine in the brain,</p>
<p>which is vitally important for focus</p>
<p>and actually can gate neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>But in the neuromuscular system,</p>
<p>acetylcholine released from motor neurons is the way,</p>
<p>the only way that muscles can contract.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another category of neurons in the spinal cord</p>
<p>called central pattern generators or CPGs.</p>
<p>And those are involved in rhythmic movements.</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re walking or doing something</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have to think about it to do it deliberately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just happening reflexively,</p>
<p>that central pattern generators and motor neurons.</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re doing something deliberately,</p>
<p>that the top-down control, as we call it,</p>
<p>from the upper motor neurons comes in</p>
<p>and takes control of that system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve only got three ingredients.</p>
<p>You got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons,</p>
<p>and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also got the central pattern generators.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a terrifically simple system at that level.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re going to focus on today</p>
<p>is how that system can control muscle</p>
<p>in ways that make that system better.</p>
<p>Now, when I say better, I want to be very specific.</p>
<p>If your goal is to build larger muscles,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to use your nervous system</p>
<p>to trigger hypertrophy,</p>
<p>to increase the size of those muscles.</p>
<p>And it is indeed controlled by the nervous system.</p>
<p>So you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory</p>
<p>or that muscles grow in response to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just happening within the muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nerve to muscle connection</p>
<p>that actually creates hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk exactly about how to optimize that process.</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to improve endurance</p>
<p>or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness,</p>
<p>that is all accomplished by the way</p>
<p>that the nervous system engages muscles specifically.</p>
<p>And so what that means is we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>the central pattern generators,</p>
<p>or the lower motor neurons or all three</p>
<p>in order to get to some end point</p>
<p>of how the nervous system controls muscle.</p>
<p>So neurophysiology 101,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one piece of history</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s important to know.</p>
<p>Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>called movement the final common path.</p>
<p>Why did he say that?</p>
<p>Well, the whole reason for having a nervous system,</p>
<p>the whole reason for having a brain</p>
<p>is so that we can control our movements</p>
<p>in very dedicated ways.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons,</p>
<p>perhaps the predominant reason</p>
<p>why the human brain is so large.</p>
<p>You might think, oh, it&rsquo;s so large for thinking</p>
<p>and for creativity.</p>
<p>Ah, no, when you look at the amount of real estate</p>
<p>in the brain that&rsquo;s devoted to different aspects of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mainly vision, our ability to see, and movement,</p>
<p>our ability to engage in lots of different kinds</p>
<p>of movements, slow movements, fast movements,</p>
<p>explosive, et cetera.</p>
<p>Other animals don&rsquo;t have that ability</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the mental real estate.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the neural real estate in their brain.</p>
<p>They have neuromuscular junctions.</p>
<p>They have central pattern generators.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t have are these incredible</p>
<p>upper motor neurons that can direct activity</p>
<p>of the muscles in very specific ways.</p>
<p>So we can all feel blessed that we have this system.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to use that system</p>
<p>toward particular end points.</p>
<p>So if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles</p>
<p>in some particular movement of any kind,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a weightlifting exercise</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s a yoga movement</p>
<p>or simply picking up and putting down a pen,</p>
<p>we are engaging flexors and extensors.</p>
<p>And our body is covered with flexors</p>
<p>and extensors all over.</p>
<p>So for instance, our bicep is a flexor</p>
<p>and our tricep is an extensor.</p>
<p>Those are what are called antagonistic muscles.</p>
<p>They move the limbs in opposite directions.</p>
<p>So if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s flexion using your bicep.</p>
<p>If you move your wrist further away from your shoulder,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extension using your tricep.</p>
<p>And without getting into a lot of detail,</p>
<p>the way that the nerves and brain are wired up to muscle</p>
<p>make it such that when a flexor is activated,</p>
<p>when the nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine</p>
<p>onto the muscle to activate the biceps,</p>
<p>the triceps is inhibited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s prevented from engaging.</p>
<p>There are ways to bypass this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the typical mode of action.</p>
<p>The converse is also true.</p>
<p>When our tricep is inactivated, okay?</p>
<p>When we move our wrist away from our shoulder,</p>
<p>our bicep is inhibited.</p>
<p>And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles</p>
<p>and we have extensors in our lower back.</p>
<p>Many of you probably know this,</p>
<p>but some of you probably don&rsquo;t that your spine has flexors</p>
<p>to move basically your chin toward your waist.</p>
<p>And it has, those are your abdominal muscles among others.</p>
<p>And you have extensors that move your chin basically back,</p>
<p>like looking up toward the ceiling,</p>
<p>and those are your extensors.</p>
<p>You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but those movements of flexion and extension</p>
<p>and the fact that they are what we call</p>
<p>reciprocally innervated or mutual inhibition,</p>
<p>you hear different language around this,</p>
<p>is characteristic of most of our limb movements, okay?</p>
<p>So hamstring and quadricep,</p>
<p>the hamstring brings the ankle closer</p>
<p>back towards the glutes.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s lifting your heel up, right?</p>
<p>Which is almost always done toward the back.</p>
<p>Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor</p>
<p>opposite to the hamstrings.</p>
<p>So you get the idea.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s flexors and extensors</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the neurons that control those flexors</p>
<p>and extensors that allow us to move in particular ways.</p>
<p>So now you have heard neuromuscular physiology</p>
<p>in its simplest form,</p>
<p>but I do want this to be accessible.</p>
<p>I want to get just briefly,</p>
<p>just briefly into some of the underlying metabolism</p>
<p>of how muscles use and create energy.</p>
<p>Because in doing that,</p>
<p>we will be in a great position to understand</p>
<p>all the tools that follow</p>
<p>about how to optimize the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>for your particular goals.</p>
<p>So in the previous episode about fat loss,</p>
<p>we talked about lipolysis,</p>
<p>the breakdown of fat into fatty acids</p>
<p>so it can be used as fuel.</p>
<p>And it ended in a step where we got ATP,</p>
<p>which is the bottleneck and final common path</p>
<p>for all energy producing functions in the body.</p>
<p>There are other ways,</p>
<p>but basically ATP is the key element there.</p>
<p>Now with muscles, they don&rsquo;t function on fats normally.</p>
<p>What they are going to function on,</p>
<p>their ability to move and their ability to do things</p>
<p>and allow us to move in any way that we want to</p>
<p>is based on a process of glycolysis.</p>
<p>The breakdown of things like glycogen</p>
<p>and glucose into energy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very simple process.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know any chemistry.</p>
<p>So if I say the words carbon or hydrogen</p>
<p>or something like that, don&rsquo;t freak out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to understand any chemistry.</p>
<p>But basically what happens is you&rsquo;ve got this</p>
<p>available sugar resource that&rsquo;s stored in muscle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s glucose.</p>
<p>And that glucose has six carbons</p>
<p>and six waters basically.</p>
<p>That can be broken down</p>
<p>into two sets of three carbons, all right?</p>
<p>So basically you take glucose and you break it</p>
<p>into these two little batches of carbons</p>
<p>that we call pyruvates.</p>
<p>So six divided by two is three.</p>
<p>So you get three and three pyruvates.</p>
<p>And that generates a little bit of ATP of energy,</p>
<p>but just a little bit.</p>
<p>Now, if there&rsquo;s oxygen available, okay?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s sufficient oxygen there,</p>
<p>what can happen is that pyruvate</p>
<p>can be brought to the mitochondria</p>
<p>and through a whole set of things</p>
<p>that you probably don&rsquo;t want to hear about right now,</p>
<p>like the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle.</p>
<p>What happens is it&rsquo;s broken down</p>
<p>and you get 28 to 30 ATP, which is a lot of ATP.</p>
<p>So the only things you need to know,</p>
<p>the only things you need to know about this process</p>
<p>is that glucose and glycogen</p>
<p>are broken down into pyruvate.</p>
<p>You get a little bit of energy from that.</p>
<p>And when I say energy, I mean the ability to move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fuel, it literally just gets burned up.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s oxygen available, and that&rsquo;s key,</p>
<p>then within the mitochondria,</p>
<p>you can create 28 to 30 ATP, which is a lot of ATP.</p>
<p>Now, what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means that movement of muscle</p>
<p>is metabolically expensive.</p>
<p>And indeed, compared to other tissues,</p>
<p>compared to fat, compared to bone,</p>
<p>compared to almost all other tissues except brain tissue,</p>
<p>muscle is the most metabolically demanding,</p>
<p>which is why people who have more muscle</p>
<p>relative to adipose tissue to fat,</p>
<p>they can eat more and they&rsquo;re more of a furnace.</p>
<p>They just kind of burn that up, okay?</p>
<p>So even if you didn&rsquo;t understand anything that I just said,</p>
<p>what you probably did hear and that I hope you heard</p>
<p>is that if you have oxygen around,</p>
<p>you can create energy from this fuel source</p>
<p>that we call glycogen and glucose.</p>
<p>But what if there isn&rsquo;t oxygen around?</p>
<p>And what is that like?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve experienced that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about oxygen in the environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about oxygen in the muscle.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever carried a box while moving</p>
<p>or you were carrying heavy groceries to the car</p>
<p>or you were exercising particularly hard</p>
<p>and you felt the burn, well, that burning,</p>
<p>which most people think is lactic acid,</p>
<p>is actually a process by which pyruvate,</p>
<p>which as I said before,</p>
<p>normally could be converted into ATP if there&rsquo;s oxygen.</p>
<p>Well, if there&rsquo;s not enough oxygen</p>
<p>because that muscle is working too hard or too long,</p>
<p>what ends up happening is that a hydrogen molecule</p>
<p>comes in there and you get something called lactate.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, humans don&rsquo;t make lactic acid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another species.</p>
<p>We make lactate and we think,</p>
<p>and we hear that lactate is bad.</p>
<p>We need to buffer the burn or avoid the burn,</p>
<p>that lactic acid and lactate are what prevent us</p>
<p>for performing as well as we ought to be able to</p>
<p>or for going as far as we possibly could</p>
<p>in an endurance event.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true at all.</p>
<p>Lactate has three functions,</p>
<p>all of which are really interesting and really important.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s a buffer against acidity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want muscle to get too acidic</p>
<p>because it can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want any body tissue to get too acidic.</p>
<p>So that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment.</p>
<p>That and lactate, what most people call lactic acid,</p>
<p>but again, we don&rsquo;t make lactic acid.</p>
<p>Lactate is there to buffer that,</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of burn.</p>
<p>So most people have this exactly backwards.</p>
<p>So when you feel that burn, that is not lactic acid.</p>
<p>That is lactate that&rsquo;s present to suppress the burn,</p>
<p>to suppress acidity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a fuel.</p>
<p>When you feel that burn,</p>
<p>lactate is shuttled to those areas of the muscle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an actual fuel burning process</p>
<p>where in the absence of oxygen,</p>
<p>you can continue to generate muscular contractions.</p>
<p>Now this is informative because it also tells us</p>
<p>that that burning, that acidity that we feel</p>
<p>can inhibit the way that our muscles work,</p>
<p>but that lactate comes in</p>
<p>and allows our muscles to continue to function.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about what this whole lactate thing and the burn means,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really important process.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing to me that most people understand it</p>
<p>in exactly the incorrect way.</p>
<p>They think, oh, lactic acid is bad and the burn is bad.</p>
<p>No, it reveals a number of really important things</p>
<p>are going on with this vital molecule lactate,</p>
<p>which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn,</p>
<p>as well as act as a fuel.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s where it gets really, really cool.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have enough of an incentive to exercise</p>
<p>based on all the information out there</p>
<p>about how it&rsquo;ll make you live longer</p>
<p>and make your heart better, et cetera,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a reason that regardless</p>
<p>of what kind of exercise you do,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s weight training or running or cycling or swimming,</p>
<p>that every once in a while, about 10% of the time,</p>
<p>you should exercise to the point of intensity</p>
<p>where you start to feel that so-called burn, right?</p>
<p>The reason for that is that lactate shows up</p>
<p>to the site of the burn, so to speak,</p>
<p>and it acts as a hormonal signal</p>
<p>for other organs of the body in a very positive way, okay?</p>
<p>As you may recall from a very early episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I talked about what a hormone is and how it works.</p>
<p>We have lots of different kinds of hormones,</p>
<p>but hormones are chemicals that are released</p>
<p>in one location in the body and travel have effects</p>
<p>on lots of other organs of the body.</p>
<p>So when I say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal,</p>
<p>what I mean is that it&rsquo;s in a position to influence tissues</p>
<p>that are outside of the muscle.</p>
<p>And basically, it can send signals to the heart,</p>
<p>to the liver, and to the brain,</p>
<p>and it can have effects on the heart, the liver,</p>
<p>and the brain that are very positive, okay?</p>
<p>So just to zoom out for a second,</p>
<p>I promise we won&rsquo;t get any more technical than this.</p>
<p>We will get into tools and protocols</p>
<p>that are really straightforward,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m telling you is that if you feel a burn</p>
<p>from a particular exercise or movement,</p>
<p>that burn is going to be buffered</p>
<p>by this molecule we call lactate.</p>
<p>Lactate will then provide additional fuel</p>
<p>for additional work, so this is a good incentive,</p>
<p>provided you can do it safely</p>
<p>to quote-unquote work through the burn.</p>
<p>That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate,</p>
<p>which comes in and allows you to do more work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a signal to stop necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, stop if you&rsquo;re doing something unsafe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a signal that lactate should come in</p>
<p>and allow you to continue to do work,</p>
<p>and it can act as a hormonal signal.</p>
<p>Lactate can then travel to the heart</p>
<p>and to the liver and to the brain</p>
<p>and can enhance their function in positive ways,</p>
<p>not just in those moments,</p>
<p>but in the period of time that follows.</p>
<p>So many people are curious about how they can exercise</p>
<p>to make their brain better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the most common questions I get.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m telling you is that provided you can do it safely,</p>
<p>by engaging the so-called burn,</p>
<p>which is a different threshold for everybody, right?</p>
<p>Your hill run will be different than my hill run</p>
<p>to generate the burn,</p>
<p>but provided you can do that for about 10%</p>
<p>of your workouts or of an individual workout</p>
<p>or activity of any kind,</p>
<p>you are generating the activity</p>
<p>of this lactate-based hormonal signal</p>
<p>that can improve the function of neurons.</p>
<p>And it does that, if you want to know,</p>
<p>for the aficionados, by improving the function</p>
<p>of another cell type called the astrocytes,</p>
<p>which are a glial cell type, okay?</p>
<p>Which are very involved in clearance of debris</p>
<p>from the brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re involved in the formation of synapses,</p>
<p>connections between neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>So put simply, if you&rsquo;re an exerciser,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing movement of any kind,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in allocating some of that movement</p>
<p>toward enhancing brain, heart, and liver health,</p>
<p>there is a nice set of scientific data</p>
<p>that points to the fact that getting lactate</p>
<p>shuttled to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation</p>
<p>is advantageous for the health of those other tissues.</p>
<p>So, as I mentioned, that burn is present</p>
<p>from lack of oxygen being present.</p>
<p>And then the hydrogen comes in and you get this lactate.</p>
<p>But this process of lactate acting as a buffer of fuel</p>
<p>and a positive hormonal signal for other tissues</p>
<p>occurs only if there&rsquo;s oxygen.</p>
<p>So if you feel the burn,</p>
<p>you definitely want to focus on your breathing</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>That would be the time to take deep inhales</p>
<p>and try and bring more oxygen into your system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not a time to hold your breath.</p>
<p>And if ever you&rsquo;ve run to the point of feeling the burn</p>
<p>and then you were exercised in any way on the treadmill</p>
<p>or on the bike or whatever, and felt that burn,</p>
<p>and then you held your breath, it feels much more intense.</p>
<p>By breathing, you bring lactate to the site</p>
<p>and you are able to allow lactate to act more as a buffer,</p>
<p>a fuel, and a hormonal signal.</p>
<p>And the reason I brought this up today is because,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, so many people are interested</p>
<p>in using exercise, not just for sake of improving</p>
<p>physical health and wellbeing and performance,</p>
<p>but also for enhancing their brain.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of data out there</p>
<p>speaking to the findings that exercise of various kinds</p>
<p>can increase neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons.</p>
<p>Well, the unfortunate news is that</p>
<p>while that&rsquo;s true in mice,</p>
<p>there is very little evidence for enhanced neurogenesis</p>
<p>from exercise or otherwise in humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit,</p>
<p>and there are a few sites within the brain</p>
<p>such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus,</p>
<p>which may be involved in the formation of new memories.</p>
<p>To be clear, the dentate gyrus is definitely involved</p>
<p>in the formation of new memories,</p>
<p>whether or not the new neurons that are added there</p>
<p>in humans are involved in new memories.</p>
<p>The evidence for that is weak at best, frankly,</p>
<p>whereas in animals, the data are quite strong.</p>
<p>But most of the data point to the fact</p>
<p>that hormonal signals,</p>
<p>things that are transported in the blood</p>
<p>during exercise are what are beneficial for the brain,</p>
<p>excuse me, and that those signals</p>
<p>are not causing the increase in the number of neurons</p>
<p>in the dentate gyrus or otherwise,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more about the health of the connections</p>
<p>between the neurons, growth factors of various kinds,</p>
<p>things like IGF-1, there&rsquo;s a long list of these things.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve heard that exercise increases</p>
<p>the number of neurons in your brain,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>And that probably is a good thing, frankly,</p>
<p>because we always hear more neurons, more neurons,</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>But the brain doesn&rsquo;t do so well</p>
<p>with bringing in entirely new elements.</p>
<p>It has a hard time negotiating that</p>
<p>and making use of those new elements.</p>
<p>We know about this from things like the cochlear implant</p>
<p>where deaf people are given a device</p>
<p>where they suddenly can hear.</p>
<p>Some people really like that,</p>
<p>deaf people really like that and can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Other deaf people find that it&rsquo;s very intrusive,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to take an existing neural circuit</p>
<p>in the brain and incorporate a lot</p>
<p>of new information into it.</p>
<p>So new neurons, as great as that sounds,</p>
<p>more neurons, more neurons,</p>
<p>it actually might not be the best way</p>
<p>for the nervous system to change and modify itself</p>
<p>and to promote its own longevity.</p>
<p>So when I tell you,</p>
<p>you know, not such great evidence</p>
<p>for new neurons past puberty,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the data really show in humans.</p>
<p>And I sort of knock back the data</p>
<p>on exercise and neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let that depress you.</p>
<p>If you have dementia in your family,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t translate that into a necessarily</p>
<p>that you will develop dementia.</p>
<p>Understand that exercise is still beneficial</p>
<p>for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s going to be doing it</p>
<p>through these hormonal signals,</p>
<p>things like IGF-1,</p>
<p>things like this lactate pathway</p>
<p>when you experience the burn from exercise.</p>
<p>And again, you don&rsquo;t want to try</p>
<p>and get this feeling of a burn</p>
<p>throughout the entire episode of exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be far too intense</p>
<p>and would inhibit your recovery.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be good for performance either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about 10% of your total effort</p>
<p>in any one exercise bout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to give you this positive effect.</p>
<p>So now you know how to devote a small portion</p>
<p>of your exercise, 10%,</p>
<p>in order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues,</p>
<p>namely your heart, your liver, and your brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d now like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction</p>
<p>to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,</p>
<p>as well as improving muscle strength.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that it&rsquo;s not always the case</p>
<p>that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger.</p>
<p>There are ways for muscles to get stronger</p>
<p>without getting bigger.</p>
<p>However, increasing the size of a muscle</p>
<p>almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle,</p>
<p>at least to some degree.</p>
<p>Reasons why most everyone should want</p>
<p>to get their muscles stronger</p>
<p>is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker</p>
<p>across the lifespan.</p>
<p>So when I say getting stronger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily about being able to move</p>
<p>increasing amounts of weight in the gym,</p>
<p>although if that&rsquo;s your goal,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m about to discuss will be relevant to that,</p>
<p>but rather to offset some of the normal decline</p>
<p>in strength and posture and the ability</p>
<p>to generate a large range of movement safely</p>
<p>that occurs as we age.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>we just tend to lose function in this neuromuscular system</p>
<p>as we get older and doing things to offset that</p>
<p>has been shown again and again to be beneficial</p>
<p>for the neuromuscular system, for protection of injury,</p>
<p>for enhancing the strength of bones and bone density.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of reasons to use resistance exercise</p>
<p>that extend far beyond just the desire</p>
<p>to increase muscle size,</p>
<p>because I know many of you are interested</p>
<p>in increasing muscle size, but many of you are not.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an important principle of muscle physiology</p>
<p>called the Henneman Size Principle.</p>
<p>And the Henneman Size Principle essentially says</p>
<p>that we recruit what are called motor units.</p>
<p>Motor units are just the connections</p>
<p>between nerve and muscle</p>
<p>in a pattern that staircases</p>
<p>from low threshold to high threshold.</p>
<p>What this means is when you pick up something that is light,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use the minimum amount</p>
<p>of nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you pick up an object that&rsquo;s heavy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use the minimum amount</p>
<p>of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy</p>
<p>in order to move that object.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically a conservation of energy principle.</p>
<p>Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement,</p>
<p>what will happen is you will tend to recruit</p>
<p>more and more motor units with time.</p>
<p>And that process of recruiting more neurons,</p>
<p>more lower motor neurons,</p>
<p>as if you recall from the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>these lower motor neurons are in our spinal cord</p>
<p>and they actually dump a chemical, acetylcholine on muscle,</p>
<p>cause the muscles to contract.</p>
<p>As you recruit more and more of these motor units,</p>
<p>these connections between these lower motor neurons</p>
<p>and muscle, that&rsquo;s when you start to get changes</p>
<p>in the muscle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you open the gate for the potential</p>
<p>for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what your goal is.</p>
<p>And so the way this process works</p>
<p>has been badly misunderstood</p>
<p>in the kind of online literature of weight training</p>
<p>and bodybuilding, and even in sports physiology.</p>
<p>The Henneman size principle is kind of a foundational</p>
<p>principle within muscle physiology,</p>
<p>but many people have come to interpret it by saying</p>
<p>that the way to recruit high threshold motor units,</p>
<p>the ones that are hard to get to,</p>
<p>is to just use heavy weights.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll talk about, the research supports</p>
<p>that weights in a very large range</p>
<p>of sort of a percentage of your maximum,</p>
<p>anywhere from 30 to 80%.</p>
<p>So weights that are not very light,</p>
<p>but are moderately light, too heavy,</p>
<p>can cause changes in the connections</p>
<p>between nerve and muscle that lead to muscle strength</p>
<p>and muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Put differently, heavy weights can help build muscle</p>
<p>and strength, but they are not required.</p>
<p>What one has to do is adhere</p>
<p>to a certain number of parameters,</p>
<p>just a couple of key variables</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll spell out for you.</p>
<p>And if you do that,</p>
<p>you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy, muscle size,</p>
<p>and or muscle strength, if that&rsquo;s what you want to do.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to use heavy weights</p>
<p>in order to do that.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure the power lifters</p>
<p>and the people that like to move heavy weights around</p>
<p>will say, no, if you want to get strong,</p>
<p>you absolutely have to lift heavy weights.</p>
<p>And that might be true if you want to get very strong,</p>
<p>but for most people who are interested</p>
<p>in supporting their muscular</p>
<p>such that they offset any age-related decline in strength</p>
<p>or in increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree,</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t a need to lie</p>
<p>about the Henneman size principle,</p>
<p>which many people out there are doing,</p>
<p>and claiming that you absolutely need to use</p>
<p>the heaviest weights possible</p>
<p>in order to build strength and muscle.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to explain how all of this works</p>
<p>in simple terms.</p>
<p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s just talk about what hypertrophy is</p>
<p>and what strength changes in the muscle are.</p>
<p>We can make this very simple as well.</p>
<p>If this were a muscle physiology class,</p>
<p>we would talk all about myofibrils and sarcomeres</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the purpose of today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that,</p>
<p>as well as a lot of the other information</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to discuss in more detail,</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube channel</p>
<p>and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a PhD and a full professor in exercise physiology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s extremely knowledgeable</p>
<p>in this entire area of science-based tools for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>how strength and hypertrophy really work.</p>
<p>His lab does everything from biopsy on muscles,</p>
<p>working with athletes and typical folks as well.</p>
<p>A lot of the information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to hear from me</p>
<p>in the next 15 minutes or so</p>
<p>comes from an extensive exploration of the work</p>
<p>that he and his colleagues have done,</p>
<p>as well as folks like Brad Schoenfield,</p>
<p>another academic who&rsquo;s superb</p>
<p>in this whole space of muscle physiology,</p>
<p>and from a lengthy conversation that I had</p>
<p>with Andy, Dr. Galpin, prior to this episode.</p>
<p>So if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>we have to ask what is changing</p>
<p>when muscles get larger or stronger?</p>
<p>And there are really just three ways</p>
<p>that muscles can be stimulated to change.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s review those three ways</p>
<p>and talk about what happens inside the muscle.</p>
<p>So there are three major stimuli</p>
<p>for changing the way that muscle works</p>
<p>and making muscles stronger, larger, or better in some way.</p>
<p>And those are stress, tension, and damage.</p>
<p>Those three things don&rsquo;t necessarily all have to be present,</p>
<p>but stress of some kind has to exist.</p>
<p>Something has to be different</p>
<p>in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle</p>
<p>and the way that the muscle contracts or performs</p>
<p>that makes the muscle need to change.</p>
<p>So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain.</p>
<p>Something needs to happen.</p>
<p>Certain chemicals need to be present.</p>
<p>Certain processes need to happen,</p>
<p>or else a tissue simply won&rsquo;t change itself.</p>
<p>But if those processes and events do happen,</p>
<p>then the tissue has essentially no option</p>
<p>except but to change.</p>
<p>So muscles move, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles,</p>
<p>but they move because they have these things</p>
<p>called myosin and actin filaments.</p>
<p>And if you want to read up on this,</p>
<p>you can look on the internet.</p>
<p>You can put the sliding filament theory</p>
<p>of muscle contraction</p>
<p>if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class.</p>
<p>But basically, along the length of the muscle,</p>
<p>you have what&rsquo;s called myosin.</p>
<p>And just think of myosin as kind of like a wire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bunch of beads and wires</p>
<p>that extend across the muscle.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the simplest way to describe it.</p>
<p>And the myosin is surrounded</p>
<p>by these little beads called actin.</p>
<p>The way muscles get bigger</p>
<p>is that basically the myosin gets thicker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a protein, right?</p>
<p>And it gets thicker.</p>
<p>So put this in your mind.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re watching it on YouTube,</p>
<p>the way to think about this whole actin, myosin thing</p>
<p>and muscles getting bigger</p>
<p>is imagine that you&rsquo;re holding a bouquet of balloons,</p>
<p>a bunch of balloons by their strings,</p>
<p>except you&rsquo;re not holding the strings all at their bottom.</p>
<p>So the bouquet isn&rsquo;t nicely arranged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some balloons that are all up at the top</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re holding the strings down at the bottom.</p>
<p>Imagine that one of the balloons</p>
<p>is very close to your hand.</p>
<p>Another one is a little bit higher up.</p>
<p>And so this bouquet is very disorganized.</p>
<p>In other words, the string extending out of your hand,</p>
<p>the strings rather extending out of your hand</p>
<p>are all different lengths.</p>
<p>And so the balloons are all over the place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what myosin looks like in the muscle.</p>
<p>And those strings are what we call the filaments.</p>
<p>And then the myosin head that is the balloon.</p>
<p>When you stress a muscle properly,</p>
<p>or you give it sufficient tension,</p>
<p>or you damage the muscle just enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an adaptive response that takes place</p>
<p>where protein is synthesized.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very specific protein, it&rsquo;s myosin.</p>
<p>The myosin gets thicker.</p>
<p>In other words, the balloons get bigger.</p>
<p>So the way to think about muscle growth</p>
<p>and the way to think about muscles getting stronger</p>
<p>is that those balloons get bigger</p>
<p>and the muscle gets thicker.</p>
<p>Now, the question then should be, as always,</p>
<p>how does that happen?</p>
<p>I mean, the muscle doesn&rsquo;t really know anything</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in the outside world.</p>
<p>The way it happens is the nerve,</p>
<p>the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger.</p>
<p>And it does that through what we call a signaling cascade.</p>
<p>It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t whisper to it or shout at it,</p>
<p>hey, get bigger.</p>
<p>What it does, it releases certain chemicals</p>
<p>that within the muscle,</p>
<p>there are certain chemicals released rather</p>
<p>that make those balloons, as I&rsquo;m referring to them,</p>
<p>the myosin get thicker.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the stimulus for doing that.</p>
<p>And if already in your mind, you&rsquo;re imagining,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle</p>
<p>are going to get thick, thick, thick, thick,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just going to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about that.</p>
<p>People invest a ton of time and energy</p>
<p>into trying to make their muscles larger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually much harder for people to do</p>
<p>than you might think.</p>
<p>But I do want to give one exception</p>
<p>because it illustrates an important principle</p>
<p>of where we&rsquo;re headed next.</p>
<p>Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow,</p>
<p>how well muscles can grow or how poorly</p>
<p>or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow.</p>
<p>Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too bulky,</p>
<p>for instance, are afraid of lifting weights.</p>
<p>But I think the research shows now that everyone</p>
<p>of pretty much every age should be doing some sort</p>
<p>of resistance exercise,</p>
<p>even if that&rsquo;s body weight exercises</p>
<p>in order to offset this age-related decline</p>
<p>in muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera,</p>
<p>improve bone density.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing good about getting frail</p>
<p>and weak over time.</p>
<p>And people who invest the effort</p>
<p>into doing resistance exercise of some kind,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s with bands or with weights</p>
<p>or with body weight really benefit tremendously</p>
<p>at a whole body level, at a systemic level,</p>
<p>as well as in terms of muscle strength.</p>
<p>There is a good predictor of how well</p>
<p>or how efficient you will be in building the strength</p>
<p>and or if you like the size of a given muscle.</p>
<p>And it has everything to do with those upper motor neurons</p>
<p>that are involved in deliberate control of muscle.</p>
<p>You can actually do this test right now.</p>
<p>You can just kind of march across your body mentally</p>
<p>and see whether or not you can independently contract</p>
<p>any or all of your muscles.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you are sitting in a chair</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re standing, see whether or not</p>
<p>you can contract your calf muscle</p>
<p>just using those upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>sending a signal down</p>
<p>and deliberately isolating the calf muscle, okay?</p>
<p>If you can contract the calf muscle hard</p>
<p>to the point where that muscle</p>
<p>almost feels like it&rsquo;s trying to cramp,</p>
<p>like it hurts just a little bit,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not going to be extremely painful</p>
<p>nor is it going to have no sensation whatsoever,</p>
<p>chances are you have very good upper motor neuron</p>
<p>to calf control.</p>
<p>And chances are, if you can isolate that,</p>
<p>what they call the brain or mind muscle connection,</p>
<p>and you can contract the muscle to the point</p>
<p>where it cramps a little bit,</p>
<p>that you hold a decent to high potential</p>
<p>to change the strength and the size of that muscle</p>
<p>if you train it properly.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a hard time doing that,</p>
<p>chances are you won&rsquo;t be able to do that.</p>
<p>If for instance, you focus on your back muscle,</p>
<p>like we all have these muscles called the lat,</p>
<p>the latissimus dorsi muscles,</p>
<p>which basically are involved in chin-ups</p>
<p>and things like that, but their function</p>
<p>from a more of a kinesiology standpoint</p>
<p>is to move the elbow back behind the body, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about flexing your bicep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about moving your elbow back behind your body.</p>
<p>If you can do that mentally,</p>
<p>or you can do that physical movement</p>
<p>of moving your elbow back behind your body</p>
<p>and you can contract that muscle hard,</p>
<p>chances are that you have the capacity</p>
<p>to enhance the strength and or size of that particular muscle</p>
<p>because you have the neural control of that muscle.</p>
<p>This is a key feature of the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>to appreciate as we begin to talk more</p>
<p>about specific protocols.</p>
<p>Because everything about muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>about stimulating muscle growth</p>
<p>is about generating isolated contractions,</p>
<p>about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way.</p>
<p>Whereas with strength,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about using musculature as a system,</p>
<p>moving weights, moving resistance, moving the body.</p>
<p>The specific goal of hypertrophy</p>
<p>is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways</p>
<p>so that you stimulate the chemical</p>
<p>and signaling transduction events in muscles</p>
<p>so that those muscles respond by getting larger.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a critical distinction</p>
<p>in terms of getting stronger</p>
<p>versus trying to get muscles to be larger,</p>
<p>hypertrophy per se,</p>
<p>and it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles.</p>
<p>Muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that we normally do.</p>
<p>When we walk, we don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>okay, right calf contract, left calf contract.</p>
<p>No, you just generate those rhythmic movements</p>
<p>and of course, there&rsquo;s no reason for them</p>
<p>to get stronger or larger in response to those movements.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you were to do a kind of strange experiment</p>
<p>of attaching 30 pound weights to your ankles</p>
<p>and you were to do those movements.</p>
<p>Well, if you weren&rsquo;t specifically contracting your calves</p>
<p>in each step, there&rsquo;s no reason for the calves</p>
<p>to take on the bulk of the work</p>
<p>and you would distribute that work across your hip flexors</p>
<p>and other aspects of your musculature.</p>
<p>Your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency.</p>
<p>It seeks to spread out the effort.</p>
<p>So you can nest this as a principle for yourself,</p>
<p>which is if you want to get stronger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about moving progressively greater loads</p>
<p>or increasing the amount of weight that you move.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re specifically interested</p>
<p>in generating hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about trying to generate those really hard,</p>
<p>almost painful, localized contractions of muscle.</p>
<p>Now, of course, how much weight you use</p>
<p>in order to generate those contractions</p>
<p>will also impact hypertrophy.</p>
<p>But I think most people don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>the mind-muscle connection.</p>
<p>It sounds like a great thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually one of the things you want to avoid</p>
<p>if your goal is simply to become more supple</p>
<p>or to become stronger.</p>
<p>You want to do the movements properly and safely, of course,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the opposite of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>where with hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really trying to make that particular muscle,</p>
<p>sometimes two muscles, do the majority, if not all the work.</p>
<p>Whereas in moving force loads,</p>
<p>in trying to generate activity of any kind,</p>
<p>like lifting a bar or doing a chin-up or something,</p>
<p>those so-called compound movements</p>
<p>that involve a lot of muscle groups,</p>
<p>if your goal is to be better at those,</p>
<p>you want to avoid isolating any one particular muscle.</p>
<p>Now, I know this probably comes across</p>
<p>as a kind of an obvious duh,</p>
<p>especially to the folks that have spent a lot of time</p>
<p>in the gym aimed at getting hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but I think most people don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the nerve-to-muscle connections</p>
<p>and the distinction between</p>
<p>isolating nerve-to-muscle connections</p>
<p>versus distributing the work of nerve-to-muscle connections</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s vital in determining whether or not</p>
<p>you generate hypertrophy,</p>
<p>isolated nerve-to-muscle contractions,</p>
<p>versus strength and offsetting strength loss,</p>
<p>which would be distributed nerve-to-muscle connections.</p>
<p>If ever there was an area of practical science</p>
<p>that was very confused, very controversial,</p>
<p>and almost combative at times,</p>
<p>it would be this issue of how best to train.</p>
<p>I suppose the only thing that&rsquo;s even more barbed wire</p>
<p>of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health.</p>
<p>Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle.</p>
<p>And the scientific literature has a lot to say</p>
<p>about both of those things.</p>
<p>Again, my sources for what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.</p>
<p>I know there are other excellent people</p>
<p>out there in the field, but I really trust his work.</p>
<p>He does very controlled studies.</p>
<p>He spent a lot of time in this space.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really exciting</p>
<p>is that in just the last three years or so,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a tremendous amount of information</p>
<p>to come out about the practical steps that one can take</p>
<p>in order to maximize the benefits</p>
<p>of resistance exercise of any kind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to talk about those,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to talk about the research.</p>
<p>I will provide some links,</p>
<p>both to a couple of the more in-depth tutorials</p>
<p>from Dr. Galpin, as well as some of the papers</p>
<p>that the information I&rsquo;m about to tell you stems from.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information saying</p>
<p>that you need to move weights</p>
<p>that are 80 to 90% of your one rep maximum,</p>
<p>or 70%, or cycle that for three weeks on,</p>
<p>and then go to more moderate weights.</p>
<p>There are a lot of paths.</p>
<p>As some people say, there are a lot of ways</p>
<p>to add up numbers to get 100.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a near infinite number of ways</p>
<p>to add up different numbers to get to 100.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s very clear now</p>
<p>from all the literature that&rsquo;s transpired,</p>
<p>and especially from the literature</p>
<p>in this last three years,</p>
<p>is that once you know roughly your one repetition maximum,</p>
<p>the maximum amount of weight</p>
<p>that you can perform an exercise with</p>
<p>for one repetition in good form, full range of motion,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very clear that moving weights,</p>
<p>or using bands, or using body weight, for instance,</p>
<p>in the 30 to 80% of one rep maximum,</p>
<p>that is going to be the most beneficial range</p>
<p>in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength,</p>
<p>so muscle growth and strength.</p>
<p>And there will be a bias.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moving weights that are in the 75%, 80% range,</p>
<p>or maybe even going above that, 85 and 90%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to bias your improvements</p>
<p>towards strength gains.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>And if you use weights that are in the 30%</p>
<p>of your one repetition maximum, or 40% or 50%,</p>
<p>and doing many more repetitions, of course,</p>
<p>then you are biasing towards hypertrophy</p>
<p>and what some people like to call muscle endurance,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a little bit of a complicated term</p>
<p>because endurance we almost always think of</p>
<p>as relating to running or swimming</p>
<p>or some long bouts of activity.</p>
<p>So 30 to 80% of one repetition maximums,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to matter for sake of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>except at the far ends</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re really trying to bias for strength.</p>
<p>Now, it is clear, however,</p>
<p>that one needs to perform those sets to failure</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t perform another repetition</p>
<p>in good form again, or near to failure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all sorts of interesting nomenclature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s popping up all over the internet,</p>
<p>some of which is scientific,</p>
<p>some of which is not scientific</p>
<p>about how you are supposed to perceive</p>
<p>how close you were to failure, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there are some very interesting principles</p>
<p>that relate to how the nerves connect to the muscles</p>
<p>that strongly predict whether or not this exercise</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re performing will be beneficial for you or not.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>For individuals that are untrained,</p>
<p>meaning they have been doing resistance exercise</p>
<p>for anywhere from zero, probably out to about two years,</p>
<p>although for some people it might be zero to one year,</p>
<p>but those are the so-called beginners,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of untrained.</p>
<p>For those people, the key parameter</p>
<p>seems to be to perform enough sets</p>
<p>of a given exercise per muscle per week, okay?</p>
<p>The same is also true for people that have been training</p>
<p>for one or two years or more.</p>
<p>What differs is how many sets to perform</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re trained or untrained.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been doing some resistance exercise</p>
<p>kind of on and off over the years,</p>
<p>and you decide you want to get serious about that</p>
<p>for sake of sport or offsetting age-related declines</p>
<p>in strength, the range of sets to do</p>
<p>in order to improve strength,</p>
<p>to activate these cascades in the muscle,</p>
<p>ranges anywhere from two, believe it or not,</p>
<p>to 20 per week.</p>
<p>Again, these are sets per week,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t necessarily all have to be performed</p>
<p>in the same weight training session.</p>
<p>I will talk about numbers of sessions.</p>
<p>So it appears that five sets per week</p>
<p>in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range,</p>
<p>getting close to failure</p>
<p>or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t really full muscular failure,</p>
<p>but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle</p>
<p>or move the weight in good form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go deeper into that in a moment,</p>
<p>but about five sets per week is what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>just to maintain your muscle.</p>
<p>So think about that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s kind of averse</p>
<p>to resistance training,</p>
<p>you are going to lose muscle size and strength.</p>
<p>Your metabolism will drop.</p>
<p>Your posture will get worse.</p>
<p>Everything in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity</p>
<p>will get worse over time</p>
<p>unless you are generating five sets</p>
<p>or more of this 30% to 80%</p>
<p>of your one repetition maximum per week, okay?</p>
<p>So what this means is for the typical person</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t done a lot of weight training,</p>
<p>you need to do at least five sets per muscle group.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s just to maintain.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this huge range</p>
<p>that goes all the way up to 15,</p>
<p>and in some case, 20 sets per week.</p>
<p>Now, how many sets you perform</p>
<p>is going to depend on the intensity</p>
<p>of the work that you perform.</p>
<p>This is where it gets a little bit controversial,</p>
<p>but I think nowadays most people agree,</p>
<p>and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10%,</p>
<p>not to be confused with the 10% we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>but 10% of the sets of a given workout</p>
<p>or 10% of workouts overall</p>
<p>should be of the high-intensity sort</p>
<p>where one is actually working to muscular failure.</p>
<p>Now, I say not true muscular failure</p>
<p>because in theory, you have a concentric movement,</p>
<p>which is the kind of lifting of the weight,</p>
<p>and then you have the eccentric portion</p>
<p>of muscle contraction, which is the lowering.</p>
<p>And the eccentric movements,</p>
<p>because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen</p>
<p>and that sliding actin myosin that we talked about before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always stronger in lowering something</p>
<p>than you are in lifting it.</p>
<p>But the point being that most of your training,</p>
<p>most of your sets should be not to failure.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is it allows you</p>
<p>to do more volume of work</p>
<p>without fatiguing the nervous system</p>
<p>and depleting the nerve to muscle connection</p>
<p>in ways that are detrimental.</p>
<p>So we can make this simple.</p>
<p>Perform anywhere from five to 15 sets</p>
<p>of resistance exercise per week,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s per muscle,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in this 30 to 80%</p>
<p>of your one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>That seems to be the most scientifically supported way</p>
<p>of offsetting any decline in muscle strength</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re working in the kind of five set range</p>
<p>and in increasing muscle strength</p>
<p>when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat to that is everyone varies</p>
<p>and muscles vary in terms of their recoverability.</p>
<p>Depending on how well you can control</p>
<p>the contraction of muscles deliberately,</p>
<p>and you can actually figure that out</p>
<p>by sort of marching.</p>
<p>You might take five minutes</p>
<p>and just kind of march across your body</p>
<p>and mentally try and control the contractions of muscles</p>
<p>in a very deliberate way</p>
<p>to the point where you can generate a hard contraction.</p>
<p>And you may have to move a limb</p>
<p>in order to do this, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about just mentally contracting your bicep</p>
<p>without moving your wrist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about doing that without any weight in hand</p>
<p>or any band or any resistance.</p>
<p>If you can generate a high intensity contraction</p>
<p>using these upper motor neuron</p>
<p>lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,</p>
<p>you might think, well,</p>
<p>I should perform many more sets, right?</p>
<p>But actually the opposite is true.</p>
<p>If you can generate high intensity muscular contractions</p>
<p>using your brain, using your neurons,</p>
<p>it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate the muscle</p>
<p>to maintain itself and to stimulate the muscle</p>
<p>in order to grow or get stronger.</p>
<p>So the more efficient you are in recruiting motor units,</p>
<p>remember Henneman size principle,</p>
<p>the recruitment of more motor units,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t just muscles, it&rsquo;s nerve to muscle connections.</p>
<p>The better you are at doing that,</p>
<p>the more you will recruit</p>
<p>these so-called high threshold motor units,</p>
<p>the ones that are hard to get to,</p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;ll kick off the cascades of things</p>
<p>within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and strength.</p>
<p>So if you have muscles that are challenging to contract,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take more sets</p>
<p>in order to stimulate the desired effect in those muscles,</p>
<p>not fewer, okay?</p>
<p>If you have muscles that you are very good</p>
<p>at generating force within, it&rsquo;s going to take fewer sets.</p>
<p>Now, how many sets?</p>
<p>You are going to have to determine that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend for those of you</p>
<p>that are using like 50% of your one repetition maximum,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing a lot of repetitions,</p>
<p>you might find that three or four,</p>
<p>five sets will maintain the muscle.</p>
<p>You might decide to do that once at one point in the week</p>
<p>and then do it again, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going for 10 sets a week,</p>
<p>you can divide that among two sessions</p>
<p>or you can do that all in one session.</p>
<p>The data really show it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There are some differences in terms of whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to generate maximum intensity</p>
<p>within a workout or whether or not</p>
<p>you want to spread that out.</p>
<p>But in general, resistance workouts of any kind</p>
<p>tend to be best favored by workouts</p>
<p>that are somewhere between 45 minutes and 60 minutes.</p>
<p>And generally not longer than 60 minutes</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when all the things like cortisol</p>
<p>and some of the inflammatory pathways</p>
<p>really start to create a situation in the muscle</p>
<p>and in the body that&rsquo;s not so great for you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule,</p>
<p>you know, that the ax doesn&rsquo;t drop at 60 minutes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty clear that performing this</p>
<p>five to 15 sets per week,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s in one workout</p>
<p>or whether that&rsquo;s divided up across multiple workouts</p>
<p>is really what&rsquo;s going to be most beneficial.</p>
<p>And please do keep in mind Henneman&rsquo;s size principle</p>
<p>and the recruitment of motor units.</p>
<p>And remember, the better you are</p>
<p>at contracting particular muscles</p>
<p>and in isolating those muscles,</p>
<p>the fewer sets likely you need to do</p>
<p>in order to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>Now, what about people who have been training for a while?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s been doing</p>
<p>weight training for a while,</p>
<p>the data point to the fact that</p>
<p>more volume can be beneficial,</p>
<p>even for muscles that you are very efficient at contracting.</p>
<p>Now, the curve on this, the graph on this</p>
<p>begins again at about five sets per week</p>
<p>for maintaining a given muscle group</p>
<p>and extends all the way out to 25 or 30 sets per week.</p>
<p>However, there are individuals who for whatever reason</p>
<p>can generate so much force,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so good at training muscles</p>
<p>that they can generate so much force</p>
<p>in just four or six or eight sets</p>
<p>that doing this large volume of work</p>
<p>is actually going to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>So everyone needs to figure out for themselves,</p>
<p>first of all, how often you&rsquo;re willing to do</p>
<p>resistance exercise of any kind.</p>
<p>And again, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re using bands</p>
<p>or weights or body weight.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re doing chin-ups,</p>
<p>chances are, unless you are very strong,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not using weights,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just using something that you can hold onto.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re doing push-ups,</p>
<p>some of you will be working in that 30 to 80%</p>
<p>of your one repetition maximum range.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you have to be</p>
<p>moving weights in a gym, for instance.</p>
<p>So the purpose here is to figure out</p>
<p>what muscles you&rsquo;re trying to train.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an issue that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>And then it does appear that somewhere between</p>
<p>five and 15 sets per week is going to be</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s going to work for most people.</p>
<p>Now, this is based on a tremendous amount of work</p>
<p>that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues,</p>
<p>Brad Schoenfield and colleagues and others,</p>
<p>Mike Roberts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge group of people out there</p>
<p>doing exercise physiology and a small subset of them</p>
<p>that are linking them back to real world protocols</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t just pertain to athletes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s mainly what I&rsquo;m focusing on today.</p>
<p>And surely there will be exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, if you are going to divide the sets across the week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do all 10 sets, for instance,</p>
<p>for a given muscle group in one session.</p>
<p>Then of course, it&rsquo;s imperative that the muscles</p>
<p>recover in between sessions.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about recovery</p>
<p>both at the systemic level, the whole nervous system,</p>
<p>and at the local level, the nerve to muscle</p>
<p>and local even muscle level.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in about 10 minutes</p>
<p>when we talk about recovery.</p>
<p>I do want to mention something very important,</p>
<p>which is that everything I&rsquo;m referring to here,</p>
<p>it has to do with full range of motion, okay?</p>
<p>And you might ask, well,</p>
<p>what about the speeds of movements?</p>
<p>This is actually turns out to be</p>
<p>a really interesting data set.</p>
<p>For generating explosiveness and speed,</p>
<p>so for sprinters or throwing sports,</p>
<p>or for people that want to generate a lot of jumping power,</p>
<p>it does appear that learning to move weights</p>
<p>as fast as you safely can,</p>
<p>especially under moderate to heavy loads,</p>
<p>can increase explosiveness and speed.</p>
<p>And most of that effect is from changes in the neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not from changes in the muscle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from changes in the way that the upper motor neurons</p>
<p>communicate with the lower motor neurons</p>
<p>and generating a pathway, a neural circuit, as we call it,</p>
<p>that is very efficient at generating action potentials,</p>
<p>which are the electricity within neurons</p>
<p>to trigger the muscle.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are events that happen</p>
<p>from nerve to muscle,</p>
<p>but the takeaway from that enormous literature, frankly,</p>
<p>is that if you want to get faster,</p>
<p>yes, it can be beneficial to get stronger,</p>
<p>but if you want to dedicate resistance training</p>
<p>specifically to jumping higher, to running faster,</p>
<p>to throwing further, and these sorts of things,</p>
<p>that learning to generate force with increasing speed</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that,</p>
<p>for people that want to get stronger,</p>
<p>it appears that the slowing down of the weight</p>
<p>as things get harder is a key parameter</p>
<p>in recruiting those high threshold motor units.</p>
<p>So let me phrase that a little bit differently.</p>
<p>Think about a set in the gym,</p>
<p>or think about a set of pushups or a set of pull-ups.</p>
<p>Initially, you can move very fast if you like.</p>
<p>If you want to generate hypertrophy,</p>
<p>the goal really is not necessarily to move super slow,</p>
<p>but to isolate the muscle and therefore not to use momentum</p>
<p>rather than lift weights, as they say, challenge muscles.</p>
<p>If you want to get stronger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be distributing that effort</p>
<p>over more muscles and more of your nervous system.</p>
<p>For generating explosiveness and speed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that learning to generate forces quickly</p>
<p>and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads quickly</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial</p>
<p>because of the way that you train the motor neurons.</p>
<p>And of course, changes in the muscle.</p>
<p>But this could look different for different sports.</p>
<p>And obviously you want to make safety paramount.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re injured,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to train at all for sport</p>
<p>or for any purpose that is.</p>
<p>And so what this would involve is something like 60 to 75%</p>
<p>of a one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>And then in a controlled way,</p>
<p>moving that as quickly as one can throughout the entire set</p>
<p>and certainly not going to failure</p>
<p>because as you approach failure,</p>
<p>the inability to move the weight with good form,</p>
<p>the weight inevitably slows down.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a lot of new technologies now</p>
<p>that are focused on informing people</p>
<p>of how quickly the bar or weight is moving.</p>
<p>I saw an advertisement for this the other day.</p>
<p>There are things that people can attach to bars</p>
<p>that will literally speak to you as you&rsquo;re doing a set</p>
<p>and inform you whether or not you&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>four times more slowly per rep</p>
<p>than you were at the beginning</p>
<p>and trying to hone in on the exact speed of movement.</p>
<p>In talking to these experts prior to this episode,</p>
<p>it does appear that for sake of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not moving the muscles so quickly</p>
<p>that you start to distribute the effort</p>
<p>to lots of other muscles, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Because as the set gets harder,</p>
<p>the motor units that you recruit will increase</p>
<p>the number of neurons that you recruit</p>
<p>and the number of muscle fibers</p>
<p>in between these high threshold muscle fibers will increase.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really only for purposes of hypertrophy</p>
<p>that you really need to be concerned</p>
<p>about how quickly the weight is slowing down.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re trying to get faster, more explosive</p>
<p>and generate more speed and jumping power,</p>
<p>throwing power, things of that sort,</p>
<p>you never really want to use a weight</p>
<p>or get to a portion of the set</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re moving the bar very, very slowly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure as I say that,</p>
<p>some of the exercise physiologists</p>
<p>and advanced trainers out there</p>
<p>will come after me with pitchforks, which is fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see the literature that shows</p>
<p>that low gear, slow movements with very heavy weights</p>
<p>can indeed improve explosiveness.</p>
<p>And that may in fact be the case,</p>
<p>but the data that I was able to access was essentially</p>
<p>as I described just a moment ago.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re probably starting to realize,</p>
<p>you need to customize a resistance practice</p>
<p>for your particular needs and goals.</p>
<p>And I certainly am not the first to suggest</p>
<p>that people periodize their training,</p>
<p>that they do things from anywhere from one month</p>
<p>to six months and to see how it goes</p>
<p>and to make modifications as they go.</p>
<p>Because the nervous system,</p>
<p>in particular the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>changes very quickly at the beginning of training.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the changes that one can see</p>
<p>when they first embrace or start resistance training</p>
<p>can be very remarkable, but they tend to slow over time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about a few principles.</p>
<p>The fact that you need to get sufficient volume,</p>
<p>you need at least five sets to maintain</p>
<p>and you probably need about 10 sets per muscle group</p>
<p>in order to improve muscle.</p>
<p>That moving weights of moderate</p>
<p>to moderately heavy weight quickly</p>
<p>is going to be best for explosiveness.</p>
<p>That isolating muscles</p>
<p>and really contracting muscles hard,</p>
<p>something that you can test</p>
<p>by just when you&rsquo;re outside the training session,</p>
<p>seeing whether or not you can cramp the muscle hard</p>
<p>will tell you your capacity to improve hypertrophy</p>
<p>or to engage strength changes in that muscle.</p>
<p>That your ability to contract a muscle hard</p>
<p>is inversely related to the number of sets</p>
<p>that you should do in order to isolate</p>
<p>and stimulate that muscle.</p>
<p>And there are some other things</p>
<p>that can enhance the whole process</p>
<p>of building nerve to muscle connections,</p>
<p>making them more efficient</p>
<p>and generating if you like more strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>One of them I loathe to say,</p>
<p>I was told is in between set contractions.</p>
<p>The other name for this is the people in the gym</p>
<p>does typically seem to be guys in the gym</p>
<p>flexing their muscles in between sets.</p>
<p>And indeed the research supports the fact</p>
<p>that contractions of about 30 seconds</p>
<p>in between the actual work sets,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to favor better performance</p>
<p>on the work sets.</p>
<p>If anything, they&rsquo;re going to compromise them,</p>
<p>but those hard contractions in between sets</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism,</p>
<p>as well as what we talked about before,</p>
<p>which are stress, tension and damage,</p>
<p>they seem to improve stress, tension and damage</p>
<p>and the nerve to muscle contraction</p>
<p>in ways that facilitate hypertrophy.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>you see that person flexing in between sets in the gym,</p>
<p>provided that they&rsquo;re really isolating that muscle</p>
<p>and provided it&rsquo;s one that they ought to be improving.</p>
<p>Not one of these people</p>
<p>that always skips leg day type of people.</p>
<p>These people are highly asymmetric,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s up to them.</p>
<p>That process of flexing in between sets</p>
<p>does seem to improve the nerve to muscle connection</p>
<p>and enhance hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And I say, I was loath to say it</p>
<p>because nowadays with phones,</p>
<p>it seems like the end of every set includes a selfie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of like the 11th rep of every set.</p>
<p>I like to joke.</p>
<p>It seems like very few people are capable</p>
<p>of actually going into the gym</p>
<p>and doing a workout without taking a picture of themselves,</p>
<p>which I think is fine if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>Although I must say that the athletes that I know</p>
<p>and even the recreational athletes that I know</p>
<p>who seem to get the most out of their training</p>
<p>and who also seem to get the most</p>
<p>out of other aspects of their life</p>
<p>seem to be able to control their phone behavior,</p>
<p>both in the gym and outside of the gym.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s more of an editorial point there.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode,</p>
<p>I talked about estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>And during that discussion,</p>
<p>I talked about the use of resistance exercise</p>
<p>specifically for increasing testosterone,</p>
<p>both in men and in women.</p>
<p>And indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise.</p>
<p>And indeed it&rsquo;s mediated by the nerve to muscle connections.</p>
<p>We talked about that in that earlier episode.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly mention that protocol</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s distinctly different</p>
<p>from the other protocols I&rsquo;ve talked about today.</p>
<p>The protocols I&rsquo;ve talked about today thus far</p>
<p>of explosive movements or of hypertrophy based training,</p>
<p>provided the training is 60 minutes or less</p>
<p>will cause increases in serum testosterone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been shown over and over again.</p>
<p>And if the session extends too long past 75 minutes</p>
<p>and is of sufficiently high intensity,</p>
<p>chances are testosterone levels will start to drop</p>
<p>and cortisol levels will go up</p>
<p>in ways that can be detrimental to recovery</p>
<p>and the goals of the training.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s different than training</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>Duncan French, who&rsquo;s one of the directors</p>
<p>of the UFC Performance Center,</p>
<p>when he was a graduate student</p>
<p>at University of Connecticut stores,</p>
<p>did some beautiful work.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues found the ideal training protocols</p>
<p>for stimulating testosterone release,</p>
<p>which is something that many people want to do</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And that involved doing six sets of 10 repetitions,</p>
<p>even if it requires lightening the weight</p>
<p>on one set to the next,</p>
<p>with about two minutes, 120 seconds rest in between sets,</p>
<p>which if you think about it is pretty short rest</p>
<p>and is pretty darn hard work.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very limited threshold</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>That protocol of six sets of 10 repetitions</p>
<p>led to these big increases in serum testosterone.</p>
<p>But if people did 10 sets of 10,</p>
<p>so just four more repetitions per set,</p>
<p>then testosterone did not increase.</p>
<p>In fact, you got more of this catabolic cortisol</p>
<p>like pathway.</p>
<p>You get other benefits from the so-called</p>
<p>10 sets of 10 protocol,</p>
<p>but not the testosterone increase</p>
<p>and maybe even reductions in testosterone.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to point out that</p>
<p>that six sets of 10 was done with big compound movements.</p>
<p>So things like squats or deadlifts or chin-ups</p>
<p>or things of that sort.</p>
<p>And those were done as single sessions,</p>
<p>not in concert with a bunch of other exercise.</p>
<p>Although if athletes are doing that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why they couldn&rsquo;t also do</p>
<p>other types of training elsewhere in the week.</p>
<p>I asked Duncan about this and he mentioned that</p>
<p>that done twice a week is probably the maximum amount</p>
<p>that anyone could do that</p>
<p>and still maintain this increase in testosterone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting protocol</p>
<p>because as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing to me that six sets of 10 repetitions</p>
<p>with something causes a distinctly, excuse me,</p>
<p>causes a distinctly different result</p>
<p>in terms of hormone output</p>
<p>than 10 sets of 10 of the exact same movement.</p>
<p>And it speaks to the exquisite way</p>
<p>in which nerve to muscle connections</p>
<p>dictate the whole physiology of your entire system.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a theme that I really want to bring forward today</p>
<p>is that weight training or resistance training of any kind</p>
<p>is really used for either systemic effects, right?</p>
<p>10% of training done where you&rsquo;re feeling that burn,</p>
<p>which means lactate will be present</p>
<p>and sending signals to your brain</p>
<p>and your heart and to your liver that are beneficial</p>
<p>or isolating muscles,</p>
<p>which may also generate a kind of a lactate</p>
<p>which is associated with the burn result.</p>
<p>But that isolation of muscles is distinctly different.</p>
<p>So systemic versus isolated.</p>
<p>Those are the two general ways</p>
<p>in which resistance training can be applied.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to mention that earlier protocol</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s well-supported by the literature.</p>
<p>If you were to incorporate that protocol,</p>
<p>you might ask,</p>
<p>well, then can you do any other weight training</p>
<p>during the week?</p>
<p>And sure, of course you can provided you&rsquo;re recovering.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about how you know if you&rsquo;re recovering,</p>
<p>how you know if a muscle is recovered</p>
<p>and how you know if your whole system is recovered</p>
<p>because recovery is what dictates</p>
<p>whether or not you can come back</p>
<p>and do more work of a different kind,</p>
<p>meaning you do a leg training one day,</p>
<p>can you and should you come back</p>
<p>and do upper body training the next day?</p>
<p>And it dictates whether or not you&rsquo;ll see any improvement</p>
<p>from session to session at all.</p>
<p>Before I talk about recovery,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I nail down the details</p>
<p>that I was able to extract from the literature</p>
<p>and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how quickly to perform repetitions</p>
<p>for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,</p>
<p>anywhere from a half a second per repetition</p>
<p>all the way up to eight seconds per repetition,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re thinking about explosiveness</p>
<p>or building speed,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re specifically using resistance training</p>
<p>to build endurance, that&rsquo;s a separate matter.</p>
<p>We talked about explosiveness and speed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about endurance in a few moments.</p>
<p>We also talked about in-between set contractions,</p>
<p>so-called selfie effect of people flexing</p>
<p>a particular muscle,</p>
<p>isolating a particular muscle between sets.</p>
<p>Just want to mention that would be a terrible thing to do</p>
<p>if your goal is performance on sets.</p>
<p>So moving a particular amount of weight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually going to diminish the amount of weight</p>
<p>that you can move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to enhance muscle growth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to enhance the nerve to muscle isolation</p>
<p>of that particular pathway.</p>
<p>So again, that flexing between sets</p>
<p>is going to favor hypertrophy, not performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to get stronger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to move more weights,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to distribute work,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to do maybe skill training</p>
<p>with resistance,</p>
<p>then flexing between sets is absolutely the wrong thing</p>
<p>to do for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fatiguing the muscle further.</p>
<p>Just remaining still or walking around a little bit</p>
<p>has been shown to be beneficial</p>
<p>in terms of moving some of the lactate out of the muscle,</p>
<p>as well as just recovering between sets.</p>
<p>Now, how long to recover between sets?</p>
<p>This is a question for the testosterone protocol.</p>
<p>Duncan French and colleagues found</p>
<p>that it was about two minutes,</p>
<p>keeping that really on the clock, two minutes, not longer.</p>
<p>For hypertrophy and for strength gains,</p>
<p>it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes</p>
<p>or even three or four, even five or six minutes</p>
<p>can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in expanding the volume of work</p>
<p>that you can do in a given session,</p>
<p>at high capacity, at high intensity with a given weight,</p>
<p>please see the episode that I did on cold and performance</p>
<p>about supercharging performance,</p>
<p>which is based on the work of my colleague, Craig Heller,</p>
<p>in the biology department at Stanford,</p>
<p>which talks about palmar cooling,</p>
<p>about how you can cool the core of the body</p>
<p>best through the palms,</p>
<p>using these particular venous portals</p>
<p>that are only present in your hands.</p>
<p>People are now doing this with ice packs or with gel packs.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways one can do this.</p>
<p>I talk all about that in that episode.</p>
<p>It allows you to do more repetitions</p>
<p>and more work at a given weight over time.</p>
<p>So rather than getting 10 repetitions</p>
<p>and then eight and then seven and then six,</p>
<p>through proper use of palmar cooling,</p>
<p>one can do 10, 10, 10, 10, and even add sets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one way that one can accomplish</p>
<p>higher volume work</p>
<p>without having to drop the weight considerably.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you can hit that really sweet spot,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal, of getting strong</p>
<p>and generating some hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Because as soon as you have to drop to lighter weights,</p>
<p>excuse me,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re shifting more towards hypertrophy and endurance</p>
<p>and less toward strength in a given muscle.</p>
<p>So check out that episode.</p>
<p>The last thing besides between set contractions</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re distributing work</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re really trying to isolate muscles</p>
<p>is this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown over and over again that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you want to generate force in a given muscle</p>
<p>and really isolate that,</p>
<p>doing the isolation work before a compound movement.</p>
<p>So this would be, you know, leg extensions,</p>
<p>the thing where you sit</p>
<p>and you extend your toes up toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>Leg extensions before squats will allow the squats</p>
<p>to target that muscle group more effectively.</p>
<p>And that makes perfectly good sense</p>
<p>based on the Henneman size principle</p>
<p>and fatiguing motor units.</p>
<p>It should be obvious why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>But of course, that&rsquo;s going to be anti-performance</p>
<p>in terms of how much weight you can lift</p>
<p>and maybe even the form that you can maintain</p>
<p>when you move to the bigger compound movement.</p>
<p>So you really have to ask yourself a number of questions.</p>
<p>How good are you at isolating a given muscle?</p>
<p>Therefore, how many sets do you want to do?</p>
<p>How often are you willing to train?</p>
<p>Therefore, how many sets are you going to do</p>
<p>in a given session</p>
<p>versus how many are you going to distribute across the week?</p>
<p>Are you aiming for performance?</p>
<p>Are you going to distribute that work</p>
<p>across the nervous system and musculature?</p>
<p>Are you trying to move weights</p>
<p>or are you trying to challenge muscles?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to challenge muscles,</p>
<p>then you really want to focus on things</p>
<p>like this pre-exhausting,</p>
<p>the isolation of a muscle before the compound movement.</p>
<p>Your performance on compound movements</p>
<p>will absolutely suffer,</p>
<p>but your ability to isolate that muscle</p>
<p>and generate hypertrophy through the accumulation</p>
<p>of larger myosin, those bigger balloons, will benefit.</p>
<p>And once again, if you&rsquo;re trying to get faster,</p>
<p>then the speed of the movement really matters.</p>
<p>So how do we know if we&rsquo;ve recovered?</p>
<p>How can we test recovery?</p>
<p>And this is not just recovery from resistance training.</p>
<p>This is recovery from running, recovery from swimming.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about resistance training</p>
<p>more or less in a vacuum.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even touched on the fact</p>
<p>that many people are running</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing resistance training,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re swimming and they&rsquo;re doing resistance training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simply the case that if a given muscle is fatigued,</p>
<p>you can just work other muscles</p>
<p>because even if you&rsquo;ve beautifully isolated a muscle,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have incredible abilities</p>
<p>to isolate just your quadriceps, for instance,</p>
<p>and you do a workout where you isolate your quadriceps,</p>
<p>you do your six sets of intense work,</p>
<p>or maybe use Palmer cooling,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to do 12 sets of intense work,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re done, and that muscle group,</p>
<p>the next day is certainly not going to be recovered</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s extraordinary at recovery</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re enhancing your recovery through chemical means,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about at the end.</p>
<p>Well, you can assess systemic recovery,</p>
<p>meaning your nervous system</p>
<p>and your nervous system&rsquo;s ability to generate force</p>
<p>both distributed and isolated through three main tests.</p>
<p>And fortunately, these tests are very simple,</p>
<p>and two of them are essentially zero cost,</p>
<p>require no equipment.</p>
<p>HRV, heart rate variability, has made its way finally</p>
<p>into the forefront of exercise physiology</p>
<p>and even into the popular discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about HRV before,</p>
<p>how when we exhale, our heart rate slows down</p>
<p>because of the way that our diaphragm is connected</p>
<p>to our heart and to our brain</p>
<p>and the way our brain is connected to our heart.</p>
<p>Excuse me, when we inhale, our heart rate speeds up,</p>
<p>and that is the basis of heart rate variability.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is good.</p>
<p>It means that you&rsquo;re breathing properly.</p>
<p>And when I say it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>it means you want a lot of heart rate variability.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a heart rate</p>
<p>that is high or low consistently over time.</p>
<p>That might come as a bit of a surprise</p>
<p>for you endurance athletes</p>
<p>who probably are trying to accomplish</p>
<p>your endurance work at a steady cadence</p>
<p>and really hit that nice sweet spot</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re breathing rhythmically,</p>
<p>your heart rate&rsquo;s going rhythmically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that steady heart rate,</p>
<p>and then away from exercise,</p>
<p>you have a nice low heart rate, as they say.</p>
<p>Well, nice low heart rate isn&rsquo;t necessarily always so nice.</p>
<p>Turns out that introducing bouts</p>
<p>of increasing your heart rate during exercise,</p>
<p>and even through your waking day,</p>
<p>through stressful events even,</p>
<p>is provided their brief, is beneficial.</p>
<p>A good nerve to heart system</p>
<p>benefits from being able to increase heart rate</p>
<p>and decrease heart rate.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is good.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want high heart rate,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want low heart rate all the time.</p>
<p>But heart rate variability is difficult</p>
<p>for a lot of people to measure.</p>
<p>There are some devices that will allow you to do that,</p>
<p>various watches and devices.</p>
<p>There are more devices becoming available all the time.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon, some that are integrated with your phone</p>
<p>that involve no contact or anything on your body.</p>
<p>But those do carry some costs,</p>
<p>and they are not perfect yet.</p>
<p>The measures of heart rate variability</p>
<p>that one can use while in movement</p>
<p>are still in the phase, I would say,</p>
<p>of technology development where everyone isn&rsquo;t using them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave it at that.</p>
<p>There are two measures, however,</p>
<p>whether or not you recovered,</p>
<p>that you can use first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when you wake up, maybe after five, 10 minutes, if you like,</p>
<p>but ideally right when you wake up</p>
<p>in order to assess how well recovered you are,</p>
<p>and therefore whether or not you should train</p>
<p>your whole system at all that day.</p>
<p>The first one is grip strength.</p>
<p>Grip strength, the ability to generate force</p>
<p>at the level of squeezing the fist</p>
<p>or squeezing down on something</p>
<p>might seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not because it relates to your ability</p>
<p>to use your upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>to control your lower motor neurons,</p>
<p>and to generate isolated force.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re assessing when you do that.</p>
<p>Some people will use one of these grip tools,</p>
<p>or Costello has this toy that&rsquo;s shaped like a donut,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this hard rubber, and I&rsquo;ve tried this before.</p>
<p>You know, if I&rsquo;ve been working really hard,</p>
<p>not sleeping very well, or I&rsquo;ve been training a lot,</p>
<p>any one or combination of those things, my grip suffers.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t actually squeeze that thing down</p>
<p>as much as I can Costello,</p>
<p>because he was born with a, you know, like a 24-inch neck,</p>
<p>and even though he&rsquo;s never touched a weight,</p>
<p>somehow he can just clamp down on that thing,</p>
<p>and it just, you know, he can turn it</p>
<p>into a pancake with ease,</p>
<p>and he likes to chuckle while I struggle with this thing.</p>
<p>But on a good day, I can squeeze this thing</p>
<p>so that I eliminate the hole in the donut, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can also take a floor weight, and excuse me,</p>
<p>a floor scale, and squeeze the scale,</p>
<p>and see how much force you can generate.</p>
<p>I would do that as a baseline to establish</p>
<p>what you can do when you&rsquo;re well-rested.</p>
<p>And then if you do that in the morning,</p>
<p>you can see whether or not you&rsquo;re able to generate</p>
<p>the same amount of force,</p>
<p>or you could use the rubber donut or something.</p>
<p>A lot of this is very subjective.</p>
<p>With the scale, you&rsquo;re really trying to assess</p>
<p>whether or not you can generate the same amount of force.</p>
<p>If you start seeing a 10% or 20%,</p>
<p>certainly reduction in that, that&rsquo;s concerning.</p>
<p>It means that your system,</p>
<p>that your nervous system as a whole,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily fatigued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the pathways from nerve to muscle</p>
<p>are still in the process of rewiring themselves</p>
<p>in order to generate force.</p>
<p>And you might think, well, I trained one muscle group one day.</p>
<p>Why am I having a hard time doing this</p>
<p>for a completely different muscle group?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the upper motor neuron</p>
<p>to lower motor neuron pathway generally</p>
<p>that allows you to use something like grip strength</p>
<p>as a kind of a thermometer, if you will,</p>
<p>of your ability to recover.</p>
<p>So look for your ability to generate force in grip</p>
<p>when you first wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be as good as it is at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>after a cup of coffee and a couple meals,</p>
<p>but the point isn&rsquo;t performance overall.</p>
<p>The point is to assess whether or not you&rsquo;re getting better,</p>
<p>worse, or the same from day to day.</p>
<p>The other one that&rsquo;s really terrific,</p>
<p>and the Andy Galpin&rsquo;s group is using,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m delighted about this</p>
<p>because it relates to something</p>
<p>that my lab is very excited about as well,</p>
<p>is carbon dioxide tolerance.</p>
<p>So this is a really interesting tool</p>
<p>that endurance athletes, strength athletes,</p>
<p>I think can all benefit from.</p>
<p>In fact, athletes and people of all kinds,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not an athlete,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not exercising at all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good question of whether or not</p>
<p>your system as a whole is doing okay or not.</p>
<p>You know, we rely on the thermometer.</p>
<p>Do we have a fever or not?</p>
<p>We rely on subjective things.</p>
<p>You know, do I feel good or not?</p>
<p>Am I digesting well or not?</p>
<p>Those are all subjective.</p>
<p>The carbon dioxide tolerance test is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s objective in that it measures your capacity</p>
<p>to engage the so-called parasympathetic arm</p>
<p>of your nervous system,</p>
<p>which is the calming aspect of your nervous system,</p>
<p>and it measures your ability to consciously control</p>
<p>a particular skeletal muscle, which is your diaphragm.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>If you have to use the restroom first, do that,</p>
<p>but try and stay away from your phone.</p>
<p>Try and, if you have your phone, put it on airplane mode,</p>
<p>go to the timer or use a hand watch</p>
<p>or some other way of measuring time.</p>
<p>Stay off social media for just a few seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re going to do is you&rsquo;re going to inhale</p>
<p>through your nose as deeply as you can.</p>
<p>You can do this lying down, you know, sitting, whatever.</p>
<p>Inhale through your nose and then exhale all the way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to repeat that four times, okay?</p>
<p>So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>Exhale, inhale, exhale, four times.</p>
<p>And ideally you&rsquo;re inhaling through the nose</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re exhaling through the mouth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning</p>
<p>of this carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>Then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can</p>
<p>through your nose, fill your lungs as much as you can.</p>
<p>And if you can try and expand your,</p>
<p>make your stomach go out while you do that,</p>
<p>that means that your diaphragm is really engaged.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re inhaling as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Then hit the timer.</p>
<p>And your goal is to release that air</p>
<p>as slowly as possible through your mouth.</p>
<p>So it looks like you have a tiny, tiny little straw</p>
<p>in your mouth and you&rsquo;re letting it go</p>
<p>as slowly as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Measure what we call the carbon dioxide blow-off time</p>
<p>or discard rate.</p>
<p>I know you can all sit with lungs empty</p>
<p>after you eliminate all that air,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t lie to yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop the timer when you&rsquo;ve been sitting</p>
<p>with your lungs empty for a while.</p>
<p>Stop the timer when you are finally no longer able</p>
<p>to exhale any more air.</p>
<p>Okay, so four.</p>
<p>So you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly.</p>
<p>I just said it quickly for sake of time.</p>
<p>Then you do this fifth big inhale through your mouth</p>
<p>and then,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to do it for the full duration.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re measuring that time.</p>
<p>Your carbon dioxide discard rate will be somewhere</p>
<p>between one second and presumably two minutes.</p>
<p>Two minutes would be a heroic carbon dioxide discard time.</p>
<p>30 seconds would be more typical.</p>
<p>20 seconds would be fast.</p>
<p>If your carbon dioxide discard time is 20</p>
<p>or 25 seconds or less,</p>
<p>you are not necessarily recovered</p>
<p>from your previous day&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s ways to push through this,</p>
<p>but hold onto that thought for a moment.</p>
<p>If your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere</p>
<p>between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,</p>
<p>you are in what we would call kind of the green zone</p>
<p>where you are in a position to do more physical work.</p>
<p>And if your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere</p>
<p>between 65 and 120 seconds,</p>
<p>well then you have almost certainly</p>
<p>recovered your nervous system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the individual muscles,</p>
<p>but your nervous system is prepared to do more work.</p>
<p>And Andy&rsquo;s lab has great data on this</p>
<p>as it relates to exercise physiology.</p>
<p>I think that story should be out</p>
<p>in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>My lab has been using carbon dioxide discard time</p>
<p>to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety.</p>
<p>So two totally independent projects,</p>
<p>but using the same measure.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got HRV, which requires some technology usually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got grip strength,</p>
<p>which you can assess subjectively</p>
<p>or you can use a floor scale.</p>
<p>And now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.</p>
<p>You want to do this in the morning when you wake up</p>
<p>and keep track, just write down in a little book</p>
<p>or maybe just keep track in your mind</p>
<p>of your carbon dioxide discard time.</p>
<p>If you find that your discard times are dropping,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re in the 40 second range or 50 second range,</p>
<p>but normally you can do 75 seconds or 120 seconds.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re starting to drop by anywhere from 15 to 20%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re veering in the direction of not recovering.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really keen on this tool</p>
<p>because everybody has different recovery abilities.</p>
<p>Some people are eating really well</p>
<p>and sleeping really well.</p>
<p>Some people have minimal stress</p>
<p>or can buffer stress really well.</p>
<p>Other people, they dissolve into a puddle of tears</p>
<p>if they read one text message that&rsquo;s troubling or whatever.</p>
<p>And I realize, and I say that with sympathy,</p>
<p>I realize people have varying levels of stress</p>
<p>and demand in their life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just impossible to prescribe an entire protocol</p>
<p>that says, okay, yes, you should train today.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what you should do.</p>
<p>No, you shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Use carbon dioxide discard rate</p>
<p>because A, it&rsquo;s valuable, it&rsquo;s informative.</p>
<p>B, it&rsquo;s zero cost.</p>
<p>And C, it&rsquo;s something that you can track objectively</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the key.</p>
<p>And I just should, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that what carbon dioxide discard rate is tapping into</p>
<p>is your ability to mechanically control your diaphragm.</p>
<p>Certainly that&rsquo;s one aspect of it,</p>
<p>but that relates in a very direct way</p>
<p>to your ability to put the brake on your stress system,</p>
<p>to engage the so-called parasympathetic</p>
<p>or calming arm of your autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>And another thing that Andy Galpin&rsquo;s group is testing</p>
<p>is at the offset of training after your run,</p>
<p>after your weight training session,</p>
<p>maybe even after your plyometrics session,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t really talk about jumping and throwing</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about it in a future episode,</p>
<p>but they and other groups, including some elite athletes</p>
<p>and other groups that are very interested</p>
<p>in physical performance are using a tool</p>
<p>where they deliberately disengage for five minutes</p>
<p>at the end of training.</p>
<p>They deliberately engage this calming</p>
<p>or parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And you can do that through any number of different tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of respiration tools</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always available to you.</p>
<p>Your breathing is always there.</p>
<p>I talk about some of these tools in previous episodes,</p>
<p>but you could use things like non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>NSDR at the end of a training session.</p>
<p>You could do 10 physiological size,</p>
<p>double inhales through the nose, followed by long exhales.</p>
<p>That will definitely engage</p>
<p>the parasympathetic nervous system at the end of training.</p>
<p>So rather than finish your training session</p>
<p>and then just hop onto your phone,</p>
<p>serious athletes and people who are serious about recovery</p>
<p>initiate that recovery at the very end of their training.</p>
<p>And they start to kickstart that recovery process rather,</p>
<p>and they measure CO2 tolerance in the morning.</p>
<p>So there are several groups that are doing that.</p>
<p>In fact, I know several groups because I&rsquo;m working with them</p>
<p>that are using physiological size between sets</p>
<p>in order to recover their nervous system</p>
<p>and maintain nerve to muscle contractibility,</p>
<p>maintain focus throughout their training session,</p>
<p>enhance their focus by doing a few physiological size.</p>
<p>So double inhale, exhale in between sets.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re getting very focused and very intense</p>
<p>about their strength work or explosiveness work</p>
<p>or muscle isolation work during their sets.</p>
<p>And then in between sets,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re deliberately disengaging the nervous system</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re re-engaging it again.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to emphasize that.</p>
<p>So recovery is a complex process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of things,</p>
<p>but the CO2 tolerance test should be a valuable tool.</p>
<p>Now, another tool for recovery</p>
<p>that people are very excited about</p>
<p>is the use of cold and the ice bath.</p>
<p>And this is important.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who uses cold through cold shower</p>
<p>or ice bath or jumping in a lake or a river,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you use to generate cold</p>
<p>as a recovery tool,</p>
<p>you should be aware that there are data starting to emerge</p>
<p>that if your goal is recovery or strength improvements,</p>
<p>using cold within the four hours following a workout,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about Palmer cooling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about whole body cooling</p>
<p>or cooling from the neck down.</p>
<p>Yes, it will reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Yes, it will reduce the amount</p>
<p>of delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>One readout of how intense or damaging a given workout was,</p>
<p>not the only readout.</p>
<p>But it does seem to interfere</p>
<p>with some of the things like mTOR pathways,</p>
<p>the mammalian targeted rapamycin pathway</p>
<p>and other pathways related to inflammation</p>
<p>that promote muscle repair, remember, and muscle growth.</p>
<p>Remember, stress, tension, and damage</p>
<p>are the stimulus for nerve to muscle connections to change</p>
<p>and for muscles to get bigger, stronger, and better.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re getting into the ice bath after training</p>
<p>or taking a really cold shower</p>
<p>after doing resistance training,</p>
<p>you are likely short-circuiting the improvements</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to create.</p>
<p>Now, athletes who are trying to recover quickly</p>
<p>so that they can get back into more training sessions,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t really want</p>
<p>to gain much strength or hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re mainly focused on endurance</p>
<p>and you want to do more endurance work</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been weight training,</p>
<p>well, then exposing yourself to cold can be beneficial,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to get as great of benefits</p>
<p>from the resistance training.</p>
<p>In other words, cold after resistance training</p>
<p>seems to short-circuit some of the benefits</p>
<p>of that resistance training.</p>
<p>There are some other things that can short-circuit</p>
<p>the benefits of resistance training as well.</p>
<p>One of those is antihistamines.</p>
<p>Some interesting data were published recently,</p>
<p>I believe it was in scientific reports, yes,</p>
<p>that showed that antihistamines can prevent</p>
<p>some of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>of endurance-type work, so running, swimming,</p>
<p>fairly long duration, or even sprint-type work,</p>
<p>as well as inhibit some of the processes</p>
<p>associated with resistance training.</p>
<p>Remember, resistance training or endurance training,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a stimulus for stress,</p>
<p>and the adaptation to that stress is how you get better,</p>
<p>that you can run further, faster, lift more weight,</p>
<p>hypertrophy the muscle, et cetera.</p>
<p>So antihistamines can be a problem.</p>
<p>Obviously, don&rsquo;t compromise your ability</p>
<p>to breathe completely, but antihistamines</p>
<p>generally work by blocking what are called mast cells, M-A-S-T.</p>
<p>Mast cells are really interesting cells</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in our month on neuroimmune function.</p>
<p>They travel in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re these little packets</p>
<p>that burst open at sites of inflammation.</p>
<p>Muscle damage and inflammation is a signal</p>
<p>that something needs to change,</p>
<p>and so taking antihistamines, it appears,</p>
<p>can disrupt some of that inflammatory process.</p>
<p>So you actually want inflammation</p>
<p>during and immediately after a workout,</p>
<p>then you want to bring inflammation down later,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll mention how to do that.</p>
<p>The other thing are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>You know their trade names.</p>
<p>These are painkillers that many people take.</p>
<p>Those, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in a previous episode,</p>
<p>can interfere with the benefits of endurance training</p>
<p>and the benefits of resistance training.</p>
<p>In addition to that, they block pain signals,</p>
<p>and pain is a very good signal</p>
<p>that you might be doing something wrong,</p>
<p>and so while nobody likes to be in pain,</p>
<p>I suppose there are probably a few people out there</p>
<p>that like to be in pain, but that&rsquo;s a different story,</p>
<p>but nobody likes to be in pain,</p>
<p>the non-steroid anti-inflammatories, the NSAIDs,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called, and the antihistamines</p>
<p>seem to prevent a lot of the gains,</p>
<p>the improvements in endurance strength and size</p>
<p>that people are specifically using exercise for.</p>
<p>So be cautious about your use</p>
<p>of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,</p>
<p>especially within the four hours preceding</p>
<p>or the four hours following exercise.</p>
<p>So I hope you&rsquo;re starting to get the picture.</p>
<p>In order to change the nerve to muscle connectivity</p>
<p>in ways that will better serve you,</p>
<p>you need a stressor during the actual training.</p>
<p>Which particular stressor depends on your training goals,</p>
<p>but that stressor is almost always going to be associated</p>
<p>with inflammation, and then after the training,</p>
<p>you want to try and get into a state of reduced inflammation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you would do some sort of protocol,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest, which we will link to in our caption,</p>
<p>or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about before, reveree, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great app for accessing deep rest states</p>
<p>or the physiological side to try and get the system,</p>
<p>your system to calm down after training.</p>
<p>There are also tools that one can use to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>at a kind of foundational level away from training.</p>
<p>And these are tools that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>many times before, but I&rsquo;ll just restate them again.</p>
<p>The kind of golden three, according to Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>and the ones that he recommends are sufficient omega-3s.</p>
<p>Again, that can be accomplished through diet,</p>
<p>through whole food intake, or through supplementation,</p>
<p>or both, so in general, getting above 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>of EPA per day to keep inflammation low or relatively low.</p>
<p>Vitamin D, and in some cases, magnesium malate.</p>
<p>Magnesium malate seems to be particularly effective</p>
<p>in offsetting delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>Soreness itself is not required</p>
<p>for improvements in strength,</p>
<p>improvements in explosiveness, improvements in hypertrophy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>Now, if you do experience delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well,</p>
<p>or even maybe too well.</p>
<p>Maybe you stressed it too much and you need longer recovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a total debate out there</p>
<p>about whether or not you should train again</p>
<p>when a muscle is still sore.</p>
<p>I think the general takeaway is no,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s not recovered.</p>
<p>And there are things, of course, like massage,</p>
<p>like fascial release, and things of that sort,</p>
<p>sauna, cold, that can perhaps accelerate</p>
<p>the movement from soreness to not sore.</p>
<p>But in general, the omega-3, vitamin D,</p>
<p>and magnesium malate trio seem to be an effective way</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation at kind of a systemic level.</p>
<p>But remember, you want inflammation</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not damaging the muscle so much</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re injured during the training session</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the stimulus for change in those muscles.</p>
<p>I want to talk about a few other things</p>
<p>that support the process of nerve to muscle communication</p>
<p>and touch on some of the things</p>
<p>that a lot of people are doing</p>
<p>to try and quote-unquote enhance their workouts</p>
<p>and evaluate whether or not those are, in fact,</p>
<p>enhancing workouts or not.</p>
<p>Because weight training,</p>
<p>unlike a lot of other forms of exercise,</p>
<p>has a unique aspect to it,</p>
<p>which is this feature that I guess</p>
<p>some people call it the pump,</p>
<p>which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle</p>
<p>when you train.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only kind of training</p>
<p>where you actually get a window</p>
<p>into what the result might actually look like</p>
<p>before you actually accomplish that result.</p>
<p>So if you think about when you go out for a hard run</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you go out for a two-mile run,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say your goal is to break,</p>
<p>you want to do a sub-10 two-mile.</p>
<p>Actually, when I went to university,</p>
<p>I was running cross-country my senior year of high school</p>
<p>and I wanted to walk on for the cross-country team.</p>
<p>And so I went out there</p>
<p>and it turned out you had to do a sub-10 two-mile.</p>
<p>And I think the best mile I ever ran in high school</p>
<p>was a 457, which isn&rsquo;t terrible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even close to what high school athletes,</p>
<p>the best high school athletes can do now.</p>
<p>But that would have meant doing it back-to-back.</p>
<p>So a sub-10 minute two-mile didn&rsquo;t even come close.</p>
<p>I told Costello this story the other day</p>
<p>and he just kind of laughed at me.</p>
<p>He was like, why would you even want to run two miles?</p>
<p>Because Costello is built almost exclusively</p>
<p>of these type two fast twitch muscles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re designed for moving objects.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incredibly strong.</p>
<p>He has been since he was a puppy.</p>
<p>I mean, that dog could probably drag a tractor</p>
<p>if he wanted to, but he can&rsquo;t really go far.</p>
<p>Whereas a greyhound or a whippet</p>
<p>or some of these other sight hounds or scent hounds</p>
<p>can go, go, go.</p>
<p>They have a higher percentage</p>
<p>of the so-called slow twitch muscle fibers.</p>
<p>They are much better at endurance.</p>
<p>So a sub-10 two-mile would have been very, very challenging.</p>
<p>No chance I could have done that, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>even with a lot of training.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say that you want to improve your performance</p>
<p>in a given type of exercise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some of the things</p>
<p>that seem to work across the board</p>
<p>to improve strength, improve hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and improve nerve to muscle communication and performance.</p>
<p>The first thing that&rsquo;s absolutely key</p>
<p>for nerve to muscle communication</p>
<p>and physical performance of any kind</p>
<p>might not sound that exciting to you,</p>
<p>but it is very exciting, and that&rsquo;s salt.</p>
<p>Nerves, nerve cells, neurons, communicate with each other</p>
<p>and communicate with muscle by electricity.</p>
<p>But that electricity is generated by particular ions</p>
<p>moving into and out of the neuron.</p>
<p>And the rushing in of a particular ion, sodium, salt,</p>
<p>is what allows nerve cells to fire.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough salt in your system,</p>
<p>your neurons and your brain</p>
<p>and your nerve to muscle communication will be terrible.</p>
<p>If you have sufficient salt, it will be excellent.</p>
<p>How much salt will depend on how much water you&rsquo;re drinking,</p>
<p>how much caffeine you&rsquo;re drinking,</p>
<p>and how much food you&rsquo;re ingesting.</p>
<p>So, and whether or not you&rsquo;re taking any diuretics,</p>
<p>how hot it is, et cetera, how much you&rsquo;re sweating.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure that you have enough salt,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium in your system</p>
<p>if you want to perform well.</p>
<p>I realize that salt isn&rsquo;t a very glamorous performance tool,</p>
<p>but it is vital.</p>
<p>It is absolutely vital.</p>
<p>And the endurance athletes</p>
<p>and the people that train in high heat</p>
<p>can speak to the fact that when your electrolytes are low,</p>
<p>your brain doesn&rsquo;t function,</p>
<p>your body doesn&rsquo;t function nearly as well.</p>
<p>In fact, even for mental work,</p>
<p>for studying and for writing and for doing math and coding,</p>
<p>doing analytic work of any kind,</p>
<p>even a hard conversation that&rsquo;s important to you,</p>
<p>having sufficient electrolytes is really going to help</p>
<p>and being low on electrolytes won&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>And just drinking water won&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>because you need electrolytes.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s been shown over and over again,</p>
<p>in numerous well-controlled studies</p>
<p>to improve muscle performance is creatine.</p>
<p>Early on, there was a lot of controversy about creatine,</p>
<p>but there are many studies.</p>
<p>If you want, you can go to this website</p>
<p>that everyone now knows I love,</p>
<p>which is this free website, examine.com,</p>
<p>that there are no fewer than 18 studies there, 66 studies.</p>
<p>So 18 studies supporting that muscle creatine content</p>
<p>can be increased by ingesting creatine.</p>
<p>How much creatine?</p>
<p>Well, I asked the experts,</p>
<p>and they tell me that for somebody who&rsquo;s about 180 pounds,</p>
<p>five grams a day should be sufficient or so.</p>
<p>Heavier than 180, so if you get like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a 220 pound or 230 pound person,</p>
<p>10 to 15 grams of creatine.</p>
<p>People lighter than 180 pounds,</p>
<p>maybe three to five grams of protein, excuse me, creatine,</p>
<p>or even one to three grams.</p>
<p>Creatine is a fuel source for early inbouts of activity,</p>
<p>for high intensity activity.</p>
<p>It is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain,</p>
<p>and it can have some cognitive enhancing effects.</p>
<p>So creatine is a very interesting molecule.</p>
<p>Early on, when it was released as a supplement,</p>
<p>it was thought that you had to load it</p>
<p>in higher dosages for a few days</p>
<p>and then maintain it at lower dosages.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d take 20 or 30 grams a day,</p>
<p>then back off to five or 10.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case</p>
<p>that you can get all the benefits</p>
<p>from taking the dosages at the low level.</p>
<p>I just mentioned a few moments ago</p>
<p>as they relate to body weight throughout.</p>
<p>So salt and electrolytes, absolutely key.</p>
<p>You need those present.</p>
<p>You need to be well hydrated.</p>
<p>Creatine seems to have a performance enhancing effect.</p>
<p>There are 66 studies, 66,</p>
<p>showing that power output is greatly increased,</p>
<p>anywhere from 12 to 20%.</p>
<p>And this is sprinting and running and jumping</p>
<p>as well as weightlifting by creatine.</p>
<p>The ability to hydrate your body is improved by creatine</p>
<p>because of the way that it brings more water</p>
<p>into cells of various kinds.</p>
<p>As an indirect effect, it can help increase lean mass</p>
<p>because of the way that it brings more water into muscle</p>
<p>and probably also because of the way</p>
<p>that if you get stronger,</p>
<p>you can generate more force and generate more hypertrophy.</p>
<p>It reduces fatigue.</p>
<p>Seven studies have shown that it reduces fatigue.</p>
<p>There are even some interesting effects</p>
<p>on improving cognition after traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a serious medical condition in situations,</p>
<p>you absolutely should talk to a board certified physician</p>
<p>before adding anything</p>
<p>or taking anything out of your current regimen.</p>
<p>There are a few other effects</p>
<p>that are interesting and notable,</p>
<p>but the big ones are the ones that I referred to before</p>
<p>about increased power output, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I just want to emphasize</p>
<p>that creatine can increase this hormone</p>
<p>that we talked about in the testosterone episode,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>which is testosterone converted by 5-alpha reductase</p>
<p>into dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the more dominant androgen in humans,</p>
<p>leads to increases in strength and libido and so forth.</p>
<p>It also can increase male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>Some people, not everybody,</p>
<p>experience some hair loss with creatine.</p>
<p>Other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some people experience accelerated beard growth</p>
<p>because basically DHT has the opposite effect</p>
<p>on hair follicles on the face as it does on the scalp.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Women who ingest creatine,</p>
<p>there are essentially no data showing</p>
<p>that it increases hair loss or facial hair growth,</p>
<p>but of course, everyone is different.</p>
<p>So you can go to examine.com.</p>
<p>You can explore those studies.</p>
<p>So creatine, definitely a powerful</p>
<p>performance enhancing molecule.</p>
<p>The other one, one that personally I&rsquo;ve never tried,</p>
<p>but that seems to have a very strong</p>
<p>and well-supported effects is beta-alanine.</p>
<p>Now, beta-alanine is interesting</p>
<p>because when you hear about weight training,</p>
<p>you think about heavy deadlifts and bench presses,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff that people are doing.</p>
<p>But beta-alanine seems to support exercise</p>
<p>that is of slightly longer duration.</p>
<p>So a mix of anaerobic and aerobic type movements.</p>
<p>So things, these are physical performance</p>
<p>in the 60 to 240 second range.</p>
<p>So you can use your mind and kind of figure out,</p>
<p>you know, like things that weights of the,</p>
<p>that limit you to eight to 15 repetitions.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular exercise of the sort</p>
<p>like rowing or sprinting.</p>
<p>So interval work, it seems to help with that kind of work.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about long runs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about heavy deadlifts.</p>
<p>The standard dose is somewhere between two and five grams.</p>
<p>Again, as always, check with a doctor,</p>
<p>make sure these things are safe for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for your health.</p>
<p>You are, I don&rsquo;t say that just to protect me.</p>
<p>I would say that also to protect you.</p>
<p>But it really seems to improve muscular endurance,</p>
<p>improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.</p>
<p>There are even some interesting effects</p>
<p>on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass.</p>
<p>So creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes.</p>
<p>These are kind of the core three things</p>
<p>that seem to improve performance</p>
<p>and are well supported by the scientific literature.</p>
<p>And in the earlier episode on supercharging performance,</p>
<p>we talked about Palmer cooling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a performance enhancing tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing you ingest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re cooling your palms in a very specific way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<p>Now, what about for longer duration bouts of exercise?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mainly been focusing on resistance training,</p>
<p>but what about for long runs, long swims,</p>
<p>these kinds of things?</p>
<p>Well, it does seem that beet juice</p>
<p>and ingesting things like arginine and citrulline</p>
<p>can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mainly going to be due to effects</p>
<p>of those compounds on vasodilation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to open up the vasculature</p>
<p>and allow more blood flow.</p>
<p>Do note that things like citrulline and arginine</p>
<p>can have some side effects, if you will.</p>
<p>They can increase the likelihood</p>
<p>of having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth.</p>
<p>The arginine is in the pathway by which,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people know this,</p>
<p>but the herpes virus lives on neurons</p>
<p>of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the lips</p>
<p>and the eyes and the mucous membranes of the face.</p>
<p>So this is the herpes type one simplex virus.</p>
<p>The virus lives on those neurons</p>
<p>and then periodically inflames those neurons,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what leads to the cold sore.</p>
<p>It seems like arginine and citrulline</p>
<p>can lead to increases in cold sores</p>
<p>and canker sores and outbreaks of those kinds.</p>
<p>So you want to be aware of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not everybody, and not everybody is carrying HSV-1.</p>
<p>Just be aware that I think it&rsquo;s now 80 or 90% of people,</p>
<p>by time they&rsquo;re 12 years old, they&rsquo;ve contracted HSV-1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very contagious.</p>
<p>And typically people will get one outbreak</p>
<p>and then only under conditions of stress</p>
<p>or heightened arginine or citrulline ingestion</p>
<p>will have them later.</p>
<p>Again, this is not necessarily a sexually, an STI.</p>
<p>This is a sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<p>This is an infection that is passed very easily</p>
<p>from mucous membranes,</p>
<p>just in terms of touching objects and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Very common in the general population.</p>
<p>Any discussion about muscle and muscle performance</p>
<p>would not be adequate</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t mention something about nutrition,</p>
<p>but rather than have a whole discussion about nutrition,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of information about that online,</p>
<p>like for instance, if you want to gain muscle,</p>
<p>that you need to have a caloric surplus</p>
<p>of about 10 to 15%.</p>
<p>You could have a caloric surplus of more</p>
<p>if you want to avoid gaining weight,</p>
<p>then you would not create a caloric surplus, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can find all that information online.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this podcast is really about.</p>
<p>We had a month where we talked a lot about hormones</p>
<p>and food and moods.</p>
<p>We talked about foods,</p>
<p>but more as they relate to the nervous system.</p>
<p>When it comes to supporting muscle,</p>
<p>to supporting the synthesis of larger,</p>
<p>what I called myosin balloons,</p>
<p>it does seem that ingesting 700 to 3,000 milligrams</p>
<p>of the essential amino acid leucine</p>
<p>with each meal is important.</p>
<p>Now, that does not necessarily mean from supplements.</p>
<p>In fact, most people recommend that you get your protein,</p>
<p>you get your amino acids,</p>
<p>including your essential amino acids</p>
<p>and your leucine from whole foods,</p>
<p>high quality proteins, high density proteins.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, it is true that a lot of sources of protein</p>
<p>are found in things like beans and nuts</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>that all the essential amino acids can be found there.</p>
<p>But per unit calorie, if it&rsquo;s in your practice,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in your ethics to ingest animal proteins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true that for instance,</p>
<p>200 calories of steak or chicken or fish or eggs</p>
<p>will have a higher density of essential amino acids</p>
<p>than the equivalent amount of calories from nuts or plants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just simply the way it works.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not, for the vegans and vegetarians,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not saying there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>that you can support muscle growth.</p>
<p>You absolutely can.</p>
<p>Some of them might want to supplement leucine,</p>
<p>but this 700 to 3,000 milligrams of leucine per meal</p>
<p>is one of the best ways that&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>to support the synthesis of more myosin</p>
<p>if your goal is hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the way that you would support muscle repair</p>
<p>if your goal is strength.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s specifically geared</p>
<p>towards muscle hypertrophy and strength.</p>
<p>And I encourage you to think about this</p>
<p>protein density issue</p>
<p>and whether or not you ingest animal proteins or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>to think about whether or not you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>sufficient essential amino acids, especially leucine.</p>
<p>Now, many people have addressed the question</p>
<p>of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day.</p>
<p>It turns out that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the old school thinking</p>
<p>that you need to eat very frequently.</p>
<p>I think for certain athletes who are very active</p>
<p>for drug-assisted,</p>
<p>meaning people that are enhancing their testosterone levels</p>
<p>to super physiological levels,</p>
<p>where they are experiencing very heightened levels</p>
<p>of protein synthesis and they can utilize all that,</p>
<p>that might make sense.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not supporting the use</p>
<p>of those performance enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>but there are people doing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why they eat so frequently</p>
<p>and so much protein.</p>
<p>For typical people who are not doing that,</p>
<p>I imagine most of you are not,</p>
<p>then it does appear that you need to eat,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to eat six or seven times a day.</p>
<p>It does seem like not eating once a day is also important.</p>
<p>So somewhere between one meal a day and six meals a day</p>
<p>lies the more reasonable two or three</p>
<p>or maybe four times a day.</p>
<p>I think that a whole discussion about this is warranted</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have this discussion with Dr. Galpin</p>
<p>at a future time of how,</p>
<p>whether or not eating protein more frequently</p>
<p>can enhance this myosin synthesis.</p>
<p>But I think the simple takeaway from the literature</p>
<p>that I was able to extract and from my discussion with him</p>
<p>is eating two to four times a day,</p>
<p>making sure you&rsquo;re getting sufficient amino acids</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s compatible with your ethics</p>
<p>and with your nutritional regimen</p>
<p>is going to support muscle repair, muscle growth,</p>
<p>strength improvements, et cetera, just fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing that I&rsquo;d like to cover,</p>
<p>which is the relationship</p>
<p>between particular kinds of exercise</p>
<p>and our ability to think and perform cognitive functions.</p>
<p>We all hear that exercise is so vital for our brain</p>
<p>that it supports our brain health and our body health.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s true, provided it&rsquo;s done correctly.</p>
<p>However, many of us are familiar with the experience</p>
<p>of going for a run or going for a swim</p>
<p>or working out hard in the gym</p>
<p>and then not being able to use our brain</p>
<p>to be essentially useless for cognitive functions</p>
<p>for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I discussed this with Dr. Galpin this morning</p>
<p>and I learned something very interesting,</p>
<p>which is that hard bouts of exercise</p>
<p>of the sort where you&rsquo;re training near failure</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re generating focused muscular contractions</p>
<p>for a session that lasts anywhere from, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes,</p>
<p>or a long run where you&rsquo;re engaging</p>
<p>in some interval training during that run.</p>
<p>After exercise,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reduction in oxygenation of the brain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually a quite significant dip</p>
<p>in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting</p>
<p>and therefore your ability to think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important that you control the intensity</p>
<p>and the duration of your training sessions</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re still able to do well in life</p>
<p>and lean into life the way you need to,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m guessing most of you are not in a position</p>
<p>to just prioritize your physical training.</p>
<p>You also need to use your minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise,</p>
<p>but also the requirement of needing to perform</p>
<p>cognitive work throughout the day.</p>
<p>It also turns out that you can leverage something</p>
<p>interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work</p>
<p>in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the way that your body</p>
<p>and your nervous system predict bouts</p>
<p>of intense focused effort.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing resistance training</p>
<p>two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it consistently at a given time.</p>
<p>There are clocks, literally biological clocks</p>
<p>within the liver and within the brain</p>
<p>that learn to predict that focus and that intense work.</p>
<p>If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done,</p>
<p>you might try scheduling that cognitive work</p>
<p>on the days when you don&rsquo;t do physical training</p>
<p>at the same time when you normally would do</p>
<p>that intense focused physical training.</p>
<p>Because the systems of the body that generate</p>
<p>acetylcholine release and other neuromodulators,</p>
<p>the systems of the body and brain</p>
<p>that generate focused effort,</p>
<p>those are on this sort of clock mechanism</p>
<p>in a way that you likely will find</p>
<p>that after just a week of training at regular times,</p>
<p>you will be able to focus readily on other things</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not training,</p>
<p>provided you do it during the period of time of day</p>
<p>when you normally would train.</p>
<p>So this is kind of an indirect positive effect.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus</p>
<p>in your nervous system for that particular time of day.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;d be remiss</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t talk about time of day for training.</p>
<p>Turns out that whether or not you do,</p>
<p>whether or not you train in the morning or in the afternoon,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really seem to matter</p>
<p>for sake of things like hypertrophy and strength, et cetera.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a time of day</p>
<p>that they prefer to train.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>and there are reasons based on body temperature rhythms</p>
<p>and cortisol release that training 30 minutes,</p>
<p>three hours or 11 hours after your normal waking time</p>
<p>can be very beneficial</p>
<p>and can provide a sort of predictability or regularity</p>
<p>to when your body will be ready to train</p>
<p>and best apt to train well.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that training in the afternoon</p>
<p>is better for performance,</p>
<p>whereas training for body composition changes</p>
<p>and strength changes, et cetera,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter when you train.</p>
<p>So you also want to make it compatible with sleep,</p>
<p>compatible with work.</p>
<p>That really gets down into the weeds of optimization.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting to note</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to train at a regular time,</p>
<p>you can take the days when you don&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>and use that to enhance your cognitive focus</p>
<p>for things that have nothing to do with exercise.</p>
<p>So this might be writing or reading</p>
<p>or music or math, et cetera.</p>
<p>Typically, I restrict these podcast episodes</p>
<p>to about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>so-called ultradian cycle for learning.</p>
<p>Today was a bit longer.</p>
<p>And I admit that I tried to pack a lot into this.</p>
<p>It is the last episode in this month</p>
<p>on physical performance.</p>
<p>I figured in this case, more is better,</p>
<p>especially since everything is timestamped for you.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t have to watch it all at once.</p>
<p>And you can come back to it over and over again</p>
<p>and to the precise locations in the episode that you like</p>
<p>in order to take notes</p>
<p>or extract the information that you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to point you to Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s page.</p>
<p>I highly recommend looking into the work that he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>if you want more details.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, very skilled, excellent communicator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s superb at what he does.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor.</p>
<p>He works with athletes.</p>
<p>He works with typical folks</p>
<p>in the exercise and muscle physiology world.</p>
<p>Brad Schoenfield&rsquo;s work, I also have a lot of respect for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no paid endorsement here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sponsors or related to the podcast in any way.</p>
<p>I just think the work is of very high quality</p>
<p>and they are both on the academic side</p>
<p>and the practical side.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other people out there</p>
<p>doing fabulous work in this area as well.</p>
<p>If you like this podcast</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re benefiting from the information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re learning and you want to support us,</p>
<p>the simplest and most straightforward way to do that</p>
<p>is a zero cost way, which is to subscribe, excuse me,</p>
<p>subscribe to the podcast on YouTube.</p>
<p>Click the subscribe button</p>
<p>and to subscribe on Apple and Spotify as well.</p>
<p>That really helps us.</p>
<p>It helps us get the message about the podcast</p>
<p>out more broadly, generally,</p>
<p>and it ensures that you don&rsquo;t miss any episodes.</p>
<p>In addition, check out the sponsors</p>
<p>that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.</p>
<p>If you like, and if you&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>supporting us through those sponsors</p>
<p>is a terrific way to support our production staff</p>
<p>and the podcast generally.</p>
<p>A zero cost way to support the podcast</p>
<p>is to tell your friends, tell your neighbors,</p>
<p>tell anyone that you think might benefit</p>
<p>from the information.</p>
<p>The way this podcast is set up,</p>
<p>the information is batched into four or five episodes,</p>
<p>all centered around a given theme or topic,</p>
<p>like hormones, like sleep.</p>
<p>So the episodes on sleep, for instance,</p>
<p>that were way back in January,</p>
<p>what seems like way back,</p>
<p>are still every bit as relevant today</p>
<p>as they were back in January</p>
<p>for somebody that has challenges with sleep</p>
<p>and wants to understand sleep and get better at sleep,</p>
<p>or wants to understand their dreams</p>
<p>or how to use sleep and dreaming</p>
<p>to leverage neuroplasticity and learning.</p>
<p>So if you pass information along about the podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And as always, please put your questions</p>
<p>about the podcast episodes</p>
<p>and suggestions for future episodes</p>
<p>in the comment section.</p>
<p>I really do read through all those comments.</p>
<p>It takes me some time, but I do read through those.</p>
<p>I reply to as many of them as I can,</p>
<p>but I do read them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a great way for us to get feedback.</p>
<p>On Apple, you can give us a five-star review</p>
<p>if you think we deserve that.</p>
<p>And if you want to do all these things you&rsquo;re welcome to,</p>
<p>if you want to do just one of them, we understand.</p>
<p>And if you do none of them,</p>
<p>we still appreciate that you come here</p>
<p>to digest the information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>Last but not least,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your time and attention today.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
