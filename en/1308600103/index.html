    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing happiness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss the science of happiness</p>
<p>because indeed there are excellent laboratories</p>
<p>that have worked for many decades</p>
<p>to try and understand what is this thing</p>
<p>that we call happiness</p>
<p>and what brings us happiness in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>In fact, we could probably point to happiness</p>
<p>as one of the most sought-after states</p>
<p>or commodities or emotions,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Happiness is what many people are seeking</p>
<p>in work, in relationships, and in general.</p>
<p>And yet most of us can&rsquo;t really define</p>
<p>exactly what happiness is or means for us.</p>
<p>We can point to certain experiences,</p>
<p>we can try and describe our states of mind and body,</p>
<p>but most people recognize the feeling when we have it.</p>
<p>And we certainly recognize the feeling of not being happy,</p>
<p>whether or not that means simply not being happy</p>
<p>as the absence of happiness or all-out depression.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key problems</p>
<p>in trying to understand happiness</p>
<p>and indeed the science and psychology of happiness</p>
<p>is that it does indeed involve other similar things,</p>
<p>things like joy and gratitude and meaning.</p>
<p>And indeed, many scientists and psychologists</p>
<p>have argued for many, many decades</p>
<p>about what happiness really is.</p>
<p>Now, we can come up with so-called</p>
<p>operational definitions of happiness.</p>
<p>Operational definitions are basically agreed-upon terms</p>
<p>or agreed-upon definitions and conditions</p>
<p>that will define something such as happiness,</p>
<p>much in the same way that we can all</p>
<p>probably come up with an operational definition of milk.</p>
<p>But of course, milk can be cow&rsquo;s milk,</p>
<p>it can be oat milk, it can be soy milk, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So too, something like happiness can be micro-divided</p>
<p>and sliced and diced into as many things as we decide.</p>
<p>Today, we are really going to focus on three main things.</p>
<p>First, we are going to define happiness as a brain state</p>
<p>and as a state of mind and body.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take a look at what the science says</p>
<p>about all of that.</p>
<p>Second, we are going to talk about tools and practices</p>
<p>for placing ourselves into states of happiness.</p>
<p>And while for most of us, we think of happiness</p>
<p>as something that only arrives</p>
<p>through the acquisition of some goal</p>
<p>or some thing external to us,</p>
<p>and of course, that is true,</p>
<p>there is also something called synthetic happiness</p>
<p>or synthesized happiness,</p>
<p>which turns out to be at least as powerful</p>
<p>and perhaps even more powerful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say right off the bat</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that all you have to do</p>
<p>is sit in a chair and imagine being happy</p>
<p>in order to feel happy.</p>
<p>Synthesized happiness actually involves</p>
<p>some very concrete steps that have been defined</p>
<p>by excellent labs in psychology.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about synthesized happiness</p>
<p>as it relates to what you can do</p>
<p>to obtain happy states more readily or more frequently.</p>
<p>And then third, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the misconceptions</p>
<p>or what I would call the contradictions</p>
<p>of happiness research.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is most of you have probably heard</p>
<p>about the general conditions for obtaining happiness.</p>
<p>And they always seem to circle back</p>
<p>to some of the same basic features of get great sleep,</p>
<p>have great social connection, pursue meaning,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t focus to any overextent on things like pursuing money</p>
<p>because there are indeed these studies that show</p>
<p>that the amount of money that people makes</p>
<p>does not necessarily scale directly with happiness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about those studies in some detail</p>
<p>a little bit later.</p>
<p>And while all of that literature is very powerful</p>
<p>and informative, there is what I see as a contradiction,</p>
<p>which is for instance, that for many of us,</p>
<p>including myself, especially in the years</p>
<p>when I was in graduate school and a postdoc,</p>
<p>there were times in which pursuing</p>
<p>and being involved in work and pursuing degrees</p>
<p>and finding meaning in my vocation</p>
<p>actually separated me from the opportunity</p>
<p>to have quite as many social connections</p>
<p>or quite as much sleep or quite as much exercise</p>
<p>or even quite as much sunshine for that matter.</p>
<p>So all of the things that we&rsquo;re told that we need</p>
<p>in order to access happiness on a regular basis</p>
<p>oftentimes contradict with the pressures</p>
<p>and the requirements of not just daily life,</p>
<p>but in building a life that allows us</p>
<p>to have the kind of resources that we need</p>
<p>in order to have things like quality social connection</p>
<p>and the time and opportunity to get regular exercise</p>
<p>and great nutrition, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So again, while this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a complaint</p>
<p>with any of the research out of the fields of psychology</p>
<p>on happiness, it is important that we acknowledge</p>
<p>these contradictions that exist</p>
<p>in the discussion around happiness,</p>
<p>in particular, the popular discussions</p>
<p>around the science of happiness.</p>
<p>So today what we are going to arrive at,</p>
<p>what you will finish this episode with,</p>
<p>is a set of tools and a framework for understanding</p>
<p>the pursuit of happiness in the short and long-term</p>
<p>as it relates to the research from psychology,</p>
<p>but also the neuroscience.</p>
<p>And my goal today is really to try and place that all</p>
<p>into a structured framework so that you can know</p>
<p>where you are in your journey or the landscape</p>
<p>around happiness and your pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>And what I won&rsquo;t tell you is that you need to abandon</p>
<p>all goals in terms of pursuing money, career, et cetera,</p>
<p>and simply focus on relationships.</p>
<p>But we will talk about what constitutes</p>
<p>an excellent social bond or even an excellent conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s excellent research that points to the fact</p>
<p>that even rather shallow connections,</p>
<p>that is connections between people that you happen</p>
<p>to just see in the hallway on a regular basis,</p>
<p>not even requiring close bonds of any kind,</p>
<p>can be built into close bonds that can deliver</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of feeling and genuine social connection</p>
<p>provided certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>So today, again, is really about understanding</p>
<p>the science of happiness, understanding the mechanisms</p>
<p>underlying what we call happiness,</p>
<p>and providing you a framework by which you can pursue</p>
<p>and achieve happiness, not just as a long-term goal</p>
<p>and not just as a day-to-day goal</p>
<p>of little micro exercises of gratitude, et cetera,</p>
<p>but rather as a way to think about happiness</p>
<p>as a state that you have control over,</p>
<p>at least in terms of your ability to access</p>
<p>what I would call the algorithms that enable us</p>
<p>or open the opportunity to experience happiness.</p>
<p>Now, before we begin today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about a very specific tool</p>
<p>that applies, yes, to our pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>but actually to our pursuit of everything,</p>
<p>including quality sleep and ongoing motivation, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many, many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>and on other podcasts and on social media</p>
<p>about the critical value of getting regular bright light,</p>
<p>ideally sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>within the first hour of waking,</p>
<p>or if the sun isn&rsquo;t out when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>to turn on a lot of bright artificial lights</p>
<p>and then get sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>for anywhere from five to 20 minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how cloudy it is in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>Absolutely outsized effects on mood and focus</p>
<p>during the day and quality of sleep at night.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another sort of central tenet</p>
<p>of getting great sleep and improving mood</p>
<p>and focus throughout the day,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to avoid bright artificial light exposure</p>
<p>to your eyes between the hours of about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, leaving shift workers aside,</p>
<p>and we have an entire episode devoted to shift work,</p>
<p>most people are asleep at night and awake during the day,</p>
<p>and you would be wise to avoid exposure of your eyes</p>
<p>to bright artificial light</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to use screens or artificial lights,</p>
<p>dim them down as far as you can.</p>
<p>Now, there are several studies that point to the fact</p>
<p>that one of the major issues</p>
<p>with getting bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>is that it has a negative impact</p>
<p>on the so-called dopaminergic or dopamine circuits</p>
<p>of the brain and body, which can enhance depression,</p>
<p>that is, lead to ongoing lower mood and affect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a reason to dim the lights</p>
<p>or avoid bright lights between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>However, I and many others need</p>
<p>to use artificial light and screens,</p>
<p>sometimes even between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight,</p>
<p>or even midnight to 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>depending on what&rsquo;s going on in my life or your life,</p>
<p>that may include you as well.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that there are powerful ways</p>
<p>to offset some, not all,</p>
<p>but some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of viewing artificial lights</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>And one of the most powerful ways to do that</p>
<p>is to simply adjust the overall brightness</p>
<p>of your artificial lighting throughout the day</p>
<p>and in the evening.</p>
<p>So one of the issues nowadays that we&rsquo;re really facing</p>
<p>is that people are simply not getting enough bright light</p>
<p>in their eyes from sunlight</p>
<p>or from other sources during the daytime,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting far too much bright light in their eyes,</p>
<p>largely from artificial sources, of course,</p>
<p>in the evening and at night,</p>
<p>not just from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>but also in the evening hours from 6 to 10 p.m.</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So a very simple yet powerful solution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supported by peer-reviewed research in humans</p>
<p>is to try and make your indoor working</p>
<p>and or home environment during the day</p>
<p>as bright as possible.</p>
<p>Now, if you can achieve that through direct sunlight,</p>
<p>terrific.</p>
<p>If you can get outside a lot during the daytime, terrific,</p>
<p>but many people simply cannot.</p>
<p>But most people do have some windows in their environment.</p>
<p>I realize some don&rsquo;t, but most people do.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>most people are using rather dim artificial lighting</p>
<p>indoors during the day,</p>
<p>and then very bright artificial lighting indoors</p>
<p>in the evening and at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>logically you want to do the exact reverse.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been shown that if you simply increase</p>
<p>the amount of bright artificial light</p>
<p>that you were exposed to during the day,</p>
<p>and remember, this is not an excuse</p>
<p>to not get your morning sunlight viewing,</p>
<p>but in addition to that,</p>
<p>to make your indoor artificial lights</p>
<p>very bright, bright, bright, bright, bright</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>and then much dimmer from the hours of 6 p.m.</p>
<p>until bedtime.</p>
<p>Or if you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then maybe as soon as you get home from about 8 p.m.</p>
<p>until bedtime, and then dim them way, way down</p>
<p>between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. or off entirely,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a far better pattern</p>
<p>for your sleep-wake cycles, focus, mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>than what most people do,</p>
<p>which is to have a few windows</p>
<p>in their indoor working environment during the day</p>
<p>and keep the indoor lights rather dim</p>
<p>at a time when they need more photons, more light energy.</p>
<p>And then in the evening when they get home,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s dark outside,</p>
<p>they tend to turn the lights much brighter.</p>
<p>You actually want to do the reverse.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an even simpler solution,</p>
<p>which is to get some bright sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>right around the time of sunset.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be exactly at sunset.</p>
<p>It could be in the late afternoon and evening,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been shown now in studies on humans,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll provide a link to at least one of those studies,</p>
<p>that by getting some bright light in your eyes,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight in the late afternoon and evening,</p>
<p>and of course the timing will vary</p>
<p>depending on time of year</p>
<p>and where you are located on the planet,</p>
<p>but facing the sun around sunset,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t actually have to see the sun</p>
<p>cross down below the horizon,</p>
<p>but facing the sun around that time</p>
<p>for anywhere from five to 10 minutes,</p>
<p>or even less, even two to five minutes,</p>
<p>can adjust the sensitivity of neurons in your retina</p>
<p>that communicate light information to the brain</p>
<p>and make it such that in the evening</p>
<p>when you use artificial lights,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t going to have as much of a detrimental effect</p>
<p>on your dopamine system and for impairing your sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so the idea is as much bright light,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight, but also from artificial sources</p>
<p>from the time you wake up in the morning until the evening,</p>
<p>maybe around six or seven o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>maybe in the summer months a little bit later,</p>
<p>and then really try and get as little bright light</p>
<p>in your eyes as you can in the evening and nighttime hours.</p>
<p>And ideally you would also get some sunlight exposure</p>
<p>right around the time of sunset or in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Go outside, take your sunglasses off.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and do this through a windshield</p>
<p>or through a window.</p>
<p>It will not work.</p>
<p>You have to get outside.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re under an overhang,</p>
<p>at least try and get some direct sunlight</p>
<p>in your eyes at that time.</p>
<p>And that will adjust the sensitivity of your retina</p>
<p>such that bright artificial lights</p>
<p>or artificial lights of any kind</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re exposed to in the evening</p>
<p>and in the late hours of the night</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have as much of a detrimental effect.</p>
<p>That said, if you go to the bathroom</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>try and keep the lights dim.</p>
<p>Many people have asked whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>a nightlight or a flashlight</p>
<p>is going to have as much of a negative effect.</p>
<p>This is very straightforward.</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>if you shine a light at something,</p>
<p>you can see into your environment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been camping</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve walked with a flashlight,</p>
<p>you can see things around you</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise, of course.</p>
<p>But if you were to shine that light in your eyes,</p>
<p>it would be far brighter.</p>
<p>So yes, of course,</p>
<p>if you get up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and you can use your phone flashlight</p>
<p>to illuminate the environment that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>so that you can safely go to where you need to go</p>
<p>and then back to bed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be far better than turning on the lights</p>
<p>or of course, shining light in your eyes, right?</p>
<p>So the idea is bright, bright, bright</p>
<p>in the morning and throughout the day</p>
<p>and as dim and dark as possible at night.</p>
<p>And that afternoon light viewing</p>
<p>provides sort of what I call a Netflix inoculation</p>
<p>that will allow you to adjust your retinal sensitivity</p>
<p>and give you a little bit more flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of allowing some nighttime light exposure</p>
<p>without the detrimental effects.</p>
<p>Now, I realize today&rsquo;s episode is about happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about sunlight or dopamine.</p>
<p>And yet, as we&rsquo;ll talk about more in just a moment,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not optimizing your sleep</p>
<p>and if you are using or being exposed to light rather</p>
<p>at the wrong times of the day-night cycle,</p>
<p>that is going to make it very hard</p>
<p>for the other sorts of practices</p>
<p>that relate to happiness to have their full impact.</p>
<p>So the backdrop,</p>
<p>or I would say the kind of landscape</p>
<p>of your chemicals and your hormones</p>
<p>is powerfully controlled</p>
<p>by not just the brightness of light,</p>
<p>but the timing of light.</p>
<p>And your exposure to light,</p>
<p>in particular, your exposure to light to your eyes</p>
<p>is something that you have a lot of control over.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have absolute control,</p>
<p>but you have a lot of control over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been proven that even these small steps,</p>
<p>which are completely cost-free,</p>
<p>they require just a few minutes of time,</p>
<p>but no purchase of product or anything else,</p>
<p>can allow you to greatly adjust your neurochemistry</p>
<p>and your hormones in the direction of better mood,</p>
<p>better sleep, and happiness.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about happiness,</p>
<p>this thing that everybody seems to want,</p>
<p>and yet not everybody can agree upon what exactly it is</p>
<p>or how to get it.</p>
<p>Now, I want to start by quoting a previous guest</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and that is a colleague of mine</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s both a bioengineer and a clinician.</p>
<p>That is, he&rsquo;s a psychiatrist who spends a lot of his time</p>
<p>both running a laboratory and seeing patients,</p>
<p>human patients, of course.</p>
<p>And I once was at a meeting where I heard Karl say</p>
<p>something to the extent of,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what other people feel.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even really know how we feel.</p>
<p>And while that statement was meant</p>
<p>to report several different things</p>
<p>about the way that the brain works and emotions, et cetera,</p>
<p>one of the things that he was emphasizing,</p>
<p>and I know he was emphasizing it</p>
<p>because he confirmed this for me,</p>
<p>was the fact that language,</p>
<p>things like the word happiness or joy or meaning</p>
<p>or pleasure or delight are actually not very precise</p>
<p>when it comes to describing our brain and body states.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I tell you I&rsquo;m feeling pretty happy,</p>
<p>I know what that means for me, at least in this moment,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really know whether or not</p>
<p>it means the same thing as what pretty happy means for you.</p>
<p>If I say I&rsquo;m extremely happy and I have a big grin,</p>
<p>I have a grin on my face</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t seem to wipe off my face,</p>
<p>well, then you might get a sense of how much happier I am</p>
<p>than pretty happy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still hard to calibrate my level</p>
<p>of internal state or happiness.</p>
<p>And the same is true for you and for everybody else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important for us to acknowledge this</p>
<p>because at this point in human history, 2022,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really have a measurement like body temperature</p>
<p>or heart rate or heart rate variability,</p>
<p>or even a way to measure neurochemicals</p>
<p>in the brain and body that give us anything better</p>
<p>than a crude correlate or an estimate at best</p>
<p>of what happiness is.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>and to keep in mind throughout this episode.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we cannot have a strong</p>
<p>data-driven conversation about happiness</p>
<p>and what brings us to a state of happiness,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that language is not an ideal</p>
<p>and may be even a deficient tool</p>
<p>in terms of describing our emotions</p>
<p>and our states of mind and body.</p>
<p>Now, equally important is to understand</p>
<p>that while we do have neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>that is the chemicals that are released</p>
<p>between neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that allow neurons to communicate,</p>
<p>things like glutamate and GABA, for instance,</p>
<p>and we have what are called neuromodulators.</p>
<p>These are chemicals also released by neurons</p>
<p>that impact the electrical firing</p>
<p>and chemical release of other neurons,</p>
<p>things like serotonin and dopamine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters</p>
<p>are always present in a cocktail in our brain and body.</p>
<p>That is, they are present in different ratios</p>
<p>and at different levels.</p>
<p>So we need to completely discard with the idea</p>
<p>that any one neurotransmitter or any one neuromodulator</p>
<p>is solely responsible for a state of happiness</p>
<p>or for a lack of state of happiness for that matter.</p>
<p>That said, it is true that for people</p>
<p>that tend to have lower baseline levels</p>
<p>of, for instance, dopamine,</p>
<p>their levels of happiness,</p>
<p>or we should say their self-reported levels of happiness</p>
<p>tend to be lower than for those</p>
<p>that have greatly elevated baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, this can be best appreciated at the extremes</p>
<p>where, for instance, in conditions like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>or other conditions where people&rsquo;s levels of dopamine</p>
<p>in their brain is severely depleted,</p>
<p>mind you, we also see this in drug-addicted individuals</p>
<p>that are in a withdrawal state</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to quit</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t have access to the drug</p>
<p>that normally stimulates release of dopamine.</p>
<p>Think the cocaine addict who can&rsquo;t get cocaine</p>
<p>or the methamphetamine addict that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>or is trying to avoid taking methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Or the Parkinson&rsquo;s patient who has fewer dopamine neurons</p>
<p>because they degenerated.</p>
<p>Those individuals do tend to be more depressed.</p>
<p>They tend to have lower affect.</p>
<p>They are less happy.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s how they report themselves to be emotionally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we observe when we look at them behaviorally</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of smiling,</p>
<p>the amount of energy they seem to have.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme,</p>
<p>and while still focusing on the kind of pathology</p>
<p>of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems,</p>
<p>an individual who is in a manic phase of bipolar</p>
<p>will tend to have very elevated levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>And those people will talk a mile a minute</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t require sleep.</p>
<p>And at least to them, every idea is an exciting idea</p>
<p>and one that they want to pursue.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode about bipolar depression,</p>
<p>aka bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about that,</p>
<p>please check out that episode,</p>
<p>that and all other episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find it hubermanlab.com in all formats.</p>
<p>But the point here is that very low levels</p>
<p>or very high levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are correlated with certain states of, for instance,</p>
<p>low happiness or the absence of happiness.</p>
<p>We could even call it depression in some cases,</p>
<p>or extreme happiness, or even euphoria,</p>
<p>sometimes even inappropriate euphoria,</p>
<p>as is the case with bipolar depression,</p>
<p>or as sometimes called bipolar mania or bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s a range</p>
<p>in between depressed and manic.</p>
<p>And most people fortunately reside somewhere in that range.</p>
<p>And it is indeed a continuum.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that levels of dopamine</p>
<p>probably do correlate with levels of happiness,</p>
<p>but there is no one single chemical nor chemical signature</p>
<p>that is no specific recipe of two parts dopamine</p>
<p>to one part serotonin to one part acetylcholine</p>
<p>that we can say equates to happiness.</p>
<p>Indeed, there&rsquo;s now tremendous controversy</p>
<p>as to whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>having lower levels of serotonin</p>
<p>is actually the cause of depression</p>
<p>or merely correlates with depression,</p>
<p>or maybe doesn&rsquo;t even correlate with depression at all.</p>
<p>This became especially controversial</p>
<p>because in the last year,</p>
<p>the so-called serotonin hypothesis of depression</p>
<p>has been called into question.</p>
<p>And indeed, it does seem to be the case</p>
<p>that for individuals that are depressed,</p>
<p>their levels of serotonin can sometimes be normal.</p>
<p>However, and this is an important however,</p>
<p>that does not mean that administering drugs</p>
<p>that increase levels of serotonin in depressed people</p>
<p>does not sometimes and indeed often</p>
<p>help ameliorate some of their symptoms.</p>
<p>And I should mention that many of the selective serotonin</p>
<p>reuptake inhibitors, so-called SSRIs,</p>
<p>such as Prozac and Zoloft, et cetera,</p>
<p>are still considered excellent treatments</p>
<p>for conditions like OCD and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to do is make two important points.</p>
<p>First of all, that language is not a great indicator</p>
<p>of internal state,</p>
<p>especially when trying to understand</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s internal state,</p>
<p>and that is especially true for things like happiness,</p>
<p>and that there is no one chemical signature of happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one neuromodulator</p>
<p>or combinations of neuromodulators</p>
<p>that we can say is the cocktail for happiness.</p>
<p>But, and it&rsquo;s a very important but,</p>
<p>when levels of dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>tend to be chronically low for an individual,</p>
<p>below their typical baseline,</p>
<p>they will, yes, tend to be lower in affect</p>
<p>and have lower mood and less episodes of happiness</p>
<p>per day, per week, per month, per year, et cetera.</p>
<p>Conversely, when an individual has elevations</p>
<p>in dopamine and serotonin levels,</p>
<p>in particular dopamine levels,</p>
<p>and the other so-called catecholamines,</p>
<p>which include epinephrine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>so the catecholamines are dopamine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all very similar biochemically.</p>
<p>They all lead to states of elevated motivation,</p>
<p>energy, and so on.</p>
<p>When those chemicals are elevated above baseline,</p>
<p>people do tend to have elevated sense of mood and wellbeing,</p>
<p>and in particular, sense of possibility</p>
<p>about what they can do in the world</p>
<p>and what the world can offer them.</p>
<p>So we need to acknowledge those two features</p>
<p>of language and neurochemistry</p>
<p>as we wade into the discussion</p>
<p>about the psychology of happiness,</p>
<p>and in particular, about the controlled experiments</p>
<p>that have been done in excellent laboratories</p>
<p>focused on the psychology of happiness</p>
<p>and what brings happiness and what does not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some excellent studies on happiness,</p>
<p>and these come in two forms, generally.</p>
<p>One form of these studies</p>
<p>is individuals come into a laboratory,</p>
<p>they participate in an experiment</p>
<p>over the course of a day or months,</p>
<p>and then data are collected, analyzed,</p>
<p>and the papers are submitted and published and discussed.</p>
<p>The other form is so-called longitudinal study</p>
<p>where individuals come into the laboratory</p>
<p>and they are studied over a very long period of time</p>
<p>ranging from months to years and sometimes even decades.</p>
<p>And then the variables of age,</p>
<p>life circumstances, and other factors</p>
<p>can be incorporated into the data.</p>
<p>And typically there are multiple papers,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s data published</p>
<p>throughout the longitudinal study,</p>
<p>or sometimes it&rsquo;s just one paper</p>
<p>at the end of the longitudinal study.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about one of the more famous</p>
<p>and perhaps the longest running longitudinal study</p>
<p>on happiness.</p>
<p>This is a study that was initiated or conceived in 1938</p>
<p>at Harvard University,</p>
<p>the so-called Harvard Happiness Project.</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard about this.</p>
<p>It involved Harvard College sophomores</p>
<p>and other individuals were incorporated</p>
<p>in this study as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a study that initially had</p>
<p>more than a couple of hundred subjects,</p>
<p>but because some have either dropped out</p>
<p>and not been able to be contacted</p>
<p>and monitored over time or died,</p>
<p>or for whatever reason are no longer participating</p>
<p>in the study,</p>
<p>there are very few of these individuals left.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s tremendous power to a study like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an impressive study.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all so grateful that laboratories at Harvard</p>
<p>decided to initiate and continue this study</p>
<p>because it is one of the few studies,</p>
<p>perhaps the study that has allowed us to understand</p>
<p>happiness in our species over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>Like any study, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t include a lot of matching by sex</p>
<p>or matching by vocation</p>
<p>or matching by income and background.</p>
<p>And back then there was also a lot less discussion</p>
<p>about trauma and histories around trauma,</p>
<p>as well as positive episodes in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s a lot of power in a study like this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some very basic takeaways,</p>
<p>some of which you may have heard before,</p>
<p>but some of which may be surprising</p>
<p>those of you who haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So one of the key things about the study</p>
<p>is people in the study,</p>
<p>at least those who still have intact memory,</p>
<p>which many of them do,</p>
<p>are able to think back on</p>
<p>not just their previous year or week,</p>
<p>but 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago,</p>
<p>and compare what makes them happy at one age</p>
<p>versus another age.</p>
<p>A number of things have emerged from that conversation.</p>
<p>So I just want to discuss some of the highlight points,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll get into a little bit more</p>
<p>of the nitty gritty of the data.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s been discussed many, many times</p>
<p>that the total amount of income</p>
<p>that an individual makes or has,</p>
<p>and again, this could be income from work,</p>
<p>or it could be money that they inherited,</p>
<p>does not seem to directly relate</p>
<p>to their level of happiness.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people take that point</p>
<p>and think, ah, money doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Other people hear that point and think to themselves,</p>
<p>yeah, right, easy to say if you have a lot of money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the interpretation of those data</p>
<p>in just a few minutes,</p>
<p>but I do want to earmark that finding</p>
<p>because I agree that while money or total resources itself</p>
<p>does not predict happiness in any kind of direct way,</p>
<p>that is not the same thing as saying</p>
<p>having very few resources will make you happier, of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone would imagine that.</p>
<p>But it also tends to overlook an important point,</p>
<p>which is something that I certainly have learned</p>
<p>to appreciate in my life,</p>
<p>and something that I especially appreciated</p>
<p>when I was a student and postdoc, which is the following.</p>
<p>People will say money can&rsquo;t buy happiness,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about the buy aspect of that in a moment.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If you look at this longitudinal study</p>
<p>or you look at other studies that are done</p>
<p>on a more short-term basis,</p>
<p>once people get past a certain level of income</p>
<p>relative to their cost of living,</p>
<p>the amount of happiness does not scale with that income.</p>
<p>That is for every additional $1,000 or $10,000</p>
<p>that they earn,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t report being that much happier on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Now, that said, I venture the argument</p>
<p>that while money truly cannot buy happiness,</p>
<p>it absolutely can buffer stress.</p>
<p>And in particular, it can buffer stress</p>
<p>in the form of the ability to purchase</p>
<p>or pay for goods and services,</p>
<p>and in particular, services.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to tell me that having children</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t involve some increase in the demands on your life,</p>
<p>less sleep and more demands.</p>
<p>And it certainly is the case</p>
<p>that if you can hire help to clean,</p>
<p>you can hire nannies if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>you can hire help to assist with babysitting</p>
<p>or even night nurses if you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping</p>
<p>that will literally allow you to sleep</p>
<p>while they take care of your child</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>often give excellent care, one hopes excellent care,</p>
<p>that that won&rsquo;t offset some of the stress</p>
<p>associated with lack of sleep.</p>
<p>So there are a million different examples</p>
<p>one could give of this,</p>
<p>but I certainly experienced this during graduate school.</p>
<p>In fact, I experienced both sides of the equation here.</p>
<p>I made very little money as a graduate student.</p>
<p>I had essentially no savings when I started graduate school</p>
<p>and I made very little money.</p>
<p>The amount doesn&rsquo;t matter at this point,</p>
<p>but I could just barely afford rent and my food.</p>
<p>I actually opted to live in the laboratory</p>
<p>a lot of the time.</p>
<p>And by doing that, I had more money to spend</p>
<p>on other things that were important to me.</p>
<p>Now, I did not have a family at the time.</p>
<p>And so I was able to do that,</p>
<p>something that not everyone can do,</p>
<p>but I made very little money.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I was in laboratory all the time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>And so my level of stress was actually pretty low</p>
<p>because I was investing all my time and energy</p>
<p>into the very thing that I knew</p>
<p>would eventually help bring me more resources.</p>
<p>When I moved from being a graduate student</p>
<p>to a postdoc, for instance,</p>
<p>a postdoc is generally a three to five year period.</p>
<p>So like residency in medicine</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re no longer taking courses,</p>
<p>but you continue to do research.</p>
<p>In fact, entire new lines of research</p>
<p>and prior to getting a professorship.</p>
<p>My income went up slightly,</p>
<p>went up by about 30 to 40%,</p>
<p>but because of where I moved and because of the times,</p>
<p>my cost of living went way, way up</p>
<p>and I was extremely stressed.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t my absolute income,</p>
<p>it was my absolute income relative to my cost of living.</p>
<p>The other thing that one needs to consider</p>
<p>when considering income versus cost of living</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s also this notion of peer group.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk more about social bonds</p>
<p>and connections later.</p>
<p>But one thing that I noticed</p>
<p>when I moved from being a graduate student to a postdoc</p>
<p>was I was a graduate student in a small town</p>
<p>where I had access, if I chose,</p>
<p>to participate in most, if not all of the social gatherings</p>
<p>because they were all very low cost.</p>
<p>People tended to aggregate</p>
<p>at the farmer&rsquo;s market on Saturday.</p>
<p>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t even purchase anything,</p>
<p>at least not the graduate students</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t purchase anything.</p>
<p>It was just a place to aggregate.</p>
<p>People would sometimes play pickup games of soccer</p>
<p>or just hang out and have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>There was a volleyball game on Fridays.</p>
<p>Sometimes people would go out to eat that evening,</p>
<p>which of course costs money, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it was relatively low cost of living</p>
<p>and social connections and peer group interactions</p>
<p>were all generated around</p>
<p>the same fairly low cost activities.</p>
<p>When I transitioned to being a postdoc,</p>
<p>I made more money, but cost of living went up.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>my peer group tended to want to engage</p>
<p>in the same kinds of activities</p>
<p>that people in that larger city were engaged in.</p>
<p>So peer group has a tremendously powerful influence</p>
<p>on whether or not we gauge the amount of money that we have</p>
<p>as bringing us happiness or not.</p>
<p>And that really speaks to the critical importance</p>
<p>of social interactions</p>
<p>and certain kinds of social interactions in particular.</p>
<p>Now, if any of that was unclear,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m basically saying is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about being able to pay your rent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about being able to access</p>
<p>the kinds of social interactions</p>
<p>that you deem are quote unquote correct for you</p>
<p>at that stage of life</p>
<p>and in the place where you happen to be living.</p>
<p>Because if you can meet all the demands of costs of rent</p>
<p>and paying your power bill and food, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you are socially isolated because your peer group</p>
<p>or those around you that you want to engage with</p>
<p>are engaging in activities</p>
<p>that you either don&rsquo;t have time for, literally,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing other things,</p>
<p>or that you don&rsquo;t have the financial resources for,</p>
<p>then that can actually severely impact</p>
<p>this rating of what we call happiness.</p>
<p>Why am I parsing this so finely?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m parsing it finally because I think that</p>
<p>most of us have heard the outcome of this study from Harvard</p>
<p>or the more short-term studies,</p>
<p>also many of which are from Harvard.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the just phenomenal work</p>
<p>from Dan Gilbert&rsquo;s laboratory and other laboratories</p>
<p>who have focused on issues like these.</p>
<p>And I certainly don&rsquo;t want to take anything away</p>
<p>from those results.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very powerful and important results</p>
<p>that really point over and over to the fact that</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s happiness does not necessarily scale with income.</p>
<p>In fact, it tends not to past a certain level.</p>
<p>And yet I think we&rsquo;d be remiss,</p>
<p>I think actually it would be inappropriate for me to say</p>
<p>that the amount of income that one makes is not important</p>
<p>because if the amount of money that you happen to have</p>
<p>or are making does not allow you to meet your basic needs</p>
<p>of shelter, healthcare, et cetera,</p>
<p>and or doesn&rsquo;t allow you to access</p>
<p>the kind of social interactions that can renew and reset,</p>
<p>or I would say directly enhance</p>
<p>the kind of neurotransmitter systems and hormones</p>
<p>that lead us to feel that we are happy in our life</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re having quality social connections.</p>
<p>Well, then that&rsquo;s very stressful.</p>
<p>And this brings me back to the statement I made earlier,</p>
<p>which is indeed money cannot buy happiness,</p>
<p>but it certainly can buffer stress.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that it buffers stress</p>
<p>is by allowing options of different kinds</p>
<p>of social interactions,</p>
<p>options of different types of recreation</p>
<p>that one can engage in to access</p>
<p>new forms of social interaction.</p>
<p>And so on and so on.</p>
<p>So we need to be a little bit careful</p>
<p>or at least nuanced about this statement</p>
<p>that money can&rsquo;t buy happiness</p>
<p>and that the data support the fact</p>
<p>that wealth doesn&rsquo;t determine happiness.</p>
<p>I think there is a truth to that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another side to that</p>
<p>that I think is less often acknowledged</p>
<p>and that certainly I&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>and that I think many of you out there</p>
<p>have probably experienced as well.</p>
<p>One other major finding</p>
<p>of the Harvard Longitudinal Study on Happiness</p>
<p>as well as shorter term studies on happiness</p>
<p>is that much as you&rsquo;ve heard perhaps</p>
<p>that no one on their deathbed says</p>
<p>they wish they had worked more.</p>
<p>Well, indeed the total amount of time</p>
<p>that one spends working</p>
<p>does not seem to determine one&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>And yet I also want to earmark that result</p>
<p>as one that we need to parse a bit more carefully</p>
<p>because work, last time I checked,</p>
<p>and certainly for me,</p>
<p>is the way typically that people earn an income.</p>
<p>And as we just talked about a moment ago,</p>
<p>income is often a way that people have access to</p>
<p>or provide access for their family</p>
<p>to things like recreation</p>
<p>that opens up the opportunity for more social connection.</p>
<p>So we have to be careful</p>
<p>with how we interpret these blanket statements</p>
<p>that have become very popular</p>
<p>that money doesn&rsquo;t determine happiness</p>
<p>and that the amount that you work</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to determine happiness.</p>
<p>It certainly is the case</p>
<p>that if you earn more money from working more</p>
<p>and that money is devoted to things</p>
<p>that bring more opportunities for social connection</p>
<p>or for buffering stress in other areas of your life,</p>
<p>including healthcare, care for your children,</p>
<p>care for yourself, recreation,</p>
<p>other things that you enjoy,</p>
<p>well, then I think it&rsquo;s a little bit naive</p>
<p>to assume that work itself</p>
<p>is somehow counter to happiness,</p>
<p>which of course it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it especially isn&rsquo;t if we combine that feature of work</p>
<p>with another important feature of the human psyche,</p>
<p>which is this notion of meaning.</p>
<p>Now, in the not too distant future,</p>
<p>we will do an episode of this podcast on meaning</p>
<p>and what constitutes meaning in a given endeavor,</p>
<p>work or otherwise.</p>
<p>But much of the psychology of the last century</p>
<p>and still today focuses on this feature of meaning</p>
<p>as a critical one in terms of what makes us happy</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t make us happy.</p>
<p>Certainly in the longterm.</p>
<p>And I can certainly say for myself</p>
<p>that learning and teaching and doing research</p>
<p>in my laboratory brings me tremendous feeling</p>
<p>of meaning and happiness.</p>
<p>Some people consider their work</p>
<p>simply a way to gain a paycheck.</p>
<p>And other people find that they would do the very work</p>
<p>they do regardless of whether or not they were paid.</p>
<p>In fact, many people will do volunteer work</p>
<p>and other forms of work for zero money.</p>
<p>So this idea that money isn&rsquo;t important</p>
<p>or that work is not as important as we deem it to be,</p>
<p>that also needs to be considered</p>
<p>from a number of different perspectives.</p>
<p>And again, by no means am I trying to undermine</p>
<p>the data of these impressive studies,</p>
<p>both the longitudinal and short-term studies.</p>
<p>But I think we do have to be cautious</p>
<p>in our discussion of results like these</p>
<p>because the internet is replete with conversations</p>
<p>about the big factors that determine happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be social connection, not income.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the amount of time</p>
<p>that you are able to have open thinking and creativity,</p>
<p>which I think is an essential feature of happiness,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>Physical health, in particular,</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability to stay mobile</p>
<p>and to be able to access the kind of daily activities</p>
<p>that one needs to accomplish unassisted</p>
<p>is a strong correlate of happiness and so on and so on.</p>
<p>And of course, there are the basic physiology factors,</p>
<p>the things that feed back</p>
<p>onto our overall feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about these before,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll just put these quickly into a bin.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a toolkit of things</p>
<p>that you and everyone really should be constantly trying</p>
<p>to access, if not optimize on a regular basis</p>
<p>because they raise the tide or what I would call</p>
<p>the buoyancy of your overall system,</p>
<p>meaning your brain and body.</p>
<p>And that would be getting sufficient deep sleep</p>
<p>at least 80% of the nights of your life.</p>
<p>And ideally the remaining 20%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting deep sleep or as much of it</p>
<p>because of positive events.</p>
<p>Quality nutrition, quality social interactions.</p>
<p>And we will define that a little bit better.</p>
<p>In fact, we will define that in a lot of detail later</p>
<p>in this episode and actually how to get better</p>
<p>at creating quality social interactions,</p>
<p>even very brief social interactions.</p>
<p>So we have sleep, we have nutrition,</p>
<p>we have social interactions, we have purposeful work,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s paid work or non-paid work.</p>
<p>And of course there are things like exercise</p>
<p>and maybe relationships to pets and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And there are a few others as well.</p>
<p>All of those are known to increase your overall state</p>
<p>of wellbeing that puts you in a position</p>
<p>to access more meaning and happiness, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for most people, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that earning a living and earning a living by working</p>
<p>is the typical way in which we spend most of our time.</p>
<p>So I think we need to put a special bracket</p>
<p>around those activities.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something we will return to a little bit later</p>
<p>in terms of trying to understand how periods of life</p>
<p>in which there are big or extensive work demands</p>
<p>or extensive family demands on us are indeed compatible</p>
<p>with states of happiness or frequent states of happiness</p>
<p>and how better to access those</p>
<p>rather than simply say money isn&rsquo;t important</p>
<p>or the amount of time at work really isn&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what people are going to pay attention to.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t know how I will feel in my deathbed.</p>
<p>How could I?</p>
<p>Human beings are pretty good about understanding</p>
<p>how they feel in the present.</p>
<p>If not describing it, they are pretty good at feeling it.</p>
<p>If they have any sense of internal state</p>
<p>that is interoception, you can have some idea</p>
<p>of how you feel in a moment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty good about describing our past feelings,</p>
<p>at least in broad contour.</p>
<p>But we are not very good at projecting</p>
<p>how we will feel in the future.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s a theme that&rsquo;s going to come up again</p>
<p>and again today.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what we do know on the basis</p>
<p>of really solid data are that certain aspects</p>
<p>of our wellbeing tend to change across our lifespan.</p>
<p>Now, lifespan is something that we need to consider</p>
<p>from also a bit of nuance</p>
<p>because humans are indeed living longer and longer.</p>
<p>And if we look at the data on happiness across the lifespan</p>
<p>dated maybe 30 or 40 years back, or even 20 years ago,</p>
<p>it is consistently described in that literature</p>
<p>as a so-called U-shaped function</p>
<p>where people in their 20s report being very, very happy.</p>
<p>But as time goes on and they acquire more responsibility,</p>
<p>so typically getting married and having children</p>
<p>in their mid to late 20s and 30s and into their 40s,</p>
<p>having more work demands, et cetera,</p>
<p>happiness tends to be rated lower and lower,</p>
<p>at least in those previous studies.</p>
<p>And then happiness tended to increase</p>
<p>as people approach their 50s and 60s</p>
<p>and they tended to retire and their work demands</p>
<p>were shed from them and they were able to enjoy</p>
<p>the small things of life,</p>
<p>despite the fact that in general, I would say,</p>
<p>almost always people&rsquo;s health is not as vigorous</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re 70 as it is when they&rsquo;re 20.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to that, of course,</p>
<p>and of course you can adjust the rate</p>
<p>of cognitive and physical decline,</p>
<p>but in general, people in their 20s feel more physically</p>
<p>and mentally vigorous than they do</p>
<p>in their 60s and 70s in general.</p>
<p>That U-shaped function that I just described</p>
<p>still holds true today, but of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been some major shifts to the general life stages</p>
<p>and when people undergo those life stages.</p>
<p>For instance, many people are getting married much later.</p>
<p>Many people are opting to not have children.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the data</p>
<p>on whether or not people have children or not</p>
<p>and how that relates to happiness,</p>
<p>everyone will tell you that their kids</p>
<p>are their greatest source of joy,</p>
<p>at least most people will tell you that,</p>
<p>and are a tremendous source of happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious, kids are delightful</p>
<p>and raising kids while hard is a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>If you look at the ratings of happiness</p>
<p>among people that elected to not have children</p>
<p>versus those that had,</p>
<p>most people who have children</p>
<p>report their overall levels of happiness</p>
<p>as lower than that of people who opt not to have children.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of ways to interpret those findings</p>
<p>and by no means am I encouraging people to not have children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a issue that you have to resolve</p>
<p>for yourself, of course.</p>
<p>But we could imagine, for instance,</p>
<p>that people who opt not to have children</p>
<p>have more income to devote</p>
<p>to things more focused on themselves or their partner</p>
<p>or other aspects of their life.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the underlying reason.</p>
<p>We could perhaps conclude</p>
<p>that people who opt not to have children</p>
<p>are getting more sleep on a regular basis</p>
<p>or have more time for exercise</p>
<p>or the other sorts of things</p>
<p>that elevate states of mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Again, we do not know what the underlying reasons are</p>
<p>for this finding,</p>
<p>but it does seem that despite most every parent</p>
<p>reporting that their kids are their greatest source of joy</p>
<p>and quote-unquote happiness in life,</p>
<p>that people who opt not to have children</p>
<p>are at least as happy or report being at least as happy</p>
<p>or even happier than those that opt to have children.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to be very clear</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not trying to settle any arguments</p>
<p>about whether or not people should have children or not.</p>
<p>I happen to find children and animals delightful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always happy when people opt to have children</p>
<p>provided they are taking good care of their children</p>
<p>or doing their very best</p>
<p>to take good care of their children.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my stance.</p>
<p>But of course, you&rsquo;re all entitled</p>
<p>to your own stance on this.</p>
<p>There are also the general arguments</p>
<p>that people like to have</p>
<p>about whether or not the population of the earth</p>
<p>will be sustained or not sustained</p>
<p>based on current birth rates, et cetera.</p>
<p>Indeed, many areas of the world birth rates are going down,</p>
<p>is actually something that just as a perhaps point</p>
<p>of interest has been studied from the somewhat unusual</p>
<p>but logical perspective of whether or not child diapers</p>
<p>are selling at the same rate as they were some years ago</p>
<p>and whether or not adult diapers for the elderly</p>
<p>are being sold at the same rate or greater.</p>
<p>If you think about it is one indirect measure</p>
<p>of whether or not people are living longer</p>
<p>and or opting to have children.</p>
<p>Definitely a discussion for another time,</p>
<p>probably for another podcast entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day is that it gets me</p>
<p>the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So this U-shaped function of people being happier earlier</p>
<p>in life and then reporting feeling far less happy</p>
<p>and then happiness returning to them,</p>
<p>that is the rising of the U again in their later years</p>
<p>is something that I do believe should be repeated</p>
<p>in modern times and repeated in a way that takes</p>
<p>into account that that U might be shifted to the right.</p>
<p>That is, I am certainly aware that people are tending</p>
<p>to get married later, many are opting to not have children.</p>
<p>So for instance, the question arises whether or not</p>
<p>that U-shaped curve should have a bump down at the bottom</p>
<p>of the U among those that opt not to have children</p>
<p>because the argument was made in the discussion</p>
<p>of those papers that the reason why happiness is lower</p>
<p>when people are in their 30s, 40s and 50s</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re devoting more time</p>
<p>to raising their children and devoting more time to work.</p>
<p>I would hope people would enjoy their work</p>
<p>but not everybody really enjoys their work</p>
<p>and many people, even if they do enjoy their work</p>
<p>and they find meaning in it, still find it stressful</p>
<p>which certainly can run counter to happiness.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you could imagine that because a number of people</p>
<p>are opting perhaps to work less or to not have children</p>
<p>or both, where they find tremendous meaning from their work</p>
<p>that there would be a bump at the bottom of that U</p>
<p>among those that decided to simply not take on</p>
<p>these additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>That would be an interesting test, I think,</p>
<p>of whether or not the total load of responsibility</p>
<p>is really what&rsquo;s correlating with reported happiness or not.</p>
<p>Now, one very consistent finding</p>
<p>that has absolutely stood the test of time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a pop psychology finding</p>
<p>but I think it points to something interesting</p>
<p>that we will return to again and again</p>
<p>is that people tend to report feeling</p>
<p>lower levels of happiness, believe it or not,</p>
<p>on their birthday and the argument for why this is,</p>
<p>is the following, that typically we go through our year</p>
<p>not comparing ourselves to our peers terribly much.</p>
<p>We might do that a little bit more</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in elementary school, high school, et cetera,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re sort of age match, maybe even college as well</p>
<p>but an evaluation of ourselves to our age match peers</p>
<p>is not typically something that we do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Whereas on our birthday, we get a snapshot</p>
<p>of where we are in the arc of time or at least in our life</p>
<p>and many people report feeling rather low on their birthday</p>
<p>because they use that as a benchmark or a window</p>
<p>into the things that they have not accomplished,</p>
<p>the things that despite being age blank,</p>
<p>they still haven&rsquo;t accomplished.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because of what it really points to is two things.</p>
<p>One, the extent to which much of our feelings of happiness</p>
<p>are relative, in particular relative to our peers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that social aspect again</p>
<p>and the fact that most of the time,</p>
<p>we are not very good at orienting ourselves</p>
<p>in the longer arc of time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty good at knowing where we are</p>
<p>in the arc of a day or the arc of a week</p>
<p>or the arc of a month or even a year</p>
<p>but that most of us are not very good at reflecting</p>
<p>on where we are in our life arc.</p>
<p>And of course, most of us don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how long we will live anyway</p>
<p>but we do have some general sense.</p>
<p>I mean, very few people live past the age of 100.</p>
<p>Many people live to be 70 or 80</p>
<p>and again, lifespan is extending as far as we know</p>
<p>from year to year.</p>
<p>But in general, people report that on their birthdays</p>
<p>and I should say these are for birthdays aged 25 or later,</p>
<p>at least in the studies I was able to access, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that a lot of three-year-olds sit around</p>
<p>comparing themselves to other three-year-olds</p>
<p>and how well they&rsquo;re doing or 12-year-olds.</p>
<p>You can imagine some people might do that at 18, et cetera</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really by the mid 20s</p>
<p>that people start evaluating themselves to their peers</p>
<p>in terms of life progression and so-called milestones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been argued that that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why people report lower affect,</p>
<p>lower levels of happiness on their birthday,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a little bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>And of course, there are things</p>
<p>that are anti-correlated with happiness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention a few of these.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s longitudinal study,</p>
<p>the Harvard Happiness Project has reported for instance,</p>
<p>that people that are chronic smokers of nicotine</p>
<p>and chronic consumers of alcohol,</p>
<p>in particular alcoholics,</p>
<p>that is people who suffer from alcoholism</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s sometimes called alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>that is strongly anti-correlated with happiness.</p>
<p>And I should also mention that the family members</p>
<p>and in particular the romantic partners of people</p>
<p>who are chronic smokers</p>
<p>and the partners of people who are chronic alcohol users</p>
<p>often will report lower levels of happiness,</p>
<p>especially if they themselves are not chronic smokers</p>
<p>or regular consumers of alcohol.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done episodes on nicotine in particular</p>
<p>and that touched on smoking of course,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done an episode on alcohol</p>
<p>and the effects of alcohol on health.</p>
<p>Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>This study from the Harvard Happiness Project</p>
<p>really has strong data supporting the fact</p>
<p>that avoiding being a nicotine smoker, right?</p>
<p>There are positive health effects of nicotine</p>
<p>that are discussed in the episode on nicotine,</p>
<p>but smoking nicotine in particular</p>
<p>is counterproductive for people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at least self-reported happiness</p>
<p>and certainly overall health.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s zero question</p>
<p>that smoking increases cancers over different kinds</p>
<p>and that alcohol consumption</p>
<p>in particular alcohol consumption</p>
<p>beyond two drinks per week,</p>
<p>two drinks being the typical volume of a beer,</p>
<p>a glass of wine or a cocktail, et cetera,</p>
<p>is detrimental for various aspects of health.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other things</p>
<p>that you could imagine would relate to a lack of happiness.</p>
<p>For instance, a major trauma,</p>
<p>physical or emotional trauma.</p>
<p>That could include the loss of a major relationship,</p>
<p>a death of a close one,</p>
<p>being the victim of a violent crime</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s been argued, in fact, strongly argued</p>
<p>that when you look at people&rsquo;s levels of happiness</p>
<p>after a trauma, that if you wait about a year or so,</p>
<p>sometimes even as short as three months after a trauma,</p>
<p>that people&rsquo;s self-reported levels of happiness</p>
<p>are not significantly lower</p>
<p>than they were prior to the trauma.</p>
<p>Now, I very much want to highlight, underline and bold</p>
<p>and asterisk that statement</p>
<p>as one that we really need to explore carefully</p>
<p>because there are other data</p>
<p>that strongly point to the fact</p>
<p>that major life traumas can severely disrupt</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s sense of happiness and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And I think as long as we&rsquo;re going to have this discussion,</p>
<p>we should point to a useful definition of trauma.</p>
<p>And the definition that I&rsquo;ll paraphrase</p>
<p>is one that was supplied by a former guest</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conte,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a psychiatrist who&rsquo;s written a book called Trauma.</p>
<p>I personally think it&rsquo;s the best book on trauma</p>
<p>and tools for alleviating trauma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly thorough, easy to read and well-informed.</p>
<p>And here again, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>but Dr. Conte describes trauma</p>
<p>as something that fundamentally changes</p>
<p>the way that our brain and body function</p>
<p>in a way that makes other aspects</p>
<p>of living more challenging.</p>
<p>Again, an event either emotional or physical or both</p>
<p>that fundamentally changes the way that our brain</p>
<p>and our body, our nervous system and other organs function</p>
<p>in a way that prevents us from enjoying daily activities.</p>
<p>And that could even be ongoing distraction, right?</p>
<p>Traumas can create rumination</p>
<p>or they can create obsessive thought</p>
<p>or they can create dissociation,</p>
<p>any number of different things.</p>
<p>Again, check out that episode with Dr. Paul Conte</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about trauma</p>
<p>and how it manifests.</p>
<p>But the idea that&rsquo;s been put forth</p>
<p>by a number of researchers in the field of happiness</p>
<p>that three months after a major trauma</p>
<p>and people aren&rsquo;t reporting that they are feeling</p>
<p>any less happy than before the trauma,</p>
<p>that was surprising to me.</p>
<p>So I went into this literature a bit more deeply.</p>
<p>One of the basis of that general line of thinking</p>
<p>is what I consider now classic and very important</p>
<p>and frankly excellent talk that was given</p>
<p>by Professor Dan Gilbert on the science of happiness.</p>
<p>You can find this on YouTube.</p>
<p>I say a classic one because it was done some years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s received millions of views.</p>
<p>And one of the points that he makes in that talk,</p>
<p>which is grounded in research carried out by his laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories is that he poses a question.</p>
<p>He says, you know, let&rsquo;s do a quiz.</p>
<p>Would you rather be someone who wins the lottery?</p>
<p>And he shows a picture of somebody who just won,</p>
<p>I think it was several hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>in the lottery or was recently made paraplegic,</p>
<p>lost use of their legs.</p>
<p>And then goes on to state that one year</p>
<p>after people have won the lottery,</p>
<p>this major, you know, monetary windfall</p>
<p>versus have become paraplegic</p>
<p>is that their self-reported levels of happiness</p>
<p>are the same, which I think is incredibly surprising.</p>
<p>Now I heard this and I immediately thought</p>
<p>of an experience that I&rsquo;ve had where I teach a course</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine on neural regeneration.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually a course that I attended some years ago</p>
<p>when I was a postdoc at Stanford.</p>
<p>So well over a decade ago.</p>
<p>And we had, excuse me,</p>
<p>we had an individual come into the course.</p>
<p>This was an older gentleman.</p>
<p>So older meaning he was in his early seventies</p>
<p>and he had become paraplegic fairly late in life</p>
<p>from a cycling accident.</p>
<p>And he was and is an expert in what it is</p>
<p>to become a paraplegic, of course,</p>
<p>because he had that experience,</p>
<p>but also because he spends a lot of his time</p>
<p>doing volunteer work with people who have become paraplegic</p>
<p>and have become paraplegic at different ages.</p>
<p>And what he described to me was that the overall outcomes</p>
<p>for people that are rendered paraplegic</p>
<p>in terms of their mental health</p>
<p>and their physical wellbeing,</p>
<p>their sort of management of general life skills</p>
<p>scales with how early they had that injury</p>
<p>and how long they had the use of their limbs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not straightforward.</p>
<p>When I heard this result described by Dr. Dan Gilbert</p>
<p>that winning the lottery and becoming paraplegic</p>
<p>basically don&rsquo;t impact your levels of happiness</p>
<p>to any different degree.</p>
<p>When people look back a year later,</p>
<p>I was pretty surprised given my experience</p>
<p>of hearing this lecture at Stanford.</p>
<p>So I thought, wow, from what I understand,</p>
<p>indeed there are people who are rendered paraplegic</p>
<p>and manage that transition very easily.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to disrupt their feelings</p>
<p>of wellbeing, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for other people, it can be severely disrupting</p>
<p>to their sense of wellbeing and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I went back and examined these data.</p>
<p>And in fact, a subsequent talk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a podcast that was given</p>
<p>by Dr. Dan Gilbert some years later.</p>
<p>So this would be just a few years ago.</p>
<p>I think 2019 is a specific date in which it was recorded,</p>
<p>but just a few years ago.</p>
<p>And indeed he corrects himself in that podcast.</p>
<p>What he says is that he misspoke in that earlier talk</p>
<p>that the difference in self-reported levels of happiness</p>
<p>for those that have been rendered paraplegic</p>
<p>versus those who&rsquo;ve won the lottery</p>
<p>is not as great as one would expect.</p>
<p>I think most people would expect</p>
<p>that being rendered paraplegic</p>
<p>would make people far less happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the expectation, I think, anyway.</p>
<p>And that people who would win the lottery,</p>
<p>at least for some period of time,</p>
<p>would be far happier than they were</p>
<p>prior to winning the lottery,</p>
<p>especially given the tremendous amount of money.</p>
<p>And again, the fact that money can&rsquo;t buy happiness,</p>
<p>but that money does indeed enable the ability</p>
<p>to buffer stress provided people</p>
<p>were responsible with that money</p>
<p>and just didn&rsquo;t blow it or spend it all right away,</p>
<p>that they could start to afford things</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t afford,</p>
<p>not just in terms of luxury items,</p>
<p>but also the ability to hire help that would free up time,</p>
<p>that would allow them to do anything</p>
<p>from travel that they couldn&rsquo;t access before to meditate,</p>
<p>if that was something that they didn&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to do before and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So the result, quote unquote,</p>
<p>that winners of the lottery and recent paraplegics</p>
<p>have the same levels of happiness is actually not true,</p>
<p>at least according to the author of the original study.</p>
<p>Now, what he did not point to</p>
<p>is the degree to which that is not true,</p>
<p>but he did point to the direction of the result</p>
<p>and the fact that people who are rendered paraplegic,</p>
<p>in fact, are reporting themselves</p>
<p>as less happy than they were prior to their injury.</p>
<p>And certainly that their levels of happiness</p>
<p>are lower than those that simply won the lottery,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of dollars,</p>
<p>which I think is the more intuitive result.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s important to be aware</p>
<p>of that discrepancy because it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that was lost in the communication</p>
<p>around those results the first time around.</p>
<p>And indeed, Dan Gilbert is an excellent scientist</p>
<p>and was quite good about trying to correct the narrative.</p>
<p>I, myself, as a podcaster</p>
<p>who puts information on the internet,</p>
<p>know that the challenges of correcting narratives,</p>
<p>especially of things that came out some time ago,</p>
<p>we always attempt to do this as best we can,</p>
<p>but not everyone that saw that first video</p>
<p>will necessarily hear the discussion</p>
<p>that happens subsequently.</p>
<p>So my hope is that Dr. Gilbert will interpret</p>
<p>me communicating this now,</p>
<p>not as an attempt to criticize him,</p>
<p>but rather as an attempt to praise his willingness</p>
<p>to try and correct the narrative to be more accurate.</p>
<p>So to be very clear about what this study did and didn&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>and here, I&rsquo;m going to combine these results</p>
<p>with other studies that I was able to find</p>
<p>that explored similar phenomenon.</p>
<p>So a major trauma, for instance,</p>
<p>not necessarily becoming paraplegic,</p>
<p>but traumas of a different sort, emotional traumas.</p>
<p>When you look at the whole of those data,</p>
<p>at least my read is that when people win the lottery</p>
<p>or acquire wealth through inheritance,</p>
<p>some form of wealth acquisition that is sudden</p>
<p>and that wasn&rsquo;t preceded by a specific effort</p>
<p>to gain that wealth, right?</p>
<p>Buying a lottery ticket is a pretty quick thing.</p>
<p>Inheritance is something that you simply get</p>
<p>by virtue of who you are, not necessarily by effort.</p>
<p>Well, that led to increases in self-reported happiness</p>
<p>compared to prior to the inheritance of the lottery win,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t as substantial as you might imagine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re approaching the notion of happiness</p>
<p>simply from, well, more money equals more happiness.</p>
<p>And while it is true that people</p>
<p>who are rendered paraplegic or who undergo</p>
<p>psychological traumas or physical traumas</p>
<p>of any various kind are, and frankly,</p>
<p>are remarkably resilient in many cases.</p>
<p>They can still manage to go about life and work</p>
<p>and engage in relationships, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is a visible decrease in overall levels</p>
<p>of happiness and wellbeing, in particular,</p>
<p>if the psychological and physical trauma</p>
<p>renders their nervous system different in a way</p>
<p>that impacts other major areas of life</p>
<p>and enjoyment for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly true one year out from the trauma.</p>
<p>So the point is that we do need to reframe this idea</p>
<p>that whether or not you win the lottery</p>
<p>or become paraplegic or suffer some major trauma,</p>
<p>your levels of happiness are going to be the same</p>
<p>three months or a year later.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>And in fact, Dr. Dan Gilbert emphasized</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not accurate even in that initial study.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s an important thing to frame</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such a popular notion</p>
<p>or that that idea combined with the idea</p>
<p>that increased earnings don&rsquo;t make us happy</p>
<p>combined with the idea that we are happy earlier in life,</p>
<p>but then as more demands arise in life,</p>
<p>we become less happy and then we become happy again.</p>
<p>And that idea as we already explored</p>
<p>is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>Frankly, I knew a lot of teenagers</p>
<p>and people in their early 20s are pretty unhappy</p>
<p>who then become happier later</p>
<p>as they acquire more resources.</p>
<p>Sometimes distance, let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>sometimes distance from our family of origin</p>
<p>makes us more happy, sometimes less so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>So I think those general themes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve heard over and over,</p>
<p>while they have merit and they certainly stand up</p>
<p>in some of the more powerful longitudinal</p>
<p>and short-term studies, there is nuance.</p>
<p>And in some cases, there are now additional data</p>
<p>that are causing us to revise those understandings.</p>
<p>Now there is an important point,</p>
<p>or I should say the important point</p>
<p>that we can really credit Dan Gilbert</p>
<p>and others in the field of psychology with,</p>
<p>and that we owe them a great debt of gratitude for,</p>
<p>is that we do have far more control</p>
<p>over our levels of happiness than we might think.</p>
<p>And many of the things that reside</p>
<p>at that level of control,</p>
<p>that is the things that we can do and think</p>
<p>and say and access don&rsquo;t come from external things, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t come necessarily</p>
<p>from the acquisition of material goods,</p>
<p>but rather there are things that we can do</p>
<p>that can allow us to so-called synthesize happiness.</p>
<p>And I think this is one of the great gifts</p>
<p>of modern psychology is that Dan Gilbert</p>
<p>and others, the Harvard Happiness Project,</p>
<p>work at Yale and elsewhere, right?</p>
<p>There are excellent labs working on happiness</p>
<p>all over the US and all over the world, frankly.</p>
<p>One of the great gifts that they&rsquo;ve supplied us</p>
<p>in the form of data is that there really are things</p>
<p>that we can all do and think and access</p>
<p>to allow ourselves to so-called synthesize happiness.</p>
<p>Now this notion of synthesizing happiness</p>
<p>or synthetic happiness as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>can sometimes ruffle people&rsquo;s feathers a bit</p>
<p>because people immediately flip to the idea that,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re just going to tell me to be grateful</p>
<p>for what I have or to just navel gaze</p>
<p>or just to imagine that I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really not what synthetic happiness</p>
<p>is about at all.</p>
<p>Synthetic happiness actually has to do</p>
<p>with some really important larger principles</p>
<p>about the way that our emotional system</p>
<p>and the way that the reward systems</p>
<p>of our brain really function.</p>
<p>And they point to important concepts</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to now discuss,</p>
<p>things like the hedonic set point, for instance,</p>
<p>or the dopamine system of anticipation of rewards</p>
<p>versus receiving rewards.</p>
<p>Just as a brief insight into that,</p>
<p>our anticipation of something positive oftentimes</p>
<p>leads to greater increases in the sorts of neurochemicals</p>
<p>that support a state of happiness and wellbeing</p>
<p>than the actual acquisition of the thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to obtain.</p>
<p>And this goes back to a theme I&rsquo;ve discussed</p>
<p>a few times before on this podcast,</p>
<p>in particular with my colleague</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lemke,</p>
<p>who wrote the fabulous book, Dopamine Nation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in dopamine and addiction</p>
<p>in particular, that&rsquo;s a wonderful, clear,</p>
<p>and extremely informative read.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in dopamine more generally,</p>
<p>just not just in the states of addiction,</p>
<p>but in everyday life and in pursuit and motivation,</p>
<p>The Molecule of More is an excellent book related to that.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we have this episode on dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>The notion of synthetic happiness</p>
<p>is not simply about imagining happiness</p>
<p>or thinking about happiness or anticipating happiness.</p>
<p>To some extent it is,</p>
<p>but it relates to a number of other important themes,</p>
<p>but it is grounded very thoroughly</p>
<p>in the neurobiology of dopamine rewards.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about some of that neurobiology</p>
<p>in a few moments.</p>
<p>But I want to take a couple of minutes</p>
<p>and talk about what synthetic happiness is</p>
<p>and what some of the conditions are</p>
<p>for allowing us to access the state</p>
<p>of so-called synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And I want to point out at the outset</p>
<p>that synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>while it might sound synthetic, AKA false,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anything but.</p>
<p>It actually turns out to be among the more</p>
<p>and perhaps the more potent form of happiness</p>
<p>that we can all access.</p>
<p>And this is where themes related to our control</p>
<p>over our own internal state</p>
<p>really become not only valid, but very powerful.</p>
<p>So for instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert and others</p>
<p>have explored how opportunity and choice,</p>
<p>that is freedom, can and can&rsquo;t lead to states of happiness.</p>
<p>And the results of those studies are very solid</p>
<p>and frankly, very surprising</p>
<p>until you understand the results.</p>
<p>And once you do,</p>
<p>I think you will immediately see areas of your own life</p>
<p>that you can start to access more happiness,</p>
<p>again, genuine happiness,</p>
<p>simply by framing certain choices in a particular way,</p>
<p>and maybe even by eliminating choices.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to focus on the research</p>
<p>aimed at understanding what increases</p>
<p>our levels of happiness.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to frame this under the umbrella</p>
<p>of two major themes.</p>
<p>The first theme is so-called natural happiness.</p>
<p>Natural happiness is the sort of happiness</p>
<p>that most of us are familiar with.</p>
<p>So the kind of happiness that we expect to have</p>
<p>if we, for instance, complete a degree,</p>
<p>hopefully a degree in a topic meaningful</p>
<p>and interesting to us, but a degree nonetheless,</p>
<p>or we find a mate,</p>
<p>hopefully a mate that we enjoy spending time with,</p>
<p>or for instance, making a certain income</p>
<p>or finding work that we enjoy on a regular basis.</p>
<p>All of those are forms of happiness</p>
<p>that from a very early time in development,</p>
<p>we are taught exist.</p>
<p>For instance, even when we are very young,</p>
<p>we are told that our birthday is coming</p>
<p>and that we are going to get presents</p>
<p>and those presents are going to be focused on</p>
<p>knowledge of things that we already enjoy.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a little kid and you like trucks</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a little kid and you like dolls,</p>
<p>you can sort of expect that those gifts</p>
<p>will bring you some level of joy or happiness.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s a small child example,</p>
<p>that general notion of natural happiness</p>
<p>is of course, one that persists into adolescence,</p>
<p>into young adulthood and into adulthood.</p>
<p>And we quite understandably come to associate</p>
<p>this feeling of joy or happiness</p>
<p>with the receiving of things or the acquisition of things,</p>
<p>whether by effort, by gift, by inheritance</p>
<p>or some other form.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s natural happiness.</p>
<p>And yet, as I mentioned a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also this notion of synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And some of the more interesting and exciting research</p>
<p>in the fields of psychology and in fact, neuroscience</p>
<p>point to this idea of synthetic happiness</p>
<p>as at least as powerful a source of happiness</p>
<p>as natural happiness.</p>
<p>Again, at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful.</p>
<p>And of course, one has to take a slightly different view</p>
<p>of what happiness is in order to accept this idea</p>
<p>that we can create happiness for ourselves.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the whole notion</p>
<p>of synthetic happiness is merely a passive one,</p>
<p>where all we do is sit back and imagine being happy</p>
<p>and then we are happy.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, our nervous systems</p>
<p>and our neurochemistry simply don&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>In fact, synthetic happiness has almost always</p>
<p>been understood as something that we have to put</p>
<p>some effort toward achieving.</p>
<p>But, and this is an important thing to point out,</p>
<p>synthetic happiness also requires that certain situational</p>
<p>or environmental conditions be met.</p>
<p>A good example of this is some of the work</p>
<p>by Jillian Mandich, or I should say, Dr. Jillian Mandich,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done some interesting work on the conditions</p>
<p>for creating happiness within our mind</p>
<p>and in our overall state of being.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s been involved in a number of different studies,</p>
<p>but one of the ones that I found particularly interesting</p>
<p>is one in which they explored different types of music</p>
<p>and other aspects of environmental settings.</p>
<p>So you bring subjects to the laboratory,</p>
<p>play them different types of music.</p>
<p>There are, in fact, certain aspects of music</p>
<p>that can create different states of mind,</p>
<p>sadness, happiness, anticipation.</p>
<p>In fact, there are certain patterns of music</p>
<p>that can reliably induce anticipation of the fear</p>
<p>and anxiety-based type.</p>
<p>So for instance, think the movie, Jaws.</p>
<p>If you recall, for those of you that have seen Jaws,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this ongoing theme music</p>
<p>anytime the shark might be present in the water</p>
<p>or in a given scene that essentially goes,</p>
<p>dun-dun, dun-dun.</p>
<p>Now, for the musicians out there,</p>
<p>this has basis in things like tritones</p>
<p>and things that are understood from the mathematics</p>
<p>and the musical side.</p>
<p>And from the neuroscience side,</p>
<p>are known to create a neural state of anticipation.</p>
<p>Yeah, a neural state of anticipation</p>
<p>and not necessarily a positive one.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are other patterns of music</p>
<p>that involve uptones.</p>
<p>Think some of the music that&rsquo;s typically been used</p>
<p>in cartoons of various sorts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long history of this.</p>
<p>Indeed, there&rsquo;s a whole literature of psychological</p>
<p>and now even a smaller but still interesting literature</p>
<p>on the neuroscience of how certain patterns of music</p>
<p>can induce a state of joy</p>
<p>and joyful anticipation in particular.</p>
<p>A lot of those patterns of music are incorporated</p>
<p>into so-called happy cartoons and Disney movies</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>In any case, Dr. Mandich and others have explored</p>
<p>how music in particular,</p>
<p>but other features of the environment</p>
<p>can or cannot induce states of happiness.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway from those studies</p>
<p>is that while having a certain environmental sound,</p>
<p>musical tone, or visual feature to a given space, a room,</p>
<p>is necessary for a state of happiness,</p>
<p>it is not alone sufficient.</p>
<p>What is required is that individuals</p>
<p>not only be placed into an environment</p>
<p>that contains music or visual items</p>
<p>or a combination of music and visual items</p>
<p>that can induce states of joy or happiness</p>
<p>or positive anticipation,</p>
<p>but that they also are given some sort of instruction</p>
<p>or instruction manual as to how to synthesize happiness</p>
<p>inside of that environment.</p>
<p>This is important because what this says</p>
<p>is that our ability to create states of happiness</p>
<p>is dependent on our environment,</p>
<p>but also requires effort from us.</p>
<p>That also makes sense as to why</p>
<p>when we are under conditions of deprivation,</p>
<p>so it could be social deprivation or financial deprivation,</p>
<p>or even for people that are very sensitive to weather,</p>
<p>you know, there are a certain number of individuals,</p>
<p>about 30% of people who report feeling very, very low</p>
<p>under conditions where the sky is overcast,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s been overcast for a number of days,</p>
<p>the so-called seasonal affective depression.</p>
<p>Those individuals, by the way,</p>
<p>can often receive tremendous benefits</p>
<p>in terms of elevating their mood</p>
<p>if they make an effort to get sunlight</p>
<p>and if they can&rsquo;t get sunlight, artificial light</p>
<p>of the sort that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>But in any case, there are a number of people</p>
<p>that are profoundly negatively influenced</p>
<p>by the lack of positive visual and auditory cues</p>
<p>in their environment.</p>
<p>But for most people, we are in a,</p>
<p>what I would call a dynamic relationship</p>
<p>with our environment.</p>
<p>Our environment has an effect on our mood,</p>
<p>but the research indicates that we also need to make</p>
<p>some sort of effort toward being happy.</p>
<p>Now, effort toward being happy is a very vague term,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s better define what that is.</p>
<p>In the case of Dr. Mandich&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>this took the form of doing so-called happiness inventories,</p>
<p>right, that can be focusing on things</p>
<p>that one is grateful for,</p>
<p>things that they particularly enjoy.</p>
<p>This is somewhat of a gratitude type practice,</p>
<p>but includes some other features as well</p>
<p>that are more focused on the things that bring you meaning</p>
<p>and actually engaging in the things that bring you meaning.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to think about</p>
<p>how to improve your levels of happiness,</p>
<p>what this research essentially says is</p>
<p>that you would be smart to try</p>
<p>and adjust your home environment,</p>
<p>adjust your work environment so that it is cheerful to you.</p>
<p>Maybe that means a plant.</p>
<p>For me in my laboratory,</p>
<p>one of the things that was really critical</p>
<p>that I had as a postdoc and in my own laboratory</p>
<p>when I first started my lab was I love aquaria,</p>
<p>so I had multiple fish tanks.</p>
<p>In fact, people in my laboratory</p>
<p>were always rolling their eyes,</p>
<p>why do we have to have all these fish tanks</p>
<p>with all these, I like freshwater tanks,</p>
<p>not saltwater tanks for reasons</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t interesting for this discussion,</p>
<p>but freshwater tanks with discus fish, for instance,</p>
<p>to me are just beautiful.</p>
<p>They make me happy.</p>
<p>I just enjoy them.</p>
<p>Music is a complicated thing in laboratories</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a shared space,</p>
<p>so headphones are the general requirement,</p>
<p>but having either silence, if you love silence,</p>
<p>and I happen to like working in silence</p>
<p>or listening to certain forms of music,</p>
<p>I do also use the 40 Hertz binaural beats,</p>
<p>or I particularly like listening to Glenn Gould</p>
<p>while I work or listening to whale song,</p>
<p>believe it or not, while I work,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have any structure that I can follow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak whale, and so I can&rsquo;t follow,</p>
<p>but it sort of fills the space in a way that I find pleasant</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve put substantial amounts of effort</p>
<p>into making my laboratory spaces and my office spaces,</p>
<p>my workspaces, nice places to be.</p>
<p>Now, I had no knowledge of this work from Dr. Mandich</p>
<p>and others at the time when I did that,</p>
<p>but what I found was that over the years,</p>
<p>I was challenged in maintaining a kind of elevated mood</p>
<p>while working in a laboratory,</p>
<p>not because I didn&rsquo;t thoroughly enjoy the work.</p>
<p>I love doing experiments with my hands</p>
<p>and I loved being in lab,</p>
<p>but at least the labs that I was in</p>
<p>as a graduate student and postdoc, there were no windows,</p>
<p>so I wasn&rsquo;t getting adequate sunshine.</p>
<p>The windows that we didn&rsquo;t have didn&rsquo;t open,</p>
<p>so I wasn&rsquo;t getting a lot of fresh air</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve personally found it very valuable</p>
<p>to create an environment both at work and at home</p>
<p>that I find aesthetically pleasant,</p>
<p>at least in some way or another.</p>
<p>And I realize people have varying levels of control</p>
<p>over their aesthetic environment.</p>
<p>Certainly the auditory environment can be controlled</p>
<p>nowadays through the use of headphones</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re allowed to use those.</p>
<p>So for instance, using music or using background sound</p>
<p>that you find very pleasant</p>
<p>combined with a concerted effort on your part</p>
<p>to create states of happiness</p>
<p>by hopefully doing work that&rsquo;s meaningful to you</p>
<p>or at least is leading to meaningful outcomes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about that.</p>
<p>But these happiness inventories also turn out</p>
<p>to be interesting and important sources</p>
<p>of creating so-called synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And we will also talk about other ways</p>
<p>that one can create elevated levels of synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And I realized the word synthetic</p>
<p>probably draws up connotations of false happiness</p>
<p>or contrived happiness.</p>
<p>I wish instead of calling it synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>they had called it a self-created</p>
<p>or self-directed happiness or something of that sort</p>
<p>because then it wouldn&rsquo;t sound as false</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s simply not false.</p>
<p>It leads to the same, as far as we know,</p>
<p>identical neurochemical and psychological states</p>
<p>of happiness as natural happiness</p>
<p>and might even be more persistent than natural happiness.</p>
<p>It certainly is more under our control.</p>
<p>But the key point is that environment</p>
<p>and self-directed work at being happy are both important</p>
<p>and they interact with one another.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who has a hard time</p>
<p>synthesizing happiness through any of the methods</p>
<p>that we talk about today,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t consider yourself deficient.</p>
<p>It could very well be that the environment that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>social environment or physical environment</p>
<p>or auditory environment is simply not conducive</p>
<p>to synthesizing happiness.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I think the work of Jillian Mandich</p>
<p>and colleagues and others in the field</p>
<p>is tremendously important because it removes us</p>
<p>from this pressure to just synthesize happiness</p>
<p>from within despite our circumstances.</p>
<p>I think many of us have heard of the incredible stories</p>
<p>of people like Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>who were stripped of their freedom</p>
<p>and yet managed to maintain some sense</p>
<p>of positive anticipation or at least some sense of identity</p>
<p>that allowed them to still access forms of happiness.</p>
<p>Those are highly unique situations, of course,</p>
<p>and they speak to the power of the human psyche</p>
<p>for synthesizing happiness</p>
<p>and certainly for synthesizing a sense</p>
<p>that there might be a future and to live into that future</p>
<p>in their cases, incredibly impressive ways.</p>
<p>But I think for most everybody,</p>
<p>the environment that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>has a powerful impact on our mood</p>
<p>and some people more than others.</p>
<p>I know people that are perfectly happy with blank walls,</p>
<p>no pictures on the walls.</p>
<p>Other people benefit tremendously from having photos</p>
<p>or plants in their environment.</p>
<p>You really have to determine what&rsquo;s needed for you</p>
<p>and do your best to try and place those things</p>
<p>into your environment,</p>
<p>or rather place yourself into an environment</p>
<p>that is conducive to you synthesizing your happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, the powerful interaction between our environment</p>
<p>and our own ability to generate certain kinds of emotions</p>
<p>is well-established, not just for happiness,</p>
<p>but for things like gratitude.</p>
<p>So for instance, there&rsquo;s a classic study from Ames,</p>
<p>A-M-E-S, in 2004 that was focused on gratitude.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had an episode on gratitude before.</p>
<p>The basic takeaway of that episode</p>
<p>is that it turns out receiving gratitude</p>
<p>is a more powerful stimulus for the release</p>
<p>of neurochemicals and activation of brain areas</p>
<p>associated with so-called pro-social behaviors</p>
<p>and feelings of wellbeing, including happiness.</p>
<p>But also observing stories in the form of movies or books</p>
<p>or other narratives of other people receiving help</p>
<p>is also a very powerful stimulus for gratitude.</p>
<p>Also, giving gratitude is very powerful,</p>
<p>but not as powerful as receiving gratitude,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s what the research says,</p>
<p>or observing powerful exchanges of gratitude</p>
<p>between other individuals.</p>
<p>What the study from Ames showed is that gratitude</p>
<p>as a state of mind and as an emotion</p>
<p>does not exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not independent of our surroundings.</p>
<p>So for instance, just writing down all the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re grateful for while it has some positive impact,</p>
<p>the impact of that or receiving gratitude</p>
<p>or observing gratitude is far more potent, right?</p>
<p>Bigger increases in happiness and feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>and indeed neurochemicals and activation of brain areas</p>
<p>associated with happiness and wellbeing</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a reciprocity,</p>
<p>when the person receiving understands something</p>
<p>about the person that&rsquo;s giving to them</p>
<p>and understands that the person is giving genuinely,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an environmental interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about receiving,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s receiving from somebody</p>
<p>that you know genuinely wants to give.</p>
<p>And likewise for the giver in that equation,</p>
<p>the feelings of wellbeing are far greater</p>
<p>when the person receiving whatever it is,</p>
<p>money, food, assistance in some form or another,</p>
<p>it could be physical assistance, et cetera.</p>
<p>When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it</p>
<p>genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving.</p>
<p>So the important finding within the research</p>
<p>again and again is that happiness doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially our own responsibility</p>
<p>to synthesize happiness.</p>
<p>Now, I was told that many times in your life,</p>
<p>happiness is in your head.</p>
<p>Well, yes, indeed it&rsquo;s in your head,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also dependent on interactions</p>
<p>with your environment,</p>
<p>physical environment and social environment and so on.</p>
<p>Likewise, gratitude is something</p>
<p>that we can create inside of us, right?</p>
<p>Through gratitude lists and appreciation,</p>
<p>or we can give both powerful sources</p>
<p>of evoking neurochemical changes</p>
<p>associated with gratitude and happiness and wellbeing,</p>
<p>but it too doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much greater positive effect</p>
<p>when we have knowledge about</p>
<p>why the giver is giving us something</p>
<p>or that the person receiving something</p>
<p>is going to benefit tremendously from receiving it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m highlighting this because I think that</p>
<p>when we hear about synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of automatic erasing of context</p>
<p>that tends to occur.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you were to peruse the various videos online</p>
<p>or papers that exist on PubMed</p>
<p>around happiness and synthetic happiness in particular,</p>
<p>you would come away with the impression</p>
<p>that synthetic happiness is just something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re supposed to snap our fingers and access,</p>
<p>or perhaps do very specific things and access.</p>
<p>But while that is true, context really matters.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important point,</p>
<p>much in the same way that the point needs to be made</p>
<p>that while money doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness,</p>
<p>money can buffer stress and certainly offer opportunities</p>
<p>that can provide opportunities for more happiness.</p>
<p>So I think we are starting to arrive</p>
<p>at a general theme here,</p>
<p>which is that nothing related to our mood</p>
<p>exists in isolation.</p>
<p>And in fact, that leads me to a discussion</p>
<p>of one of the major scientific findings</p>
<p>in the realm of what sorts of mindsets and behaviors</p>
<p>can in fact lead to happiness.</p>
<p>And this is a paper that was published in 2008.</p>
<p>And even though that might seem like a while ago,</p>
<p>it forms the basis for a large amount of literature</p>
<p>that followed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting literature.</p>
<p>This is work from Elizabeth Dunn and colleagues</p>
<p>and was published in the journal Science,</p>
<p>which again is one of the sort of three apex journals.</p>
<p>Nature, Science, Cell, I always say</p>
<p>is sort of the Super Bowl, NBA championships</p>
<p>and Stanley Cup of scientific publishing.</p>
<p>Very, very stringent in terms of the number of papers</p>
<p>they let in, very few that is.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper makes fairly obvious</p>
<p>what the paper is about.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness.</p>
<p>And I know a number of you probably hear that title</p>
<p>and think, oh boy, here we go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to tell us that giving away all our money</p>
<p>is going to make us happier than receiving money.</p>
<p>And I promise you that is not what I&rsquo;m going to tell you.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, this is a very interesting study.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that I think that we really</p>
<p>ought to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Because what the study is based on is the fact that income,</p>
<p>provided one&rsquo;s income meets a certain level of basic needs,</p>
<p>indeed has been shown to have only a weak effect</p>
<p>on overall happiness, okay?</p>
<p>So quoting from the paper in the first paragraph,</p>
<p>quote, income has a reliable,</p>
<p>but surprisingly weak effect on happiness within nations.</p>
<p>Within nations just mean they looked at this</p>
<p>in not just the United States,</p>
<p>but a number of other places as well,</p>
<p>particularly once basic needs are met.</p>
<p>Okay, so if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>then what aspects of money and having money</p>
<p>are related to happiness?</p>
<p>Certainly there are people who have a lot of money</p>
<p>who are very happy.</p>
<p>Certainly there are people who have very little money</p>
<p>who are very happy.</p>
<p>And of course the reverse is also true.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who don&rsquo;t have very much money</p>
<p>who are unhappy.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are people who have a lot of money</p>
<p>who are very unhappy.</p>
<p>A point that whenever it&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>often those with less money to kind of roll their eyes,</p>
<p>because the assumption is more money</p>
<p>does increase happiness.</p>
<p>And in fact, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And later we&rsquo;ll get back to this idea</p>
<p>of whether or how one acquired their money</p>
<p>has any impact on whether or not</p>
<p>that money increases their happiness or not.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s kind of earmark that for later.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about the findings in this paper.</p>
<p>This paper is interesting because what it did</p>
<p>is it explored something called pro-social spending.</p>
<p>Pro-social spending is a phenomenon</p>
<p>where people are taking a certain portion of their income</p>
<p>and they are giving it to others,</p>
<p>often for causes or for things that they think</p>
<p>are important to see happen in the world</p>
<p>or change in the world.</p>
<p>That could be a hungry individual</p>
<p>having access to food or medical care.</p>
<p>It could be for environmental causes.</p>
<p>It could be for animal wellness.</p>
<p>It could be for any number of different things.</p>
<p>It could even be giving somebody money</p>
<p>so that they can buy themselves a gift</p>
<p>or giving somebody money and not having any, excuse me,</p>
<p>understanding or expectation</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re going to do with the money.</p>
<p>Again, one of the central themes around gratitude</p>
<p>is that while receiving is great,</p>
<p>giving is also great</p>
<p>in terms of increasing sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And one of the more important features to that</p>
<p>is when we give either in the form of words</p>
<p>or in the form of resources,</p>
<p>knowledge that the person receiving</p>
<p>benefits from that in some real way</p>
<p>greatly increases the chance</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an increase in happiness for the giver</p>
<p>as well as the receiver.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s a note about gratitude,</p>
<p>but not an insignificant one as it relates to this study.</p>
<p>So what this study found was that higher pro-social spending</p>
<p>was associated with significantly greater happiness.</p>
<p>This was a very statistically significant effect.</p>
<p>And they found that the effects of income</p>
<p>and pro-social spending</p>
<p>were independent and similar in magnitude, okay?</p>
<p>Independent and similar in magnitude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what that means for those of you</p>
<p>that might be confused by that statement in just a moment.</p>
<p>Whereas, quote, personal spending</p>
<p>remained unrelated to happiness.</p>
<p>So what this study basically found was</p>
<p>if people are allotted a certain amount of money</p>
<p>to give away and one adjusts for overall income, right?</p>
<p>And this is important because you could imagine</p>
<p>that for some individual giving away $2,000</p>
<p>might represent a significant portion</p>
<p>of their yearly or monthly income.</p>
<p>And for another individual,</p>
<p>it might represent a tiny fraction of their income.</p>
<p>But when you adjust for income level,</p>
<p>what you find is that people who gave away money</p>
<p>benefited tremendously</p>
<p>in terms of their own increase in happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, quote, employees who devoted more of their bonuses</p>
<p>to pro-social spending, that is giving away more money,</p>
<p>experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus.</p>
<p>And the manner in which they spent that bonus</p>
<p>was a more important predictor of their happiness</p>
<p>than the size of the bonus itself.</p>
<p>This was an actual experiment they ran</p>
<p>with real income, real money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read that again just to make sure it hits home</p>
<p>because I found this to be really impactful.</p>
<p>Employees who devoted a greater fraction of their bonus</p>
<p>to pro-social spending,</p>
<p>that is giving away money to others,</p>
<p>experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus.</p>
<p>And the manner in which they spent that bonus</p>
<p>was a more important predictor of their happiness</p>
<p>than the size of the bonus itself.</p>
<p>So the actual bonus, the receiving of the money</p>
<p>led to greater increases in happiness if they gave it away.</p>
<p>And the act of giving it away itself</p>
<p>led to greater increases in happiness</p>
<p>than receiving the bonus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a twofer, as you might say.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this study and studies like it,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that to the extent that we can,</p>
<p>and again, when I say to the extent that we can,</p>
<p>this means whatever percentage of our own income</p>
<p>that we can afford to give away,</p>
<p>or if we don&rsquo;t have income, the percentage of our effort.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, this was about money,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also about effort.</p>
<p>We can help others, right?</p>
<p>You can serve in food kitchens.</p>
<p>You can do community gardening.</p>
<p>You can pick up trash.</p>
<p>You can do any number of things.</p>
<p>You can assist a neighbor with childcare,</p>
<p>or you can assist a neighbor who is physically less able</p>
<p>to retrieve their paper, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The point is that giving resources,</p>
<p>certainly in the form of money,</p>
<p>but also in the form of effort and time</p>
<p>is immensely beneficial for synthesizing our own happiness.</p>
<p>That is for the giver,</p>
<p>us to increase our levels of happiness.</p>
<p>But the degree of an increase in our own happiness</p>
<p>is proportional in some way</p>
<p>to the extent to which the person receiving</p>
<p>actually needed that help and registers that help.</p>
<p>Excellent research also points to the fact</p>
<p>that another potent way to synthesize happiness,</p>
<p>that is to create genuine states of happiness in ourselves,</p>
<p>is to leverage the so-called focus system,</p>
<p>or rather I should say,</p>
<p>to de-emphasize the tendency of our minds to wander.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent paper on this,</p>
<p>also published in the journal Science.</p>
<p>This is now a classic paper.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about it in the episode on meditation,</p>
<p>but for those of you that did</p>
<p>or perhaps didn&rsquo;t hear that episode,</p>
<p>I just want to briefly touch on a few aspects of the paper,</p>
<p>and in particular, a few aspects of the paper</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t talk about previously.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper, again, is very straightforward</p>
<p>in terms of telling you what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And that is,</p>
<p>A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind</p>
<p>by Killingsworth and Gilbert.</p>
<p>This paper was published in Science in 2010,</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to the paper.</p>
<p>This is frankly a very interesting paper.</p>
<p>This paper involved several thousand subjects,</p>
<p>or I should say, 2,250 adult subjects.</p>
<p>And what they were able to do</p>
<p>was to contact these subjects</p>
<p>while they were going about living their daily lives</p>
<p>and ask them both what they were doing</p>
<p>and what they were feeling.</p>
<p>There were some additional questions that they asked them,</p>
<p>but they were able to establish</p>
<p>whether or not people were watching television</p>
<p>or doing housework or working on a home computer</p>
<p>or resting or listening to music, et cetera,</p>
<p>in their natural environment.</p>
<p>So this is outside the laboratory.</p>
<p>And they were able to assess</p>
<p>to what extent those people were happy</p>
<p>or unhappy or neutral,</p>
<p>or had some other emotional state</p>
<p>at the time when they were engaging</p>
<p>in any number of different activities.</p>
<p>And they assessed whether or not those individuals</p>
<p>were also focused on or focused away</p>
<p>from whatever activity they were engaging in.</p>
<p>And the takeaways from this study are many,</p>
<p>but for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>what I think is especially interesting</p>
<p>is that regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>people were engaging in activities that they enjoyed or not,</p>
<p>the tendency for their mind to wander from an activity</p>
<p>predicted lower levels of happiness</p>
<p>than if they tended to be focused on the activity</p>
<p>they were engaged in.</p>
<p>Now, that itself should be surprising.</p>
<p>I mean, what that says is that</p>
<p>even if somebody was engaged in activity</p>
<p>like cleaning their house or doing homework</p>
<p>or reading something that they weren&rsquo;t enjoying,</p>
<p>if they were focused on what they were doing,</p>
<p>they tended to report as happier</p>
<p>than if their mind was drifting elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now, this also points to the idea that perhaps</p>
<p>our minds drift to unpleasant thoughts</p>
<p>more than pleasant thoughts,</p>
<p>but they also address that in the study.</p>
<p>Point I&rsquo;d like to make here is, quote,</p>
<p>although people&rsquo;s minds were more likely</p>
<p>to wander to pleasant topics, okay,</p>
<p>than to unpleasant topics,</p>
<p>and there the difference is pretty significant.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s minds tended to wander to pleasant topics</p>
<p>about 43% of the time as opposed to unpleasant topics</p>
<p>about 27% of the time,</p>
<p>or to neutral topics in the remaining 31% of the samples.</p>
<p>People were no happier when thinking about pleasant topics</p>
<p>than about their current activity.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>People were no happier than when thinking</p>
<p>about pleasant things than their current activity.</p>
<p>In fact, the mere focus on what they were doing</p>
<p>was more powerful than anything else,</p>
<p>even if they didn&rsquo;t enjoy what they were doing.</p>
<p>So they go on here to say, quote,</p>
<p>although negative moods are known to cause mind-wandering,</p>
<p>analysis strongly suggested that mind-wandering</p>
<p>was generally the cause, the cause,</p>
<p>and not merely the consequence of unhappiness.</p>
<p>And so there are a lot of aspects of this study</p>
<p>that are worth going into,</p>
<p>but the major takeaway,</p>
<p>or the one that perhaps we should all be most concerned with</p>
<p>is that when we are not focused on what we are doing,</p>
<p>we tend to be far less happy</p>
<p>than when we are focused on what we were doing,</p>
<p>even if what we were doing</p>
<p>is something that we don&rsquo;t deem very pleasant.</p>
<p>And certainly if we are engaged in something</p>
<p>that we consider very pleasant and we are very focused on,</p>
<p>well, then our levels of happiness are the highest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of obvious.</p>
<p>But what this really speaks to</p>
<p>is the tremendous power of building our ability</p>
<p>to focus on what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and to stay present to what we are doing.</p>
<p>Now, this whole notion of staying present</p>
<p>is one that itself is a little bit complicated.</p>
<p>And in the episode on meditation,</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beneficial to be present to our internal state,</p>
<p>or that is our interoceptive state,</p>
<p>our feelings of our heart rate</p>
<p>and how full or empty our gut feels,</p>
<p>or our state of being from our skin inward,</p>
<p>or whether or not we should focus on being present</p>
<p>to things in our immediate surroundings,</p>
<p>both are versions of being quote-unquote present,</p>
<p>as you can imagine.</p>
<p>But in the one case, we&rsquo;re focused internally,</p>
<p>in the other, we&rsquo;re focused externally.</p>
<p>And of course, most of the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some combination of the two.</p>
<p>But what this study really says is that any practice</p>
<p>that can powerfully impact our ability</p>
<p>to remain present in the activity we are engaged in,</p>
<p>could even be a phone call,</p>
<p>could be texting for that matter,</p>
<p>could be social media for that matter, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not placing judgment on the activity here.</p>
<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is the enormous happiness increasing value</p>
<p>of being present to what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>regardless of what we are doing.</p>
<p>And the practice that&rsquo;s known to be beneficial</p>
<p>for increasing our ability to focus is among other things,</p>
<p>a short meditation practice.</p>
<p>In fact, work from Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab at NYU.</p>
<p>Again, Wendy has been a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>Her laboratory has shown that even a very brief meditation</p>
<p>of about 13 minutes,</p>
<p>and this would be the quote-unquote classic type</p>
<p>of meditation of eyes closed,</p>
<p>focusing on one&rsquo;s breathing,</p>
<p>even a very brief meditation of just 13 minutes or so,</p>
<p>done consistently.</p>
<p>So ideally every day,</p>
<p>but you have to imagine that even if you skip a day,</p>
<p>there are still benefits.</p>
<p>That sort of meditation can greatly enhance</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>
<p>In her studies, it was also shown</p>
<p>that sort of brief meditation</p>
<p>could also greatly enhance mood and sleep</p>
<p>and various aspects of cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And work from my laboratory</p>
<p>in collaboration with Dr. David Spiegel</p>
<p>at Stanford Department of Psychiatry</p>
<p>has shown that even briefer meditations</p>
<p>of even just five minutes per day</p>
<p>can have fairly outsized positive effects</p>
<p>on a number of different parameters as well.</p>
<p>Those very brief types of meditations,</p>
<p>because they really are focusing and more accurately,</p>
<p>I should say refocusing exercises,</p>
<p>when you do that sort of activity of closing your eyes</p>
<p>and forcing yourself to focus and refocus</p>
<p>on your breath and internal state,</p>
<p>that is directing your perception inward,</p>
<p>or if you choose,</p>
<p>you could deliberately focus your perception</p>
<p>on some external object or sound for that matter.</p>
<p>When one does that,</p>
<p>the circuits of the brain involved in focus</p>
<p>dramatically improve,</p>
<p>that is they rewire and increase their ability</p>
<p>for you to achieve focus.</p>
<p>Many of us have heard about meditation.</p>
<p>Many of us think about meditation</p>
<p>as a mindfulness exercise,</p>
<p>mindfulness in quotes,</p>
<p>because that itself needs definition.</p>
<p>But I prefer to view meditations</p>
<p>of the sort that I just described</p>
<p>as perceptual or focus-based training,</p>
<p>which is really what the data point to.</p>
<p>Notions around consciousness and states of mind</p>
<p>are very hard to define,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that even a five minutes a day</p>
<p>or ideally up to a 13 minute a day meditation</p>
<p>can greatly increase our ability to focus.</p>
<p>And based on the findings in this paper,</p>
<p>a wandering mind is an unhappy mind,</p>
<p>also make it very clear that the ability to refocus</p>
<p>again and again and again</p>
<p>on what we&rsquo;re doing throughout our day,</p>
<p>regardless of what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>can have a very dramatic,</p>
<p>in fact, a statistically significant increase</p>
<p>on our levels of overall happiness.</p>
<p>So what else does the research tell us we can do</p>
<p>to increase our levels of genuine happiness?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>based on the longitudinal study from Harvard,</p>
<p>as well as the Yale Happiness Project</p>
<p>and the work of numerous laboratories in the US</p>
<p>and elsewhere,</p>
<p>that quality social connection is extremely powerful</p>
<p>in terms of its ability to increase our levels of happiness.</p>
<p>What is quality social connection?</p>
<p>Quality social connection</p>
<p>falls into a number of different bins.</p>
<p>This can be romantic connection,</p>
<p>this can be friendship,</p>
<p>this can even be coworker</p>
<p>or just daily superficial interaction type connections.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s surprising to a lot of people</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people hear</p>
<p>quality social connection</p>
<p>and they think deep conversation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very clear from the research</p>
<p>that oftentimes our conversations with people</p>
<p>that we are closest to are actually quite shallow.</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been in a romantic relationship</p>
<p>or a friendship for a long period of time,</p>
<p>or maybe even a sibling relationship</p>
<p>or other family relationship,</p>
<p>much of what you talk about</p>
<p>is fairly superficial or fairly trivial.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s often a sharing of the trivial day-to-day</p>
<p>things between two people or through groups of people</p>
<p>that leads to the feeling</p>
<p>that people are really connected to one another,</p>
<p>in particular, if it&rsquo;s involving shared experiences</p>
<p>of any kind, good or bad.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an extensive literature on social connection</p>
<p>and how to build social connection.</p>
<p>This certainly should be the topic</p>
<p>of a full episode of this podcast</p>
<p>in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>But because social connection can have</p>
<p>such a powerful impact on our states of happiness</p>
<p>and overall wellbeing,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize a few features of social connection</p>
<p>that I think most people might not appreciate.</p>
<p>Once again, when we hear quality social connection,</p>
<p>I think most of us tend to think about</p>
<p>deep, meaningful conversation,</p>
<p>or long walks on the beach,</p>
<p>or camping trips together, or travel together.</p>
<p>And while all of those certainly qualify</p>
<p>as wonderful opportunities for social connection,</p>
<p>opportunities for quality social connection</p>
<p>are certainly not limited to those kinds of interactions.</p>
<p>In fact, I can recall times in my graduate career,</p>
<p>so this would be times when I was living in the laboratory,</p>
<p>because that was a significant portion</p>
<p>of my graduate years.</p>
<p>And one of the more important social connections for me</p>
<p>was the staff that worked there</p>
<p>in the wee hours of the night</p>
<p>and that came in very early in the morning.</p>
<p>So one of the more regular social connections I had</p>
<p>is I would brush my teeth in the hallway bathroom,</p>
<p>and there was no one else really around at that time,</p>
<p>except for the janitors that tended to leave</p>
<p>early in the morning,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d worked a good portion of the night,</p>
<p>or that were arriving very early in the day.</p>
<p>And the fact that I would see them on a regular basis</p>
<p>and maybe exchange a few words about their work,</p>
<p>or their families, or the holidays,</p>
<p>actually for me became very meaningful,</p>
<p>in part because my social connections at the time</p>
<p>were really limited to only social connections</p>
<p>that I had in the context of work.</p>
<p>Now, some people might look at my schedule at that time</p>
<p>and look at my life at that time and say,</p>
<p>that was very unhealthy,</p>
<p>you were lacking in certain number of ways.</p>
<p>But frankly, looking back and at the time,</p>
<p>and I know this because I journaled at the time,</p>
<p>I was exceedingly happy, at least for that stage of my life.</p>
<p>At that stage of my life,</p>
<p>I wanted to be focused primarily on doing experiments</p>
<p>and immersing myself in my scientific training.</p>
<p>And for me, the even seemingly insignificant interactions</p>
<p>of talking to the janitor in the morning</p>
<p>or some of the other regular staff</p>
<p>was not insignificant.</p>
<p>In fact, for me, it was very significant.</p>
<p>And over the holidays, when their hours were reduced,</p>
<p>I actually missed them quite a lot.</p>
<p>And even as I talk about this,</p>
<p>I can recall the feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>of just seeing familiar faces.</p>
<p>And that brings up an important point,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s a quite extensive literature</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that when we see faces,</p>
<p>especially faces in the morning and in the late afternoon,</p>
<p>there is a positive impact on the emotional circuitry,</p>
<p>or I should say the circuitry of the brain</p>
<p>that underlies emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t come as surprising.</p>
<p>We as old world primates, much like other primates,</p>
<p>are very dependent on faces and facial expressions</p>
<p>in terms of registering our own place in life</p>
<p>and our emotional state.</p>
<p>Now, the origins of this are many.</p>
<p>In particular, we have a brain area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually called the fusiform face gyrus.</p>
<p>This is an area of the brain that was largely discovered</p>
<p>by a woman by Nancy Kanwisher at MIT.</p>
<p>And the Kanwisher lab has done extensive work</p>
<p>showing that this brain area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dedicated to the processing of faces,</p>
<p>and not just faces in real life,</p>
<p>but faces on computer screens and elsewhere,</p>
<p>are intimately tied to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with emotionality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually work from another laboratory,</p>
<p>Doris Sal&rsquo;s laboratory at Caltech, now at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>has shown that this face processing area in the brain,</p>
<p>in both non-human primates and primates,</p>
<p>is directly linked to the areas of our brain</p>
<p>that associate with anxiety and fear,</p>
<p>but also areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with wellbeing.</p>
<p>So it comes as no surprise that when we see faces,</p>
<p>in particular friendly faces,</p>
<p>even if we have just brief interactions with those faces,</p>
<p>and even if no words are exchanged,</p>
<p>that creates the sense of social bond,</p>
<p>and it creates a sense of predictability.</p>
<p>And I raise this again because I think a lot of people</p>
<p>think that social connection</p>
<p>always has to come in the form of close friendships,</p>
<p>which of course are wonderful,</p>
<p>or close romantic relationships,</p>
<p>which of course are wonderful,</p>
<p>or close family relationships,</p>
<p>which of course are wonderful.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll soon discuss in our model of happiness</p>
<p>or how to achieve happiness</p>
<p>based on the scientific literature in a few minutes,</p>
<p>social connection can and should come in various forms.</p>
<p>And when I say various forms,</p>
<p>I mean forms of brief interaction,</p>
<p>more superficial interaction,</p>
<p>and forms of deeper interaction.</p>
<p>All of those are relevant to our states of happiness,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s research to support</p>
<p>that daily interactions with somebody at a cafe</p>
<p>or just a brief hello or a smile,</p>
<p>provided that we are both present,</p>
<p>where we make the effort to be present</p>
<p>to those interactions,</p>
<p>however brief they are,</p>
<p>can have a positive effect on people&rsquo;s overall wellbeing,</p>
<p>and not just in that moment, but consistently.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the fact, I think,</p>
<p>that when I look back on those years</p>
<p>of working long hours in the laboratory</p>
<p>and essentially restricting myself</p>
<p>either to exercising, sleeping, eating, or working,</p>
<p>again, that&rsquo;s what I wanted at that stage of my life,</p>
<p>certainly not the way I live my life now,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I wanted at that stage of my life,</p>
<p>that even those seemingly insignificant</p>
<p>social interactions were important to me</p>
<p>and had a potent impact on increasing my level of happiness,</p>
<p>and frankly, still do, and I feel that right now.</p>
<p>That said, I think all of us can appreciate</p>
<p>the immense value of social connection</p>
<p>that is of the more long-lasting,</p>
<p>and for lack of a better word, richer type,</p>
<p>whether or not that is with siblings or with parents</p>
<p>or with friends or with romantic partners.</p>
<p>For that reason, I want to emphasize a little bit</p>
<p>about what constitutes connection</p>
<p>and what constitutes social connection.</p>
<p>There are basically two forms of social connection</p>
<p>that have been studied, and I&rsquo;ll review both,</p>
<p>as it relates to increasing our levels of happiness,</p>
<p>and the first one is presence and eye contact,</p>
<p>and the second is physical contact.</p>
<p>So in terms of presence and eye contact,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of studies</p>
<p>about whether or not people exchange direct eye contact</p>
<p>during conversation or not,</p>
<p>dictating whether or not each individual</p>
<p>in that interaction feels as if they had a connection.</p>
<p>Now, again, keep in mind that while we think of connection</p>
<p>as relating to some deep or meaningful conversation,</p>
<p>and oftentimes that can be the case,</p>
<p>think, for instance,</p>
<p>an excellent therapist-patient relationship</p>
<p>or an excellent romantic relationship</p>
<p>or an excellent friendship</p>
<p>where you really feel heard and understood,</p>
<p>or at least to the extent</p>
<p>that people are willing to explore certain topics with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re willing to hear them and listen really carefully</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re willing to hear and listen to what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>in an attempt to understand.</p>
<p>That certainly can enhance the sense of social connection</p>
<p>leading to what people would call social bonds</p>
<p>leading to increased happiness,</p>
<p>but eye contact is also known to be an important feature.</p>
<p>The thing about eye contact is that most people assume</p>
<p>that a lot of eye contact, and in fact, ongoing eye contact,</p>
<p>is critical to a sense of connection.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a recent paper that I find really interesting</p>
<p>that was published in</p>
<p>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2021.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>Eye Contact Marks the Rise and Fall</p>
<p>of Shared Attention in Conversation.</p>
<p>I find this paper interesting for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, my laboratory works on</p>
<p>internal states and vision,</p>
<p>so it relates directly to the work that my laboratory does,</p>
<p>but also that it violates what I thought was a general rule</p>
<p>of social connection,</p>
<p>which is this idea that two people need to be focused</p>
<p>on one another, that is looking at one another directly</p>
<p>and fairly consistently throughout a conversation</p>
<p>in order for the feeling of connection to emerge.</p>
<p>But it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>And in fact, just to give you the takeaway,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll flesh it out a little bit with some data,</p>
<p>eye contact, or I should say mutual eye contact,</p>
<p>so two people registering the presence</p>
<p>of the other person looking at them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at me and I&rsquo;m looking at you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>then perhaps we&rsquo;re actually doing this at that moment.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>just know that I&rsquo;m looking directly into the camera</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m saying this at this moment.</p>
<p>If we were to be looking directly at one another,</p>
<p>that, it turns out, signals the next step,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s very likely</p>
<p>that we will each both look away.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be a way in which we set</p>
<p>and reset attention continually during conversation.</p>
<p>So again, I really like this study</p>
<p>because of the high fidelity, the high temporal precision,</p>
<p>that is the precision over time</p>
<p>at which they looked at eye contact</p>
<p>and engagement of attention between individuals.</p>
<p>And they did this by looking at things like pupil size</p>
<p>and of course where the eyes were looking</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The basic takeaway of this study was the following,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m quoting from the study,</p>
<p>quote, rather than maximizing shared attention,</p>
<p>good conversation may require shifts</p>
<p>in and out of shared states accompanied by eye contact.</p>
<p>So what this basically says is that</p>
<p>when two people are involved in a very,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it an intimate conversation,</p>
<p>but the word intimate should not be misconstrued</p>
<p>to mean something about intimacy or sexual intimacy</p>
<p>or physical intimacy,</p>
<p>just a conversation in which both people feel</p>
<p>present to the conversation</p>
<p>and focused on that conversation</p>
<p>and that conversation and its contents only.</p>
<p>The tendency is for people to take turns talking,</p>
<p>although sometimes depending on the individuals,</p>
<p>they might interrupt more or less.</p>
<p>Again, interrupting can be a sign of interest.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always have to be rude by the way,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re sharing information,</p>
<p>hopefully about a common topic or set of topics.</p>
<p>They will at some moment look at one another,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the study shows,</p>
<p>and that after briefly gazing directly at one another,</p>
<p>attention peaks and then they will look away</p>
<p>and attention will get reduced.</p>
<p>And then the conversation consists of a series</p>
<p>of focusing back on one another with their eyes</p>
<p>and then focusing off, focusing on and focusing off.</p>
<p>And those mutual eye contact moments</p>
<p>actually predict the breaking of attention.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this ramping up of attention</p>
<p>and breaking of attention,</p>
<p>ramping of attention and breaking of attention.</p>
<p>I think these are important results</p>
<p>because they violate the stereotype or assumption</p>
<p>that deep social connection of the sort</p>
<p>leading to happiness always involves ongoing eye contact</p>
<p>or ongoing focus.</p>
<p>Just as with meditation, just as with any activity, frankly,</p>
<p>we undergo shifts in attention and focus,</p>
<p>that is focus ramps up and then it breaks</p>
<p>and then it re-engages.</p>
<p>It ramps up, it breaks, and then it re-engages.</p>
<p>And that it turns out is the basis</p>
<p>of in-depth connected conversation.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in creating social connection in any context,</p>
<p>and in particular for the sake of increasing happiness,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very clear that social connections,</p>
<p>even if they are fairly superficial social connections,</p>
<p>can increase our sense of happiness.</p>
<p>Seeing faces is important, ideally faces in person,</p>
<p>although I suppose these days over Zoom</p>
<p>or over other screen type medium would be a close second.</p>
<p>But the point is that if you want to increase happiness,</p>
<p>you need to have quality social connections.</p>
<p>And if you want to have quality social connections,</p>
<p>you need to be present and engage</p>
<p>in those social connections.</p>
<p>And that requires a viewing of each other&rsquo;s faces, ideally,</p>
<p>which is not to say that a phone call</p>
<p>or text exchange can&rsquo;t be meaningful,</p>
<p>but that faces are really the most powerful way</p>
<p>to engage in social contact.</p>
<p>And that eye contact, not consistent eye contact,</p>
<p>but eye contact of the sort that builds up</p>
<p>and breaks across the interaction</p>
<p>is going to be the best way that we are aware of</p>
<p>to feel that one had a real connection.</p>
<p>This should also remove any pressure</p>
<p>that you might feel to constantly look at somebody</p>
<p>or to be completely eyes open,</p>
<p>staring at them without blinking or diverting your attention</p>
<p>at any point during a conversation.</p>
<p>This also, frankly, is an opportunity</p>
<p>where if somebody says,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re not paying attention because you look away,</p>
<p>that you may actually be engaging</p>
<p>in what is the more typical form of healthy connection.</p>
<p>I talked about this long ago on an episode about focus.</p>
<p>It turns out when we are listening very intently</p>
<p>to somebody and trying to remember the information</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling us, we will often close our eyes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a form of lack of attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a form of attending in</p>
<p>because we have so much of our brain devoted to vision.</p>
<p>40% of our brain is devoted to vision</p>
<p>in some way or another.</p>
<p>When we close our eyes,</p>
<p>we can actually devote more attentional resources</p>
<p>to remembering the specifics of what people are telling us.</p>
<p>But again, please don&rsquo;t go through conversations</p>
<p>with your eyes closed the entire time.</p>
<p>I think that would certainly not be conducive</p>
<p>to building social connection.</p>
<p>So we know that faces are important for social connection</p>
<p>as it relates to synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And we know that eye contact is really important</p>
<p>for building social connection.</p>
<p>Physical contact is also important for social connection</p>
<p>and not just romantic or sexual type connection.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a form of physical connection</p>
<p>that is present in other primates.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s present as far as we know in all mammals</p>
<p>and is also very much a feature of the human nervous system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something called allo-grooming.</p>
<p>I have to imagine that most people</p>
<p>probably haven&rsquo;t heard of allo-grooming.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m bringing up allo-grooming</p>
<p>is that it stems from a fairly extensive literature</p>
<p>about the pro-social, pro-happiness effects of pets</p>
<p>on humans.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to read up on this,</p>
<p>there is a paper out of Yale University</p>
<p>on this topic that was published in 2018.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>The Influence of Interactions with Dogs on Affect,</p>
<p>aka emotion, anxiety, and arousal in children.</p>
<p>And it references some other studies</p>
<p>that were performed on humans.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway is that the so-called AAAs,</p>
<p>animal assisted activities,</p>
<p>represent a really potent way to increase people,</p>
<p>including children&rsquo;s feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about this to me</p>
<p>is that dogs themselves don&rsquo;t really have to do much</p>
<p>except be present in the room</p>
<p>in order for these positive effects,</p>
<p>that is the reductions in anxiety,</p>
<p>increases in happiness, et cetera, to occur.</p>
<p>And in fact, they can be very, very brief.</p>
<p>As they describe in the paper,</p>
<p>brief unstructured interactions with an unfamiliar dog,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t even need to know this dog,</p>
<p>after exposure to a moderate stressor</p>
<p>showed higher positive affect relevant participants</p>
<p>who received a soothing object</p>
<p>or waited for the same amount of time.</p>
<p>So just even seeing a dog for a brief amount of time</p>
<p>has been shown to reduce stress and improve happiness,</p>
<p>or I should say, increase feelings of happiness overall</p>
<p>than a child receiving a soothing object,</p>
<p>which was, at least for me, a little bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>I would have thought that children</p>
<p>receiving a soothing object</p>
<p>would have been the more powerful stimulus.</p>
<p>But in fact, it wasn&rsquo;t, at least not in this study.</p>
<p>The real question I think we should be asking ourselves</p>
<p>is what is it about interactions with others</p>
<p>and with other animals that could potentially have</p>
<p>this pro-social happiness enhancing effect?</p>
<p>And the reason I raise this is also because</p>
<p>I think many people are interested in either owning</p>
<p>or having interactions with pets</p>
<p>as a way to improve their feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And I say having interactions with,</p>
<p>because I myself am a good example of somebody</p>
<p>who wasn&rsquo;t always able to have pets.</p>
<p>So when I was a graduate student and a postdoc,</p>
<p>I very much wanted a dog, very, very, very much wanted a dog.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a rule in my family at some point</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to talk about dogs anymore</p>
<p>because I was talking about all the breeds of dogs,</p>
<p>going to dog breeders,</p>
<p>examining different breeds, going to the pound, et cetera.</p>
<p>The point was that I was obsessed with getting a dog,</p>
<p>but I knew I wasn&rsquo;t in a good position to own a dog yet.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have the finances,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have the correct living situation and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually I did own a dog, of course,</p>
<p>but at the time I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what I would do is every Sunday,</p>
<p>I would go to a place where they fostered dogs</p>
<p>and they needed dog walkers and I would walk their dog.</p>
<p>I would also walk my neighbor&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t charge them for it.</p>
<p>In fact, I felt like I was being paid</p>
<p>by getting time with those dogs.</p>
<p>And in fact, I put an ad at that time on Craigslist</p>
<p>that I would walk people&rsquo;s dogs for free.</p>
<p>And only a few people took that seriously.</p>
<p>But of the ones that did,</p>
<p>I had a great little cadre of dog owners</p>
<p>that would allow me to take their dogs out</p>
<p>and I was super happy.</p>
<p>It just made me very, very happy and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>And frankly, it was a great opportunity for me</p>
<p>to also get to know the various dog breeds</p>
<p>and the different dog temperaments</p>
<p>and to learn a little bit about my ability</p>
<p>to interact with dogs in a certain way.</p>
<p>I actually got to be a pretty good dog walker.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, later I got a bulldog</p>
<p>and it turns out no matter how good a dog walker you are,</p>
<p>bulldogs just simply don&rsquo;t like to walk.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;ve ever walked up to a bulldog</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve offered to scratch or pet that dog,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that bulldogs love that.</p>
<p>And I would argue, having been a bulldog owner,</p>
<p>that they like it because it&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>for them to stop moving.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s more about the bulldog</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;m about to tell you next,</p>
<p>which is this principle of so-called allo-grooming.</p>
<p>Allo-grooming is a pattern of behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s observed in essentially all mammals,</p>
<p>but very strongly in non-human primates and primates</p>
<p>where individuals within a species touch one another,</p>
<p>and this is non-sexual touch.</p>
<p>So this would be someone brushing somebody else&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>or combing their hair,</p>
<p>or even using a lint roller on them, for instance,</p>
<p>or someone grooming somebody else.</p>
<p>Now, typically one needs to have</p>
<p>an established relationship with this person.</p>
<p>So it could be a professional type relationship</p>
<p>where this is a barber cutting somebody&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>or a hairdresser styling somebody&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>It could be somebody giving someone a manicure</p>
<p>or a pedicure.</p>
<p>It could be somebody doing skincare or massage</p>
<p>for somebody in a professional context,</p>
<p>or it could be two people who have agreed</p>
<p>that it is appropriate for the context</p>
<p>and for the relationship for one person</p>
<p>to be grooming somebody else.</p>
<p>This can even, believe it or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literature on this,</p>
<p>this can even extend into the realm</p>
<p>of people sort of cleaning and picking off other people.</p>
<p>Now, when we see this in primates,</p>
<p>it seems like a very cute</p>
<p>and sort of almost understandable behavior.</p>
<p>We can see these pictures online.</p>
<p>If you look them up, you can just look up aloe grooming</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see a vast number of pictures of, for instance,</p>
<p>baboons picking little things out of each other&rsquo;s hair,</p>
<p>or grooming and kind of perusing one another to find things,</p>
<p>presumably parasites or like little bits of plants</p>
<p>or something like that that they want to remove from them.</p>
<p>Aloe grooming is known to stimulate</p>
<p>a certain category of neurons called the C-tactile fibers.</p>
<p>These are a particular category of so-called sensory neurons</p>
<p>that innervate our skin.</p>
<p>So these are literally like little endings of neurons,</p>
<p>little wires that end up in the skin</p>
<p>that when they&rsquo;re touched lightly,</p>
<p>tend to create a feeling of wellbeing</p>
<p>in the person that&rsquo;s being touched.</p>
<p>Again, this is consensual touch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very context appropriate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s known to increase levels of oxytocin,</p>
<p>a kind of hormone slash neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both really,</p>
<p>that is known to evoke feelings of bond</p>
<p>or of feeling bonded to somebody or something.</p>
<p>And for many people, we hear about oxytocin</p>
<p>and we think about the bond between parent and child,</p>
<p>in particular, mother and infant,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been most extensively studied,</p>
<p>or between two members of a romantic couple.</p>
<p>But if you look at the literature on aloe grooming,</p>
<p>what you find is that when humans groom one another,</p>
<p>the increases in oxytocin that are experienced</p>
<p>are at least on par with,</p>
<p>and in fact, more often, more dramatic</p>
<p>in response to aloe grooming</p>
<p>than in response to other forms of touch.</p>
<p>So the point here is that aloe grooming</p>
<p>is a pro-social behavior that tends to associate with</p>
<p>and promote feelings of wellbeing and happiness.</p>
<p>And this is not a trivial effect.</p>
<p>If you look at the brain imaging data</p>
<p>or other forms of data on this,</p>
<p>aloe grooming is a very powerful form</p>
<p>of bonding between individuals that&rsquo;s completely nonverbal.</p>
<p>In fact, most often it doesn&rsquo;t involve eye contact.</p>
<p>I suppose two people could be looking at one another,</p>
<p>grooming one another,</p>
<p>but typically this is done from the side or from behind.</p>
<p>Why did I bring up the paper on pets?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that when humans stroke dogs</p>
<p>or brush their dogs or stroke cats</p>
<p>or brush their cats, et cetera,</p>
<p>that is a form of human-to-animal aloe grooming.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one in which both the pet and the human</p>
<p>receive huge increases in oxytocin</p>
<p>and other related neurochemicals that make us feel bonded.</p>
<p>I bring this up</p>
<p>because the Harvard Longitudinal Study on Happiness</p>
<p>and many, many others,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of other studies on happiness,</p>
<p>point to the importance of quality social connection,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You hear this over and over again.</p>
<p>People on their deathbeds don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>they wish they had worked more.</p>
<p>People on their deathbeds talk about</p>
<p>the richness of social connections</p>
<p>or the wish that they had invested more</p>
<p>in social connections.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people think of social connections</p>
<p>only in terms of travel with or conversation with others,</p>
<p>but much of what we perceive as deep social connections</p>
<p>also involves physical contact.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s deeply rooted, excuse me,</p>
<p>in our evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s present both in us and in non-human primates.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear that we can engage in</p>
<p>these kinds of pro-social, non-verbal,</p>
<p>non-eye contact type behaviors</p>
<p>through things like non-sexual tactile touch,</p>
<p>AKA allo grooming.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about a number of the different things</p>
<p>that one can do in order to increase levels of happiness.</p>
<p>And certainly before we conclude today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to touch back into not just synthetic happiness</p>
<p>and the various things we can do,</p>
<p>such as pro-social spending, allo grooming,</p>
<p>social connection, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also things related to happiness that involve</p>
<p>focus on vocation and work and pursuit of goals.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned at the beginning,</p>
<p>those are also critical to increasing</p>
<p>our state of happiness and certainly our state of security</p>
<p>and the feeling that we can provide for ourselves</p>
<p>and perhaps for others as well.</p>
<p>So we will talk about that,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s also important to talk about</p>
<p>this notion of choice and choices</p>
<p>and whether or not having a lot of freedom to choose</p>
<p>or limited freedom in choosing what we do and what we get</p>
<p>and what we are able to pursue in life,</p>
<p>how that relates to both natural happiness</p>
<p>and synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>Dan Gilbert and others have explored this issue</p>
<p>of freedom of choice and how it relates to happiness.</p>
<p>And there, I must say the findings</p>
<p>are incredibly counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but very, very well supported by all of their data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to summarize a large amount of those studies</p>
<p>at once by saying the following.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s laboratory and other laboratories</p>
<p>have done experiments where they give people</p>
<p>a series of options.</p>
<p>In one of the more classic examples,</p>
<p>they give people the opportunity to rate</p>
<p>a number of different paintings or pictures</p>
<p>in ascending or descending order of preference.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re deciding which ones they like most,</p>
<p>which ones they like least.</p>
<p>Then what&rsquo;s interesting is the experimenter</p>
<p>will vary the extent to which</p>
<p>they have to stick to that choice.</p>
<p>So this could be sticking to the choice</p>
<p>by receiving that painting to take home</p>
<p>or in another experiment,</p>
<p>it was having to make a choice</p>
<p>between giving up one photograph that they,</p>
<p>the research subject took,</p>
<p>or another photograph that they took.</p>
<p>One of the photographs was going to go off to a publication,</p>
<p>another one they could keep for themselves.</p>
<p>And the conditions in that experiment</p>
<p>were either that you had to make the decision</p>
<p>and it was final,</p>
<p>that is you could keep one and rate your decision,</p>
<p>or you could keep one</p>
<p>and then you had the opportunity to swap out</p>
<p>that picture for the other one at some later time.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>these experiments really weren&rsquo;t about rating pictures,</p>
<p>they were really about whether or not</p>
<p>constraining your choice,</p>
<p>meaning forcing somebody to make a choice</p>
<p>and stick to that choice led to greater levels</p>
<p>or lesser levels of happiness and satisfaction</p>
<p>with that choice.</p>
<p>And what they find consistently</p>
<p>is that when people have an ongoing set of choices,</p>
<p>it leads to reduced levels of happiness.</p>
<p>Now that might come as surprising to many of you,</p>
<p>but I want to be clear about what this means.</p>
<p>This is not to say that having a lot of choices</p>
<p>of what you like most leads to lesser happiness.</p>
<p>And that having fewer choices about things you do</p>
<p>or objects you acquire, et cetera,</p>
<p>leads to greater happiness.</p>
<p>What this set of experiments really points to</p>
<p>is that when we make a choice,</p>
<p>if we are forced to stick to that choice,</p>
<p>we tend to be far happier with that choice</p>
<p>than if we maintain the option to change our mind.</p>
<p>The results of these experiments are extremely informative,</p>
<p>I believe, in terms of understanding</p>
<p>our real life happiness,</p>
<p>that is happiness outside the laboratory.</p>
<p>But I think they are often misunderstood</p>
<p>as meaning that if we have a lot of choices,</p>
<p>we tend to be less happy than if we have fewer choices.</p>
<p>That is not the case.</p>
<p>Having freedom of choice is terrific</p>
<p>and actually correlates with elevated levels of happiness.</p>
<p>But once we make our choice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clearly the case that killing all other choices</p>
<p>or having all other options killed for us</p>
<p>increases our satisfaction with the choice that we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Whereas leaving doors open, leaving options open,</p>
<p>greatly diminishes our sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>This has been exported to any number of different domains.</p>
<p>So this has been exported to the domain</p>
<p>of making choices about what college to go to</p>
<p>or what partner to select in life.</p>
<p>In every one of those instances,</p>
<p>we see that our happiness with our choice</p>
<p>is very much related to that choice</p>
<p>being either the only one or one of very few other options.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different ways to interpret this</p>
<p>through the lens of neuroscience,</p>
<p>we might say that the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>the area of the brain that&rsquo;s involved in decision-making</p>
<p>and evaluating different options</p>
<p>is an area of the brain that&rsquo;s vital,</p>
<p>frankly, to our evolution as human beings</p>
<p>and to our daily life and to our whole life.</p>
<p>It is, of course, the thing that allows us</p>
<p>to evaluate different rule sets, to change rule sets,</p>
<p>to switch contexts and to create meaning, et cetera,</p>
<p>to interpret what&rsquo;s good, what&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a fairly costly process,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s very metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entire literature</p>
<p>related to what&rsquo;s called ego depletion.</p>
<p>This is certainly a topic for a future podcast,</p>
<p>but ego depletion essentially says</p>
<p>that if I have you attend very intensely to a given task,</p>
<p>for instance, asking you to count backwards</p>
<p>from 1,000 to zero in increments of 13,</p>
<p>and then have you switch about halfway through,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard for a lot of people.</p>
<p>If I have you do that,</p>
<p>then your ability to suppress impulsive behavior</p>
<p>and to do a hard cognitive or physical task</p>
<p>immediately after that is actually suppressed,</p>
<p>the so-called ego depletion.</p>
<p>It relates to a number of different things,</p>
<p>but it certainly relates to engagement</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is very metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>So evaluating choices and doing computation of numbers</p>
<p>or attending to things with your mind</p>
<p>and forcing yourself to focus intensely</p>
<p>is metabolically demanding,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a limited resource</p>
<p>that can be reset by things like sleep</p>
<p>and non-sleep deep rest or idle time</p>
<p>or letting your mind wander,</p>
<p>in that case, a positive mind wandering</p>
<p>to allow your brain to reset its ability of focus.</p>
<p>But the other thing that it does</p>
<p>is it impacts the reward circuitry of the brain,</p>
<p>the so-called dopamine reward circuitry</p>
<p>and other reward circuitries of the brain.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m painting with a broad brush,</p>
<p>but it essentially divides them such that, for instance,</p>
<p>if a given choice of a, let&rsquo;s say a partner,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re buying ourselves an article of clothing,</p>
<p>not that I want to compare selection of a life partner</p>
<p>to selection of an article of clothing,</p>
<p>but just to give multiple examples,</p>
<p>might give us, and here it&rsquo;s arbitrary units,</p>
<p>X units of dopamine increase.</p>
<p>Well, if we buy that article of clothing</p>
<p>or we select that life partner,</p>
<p>and then we emerge from the store or the wedding</p>
<p>and we are focused on what we purchased for ourselves,</p>
<p>or our life partner choice, and only that,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s a certain amount</p>
<p>of neurochemical reward associated with that</p>
<p>and happiness and wellbeing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also very clear that if we leave those choices,</p>
<p>the store or our wedding, for instance,</p>
<p>or our life with somebody for a moment,</p>
<p>even just mentally,</p>
<p>and start thinking about the other options</p>
<p>that we might entertain as possible,</p>
<p>if those are still open to us in reality or in our mind,</p>
<p>well, then our reward circuitry becomes fractured in a way,</p>
<p>not physically fractured,</p>
<p>but less attention is devoted to the reward circuitry</p>
<p>associated with our choice.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>instead of it being X units of dopamine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s X divided by however many other choices</p>
<p>we might have available to us in our mind or in reality.</p>
<p>Okay, so instead of, and again, these are arbitrary units,</p>
<p>but instead of a certain amount of reward,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a certain amount of reward</p>
<p>divided by the number of other options</p>
<p>that we might be considering</p>
<p>as alternatives to what we chose.</p>
<p>And I think this is a very important aspect</p>
<p>of understanding how limiting our choices</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;ve made them is a vital part</p>
<p>of what we call synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, we could even go so far as to say</p>
<p>that focusing on the choices we&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>and really investing in those choices,</p>
<p>as good ones or great ones,</p>
<p>and really trying to limit our thinking</p>
<p>to the choices that we&rsquo;ve made once we&rsquo;ve made them</p>
<p>is perhaps also important to our natural happiness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so inextricably entwined</p>
<p>with what we think of as a good life.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is if we are constantly in a mode</p>
<p>of evaluative decision-making</p>
<p>even after we&rsquo;ve made a decision,</p>
<p>we are not neurochemically nor psychologically</p>
<p>able to extract the feelings of happiness</p>
<p>associated with the choice that we made.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about a number</p>
<p>of different dimensions of happiness,</p>
<p>both in synthetic and natural happiness,</p>
<p>and some of the more counterintuitive aspects of happiness.</p>
<p>For instance, that people tend to adjust</p>
<p>their levels of happiness, not regardless,</p>
<p>but often in spite of their life circumstances.</p>
<p>But as we emphasized earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>that is not to say, at least the research</p>
<p>does not directly support the idea</p>
<p>that a major trauma or loss won&rsquo;t impact our happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, it tends to, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that people access resources and work</p>
<p>devoted to overcoming trauma,</p>
<p>which certainly exist out there.</p>
<p>And of course, there are the longitudinal studies</p>
<p>and short-term studies showing that income level</p>
<p>and material things don&rsquo;t necessarily scale</p>
<p>with happiness and vice versa.</p>
<p>And yet we also acknowledge early in the episode</p>
<p>that while indeed money can&rsquo;t buy happiness,</p>
<p>it can buffer stress.</p>
<p>And while work doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness per se,</p>
<p>work can bring a tremendous feeling of meaning and resources</p>
<p>which can then put you into contexts</p>
<p>in which things like pro-social contact and enhanced bonds</p>
<p>and caretaking of others and their view can be enhanced.</p>
<p>So it would be unfair, and in fact, inaccurate</p>
<p>to simply view happiness through the lens</p>
<p>of money doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s all about social connection</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Absolutely, social connection is important,</p>
<p>which is why we spent some minutes talking</p>
<p>about some of the ways to enhance social connection</p>
<p>both with other human beings and other animals</p>
<p>and them with us.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a opportunity here</p>
<p>to take the research on happiness,</p>
<p>the research on the neuroscience of what happiness</p>
<p>and gratitude and pro-social connection tells us</p>
<p>and to combine it into a bit of a model</p>
<p>or a toolkit, if you will.</p>
<p>And I think indeed this will be a toolkit</p>
<p>in one of our future toolkit episodes,</p>
<p>likely merged with the toolkit on gratitude,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t done yet.</p>
<p>And perhaps even we will do an entire episode</p>
<p>on social bonds and how to enhance or build social bonds</p>
<p>or at least what the science tells us about that.</p>
<p>If we take a step back</p>
<p>and we look at the concept of happiness,</p>
<p>we can make a couple of absolute statements.</p>
<p>That is statements that I think very few people,</p>
<p>if any, would contest.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s no single molecule</p>
<p>or chemical associated with happiness,</p>
<p>but that the chemical milieu of the brain and body</p>
<p>is important for setting the stage</p>
<p>or the opportunity for happiness.</p>
<p>Hence why there are treatments aimed</p>
<p>at alleviating depression or mania</p>
<p>that target certain neurochemical systems</p>
<p>and hormone systems.</p>
<p>Happiness, at least the way I&rsquo;m framing it today,</p>
<p>has essentially two components.</p>
<p>One is meaning.</p>
<p>That is what sort of meaning</p>
<p>do certain types of interactions or behaviors,</p>
<p>could be work, could be social interactions, et cetera,</p>
<p>carry for us.</p>
<p>And nested in that is this concept of connection.</p>
<p>And we talked a bit about tools for enhancing connection.</p>
<p>Things like eye contact, but not constant eye contact.</p>
<p>Things like being very present to a conversation</p>
<p>or an activity that you&rsquo;re engaging in.</p>
<p>Remember, we talked about the paper,</p>
<p>A Distracted Mind is an Unhappy Mind,</p>
<p>the paper published in Science.</p>
<p>And we talked about the study also published in Science</p>
<p>in which giving money,</p>
<p>but also knowing how that money</p>
<p>has positively impacted others</p>
<p>leads to this feeling of pro-social connection</p>
<p>and happiness in the giver and in the receiver.</p>
<p>And I should mention again</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just the giving of money,</p>
<p>but also the giving of effort and time and attention</p>
<p>that can have similar effects.</p>
<p>So we have meaning and connection</p>
<p>and a number of different ways to access those.</p>
<p>And then we have this access that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>as performance and resources.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about performance and resources</p>
<p>as it relates to natural happiness,</p>
<p>not synthetic happiness, but natural happiness,</p>
<p>because we would be wrong, I believe,</p>
<p>if we were to say that income doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say based on the research</p>
<p>that income matters and income</p>
<p>that can cover costs of living,</p>
<p>plus that includes some buffer.</p>
<p>And what do I mean by buffer?</p>
<p>I mean, buffer to the anxiety</p>
<p>that circumstances might change is important.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s going to vary from person to person,</p>
<p>meaning some people will be perfectly happy</p>
<p>making $1 more than their absolute cost of living</p>
<p>every month.</p>
<p>Other people will require a more substantial buffer</p>
<p>in order to protect them</p>
<p>against the negative psychological effects</p>
<p>of worrying about, for instance, inflation</p>
<p>or worrying that they might lose their job.</p>
<p>And this is why I think most people recommend having,</p>
<p>if possible, some buffer in their bank account</p>
<p>that could cover two or three or maybe even six</p>
<p>or maybe in 12 months of living expenses</p>
<p>were they to lose their job</p>
<p>or something catastrophic happened to them.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re going to talk about happiness,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only fair, only accurate,</p>
<p>and frankly, only respectful</p>
<p>to talk about living requirements</p>
<p>and cost of living requirements</p>
<p>that includes this sort of buffer</p>
<p>and that that buffer to anxiety is going to vary</p>
<p>depending on how anxious somebody gets</p>
<p>about the possibility of catastrophic things</p>
<p>happening to them, like losing their job</p>
<p>or their rent going up or doubling.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m talking about hypotheticals,</p>
<p>but I think we all know people</p>
<p>and perhaps ourselves have experienced</p>
<p>those kinds of circumstances.</p>
<p>So when we talk about happiness,</p>
<p>we absolutely need to think about resources</p>
<p>and we also need to think about performance.</p>
<p>I think we would be completely inaccurate</p>
<p>if we simply said, oh, you know,</p>
<p>any work leading to any outcomes, you know,</p>
<p>any effort, regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>it gets you an A in school or an F in school</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to impact your happiness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone would agree with that.</p>
<p>And yet, if you look at the major takeaways,</p>
<p>at least as they are communicated,</p>
<p>typically in the public sphere around the longitudinal</p>
<p>and short-term studies of happiness,</p>
<p>the takeaway generally is more focused on social connection</p>
<p>and how money is not important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone that&rsquo;s saying that</p>
<p>actually means that income that can cover your expenses</p>
<p>plus some buffer isn&rsquo;t important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often not stated.</p>
<p>So if we were to come up with a general model of happiness</p>
<p>that includes various tools</p>
<p>for how to increase our levels of happiness,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only fair to include</p>
<p>both natural and synthetic forms of happiness</p>
<p>and to pursue both natural and synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, natural happiness</p>
<p>is the kind of happiness that we associate</p>
<p>with obtaining something either by effort</p>
<p>or because it was given to us.</p>
<p>Although I definitely want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that receiving things that don&rsquo;t require much reward</p>
<p>in order to receive them over time</p>
<p>can be detrimental to our dopamine system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important aside.</p>
<p>The other form of happiness is the form of happiness</p>
<p>that we call synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>which is for instance, focusing on social connection.</p>
<p>And we talked about ways to do that</p>
<p>as a means to enhance your happiness, right?</p>
<p>Again, the language, the name synthetic happiness</p>
<p>implies something kind of artificial,</p>
<p>but frankly, genuine social connection is genuine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing artificial about it or synthetic about it</p>
<p>is that you can synthesize it through action,</p>
<p>through deliberate action.</p>
<p>Likewise, being focused or encouraging yourself,</p>
<p>working on being focused on whatever activities</p>
<p>you happen to be engaged in, positive or negative,</p>
<p>is known to increase your levels of happiness.</p>
<p>Again, this is a form of synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not obtaining anything new or additional</p>
<p>as a consequence of this, it&rsquo;s entirely internal, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no external reward.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t more money that arrives with this</p>
<p>or a better grade.</p>
<p>Although I would make the argument</p>
<p>that if you are present to the work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in any context, physical or mental work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that you are going to perform better</p>
<p>at that work.</p>
<p>So we have natural happiness and synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>and both of them require our attention and effort.</p>
<p>And in fact, if we were to draw a link</p>
<p>between natural and synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>it really is this concept of presence,</p>
<p>of really being focused on what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most likely to lead to the outcomes that we want,</p>
<p>both externally in terms of receiving monetary rewards</p>
<p>or grades or praise or whatever it is</p>
<p>that you happen to be pursuing out there,</p>
<p>resources of some kind,</p>
<p>and presence and striving to be present</p>
<p>when in the pursuit of so-called synthetic happiness</p>
<p>in the form of social connection</p>
<p>or in the form of really focusing on the choice</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve made and making the best of that choice,</p>
<p>especially since you made that choice</p>
<p>in a way that you deemed best at the time,</p>
<p>well, that also is known to increase</p>
<p>your overall levels of happiness.</p>
<p>So if an ability to focus and attend to things deeply</p>
<p>is really what&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>and really acts as the greatest lever</p>
<p>for both natural and synthetic happiness,</p>
<p>well, then tools like a five-minute daily meditation</p>
<p>or a 13-minute a day meditation,</p>
<p>as well as tools that allow us</p>
<p>to get excellent sleep every night,</p>
<p>which of course sets the basis for attention during the day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>then you are very familiar with how hard it is</p>
<p>to focus the following day,</p>
<p>at least for long periods of time.</p>
<p>But building our capacity to focus</p>
<p>through a focusing exercise,</p>
<p>which again is often called meditation,</p>
<p>but is really simply just a focusing</p>
<p>and perceptual exercise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create an outsize effect</p>
<p>on all the aspects, all the behaviors</p>
<p>that we know feed into creating natural</p>
<p>and synthetic happiness.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really fair to say</p>
<p>that our ability to attend and focus</p>
<p>really equates to happiness.</p>
<p>So as is often typical of this podcast,</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the various aspects</p>
<p>of the science of happiness,</p>
<p>including the different forms of happiness</p>
<p>and tools to access those different forms of happiness.</p>
