    <p>Our card this week is Cindy Elias, the Six of Diamonds from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Cindy was a 19-year-old college student enjoying a night out with friends when she made the</p>
<p>decision to get into someone&rsquo;s car, a decision that would change the course of her life and</p>
<p>leave homicide detectives in Minnesota searching for answers for 45 years.</p>
<p>To this day, her story remains the oldest unsolved case in the state, but efforts to</p>
<p>get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding her death have not stopped, and they will</p>
<p>not stop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The DAC.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of Thursday, March 24th, 1977, a man named Robert Johnson was driving</p>
<p>home from work in Aurora, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Even though it was the end of March, winter was still hanging on in Aurora, and there</p>
<p>was a fresh dusting of snow covering the fields, trees, and freshly cut logs on either side</p>
<p>of the roadway.</p>
<p>As Robert was driving, he had his eyes peeled because the day before, a neighbor&rsquo;s dog</p>
<p>had gotten loose and still hadn&rsquo;t made its way back home.</p>
<p>Robert was looking for the dog, though he figured with the low overnight temperatures,</p>
<p>it would be surprising if the dog had survived the harsh weather.</p>
<p>And right as he was thinking that, something caught his eye.</p>
<p>He spotted a trail of dark red stains in the snow on the road up ahead of his car, and</p>
<p>his first thought was maybe the dog hadn&rsquo;t succumbed to the weather at all, maybe it</p>
<p>had been hit by a car.</p>
<p>So Robert pulled over and got out to take a closer look.</p>
<p>As he moved closer, the only thing he could think was, if it wasn&rsquo;t the dog, then maybe</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d stumbled on a deer poaching scene.</p>
<p>Illegally killing deer from roads in Midwestern states, especially rural areas, is common.</p>
<p>Robert followed the blood trail about 30 steps from the edge of the road, expecting to come</p>
<p>across remains of a dead animal.</p>
<p>And sure enough, when he reached the end of the trail, he found a bone.</p>
<p>Now Robert couldn&rsquo;t tell just from looking at it exactly what kind of bone it was, but</p>
<p>the scene was fresh enough that he felt that he needed to go back home and call the local</p>
<p>game warden, a man named Jim Gawboy, to report what he&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>Within an hour, Robert met Jim back at the scene and pointed out the blood and the bone.</p>
<p>Jim looked surprised.</p>
<p>He said he wasn&rsquo;t sure if the bone belonged to an animal or not, so he carefully collected</p>
<p>it and took it to the local hospital to have a physician look at it.</p>
<p>A doctor examined the bone and said that it looked like a fragment of human skull, not</p>
<p>something from an animal.</p>
<p>That finding stunned Jim, so he immediately notified the St. Louis County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>and said he&rsquo;d meet deputies back out at the scene so they could investigate further.</p>
<p>He notified the county coroner too, in case the bone was in fact the partial remains of</p>
<p>a person.</p>
<p>St. Louis County Supervising Deputy Nate Skelton said it took a while for everyone to reconvene</p>
<p>at the scene because it was in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>There was nothing sparsely populated outside of the cities.</p>
<p>There was people who had property and had farms and country living, if you will, but</p>
<p>pretty remote for the most part.</p>
<p>So I mean, we&rsquo;re talking miles from something else there.</p>
<p>Once everyone got to the area, they started examining the blood spots Robert had initially</p>
<p>found in the snowy roadway, and they followed the trail of blood onto a logging road that</p>
<p>had been cut in order for nearby lumber operations to access timber further back with big trucks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to visualize the scene, picture downed trees and brush along with</p>
<p>some trees that were still standing on either side of a freshly cut logging road that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any pavement or gravel or anything.</p>
<p>With so much loose brush and random pieces of wood scattered everywhere, deputies weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even sure if they would find whatever it was that the skull fragment belonged to.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even certain of what they were searching for, so they kept their eyes peeled</p>
<p>for signs of both animal and possibly human remains.</p>
<p>The one thing that helped them was the fact that the blood spots and the skull fragment</p>
<p>looked fresh, so they knew that whatever they&rsquo;d come across would more than likely be obvious.</p>
<p>After a few hours of combing through underbrush, logs, and trees, authorities found what they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been looking for, and the reality of the situation took a very dark turn.</p>
<p>Deputies spotted what looked like a clump of blonde hair on the ground, sticking out</p>
<p>from underneath some layers of timber brush.</p>
<p>Under that timber pile was a woman&rsquo;s lifeless body.</p>
<p>Like hastily thrown under a pile of brush, just covered up best they could.</p>
<p>The victim had been badly beaten in the head, hard enough for part of her skull to break</p>
<p>off and land closer to the main road.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t look as if she&rsquo;d been there long, because there was still fresh blood</p>
<p>around her, and there were no signs of decomposition.</p>
<p>Investigators felt in their guts that whatever had happened to this woman had likely happened</p>
<p>just hours before Robert came driving along and found that first bone fragment.</p>
<p>More than likely, she&rsquo;d been killed sometime in the last 10 to 15 hours, and then hidden</p>
<p>off the remote logging road.</p>
<p>An obvious sign that she was from the area was that she was clothed in a winter coat</p>
<p>and pants, attire you&rsquo;d normally expect someone to dress in during the spring in northern</p>
<p>Minnesota.</p>
<p>As the coroner prepared to transport the woman&rsquo;s body for autopsy, deputies collected other</p>
<p>items that they felt could be potential evidence, and they looked for more clues that might</p>
<p>have told them who she was, but those things were hard to come by.</p>
<p>For one, the woman had no personal belongings on her or near her body.</p>
<p>No wallet, no keys, no ID, nothing.</p>
<p>And her shoes were even missing.</p>
<p>At first glance, the only thing detectives could really determine was that she was a</p>
<p>young adult with a light complexion and long blonde hair.</p>
<p>Beyond that, her identity was a complete mystery.</p>
<p>Now, since there was that fresh layer of snow on the ground, investigators looked for sets</p>
<p>of footprints or even tire tracks leading to or from her body, but they didn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>any.</p>
<p>The lack of any tracks made them think that the snow had fallen after she was killed and</p>
<p>stuffed under that brush pile.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene and removing the body, deputies did a grid search with hopes</p>
<p>of finding a weapon or something that could have done that kind of damage that the woman</p>
<p>had sustained, but they didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>But there was no doubt in their minds that this young woman had been murdered, just based</p>
<p>off the severity of her injuries.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Skelton again.</p>
<p>It was something heavy and, you know, maybe a metal bar or a bat or, you know, you can</p>
<p>speculate all day long. It&rsquo;s something that can do that type of damage and blunt force</p>
<p>trauma. But there was nothing that was left behind.</p>
<p>St. Louis County investigators were anxious to find out who the woman was so they could</p>
<p>launch an investigation and get whoever had done this behind bars.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t used to working murders, though.</p>
<p>St. Louis County is a rural area.</p>
<p>Even today, it hasn&rsquo;t changed a whole lot since 1977.</p>
<p>There are just a few small towns scattered about, and back in the 70s, the most common</p>
<p>calls to police were to break up bar fights.</p>
<p>So they knew that they needed their best people and they needed them to work quickly.</p>
<p>One thing that stuck out right away to investigators, even while they&rsquo;d been at the scene, was</p>
<p>the location of where the victim had been dumped.</p>
<p>You see, you had to want to go that way to end up there.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a heavily used thoroughfare for anyone except log truck drivers.</p>
<p>While they waited for the coroner to ID the victim, deputies canvassed the area to see</p>
<p>if people who live remotely close to it saw anything suspicious earlier in the day or</p>
<p>the night before.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t many houses nearby, though, so door knocking wasn&rsquo;t really an option.</p>
<p>After getting nowhere with that, police interviewed Robert Johnson, the man who first called in</p>
<p>the scene to the game warden as a possible poaching incident.</p>
<p>But Robert didn&rsquo;t have much to tell authorities.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;d just been driving his usual route home from work when he saw the blood</p>
<p>spots on the roadway and then the bone.</p>
<p>He swore to police he never saw the body of the victim.</p>
<p>When police revealed more information to him, Robert seemed genuinely shocked to find out</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;d actually stumbled upon.</p>
<p>With nothing further coming from Robert, deputies decided to stay posted up at the</p>
<p>edge of the logging road all night, just in case whoever killed the woman decided to come</p>
<p>back and finish burying her.</p>
<p>But that was a bust because there wasn&rsquo;t any unusual activity overnight at the scene.</p>
<p>The next day, Friday, March 25th, while deputies continued to work around the logging road</p>
<p>and waited to find out more information from the coroner, a call came in.</p>
<p>A woman wanted to report to the St. Louis County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office that her sister,</p>
<p>Cindy Elias, was missing and their whole family was worried about her.</p>
<p>According to information Cindy&rsquo;s family had gotten from Cindy&rsquo;s classmates and friends</p>
<p>at the local community college she attended, the last time anyone saw Cindy had been on</p>
<p>Wednesday night in the nearby town of Virginia, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Virginia is a small town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just maybe 15 minutes south of where Cindy lived in Britt and 15 minutes west of</p>
<p>Aurora, where the unidentified remains had just been found.</p>
<p>Cindy&rsquo;s friends had told her family that when they&rsquo;d last seen Cindy, she was kind of tipsy</p>
<p>and had attempted to hitchhike home from a bar in downtown Virginia.</p>
<p>Based on what Cindy&rsquo;s family told police, Cindy never came home Wednesday night.</p>
<p>No one had contact with her after she left her friends and no one had spoken to her at</p>
<p>all on Thursday the 24th.</p>
<p>Now, the investigator who took the missing persons report knew about the woman&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>that had been found in Aurora, so he asked Cindy&rsquo;s sister how old Cindy was, what did</p>
<p>she look like, and what she might have been wearing on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Her sister said that Cindy was 19 years old and she had blonde hair.</p>
<p>By this point, authorities were pretty certain they knew where Cindy was.</p>
<p>So they had Cindy&rsquo;s family members come down to the coroner&rsquo;s office to take a look at</p>
<p>the deceased woman&rsquo;s body and right away they confirmed her ID.</p>
<p>Cindy&rsquo;s family was distraught, but police couldn&rsquo;t hold off questioning them.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time figuring out everything they could about the 19-year-old</p>
<p>and most importantly, what she&rsquo;d been up to the night before she died.</p>
<p>What they learned was that Cindy lived at her dad&rsquo;s house in Britt with her siblings.</p>
<p>Now prior to the early 1970s, the kids had actually lived in California with their mom,</p>
<p>but after Cindy and another sibling graduated from high school, the siblings packed up and</p>
<p>moved to Minnesota to be with their dad.</p>
<p>They learned that she was working as a waitress there while taking classes at the local community</p>
<p>college.</p>
<p>Like a lot of homicide investigations, police started trying to identify potential suspects</p>
<p>who might be closer to home.</p>
<p>You know, a friend, a family member, or an ex-boyfriend, something like that.</p>
<p>Who would do something like this and why?</p>
<p>Is it opportunistic?</p>
<p>Is it someone that knew of her or had it out for her?</p>
<p>But all the information we have is that she didn&rsquo;t really have too many enemies from what</p>
<p>we could find.</p>
<p>There was no one that really had any beef or issue or something to go along with her</p>
<p>that would go along, do something like this.</p>
<p>Her siblings told police that the last time they saw Cindy was on Wednesday when she was</p>
<p>headed to Klocken for her waitressing shift at the cafe where she worked.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t sure what time Cindy was scheduled to work or whether or not she also had college</p>
<p>classes that day.</p>
<p>Her family members said that she&rsquo;d gone out with friends to some bars in Virginia, but</p>
<p>beyond that, they had no clue where she was.</p>
<p>Now, it is important to note that the drinking age actually didn&rsquo;t change to 21 until years</p>
<p>later in Minnesota.</p>
<p>So back then, Cindy going out at 19 was actually totally normal.</p>
<p>She could drink legally.</p>
<p>Cindy&rsquo;s sister Judy, who was one of the siblings closest to her, gave deputies a few names</p>
<p>of people that Cindy might have been out with at the bars.</p>
<p>First up was Cindy&rsquo;s friend, Connie.</p>
<p>When investigators tracked her down, Connie told them that, yes, she had seen Cindy Wednesday</p>
<p>night and the two of them had been out together.</p>
<p>Connie said that the last place they&rsquo;d been before closing time was this bar on Chestnut</p>
<p>Street called Sammy&rsquo;s Bar.</p>
<p>Connie told police that everywhere she and Cindy had been on Wednesday night had been</p>
<p>pretty busy, which made for a good time.</p>
<p>At no point during the night, though, had Connie noticed Cindy acting sad or even strange</p>
<p>in any way.</p>
<p>Connie said that she headed home around midnight and Cindy stayed at the bar with a couple</p>
<p>of guys that they&rsquo;d been bar hopping with.</p>
<p>Connie said that she remembered Cindy was a little drunk, but she assured her friend</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t need to worry about her and she&rsquo;d be fine and she&rsquo;d get a ride home.</p>
<p>She said she was tough.</p>
<p>You know, she was like basically for a 19 year old kid in there.</p>
<p>She was tough as they come, could take care of herself, didn&rsquo;t really need or ask for</p>
<p>a lot of help, but did her own thing, did it the way she wanted to do it.</p>
<p>And that was just, that was her personality.</p>
<p>And by all indications, even talking to friends and people who knew her, they kind of had</p>
<p>that same recollection of her.</p>
<p>Deputies followed up on Connie&rsquo;s statement and they went to Sammy&rsquo;s Bar to interview</p>
<p>employees.</p>
<p>A bartender named Thomas told police that he remembered seeing Cindy at the bar late</p>
<p>Wednesday night, drinking and dancing with friends.</p>
<p>Just like Connie had remembered, he said, by the looks of everything going on that night,</p>
<p>Cindy seemed to be having a good time.</p>
<p>She was talking with a lot of different people.</p>
<p>A cocktail waitress named Rebecca told the exact same thing to police.</p>
<p>And she added that the last time she remembered seeing Cindy inside the bar was just after</p>
<p>midnight, maybe about 1215 or 1230.</p>
<p>Rebecca said that Cindy was standing near the front talking to someone, but she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember who.</p>
<p>Rebecca and Thomas both said that they didn&rsquo;t really know Cindy very well, but they knew</p>
<p>that she was a regular customer.</p>
<p>Most of their customers were men, so they said Cindy and Connie being at the bar on</p>
<p>Wednesday night stuck out to them.</p>
<p>They were two of only a few women there.</p>
<p>The bar employees gave police several names of regular customers that they could interview,</p>
<p>which led deputies to a guy named Joseph.</p>
<p>And when they talked to Joseph, he said, oh, Cindy, well, that&rsquo;s the blonde girl I danced</p>
<p>with at Sammy&rsquo;s Bar.</p>
<p>This piqued investigators interest, but Joseph said that Cindy was so drunk she was stumbling</p>
<p>all over the dance floor.</p>
<p>He said Cindy asked him for a ride home sometime after midnight, but he told her he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a car.</p>
<p>Then he went and met up with another girl, and that woman confirmed for police that she</p>
<p>and Joseph went back to her place, made some food around 1.30 in the morning, and went</p>
<p>to bed.</p>
<p>Deputies noted that as a solid alibi for Joseph.</p>
<p>So next, deputies really wanted to talk to the two guys Connie mentioned that she and</p>
<p>Cindy had been hanging out with.</p>
<p>And luckily, both men agreed to be interviewed.</p>
<p>The first was a local man named Donald.</p>
<p>And he said that he and his friend Eric met up Wednesday afternoon at a music shop in</p>
<p>Virginia where they both bought a record before going to the El Dorado bar.</p>
<p>When they left the El Dorado, he said that they headed towards some other bars on Chestnut</p>
<p>Street and eventually ended up meeting Cindy and Connie, who were also walking down the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>The group were all kind of like friends of friends from the area.</p>
<p>She spent a lot of time in the bars downtown in the city of Virginia, which at that time</p>
<p>was basically a mining boom because they were building a couple of new mines in the area.</p>
<p>There was a lot of construction jobs in place, a lot of like a big influx of people and construction</p>
<p>workers and laborers in the area at that time.</p>
<p>So it was, I don&rsquo;t know, the analogy that people use a lot of time was the Chestnut</p>
<p>Street in the city of Virginia was kind of like a little bit like the Wild West.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on and a lot of bars and a lot of people coming and</p>
<p>going.</p>
<p>Donald, Eric, Connie and Cindy went to Sammy&rsquo;s bar together.</p>
<p>They grabbed some drinks and they sat at a booth.</p>
<p>Donald remembered Cindy and his friend Eric chatting about California because that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>where Eric had grown up and where Cindy had gone to high school.</p>
<p>He recalled that out of all four of them, Cindy and Eric were the drunkest.</p>
<p>Donald said that they all hung out and eventually Connie said that she was leaving and</p>
<p>mentioned that she was going to walk home.</p>
<p>He thought it was maybe around midnight when Connie left.</p>
<p>So Donald said that he, Eric and Cindy then left the bar to go to a nearby strip club.</p>
<p>But Cindy didn&rsquo;t want to be seen going in, so she insisted that they use the back door.</p>
<p>But Donald said that Cindy actually fell down and got her white pants dirty.</p>
<p>So instead of going inside, they stood in the back alley and just talked for a while.</p>
<p>Donald said that after that, they all started making plans to go home.</p>
<p>At the time, Donald didn&rsquo;t have a car and Eric was in no shape to drive, so Cindy mentioned</p>
<p>that she might just try her luck at thumbing it on the side of the road.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one specific person who was, I don&rsquo;t think was actually the last person to</p>
<p>see her, but the eyewitness according to that one said about 1230 a.m. they saw her.</p>
<p>She was looking for a ride and mentioned she was going to hitchhike.</p>
<p>Police pressed Donald for more information about what happened after he, Eric and Cindy</p>
<p>parted ways.</p>
<p>Instead, he said that he just went home to his parents&rsquo; house, made some food and went</p>
<p>to bed.</p>
<p>He also noted that while making food, he saw Eric arrive home to his apartment because</p>
<p>he could actually see Eric&rsquo;s place from his parents&rsquo; kitchen window.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what time it was when he spotted Eric, but it looked like Eric was alone when</p>
<p>he got home.</p>
<p>Deputies worked to confirm Donald&rsquo;s story by talking to the guy he got a ride with,</p>
<p>Randy.</p>
<p>And Randy confirmed that he&rsquo;d given Donald a ride home late Wednesday night.</p>
<p>His parents, however, couldn&rsquo;t vouch for him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d been sound asleep when he reportedly arrived back.</p>
<p>He kind of had an alibi, I guess, if you will, but we&rsquo;ve got no physical evidence to prove</p>
<p>that he or, you know, are there at that point, but they were together that night.</p>
<p>We censored Deputy Skelton because he actually called Eric by his last name and we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>using his first name in this episode.</p>
<p>Anyway, Donald told investigators that he didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with Cindy&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He had only met her a few times.</p>
<p>Police had to accept that for the time being because they didn&rsquo;t have anything further</p>
<p>to keep Donald on at the police station.</p>
<p>The next person police interrogated was Eric.</p>
<p>He told police a similar story as Donald, but with fewer details.</p>
<p>He admitted that he was drunk Wednesday night and he didn&rsquo;t remember much.</p>
<p>All he said that he did remember was Cindy asking everyone with an earshot for a ride</p>
<p>home, but that none of them had a car.</p>
<p>Now Eric was working construction in the area at the time and lived with his girlfriend</p>
<p>Terri in Virginia.</p>
<p>Terri was at work Wednesday night, so she wasn&rsquo;t out at the bars with the group, but</p>
<p>Terri confirmed for deputies that Eric had come home late Wednesday night, just like</p>
<p>Donald had said.</p>
<p>Eric insisted to them he didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with Cindy&rsquo;s murder, and he said despite</p>
<p>their bonding over their mutual connection to California, he and Cindy didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a relationship.</p>
<p>He said she was just an acquaintance and he was faithful to his girlfriend.</p>
<p>All in all, if police came out of those interviews with any theories on who killed Cindy, they</p>
<p>kept those to themselves.</p>
<p>In a matter of days, news of Cindy&rsquo;s murder hit the local papers.</p>
<p>People living in Aurora and the surrounding areas were shocked.</p>
<p>In a March 29th, 1977 article by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, a headline read,</p>
<p>Help sought in death of Virginia woman.</p>
<p>Police at the time still weren&rsquo;t releasing Cindy&rsquo;s cause of death, but the article went</p>
<p>on to encourage anyone who saw Cindy the day or night before her murder to call police.</p>
<p>Police eventually made their way to the cafe where Cindy was a waitress.</p>
<p>They questioned as many people as they could, wanting to know if she had been acting strange</p>
<p>her last day, or if anyone had seen men who maybe hung around a little too long.</p>
<p>Maybe a regular customer of Cindy&rsquo;s who was creepy.</p>
<p>But co-workers at the diner told police she seemed perfectly fine, and there weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>any oddball customers that stood out.</p>
<p>Her boss said the same thing.</p>
<p>Cindy was a hard worker who always showed up on time and made good tips.</p>
<p>She waited on tables with a smile on her face and was well-liked by her co-workers and customers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, police made little progress in the week after Cindy&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>It seemed like every which way they turned for clues in Cindy&rsquo;s life, they kept hearing</p>
<p>the same things.</p>
<p>No one disliked her.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a boyfriend or any jealous ex-lovers who would want to harm her.</p>
<p>The thought started to creep into some investigators&rsquo; minds that maybe Cindy&rsquo;s killer was long</p>
<p>gone from Minnesota.</p>
<p>A stranger who&rsquo;d just shown up in the small town, picked up Cindy while she was hitchhiking,</p>
<p>killed her, and then took off out of state.</p>
<p>This theory of a random murderer started to feel more and more like a legit possibility</p>
<p>the longer police worked the case.</p>
<p>But the sheriff&rsquo;s office had several interesting calls come in that made them press pause on</p>
<p>that random killer theory.</p>
<p>You see, these tips strongly indicated that Cindy may have had a group of acquaintances</p>
<p>that her family and school friends didn&rsquo;t know anything about.</p>
<p>People who were definitely rough around the edges.</p>
<p>I guess outlaw motorcycle game as a loose term for, you know, northeastern Minnesota,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what I would consider them.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how strong of a foothold they had or what they were, to be brutally</p>
<p>honest.</p>
<p>But I know that they were here and there was a lot of information circling around that</p>
<p>group of people.</p>
<p>Learning that Cindy was friends with several members of a motorcycle gang was a twist investigators</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see coming.</p>
<p>It was surprising to them, and also to Cindy&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>As soon as that information got out, rumors swirled.</p>
<p>And people around town thought, well, it can&rsquo;t be a coincidence that a pretty young</p>
<p>blonde from Brit who hung around with outlaws turned up dead.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just local residents who were talking about this development either.</p>
<p>There was information coming out of the prisons as well, you know, people that are pointing</p>
<p>fingers that direction as well, which is why we, they followed up with it and looked into</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And like I said, it was more, I think I attribute it more to a lot of, they were trying to get</p>
<p>some sort of standing or street cred from this happening and they weren&rsquo;t really taking</p>
<p>credit for it, but they weren&rsquo;t really denying it either.</p>
<p>Whether the information regarding Cindy&rsquo;s connection to members of a motorcycle gang</p>
<p>was just idle chatter perpetuated by inmates or not, this lead sent the investigation in</p>
<p>a new direction.</p>
<p>The St. Louis County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office was familiar with the motorcycle group because</p>
<p>of their members being involved in petty crime in the area.</p>
<p>The deputy skeletons said on a scale between Motorbike Enthusiast Club and Hell&rsquo;s Angels,</p>
<p>this group fell somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>They were feared in the community, but it wasn&rsquo;t like they had a known reputation for</p>
<p>committing violent murders.</p>
<p>Deputies spread out across several towns and rounded up the members one by one.</p>
<p>They all said that they knew Cindy from the bar scene in Virginia, but that&rsquo;s about all</p>
<p>they said.</p>
<p>Some of them even claimed they weren&rsquo;t even in the area the night that Cindy was killed.</p>
<p>And the men said that they viewed Cindy as more of a little sister and she wasn&rsquo;t romantically</p>
<p>attached to any of them.</p>
<p>She was a frequent hitchhiker, so sometimes they would give her rides to work or class</p>
<p>and that was it.</p>
<p>According to Detective Skelton, each of those men cooperated with police when asked, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve always maintained that they had nothing to do with Cindy&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Because no one saw the motorcycle guys at Sammy&rsquo;s bar or even in the area the night</p>
<p>Cindy died, police had to move on from that theory.</p>
<p>But by the time they did, months had gone by and tips stopped coming in.</p>
<p>Looking at this case, I don&rsquo;t think that they really had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>And I think it was a lot of time that we sat and spun our wheels over something that really</p>
<p>had no concrete or no substantial evidentiary value to look into.</p>
<p>By summertime of 1977, the case was stalled.</p>
<p>In a bold move, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office decided to release Cindy&rsquo;s cause of death to the public</p>
<p>to see if that would help drum up any new leads.</p>
<p>It was reported in regional newspapers that Cindy died of blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
<p>But the medical examiner couldn&rsquo;t say exactly what kind of object had been used.</p>
<p>It could have been anything that could be used as a club.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, releasing the cause of death didn&rsquo;t really move the needle.</p>
<p>No new tips came in, and by September, deputies learned that an important witness in the case</p>
<p>had moved away.</p>
<p>Eric left probably six months after she was found.</p>
<p>He moved to Michigan for a short time and then back to California for work.</p>
<p>Police made note of Eric&rsquo;s decision to leave the area, but they didn&rsquo;t have anything tying</p>
<p>him to Cindy&rsquo;s murder, so they left him alone for a while.</p>
<p>Fall turned into winter, and the one-year anniversary of Cindy&rsquo;s murder came and went</p>
<p>without any new information.</p>
<p>As the 90s came, advancements in technology came as well.</p>
<p>Witnesses all over the country that were as old as Cindy&rsquo;s were being solved by new</p>
<p>DNA technology.</p>
<p>And that was an option here.</p>
<p>You see, they&rsquo;d been able to pull a DNA profile off of Cindy&rsquo;s sweater that had</p>
<p>been preserved in evidence.</p>
<p>And now, the St. Louis County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office wanted to revisit some of the old witnesses</p>
<p>and collect DNA samples to see if they could find a match.</p>
<p>Well over a hundred, I think, of people that were involved or that were around or like</p>
<p>we collected samples from everybody, even the friends and whatever, if they were willing</p>
<p>to give one, we collected them all.</p>
<p>So anyone who was mentioned, if we got a lead or a tip on something to say that, you know,</p>
<p>they thought that these people were involved, we would seek them out.</p>
<p>And if they weren&rsquo;t alive, we&rsquo;d find their family and we&rsquo;d collect a known sample from</p>
<p>their family.</p>
<p>Detectives submitted the hundred-some samples they&rsquo;d collected from people for comparison</p>
<p>to her sweater, but unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t get any hits.</p>
<p>No one they&rsquo;d initially interviewed at the start of the investigation showed up as</p>
<p>a match.</p>
<p>Not Robert Johnson, not Donald, not Eric, not Connie.</p>
<p>No one in Cindy&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>The next curveball came in the case in early December 1993.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when a woman in a small town just south of Virginia called Eveleth, Minnesota</p>
<p>went missing.</p>
<p>According to reporting by Brady Slater in the Duluth News Tribune, Luella Letourneau</p>
<p>was last seen on December 13th by her niece.</p>
<p>And then her body was found eight days later in a wooded area known for logging.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been shot, stabbed, and her body was mutilated.</p>
<p>The area Luella was found in wasn&rsquo;t in Aurora like Cindy, but it was in a similar type logging</p>
<p>area just south of there.</p>
<p>The case also fell in the jurisdiction of the St. Louis County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>And as investigators worked the case, they couldn&rsquo;t help but be reminded of Cindy.</p>
<p>There was one major difference though.</p>
<p>In Luella&rsquo;s murder, they had a prime suspect from the get-go because the guy who killed</p>
<p>her actually led police to her body.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Luella had been separated from</p>
<p>her husband Tom when she disappeared.</p>
<p>At the time, the two had been trying to work things out and were considering getting back</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>Before her body was found, Tom told police that a man Luella had been seeing during their</p>
<p>separation, this guy named Richard Little, was not cool with them getting back together,</p>
<p>and he had threatened to quote, skin him alive.</p>
<p>Police talked to Richard, and on December 21st, 1993, he led them to her body and admitted</p>
<p>to stabbing her to death with a fillet knife when she refused to kiss him.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Richard was a logger and a trucker</p>
<p>from the nearby town of Gilbert, Minnesota, and he&rsquo;d been arrested twice in the past</p>
<p>for threatening to kill his then-wife.</p>
<p>In 1994, Richard, who also went by the nickname Dickie, was sentenced to 40 years in prison</p>
<p>for Luella&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>During the investigation, police learned that he&rsquo;d actually killed Luella on a bridge</p>
<p>over the St. Louis River and then taken her body to the logging area where he dumped it.</p>
<p>Luella&rsquo;s murder definitely echoed similarities to Cindy&rsquo;s in a lot of ways, but at the</p>
<p>time of Richard&rsquo;s conviction, police had no solid reason outside of speculation to</p>
<p>suspect that he killed Cindy 16 years before.</p>
<p>Kind of similar, except for he was romantically involved with Luella, and she decided she</p>
<p>was going to go back to her husband, and he wasn&rsquo;t a fan of that and ended up killing</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>By the end of 1994, Richard was in prison, and Cindy&rsquo;s case remained cold.</p>
<p>Years later, in 2003, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and Minnesota Department</p>
<p>of Public Safety announced that they were offering a $50,000 reward for information</p>
<p>leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for killing Cindy.</p>
<p>That announcement garnered some media and community interest in the case.</p>
<p>An April 18, 2003 Minneapolis Star Tribune story featured an interview with Cindy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister, Judy, who said, quote,</p>
<p>It feels like it was yesterday, but it&rsquo;s been 26 years.</p>
<p>The grief and horror have never gone.</p>
<p>Cindy was only 19, and she had her whole life to look forward to, end quote.</p>
<p>But not long after that, in 2004, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension got an interesting</p>
<p>phone call from none other than Richard Little.</p>
<p>Richard called St. Louis County investigators from prison and said that he might have some</p>
<p>information about Cindy&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Two special agents went to Faribault Prison to interview him.</p>
<p>Richard told the investigators that a former inmate named Donnie Miller had something to</p>
<p>do with Cindy&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Donnie was deceased by the time Richard brought his name up to authorities, but he said that</p>
<p>while in prison together, he and Donnie discussed Cindy&rsquo;s murder in detail.</p>
<p>The agents thought it a little convenient, if you will, that of all people, Richard was</p>
<p>the one that had this information.</p>
<p>So while they looked into this story about Donnie, they also asked Richard to supply</p>
<p>his own DNA.</p>
<p>And he agreed.</p>
<p>In 2004, his genetic profile was tested against Cindy&rsquo;s sweater.</p>
<p>And when the results came back, it was a match, but only a partial match.</p>
<p>That meant that the DNA found on Cindy&rsquo;s sweater could have theoretically belonged</p>
<p>to Richard or any man who was his direct relative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a possibility that a male descendant from his lineage left, basically, touched</p>
<p>DNA behind on, basically, on her body.</p>
<p>He had an older brother.</p>
<p>He had four children, two of which were boys.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve ran through all of them, we&rsquo;ve interviewed them all.</p>
<p>Richard told police that he was surprised to learn that a DNA profile closely matching</p>
<p>his was on Cindy&rsquo;s sweater.</p>
<p>He claimed that the only way it could have gotten there must have been from his older</p>
<p>brother, Dave.</p>
<p>Richard always made the point that, you know, his brother was a bad guy and not a very nice</p>
<p>person. And he could have very well done that.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, Richard talked about his brother being a bad guy all while he was sitting in</p>
<p>prison serving time for cold blooded murder.</p>
<p>The irony is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>Anyway, despite police looking closely at Richard&rsquo;s older brother, Dave, and even</p>
<p>speaking with him about Cindy&rsquo;s case, they were unable to chase the lead very far due</p>
<p>to an unanticipated curveball coming their way.</p>
<p>His brother was, I think he was a little older.</p>
<p>His brother&rsquo;s name was Dave.</p>
<p>And we had interviewed him just after we had interviewed Richard at some point, or he</p>
<p>had entered into the equation.</p>
<p>And we went and talked to him and he passed away of a heart attack like literally weeks</p>
<p>after we interviewed him.</p>
<p>Deputy Skelton said they have no way of really knowing if the partial profile was really</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t have his DNA to test.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t rule him out because of the why DNA hit.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have any way to say Dave lived in the area as well.</p>
<p>But his name and anything like that has never come up in anything along those lines.</p>
<p>So the only reason it did is because we got this and Richard Little entered into the</p>
<p>equation. And the reason he fits the mold is because he has already done that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s currently was in prison for doing something very similar.</p>
<p>Deputy Skelton doesn&rsquo;t believe it was Dave&rsquo;s DNA that they found on Cindy, though.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more inclined to think it&rsquo;s Richard&rsquo;s DNA just based on the fact that Richard had</p>
<p>knowledge of the remote logging roads in the area where Cindy was likely picked up and</p>
<p>murdered.</p>
<p>We have the one question that leaves everyone involved.</p>
<p>How did it get there? Who is it?</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t say 100 percent certainty or even, you know, for that matter, to say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>him for sure. That&rsquo;s the problem we run into from the Dickie Little angle.</p>
<p>He was a logger and that&rsquo;s what he did for a living.</p>
<p>So he would have known it.</p>
<p>But like I said, that&rsquo;s why when his information came to light, people were like, yeah,</p>
<p>it makes sense.</p>
<p>Over the years, authorities visited Richard many times in prison to try and get him to</p>
<p>cooperate more.</p>
<p>But it was fruitless.</p>
<p>He adamantly denied any involvement in it.</p>
<p>He said, I didn&rsquo;t have any part of it.</p>
<p>For a period of time, they even monitored his phone calls in prison, hoping to build a</p>
<p>case against him.</p>
<p>But as they listened to more and more of his conversations, they realized that something</p>
<p>fishy was going on between him and a former inmate who was known to be a jailhouse</p>
<p>informant.</p>
<p>The informant would call Richard, feed him information he&rsquo;d heard about Cindy&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>and then the two of them would coordinate plans to try and get the $50,000 reward money.</p>
<p>So they hashed this plan together that we were going to try to figure out or point him</p>
<p>in the right direction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to collect the reward money and split it.</p>
<p>The discovery of this scheme quickly unraveled the case police were trying to build against</p>
<p>Richard from a prosecutorial standpoint.</p>
<p>Richard had no friends in prison.</p>
<p>His family didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have anyone to talk to.</p>
<p>And this guy would call him knowing that I&rsquo;m trying to get this money.</p>
<p>And he basically kind of seemed like he was almost setting him up to take the hit for</p>
<p>it, which he&rsquo;s a very plausible suspect and still remains to be to this day.</p>
<p>But that information kind of muddied the waters a lot, especially with our county attorney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office.</p>
<p>Detectives knew this plan that Richard and the other inmate had hatched to try and get</p>
<p>the reward money would be used by a defense attorney in court if they choose to charge</p>
<p>him with Cindy&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So they never charged him and instead kept investigating to see if they could find any</p>
<p>other evidence linking him or anyone else to Cindy&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Then out of the blue, after the 30th anniversary of Cindy&rsquo;s murder, this would have been in</p>
<p>2008, the sheriff&rsquo;s office got a call from someone saying they&rsquo;d heard Cindy had actually</p>
<p>been shot before she was beaten.</p>
<p>Investigators thought it would be unlikely that the coroner, even back in the 70s, would</p>
<p>miss a gunshot wound during an autopsy.</p>
<p>But just to double check, they got permission from Cindy&rsquo;s family to exhume her remains.</p>
<p>But the second examination of Cindy&rsquo;s remains using modern technology resulted in the same</p>
<p>findings as before.</p>
<p>There was no doubt Cindy&rsquo;s cause of death, blunt force trauma to the head, was accurate.</p>
<p>There were no signs that she&rsquo;d suffered from a gunshot wound.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really pan out for a whole lot of anything physical evidence-wise, or all</p>
<p>it did was kind of eliminate that thing and say, well, we couldn&rsquo;t prove in the information</p>
<p>we had that she&rsquo;d been shot.</p>
<p>It was not accurate.</p>
<p>The investigation into Cindy&rsquo;s murder stayed cold after that.</p>
<p>And in 2016, Richard Little died in prison.</p>
<p>He never confessed Cindy&rsquo;s murder, but his daughter talked to the Duluth News Tribune</p>
<p>after his death and said that she was convinced her dad killed Cindy simply because he was</p>
<p>an awful person.</p>
<p>Three years later, in the summer of 2019, Deputy Skelton and another detective re-interviewed</p>
<p>Eric, one of the original witnesses from the night Cindy was killed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been out to California.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve interviewed him a couple of times, and he was a heavy drinker at the time.</p>
<p>And he basically doesn&rsquo;t recall a whole lot from back then, which I guess is not too odd.</p>
<p>But I mean, if something or you were involved in something as heinous as this, you would</p>
<p>probably have that somewhere in your brain, and it would come out at some point, being</p>
<p>40-some years later.</p>
<p>I wish I had more information or some insight or a crystal ball to go back and say, hey,</p>
<p>what exactly took place here?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s frustrating, even for the family, because they know we&rsquo;ve been doing what we</p>
<p>can, and they do what they can on a yearly basis, trying to figure things out, too.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just trying to get some closure for him to figure this out.</p>
<p>In September 2021, just last year, Eric&rsquo;s friend Donald died.</p>
<p>Despite his DNA not being on Cindy&rsquo;s sweater, Donald had always remained a loose person</p>
<p>of interest in Cindy&rsquo;s death because, according to investigators, every time he was interviewed,</p>
<p>his story changed slightly.</p>
<p>For example, in 2008, Donald was re-interviewed, and he changed his story about seeing Eric</p>
<p>come home.</p>
<p>His second version of events was that he&rsquo;d gotten home, made food, watched the Johnny</p>
<p>Carson show, and then went to bed.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t mention anything about seeing Eric arrive at his apartment across the street.</p>
<p>And Eric later told police that Donald couldn&rsquo;t have even seen his apartment from his parents'</p>
<p>kitchen window anyway, like Donald originally stated.</p>
<p>So why would Donald lie about that?</p>
<p>In 2018, Donald was interviewed again, and during that conversation, his story was super</p>
<p>detailed, like more so than even his original statement from 1977.</p>
<p>Detectives said it almost seemed as if Donald was beefing up his story to sound better or</p>
<p>for entertainment value.</p>
<p>In this follow-up, Donald told police he remembered going over to Eric&rsquo;s house and Cindy and</p>
<p>Connie coming over there before they all went to the bars.</p>
<p>Donald said that he remembered them walking to the bars, and he was jumping in ice puddles</p>
<p>and trying to splash the girls.</p>
<p>He was very, very poignant and very vivid about some stuff he would talk about and other</p>
<p>stuff that would change over time.</p>
<p>But just like Eric, Donald&rsquo;s DNA was never found on Cindy or at the crime scene, and</p>
<p>he willingly submitted his sample for testing.</p>
<p>So with those leads exhausted, the best bet police have for solving Cindy&rsquo;s murder is</p>
<p>by getting a better analysis of the DNA samples that they&rsquo;ve retrieved from Cindy&rsquo;s sweater.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying.</p>
<p>And we just recently have actually resubmitted some of the physical evidence we have with</p>
<p>advancements because smaller and smaller samples of DNA have been tested as of lately to say</p>
<p>that, yeah, we might be able to get a positive profile match with a smaller sample.</p>
<p>Being the length that the case has been there, I mean, it&rsquo;s been 44 years, so we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to figure out how we can figure something out here because obviously a lot of the people</p>
<p>and a lot of the players are all either dying or not with us anymore.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with it.</p>
<p>In the last 15 years, it&rsquo;s moved way closer to possibly having some sort of disposition</p>
<p>or outcome to get some closure for the family than it&rsquo;s ever been before.</p>
<p>Investigators and Cindy&rsquo;s family members remain hopeful that someday they&rsquo;ll know who</p>
<p>took her life and why she was killed.</p>
<p>Speculation on my part, and that&rsquo;s speculation at best.</p>
<p>I think she did just what she was saying she was doing.</p>
<p>She was looking for a ride and somebody picked her up and it was an opportunity.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if she wouldn&rsquo;t do what she was asked to do or if she was asked to</p>
<p>do something she wasn&rsquo;t willing to do.</p>
<p>And whoever they, he, she, whoever she was with, or they tried to do something and weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to and did what they did.</p>
<p>So maybe a gross overreaction or something along those lines, or I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it kind of leads me to believe that that&rsquo;s kind of exactly how it played out.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a matter of who.</p>
<p>Like who picked her up?</p>
<p>Where did she go and why?</p>
<p>If DNA fails to provide answers, the hope of solving Cindy&rsquo;s murder lies with the</p>
<p>public.</p>
<p>Someone who knows something that can finally connect one of their suspects to this case.</p>
<p>Or maybe someone who might be able to provide information that is brand new for investigators</p>
<p>and points them in an entirely new direction.</p>
<p>Either way, finding justice for Cindy Elias is paramount for St.</p>
<p>Louis County investigators who have never stopped trying to identify the monster who</p>
<p>brutally bludgeoned her to death in March of 1977 and who has gotten away with it for</p>
<p>45 years.</p>
<p>If you know anything that might help investigators, please call the St.</p>
<p>Louis County, Minnesota Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 218-471-7134.</p>
<p>Help them close Minnesota&rsquo;s oldest cold case.</p>
