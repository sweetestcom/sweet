    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today marks the second episode in the six episode series</p>
<p>with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton</p>
<p>and one of the foremost world&rsquo;s experts</p>
<p>on the science and applications of methods</p>
<p>to increase strength, hypertrophy, and endurance.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is all about how to increase strength,</p>
<p>speed, and hypertrophy of muscles.</p>
<p>Professor, Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.</p>
<p>Last episode, you told us about the nine specific adaptations</p>
<p>that exercise can induce,</p>
<p>everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance,</p>
<p>muscular endurance, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And you gave us this incredible toolkit of fit tests</p>
<p>for each of those adaptations</p>
<p>so that people can assess them for themselves.</p>
<p>And then of course, improve on each and every one of them</p>
<p>if they choose.</p>
<p>By the way, people can access that information</p>
<p>simply by going to the first episode</p>
<p>in this series with you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all there in timestamped,</p>
<p>and I highly recommend people do that.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking about strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And so right out the gate, I just wanna ask you,</p>
<p>why should people think about</p>
<p>and train for strength and hypertrophy?</p>
<p>And that question is, of course, directed towards those</p>
<p>that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles.</p>
<p>But I know that many people out there perhaps</p>
<p>have not thought about the benefits</p>
<p>of strength and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>and how beneficial it can be,</p>
<p>not just for people that wanna get bigger biceps, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that have other goals, longevity goals and health goals</p>
<p>unrelated to what most people associate with hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So what are the benefits of training</p>
<p>for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person,</p>
<p>for the athlete, for the recreational exerciser, and so on?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful saying,</p>
<p>I think it was Bill Bowerman,</p>
<p>one of the founders of Nike.</p>
<p>And he always said, if you have a body, you&rsquo;re an athlete.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very important for people to understand</p>
<p>because one of the major disservices we&rsquo;ve done in this field</p>
<p>is convince people that things like strength training</p>
<p>are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles.</p>
<p>And cardiovascular training</p>
<p>are for things like fat loss and heart health.</p>
<p>And that is a tremendous disservice</p>
<p>because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers</p>
<p>and leads to a lot of false assumptions</p>
<p>and therefore poor actions.</p>
<p>Classic examples of this are people who are resistant</p>
<p>to strength training</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t wanna put on too much muscle.</p>
<p>People who only perform one type of exercise</p>
<p>because they want, say, fat loss</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re in it for longevity and health,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not worried about being an athlete.</p>
<p>And so right out the gates,</p>
<p>we can actually draw back a little bit</p>
<p>to what we were, our previous conversation</p>
<p>when I walked you through the history of exercise science.</p>
<p>And the reason I did that is to help you understand</p>
<p>these are the railroads that you&rsquo;re running down</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even realize it.</p>
<p>In terms of everyone thinks of strength training</p>
<p>and they immediately default to our principles</p>
<p>to optimize muscle growth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only adaptation</p>
<p>one should be after with strength training.</p>
<p>When we think of endurance training,</p>
<p>we immediately default to things like,</p>
<p>again, cardiovascular health or fat loss or things like that.</p>
<p>What I really wanna do across this entire series</p>
<p>and conversations is to just break that immediately.</p>
<p>Talk about all the other things</p>
<p>that you can do with your training.</p>
<p>And so that people can be comfortable and confident</p>
<p>in doing an optimal training program</p>
<p>for whatever goal they have,</p>
<p>whether that be specific like growing muscle</p>
<p>or non-specific like just feeling better,</p>
<p>having more energy,</p>
<p>being more prepared for life and longevity.</p>
<p>And so to directly answer your question,</p>
<p>we could do a hundred episodes on the benefits of exercise</p>
<p>and we could run all the way from mood</p>
<p>and focus, cognitive tasks to a better immune function.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get less colds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll fight them off more effectively to mortality.</p>
<p>So some of the strongest predictors of how long</p>
<p>and how well you will live are exercise.</p>
<p>However, there are independent benefits</p>
<p>that come from just endurance training</p>
<p>and there are independent benefits</p>
<p>that come from strength training.</p>
<p>And so to just give you one categorically,</p>
<p>the way that you wanna think about this</p>
<p>is resistance exercise and strength training</p>
<p>is the number one tool to combat neuromuscular aging.</p>
<p>You cannot get that through any other form of exercise</p>
<p>besides heavy overload strength training.</p>
<p>And we can walk through in detail what that is,</p>
<p>but that is reason number one.</p>
<p>In general, human movement is a function of number one,</p>
<p>some sort of neuromuscular activation.</p>
<p>So nerves have to turn on.</p>
<p>The second part is muscles have to contract.</p>
<p>And the third part is those muscles have to move a bone.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If you want to be alive and you want to live by yourself,</p>
<p>you have to be able to engage in human movement.</p>
<p>If you have any dysfunction</p>
<p>in the neuromuscular system there,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to do that.</p>
<p>And again, as I mentioned, the only way to preserve that</p>
<p>or fight that loss of aging is to strength train.</p>
<p>So people will tend to hear numbers</p>
<p>like you lose about 1% of muscle size per year</p>
<p>after age about 40.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>However, what they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is you lose about two to 4% of your strength per year.</p>
<p>So the loss of strength is almost double</p>
<p>that the loss of muscle mass with aging.</p>
<p>Muscle power is more like eight to 10% per year.</p>
<p>And so we can very clearly see the problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have with aging</p>
<p>is not going to be preservation of muscle,</p>
<p>although that is incredibly important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very specifically</p>
<p>preservation of muscle power and strength.</p>
<p>And why that really matters</p>
<p>is your ability to, again, stand up and move,</p>
<p>your ability to catch yourself from a fall,</p>
<p>your ability to feel confident doing a movement.</p>
<p>That is a function of muscle power</p>
<p>more than it is muscle size.</p>
<p>And so functionality is really what we wanna be, right?</p>
<p>You want to be able to do</p>
<p>whatever you want to do physically</p>
<p>and feel confident in doing that as you age.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to only be obtained through strength training.</p>
<p>So is it appropriate to say</p>
<p>that training for strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>is also a way to keep your nervous system healthy and young?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It is the only exercise route we have for that.</p>
<p>If you look at just basic numbers like motor units,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see that older individuals</p>
<p>have like a 30 to 40% reduction in total motor units.</p>
<p>So when you say older,</p>
<p>approximately what ages are you referring to?</p>
<p>Because I know many people out there, such as myself,</p>
<p>are 40 and older,</p>
<p>but I know many of our listeners are in their 20s,</p>
<p>maybe even in their teens.</p>
<p>And I can imagine that people that start</p>
<p>doing strength and hypertrophy training younger</p>
<p>will afford themselves an advantage over time,</p>
<p>but that everybody should be doing</p>
<p>strength and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>for as much of their lifespan as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the message that I&rsquo;m getting.</p>
<p>So if somebody is, for instance, 45,</p>
<p>would that fall into the bin of older?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start seeing decrements past,</p>
<p>again, around the age of 40 or so.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of genetic variation there,</p>
<p>and a lot of other things go into that equation,</p>
<p>like your sleep and your nutrition,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a fair number to sort of think about.</p>
<p>One actually response is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually sort of counterintuitive.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about strength training</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t actually have to start at a young age.</p>
<p>You can actually, in fact,</p>
<p>I was reading a paper this morning</p>
<p>because of our previous conversation.</p>
<p>It was in over age 90.</p>
<p>So these are folks 90 plus,</p>
<p>and they saw improvements like 30 to 170%</p>
<p>in things like muscle size and hypertrophy</p>
<p>over a very short period of time.</p>
<p>I think it was 12 weeks.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually have to start.</p>
<p>There are some adaptations</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna need for health that you,</p>
<p>God, you really need to start in your 20s.</p>
<p>The reason I like to mention that is</p>
<p>because if you are listening and you are 50,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh shit,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been strength training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not toast.</p>
<p>Like you should absolutely start now,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna be able to get to a fantastic spot</p>
<p>very quickly.</p>
<p>Similarly though,</p>
<p>if you are 20 or 25 and 30 and you aren&rsquo;t lifting,</p>
<p>there are still many reasons why you should do that now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to point that out</p>
<p>because a lot of folks would be like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh,</p>
<p>they said I have to do it when I&rsquo;m 20 or 25</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll be sort of screwed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the case at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no age limit on this.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s actually interesting data</p>
<p>that just came out</p>
<p>showing this reduction in muscle strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy that I sort of talked about</p>
<p>is basically ameliorated with a preservation of activity.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose these functionalities because of aging.</p>
<p>You lose these because of a loss of training.</p>
<p>To state that again,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose these</p>
<p>because of some innate physiological thing</p>
<p>that happens with genes become less sensitive</p>
<p>or you lose functionality.</p>
<p>You pretty much can describe</p>
<p>the loss of function of strength and muscle in aging</p>
<p>is exclusively because of a loss of training</p>
<p>and nutrition and anabolic resistance</p>
<p>and some other things.</p>
<p>So you can do a lot more than you think</p>
<p>when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important to point out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the words of the great Sherrington.</p>
<p>He won the Nobel prize as a physiologist.</p>
<p>I guess the neuroscientists try and claim him</p>
<p>as a neuroscientist</p>
<p>because he worked on the nervous system.</p>
<p>The physiologist claim as a physiologist.</p>
<p>He is 100% a physiologist.</p>
<p>I would call him a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>Maybe we can argue about this later.</p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p>But I think one of the key things</p>
<p>that Sherrington pointed out was that,</p>
<p>and I believe the quote was that,</p>
<p>movement is the final common path.</p>
<p>And what he was referring to</p>
<p>was the fact that a significant fraction</p>
<p>of the brain itself is devoted to our ability to move</p>
<p>and our ability to engage in resistance type movements.</p>
<p>And that resistance type movements</p>
<p>and the continuation of movement</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan</p>
<p>is what keeps the brain young and healthy and vital.</p>
<p>And there are so much data now to support that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so grateful that you brought up early this fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a neuromuscular link.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people think about musculoskeletal.</p>
<p>They forget that the nervous system</p>
<p>is really in charge of the strength</p>
<p>of the muscle contractions</p>
<p>and the types of muscle contractions that occur.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;re gonna get into that</p>
<p>in a lot of depth today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re close there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not totally right, but we&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I look forward to being corrected</p>
<p>and to achieving the precision</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re known for around that discussion.</p>
<p>So if we are to step back and say,</p>
<p>strength training and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>is critical for people of all ages,</p>
<p>for developing and maintaining the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>and for our ability to function in the world,</p>
<p>not just offset injury,</p>
<p>but the ability to pick things up and move, et cetera.</p>
<p>What are some of the other things</p>
<p>that strength and hypertrophy training can provide?</p>
<p>I know a lot of people use strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy training for changing their aesthetics.</p>
<p>What is your sense about its potency</p>
<p>for changing aesthetics</p>
<p>as compared to say cardiovascular exercise?</p>
<p>Yeah, the mantra I always like is,</p>
<p>the reason you wanna exercise is threefold, right?</p>
<p>You wanna look good, feel good, play good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, that comes from sport,</p>
<p>comes from football, specifically we always say that.</p>
<p>And what that means really</p>
<p>is you wanna look good.</p>
<p>People want to look the way they want to look,</p>
<p>whatever that means to them.</p>
<p>And there are any versions of what you feel</p>
<p>to be aesthetically pleasing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>But people want to look the way they wanna look.</p>
<p>Number two, you wanna be able to feel good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>You wanna be injury-free.</p>
<p>You wanna have energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>You wanna be able to execute anything you want to.</p>
<p>So whether you wanna go surf in the morning,</p>
<p>you wanna play racquetball or you wanna hike,</p>
<p>or you wanna do all three of those in one day,</p>
<p>you should have the ability to do that.</p>
<p>And then you wanna play good,</p>
<p>which means you should be able to execute</p>
<p>activities that you wanna execute, whatever that means.</p>
<p>All right, so backing all up,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that got to do with your question?</p>
<p>One of the major benefits of strength training</p>
<p>is the responses tend to happen extremely fast.</p>
<p>So you can see noticeable changes in muscle size,</p>
<p>certainly within a month, absolutely within six weeks.</p>
<p>And so we have this wonderful feedback loop</p>
<p>that sort of tells you, am I doing this incorrectly?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, yes, I am.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s very addicting.</p>
<p>The feedback, the response, the physical changes,</p>
<p>whether this is actually 0.2 or three look good</p>
<p>or feel good, play good, or it&rsquo;s even just part one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to see that when you compare that</p>
<p>to things like fat loss, that journey tends to be longer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more reliant upon other factors</p>
<p>like nutrition, et cetera.</p>
<p>Strength training is really about like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some very minimal nutrition requirements.</p>
<p>Outside of that, it comes out of the training</p>
<p>and the feedback is immediate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful because if you look across the literature</p>
<p>on exercise adherence, you&rsquo;ll see that that is in fact</p>
<p>the number one predictor of effectiveness</p>
<p>of any training program.</p>
<p>So what that means is if you were to put any variable</p>
<p>possible and figure out what is going to determine</p>
<p>whether or not this program works.</p>
<p>This is what we typically call the methods are many</p>
<p>and the concepts are few.</p>
<p>So the methods of exercise,</p>
<p>the methods of strength training,</p>
<p>the methods of hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about are infinite.</p>
<p>However, there are only a handful of key concepts</p>
<p>that you have to achieve in order for that program to work.</p>
<p>Adherence is one of them and again is often the top one.</p>
<p>So you need to do something,</p>
<p>you need to do something consistently.</p>
<p>When you are getting that feedback</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing results in your appearance immediately</p>
<p>and you see that every single day,</p>
<p>every time you take off your shirt</p>
<p>or every time you look in the mirror,</p>
<p>you see that result,</p>
<p>that tends to drive adherence really powerfully.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to give people wins,</p>
<p>especially people who are not maybe like you and I</p>
<p>who are like, I&rsquo;m going to lift weights</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to exercise like no matter what</p>
<p>the rest of my life because I just love it.</p>
<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>And so giving them a little bit of carrot of success</p>
<p>and if you can achieve that in, you know,</p>
<p>say three to four to five weeks already,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very powerful tool.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Galpin&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.</p>
<p>And this is of course important because we realized</p>
<p>that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners</p>
<p>reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements</p>
<p>mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>in particular supplements for hormone health,</p>
<p>for sleep optimization, for focus,</p>
<p>as well as a number of other things,</p>
<p>including exercise recovery,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for about the last eight months,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping about the same amount,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sleeping far deeper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now getting the proper ratios</p>
<p>of so-called rapid eye movement,</p>
<p>or REM sleep and slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>and waking up feeling far more recovered</p>
<p>mentally and physically.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism for all that</p>
<p>is very straightforward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere</p>
<p>about the critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in terms of core body temperature,</p>
<p>and waking up involves a one to three degree increase</p>
<p>in core body temperature.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep mattress covers,</p>
<p>you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment</p>
<p>to be one temperature at the start of the night,</p>
<p>a different temperature the middle of the night,</p>
<p>and a different temperature as you approach morning,</p>
<p>each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep</p>
<p>and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Levels.</p>
<p>Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods</p>
<p>and activities affect your health</p>
<p>by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose</p>
<p>using a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>Many people are aware that their blood sugar,</p>
<p>that is their blood glucose level,</p>
<p>is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain</p>
<p>to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body.</p>
<p>Most people do not know, however,</p>
<p>how different foods and different activities,</p>
<p>including exercise or different temperature environments</p>
<p>impact their blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>And yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive</p>
<p>to all of those things.</p>
<p>I first started using Levels about a year ago</p>
<p>as a way to understand how different foods,</p>
<p>exercise and timing of food relative to exercise</p>
<p>and quality of sleep at night</p>
<p>impact my blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,</p>
<p>when best to exercise, how best to exercise,</p>
<p>and how to modulate my entire schedule</p>
<p>from work to exercise and even my sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Levels</p>
<p>and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,</p>
<p>go to levels.link slash Huberman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s levels.link slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>If you would, please remind us</p>
<p>what strength and hypertrophy are</p>
<p>in terms of the specific adaptation they represent.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is</p>
<p>when somebody is training for strength,</p>
<p>what are they really training for?</p>
<p>Obviously it means the ability to move more weight,</p>
<p>but I know that it includes</p>
<p>a number of other things as well.</p>
<p>And when one is training for hypertrophy</p>
<p>for the growth of muscle fibers,</p>
<p>what does that represent?</p>
<p>Because I think if people understand that,</p>
<p>they will far better understand the methods and protocols</p>
<p>that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>At its core, you&rsquo;ve basically described it.</p>
<p>When we talk about strength,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about an actual function.</p>
<p>So can you create more force</p>
<p>across a muscle or muscle groups or total movement?</p>
<p>And when we talk about hypertrophy,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re specifically referring</p>
<p>to just an increase in size.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no actual mention of function.</p>
<p>So a muscle can grow larger</p>
<p>without actually technically being stronger</p>
<p>for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>However, there is a strong relationship</p>
<p>between strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So a lot of the times in the general public,</p>
<p>in the lay conversations,</p>
<p>we sort of lump those two things in as the same thing.</p>
<p>And so we have to recognize</p>
<p>people who are new to training</p>
<p>or people even are intermediately trained,</p>
<p>there is a huge overlap between strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Once you get past that though, they become disentangled.</p>
<p>And a good example of it is this.</p>
<p>If you look at the strongest people in the world,</p>
<p>this would be people who compete</p>
<p>in the sport of powerlifting, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a true test of maximal strength.</p>
<p>So it is a deadlift, a bench press, and a back squat.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to do a one repetition max</p>
<p>in all three of those.</p>
<p>And so whoever wins is the person</p>
<p>who lifted the most amount of weight one time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like world&rsquo;s strongest man,</p>
<p>where it is how many reps can you do in a row</p>
<p>or your time, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a true maximal strength test.</p>
<p>And you compare those to say bodybuilders.</p>
<p>Now, both of those individuals are strong</p>
<p>and both of those individuals have a lot of muscle.</p>
<p>However, it is extremely clear</p>
<p>the powerlifters will be significantly stronger</p>
<p>than the bodybuilders on average, right?</p>
<p>There are individual exceptions,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just talking collective averages.</p>
<p>And the bodybuilders will have more muscle</p>
<p>than the other ones.</p>
<p>In addition, whether you look at Olympic weightlifting</p>
<p>or powerlifting or world&rsquo;s strongest man for that matter,</p>
<p>there are weight classes.</p>
<p>And the reason is as you go up in weight classes,</p>
<p>you will always see the world records</p>
<p>go higher and higher and higher, right?</p>
<p>So you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a point, right?</p>
<p>Where you simply have to add more mass</p>
<p>to get a higher number.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have weight classes</p>
<p>in those sports and in combat sports</p>
<p>and lots of other things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion, right?</p>
<p>Because people think, man, either these are the same thing</p>
<p>or if I wanna get stronger, I have to get bigger,</p>
<p>which is not the case at all.</p>
<p>Another misnomer here is I can&rsquo;t get stronger</p>
<p>unless I add muscle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true either, right?</p>
<p>This is similar idea.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is you have the ability</p>
<p>to do whatever you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to get stronger and add muscle, great.</p>
<p>If you add muscle, you&rsquo;re probably going</p>
<p>to bring some strength along for the ride.</p>
<p>However, if you wanna get stronger</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna add muscle for any reason,</p>
<p>personal preference on aesthetics,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re in a weight class</p>
<p>and you simply can&rsquo;t afford it,</p>
<p>it is quite easy to get stronger</p>
<p>and not add much muscle mass either.</p>
<p>And so differentiating these two things</p>
<p>is one of them is simply a measure of size.</p>
<p>The other one is a measure of force.</p>
<p>And when we talk about strength,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about are two unique components.</p>
<p>Component one is what I call the physiology.</p>
<p>So what is the ability of the neuromuscular system?</p>
<p>What is the ability of the muscle fibers</p>
<p>to contract and produce force?</p>
<p>The other one is what we call mechanics.</p>
<p>And mechanics is simply things like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s minutiae down to how long your femurs are</p>
<p>relative to your tibia or other things.</p>
<p>Like this is biomechanics.</p>
<p>This is also technique.</p>
<p>This is skill.</p>
<p>This is how smooth you feel.</p>
<p>This is, are you firing the right muscle group</p>
<p>in the right sequence and order?</p>
<p>And all of these things play into strength.</p>
<p>So somebody who maybe has more force capability</p>
<p>in their muscle fibers,</p>
<p>but their technique and the movement is worse,</p>
<p>may lose in a competition.</p>
<p>Or somebody again, who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you go into the world of speed and power,</p>
<p>especially you&rsquo;ll hear a lot of people</p>
<p>talk about like the rhythm.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a certain rhythm that has to happen</p>
<p>if you wanna jump as high as possible</p>
<p>or run as fast as possible.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all mechanics at this fundamental level.</p>
<p>So when we look at hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just still simply about how big the muscle is.</p>
<p>So those are the really the similarities</p>
<p>and distinctions between strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>When strength improves and when hypertrophy increases,</p>
<p>is there also involvement in the ligaments and tendons?</p>
<p>That is, of course, the ligaments and tendons</p>
<p>are involved in the movements.</p>
<p>But do ligaments and tendons themselves grow</p>
<p>and or get stronger?</p>
<p>This field is really difficult</p>
<p>because connective tissue is not vascular.</p>
<p>And so their plasticity is significantly lower</p>
<p>than skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look across all the organs,</p>
<p>skeletal muscle is one of, if not the most plastic,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s the most pliable, the most responsive,</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s going to adjust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s paying attention to everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being said in the body.</p>
<p>You cannot change blood pressure or pH</p>
<p>or macronutrients floating around</p>
<p>without muscle knowing about it.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, this is why we call muscle an organ.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t tend to think about this</p>
<p>if you were ever on like Jeopardy.</p>
<p>And they ask you that question of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the biggest organ system in the body?</p>
<p>People tend to say-</p>
<p>The skin.</p>
<p>Muscle&rsquo;s actually the correct answer.</p>
<p>All right, well, I&rsquo;m going to cite you</p>
<p>when I get it wrong on Jeopardy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any immediate plans to go on Jeopardy,</p>
<p>but who knows?</p>
<p>Oh, there you go.</p>
<p>Celebrity Jeopardy, Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Wait, I don&rsquo;t know about the celebrity part,</p>
<p>but Jeopardy would be fun.</p>
<p>But I will say the muscle and I&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>if you get a phone call on Jeopardy, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that show in a very long time, maybe ever,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll call you.</p>
<p>But that makes sense.</p>
<p>The muscles would be the largest organ system in the body.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m saying that is,</p>
<p>so muscle is both listening and talking.</p>
<p>It is controlling the immune system a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s controlling blood glucose regulation.</p>
<p>It is the central depot for amino acids,</p>
<p>which are needed to do things like regulate</p>
<p>the immune system, build any new red blood cells.</p>
<p>A lot of this stuff is coming from skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>So when we say organ, by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually like a physiological definition.</p>
<p>So something that&rsquo;s communicating</p>
<p>to either another organ itself or throughout the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s listening and it&rsquo;s talking.</p>
<p>Connective tissue is not the same way.</p>
<p>And so we do see adaptations with strength training</p>
<p>in connective tissue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just much lower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to measure.</p>
<p>Effectively, what we know now is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a combination of adaptations</p>
<p>throughout the connective tissue.</p>
<p>It is beneficial.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the major reasons</p>
<p>that strength training reduces injury risk,</p>
<p>which is very, very important</p>
<p>because people who tend to wanna pick up an exercise routine</p>
<p>after say 10 years, the classic cliche is like,</p>
<p>I played all these things in high school.</p>
<p>Then I went to college, got a job.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m 25 or 35 or whatever.</p>
<p>You sort of wanna jump back into what you did</p>
<p>when you were 20.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no tissue tolerance left.</p>
<p>And what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue.</p>
<p>The tolerance in there is not ready</p>
<p>for the load you&rsquo;re about to handle.</p>
<p>And so you go through some movement and then boom,</p>
<p>sprains, tears, even like the more significant ones</p>
<p>around Achilles tear, which is gonna really sideline you.</p>
<p>So those are some of the problems.</p>
<p>And we know strength training has a large role</p>
<p>in injury reduction for stress and strain</p>
<p>and overuse injuries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s specifically coming</p>
<p>for the connective tissue adaptations.</p>
<p>Again, the difficult part here is it&rsquo;s very hard to assess.</p>
<p>We actually, when I was a doctoral student,</p>
<p>we played around with patella tendon biopsies.</p>
<p>So I actually had one.</p>
<p>This is like a&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little piece of your patella tendon missing</p>
<p>because your own lab.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve probably had,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many hundreds of biopsies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve performed on people.</p>
<p>Probably well over a thousand,</p>
<p>certainly well over a thousand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably had 35 or 40 done on myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no problem here.</p>
<p>I have no scar tissue.</p>
<p>I have no loss of function</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve stuck needles in every leg,</p>
<p>like all over myself, right?</p>
<p>Quads, my soleus, gastroc, like all up and down.</p>
<p>Taking tissue out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you go with the needle,</p>
<p>it looks like a pen basically,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re alive and you go in and grab a chunk</p>
<p>and you pull it out and&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I come to your lab and get biopsy?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re probably,</p>
<p>looking under the microscope,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just look like the molecule caffeine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mutual friend of ours</p>
<p>who came down and did that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big, big, big gentleman,</p>
<p>big into lifting, very into strength training.</p>
<p>And he went through that experience</p>
<p>and he was like, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>it was not what he was hoping to get.</p>
<p>He actually had unbelievable muscle morphology.</p>
<p>His fibers were,</p>
<p>the diameter of muscle fibers is extremely large.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the biggest cells by volume</p>
<p>in all of biology, skeletal muscle in human.</p>
<p>How large?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>Millimeters?</p>
<p>Well, so you have length and then you have width, right?</p>
<p>So lengthwise, it can be extraordinarily long.</p>
<p>You can be, the classic example is like your sartorius,</p>
<p>which is like the front of your hip</p>
<p>to the inside of your kneecap.</p>
<p>Theoretically, those cells can run the entire length,</p>
<p>which would be one muscle fiber running that thing.</p>
<p>If I were to do a biopsy on you</p>
<p>and I pulled that tissue out,</p>
<p>I could actually pull an individual fiber out</p>
<p>like tweezers and hold it up</p>
<p>and you could see that whole muscle cell.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely not gonna be allowed to get biopsied.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be stunned how big they are.</p>
<p>Anyways, his was the size of a rhino.</p>
<p>So the diameter of his,</p>
<p>now he has a well-documented assistance</p>
<p>in the area of muscle growth, we&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>But yeah, those can be large.</p>
<p>So what were we even talking about there?</p>
<p>Well, I was asking about tendons and ligaments</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d like to understand the various tissues</p>
<p>and organ systems that adapt when one gets stronger,</p>
<p>when muscle tissue grows.</p>
<p>And I do wanna ask about bone.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not referring to bone mineral density.</p>
<p>What I was going to ask is whether or not bone itself</p>
<p>can grow and get stronger.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a favorite result of mine.</p>
<p>I have about 3,800 favorite results,</p>
<p>3,000 pet peeves and 3,800 plus favorite results.</p>
<p>But one of my favorite results</p>
<p>is from Eric Kandel&rsquo;s lab at Columbia.</p>
<p>Eric won the Nobel Prize for learning and memory</p>
<p>and his laboratory got really into the effects of exercise</p>
<p>on learning and memory.</p>
<p>And they had this incredible result,</p>
<p>which is that load bearing exercise</p>
<p>stimulates the bones to release something</p>
<p>called osteocalcin, excuse me.</p>
<p>And then osteocalcin acts as a,</p>
<p>more or less a hormone, travels to the brain</p>
<p>and enhances the memory systems in the brain</p>
<p>by enhancing neuron health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic crux of the studies.</p>
<p>There were several of these.</p>
<p>And the moment I saw the first of those studies,</p>
<p>I thought, well, here&rsquo;s another reason</p>
<p>to do resistance type exercise and not just aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>And then it brings to mind whether or not</p>
<p>bones themselves get stronger when we do resistance training.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve known that for many decades.</p>
<p>You have a diminishing ability to do so with age,</p>
<p>particularly you need to do this in your teens and 20s.</p>
<p>This is where you&rsquo;re going to have the largest ability</p>
<p>to enhance bone mineral density.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s particularly responsive to axial loading.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a muscle guy, I&rsquo;m not a bone specialist.</p>
<p>So we would have to consult somebody</p>
<p>who can give you more precision here.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>So you explained axial loading?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up and down, it&rsquo;s vertical.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s almost like a cylinder</p>
<p>putting weight on the small end of the cylinder,</p>
<p>on both small end of the cylinders.</p>
<p>If someone doesn&rsquo;t do this in their 20s or teens, however,</p>
<p>can we assume that some degree of positive change</p>
<p>will occur if they do resistance training,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a small fraction?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, it is small.</p>
<p>We have worked with a number of women</p>
<p>in our rapid health program that come in</p>
<p>and they are in their 20s and they&rsquo;re in their 30s</p>
<p>and they have significant bone mineral density problems.</p>
<p>And eight months later, we can see noticeable changes</p>
<p>that are outside of the measurement error of a DEXA.</p>
<p>Positive changes.</p>
<p>Positive changes, correct.</p>
<p>And if you worked with the,</p>
<p>there are many physicians that specialize in this area.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to need nutrition here.</p>
<p>Strength training alone</p>
<p>is probably not going to get you there,</p>
<p>particularly with women, because you have to figure out why.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot going on</p>
<p>with the physiology and biochemistry.</p>
<p>So you probably, like almost surely,</p>
<p>need to have some blood chemistry done with that.</p>
<p>You have to figure out what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>menstrual cycle-wise.</p>
<p>In fact, like oftentimes what we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>for our women very specifically</p>
<p>is we use a thing called a Rhythm Plus, a 30-day test.</p>
<p>So you can actually do a salivary test</p>
<p>across the entire menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And you can take samples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about every other day.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll get 15 or 16 samples</p>
<p>and you get a really beautiful picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening hormonally</p>
<p>across the entire menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, really important</p>
<p>because typically for women,</p>
<p>if you get a single sample or simple time point,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s salivary, urine, or blood,</p>
<p>you can have, well, like an order of magnitude difference</p>
<p>in any number of metrics because of what phase you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s been such a challenge</p>
<p>to do a lot of physiology research with females.</p>
<p>Some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like strength is a very good example.</p>
<p>I can strength train</p>
<p>and I can do a one rep max test on a woman at any point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do that at a certain phase</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle</p>
<p>because the evidence I think is pretty clear at this point,</p>
<p>that number won&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>So I have no qualms including females</p>
<p>in any of my studies where strength</p>
<p>is an important dependent variable</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have to adjust around menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Other factors like anything in blood,</p>
<p>anything hormone related,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to automatically account for it.</p>
<p>So what I would say is those folks</p>
<p>should absolutely work with a qualified physician</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to have to get</p>
<p>some nutrition supplementation potentially,</p>
<p>and then maybe even some other stuff going on.</p>
<p>To make that even more complicated,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on any form of birth control or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to change the entire equation,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a hormone-based birth control.</p>
<p>So it just gets really, really complicated.</p>
<p>To answer it though, you can see adaptations.</p>
<p>They are significantly diminished</p>
<p>relative to if you were started in your teens and 20s,</p>
<p>but there is hope.</p>
<p>You just need to work with somebody</p>
<p>who specializes in that area.</p>
<p>So for both men and women, boys and girls,</p>
<p>what are the major adaptations that occur</p>
<p>to underlie improvements in strength?</p>
<p>And if you would, if you could just provide</p>
<p>a bullet point list of that,</p>
<p>and then we can dive into each of those in detail.</p>
<p>For instance, are nerves getting more efficient at firing?</p>
<p>Are bones enjoying adaptations</p>
<p>in different bone connective tissue relationships</p>
<p>that underlie strength?</p>
<p>I have to imagine all of these things are happening,</p>
<p>but what are the major changes that are occurring</p>
<p>in those organs and organ systems</p>
<p>that reflect someone&rsquo;s ability to, on one day,</p>
<p>lift 100 pounds, and then a week later to lift 105 pounds?</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll try to keep this condensed.</p>
<p>Again, this could be an entire university course.</p>
<p>I will also try to give you a little bit of bones here.</p>
<p>So normally as a muscle guy,</p>
<p>I take all the credit in muscle.</p>
<p>Turns out the nervous system</p>
<p>gets a little bit of credit too here.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So as we walk through it, just as a big picture,</p>
<p>if we think about, again, what causes human movement,</p>
<p>basically everything along that chain</p>
<p>will improve the strength training.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really using too much hyperbole there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite impressive.</p>
<p>So just going from the nervous system side of the equation,</p>
<p>what has to happen for human movement</p>
<p>is a nerve has to send a signal through a motor unit.</p>
<p>Now, a motor unit comes down</p>
<p>and innervates multiple muscle fibers.</p>
<p>So if you think about your actual muscle, it&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>It is a component of many individual muscle fibers.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got millions, if not more.</p>
<p>Think of it like a ponytail.</p>
<p>So we collectively say ponytail,</p>
<p>and you think of it as like one thing,</p>
<p>but really a ponytail is a combination</p>
<p>of tons of individual hairs.</p>
<p>Muscles the same way.</p>
<p>So this motor unit comes in</p>
<p>and innervates a lot of different muscle fibers.</p>
<p>Now, every one of the fibers in a motor unit</p>
<p>is generally of the same fiber type.</p>
<p>So fast twitch or slow twitch.</p>
<p>And they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle.</p>
<p>They are spread out across, horizontally, vertically,</p>
<p>as well as closer to the bone and further to the surface.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re moved throughout the entire way.</p>
<p>And this is what allows you to have smoother contractions</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have specificity and things like that.</p>
<p>So we see improvements from the neuromuscular side</p>
<p>like firing rate.</p>
<p>We see synchronization improvements that are coming in.</p>
<p>You also see improvements in things like acetylcholine</p>
<p>release from the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting it faster.</p>
<p>We see calcium recycling is improved back to there.</p>
<p>So in order for,</p>
<p>without walking into too much of the biochemistry,</p>
<p>in order for a signal to go from nerve to muscle,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of a gap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a physical space that happens.</p>
<p>And what happens is you release this molecule</p>
<p>called acetylcholine.</p>
<p>This goes into the postsynaptic cleft,</p>
<p>and then that actually binds to a receptor.</p>
<p>That receptor actually opens up a door that lets sodium in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Well, that acetylcholine then sits on that receptor site.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s broken down, put back in,</p>
<p>and recycled back up in the presynaptic nerve site.</p>
<p>The faster you can do that,</p>
<p>the faster you can recycle that signal.</p>
<p>And so almost everything that I described</p>
<p>in that entire system improves</p>
<p>and has been shown to increase with training.</p>
<p>So that alone is given to give you benefits.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even walked into</p>
<p>getting from an electrical signal now</p>
<p>into an action potential,</p>
<p>which is gonna cause a muscle contraction.</p>
<p>So getting from nerve into the muscle,</p>
<p>we see everything from improvements</p>
<p>that we call contractility,</p>
<p>which means the muscle fiber themselves</p>
<p>can produce more force or more velocity</p>
<p>independent of muscle size changes.</p>
<p>So this is another component when we ask like,</p>
<p>well, how is it I got stronger without getting bigger?</p>
<p>Well, in the muscle fiber itself,</p>
<p>its ability to contract force increases.</p>
<p>And this is because we have everything</p>
<p>like the sarcoplasmic morticulum,</p>
<p>which is the place that stores and releases the calcium,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s needed for this entire</p>
<p>cross-bridge interaction from the myosin and actin</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>I know I just lost a lot of people,</p>
<p>but you can go look at some of these images.</p>
<p>The sarcoplasmic morticulum gets activated more.</p>
<p>It gets more sensitive.</p>
<p>It is better at releasing calcium,</p>
<p>bringing it back in and doing it again.</p>
<p>The bond between the cross-bridge of the myosin and actin</p>
<p>gets stronger.</p>
<p>The calcium affinity is the phrase that we use there,</p>
<p>increases.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re literally walking through</p>
<p>almost the entire process of skeletal muscle contraction</p>
<p>here and every step along the way, we see improvement.</p>
<p>So that net result is we see, again, more force production</p>
<p>independent of any change in size,</p>
<p>independent of any increase in contractile units.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t add anything to the equation.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t change size.</p>
<p>We did nothing but improve efficiency effectively.</p>
<p>Independent of that,</p>
<p>now we can actually start talking about</p>
<p>changing muscle fiber type.</p>
<p>So we can change our fibers from a slow twitch fiber</p>
<p>to a fast twitch fiber.</p>
<p>That alone is gonna give you more force production,</p>
<p>again, independent of size.</p>
<p>Fast twitch fibers tend to be larger</p>
<p>than slow twitch fibers, but not always,</p>
<p>especially in the presence of endurance training.</p>
<p>So if you do a lot of consistent endurance training,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very common for us to find slow twitch fibers</p>
<p>that are as similar size, if not larger,</p>
<p>often, very often larger than the fast twitch fibers.</p>
<p>If you do a lot of-</p>
<p>So big, slow fibers.</p>
<p>Big, slow, very metabolically effective fibers.</p>
<p>So extremely fatigue resistant.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to call them slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we tend to say fast is slow</p>
<p>and slow has this negative connotation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like quite healthy, like fiber type to have.</p>
<p>Outside of that, now we haven&rsquo;t even gotten into things</p>
<p>like penation angle.</p>
<p>So this is an angle at which your muscle fibers</p>
<p>interact with your bone.</p>
<p>So we tend to think about this as like a muscle fiber</p>
<p>is pulling on a muscle.</p>
<p>Well, some of these are oriented at almost a 90 degree.</p>
<p>So a fiber runs perpendicular into the bone</p>
<p>and some of them are closer to like a 45 degree</p>
<p>and some of them are closer to almost parallel.</p>
<p>And that confers a lot of unique mechanical benefits.</p>
<p>So in one area,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually gonna increase force production.</p>
<p>You go the other direction, increases velocity.</p>
<p>And so we have all kinds of changes in the angle</p>
<p>at which the muscle inserts into the bone.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re already in the mechanic side of it, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve influenced how effectively it pulls.</p>
<p>And with any of these things, it&rsquo;s always a give and take.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna give up in the case of penation angle,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna give up strength,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna increase a lot shortening velocity.</p>
<p>Or if you wanna increase the velocity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna give up sort of the strength, right?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t gotten to any of the energetics at all.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t talked about increasing storage</p>
<p>of phosphocreatine, which is the energy system</p>
<p>needed to power that muscle contraction</p>
<p>at the fastest possible rate.</p>
<p>So we could continue to go as long as you want here,</p>
<p>but hopefully you&rsquo;re getting the point</p>
<p>of a little bit of the adaptations that occur.</p>
<p>The reason I wanna actually,</p>
<p>why I think that stuff is important to bring it back,</p>
<p>maybe for some listeners,</p>
<p>I know I took you on a journey there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, what the hell just happened?</p>
<p>That matters because again,</p>
<p>this is a specific explanation for how is it possible</p>
<p>that I got stronger, but I didn&rsquo;t get bigger.</p>
<p>And this is also why strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>are intertwined and heavily overlapped,</p>
<p>but are not necessarily the same thing.</p>
<p>So for example, we can increase muscle size</p>
<p>and actually reduce strength</p>
<p>because of what&rsquo;s called lattice spacing.</p>
<p>So what happens is you have to kind of remember</p>
<p>your muscle fibers are these long cylinders</p>
<p>and the way that they contract requires an optimal space.</p>
<p>And so what happens is you have this molecule called actin</p>
<p>and you have this molecule called myosin.</p>
<p>Myosin sits in the middle and there are six actin</p>
<p>that surround each individual myosin</p>
<p>in a three-dimensional circle here.</p>
<p>So you got a myosin in the middle</p>
<p>that has all these globular heads</p>
<p>and they can reach up and grab an actin.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s six sort of around them, right?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that can occur</p>
<p>is if those actin are too close together.</p>
<p>So imagine my hands, I&rsquo;m reaching out</p>
<p>and doing a giant T, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m horizontal out there.</p>
<p>Well, if my fingertips are the tips of the myosin</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to reach up and grab an actin</p>
<p>and I wanna pull those actins closer to my face,</p>
<p>well, those actin stack on top of each other</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what actually makes your muscles grow up.</p>
<p>Like if I flex my bicep,</p>
<p>it actually grows up three or four inches</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re stacking these circle mirrors</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re called on top of each other.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;m reaching out to grab them</p>
<p>and the muscle is stretched too far,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t actually make that strong of a connection.</p>
<p>It would be like if I reached out and grabbed something</p>
<p>but I can only reach my longest fingertip on it.</p>
<p>When I go to contract,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t make that strong of a contraction</p>
<p>because my grip is weak.</p>
<p>My grip is gonna break before I reach my strength limit.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m too close, there&rsquo;s nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already as close.</p>
<p>So if you actually disrupt that lattice spacing too much,</p>
<p>you can actually lose a little bit of strength.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply that you&rsquo;re not optimizing for strength.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply optimizing for size.</p>
<p>And so that can explain a little bit of the discontinuity</p>
<p>between growing and performance.</p>

<p>What are a few of the major changes that occur</p>
<p>in muscle, nerve, et cetera,</p>
<p>when we experience hypertrophy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of protein synthesis changes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell us a bit more about that.</p>
<p>Changes in blood flow.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Perhaps changes in neural innervation.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe even changes in fascia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any specifically,</p>
<p>but I have to imagine that they&rsquo;re somehow involved.</p>
<p>Sure, so when we talk about hypertrophy,</p>
<p>a lot of the adaptations are going to be similar</p>
<p>because the mode of training is close enough.</p>
<p>So your nerves probably aren&rsquo;t smart enough</p>
<p>to differentiate between a set of five reps</p>
<p>or a set of eight repetitions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re smart enough to differentiate anything.</p>
<p>Like they know everything that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to be a huge overlap.</p>
<p>The primary difference with hypertrophy</p>
<p>is a couple of things.</p>
<p>So if you think about the muscle microstructure,</p>
<p>I have a whole series of videos on YouTube</p>
<p>if you want to see the visuals behind this.</p>
<p>In fact, in there, I include the specific diameter,</p>
<p>size and muscle fibers that I failed to give you</p>
<p>a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>We will provide an active link to this.</p>
<p>So what happens is this,</p>
<p>when we talk about and you hear this classic buzz phrase</p>
<p>of muscle protein synthesis,</p>
<p>generally what we&rsquo;re talking about there</p>
<p>is contractile units.</p>
<p>And so when we say contractile units,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the myosin and actin.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re really trying to do is say,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s some amount of protein turnover</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re coming in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to add more proteins to the equation.</p>
<p>So what has to happen there is a series of steps.</p>
<p>So step number one is there has to be some sort of signal</p>
<p>from the external world.</p>
<p>This could actually oftentimes it&rsquo;s things like</p>
<p>stretching of the cell wall,</p>
<p>which is what happens with exercise, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re contracting a shortening,</p>
<p>you get this big stretch of the cell wall.</p>
<p>It can come from as simple things</p>
<p>like an amino acid infusion.</p>
<p>This is just eating protein.</p>
<p>This is why protein ingestion alone is anabolic, right?</p>
<p>It will help you grow muscle independent of even moving.</p>
<p>So just eating protein will grow your muscles.</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly.</p>
<p>Those data are very clear.</p>
<p>Of course, like anything, there&rsquo;s a saturation point</p>
<p>in terms of total amount you need to get to</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you were to walk into a laboratory</p>
<p>fasted overnight and I gave you 30 grams of protein,</p>
<p>we would see a very measurable increase</p>
<p>in protein synthesis quite clearly for several hours,</p>
<p>probably four to five plus hours.</p>
<p>We could maybe bring us to people</p>
<p>that would know those data better, but many hours later.</p>
<p>With no weight training.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I am betting that most people are not aware of that fact.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s actually interesting about it is</p>
<p>if you do the exact same study again</p>
<p>and you just did strength training,</p>
<p>you would also see an improvement in protein synthesis.</p>
<p>But those factors are independent</p>
<p>and the mechanisms are independent</p>
<p>such that if you do them both together,</p>
<p>they stack on top of each other, which is really wonderful.</p>
<p>And if you were to add carbohydrate into that mix,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re actually adding fuel</p>
<p>for the entire muscle protein synthesis process.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re going to see even additive benefits.</p>
<p>And this is why for so many years,</p>
<p>this is what bore the whole like post-exercise</p>
<p>anabolic window thing,</p>
<p>which is like you got to get carbs and protein</p>
<p>in post-exercise to maximize muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Now that turned out to be like not totally true</p>
<p>in terms of being a natural window.</p>
<p>Well, the window turned out to not be as strict</p>
<p>as people initially asserted, as I recall.</p>
<p>But still, I think that&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>These are parallel pathways for protein synthesis,</p>
<p>simply eating protein or training</p>
<p>each independently increases protein synthesis.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but ask,</p>
<p>is the same true if one does endurance type exercise?</p>
<p>If I go out for a 45 minute jog</p>
<p>where I can nasal breathe the whole time,</p>
<p>but if I were to go any faster,</p>
<p>I would have to kick over into mouth breathing as well.</p>
<p>So called the zone two ish cardio.</p>
<p>Will I see an increase in protein synthesis</p>
<p>as simply as a consequence of that jog?</p>
<p>Now, this is one of the unique factors of strength training.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to see that.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s difficult to measure protein breakdown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been as extraordinarily challenging</p>
<p>to do in the laboratory,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to see those benefits.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re going to see quite the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entire molecular cascade.</p>
<p>So this is kind of how it works.</p>
<p>So you have to have some sort of signal on the outside</p>
<p>and this can be an energetic signal.</p>
<p>So this could be glucose uptake.</p>
<p>It could be protein intake.</p>
<p>It could be a physical stretch.</p>
<p>What happens is on the cell wall,</p>
<p>there is some sort of, it could be testosterone, right?</p>
<p>Testosterone combined to beta adrenergic receptors.</p>
<p>And this activates a whole series of cascades</p>
<p>of signaling proteins.</p>
<p>And these proteins basically play a game of telephone.</p>
<p>So one tells the next one, this was the next one.</p>
<p>And they sort of walk this entire way.</p>
<p>Well, that molecular cascade is fundamentally</p>
<p>the same thing, regardless of the insult,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re different pathways.</p>
<p>And so the pathway from strength training</p>
<p>or protein ingestion is going to go to the same nucleus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to activate a whole set of gene cascades</p>
<p>that are going to tell you to go through</p>
<p>this entire process of protein synthesis,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll walk through what that is in a second.</p>
<p>If you do endurance training, it&rsquo;s a different pathway.</p>
<p>And so instead of activating this entire thing</p>
<p>of like mTOR and AKT and this anabolic signaling cascade,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to do a different one,</p>
<p>which you can think of more of like as AMPK</p>
<p>and energy signaling thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a crossover point here.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things you&rsquo;ll notice is mTOR and AKT</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really influence AMPK,</p>
<p>but there is some literature that years ago</p>
<p>showed AMPK will activate another protein called TSC2</p>
<p>and that will actually inhibit mTOR.</p>
<p>And that was the first molecular explanation</p>
<p>for the quote-unquote interference effect</p>
<p>of endurance training on hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Could you just highlight for people what this is?</p>
<p>Because as you describe these signaling pathways,</p>
<p>I just want to maybe just put a top contour explanation.</p>
<p>The mTOR pathway is synonymous with cell growth,</p>
<p>both during development as organisms,</p>
<p>humans included, mature, and cells get larger.</p>
<p>mTOR is abundant in the system,</p>
<p>to put it quite simply.</p>
<p>And then the AMPK pathway</p>
<p>and some of the metabolic signaling that you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is more synonymous with cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>at least in the context of this discussion,</p>
<p>and fuel utilization.</p>
<p>And what you described as a crossover point</p>
<p>where certain forms of exercise can tap into both of these,</p>
<p>but at least for sake of this conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re largely separating them.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the byproduct is the thing that matters here.</p>
<p>So, the result of mTOR and AKT getting into the nucleus</p>
<p>is going to be increase in protein synthesis.</p>
<p>The result of AMPK running down to the,</p>
<p>is going to be result in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>So, the net outcome is different.</p>
<p>Now, I do want to flag it very quickly.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinarily complicated thing.</p>
<p>And in fact, in our laboratory,</p>
<p>we were able to be one of the first</p>
<p>that figured out how to measure</p>
<p>all the different subunits of AMPK</p>
<p>and individual muscles by fiber type.</p>
<p>So, we were able to-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re ripping people&rsquo;s muscles</p>
<p>out of their knees and their patellar tendons.</p>
<p>So, AMPK-</p>
<p>Just teasing, they&rsquo;re gently removing</p>
<p>with under IRB protocol.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So, even when we say something like AMPK, it&rsquo;s not one thing.</p>
<p>And when we say things like mTOR, it&rsquo;s not one thing either.</p>
<p>You have the total amount that matters.</p>
<p>You have the activation.</p>
<p>The activation sites are many of them.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not as simple as what I&rsquo;m laying it out.</p>
<p>I just want to get a big concept</p>
<p>of kind of what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>to actually kind of answer your question, which is,</p>
<p>okay, so how is the muscle actually growing?</p>
<p>What you have to understand</p>
<p>is a little bit of how protein synthesis occurs.</p>
<p>So, what I&rsquo;m generally meaning is</p>
<p>you have a whole bunch of amino acids,</p>
<p>and this actually goes back</p>
<p>to maybe like middle school biology class, right?</p>
<p>So, if you take a bunch of amino acids</p>
<p>and you combine them together,</p>
<p>we get these things called a peptide, right?</p>
<p>And if anyone has ever heard of like peptides,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all it really means.</p>
<p>You put a bunch of those together, you have a polypeptide.</p>
<p>You put a bunch of those together and we now have a protein.</p>
<p>So, any protein I want to make</p>
<p>is going to go through the exact same system,</p>
<p>the exact same steps.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if that protein</p>
<p>is going to be a red blood cell.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if that&rsquo;s going to be a hair follicle.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s going to be skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically protein synthesis.</p>
<p>So, when we tend to think of protein synthesis,</p>
<p>we just paint this picture of growing more muscle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only thing.</p>
<p>And so, when we talk about the benefits</p>
<p>of having high quality muscle</p>
<p>as being this place that&rsquo;s going to regulate</p>
<p>most of your protein synthesis,</p>
<p>we tend to lose some people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t need to gain muscle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about regulating the immune system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about regulating any protein turnover.</p>
<p>So, any protein that&rsquo;s degradated</p>
<p>and needs to be broken down in your system at all,</p>
<p>autophagy, this is such an important buzzword.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just protein breakdown of an unneeded</p>
<p>or damaged protein, right?</p>
<p>That whole thing is going to go through protein synthesis</p>
<p>to be able to come back and replace things.</p>
<p>The only reason you go through autophagy</p>
<p>is so you can clean that garbage out</p>
<p>and then come back and build in</p>
<p>a more properly functioning protein.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not just about growing more muscle masses,</p>
<p>why you want these systems to be operating well.</p>
<p>So, the protein ingestion</p>
<p>is going to just activate that cascade</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically saying,</p>
<p>oh, hey, look, we have an abundance of supply here.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we make something out of it?</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know the next time</p>
<p>this thing is going to be around.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates and fat are very easy to store.</p>
<p>Protein is very challenging, it&rsquo;s more transient.</p>
<p>And so, you can store some of it and keep it around,</p>
<p>but most of it you&rsquo;re going to lose.</p>
<p>And so, when it&rsquo;s available,</p>
<p>your body wants to act very quickly.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily care if you have extra fat</p>
<p>floating around in your system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all right, let&rsquo;s package it up and store it,</p>
<p>we can easily bring this back out.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve got protein around,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to use it.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s why it alone will activate</p>
<p>and increase protein synthesis, independent of exercise.</p>
<p>So, those effects are additive, like I said,</p>
<p>because that signaling process is independent.</p>
<p>And then once you hit a rate limiting phase,</p>
<p>then you are there.</p>
<p>But at its onset, those things will work independently.</p>
<p>Okay, so that being said,</p>
<p>what is skeletal muscle hypertrophy?</p>
<p>In general, we think about it</p>
<p>as this increase in contractile protein.</p>
<p>So, those myosin and actin effectively get thicker.</p>
<p>Okay, now what happens is since they are thicker,</p>
<p>and as I talked about a second ago,</p>
<p>that influences and actually hurts the lattice spacing.</p>
<p>And so, what your body does as a result is say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s increase the diameter of the entire cell</p>
<p>so that we can maintain our spacing</p>
<p>between these things, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effectively like if the two of us</p>
<p>were sitting in this room and you doubled in size</p>
<p>and I was like, whoa, you&rsquo;re in my personal space.</p>
<p>And I doubled in size.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re in each other&rsquo;s space.</p>
<p>At some point, we just have to make the room larger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening in the cell.</p>
<p>And so, as you can continue to increase muscle size,</p>
<p>myofibular accretion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna continue to increase muscle fiber size.</p>
<p>For years, there was this other comment</p>
<p>about non-functional hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And this was often called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Now, this is not sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
<p>This is a fancy way of saying my muscle is larger,</p>
<p>but it has no function.</p>
<p>And the question would be, well, how the hell</p>
<p>is that possible?</p>
<p>If I have more contractile units</p>
<p>and I can make more of these cross bridges,</p>
<p>perform more of these power strokes,</p>
<p>is what these contractions are called,</p>
<p>how could I possibly be losing function?</p>
<p>Well, that was bro science for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And in fact, what it really came down to was,</p>
<p>are there different types of hypertrophy training?</p>
<p>Some that induce contractile protein hypertrophy</p>
<p>and some that induce the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And that was significantly challenged until recently.</p>
<p>Mike Roberts at Auburn did a series of wonderful studies</p>
<p>that showed quite clearly</p>
<p>that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is probably happening.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s probably a pretty easy explanation.</p>
<p>In general, what happens is,</p>
<p>it is a increase in fluid in the muscle fiber.</p>
<p>And so this would allow for the diameter to be larger,</p>
<p>but since there was no addition of contractile units,</p>
<p>no more force production happens.</p>
<p>And so he actually has a wonderful review paper,</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s open access,</p>
<p>where you can go look and he created a wonderful graph.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s in my hypertrophy videos on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>And you can actually see that it&rsquo;s likely happening</p>
<p>in phasic changes throughout your training experience.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of your training,</p>
<p>but as the years and year or weeks rather than months,</p>
<p>and then eventually years go by in your training,</p>
<p>we have a change in the hypertrophy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from contractile units versus sarcoplasmic.</p>
<p>So I think that is an important note,</p>
<p>because again, people are wondering like,</p>
<p>well, how the hell is it even possible</p>
<p>for me to get larger muscle and somehow I&rsquo;m not stronger?</p>
<p>Well, if it came from simply fluid retention,</p>
<p>and this is not bloating,</p>
<p>this is not, there&rsquo;s no negative really to this.</p>
<p>It is simply holding of more hydration in the cell,</p>
<p>diameter gets larger and then everything works that way.</p>
<p>Well, you just described calls to mind</p>
<p>something similar in the nervous system,</p>
<p>which is neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which of course is the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to learning and experience</p>
<p>and damage for that matter.</p>
<p>And we think about it as one term,</p>
<p>but there are many different forms of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>a discussion that we don&rsquo;t need to get into now,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s spike timing dependent plasticity and LTP</p>
<p>and long-term depression,</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with psychological depression</p>
<p>and on and impaired pulse facilitation</p>
<p>and on and on and on and short-term plasticity.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m starting to understand</p>
<p>is that there are many paths</p>
<p>to what we call strength increase.</p>
<p>And there are many paths to what we think of</p>
<p>as hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Many of these are going to operate in parallel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be rare that any one of them</p>
<p>is going to be active alone</p>
<p>in order to create hypertrophy or strength changes.</p>
<p>And that certain forms of exercise</p>
<p>and certain ways of doing exercises</p>
<p>in terms of sets and repetition schemes</p>
<p>and rest intervals between sets</p>
<p>and between training sessions</p>
<p>are going to tap into different mechanisms,</p>
<p>but also overlapping sets of mechanisms,</p>
<p>which is why, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>you mentioned at the beginning</p>
<p>that often, not always,</p>
<p>but often strength increases</p>
<p>are associated with some hypertrophy changes</p>
<p>and hypertrophy increases</p>
<p>are often not always associated with strength increases.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this whole thing is</p>
<p>while we don&rsquo;t yet know the mechanisms specifically,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of changes that happen,</p>
<p>we actually just submitted a paper a few days ago.</p>
<p>Myself, Jimmy Bagley at San Francisco</p>
<p>and Kevin Murek has a wonderful muscle physiology lab</p>
<p>at Arkansas.</p>
<p>And we actually, this is a very lay article, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to read.</p>
<p>We describe the role of myonucleation</p>
<p>in muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a lot of interesting stuff</p>
<p>we can get into there,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re learning more and more about it as a quick example.</p>
<p>So skeletal muscle is unique in the fact</p>
<p>that it is so large in diameter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also unique in the fact that it&rsquo;s multinucleated.</p>
<p>What that means is typically in biology,</p>
<p>you see like a cell has one nucleus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the place that houses and holds the DNA</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a control center.</p>
<p>It tells it to grow, shrink, die, repair, that whole thing.</p>
<p>Well, skeletal muscle in human is awesome</p>
<p>because it has thousands, if not more of those nuclei,</p>
<p>which gives it that plasticity.</p>
<p>And so a normal cell has one place it has to go to</p>
<p>for any time it wants to up-regulate, down-regulate,</p>
<p>do whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>Your muscle fibers have these little control centers</p>
<p>all throughout them.</p>
<p>And for years we were like, okay, great.</p>
<p>The amount of hypertrophy that you can experience</p>
<p>is probably limited by the amount of nuclei you have</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to exceed</p>
<p>a certain size of muscle fiber</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s going to mean you lose control.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re like, okay, great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found and identified a limiting factor</p>
<p>to what will determine how much a muscle can actually grow.</p>
<p>And then the next question was,</p>
<p>and then where are these things coming from?</p>
<p>And this is where satellite cells come in.</p>
<p>And so it was very clear,</p>
<p>a satellite cell that&rsquo;s lying dormant</p>
<p>sort of on the outside of the periphery of the fiber</p>
<p>will then go into the fiber.</p>
<p>It will turn into a myonuclei</p>
<p>and then it can actually increase your diameter like that.</p>
<p>And so then actually it was like,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re actually limited</p>
<p>by the amount of these satellite cells</p>
<p>you can get in and turn into nuclei.</p>
<p>And then the evidence came out that showed,</p>
<p>hey, what if you detrain?</p>
<p>So what if I used to lift weights like a long time ago</p>
<p>and I got big, but now I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of my muscle?</p>
<p>If I train again,</p>
<p>you actually get that muscle back faster</p>
<p>than it took you the very first time to build it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what we call muscle memory, like in our field.</p>
<p>Now, on your side of the equation,</p>
<p>muscle memory is something different, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>Well, when people talk about muscle memory,</p>
<p>like the ability to ride a bicycle</p>
<p>after so many years of not having tried to ride one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually largely independent of the muscle.</p>
<p>It has something to do with the muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exclusively independent of the muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a nervous system phenomenon.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Muscle memory has been co-opted by different communities</p>
<p>to mean different things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So on our side, muscle memory is going to mean</p>
<p>that ability to remember that muscle size, right?</p>
<p>That hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Because as you explained,</p>
<p>the motor control thing is that it&rsquo;s a totally a nerve thing.</p>
<p>This is the one, I&rsquo;ll give you this one.</p>
<p>You guys, the nerve people can have this one.</p>
<p>Well, it seems to me that there are</p>
<p>a tremendous number of parallels</p>
<p>between strength and hypertrophy changes and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>This is coming up again and again in this conversation</p>
<p>because we know, for instance,</p>
<p>that if you are exposed to a couple of different languages</p>
<p>early on in life,</p>
<p>you will learn any number of different languages</p>
<p>far more easily later in life.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s some crossover</p>
<p>between different languages,</p>
<p>especially Latin-based languages that allows for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a substrate for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to the ability to hop on a bicycle,</p>
<p>again, phenomenon, or play an instrument phenomenon,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s broader than that.</p>
<p>And again, I think this speaks to the huge number</p>
<p>of different adaptive changes that are occurring</p>
<p>in the cells and in the nerves that innervate these cells</p>
<p>when one experiences increases in strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So to round that out and to go back to what I was saying there</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re actually learning now is that nucleation thing.</p>
<p>And by the way, this entire trajectory story</p>
<p>is probably over the last like eight years.</p>
<p>Like this is how fast we&rsquo;ve changed our understanding</p>
<p>of how muscle grows.</p>
<p>The sarcoplasmic reticulum thing,</p>
<p>five years ago was bro signs.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s pretty well established.</p>
<p>The myonucleation thing was eight to 10 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing every week.</p>
<p>This paper we just submitted this week</p>
<p>showed actually why we had generally thought</p>
<p>a few years ago.</p>
<p>And in fact, you can find me on podcasts</p>
<p>and probably in some of my videos talking about this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna tell you right now, those things are wrong.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve just had new things come out</p>
<p>in this last couple of years</p>
<p>where that detraining effect we thought was a reason of,</p>
<p>well, what happens is if you had the muscle before</p>
<p>and you brought in these nuclei</p>
<p>and they differentiated and turned into a nuclei,</p>
<p>and then the muscle got small again,</p>
<p>you preserve those nuclei.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when you go to train again,</p>
<p>they were already around.</p>
<p>So the muscle grows faster the second time</p>
<p>than it did the first time.</p>
<p>Well, now that looks like that&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s actually probably what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a epigenetic change in the nuclei&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to access the DNA needed to grow muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effectively, the analogy we used,</p>
<p>the nuclei are remembering how to ride a bike.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite funny that you said that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really necessarily</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re being preserved over time.</p>
<p>They have learned the sequence it takes</p>
<p>to grow the protein there</p>
<p>and it happens faster the second time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also learned that there are specific nuclei.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known this for actually a while.</p>
<p>We found this in our lab and we didn&rsquo;t discover it.</p>
<p>We just saw this in our summer harbors,</p>
<p>but there are different shapes of the nuclei.</p>
<p>Some are more oval, some are more elongated.</p>
<p>And the shape determines a lot of the function.</p>
<p>Some of them are hanging out more towards the periphery</p>
<p>and some of them are hanging out right around the nucleus.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>probably different types of nuclei.</p>
<p>A lot of them that are specific to the mitochondria.</p>
<p>In fact, you can see on some of the imaging we have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just packed around the mitochondria.</p>
<p>And there are some that are probably specific</p>
<p>to injury repair.</p>
<p>And so this is probably explaining</p>
<p>a lot of the individual variation.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you&rsquo;ve said previously,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just a very, you&rsquo;re very slow at recovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that go into that.</p>
<p>And I would love to walk through sort of all the buckets,</p>
<p>maybe later into recovery.</p>
<p>But one of the inherent genetic variations</p>
<p>is could be simply that you maybe have more or less</p>
<p>of the nuclei responsible for tissue repair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been happening</p>
<p>in the last like handful of months that&rsquo;s been coming out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if that holds up as true or not.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re learning more and more almost every day</p>
<p>about muscle physiology,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s super fun and interesting</p>
<p>and I think the most exciting,</p>
<p>what to do in terms of like how to train and how to eat</p>
<p>and how to do everything else to get these adaptations</p>
<p>has been pretty well established for a long, long, long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just figuring out how like what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the muscle now, but we know what to do.</p>
<p>So from a practical standpoint,</p>
<p>putting together protocols for any outcome</p>
<p>that you want or don&rsquo;t want for any modality,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a gym, you have weights,</p>
<p>you have dumbbells only, you only have kettlebells,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna use body weight.</p>
<p>You only have three days a week, you have seven days a week,</p>
<p>you wanna maximize muscle growth,</p>
<p>you wanna get a little bit stronger.</p>
<p>Any of these variables you wanna throw at me,</p>
<p>we have a large evidence base</p>
<p>for exactly how to get those adaptations and not others.</p>
<p>So while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms</p>
<p>and the physiology, we have pretty good legs to stand</p>
<p>on terms of what to do to get whatever adaptations you want.</p>
<p>So what are the essential components</p>
<p>of an effective strength and hypertrophy protocol?</p>
<p>Okay, so what I would like to actually do</p>
<p>is walk you through both of those</p>
<p>because as we mentioned before, they overlap,</p>
<p>but the training needs to be differentiated</p>
<p>so that you can optimize either strength, hypertrophy,</p>
<p>or if you actually want, you can get a combination of both.</p>
<p>This allows you to then get the adaptation you want,</p>
<p>avoid ones you don&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>and then get it even a combination</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the preference.</p>
<p>So a lot of people will talk about,</p>
<p>I wanna get a little stronger,</p>
<p>I wanna add some muscle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different answer than someone</p>
<p>who wants to truly maximize muscle,</p>
<p>which is a different answer</p>
<p>from somebody who wants to maximize strength,</p>
<p>which is a different answer</p>
<p>from somebody who wants to maximize strength,</p>
<p>but not actually gain muscle.</p>
<p>So we have all these combinations.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>before we get into the details is a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one, we&rsquo;ve been teasing this concept so far</p>
<p>of the concepts are few, but the methods are many.</p>
<p>And so I wanna hit those concepts right now.</p>
<p>These are, as you say,</p>
<p>these are the non-negotiables</p>
<p>that have to happen in any training program.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m referring to these</p>
<p>in the strength and hypertrophy conversation,</p>
<p>but these are true of power development,</p>
<p>speed development, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>endurance, any other thing.</p>
<p>These are things that just have to happen</p>
<p>for any training program to work.</p>
<p>I mentioned one a little bit earlier, which was adherence.</p>
<p>And so my frequent collaborator, Dan Garner,</p>
<p>will constantly say consistency beats intensity.</p>
<p>Again, in fact, the literature will show you</p>
<p>very clearly adherence is the number one predictor</p>
<p>of physical fitness outcomes.</p>
<p>So we wanna do something that you will engage in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll put effort into,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to repeat consistently over time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>The second one is, and this is a major reason</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t hit their fitness goals.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue outside of not doing it,</p>
<p>the number one mistake they make is progressive overload.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna walk you through exactly</p>
<p>how much you should be increasing your sets and reps</p>
<p>and weight, et cetera, per week, per month later.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the biggest thing.</p>
<p>You have got to have some sort of overload.</p>
<p>The body works as an adaptation mechanism, right?</p>
<p>So in fact, we talked previously</p>
<p>about the Harvard Fatigue Lab.</p>
<p>And one of the things actually people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is the concept of homeostasis</p>
<p>comes from research at the Harvard Fatigue Lab.</p>
<p>It was work that they did on an endurance runner,</p>
<p>I forget his name.</p>
<p>And they sort of realized</p>
<p>that after a long period of time working out,</p>
<p>this is an acute exercise about,</p>
<p>the body actually comes back to some stable place</p>
<p>despite the fact he was continuing to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what bore the phrase steady state.</p>
<p>And that actually, then they launched off and said,</p>
<p>wow, there&rsquo;s this state that the body wants to be in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll call this homeostasis.</p>
<p>So those all concepts came out of exercise physiology,</p>
<p>which is really, really cool, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get a lot of love a lot of times scientifically,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good one that we took.</p>
<p>So why that all matters</p>
<p>is we have got to achieve some sort of overload</p>
<p>without going excess.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll cover that later exactly what to do</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll potentially get into overtraining</p>
<p>and monitoring and things like that.</p>
<p>But you have to have some sort of</p>
<p>consistent predictable overload.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to cause adaptation</p>
<p>to continue to cause stress.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>you can still do things like burn calories.</p>
<p>You can still get some of the other benefits of exercise</p>
<p>like improved mood, cognitive function, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera, flexibility increases.</p>
<p>All of those can happen without a progressive overload.</p>
<p>But if you want to see these gains in strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy, you really need to progressively overload.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s concept number two.</p>
<p>The third one here is going to be individualization.</p>
<p>And this is where we can get into things</p>
<p>like personal preference, equipment availability.</p>
<p>You have kettlebells or dumbbells,</p>
<p>or you only have bands or you have none of that.</p>
<p>These are all smaller details,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s an important component to it.</p>
<p>The last one I really want to get into</p>
<p>is picking the appropriate target.</p>
<p>And we went through this when we talked</p>
<p>about the fitness protocol.</p>
<p>And if you run through something like that</p>
<p>and you run some testing and figure out</p>
<p>where your biggest limitations are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you identify where you need to go.</p>
<p>So if you can do all those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a good spot</p>
<p>to balance specificity and variation.</p>
<p>All right, so if you want to make sure you grow your biceps,</p>
<p>you better make sure your biceps are working.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you over-rely on specificity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to increase the likelihood of overuse injuries,</p>
<p>which is going to come back</p>
<p>and actually hamper consistency over time.</p>
<p>All right, so this is when hedging</p>
<p>towards specificity is important,</p>
<p>but too much can cause a problem.</p>
<p>If you go the other direction and you go too much variation,</p>
<p>so imagine you&rsquo;re just sort of doing</p>
<p>all kinds of different exercises every time you work out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not enough stimuli</p>
<p>directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wanting to learn a new movement</p>
<p>to get you very far.</p>
<p>And so this is a classic problem of I&rsquo;m doing a lot of work,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a very clear direction.</p>
<p>I lack specificity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m working, but I&rsquo;m not seeing a lot of improvements.</p>
<p>And this is like in the business world, et cetera,</p>
<p>this is like doing a whole bunch of different things</p>
<p>means you get nothing really done.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the game we&rsquo;re going to play here, right?</p>
<p>How do we overload this stuff?</p>
<p>How do we make sure we&rsquo;re balancing specificity</p>
<p>and variation?</p>
<p>How do we make sure I want to do this?</p>
<p>And then how do I individualize it</p>
<p>for my needs and circumstances and movement restrictions</p>
<p>and of time availability and my calendar</p>
<p>and desires and all of these things.</p>
<p>So those are the concepts we absolutely have to hit.</p>
<p>The methods that we choose run across a handful of variables</p>
<p>and we call these things modifiable variables</p>
<p>because as you modify them</p>
<p>or you make different choices within these variables,</p>
<p>you get different outcomes or adaptations.</p>
<p>This is exactly what determines the nine adaptations</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>So the way that I like to say this is</p>
<p>exercises do not determine adaptation.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t simply go, I want to get stronger.</p>
<p>Therefore I&rsquo;m going to choose these exercises.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>What determines adaptation</p>
<p>is the execution of the exercises.</p>
<p>So a deadlift is my favorite example.</p>
<p>A deadlift is a common example that people think of</p>
<p>when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise.</p>
<p>But a deadlift will not increase your strength</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re executing it in the proper fashion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even talking about technique here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about these modifiable variables.</p>
<p>The same thing for power exercises.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll commonly see mistakes of doing activities</p>
<p>like a box jump, which is great.</p>
<p>People think, oh, I&rsquo;m going to improve my power,</p>
<p>which we know is extremely highly correlated</p>
<p>to activities of daily living</p>
<p>and particularly living unassisted as you age, right,</p>
<p>is reduction of power.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll do an activity like a box jump.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re failing to realize is</p>
<p>unless you do it powerfully,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t actually increase power.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t move fast, you won&rsquo;t get faster.</p>
<p>So the way that we manipulate these variables</p>
<p>is everything to determining the adaptation you get</p>
<p>or again, don&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>So with that foundation,</p>
<p>I think we can kind of run right into these things</p>
<p>and we can start off with perhaps speed and power.</p>
<p>And what I would like to do is walk you through</p>
<p>all those modifiable variables, what to do with them,</p>
<p>and then hit you with as many different methodologies</p>
<p>as we really have time for.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll move on to strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and kind of round the entire thing out.</p>
<p>And then maybe at the end,</p>
<p>we can talk some other variables like</p>
<p>what happens if I have a training protocol</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m halfway through it and I can&rsquo;t finish my workout.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Reduce my weight or reduce my duration or things like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of what if scenarios that we can go through</p>
<p>that potentially a lot of people listening</p>
<p>have questions about.</p>
<p>So sound like a plan?</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>out there, however, is that you get information back</p>
<p>about various levels of lipids and hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform that lets you see</p>
<p>what your specific numbers are, of course,</p>
<p>but then also what sorts of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>So just to interrupt briefly and make sure</p>
<p>that I and everybody else have in mind</p>
<p>the proper nine adaptations that we&rsquo;ve been referring to</p>
<p>and that were discussed in detail in episode one,</p>
<p>I have listed number one, skill and technique,</p>
<p>number two, speed, number three, power,</p>
<p>which is speed times force, number four, strength,</p>
<p>number five, hypertrophy, number six, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>number seven, anaerobic capacity,</p>
<p>number eight, maximal aerobic capacity,</p>
<p>and number nine, long duration steady state exercise.</p>
<p>Yep, you nailed it.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>It was probably important clarification for everybody.</p>
<p>So that being said, let&rsquo;s jump right into speed and power.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll do these a little bit simultaneously.</p>
<p>They are different.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a high performance athlete,</p>
<p>you really need to separate these two things.</p>
<p>For the most people though,</p>
<p>we can probably think about them as the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of pure speed training</p>
<p>that the general public is interested in.</p>
<p>If you wanna actually further break down speed,</p>
<p>there are multiple components.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s acceleration, there&rsquo;s top end velocity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s change of direction or agility and things like that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll just kind of call them all that speed</p>
<p>and power for now.</p>
<p>Now, at the onset, there&rsquo;s this three to five concept</p>
<p>that we talked about many times</p>
<p>where this is really fairly true for speed,</p>
<p>power, or strength.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t develop the three to five.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an easy way to help you remember one concept</p>
<p>that will run true across all these things.</p>
<p>So three to five, it refers to three to five days per week.</p>
<p>Pick three to five exercises,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do three to five repetitions per set.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do three to five sets,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll rest three to five minutes between each set.</p>
<p>If you do that and you execute</p>
<p>any of the exercises that you choose at a high intent,</p>
<p>and that part is critical.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get faster by moving kind of fast.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t improve power by moving like, eh, powerfully.</p>
<p>You have to be trying,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you&rsquo;re actually moving faster or not.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re talking about speed or power,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re by definition using submaximal weights.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to be able to lift it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the question.</p>
<p>The question is how fast can you lift that implement?</p>
<p>And so intention is incredibly important.</p>
<p>So if you do that, the same for strength, by the way.</p>
<p>So if you land on that,</p>
<p>that allows you to run the gamut</p>
<p>from as little as three days a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing three exercises,</p>
<p>you can do three sets of three,</p>
<p>which is a very, very low volume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very low amount of days, easy to handle.</p>
<p>All the way to five sets of five,</p>
<p>of five exercises, five days a week.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s just one sample.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something easy to remember.</p>
<p>And is quite effective for a very long time.</p>
<p>And this has been tested quite extensively</p>
<p>in both the coaching realms,</p>
<p>as well as the scientific realms,</p>
<p>to be quite productive and easy to follow and grasp.</p>
<p>If you do that,</p>
<p>all you need to do is slightly increase the load</p>
<p>or the volume, but mostly the load over time.</p>
<p>And the number we want to look for there</p>
<p>is something like a three to 5% increase per week.</p>
<p>So an example would be if you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>an exercise at a hundred pounds,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t necessarily just add five pounds every week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to get tough to you pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And so you may have to run a smaller increment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing like a lower body exercise</p>
<p>where you might have a couple of hundred pounds</p>
<p>on the weight,</p>
<p>you can probably get away with adding five pounds</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still a low percentage of the total load.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s roughly the guide that we want to get to</p>
<p>for speed, power, and strength.</p>
<p>So that sounds incredibly simple and effective.</p>
<p>Yet I have a number of questions.</p>
<p>First off, if somebody is using the three to five approach,</p>
<p>does that mean they should not be doing</p>
<p>any other weight training of any kind</p>
<p>in those workouts or at all?</p>
<p>No, you can certainly do that in combination</p>
<p>with anything else you would like,</p>
<p>especially if you think about speed and power.</p>
<p>Those are very non-fatiguing.</p>
<p>And so if you can imagine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go to the beach</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to take a 10 pound</p>
<p>to 20 pound medicine ball with you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to do four different exercises</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re throwing the medicine ball</p>
<p>as high as you can in the air,</p>
<p>four times in a row, taking a break,</p>
<p>and you do two or three hits of that.</p>
<p>You do maybe three or four different types of throws.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good for improving power, extremely good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not very fatiguing.</p>
<p>So you could certainly finish that workout in 20 minutes</p>
<p>and then run on and then do any number of other things.</p>
<p>So you could do some high intensity anaerobic capacity work.</p>
<p>You could do steady state stuff.</p>
<p>You could even do hypertrophy on top of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two major categories</p>
<p>of what we call periodization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many, many, many of them,</p>
<p>but the two that have the most scientific literature</p>
<p>are what&rsquo;s called linear periodization.</p>
<p>And another is called undulating</p>
<p>or often daily undulating periodization.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m flagging these two, again,</p>
<p>despite the fact there are many, many, many more</p>
<p>because they represent two different concepts</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d actually just touched upon.</p>
<p>So linear periodization is a hallmark</p>
<p>by basically saying we&rsquo;re going to train</p>
<p>one adaptation at a time.</p>
<p>So imagine going say six to eight weeks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re only doing strength</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re only doing hypertrophy</p>
<p>or endurance for that matter.</p>
<p>So in that particular case,</p>
<p>you would not do anything else in combination.</p>
<p>If you contrast that to undulating periodization,</p>
<p>you would actually be doing multiple different styles</p>
<p>of training either within the same day</p>
<p>or just different days.</p>
<p>So it could be Monday is power, Wednesday is strength,</p>
<p>Friday is hypertrophy, whatever.</p>
<p>Or it could be a little bit of strength every single day,</p>
<p>a little bit of hypertrophy every day,</p>
<p>a little bit of power every day.</p>
<p>And you would just change the amount</p>
<p>of each that you do within the day to alter the emphasis.</p>
<p>All right, now, if you look at the studies</p>
<p>and there have been many RCTs on this,</p>
<p>the result of both of these training programs</p>
<p>is generally basically the same thing.</p>
<p>They are equally effective.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the major difference though.</p>
<p>One, if your goal is very specific to one outcome,</p>
<p>you wanna hedge towards specificity.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, hey, I&rsquo;m trying to maximize</p>
<p>the amount of muscle I can build in the next eight weeks,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t really, anything else besides that</p>
<p>is just distraction and potential interference.</p>
<p>Does it really matter or not?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it&rsquo;s not helping anything else.</p>
<p>So linear periodization is fundamental at providing focus.</p>
<p>And therefore the adaptations tend to be oftentimes larger</p>
<p>in that specific area.</p>
<p>And that downside is you now go six to eight to 10 weeks</p>
<p>of doing nothing else.</p>
<p>And so you are losing those other adaptations</p>
<p>that are great at a faster rate.</p>
<p>And you can imagine doing something like speed work only.</p>
<p>Again, speed work by definition is non-fatiguing.</p>
<p>So when oftentimes we think of speed work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, I did ladder drills</p>
<p>and I did all these things and like I threw up at the end.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not speed work.</p>
<p>You just did a different type of endurance training,</p>
<p>okay, which is great and important.</p>
<p>So true speed work is very high rest,</p>
<p>very low fatigue and actually truly trying to reach</p>
<p>a new level of speed or velocity.</p>
<p>So non-fatiguing.</p>
<p>If you did that exclusively for 10 weeks,</p>
<p>you would be pretty unfit by the end of it.</p>
<p>Because you would also lose a decent amount of muscle mass,</p>
<p>not because there&rsquo;s an interference effect,</p>
<p>but simply because of the fact</p>
<p>you have not stimulated muscle growth for eight to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>And so neither one of these is better than the other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna see this classically</p>
<p>across all program design or periodization strategies</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just a give and take.</p>
<p>There are tons of different systems</p>
<p>and perhaps at the end, we can talk about</p>
<p>some of the more advanced periodization styles.</p>
<p>These ones are both effective.</p>
<p>You could do these with beginners,</p>
<p>you could do these with advanced athletes,</p>
<p>you could do them any spectrum,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re some of the more well-documented ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pro and con game, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what are you willing to give up?</p>
<p>The way that you solve that problem</p>
<p>is going back to that fitness assessment and your analysis</p>
<p>and really truly understanding what your goal is.</p>
<p>Is your goal to do a little bit of strength</p>
<p>and a little bit of, okay, great.</p>
<p>Maybe undulated periodization is an approach.</p>
<p>If your goal is really to maximize strength</p>
<p>and maybe you can wait on putting some muscle mass on,</p>
<p>maybe linear periodization is a better approach</p>
<p>or another style of periodization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimal for strength gain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just simply about addressing your things.</p>
<p>One of the major problems folks have</p>
<p>in addition to lacking progressive overload</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t have any foresight</p>
<p>past the next day of the training, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really important that you set off blocks</p>
<p>that are anywhere between six to 12 weeks long</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to have the specific plan.</p>
<p>Ideally, you have an idea for the whole year.</p>
<p>I actually have like a structure</p>
<p>I could walk you through for that.</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>really think about what you want the next 12 weeks</p>
<p>and then maybe the next 12 weeks after that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna give you a lot of guidance</p>
<p>about what to do and what to focus on.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>What about warming up?</p>
<p>I was taught that one should do higher repetition movements</p>
<p>with lighter weights in order to warm up.</p>
<p>And then one of the things</p>
<p>that did make a big positive difference for me</p>
<p>in terms of strength and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>was to do a moderate repetition warmup</p>
<p>with a fairly lightweight,</p>
<p>but then to actually keep the number</p>
<p>of warmup repetitions fairly low</p>
<p>and work progressively toward the first so-called work set.</p>
<p>When you say three to five,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three to five work sets, correct?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Are you also gonna tell me three to five warmups?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you also gonna tell me</p>
<p>that it has to be done between three and 5 p.m.?</p>
<p>So in terms of-</p>
<p>With three to five friends?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, what does a good warmup look like?</p>
<p>And I realize this will vary</p>
<p>depending on how cool your training environment is,</p>
<p>time of day, et cetera.</p>
<p>But as a kind of umbrella for a good warmup,</p>
<p>what should people do?</p>
<p>The, you&rsquo;ve already sort of jumped the gun with my answer.</p>
<p>It is honestly very dependent upon the person.</p>
<p>So some folks respond very well to a minimum warmup.</p>
<p>Others, I&rsquo;ve had lots of actually professional fighters</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with where the,</p>
<p>I actually have a major league baseball player right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best pitchers in the game,</p>
<p>probably the best.</p>
<p>And the longer we warm up, the better his numbers get.</p>
<p>We actually did a vertical jump test with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna kill me because he got so mad.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how long it sort of took him</p>
<p>to reach a peak vertical jump.</p>
<p>And most times this takes people</p>
<p>something like five to 10 sort of reps.</p>
<p>And I said, take it up all the way</p>
<p>to a maximum vertical jump.</p>
<p>And then what I want you to do is continue to jumping</p>
<p>until you have three consecutive jumps</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re down lower than 90%.</p>
<p>And so what we were trying to look at is sort of,</p>
<p>when is he gonna break?</p>
<p>Because in baseball,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna throw like a hundred pitchers or so.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to figure out when is his peak velocity</p>
<p>on his fastball gonna drop</p>
<p>and sort of basis conditioning on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different style of conditioning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s power endurance is really what it is.</p>
<p>He called me in the middle of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, he done whatever.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like, no,</p>
<p>like how many of these am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>And I was like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m on rep 130 or something.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what rep did you peak on?</p>
<p>He peaked on rep 70, something like that.</p>
<p>69, I think technically, cause he&rsquo;s goofy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a classic example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in for many, many years.</p>
<p>We have a ton of data on him, a ton of biological data,</p>
<p>a ton of neuromuscular stuff, like all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>And it just, the more he warms up,</p>
<p>an absurd amount of warmup, the better he gets.</p>
<p>And the better he gets in power production</p>
<p>and the better he gets in speed and velocity.</p>
<p>So his warmup prior to games is, it&rsquo;s totally absurd.</p>
<p>And just the more volume we throw at him,</p>
<p>the better he does.</p>
<p>I have other folks, you get past like two or three reps</p>
<p>and fatigue starts to set in.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re actually like reducing power production.</p>
<p>So there is a ton of variation that goes in that.</p>
<p>I can give you some guidelines though.</p>
<p>You need to differentiate</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re training for speed, power, strength,</p>
<p>or hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>If we understand a little bit about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s causing the adaptation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to tell you what you need to do or avoid.</p>
<p>For example, volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Intensity is the primary driver</p>
<p>in speed, power, and strength.</p>
<p>All right, what that means is,</p>
<p>you need to preserve intensity for the first three.</p>
<p>You need to preserve volume in the second one at most.</p>
<p>So if your warmup is so extensive in the hypertrophy</p>
<p>training that it compromises your training volume</p>
<p>because of fatigue,</p>
<p>even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re actually probably walking yourself backwards</p>
<p>by doing that extensive.</p>
<p>You would have been better off</p>
<p>starting your first working set slightly suboptimal, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not really,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just trying to accrue volume at that point.</p>
<p>Strength and power is the opposite.</p>
<p>Until you&rsquo;re moving very, very fast or powerfully,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really causing the adaptation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no point in starting a working set</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re really basically at 100%.</p>
<p>So the warmup should be as long as it takes you to get</p>
<p>to where your mobility is in the right spot,</p>
<p>like your joints feel good, you feel fresh,</p>
<p>you feel activated, and you really feel peak power.</p>
<p>Anything before that is a warmup set.</p>
<p>In the sport of Olympic weightlifting,</p>
<p>a lot of times the coaches will measure barbell velocity.</p>
<p>Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot of data</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s called velocity-based training.</p>
<p>Brian Mann at Missouri and Miami, tons of work here.</p>
<p>And generally those communities</p>
<p>are not going to count any repetition as a working set</p>
<p>until you exceed 70% of your one rep max.</p>
<p>Where that&rsquo;s changed because of a lot of people</p>
<p>doing the velocity-based stuff</p>
<p>is now they&rsquo;re basing that simply on an achieved velocity.</p>
<p>And so really the warmup is irrelevant.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even, it&rsquo;s sort of just like do whatever you want</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna measure the barbell</p>
<p>until you actually hit an outcome.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re at what a working set.</p>
<p>So different ways to think about it,</p>
<p>depending on what you&rsquo;re training for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you a little bit of a guideline.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for anything past hypertrophy,</p>
<p>then really, and especially even hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it just comes down to, are you feeling ready to work?</p>
<p>Are you cold?</p>
<p>Are you moving through the correct positions?</p>
<p>And if all those things are fine,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you start a little bit early</p>
<p>and save some gas at the end of it,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re a person like you</p>
<p>who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly</p>
<p>relative to Trevor,</p>
<p>who just has no response to fatigue whatsoever.</p>
<p>Is it useful to do more warmup</p>
<p>at the beginning of a workout,</p>
<p>say before the first exercise,</p>
<p>and then once one has achieved</p>
<p>both local and systemic warmup, in air quotes,</p>
<p>then perhaps on the second or third exercise,</p>
<p>fourth exercise, et cetera,</p>
<p>and then one or maybe even zero warmups?</p>
<p>Yeah, fair point.</p>
<p>We generally think about warmups in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>This is a really actually, this is a very clever question.</p>
<p>You wanna have some sort of general global warmup scheme.</p>
<p>We tend to prefer dynamic warmups.</p>
<p>So this is whole body movements</p>
<p>rather than like sitting and stretching,</p>
<p>static stretching, things like that.</p>
<p>So something that involves momentum.</p>
<p>Yeah, momentum or movement, right?</p>
<p>So this is like, think about this in like old gym class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your high knees and your butt kickers</p>
<p>and just different things like that</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re moving in different planes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving joints through tons of range of motion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a lot of movement there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting the local warmup.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also getting the total systemic activation.</p>
<p>Everything else is going on there.</p>
<p>So that is what we consider to be a general warmup.</p>
<p>Five minutes is a very sufficient number,</p>
<p>perhaps 10 if you&rsquo;re a slow goer,</p>
<p>achy and some things like that.</p>
<p>And you really gotta get the ankle warmed up.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing lower body stuff,</p>
<p>really make sure that that&rsquo;s moving correctly.</p>
<p>The hips and knees will follow.</p>
<p>Upper body stuff really get the shoulder blades</p>
<p>and the neck, like making sure you&rsquo;re going there</p>
<p>and the elbows will follow after that.</p>
<p>So five to seven minutes of a general warmup.</p>
<p>A lot of the times like classic exercise science,</p>
<p>it will even just put you on a bike,</p>
<p>cycling for five minutes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that personally.</p>
<p>Dynamic movement is more preferred.</p>
<p>If you really just move for five to seven minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be fine there.</p>
<p>Now, specificity within each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that your first exercise of the day</p>
<p>is generally the thing you&rsquo;ve prioritized.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s oftentimes the most important you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>It oftentimes is also the most complex</p>
<p>and the most moving parts.</p>
<p>So it tends to be multi-joint.</p>
<p>It tends, therefore you need to have</p>
<p>movement precision and skill dialed, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t typically start your workouts off</p>
<p>with the forearm curl, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a tremendous amount of warmup</p>
<p>to get going on that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start off with medicine ball throws</p>
<p>or a snatch or some agility work.</p>
<p>You need to have the whole system going</p>
<p>because multiple joints are moving,</p>
<p>position matters, technique.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of skill requirement, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the individualized workout</p>
<p>or the specific workout for the specific movement</p>
<p>for that very first one,</p>
<p>my general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes</p>
<p>to move perfect in that first exercise.</p>
<p>Past that, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to do</p>
<p>individualized warmups for your next movements</p>
<p>unless it is a movement you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>or just even get a little bit better at.</p>
<p>Like drop the load a little bit,</p>
<p>work on accruing some practice reps, fantastic.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s another dissimilar complex movement.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say your first exercise was a front squat</p>
<p>and you got loaded for that</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re gonna move into a pull-up</p>
<p>but your mechanics aren&rsquo;t the best there</p>
<p>and so you really need to change</p>
<p>and do some maybe more specific activation warmups</p>
<p>for that or something else,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s running or something totally different.</p>
<p>So yeah, you don&rsquo;t need to rewarm up</p>
<p>for every single exercise as you go.</p>
<p>Generally, once you&rsquo;re good to go,</p>
<p>the same muscles that you&rsquo;re going to use</p>
<p>in the next exercise are warm, same joints,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>You talked about intent within the movement.</p>
<p>What about specific cadences for repetitions?</p>
<p>I was taught that one should lower the weight slowly,</p>
<p>the so-called eccentric portion of the movement,</p>
<p>and then to try and explode the weight</p>
<p>through the concentric phase,</p>
<p>and then also make sure that one is using</p>
<p>full range of motion and perfect form as it were.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that is one tiny slice</p>
<p>of the possible rep cadences</p>
<p>and ways to approach resistance training,</p>
<p>although I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good one.</p>
<p>What are the general parameter sets</p>
<p>that one needs to consider?</p>
<p>You could imagine lifting with four seconds concentric,</p>
<p>pause for one, pause for two.</p>
<p>Eccentric, I realize there&rsquo;s an infinite number</p>
<p>of variations here,</p>
<p>but is there a way to use rep cadence,</p>
<p>repetition cadence that is,</p>
<p>as a way to work through weak points</p>
<p>and to be strong in every position of the movement?</p>
<p>Yeah, a lovely question.</p>
<p>I think the way I would like to answer this</p>
<p>is maybe going back just a touch to get directly to that.</p>
<p>So I think if we walk through power,</p>
<p>strength, and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and I hit you with the concepts</p>
<p>that are specific to each one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to lay out your answer</p>
<p>because the most true answer there</p>
<p>is it depends on the goal.</p>
<p>The answer for what is optimal for strength</p>
<p>is diametrically opposed for potentially</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s optimized for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>The same exact thing can be said for momentum.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve classically heard things like this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bounce at the bottom, you&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing a lap pull down or something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t bounce and rebound.</p>
<p>You stop at the bottom, slow down.</p>
<p>All of these things are thought to be truisms</p>
<p>of strength conditioning, but guess what?</p>
<p>Those are all truisms assuming</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to grow muscle.</p>
<p>And that actually goes back to our conversation</p>
<p>in episode one about a lot of the things</p>
<p>we think are just fundamental truths about strength training</p>
<p>are just fundamental truths</p>
<p>that came from the bodybuilding world.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not wrong, they&rsquo;re good ideas,</p>
<p>but there are other adaptations one needs to get</p>
<p>from strength training</p>
<p>that are not just maximizing muscle growth.</p>
<p>So what I will lay out to you</p>
<p>is a case for which you should bounce,</p>
<p>a case for when you should go fast,</p>
<p>a case for when you should be under control.</p>
<p>All of these things are different variables</p>
<p>we can modify and get different adaptations for.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you could lay out for us</p>
<p>optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically</p>
<p>versus hypertrophy specifically,</p>
<p>just to sort of bookend the conversation</p>
<p>and then migrate toward the middle</p>
<p>in terms of rep cadences that would satisfy</p>
<p>the desire to have a bit of both?</p>
<p>We can get pretty close.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when you&rsquo;re talking about strength</p>
<p>versus hypertrophy, remember strength is movement.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy is muscle size.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key to your answer here.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to get stronger,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re effectively trying to do</p>
<p>is get better at producing a certain amount of force</p>
<p>through movement, okay?</p>
<p>Now, force is mass times acceleration.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the mass in the bar</p>
<p>multiplied by how well I can accelerate it?</p>
<p>Intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to argue that going slower</p>
<p>is going to improve strength</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re simply reducing acceleration.</p>
<p>So you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean if you&rsquo;re trying to get stronger,</p>
<p>there are no phases of your training</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;ll slow down?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>There are certain rules in different organizations</p>
<p>where you have to pause the bottom.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all kinds of little things like that.</p>
<p>But in general, we wanna think about</p>
<p>what are we trying to do here?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get better at moving a heavier mass</p>
<p>at a faster rate of acceleration.</p>
<p>That is more force.</p>
<p>That is more strength.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy is not that.</p>
<p>The goal here is not a functional outcome.</p>
<p>It is what is needed to cause</p>
<p>the most amount of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And when you get to hypertrophy then,</p>
<p>your optimal cadence is up to you.</p>
<p>You can do any combination.</p>
<p>In fact, you could do it the same exact cadence</p>
<p>that you did your strength training with</p>
<p>and get the same adaptations as hypertrophy</p>
<p>if you modify the other variables appropriately.</p>
<p>Or you could go slower.</p>
<p>Or you could do pauses.</p>
<p>Or you could do a thing that is called triphasic training</p>
<p>where you spend the first phase</p>
<p>several weeks of your training</p>
<p>where you do eccentrics only.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just lowering the bar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically stopping.</p>
<p>You could then do the next phase of your training</p>
<p>which is isometrics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just holding at that bottom position.</p>
<p>And in the next phase of your training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focusing on the concentric portion of it, right?</p>
<p>Triphasic, one, two, three,</p>
<p>eccentric, isometric, concentric.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fantastic way of developing actually strength,</p>
<p>a little bit of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re manipulating the variables</p>
<p>in terms of how you execute the repetition range.</p>
<p>You can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy</p>
<p>moving the weight fast, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>even down slow under control.</p>
<p>Now, one thing where we&rsquo;ll never advocate</p>
<p>is moving any sort of weight or load uncontrolled.</p>
<p>The assumption here when I&rsquo;m saying go fast</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re always in control.</p>
<p>I never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum</p>
<p>with a barbell after it does.</p>
<p>But you can move at a lot of rates.</p>
<p>The isometric I mentioned,</p>
<p>because this is when things like body weight training</p>
<p>come into play.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you can gain strength.</p>
<p>And even a little bit of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>especially in the upper body, doing isometrics,</p>
<p>is much harder to do this with the lower body.</p>
<p>You outrun that coverage really quickly.</p>
<p>You need load, but there&rsquo;s a lot of ways.</p>
<p>This is also probably why people have done things</p>
<p>like gone to yoga only or Pilates</p>
<p>or some of these things that are body weight based</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no external load</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve actually increased muscle size.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m getting the picture there are a ton of options</p>
<p>in terms of rep cadences.</p>
<p>However, can we say that one should pick</p>
<p>a given rep cadence within an exercise</p>
<p>rather than changing it from set to set within an exercise</p>
<p>or that one should perhaps even pick a certain rep cadence</p>
<p>for an entire workout?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspecting that your answer is going to be, it depends.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>But if, you know, I&rsquo;m not gonna use that</p>
<p>if you had a gun to your head kind of situation,</p>
<p>but if you had a gun to your head,</p>
<p>what would be the rep cadence that you would prescribe</p>
<p>for strictly strength or as much strength</p>
<p>with as little hypertrophy as possible?</p>
<p>And in picking that rep cadence,</p>
<p>then it therefore has to thread</p>
<p>throughout the entire exercise bout.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually right.</p>
<p>Because of that undulating periodization stuff</p>
<p>I talked about, you can actually do this in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>So you could do one exercise at the beginning</p>
<p>where you have a set cadence,</p>
<p>say a 3-1-1 is like a very one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s lifting for three,</p>
<p>pause for one, lower for one?</p>
<p>Generally the opposite.</p>
<p>Okay, so the first number is always the eccentric.</p>
<p>Generally.</p>
<p>Okay, so lowering the weight for a count of three,</p>
<p>pause for one.</p>
<p>It totally depends on the exercise.</p>
<p>Like a deadlift starts concentric and finishes eccentric,</p>
<p>but a bench press starts the opposite.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s start to finish.</p>
<p>Start to finish is the better way to think about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ll clarify actually.</p>
<p>When we say 3-1-1, we&rsquo;re generally talking about</p>
<p>almost always the eccentric is the slower portion,</p>
<p>regardless if it&rsquo;s the first or the last, right?</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re doing a bench press</p>
<p>where the eccentric is lowering the bar to your chest,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first part of the movement.</p>
<p>One, two, three, pause one, one up,</p>
<p>which means accelerate as hard as you can on the way up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you describe.</p>
<p>Right, as opposed to say a row.</p>
<p>A row, which is actually gonna be starting off concentric.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be pulling that thing to your chest</p>
<p>as fast as you can under control,</p>
<p>not slamming off your chest, holding for one second,</p>
<p>and then taking three seconds to lower it back</p>
<p>on the rack or on the ground or whatever.</p>
<p>So the reason we do that is somewhat intuitive,</p>
<p>but it is, again, to make sure you&rsquo;re not advancing a bar</p>
<p>or an implement onto your physical body</p>
<p>at an extremely fast rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>So a 3-1-1 is a very standard strength protocol</p>
<p>that is something you can just run with.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s all you ever wanted to do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be absolutely fine.</p>
<p>Lower the bar for a count of three.</p>
<p>It actually ends up being approximately three, right?</p>
<p>Because hardly anybody is counting off seconds precisely.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s doable, but then pausing briefly.</p>
<p>Yep, and that brief is almost,</p>
<p>that pause is almost unmeasurable.</p>
<p>It is simply, are you under control</p>
<p>before you transition from the eccentric</p>
<p>to concentric or concentric each time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a safety thing.</p>
<p>So once you feel down, you&rsquo;ve reached</p>
<p>complete range of motion, you&rsquo;re ready to transition,</p>
<p>then just go.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need to go like thousand one</p>
<p>and then go up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just making sure, again,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t slam weights off of body parts.</p>
<p>And that final one in the 3-1-1 is the execution</p>
<p>of the usually concentric portion of the exercise.</p>
<p>Yep, as fast as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Okay, so that would be for the majority</p>
<p>of the outcome being strength.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Okay, and of course we should acknowledge,</p>
<p>again, there are a ton of variations</p>
<p>that one could implement there,</p>
<p>but that would be a good starting place.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, for somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s mainly interested in hypertrophy,</p>
<p>what would be the rep cadence that,</p>
<p>if you had a gun to your head, that you would prescribe?</p>
<p>I would probably do the exact same thing,</p>
<p>but I would make the last number two.</p>
<p>So three, one, two.</p>
<p>You could also just keep 3-1-1.</p>
<p>It is still very fine.</p>
<p>Even exploding on the concentric is still highly effective</p>
<p>for training hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to keep it super simple</p>
<p>and just make rep cadence not a variable</p>
<p>that you play with,</p>
<p>because you have other ones to move, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you want to add a little bit of time</p>
<p>to the concentric phase, fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to make enough of a difference</p>
<p>for most people for you to really worry about.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s sort of the point I really want to make.</p>
<p>This is, we&rsquo;re classically,</p>
<p>this is a classic example of we&rsquo;re deep into a method.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>As long as you hit the concepts I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>whether you want to do 3-1-1, 3-2-3, 3-3-3,</p>
<p>triphasic, this is just a method choice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re irrelevant.</p>
<p>There are subtle changes within them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just 80-20 rule, right?</p>
<p>So 80% of the benefit is going to be from the concept.</p>
<p>20% is this small thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re super into this field,</p>
<p>or you actually want to work with a qualified,</p>
<p>certified coach or something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of reasons to play with this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just on your own here and running this thing,</p>
<p>3-1-1 is fine, 3-1-2, totally fine.</p>
<p>Anything like that.</p>
<p>You really just want to make sure</p>
<p>that in the strength side of the equation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re under control and you can add enough load</p>
<p>to stimulate strength</p>
<p>and not get hurt with an acute trauma, right?</p>
<p>On the hypertrophy side,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just wanting to load enough</p>
<p>to where you can hit volume</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got to put a lot on there.</p>
<p>So if you want to go lighter,</p>
<p>if you want to go slower, fine.</p>
<p>If you go slower in your repetition,</p>
<p>so maybe even like a five-second eccentric,</p>
<p>a two-second pause, a three-second rise, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You can actually then stimulate</p>
<p>the same amount of hypertrophy</p>
<p>and either do it with less weight</p>
<p>or do it with less repetitions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a variable you can play with if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey, I don&rsquo;t have enough weights at my house</p>
<p>or I only have a kettlebell or a dumbbell.</p>
<p>How am I going to stimulate hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Your only option is really doing more reps.</p>
<p>Well, eventually that train runs pretty shallow.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the thing you can play with.</p>
<p>Maybe just add time under tension,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re calling, right?</p>
<p>Just do slower repetitions, go longer ones and hold it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a variable that we use to individualize programs</p>
<p>rather than something that you should really be focused on</p>
<p>as like a core aspect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be driving whether or not your program works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a tool we can play with in the what-if scenarios.</p>
<p>I will use this stuff a lot when I&rsquo;m traveling.</p>
<p>You can do a tremendous workout in your hotel room</p>
<p>just doing like a 10-second eccentric,</p>
<p>a 10-second hold, a 10-centric concentric.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had some decent hotel room workouts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not my preference,</p>
<p>but by simply doing things like</p>
<p>10-second lowering handstand push-up against the door.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Obviously assisted for me,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do a free handstand push-up.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have the skill or the strength or both.</p>
<p>You can do some sort of configured dips</p>
<p>between the beds or chairs and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Rear foot elevated split squats are great to do in hotels.</p>
<p>Put your back foot up on a bed</p>
<p>and get an amazing split squat workout done.</p>
<p>Yeah, glute bridges, lots of stuff you can do there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and with a jump rope.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard someone jumping in the morning,</p>
<p>yeah, it may or may not have been me.</p>
<p>It could be any number of things,</p>
<p>but I am known to skip rope in hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Not to get overly detailed,</p>
<p>but I think there are going to be a number of people</p>
<p>wondering about how to breathe during repetitions</p>
<p>and how to breathe in between sets.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to just briefly touch on this.</p>
<p>And this is something that I know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to return to again</p>
<p>when we have our discussion about recovery.</p>
<p>But is there a general rule of thumb</p>
<p>for how to breathe during repetitions,</p>
<p>during work for strength,</p>
<p>maybe even strength versus hypertrophy</p>
<p>in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system?</p>
<p>You know, it keeps you alert and conscious,</p>
<p>but that also protects the body</p>
<p>by creating some rigidity in the system, right?</p>
<p>Because certainly being with all your air exhaled,</p>
<p>the body is a very different beast</p>
<p>in terms of stability than with the body full of air</p>
<p>versus breathing during the repetition movement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a maneuver that has long been</p>
<p>labeled the Valsalva technique.</p>
<p>So what that really means is you&rsquo;re trying to use air</p>
<p>to create intra-abdominal pressure.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re really trying to do</p>
<p>is create a cylinder around your spine.</p>
<p>The real issue you have to play here</p>
<p>is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to breathe and brace.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is you should be able to create</p>
<p>total intra-abdominal pressure,</p>
<p>regulate spine control while breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very hard for a lot of people to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skill you should absolutely work on.</p>
<p>You can actually, you can do this and you can go around.</p>
<p>Like I do this trick in class and students can come</p>
<p>and I can push any part of my entire abdomen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super tight and I can talk.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit labor.</p>
<p>You can hear a little bit of a difference,</p>
<p>but you should be able to do that.</p>
<p>If you have to like hunch down</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even muster a breath</p>
<p>and it takes that to create pressure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually, you don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>the abdominal control necessary to create that stability.</p>
<p>So step number one is that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>Now with the blood pressure thing, we have to be careful</p>
<p>because a standard blood pressure, ideally,</p>
<p>if we sat around right now,</p>
<p>it was probably something like 120 over 80,</p>
<p>systolic versus diastolic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a normal number, right?</p>
<p>High blood pressure is something over that.</p>
<p>Well, with an acute bout of exercise,</p>
<p>you can see that number reaches high as like 450 over 350,</p>
<p>which effectively means you have total blood occlusion,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Your blood pressure is so high, blood is not moving anywhere.</p>
<p>And so in the middle of a very heavy set,</p>
<p>especially complex movements,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re loaded on your body,</p>
<p>this can be an overhead press or squat variations,</p>
<p>anything like that.</p>
<p>Blood pressure is gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>And the reason why that matters</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna make you pass out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that you ran out of oxygen</p>
<p>in three seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that blood pressure got so high,</p>
<p>you blacked out.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna have to play this game</p>
<p>of releasing a little bit of the pressure</p>
<p>so we can actually get blood to move a little bit,</p>
<p>making sure that we don&rsquo;t lose spinal stability</p>
<p>so we can finish our workout.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the question you asked, right?</p>
<p>How do I play this game of,</p>
<p>oh, I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna exhale, right?</p>
<p>So that I don&rsquo;t lose spinal stability,</p>
<p>but at the same time, I don&rsquo;t wanna pass out, right?</p>
<p>Which is a problem.</p>
<p>So kind of a couple of rules of thumb.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be doing something</p>
<p>in which you can complete the entire exercise</p>
<p>without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably your best strategy.</p>
<p>So in that particular case,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a lot of breathing techniques</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna take a very large inhale.</p>
<p>Ideally, this is done through the abdomen,</p>
<p>not the shoulders.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t see clavicles rising during this thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a common mistake of the bars on their back</p>
<p>and you see people do this like big inhale thing</p>
<p>and all they do is elevate their clavicles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not necessarily going to increase pressure</p>
<p>through the abdomen, which is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>So you wanna be thinking about belly moving out</p>
<p>in all four areas, in front of you,</p>
<p>to your left and right and to your back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine.</p>
<p>You can do that independent of your clavicles moving.</p>
<p>Your shoulders don&rsquo;t need to rise for that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just using the air for a brace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to visualize your torso</p>
<p>as more or less a cylinder.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to fill it with air,</p>
<p>the logic being that if I were to push down</p>
<p>onto a, say, a full unopened can of soda, water,</p>
<p>for all you sugarphobes out there.</p>
<p>Soda water.</p>
<p>And then push as hard as I could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard for me to crush that can.</p>
<p>But if the can were empty</p>
<p>or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle,</p>
<p>then I could likely crush that can.</p>
<p>Yeah, what you&rsquo;re really doing</p>
<p>is you have your spinal erectors in the back, right?</p>
<p>And then a whole series of abdominal exercises.</p>
<p>And you actually have some neural control,</p>
<p>somatic control of contracting those.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have muscles on the inside that you can do.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically bringing in air</p>
<p>and saying I&rsquo;ll use air to push from the inside out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll use muscles to push from the outside in</p>
<p>to create this brace.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want over-compression with the muscles.</p>
<p>This is, if you see people</p>
<p>that have just enormous spinal erectors,</p>
<p>sometimes that&rsquo;s an indicator of actually a poor breathing</p>
<p>or bracing strategy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re using spinal erectors</p>
<p>to create all their compression</p>
<p>and not actually using the inside enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always the case,</p>
<p>but sort of like a thing to think about.</p>
<p>So over-compression through the spinal erectors</p>
<p>is not necessarily ideal.</p>
<p>If you want it,</p>
<p>the best scenario is a little bit of a brace of both.</p>
<p>So we use some air to push this side,</p>
<p>we use some musculature to press that way.</p>
<p>And then that spine is nicely held in position.</p>
<p>Again, not in a position where I&rsquo;ve locked down my diaphragm</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t get any air out.</p>
<p>I should be able to get that brace pattern</p>
<p>and then be able to speak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it right now.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see a little bit of a,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really paying attention to my voice,</p>
<p>you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference,</p>
<p>but I should be able to do this for quite a long time.</p>
<p>I could take a maximum rep right here in this position,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m overhead pressing,</p>
<p>doing some sort of row, like anything,</p>
<p>and feel very braced in the entire quadrant.</p>
<p>This is very helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on it,</p>
<p>but can we say that an effective way to start off</p>
<p>in terms of breathing during repetitions</p>
<p>would be to take a gulp of air</p>
<p>during the lowering phase, the eccentric phase,</p>
<p>and then to exhale during the concentric exertion phase.</p>
<p>I ask that because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing for a while</p>
<p>and it makes me feel safe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I am,</p>
<p>and it allows me to exhale as I exert</p>
<p>the hardest portion of the exercise.</p>
<p>And perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts</p>
<p>where one tends, most often is trained to exhale</p>
<p>on the strike.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be doing, again,</p>
<p>the number of repetitions can be completed without a breath,</p>
<p>a lot of times you&rsquo;re better off</p>
<p>saving that exhalation until you complete.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>But for a reasonably heavy set of hack squats</p>
<p>or even leg extensions,</p>
<p>and given that I already can&rsquo;t leg extension my body weight</p>
<p>as we established.</p>
<p>And maybe this is why.</p>
<p>The idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m clarifying.</p>
<p>To mine, you know, like, where&rsquo;s my insurance card?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to drive me to the hospital?</p>
<p>This kind of thing.</p>
<p>In all seriousness,</p>
<p>what if I want to breathe during the set?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ll clarify.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally meaning if you&rsquo;re doing like a one rep max</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay, well, then certainly I could hold my breath</p>
<p>for a one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>You know, maybe like a double or something like that,</p>
<p>depending on what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>like maybe a triple.</p>
<p>A bench press, you can probably do three</p>
<p>and get away with it.</p>
<p>A squat, it gets harder.</p>
<p>Deadlift, so it kind of depends on the exercise.</p>
<p>You want to take that breath though</p>
<p>prior to the eccentric portion, not during.</p>
<p>So breathe in, lock, we&rsquo;re set.</p>
<p>And now start our movement pattern,</p>
<p>wherever it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>Exhaling on the concentric portion during it is fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re not extremely heavy.</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming?</p>
<p>Yeah, fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m occasionally known to squeal or whimper,</p>
<p>but I do it very quietly.</p>
<p>I think of you and I think squeal, whimper.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be doing multiple repetitions,</p>
<p>what we actually do for the NFL Combine</p>
<p>is we teach them a very specific exhale strategy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one test that they do,</p>
<p>which is they bench press 225 pounds</p>
<p>for as many reps as possible.</p>
<p>A lot of these people will get 25 to 40 repetitions.</p>
<p>So we have a very specific breathing pattern.</p>
<p>It would be something like,</p>
<p>if we think that they&rsquo;re going to do around 25 reps,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s like our goal.</p>
<p>We might say, okay, do the first 10 without a breath.</p>
<p>And then exhale, reset, and then do five breath.</p>
<p>And then you might do five breath, three breath, two breath,</p>
<p>and then one breath per rep until we can&rsquo;t get any more.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have very specific strategies for them.</p>
<p>So what I would say is think about</p>
<p>how many you&rsquo;re going to complete</p>
<p>and then breathe according to that.</p>
<p>And it tends to increase in frequency</p>
<p>as the number gets closer to failure,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to want that air a little bit.</p>
<p>But you just want to make sure that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re breathing back in, you&rsquo;re in a safe spot.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to be catching that like re-breath</p>
<p>when the weight&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>You want to be in a locked out position</p>
<p>or away from you when you&rsquo;re standing.</p>
<p>So it tends to be like at the end of the exercise,</p>
<p>not in the middle of it,</p>
<p>which is going to be a recipe for problems</p>
<p>if you take your breath then.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&rsquo;m so happy to have you here</p>
<p>having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds,</p>
<p>but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot.</p>
<p>How does one contend with the first attempt at a lift</p>
<p>not working out?</p>
<p>Is it too heavy?</p>
<p>Something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Hopefully not injury promoting wrong,</p>
<p>but something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Do you count that?</p>
<p>Do you reset the workout?</p>
<p>And then the counterpart to that question is</p>
<p>what do you do if it&rsquo;s too easy?</p>
<p>It went wrong because you didn&rsquo;t put enough weight</p>
<p>on the bar.</p>
<p>Do you pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells?</p>
<p>Do you abandon the set?</p>
<p>And replace it with another?</p>
<p>And I guess this is really a question of</p>
<p>how much margin for error is there in volume</p>
<p>when doing this three by five program?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Two things that I&rsquo;d like to start with.</p>
<p>Number one is,</p>
<p>I talked about linear periodization</p>
<p>and undulating periodization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a new model, newish model</p>
<p>called auto-regulation,</p>
<p>which basically says you&rsquo;re going to go in today</p>
<p>and depending on any number of biomarkers,</p>
<p>performance markers, or your performance,</p>
<p>you will adjust your training based on</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re feeling that day.</p>
<p>And so 70% is not maybe, for example,</p>
<p>not necessarily 70% of your one repetition max</p>
<p>highest ever,</p>
<p>is 70% of what you can actually do that day.</p>
<p>And so it actually allows you to auto-regulate</p>
<p>your training based on actually what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have to have as much long-term planning</p>
<p>in your program design</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll sort of figure itself out as you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>You can use velocity to determine this auto-regulation.</p>
<p>You can use actually just like taking it up</p>
<p>to close to a max for the day</p>
<p>and then basing all your percentages on that daily max</p>
<p>or a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>So that is actually one very effective strategy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of research coming out</p>
<p>on auto-regulation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to do it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing to say.</p>
<p>Another thing to say is this,</p>
<p>three to five, okay.</p>
<p>It depends on if we&rsquo;re going for speed, power, or strength,</p>
<p>because while all those other variables</p>
<p>are the same for three to five,</p>
<p>the core difference between whether that is a power workout</p>
<p>or a strength workout is the load, right?</p>
<p>So if you are at a moderate load,</p>
<p>say 30% of your one repetition max up to about 70%,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a power-based adaptation,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re going with high intent.</p>
<p>Can you, sorry, I have to interrupt.</p>
<p>Maybe just clarify what intent is.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re attempting to move the implement</p>
<p>or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can.</p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to go for strength and you&rsquo;re below 70%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really going to be improving strength</p>
<p>because the total mass is not heavy enough.</p>
<p>And so really when we say strength,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;re at at least generally 70% or higher.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re new to training,</p>
<p>totally different thing, right?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re moderately trained to highly trained,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be well north of 70%.</p>
<p>So anything below that, we don&rsquo;t really count anyways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, those are warm-ups, that&rsquo;s basically.</p>
<p>So one thing to actually give you</p>
<p>some very specific numbers here,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have all of these memorized.</p>
<p>We can perhaps provide a chart later</p>
<p>or send out something to them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a chart that you can look up</p>
<p>called a prelipin chart.</p>
<p>How do you spell that?</p>
<p>P-R-I-L-I-P-I-N, prelipin.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually been a few studies on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been old, it&rsquo;s been around for a very long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of in the coaching realm.</p>
<p>And then a handful of studies out of New Zealand</p>
<p>came out verifying and validating a lot of it.</p>
<p>But what it effectively does is if strength is the goal,</p>
<p>and this comes from the powerlifting, weightlifting</p>
<p>sort of communities who are optimizing for strength,</p>
<p>then how much time do I need to spend</p>
<p>at each intensity range?</p>
<p>So 70%, 80%, 90%, et cetera.</p>
<p>Because specificity is going to say this.</p>
<p>If you want to get better, neuromuscular guy,</p>
<p>at shooting a basketball,</p>
<p>the most important thing you could ever do</p>
<p>under the exact circumstances</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do it, right?</p>
<p>Specificity always wins.</p>
<p>If you want to get better at strength,</p>
<p>the most important thing you need to do</p>
<p>is that exact movement at that load.</p>
<p>And in this case, if you wanted to get better</p>
<p>at your bench press,</p>
<p>lifting at 100% of your max on a bench press</p>
<p>is the most specific thing you could ever do.</p>
<p>The more you can do that,</p>
<p>the faster you will increase your bench press max.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s very hard to do without getting hurt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not addressing what I call your defender.</p>
<p>So if the reason you can&rsquo;t bench press</p>
<p>higher than whatever you&rsquo;re benching now,</p>
<p>it may not be your pure strength.</p>
<p>That may be any number of things</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have enough muscle or technique</p>
<p>or these things.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So specificity over here.</p>
<p>Variation on the other side.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re playing this game we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>of how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity</p>
<p>in my training without leading to overuse injury?</p>
<p>How do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury</p>
<p>while getting enough specificity?</p>
<p>And so we have a classic paradigm over here.</p>
<p>One actually training protocol you can look up</p>
<p>is called the Bulgarian method.</p>
<p>And the Bulgarians were amazing</p>
<p>at the sport of Olympic weightlifting.</p>
<p>Probably, in fact,</p>
<p>the patriarch of this entire thing recently passed away,</p>
<p>Ivan Ibojev.</p>
<p>Neem Sulemanoglu, pocket Hercules,</p>
<p>one of the greatest weightlifters of all time</p>
<p>came out of the system and they do a lot of things.</p>
<p>But one example in the Bulgarian system</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to do a one repetition maximum snatch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna take a little bit of a break.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do a one repetition maximum clean and jerk.</p>
<p>Take a little bit of a break.</p>
<p>Do a one repetition maximum front squat.</p>
<p>Take a little bit of a break.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna repeat that</p>
<p>two to three times a day every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s specificity, right?</p>
<p>Those people get extraordinarily strong.</p>
<p>Now they don&rsquo;t do that all year round.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do that with all their lifters.</p>
<p>But this is when we&rsquo;re trying to peak</p>
<p>for a major competition like the Olympics,</p>
<p>we are going so far into specificity.</p>
<p>And that was very counter to the Russian system at the time,</p>
<p>which is much more of our classic periodization</p>
<p>sort of approach.</p>
<p>Okay, specificity is tremendous,</p>
<p>but in doing that,</p>
<p>the Bulgarians just brutalize a lot of athletes, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very difficult to handle something like that.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t really do that that long</p>
<p>without getting wrecked.</p>
<p>And there the goal is to win medals.</p>
<p>The goal is, it&rsquo;s a totally different thing</p>
<p>than longevity out of here, right?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re trying to push the boundaries of-</p>
<p>Or aesthetic changes.</p>
<p>Unless someone has a naturally balanced physique.</p>
<p>In general, if people do one sort of movement,</p>
<p>I find that they tend to resemble the equipment</p>
<p>that they did that movement with over time.</p>
<p>That was a joke against kettlebells.</p>
<p>Of course, of course, of course, I got it.</p>
<p>So we know specificity is technically optimal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>
<p>Not for that kind of extreme situation.</p>
<p>So how do we balance these things?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out this prelipin chart</p>
<p>gives you guidelines for how much time,</p>
<p>and by time, I mean how many repetitions</p>
<p>to stand in each of these rep ranges</p>
<p>so that you get kind of the best of this world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find the same thing, by the way,</p>
<p>when we get into endurance training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much training you can do</p>
<p>at 95% of your heart rate</p>
<p>before it starts becoming quite detrimental.</p>
<p>You need to actually spend a lot of time</p>
<p>at those lower intensities.</p>
<p>So the prelipin chart walks you through how many sets,</p>
<p>and it gives you a range.</p>
<p>I think that the bottom of it is like</p>
<p>how much time do you spend at like 60 to 70%</p>
<p>of your one rep max?</p>
<p>And it says like minimum of this set</p>
<p>to maximum of this set,</p>
<p>but the ideal number of reps per set per week is like 18.</p>
<p>And then it walks you through,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s four criteria on it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 55 to 65%.</p>
<p>Again, how many reps there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like three to six reps per set.</p>
<p>18 to 30 reps total,</p>
<p>and I think the ideal rep range is like 24,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>So it takes you 55 to 65,</p>
<p>70 to 80, 80 to 90, and the 90 plus percent.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see is the 90 plus percent number</p>
<p>is more like one to two reps per set</p>
<p>for a total of about seven total repetitions.</p>
<p>If you start cruising past that,</p>
<p>other bad things start to creep up in there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really effective chart.</p>
<p>What it really highlights though</p>
<p>is even somebody who&rsquo;s trying to maximize strength,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to spend something like 35 or so percent</p>
<p>of your training time between this 55 to 65% range.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re asking early, well, do I even count that one?</p>
<p>The answer is yeah, in that range.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s below 55, 60%, you probably don&rsquo;t count it.</p>
<p>Now, again, some coaches don&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s even above 70.</p>
<p>Fine, it&rsquo;s not a major distinction,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to spend the bulk of your time</p>
<p>accumulating some technique, basically,</p>
<p>and skill and tissue tolerance, very important.</p>
<p>The next step up is like 28%, I think,</p>
<p>is sort of the cutoff of how much time you spend</p>
<p>between 70 and 80% of your one-rep max,</p>
<p>and then it jumps down to like 23%,</p>
<p>and then all the way to 70%.</p>
<p>So you can walk yourself through that,</p>
<p>and that gives you an extremely good guideline.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice all of these</p>
<p>are still in three to five range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really, you&rsquo;re manipulating it by total sets</p>
<p>or total exercises.</p>
<p>So that can give you some structure to play with.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to the Prilipin chart</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>Training to failure when the goal is strength.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Should one do it?</p>
<p>Should one avoid it?</p>
<p>Or does it depend?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it always depends.</p>
<p>The way that I&rsquo;ll generally say it is,</p>
<p>because of what we just outlined in the Prilipin chart,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to go to failure to see strength gains,</p>
<p>especially early or even moderate.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking maybe five plus years</p>
<p>in your lifting career.</p>
<p>Would you call beginner zero to five years of training?</p>
<p>Intermediate five to 20 years of training?</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>And then advanced would be people</p>
<p>that really put the time and energy</p>
<p>into fine tuning their program.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people who think they&rsquo;re advanced</p>
<p>are really what we would call intermediate.</p>
<p>In all domains of life.</p>
<p>Fair, even as a scientist.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite rare to reach that number of advance.</p>
<p>So I actually don&rsquo;t have any problem</p>
<p>going to failure quite often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also fine with people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t wanna go all the way there.</p>
<p>You can get most of what you need</p>
<p>by getting what we call technical failure.</p>
<p>So this is like, okay, that was really challenging.</p>
<p>Boy, you started to have some breakdowns of technique.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna call that good.</p>
<p>The only exception here I wanna point out</p>
<p>is people who are either novice or beginners.</p>
<p>They really have no concept of what 100% means.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s actually very fruitful</p>
<p>to take them to 100%,</p>
<p>just to give them a guideline of where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>Now, of course, do this on exercises</p>
<p>that they are comfortable with or close.</p>
<p>And maybe this is on a machine.</p>
<p>Maybe this is single joint movements</p>
<p>or whatever it takes for them to have confidence.</p>
<p>But actually, I don&rsquo;t think you should be scared of these.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really that much more dangerous</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do a front squat or any exercise</p>
<p>and your one rep max is 200 pounds,</p>
<p>is it really that much more dangerous</p>
<p>to do one try at 205 pounds</p>
<p>than it is to do five tries at 190 pounds?</p>
<p>Is it really that much more?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So you can do, like we talked about in the first episode,</p>
<p>you can do a repetition max estimate</p>
<p>where you get to like 85 to 95% of where you think you are.</p>
<p>And then instead of adding load,</p>
<p>you just do as many reps as you can.</p>
<p>Google that number and that&rsquo;ll tell you the conversion</p>
<p>and estimate of what your one rep max is, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But also, I have absolutely no issue.</p>
<p>In fact, I generally encourage it</p>
<p>to take people up to that level.</p>
<p>Certainly not day one or anywhere close to that.</p>
<p>But at some point, let&rsquo;s see what you actually got.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna cut it off early.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m gonna consider to be one rep max,</p>
<p>anything more than a minor technical breakdown</p>
<p>is for that group we&rsquo;re gonna stop and call that good.</p>
<p>And ideally with a spotter, especially bench pressing,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bench press alone in your basement kind of thing.</p>
<p>A few people die each year</p>
<p>from bench pressing alone in their basement.</p>
<p>Or use dumbbells if you&rsquo;re gonna do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to die using dumbbells.</p>
<p>I suppose you could drop them on your head or something,</p>
<p>but not get stuck under them.</p>
<p>Exercise selection and frequency</p>
<p>of exercise implementation across the week.</p>
<p>So I can imagine with this three by five routine</p>
<p>done three to five times per week,</p>
<p>you can imagine changing up the exercises every workout.</p>
<p>Although considering that most of these three by five</p>
<p>routines are going to be done with compound movements.</p>
<p>Generally.</p>
<p>Sooner or later one runs out of movements</p>
<p>if the goal is to hit all the major muscle groups.</p>
<p>However, let me give an example and ask if it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>to, for instance, do the three by five routine</p>
<p>where one of the exercises for back is a bent over row.</p>
<p>You do that on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<p>I can imagine one could do that and still recover</p>
<p>and improve over time.</p>
<p>But five days a week, bent over rows five days a week.</p>
<p>Is that okay?</p>
<p>I mean, can one still progress?</p>
<p>And there I could imagine it&rsquo;s a strong answer of depends</p>
<p>because some people recover more slowly than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very comfortable doing hitting muscle groups</p>
<p>once directly per week and once indirectly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worked for me far better than</p>
<p>two or three times per week.</p>
<p>I get looks of sympathy when I say this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s just how my physiology works.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and maybe I&rsquo;m not optimizing</p>
<p>a number of different features,</p>
<p>but the point being that some people really do seem</p>
<p>to be able to train a muscle every day</p>
<p>and still make progress.</p>
<p>Other people seem to have trouble</p>
<p>when they train a muscle every day.</p>
<p>So how does one establish exercise selection</p>
<p>when the goal is to make progress?</p>
<p>And this brings up something very important</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have a whole episode about this,</p>
<p>but local versus systemic recovery.</p>
<p>You know, is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued</p>
<p>and is the muscle group</p>
<p>and the related musculoskeletal systems becoming fatigued?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go back to thinking about</p>
<p>when you make these comments about</p>
<p>it takes you three to five days</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got better results in there.</p>
<p>The assumption that you&rsquo;re probably running under</p>
<p>is your training style is more reflecting</p>
<p>that recovery time than it is your physiology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re training.</p>
<p>So if you look at, again,</p>
<p>all the Olympic weightlifters that are competing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be squatting</p>
<p>or some variation of squatting every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>A lot of the times they&rsquo;re training multiple times a day</p>
<p>and they will be doing some basically barbell full squat</p>
<p>multiple times a day, every day, six days a week.</p>
<p>You know, something like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the best in the world at getting powerful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tremendously good at getting strong.</p>
<p>You can do it, right?</p>
<p>It comes down to what does your volume look like?</p>
<p>What type of movements are you doing?</p>
<p>What rep range, what overall volume are you hitting?</p>
<p>And how are you doing it?</p>
<p>If you look at athletes, they train their legs every day.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re running around,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing speed and agility training every single day.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need three days to recover.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a basketball player</p>
<p>trying to ask for like three days to recover</p>
<p>between practice?</p>
<p>Right, well, to be fair, as you chuckle at me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing other things on the intervening days.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll train a muscle group like legs</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll give it four days before I do an indirect,</p>
<p>what I call an indirect exercise for legs,</p>
<p>which for me would be sprinting.</p>
<p>Then I get two days and then I&rsquo;m training them again.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, an athlete has to do that every day.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the answer is you absolutely can train</p>
<p>any of these muscles every single day.</p>
<p>It really comes down to volume, right?</p>
<p>And it comes down to movement type</p>
<p>and how are you getting it?</p>
<p>So within the case of weightlifters and athletes,</p>
<p>what we tend to see happen is there&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>There is a long period of conditioning</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean endurance.</p>
<p>What I mean is tissue tolerance and conditioning.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not going to start off their career</p>
<p>at that pace, right?</p>
<p>Their career might start off at five days a week,</p>
<p>but maybe every other of those days is a PVC pipe only.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just training the movement patterns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on technique, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then eventually maybe after six months or a year,</p>
<p>those PVC pipe days turn into barbell only days.</p>
<p>And so now you went from a pound to 45 pounds.</p>
<p>And eventually as your years go on, that ratchets up.</p>
<p>So it depends on the style.</p>
<p>In general, speed and power stuff is so light,</p>
<p>it almost requires, because it&rsquo;s non-fatiguing,</p>
<p>it requires almost no recovery.</p>
<p>So if you were truly doing, say like,</p>
<p>when you say, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because when you say I do legs on Mondays,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even realize it.</p>
<p>But an athlete does legs every day, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying legs,</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re really saying is</p>
<p>I do hypertrophy legs Mondays.</p>
<p>Pretty much that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into what I do specifically,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s less important</p>
<p>than what other people choose to implement.</p>
<p>But the repetition ranges anywhere from four to 12.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m covering a pretty, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re smack dead in the peak soreness,</p>
<p>longest recovery range.</p>
<p>Volume is relatively low, intensity is very, very high.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Workouts are very, very short.</p>
<p>So if you were to switch that,</p>
<p>and you were to stay under four repetitions,</p>
<p>higher quality, higher rest in between them,</p>
<p>I would be willing to bet a large amount of money</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d be fine the next day.</p>
<p>Certainly 48 hours.</p>
<p>And if you were to actually go way lower</p>
<p>and keep, you know, three to five,</p>
<p>and keep it very, very light and train for speed,</p>
<p>you would have absolutely no issue the next day.</p>
<p>So it really comes down to a function of training.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right in that hypertrophy zone,</p>
<p>which is something that you probably need 48 hours</p>
<p>at minimum to recover from.</p>
<p>Because what you won&rsquo;t see are bodybuilders</p>
<p>training the same muscle group on multiple days,</p>
<p>like very often.</p>
<p>At most it will be indirect,</p>
<p>but generally they&rsquo;re not going to do that every single day</p>
<p>for the same reason.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re training in that style,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna take to recover.</p>
<p>If you trained in a different style,</p>
<p>then it wouldn&rsquo;t take that long to recover.</p>
<p>So for the person starting out,</p>
<p>would you recommend they pick three to five exercises</p>
<p>and stick with those so that they can get their skill</p>
<p>and movement and positioning and breathing,</p>
<p>all that really dialed in and then start to experiment</p>
<p>by varying one or two of those exercises over time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you look at the conjugate model,</p>
<p>so these are the strongest power lifters</p>
<p>as a collective group that ever existed.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re very good at</p>
<p>is they keep almost the exact same weekly structure,</p>
<p>but they make a very small change in exercise variation.</p>
<p>So for example, say Wednesday is bench day, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to always bench on Wednesdays,</p>
<p>but maybe this week they&rsquo;re going to do close grip bench.</p>
<p>And then maybe next week it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>maybe a special type of barbell.</p>
<p>And then maybe the week after that it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ll change the range of motion a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually the exact same exercise</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re making a very small variation.</p>
<p>And that change alone allows them to do enough specificity,</p>
<p>but also gives them enough variation</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s not the exact same stimuli</p>
<p>in the exact same spot over and over and over.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what allows that group</p>
<p>plus lots of other assistants.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s what allows that group</p>
<p>to train very, very, very heavy, very consistently,</p>
<p>and not have to worry about too much planning</p>
<p>for periodization and other stuff like that.</p>
<p>They get their back off</p>
<p>by making small variations in exercise.</p>
<p>I will say a major mistake folks do make</p>
<p>is they change their exercises entirely way too often.</p>
<p>If I were to have to pick one or the other,</p>
<p>I would say don&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>on your exercises for six weeks.</p>
<p>Probably realistic, maybe even 10 to 12 weeks,</p>
<p>and then you can make some changes.</p>
<p>You should not be changing every single week.</p>
<p>The general, you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re not gonna see progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be very difficult to do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to take you three weeks, generally,</p>
<p>to figure out the groove of the exercise,</p>
<p>to figure out how well you can load it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s too much to where you woke up unbelievably sore,</p>
<p>that was a train wreck.</p>
<p>How much do I load it at?</p>
<p>How long is this gonna take?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take you three or so weeks,</p>
<p>and then you can really start pushing there.</p>
<p>So changing it before that or in that timeframe</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to progressively overload</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just not gonna know exactly</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at on all the exercises.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to create standardization within them</p>
<p>and then see some progress in a movement or a muscle group,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re going for, and then make some changes.</p>
<p>So before we dive into our discussion about hypertrophy,</p>
<p>can we just get a brief recap of the general parameters</p>
<p>for an excellent power and strength training program?</p>
<p>Okay, let me hit you with these rapid fire</p>
<p>and then you can maybe come ask questions along that.</p>
<p>Remember those modifiable variables, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go through them in order</p>
<p>and then what they mean specifically</p>
<p>for power versus strength.</p>
<p>So modifiable variable number one is called choice.</p>
<p>So which exercises do I select for strength?</p>
<p>In general for power or speed or strength,</p>
<p>we wanna select compound movements.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often see people doing maximum strength work</p>
<p>for like a tricep kickback, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically multiple joint movements</p>
<p>and typically complex movements.</p>
<p>In selecting these compound movements,</p>
<p>we generally wanna actually think about exercise selection</p>
<p>of movements rather than muscle groups.</p>
<p>So this is an important distinction</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll see this as a different answer</p>
<p>when we get to hypertrophy.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is,</p>
<p>when we think about, again, strength training,</p>
<p>we tend to think about bodybuilding concepts.</p>
<p>We go to the gym and we do things like,</p>
<p>I gotta make sure I get my chest today</p>
<p>and I gotta make sure I get my hamstrings.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re selecting exercises</p>
<p>based on a muscle you wanna work.</p>
<p>For strength development and power,</p>
<p>we wanna think about movements</p>
<p>rather than individual muscle groups.</p>
<p>So there should be like things like,</p>
<p>I need to train explosive hip extension,</p>
<p>which is like a vertical jump or something like that.</p>
<p>I wanna train pushing or pulling movements</p>
<p>or I wanna train rotation,</p>
<p>which is a whole area we haven&rsquo;t gotten into,</p>
<p>which is very important for overall health</p>
<p>and wellness longevity.</p>
<p>So we wanna select big movements by the muscle,</p>
<p>the movement patterns that we wanna introduce.</p>
<p>And we just wanna select a reasonable balance</p>
<p>between these.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the exact ratio is.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t wanna go an entire six months</p>
<p>without doing anything in this rotational area</p>
<p>or an entire, you know, eight to 10 weeks</p>
<p>without doing something that&rsquo;s a lower body hinge, right?</p>
<p>So any number of examples there.</p>
<p>So just think about the rough movement patterns,</p>
<p>upper and lower, push and pull,</p>
<p>and then some sort of rotation.</p>
<p>That puts you in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using three by five method</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to pick as little as three exercises,</p>
<p>just pick one from each one of those groups.</p>
<p>Pick a rotation, pick a push and pick a pull.</p>
<p>I can easily think of a push and a pull.</p>
<p>So for example, bench press or shoulder press,</p>
<p>row or chin for pull,</p>
<p>and then squat or deadlift for hinge.</p>
<p>What would be a good example</p>
<p>of a quality rotational movement?</p>
<p>Yep, so anytime you can use a cable machine,</p>
<p>like at the gym, and you can do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to describe this exercise,</p>
<p>but basically you&rsquo;re gonna stand facing the cable</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to pull it towards yourself</p>
<p>and then rotate like you&rsquo;re pivoting,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re either swinging a golf club</p>
<p>or hitting a baseball bat.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re facing one direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m facing you right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pulling the cable towards myself</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna spin, do a 180 degree pivot</p>
<p>and face exactly away from you when I finish</p>
<p>and then return it back in that same spot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a rotation.</p>
<p>Great, we will provide a link to an example of that</p>
<p>that you consider a quality example.</p>
<p>A medicine ball throw, any number of things like this</p>
<p>are a great rotational exercise, all right?</p>
<p>So we select our exercises based on that.</p>
<p>We generally then, because of that as a case,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t worry about things like</p>
<p>eccentric versus concentric</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re generally doing</p>
<p>a whole body athletic movement, right?</p>
<p>Which the eccentric concentric portion</p>
<p>is going to be folded into that</p>
<p>and you really can&rsquo;t separate them out, all right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exercise choice, our first variable.</p>
<p>The next one is exercise order.</p>
<p>So because that everything driving power and strength</p>
<p>is quality based,</p>
<p>you wanna do these at the beginning of your workout.</p>
<p>You would not want to do anything fatiguing before this.</p>
<p>So no cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>no other repetition to failure stuff.</p>
<p>If you do those before and now you&rsquo;re slower,</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;ve done is practice getting slower.</p>
<p>And so these need to be done when you&rsquo;re fresh.</p>
<p>You also need to do them when you&rsquo;re very fresh</p>
<p>because they are the most neurologically demanding.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re complicated.</p>
<p>They tend to have multiple steps</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re often in multiple planes</p>
<p>and coordination is a difficult thing.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to do all that at maximum speed,</p>
<p>your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh.</p>
<p>And so any amount of fatigue here</p>
<p>is only going to compromise results.</p>
<p>To kind of recap that,</p>
<p>one of the major mistakes when training for strength</p>
<p>and especially power</p>
<p>is people worry way too much about fatigue.</p>
<p>Those things should not be part of the equation.</p>
<p>And in fact, if they are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good sign you&rsquo;re not doing this correctly.</p>
<p>These are non-fatiguing movements,</p>
<p>especially speed and power.</p>
<p>So choice, order is next.</p>
<p>The next one after that is volume.</p>
<p>And we sort of hit volume and intensity,</p>
<p>which is the other one.</p>
<p>We talked about that.</p>
<p>The volume is basically identical</p>
<p>between power and strength.</p>
<p>The general number we&rsquo;re gonna look at here</p>
<p>is something like three to 20 sets.</p>
<p>Total per workout.</p>
<p>Per workout.</p>
<p>But that would be like 20 would be</p>
<p>a little bit of a special case.</p>
<p>Three to five is what I told you earlier, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying like sometimes</p>
<p>you can actually go quite higher in these cases.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the general range.</p>
<p>And when somebody finishes the three by five workout</p>
<p>for power or strength,</p>
<p>if they decide they want to throw in</p>
<p>some calf raises and curls and a forearm work</p>
<p>or a little bit of jogging on the treadmill or something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There is very little risk of interference</p>
<p>for things like speed and power.</p>
<p>Strength, you have a little bit of a risk only</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re introducing fatigue,</p>
<p>which if you&rsquo;re really pushing strength,</p>
<p>that might compromise your recovery.</p>
<p>I could imagine doing the three to five routine</p>
<p>for strength or for power.</p>
<p>And then somebody finishing up</p>
<p>with 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm work</p>
<p>and then being very seriously compromised</p>
<p>if they try and come in the next day</p>
<p>or even the next day.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And do those big compound movements for speed and power.</p>
<p>Not just because they&rsquo;re sore,</p>
<p>but the muscles may actually still be damaged.</p>
<p>And I know later we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>the somewhat tenuous relationship</p>
<p>between soreness and recovery.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really nice heuristic to pay attention to</p>
<p>is you can, but just be careful.</p>
<p>Energy starts to matter at that point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really truly trying to maximize strength,</p>
<p>you would do nothing at all outside of that training.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>I kind of want to get stronger and some other things,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to lose strength,</p>
<p>5% of your strength gains,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re totally fine.</p>
<p>The same can be said, by the way, for super setting.</p>
<p>So super setting is an idea that says like,</p>
<p>wait a minute, you&rsquo;re telling me, dude,</p>
<p>I got to take five minutes in between each set.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not so much a problem nowadays</p>
<p>with smartphones,</p>
<p>because people are filling their intercept intervals</p>
<p>with social media and texting.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really have to go that long.</p>
<p>In fact, there was actually a study that came out</p>
<p>in the last month that showed like really two minutes</p>
<p>is probably sufficient for most people.</p>
<p>Having said that,</p>
<p>if you really are trying to push</p>
<p>maximal strength adaptations,</p>
<p>like three to five is very, very reasonable.</p>
<p>Those training sessions are long,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re spending more time not doing anything</p>
<p>than you are doing something.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re trying to maximize quality.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just sort of like part and parcel.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not super worried about it,</p>
<p>you can actually do super setting,</p>
<p>which is, let&rsquo;s imagine again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do some lunges.</p>
<p>And while your legs are resting</p>
<p>during their three to five minutes,</p>
<p>you can go over and do an upper body row or pull.</p>
<p>And when your upper body&rsquo;s resting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going back to legs.</p>
<p>So that really cuts your time in half.</p>
<p>Is it ideal?</p>
<p>No, we actually ran a study maybe 10 years ago in our lab.</p>
<p>And we looked at that specifically.</p>
<p>And we did see a reduction in strength performance</p>
<p>in the super setting group</p>
<p>relative to the group who did not super set.</p>
<p>The question then it becomes like,</p>
<p>is it enough for you to care?</p>
<p>So if I were to say,</p>
<p>hey, I can cut an hour off of your workout time,</p>
<p>but you will lose 5% of your strength gain,</p>
<p>almost everyone would take that exchange.</p>
<p>With the exception of people</p>
<p>who are getting close to competition</p>
<p>or really trying to set a new lifetime PR or something,</p>
<p>then you might say, no, I don&rsquo;t want any interference there.</p>
<p>That last little margin is what I care about.</p>
<p>Give me the extra rest.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a does it work, does it not work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a what are you willing to give up versus get.</p>
<p>The practicalities of super setting</p>
<p>or staggering push, pull, push, pull,</p>
<p>in my mind are real</p>
<p>because you have to take over large segments of the gym,</p>
<p>which oftentimes leads to a situation</p>
<p>where your rest times are too long or highly variable</p>
<p>because people are working in.</p>
<p>Or you can&rsquo;t finish your set</p>
<p>because now someone jumped into the machine,</p>
<p>totally screwed.</p>
<p>You lose three to five of your friends</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s obnoxious</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re taking over all the equipment.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wonderful if you have the space</p>
<p>and the format to do it.</p>
<p>But at least in my experience and observation,</p>
<p>these people know who they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not practical to do on a regular basis</p>
<p>if you train in an open commercial gym.</p>
<p>Yeah, tough to pull off.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered choice, order,</p>
<p>volume and intensity to a sufficient level.</p>
<p>The last one is frequency.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already sort of indirectly talked about that</p>
<p>where frequency can be as high as you&rsquo;d like in this area.</p>
<p>It really depends on your recovery.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really truly pushing maximum strength,</p>
<p>you probably do need a few days to recover,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s dependent upon you.</p>
<p>But speed and power can be done multiple times a day,</p>
<p>almost every day, basically.</p>
<p>The one exception would be maximum sprinting speed.</p>
<p>You need to be careful there</p>
<p>for things like hamstring and injury,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re pretty fast.</p>
<p>So you wanna be a little bit cautious of that.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing easier movements</p>
<p>like medicine ball throws or kettlebell swings or something,</p>
<p>you could do those quite often</p>
<p>as long as the volume is staying pretty low.</p>
<p>Last little piece here is progression.</p>
<p>How do I progress over time?</p>
<p>So I mentioned this earlier,</p>
<p>but just wanted to fill this gap right back in</p>
<p>before we head over to hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which is three to 5% increase per week</p>
<p>of intensity in general.</p>
<p>And you can do upwards of about 5% increase</p>
<p>in volume per week over time.</p>
<p>And I generally recommend running that</p>
<p>for at longest eight weeks,</p>
<p>but probably most realistically,</p>
<p>you wanna go about five weeks or so</p>
<p>and then have some sort of a deload or back off week.</p>
<p>If you do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re generally gonna be a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>So those are like the core concepts.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of fun methods</p>
<p>you can play with within all these categories.</p>
<p>And I would like to actually cover just a couple of them</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;ve got a little more space for that.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;d love to hear about those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to also just cue up one,</p>
<p>which is while I joked about people texting</p>
<p>and doing social media between sets, and I-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>Well, I confess I stopped bringing my phone into the gym</p>
<p>because of the urge to take my mind off of the workout.</p>
<p>And I just started enjoying my workouts a lot more.</p>
<p>And the workouts go far better that way.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just much more efficient.</p>
<p>For me, I realized that some people,</p>
<p>their careers take place in the gym.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t look down upon anyone</p>
<p>using their phone at the gym,</p>
<p>but that really tends to help me.</p>
<p>But I do wonder whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an optimal behavior or mindset in between sets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before that pacing around</p>
<p>can actually help diffuse some of the lactate</p>
<p>and other metabolic byproducts of work and exertion</p>
<p>that can lead to better performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard that shaking the muscles out,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all sorts of gym lore about this,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s also some decent science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious if you have any specific recommendations</p>
<p>that people could play with or try.</p>
<p>Yep, so for speed and power,</p>
<p>you want to walk this balance of stiff but fresh.</p>
<p>And so if you were to literally finish a repetition,</p>
<p>sit on a bench for five minutes,</p>
<p>you would stand up after that fairly stiff</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t feel sort of smooth.</p>
<p>This is all non-science.</p>
<p>This is all practical application, right?</p>
<p>Anic data.</p>
<p>Anic data, there you go.</p>
<p>Strength is a little bit different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same concept.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re walking that line.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of the times,</p>
<p>if you see power lifters and weight lifters</p>
<p>in between sets, they&rsquo;re going to sit down and not move.</p>
<p>For hypertrophy, it can be a little bit different</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting towards fatigue.</p>
<p>And so the factors you mentioned like clearing lactate,</p>
<p>well, first of all, lactate is not actually causing fatigue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a giant myth that will&hellip;</p>
<p>Which is why I teed it up.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But in the case of, again, speed and power,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to fatigue,</p>
<p>so fatigue management is not really an issue.</p>
<p>You want to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting complete neurological recovery,</p>
<p>which is a little bit slower than muscle.</p>
<p>Energetically, you&rsquo;re not out of any gas whatsoever, right?</p>
<p>You are not a lack of fuel,</p>
<p>doing three repetitions of a vertical jump.</p>
<p>No close.</p>
<p>Plenty of glycogen.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>What about stretching between sets?</p>
<p>Yeah, you probably don&rsquo;t want to do that either.</p>
<p>There are very clear examples</p>
<p>of pre-exercise stretching, static stretching,</p>
<p>being quite detrimental for maximum power production.</p>
<p>The same thing for speed and strength.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been shown actually a number of times</p>
<p>in a number of laboratories,</p>
<p>which is like a classic hallmark</p>
<p>any scientist looks for,</p>
<p>really jumping on board with an idea.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s shown not only multiple times,</p>
<p>but in multiple laboratories from multiple scientists,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all seeing the same thing,</p>
<p>you start to get a lot of confidence</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a real finding.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that in our Center for Sport Performance.</p>
<p>Not myself, but one of my colleagues</p>
<p>has done a lot of stretching research,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s seen that a lot.</p>
<p>On everything from vertical jump</p>
<p>to isokinetic dynamometers and force velocity curves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this in sprinting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this in speed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this in loaded stuff.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to spend a ton of time stretching,</p>
<p>statically stretching a muscle prior to.</p>
<p>If you do that, and you have to do that,</p>
<p>say for example, you finished that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like feeling really tight.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Like you need to get in the right position,</p>
<p>especially for most people where,</p>
<p>are you willing to sacrifice 10% of power</p>
<p>to make sure you don&rsquo;t get hurt?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That answer is almost always yes,</p>
<p>outside of some very specific athlete scenarios.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not in the right position,</p>
<p>I actually remember having this conversation with Kelly.</p>
<p>Kelly started a long time ago.</p>
<p>It was just like, yeah, fine, I&rsquo;ll lose 5%.</p>
<p>That means I&rsquo;m not gonna get in a bad position</p>
<p>and hurt my back.</p>
<p>And I totally, totally agree.</p>
<p>So if you got to open up a hip or an ankle or something</p>
<p>to get there, get in the right position, number one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll live with the 5% reduction in power.</p>
<p>And if you do, just reactivate.</p>
<p>So before you go do your working set,</p>
<p>go do something fast again, a vertical jump,</p>
<p>a short sprint, an acceleration,</p>
<p>and sort of get that system cleared back up.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t stretch it for long enough,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t hold it for long enough,</p>
<p>you should be able to be just fine.</p>
<p>So when it comes to hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you can really stretch all you want.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not driven by intensity or outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being driven by an insult into the tissue.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re pre-fatigued for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re pre-stretched, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going for quality of outcome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going for quality of internal signal,</p>
<p>which is not gonna be changed by your force output.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>You mentioned a few other things that one might consider</p>
<p>in light of the list that you provided of choice,</p>
<p>order, volume, frequency, and progression.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So starting off with power,</p>
<p>just wanted to hand the listeners here</p>
<p>with a whole bunch of different methods to go play with.</p>
<p>So as long as you hit those concepts,</p>
<p>the repetition range for power,</p>
<p>30 to 70% of your one repetition max,</p>
<p>depending on the exercise and your training status,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get the power.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re attempting to go fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be great.</p>
<p>A lot of things you can try.</p>
<p>Plyometrics are a great example</p>
<p>of things that are effective for power development.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned medicine ball throws, short sprints.</p>
<p>You can even do sprints on like an air bike,</p>
<p>which is a great, super safe activity.</p>
<p>You can do them from like a rolling start</p>
<p>where you kind of like get going a little bit</p>
<p>and then you explode for five seconds</p>
<p>and see how fast you can get, or a dead start.</p>
<p>Like both of those are very, very acceptable.</p>
<p>Weightlifting movements,</p>
<p>so snatches and clean and jerks are tremendously effective.</p>
<p>In fact, they are pound for pound,</p>
<p>by far the most effective exercise choice</p>
<p>for power development, like without question.</p>
<p>So those are good ones.</p>
<p>Clapping pushups, speed squats.</p>
<p>These are a whole host of different things</p>
<p>that you can do for speed and power development.</p>
<p>Depending on your, kettlebell swings, another great one.</p>
<p>All these can be done depending on your preference,</p>
<p>exercise availability, what&rsquo;s at your gym or not gym,</p>
<p>any of those things.</p>
<p>If somebody is more focused on strength as opposed to power,</p>
<p>what are the additional variables they should consider?</p>
<p>Again, within the context of this overarching theme</p>
<p>of choice, order, volume, frequency, and progression.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost identical with a couple of small exceptions.</p>
<p>Number one, you probably can&rsquo;t do as many working sets</p>
<p>per week for strength</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re introducing a heavier load</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna represent some sort of fatigue.</p>
<p>Load on the tissue, all those things.</p>
<p>So you could probably get away with doing 20 sets of two</p>
<p>of a vertical jump four or five times a week.</p>
<p>You probably couldn&rsquo;t do that at a 90% on squat, right?</p>
<p>So the total amount of sets</p>
<p>and the total amount of weekly load you can get to</p>
<p>just needs to be lower.</p>
<p>And then the intensity, right?</p>
<p>So we talked about that needs to be generally higher</p>
<p>than 70% with some portion of that being working sets</p>
<p>and some portion of that really truly being at 90% plus.</p>
<p>Everything else is pretty identical.</p>
<p>You still wanna emphasize maximum speed</p>
<p>despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve introduced load.</p>
<p>You still need to be attempting that</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna be picking complex exercises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re generally going to be hedging more</p>
<p>towards barbells and machines.</p>
<p>So this is a case where body weight training</p>
<p>can be effective again, particularly for the upper body</p>
<p>but at some point you&rsquo;re really gonna have to move past that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a certain amount of load</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put on the lower body with just your body weight.</p>
<p>You get limited by how much you weigh</p>
<p>or I mean, there&rsquo;s a couple of things you can do</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna run out past that pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And so when it comes to strength</p>
<p>they tend to be less athletic movements</p>
<p>because we have to have a barbell on us.</p>
<p>We have to be on a machine or something like that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a subtle difference in exercise choice.</p>
<p>We need to also be careful about the eccentric portion</p>
<p>and things like that where we don&rsquo;t have as much risk</p>
<p>in like a speed or power one.</p>
<p>So some of the different things you can play with there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about doing things like pushes and pulls.</p>
<p>I also love carries.</p>
<p>So a farmer&rsquo;s carry, pushing a sled, dragging a sled</p>
<p>all kinds of things, a yoke walk,</p>
<p>all kinds of carry modalities</p>
<p>that are very, very effective for strength.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s eccentric overload training</p>
<p>which we really haven&rsquo;t gotten into</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really advanced technique</p>
<p>where you can actually load at greater than 100%</p>
<p>of your one repetition max</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re only going to do the eccentric portion of it.</p>
<p>So physiologically you are much stronger</p>
<p>eccentrically than you are concentrically</p>
<p>for a variety of muscle tissue reasons actually.</p>
<p>And so imagine if you can do a bench press at 200 pounds</p>
<p>and what you might actually do is load it to 220</p>
<p>and you would have a spotter and maybe even use it in a rack</p>
<p>and you would lower it down under control</p>
<p>all the way to the bottom and then stop.</p>
<p>Your friends would lift it back up at the top</p>
<p>and then you just practice that eccentric portion.</p>
<p>You would actually be able to lower</p>
<p>say 220 pounds effectively,</p>
<p>despite the fact that you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able</p>
<p>to lift it back up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to start there</p>
<p>but that is a very effective method for increase.</p>
<p>In fact, one of my doctoral students right now</p>
<p>is doing a project on this at USC</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s focusing directly on this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite clear that&rsquo;s oftentimes more effective</p>
<p>at strength development than anything else</p>
<p>because you can actually, just like in the speed example</p>
<p>where you want to actually practice moving faster.</p>
<p>So instead of practicing at 100%</p>
<p>of your one hour max for strength,</p>
<p>you actually practice at higher than that</p>
<p>to get better at it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another much more advanced tool.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t let me get sued by saying all that.</p>
<p>Like folks, be careful,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re doing the proper exercise</p>
<p>and your positioning and like caveat, caveat, caveat, okay?</p>
<p>But outside of that, it can be, it&rsquo;s totally fine and safe.</p>
<p>Yeah, when people get injured, they can&rsquo;t train,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t train, you don&rsquo;t progress, you lose progress.</p>
<p>So certainly that&rsquo;s worth highlighting.</p>
<p>So two more, a little more advanced techniques</p>
<p>that I want to throw out there.</p>
<p>And one of them is called cluster sets.</p>
<p>So cluster sets are, there&rsquo;s a bunch of ways to do it,</p>
<p>but imagine taking a mini break</p>
<p>in between every single repetition.</p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re going to do five repetitions in a row.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re actually going to do is do one repetition,</p>
<p>set it down, pause for five to 10 seconds</p>
<p>and then do the next one.</p>
<p>Pause, do the next one, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause.</p>
<p>So you can imagine doing like a squat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna go down, explode up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stand there, you&rsquo;re gonna rack it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kind of like shake back out, catch your breath,</p>
<p>walk back in, do another one, rack it out.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna repeat that until you&rsquo;ve executed</p>
<p>your three or four or five repetitions.</p>
<p>And then you take your three to five minute break</p>
<p>before your next set.</p>
<p>That is an incredibly effective way for both strength,</p>
<p>power, and actually even hypertrophy</p>
<p>because you can keep the quality, the force output,</p>
<p>the power output very, very, very high</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting these little mini breaks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting fatigue setting in</p>
<p>by the time you hit your say third or fourth</p>
<p>or fifth repetition in that set.</p>
<p>After repetition one, you start to see very small,</p>
<p>subtle reductions in power output</p>
<p>because you start to see a little bit of fatigue.</p>
<p>You take those five to 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>even up to 20 seconds, you can actually do it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see any drop and force output</p>
<p>over the course of the five.</p>
<p>And so what you really have done is you&rsquo;ve gotten five</p>
<p>in this example, first repetitions,</p>
<p>which is the way that we would kind of say it, right?</p>
<p>So all five of those had the same quality as rep number one,</p>
<p>which is, again, as we&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the driver in strength.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the one we wanna preserve.</p>
<p>So it takes a little bit longer.</p>
<p>For some exercises, it&rsquo;s not very good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for like a deadlift</p>
<p>because you set it back down, shake it back out, re-grip.</p>
<p>Hard to do with a bench.</p>
<p>You gotta re-rack it back in and re-rack it back out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like kind of a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some exercises it doesn&rsquo;t work well with</p>
<p>and some that it does, but cluster sets</p>
<p>and a lot of research on those, very effective.</p>
<p>Would you recommend if somebody is doing cluster sets</p>
<p>that they do them for every session within that week</p>
<p>or just this as an occasional thing?</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>This could be your training strategy.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So you can really take it that serious.</p>
<p>In fact, like if you look at, again, the weightlifters,</p>
<p>they will do cluster sets by default, not even trying.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;ll do like a clean</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll drop the weight back out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be doing say a set of three,</p>
<p>but almost always they&rsquo;re gonna like shake it out,</p>
<p>re-grip and then pull it again.</p>
<p>And sometimes their set of three takes like a minute.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, you hear it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, I set a triple PR.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, no, you did three singles.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the difference between doing three singles</p>
<p>and a set of three when you took a minute</p>
<p>between each rep?</p>
<p>I love that community.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, it could be your strategy.</p>
<p>Like it could be like, hey, for this five week block,</p>
<p>this is all my training,</p>
<p>especially for your compound movements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna go to start doing</p>
<p>some of the smaller movements, maybe you give up on that.</p>
<p>It could also just be something you do</p>
<p>for your one primary exercise for the day.</p>
<p>So do that thing that is the most important first</p>
<p>and just do it for that one.</p>
<p>And then the rest of them, you can kind of ditch it</p>
<p>if you need to save a little bit of that time.</p>
<p>It can also be something you do by feel.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re two reps in and you go,</p>
<p>guy, like I&rsquo;m not feeling like poppy here,</p>
<p>like re-rack it, catch my breath for a quick second</p>
<p>and do it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be ultra planned.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m giving you an excuse</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re super fresh for every rep.</p>
<p>It matters.</p>
<p>The last one I wanna talk about here</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called dynamic variable resistance.</p>
<p>So dynamic variable resistance is fixing the problem</p>
<p>we have with what&rsquo;s called the human strength curve.</p>
<p>So theory of constraints again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only as strong as you are</p>
<p>in your weakest point of the movement.</p>
<p>So depending on the movement you do,</p>
<p>this happens at a different range of motion.</p>
<p>Well, the deadlift is easiest example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also because we&rsquo;ve done like research in my lab</p>
<p>using this stuff on the deadlift.</p>
<p>So I can speak to it very directly.</p>
<p>When you go to pull it off the ground,</p>
<p>some people are gonna fail right at the bottom,</p>
<p>meaning they won&rsquo;t get the weight off the ground at all.</p>
<p>Some people will fail just below the knees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like kind of like the hardest transition period.</p>
<p>And then some people will feel right at the top</p>
<p>just before they can lock out.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So what that means is at some point of that lift,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to only be limited</p>
<p>by your strength in the weakest area.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>So if you have a constant load on the bar</p>
<p>in those other two parts of the range of motion,</p>
<p>where you are not the weakest,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never truly being tested for their maximum strength</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always being limited by the previous one.</p>
<p>And this is the same argument that we would get into</p>
<p>if people ask about what do we think about using straps?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Strapping your hand to a bar for deadlift,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pros and cons here.</p>
<p>There are times when you want to use a strap</p>
<p>and there are times when it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>So what dynamic variable resistance is,</p>
<p>is either using things like a heavy band</p>
<p>or chains on the bar, if you&rsquo;ve ever seen people do that.</p>
<p>So in my lab, we actually have a force plate on the ground</p>
<p>and then we have built in basically hooks</p>
<p>in the front and the back</p>
<p>so we can actually set a barbell on top of the force plate</p>
<p>where you stand on it</p>
<p>and then run bands from the back to the front</p>
<p>running over top of the weights.</p>
<p>And so when you stand up, as you&rsquo;re going up vertically,</p>
<p>the bands are getting tighter and tighter</p>
<p>and pulling the weight towards the ground.</p>
<p>So the weight is getting heavier and heavier</p>
<p>as you stand up.</p>
<p>So as you start to gain mechanical advantage</p>
<p>in your positioning, you start to increase load</p>
<p>because the bands are getting tighter and tighter and tighter.</p>
<p>So this allows you to train</p>
<p>that full part of the strength curve</p>
<p>and to challenge your stronger areas with heavier weight</p>
<p>and your weaker areas with lower weight.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing with a bench press.</p>
<p>You can do it with a squat and any other exercise variation</p>
<p>and dynamic variable resistance is incredibly effective</p>
<p>for a number of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to give up a little bit</p>
<p>because the total load you can put on the barbell is lower</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna be adding,</p>
<p>in large cases, several hundred pounds of band tension.</p>
<p>And so pros and cons, it&rsquo;s always a game.</p>
<p>It changes the curve, but it&rsquo;s a very good technique</p>
<p>that people, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to implement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>In fact, if you try this on a bench or a squat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be like the first time you give it a go,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh my God,</p>
<p>because the bands are pulling you all over the place.</p>
<p>So you have to get very stable, very quick.</p>
<p>Been shown a number of times,</p>
<p>a handful of studies out of many laboratories</p>
<p>to be a very effective training technique.</p>
<p>A little bit more advanced,</p>
<p>but I wanted to throw that in there for the folks</p>
<p>that are maybe just tired of sort of doing the same barbells</p>
<p>and dumbbells and machines,</p>
<p>and you want to try something different,</p>
<p>a very effective technique.</p>
<p>Sounds like fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>With your permission, I&rsquo;m going to read back</p>
<p>my summary list of training for power</p>
<p>and training for strength according to your description.</p>
<p>And you can tell me where I&rsquo;m right and where I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick three to five exercises</p>
<p>and these should be compound exercises.</p>
<p>So multi-joint movements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to perform those exercises</p>
<p>for three to five repetitions each.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do three to five movements total per workout.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to rest three to five minutes between sets.</p>
<p>Okay, if I&rsquo;m training for power,</p>
<p>the weight loads on the work set,</p>
<p>so not the warmup sets,</p>
<p>but the work sets are going to fall somewhere in the range</p>
<p>of 30 to 70% of my one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>Yep, and the larger the movement,</p>
<p>the higher that number goes.</p>
<p>So on a squat, you&rsquo;re okay getting 50 or 60%.</p>
<p>On a bench, you would not want to go that high.</p>
<p>You would want to stay close to that 30 to 40% range.</p>
<p>So the way you scale that up and down</p>
<p>is dependent upon the difficulty of the movement.</p>
<p>Great, if training for strength,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have my work sets be 70% or more</p>
<p>of my one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>Yep, and the only thing to add there is</p>
<p>in the case of actually all of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to go less than three reps per set.</p>
<p>So a single or a double, one or two reps is also fantastic.</p>
<p>So we use three to five as the concept,</p>
<p>but less is okay.</p>
<p>Going more than that is generally not a good idea.</p>
<p>So less is okay, more is generally not.</p>
<p>Okay, and then you listed off a number of really valuable,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to call them fine points,</p>
<p>but important points to keep in mind</p>
<p>within each and both of these programs.</p>
<p>One that really stands out in my mind is this idea</p>
<p>of if I perform this three by five program,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also including some hypertrophy work</p>
<p>for arms or calves or muscle groups</p>
<p>that might not be hit as directly</p>
<p>as one might like during the three by five component,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay, but do that after the three by five training.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that that additional work</p>
<p>can potentially compromise recovery</p>
<p>for the three by five power promoting</p>
<p>or strength promoting program.</p>
<p>The example being, for instance,</p>
<p>if one does arm work on the first workout of the week,</p>
<p>or even the third workout of the week</p>
<p>or the fifth workout of the week,</p>
<p>and that arm work is higher repetition,</p>
<p>hypertrophy directed work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that it might impede</p>
<p>some of the three by five power promoting</p>
<p>or strength promoting training in the subsequent workout.</p>
<p>So just to be mindful of that</p>
<p>and perhaps throttle back on the intensity or the volume,</p>
<p>or if my goal is strictly power or strictly strength,</p>
<p>probably best to leave out other forms of training.</p>
<p>Yep, love it.</p>
<p>One last little thing I don&rsquo;t think we did justice</p>
<p>is intention.</p>
<p>And the reason I wanna go back to this now</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about specific loads</p>
<p>you have to hit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s generally the case.</p>
<p>But if intention is there, you can fudge those numbers</p>
<p>in terms of how much load goes on the bar.</p>
<p>In fact, you can get as low as no load on the bar.</p>
<p>A great example here is like a plank exercise.</p>
<p>So you can do a plank in which you get in a position</p>
<p>and you simply contract the least amount necessary</p>
<p>to hold the position.</p>
<p>Also, you could contract as hard as possible,</p>
<p>pulling your scapula down and back, squeezing your core,</p>
<p>squeezing your quads, squeezing your glutes.</p>
<p>That is actually going to still help strength production</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re attempting to contract very, very hard,</p>
<p>even though, quote unquote, the load is the same.</p>
<p>That thing extends to weight on the bar.</p>
<p>So you could theoretically see large improvements</p>
<p>in strength at 50% of your 100 max</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re contracting as hard as possible.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s lots and lots of different ways</p>
<p>you can train for strength that are outside</p>
<p>of this weight lifting, weight training spectrum.</p>
<p>And if you hear things like this and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow, I read this book or I saw this other coach</p>
<p>who I got so much stronger that way.</p>
<p>Well, if intention is there, those are absolutely possible.</p>
<p>This could be anything from body weight style of training.</p>
<p>It could be very low load implement stuff.</p>
<p>So a kettlebell, a light kettlebell, or a ball.</p>
<p>It could be single leg training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all kinds of different methods.</p>
<p>They will only work for strength though</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re past your first handful of months of training</p>
<p>if intention is there.</p>
<p>And if it is, then these specific numbers and protocols</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t matter as much.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get too caught up in them</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not worrying about exercise quality.</p>
<p>And this is very, very important</p>
<p>because you mentioned earlier about how you stop</p>
<p>taking your phone into the gym with you.</p>
<p>One of our former students, Ramzi Nijm,</p>
<p>is the head strength conditioning coach</p>
<p>at the University of Kansas.</p>
<p>And he made a great post a couple of days ago</p>
<p>where he gave sort of a tip of</p>
<p>how do I improve training quality?</p>
<p>And one of his tips is set your playlist</p>
<p>before you go to the gym.</p>
<p>And the reason is people spend so much time</p>
<p>in between sets just finding the next song that they like.</p>
<p>It makes their workout so long and so unproductive.</p>
<p>So that is one strategy or do what you do</p>
<p>which is ditch the music entirely.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have music or a phone to look at,</p>
<p>you only have one job.</p>
<p>You only have one thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find is the quality of the training</p>
<p>will go up exponentially.</p>
<p>You will feel kind of quote unquote bored,</p>
<p>but that just means you&rsquo;ll go back to training</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a lot more done</p>
<p>because you have one thing to focus on.</p>
<p>So you can get a lot more done</p>
<p>when you avoid those distractions.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing strength and especially power work,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s not fatiguing, strength will be a little bit,</p>
<p>but power won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>People tend to get very bored.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to either feeling a pump or a burn or a sweat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s their like perception of my quality of workout.</p>
<p>These exercises will not hit that for you.</p>
<p>So there has to be another metric you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m going to try to move</p>
<p>as well as I can, as hard as I can.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to produce your results.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>you might as well just not do these workouts.</p>
<p>Go do something else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to be wasting time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be burning a very low amount of calories.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have wasted an hour</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to go right back to the place you were.</p>
<p>So be very intentional.</p>
<p>There are actually some studies showing</p>
<p>that music can enhance performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some of these in our lab.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the music per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the focus and intent</p>
<p>and do whatever it takes to be very focused and intent.</p>
<p>And you can actually get in and out very quickly</p>
<p>and get a lot of work done and see a lot of results.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about hypertrophy.</p>
<p>The topic that occupies the minds of so many youth,</p>
<p>young men, but also a lot of women.</p>
<p>I think one of the really interesting progressions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s taken place in the last decade or so</p>
<p>is that far more men and women are using resistance training</p>
<p>in order to evoke hypertrophy,</p>
<p>growth of muscles for aesthetic reasons</p>
<p>and for all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p>What are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy?</p>
<p>So not to correct you or insult you,</p>
<p>but probably a better way to think about that question</p>
<p>is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle</p>
<p>to induce hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Now there are hormonal factors that are important.</p>
<p>There are nutritional factors,</p>
<p>but just to stick with the context of training.</p>
<p>This is really going to frame a lot of our answers.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll see, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why I call hypertrophy training kind of idiot proof</p>
<p>in terms of programming.</p>
<p>Now the work is hard, difficult and all that,</p>
<p>but the precision needed is a lot less</p>
<p>than what we saw in power and strength.</p>
<p>And so if you note there,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very important that you do it in this style</p>
<p>with this intent and within these parameters.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re outside of the parameters,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be it.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy has a very broad range</p>
<p>in terms of your actual applications.</p>
<p>And this is why you have,</p>
<p>and will continue to see countless styles of training</p>
<p>that all work.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you were mentored earlier in life</p>
<p>by one of my favorite people in this entire field,</p>
<p>Mike Mentzer, like just an absolute character.</p>
<p>His style was completely different</p>
<p>than what you would see in a classic textbook</p>
<p>or any number of different influencers</p>
<p>or coaches or individuals.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever thought to yourself like,</p>
<p>why is it all these programs?</p>
<p>And people love to jump to things like,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s the steroids.</p>
<p>Like, just get that out of the equation for now.</p>
<p>Independent of that,</p>
<p>or if that&rsquo;s not even part of the equation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still going to see results.</p>
<p>And the question is like, why?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because what&rsquo;s driving changes</p>
<p>in strength and power</p>
<p>are the adaptations of specificity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s driving changes in hypertrophy</p>
<p>is much more well-rounded.</p>
<p>And so you have options to get there.</p>
<p>Remember, you&rsquo;re training a movement</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re training a response</p>
<p>and a muscle that caused the growth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, very different.</p>
<p>So if we look at like the classic dogma,</p>
<p>we have to basically challenge the muscle</p>
<p>to need to come back, in this case, specifically bigger,</p>
<p>and the nutrients need to be there to support that growth.</p>
<p>Okay, the nutrients aside,</p>
<p>perhaps we can come in a few more minutes</p>
<p>and talk about that.</p>
<p>So all we really have to do is going back</p>
<p>to our dogma of activation of something on the cell wall.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this earlier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to induce that signaling cascade.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be strong enough to cause the nucleus</p>
<p>to react to it, to go to the ribosomes,</p>
<p>to initiate this entire cascade of protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Okay, so that signal has to be one of a couple of things.</p>
<p>Either it has to be strong enough one time,</p>
<p>it has to be frequent enough,</p>
<p>or it has to be a combination of these things.</p>
<p>All right, so I can get there with a lot of frequency</p>
<p>and a moderate signal.</p>
<p>I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal,</p>
<p>like more akin to what you did with Mike back in the day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And still train that way.</p>
<p>Still train that way.</p>
<p>Each muscle group mainly once a week directly</p>
<p>and once a week indirectly.</p>
<p>So all you have to do there to not fail</p>
<p>is to make sure the training is hard enough</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>If you choose the frequency path,</p>
<p>then you actually have to make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not training too hard</p>
<p>to where you can actually maintain the frequency.</p>
<p>The only wrong combination here is infrequent</p>
<p>and low intensity and low volume.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>As long as one of those three variables is high,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get there.</p>
<p>Because the mechanisms that are needed</p>
<p>to activate that signaling cascade are wide ranging.</p>
<p>And this is why when we even see things</p>
<p>like blood flow restriction training, right?</p>
<p>This is when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg</p>
<p>and you block blood flow and you use no load</p>
<p>or as low as say 30% of your maximum</p>
<p>and you take it to fatigue failure.</p>
<p>That actually is an equally effective way</p>
<p>of inducing hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that you&rsquo;re using three, five, 10,</p>
<p>maybe most 20 to 30% of your 100 max.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you went through the route</p>
<p>of metabolic disturbance.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Other ways, say a higher load,</p>
<p>maybe as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions</p>
<p>is gonna get through through</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called mechanical tension.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s these different paths</p>
<p>that we can get to the same spot.</p>
<p>Now, eventually these things have a saturation point.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need all three of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>The third one, of course,</p>
<p>is having muscle damage or breakdown.</p>
<p>And I know we wanna chat a little bit about that,</p>
<p>but none of these three are absolutely required.</p>
<p>You can have multiple of them in a session.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have breakdown at all.</p>
<p>That is a complete,</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s a flat out lie</p>
<p>that you have to break a muscle down to cause it to grow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not needed at all.</p>
<p>You have to have one of these three things though.</p>
<p>And so again, this allows you a lot of flexibility,</p>
<p>which is why crafting your program, which is best for you,</p>
<p>is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You just have to make sure you do the work.</p>
<p>And you wanna make sure you have a few standards in place</p>
<p>with the exercise choice and some other things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll hit in just a second.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really the fundamental way of getting to it.</p>
<p>Making sure either that signal is loud enough</p>
<p>or frequent enough to give the nuclei</p>
<p>a convincing enough reason to spend the resources.</p>
<p>Because you have to remember two things.</p>
<p>In order to grow new skeletal muscle,</p>
<p>you need amino acids, which are your supply.</p>
<p>And then you need primarily carbohydrates</p>
<p>as the energy source to power that synthesis process.</p>
<p>You remember basic chemistry.</p>
<p>It says, if you&rsquo;re gonna take two atoms</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna pull them apart or put them together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to take energy.</p>
<p>Typically, and most of actually metabolism,</p>
<p>when you split a bond, you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called exergonic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get energy from that.</p>
<p>But when you put them together, that&rsquo;s going to take energy.</p>
<p>This is why we call that protein synthesis.</p>
<p>So you have to convince your nucleus</p>
<p>that one, invest those resources in energy,</p>
<p>primarily carbohydrate.</p>
<p>But number two, and more importantly, invest that supply.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of possible ways to get energy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very low amount of amino acids available.</p>
<p>And you need them for many more things</p>
<p>than just taking your biceps</p>
<p>from 17 inches to 18 inches, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to do that if you&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>to where again, you can&rsquo;t sustain immune function.</p>
<p>If red blood cell turnover needs to be higher</p>
<p>or any of the other main, like tons of things</p>
<p>that you need proteins for.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to say like, are you sure?</p>
<p>You really want to spend these resources</p>
<p>and build it into muscle.</p>
<p>Because once we do that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to go backwards,</p>
<p>break them back down and bring the amino acids</p>
<p>back into that availability pool.</p>
<p>So we can use them for either another function entirely</p>
<p>or even another muscle group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called protein redistribution.</p>
<p>By the way, when you say,</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t do a lot of upper body work</p>
<p>in your training and you&rsquo;re not eating enough protein</p>
<p>or a minimal amount,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing a lot of lifting in your legs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice your legs will get larger,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually a lot of times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pulling the protein from,</p>
<p>say your upper body in this case</p>
<p>and redistributing it back down to the quad.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you have to get to.</p>
<p>And in terms of application, what numbers to hit,</p>
<p>we can go through each one of our modifiable variables,</p>
<p>just like we did with speed and strength and power</p>
<p>and walk through some of our best practices</p>
<p>in each category.</p>
<p>Yes, so I&rsquo;d love to talk about those modifiable variables</p>
<p>as they relate to choice of movements,</p>
<p>order of movements, volume, so sets and repetitions</p>
<p>and frequency of training.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m particularly interested in frequency of training</p>
<p>because that relates to the so-called split</p>
<p>where typically one is not training</p>
<p>their whole body every workout,</p>
<p>although there are, I&rsquo;m sure hypertrophy workouts</p>
<p>that are whole body workouts,</p>
<p>but where people are dividing their body parts</p>
<p>onto different days.</p>
<p>So would love to go through this list one by one,</p>
<p>starting with exercise choice.</p>
<p>Cool, great.</p>
<p>So in the previous section,</p>
<p>we pretty much said exclusively choose your exercises</p>
<p>by the movement patterns,</p>
<p>and you wanna balance between pushing and pulling</p>
<p>and rotation and things like that.</p>
<p>In this particular case, you have the option to do either.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my recommendation.</p>
<p>Most people default almost exclusively</p>
<p>to choosing by body parts here, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do calves and shoulders today</p>
<p>and chest and back,</p>
<p>whatever combinations of things they want.</p>
<p>That is clearly effective strategy.</p>
<p>However, many studies have actually been done</p>
<p>where you choose by movement patterns,</p>
<p>and that is actually equally effective.</p>
<p>Now, one little caveat I actually should have said</p>
<p>a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>When we talk about the research on muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it is important to distinguish the fact</p>
<p>that the vast majority of this research</p>
<p>is coming from a novice to moderately trained individuals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually more and more research</p>
<p>coming out on trained individuals,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still moderately trained, right?</p>
<p>Even in those ones.</p>
<p>So what happens in those people</p>
<p>that are actually way past that point,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know scientifically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to do research there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an important caveat I will acknowledge.</p>
<p>When I say, hey, you don&rsquo;t need to do this</p>
<p>or you have to do this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re assuming a training status of moderate to low.</p>
<p>May or may not be true.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know scientifically.</p>
<p>I have certain thoughts personally,</p>
<p>but the science will only take us that far.</p>
<p>So that being said, you can actually choose by muscle</p>
<p>or by movement pattern here,</p>
<p>whichever is your personal preference.</p>
<p>And this is actually where you can just become a good coach,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re coaching somebody else</p>
<p>through this fitness journey or it&rsquo;s yourself,</p>
<p>and give them a little bit of autonomy.</p>
<p>So maybe you select the first three exercises</p>
<p>and then let them select one every day.</p>
<p>And so if they especially wanna make sure</p>
<p>that one muscle group grows,</p>
<p>let them target that muscle.</p>
<p>And maybe the rest of the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually split it up as push pull</p>
<p>or something else like that.</p>
<p>All those strategies are effective.</p>
<p>Personal preference, as long as the total amount of volume</p>
<p>on the working muscle is equated throughout the week,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get to those numbers in a second,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna be in the exact same spot, no problem.</p>
<p>I would actually generally encourage people</p>
<p>to choose exercises in a variety of fashions.</p>
<p>I actually think that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that you do some number of combination</p>
<p>of what we call bilateral and unilateral exercises.</p>
<p>So bilateral being, think about it like a squat,</p>
<p>where by meaning two, lateral,</p>
<p>you have two feet on the ground moving in sequence here.</p>
<p>Unilateral is one.</p>
<p>So this could be something as simple</p>
<p>as a rear foot elevated split squat.</p>
<p>It could be a single leg leg press or single leg curl.</p>
<p>It could be a pistol squat,</p>
<p>something where the individual limb is moving one at a time.</p>
<p>You need to have a combination</p>
<p>of bilateral and unilateral training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to do for strength as well.</p>
<p>Probably not super important for power,</p>
<p>but also very important for making sure,</p>
<p>for hypertrophy&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting any imbalances as you progress,</p>
<p>especially through months and years of training.</p>
<p>So make sure you&rsquo;re doing a little bit of a combination.</p>
<p>Whether you wanna pick specific implements,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really a methods question and a preference question.</p>
<p>Then it is concepts.</p>
<p>So dumbbell, great.</p>
<p>Kettlebell, fine.</p>
<p>Barbell, awesome.</p>
<p>Band, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Body weight, none of these things are as important</p>
<p>because all you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is create a certain insult in the tissue</p>
<p>and the implement is just</p>
<p>whichever one you feel best doing it.</p>
<p>And this is where actually machines come into play a lot.</p>
<p>Machines are greatly underappreciated.</p>
<p>They are a fantastic resource,</p>
<p>especially somebody who&rsquo;s either early</p>
<p>in their fitness journey</p>
<p>or somebody who really is having a hard time</p>
<p>targeting a muscle group with a bigger compound movement.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re choosing exercises for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wanna start</p>
<p>with those bigger compound movements.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to drive a lot of the adaptation.</p>
<p>You can get to these single joint movements</p>
<p>like a little bit later.</p>
<p>But having said that,</p>
<p>because of the way that people move differently,</p>
<p>their anthropometrics and their biomechanics</p>
<p>and even their technique,</p>
<p>the same exact exercise will not necessarily</p>
<p>work the same exact muscle groups for multiple people.</p>
<p>So if you and I both went and did a back squat,</p>
<p>if you did it a little bit more</p>
<p>of what we call a high bar squat,</p>
<p>so this is the bar is literally</p>
<p>sitting up higher up on your neck.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re keeping your back more vertical.</p>
<p>And because in order to do that,</p>
<p>you shift your knees much further past your toes,</p>
<p>keeping of course your whole foot on the ground</p>
<p>in good position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to generally put more of an emphasis</p>
<p>on the knee joint.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>You tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there,</p>
<p>a little bit less work in the spinal rectus and back</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually not supporting</p>
<p>the weight horizontally,</p>
<p>which is a, it&rsquo;s a much more difficult position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vertically stacked, okay?</p>
<p>If I were doing the classic low bar squat,</p>
<p>which is again,</p>
<p>lowering the bar down further down my back</p>
<p>towards more like my shoulder blades,</p>
<p>I probably take a little bit of a wider stance.</p>
<p>And when I squat,</p>
<p>I drive my glutes back further away from the midline.</p>
<p>In, as a fact, as a general rule,</p>
<p>if you take the midline of your body,</p>
<p>the thing that moves is the farthest away from that midline</p>
<p>is likely to be the thing that&rsquo;s activating the most.</p>
<p>So in the case of the front squat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not generally going to be using your glutes as much</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in that, or not even front squat,</p>
<p>just that high bar squat where you&rsquo;re very, very vertical.</p>
<p>Your knees are going to be moving very far over your toes,</p>
<p>which is fantastic.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s a little bit more knee dominant,</p>
<p>as can we say it.</p>
<p>The other version here,</p>
<p>you can keep your shins really close to vertical.</p>
<p>You move your butt backwards.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to then lean forward with your torso,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;ll be more low back, more glutes,</p>
<p>and a little bit less knee.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a general statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily always true,</p>
<p>but as a guideline there,</p>
<p>that is one exact exercise where you may be going,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;m trying to improve this clear weakness</p>
<p>I have in my quads.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even leg extension my body weight.</p>
<p>I have a significant problem there.</p>
<p>So maybe in your particular case,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m hammering you or you&rsquo;re hammering yourself</p>
<p>in a squat exercise and you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>why your quads aren&rsquo;t getting any stronger</p>
<p>or growing in any size,</p>
<p>it may be because of the style of the movement.</p>
<p>So I may need to go, Andrew, all right, look,</p>
<p>squats in general, if you look at the research,</p>
<p>are an excellent exercise for quad development,</p>
<p>but for you, they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>because of the way you stand</p>
<p>or just because of neural activation, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So I need to take you to a machine</p>
<p>and isolate that muscle group</p>
<p>so we can make sure we see development in that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to grow a specific body part,</p>
<p>area, individual muscle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important that you&rsquo;re actually seeing progress</p>
<p>there and don&rsquo;t worry about, well, in the textbook,</p>
<p>the bench press is supposed to be good for your pec</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re not actually moving the right position</p>
<p>or it depends on the angle</p>
<p>in which your sternum actually sits in your body,</p>
<p>a bench press may actually be doing very little</p>
<p>for your pec and you may need to adjust</p>
<p>to say an incline bench or a decline bench or a pec fly.</p>
<p>So machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate</p>
<p>without having to worry about things like stability,</p>
<p>your low back position, getting hurt, where&rsquo;s your neck at,</p>
<p>you can really concentrate on just the movement,</p>
<p>concentrate on the muscle</p>
<p>and let everything else kind of go away</p>
<p>and ensure you&rsquo;re getting training in that specific area.</p>
<p>Those are excellent recommendations.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to ask about</p>
<p>is prioritizing specific body parts</p>
<p>and therefore specific exercises.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not necessarily referring to</p>
<p>trying to bring up a so-called weak body part,</p>
<p>an area that tends to be either genetically deficient</p>
<p>because in some cases, I learned for instance,</p>
<p>having seen a lot of competitive</p>
<p>track and field championships,</p>
<p>I love watching track and field as a spectator</p>
<p>up to Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there&rsquo;s a meet</p>
<p>and really love that.</p>
<p>The sprinters are amazing.</p>
<p>They have some of the highest calves in the world</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>I mean, like little micro calves, but they&rsquo;re fast as hell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right behind the knee</p>
<p>and they have a very long distance</p>
<p>between that calf and their foot,</p>
<p>which makes them propulsion excellent.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance as a competitive bodybuilder,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s something different</p>
<p>as being selected for in bodybuilding,</p>
<p>but obviously they&rsquo;re magnificent for sprinting.</p>
<p>Most people, of course, reside somewhere</p>
<p>between the extreme of very long muscle bellies</p>
<p>from origin to insertion or very, very short muscles.</p>
<p>Usually people have one or two body parts</p>
<p>that they want to emphasize for whatever reason.</p>
<p>These days, it seems to be people are really,</p>
<p>what are they saying now?</p>
<p>Like glutes are the new biceps</p>
<p>or the new glutes or I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, you see this stuff.</p>
<p>I love them both.</p>
<p>By the way, I am so pro curls in the squat rack.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Love it, right.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Nobody kill me.</p>
<p>So everyone has their thing</p>
<p>that they would like to emphasize.</p>
<p>But I have a question</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re specifically talking about hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which is should people give themselves permission</p>
<p>to not train a body part</p>
<p>if their goal is balanced hypertrophy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a couple of examples.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I, for instance,</p>
<p>not done a lot of free weight squatting</p>
<p>is because despite my quadriceps being rather weak,</p>
<p>according to you,</p>
<p>they tend to grow rather easily</p>
<p>relative to other muscle groups.</p>
<p>And the goal for me has always been balanced development.</p>
<p>And so I emphasize hamstring work</p>
<p>and I emphasize calf work and hamstring work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t train my quads at all,</p>
<p>but I do far less for them.</p>
<p>And I avoid the big compound movements for them.</p>
<p>I occasionally do them.</p>
<p>And again, this is not about what I do or don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>But I think that in the context of a conversation</p>
<p>about hypertrophy,</p>
<p>is it appropriate to give people permission to say,</p>
<p>listen, if you&rsquo;re just genetically strong, large lats,</p>
<p>doing a lot of chin-ups and rows</p>
<p>might actually be the worst thing for you</p>
<p>if your goal is balanced development.</p>
<p>And I ask because I don&rsquo;t often hear anyone,</p>
<p>any credentialed people</p>
<p>give people permission to completely avoid training</p>
<p>a given body part if their goal is balanced development.</p>
<p>And yet I think most people who are resistance training</p>
<p>are seeking balanced development.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anybody that actively wants</p>
<p>to have big upper body, small legs.</p>
<p>I think that comes from neglect and laziness in most cases,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s injury related or other things.</p>
<p>But I think this is an important point to raise</p>
<p>that any good program for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I would think would have to take into account</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s genetic and natural variation,</p>
<p>sport based variation in which muscle groups</p>
<p>just tend to grow easily for them</p>
<p>and which ones require a lot more focus and work.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>First of all, you have permission to do or not do anything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to do in terms of hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>I generally would not recommend</p>
<p>disregarding a muscle group entirely.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not what you actually suggested,</p>
<p>but just to make sure that people didn&rsquo;t hear it that way.</p>
<p>What I would do is in this example</p>
<p>is I would continue to do those big movements.</p>
<p>I would just keep the volume low.</p>
<p>So I might do two sets or something twice a week.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of reasons.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that those motor patterns are there.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that the,</p>
<p>especially the benefit of these compound movements</p>
<p>is you get to work so many complementary muscle movements</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>So in the case of like loaded squat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not only working stability in the hip</p>
<p>as well as the knee, but you&rsquo;re also working upper body.</p>
<p>Your rhomboids are keeping you in position.</p>
<p>Your neck has to stay in position, your toes,</p>
<p>everything is working.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really difficult to get those things</p>
<p>when you take that movement out</p>
<p>and you replace it with say a machine hamstring curl.</p>
<p>That whole element of balance and neurological control</p>
<p>is very, very important to maintain over time.</p>
<p>And that just gets removed if you go to machines only.</p>
<p>So I would keep some of those things in,</p>
<p>maybe even not all year round,</p>
<p>but maybe one quarter of the year,</p>
<p>two quarters every other rotate it, something like that.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s getting, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>if the reason you weren&rsquo;t doing say those squats was</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, ah, it hurts my back or something,</p>
<p>okay, great, then leave it out.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just simply,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want your quads to go too much,</p>
<p>I would just keep that volume low and do something</p>
<p>just to kind of touch it, keep it activated</p>
<p>and to maintain all those other things</p>
<p>like flexibility, range of motion.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bet anything,</p>
<p>your adductors are probably underdeveloped, right?</p>
<p>Now you can get those by doing your squats</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not really doing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in much adduction training.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s things like that,</p>
<p>that just get lost when you&rsquo;re only thinking</p>
<p>all big muscle groups that come inherent</p>
<p>in doing the larger movements.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them</p>
<p>or train them separately.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>And in reality, I do two to three really hard work sets</p>
<p>of hack machine squats per week,</p>
<p>which is plenty for me to maintain</p>
<p>and even get a little bit stronger.</p>
<p>But per our earlier discussion about a year ago,</p>
<p>I shifted to doing very low repetition ranges</p>
<p>to main strength in that movement.</p>
<p>But I am actively avoiding hypertrophy</p>
<p>in that muscle group.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or another solution would actually be</p>
<p>do something like one set to failure a week.</p>
<p>Not even extremely long,</p>
<p>just do something in the eight to 15 repetition range</p>
<p>at the end of all that strength set</p>
<p>and just get a little bit of pump there and then do it.</p>
<p>So just so that those muscles can touch that level</p>
<p>of fatigue, touch that level of strain</p>
<p>and mechanical tension, walk away.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>What about exercise order?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So implicit in this exercise choice thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna notice</p>
<p>is these modifiable variables interact with each other.</p>
<p>And you can clearly see how,</p>
<p>when we talked about volume and to clarify,</p>
<p>volume is the repetitions multiplied by the sets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically how we express volume.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s gonna be directly influenced by intensity.</p>
<p>The heavier load you put on the barbell,</p>
<p>the less repetitions you can do and the inverse.</p>
<p>Rest intervals, the shorter you keep your rest intervals,</p>
<p>then either the lower the weight has to go, the intensity</p>
<p>or the lower the rep range has to go.</p>
<p>Order is the same thing.</p>
<p>Choice is the same thing.</p>
<p>So all of these things modify each other.</p>
<p>They play a little bit of a hand</p>
<p>in what everything else does.</p>
<p>So with the exercise choice thing,</p>
<p>rolling into exercise order,</p>
<p>you get to play a couple of games here.</p>
<p>When we talked about strength and power,</p>
<p>I basically said stick to the big movements,</p>
<p>most complicated and compound movements first.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do that with hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You can do this in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>You can do the thing you&rsquo;re just simply</p>
<p>most interested in first.</p>
<p>You can do this thing called pre-fatigue.</p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re going to do a back day.</p>
<p>You could go in and do nothing but isolated biceps</p>
<p>as your very first exercise</p>
<p>and then roll into your pulling movements</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;ll see is during most pulling activities,</p>
<p>the biceps are a secondary or tertiary muscle group.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve pre-fatigued them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve guaranteed that muscle of most interest</p>
<p>got its most training in and everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>So you can start if you want with single joint movements,</p>
<p>you can start with isolation stuff</p>
<p>or you can start with compound stuff.</p>
<p>Either way, it just really comes down to preference</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re specifically trying to develop.</p>
<p>Now, this also goes back to the exercise choice question,</p>
<p>right, because it&rsquo;s sort of the same thing, right?</p>
<p>Like which one am I choosing?</p>
<p>And where I wanted to cap this was the exercise splits.</p>
<p>And so we just sort of talked about</p>
<p>am I doing body part splits?</p>
<p>And I know a question I get a lot here is,</p>
<p>well, which ones should I package together?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really concerned with it.</p>
<p>All you should worry about is how many times per week</p>
<p>and in fact total volume you achieve</p>
<p>on a muscle group per week.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t really matter how those things are folded in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a personal preference issue.</p>
<p>One mistake that we see here commonly</p>
<p>is grossly underappreciating</p>
<p>that the legs are not a muscle group, right?</p>
<p>So the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them.</p>
<p>So we see a classic split like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do shoulders and chest Monday</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll do, you know, biceps and forearms Tuesday</p>
<p>and then legs Wednesday or whatever.</p>
<p>And then back to upper body.</p>
<p>And then I was like, you&rsquo;re like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You have four days dedicated to the upper body</p>
<p>and one for quote unquote legs.</p>
<p>Well, like hopefully you can see the imbalance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen there over time</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to do far more upper body</p>
<p>than you are lower body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not appropriate.</p>
<p>So you just wanna think about your lower body</p>
<p>like you would do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do body part splits</p>
<p>then include those things as well.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t just chunk everything in as legs once a week.</p>
<p>If you wanna do that, that&rsquo;s actually okay</p>
<p>but that day has to be very, very challenging.</p>
<p>And you probably should do quite a bit of volume there</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re almost surely not going to hit</p>
<p>the total weekly volume needed to optimize muscle growth</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re literally only doing once a week</p>
<p>of your quote unquote legs.</p>
<p>So along those lines, let&rsquo;s talk volume.</p>
<p>How much volume does each muscle group need per week</p>
<p>in order to generate and for that matter</p>
<p>maintain hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Right, so the kind of minimum number</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna look for here is 10 working sets.</p>
<p>Per week.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Per muscle group.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And just to make sure that everyone&rsquo;s on the same page</p>
<p>if I do a chin up or a pull up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to mainly be training my back muscles,</p>
<p>my lats if I&rsquo;m doing it correctly.</p>
<p>Lats and rhomboids and biceps.</p>
<p>Right, but there&rsquo;ll be indirect targeting of the biceps.</p>
<p>So would you include indirect targeting?</p>
<p>So for instance, if you said 10 sets per week</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use biceps because it seems</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the go-to generic muscle.</p>
<p>Why is that by the way?</p>
<p>That when people ask somebody to flex their muscle</p>
<p>they always flex their bicep.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t flex their calf or their quad</p>
<p>or their glutes or something.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s some public decency issues.</p>
<p>I can tell you with my children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the very first muscle I taught them to flex.</p>
<p>Their glutes?</p>
<p>No, their biceps.</p>
<p>Oh, I got what you&rsquo;re gonna say.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Healthy parenting advice from Dr. Andy Yelpin.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s 10 sets per week for biceps</p>
<p>in order to maintain or further grow the biceps</p>
<p>but does that mean if somebody does 10 sets of chin ups</p>
<p>or 10 sets of chin ups in rows</p>
<p>that they are checking off any of the boxes</p>
<p>for biceps assuming that they&rsquo;re doing the movement properly</p>
<p>and targeting the major muscle group</p>
<p>that a given movement is supposed to target.</p>
<p>Which in my mind, when you&rsquo;re doing a chin up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to mainly be using your back muscles.</p>
<p>And then there are secondary muscles</p>
<p>or secondary activation of other muscles.</p>
<p>But of course, some people, their arms grow like crazy</p>
<p>when they do chin ups and their back doesn&rsquo;t grow at all.</p>
<p>So this is where we&rsquo;re back to the kind of</p>
<p>genetic preloading of the system, if you will.</p>
<p>So how does one meet this 10 sets per week minimum</p>
<p>when dividing different body parts</p>
<p>and thinking about this direct and indirect activation?</p>
<p>So two things, there&rsquo;s no specific exact rule here.</p>
<p>And this is why these set ranges are ranges, right?</p>
<p>And this is why we don&rsquo;t say like 10 is.</p>
<p>So 10 would be sort of the minimum number</p>
<p>you wanna get to.</p>
<p>The more realistic number that most people</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re advanced or even intermediate</p>
<p>is more like 15 to 20 working sets per week.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re very well-trained</p>
<p>you probably wanna even push more towards like 25.</p>
<p>And in fact, past that, there&rsquo;s not a lot of research.</p>
<p>So the optimal number may be 30.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to get that much work in.</p>
<p>It may actually even be detrimental.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re referring to natural athletes.</p>
<p>That is people who for whatever reason</p>
<p>either because they&rsquo;re not taking any prescription drugs</p>
<p>or maybe if they are whose levels of steroid hormones</p>
<p>mainly the androgens like testosterone, et cetera</p>
<p>do not exceed the normal reference range values</p>
<p>either because that&rsquo;s what they are naturally</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re replacing through pharmacology.</p>
<p>Whereas when we think of technically</p>
<p>someone could be taking exogenous hormones</p>
<p>to replace a deficiency</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s still a normal range, okay.</p>
<p>But I just wanna clarify</p>
<p>because you work with athletes</p>
<p>in a number of different sports</p>
<p>where drugs are and are not tolerated, et cetera</p>
<p>and the general population</p>
<p>that what we are talking about here</p>
<p>is for the general population</p>
<p>not for steroid using athletes.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So 10 was just sort of that like absolute minimum number</p>
<p>to maintain, which is actually pretty cool.</p>
<p>If you think about it this way,</p>
<p>if you went in and you did three sets of 10,</p>
<p>the very standard-</p>
<p>Three sets of 10 repetitions.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already at three.</p>
<p>You did that three days a week.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at your nine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost 10.</p>
<p>You also just went to the gym one day a week.</p>
<p>You did three sets of 10 and you did three exercises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at nine working sets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically done.</p>
<p>So achieving 10 sets per week per muscle group</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re not even talking about indirect activation</p>
<p>of a secondary.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to hit 10 fairly easy.</p>
<p>Extension of that, hitting 20 is actually still</p>
<p>not that hard</p>
<p>because of what&rsquo;s actually gonna happen there.</p>
<p>So in your example, if you&rsquo;re doing your chin-ups,</p>
<p>well, would the biceps count?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no exact rule there</p>
<p>because there could be technique issues.</p>
<p>It could be hand position.</p>
<p>So you mentioned chin-up very specifically.</p>
<p>A chin-up is actually gonna put your hands</p>
<p>in this position where your palms are facing up, right?</p>
<p>This is supination and pronation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be there.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually quite different than a pull-up</p>
<p>where your hands are in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>So a chin-up actually is gonna be pretty good</p>
<p>activator in your biceps for most people.</p>
<p>So you would expect actually to probably count that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be very difficult</p>
<p>to not see some fatigue in your biceps,</p>
<p>depending on your mechanics,</p>
<p>depending on, and by that I mean,</p>
<p>just the segment lengths of your bones, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where your muscles originate and insert.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something you could do better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a technique or a focus issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simple fact, the matter of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you pull best in that area.</p>
<p>The position of what your hands are</p>
<p>on the barbell, wider grip, more narrow grip,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to change muscle use.</p>
<p>So we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>I think in the previous episode</p>
<p>exercises do not determine adaptations, applications do,</p>
<p>but exercises do determine things like the movement plane,</p>
<p>the joint you use, and typically the eccentric,</p>
<p>concentric sort of ratio,</p>
<p>as well as oftentimes the muscle groups involved.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just not a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>depending on how you are built of, you know,</p>
<p>some exercises activating a secondary group</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not always a technique issue.</p>
<p>It may just be, that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re built, right?</p>
<p>The same could be true for a squat,</p>
<p>the high bar versus low bar sort of example</p>
<p>we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, you can see plenty of evidence</p>
<p>on muscle activation studies,</p>
<p>where people even doing the vertical back squat style</p>
<p>have tremendous glute activation</p>
<p>and folks doing the low bar</p>
<p>have tremendous quad activation.</p>
<p>So a lot of it depends on personal mechanics.</p>
<p>So what I counted as a question,</p>
<p>really you just have to ask yourself, number one,</p>
<p>do you really care that much?</p>
<p>You know, you have a range to get to.</p>
<p>If you were anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So if you count it or don&rsquo;t count it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna change the difference</p>
<p>between whether you did 17 working sets or 23</p>
<p>and either way you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>Number two, are you actually feeling anything there?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing your chin ups</p>
<p>and your biceps are blowing up, I&rsquo;m counting that, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing it and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t feel any fatigue there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all my, then I&rsquo;d probably say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re not even gonna count that as towards.</p>
<p>So you can just let that guide you a little bit</p>
<p>towards your count.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve always noticed that there are</p>
<p>certain muscle groups that are very easy to isolate</p>
<p>when under load.</p>
<p>And those are almost always the same muscle groups</p>
<p>that are easy to contract very hard</p>
<p>without any load whatsoever.</p>
<p>Bingo, you know, that&rsquo;s actually really insightful.</p>
<p>So you can kind of use this heuristic of like,</p>
<p>if you can contract your lats just standing here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to contract them very well</p>
<p>when you lift.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, you can probably assume</p>
<p>about the same thing&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So yeah, you&rsquo;ll know.</p>
<p>This actually, the lats are actually really interesting</p>
<p>because they tend to be one of the more difficult</p>
<p>muscle groups to learn how to activate.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in your journey and you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>I have no idea, and you can look up like a lat pose.</p>
<p>So how do you like, how do you puff your lats up?</p>
<p>How do you show it?</p>
<p>And if you do that and you&rsquo;re like, wow,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no movement here,</p>
<p>just recognize that&rsquo;s extremely common.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s probably going to take you</p>
<p>many, many, many months of trying</p>
<p>before you start to see some movements</p>
<p>and probably even a few years</p>
<p>before you really start to see activation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not some sort of like specific,</p>
<p>like special genetic anomaly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps.</p>
<p>Right, everyone can do that.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just like, man, I can&rsquo;t get this here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to stop doing it.</p>
<p>Do not do that.</p>
<p>Just keep at it and just keep concentrating</p>
<p>and thinking about that muscle group.</p>
<p>It will take some time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common to have challenges activating lats.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve noticed that many of the muscle groups</p>
<p>that were responsible for a large fraction</p>
<p>of the work in the various sports</p>
<p>that I played as a young child</p>
<p>are muscles that are very easy for me</p>
<p>to selectively isolate and induce hypertrophy in.</p>
<p>I suppose I&rsquo;m one of those mutants</p>
<p>where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle groups.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s because I swam a lot when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Literally going to ask me a swimmer.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like a telltale sign.</p>
<p>Every kid in my town swam and played soccer.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And then later I skateboarded and did some boxing.</p>
<p>You generally hear that answer is</p>
<p>you either were a swimmer or you were a wrestler.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like that pulling and pull toward you</p>
<p>is thousands of repetitions allowed you</p>
<p>to get very good at contracting.</p>
<p>But because I also played soccer and skateboarding,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t do any baseball, basketball, or football,</p>
<p>muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging</p>
<p>to activate and isolate.</p>
<p>So I do think that early development</p>
<p>is superimposed on a genetic template</p>
<p>that sort of predicts which muscle groups</p>
<p>are going to be easier or harder to isolate and train.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a very good case for why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to do as many different athletic activities</p>
<p>as you can in your youth.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you do skateboard,</p>
<p>definitely learn to ride switch</p>
<p>because every skateboarder I know</p>
<p>has one leg that&rsquo;s larger than the other</p>
<p>and one calf that&rsquo;s larger than the other.</p>
<p>And actually for that matter,</p>
<p>people that do martial arts that don&rsquo;t learn to,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not southpaw,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t learn to switch up</p>
<p>and do their work southpaw, you see the same thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re building an asymmetry into the system</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just muscular, it&rsquo;s neural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strongly neural.</p>
<p>So yeah, kids, parents,</p>
<p>get your kids doing a bunch of different things.</p>
<p>I suppose gymnastics would probably be the best sport</p>
<p>all around in terms of movement in multiple planes</p>
<p>and activating all the different muscle groups.</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of benefit, no question about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other things though</p>
<p>that it has limited ability.</p>
<p>So almost everything in, not like gymnastics is great,</p>
<p>but almost everything in that is pre-planned,</p>
<p>which is a major downfall, right?</p>
<p>So the joy of skating</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s so much proprioceptive input</p>
<p>that you have to make decisions very quickly</p>
<p>in small windows.</p>
<p>Now you have a little bit of that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re flipping in the air and you have to land,</p>
<p>but gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>and they work on that routine for years.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Skateboarding for me was transportation.</p>
<p>It was freedom and it didn&rsquo;t require any coaches</p>
<p>or parental oversight.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Ball sports have the beauty of reaction</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So all of them were wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah, good to do a lot of them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve established that 10 really to 20 sets per week</p>
<p>is the kind of bounds for maintaining</p>
<p>and initiating hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Yep, if I were to like flag one of them,</p>
<p>I would say 15 to 20 is the sets</p>
<p>that you wanna get working.</p>
<p>Now, it gets complicated when you ask,</p>
<p>well, how many reps per set do I have to get to?</p>
<p>Okay, well, we also can complicate that</p>
<p>by repetition type and tempo.</p>
<p>Just sort of let all that go for now</p>
<p>and just think if you&rsquo;re getting close to that range,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the spot.</p>
<p>And all you have to do now is balance two things,</p>
<p>recovery and continued training.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you&rsquo;re somewhere in this 10 to 20</p>
<p>working sets range and you&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>where you can continue to do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not so sore and so damaged and beat up</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t maintain that volume</p>
<p>for eight weeks at a time or at least six weeks at a time,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d probably say either the style of repetitions,</p>
<p>the amount of repetitions per set you&rsquo;re doing are too much.</p>
<p>The volume is getting to you.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re not seeing adaptations,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d say maybe the repetitions aren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the kind of game you&rsquo;re running.</p>
<p>Now, there could be plenty of other factors.</p>
<p>Intensity.</p>
<p>Of course, yeah, intensity, intent.</p>
<p>And then of course the other things, sleep, nutrition,</p>
<p>et cetera, all these other things</p>
<p>that go into our visible stressor category</p>
<p>that we always analyze.</p>
<p>This sort of brings up this idea</p>
<p>of responders and non-responders.</p>
<p>So we get this one a ton.</p>
<p>So why is it some people, my gym buddy, my roommate,</p>
<p>we go to sleep the same time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the same nutrition plan, we work out together,</p>
<p>she triples in muscle size and I don&rsquo;t have like no gain.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of work that we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>to identify the molecular mechanisms</p>
<p>behind responders and non-responders</p>
<p>because they clearly exist.</p>
<p>In fact, this is one of the reasons why every paper</p>
<p>I basically will ever publish again, if I do,</p>
<p>always reports individual person data.</p>
<p>So rather than group averages, you get to see,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s 10 subjects in it,</p>
<p>you get to see how each of the 10 responded.</p>
<p>Because the group average can get confusing.</p>
<p>What you really want to see</p>
<p>is how many actually people got better,</p>
<p>how many got worse, how many maybe changed and if so.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll always report those individual data</p>
<p>because when you go to train, you&rsquo;re you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not the group average.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important to know.</p>
<p>All right, so if you do that,</p>
<p>you can see a beautiful line of these hyper responders,</p>
<p>the bell curve in the middle of the normal responders</p>
<p>and those folks who like through any training study,</p>
<p>you just won&rsquo;t get any better.</p>
<p>If you can tease out what you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say in science,</p>
<p>you could tease out all the extra factors,</p>
<p>total stress load, hydration, sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>What you often see is non-responders,</p>
<p>a lot of the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they have a physiological inability,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that they need a different protocol.</p>
<p>And a lot of times it&rsquo;s they just need more volume.</p>
<p>So if they can handle that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not excessively beat up,</p>
<p>just give them more volume</p>
<p>and they tend to see a lot of breakthroughs.</p>
<p>You see the same thing with plateaus.</p>
<p>So typically it&rsquo;s sort of just like,</p>
<p>okay, the routine you&rsquo;re on, you&rsquo;ve been on it for too long.</p>
<p>We need to either go to the other end</p>
<p>of the hypertrophy spectrum for intensity,</p>
<p>which means like if you&rsquo;ve been in the like 60 to 70%</p>
<p>of your one repetition max range,</p>
<p>maybe we actually need to go heavier.</p>
<p>Take our repetitions down,</p>
<p>maybe even our total volume down and go heavier.</p>
<p>Try that, a great way to break through plateaus of grand</p>
<p>if all the other boxes are checked.</p>
<p>The other one is do the opposite,</p>
<p>which is like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go higher.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go set to 20, set to 25,</p>
<p>very high repetition range and really get after it.</p>
<p>Not to do as much damage</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t tend to get as sore</p>
<p>from those really high repetition ranges.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get more sore from the lower repetition,</p>
<p>higher intensity range</p>
<p>than you will typically the other ones.</p>
<p>And see if we can bust through some plateaus there.</p>
<p>So it just generally means you need to do something</p>
<p>a little bit different than your training partner.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about exercise choice</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about the number of sets</p>
<p>that one needs in order to induce hypertrophy per week.</p>
<p>What about repetition ranges?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned pretty broad repetition ranges.</p>
<p>How many repetitions per set is required</p>
<p>in order to induce hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Yep, so there are two caveats here before I give you,</p>
<p>well, the number is somewhere between like four to 30 reps.</p>
<p>30 repetitions.</p>
<p>Absolutely, in fact, I think you can go much higher.</p>
<p>The first 20 have to be, feel exceedingly light.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And during those first 20 or so repetitions</p>
<p>is the goal still to contract the muscle</p>
<p>as hard as possible on each repetition?</p>
<p>So this is the caveats here.</p>
<p>So caveat number one is there is an assumption</p>
<p>that by the end of this set,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting somewhat close to failure.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have to go to absolute failure</p>
<p>to induce muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but you also have to get kind of close.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re gonna do a set of 25 and you finish it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, ooh, yeah,</p>
<p>like that was kind of starting to get hard at the end.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be enough.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do a set of five or six</p>
<p>and the same sort of expression comes out of your mouth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be enough.</p>
<p>So in that case, it doesn&rsquo;t matter your rep range</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not getting somewhat close to failure.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be complete failure.</p>
<p>A good number to think about is like minus two,</p>
<p>which is what we call reps and reserve,</p>
<p>which is sort of like I got within two or so reps of failure</p>
<p>and then I stopped.</p>
<p>And can we define failure,</p>
<p>at least for sake of this portion of the conversation,</p>
<p>as the point at which you can no longer move the resistance,</p>
<p>it could be your body, it could be a weight,</p>
<p>a machine, et cetera,</p>
<p>that you can no longer move the resistance any more</p>
<p>in the concentric phase of the exercise movement</p>
<p>in good form.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really nice momentary muscular failure</p>
<p>is how we typically define it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful review, I think it&rsquo;s Open Access,</p>
<p>that just came out in the last handful of months.</p>
<p>Eric Helms&rsquo; team out of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Eric is a great scientist</p>
<p>and a very experienced physique coach</p>
<p>and a competitor himself.</p>
<p>So he knows a lot about this area.</p>
<p>And that paper went through all the exact definitions</p>
<p>in detail, all the caveats</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not gonna have time to get into today.</p>
<p>So I would recommend folks like check that out</p>
<p>if they want more information,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try to get to the highlights of it right here.</p>
<p>So what they basically showed is</p>
<p>going all the way to failure in the defining failure</p>
<p>like you just did, right?</p>
<p>So momentary muscular failure,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t complete another repetition</p>
<p>through a complete range of motion,</p>
<p>through whatever range of motion you determine prior to,</p>
<p>as well as with good technique.</p>
<p>So other body parts aren&rsquo;t being compromised,</p>
<p>sort of, et cetera.</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t need to be total failure, that minus two.</p>
<p>Failure is still needed in caveat two,</p>
<p>which is again, very, very highly trained individuals.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see people who are like Eric</p>
<p>or other folks who are six to eight to 10 years</p>
<p>into very serious training</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have to go to failure probably a little bit more</p>
<p>than what I just said.</p>
<p>So the layout that they brought in their paper</p>
<p>was very nice.</p>
<p>And they basically said,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s a couple of scenarios</p>
<p>in which going to failure is maybe the best way to do it.</p>
<p>Number one, you probably should do it</p>
<p>on a little bit of the safer exercises.</p>
<p>So maybe taking your back squat on a barbell</p>
<p>to complete failure</p>
<p>and doing that as like a standard protocol</p>
<p>multiple times a week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe not the best choice.</p>
<p>So maybe if you&rsquo;re gonna do barbell back squats,</p>
<p>you take that to your one or two reps in reserve,</p>
<p>stop there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>It actually, going back to our discussion</p>
<p>of the prolipin chart,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a similar idea, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re gonna spend most of your time</p>
<p>in these working sets, 70 to 90 sort of percent.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna take that failure</p>
<p>to maybe the hack squat machine</p>
<p>or maybe even the leg extension machine.</p>
<p>So a little bit of a safer exercise.</p>
<p>They also can tend to be single joint exercises,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to be,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just ones that are not as complicated</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not likely to injure other body parts</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing it, all right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way to go about it.</p>
<p>Another way to go about it is simply doing it</p>
<p>on like the last movement of the day, right?</p>
<p>And so again, you&rsquo;re not gonna do it</p>
<p>on your first three or four exercises,</p>
<p>but whatever your last finisher is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hit total failure on that one.</p>
<p>And that kind of keeps you in a range of,</p>
<p>yeah, you hit some failure.</p>
<p>You got a lot of overall work done.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of stimulus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of noise going to that nucleus</p>
<p>that says grow, grow, grow, grow, grow,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t totally obliterate yourself,</p>
<p>especially if you don&rsquo;t have the assistance</p>
<p>of anabolic steroids, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>If you have those, you can push this a lot harder</p>
<p>because your recovery would be significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>If not, you kind of want to walk away from that.</p>
<p>I have to assume that 99% of people listening to this</p>
<p>do not and yet among those who are not taking anything</p>
<p>in terms of anabolics,</p>
<p>there I think is a large range</p>
<p>of recovery quotients out there.</p>
<p>Some people just tend to recover better.</p>
<p>Some people I think also are far more diligent</p>
<p>about what I would call the necessary</p>
<p>but not sufficient variables of adequate sleep,</p>
<p>proper nutrition, limiting stress, and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t wait to break all that stuff down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a very long discussion for all those things.</p>
<p>We will get into it in all its practical realities</p>
<p>and actionables before long.</p>
<p>What about rest between sets?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>This is the interplay now.</p>
<p>So one actually thing we said for a long time</p>
<p>is you want to stick between 30 to 90 seconds of rest</p>
<p>between sets for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re trying to activate</p>
<p>this metabolic disturbance or disruption.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d need a little bit of a burn,</p>
<p>a little bit of a pump to go there.</p>
<p>More recent research,</p>
<p>a lot of these out of Brad Schoenfeld&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and others have shown that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Again, for moderate to newly trained individuals,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s the case for the highly trained folks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any difference here.</p>
<p>So you can take up to three to five minutes</p>
<p>of rest in between sets and be fine.</p>
<p>The caveat here though is this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna rest longer,</p>
<p>that means the metabolic challenge is lower.</p>
<p>So you need to then increase the challenge</p>
<p>in either mechanical tension,</p>
<p>which think about as weight, load, or muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t lower one of the variables,</p>
<p>keep everything else the same and expect the same result.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to have more rest,</p>
<p>then you need to either preserve the load on your bar</p>
<p>or the volume.</p>
<p>One of the two has to happen.</p>
<p>So this gives people a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>I generally tell people,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna train for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably best to stay in the two minute range at most.</p>
<p>You can go longer,</p>
<p>but a lot of people have a hard time actually coming back</p>
<p>and then executing that next set with enough intent</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>And, or it&rsquo;s going to make your workouts tremendously long.</p>
<p>So you can stick to the shorter one.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have as much mechanical tension, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You can still get there.</p>
<p>But in reality of it is, you can do whatever you would like.</p>
<p>Tell me if this is a reasonable structure,</p>
<p>given what you&rsquo;ve told us.</p>
<p>Three exercises per muscle group.</p>
<p>First exercise, slightly heavier loads.</p>
<p>So repetition range is somewhere between,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say five and eight,</p>
<p>with perhaps hitting failure close to it on the last set.</p>
<p>Rest periods of somewhere between two,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s get wild and say five minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s a little bit more of a strength type workout</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>But then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets</p>
<p>where the repetition range is now eight to 15,</p>
<p>shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so.</p>
<p>And then on the third exercise,</p>
<p>repetition ranges of 12 to 30.</p>
<p>This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I did a set of 30</p>
<p>thinking it was for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re saying makes absolute sense</p>
<p>and is research back.</p>
<p>So very short rest intervals,</p>
<p>maybe 30 seconds between sets.</p>
<p>Would that allow somebody to target</p>
<p>all three forms of major adaptation?</p>
<p>I mean, in my mind it works.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re talking about mechanical loads,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about stress and damage,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about metabolic stress.</p>
<p>Is that better than to, for instance,</p>
<p>do all the high repetition work in one workout per week</p>
<p>and then higher loads in the other workout?</p>
<p>Does it matter if you divide them up or combine them?</p>
<p>It would not matter.</p>
<p>I would say it matters in the sense</p>
<p>of your personal practical situation.</p>
<p>Well, long rest, for me,</p>
<p>I love training heavier with longer rest,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hearing that there&rsquo;s real value</p>
<p>to doing these higher repetition ranges.</p>
<p>So the formula you set up there in a second is great.</p>
<p>If you wanna do it the other way, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You really, it&rsquo;s kind of idiot-proof.</p>
<p>You can set this up however you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>You could actually do the inverse.</p>
<p>Theoretically, you could do the sets of 30 first</p>
<p>and then move to your sets of eight.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to just get to a certain total stimuli</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna hit it eventually.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of room to play here.</p>
<p>You also have a lot of room to adapt</p>
<p>based on your circumstances.</p>
<p>God, I&rsquo;m short on time today.</p>
<p>Typically, my workout takes me 60 minutes</p>
<p>for this plan I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only got 35 today.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re training for strength,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different answer</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re training for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you need to make sure you hit that total volume.</p>
<p>So in this particular case, lower the load,</p>
<p>lower the rest intervals,</p>
<p>and just get to the burn</p>
<p>and get going as much as you can.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for strength,</p>
<p>I would rather you cut your volume in half.</p>
<p>Get those few repetitions done at that high load</p>
<p>and just don&rsquo;t do very many sets today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a better result.</p>
<p>So the goal that you&rsquo;re going after</p>
<p>is going to determine what we call chaos management,</p>
<p>which is that thing like that,</p>
<p>running out of time today, my time is short,</p>
<p>or you didn&rsquo;t even think my time was short.</p>
<p>Something got cut off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling it today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a hotel, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is life, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be 10 to 50% of your workouts</p>
<p>is gonna be chaos management.</p>
<p>Well, how you make those decisions</p>
<p>is gonna go back to understanding,</p>
<p>number one, what goal you&rsquo;re going after,</p>
<p>and then number two,</p>
<p>what are the physiological consequences?</p>
<p>We call these physiological limiters for each one,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna tell you what to select</p>
<p>and prioritize, the volume, the intensity,</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask about frequency,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to frame it a little bit differently</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask about total workout duration,</p>
<p>which dovetails with frequency,</p>
<p>because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets</p>
<p>per week and one is combining different muscle groups</p>
<p>on the same days,</p>
<p>well, then workouts are going to be</p>
<p>a very different duration</p>
<p>than if one is doing a different body part each day,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>And so I feel like any discussion about frequency</p>
<p>has to be within the context of workout duration</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you are a lifting junkie</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very consistent in your schedule,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually okay with body parts,</p>
<p>but most people are not that.</p>
<p>And so the concern there is if you, say,</p>
<p>are isolating and waiting to do your glutes</p>
<p>on one day of the week</p>
<p>and something happens on that day,</p>
<p>you might go another 13 days now</p>
<p>before training, between workouts,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>The frequency won&rsquo;t be high enough</p>
<p>unless the load and volume on that one day</p>
<p>is astronomically high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So while if you look at the research,</p>
<p>frequency in terms of how many days per week</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter that much</p>
<p>as long as the total load and failure are equivalent.</p>
<p>Practically, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard because life gets in the way for most people,</p>
<p>especially if you have kids and a job</p>
<p>and all these things are there.</p>
<p>So I actually prefer doing something more</p>
<p>like three days a week of total body.</p>
<p>And if something happens,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just missed that body part for 48 hours, 72 hours.</p>
<p>I like that a little better for most people,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s more effective,</p>
<p>but just because it&rsquo;s a little bit more resilient to life</p>
<p>and you can get there.</p>
<p>If you wanted to actually do a little bit of a combination,</p>
<p>so if you wanted to do like two days a week of whole body</p>
<p>and then two days a week</p>
<p>of a little bit of a body part split,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re actually sort of hedging against all risks there</p>
<p>as long as you get to that total number there.</p>
<p>Now, there is actually some evidence in a couple of ways</p>
<p>that maybe a little bit more frequently</p>
<p>is a little bit better,</p>
<p>but the difficulty is now we&rsquo;re going back</p>
<p>to the practicality question</p>
<p>of like how many people really can train</p>
<p>just their strength training six days a week.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn&rsquo;t count any of their long duration stuff.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t how their high heart rate, their flexibility.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s just really, really, really hard</p>
<p>to get all that stuff in.</p>
<p>So it is, it tends to be easier on folks</p>
<p>in terms of execution and long-term adherence,</p>
<p>in my opinion, to get that volume accomplished</p>
<p>in a little bit more frequent patterns, but not once a week.</p>
<p>So I like to kind of have it right there for most people.</p>
<p>Not again, not because it is technically</p>
<p>quote unquote more effective,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re less likely to fail to progress</p>
<p>because of skipping a workout, something popping up,</p>
<p>your power going out in your garage door</p>
<p>being locked on you or whatever.</p>
<p>Imagine that, that happened to me this morning, folks.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t get out of my driveway</p>
<p>because the electronic gate was down</p>
<p>because the power was down.</p>
<p>Anyway, solve that problem.</p>
<p>The way you describe it, my sense is that workouts</p>
<p>will last somewhere between one and two hours of real work.</p>
<p>Is that about right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be nearly that long.</p>
<p>I mean, you could certainly get enough</p>
<p>to work done in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Even in a whole body workout.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing that three days a week,</p>
<p>so remember the numbers we&rsquo;re trying to hit here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re trying to hit 15 working sets</p>
<p>per muscle group per week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s five working sets per day for muscle groups.</p>
<p>So if you did one exercise for that day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you did squats, you did five sets.</p>
<p>You did that three days a week, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your 15.</p>
<p>But there are other muscle groups to hit</p>
<p>on the same day you&rsquo;re doing squats</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a whole body.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;ve gotten them all ready.</p>
<p>And so like all the leg muscles in that example</p>
<p>are taken care of.</p>
<p>Ah, so you would not do separate hamstring work necessarily?</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>Now, hamstrings is actually a little bit of a caveat.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a good example of an exercise</p>
<p>or a muscle group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably really good to make sure you isolate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s challenging to get with your standard deadlift</p>
<p>and squat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the probably ones that&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>to go target outside of that.</p>
<p>But in theory, theoretically though, outside of that,</p>
<p>you would get most of your leg muscles done</p>
<p>with even a single exercise.</p>
<p>And even if you wanted to change it up.</p>
<p>So you said, all right, Monday,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a squat variation.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the next day lift,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do some sort of deadlift hinging variation.</p>
<p>And then maybe Friday, my third day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do some sort of unilateral,</p>
<p>maybe rear foot elevated split squat or something like that.</p>
<p>All right, maybe even a lateral lunge,</p>
<p>maybe a different plane.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hit most of those muscles</p>
<p>to your 15 working sets.</p>
<p>Especially if you take sort of that last set each day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretty close to failure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna get some more serious work done,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna be so fatigued,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t come back and train it a couple of days later</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>So you could even split that up into two days a week.</p>
<p>And now all you really have to do</p>
<p>is hit something like seven working sets.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s two exercises per day,</p>
<p>maybe some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge,</p>
<p>you know, three to four sets each.</p>
<p>You can hit six to eight sets that day.</p>
<p>You did that three days a week.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden you&rsquo;re at that 20, 24 sets</p>
<p>but having a bit of a, same thing with your upper body.</p>
<p>I just gave lower body examples</p>
<p>because, you know, I like the lower body more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that challenging to get to those numbers</p>
<p>and split, and those workouts can be extremely short.</p>
<p>So if you were doing that three days a week,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re doing that one exercise everybody,</p>
<p>one exercise lower body,</p>
<p>that certainly shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 40 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hear that.</p>
<p>Not because I don&rsquo;t like training,</p>
<p>please excuse the double negative,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve found that resistance training workouts</p>
<p>that extend longer than one hour of work</p>
<p>and certainly longer than 75 minutes of work</p>
<p>leave me very fatigued.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>And fatigue to the point where concentrating</p>
<p>on cognitive work throughout the day can be challenging,</p>
<p>need a longer nap in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of naps in the afternoon in any case,</p>
<p>but requiring longer naps in the afternoon, et cetera.</p>
<p>So at least for me,</p>
<p>restricting the resistance training workouts</p>
<p>to about 50, five, zero to 60 minutes of real work</p>
<p>for me three or four times per week has helped tremendously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a case where doing higher intensity work</p>
<p>in a shorter period of time</p>
<p>and actually hitting muscle groups less frequently,</p>
<p>for me, that&rsquo;s again, once directly, once indirectly,</p>
<p>has worked really well.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>this could very well be explained by not my recovery quotient</p>
<p>as some sort of genetic or physiological variable,</p>
<p>but the way that I&rsquo;m training.</p>
<p>And indeed, I like to do a few four straps</p>
<p>and go to failure on too many sets.</p>
<p>And weaned in that genre of training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fun, like to just train hard.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fun.</p>
<p>It is, I think that I&rsquo;ve learned a lot</p>
<p>by training to quote unquote, to failure.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of learning in there</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s done safely.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing actually inspires me</p>
<p>to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits</p>
<p>and ways of training for hypertrophy and strength.</p>
<p>Because this notion of not necessarily having to go</p>
<p>to failure and still being able to evoke strength</p>
<p>in hypertrophy adaptations is a really intriguing one.</p>
<p>Dare I even say a seductive one.</p>
<p>And that leads me to a question</p>
<p>that is based on findings that I&rsquo;ve heard discussed</p>
<p>on social media, which means very little, if anything,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s in the context of people</p>
<p>who really know exercise science</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re one such person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this idea that because resistance training</p>
<p>can evoke a protein synthesis adaptation response,</p>
<p>but that adaptation response is last about 48 hours</p>
<p>before it starts to taper off,</p>
<p>that the ideal in quotes,</p>
<p>frequency for training a given muscle group</p>
<p>for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>So a couple of things there.</p>
<p>Remember in order to grow a muscle,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s multiple steps here.</p>
<p>So you have the signaling response,</p>
<p>which actually happens within seconds of exercise</p>
<p>and can last depending on the marker,</p>
<p>up to an hour or two hours.</p>
<p>Step number two then is gene expression.</p>
<p>And we see that that&rsquo;s typically peaked</p>
<p>around two to six hours post exercise.</p>
<p>And then you have following that protein synthesis.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that longer timeframe,</p>
<p>somewhere between 12 hours there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not peaked for 48 hours.</p>
<p>It may be still there 48 hours from now,</p>
<p>but it is absolutely coming down at that point,</p>
<p>depending on sort of a number of factors.</p>
<p>So that part of it is sort of true.</p>
<p>So this is a combination of like some half truths</p>
<p>and some like maybe just pedantic things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t really that important to differentiate.</p>
<p>The real question I think is like,</p>
<p>okay, is it okay to train sooner</p>
<p>slash is it better to train sooner</p>
<p>or actually is it better to wait longer?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real reason to think that you need to train</p>
<p>if the goal is hypertrophy,</p>
<p>any sooner than 48 hours afterwards.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of an advantage that that would confer.</p>
<p>I also can&rsquo;t think of any practical applications,</p>
<p>athletes, physique, bodybuilders, coaches</p>
<p>that ever found tremendous success doing that.</p>
<p>So I would be very skeptical that that is at any way better.</p>
<p>Now, could you do it in some instances of say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got travel coming up like that</p>
<p>so that you just&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>You wanna preload the system by destroying the muscle.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>And then waiting seven days or 14 days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known people who have done that before.</p>
<p>I do it all the time.</p>
<p>Vacations or layoffs.</p>
<p>Every time, like every single time.</p>
<p>So annihilate themselves and then take a two week layoff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no benefit there</p>
<p>other than psychological.</p>
<p>Like, I just love it.</p>
<p>Like, it feels great to be super sore.</p>
<p>I feel less crappy not training for those couple of days</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m super sore anyway.</p>
<p>You need the extended rest.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a crappy justification in my brain</p>
<p>that like, excuse to do something really wild</p>
<p>and that I totally don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>and get way sore than I should get.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin suggestions of what not to do,</p>
<p>but that he does.</p>
<p>Yeah, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>The famous words of every research professor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think 48 hours is a reasonable time to wait.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t think of any advantage of going sooner than that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really not a tremendous amount of advantage</p>
<p>of waiting much longer than that.</p>
<p>Certainly 72 hours is fine.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re hitting these concepts</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about, you can let really life determine that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s situations too with like,</p>
<p>particularly our athletes,</p>
<p>where we have to kind of break that</p>
<p>because of schedule obligations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playing every fifth day,</p>
<p>every third day or something like that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just going to have to lift them back to back days</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just going to have to get it done.</p>
<p>But yeah, I can&rsquo;t think of why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go out of my way to do that.</p>
<p>The second part of that question is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say somebody trains a muscle.</p>
<p>They train it properly.</p>
<p>They hit it in the appropriate rep ranges</p>
<p>and appropriate rest, et cetera.</p>
<p>That the stimulus is there.</p>
<p>The adaptation is set in motion.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting somewhere at 48 hours or so</p>
<p>a protein synthesis peak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to taper off.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later.</p>
<p>They train it five or six days later.</p>
<p>Not because they&rsquo;re lazy, not because they don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>but because they have other priorities</p>
<p>that are woven in with getting hypertrophy in this muscle.</p>
<p>There are people who exist only to get hypertrophy</p>
<p>in a given muscle group, but let&rsquo;s be fair.</p>
<p>Most people would like to grow that muscle group.</p>
<p>But then, does it necessarily mean</p>
<p>that the muscle starts to revert</p>
<p>to its pre-hypertrophic state?</p>
<p>That is, does it atrophy and get smaller again?</p>
<p>Because if it doesn&rsquo;t, I could see a lot of reasons</p>
<p>for hitting a muscle group once every five days</p>
<p>or seven days, provided you hold on to the hypertrophy</p>
<p>that you initiated five or seven days ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no reason to think you will lose anything</p>
<p>in that sort of a time domain, five to seven days.</p>
<p>The only challenge with training that infrequently</p>
<p>is can you actually get enough total volume done?</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re gonna train a muscle once a week,</p>
<p>you either have to go to real failure,</p>
<p>real damage and soreness, or you have to figure out a way</p>
<p>to hit 20 sets that day in that muscle.</p>
<p>Not at all impossible, especially if you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>well, actually, all I have to do is 15,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do five sets of three exercises.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not outrageous, not at all.</p>
<p>So, like, absolutely possible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wanting to go more towards 20</p>
<p>or getting closer to that 25,</p>
<p>now it starts to get pretty challenging.</p>
<p>So, scientifically, the research will suggest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be equally effective.</p>
<p>Practically, it&rsquo;s challenging for people</p>
<p>to hit sufficient volume</p>
<p>without just being so demoralized afterwards</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in so much pain</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t get out of their car</p>
<p>because their legs are so trashed.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t sit in the toilet and get back up</p>
<p>without crying from pain, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>I say that because those are actual examples</p>
<p>that have happened in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m realizing as we&rsquo;re having this conversation</p>
<p>about ways to stimulate hypertrophy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve sort of defaulted to more intensity</p>
<p>as opposed to volume because of the time factor.</p>
<p>I have a lot of other things going on in my life.</p>
<p>And so, within that hour,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get enough sets in</p>
<p>across all the muscle groups I need to hit,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m only gonna do it about once a week.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s, at least for me,</p>
<p>more advantageous to just train extremely hard.</p>
<p>I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique</p>
<p>that you mentioned before,</p>
<p>or pre-fatigue, as you referred to it,</p>
<p>of hitting something really strong</p>
<p>with an isolation exercise,</p>
<p>and then doing compound exercises.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think, based on what you&rsquo;ve told me,</p>
<p>that pre-fatigue and then a compound exercise,</p>
<p>in some ways, it&rsquo;s not really two sets.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re going to failure, four straps,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of pushing past failure,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re doing a compound exercise,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing that two or three times,</p>
<p>well, that sounds like four to six sets,</p>
<p>but the force repetitions</p>
<p>are almost like an additional set, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not 20 sets,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s four to six really, really hard sets</p>
<p>that go beyond what we normally think of as a set.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Okay, so the difference between running on concrete</p>
<p>and running on sand,</p>
<p>when I go for a sand run,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very different experience.</p>
<p>Totally, yep.</p>
<p>And this is why,</p>
<p>I should&rsquo;ve mentioned this at the very, very beginning</p>
<p>of our chat today,</p>
<p>but all of these numbers that I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>for any exercise adaptation,</p>
<p>you cannot think of them as hard lines.</p>
<p>They are gradients.</p>
<p>And so, when we think about the number for hypertrophy</p>
<p>in terms of repetitions,</p>
<p>I said four to 30.</p>
<p>What do you think happens at three?</p>
<p>Do you think hypertrophy just stops?</p>
<p>In fact, the number you&rsquo;ll see in literature</p>
<p>is more like six to 30.</p>
<p>I actually slide it down to four though,</p>
<p>like personal preference because of that,</p>
<p>but it just fades away.</p>
<p>What do you think happens at rep 31, 35?</p>
<p>It just fades gradually over time.</p>
<p>So, you actually sort of brought this up</p>
<p>in one of your earlier questions,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure if you were even thinking about this,</p>
<p>or maybe you were,</p>
<p>I just babbled on about something else,</p>
<p>but if strength happens between this</p>
<p>like one to five repetition range,</p>
<p>and hypertrophy typically happens</p>
<p>in this like eight to 30 range,</p>
<p>what happens if I were to do to sets of six,</p>
<p>or God forbid, seven?</p>
<p>Like seven and nine are these numbers</p>
<p>you just absolutely don&rsquo;t do in strength training, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like sets of one, two, three, four, five, six,</p>
<p>God, eight, 10, 12, like do not program a set of 13.</p>
<p>Now when I&rsquo;m training sets of seven and nine.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use sets of seven a lot</p>
<p>with weightlifters because you can actually count numbers</p>
<p>more effectively.</p>
<p>But what happens in seven to nine range?</p>
<p>So, this is actually a wonderful area</p>
<p>of these like five to eight repetitions</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna get a nice combination</p>
<p>of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So, someone who&rsquo;s coming in going,</p>
<p>man, I wanna get stronger and I wanna add muscle,</p>
<p>what do I do here?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually a really nice answer.</p>
<p>Train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot stronger</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll still induce a lot of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>If you want to really maximize hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I would probably spend most of your time</p>
<p>in the eight to 15 repetition per set range.</p>
<p>You can go up to 30, admittedly though,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s optimal to spend most of your time</p>
<p>at more than 15 reps per set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very challenging to maintain the focus required</p>
<p>at rep 27 to actually get sufficient failure by rep 30.</p>
<p>You just give up way too early, it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>The same thing at the bottom end of that spectrum</p>
<p>in terms of really heavy to get there.</p>
<p>So, I really honestly think eight to 15 is still,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cliche, it&rsquo;s that textbook number,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a reason, that&rsquo;s a textbook.</p>
<p>It is tried and true and very, very, very effective.</p>
<p>If for instance, you wanna get stronger though</p>
<p>and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you have a couple of tricks you can pull.</p>
<p>Number one, stay south of that five repetition range.</p>
<p>You do sets of one, sets of two.</p>
<p>Go as heavy as you can with all appropriate considerations</p>
<p>and stick within maybe even up to three reps per set.</p>
<p>You start getting to four to five to six,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re gonna start itching towards</p>
<p>that hypertrophy range.</p>
<p>So, stay down there.</p>
<p>Do a lot more total sets.</p>
<p>So, do a classic example would be something</p>
<p>like eight sets of three, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of practice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get 24 very high quality reps</p>
<p>with a lot of rest in between, right?</p>
<p>You go from there, you go to managing caloric intake,</p>
<p>making sure your protein is still on point,</p>
<p>you wanna recover, but if your total calories</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t greater than 10 to 15% above your maintenance needs,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to put on</p>
<p>a whole bunch of muscle mass</p>
<p>because you just don&rsquo;t have the fuel for it.</p>
<p>You can also then space your workouts out</p>
<p>so that stimulus isn&rsquo;t coming extremely often.</p>
<p>So, if you do that thing a couple of times a week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not enough frequency in that signal.</p>
<p>So, remember that signal has to be frequent or loud.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t make it super loud</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re not making it super frequent.</p>
<p>You can get very, very, very strong like that</p>
<p>and put on very low amounts of hypertrophy</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s sort of the choice.</p>
<p>So, you told us a lot about volume and frequency</p>
<p>and how that relates to protein synthesis and recovery</p>
<p>to evoke the hypertrophy adaptation response.</p>
<p>How should people think about systemic damage in recovery?</p>
<p>Because obviously the nervous system</p>
<p>and the way it interacts with the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>is the site of all the action here,</p>
<p>or at least a lot of the action.</p>
<p>And the nervous system can, in fact, become fatigued.</p>
<p>It has a great capacity,</p>
<p>but the whole system that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group,</p>
<p>like the biceps or the back,</p>
<p>is being allowed to rest while you&rsquo;re training legs</p>
<p>and other muscle groups,</p>
<p>that your whole neuromuscular system needs rest.</p>
<p>How does one determine whether or not</p>
<p>your entire body needs complete rest</p>
<p>or low-level active rest or exercise of a different kind?</p>
<p>So, I want to actually tackle this</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re on the topic of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that that&rsquo;s the goal in mind here.</p>
<p>Yes, here I&rsquo;m asking specifically</p>
<p>within the context of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I realize that for other training goals,</p>
<p>the answer to this question could be quite different.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So, we actually do this in a couple of different ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start local and work back to systemic, right?</p>
<p>Because number one,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really concerned about</p>
<p>is at the local muscle level</p>
<p>is am I going to create excessive damage?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean muscle damage here,</p>
<p>I mean injury, right?</p>
<p>So, the kind of rule of thumb we use</p>
<p>is like three out of 10 in terms of soreness.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re more than three out of 10 in terms of soreness,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to start asking questions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re higher than six out of 10,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably not training.</p>
<p>This is a subjective measure.</p>
<p>Total subjective measure, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll know very quickly, right?</p>
<p>If you can barely graze your pec with your fingertip</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, I don&rsquo;t care what you score that, we&rsquo;re not training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no damage.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re three out of 10,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m kind of like a little bit stiff here,</p>
<p>but once you get warmed up, you start feeling okay,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably okay to proceed there.</p>
<p>So, that is a very easy way to just think about soreness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be a little bit tight</p>
<p>depending on your training frequency.</p>
<p>Now, zooming out to systemic,</p>
<p>we use a whole host of things.</p>
<p>So, we actually have a whole host of biomarkers we use.</p>
<p>You can get a lot of these from blood.</p>
<p>So, you can look at things like creatine kinase.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the very common one, marker of muscle damage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll actually look at LDH.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look at myoglobulin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like, if you think about hemoglobin</p>
<p>is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout your blood.</p>
<p>The myoglobin is the part of that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually in muscle.</p>
<p>So, when muscle gets broken down,</p>
<p>that gets leaked out and put in your blood.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s one of the markers actually</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be associated with things like rhabdo,</p>
<p>which is like, you&rsquo;re gonna see your urine is purple</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extremely dark</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got so much muscle breakdown that happens</p>
<p>and kidneys can have a problem</p>
<p>and you put a bunch of stuff in there.</p>
<p>So, we use those biomarkers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll actually also look at probably a couple of things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re familiar with, ALT and ASD.</p>
<p>These are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>So, if we are actually suspecting</p>
<p>that this is a chronic problem,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna actually go in and pull some blood.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just like, I&rsquo;m super sore today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna use that subjective marker.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re seeing this as constant,</p>
<p>like, man, are we really pushing you way too much?</p>
<p>Is there some sort of systemic problem?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to blood</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna look at all those different things.</p>
<p>Now, AST to ALT is really specific</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna take us too far off track here,</p>
<p>but the ratio to those things</p>
<p>is actually very important as well.</p>
<p>So, if you look at the AST to ALT ratio,</p>
<p>typically the number we&rsquo;ll look at is like 1.67</p>
<p>as that ratio is like higher than that,</p>
<p>you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage.</p>
<p>But really, between me and you and a few of these listeners,</p>
<p>anytime we start seeing AST outkick ALT,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re immediately thinking,</p>
<p>as in the ratio being higher than one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re immediately thinking</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something happening muscle damage-wise.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s actually a sneaky good indicator</p>
<p>of just total muscle mass</p>
<p>because the vast majority of that&rsquo;s gonna be in muscle.</p>
<p>So, those are actually some markers that we like a lot</p>
<p>if muscle damage is the thing we&rsquo;re concerned with.</p>
<p>If we are more concerned with things</p>
<p>like total training volume, systemic overload,</p>
<p>then we may turn to something more like sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information we can actually glean</p>
<p>from changes in sleep behavior and function.</p>
<p>You could also look at things like HRV,</p>
<p>heart rate variability, which is a very classic marker</p>
<p>and much more sensitive to changes with training</p>
<p>than something like a resting heart rate,</p>
<p>which is one thing you can actually do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally cost-free.</p>
<p>Just look at your changes</p>
<p>and any elevation resting heart rate over time,</p>
<p>especially more than three to five consecutive days</p>
<p>is indicator, but HRV is much more sensitive</p>
<p>to things like training-induced overload.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a quick version of stuff</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna pay attention to.</p>
<p>The last one I would add there is simply motivation.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re really training hard</p>
<p>and you like training hard</p>
<p>and you just like cannot force yourself to go anymore,</p>
<p>that in and of itself can be a good indication</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s maybe not the day, maybe not the week.</p>
<p>With all of these things,</p>
<p>you wanna be careful about overreacting</p>
<p>to a single-day measure.</p>
<p>Again, we need to look at at least a trend</p>
<p>of more than three days.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m looking at more than five days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pull back from that</p>
<p>and think about what phase of training we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>what part of the year we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>typically whether athletes are in season,</p>
<p>pre-season, post-season, off-season, et cetera,</p>
<p>to make our decisions about what we&rsquo;re going to do about it.</p>
<p>Are we canning the entire workout?</p>
<p>Are we doing a modified, lower version, lower intensity?</p>
<p>My default, generally, if hypertrophy is the goal,</p>
<p>remember, volume is the driver there.</p>
<p>So, if I can, can we get in, can we go real light?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to six out of 10 RPE,</p>
<p>so relative perceived exertion.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll reduce the range of motion.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll make it a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll go to machines.</p>
<p>Instead of going to squat,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just do leg extension, something like that.</p>
<p>But I wanna still get enough volume in there.</p>
<p>That will keep you on target.</p>
<p>And again, even going at 50%, not to high repetition,</p>
<p>50% for a set of 10, three sets.</p>
<p>Just get a nice blood flow in there,</p>
<p>get it in, get it out, aid in recovery,</p>
<p>and then move on and come back the next day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what I would do</p>
<p>rather than canning the entire session.</p>
<p>How do other forms of exercise</p>
<p>combine with hypertrophy training?</p>
<p>For instance, can I do cardiovascular training</p>
<p>for two or three days per week,</p>
<p>provided that cardiovascular training</p>
<p>is of low enough intensity</p>
<p>and not disrupt hypertrophy progression?</p>
<p>And can I do that cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>before or after the hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>or does it need to be separated out?</p>
<p>The answer to this is really what we call</p>
<p>the crossover interference effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an energy management issue.</p>
<p>So the only time endurance exercise</p>
<p>starts to interfere or block or hinder,</p>
<p>attenuate hypertrophy is in one of two broad categories.</p>
<p>Number one, total energy intake or your balance is off.</p>
<p>So you can ameliorate this by just eating more.</p>
<p>If you do that, then the interference effect</p>
<p>generally goes away.</p>
<p>The second one is you wanna make sure</p>
<p>you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training</p>
<p>that are the same working group</p>
<p>and specifically the eccentric portion.</p>
<p>So for example, we see much more interference</p>
<p>with running on leg hypertrophy than we do cycling.</p>
<p>Right, less eccentric pounding and loading,</p>
<p>less damage, less things to recover from.</p>
<p>The tissue seems to be totally fine.</p>
<p>The only other thing you need to worry about here</p>
<p>is total volume of your endurance work.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing a moderate intensity</p>
<p>for a moderate duration,</p>
<p>say 70% of your maximum heart rate for 25 minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely to do much damage</p>
<p>in terms of blocking hypertrophy, you&rsquo;re totally fine.</p>
<p>Can you do it before or after your workout?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not gonna matter that much.</p>
<p>All right, so pre-fatigue is okay for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So if your pre-fatigue is coming from endurance,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re totally fine.</p>
<p>Not a big deal.</p>
<p>Afterwards, cool.</p>
<p>You wanna break it up into multiple sessions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably better, right?</p>
<p>So if you do your endurance work on a separate day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably best case scenario.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but you can break it up into two workouts,</p>
<p>say you lift in the morning</p>
<p>and then you do your quote unquote cardio at night,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s second best.</p>
<p>Third best is doing it at the end of your lift</p>
<p>and finishing it, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you&rsquo;re maximizing your recovery</p>
<p>on all the other tricks we&rsquo;ll talk about later,</p>
<p>make sure the calories are there,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re not doing a lot of eccentric landing</p>
<p>in that endurance stuff, and you&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>And where does higher intensity cardio</p>
<p>fit into a hypertrophy program?</p>
<p>So higher intensity cardio, for instance,</p>
<p>in my mind is getting on the assault bike</p>
<p>and doing eight intervals of 20 second sprints</p>
<p>and 10 second rest in between,</p>
<p>or perhaps going to a field and doing some bounds</p>
<p>and sprints and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Not going all out, not running for one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>but getting up to about 85, 90% of running for one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>So we have a lot less information</p>
<p>on the potential interference</p>
<p>or not of high intensity stuff.</p>
<p>The stuff we do have suggested</p>
<p>it may actually aid in hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because if you think about it,</p>
<p>one of the potential paths to activation and muscle growth</p>
<p>is this metabolic disturbance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get that a lot</p>
<p>with the high intensity interval thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a terrible thing to do.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do it to the level</p>
<p>that it compromises your ability</p>
<p>to come back and do your primary training.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re so fatigued,</p>
<p>your legs are super heavy, they&rsquo;re depleted,</p>
<p>you now have to ingest extra carbohydrates</p>
<p>to replenish muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>to be able to handle both recovery</p>
<p>and continue training, et cetera.</p>
<p>That could then lead to a problem.</p>
<p>But in general, we really don&rsquo;t see any reason</p>
<p>why that is going to completely block</p>
<p>or make it such that your training</p>
<p>was quote unquote wasted or it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And in fact, actually,</p>
<p>a very recent study came out</p>
<p>where they had individuals perform six weeks</p>
<p>of purely aerobic endurance,</p>
<p>steady state, long duration endurance</p>
<p>for six weeks, I think,</p>
<p>prior to starting a hypertrophy phase,</p>
<p>compared that to individuals who did not do that.</p>
<p>And those folks that did these six weeks of just,</p>
<p>I think it was cycling actually,</p>
<p>just endurance work had more muscle growth</p>
<p>at the end of their hypertrophy training</p>
<p>than those folks that did not.</p>
<p>So this shows you very clearly,</p>
<p>there are a lot of advantages</p>
<p>that come with being physically fit to growing muscle.</p>
<p>So folks that also have actually hit plateaus a lot,</p>
<p>one of the things you may actually see some benefit from</p>
<p>is actually doing a little bit more endurance work,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a steady state stuff,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the higher intensity stuff.</p>
<p>Certainly, if you&rsquo;re starting a training phase,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty good idea to do that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a number of physiologic reasons</p>
<p>of why that&rsquo;s potentially occurring.</p>
<p>But the lowest hanging fruit here is,</p>
<p>we sort of joke, you know, like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re so unfit that you&rsquo;re tying your shoes</p>
<p>in your warmup and you&rsquo;re already breaking a sweat,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t have enough fitness</p>
<p>to do enough training to get enough hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So that is, in fact, your limiting factor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not recovering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re super fatigued and damaged and sore</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so unfit.</p>
<p>So get fit first,</p>
<p>and then you can actually get more gains a week later.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of kick the can down the road</p>
<p>for a few weeks,</p>
<p>but 10 weeks later,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be in a better spot than you were</p>
<p>by investing a little bit in your conditioning.</p>
<p>So as you pointed out before,</p>
<p>and I can only assume you&rsquo;re referring to me,</p>
<p>hypertrophy training is idiot proof.</p>
<p>Meaning there&rsquo;s a lot of leeway in the variables,</p>
<p>but not so much leeway that people can do anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bounded by these general principles.</p>
<p>So with your permission,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a brief overview of my notes</p>
<p>based on your description of the modifiable variables</p>
<p>that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise choice,</p>
<p>exercise order, selecting appropriate volume</p>
<p>that sets and wraps training frequency</p>
<p>and needing some metric or way to have progression,</p>
<p>either by adding more weight or by more tension</p>
<p>or more metabolic stress and so on.</p>
<p>In terms of exercise choice,</p>
<p>it sounds like the choice of exercises</p>
<p>is not super critical in terms of specificity,</p>
<p>but that the ideal circumstance</p>
<p>is that people are targeting all the major</p>
<p>and frankly, secondary and minor muscle groups,</p>
<p>if you can even call them that,</p>
<p>across their exercise choices.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re picking exercises that they can perform safely</p>
<p>and that they can generate enough intensity</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re getting close to failure</p>
<p>without placing themselves into danger, right?</p>
<p>So for some people that might mean</p>
<p>including large compound free weight exercises</p>
<p>like squats and deadlifts and bent over barbell rows,</p>
<p>as well as isolation exercises.</p>
<p>And for some people,</p>
<p>there might be a bias toward more isolation exercises</p>
<p>and machines, but of course,</p>
<p>machines don&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t use heavy loads.</p>
<p>In fact, plate loaded machines</p>
<p>like hammer strength machines</p>
<p>allow for quite substantial loads.</p>
<p>So picking two or three or more movements per muscle group</p>
<p>can be valuable,</p>
<p>but that overall consistency</p>
<p>is going to outshine variation</p>
<p>in the sense that you don&rsquo;t need to hit muscles</p>
<p>with a different exercise every workout.</p>
<p>Coming back to the same things has a benefit.</p>
<p>And we heard about this in our discussion</p>
<p>around strength and power as well.</p>
<p>Okay, in terms of order of exercises,</p>
<p>there too, it sounds like there&rsquo;s a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>One could do the large compound exercise</p>
<p>for let&rsquo;s say quadriceps and hamstrings and glutes first,</p>
<p>like a squat or a front squat,</p>
<p>or could deadlift for that matter.</p>
<p>But then if one deadlifted</p>
<p>and primarily hit the glutes and hamstrings,</p>
<p>then you might want to target the quadriceps</p>
<p>more directly with leg extensions,</p>
<p>or if one squatted and was loading the squat bar,</p>
<p>carrying the squat bar in a way</p>
<p>that was predominantly quadricep</p>
<p>and less so glute and hamstring,</p>
<p>then leg curls would be a good choice, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, and train your calves, folks.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a genetic freak, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a good opportunity to say,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a genetic freak</p>
<p>or you just have a genetic predisposition</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve done sports</p>
<p>and you have a genetic predisposition</p>
<p>that gives you very large calves</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require any training at all.</p>
<p>I know people like this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somewhat rare, but they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>And those folks sometimes want to stay away from</p>
<p>or minimize their training.</p>
<p>You told me that even if you have a muscle group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a hyper responder in terms of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>getting at least one or two good hard sets per week</p>
<p>is good because you want to keep functionality</p>
<p>in that neuromuscular system.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Okay, in terms of volume,</p>
<p>again, we have a large amount of variation,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m hearing,</p>
<p>that the total number of sets per week</p>
<p>is a strong driving force of program design and selection.</p>
<p>That ideally you&rsquo;re performing 10 to 20</p>
<p>and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per week.</p>
<p>And that could be divided up across multiple workouts</p>
<p>or done in one workout,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s 10 to 20 sets per week per muscle group,</p>
<p>not really taking into account indirect activation.</p>
<p>So that would be 10 to 20 sets for biceps.</p>
<p>Your back work is going to hit your biceps a little bit,</p>
<p>maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really 10 to 20.</p>
<p>And given that hypertrophy can still occur</p>
<p>and maybe even occurs better with more volume,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t include the indirect work</p>
<p>unless something about the architecture of your body</p>
<p>and the inability to engage certain muscle groups,</p>
<p>like makes a pull-up really an arm exercise for you.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>The way that I would maybe define it is</p>
<p>typically with movements,</p>
<p>we consider there to be primary movers,</p>
<p>secondary movers, and then tertiary movers, right?</p>
<p>If it is a primary or secondary, I&rsquo;m probably counting it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s tertiary or less, I&rsquo;m probably not counting it.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So going back to our example of a pull-up.</p>
<p>So in the example of a pull-up,</p>
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t count the biceps in a pull-up,</p>
<p>but I would probably count the biceps during a chin-up.</p>
<p>Would you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up?</p>
<p>Probably not, maybe, like, it just depends.</p>
<p>Probably not though.</p>
<p>Okay, train the rear delts also.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only, honestly, the reason I answered that</p>
<p>is because most people don&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>for the rear delts anyways.</p>
<p>But they should, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to count it.</p>
<p>I wanted you to go out of your way</p>
<p>to make sure you did something specifically</p>
<p>for the rear delts.</p>
<p>For aesthetics and for functionality.</p>
<p>For health.</p>
<p>And balance across the shoulders.</p>
<p>Totally, neck, shoulder, all of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy to hear you say this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of people doing rear deltoid work</p>
<p>for all the reasons you described</p>
<p>and neck work for that matter.</p>
<p>I think people forget that the neck</p>
<p>is the upper part of your spine.</p>
<p>And for postural reasons</p>
<p>and for stabilization and safety reasons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really critical.</p>
<p>But I think most people aren&rsquo;t familiar</p>
<p>with how best to train the rear deltoids and neck.</p>
<p>And I know a number of people are afraid</p>
<p>of getting a big neck,</p>
<p>which for reasons that are still unclear to me</p>
<p>is referred to as no neck.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s leave out that no neck comment for the moment.</p>
<p>What are some good exercises</p>
<p>for targeting the rear deltoids and neck safely</p>
<p>that people can perform for stabilization</p>
<p>and for hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would recommend people check out Eric Cressy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a wonderful strength conditioning coach.</p>
<p>He actually is, I think, the director of pitching</p>
<p>for the New York Yankees now.</p>
<p>Is that spelled C-R-E-S-S-I-E?</p>
<p>C-R-E-S-S-E-Y, I believe.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a facility in, I believe,</p>
<p>Boston as well as in Florida.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s very, very involved in pitching</p>
<p>as well as hockey and things like that.</p>
<p>So he has so many free videos and resources</p>
<p>on so much of the shoulder girdle,</p>
<p>mostly because he&rsquo;s dealt with overhead</p>
<p>and throwing athletes.</p>
<p>And so the precision required there is tremendous.</p>
<p>You want to be very careful</p>
<p>when you start playing in this area</p>
<p>because the wrong positioning of your scapula</p>
<p>can cause a whole bunch of problems</p>
<p>in your neck and low back.</p>
<p>And so he would be a great resource</p>
<p>to go take a look at that.</p>
<p>Depending on how your scapulas are gliding and sliding</p>
<p>and the way that you want your rotator cuffs firing,</p>
<p>your rhomboids, it gets very complicated very quickly.</p>
<p>So you want to learn more, go there.</p>
<p>As a very, very quick couple of answers,</p>
<p>one of my favorite exercises is lying on a bench</p>
<p>or putting some bench</p>
<p>and then just doing a reverse fly, basically.</p>
<p>The reason I like stabilizing the rest of the body</p>
<p>is so you can make sure you can focus</p>
<p>on just using those rear deltoids</p>
<p>and putting your scapulas in the right position.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a specific set of cueing</p>
<p>that you want the scapula to move down and back for.</p>
<p>Again, check out Eric or any number of folks</p>
<p>in that area to do it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a very simple way,</p>
<p>the reverse fly to get there.</p>
<p>Great, and then in terms of neck exercises,</p>
<p>I was told to avoid bridges</p>
<p>because they can cause damage to the discs.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>I will probably never do a bridge ever</p>
<p>the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So isometrics are a great exercise for that</p>
<p>because if you think about</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re asking muscle groups to do.</p>
<p>In the neck, you mostly want it to be able to do</p>
<p>a certain type of rotation,</p>
<p>a little bit of flex and extension</p>
<p>and some other movements.</p>
<p>But in general, it should be being stable.</p>
<p>So you want to walk through these joints</p>
<p>asking kind of what they do.</p>
<p>Are they a moving joint?</p>
<p>Are they a stability joint?</p>
<p>In this case, you want to do there.</p>
<p>So isometrics are going to put you</p>
<p>in a much better position.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some actually pretty cool devices</p>
<p>that you can wear and you can put them on your head</p>
<p>and you can do all kinds of movement</p>
<p>and get some great training there.</p>
<p>Those are great starts.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t have any of that,</p>
<p>just basic isometrics are a great way to go about it.</p>
<p>Neck bridges would not be on that list for me.</p>
<p>No neck bridges, folks.</p>
<p>In terms of sets and repetitions,</p>
<p>we briefly touched on this,</p>
<p>but anywhere from I believe six repetitions</p>
<p>all the way up to 30 repetitions,</p>
<p>but probably more in the eight to 15 repetition range</p>
<p>for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Most of the time, yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just throw in there,</p>
<p>because I love this idea</p>
<p>that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation</p>
<p>related to strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that seven to nine range,</p>
<p>the no man&rsquo;s or no woman&rsquo;s land of training repetitions.</p>
<p>I always joke in class, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>okay, we go through the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like one to five strength, eight to 12,</p>
<p>you know, hypertrophy, and you&rsquo;re like, great.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>so six to nine means nothing will happen at all.</p>
<p>And the kids are just like writing down like.</p>
<p>Right, a good way for everybody to remember</p>
<p>that there are adaptations triggered</p>
<p>in the six to nine rep range</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a balance of strength and height.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just get thrown out of any gym</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a part of if you do that.</p>
<p>But the important point is to get close to failure</p>
<p>and occasionally hit failure,</p>
<p>maybe occasionally throw in a forced repetition</p>
<p>or a rest pause where you rest and then do a few more,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>But those intensity increasing maneuvers</p>
<p>will require a little bit more attention to recovery,</p>
<p>either time or attention in some other way.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a little bit of carrot I&rsquo;ll throw at people.</p>
<p>Because people generally don&rsquo;t like to be told</p>
<p>to not go to failure that often, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a handful of like half the folks are like,</p>
<p>sweet, I don&rsquo;t have to train that hard to get there.</p>
<p>And those folks it&rsquo;s like, well, yes,</p>
<p>but I also said you just can&rsquo;t like do a half workout.</p>
<p>You have to get pretty darn close to failure.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t really know what failure means.</p>
<p>So for that group, it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still probably harder than you think you wanna train.</p>
<p>The other group though,</p>
<p>that like wants to completely blow themselves out</p>
<p>every single time, dragging them back is more the key.</p>
<p>Now for those folks, here&rsquo;s what I can say.</p>
<p>If you make sure that your hidden stressors</p>
<p>and visible stressors are completely taken care of,</p>
<p>you can go to failure a lot more often.</p>
<p>And so you need to dial those things in</p>
<p>and then now you can go hammer yourself</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll recover so much quicker.</p>
<p>And we see this very commonly in all of our programs</p>
<p>with our athletes and our non-athletes.</p>
<p>That when we get the rest of the hidden</p>
<p>and visible stressors taken care of,</p>
<p>their training volume goes up so much</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll just start coming back</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like, oh my God, I&rsquo;m not sore anymore.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;m not nearly as sore.</p>
<p>I did this exact workout countless times before</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m doing it and I&rsquo;m not sore at all anymore.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Like we didn&rsquo;t do anything different with the programming</p>
<p>or really the nutrition,</p>
<p>but we got the rest of that allostatic load under control</p>
<p>and boom, things take off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot like drivers.</p>
<p>So many people seem to be riding the brake</p>
<p>and so many people seem to be heavy on the accelerator.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually one of the ways we describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you want to go faster?</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s inclination, step one is to hit the gas.</p>
<p>Our step number one is making sure</p>
<p>your left foot&rsquo;s not on the brake.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll go faster with less resistance,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;ll actually wear down the system</p>
<p>a lot slower by just taking your foot off the brake first.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re then not going fast enough,</p>
<p>now we can push the accelerator.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not pushing that accelerator</p>
<p>while your foot&rsquo;s still on the brake.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go a little bit faster,</p>
<p>but not as fast as you should be going with that much work.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to start wearing down brake pedals</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I like that analogy.</p>
<p>So hitting that 10 to 20 sets per week,</p>
<p>repetition range is pretty broad,</p>
<p>provided you get close to failure,</p>
<p>hit failure every once in a while.</p>
<p>Could be the final set of exercise</p>
<p>or maybe do one workout where you hit failure on everything,</p>
<p>but then you don&rsquo;t do it for a few more.</p>
<p>Again, there sounds like there&rsquo;s a lot of play</p>
<p>in the system here.</p>
<p>Rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds</p>
<p>all the way up to three or four minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how heavy you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>and how close to failure or to failure,</p>
<p>maybe even quote unquote beyond failure.</p>
<p>If there is such a thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training throwing in negatives and things like that.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get into really high intensity techniques,</p>
<p>but people, again, vary in the extent</p>
<p>to which they&rsquo;re pushing the system.</p>
<p>But there does seem to be some value</p>
<p>to mixing up the rest between set ranges</p>
<p>across exercises and across workouts,</p>
<p>but you could combine them all in the same workout</p>
<p>is what I heard.</p>
<p>And then in terms of progression,</p>
<p>it sounds to me like the goal when hypertrophy training</p>
<p>is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s one way one could do it,</p>
<p>but that the progression actually can arrive</p>
<p>through this really extensive kit</p>
<p>of changing the speed of movement,</p>
<p>changing the number of sets, adding some volume,</p>
<p>maybe changing the split so that you go from a three day,</p>
<p>a week full body workout to more of a body parts,</p>
<p>one or two body parts per day,</p>
<p>every other day or two on one off,</p>
<p>any number of different variations that are out there.</p>
<p>Sounds like all of these can and will work</p>
<p>provided that people are obeying the general principles</p>
<p>of this hypertrophy adaptation inducing protocol</p>
<p>that you described,</p>
<p>and that they are meeting the necessary</p>
<p>but not sufficient variables as well,</p>
<p>such as sleep, nutrition,</p>
<p>and managing the stress in the rest of their life.</p>
<p>Do I have that correctly?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really, really good.</p>
<p>One more thing I&rsquo;d like to add is,</p>
<p>this is a situation for hypertrophy</p>
<p>in which there are some exercises</p>
<p>that I actually don&rsquo;t think are good ideas.</p>
<p>So I wanna make sure we included those in the conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily the case for strength.</p>
<p>You can really do kind of whatever one you want.</p>
<p>And that is specifically plyometrics.</p>
<p>Although in fact, if you look at,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a recent review paper came out</p>
<p>showing that like plyometrics are effective as well</p>
<p>for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Sounds like one can do almost anything</p>
<p>as long as it falls within this parameter set.</p>
<p>The concepts are few and the methods are many,</p>
<p>and the methods for hypertrophy are many, many.</p>
<p>In general though, plyometrics are not my first,</p>
<p>second, or even like 100th choice for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re a part of a total training program</p>
<p>and you get some hypertrophy as a result,</p>
<p>cool, you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Not the first place I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>The other major category are weightlifting variations.</p>
<p>So that when I&rsquo;m saying weightlifting,</p>
<p>I mean specifically Olympic weightlifting</p>
<p>as in snatch, clean and jerk, and their variations.</p>
<p>Those are just not a good exercise choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the risk to benefit ratio</p>
<p>starts to fall pretty fast in the negative favor.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just not worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re in a sport</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s like the competition or whatever.</p>
<p>But if the goal is simply hypertrophy,</p>
<p>choose different exercises than that.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Now I realized that we are going to do entire episodes</p>
<p>related to nutrition, supplementation, recovery, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to just touch on two or three</p>
<p>specific topics and questions that come up a lot</p>
<p>around the question of hypertrophy specifically.</p>
<p>And that probably also relate to strength training</p>
<p>and training for speed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna ask these in not rapid fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you shorter answers, we&rsquo;ll put it that way.</p>
<p>So I will ask these questions now,</p>
<p>but with the caveat that we will get into these topics</p>
<p>in much more depth very soon.</p>
<p>The first question is about the use of cold showers</p>
<p>and ice baths and cold water exposure,</p>
<p>which I know many people use for resilience training,</p>
<p>to increase their dopamine, which it does,</p>
<p>and for recovery.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also this issue of when one should use cold,</p>
<p>that is deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>relative to hypertrophy training specifically.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>if deliberate cold exposure is done too soon</p>
<p>after a hypertrophy adaptation inducing workout,</p>
<p>right, and all the sorts of things we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>that the hypertrophy response can be blunted,</p>
<p>reduced, or eliminated.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>And if so, when could people do deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>while still also including hypertrophy training</p>
<p>in their program and still get hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So you know I&rsquo;m a lover of the cold.</p>
<p>I still have a deep freezer in my house</p>
<p>that is filled with water at all times</p>
<p>that I just plugged in and is a frozen chamber.</p>
<p>I still do the old school style of it.</p>
<p>Please unplug it before you get in it each time.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And then don&rsquo;t do it by yourself</p>
<p>so that the lid can close on top of you</p>
<p>and then we don&rsquo;t see you sort of ever again.</p>
<p>The Han Solo effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to upgrade</p>
<p>and get one of these new fancy ones,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been using this for so many years.</p>
<p>So I love it.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve been involved with XPT</p>
<p>and Gabby and Laird and Brian McKenzie and these folks.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been doing this stuff for a long time of,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t even know how many hundreds of folks</p>
<p>into the ice and a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of benefits</p>
<p>and we could talk about those later.</p>
<p>However, that being said, it is very, very true.</p>
<p>You do not wanna get in the ice</p>
<p>post-hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t wanna do that immediately after the workout.</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t wanna do it before the workout</p>
<p>and you probably don&rsquo;t even wanna do it that same day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>It will blunt hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And specifically, we&rsquo;ve talked earlier</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s driving muscle growth</p>
<p>is that signaling cascade through that gene expression,</p>
<p>through that muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Cold exposure blocks that signal.</p>
<p>Remember, adaptation comes from stress.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve put in a stressor in,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve blocked that stress.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve literally blocked the signal</p>
<p>that tells your body come back and grow larger size.</p>
<p>So not a good idea to do it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for some other purposes,</p>
<p>it may be strength.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an argument there, although maybe not.</p>
<p>For speed and power, maybe you can get away with it.</p>
<p>Endurance, maybe a separate conversation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in season,</p>
<p>I have no problem using it immediately after a game.</p>
<p>The goal is entirely different.</p>
<p>Even if we did a hypertrophy type of training program,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not doing it to try to maximize growth.</p>
<p>In that particular case,</p>
<p>our priority for recovery is higher</p>
<p>than our priority for muscle growth.</p>
<p>So we choose optimization in that category.</p>
<p>You can only make those choices</p>
<p>when you truly understand what is the goal for the day,</p>
<p>the week, the month, the phase of training,</p>
<p>and really what part of the year you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>We have that all plotted out</p>
<p>for all the people we work with.</p>
<p>So I know when we wanna choose one over the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, this is the choice you always make situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not how we operate.</p>
<p>We need more precision than that.</p>
<p>So that being said, we&rsquo;re generally not going to do it.</p>
<p>If we want to do a lot of icing during a phase</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re using a lot of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one, we may just not use it.</p>
<p>So there are phases in our training</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t wanna maximize recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna give you any tricks here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do ice or any of the other methods</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the whole point is to cause overload.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna be the stimuli to cause adaptation.</p>
<p>If all I&rsquo;m doing is blocking that stuff,</p>
<p>attenuating it, smashing it back down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m undercutting myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to feel a little bit better,</p>
<p>to have a little bit better performance right now,</p>
<p>knowing that&rsquo;s going to compromise the results</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to get six, eight, 10, 12 weeks from now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna choose at all.</p>
<p>And the reality of it is,</p>
<p>if I really am trying to maximize hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not doing any ice work</p>
<p>during that whole phase.</p>
<p>Maybe like my off day.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s similar to a setup you have,</p>
<p>like one day a week when I&rsquo;m not training,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll jump into some ice,</p>
<p>maybe even do some hot, cold contrast.</p>
<p>I love the XPT protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve probably talked about it before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great setup.</p>
<p>Or just not do it at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not something we need.</p>
<p>When we move into another phase of training,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to maximize adaptation</p>
<p>or maximize the result and get the benefit of that training,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna hedge more towards recovery</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna bring in some of these strategies</p>
<p>and techniques and not worry about causing</p>
<p>the most stimuli there,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to attenuate,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to actualize the work we did</p>
<p>six, eight, 10, 12 weeks before.</p>
<p>What about cold showers?</p>
<p>Do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect?</p>
<p>In general, no.</p>
<p>In general, you can do cold showers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be in there very long</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna get nearly as cold</p>
<p>as you will submerged in 30 degree ice water,</p>
<p>like the way that we do it nonetheless.</p>
<p>So I have no problem standing in the shower</p>
<p>for a couple of minutes using it for other reasons.</p>
<p>If you want to, that&rsquo;s no issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk a little bit about nutrition</p>
<p>and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Dr. Lane Norton, who&rsquo;s been a guest</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast and we both know,</p>
<p>threw out a number range related to protein intake</p>
<p>on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis can occur</p>
<p>by meal, across the day, et cetera.</p>
<p>A lot of research done there</p>
<p>and some important work by him in particular.</p>
<p>And then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>being the lower end of the range,</p>
<p>up to, I believe it was as high as 2.4,</p>
<p>maybe even as high as 2.7 grams of protein</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight per day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty broad range, but it&rsquo;s on the higher end</p>
<p>of what I think most people think of</p>
<p>in terms of protein intake.</p>
<p>And then again, some people might already be right there</p>
<p>or maybe even above that value.</p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on whether or not</p>
<p>people are omnivore, vegan, meat-based, et cetera.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t even go there,</p>
<p>but assuming people are getting enough protein per day,</p>
<p>so somewhere in that range,</p>
<p>and they are spreading out that protein intake</p>
<p>to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate</p>
<p>a certain amount of protein in any given sitting,</p>
<p>what do you like to see people ingest</p>
<p>at some point post-hypertrophy-inducing workout</p>
<p>in order to get the protein synthesis advantage,</p>
<p>if you will, that is stimulated by that workout?</p>
<p>Earlier, you mentioned the post-training feeding window</p>
<p>that in the 90s and probably earlier,</p>
<p>people were talking about,</p>
<p>oh, you know, within the first 90 minutes,</p>
<p>you have to get 30 minutes of, excuse me,</p>
<p>a certain number of grams of carbohydrate</p>
<p>and protein, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think now the understanding</p>
<p>is that that window is much broader</p>
<p>and how broad, et cetera, is still a matter of debate.</p>
<p>But when somebody is training specifically</p>
<p>for hypertrophy, assuming they are getting enough protein</p>
<p>from quality sources in their other meals,</p>
<p>and assuming that their overall macronutrient intake</p>
<p>and caloric intake is high enough,</p>
<p>that is they have enough of a caloric surplus</p>
<p>that they have the raw materials for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>what do you like to see people ingest</p>
<p>at some point post-workout</p>
<p>in order to facilitate muscle protein synthesis and recovery?</p>
<p>And this could include nutrition and supplementation,</p>
<p>or if you wanna divide those answers out,</p>
<p>feel free to do so, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, great.</p>
<p>So, a ton of work came out of Don Lehman&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>was actually Lane&rsquo;s mentor,</p>
<p>as well as Stu Phillips at McMaster.</p>
<p>So, a ton of work there,</p>
<p>and we can answer a number of things here.</p>
<p>So, Lane&rsquo;s numbers that he recommended,</p>
<p>also known as about a gram of protein per pound</p>
<p>of body weight, it&rsquo;s a great start.</p>
<p>Now, once you slide below that-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s per pound, right?</p>
<p>One gram per pound.</p>
<p>Right, and earlier, just to make sure,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re changing units here,</p>
<p>it was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>all the way up to, I think it was 2.4,</p>
<p>but maybe as high as 2.7 grams of protein</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>So, 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing.</p>
<p>So, 2.2 grams per kilogram</p>
<p>is the same as one gram per pound.</p>
<p>So, depending on where you&rsquo;re listening to this at,</p>
<p>one of those may be easier than the other for you.</p>
<p>If you start getting below that number,</p>
<p>now you do start running into questions of protein quality,</p>
<p>protein type, and protein timing.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why I actually fully agree with Lane,</p>
<p>is just get that number higher than you think,</p>
<p>and then all those other variables don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If that number is low,</p>
<p>then you need to start paying attention</p>
<p>to a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve added now complexity to your program,</p>
<p>things you gotta pay attention to,</p>
<p>just stay high and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And so, you can just leave a lot of those things</p>
<p>off the table.</p>
<p>That seems to be fairly clear</p>
<p>in the work of some of those gentlemen I just mentioned,</p>
<p>that as long as you get to that total number,</p>
<p>the question about timing and types and quality,</p>
<p>it seems to matter a lot less.</p>
<p>In fact, Stu&rsquo;s recent work in non-animal-based proteins,</p>
<p>it really showed that to be fairly clear,</p>
<p>that those are quite effective,</p>
<p>assuming total protein intake is high enough.</p>
<p>The amount of leucine and other amino acids</p>
<p>in those actual proteins matter less</p>
<p>if the total threshold is just super high.</p>
<p>So, just do that and you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Now, the other caveat we have to say here</p>
<p>is timing of macronutrients</p>
<p>is seems to be somewhat irrelevant for protein,</p>
<p>but that is not the case for carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So, that timing does matter.</p>
<p>Replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific</p>
<p>and you wanna make sure that that is around a lot</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing either maintaining training quality</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re sliding into endurance type of work.</p>
<p>And so, nutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates,</p>
<p>maybe less so with protein</p>
<p>and certainly less so with protein</p>
<p>if the total protein ingestion is high enough.</p>
<p>So, it depends on what we&rsquo;re going after</p>
<p>in terms of a training goal</p>
<p>and where we wanna get with all these things.</p>
<p>In general, the way that we like to think about this is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a strength type of work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re truly targeting that,</p>
<p>then a one-to-one post-exercise protein-to-carbohydrate ratio</p>
<p>is generally what we&rsquo;re gonna go after.</p>
<p>So, this would be something like 35 grams of protein</p>
<p>and 35 grams of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be post, it can be pre</p>
<p>or my favorite is actually mid or post,</p>
<p>but somewhere in that range,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re training in the morning</p>
<p>and you have not consumed anything prior to your workout.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not necessarily eating</p>
<p>in the middle of the workout, that&rsquo;s drinking calories.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be a&hellip;</p>
<p>I need to see someone eating a sandwich in the gym,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, so one-to-one is that like</p>
<p>sort of standard number here.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do sort of more</p>
<p>of a really hard conditioning workout,</p>
<p>that number slides up to something like three</p>
<p>or even four-to-one,</p>
<p>which would be carbohydrate to protein ratio.</p>
<p>So, if we wanna stay at 35 grams of protein,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go maybe as high as like 100</p>
<p>or 140 grams of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Again, depending on what type of training</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sort of doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do a little bit of a combination,</p>
<p>then you like a little bit of strength,</p>
<p>a little bit of conditioning</p>
<p>and kind of a standard workout,</p>
<p>which is probably something that a lot of people will do,</p>
<p>then you maybe wanna go to something like two-to-one.</p>
<p>So, 35 grams of protein, 60, 70 grams of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And those are kind of just like rough numbers</p>
<p>that you can go by.</p>
<p>And for pure hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>would you like to see people ingest</p>
<p>some carbohydrate post-training?</p>
<p>For pure hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>I wanna see that as many of those nutrients</p>
<p>around the training as generally possible.</p>
<p>Now, again, I may change my mind</p>
<p>when our fasting study comes out,</p>
<p>but as it stands now,</p>
<p>there is no advantage to not fueling around the training.</p>
<p>And there are some known</p>
<p>and some other potential advantages to fueling.</p>
<p>So, I just see no reason to not do it.</p>
<p>In fact, most people are generally going to do better.</p>
<p>Now, this is not science.</p>
<p>This is just my coaching experience.</p>
<p>And this is with our athletes and all of our non-athletes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve worked with and do work with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to be better spreading those meals out</p>
<p>generally throughout the day.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to be better</p>
<p>if they have those nutrients either pre, mid or post.</p>
<p>And so, they&rsquo;re going to get, even for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get something like that one,</p>
<p>three-to-one ratio of carbs to protein.</p>
<p>Personal preference.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like to eat before they train.</p>
<p>Some people have to eat before they train.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t put food in their belly</p>
<p>immediately after.</p>
<p>Work around that.</p>
<p>You can play based on personal preference,</p>
<p>but we want that fueling in there</p>
<p>because we want to maximize the potential growth</p>
<p>and we want to just get a jumpstart on recovery</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to be training again pretty soon.</p>
<p>Supplementation is a huge topic</p>
<p>and one that we will go into in great depth</p>
<p>in a soon-to-occur episode.</p>
<p>But if you had to pick one supplement</p>
<p>that can benefit most everybody, if not everybody,</p>
<p>for their training directed toward strength,</p>
<p>power and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>what would that supplement be</p>
<p>and how would you like to see people use it?</p>
<p>Meaning, how much should they take</p>
<p>and when should they take it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t count protein and carbohydrates as supplements,</p>
<p>they technically are, but we&rsquo;ll just walk out of that.</p>
<p>Right, sorry.</p>
<p>I should be more specific.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not referring to non-food form protein and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So, powdered protein and powdered carbohydrate, et cetera,</p>
<p>it technically are supplements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re highly processed, but I&rsquo;m not including that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to non-macronutrient type supplements.</p>
<p>Yeah, does testosterone count?</p>
<p>Well, in the context of this discussion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s testosterone that people are manufacturing themselves.</p>
<p>Ah, okay, the cheating kind, the endogenous kind.</p>
<p>No, I mean, creatine is the answer here without question.</p>
<p>It is the most well-studied.</p>
<p>It is the most effective and its benefits are robust,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re going to confer positive adaptations</p>
<p>across multiple physiological domains.</p>
<p>And we can certainly have a very long chat</p>
<p>about some of the interesting things that people,</p>
<p>in fact, we just had Darren Kandow</p>
<p>on our Barbell Shrugged podcast</p>
<p>and he went into extensive detail</p>
<p>about all the benefits of creatine</p>
<p>that people have no idea about,</p>
<p>including things like bone mineral density.</p>
<p>You asked about that earlier.</p>
<p>Creatine is actually fairly effective for that,</p>
<p>let alone the benefit in things like cognitive function,</p>
<p>decision-making memory,</p>
<p>the work that&rsquo;s being done there</p>
<p>for neurological disorders, depression,</p>
<p>a whole host of things that creatine is being studied for.</p>
<p>Some of those studies show a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>Some of it show maybe a little bit, some none,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a lot of things creatine can do.</p>
<p>So when we could talk about muscle recovery</p>
<p>or muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the bulk of the research is</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>In terms of type,</p>
<p>creatine monohydrate is still the best one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just because it has the largest evidence base.</p>
<p>You can maybe make some arguments for some other types,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really going to reach saturation pretty quickly</p>
<p>within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re at a dosage of anywhere</p>
<p>between like three to six grams per day.</p>
<p>Now, five grams is the very standard number we give.</p>
<p>Reality is I changed that number based on size.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the honest truth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 225 pounds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get the same dosage of creatine</p>
<p>as 125 pound girl.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like, this is not what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>So we may slide that number down a little bit closer to three</p>
<p>for the smaller girl, boy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just physical size.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of our 275</p>
<p>or 330 pound offensive right tackles in the NFL,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get the same dosage as everybody else.</p>
<p>So that number is going to go up to seven, eight, nine,</p>
<p>maybe even 10 grams a day on there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just kind of a scale.</p>
<p>In general, if you want an easy answer,</p>
<p>five grams is the standard.</p>
<p>Taken after training?</p>
<p>The timing doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>Take it in the morning breakfast,</p>
<p>take it at night, take it anytime you want, take it pre.</p>
<p>We tend to put it in a lot of people&rsquo;s workout shakes</p>
<p>just to make sure they get it in throughout the day,</p>
<p>but the timing is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that very informative answer.</p>
<p>And I look forward to much more discussion</p>
<p>about nutrition and supplementation and recovery</p>
<p>and all the rest in the episodes to come.</p>
<p>This was incredibly informative.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity.</p>
<p>I had a great time doing that.</p>
<p>I love talking about these things.</p>
<p>I also really like talking about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to get into in our next conversation,</p>
<p>which is the physiology of endurance, metabolism, and fat loss.</p>
