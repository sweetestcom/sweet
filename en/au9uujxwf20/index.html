<p>Ôªøso hey guys today we have a great
interview from Chris Hill and Chris</p>
<p>welcome to the interview I got you
before and after and it&rsquo;s a pleasure to</p>
<p>meet you you as well I&rsquo;ve been a big fan
and following your work for quite some</p>
<p>time now
awesome hey can you tell me a little bit</p>
<p>about your history of what happened to
you in the past did you have a weight</p>
<p>issue do you have health issues can you
talk a little bit about that sure um how</p>
<p>far back would you want me to go just to
the most recent what led me to all this</p>
<p>or um yeah yeah was there like a tipping
point where things were kind of getting</p>
<p>out of control and you said you know
what I better do something about this</p>
<p>sure sure well yeah there was um all
through my life I&rsquo;ve pretty much had</p>
<p>extra weight as a child in my teen years
I did play sports and you know I I was</p>
<p>more fit then and then uh moving into my
my 20s I started putting on weight but</p>
<p>if we fast-forward into my late 20s
early 30s where all this led me to you</p>
<p>but essentially I put on quite a bit of
weight just do poor diet eating habits</p>
<p>what I understand now to be insulin and
leptin resistance and you know just</p>
<p>eating lots of foods that were we&rsquo;re
telling me I&rsquo;m still hungry when I was</p>
<p>in and and all that kind of thing but
essentially the issue that when I came</p>
<p>across your channel had to do with
digestion I I had kind of similar to a</p>
<p>story you once told about the meat loaf
your maybe your grandmother&rsquo;s meat loaf</p>
<p>or unit eaten the meat loaf and had some
the pain in the middle of the night I</p>
<p>had a very similar situation and that
was one of the earliest videos I saw so</p>
<p>it connected me it connected and it all
started with pain in in the right</p>
<p>quadrant up here you know the typical
goal</p>
<p>blood or the fatty liver what whatever
it may be the after having a big steak</p>
<p>it I woke up in the middle of the night
with excruciating pain so I would say if</p>
<p>we fast forward to that that&rsquo;s where it
all began my journey began just to to</p>
<p>start this process of getting healthy
interesting interesting so it was more</p>
<p>on digestion than actual weight which is
which is was my thing as well like you</p>
<p>know being a guy like okay you have a
little weight issues not a big deal but</p>
<p>when you start having pain in your
gallbladder like kind of wakes you up</p>
<p>well and what&rsquo;s interesting was I had I
didn&rsquo;t know what it was it was I had a</p>
<p>lot of burning a burning sensation I had
the tightness of course in the shoulder</p>
<p>the neck all of that and I I can
remember I used to lay on tennis balls</p>
<p>and you know a golf balls right behind
my right shoulder to to get the pain</p>
<p>down and it seemed to give me temporary
relief but but I didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>acupressure back again which definitely
works but yeah it led into just a lot of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be walking through a door and I&rsquo;d
stop in the door jamb and I would stick</p>
<p>my back right there where that shoulder
blade was to just try to try to get that</p>
<p>at not to go away felt like a not so you
know I I call and I do these kind of</p>
<p>things so I thought maybe I tweaked my
back I didn&rsquo;t realize it was a diet</p>
<p>issue at the time you know and so I
thought hey I must have I must have you</p>
<p>know in the backswing done something
wrong so that&rsquo;s kind of you know I had a</p>
<p>lot of pain going on and had a lot of
confusion going on hey Chris that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting let me just help I want to
tell people a little more about that</p>
<p>because what he&rsquo;s talking about is right
shoulder white right quadrant problem or</p>
<p>underneath your right ribcage what
happened to me for about 12 years I</p>
<p>start having right shoulder pain
especially in your scapula on the right</p>
<p>side but on your right round boy back
here</p>
<p>start getting pain there and of course I
thought it was a wrestling injury and I</p>
<p>thought it was a you know something like
that so I had no idea was my gallbladder</p>
<p>so I actually ended up going into
chiropractic school because of that</p>
<p>thinking maybe well you know I got some
relief from an adjustment that I want to</p>
<p>do that but didn&rsquo;t really connect the
dots with the gallbladder so this went</p>
<p>on for years and years and years to the
point where you know it just becomes</p>
<p>cranky like I used to lay in the snow
and just try to get some relief on my</p>
<p>back in Wisconsin just to take the
inflammation way and have all sorts of</p>
<p>massage therapist people work on that
back and so you probably saw the video</p>
<p>do you have right shoulder pain or
something like that because I think that</p>
<p>was the name of that video and then once
you saw the gallbladder did that light</p>
<p>bulb go off at that point and go that&rsquo;s
something new well this was premature to</p>
<p>me finding their Channel
so just to give a quick sketch of it all</p>
<p>that this essentially led me into just
my my my doctor&rsquo;s office and we started</p>
<p>the process of figuring out what it was
which in the end was a three year</p>
<p>process believe it or not I was very
busy with work I was in a relationship</p>
<p>so it was kind of on the back burner but
I was certainly trying to figure out</p>
<p>what was going on some weeks it was
worse than others so long story short</p>
<p>you know I ended up getting my getting
the ultrasound scoped I had a chore I</p>
<p>all these different tests done and you
know they put me on medication all these</p>
<p>types of things that pep said a you know
the the proton inhibitors and all that</p>
<p>kind of thing and while they gave me
temporary relief because I also</p>
<p>obviously associated with this I had
terrible indigestion</p>
<p>you know over time I eventually came
across your material and I believe it</p>
<p>was along the lines of digestion or the
acid reflux because that of course</p>
<p>played hand-in-hand in this and that was
a</p>
<p>a very problematic as well and I I know
there&rsquo;s some controversy on hi4 I but I</p>
<p>did test positive for that
but I I know that you know that whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a breath test blood test dual test
I know there&rsquo;s people look at that</p>
<p>differently but um I did test pause as
they put me on all the antibiotics and</p>
<p>all this kind of thing so it&rsquo;s just a
process kept going through this process</p>
<p>I quit eating
I just couldn&rsquo;t eat anything so I ended</p>
<p>up losing a quite a bit of weight not
not to where I&rsquo;m at now but I lost a</p>
<p>good bit of weight strictly from just
not eating not because in a minute</p>
<p>fasting but I just could eat it was just
too painful and and so that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>led me into dr. Berg&rsquo;s channel and
information and and following you</p>
<p>Wow and learning from you getting an
education to leave did you see the video</p>
<p>I did unlike just massaging your gall
bladder did you did you see that</p>
<p>and did you do that and well yeah when I
when I learned about it I didn&rsquo;t use the</p>
<p>tool but I just the hands I did but that
was a later down the line of course so I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t find that initially initially
what fixed the acid reflux was</p>
<p>acidifying the stomach and I didn&rsquo;t
believe when the thing about your</p>
<p>approach that I appreciate it is like
with your blood numbers and all these</p>
<p>things you say just try it you know
being in peer assisted bout it if it</p>
<p>works you&rsquo;ll know it if it doesn&rsquo;t
switch it up and that&rsquo;s what I did I</p>
<p>started taking the apple cider vinegar I
started taking the digestive enzymes it</p>
<p>took a little bit of time but it
certainly started changing especially</p>
<p>when I got rid of all the you know GMOs
and started incorporating strict</p>
<p>strictly the organic selection at the
store um you know it took time but</p>
<p>though those things started I started
being able to see that my digestion was</p>
<p>off and my acid was off in fact and and
and so you snowball that with then you</p>
<p>learn about the acupressure and you
learn about</p>
<p>the more and more about how all these
mechanisms work inside the body it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s just an ongoing
education you can keep trying new things</p>
<p>and and that that&rsquo;s what happened Wow
yeah that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>demonstration to do if you&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;m doing
a seminar and someone comes up with</p>
<p>right shoulder pain you work on the gulp
you just press meet the red ribcage the</p>
<p>pain goes off like a switch and they go
what how did you do that it&rsquo;s and I</p>
<p>think you know people think that it&rsquo;s
just the fatty foods but it&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>sugar and the refined crap that we eat
that causes all better to go bad so</p>
<p>fast-forward you&rsquo;ve probably got some
improvement with the gallbladder and</p>
<p>then you watch other videos right oh
yeah I&rsquo;ve probably watched them Alda the</p>
<p>webinars you used to do you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re
older material I really really dug into</p>
<p>those because they were long and they
were very informative I didn&rsquo;t watch him</p>
<p>live I got to watch him recorded and I
would recommend anybody out there who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>looking to learn more about what you
talk about go to those webinars the ones</p>
<p>you do in your other office or whatnot
at home those are just packed with</p>
<p>information so yeah I went I started
going through all those things and then</p>
<p>I started going into the nutritional
ketosis lifestyle you know I always say</p>
<p>nutritional ketosis because a lot of
people when I say keto they go to that</p>
<p>80 90 percent fat and I&rsquo;m not talking
about that I&rsquo;m talking about you know</p>
<p>the low carb the 2025 maybe 50 whatever
it may be for somebody I like to make</p>
<p>that dissipation because I like talking
with family and friends you know you say</p>
<p>the word Tito then they go online and
they&rsquo;re confused and now you have you</p>
<p>know a long conversation so going
through all that material and taking</p>
<p>just lots of notes yeah it absolutely
just kept improving and improving and</p>
<p>and and of course then the weight after
the digestion was fixed like you say you</p>
<p>got that then the weight just again I
didn&rsquo;t come to this for weight loss it</p>
<p>just naturally started reducing</p>
<p>and I have to believe because of the
reduction of carbohydrates it&rsquo;s not so</p>
<p>much of in taking Baku&rsquo;s of fat but more
so lowering the carb and you know</p>
<p>insulin stays load and glucagon can
release its you know the way I</p>
<p>understand it now you know but you know
I know that&rsquo;s simplified but to me it</p>
<p>just makes sense so certainly I did keto
three meals a day for about the first</p>
<p>year this is before I knew about
intermittent fasting I didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>implement intermittent fasting until
about three months ago now I do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting and either one or two
meals max ma yeah so I I thought I</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right you know you skip that
breakfast I don&rsquo;t you know I don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the cheetah or not the cheat but you
know some people put cream and and MCT</p>
<p>oil and they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s breaking
it fast I keep it water or black coffee</p>
<p>and I make it to lunch have my two meals
and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m satisfied in me and I have</p>
<p>you to say I want to say this I have you
to thank for that because the digestion</p>
<p>obviously you fix that first then all
this stuff just kind of it&rsquo;s like Dom</p>
<p>and you just keep falling it goes right
and now it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like you get the</p>
<p>nutrients out of the food you feel good
and that&rsquo;s why I continue with you and</p>
<p>following this because it&rsquo;s proven
that&rsquo;s great I love it there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>like a personal experience to know for
yourself that hey it worked you know and</p>
<p>then so what give me an example of what
your meal would consist of okay and I</p>
<p>did want to mention this if anybody out
there is trying to fit you know I made</p>
<p>it I made an Instagram thing I don&rsquo;t I
don&rsquo;t do it anymore but it&rsquo;s just called</p>
<p>ten for keto T in the number four in
Quito and what I did was I did a food</p>
<p>log and there&rsquo;s no all it strictly is
Quito foods and what I ate for the first</p>
<p>year that was my three meals but I now
have changed it up a little bit I kind</p>
<p>of cut out a lot of the like the bacon
and things like that not because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad but I just I wanted to try something
different</p>
<p>so now mostly like so for lunch because
I&rsquo;ll skip breakfast I might have black</p>
<p>coffee for breath
but for lunch I typically have sardines</p>
<p>because I do that for the gaba and all
the omega-3 that&rsquo;s really important as I</p>
<p>Aikido has really helped my mind but I
typically am eating a sardines or a wild</p>
<p>salmon all of these things are wild with
avocado typically with nutritional yeast</p>
<p>and tumeric on that avocado every now
and then I&rsquo;ll add the macadamia you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add some some butter some Kerry
gold also I&rsquo;ll just pour it over over</p>
<p>the fish and obviously salad I the thing
about the potassium is so important and</p>
<p>I I supplement as well with the
wheatgrass juice and and and of course</p>
<p>coconut oil I use all those things but
basically that a lunch is typically like</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t tend to eat too big of
meals because I just seem to do better</p>
<p>with a little bit less and then dinners
pretty much the same thing maybe some</p>
<p>mushrooms added so you know if I eat
sardines for lunch I&rsquo;ll usually wild</p>
<p>salmon for dinner then I&rsquo;ll switch them
but typically nowadays I&rsquo;m only eating</p>
<p>fish that that&rsquo;s my main my main protein
source and fat - to a certain degree so</p>
<p>that that blog I did kind of isn&rsquo;t fish
and now it is fish and I lost I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important just for me to say to you
and just for everybody because you</p>
<p>already know this I lost a good bit of
weight doing the three meals a day</p>
<p>exactly how you explain them but when
I&rsquo;ve gotten towards the end now where am</p>
<p>I my maintenance is going to be doing
the in a minute fasting and switching to</p>
<p>two meals it the weight loss is a little
bit slower which is understandable</p>
<p>because the measurements are changing
but it um it works and and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good to get the last weight off is what
I&rsquo;m trying to say that&rsquo;s awesome what</p>
<p>was the amount of weight that you lost
so far well uh about 70 pounds</p>
<p>Wow I didn&rsquo;t even realize that was nuts
that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s been over 18 months so
it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s taken time and and</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve kind of
just you know no I wouldn&rsquo;t say enjoy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a learning process so I
have enjoyed it you know it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning and learning all
these new things it&rsquo;s very informative</p>
<p>do you have people around you that are
like that look at you know what the heck</p>
<p>did you do I mean are they kind of
impressed are they kind of like I would</p>
<p>see reaction that you&rsquo;re getting with
people around you yeah they want to know</p>
<p>the people who obviously who knew I was
overweight and have stable ought stable</p>
<p>off now they want to know about what
I&rsquo;ve done and and I&rsquo;ve had those</p>
<p>conversations you know so I I typically
I&rsquo;ll have a short conversation but then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll point them to the professionals and
people who who do this for a living and</p>
<p>know I mean if someone wants to have an
in-depth conversation I&rsquo;m up for it</p>
<p>but at the end of the day yeah
absolutely I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of</p>
<p>people about it in my immediate circle
outside of that you don&rsquo;t even if</p>
<p>acquaintances I don&rsquo;t really go into it
but you know and along those lines a lot</p>
<p>of people look at the ketogenic diet
nutritional ketosis as oh it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>a diet and I agree with you that it&rsquo;s
not it&rsquo;s an eating style it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lifestyle you know and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very
doable I mean I eat at home mostly um</p>
<p>you know I kind of freaked out about
going to restaurants because I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re cooking with and
I watch all the oils and all those</p>
<p>things that they talk about or that you
know you can find research for and stuff</p>
<p>but I think more so now I&rsquo;m more into
the research behind it all</p>
<p>researching the research like I like to
say I like to look at those things and</p>
<p>look at the studies and see what&rsquo;s
really you know you know dividing the</p>
<p>information mm-hmm I think you think I&rsquo;m
the same way I like to really know the</p>
<p>mechanics of it I want to know why it
works I want to see if there&rsquo;s any new</p>
<p>research I&rsquo;m um I&rsquo;m like into a big time
there&rsquo;s two things I wanted to mention</p>
<p>to people watching this number one
when you start doing this over a period</p>
<p>of time and you start to switch over to
fat-burning a hundred percent so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning your own fat you may even find
that your hunger goes away like you can</p>
<p>just keep going and you&rsquo;re not even
hungry because you&rsquo;re burning this fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only till you start eating that you
start like oh so now I&rsquo;m really hungry</p>
<p>but the point is that because you&rsquo;re
burning fat one of the things that it</p>
<p>talks about in guidance physiology is
that you could end up with fatty liver</p>
<p>if you just look online and try to do
ketosis as ketosis because it says keep</p>
<p>your carbs to 20 20 to 50 grams well
that would be like one piece of bread it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t talk about consuming a lot of
vegetables with the ketogenic that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m telling you to do
because it&rsquo;ll prevent a fatty liver give</p>
<p>you the potassium you need for the
nutrients to get you healthy and also it</p>
<p>keeps the liver clean so you don&rsquo;t end
up in the solid liver and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>minimize any type of bad effect that
ketosis can do I mean it just forces</p>
<p>your body into a fat-burning effect
which you know if you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>your nutrients is totally healthy so so
I think that one thing is you know</p>
<p>people say well you have to consume all
this fat on a ketogenic diet once you</p>
<p>get into it you don&rsquo;t really you&rsquo;re
going to find you don&rsquo;t even need to do</p>
<p>as much fat as in the beginning part as
you&rsquo;re having a hard time going from</p>
<p>meal to meal like you might even feel a
little nauseous if you do too much</p>
<p>butter or something like that so play
around with it you know it&rsquo;s just kind</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s a learning experience and those
are the two points I wanted to recommend</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not you know cuz if I can just
say one thing along that line I did the</p>
<p>I went against for a month or so eating
reducing the salads and things that I</p>
<p>had been doing in mass amounts and I had
a lot of digestion issues and</p>
<p>constipation and things like that so
what you would again I like the test</p>
<p>things just to see how I react to them
and since then I would do that anymore I</p>
<p>keep like you&rsquo;re saying the vegetable
and the salad very high I&rsquo;m the same way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like even sometimes I&rsquo;ll test it
out and if there&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>vegetables on a certain day
I just don&rsquo;t feel quite right I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know what you need to put it in
there so awesome hey Chris it was</p>
<p>amazing before and after it&rsquo;s a great
live demonstration of how you did this</p>
<p>correctly and and tested it as well so
you have amazing before-and-after 70</p>
<p>pounds and that&rsquo;s awesome so well yeah
and thank you for all that you do you</p>
<p>you really are helping a lot of people
out here and we&rsquo;re driving people to</p>
<p>your site I know it&rsquo;s not just me just
because it works and if you follow what</p>
<p>you say it will work it might take time
but it works it just stick with it</p>
<p>absolutely thanks so much Chris great so
staying you know keep me updated on your</p>
<p>future progress and we&rsquo;ll we may do this
in the future sometime but it was nice</p>
<p>meeting you you as well hey thank you so
much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>all right well bye okay bye bye</p>
