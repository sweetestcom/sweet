totally</p><p>legal in the</p><p>state of california</p><p>it’s pretty</p><p>trippy because</p><p>you drive down the street</p><p>and i was driving</p><p>those street yesterday and we were looking for places</p><p>where we could</p><p>you know like we</p><p>could see how many</p><p>places are near my house</p><p>there’s like fucking</p><p>20 places within a couple</p><p>miles of my house</p><p>that i can go</p><p>and a lot of them</p><p>they just say</p><p>collective on it it’ll say like</p><p>west hills collective or</p><p>fucking dick street</p><p>collective whatever</p><p>and they’ll have a red</p><p>cross and that’s all you need</p><p>to know and everybody knows that it’s weed they have</p><p>green letters everybody uses</p><p>green letters</p><p>and they’re</p><p>everywhere and you go</p><p>and if you have one of</p><p>these right here this is brian’s</p><p>if you see this this is a real legitimate</p><p>recommendation from a doctor and this</p><p>all you do is you go to a doctor you say</p><p>marijuana helps me</p><p>sleep whatever</p><p>and the doctor will give you one of</p><p>these legitimate</p><p>recommendations</p><p>a legal prescription</p><p>state of california from marijuana</p><p>and then you go to</p><p>these places and some</p><p>of them you can pay with a fucking credit card it’s the</p><p>trippiest thing ever</p><p>you you buy weed with a credit card and you’re like</p><p>what year is this it’s two</p><p>thousand and nine</p><p>but the rest of the country</p><p>still living in the dark ages</p><p>colorado is</p><p>catching up</p><p>colorado has a</p><p>bunch of places now</p><p>colorado actually is</p><p>gonna open up</p><p>medical marijuana restaurant</p><p>and they’re</p><p>gonna open up some 30 000 square foot weed</p><p>superstore and boulders fucking gigantic it’s like</p><p>three stories isn’t</p><p>texas even doing like a vote sooner</p><p>yes yeah well</p><p>a lot of people are trying</p><p>in a lot of</p><p>states are trying</p><p>massachusetts recently made it</p><p>they decriminalized it it was</p><p>they don’t have any medical law yet there but now it’s</p><p>completely not</p><p>legal but it’s not illegal it’s a weird thing like</p><p>you’re not allowed to sell it like possession is one</p><p>thing but selling it</p><p>is a different</p><p>thing you’re still not allowed to sell it</p><p>which is fine let people fucking grow it</p><p>you know really</p><p>fucking fucking</p><p>hunter s thompson had it right</p><p>hunter s thompson when he was running for sheriff</p><p>he was saying that no drug</p><p>good enough to be taken should be allowed to be sold</p><p>that was like a law that he was gonna pass in aspen</p><p>and he was gonna call aspen fat city he was</p><p>gonna change the name of aspen to fat city</p><p>he was gonna tear up all the roads</p><p>and sod the streets so it was all dirt roads everywhere</p><p>he fucking lost by 400 votes</p><p>it’s only 400 votes</p><p>if he won if he was the sheriff of aspen</p><p>that would have been fucking badass</p><p>but one of the things that he wanted to have was that</p><p>any drug that you can take that’s good enough to be</p><p>taken should be legal and he’s fucking totally right</p><p>you know if people want weed it should be people</p><p>should trade things for we don’t you know what fuck it</p><p>you should be able to buy if you want to</p><p>but the problem with that is</p><p>you know then you’re</p><p>gonna get some really unscrupulous people that just</p><p>wanna sell pot</p><p>you know they just want to sell it</p><p>and they want</p><p>to make profit off of it and then it becomes</p><p>like anything else</p><p>they try to cut out the competition</p><p>like one of the wheat</p><p>stores that i go to there’s a guy</p><p>right next door to him</p><p>that opened up like i’m talking like</p><p>right next door like there’s</p><p>maybe like one</p><p>store front between two</p><p>wheat stores</p><p>and guys pissed off and he’s fucking this guy’s a dick</p><p>that’s totally not in the spirit of</p><p>you know what marijuana supposed to be</p><p>me you’re not supposed to be opening up</p><p>right next to</p><p>store to a dude and killing his competition</p><p>but he shouldn’t be like fuck that dude you know what’s</p><p>that dude doing he’s just another dude selling weed</p><p>yeah i shouldn’t be doing it</p><p>right next to you yes correct but</p><p>don’t be an asshole</p><p>you’re fucking selling weed pal</p><p>you know you ain’t</p><p>fixing the world</p><p>hunteris thompson is my hero and i’m</p><p>planning full sleeves</p><p>of ralph steedman</p><p>art are you really wow that’s a fucking good idea</p><p>steadman steadman</p><p>or steedman</p><p>i forget i say his name is a steedman</p><p>fucking i love his art his arts perfectly goes like</p><p>what’s the word i’m looking for</p><p>compliments</p><p>hunter s thompson’s writing you know that guy</p><p>just fucking nailed it from the very</p><p>first time they worked together</p><p>when they did that</p><p>the kentucky derby</p><p>is decadent and depraved</p><p>from that story</p><p>all the way onto</p><p>fear and loathing in las vegas that</p><p>ralph guy he fucking nailed it</p><p>he was hanging with hunter</p><p>he totally got the vibe that hunter was writing</p><p>he totally got</p><p>where hunter was seeing things</p><p>you know i just</p><p>started getting into hunter s thompson</p><p>really recently</p><p>i was i guess</p><p>maybe a year and a half ago i was</p><p>staying in a</p><p>hotel room in seattle</p><p>and i ordered up</p><p>gonzo on the pay per view in the hotel</p><p>just because</p><p>that nothing else looked good said fuck it i’ll just</p><p>check this out and</p><p>i immediately became a hunter</p><p>s thompson fan i</p><p>started reading his books and</p><p>i’m reading the one i’m reading now</p><p>the one i’m reading now is this one</p><p>great shark hunt</p><p>it’s great it’s got everything in there it’s got a</p><p>bunch of his different shit fear and loadings in there</p><p>the kentucky derbies in there a lot a lot of</p><p>great stores like a collection of his works</p><p>the quintessential</p><p>well need to open grow homes with retail</p><p>fronts yeah</p><p>keep it all easy that’s what i’m talking</p><p>about if you’ve</p><p>never been to</p><p>a grow room before i’ve only been to one grow room</p><p>it was pretty interesting there was</p><p>a place in la</p><p>where they it was a full service</p><p>place you can get a prescription there</p><p>you could get weed there and you could</p><p>what you kind</p><p>of seeing a</p><p>picture with me hi</p><p>you could get weed there and they grew it</p><p>so there was like this back room</p><p>where they had all</p><p>these lights set up it was pretty fucking</p><p>trippy man like it was a big ass room</p><p>and it was filled with these</p><p>plants and they were all lit up</p><p>and you walk through the plants and</p><p>like yeah they were alive</p><p>you know they’re living</p><p>plants but it felt like</p><p>like they were conscious like</p><p>maybe it was because i was really high</p><p>that might be but</p><p>maybe because i was really high</p><p>i was able to tune into it but it was it was a very</p><p>weird sensation it felt like i was around</p><p>like living entities</p><p>i didn’t just feel like they were</p><p>plants it felt like they were alive</p><p>you know it was very strange it’s cool</p><p>i thought about i was like</p><p>that be cool to have something like that in my house</p><p>but that’s pretty illegal</p><p>federally at least</p><p>you know if they caught you with a bunch of</p><p>plants in your</p><p>house you know they’d be like hey</p><p>bitch what are you doing with those</p><p>you’re allowed to have</p><p>yeah we allowed to have a bunch</p><p>you can have like up to six</p><p>plants i think you’re actually allowed</p><p>to have more because you have that</p><p>extra oh that’s</p><p>right i have an exemption</p><p>because i’m a fucking real stoner</p><p>is two of these fucking with us here</p><p>no but you can you can

when</p><p>white guys do it i love when white girls do it</p><p>to me it’s just like watching</p><p>chimps at the zoo when they fuck each</p><p>other when they go crazy it’s like wow</p><p>this is weird this is interesting</p><p>when white people around black people they</p><p>start acting black</p><p>there’s no better example than the steven seagal show</p><p>holy shit have you seen what he does that</p><p>he pulls up to a group of</p><p>black people’s like what up cuz what’s going on</p><p>oh dude much love much love he talks</p><p>black like really condescendingly</p><p>and then you know when he’s</p><p>in the car when the cameras on he’ll talk like buddhist</p><p>says it says like</p><p>stupid shit you know</p><p>the one monk</p><p>was walking</p><p>with the younger monk and the younger monk says</p><p>what is the way of buddha</p><p>way and so the older monk</p><p>throws him in the water deep</p><p>he talks it</p><p>like he’s two totally different dudes he talks like the</p><p>steven saga</p><p>who’s like the mystical man and the steven seagal</p><p>who is this fucking strange cop</p><p>in louisiana he has a</p><p>southern accent that he uses part of the time</p><p>part of the time</p><p>and then occasionally he drops the</p><p>southern accent and he goes with a full on</p><p>black accent like</p><p>ladies in the hood</p><p>but steven seagal is a fucking cop like for real</p><p>like he puts on a bulletproof vest</p><p>he gets in his fucking car</p><p>and they go</p><p>fight crime</p><p>and it’s like</p><p>who is letting him do this</p><p>like how crazy</p><p>is it that all you have to have is a couple fucking</p><p>movies have you seen his website</p><p>oh it’s genius</p><p>yeah it’s awesome</p><p>is it steven seagal com</p><p>i think so have you seen jim</p><p>you seen jim carrey’s website</p><p>yeah jim carrey</p><p>has the most amazing website in the</p><p>whole entire world</p><p>it’s pretty cool</p><p>i’ve never seen a better website</p><p>yeah it’s very very unique but</p><p>when i see websites like that i wish i</p><p>still tripped on shrooms all the time</p><p>cause i was just sitting at his website all day</p><p>yeah no shit</p><p>beyond the mind’s eye</p><p>yeah the so called show is fucking</p><p>oh what the fuck</p><p>been attacked</p><p>this behind me this sign</p><p>is a point of controversy</p><p>from the man show when i hosted it i know it’s terrible</p><p>listen we thought it was terrible too</p><p>we got fucked</p><p>when doug stanhope</p><p>and i went to do that show they lied to us they</p><p>told us you can do nudity we’ll blur it out you can</p><p>swear we’ll beep it out we want you to go</p><p>crazy we want to get sued it’s</p><p>gonna be great publicity</p><p>and then when we</p><p>started doing it</p><p>first of all janet jackson</p><p>pulled her nipple out and everybody went fucking</p><p>crazy this shit</p><p>crazy we’re</p><p>still feeling the</p><p>effects from that it’s amazing</p><p>like literally</p><p>television got set back a decade</p><p>because of janet jackson’s nipple</p><p>and the big</p><p>thing was that they were</p><p>showing it during the dinner hour and children were</p><p>watching well</p><p>isn’t like a</p><p>woman’s nipple</p><p>are we that fucking crazy</p><p>it’s not like she had a</p><p>rifle up her</p><p>pussy it’s a fucking nipple</p><p>you know that’s where</p><p>babies feed it’s it’s is it that offensive</p><p>that’s for babies</p><p>it is man that’s the first</p><p>talking about it</p><p>being during the dinner hour</p><p>somebody had a really good</p><p>point when this happened</p><p>he said isn’t that like the first meal</p><p>that’s like the dinner yeah i mean</p><p>breasts yeah you see that</p><p>since you were a kid well</p><p>you know what</p><p>especially having kids on my own</p><p>now when i see mrs rogan</p><p>make fucking milk with her</p><p>tits and i’m like i see</p><p>the tits are dead to me i don’t suck on them anymore</p><p>but what’s more important</p><p>is that you look at them and you say that’s like</p><p>those are that’s like</p><p>where food comes from like it’s not offensive</p><p>but anyway this</p><p>thing behind us make me hard</p><p>this is how fucking</p><p>stupid they were when we were doing the show</p><p>there was an argument</p><p>and we came up with a game show called</p><p>make me hard</p><p>and what it was is the guy</p><p>would be strapped into a</p><p>chair and he</p><p>would have this box on his dick and with a</p><p>light would go off in the box</p><p>and you know</p><p>the light would</p><p>indicate that he has a boner</p><p>and so we’d have like</p><p>midgets eating</p><p>bananas and shit and oh he’s getting hard you know</p><p>it was kind of corny</p><p>but what we really the reason why we did it is</p><p>one of the gags was</p><p>we had this really hot</p><p>chick and she</p><p>climbs all over him the audience is</p><p>going fucking</p><p>crazy they’re</p><p>going nuts and</p><p>this really hot chick</p><p>at the end of this who pulls her</p><p>tits out he’s sucking on her</p><p>tits whipped</p><p>cream the whole deal</p><p>and then she pulls her panties off and she’s got a dick</p><p>and the audience goes</p><p>crazy she was a tranny</p><p>and i mean i’ve</p><p>never heard a bigger wave of</p><p>disappointment</p><p>than when this</p><p>this tranny pulls</p><p>out this dick and she was taking all kinds of hormones</p><p>so it was like a dick that had been poisoned</p><p>it looked like dead it was like like dark</p><p>it was dark and shriveled up like it burned</p><p>like chemically burned like it was like a little dead</p><p>monkey dick</p><p>what’d it smell like</p><p>and she pulled it out and she</p><p>starts like</p><p>swinging around in the fucking audience went</p><p>crazy and the guy sit in the chair just</p><p>had this look in his face of heart</p><p>well they approved all that</p><p>but what they</p><p>wouldn’t approve is that the name of the show</p><p>make me hard</p><p>they said that we had a name to show</p><p>make me stiff</p><p>like just like an argument</p><p>like for real like there’s a difference like</p><p>they mean the same</p><p>thing just make me</p><p>stiff doesn’t</p><p>sound doesn’t</p><p>sound quite as</p><p>funny really</p><p>doesn’t matter i mean what’s the difference but the</p><p>point was that they were willing to</p><p>argue this it was a big deal for them</p><p>and that shows you how</p><p>these shows work</p><p>the best shows like</p><p>like stand up</p><p>comedians like if you take a guy like dave chappelle</p><p>or you know katt williams or anybody any</p><p>good comic that you like</p><p>they write all</p><p>their own shit they</p><p>write it they perform they’re saying shit that they</p><p>think is funny</p><p>they are the</p><p>producer they are the performer they’re the</p><p>whole ball of wax they’re the writer they’re everything</p><p>and that’s why you get a pure product</p><p>because you get a product that’s from this dude’s mind</p><p>well what happens is when you like</p><p>start working on a</p><p>television show</p><p>these people that are working for the network</p><p>somebody has to work for the network and you</p><p>would assume</p><p>that the people at the very top of the food chain</p><p>are the perfect people for the job</p><p>but that’s not true</p><p>they’re just</p><p>people that some i know they got that fucking job</p><p>and a lot of them they like to</p><p>think that they know what’s good like to</p><p>think they have an eye for and they always want to put</p><p>their footprint on it</p><p>they want to put</p><p>their handprint on it they want to change something</p><p>and the anything</p><p>i think the</p><p>background should be blue we’re</p><p>gonna ruin the</p><p>whole show with this red background</p><p>and they’ll go</p><p>crazy and they’ll fucking</p><p>fight over this</p><p>why because they want to be the one to say well</p><p>it was me that decided for the blue</p><p>background if they didn’t go with that blue</p><p>background the show was shit am i right</p><p>and then the wife will</p><p>agree with them</p><p>and they all get fucking pilled up together</p><p>that this is what they argued over</p><p>make me hard so this is i got to keep this sign</p><p>because it was useless</p><p>because we had to change the sign to make me stiff</p><p>like it’s okay to pull out your fucking dick</p><p>it’s okay to have a guy strapped to a</p><p>chair thinking a</p><p>chick is on top of them</p><p>and this chick pulls out this</p><p>wrinkled poisoned black dick</p><p>that’s okay</p><p>but you can’t call it hard you have to call it stiff</p><p>it’s really that dumb it seems like i</p><p>would be exaggerating but</p><p>that’s why dave</p><p>chappelle walked away from the chappelle show</p><p>it’s just cause</p><p>when you’re a comic</p><p>having somebody</p><p>else tell you what’s good and what’s bad</p><p>like there was one of the</p><p>things we did in the man show where</p><p>we wanted joey diaz</p><p>if you don’t know what joey diaz is</p><p>his twitter is mad flavor one word</p><p>madflaver and joey</p><p>diaz is one</p><p>of the funniest dudes i’ve ever met in my life</p><p>he’s like one of the funniest</p><p>human beings to ever live</p><p>and joey weighs like</p><p>350 pounds he’s down to 300</p><p>but back then he was like 350</p><p>and he would</p><p>always get naked we get</p><p>naked all the time get</p><p>naked on stage</p><p>and his balls</p><p>literally look like</p><p>grapefruit in an old lady’s pantyhose</p><p>i mean they’re fucking</p><p>ridiculous and he</p><p>doesn’t shave them</p><p>but they have no hair on him</p><p>like he has no hair on his arms no hair on his chest</p><p>and he’s fat as fuck</p><p>and we wanted to have him</p><p>introduce us to the beginning of</p><p>every show he kicks open this door</p><p>and comes out yelling let’s get this</p><p>party started</p><p>and his balls are jingling it’s fucking hilarious</p><p>first of all it’s hilarious</p><p>cause joey’s hilarious no matter he could read</p><p>doug stanhope</p><p>said joey diaz</p><p>could read the</p><p>phone book and it’d be</p><p>funnier than most of the shit you see on late night tv</p><p>and that’s totally true</p><p>but they were like that’s not</p><p>funny what’s funny</p><p>about this this is not</p><p>funny no

and just finished it like real sloppy</p><p>like really bad action</p><p>scenes like</p><p>the killing the</p><p>vampires like so easy it was really stupid</p><p>it was really good in the beginning i was like what a</p><p>great premise</p><p>that the fucking airplane lands everybody in the</p><p>plane is dead they can’t figure out what’s going on</p><p>the alternative</p><p>vampires and takes over the</p><p>whole city it’s pretty fucking bad i was</p><p>this one vampire like infected the</p><p>whole plane</p><p>but then it just</p><p>turns into dog shit</p><p>most of the 16 hoes aren’t

news</p><p>radio was a</p><p>news radio was like a privilege</p><p>you know i was like what the</p><p>whole time i was doing i was like i can’t even believe</p><p>first of all i couldn’t</p><p>believe that i was on a tv show that was just like</p><p>because i i didn’t</p><p>i didn’t really</p><p>do much acting before that i acted on one</p><p>other sitcom that i got from doing</p><p>stand up comedy and</p><p>in 1994 i’d only been doing comedy</p><p>six years so</p><p>it’s like i was</p><p>still pretty raw as a comedian</p><p>and all of a</p><p>sudden i’m on this fucking tv show</p><p>i was like whoa</p><p>and then i’m on the show not only am i on</p><p>a tv show i’m on a tv show with phil hartman i was like</p><p>this is fucking nuts</p><p>you know and dave foley and andy deck i mean</p><p>pretty incredible</p><p>job but fear factor was just</p><p>about getting please</p><p>getting that paper</p><p>you know saying</p><p>she i know that</p><p>just like king moe says</p><p>get that paper</p><p>brittany murphy thoughts</p><p>you know what man i don’t have any thoughts</p><p>until i find out what killed her</p><p>you know i mean everybody</p><p>says that it’s drugs i don’t know it was drugs</p><p>i don’t think</p><p>the husband</p><p>doesn’t want to have an autopsy</p><p>kind of strange</p><p>you know really strange</p><p>you know especially</p><p>since obviously they were</p><p>gonna do one anyways</p><p>cause it’s kind of like why did she die yeah</p><p>unless you killed her</p><p>i mean why doesn’t</p><p>she why doesn’t</p><p>that guy want an autopsy if it was a murder case</p><p>then of course he</p><p>would want an autopsy right</p><p>you’d be like</p><p>how do you dive</p><p>natural the only time way you dive natural</p><p>causes when you’re 32 years old</p><p>is if you have like a serious health condition or</p><p>if you take something that kills you</p><p>which is pretty natural</p><p>i’ve read that a lot of her</p><p>close friends stopped hanging out with her when she got</p><p>married to that guy because of him</p><p>so there’s something with this guy</p><p>well i’ve had</p><p>some friends that have had some serious drug problems</p><p>in the past i had a friend that died from drugs</p><p>best friend</p><p>when i lived in new york</p><p>and he used to do heroin</p><p>he used to do</p><p>crack but mostly heroin</p><p>and he had like manageable problems with coke and</p><p>stuff like that</p><p>until he got on heroin and heroin</p><p>just fucking sealed his fate</p><p>that shit that shit just gets in your</p><p>blood it becomes a part of you</p><p>i mean i’ve seen people</p><p>jones and for co i’ve seen people</p><p>jones for a lot of shit but there’s something</p><p>really weird</p><p>about watching people</p><p>jones for heroin</p><p>i mean it’s like they need</p><p>water like they’re in the desert and they need water</p><p>and when people get involved in this and</p><p>apparently that’s what a lot of the hollywood</p><p>kids are doing a lot of them are doing fucking heroin</p><p>you know i don’t know what it’s all</p><p>about but it’s pretty spooky man</p><p>real alcoholics are pretty</p><p>spooky too like when you wake up in your</p><p>night the first thing you drink is a beer</p><p>yeah i’ve met a lot of alcoholics</p><p>i know a lot of alcoholics i know a lot of functioning</p><p>alcoholics and i know a lot of people that are just</p><p>you know just flat out</p><p>drunks especially</p><p>comics you know i’ve done a lot of</p><p>comics that have had real alcohol problems</p><p>because they get free booze and they’re out in clubs</p><p>every night and</p><p>you know alcohol</p><p>gives you a liquid courage and if you’re performing</p><p>every night</p><p>you might be</p><p>drinking every</p><p>night you’re</p><p>drinking every</p><p>night you’re</p><p>gonna have a fucking problem</p><p>eventually that shit’s</p><p>gonna grab you</p><p>conspiracy theories are only theories</p><p>until proven fact</p><p>yeah well they there are real conspiracies</p><p>most conspiracy theories are</p><p>stupid because people want to find the mystery shit</p><p>they want to find bigfoot</p><p>you know when meanwhile there’s a</p><p>bunch of real</p><p>live animals that are way more interesting than bigfoot</p><p>if bigfoot if we</p><p>found bigfoot</p><p>bigfoot would be in a fucking cage</p><p>right next to the</p><p>monkeys at the zoo</p><p>if we found them</p><p>if we really caught them they</p><p>would be like look there’s a big ape</p><p>you know we got the</p><p>short ape there’s a big there’s a big 10 foot tall ape</p><p>nobody would give a shit</p><p>but like killer</p><p>whales if killer</p><p>whales didn’t exist</p><p>and there was</p><p>some animal that people talked</p><p>about in legend that was as</p><p>smart as people</p><p>lived in the ocean</p><p>but breathed air</p><p>and had to come up for air</p><p>and doesn’t eat</p><p>human beings saves</p><p>human beings but kills</p><p>everything else including</p><p>great white sharks</p><p>a super intelligent being</p><p>that’s gigantic</p><p>and murderous and runs the</p><p>ocean people</p><p>would say fuck that that’s crazy</p><p>that’s not real that can’t be real</p><p>but it is real</p><p>we just know it’s real</p><p>and because the fact that</p><p>we know it’s real it’s not as interesting to people</p><p>people love mysteries we love discovering new shit</p><p>like the loch</p><p>ness monster</p><p>loch ness monster</p><p>doesn’t do shit it</p><p>doesn’t kill anybody it</p><p>doesn’t do anything</p><p>every now and then pokes its head out of the</p><p>water and everybody’s like</p><p>whoa i saw it everybody gets crazy</p><p>you know meanwhile there’s fucking crocodiles</p><p>that are real they’re alive</p><p>they’re gigantic they’re like fucking 30 feet long</p><p>they can hold</p><p>their breath</p><p>underwater for like</p><p>hours at a time</p><p>they don’t have to eat for a year</p><p>i mean crocodiles are fucking</p><p>crazy they’re</p><p>literally dinosaurs that are</p><p>still alive</p><p>today they were exactly the same way as they are now</p><p>hundreds of millions of years ago</p><p>nobody gives a fuck everybody’s looking for the loch</p><p>ness monster</p><p>you know there’s something that people</p><p>really really get into</p><p>when it comes to conspiracies</p><p>you know and</p><p>i’ve been guilty of it myself you know like</p><p>i used to really be into ufos and</p><p>like all kinds of</p><p>stuff like that</p><p>until i kind of realized</p><p>like what i’m into</p><p>is the unknown</p><p>what i’m into is like somehow or another is if</p><p>there’s something that’s unknown and</p><p>i figure it out</p><p>and i find it and i know it’s proven and true</p><p>then somehow or another you gain something from that</p><p>i guess you do to a certain extent if you can really</p><p>prove it but mostly what it is is this</p><p>weird desire that</p><p>human beings have</p><p>for things to</p><p>prove things</p><p>so it’s a very</p><p>weird thing conspiracy theories</p><p>like everybody’s always looking like for</p><p>all sorts of conspiracies that aren’t real</p><p>i know this also from</p><p>working where</p><p>i’ve had people like</p><p>like working with the ufc</p><p>like people are always talking</p><p>about the ufc wants this and</p><p>joe rogan said that because the</p><p>ufc told them saying</p><p>the ufc never tells me to say shit</p><p>they literally</p><p>never tell me what to say</p><p>my job’s the craziest job ever i’m</p><p>literally the guy who</p><p>speaks for this</p><p>multi 100 million dollar</p><p>sports company</p><p>and nobody tells me what to do</p><p>i show up and they tell me what the fights are</p><p>and i just do it i try to be professional as possible</p><p>i try not to</p><p>swear occasionally you know i’ll slip up</p><p>with that but i’m trying not to swear</p><p>but all i’m trying to do is do commentary</p><p>on the fights</p><p>the only thing they’ve ever told me what to do is</p><p>when they were trying to buy pride</p><p>and pride fucked them over and there’s this big</p><p>thing going on back and forth they said</p><p>please don’t mention</p><p>pride by name you can mention all the fighters</p><p>but don’t mention</p><p>pride by name because they</p><p>didn’t want to give advertisement to that organization</p><p>which totally is totally</p><p>legitimate totally makes</p><p>sense to me you know</p><p>but they don’t tell me like hype this guy up talk</p><p>about that guy don’t don’t mention this guy’s name</p><p>and make sure you</p><p>tell everybody this guy this is the guy we want to win</p><p>there’s none of that there’s</p><p>none of that zero so</p><p>i know that’s a conspiracy that people</p><p>think is real</p><p>that’s not real i know i know there’s a</p><p>there’s a lot of</p><p>other ones that people</p><p>think it’s real</p><p>but there’s ones that are real you know</p><p>chemtrails are the ones that i’ve recently turned on</p><p>yes that whole</p><p>thing you talked</p><p>about the you know</p><p>the hair yeah there’s a lot of people that</p><p>would look at those</p><p>things in the</p><p>sky and go what is that what are they doing</p><p>well i talked to a</p><p>pilot and i</p><p>asked a pilot</p><p>about it and he gave me a very simple explanation</p><p>about how water</p><p>going through those jets</p><p>those jet engines at a certain altitude with certain</p><p>you know weather</p><p>conditions certain moisture</p><p>they have like</p><p>humidity yeah</p><p>midi because</p><p>barometric pressure</p><p>there’s all sorts of factors but if it’s the</p><p>right factors is</p><p>enough enough</p><p>water in it</p><p>it’ll create</p><p>clouds like</p><p>literally jets create clouds</p><p>saw these people like man they’re making clouds</p><p>well that’s what happens</p><p>when jets fly through the fucking air</p><p>like the idea that they would be</p><p>spraying cities poisoning people</p><p>don’t they live on the ground too</p><p>they’re spraying themselves</p><p>spraying their families and stuff</p><p>they have shots</p><p>they’re taking shots so that they don’t get not to say</p><p>that they don’t</p><p>experiment with weather</p><p>but the majority of the lines you see in the air</p><p>definitely there’s</p><p>legitimate concerns</p><p>about like that harp program</p><p>whether they’re fucking</p><p>doing things to the</p><p>ionosphere and</p><p>for sure they’re</p><p>experimenting with weather</p><p>because we know that</p><p>china has successfully created rain</p><p>you know they’ve done</p><p>successful weather operations</p><p>so there are</p><p>absolutely real conspiracies but there’s a lot of</p><p>goofy ones man</p><p>and the problem is</p><p>it’s very difficult for people</p><p>to once they</p><p>have made a decision</p><p>about want something like jfk</p><p>oswald acted</p><p>alone and people just get that in</p><p>their head oswald acted alone</p><p>it’s very difficult for them to look at</p><p>contrary evidence and take it into consideration</p><p>it’s almost like there’s a competition</p><p>going on they want</p><p>their side to be right</p><p>and people have</p><p>a real hard time and our friend that we were talking</p><p>about the chemtrails</p><p>didn’t want to believe</p><p>we’re having an argument with him</p><p>while saying listen man</p><p>you don’t know</p><p>you say the research that i’ve done i’m like</p><p>you’re watching youtube clips</p><p>is that what</p><p>constitutes research these days</p><p>you know and</p><p>he was convinced that chemtrails were real and i’m like</p><p>they make no sense</p><p>and the other</p><p>thing the pilot</p><p>had that was a good</p><p>point was like he’s a</p><p>pilot he’s like</p><p>believe me man</p><p>pilots would be talking</p><p>about it right it</p><p>wouldn’t be like something that’s that easy you</p><p>could just hire</p><p>god to fucking spray</p><p>every city in the world</p><p>every day of the week and they’re</p><p>gonna keep their</p><p>mouth shut plus</p><p>all these reporters that are like getting pissed</p><p>off at like oil businesses for ripping off customers</p><p>what if that you’re getting</p><p>sprayed with poison when that reporter be crazy</p><p>it research</p><p>reporter you</p><p>know it’s silly</p><p>it’s silly that’s i think chem</p><p>chills are a silly one</p><p>not not to say they haven’t</p><p>sprayed people before</p><p>not to say that</p><p>there haven’t been</p><p>some experiments</p><p>where they’ve</p><p>sprayed you know certain</p><p>bacteria or certain colds</p><p>you know over</p><p>an area to see if they can get people sick</p><p>why not we know there’s a</p><p>thing called operation midnight climax</p><p>that in the 1950s</p><p>the cia ran</p><p>fucking brothels</p><p>they ran whorehouses</p><p>in new york and san francisco</p><p>and they ran</p><p>these things</p><p>and what they</p><p>did was they ran the whorehouse so they can do lsd</p><p>experiments on people</p><p>and so they unknowingly gave</p><p>these johns acid</p><p>so these poor guys</p><p>would go in there just</p><p>to try to give</p><p>their hard earned money</p><p>they probably</p><p>didn’t even have much</p><p>pay just whatever they had to get</p><p>their dick sucked</p><p>and they’re getting dosed with acid</p><p>freaking the fuck out probably already feeling</p><p>super guilty</p><p>probably half of them were</p><p>married and they just cheating</p><p>otherwise and they felt guilty</p><p>about that and then they’re dosed up with acid and</p><p>dealing with the reality of the situation</p><p>we know the cia</p><p>did that this is information</p><p>that was released in the freedom information act</p><p>you look it</p><p>up google it it’s pretty interesting it’s called</p><p>operation midnight climax</p><p>and it’s just one of</p><p>many experiments that the cia did</p><p>unknowingly</p><p>on american</p><p>citizens taxpayers</p><p>and they’ve done it forever</p><p>and that’s how they do business</p><p>and guarantee that if they did this back in nineteen</p><p>fifty they’re doing something like it now</p><p>it’s not like they</p><p>changed it’s not like</p><p>these all these like conspiracies all</p><p>these things that the government’s done like</p><p>operation northwoods</p><p>operation northwoods was the</p><p>thing that they proposed in the 1960s</p><p>1962 and this was signed</p><p>by the joint chiefs of</p><p>staff and then</p><p>vetoed by kennedy</p><p>what it was was they were trying to get people</p><p>enthusiastic</p><p>about a war</p><p>against cuba</p><p>so they were</p><p>planning on</p><p>blowing up american</p><p>ships like real</p><p>ships they were</p><p>gonna have mock</p><p>plane crashes</p><p>where they were</p><p>gonna blow up</p><p>drones in the air</p><p>and they were</p><p>gonna blame it on the cubans</p><p>they were gonna say that all</p><p>these people died and they were</p><p>gonna take the passengers and</p><p>put them under</p><p>false aliases and have</p><p>pilots under</p><p>false aliases and</p><p>that pilot was</p><p>gonna give may days and say you got shot down</p><p>look that up too it’s</p><p>really interesting it’s called operation northwoods</p><p>and this was a real</p><p>plan that they had</p><p>drafted in the 1960s that</p><p>the department of defense</p><p>drafted up and</p><p>the joint chiefs of</p><p>staff signed</p><p>and kennedy</p><p>vetoed it and</p><p>kenny was like you guys are fucking</p><p>crazy like what are you doing</p><p>like you’re gonna</p><p>fake attacks in</p><p>order to get people to want to go to war with cuba</p><p>and that’s probably one of the reasons why i</p><p>killed kennedy</p><p>you know who knows but</p><p>these are real conspiracies they’re real we know that</p><p>things are conspired on</p><p>the real problem</p><p>with conspiracies is nobody wants to look stupid</p><p>and when you</p><p>say that you believe something like you believe in</p><p>alien abduction or you believe</p><p>the government killed kennedy</p><p>or you believe</p><p>anything nutty we didn’t land on the moon</p><p>when you say you don’t believe nutty things</p><p>people just automatically</p><p>label you a kook</p><p>instead of looking at it and going</p><p>okay what has the government done they really have</p><p>dosed people with lsd with</p><p>other knowledge</p><p>they really set up</p><p>whorehouses</p><p>the cia did this</p><p>really they really were faking attack they were</p><p>planning on faking attacks</p><p>on american civilians</p><p>and blowing up american</p><p>ships and blaming on the cubans</p><p>they really were</p><p>gonna attack guantanamo bay</p><p>attack soldiers they were</p><p>gonna fuckin</p><p>shoot mortars</p><p>into guantanamo bay</p><p>they’re gonna kill american soldiers and</p><p>blame it on the cubans</p><p>and get us to attack them that’s all real</p><p>so you gotta keep your eyes open you</p><p>gotta keep your mind open</p><p>and the problem with conspiracy theories is</p><p>people choose one side or the</p><p>other either there’s a conspiracy which</p><p>are ridiculous</p><p>and i’m not believing this</p><p>or they go well</p><p>you know they</p><p>are the conspiracies are real and it’s usually not that</p><p>black or white it usually takes a lot of looking at</p><p>before you get to the real truth and</p><p>and the real</p><p>truth is fucking</p><p>sketchy i mean</p><p>it’s real hard to have information</p><p>about a lot of</p><p>things in this world</p><p>as much information as we have on the internet</p><p>there’s still a lot of shit</p><p>that you don’t get</p><p>like bill maher twittered something</p><p>today that i was like</p><p>this guy doesn’t even</p><p>he’s incorrectly this has all been disproven</p><p>he twittered something</p><p>an anti christian thing</p><p>about mithra</p><p>and you know i was like how</p><p>funny is this bill</p><p>maher isn’t even doing his research</p><p>like he’s twittering something that</p><p>everybody says</p><p>about mithra</p><p>but it was disproven</p><p>he gets his news by the</p><p>paper here it is</p><p>mithra born 12 25 12 disciples</p><p>died rose on may on the</p><p>third day performed miracles</p><p>known as a lamb</p><p>the way the</p><p>truth the light 600 years before</p><p>jesus christ</p><p>i see what his</p><p>point is his</p><p>point is what</p><p>he’s trying to say it’s like hey there was no you know</p><p>there wasn’t</p><p>you know there was no</p><p>jesus christ that this this</p><p>fable this myth has existed in many different forms</p><p>but the mithra</p><p>thing is totally</p><p>wrong because the mithra thing if you just google</p><p>zeitgeist the movie debunked this guy gets really into</p><p>the mythology behind</p><p>you know in zeitgeist they talk about how</p><p>jesus really is the basically the same</p><p>story as all these different stories before</p><p>and one of them was mithra and you know so</p><p>so bill maher quoting on his thing that</p><p>mithra was born</p><p>12 25 had 12 disciples well if you go to this</p><p>other site that that this guy</p><p>seems like a</p><p>really intelligent guy i don’t know if he’s right</p><p>but he’s talking</p><p>about anybody’s researched it at</p><p>least talking</p><p>about the miss and alleges of mithra are</p><p>numerous in account and spans several different</p><p>cultures he says i ran into a</p><p>brick wall of sorts trying to</p><p>track down any</p><p>of this information i cannot find any evidence</p><p>of his birthday being december 25th</p><p>the only dates that</p><p>correspond to him</p><p>are his festival on</p><p>october 8th and another on september 12th through 16th</p><p>a cattle pairing festival</p><p>october 12th through 16th</p><p>there’s absolutely this important part</p><p>there’s absolutely no evidence anywhere that</p><p>he had 12 disciples or 12 of anything for that matter</p><p>no mithras scholars</p><p>seem to know about it</p><p>he was not born to a virgin</p><p>but rather out of</p><p>solid rock so</p><p>i mean it’s it’s really</p><p>really interesting</p><p>people like</p><p>you know there’s not</p><p>there’s not</p><p>enough research of information people don’t really look</p><p>these things up</p><p>they they quote</p><p>a little bit</p><p>of something they saw on the internet and that’s</p><p>the problem is there’s no there’s no way you can have</p><p>access to everything there’s no way you can know</p><p>about everything it’s impossible</p><p>so there’s gonna be a lot of shit that you’re talking</p><p>about you form an opinion</p><p>on when you’re really just talking out of your ass</p><p>and that’s where</p><p>most people are when it comes to conspiracy theories</p><p>with everything with everything</p><p>people talk out of</p><p>their ass and</p><p>because people have</p><p>a huge vested interest in being correct</p><p>about things</p><p>you know people</p><p>hate being foolish they hate being the dumb one</p><p>they hate being uninformed</p><p>you know people love correcting people</p><p>they love like</p><p>your is you apostrophe</p><p>re as in you</p><p>are you know okay</p><p>you’re a fucking</p><p>awesome dude because you spotted that guy</p><p>meanwhile i do that all the time</p><p>that’s kind of</p><p>being an asshole</p><p>that’s kind of why i like the iphone how it always</p><p>fucks up my texting and</p><p>stuff like that</p><p>because then people are</p><p>starting to slowly less do it to me now because</p><p>everyone’s doing it right</p><p>conspiracy theory with jesse ventura i haven’t seen it</p><p>i haven’t even</p><p>brian didn’t like it it was alright</p><p>i don’t know</p><p>jesse ventura is one of those dudes that thinks</p><p>he’s a navy seal or he’s a former navy seal</p><p>that he has</p><p>inside information</p><p>i’m a former neighbor seal</p><p>that opi and anthony</p><p>things just really got to me on both sides yeah</p><p>yeah you were upset at jim norton you</p><p>think i was on both sides that got me</p><p>upset i thought they both handle it</p><p>it’s hard having a fucking intelligent conversation at</p><p>seven o’clock in the morning god damn</p><p>it you know whenever i do</p><p>those morning radio shows i’m always like</p><p>like what am i even talking</p><p>about i’m always half out of it</p><p>mumbling and shit</p><p>it’s hard to wake the fuck up it’s like</p><p>you have to drink coffee if you’re gonna do one of</p><p>those morning radio shows you really can’t go in sober</p><p>you gotta have a</p><p>a little bit of that and a cup of coffee</p><p>mothra or rodan</p><p>i was more of</p><p>a rodan fan i thought mothra was kind of a faggy</p><p>monster a big</p><p>stupid moth that’s a dumbass</p><p>yeah i mean why not have a giant roach people hate</p><p>roaches roaches are scary as fuck</p><p>why do you want to have a

thirty</p><p>merry christmas merry christmas to all of you</p><p>all right what else i have a fan of ji kun do</p><p>i’m a fan of bruce lee</p><p>i’m a fan of his idea his idea to add all the mar</p><p>i mean he was really the original mixed martial artist</p><p>when i started out as a kid</p><p>i did karate</p><p>and then i started doing taekwondo</p><p>and each one of those</p><p>disciplines karate and taekwondo</p><p>wanted you to think that</p><p>their style was the best</p><p>style the end all be all style karate</p><p>they didn’t want you training with taekwondo people</p><p>taekwondo people they didn’t want you</p><p>training with karate people</p><p>you know judo people didn’t want you</p><p>training with kung</p><p>fu people it</p><p>was like everybody was like really attached to</p><p>their style</p><p>so really bruce lee and she</p><p>could know that’s the original</p><p>mixed martial art</p><p>that’s the original guy to look at</p><p>all the different</p><p>systems and take what’s useful</p><p>from each one</p><p>bruce lee was a</p><p>he was a genius when it came to martial</p><p>arts way way way</p><p>ahead of his time</p><p>i like this because the questions are slower</p><p>yeah twitterism</p><p>yeah this is pretty cool</p><p>this is the</p><p>first time i’ve done this</p><p>like i said i’m</p><p>always threatening to do this but we’re doing it now</p><p>you motherfuckers</p><p>subverter talk more</p><p>about hunter s thompson</p><p>i love that feeling</p><p>where the truth just hits you</p><p>anders thompson was a fucking</p><p>genius he was</p><p>a he was one of the very few dudes that really captured</p><p>the the angst of the sixties and the</p><p>seventies the nixon era and</p><p>you know the the</p><p>he was a part of the acid culture of the sixties</p><p>he was a part of the</p><p>culture like the the san francisco hate</p><p>ashbury movement where it’s like</p><p>everybody was doing acid all</p><p>these people were like a good acid</p><p>so all these people were like really</p><p>coming together and they were really like releasing</p><p>their egos and their self</p><p>identity and kind of like</p><p>losing themselves in a</p><p>movement and then this this hippie movement of the 60s</p><p>which seems like really</p><p>stupid now we look at it and it’s like god look at</p><p>these idiots with</p><p>their long hair and</p><p>their stupid</p><p>clothes but</p><p>what they were doing was they were they were</p><p>radically departing from the previous culture</p><p>i mean the difference</p><p>between the 50s and the 60s is fucking gigantic</p><p>the difference between like</p><p>buddy holly and jimi hendrix</p><p>is like you</p><p>know i mean</p><p>that’s another</p><p>world i mean</p><p>that’s not like a 10 year</p><p>evolution that’s an</p><p>evolution that</p><p>would have taken hundreds or</p><p>maybe not even gotten there at all</p><p>it’s almost like</p><p>they needed the drugs</p><p>they needed acid and mushrooms and pot and peyote</p><p>they needed all that shit and heroin</p><p>to launch themselves</p><p>like from one</p><p>one frequency</p><p>to the next one and the 60s were a totally different</p><p>frequency when it came to</p><p>music when it came to</p><p>culture and</p><p>that set the stage</p><p>for what happened in the 70s and the 80s</p><p>and with the really crappy</p><p>music that came from the 80s and</p><p>some of it in the 70s but</p><p>definitely the 80s</p><p>what that is</p><p>is like this consciousness this incredible</p><p>music where</p><p>these people were</p><p>really like</p><p>tuning into the art of it</p><p>in the 60s like</p><p>more 60s music is like</p><p>classic fucking shit</p><p>you know that you hear</p><p>today and you go god</p><p>damn that’s a good song</p><p>it’s like they</p><p>really figured out how to tap into the real shit</p><p>know the real energy that makes</p><p>that that makes art</p><p>interesting that makes art</p><p>resonate and i</p><p>think they did it with drugs</p><p>and i think that</p><p>the the the decline</p><p>in the 70s and certainly in the 80s</p><p>was because this there was like a void left where</p><p>the this this this</p><p>tuning in this</p><p>connection to the real pure source was gone</p><p>you know it’s like whatever they had hit the whatever</p><p>frequency they had nailed in the sixties</p><p>the echoes of it had died down by the time the</p><p>eighties hit</p><p>you know i think</p><p>hunter s thompson had a fucking brilliant</p><p>story that he</p><p>wrote a brilliant like</p><p>piece that he wrote</p><p>the wave the talking about how the 60s it’s like</p><p>was like like a wave and that</p><p>when the 60s ended you could see where the wave</p><p>broke back like where</p><p>they thought that people</p><p>could be like where they saw the true potential</p><p>of humanity of the united states of</p><p>the human race in general</p><p>and you saw it just roll back and go back to</p><p>where it was</p><p>and that’s what</p><p>it was between the 60s and the 70s you know</p><p>and he nailed that shit better than anybody</p><p>hunter s thompson’s words today</p><p>still when you look at like</p><p>especially what was</p><p>going on with the bush administration and</p><p>it was just like the</p><p>clearest evidence ever</p><p>of massive amounts of corruption in government where</p><p>you know it’s</p><p>mean they got us into a war that made no fucking</p><p>sense i mean</p><p>and it was obvious like across the</p><p>board the internet</p><p>was you know up information was being</p><p>you know very easily</p><p>transferred back and forth and yet it</p><p>still managed to go through and</p><p>the way he felt</p><p>about the nixon administration</p><p>i mean you literally</p><p>could substitute nixon</p><p>for bush and then insert most of the shit that he said</p><p>into you know</p><p>the early 2000s</p><p>raw sound does it sound shitty</p><p>what do what do you think</p><p>about doing a radio show of my own i would love to do a</p><p>radio show the only problem is i don’t</p><p>think anybody wants to pay me to do a radio show</p><p>i might have to do a radio show like this because</p><p>right now i mean adam corolla has a</p><p>sweet setup where he does</p><p>podcasts and he gets a lot of people to listen to it</p><p>and that might be the way to go because</p><p>satellite radio is struggling financially and</p><p>you know some people make money from it like</p><p>you know obviously howard</p><p>stern makes a lot of money from it</p><p>and i think opie and anthony make good</p><p>money from it but</p><p>they don’t want to pay anybody else they’re not making</p><p>money so they don’t have the money to give out</p><p>so i think if i’m gonna do</p><p>any sort of</p><p>turn that out</p><p>does it work</p><p>is that any better is that louder anybody</p><p>if i’m gonna do any sort of a</p><p>podcast or something like that it’s</p><p>gonna be this it’s gonna be like this</p><p>and i saw soulja boy do it’s awesome</p><p>yeah remember that video soldier boy the guy in the</p><p>background with his gold necklace yeah yeah man</p><p>soulja boy is fascinating to me</p><p>if you don’t know soulja boy</p><p>he’s a rapper</p><p>a very young fellow who’s</p><p>wildly successful</p><p>made millions and millions of dogs</p><p>and he’s tattooed</p><p>his entire body in like the course of like a few months</p><p>like all the way up his neck and his face is</p><p>tattooed and</p><p>his sleeves and his</p><p>chest and everything</p><p>he just tattooed the fuck out of</p><p>himself like writing and shit like really bad artwork</p><p>really really interesting</p><p>i guess he likes it just went</p><p>crazy how many times a day do you</p><p>think he makes it rain</p><p>makes it rain</p><p>okay does it all day he’s a</p><p>small time multi</p><p>multi millionaire and he’s only like 19 years old</p><p>and when he became rich and</p><p>famous he was only like 17</p><p>it’s he’s an interesting</p><p>little study</p><p>right

yeah</p><p>this is the best</p><p>phone of all time the iphone ladies and gentlemen</p><p>you really can’t fuck with it</p><p>we’ve tried</p><p>every other phone</p><p>i’m i’m a technical fucking geek i’m a nerd i love</p><p>phones but there’s no phone</p><p>that can fuck with the iphone there’s no</p><p>network that can fuck with verizon</p><p>though and that’s the real goddamn problem</p><p>so i don’t use the iphone as my main phone</p><p>i mostly use the iphone these days as like an internet</p><p>device i use it as like a little</p><p>tin a mini laptop and shit</p><p>but from my phone</p><p>i use one of these blackberry storm 2s</p><p>which as a phone is not nearly as good it’s kind of</p><p>funky the typing on it’s not bad the</p><p>storm 2 is definitely better than the storm one</p><p>but man fucking</p><p>the network is a hundred times better</p><p>the verizon network</p><p>when i had at amp t like when i</p><p>would drive to jiu jitsu at night i drive the same way</p><p>and i gotta go through hollywood</p><p>and my shit would drop out</p><p>three times on the way to hollywood</p><p>three fucking times in 25 30 miles whatever it is</p><p>three times the shit would drop out with verizon</p><p>straight through</p><p>never drops out doesn’t drop out anywhere</p><p>i get better reception inside</p><p>buildings it’s just like better it’s just better</p><p>reception period</p><p>and it’s not like a little bit better it’s like</p><p>several times better</p><p>you know it’s like</p><p>the amount of drop offs that i get with verizon are so</p><p>tiny in comparison to the at amp</p><p>t ones att just</p><p>they just got</p><p>fucked by that iphone that iphone just overloaded</p><p>their network overload the shit out of it</p><p>and the the</p><p>things just they just</p><p>dropped you</p><p>know what though</p><p>something that at amp</p><p>t has been pushing lately but i and i agree</p><p>is not being able to use your data network</p><p>while you’re on the phone</p><p>verizon you can’t</p><p>when you’re on the</p><p>phone you can’t</p><p>check your email get new</p><p>email or go on twitter and get new twitters</p><p>while you’re on the phone</p><p>you can’t use your data and your</p><p>phone together at the same time</p><p>did you know that</p><p>no i didn’t know that that’s huge</p><p>that’s that’s bigger than</p><p>a drop call once in a</p><p>while i think</p><p>yeah that is bigger</p><p>you’d have no idea what i’m talking</p><p>no data and not be able to use data</p><p>yeah because</p><p>what if you’re on the</p><p>phone you can’t get you can’t get</p><p>emails up while you’re on the</p><p>phone gay that’s</p><p>and verizon can’t fix that with</p><p>their current network</p><p>yeah that’s gay</p><p>that’s why they had that thing</p><p>where they show that you can get on the</p><p>phone and go</p><p>on the apps look</p><p>but that sucks</p><p>it does suck but

years old</p><p>i used to want to be a comic book artist red dragons</p><p>indeed red dragons</p><p>have you seen the new preview for the new karate kid</p><p>movie no i have not it’s</p><p>black karate kid they’re redoing the karate</p><p>kid but the kids</p><p>black and i think it’s will smith’s kid yeah it’s will</p><p>smith’s kid</p><p>that’s awesome</p><p>karate is making a comeback man leona machida</p><p>yeah don’t fuck with the karate kid man</p><p>marijuana would bring</p><p>california out of bankruptcy</p><p>do you really think so</p><p>don’t fuck with the karate</p><p>kid you say that like the karate</p><p>kid was like some awesome movie dude it’s a</p><p>childhood memory</p><p>they fucked up gi joe they fucked up</p><p>transformers</p><p>was gi joe yes and it was the</p><p>worst movie ever no but in a main before that movie</p><p>what was it before</p><p>it was a cartoon</p><p>series cartoons</p><p>right they didn’t really fuck</p><p>it up though they just made a bad move it was horrible</p><p>no it was awful</p><p>how fast could bj penn beat aoki</p><p>man i don’t know if there’s anybody at</p><p>155 they can fuck with bj penn now</p><p>now that bj’s taking everything like</p><p>super serious and training like a dedicated athlete</p><p>he’s a destroyer</p><p>at 155 there’s nobody that’s even</p><p>close to him</p><p>i mean no one’s even in his frequency</p><p>he’s in the matrix right now</p><p>you know there’s certain dudes that get to a certain</p><p>point with confidence with</p><p>experience with</p><p>skill technique and then you add discipline</p><p>and conditioning to that</p><p>they get to this</p><p>crazy place that very few people can reach this</p><p>crazy high air</p><p>and that’s where bj penn’s at right now right</p><p>anderson silva 2 he’s another one</p><p>he’s just in this air</p><p>that nobody can fuck with that that’s what’s good</p><p>about the ultimate</p><p>fighter though</p><p>cause it’s kind of bringing new people in it</p><p>yeah unknown people you know yeah</p><p>but you know there’s such a gigantic gap between</p><p>these guys that have fought in these</p><p>small organizations</p><p>and the guys at the top of the food chain</p><p>and you see like with phaidor</p><p>million inko like it takes so many</p><p>years for a guy to become like the phaidor of today</p><p>and anderson</p><p>silva is a perfect example that like anderson</p><p>silva when he’s</p><p>fighting in pride</p><p>i mean he got submitted by rio chona</p><p>takasi got him in a</p><p>mounted triangle this dude dudes were</p><p>beating him dudes are submitting him</p><p>you know i mean he knocked out</p><p>carlos dune but he just didn’t look like the anderson</p><p>silva of today</p><p>and he had to have</p><p>those fights he had to have those losses he had to</p><p>get better he had to rise</p><p>he had to really get his shit together really</p><p>focus on his jiu jitsu</p><p>and really become</p><p>black belts on the ground so he had this full package</p><p>so that he was totally confident and thrown his</p><p>strikes because he didn’t</p><p>worry at all about being on the ground</p><p>and that’s the anderson</p><p>sylvia we have now this like</p><p>fully complete</p><p>fighter but</p><p>we had to see him evolve it took a long time for him</p><p>to become the guy that he is today</p><p>that’s what you</p><p>know it takes a long time to make like a full complete</p><p>mixed martial artist</p><p>and these guys</p><p>today i mean</p><p>the competition is staggering there’s so many</p><p>fighters now</p><p>i mean there’s so many different organizations so many</p><p>fighters and so many guys are good</p><p>it’s so hard to advance and</p><p>to make it to the very top of the food</p><p>chain in today’s</p><p>mixed martial arts world</p><p>i mean it’s so much fucking competitions</p><p>it’s amazing i mean when i first</p><p>started doing the</p><p>ufc i first</p><p>started working for them in 1997</p><p>and it was tiny</p><p>i we did the</p><p>first show in dothan alabama</p><p>there was nobody there</p><p>i mean it was like a</p><p>thousand people or something like that and it’s because</p><p>the tickets were really cheap</p><p>and because people came to see a fucking</p><p>freak show there</p><p>was nobody there that knew when someone was passing the</p><p>guard and nobody passed the</p><p>guard back then either</p><p>you know nobody knew what the fuck was</p><p>going on nobody knew</p><p>know that leg kicks were you know</p><p>really bad for you they’d fuck your legs up people</p><p>would see a guy</p><p>kicking somebody in the legs like why is he doing that</p><p>you know like</p><p>back then you were allowed to</p><p>punch people</p><p>in the balls you know you’re allowed to pull hair</p><p>you’re allowed to pull on</p><p>clothes crazy the</p><p>early days to what it is now</p><p>it’s really fucking amazing</p><p>your face is amazing your fucking face is amazing</p><p>don frye retired from mma</p><p>don frye is a fucking real man that belongs in a</p><p>movie they should make a movie at a don frye</p><p>this fucking mustache alone is epic</p><p>don fry is a real man</p><p>ladies and gentlemen a real</p><p>goddamn man</p><p>372 viewers i pay you this shit’s fine</p><p>they’re saying the</p><p>sounds good but i think this</p><p>sounds better when we’ve got close</p><p>just i think this needs to</p><p>point towards your face oh</p><p>really have it towards your fucking face your face is</p><p>pointing towards your face</p><p>where to float com</p><p>is that our website where to float com</p><p>if you google</p><p>where to float</p><p>i know you can if you want to know</p><p>about floatation tanks these are</p><p>what this guy’s asking</p><p>about is a thing</p><p>called a sensory deprivation tank and what that is is</p><p>there’s a tank filled with</p><p>water if you</p><p>haven’t heard</p><p>about this before</p><p>you could google it and there’s this</p><p>videos of that we made that you</p><p>could find online that</p><p>brian made if you see any of my</p><p>videos from my website</p><p>and you go wow</p><p>those are fucking really cool creative</p><p>this guy makes up</p><p>that’s brian raikel he’s a fucking</p><p>video genius bitches recognized</p><p>and we made a really cool one</p><p>up that explains the isolation tank but what it is is</p><p>a tank of water that has</p><p>800 pounds of salt in it and the</p><p>water is heated</p><p>to the same temperature of your skin and</p><p>and the salt makes you very</p><p>buoyant so you lie in the</p><p>water and you</p><p>float and the fact that the</p><p>water is heated to the same temperature as your skin</p><p>you don’t feel it</p><p>so you’re floating in this</p><p>water you don’t</p><p>really feel the</p><p>water anymore because the</p><p>water in the air and</p><p>everything it all feels like one</p><p>thing it feels like you’re weightless</p><p>and you’re flying through space</p><p>and when you</p><p>close the door on this</p><p>thing you’re in</p><p>total darkness you’re in</p><p>total silence your ears are</p><p>underwater you don’t hear anything</p><p>and in the absence of any sensory</p><p>input you don’t hear anything</p><p>you don’t feel anything</p><p>you don’t see anything and the absence of all that</p><p>your mind has no distractions and your</p><p>brain becomes</p><p>supercharged and you</p><p>start having</p><p>vivid hallucinations and you start</p><p>like it’s really like a</p><p>psychedelic</p><p>experience you really start</p><p>you start like really like</p><p>researching like</p><p>your thoughts and getting to the</p><p>heart of who you are</p><p>separate from culture</p><p>separate from language separate from</p><p>your experiences</p><p>you get down to who you are</p><p>and then when you get to that</p><p>once you get past that is when the hallucinations start</p><p>because you</p><p>kinda cease to</p><p>exist as you define</p><p>yourself as who you are by your job the car you</p><p>drive the house</p><p>you live in the family you have the friends you keep</p><p>you define yourself by all</p><p>these different</p><p>things but when you’re in that tank all</p><p>those things are gone</p><p>there’s no outside world</p><p>there’s just</p><p>the mind it’s the mind untethered from the body</p><p>and when you’re in that state</p><p>you you kind of transverse</p><p>you kind of travel</p><p>between this consciousness and this reality</p><p>to another one you you</p><p>travel outside of this</p><p>world and and you</p><p>travel to this the</p><p>world of the deep</p><p>inner thoughts</p><p>you know the deep inner</p><p>connection between whatever the fuck this life is</p><p>you know the</p><p>connection between your consciousness</p><p>and the universe and it gets pretty fucking crazy</p><p>i have one of</p><p>those bitches in my basement i do it all the time</p><p>is it like a really</p><p>great power nap no it’s not like a really</p><p>great power nap it’s like a really</p><p>great mushroom trip</p><p>but the best thing</p><p>about it is you could end it at any</p><p>second anytime</p><p>you want to end it you just open up the door and your</p><p>stone colds over</p><p>so you can be in this deep</p><p>trance where you’re</p><p>i’ve had really</p><p>vivid vivid</p><p>hallucinations in there</p><p>where i felt like i was</p><p>like i traveled down to the very atomic</p><p>structure of</p><p>human beings</p><p>and gotten through the lowest</p><p>point and at that lowest point</p><p>as you get lower and</p><p>lower and deeper and deeper</p><p>it became like another universe</p><p>and the idea</p><p>in my head was that</p><p>all of this life that we see</p><p>you know subatomic particles to atoms to all these</p><p>like this progression</p><p>of things getting bigger and bigger and bigger</p><p>to humans to</p><p>countries to continents to planets to planets to</p><p>galaxies to galaxies</p><p>to you know</p><p>to universes and then all</p><p>this idea that</p><p>things just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger</p><p>well it works infinitely in both directions and</p><p>it was like i was</p><p>taken on a trip through</p><p>the whole experience from subatomic</p><p>to atomic to planets to flying through space to</p><p>space being</p><p>subatomic to</p><p>you know this new atom</p><p>that exists</p><p>and it’s a part of new organisms that</p><p>exist that a part of a new ecosystem that</p><p>exists that’s a part of a new planet</p><p>that’s a part of a new galaxy that’s part of a new</p><p>universe and</p><p>it goes on and on and on and i went through this</p><p>whole thing like over and over again</p><p>like multiple times and it was really fucking crazy</p><p>it was very very vivid and very realistic</p><p>and very life</p><p>changing the</p><p>whole thing is like</p><p>doing it a lot</p><p>you got to do the isolation tank a lot and you got to</p><p>learn to relax</p><p>and you gotta</p><p>learn to give in to the</p><p>experience because so many times when you’re in there</p><p>you’re thinking</p><p>about things and you’re</p><p>worrying about</p><p>things and you think</p><p>about your bills and your bullshit and you know i’m</p><p>gonna lose weight and</p><p>i gotta do this and</p><p>all those thoughts</p><p>distract you</p><p>it’s like the</p><p>state of mind that you can achieve in this isolation</p><p>tank it’s very similar to the</p><p>state of mind</p><p>that you can achieve</p><p>from you know</p><p>when monks go through</p><p>decades and decades of intense</p><p>meditation like</p><p>they achieve the same type of</p><p>state of mind</p><p>but you’re achieving it like with no discipline</p><p>so it’s hard to manage sometimes</p><p>but if you can</p><p>learn to manage it and if you</p><p>learn to go in with the correct</p><p>thought process and</p><p>to approach it the</p><p>right way and maybe</p><p>meditate before</p><p>you go in and calm yourself and put yourself in a good</p><p>state of mind</p><p>and know how to</p><p>navigate the</p><p>waters of these</p><p>experiences</p><p>then you can get to the</p><p>crazy part the</p><p>crazy part is hard to get to but it’s there</p><p>we should ask them which</p><p>sounds better and</p><p>switch between the three</p><p>okay okay what</p><p>sounds better</p><p>when there’s</p><p>three settings to this

like the fire guns in the air and get crazy well</p><p>i can handle it and they</p><p>drink and drive and</p><p>it’s very dangerous i got some hilarious</p><p>video of last new year’s there of</p><p>these old ladies dancing and</p><p>stuff oh yeah that’s</p><p>right video i wish we had that</p><p>right now we</p><p>could stream it we</p><p>could stream it</p><p>right yeah i’m</p><p>gonna upgrade this internet</p><p>weak ass internet i got here</p><p>cause then once i’ll</p><p>bring my laptop</p><p>and then i’ll</p><p>start to be able to just send you</p><p>videos and stuff like that</p><p>then we’re gonna set it up like a goddamn fucking tv</p><p>studio in here bitches</p><p>358 viewers</p><p>i’m losing viewers i must be boring fuck</p><p>answer some questions here</p><p>at a late show in vegas</p><p>i don’t think so man late shows in</p><p>vegas are a nightmare</p><p>house of blues pretty big already yeah the</p><p>house of blues is a good size anyway</p><p>i won’t the one</p><p>thing that i won’t do anymore is that</p><p>i used to do the</p><p>house of blues and i had</p><p>most of the</p><p>people were seated but then there was always</p><p>standing room in the back</p><p>the problem is that</p><p>standing room by the bar just becomes a bar people just</p><p>start talking and it becomes a fucking nightmare</p><p>so no more shows</p><p>i’m not doing any more shows ever anywhere</p><p>where people have to</p><p>stand out while they’re</p><p>watching the show</p><p>and the reason being is</p><p>because i want to see doug stanhope when he was in la</p><p>and we went to see him and we’re</p><p>standing in the back of the room</p><p>because he did a</p><p>standing room only show</p><p>and it’s like</p><p>after like an hour like your fucking back hurts your</p><p>neck starts bothering you and your</p><p>it’s not comfortable to</p><p>stand up and</p><p>watch a show</p><p>i always figured because i’m on stage</p><p>standing for an hour like it’s no big deal</p><p>you know you</p><p>stand for an hour and a half and</p><p>talk on stage and it</p><p>doesn’t feel it’s not a problem</p><p>but standing</p><p>still watching someone</p><p>is a big difference is</p><p>the worst it’s terrible</p><p>do you even remember like the last half of that show</p><p>because i was</p><p>focused on my feet the</p><p>whole time yeah</p><p>it’s a terrible feeling</p><p>and what’s weird is</p><p>i talked to somebody in texas</p><p>they walked out of the show because they couldn’t</p><p>cause it was</p><p>standing room only at</p><p>doug’s show</p><p>and they just walked out they’re like we couldn’t take</p><p>it anymore yeah</p><p>i hate it so i’m not doing it anymore and</p><p>i’m having problems with this</p><p>because i had a show booked in march</p><p>at the fillmore</p><p>the fillmore in new york city</p><p>and they said that the</p><p>whole balcony had to be</p><p>standing i’m like fuck that man</p><p>give me less</p><p>money let’s see</p><p>what we can and</p><p>but they were like you know we can make more</p><p>money if people</p><p>stand i was like are you done</p><p>and so i canceled that gig and then the same</p><p>thing happened in houston i was supposed to do the</p><p>house of blues</p><p>and the same</p><p>thing they were</p><p>like well you know we can’t we need to have people</p><p>standing in the back and</p><p>i had it booked</p><p>i don’t know</p><p>my agents are not communicating</p><p>this to the people or they’re not paying attention</p><p>it’s going through too many people</p><p>before it gets to the person that makes a decision but</p><p>they didn’t want they wanted to have people</p><p>stand and i said fuck that so</p><p>now i’m gonna have to find a new gig</p><p>in new york and a new gig in houston and i’m probably</p><p>gonna wind up doing the improv</p><p>in houston i don’t know</p><p>thinking about that</p><p>and some maybe one of the clubs in</p><p>new york city</p><p>you go to joe’s twitter</p><p>website that has his calendar on it</p><p>you just gained four people</p><p>those people like talking about</p><p>standing yes</p><p>got more remember</p><p>do you remember</p><p>standing would like wait for a roller coaster to</p><p>stand like three</p><p>hours for a roller coaster</p><p>last a minute</p><p>yeah fucking terrible man yeah</p><p>run it like tom</p><p>green yeah tom</p><p>green’s got an awesome setup</p><p>i went to tom</p><p>green’s house</p><p>where i filmed</p><p>his talk show there</p><p>and he’s got a fucking</p><p>crazy setup man like</p><p>giant servers and</p><p>he’s got wires big you know</p><p>wires all throughout his living room</p><p>cause like he’s doing it</p><p>like serious</p><p>hardcore style and he’s doing it</p><p>or at least back then he was doing it he’s</p><p>still doing it isn’t he or is he</p><p>is he straight pay</p><p>per view now though he can’t</p><p>watch it for free at all now anymore</p><p>right i think</p><p>i think let’s go to tom</p><p>green live and see that is that the case</p><p>ladies and gentlemen</p><p>if it is i think that’s a fucking mistake</p><p>i think it is too</p><p>that’s a mistake</p><p>maybe maybe it’s the archives you have to be a</p><p>member to watch</p><p>that makes sense</p><p>maybe we’ll sit we’re going to the channel</p><p>he calls it the

that my parents</p><p>sent me money</p><p>and then i took that money</p><p>to buy them presents and i actually</p><p>spent more than that they sent me</p><p>if i would have waited</p><p>and sent them

you fucking</p><p>freak that’s good with its twitters</p><p>it’s good though it’s coming in now</p><p>will ufc ever have a</p><p>135 division i think the</p><p>ufc in the wec</p><p>the idea is eventually</p><p>that it’s gonna be one</p><p>thing when i don’t know</p><p>but i think it</p><p>should be cause i</p><p>think guys like</p><p>jose aldo and uriah</p><p>faber and mike brown</p><p>and miguel torres</p><p>those guys are</p><p>fucking awesome they deserve all the attention that the</p><p>ufc gets they deserve people to</p><p>know to be clamoring for</p><p>super fights and to see</p><p>big pay per</p><p>view you know</p><p>bouts and you know mad at in</p><p>madison square garden and fucking you know</p><p>the the mgm</p><p>grand they they</p><p>those guys deserve to be a</p><p>those kind of shows i mean the</p><p>level of talent</p><p>in the wc right now is</p><p>staggering and</p><p>135 145 pound division mean</p><p>these guys are fucking animals man</p><p>and even 155 they have some awesome</p><p>fighters i think</p><p>it would be</p><p>beneficial to everybody if it was all the</p><p>ufc was all one thing</p><p>now especially</p><p>since they own the wec</p><p>i think it would help everybody if they</p><p>could make that happen if it’s possible</p><p>rigorous sac says use that little kid liar in the act</p><p>i don’t know if that’s really funny sir</p><p>i think that’s</p><p>funny right now</p><p>because we’re talking</p><p>about right now but i don’t know if you</p><p>could recreate it’s not funny enough</p><p>to recreate that</p><p>and say

theories</p><p>the big theory of the ancient</p><p>alien theories is that</p><p>human beings</p><p>were manufactured</p><p>and that they use genetic manipulation to take</p><p>monkeys and add</p><p>alien dna to the</p><p>monkeys to make people</p><p>what do you</p><p>think about that</p><p>brian i think</p><p>asians are aliens they</p><p>could be right</p><p>maybe that’s why they’re so hot</p><p>the fuck is calling me</p><p>while i’m on my podcast god damn it</p><p>that’s the house</p><p>excuse me i’m in the middle of a podcast</p><p>oh how much longer should i be</p><p>okay you

fucking</p><p>stand up comedian</p><p>cage fighter</p><p>no pussy whipped husband and daddy</p><p>daddy has to</p><p>stop smoking</p><p>weed and doing his little webcam show because</p><p>everybody wants</p><p>to eat and they want to open up christmas presents</p><p>merry christmas you</p><p>dirty bitches</p><p>what was i talking</p><p>about before that happened</p><p>oh we’re talking about ancient aliens</p><p>yeah you were saying what’s your theory</p><p>asians asians</p><p>like aliens landed and had asians and then like</p><p>they’re not</p><p>like the asians nowadays aren’t</p><p>aliens but they’re a breed of</p><p>aliens kind of like maybe they’re more</p><p>alien than we are</p><p>maybe there was like different formulations</p><p>maybe that’s what all the different</p><p>breeds of human beings are you</p><p>know different like italians or they’re pure</p><p>we’re just much and they’re pure</p><p>they’re more pure to the actual human race you know</p><p>well definitely asians are more pure i mean there’s</p><p>there’s billions of them and they look</p><p>very similar that’s incredible they managed to do that</p><p>i mean i guess they probably look at europeans</p><p>in a similar way</p><p>but the difference is with blonde hair and red hair and</p><p>brown hair europeans come in all different colors and</p><p>sizes but even like you go korean</p><p>to japanese to chinese it’s all black hair</p><p>it’s all real similar skin</p><p>tones i mean god damn there’s some similarities in the</p><p>asian i would love to be</p><p>asian i think</p><p>really yeah</p><p>do you have excuse for having such a little dick oh</p><p>no i mean seriously don’t have to shave</p><p>most of them don’t have to shave</p><p>i hate shaving dude i don’t mind shaving</p><p>i fucking hate it</p><p>well you shave</p><p>everything i</p><p>enjoy it you making an adventure i’ll keep my ball hair</p><p>going my lower ball hair shave off</p><p>because there’s some gray ones in there i’m trying to</p><p>avoid but my</p><p>upper pews i</p><p>leave those bitches</p><p>alone yeah i trim them a little bit</p><p>when i was when i</p><p>lived alone i</p><p>would take nair</p><p>and put on a</p><p>trash bag and roll around like a pig and</p><p>really just so to get it all over my back</p><p>and then you can</p><p>really get the</p><p>scraper scraper</p><p>so then you</p><p>would have to get like a towel on a</p><p>towel and you</p><p>rub just rub hard really does it work</p><p>yeah wow brian</p><p>innovative hair loss methods by</p><p>brian michael</p><p>i had a nice fat thick mountain man beard for a while</p><p>back when i was</p><p>doing that evan tanner tribute beard i had a good one</p><p>going but i had to shave it for something i had to do</p><p>rejoined the human</p><p>rejoined society</p><p>well back when i came back from</p><p>colorado too</p><p>i was really</p><p>thinking about growing one in colorado but that might</p><p>push me well over the edge</p><p>when i was living in colorado on the top</p><p>of a mountain if i had a beard up there too i probably</p><p>would have got way</p><p>close to an animal</p><p>you know if i let myself fall with</p><p>crazy hairy</p><p>was there any</p><p>point love living there like that you were</p><p>just outside and you’re just like holy shit this is</p><p>scary you know what am i doing here yeah</p><p>definitely definitely it was</p><p>definitely scary</p><p>but that was</p><p>part of the appeal of it to me is that it was so</p><p>off the grid</p><p>right it was so outside of the way a normal person</p><p>every day gets to</p><p>experience life</p><p>i was living in the fucking woods</p><p>not just kinda in the woods i was living on</p><p>150 acres on the top of a mountain</p><p>in boulder colorado</p><p>outside of boulder</p><p>i mean it was like nine</p><p>miles above boulder it was pretty</p><p>trippy 8 500 feet</p><p>above sea level</p><p>and all sorts of wildlife</p><p>deer every day deer i was on a dirt road for</p><p>eight miles</p><p>deer every day i</p><p>would see deer</p><p>everyday i would see foxes occasionally i</p><p>would see porcupines</p><p>people saw bear i</p><p>never saw bear</p><p>saw a mountain lion</p><p>in my backyard i mean you saw a lot of shit</p><p>eagles all the time</p><p>i mean it was</p><p>really intense</p><p>it was so real</p><p>you know it was so like</p><p>you know you’re driving you</p><p>see in wild animals like real wild animals big fucking</p><p>ten point bucks walking down the</p><p>street you know</p><p>it’s very very interesting it’s</p><p>just that the</p><p>fact that you can live somewhere like that it’s such a</p><p>i think people get</p><p>stuck into patterns and i</p><p>think it’s real easy to get</p><p>stuck in the same way of</p><p>thinking the same way of looking at the world</p><p>and nothing changes that like moving to a new</p><p>place for a while</p><p>and moving to a</p><p>place that’s as</p><p>stunning as the mountains of colorado</p><p>i would love to go back but</p><p>it’s just not practical</p><p>to have a wife</p><p>and kids and you know and have little vulnerable</p><p>babies and being around fucking wild monsters</p><p>i mean my dog got</p><p>eaten by a mountain lion</p><p>when we were up there</p><p>that’s for real</p><p>like we saw mountain lion</p><p>i let the little dog out by himself dog disappears</p><p>i mean that dog got</p><p>eaten by a fucking mountain lion</p><p>you know which is very likely and</p><p>those animals died of</p><p>predation up there all the time it’s very common</p><p>they even prey</p><p>on animals they get used to them they get used to</p><p>recognizing and associating the barks</p><p>barks of these animals with like</p><p>prey and so they go towards</p><p>where they hear barks</p><p>so it’s actually</p><p>kind of dangerous when you have a fucking</p><p>house with dogs barking</p><p>cause sometimes</p><p>these mountain lines</p><p>like if they’re hungry</p><p>especially if they’re old</p><p>and they can’t</p><p>catch deer anymore</p><p>they know these dogs are like in a cage</p><p>these dogs have friends</p><p>they hop over that fence</p><p>like it ain’t shit</p><p>jack dogs they do it all the time they’re</p><p>scary as fuck</p><p>do you think people that</p><p>sleep with guns</p><p>underneath their pillows</p><p>if that’s just fake somebody said it once to impress</p><p>a girl oh no i know a guy who does it really yeah</p><p>is that just seem the most</p><p>like that’s dumb</p><p>well if you want it and you want it to have it</p><p>right there if you live in a</p><p>place where you</p><p>think you’re</p><p>gonna need it</p><p>right billy</p><p>i mean look it</p><p>doesn’t seem like it’s a good idea but what if</p><p>someone breaks in your</p><p>house and you need the gun</p><p>and you just go like that</p><p>and you got the gun</p><p>and then that keeps you alive</p><p>you know there’s that way of looking at it</p><p>you know there’s a way of looking at it like hey man</p><p>if you think that way man</p><p>fucking nothing can happen to you man as long as you</p><p>think positive</p><p>you can think that way you can be one of</p><p>those dudes</p><p>that goes through life convinced</p><p>that nothing ever bad is</p><p>gonna happen to you</p><p>you know i mean that that is possible you might</p><p>sneak through but</p><p>shit might get ugly</p><p>and shake it’s ugly</p><p>you want one of</p><p>these bitches</p><p>this shit’s important that’s cool shut</p><p>up guns ladies and gentlemen</p><p>i believe in the</p><p>second amendment</p><p>that’s really cool</p><p>i believe did we get</p><p>shooting santa i</p><p>haven’t been</p><p>shooting in so long</p><p>let’s really let’s go yeah</p><p>i want to go</p><p>go let’s go on</p><p>monday cool i think</p><p>yeah definitely</p><p>gun control is important you</p><p>gotta definitely</p><p>screen people you gotta</p><p>definitely make sure that</p><p>people don’t</p><p>you know that</p><p>the people can’t get access to guns that are fucking</p><p>crazy and that you know and that’s the problem</p><p>with a lot of gun shows is there’s a lot of people that</p><p>sell guns and gun shows that don’t give a fuck of your</p><p>license or not</p><p>they’re just trying to make some money and</p><p>there’s been exposed</p><p>on that where they’ve shown that</p><p>people in gun shows will sell guns to people that</p><p>don’t you know not really supposed to have guns but</p><p>the guns are out there</p><p>they’re fucking</p><p>out there there’s millions of them you’re not gonna</p><p>you should have one</p><p>you know if there’s</p><p>millions of guns out there</p><p>better to have it</p><p>and did not</p><p>need it than to need it and not have it that’s</p><p>you know i’m</p><p>i’m an optimist</p><p>i’m not a pessimist i’m not</p><p>you know i believe</p><p>that most human beings are good</p><p>but i’ve come across</p><p>way too many fucked up people</p><p>to have complete and</p><p>total blind</p><p>trust in the human race</p><p>i just don’t i’ve i’ve seen</p><p>way too many fucked up violent</p><p>things happen</p><p>i’ve seen way too many</p><p>crazy people</p><p>i’ve come in contact with and had to deal with</p><p>way too many fucking</p><p>crazy people</p><p>there’s a lot</p><p>of people out there that you can’t reason with there’s</p><p>a lot of people out there that are just broken and nuts</p><p>and that’s real</p><p>oh is that santa’s bells</p><p>santa’s bells is leaving us</p><p>santa’s bells where</p><p>no no i mean is that santa’s</p><p>oh you’re saying we have to end this</p><p>all right ladies and gentlemen we’re</p><p>gonna have to end this real soon</p><p>do do do do what ufc super fight would i like to see</p><p>brock lesnar</p><p>versus fade or</p><p>that’s

the bounty hunter wears hollow</p><p>that’s hilarious</p><p>all right ladies and gentlemen</p><p>this has been very interesting we are up to</p><p>three hundred and</p><p>seventy nine motherfuckers</p><p>i want to thank you for tuning in</p><p>this is we’re gonna do this much more</p><p>often now that i have this set up i finally</p><p>installed this webcam that i bought like five fucking</p><p>years ago you</p><p>gotta get your internet updated you get a new hd</p><p>i’m gonna get my internet updated</p><p>they have hd cameras now</p><p>59 bucks at amazon</p><p>look for the mic for this yeah</p><p>well no you don’t that’s actually an old camera now</p><p>that’s not good no</p><p>but it looks okay</p><p>yeah that’s okay but see it’s not an hd</p><p>you could be broadcast</p><p>in hd right now</p><p>but isn’t that</p><p>like more bandwidth for people to download</p><p>yeah but now when you have</p><p>twenty megabytes</p><p>you know oh but</p><p>crazy doesn’t affect them it affects</p><p>them downloading it only affects up</p><p>uploading yeah</p><p>once once i get the internet do it i’ll make it</p><p>i’ll make it hd so you can see how</p><p>ugly i am alright what else we got here</p><p>when the next time i’m gonna be you streaming</p><p>johnny bananas</p><p>that’s a very good question</p><p>i think what i’m going to try to do is</p><p>my ultimate goal in 2010</p><p>is i’m trying to write a book</p><p>right now and i’ve been</p><p>spending a lot of time writing that and writing</p><p>stand up comedy and not so much time</p><p>updating my website</p><p>but i do go on twitter because twitter’s fun for me and</p><p>it’s like a little exercise in writing to make things</p><p>short and make them 140 characters</p><p>i think that’s fun so</p><p>it is it’s like</p><p>it teaches you to like you</p><p>know edit your shit yeah and with comedy that’s very</p><p>important economy of words is what it’s called and a</p><p>stand up comedy it’s very important the less words you</p><p>could use to make a point</p><p>the funnier it’s</p><p>gonna be when it hits people</p><p>the more you know the more</p><p>verbose it is the more it’s not</p><p>funny when it gets there</p><p>so i think twitter is real good for that but</p><p>my point is in 2010</p><p>my main goal is more on the internet</p><p>more shit like this more you</p><p>stream shit</p><p>more twitter and</p><p>definitely more blogs</p><p>but i’m gonna</p><p>start doing more</p><p>video shit and where i’m</p><p>carrying i got a cool flip</p><p>thing from

basis</p><p>and i know there’s a little you</p><p>stream streaming</p><p>thing for the iphone</p><p>we’re gonna try that shit out but it’s probably gay</p><p>yeah if you’re on wi fi it’s not
