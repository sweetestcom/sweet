is about increasing your awareness of carbs okay certain carbs um like this carb right here cupcakes i used to love these things i used to eat this whole box like in one sitting no problem without even thinking of it they&amp;rsquo;re delicious i mean the packaging is incredible right so let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what&amp;rsquo;s in this product all right number one we have this thing right here you know what that is right that&amp;rsquo;s the first ingredient sugar we have flour and then we have high fructose corn syrup palm oil then we have more corn syrup cocoa soy bean oil tallow beef fat fascinating they put that in there glycerin cocoa processed with alkali modified corn starch so they have corn starch refined corn okay definitely gmo a little glyphosate on that and then we have uh baking soda baking soda right here salt corn starch so we have modified corn starch and corn starch we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that dextrose whey hydrogenated tallow so they&amp;rsquo;re basically making taylor into trans fats i thought that was banned okay inulin that&amp;rsquo;s a fiber egg calcium carbonate that&amp;rsquo;s limestone and then we have sorbic acid potassium sorbate calcium sulfate egg whites mono and diglycerides you heard of a triglyceride this is a digless ribe okay so then we have xantham gum soy lecithin cellulose gum locus bean gum that&amp;rsquo;s all going to give it the texture that you need monocalcium phosphate titanium dioxide for the coloring see you got coloring in there you have to have it certain colors right um disodium phosphate sunflower oil chocolate liqueur and defatted soy flour so those are the ingredients in the right combination to give you the right sweetness texture color and flavor right now here&amp;rsquo;s the problem let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this nutritional label right here okay we have 170 calories all right so now there&amp;rsquo;s eight servings so all of these calories and things right here are based on one of those servings so you have to multiply all these by eight if you&amp;rsquo;re gonna eat the whole thing which i always did and it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to have just one but let&amp;rsquo;s start off with the calories 170 okay so let&amp;rsquo;s say we we just four today and we&amp;rsquo;ll eat the rest tomorrow okay 680 calories it&amp;rsquo;s going to take you about an hour of jogging to burn that off so that&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to happen with most people that are consuming this type of food so what&amp;rsquo;s happening we&amp;rsquo;re cramming all this fuel into the body okay without burning it off very dangerous we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that now let&amp;rsquo;s take a look first at the fat grams is six grams it&amp;rsquo;s eight percent of this is fat then we get sodium 240 milligrams 10 10 wait a second now there&amp;rsquo;s no way that 10 of this is going to be actual salt and they actually don&amp;rsquo;t even say salt they say sodium there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other sodium in this product now where could that be could there be some monosodium glutamate i don&amp;rsquo;t know i don&amp;rsquo;t know maybe it&amp;rsquo;s hidden as modified cornstarch and that would make it more delicious because if 10 of this was actual salt sodium chloride it would be too salty when you consume more sodium without the chloride it&amp;rsquo;s not very salty it&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to retain fluid but not very salty okay carbs 29 grams that&amp;rsquo;s 11 of this product is carbohydrates one gram of fiber okay if we deduct that it&amp;rsquo;s 28 net carbs and then we get to the sugars if we add the sugars plus added sugar that&amp;rsquo;s 19 grams now if we multiply the well 29 minus one that&amp;rsquo;s 28 grams of carbs times four that&amp;rsquo;s a hundred and twelve grams of carbs okay it&amp;rsquo;s way way way too much now here&amp;rsquo;s the problem when we combine refined fat with refined sugar it starts to create a compound which is i&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a word here it&amp;rsquo;s glycated which means it&amp;rsquo;s kind of stuck together and it&amp;rsquo;s act it lacks like glue in the body and it plugs everything up you know the same thing happens when you add a protein with sugar okay so that&amp;rsquo;s one thing i don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that at this point but i do want to say if you eat fat with refined sugar the body is going to metabolize the refined sugar as a priority over the fat and the fat is going to be left unburned unoxidized that&amp;rsquo;s right so unoxidized fat increases the risk of insulin resistance and if you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching my videos you know what happens with that it all goes downhill from there now what we&amp;rsquo;re doing is we&amp;rsquo;re going to cram all this fuel from fat sugar together and jam it into the mitochondria that&amp;rsquo;s the machine that is supposed to burn the fuel but apparently most people that are eating these type of foods they&amp;rsquo;re not exercising a lot they&amp;rsquo;re not burning off these calories so you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a lot of excess fuel cram down the mitochondria without burning it you&amp;rsquo;re going to get so many free radicals so much oxidants and the problem is these refined fats and refined sugars don&amp;rsquo;t have the antioxidants to counter that okay so we get a lot of damage without any protection of these free radicals now unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s about five tissues in your body that don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of antioxidants it&amp;rsquo;s because your body does make antioxidants like glutathione sod catalase and there&amp;rsquo;s many other ones but these five tissues don&amp;rsquo;t normally have as many antioxidants as other tissues so we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the retina that&amp;rsquo;s in the eye the inside of the artery the brain your nerves the kidney cell and the beta cell in the pancreas that makes insulin so what happens is you get a lot of extra damage to these five tissues when you overload the system with that much fuel and create that much oxidation and free radicals and this is the typical pattern of a diabetic so the real dangerous situation in this scenario is too much fuel producing too much damage without any ability to protect itself from that damage so then the body develops insulin resistance as a protective mechanism but the problem with that that leads to a whole series of other issues so this video is really about increasing your awareness about certain carbohydrates what it does to the cells especially if you&amp;rsquo;re doing all these carbs without being able to burn them off at the same time very very dangerous and also the consequences of what happens and hopefully that may motivate certain people to start to make changes that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally do hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and

<p>﻿okay so we&rsquo;re at part two of breaking bad old  </p>
<p>habits okay this video is 
about increasing your awareness  </p>
<p>of carbs okay certain carbs um like this carb 
right here cupcakes i used to love these things  </p>
<p>i used to eat this whole box like in one sitting 
no problem without even thinking of it they&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>delicious i mean the packaging is incredible right 
so let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s in this product  </p>
<p>all right number one we have this thing right 
here you know what that is right that&rsquo;s the first  </p>
<p>ingredient sugar we have flour and then we have 
high fructose corn syrup palm oil then we have  </p>
<p>more corn syrup cocoa soy bean oil tallow beef fat 
fascinating they put that in there glycerin cocoa  </p>
<p>processed with alkali modified corn starch so they 
have corn starch refined corn okay definitely gmo  </p>
<p>a little glyphosate on that and then we have 
uh baking soda baking soda right here salt  </p>
<p>corn starch so we have modified corn starch 
and corn starch we&rsquo;ll come back to that  </p>
<p>dextrose whey hydrogenated tallow  </p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re basically making taylor into trans 
fats i thought that was banned okay inulin that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>a fiber egg calcium carbonate that&rsquo;s limestone 
and then we have sorbic acid potassium sorbate  </p>
<p>calcium sulfate egg whites mono and diglycerides 
you heard of a triglyceride this is a digless ribe  </p>
<p>okay so then we have xantham gum soy lecithin 
cellulose gum locus bean gum that&rsquo;s all going to  </p>
<p>give it the texture that you need monocalcium 
phosphate titanium dioxide for the coloring  </p>
<p>see you got coloring in there you 
have to have it certain colors right  </p>
<p>um disodium phosphate sunflower oil chocolate 
liqueur and defatted soy flour so those are the  </p>
<p>ingredients in the right combination to give you 
the right sweetness texture color and flavor right  </p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the problem let&rsquo;s take a look 
at this nutritional label right here  </p>
<p>okay we have 170 calories all right so now there&rsquo;s 
eight servings so all of these calories and things  </p>
<p>right here are based on one of those servings 
so you have to multiply all these by eight if  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna eat the whole thing which i always 
did and it&rsquo;s really difficult to have just one  </p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s start off with the calories 170 okay 
so let&rsquo;s say we we just four today and we&rsquo;ll eat  </p>
<p>the rest tomorrow okay 680 calories it&rsquo;s going to 
take you about an hour of jogging to burn that off  </p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s probably not going to happen with 
most people that are consuming this type of food  </p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s happening we&rsquo;re cramming all this 
fuel into the body okay without burning it off  </p>
<p>very dangerous we&rsquo;ll come back to that now 
let&rsquo;s take a look first at the fat grams  </p>
<p>is six grams it&rsquo;s eight percent of this is 
fat then we get sodium 240 milligrams 10 10  </p>
<p>wait a second now there&rsquo;s no way that 10 
of this is going to be actual salt and  </p>
<p>they actually don&rsquo;t even say salt they say 
sodium there&rsquo;s a lot of other sodium in this  </p>
<p>product now where could that be could 
there be some monosodium glutamate  </p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know maybe it&rsquo;s hidden as 
modified cornstarch and that would make it more  </p>
<p>delicious because if 10 of this was actual salt 
sodium chloride it would be too salty when you  </p>
<p>consume more sodium without the chloride it&rsquo;s not 
very salty it&rsquo;s definitely going to retain fluid  </p>
<p>but not very salty okay carbs 29 grams that&rsquo;s 11 
of this product is carbohydrates one gram of fiber  </p>
<p>okay if we deduct that it&rsquo;s 28 net 
carbs and then we get to the sugars  </p>
<p>if we add the sugars plus added sugar that&rsquo;s 19 
grams now if we multiply the well 29 minus one  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 28 grams of carbs times four that&rsquo;s 
a hundred and twelve grams of carbs okay  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way way way too much now here&rsquo;s the problem 
when we combine refined fat with refined sugar  </p>
<p>it starts to create a compound which is i&rsquo;m going 
to give you a word here it&rsquo;s glycated which means  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of stuck together and it&rsquo;s act it lacks 
like glue in the body and it plugs everything up  </p>
<p>you know the same thing happens when you add a 
protein with sugar okay so that&rsquo;s one thing i  </p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to get into that at this point but i 
do want to say if you eat fat with refined sugar  </p>
<p>the body is going to metabolize the refined 
sugar as a priority over the fat and the fat is  </p>
<p>going to be left unburned unoxidized that&rsquo;s 
right so unoxidized fat increases the risk  </p>
<p>of insulin resistance and if you&rsquo;ve been watching 
my videos you know what happens with that it all  </p>
<p>goes downhill from there now what we&rsquo;re doing is 
we&rsquo;re going to cram all this fuel from fat sugar  </p>
<p>together and jam it into the mitochondria that&rsquo;s 
the machine that is supposed to burn the fuel but  </p>
<p>apparently most people that are eating these type 
of foods they&rsquo;re not exercising a lot they&rsquo;re not  </p>
<p>burning off these calories so you&rsquo;re going to get 
a lot of excess fuel cram down the mitochondria  </p>
<p>without burning it you&rsquo;re going to get so many 
free radicals so much oxidants and the problem is  </p>
<p>these refined fats and refined sugars 
don&rsquo;t have the antioxidants to counter that  </p>
<p>okay so we get a lot of damage without 
any protection of these free radicals now  </p>
<p>unfortunately there&rsquo;s about five tissues in your 
body that don&rsquo;t have a lot of antioxidants it&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>because your body does make antioxidants like 
glutathione sod catalase and there&rsquo;s many other  </p>
<p>ones but these five tissues don&rsquo;t normally 
have as many antioxidants as other tissues so  </p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the retina that&rsquo;s in 
the eye the inside of the artery the brain  </p>
<p>your nerves the kidney cell and the 
beta cell in the pancreas that makes  </p>
<p>insulin so what happens is you get a lot 
of extra damage to these five tissues  </p>
<p>when you overload the system with that 
much fuel and create that much oxidation  </p>
<p>and free radicals and this is the typical pattern 
of a diabetic so the real dangerous situation  </p>
<p>in this scenario is too much fuel producing too 
much damage without any ability to protect itself  </p>
<p>from that damage so then the body develops 
insulin resistance as a protective mechanism  </p>
<p>but the problem with that that leads to a 
whole series of other issues so this video  </p>
<p>is really about increasing your awareness about 
certain carbohydrates what it does to the cells  </p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing all these carbs without 
being able to burn them off at the same time  </p>
<p>very very dangerous and also the consequences 
of what happens and hopefully that  </p>
<p>may motivate certain people to start to 
make changes that they wouldn&rsquo;t normally do  </p>
<p>hey before you go real quick i have 
a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p>
<p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p>
<p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p>
<p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p>
<p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p>
