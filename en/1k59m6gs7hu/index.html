<p>are gonna be blown away
and you the first thing i want to talk</p>
<p>about is um
you did you get into this topic</p>
<p>of fasting because you had a personal
problem or was it just you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>interested in it
uh i i never had like any health issues</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve
basically been pretty healthy throughout</p>
<p>my entire life
but i got into intermittent fasting when</p>
<p>i was uh doing
you know weightlifting and bodybuilding</p>
<p>in
in high school so it kind of just became</p>
<p>more of like a
dieting tool and just a nutritional tool</p>
<p>so i tried it out first
and i just started enjoying it and then</p>
<p>from the from there on
i also just delved a lot into more of</p>
<p>the research
and i started writing about it in my</p>
<p>blog which
then turned into the youtube channel and</p>
<p>several books and the podcasts
interesting because usually in</p>
<p>universities and
they don&rsquo;t really emphasize fasting or</p>
<p>low carb it&rsquo;s usually high carb right
so you kind of just found out about it</p>
<p>somehow
yeah like i did my own like research on</p>
<p>youtube
and okay just discovered discovered like</p>
<p>different
uh and also like listening to different</p>
<p>podcasts and learning about keto from
there and</p>
<p>just trying it out myself ah okay great
awesome and um you also went to school</p>
<p>for i think uh
an anthropology right yeah yeah i</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in uh cultural
anthropology</p>
<p>did you get into you know ancient
civilizations as far as what they ate</p>
<p>back then
did you was that a topic that was</p>
<p>covered extensively or
uh we we did have like a few modules</p>
<p>about history and hunter gatherer
specifically</p>
<p>so yeah we did cover a lot like i
remember like one</p>
<p>of my uh essays final essays was on the
topic of uh</p>
<p>why the uh hunter-gatherers converted
over into</p>
<p>like the agriculture and uh that sort of
thing</p>
<p>and like kind of change the entire
history so they say</p>
<p>wow and it was it was quite fascinating
actually that it wasn&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>pre-planned thing or it wasn&rsquo;t like a
natural it wasn&rsquo;t like a natural</p>
<p>natural outgrowth of like uh evolution
or society</p>
<p>it was more like a coincidence because
uh you know</p>
<p>over like ten thousand years ago twenty
thousand years ago the hunter-gatherer</p>
<p>populations were already constantly
moving in between being a</p>
<p>hunter-gatherer for some seasons
and for other seasons they were already</p>
<p>growing crops
so they just probably</p>
<p>embraced this sort of like a very uh
seasonal</p>
<p>lifestyle and for some reason or in a
very coincidental manner</p>
<p>there was this during one period they
they</p>
<p>eventually um hunted out all of their uh
most uh available game</p>
<p>uh meet so to say they out hunted like
this</p>
<p>gazelle population there was also like a
very cold season so there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>uh a lot of food in in total so they
were kind of forced into starting uh</p>
<p>these
small villages and uh then from there on</p>
<p>the hunter or the farmers just had like
a</p>
<p>slight edge over the hunters because
they were able to store food for much</p>
<p>longer
and therefore they just like out</p>
<p>competed
the hunters in a very coincidental</p>
<p>manner
wow fascinating did um</p>
<p>is i wonder if there&rsquo;s a lot of any data
on the type of um</p>
<p>the type of foods they ate back then as
far as</p>
<p>the hybrids that are now like let&rsquo;s say
fruits versus vegetables back then i</p>
<p>mean you didn&rsquo;t have watermelon you
didn&rsquo;t probably have these sweet apples</p>
<p>like they had they probably had
you know bitter wrappers is there any</p>
<p>data on that i couldn&rsquo;t find any
actually</p>
<p>uh well i&rsquo;m pretty sure that the
the foodies was like more fibrous uh</p>
<p>less carbs
less energy and total less sugar and</p>
<p>yeah more like
the harsher to digest i would imagine so</p>
<p>um yeah like it&rsquo;s so true that the apple
or the</p>
<p>um the watermelon is completely
different</p>
<p>uh nowadays than it was even just a few
decades ago so uh</p>
<p>like in the you know ten thousand years
ago the foods were completely different</p>
<p>wow and then what about um
i&rsquo;m sure like even the banana wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that sweet back then
yeah absolutely um now as far as</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some data on just out of
curiosity the uh since you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ve studied this what
about the amount of um</p>
<p>the quantity of potassium foods like
vegetables is there data i i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>references that uh
sometimes they as much as um you know</p>
<p>the month
like 11 000 grams of potassium foods is</p>
<p>that
do you have any ever heard about that um</p>
<p>i not really sure about that so
like they probably wear it depends on</p>
<p>the
location as well so like if the</p>
<p>population is more near to the equator
then they would probably get more</p>
<p>potassium from like fruits and
vegetables and those things</p>
<p>but and likewise all hunter gatherers
did some form of uh foraging so</p>
<p>they all got a little bit of potassium
from those sources</p>
<p>uh not sure if they got exactly like 11
000</p>
<p>um i wouldn&rsquo;t imagine maybe you know
probably changed throughout the seasons</p>
<p>and changed also like on a daily daily
basis</p>
<p>is there and then one last question and
then we&rsquo;ll start our interview</p>
<p>um what about um
did you ever find any data in like the</p>
<p>earliest um
did they find any humans early on</p>
<p>stuck in the ice that were preserved
that</p>
<p>um they were able to dissect in the
stomach and see what they ate</p>
<p>like the earliest uh man
um well i i recall um one of the</p>
<p>oldest like mummified humans the
founding ice</p>
<p>i think his name was like ozzy or
something in in</p>
<p>switzerland i think in the alps and he
had</p>
<p>like he had actually like a patch of
uh some like mushrooms so you know in</p>
<p>the mountains
eating these medicinal mushrooms and</p>
<p>different kinds of fungi is probably a
really</p>
<p>uh more easily eatable source of
nutrition</p>
<p>and i think you know the humans back
then they ate</p>
<p>you know whatever they could find so it
probably consisted of</p>
<p>both different kinds of roots and
vegetables as well as</p>
<p>meats and foul and fish even
makes total sense okay great well thank</p>
<p>you um
so the first thing i want to do is i</p>
<p>want to get into
autophagy for those of you that are new</p>
<p>it might be a new topic for those of you
probably most of you know about it but</p>
<p>can you give us a real basic uh kind of
an idea of what autophagy is</p>
<p>yeah sure like autophagy translates into
self-eating and it&rsquo;s describes this</p>
<p>intracellular process
where different particles and weaker</p>
<p>components of the cell or dysfunctional
components of the cell are being</p>
<p>recycled
and it even is involved in the immune</p>
<p>system functioning
and reducing or finding reactive oxygen</p>
<p>species and pathogens
so yeah it&rsquo;s a very it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>intrinsic part
of the functioning of the cell and there</p>
<p>is always like some
form of basal autophagy happening on a</p>
<p>daily basis so
you know fluctuates on depending on what</p>
<p>you do but generally
autophagy is more of like a response to some</p>
<p>form of like a stress
or like energy deficit so it gets</p>
<p>activated primarily when you&rsquo;re
you know either fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>restricting your calorie intake
you&rsquo;re doing some form of exercise or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exposed to some other
kind of stress with even like</p>
<p>you know even things like the emf or
electromagnetic frequencies can</p>
<p>turn on autophagy to a certain extent blue
light does it</p>
<p>and the sauna the cold a little bit so
yeah it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a stress resp so like a cellular
stress response and the main purpose is</p>
<p>to yeah like just recycle kind of
tighten the budget so to say recycle the</p>
<p>the
ingredients and the the components of</p>
<p>the cell that aren&rsquo;t necessary and that
are just</p>
<p>like unneeded interesting
so i would imagine um</p>
<p>in the area of cancer when you&rsquo;re doing
fasting</p>
<p>in fasting in general if we just talk
about fasting related to</p>
<p>cancer do you do you have any data that
you can share with</p>
<p>i guess both turning on certain genes
and expressing certain genes and turning</p>
<p>off other genes
as well as autophagy because as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cleaning up
damaged mitochondria and dna</p>
<p>damage you&rsquo;re going to basically help
reduce</p>
<p>resist risk of cancer uh
yeah i the kind of current consensus as</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen
from the researchers is that autophagy</p>
<p>is great
for uh disease prevention and uh</p>
<p>preventing yourself from getting sick
from different kinds of diseases like it</p>
<p>can protect against
insulin resistance and atherosclerosis</p>
<p>as well as some malignant tumors and
cancers but at the same time there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also
a lot of research showing that</p>
<p>in the presence of an already existing
malignancy or a tumor</p>
<p>then the process of asafoeti can also
promote its survival so to say because</p>
<p>uh
is like like i said it&rsquo;s a recycling</p>
<p>process and it doesn&rsquo;t have like an
object</p>
<p>objective judgment about what&rsquo;s good or
what&rsquo;s bad what&rsquo;s a good cell what&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bad cell
so the the idea is that the cancer cell</p>
<p>is just going to steal the energy that
gets created from</p>
<p>atopaji and it&rsquo;s going to use it for its
own benefit</p>
<p>and if you inhibit the process of
autophagy then you can</p>
<p>you can see that it could help to in
some cases</p>
<p>get rid of the or let&rsquo;s start out some
of the cancer</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very complex situation and
it&rsquo;s very context dependent</p>
<p>so not all cancers benefit from autophagy
and some of them can actually you know</p>
<p>die from it where some others don&rsquo;t so
it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s gonna cure
cancer so to say it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>preventing yourself from getting sick
and kind of keeping your house clean</p>
<p>but at the same time if you&rsquo;re already
sick then i wouldn&rsquo;t place all of my</p>
<p>bets on it
and the research also says that there</p>
<p>are potentially
some negative side effects to it got it</p>
<p>what about fasting in general uh you
have</p>
<p>the you know the starving off of glucose
and glutamine which cancer can</p>
<p>consume but also you have the expression
of certain genes</p>
<p>do you have any data on that as far as
related to cancer</p>
<p>um turning off you know genes that are
related to triggering cancer or growing</p>
<p>cancer
um well yeah like for example</p>
<p>um well well i do know that ketosis
and fasting can uh inhibit heat stacks</p>
<p>which are associated with aging and
cancers as well</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re histone diacetyl
i&rsquo;m not sure what their full name is yet</p>
<p>but essentially they are these uh
related uh inhibitors that can be caused</p>
<p>with some
diseases uh but yeah like autophagy</p>
<p>uh also like um yet it
it it promotes some other forms of uh</p>
<p>health as well like usually autophagy
is activated when you are under energy</p>
<p>stress
and uh for example it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>turned on by this particular pathway or
the fuel sensor called ampk</p>
<p>which which promotes the kind of fuel
mobilization of</p>
<p>of the entire body as well as ketosis
and that has been shown to have</p>
<p>like um like anti-aging effects as well
as a disease</p>
<p>prediction okay and the reason i&rsquo;m
bringing this up is because i had a very</p>
<p>interesting um
person call me uh he&rsquo;s been studying um</p>
<p>you know autophagy and fasting and keto
and and about a few years ago</p>
<p>he came down with um a diagnosis
of prostate cancer stage four</p>
<p>spread metastasis to his bones and his
uh</p>
<p>he started getting bone pain through the
rib cage and spread all over through his</p>
<p>body
and not only did he already have</p>
<p>diabetes and every other
symptom metabolic disease but he came</p>
<p>towards this cancer
so the doctor said sorry um</p>
<p>we can give you some drugs to for the
pain but there&rsquo;s nothing we can do he</p>
<p>goes to three different doctors
and then he starts going on youtube he</p>
<p>starts studying on youtube
and um learns about fasting</p>
<p>so you know he&rsquo;s a pretty smart guy
because he</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some data that was shown that if
you fast</p>
<p>for too long you can deprive yourself of
nutrients</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t help the immune system
that can actually make things worse so</p>
<p>what he did is he
did a 45 day fast now normally</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t go that long but he did
because he wasn&rsquo;t hungry</p>
<p>and he had a lot of weight to tap into
but but what he did</p>
<p>is something that i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s
a lot of research on</p>
<p>and i think there&rsquo;s a little bit of data
on but it&rsquo;s hard to find it</p>
<p>he just took a lot of nutrients while he
was fasting</p>
<p>because you know when people say you&rsquo;re
gonna do a true fast you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>take anything else well he took a lot of
nutrients</p>
<p>and he also took um concentrated um
phytonutrients like out of garlic um</p>
<p>and turmeric and several other ones that
were um</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ve been known to help to
inhibit the formation of cancer so he</p>
<p>was doing all that
and uh for 45 days and so he went back</p>
<p>um to the doctor and
the bone cancer was gone it was negative</p>
<p>and so was his prostate cancer and so he
is</p>
<p>um the doctors just don&rsquo;t know what to
do don&rsquo;t know what to even think of it</p>
<p>you know you would think they would be
like wow</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s find out what you did
they weren&rsquo;t even interested but anyway</p>
<p>he um
he wanted to tell me a story i did an</p>
<p>interview on him i&rsquo;m going to release
the video probably on monday but</p>
<p>fascinating data on um what happened to
his body when he did a 45 day fast with</p>
<p>nutrients
i mean you like out of all the people</p>
<p>that i know that had stage four
i&rsquo;ve never met anyone who survived</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know have you have you um no
not really and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a yeah like a</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;ve also heard like similar
stories where people</p>
<p>go on this very long fast and even do
things like dry fasting and those things</p>
<p>uh but yeah like i i would imagine you
know</p>
<p>giving your body some some some of those
nutrients is also</p>
<p>very beneficial because um you know some
of those compounds that you mentioned</p>
<p>like um
the turmeric it can also promote</p>
<p>uh further autophagy as well so
these different compound polyphenolic</p>
<p>compounds and plant
compounds ginger cinnamon</p>
<p>cayenne pepper you know berberine they
also</p>
<p>uh can turn on autophagy and have like
other other medicinal benefits yeah</p>
<p>fascinating
so um yeah i&rsquo;m just learning all about</p>
<p>like learning exactly what he did
because obviously it worked for him and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some great data but um yeah so i&rsquo;ll
share some of the stuff that he found</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve never even heard before
he he found some data and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever heard this
that there&rsquo;s some differences between</p>
<p>the ketones that are generated from
fasting</p>
<p>versus the ketones ketones that are
generated from</p>
<p>diet have you ever heard that before
um yeah like uh the only</p>
<p>the only uh difference that i&rsquo;ve seen
has to do with some of the</p>
<p>uh ratios between nad and nadh as well
so for example for clarification nad is</p>
<p>like this
coenzyme in the body that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>with virtually
all processes and especially in the</p>
<p>metabolism and
nad is uh fluctuating or it&rsquo;s cycled</p>
<p>between nad
plus and nadh and uh you know</p>
<p>if your energy is let&rsquo;s say lower your
energy status is lower</p>
<p>like when you are fasting then your nad
is higher than energyh</p>
<p>whereas if you&rsquo;re eating then your nadh
is uh higher</p>
<p>and in a d has is like a role enhanced
aging and</p>
<p>uh just general longevity so the older
you get the less energy you have</p>
<p>and the sicker you are the also less
energy you have so that&rsquo;s why probably</p>
<p>fasting can help with raising your
energy levels</p>
<p>and the way it does it is by
re-promoting the recycling of nad</p>
<p>because then it is like the majority of
your nad on a daily basis is</p>
<p>being created from this uh the salvage
pathway</p>
<p>which is uh which is not the right from
diet it&rsquo;s that derived from</p>
<p>the recycling of the energy and the
fasting as well as exercise are</p>
<p>one of the most like the best ways of
going about it because the ampk that i</p>
<p>mentioned is needed
for uh turning on that salvage pathway</p>
<p>so you need to do something that puts on
like energy stress on the system</p>
<p>in order to regenerate your nad that&rsquo;s
fascinating because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have people that are trying out
keto and instead of going on the keto</p>
<p>diet they take some exogenous ketones
and they</p>
<p>as a supplement they think they&rsquo;re uh
they&rsquo;re really doing keto and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get all the benefits
um not quite um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your um what&rsquo;s your thought
on this comment that a lot of people</p>
<p>make um
well i don&rsquo;t want to do fasting because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to lose all my muscles</p>
<p>well yeah it&rsquo;s a fair fair point or a
fair concern</p>
<p>because like you don&rsquo;t want to become
emanciated or</p>
<p>lose your muscle mass because muscle
mass is really important for just</p>
<p>longevity as well as metabolic
flexibility so</p>
<p>with more muscle mass the more
carbohydrates you can also tolerate</p>
<p>and the more insulin sensitive you are
the</p>
<p>the more like more glycogen you have
to store and you&rsquo;ll also be able to just</p>
<p>get away with more calories without
gaining weight</p>
<p>so from a like functional perspective as
well as aesthetic perspective</p>
<p>muscle mass is really important and the
fasting doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well fasting is like a inherently
catabolic state</p>
<p>you are like breaking down your uh
tissue</p>
<p>and uh if you don&rsquo;t compensate for it
with adequate nutrition then eventually</p>
<p>you will start to lose muscle uh so yeah
that&rsquo;s why the key aspect of it is to</p>
<p>make sure that you if you even if you
are doing some fasting that you also</p>
<p>re-feed properly and you get like the
key nutrients</p>
<p>needed for muscle maintenance and growth
especially like protein is the most</p>
<p>important thing
so combining like a low protein diet</p>
<p>with internal fasting is not a good idea
because uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re staying in a very catabolic state
and you&rsquo;re not getting enough um</p>
<p>like building building blocks for
promoting a muscle maintenance</p>
<p>so so isn&rsquo;t there also um a protective
mechanism that</p>
<p>does tend to conserve um
protein fibers when you do a fast</p>
<p>yeah there are certainly is like growth
hormone</p>
<p>which gets released while fasting does
have a like anti-catabolic effect</p>
<p>and uh it promotes fat burning and
maintains muscle mass</p>
<p>as well as ketosis or ketones themselves
ketones that have</p>
<p>anti-catabolic effects and autophagy
even</p>
<p>has some anti-catabolic effects but but
it&rsquo;s more of like in a hormetic way</p>
<p>that a small amount of uh autophagy and
small amounts of catabolism</p>
<p>make your body more resilient against it
so if you never</p>
<p>experience any like fasting or if you
never experience</p>
<p>any small amounts of muscle metabolism
then you would like</p>
<p>wither away really really fast if you if
you ever skip a meal so to say because</p>
<p>yeah like the body needs this small
amount of stress in order to actually</p>
<p>get stronger and benefit from it but at
the same time like</p>
<p>you know eating an actual meal is still
more uh muscle preserving than any kind</p>
<p>of fasting
although the fasting is very beneficial</p>
<p>in doing it so
if if you were too fast when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing ketosis then that&rsquo;s much
much more catabolic than if you were too</p>
<p>fast when you are in ketosis
so that&rsquo;s why i believe like combining</p>
<p>uh fasting with some
form of a keto diet is a is very is much</p>
<p>healthier or is much
easier as well because you all just feel</p>
<p>more energized and you&rsquo;ll get less
hungry because you&rsquo;ll just be burning</p>
<p>like the fats and ketones
versus um someone doing keto i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>intermittent fasting
and doing a high carb diet right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about
yeah like i i really i believe like um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still better than nothing like uh
you can still do intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>gain some of the benefits if you are
doing like a high carb diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna be from my own and other
obvious people</p>
<p>experience it&rsquo;s uh usually slightly
harder because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uh running on this you know glucose
burning engine</p>
<p>and your once your glucose runs out so
then you go into like a mild energy</p>
<p>crisis
which doesn&rsquo;t really happen if you are</p>
<p>like fully keto adapted you&rsquo;ll just
tap into your body fat and not</p>
<p>experience like any energy dips or you
won&rsquo;t get hungry</p>
<p>during day time and then this is
probably another</p>
<p>good reason why you should exercise uh
to</p>
<p>keep your muscle mass there right
because exercise does stimulate uh the</p>
<p>growth of muscle
yeah yeah exactly like it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>like most important part of it like you
need to</p>
<p>send a signal to the body that it needs
to have a muscle</p>
<p>yeah so um
so i guess the key to if you were to do</p>
<p>fasting
and you were to do um and you want to</p>
<p>preserve your muscles and you&rsquo;re eating
protein but you&rsquo;re massively stressed</p>
<p>out
the cortisol spikes uh that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>not going to be good to preserve muscle
yeah yeah like cortisol cortisol breaks</p>
<p>down
muscle tissue but but at the same time</p>
<p>cortisol also
mobilizes fat so it&rsquo;s a very again</p>
<p>depends on the dose
a little bit of cortisol is good but too</p>
<p>much is bad and if
you&rsquo;re chronically stressed out then</p>
<p>eventually yeah you&rsquo;re going to lose
your hair</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to imbalance your hormones
and lose muscle mass and</p>
<p>cause problems sleeping so yeah in most
cases the</p>
<p>morning rising cortisol which happens
after you wake up is beneficial</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to start today but
you don&rsquo;t want to have like high amounts</p>
<p>of cortisol
in the evening and when you&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>go go to bed
yeah so there&rsquo;s a difference between the</p>
<p>chronic uh overwhelming stress and
some some intermittent stress that you</p>
<p>can recover from
especially like i know women when they</p>
<p>go through menopause
and let&rsquo;s say they get some overwhelming</p>
<p>personal problems that just can&rsquo;t go
away boy they just</p>
<p>they can really wither down and just get
atrophy like crazy</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve seen that many times yeah
i want to mention this topic that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>confusing for a lot of people maybe you
could</p>
<p>help educate people in a way that&rsquo;s very
simple</p>
<p>mtor like what is mtor in the
simplest version that you can explain</p>
<p>yeah well in the simplest way i can say
it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>growth switch in the body that promotes
growth of all cells whether that be</p>
<p>muscle cells
nerve cells immune cells and</p>
<p>even some cancer cells as well as you
know</p>
<p>fat cells in some cases as well so it&rsquo;s
like a all-encompassing</p>
<p>growth switch and uh mtor
in small amounts and in the right dose</p>
<p>is great because it&rsquo;s again useful for
muscle building and muscle maintenance</p>
<p>so without emptor you would die because
yeah you know you would just</p>
<p>wither away eventually but if your mtor
is</p>
<p>you know chronically activated and it&rsquo;s
expressed in</p>
<p>excess then that can also cause some
you know disease uh like for example a</p>
<p>good sign of too much empty activation
is acne</p>
<p>and skin problems and because it&rsquo;s
related to ige</p>
<p>one as well so you know some form of uh
higher blood sugar diabetes that can</p>
<p>cause that can be result from
too much mTOR and and you know the</p>
<p>worst case scenario is some cancers and
malignancies</p>
<p>because because of the same like uh
growth</p>
<p>promoting aspect so how would we
translate that into something practical</p>
<p>like
what would you want to do to not overdo</p>
<p>it
to create not too much mtor but just</p>
<p>enough is it just related to what we
talked about as the</p>
<p>your stress and overwhelming stress
versus a little bit of stress here and</p>
<p>there
uh well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>you know mtor is raised by some key
factors like uh</p>
<p>one of them is protein amino acids
the second one is like carbohydrates and</p>
<p>insulin
and the third is uh overall calories so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating too many calories the
renter is already going to be</p>
<p>turned on to a certain extent and lastly
it&rsquo;s also the eating frequency so uh</p>
<p>basically if you eat a bunch of junk
foods all the time</p>
<p>very often then your empty is going to
be turned on all the time</p>
<p>so uh the best way to kind of mitigate
that is to</p>
<p>cut down on the eating frequency you
know skip a few meals do something</p>
<p>interesting
and as well as limit your like</p>
<p>carbohydrate intake
and not spike your incident all the time</p>
<p>so because you know
dealt you know you can choose to either</p>
<p>restrict carbs or restrict protein
so if you if you restrict your protein</p>
<p>then that can have like a negative
effect on your muscle maintenance and</p>
<p>just because protein is more essential
than carbohydrates</p>
<p>you need protein to survive but you
don&rsquo;t need carbs to survive so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>which one are going to choose
so uh you can you could have both but</p>
<p>yeah the idea is to not over eat
either of them and uh yeah like just</p>
<p>fixing insulin resistance is also
important</p>
<p>because uh if you have like a
higher blood sugar all the time</p>
<p>throughout the entire day like a
pre-diabetic</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s also like uh going to at
least</p>
<p>turn on mtor to a certain extent so you
you&rsquo;re going to be in this hyper insulin</p>
<p>insulin mix state all the time how would
how would you um what would you</p>
<p>recommend for someone
as far as the amount of protein someone</p>
<p>should consume at a given meal
well if we&rsquo;re talking about like a one</p>
<p>particular meal
then the the well i would say that</p>
<p>if you do eat a meal then the goal of
that meal should be to stimulate</p>
<p>muscle protein synthesis um because
that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>first of all is going to trigger the
maintenance of muscle tissue</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re trying to like build
muscle tissue then it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>needed to consume at least a certain
amount of protein</p>
<p>to make it happen and the research shows
that the minimal effect</p>
<p>comes from at least 2.6 grams
to 3 grams of leucine per meal</p>
<p>and which which leucine is the most
anabolic amino acid that turns on mtor</p>
<p>and you can get that amount
usually from like at least 30 grams of</p>
<p>protein
so i think the minimal amount of protein</p>
<p>you should get from one meal should be
30 grams</p>
<p>and the upper threshold for that appears
to be around like 40 grams</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s not going to be like a
additional benefit beyond</p>
<p>40 grams interesting so
that it doesn&rsquo;t but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>you but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t
eat more protein</p>
<p>per meal either your body is just going
to slow down some of the digestion</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to absorb it like like
later in a few hours</p>
<p>so you could even eat like you could
even eat the single days of protein in</p>
<p>one sitting in one meal
and the body wouldn&rsquo;t like lose or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna
you&rsquo;re not gonna waste it away your body</p>
<p>is still gonna absorb all the protein
it&rsquo;s just gonna do it in a small</p>
<p>slower manner and so if we look at
the that in ounces uh with sounds to me</p>
<p>that would be something between
i guess three and a half to seven ounces</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your
conversion on that uh i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>like uh i i don&rsquo;t use ounces but uh
right like 30 grams of protein depends</p>
<p>on the protein source as well
like um if we&rsquo;re talking about like</p>
<p>chicken breasts
then one i think one chicken breast has</p>
<p>at least like 30 grams or 40 grams
whereas if we&rsquo;re talking about like uh</p>
<p>salmon then salmon has a little bit less
uh so</p>
<p>yeah it depends on depends on the
protein source but i i i like to</p>
<p>i i like to look at the grams and
usually like maybe</p>
<p>at least like a fist fist size is like a
piece of meat or something</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 40 grams i think okay good
so i mean even like if you do eggs which</p>
<p>is uh very bio available
uh one egg is seven grams yeah so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking um
you know you can do the math five five</p>
<p>four five four five eggs
is uh is perfect for for for that</p>
<p>because
eggs also has very high in leucine so</p>
<p>you can get you can get the
all the leucine that you need for that</p>
<p>stimulation from like 4x
5x and you&rsquo;re talking per meal per day</p>
<p>uh per meal yeah like you know in
total the the research shows that</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t even for like high level
physic physical athletes</p>
<p>and uh sports uh people is there&rsquo;s no
benefit beyond eating</p>
<p>0.8 grams per pound of lean body mass
per day</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like the upper threshold that
no one really needs to consume beyond</p>
<p>and for the average person who does who
just you know works out on a regular</p>
<p>basis
then for them they could get away with</p>
<p>like 0.7 grams per pound of body weight
i do believe that the slightly higher</p>
<p>protein intake is
better because the rda for protein is</p>
<p>really low like the rda for protein is
like 0.4 grams</p>
<p>per pound of body weight which is just
like the bare essentials for</p>
<p>surviving and not with the wrong way so
for optimal</p>
<p>uh because like the research shows that
the higher protein diets tend to be</p>
<p>better about body composition
they tend to increase like</p>
<p>fat loss as well as increase muscle
growth</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also like slightly more
satiating so people naturally tend to</p>
<p>under eat when they do increase their
protein and intake a little bit</p>
<p>so i would aim for like promote let&rsquo;s
say for example</p>
<p>um a person who weighs let&rsquo;s say 150
pounds or 160 pounds</p>
<p>then for them they they could eat maybe
like 120 grams of protein</p>
<p>per day or 100 grams of protein at least
like the minimum</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would aim for okay and
then um</p>
<p>if obviously if someone is
younger and they have a fast metabolism</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have insulin resistance
instead of going keep continuing to go</p>
<p>up with the protein maybe they should
add more fat</p>
<p>as calories yeah like the uh
well they if they if they were to be</p>
<p>eating more protein
then that the extra protein will</p>
<p>eventually be converted into glucose and
sugar basically which isn&rsquo;t is which</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily like a bad thing but
it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you could also eat carbs at that point
so you&rsquo;re not getting like additional</p>
<p>muscle building benefits from that
you&rsquo;re just wasting more energy for</p>
<p>digesting that protein but yeah like
adding adding either</p>
<p>once you have hit the uh like the
goal for a protein intake then the way</p>
<p>to go up from that
and if you still have like calories for</p>
<p>the day then that will be either like
fats or carbs so depending on</p>
<p>your preference i personally do like to
have more fats</p>
<p>um because of uh just me trying to
maintain some aspects of ketosis</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not like really strict with my
carbs either so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like eating plenty of vegetables so
i&rsquo;m not afraid of getting kicked out of</p>
<p>ketosis because of eating like broccoli
or cauliflower</p>
<p>so right yes like the fibrous carbs are
pretty</p>
<p>benign in my opinion and they don&rsquo;t
really affect my like ketones and</p>
<p>blood sugar no mine either um so just so
people got that it&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>eight grams per kilogram of body weight
right</p>
<p>uh uh point per pound
okay so you add that calculation so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>0.8
grams per pound of body weight</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the upper upper
threshold and</p>
<p>you know for if you are like really
doing a lot of like exercise then you</p>
<p>could also get for like one gram per
bond</p>
<p>but uh 0.8 is already at least the
research shows that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already optimal those okay at the
maximum and the</p>
<p>and the minimum would i would say is
like 0.6 or 0.7</p>
<p>yeah per gram yeah so if you if your
metabolism</p>
<p>is uh let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re um your digestion
is really bad and um</p>
<p>you have problems digesting protein you
maybe you need to go a little lighter</p>
<p>than that
kind of vary depending on what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on with your physiology
yeah absolutely yeah like um yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very individual based
thing so if you if if a person like i</p>
<p>would
i would i still find a lot of merit from</p>
<p>doing like a very strict keto diet like
the therapeutic keto that</p>
<p>for people who have like some insulin
resistance some severe diabetes or</p>
<p>like epilepsy and those things and yeah
if they do have like</p>
<p>uh some problems digesting protein then
yeah for sure keeping the protein more</p>
<p>moderate is uh better
in a sense because uh at that point you</p>
<p>can still
leverage a lot of the anti-catabolic</p>
<p>effects of the ketosis
itself as well absolutely</p>
<p>another question people always ask is
that</p>
<p>if i take mct oil during a fast
will that break my fast</p>
<p>i get that so often i just want to see
your intake on that</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a common question and uh you
know</p>
<p>mcts are like a really interesting like
substance</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not like
they have a very thermic effect so they</p>
<p>raise your metabolism
uh because of being converted into</p>
<p>energy really rapidly so they bypass
some of the steps in digestion and</p>
<p>energy production
so uh they&rsquo;re they get converted into</p>
<p>energy really fast and you know a lot of
the times</p>
<p>if people take too much mct oil then
they can also get the runs</p>
<p>so uh go goes out really quick as well
but generally from the the uh calorie</p>
<p>perspective like the calories
it depends on like what you what you</p>
<p>mean by breaking the fast right
right it has calories so therefore it</p>
<p>could break a fast
but at the same time it doesn&rsquo;t spike</p>
<p>insulin it doesn&rsquo;t raise blood sugar
it actually boosts ketone body</p>
<p>production and it also
stimulates some aspects of atovaj so</p>
<p>there are there&rsquo;s a different kind
different type of autophagy called</p>
<p>chaperone mediated autophagy
which is uh like a subcategory and it</p>
<p>targets specifically certain amino acids
so uh like rather than going for</p>
<p>like rather than going for like this
macroautophagy you would go for</p>
<p>more of a very specific type of
autophagy that</p>
<p>like recycles amino acids specifically
so i think the</p>
<p>having like some mct oil in your coffee
or something</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s not a problem in my opinion
as long as you&rsquo;re not really over doing</p>
<p>the calories so like one
one tablespoon of mct oil is a pretty</p>
<p>fine in my opinion and it&rsquo;s actually a
boost it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>boosts a lot of the like the goals of
the fast by putting you into deeper</p>
<p>ketosis
and uh turning on some atovaj as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting that&rsquo;s great um
your your book you have a new one coming</p>
<p>out right i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s released
yet i think it&rsquo;s called the stronger by</p>
<p>stress is that coming up is that out yet
no it&rsquo;s coming out in august in the</p>
<p>middle of august
oh okay good so then we can actually um</p>
<p>talk um we can actually bring it up at
the</p>
<p>event um and so you also have
quite a few books um how many books do</p>
<p>you have out
uh well it&rsquo;s uh like five i would say</p>
<p>five
yeah and so the i think the one that</p>
<p>seems to be the most popular i know it&rsquo;s
the uh metabolic autophagy is that the</p>
<p>one that uh
yeah yeah it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s my latest book</p>
<p>and yes it&rsquo;s the most
comprehensive and uh the biggest</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna just recommend that
everyone get that book and i&rsquo;m gonna put</p>
<p>a link down below
simply because it autophagy</p>
<p>understanding it can make you live
longer</p>
<p>it can actually help you prevent so many
problems it could</p>
<p>increase your performance um your
your anti-aging i mean it&rsquo;s just so many</p>
<p>things and i think
you&rsquo;ve done an exhaustive study i</p>
<p>appreciate that
as i went through it i&rsquo;m like boy you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done some serious research on this i
mean like you&rsquo;ve looked at everything</p>
<p>and
um because it takes a lot of time to dig</p>
<p>out all this stuff and summarize it and
communicate in a way that everyone can</p>
<p>get it
so i&rsquo;m like thank you for summarizing</p>
<p>the whole topic into
one book um yeah i mean how many hours</p>
<p>did you put into that book
uh well i did like a lot of research</p>
<p>beforehand so i was already writing out
articles</p>
<p>for like a few weeks and then i took
like a small break</p>
<p>uh from from writing because i didn&rsquo;t i
didn&rsquo;t plan on writing a book</p>
<p>but like i saw that there was like a lot
of uh</p>
<p>misconceptions about the autophagy and just
myths and uh</p>
<p>rumors so i wanted to kind of refute
them like one of one of them being that</p>
<p>autophagy is only good that you want to turn
on autophagy all the time</p>
<p>for the rest of your life which isn&rsquo;t
true like we talked about earlier in</p>
<p>this
podcast that uh sometimes this can</p>
<p>actually be harmful
so yeah you have to find out like the</p>
<p>optimal balance between it
and uh know how to balance it with like</p>
<p>mTOR
and just the adequate nutrient intake</p>
<p>awesome
this has been awesome so thank you so</p>
<p>much for your time and
hopefully everyone could make it to the</p>
<p>uh summit coming up in
at the end of august i&rsquo;ll put the links</p>
<p>down below and then you have a very
amazing presentation that uh</p>
<p>um everyone needs to be there because
you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;re gonna go through this</p>
<p>topic extensively because i saw the
slides</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite quite exciting so thank
you so much</p>
<p>yeah yeah i&rsquo;m looking forward to it and
yeah thanks for having me</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
