<p>Ôªøso welcome everyone we have another</p>
<p>amazing interview Michelle welcome so</p>
<p>you sent me here before and afters there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed I wanted to do I</p>
<p>wanted to find out about your your</p>
<p>history of what what happened that you</p>
<p>start gaining weight when you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>little bit younger maybe you could tell</p>
<p>me about that and tell me your story</p>
<p>okay well um I I would say that I always</p>
<p>had a weight problem but looking back in</p>
<p>pictures I think it was in my mind right</p>
<p>and I really started noticing it in my</p>
<p>college years you know the famous</p>
<p>freshman 30 well nine when grew up there</p>
<p>it could be because I&rsquo;m from Louisiana</p>
<p>and I was going to school in New Orleans</p>
<p>so okay that makes us yes it could have</p>
<p>been that but what I did notice was over</p>
<p>the years I had all of the stuff that</p>
<p>you explained the high estrogen the</p>
<p>heavy heavy cycle fibroids all of that</p>
<p>stuff and I always had to struggle with</p>
<p>weight I wasn&rsquo;t really a dieter because</p>
<p>I just I just don&rsquo;t believe in it but I</p>
<p>would try to do what I thought was</p>
<p>healthy eating which in hindsight it</p>
<p>really wasn&rsquo;t I had a lot of high stress</p>
<p>jobs after college and grad school and</p>
<p>it just it kind of like inched up you</p>
<p>know so I was okay here then in my 30s I</p>
<p>guess you know who does better I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>my age I have a problem with that I just</p>
<p>decided to you know like by sheer force</p>
<p>of will go to the gym everyday and get</p>
<p>it you know get it controlled and that</p>
<p>was still struggle I changed careers so</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m a full time on author and</p>
<p>consultant and I sit all the time and I</p>
<p>will just tell this quick little story</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll permit me um it was December</p>
<p>31st 2016 last year</p>
<p>and I had just come back from a cruise</p>
<p>and normally when I take my cruises I</p>
<p>can walk I can do all the stuff dr. Berg</p>
<p>I was so um sick I slept like two days</p>
<p>straight on the ship it was a chore to</p>
<p>walk from my side of the ship to where</p>
<p>the food was and I had the nerve to be</p>
<p>upset about that and it was just a</p>
<p>different different thing I didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>get to get off the ship to go to any of</p>
<p>the ports and that kind of stuff and I</p>
<p>kept getting severe leg thigh and calf</p>
<p>cramps and by this time my brain fog was</p>
<p>so bad I remember I would like get up to</p>
<p>go and get something and by the time I</p>
<p>got to the next room I would have</p>
<p>totally completely forgotten why I was</p>
<p>in there Wow</p>
<p>yeah and so it was really bad so get</p>
<p>back from the cruise and I get on the</p>
<p>scale and that was my my breaking point</p>
<p>I think because the scale said are you</p>
<p>ready for this I&rsquo;m only five I&rsquo;m am five</p>
<p>six some more like five five and a half</p>
<p>and my scale said I was 249 pounds oh</p>
<p>wow that was probably freaked me out</p>
<p>right there yes yeah that&rsquo;s what I was</p>
<p>just like you know okay I can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>and like I said I write for a living I</p>
<p>write you know novels and so I sit a lot</p>
<p>what I realized was something had to</p>
<p>change and I was watching a YouTube</p>
<p>video on doing some research for a book</p>
<p>it was December 31st and this ad comes</p>
<p>up are you having these symptoms no way</p>
<p>yes and I never really watched ads and</p>
<p>then it has a little pictures of the</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s you know little play-doh bodies</p>
<p>and it had click here to take this</p>
<p>evaluation and right am I getting punked</p>
<p>you know because it was everything I was</p>
<p>going through and no one had ever</p>
<p>explained that to me so I went through</p>
<p>and all of that and I&rsquo;m going to just</p>
<p>you know you can edit this out if you</p>
<p>want to dr. Perry felt a little hot with</p>
<p>you and the reason why was because you</p>
<p>got it kinda like you get your mouth and</p>
<p>I want to do the sweet here you get your</p>
<p>mouth all ready for that cake and you</p>
<p>bite into it and there&rsquo;s nothing so I</p>
<p>was so excited I wanted more information</p>
<p>I tried to get on the membership website</p>
<p>and it told me it was an error and what</p>
<p>I found out was like I said this is a</p>
<p>little embarrassing I was trying to sign</p>
<p>in on January 1st and whatever program</p>
<p>was running the membership had not</p>
<p>updated to be able to reflect 2017 Wow</p>
<p>it kept telling me you can&rsquo;t get in here</p>
<p>so anyway one of your staff persons just</p>
<p>happen to come in on the on January 1st</p>
<p>and saw I guess mine and a few others</p>
<p>and got a soft subtle and I will tell</p>
<p>you I spent all day January 1st of this</p>
<p>year 2017 just Netflix in dr. Burke I</p>
<p>had never heard of you before then to be</p>
<p>honest and I just want to say Nestle say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about I stopped writing all</p>
<p>I did was that and I will tell you I</p>
<p>realized I had become a sugar addict</p>
<p>when I went back and looked I had not</p>
<p>eaten real food in about three days it</p>
<p>was so bad I was sitting there with a</p>
<p>can of sweetened condensed milk just</p>
<p>eating it out of the can so you know I</p>
<p>mean I just be open right hey</p>
<p>I mean I would go I would go like to</p>
<p>Walmart late at night because I needed</p>
<p>my fix because I was writing books on</p>
<p>pure sugar and I would like to have 50</p>
<p>bucks worth of candy and when I say</p>
<p>candy I like</p>
<p>the hard crunchy you know like cinnamons</p>
<p>and you know and that kind of stuff</p>
<p>because I was like just</p>
<p>I was mainlining sugar basically now</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t so you definitely were not oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing yeah I remember uh</p>
<p>actually my thing and college was the</p>
<p>jumbo bag of Doritos I would eat the</p>
<p>whole thing I&rsquo;m some serious like one</p>
<p>big pack down it just like that and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always wondered what my fingers were</p>
<p>swollen like like blow up like balloon</p>
<p>and I was retaining flour I&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the MSG I was like addicted yeah you</p>
<p>helped me get off of the nuri toes</p>
<p>bunions the lady&rsquo;s chips and all of that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just going to tell you now I</p>
<p>walk down the sugar aisle at Walmart now</p>
<p>and I just do it just to see you know</p>
<p>just you know and I&rsquo;m like yeah I got</p>
<p>nothing on me wow that&rsquo;s control well</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s control as</p>
<p>much as it is reframing and when I say</p>
<p>reframing you don&rsquo;t I yeah my years of</p>
<p>therapy</p>
<p>yeah a therapist I&rsquo;m you know consulting</p>
<p>myself and making sure I use the I word</p>
<p>I did not realize how thick I was until</p>
<p>I started getting healthy</p>
<p>I had tingling in my hands and feet I</p>
<p>had on the like except tux before the</p>
<p>heavy cycle the brain fog the muscle</p>
<p>spasms all of the stuff that is</p>
<p>indicative of having just being right at</p>
<p>the point of having the issues and I was</p>
<p>winded all the time because I really was</p>
<p>not moving I was like I am like self I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in a self-mummification kind of thing</p>
<p>here yeah um was that when you were</p>
<p>still writing too were you writing them</p>
<p>as well keeping rewriting at that point</p>
<p>yeah see that was a thinning</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a self-published romance</p>
<p>author and that cycle is very fast so</p>
<p>for me I need to basically publish a</p>
<p>novel each month and so sitting 14 hours</p>
<p>a day writing on average anywhere from</p>
<p>five to ten thousand words because when</p>
<p>I say novel I mean I&rsquo;m writing hundred</p>
<p>and ten thousand more novels and</p>
<p>publishing each month so it was just</p>
<p>like just feed the Machine to get it</p>
<p>done and I was on this this rat race and</p>
<p>I could not oh one other thing I when I</p>
<p>would take my shower and you know how</p>
<p>hot water will raise your pressure I had</p>
<p>to be careful because I fell a few times</p>
<p>you know from just being so out of shape</p>
<p>having the hot water affecting my heart</p>
<p>and everything and I was like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to die in the shower and if someone</p>
<p>have to come find me and I&rsquo;m this bad oh</p>
<p>my gosh how did you how did you because</p>
<p>you have to have creativity when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you have to really how did you</p>
<p>because it with all that sugar it would</p>
<p>put someone literally in a brain fog on</p>
<p>steroids how did you do it like I said</p>
<p>it was pure force of will and you know</p>
<p>when I had deadlines and there were such</p>
<p>a big penalty if you don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make the deadline like you know</p>
<p>penalized and this kind of stuff um I</p>
<p>would do what I could and then take a</p>
<p>nap do what I could and the old that was</p>
<p>another thing my sleep quality was</p>
<p>horrific I could not get good sleep I</p>
<p>would try and I just could not get good</p>
<p>sleep Wow</p>
<p>yeah so like I said it was it was really</p>
<p>really bad and I don&rsquo;t know if you can</p>
<p>tell I&rsquo;ve got this mic in the way but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this mic in the way but the</p>
<p>little thing that I didn&rsquo;t take for</p>
<p>granted like neck you know the stuff you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fake right right like the neck</p>
<p>rolls it doctor</p>
<p>so now yeah now I&rsquo;m like a cheerleader</p>
<p>for all things Kido</p>
<p>all things dr. Berger genius</p>
<p>I just tell everybody like this man just</p>
<p>just go he is he is doing a universal</p>
<p>good wow that&rsquo;s awesome so so okay you</p>
<p>started watching the video to start</p>
<p>becoming aware of what you need to do</p>
<p>realize you&rsquo;re a sugar crack I mean a</p>
<p>sugar a junkie and yes Oh sugar crack it</p>
<p>was and so then so then basically you</p>
<p>started and did you start with the keto</p>
<p>first or the intermittent fasting how</p>
<p>did you like do this okay</p>
<p>so what I did was first I started off</p>
<p>and I got your supplements I mean when I</p>
<p>said I&rsquo;ve got the supplements I went</p>
<p>full bore in and got the supplements and</p>
<p>started with Keogh and I have to thank</p>
<p>you and Karen for the wonderful recipes</p>
<p>and so I had to relearn how to cook for</p>
<p>myself and started with all those</p>
<p>recipes and you know I had to like go</p>
<p>and figure out where to find some of the</p>
<p>stuff but I did and I will say January</p>
<p>and February I didn&rsquo;t really exercise I</p>
<p>just ate and I did not stop the snacking</p>
<p>and when I say the smacking it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sugar or the bad stuff but it was things</p>
<p>like okay so for instance January I had</p>
<p>to learn that you cannot eat a bag of</p>
<p>extra gum I don&rsquo;t believe the sugar-free</p>
<p>if a lot of people it&rsquo;s a lie and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say okay why why is it not working I</p>
<p>mean I lost nine pounds at month but I a</p>
<p>not wanted to I want us to stuff like</p>
<p>the other you know big girl the big</p>
<p>fluffy girls like me and okay oh we lost</p>
<p>nine pounds well I was eating thirty</p>
<p>pieces</p>
<p>gum a day because I still knew that you</p>
<p>know that choo-choo kind of thing so I</p>
<p>learned that you helped me with that</p>
<p>Febuary see you can tell I had seen four</p>
<p>hours to winter in February I had to</p>
<p>learn that dr. Byrd is not trying to be</p>
<p>mean stop snacking so I went down to</p>
<p>three mill I lost 12 pounds in February</p>
<p>now mind you I was still not walking I</p>
<p>was still in exercising snow that March</p>
<p>I had to go to a conference and I was</p>
<p>like you know what if I should look like</p>
<p>this this is not gonna be cute and so I</p>
<p>started trying to walk and I would get</p>
<p>so winded it was really bad but I</p>
<p>actually started saying you know if I</p>
<p>could just get a mile in I&rsquo;ll be okay</p>
<p>so in March I started walking</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t until and I&rsquo;m gonna just be</p>
<p>honest with you it wasn&rsquo;t until the end</p>
<p>of April this is four months the end of</p>
<p>April then I was able to even consider</p>
<p>looking at intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so in May Oh so from January to April</p>
<p>I lost 28 pounds which was phenomenal</p>
<p>for me and I started feeling better but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still doing the three meals and not</p>
<p>really consistently doing daily movement</p>
<p>in May and June and now here I actually</p>
<p>started walking each day and now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working up to what I call vlogging and</p>
<p>doing some little weights and stuff in</p>
<p>so as of today I&rsquo;m just under 60 pounds</p>
<p>total loss</p>
<p>since yeah since and so for the women</p>
<p>out there you guys I was killing a size</p>
<p>18 women and now I&rsquo;m in a loose size 10</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s fantastic so on I just want</p>
<p>to say that I think one of the</p>
<p>breakthroughs for me was not about the</p>
<p>gold it wasn&rsquo;t about the objectives of</p>
<p>trying to lose the way it was more so</p>
<p>you said and some of</p>
<p>videos that weight gain is indicative of</p>
<p>illness or disease disease and so I</p>
<p>focus on that and I was like you know if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s weight here it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>unhealthy and so that I think the reason</p>
<p>why I can walk down a little sugar aisle</p>
<p>and go on to these conferences and</p>
<p>everybody around you is ordering</p>
<p>cheesecake and just all the sugar and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like no I&rsquo;m fine and I&rsquo;ve gone to</p>
<p>two two conferences this year and was</p>
<p>still able to eat keto on my trip that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s so fantastic you know the when</p>
<p>they say an average person ate 145</p>
<p>pounds of sugar and you probably fit</p>
<p>that and more but then I can tell you I</p>
<p>probably because I started trying to</p>
<p>calculate it and I got depressed because</p>
<p>in a given day now I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>this is this is how you can trick your</p>
<p>mind I don&rsquo;t drink sugary drinks or</p>
<p>sodas and stuff never never really help</p>
<p>so I was telling myself I was okay but</p>
<p>when I could eat a bag of Twizzlers in a</p>
<p>day high Smalley&rsquo;s and red hot candies</p>
<p>and you know a little cinnamon dead skin</p>
<p>the Werther&rsquo;s high you know choc I mean</p>
<p>terrible and all of that I mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about bag wow that was I was I</p>
<p>was amazed I was still alive to be</p>
<p>honest yeah I&rsquo;m just blown away are you</p>
<p>funny now how many meals are you doing</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m one wow that&rsquo;s amazing one meal</p>
<p>a day um and you actually helped me</p>
<p>understand that it was my metabolism</p>
<p>because all through my life I would</p>
<p>actually forget to eat and so trying to</p>
<p>do the three meals I felt pressure to do</p>
<p>it and I felt like I&rsquo;m doing this</p>
<p>because someone said to do it and so</p>
<p>when I decided I was going to go to</p>
<p>intermittent fasting in May</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m feeling I think healthy enough</p>
<p>I tried that Emil it was still too much</p>
<p>and because I wasn&rsquo;t hungry I was like</p>
<p>why am i eating if I&rsquo;m not hungry and so</p>
<p>now what I do is based on what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned from you and the membership and</p>
<p>you know getting making sure I have my</p>
<p>supplements and stuff I feel a little</p>
<p>more empowered to do the one meal</p>
<p>because I make sure that I have the</p>
<p>necessary component so in order to get</p>
<p>you know my seven cups of vegetables I</p>
<p>always have a kale and spinach shake so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three of my cups there and then I</p>
<p>have the other four cups in a healthy</p>
<p>salad and my proteins I&rsquo;ll do um oh you</p>
<p>taught me a little bit about you know</p>
<p>the different types of proteins with the</p>
<p>meat I was never real red knee person</p>
<p>but I was killing chicken and so now I</p>
<p>have learned to mix up chicken with</p>
<p>other meats even you know breakfast</p>
<p>chops and things like that that all</p>
<p>black in and those types of things and</p>
<p>just really having a variety my my</p>
<p>relationship with cauliflower has</p>
<p>blossomed and so just a lot of great</p>
<p>things and so what I try to do each day</p>
<p>is make sure that I have a meal that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>between 12 600 1200 and 1600 calories</p>
<p>and I do that by having cheese nuts my</p>
<p>kale spinach shake a salad and then a</p>
<p>healthy fat so like if that means I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have like a little bit of avocado or you</p>
<p>know guacamole but you know a soup or</p>
<p>something like that you know just a</p>
<p>supplement then that&rsquo;s how I do it</p>
<p>awesome now right now you&rsquo;re continuing</p>
<p>to write how was your creativity now</p>
<p>compared to before</p>
<p>okay so last year I struggled through</p>
<p>and I wrote nine novel for the year this</p>
<p>is July and I have already written seven</p>
<p>all of them sugar-free and Wow it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Apple so your cognitive function is much</p>
<p>better of course</p>
<p>yes definitely I have actually had</p>
<p>conversations with authors for just that</p>
<p>fact and the reason why is because with</p>
<p>the way creativity works you know bear</p>
<p>patients with me on this you find that</p>
<p>and and I tell them look we are mortal</p>
<p>beings pooping out immortality there is</p>
<p>a price to be paid for that birth and a</p>
<p>lot of times it will trigger anxiety</p>
<p>depression panic attacks and those types</p>
<p>of things because you have to be</p>
<p>creative on a dime and in time and when</p>
<p>you have that pressure it can mount and</p>
<p>all of those hormones and all of that</p>
<p>stuff going on inside if you&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating right um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad and so we have bad habit as</p>
<p>authors that I think this way of living</p>
<p>just a minute uh nature of it eradicate</p>
<p>that you know so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that I would say about the</p>
<p>creative process it is a hand-in-hand</p>
<p>kind of thing because of the clarity</p>
<p>that you get because of the energy that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to sustain because of the</p>
<p>guilt listening of okay oh one of the</p>
<p>things that I want to say is when I talk</p>
<p>about guiltlessness when we write you</p>
<p>know and we&rsquo;re forgetting to eat you go</p>
<p>to what the quickest the easiest and</p>
<p>traditionally that is going to be</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s not very helpful</p>
<p>whether it be fast food or snacks or</p>
<p>those types of things and so now because</p>
<p>of eating ketogenic Lee and for me in a</p>
<p>minute fasting if I pure quote unquote</p>
<p>forget to eat I know what my meal is</p>
<p>going to be and I know that I am eating</p>
<p>to really actually feel the machine to</p>
<p>make sure I get my potassium in and my K</p>
<p>me too thank you for teaching me to make</p>
<p>sure I take those by the way and all</p>
<p>those other things so yeah I hope I</p>
<p>answered that question yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing that&rsquo;s awesome so you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a common thread like your</p>
<p>awareness is so high now and now you</p>
<p>have the knowledge of exactly what to do</p>
<p>and how to get to where you really need</p>
<p>to go</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ve felt that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced it you know it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>because you you see it and wow it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>a story amazing um it must be something</p>
<p>about the eating because now when people</p>
<p>see me and they see my skin and all of</p>
<p>that kind of stuff they&rsquo;re like what are</p>
<p>you doing and she really opened it up</p>
<p>you know for whoever might see this I am</p>
<p>NOT young I am I&rsquo;m 48 and to be able to</p>
<p>have all of the like collagen I mean</p>
<p>none of this is going on it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>flabbiness and you know that&rsquo;s weird I</p>
<p>set up this this was the true test that</p>
<p>it was working I always and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you can see this they guess that back</p>
<p>ok so you know you can&rsquo;t fake the neck</p>
<p>or like arms and stuff and for women</p>
<p>this is gone you know you get the little</p>
<p>fat pocket right that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>weirdest things when you notice a fat</p>
<p>pocket is going you like yeah yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re I mean I just saw the picture of</p>
<p>your face before and after me like you</p>
<p>could just see this everything&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>down it&rsquo;s dramatic it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing I I</p>
<p>mean I have people saying you know you</p>
<p>look so much younger I mean of course</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rocking my gray and of course this</p>
<p>is my workout hair doctor bird but right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something when other people can</p>
<p>see the health and that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to say I&rsquo;m not concerned</p>
<p>as much about you know them seeing oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing weight no it&rsquo;s the health</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the quality of the clarity in my</p>
<p>eyes and my</p>
<p>and you know the vitality that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>back and that&rsquo;s one of the biggest</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;m very grateful for um</p>
<p>what if Bob Marley&rsquo;s saying his death</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t buy life you can&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>so for me being preventative now is a</p>
<p>blessing and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a gift</p>
<p>that it just keeps on giving it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>helping me be you know able to produce</p>
<p>and do what I do and chai is really</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s awesome yeah I think</p>
<p>the just if anyone is watching this and</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t watched some of the other</p>
<p>videos the principles you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is get healthy to lose weight not</p>
<p>lose weight to get healthy it&rsquo;s a simple</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s an altered sequence that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been brainwashed to say that oh</p>
<p>yeah obesity is a health risk and you</p>
<p>know you need to lose weight to get</p>
<p>healthy well oh really going to starve</p>
<p>yourself to get healthy but if you get</p>
<p>healthy the right way fixing insulin</p>
<p>resistance that&rsquo;s the big thing the</p>
<p>weight will come off and and you start</p>
<p>feeling good and you get all the</p>
<p>benefits I mean the benefits are huge</p>
<p>but until you do it you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know it so anyone watching just you just</p>
<p>need to bite the bullet jump in do it</p>
<p>drink the kool-aid no not the kool-aid</p>
<p>sugar free cooling exactly so I wanted</p>
<p>to just really thank you I mean I you</p>
<p>know words can&rsquo;t even express it but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to attempt to say that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even about weight loss again it is about</p>
<p>the fact that I am I have been freed</p>
<p>from a lot of the haunts of my family</p>
<p>diabetes heart condition high blood</p>
<p>pressure in those types of things and I</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>flirting that closely with those</p>
<p>symptoms who&rsquo;s a wake-up call for me and</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s only been six months I mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not where I totally want to be but I</p>
<p>am on a forward consistent movement and</p>
<p>this is not a diet</p>
<p>this is sustainable for the rest of my</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very helpful and I don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>and why I don&rsquo;t have that I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recognize how much of a burden in the</p>
<p>back of my mind that that was a worry</p>
<p>that I would end up with those symptoms</p>
<p>or those conditions and now I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that concern well so doesn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the fear of constants here am I going</p>
<p>to get this that whole thing cuz you</p>
<p>know yeah yeah awesome Michelle thank</p>
