    <p>The following is an AMA episode</p>
<p>where I answer a few questions that folks asked</p>
<p>on Patreon, YouTube, and other social networks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do these episodes on occasion</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s of interest to anyone at all.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>Brooklyn and Sheets, Indeed hiring website,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN, and Theragun muscle recovery device.</p>
<p>So the choice is sleep, employment,</p>
<p>privacy, or muscle recovery.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And if you wish, click the sponsor links below</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but I give you timestamps, so if you skip,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors</p>
<p>by clicking the links in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you by Brooklyn and Sheets.</p>
<p>Sleep has increasingly become a source of joy for me</p>
<p>with the Asleep self-cooling bed</p>
<p>and now these incredibly smooth,</p>
<p>buttery smooth as they call them,</p>
<p>cozy Brooklyn and Sheets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often slept on the carpet</p>
<p>without anything but a jacket and jeans,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not exactly the world&rsquo;s greatest expert in comfort.</p>
<p>But these sheets have been an amazing upgrade</p>
<p>over anything I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<p>Even the adult sheets I&rsquo;ve actually purchased</p>
<p>at some point in my life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a variety of colors, patterns,</p>
<p>and material variants to choose from.</p>
<p>They have over 50,000 five-star reviews.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for those, by the way.</p>
<p>In other words, people love them.</p>
<p>So they suggest that you should do something nice</p>
<p>for yourself to start the new year.</p>
<p>To help you with that, Brooklyn has a special offer.</p>
<p>Go to brooklyn.com and use promo code Lex</p>
<p>to get $25 off when you spend $100 or more,</p>
<p>plus free shipping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brooklyn.com and enter promo code Lex</p>
<p>to get 25 bucks off when you spend $100 or more,</p>
<p>plus free shipping.</p>
<p>I guess I said that twice.</p>
<p>brooklyn.com and use promo code Lex at checkout.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them as part of all the hiring efforts I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>for the engineering teams I&rsquo;ve led in recent years.</p>
<p>The main point is to go from the initial posting</p>
<p>to a short list of great candidates as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they accomplish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they help you with.</p>
<p>They search through millions of resumes</p>
<p>and instantly show you good candidates.</p>
<p>And Indeed delivers four times more hires</p>
<p>than all other job sites combined,</p>
<p>according to Talent Nest.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first really difficult step,</p>
<p>which is getting a good pool of candidates.</p>
<p>I think the most important part is the final steps</p>
<p>and figuring out out of that pool,</p>
<p>which is the actual perfect candidate.</p>
<p>And you do that by going through the interviewing process.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s on you, or that&rsquo;s on me if I&rsquo;m hiring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about this process myself.</p>
<p>I actually kind of enjoy the engineering aspect</p>
<p>of this process, but honestly,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more art than science.</p>
<p>Anyway, right now, listeners get a free $75 credit</p>
<p>to upgrade your job post.</p>
<p>If you go to indeed.com slash Friedman,</p>
<p>however the heck you spell my last name,</p>
<p>this is Indeed&rsquo;s best offer available anywhere.</p>
<p>Get a free $75 credit at indeed.com slash Friedman,</p>
<p>indeed.com slash Friedman.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.</p>
<p>There is no E in there,</p>
<p>but you can just click the link in the description.</p>
<p>Offer is valid through March 31st of this year.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually said that in an ad.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>I assume as all proper citizens must.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read all of the terms and conditions, of course.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Most of us have very little choice</p>
<p>of an ISP, internet service provider.</p>
<p>They operate like monopolies in the regions they serve.</p>
<p>They then use this monopoly power</p>
<p>to take advantage of customers.</p>
<p>Data caps, streaming throttles, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But worst of all, many ISPs log your internet activity</p>
<p>and sell that data, which they can legally,</p>
<p>onto other big tech companies or advertisers.</p>
<p>To prevent ISPs from seeing my internet activity,</p>
<p>I protect my devices with ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for many years on Windows,</p>
<p>yes, Windows, Linux, and Android,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s available everywhere else too.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s been fast and easy to use.</p>
<p>One big power on button that&rsquo;s fun to press,</p>
<p>probably my favorite intuitive design of an app.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t try to do more than it needs to,</p>
<p>but it gets the job done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign of a good design.</p>
<p>Go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>to get an extra three months free on a one year package.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s expressvpn.com slash LexPod.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Theragun,</p>
<p>a handheld percussive therapy device</p>
<p>that I use after hard running</p>
<p>or body weight exercise sessions</p>
<p>for muscle recovery and easing muscle tension.</p>
<p>A lot of elite athletes use it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also good for regular folks like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly quiet, easy to use,</p>
<p>comes with a great app that guides you</p>
<p>through everything you need to know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ramping back up on the whole exercise thing,</p>
<p>cutting a bit of weight,</p>
<p>either running or doing body weight exercises, often both.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this,</p>
<p>but mostly running is great at getting me</p>
<p>to let go of any silly negative thoughts</p>
<p>I might be holding onto.</p>
<p>Anyway, Theragun is a part of the muscle recovery</p>
<p>in this process.</p>
<p>Try them for 30 days.</p>
<p>There is no substitute for the Theragun Gen 4</p>
<p>with an OLED screen, personalized Theragun app,</p>
<p>and the quiet power you need.</p>
<p>That sounds really badass, but also happens to be true.</p>
<p>Starting at $190, go to theragun.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s theragun.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>And now, on to the AMA episode</p>
<p>with the questions and the answers.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>The question is, Lex,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a young man that has battled with depression.</p>
<p>Do you think when trying to develop a human-like AI,</p>
<p>we will reach a stumbling point</p>
<p>where the AI themselves suffer from depression</p>
<p>and other complex mental issues?</p>
<p>Do you think it will be a simple fix</p>
<p>like rewriting a piece of code or a new patch or update?</p>
<p>Or maybe when trying to create something human-like</p>
<p>with high fidelity, you need to leave in the possibility</p>
<p>of the AI suffering from such complex mental issues</p>
<p>that a human can.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts generally and philosophically</p>
<p>about AI suffering from depression?</p>
<p>I think that suffering is a deep fundamental property</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>I would like to probably say quite a bit about depression.</p>
<p>I have friends who suffer from depression,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s for another time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for when we talk about depression in humans.</p>
<p>I think depression is just one flavor of suffering</p>
<p>that is part of the human condition.</p>
<p>I see it as a kind of dark side street</p>
<p>on the path to intelligence.</p>
<p>So in terms of robot suffering,</p>
<p>if we are to create systems that are truly intelligent</p>
<p>in the way that they&rsquo;re able to interact</p>
<p>in intelligent and deeply meaningful ways</p>
<p>with other humans, it&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>many of the properties, many of the characteristics</p>
<p>of the human condition, of the full human experience.</p>
<p>I think depression is part of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s of course a part in us humans</p>
<p>that longs to remove all that is cruel in this world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people that believe in God,</p>
<p>often the biggest question is of why does God</p>
<p>allow there to be suffering in the world?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this longing to understand</p>
<p>why is there so much unfairness in this world?</p>
<p>And so building on that, there&rsquo;s an inclination</p>
<p>to then in our systems engineer something</p>
<p>that is void of those things that we cannot understand</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s part of the human condition.</p>
<p>But I think it is intricately part</p>
<p>of the experience that is to be human.</p>
<p>And I think if we were to build intelligence systems</p>
<p>that are interacting with humans,</p>
<p>there has to be in some ways properties</p>
<p>of consciousness baked in.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re to have properties of consciousness baked in,</p>
<p>we have to have the full mystery</p>
<p>and uncertainty of the human experience,</p>
<p>which yes, includes all the different flavors</p>
<p>of suffering of which depression is part.</p>
<p>I think the yin and the yang in all of its versions,</p>
<p>the ups and downs of moods,</p>
<p>but also the more sort of rational intellectual</p>
<p>interpretations of different concepts</p>
<p>that are less sort of dramatic,</p>
<p>all have to oscillate back and forth.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where the interesting aspect</p>
<p>of interactions happens.</p>
<p>Just like when I have conversations in the podcast,</p>
<p>the interesting stuff happens when there&rsquo;s disagreements,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a bit of turmoil,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a push and pull,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a changing of minds,</p>
<p>or even just a morphing of your own opinions</p>
<p>about something, your own thoughts.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>So I really do think all of that mess of humanity</p>
<p>has to be engineered in,</p>
<p>into AI systems that are interacting with humans</p>
<p>and are trying to create meaningful interactions</p>
<p>with those humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s of course a huge amount of AI systems</p>
<p>that are going to be more intelligent</p>
<p>than humans at particular tasks.</p>
<p>Those do not need to have those properties</p>
<p>of the human experience,</p>
<p>like suffering and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But for the ones that move among us,</p>
<p>I think unfortunately depression</p>
<p>has to be part of the experience,</p>
<p>or the possibility of depression</p>
<p>has to be part of the experience.</p>
<p>Of course I tend to focus on the positive aspects</p>
<p>of the human experience,</p>
<p>like love, beauty, joy, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the yin and the yang.</p>
<p>They go together.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lifelong partners, unfortunately, I think.</p>
<p>Now of course all of this is just hypothesis,</p>
<p>and most of my answers to all of these questions</p>
<p>are going to be just my own thoughts,</p>
<p>but I am thinking about all of this</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ll have more to say in the future</p>
<p>about how we actually build these kinds of things</p>
<p>into our AI systems that interact with humans.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>Question is, Lex, I was wondering</p>
<p>if you would be willing to talk</p>
<p>about your immigrant experience.</p>
<p>I myself started off as an international student</p>
<p>studying and working in America,</p>
<p>not from Russia, I&rsquo;m from India,</p>
<p>but there was a constant push and pull</p>
<p>that I experienced given my life circumstance.</p>
<p>I would be curious to hear how you assimilated.</p>
<p>Do you feel like you belong, et cetera?</p>
<p>Thank you for the AMA.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Your statements about do you feel like you belong</p>
<p>hit hard for some reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of late at night,</p>
<p>maybe because I&rsquo;m a bit over-caffeinated.</p>
<p>Maybe what pops to mind to focus on</p>
<p>is the aspect of loneliness, the aspect of belonging.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us in the early teenage years</p>
<p>go through that process of feeling like an outsider,</p>
<p>an outcast of different kinds.</p>
<p>I think it hit me the hardest personally</p>
<p>because I was a popular kid in Russia,</p>
<p>and when we moved here,</p>
<p>I went to the opposite of being popular,</p>
<p>or feeling like that, I felt like an outcast.</p>
<p>The place I moved to in America had more of an emphasis,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a cultural thing,</p>
<p>of emphasizing material possessions</p>
<p>over two things that were deeply meaningful to me,</p>
<p>which is human connection, like friendship,</p>
<p>and also knowledge, like mathematics</p>
<p>and scientific discovery, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the emphasis of what was valued was different,</p>
<p>and that for me was a catalyst to feel like a total outcast,</p>
<p>as opposed to being this person</p>
<p>who looks out into the world</p>
<p>and enjoys the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>I kind of went to this brooding phase of,</p>
<p>first of all, learning the English language,</p>
<p>but starting to read books, more philosophical books.</p>
<p>The first one I remember reading in English was The Giver.</p>
<p>That sort of helped me start thinking about this world.</p>
<p>I was so fortunate to be so in love with people for so long,</p>
<p>and have close friends in Russia,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t notice in my childhood</p>
<p>how deeply alone we all are.</p>
<p>So for me, the immigrant experience</p>
<p>involved in a small way, at least the first,</p>
<p>realizing that hard human truth</p>
<p>that we all are born alone, live alone, die alone.</p>
<p>Even when we&rsquo;re in the arms of somebody we love,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still somehow fundamentally alone</p>
<p>with our thoughts, with our hopes, with our fears,</p>
<p>trapped in this conscious meat vessel between our ears.</p>
<p>I think the immigrant experience for me</p>
<p>was the catalyst to realizing and being terrified</p>
<p>and also liberated by the idea that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alone in this world.</p>
<p>And at the same time was the realization</p>
<p>that this beautiful feeling I felt</p>
<p>from the connection to other humans</p>
<p>was this gift that took me away</p>
<p>from this dark realization.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost that love is a kind of escape</p>
<p>from the reality of life, from the muck of life.</p>
<p>And so the journey began in that way,</p>
<p>to think about this world in this way,</p>
<p>both the burden of being alone,</p>
<p>coupled with the frequent escape from that feeling</p>
<p>by being lost in the company of friends, loved ones.</p>
<p>So early on, coupled with this love of the human mind</p>
<p>and curiosity about the human mind</p>
<p>was the love of programming</p>
<p>and actually building little programs</p>
<p>and engineering systems, of course,</p>
<p>building robots in college and so on.</p>
<p>I think the gift of the immigrant experience</p>
<p>of feeling like the outcast</p>
<p>was the love of experiencing</p>
<p>the deep connection with others,</p>
<p>like a deep appreciation of it when it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I guess because it was taken away,</p>
<p>because I was ripped out of it through moving here,</p>
<p>I got to really appreciate it</p>
<p>and start becoming cognizant of it</p>
<p>to where I can start looking for it</p>
<p>and being more grateful when I do have it.</p>
<p>And at the same time, a kind of curiosity</p>
<p>started boiling up of the perspective</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>from that kind of longing for a connection.</p>
<p>So as opposed to looking at robots or AI systems</p>
<p>or even just programs that accomplish a particular task,</p>
<p>can these programs accomplish the same richness of task</p>
<p>and richness of experience</p>
<p>that I came to appreciate as a human being?</p>
<p>So when I talk about kind of love,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s echoes of that in my longing</p>
<p>of the kind of experiences I would like to create</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>that was born out of the immigrant experience,</p>
<p>of the loss of childlike innocence experience,</p>
<p>of all of it combined, of starting to read books</p>
<p>and thinking deeply about this world experience,</p>
<p>all of that coupled in.</p>
<p>I really think sometimes, unfortunately,</p>
<p>the first step of deep gratitude is loss.</p>
<p>So for me, I lost quite a bit during that time</p>
<p>and through that loss, I was able to discover the things</p>
<p>that I truly appreciate about life.</p>
<p>So let me leave it at that.</p>
<p>Question is, if you were able to ask an alien some questions,</p>
<p>what would they be?</p>
<p>This is a really good question</p>
<p>and I find it to be actually a really good thought experiment.</p>
<p>Let me put out some candidate questions out there</p>
<p>and see what sticks.</p>
<p>So first, I&rsquo;ll probably ask for advice</p>
<p>for the human species as a whole, for our civilization,</p>
<p>of what we might do to survive and prosper</p>
<p>for a long time to come,</p>
<p>assuming the alien is from a civilization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s far older than ours or far wiser.</p>
<p>I think there could be some really interesting,</p>
<p>clear statements about the things we&rsquo;re doing here on Earth</p>
<p>that are getting us into trouble from an alien perspective.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the number one thing</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ll bring up along those lines,</p>
<p>bring up questions of great filters.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of your civilization,</p>
<p>when did you almost destroy the entirety of your species?</p>
<p>It would be informative from a historical perspective</p>
<p>to see, for us, it&rsquo;s currently what the nuclear age</p>
<p>and the few moments in the history</p>
<p>that could have resulted in an all-out nuclear war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see</p>
<p>if they mentioned something about AGI,</p>
<p>something about viruses or wars</p>
<p>or just things that we don&rsquo;t even think about.</p>
<p>So I guess question number one</p>
<p>would be some basic life advice,</p>
<p>hoping that this alien is a Naval type character</p>
<p>who can, in a crisp, short way, give some profound advice.</p>
<p>Second, I would probably ask,</p>
<p>now this is a very selfish conversation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just following along the things</p>
<p>on top of my head that follow my curiosity.</p>
<p>I would ask about the difference</p>
<p>between their civilization and ours.</p>
<p>I would ask whether they have some of these things</p>
<p>that make us human, like love.</p>
<p>Like, do you guys have love where you come from?</p>
<p>Do you have death, mortality?</p>
<p>You know, I suspect it&rsquo;s possible to have mortality</p>
<p>not even be a concept that makes any sense</p>
<p>to an alien species.</p>
<p>That, of course, everybody&rsquo;s immortal</p>
<p>and there might be some kind of enforced selection mechanism</p>
<p>like evolution in general.</p>
<p>I would ask about consciousness,</p>
<p>try to tease apart the question of this thing</p>
<p>of subjective experience.</p>
<p>Is this some kind of self-centered,</p>
<p>weird, over-dramatized quirk of evolution that we have</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not actually special at all?</p>
<p>And then we make a kind of big deal about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some kind of useful feature of our brain</p>
<p>to think of ourselves as individuals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to try to tease apart</p>
<p>whether they have consciousness</p>
<p>and what form their intelligence takes</p>
<p>that is distinct from consciousness</p>
<p>in the way that we think of humans</p>
<p>as being conscious entities</p>
<p>that are also able to do intelligent things.</p>
<p>Are those intricately connected?</p>
<p>Are those separate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to sort of tease that apart</p>
<p>of how their alien minds work.</p>
<p>So that includes intelligence, consciousness,</p>
<p>love, and death, all the greatest hits.</p>
<p>Okay, then I would probably go to physics.</p>
<p>Of course, you gotta ask about physics.</p>
<p>I would look into the alien&rsquo;s eyes, if they have eyes,</p>
<p>and try to determine if we can actually even find</p>
<p>the same language of mathematics or physics or sciences.</p>
<p>In general, I would probably ask about the big mysteries</p>
<p>of physics and science of what&rsquo;s outside our universe.</p>
<p>Why is there something rather than nothing?</p>
<p>Why is there stuff?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s outside the stuff we think of as stuff?</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s outside the universe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be hesitant to ask the why questions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try a few out to see maybe there is a good answer</p>
<p>to the why questions of like, why did it start?</p>
<p>Like, why is there something rather than nothing?</p>
<p>Then I would probably ask slightly more detailed</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the universe made of?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s up with this dark matter and dark energy stuff?</p>
<p>Like, what are the basic building blocks of reality?</p>
<p>And what are the laws of physics that govern that reality?</p>
<p>So I would, of course, ask, kind of sneak in there,</p>
<p>just like casually, can you maybe give a few hints</p>
<p>of how to unify?</p>
<p>First of all, are we on the right track</p>
<p>in terms of quantum mechanics and general relativity?</p>
<p>And then how do you unify all the laws of physics?</p>
<p>Maybe sneak in there in a different angle,</p>
<p>trying to ask about the singularity in the black hole,</p>
<p>or maybe what happens at the very beginning of the Big Bang,</p>
<p>like where those laws are all unified.</p>
<p>Maybe try to get a sense of what are the kind of physics</p>
<p>required to fully describe these events.</p>
<p>I think the physics discussion would be a good time</p>
<p>to ask, is there a God?</p>
<p>Maybe not use the G word, but instead say,</p>
<p>is there a kind of a centralized designer</p>
<p>or team of designers that have launched the universe</p>
<p>and are actively managing the universe?</p>
<p>And of course, another version of asking that,</p>
<p>I would probably talk about the simulation</p>
<p>of looking at the universe as we see it,</p>
<p>as a computation, as a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing information processing,</p>
<p>see if that rings a bell to the alien,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a connection to that.</p>
<p>In general, I would ask about what kind of computers</p>
<p>you have and also what kind of computer games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be really useful.</p>
<p>Like, what do you do for fun?</p>
<p>You come here often?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like usual icebreakers.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not mentioning those.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like chatter at the bar.</p>
<p>So I guess outside the big physics questions,</p>
<p>I would ask the more engineering-centric questions.</p>
<p>First, my interest, AI, about superintelligence.</p>
<p>How do we build superintelligent systems,</p>
<p>ones that are far more intelligent than humans?</p>
<p>How do we travel close to the speed of light</p>
<p>or faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>Like, how do the aliens get to where we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re meeting and talking?</p>
<p>Related to that would be a question of energy.</p>
<p>How do we harness the energy of a sun or multiple suns</p>
<p>or all of the suns in our galaxy?</p>
<p>And then also kind of an engineering question.</p>
<p>Can we travel through time?</p>
<p>And if we can, how do we build a time-traveling machine?</p>
<p>And is it a good idea?</p>
<p>I think a lot of these questions will be appended</p>
<p>with a sort of caveat of like,</p>
<p>if you know the answer to this question,</p>
<p>will I be better off if you told me this answer?</p>
<p>Sometimes knowledge is not power.</p>
<p>Sometimes knowledge is a burden</p>
<p>that leads to self-destruction.</p>
<p>So we wanna be careful about that.</p>
<p>Of course, as the alien gets tired of talking to me</p>
<p>at this intergalactic bar,</p>
<p>probably gets up sort of politely, starts walking away,</p>
<p>I would definitely ask some questions</p>
<p>from my own personal knowledge bank.</p>
<p>Is P equals NP?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Theoretical computer science,</p>
<p>one of the big questions all in mathematics.</p>
<p>I just need to know the answer.</p>
<p>Just give me the answer, I&rsquo;ll work from there, okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure out the rest, just the answer.</p>
<p>So yes or no?</p>
<p>Probably won&rsquo;t ask him for investment advice.</p>
<p>Probably thinks that the whole concept of money is silly,</p>
<p>but I might ask about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Good long-term investment or bad?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>The digital currency in general.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ll probably ask,</p>
<p>is Elon Musk one of you guys or a different species?</p>
<p>Do you know which galaxy,</p>
<p>which group of planets he came from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to sort of localize things.</p>
<p>Is there others like it that visit and build companies?</p>
<p>Just get some of the details.</p>
<p>This AMA has suddenly become ridiculous,</p>
<p>but I think this is a really nice thought experiment,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll think about this a little bit more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there is a list of really precise questions</p>
<p>that could most efficiently unlock the mysteries</p>
<p>before the human race</p>
<p>that are both useful for our progress</p>
<p>and useful for our survival.</p>
<p>Question is, what advice would you give</p>
<p>an intermediate life stage 36-year-old</p>
<p>who wants to career pivot from medical technology</p>
<p>and research to computer science?</p>
<p>So first, by computer science,</p>
<p>I think you mean the broad field</p>
<p>that includes software engineering, machine learning,</p>
<p>robotics, just computing in general,</p>
<p>maybe with less emphasis on the mathematical sides</p>
<p>like theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>I think the best advice on this that I could give</p>
<p>is find a simple project to get excited about</p>
<p>and allow yourself to get really excited by it.</p>
<p>Have fun, fall in love with it,</p>
<p>be proud of the thing you create.</p>
<p>And I should say there&rsquo;s a big emphasis on the simple.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go super ambitious.</p>
<p>I believe that most people, if they allow themselves,</p>
<p>can derive a huge amount of joy</p>
<p>for creating some simple little things.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s following a tutorial,</p>
<p>if you just allow yourself to experience</p>
<p>the joy of creation, it&rsquo;s there for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the magical things about computer science</p>
<p>is it allows you to create things</p>
<p>that are almost like entities on their own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what programs are.</p>
<p>So I think a career in computer science</p>
<p>starts first with allowing yourself to be passionate</p>
<p>and getting that, stoking that flame</p>
<p>and allowing it to build.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about any of the practical,</p>
<p>like which job do I get, what thing I work on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really giving yourself over</p>
<p>to the simple passion of creating stuff.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just a quick set of steps</p>
<p>that I think I followed early on</p>
<p>that I would also recommend you</p>
<p>at least consider following is,</p>
<p>first is basic software engineering.</p>
<p>So finding maybe Python or JavaScript,</p>
<p>like super popular, accessible programming language</p>
<p>and build just like a hello world program</p>
<p>or something just a little bit more complicated,</p>
<p>but not much more.</p>
<p>Beyond that is using that newly acquired</p>
<p>set of tools of programming,</p>
<p>build something that automates something you do</p>
<p>on the computer.</p>
<p>Maybe another way to phrase that is just like scripts</p>
<p>that are helping you in your interaction with the computer.</p>
<p>So maybe finding different files in your computer</p>
<p>that you try to look for often</p>
<p>or reorganizing things in an automated way,</p>
<p>like folder structures, or maybe renaming files.</p>
<p>Like I have a script that finds all the files</p>
<p>that have spaces in the file name</p>
<p>and it renames them after confirmation</p>
<p>to underscores, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of little helpful scripts</p>
<p>I have all over the place.</p>
<p>And those are just really joyful</p>
<p>because you get to use them every day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>that made your life a little bit easier.</p>
<p>For me at least, that&rsquo;s a source of joy</p>
<p>that helps feed that like love of programming,</p>
<p>of just being a part of the computing</p>
<p>of the computer science world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been doing that really my whole life.</p>
<p>It started with C and C++,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s a lot of other languages,</p>
<p>primarily Python and yes, JavaScript.</p>
<p>Next is a branching into two separate little worlds</p>
<p>in computer science of algorithms</p>
<p>and then like data science.</p>
<p>I think both are full of beautiful things</p>
<p>to fall in love with.</p>
<p>The thing you can really enjoy with algorithms</p>
<p>is learning how to build more and more</p>
<p>efficient algorithms.</p>
<p>On the data side is learning</p>
<p>how to process different data sets,</p>
<p>how to clean them up,</p>
<p>how to reorganize them</p>
<p>and do different kind of statistics on them,</p>
<p>processing on them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not even talking about machine learning yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being able to visualize those data sets,</p>
<p>all those kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>just working with data.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re starting to talk about a career</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of jobs</p>
<p>that have to do with the use of computing techniques</p>
<p>to process, visualize, interpret, aggregate, analyze data.</p>
<p>So I guess you would call that field data science.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really cool career trajectory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many cool things to get into</p>
<p>with I think a very reasonable small learning curve</p>
<p>that you can really, if you push yourself,</p>
<p>do within weeks, maybe months, not years.</p>
<p>And once you become comfortable with the data science world,</p>
<p>you can start building on top of that quite naturally,</p>
<p>doing some boilerplate machine learning,</p>
<p>supervised learning projects,</p>
<p>and then building out into more specific,</p>
<p>more useful, more novel,</p>
<p>cutting edge applications of machine learning,</p>
<p>reinforcement learning, that whole world.</p>
<p>Maybe even taking that into physical systems</p>
<p>of actually building robots.</p>
<p>And I should backtrack.</p>
<p>It sounds like I&rsquo;m building</p>
<p>towards something super complicated, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>All of these can be really small projects.</p>
<p>Even robotics projects,</p>
<p>you can build a little robot that does some basic tasks,</p>
<p>maybe does some basic computer vision.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a nice way to learn on the robotics side</p>
<p>and better systems programming.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just getting more comfortable with hardware</p>
<p>and seeing if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Or on the data science side,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sticking much more to the software.</p>
<p>Both of those, you now start to figure out</p>
<p>what is the exciting career possibility.</p>
<p>I think two things,</p>
<p>I would even see them as skills that are important here.</p>
<p>Passion and Google.</p>
<p>I see passion as a skill</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s allowing yourself to be excited.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s finding things you could be excited about</p>
<p>and allowing yourself to be excited.</p>
<p>And seeing that as an actually essential part of progress</p>
<p>is allowing yourself to be excited.</p>
<p>And the reason I mentioned Google is because</p>
<p>I find that in a lot of fields,</p>
<p>but especially in computer science,</p>
<p>with software engineering and machine learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many amazing resources out there</p>
<p>that the key skill actually ends up being</p>
<p>is how good are you at discovering the exact page</p>
<p>and resources that is allowing you to take the next step</p>
<p>in your journey of exploration of learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally a skill of</p>
<p>how do I Google the right thing?</p>
<p>What pages do I click on?</p>
<p>And all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think it sounds almost kind of ridiculous</p>
<p>to say that that&rsquo;s a skill,</p>
<p>but that is one of the most essential skills</p>
<p>of the modern day student, lifelong student,</p>
<p>is how to Google.</p>
<p>So yeah, passion and Google.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to fall in love with the project</p>
<p>and keep taking the next step, the next step, the next step</p>
<p>with the help of a good search engine</p>
<p>and a bit of curiosity.</p>
<p>Question is, what form factor of robots</p>
<p>are you most excited about for the future?</p>
<p>Bipeds, quads, arms, humanoids,</p>
<p>maybe something else more obscure.</p>
<p>This is a really tough question</p>
<p>because I really like robots.</p>
<p>I think that love is born in software</p>
<p>and the hardware stuff just makes it a little more fun.</p>
<p>So I think the things I&rsquo;m really excited about,</p>
<p>even in terms of form factors, is in the software.</p>
<p>I think much of the exciting developments in robotics</p>
<p>is actually in simulated worlds currently.</p>
<p>And I think that will be true for quite a while to come.</p>
<p>And so I think in terms of human robot interaction,</p>
<p>the robots that&rsquo;ll be really exciting</p>
<p>are the ones that live in virtual worlds,</p>
<p>like in virtual reality or even just on a screen.</p>
<p>So I think what we would see more and more</p>
<p>is entities, human-like entities,</p>
<p>or entities that allow us to anthropomorphize</p>
<p>a consciousness, a spirit onto them</p>
<p>living in the digital world.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really excited about.</p>
<p>And of course, slowly those entities taking a form</p>
<p>in the physical space in terms of,</p>
<p>I think probably the humanoid form.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though very difficult to engineer</p>
<p>and create a realistic and natural</p>
<p>or fulfilling experience with,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s still probably the most, to me, exciting form.</p>
<p>Although I do really like Boston Dynamic Spot,</p>
<p>the robot dog, from a kind of having a pet perspective</p>
<p>is a really exciting form.</p>
<p>Again, very difficult to do stuff in the physical space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge engineering challenge</p>
<p>that as far as I can tell is several orders of magnitude</p>
<p>more difficult than the same challenge in digital space.</p>
<p>So I just see the digital simulated robotics advancing</p>
<p>much quicker and having a much larger scale impact</p>
<p>on the world, especially if we start seeing</p>
<p>more and more virtual worlds being created.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean virtual reality</p>
<p>or like augmented reality.</p>
<p>It just means ability and mediums within which</p>
<p>you can interact with artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>in the digital space.</p>
<p>And I do see that as a form factor,</p>
<p>which is entities in digital space</p>
<p>having a humanoid or a semi-humanoid form,</p>
<p>something that we can anthropomorphize,</p>
<p>something we can connect with on a human level.</p>
<p>Question is, on the topic of suffering and growth,</p>
<p>is happiness a healthy pursuit?</p>
<p>Or do you agree with Einstein&rsquo;s view on happiness</p>
<p>as the aspiration of a pig?</p>
<p>Okay, let me quickly look up the Einstein quote here</p>
<p>that you referenced about a pig and happiness.</p>
<p>Okay, Einstein writes,</p>
<p>I have never looked upon ease and happiness</p>
<p>as ends in themselves.</p>
<p>This critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty.</p>
<p>The ideals that have lighted my way and time after time</p>
<p>have given me new courage to face life cheerfully</p>
<p>have been kindness, beauty, and truth.</p>
<p>Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind,</p>
<p>without the occupation with the objective world,</p>
<p>the eternally unattainable in the field of art</p>
<p>and scientific endeavors,</p>
<p>life would have seemed empty to me.</p>
<p>The trite objects of human efforts, possessions,</p>
<p>outward success, luxury,</p>
<p>have always seemed to me contemptible.</p>
<p>Okay, where do I start with this?</p>
<p>I think I usually agree with Einstein,</p>
<p>especially when he talks philosophy on most things.</p>
<p>And I do here as well in terms of material possessions</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I think he unfairly attacks the word happiness</p>
<p>and also pigs.</p>
<p>So let me disagree with Einstein</p>
<p>and try to defend the word happiness</p>
<p>and also maybe defend pigs,</p>
<p>if I can somehow figure that out.</p>
<p>So the word happiness,</p>
<p>I think is one of those words</p>
<p>that could mean a lot of things to a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I think in this case,</p>
<p>Einstein is using it as almost,</p>
<p>or the pursuit of happiness</p>
<p>as a kind of synonym for hedonism.</p>
<p>So a kind of very narrow definition of what happiness is.</p>
<p>I think I see happiness as a indicator</p>
<p>that is much bigger than direct pleasures,</p>
<p>but as a word that includes those pleasures,</p>
<p>but also includes more meaningful,</p>
<p>deep fulfillment in life.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d like to reclaim the word happiness</p>
<p>as a good thing,</p>
<p>which is slightly applied in this discussion</p>
<p>that happiness is a kind of distraction</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be thought about.</p>
<p>I do think that happiness is a side effect</p>
<p>of a life well lived, not a goal.</p>
<p>I think the moment it becomes a goal in itself,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy to lose your way.</p>
<p>And perhaps that&rsquo;s what in part Einstein means,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s a really good signal</p>
<p>of progress, happiness.</p>
<p>So in losing yourself in the focus of battle,</p>
<p>of just focusing on excellence and progress</p>
<p>and improving and challenging yourself</p>
<p>and growing all the time,</p>
<p>I think a kind of running average</p>
<p>measure of your happiness,</p>
<p>day-to-day happiness,</p>
<p>so you average that over a period of weeks and months,</p>
<p>is a good measure of how you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think a more actionable process</p>
<p>of collecting that signal</p>
<p>is a process of just gratitude,</p>
<p>of sitting back and thinking how grateful I am,</p>
<p>how grateful you are for how it started</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>for the progress that you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s a good signal,</p>
<p>not momentary happiness,</p>
<p>but over a period of time, several weeks, several months,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not happiness,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably lost your way as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a useful signal,</p>
<p>not a goal in itself, but a useful signal.</p>
<p>And kindness, beauty, and truth,</p>
<p>as Einstein puts it, are good ideals,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a bit ambiguous</p>
<p>in a practical day-to-day sense.</p>
<p>I share them, of course,</p>
<p>but I think practically,</p>
<p>if I were to put it into words,</p>
<p>at least for myself,</p>
<p>struggle is the process</p>
<p>and happiness is the measure.</p>
<p>So day-to-day life actually looks</p>
<p>like a constant struggle to improve yourself.</p>
<p>And then the flip side of that</p>
<p>is the gratitude of how amazing life is,</p>
<p>the progress you&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>but also just the opportunity to struggle.</p>
<p>You have to imagine this if it&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>And ultimately, when I look back at my life,</p>
<p>most days are spent truly happy to be alive.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the pursuit of happiness is a good one.</p>
<p>So not hedonistic in the moment,</p>
<p>local optima of kind of pleasure,</p>
<p>but more like stepping back,</p>
<p>looking at the running average</p>
<p>over the past few weeks and months</p>
<p>and making sure you&rsquo;re at a good level.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a bit of a disagreement with Einstein.</p>
<p>And I also have to say that I think</p>
<p>pigs are one of the most intelligent animals.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still holding out for the possibility</p>
<p>that pigs or maybe dolphins</p>
<p>have life figured out quite a bit better than us humans.</p>
<p>So on those two things,</p>
<p>the pursuit of happiness and on the brilliance of pigs,</p>
<p>me and Einstein part ways for a brief moment.</p>
<p>Question is, hey Lex,</p>
<p>I was curious how you pick people</p>
<p>to come on to the podcast.</p>
<p>I think this process is actually quite difficult</p>
<p>and it evolved over time.</p>
<p>So let me mention a few factors.</p>
<p>I think first and foremost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that a person is really passionate</p>
<p>about what they do.</p>
<p>And that passion can take all kinds of different forms.</p>
<p>I know I sometimes or all the time</p>
<p>completely lack emotion in my face,</p>
<p>but I truly am passionate about the things I do.</p>
<p>And so that passion can express itself in different ways.</p>
<p>And so coupled with that passion,</p>
<p>I look for people who are sort of not only passionate,</p>
<p>but they appreciate, enjoy,</p>
<p>are drawn to the long form conversation format</p>
<p>as a way to express that passion, which is not everybody.</p>
<p>Some people love to express their passion,</p>
<p>their interests, their expertise,</p>
<p>their ideas in written form.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s more kind of edited</p>
<p>over several passes of editing</p>
<p>versus a conversation format,</p>
<p>especially long form conversation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s very little editing.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>I also try to make sure the person</p>
<p>actually wants to come on to this particular podcast.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so many amazing podcasts out there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also just surprising to see</p>
<p>how much better they are than me</p>
<p>at talking and conversations, explaining stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling, it&rsquo;s also inspiring</p>
<p>because it pushes me to kind of improve</p>
<p>seeing what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t actually listen to this particular podcast</p>
<p>or at least have listened a little bit</p>
<p>and are not drawn to the particular flavor of weirdness</p>
<p>that is me, like some kid who wears a suit all the time</p>
<p>and like mumbles, speaks slowly,</p>
<p>asks these weird questions.</p>
<p>I mean, if they&rsquo;re not drawn</p>
<p>to whatever the hell that weird mystery is</p>
<p>of this particular human,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no reason to talk.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re drawn, I think there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>of something magical happening.</p>
<p>Me with my weirdness and them with their weirdness</p>
<p>kind of colliding in interesting ways</p>
<p>that creates something new</p>
<p>that both of us are surprised by.</p>
<p>And on that topic, more and more,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for people that are different than me.</p>
<p>And that means the full spectrum of diversity.</p>
<p>So it could be different backgrounds,</p>
<p>different worldviews, different personalities.</p>
<p>Like you can tell there&rsquo;ll be a clash of flavors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like chocolate and salt,</p>
<p>but it can also turn out to be like a pineapple pizza</p>
<p>that actually some people love, but I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So it could be taking that risk</p>
<p>of embracing that clash in the chemistry</p>
<p>can sometimes result in a pineapple pizza.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a cost to that risk,</p>
<p>but I seek it out more</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s the possibility</p>
<p>of some magical experience of a magical conversation.</p>
<p>And on that topic, I should mention</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of idea of platforming,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to have sort of enough listeners and viewers</p>
<p>that the question of platforming even comes up.</p>
<p>Meaning if you have this kind of guest</p>
<p>with these kind of controversial viewpoints,</p>
<p>why give them a platform</p>
<p>that further spreads their viewpoints?</p>
<p>And I understand, I empathize with this kind of view,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t like it because to me, if I&rsquo;m successful,</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good at this thing,</p>
<p>especially in challenging conversations.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m successful, the tension in worldviews,</p>
<p>the tension in personalities,</p>
<p>the clash will create wisdom.</p>
<p>So I really want to talk to very challenging people.</p>
<p>I want to have really difficult conversations.</p>
<p>And that means talking to people</p>
<p>that are at the outskirts of society.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m thinking about a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to say that I&rsquo;m not afraid of being canceled.</p>
<p>I do think I&rsquo;m afraid,</p>
<p>or perhaps the better word is concerned,</p>
<p>about doing a terrible job</p>
<p>on a important, difficult conversation.</p>
<p>Where as a result of me doing a terrible job,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t add love or knowledge or inspiration to the world,</p>
<p>but fuel further division.</p>
<p>Not because of the guests I have on,</p>
<p>but because of my failure to catalyze</p>
<p>and steer an inspiring conversation.</p>
<p>I see my skill in conversation as not,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how to put it nicely,</p>
<p>but not very good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m striving to improve constantly.</p>
<p>So some of the guest selection has to do</p>
<p>with the difficulty of the conversation</p>
<p>and how prepared I am for that level of difficulty.</p>
<p>I think the way I think about difficult conversations</p>
<p>is some of them might take years to prepare for,</p>
<p>just intellectually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain people and certain spaces of ideas</p>
<p>that takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>You have to remember that I&rsquo;m just an engineer.</p>
<p>I have a set of things that preoccupied my mind for years,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of difficult topics</p>
<p>that I just won&rsquo;t do a good job of.</p>
<p>So part of it is I have to work hard to learn more,</p>
<p>to kind of constantly look outside the Overton window</p>
<p>to try to explore difficult ideas.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>build enough sort of reputation-driven freedom</p>
<p>to take risks and make mistakes,</p>
<p>or try to inspire people in the community</p>
<p>to allow me, to allow each other,</p>
<p>all of us to make mistakes in conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the coupling of extreme, thorough preparation</p>
<p>and allowing yourself to make mistakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like excellence and not giving a damn combined.</p>
<p>But overall, the thing I&rsquo;m concerned about,</p>
<p>and I take back the fear, I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just concerned of doing a bad job of conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not concerned of being canceled or derided</p>
<p>or criticized after having done a reasonably good job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned on myself.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;m canceled or not.</p>
<p>Just when I look in the mirror,</p>
<p>when I look at the results of the conversation</p>
<p>being a failure, something that doesn&rsquo;t add love</p>
<p>to the world, but something that adds derision.</p>
<p>And also, this is the problem with words.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like how I&rsquo;m expressing myself currently.</p>
<p>I really try not to have some kind of agenda</p>
<p>or strategy going into a conversation.</p>
<p>I really wanna be fragile, open-minded,</p>
<p>almost boring and naive, and just giving my trust</p>
<p>to a person, even when I challenge or play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I really want to place trust in the mutual respect</p>
<p>and the love that the other person gives.</p>
<p>And I trust that they won&rsquo;t take advantage of that.</p>
<p>And so some of the guest selection has to do with,</p>
<p>do I have enough trust yet that this person</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t take advantage of my open-mindedness,</p>
<p>of my childlike curiosity, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But all of this is just a giant learning experience.</p>
<p>I do wanna be careful not to let my curiosity run,</p>
<p>what should I say, too far ahead of me,</p>
<p>where my preparation doesn&rsquo;t meet</p>
<p>the level of curiosity I exhibit.</p>
<p>So again, like I said, I&rsquo;m willing and I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to be more and more willing to take risks</p>
<p>and make mistakes in conversations,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also not letting myself off the hook</p>
<p>in terms of the level of preparation I put.</p>
<p>And I really hope that we give each other the freedom</p>
<p>and are patient with each other in nuanced conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what seems to be really missing in public discourse,</p>
<p>is this kind of patience and allowing each other</p>
<p>to make statements that we later change our mind on</p>
<p>and not putting that statement on us</p>
<p>as this kind of scarlet letter</p>
<p>that forever puts us in a bin of red or blue</p>
<p>or some other bin.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to navigate all of this</p>
<p>while still being naive and open-minded as best I can.</p>
<p>Question is, hey Lex, I was wondering how you manage</p>
<p>to remain optimistic in the face of adversity</p>
<p>when you encounter hostile people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t want to even consider</p>
<p>offering constructive criticism</p>
<p>and would rather try to tear you down</p>
<p>and force their ideology.</p>
<p>I find pieces of hope for short periods of time</p>
<p>and then they fade after I see the argument</p>
<p>surrounding whatever brought about hope to begin with.</p>
<p>I guess to put it simply,</p>
<p>how do you hold on to hope and optimism?</p>
<p>Thank you for the question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a lot to be said about this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try to keep it brief and simple.</p>
<p>I try to ignore the noise of the world,</p>
<p>the bickering of the moment.</p>
<p>I find that if you give yourself a chance</p>
<p>to see how amazing people are,</p>
<p>that those people will reveal themselves to be amazing,</p>
<p>that you will see it.</p>
<p>That if you give yourself a chance to see it,</p>
<p>you will see it, I see it.</p>
<p>And I see gratitude for how amazing things are</p>
<p>and optimism for how much even better things could be</p>
<p>as a kind of superpower.</p>
<p>It makes life exciting in a way</p>
<p>that first is just fun to live.</p>
<p>And two, from just a productivity perspective,</p>
<p>as an engineer or anybody who creates anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fuel to create.</p>
<p>I believe that to create new things,</p>
<p>and especially for things that others will say</p>
<p>is not possible to create,</p>
<p>I find that optimism is a necessary precondition</p>
<p>to give you the energy, the fuel, the drive,</p>
<p>the inspiration to go for months, for years,</p>
<p>to carry the fire of belief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where that optimism truly is,</p>
<p>a superpower that enables that kind of perseverance.</p>
<p>So I think the most important thing</p>
<p>is it makes life more exciting and fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good productivity hack, is the second thing.</p>
<p>You also asked how, so I tried to,</p>
<p>my personal life and the influences I take in,</p>
<p>the books I read and the people I talk to,</p>
<p>I try to surround myself with people</p>
<p>that are also full of optimism.</p>
<p>And in general, I&rsquo;m unapologetically a fan</p>
<p>of a lot of people, especially sort of big thinkers,</p>
<p>wild engineers and scientists</p>
<p>and creators of all walks of life.</p>
<p>People that shine in ways that surprise me or excite me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really thousands, to be honest.</p>
<p>Just off the top of my head,</p>
<p>even people I talked to on this podcast,</p>
<p>Chris Lattner always brings a smile to my face,</p>
<p>one of the greatest engineers of the world.</p>
<p>Jim Keller&rsquo;s from that ilk as well,</p>
<p>though slightly different personalities,</p>
<p>but also inspires me, makes me smile,</p>
<p>such a deep and kind and brilliant human being.</p>
<p>Along that line of engineers, Elon Musk, of course,</p>
<p>also the embodiment of optimism about this world</p>
<p>is an inspiration.</p>
<p>And then maybe down the dimension of more wild,</p>
<p>even George Hotz, with a chaotic style of thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different than my own,</p>
<p>but one that I find just inspiring.</p>
<p>Of course, Joe Rogan, for me, has been for many years</p>
<p>a kind of example of somebody</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t take themselves too seriously.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s been for a lot of people.</p>
<p>He has been for me a role model for a successful life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not full of jealousy and kind of derision,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more being supportive of others,</p>
<p>being a fan of others, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, on the darker side, Dan Carlin, of course,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t often think of him as optimistic,</p>
<p>but I truly think he&rsquo;s optimistic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just been so deeply soaking in the muck</p>
<p>of the darkness of human history</p>
<p>that I think sometimes the thing he talks about</p>
<p>come off as deeply cynical</p>
<p>about the future of human civilization,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shining optimism to him.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t, in my conversation with him,</p>
<p>even though his words were saying</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not always optimistic,</p>
<p>I think his heart, his spirit was clearly optimistic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hope for us in him.</p>
<p>And at least to me, that&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>And to me, that hope glows pretty bright</p>
<p>in the stuff that he creates</p>
<p>and the passion that he has for human history.</p>
<p>Of course, the scientist, Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>on the computer science side,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I love cellular automata.</p>
<p>Sean Carroll, the way he loves everything about physics,</p>
<p>this incredible communicator.</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein, the way he loves everything geometrical,</p>
<p>shapes of all things, whether they&rsquo;re mathematical</p>
<p>or whether they&rsquo;re connected to physics,</p>
<p>just his loves for symmetry, asymmetry,</p>
<p>for topology, for the weird curvature of things</p>
<p>in the visible dimensions of space-time</p>
<p>or the invisible ones.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just sticking to people I&rsquo;ve talked to</p>
<p>on this podcast.</p>
<p>Of course, Joshua Bach,</p>
<p>whose flow of consciousness is full of so much brilliance,</p>
<p>it breaks my brain any time I try to process it.</p>
<p>My Commodore 64 brain takes in his Pentium.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the analogy is,</p>
<p>but it always breaks my brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m especially inspired by the creations</p>
<p>of software engineers, for example,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an inherent optimism</p>
<p>to the creative process.</p>
<p>A lot of people in the cryptocurrency space,</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin is a constant inspiration.</p>
<p>It just goes on and on.</p>
<p>And of course, the hundreds,</p>
<p>probably thousands of dead folks,</p>
<p>from Nietzsche to Dostoevsky, Freud, Jung,</p>
<p>Camus, Hasse, Kerouac, everybody.</p>
<p>I mean, I just kind of feel like I exist in this world</p>
<p>of people that are excited about the future</p>
<p>and then, of course, the noise of the world</p>
<p>that is lost in the bickering of the moment can seep in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where a kind of meditation comes in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully ignore it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of running away from the world</p>
<p>in a way that I don&rsquo;t find constructive,</p>
<p>at least at this time in my life.</p>
<p>I just take it in, but I don&rsquo;t let it linger.</p>
<p>If there is any kind of harshness or trolling</p>
<p>or just maybe destructive criticism,</p>
<p>I try to pick from it pieces that I can use to grow,</p>
<p>to inspire me and let the rest go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of muscle you have to build.</p>
<p>And every once in a while, just disconnect from it all</p>
<p>and recharge the mind in a way</p>
<p>from just simple silence of nature.</p>
<p>Question is, what is something you changed your opinion</p>
<p>about in the past few years?</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Love from Brussels.</p>
<p>I love Belgium.</p>
<p>Thank you for that question and the kind words.</p>
<p>I changed my mind on a lot of things</p>
<p>and I change my mind all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a constant flux.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly learning.</p>
<p>I guess my mind is a quantum mechanical system.</p>
<p>But I can mention a few things</p>
<p>that have been stable big shifts</p>
<p>in my thinking at least over the past year or two,</p>
<p>especially related to the podcast.</p>
<p>So on the topic of psychedelics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found those fascinating.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve changed my mind over the past couple years</p>
<p>is a hopeful message.</p>
<p>I think that psychedelics can actually</p>
<p>enter the realm of science</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a bunch of places</p>
<p>that are starting to conduct large scale</p>
<p>research studies on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really exciting to me</p>
<p>because I have a sense that that&rsquo;s just another perspective</p>
<p>into the world of neuroscience</p>
<p>that will help us understand the way the mind works</p>
<p>and potentially how to engineer different aspects</p>
<p>of what makes the human mind so special</p>
<p>in our artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>On the topic of social media,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed my mind over the past two years.</p>
<p>I always felt that it had a bunch of complicated,</p>
<p>bad influences on society,</p>
<p>but they were balanced with a lot of positive effects</p>
<p>that build community, that give people a voice,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>More and more, I&rsquo;m starting to think</p>
<p>that the possible set of destructive trajectories</p>
<p>that social media can take human civilization</p>
<p>is much wider, much more destructive than I accounted for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that I worry about.</p>
<p>In the space of existential risk</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence that people talk about,</p>
<p>I think my mind more and more over the past two years</p>
<p>has been focused on social media</p>
<p>as the greatest threat of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s the greatest set of possibilities.</p>
<p>So what I wanna say is it&rsquo;s the set of trajectories</p>
<p>is wider than I expected.</p>
<p>The set of possible trajectories then society might go</p>
<p>as driven by, managed by, directed by our platforms.</p>
<p>Hence, it&rsquo;s been something that I&rsquo;ve been working on</p>
<p>to see if I can help.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I probably changed my mind on</p>
<p>is that extraterrestrial life, intelligence, consciousness,</p>
<p>is worthy of serious scientific investigation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar how I felt before about consciousness,</p>
<p>human consciousness, is that we lack the tools</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re very early in our ability to explore,</p>
<p>to understand, to engineer consciousness.</p>
<p>And the same with extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>The tools are very crude in terms of the SETI efforts</p>
<p>of trying to communicate with faraway civilizations,</p>
<p>and also the listening.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the detection in faraway exoplanets</p>
<p>and whether they&rsquo;re habitable in life forms</p>
<p>on those planets.</p>
<p>Also the hundreds of thousands of reports of UFO sightings,</p>
<p>actually getting some high-resolution sensory data</p>
<p>around that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the very early days</p>
<p>of any of that kind of understanding.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on,</p>
<p>or rather what I&rsquo;ve come to understand,</p>
<p>is closing my mind, closing the mind of other scientists</p>
<p>to these fields of consciousness and extraterrestrial life</p>
<p>prevents us from actually discovering new things.</p>
<p>Basically what happens when you close your mind</p>
<p>to these fascinating, inspiring, mysterious</p>
<p>spaces of exploration,</p>
<p>you leave the exploration of these topics</p>
<p>to people that are not well-equipped to explore them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just curious minds.</p>
<p>And by the way, those curious minds are magical</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re inspiring and I&rsquo;m one such curious mind.</p>
<p>But the rigors of science, the tools of science,</p>
<p>the funding of science can crack these wide open</p>
<p>and give us better data, better understanding,</p>
<p>inspire totally new ways of thinking</p>
<p>about consciousness, about extraterrestrial life,</p>
<p>have entire paradigm shifts of the way we approach</p>
<p>our understanding of intelligence,</p>
<p>of life forms in general.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things that kind of open my eyes</p>
<p>to this fascinating world.</p>
<p>The David Fravor conversation of the pilot</p>
<p>that saw the Tic-Tac UFO was just recent,</p>
<p>a more and more conversation, but that was in 2017.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Avi Loeb&rsquo;s thoughts</p>
<p>about a more and more when it first came out.</p>
<p>And even just thinking about the Drake equation</p>
<p>more seriously and thinking about</p>
<p>the different possibilities built</p>
<p>into the uncertainty of the parameters,</p>
<p>just opened my eyes to the mystery and the wonder</p>
<p>of the amazing universe we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and how little we know about it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve definitely kind of become</p>
<p>much more intellectually open to the exploration</p>
<p>of what extraterrestrial life might look like,</p>
<p>what are the ways we might be able to communicate with it,</p>
<p>how we might be able to understand it,</p>
<p>what does it teach us about ourselves?</p>
<p>And also, importantly, this very fascinating</p>
<p>psychological effect of being open to these mysteries</p>
<p>that we know very little about,</p>
<p>what does that do to the actual productivity,</p>
<p>the creative output of an engineering mind,</p>
<p>that opening your mind in this way,</p>
<p>to think outside of the little box</p>
<p>of things we understand well,</p>
<p>what does that do in terms of the things</p>
<p>you might be able to build,</p>
<p>the ideas that might visit you</p>
<p>and result in you being able to build something totally new?</p>
<p>I think all of that changed my mind about aliens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been having conversations</p>
<p>about extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, of course, very careful walking down this line</p>
<p>because I am first and foremost a scientist and engineer</p>
<p>and I wanna stay in that world,</p>
<p>but I really do want to cultivate an open mind</p>
<p>and a childlike curiosity.</p>
<p>And I generally hope to see that in other scientists as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what science is all about.</p>
<p>I think incremental progress is essential for science,</p>
<p>but it has to be coupled to that childlike wonder</p>
<p>about the world and an open-minded, out-of-the-box,</p>
<p>thinking that results in major paradigm shift</p>
<p>that throw all those silly citations out the window</p>
<p>and build totally new sciences, totally new approaches</p>
<p>that make everything we did in the decades past meaningless</p>
<p>or actually counterproductive.</p>
<p>So they have to be coupled together.</p>
<p>Incremental progress and first principles,</p>
<p>deep thinking that results in paradigm shifts.</p>
<p>Question is, what was your decision behind going</p>
<p>on the keto diet, mainly meat-based,</p>
<p>and how has it helped you?</p>
<p>So the decision, or rather process,</p>
<p>of discovering the diets that work for me</p>
<p>has to do with the fact that I wrestled</p>
<p>in combat sports my whole life.</p>
<p>That has weight classes, so you&rsquo;re constantly figuring out</p>
<p>how to perform optimally physically and mentally</p>
<p>while going to school and so on, while also cutting weight.</p>
<p>So grounded in that, I&rsquo;ve developed a fascination</p>
<p>with different diets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought about diet</p>
<p>as a prescriptive thing for others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself</p>
<p>as a kind of a nutritional scientist</p>
<p>running a study of N of one.</p>
<p>So just studying myself and not trying</p>
<p>to extrapolate to others, just understanding</p>
<p>what makes me happy, what makes me perform the best,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where that journey took.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything.</p>
<p>I think about 15 or more years ago,</p>
<p>I discovered the power of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or fasting in general, and I can talk about that forever.</p>
<p>I used to do a lot of weight lifting,</p>
<p>sort of power lifting, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And in the world of men&rsquo;s health,</p>
<p>or rather men&rsquo;s muscle and fitness, kind of,</p>
<p>where you eat six, seven times a day,</p>
<p>small meals, chicken and broccoli, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>in that kind of world, to realize that you can eat</p>
<p>once a day and still train two, three times that day</p>
<p>and actually have more energy, more focus,</p>
<p>and perform better than you ever have was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>So I think fasting was the biggest paradigm shift for me</p>
<p>because it made me realize that I really need</p>
<p>to study myself better, try new things all the time</p>
<p>to allow myself the opportunity to discover</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s totally transformative on my life,</p>
<p>makes my life easier, makes my body, my mind work better,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I discovered intermittent fasting and fasting in general</p>
<p>from the ultra-endurance athlete&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where also I came across the ideas</p>
<p>of fat-adapted athlete, which is this kind of idea</p>
<p>that you can use fat as an energy source,</p>
<p>and then quickly discover that there is diets</p>
<p>similar to like a keto diet that are extremely low-carb</p>
<p>that could allow you to perform well physically</p>
<p>and mentally, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think it all sounded a little bit crazy to me.</p>
<p>I grew up thinking low-fat is good, high-fat is bad.</p>
<p>So it was always weird to eat something with fat in it</p>
<p>and for it not to be like a cheat meal or something,</p>
<p>but to be something that&rsquo;s part of the diet.</p>
<p>So it was strange, but once I gave it a chance</p>
<p>and did it properly with all the electrolytes</p>
<p>and water and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>you can look it up.</p>
<p>When you do it properly, it just felt great,</p>
<p>and there was just a huge number of benefits</p>
<p>I felt immediately, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it ever since.</p>
<p>So let me maybe quickly comment on some pros and cons</p>
<p>of the keto diet.</p>
<p>And again, this is all personal experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to extrapolate this to others,</p>
<p>but I do encourage people to try, to explore,</p>
<p>to be their own scientists of their own body.</p>
<p>So for me, pros is the physical energy.</p>
<p>First of all, the energy levels are more stable,</p>
<p>but also I just feel more energized for exercise.</p>
<p>This is both for explosive movements, heavy lifts,</p>
<p>or jiu-jitsu, grappling, judo, wrestling,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>and also for prolonged endurance exercise.</p>
<p>I find both a really benefit for me.</p>
<p>I think for explosive exercise,</p>
<p>the biggest benefit for me is the mental focus,</p>
<p>at least the way I approach the grappling sports,</p>
<p>but even lifting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly very important how my body feels,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also important that the mind</p>
<p>is really focused on the technique.</p>
<p>And I find that the biggest benefit of keto</p>
<p>combined with fasting is that my mind can achieve</p>
<p>a greater level of stable, prolonged focus,</p>
<p>which is useful for exercise, funny enough for me.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s really useful for work,</p>
<p>for deep work sessions, for thinking deeply</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of times,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s programming, whether that&rsquo;s writing,</p>
<p>or whether that&rsquo;s sitting behind a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and designing new systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both the energy of mental focus</p>
<p>and the kind of clarity, I don&rsquo;t know how else to put it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a cleanness to the focus</p>
<p>that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>Also, when you acclimate to it,</p>
<p>I find that the sort of number of hours in the day</p>
<p>that I have a positive mood is just larger.</p>
<p>I can be cranky sometimes,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m sleep deprived</p>
<p>or especially when stuff is just not working.</p>
<p>So there will always be parts of the day when I&rsquo;m cranky,</p>
<p>but it just feels, I haven&rsquo;t quantified it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure sort of anecdotally speaking</p>
<p>that the number of hours I feel just good</p>
<p>about the day is just grateful to be alive</p>
<p>is higher with keto.</p>
<p>Other benefits are better sleep.</p>
<p>I fall asleep easier.</p>
<p>That might have to do with just the lower volume of food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I enjoy naps and sleep better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just in general small aches and pains</p>
<p>from joints when you&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>all that kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Seems to be less on keto.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just my own personal experience.</p>
<p>Also, when you&rsquo;re doing fasting and keto,</p>
<p>because of the stable energy,</p>
<p>you find that you can actually skip meals quite easily.</p>
<p>And so that gives you a nice gateway into fasting</p>
<p>for longer periods of times if you like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of benefits to fasting</p>
<p>that I could talk about, but that&rsquo;s for another time.</p>
<p>But in general, it gives you this freedom to live life,</p>
<p>to enjoy life, and not be so obsessed about food.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the biggest liberating thing about keto</p>
<p>is that if you do the keto diet well,</p>
<p>that food ceases to be a kind of habitual obsession</p>
<p>that drives the progress of the day.</p>
<p>More of the day is spent kind of lost in the passions</p>
<p>and the things you love doing.</p>
<p>I just found that when I was doing</p>
<p>the kind of many meals a day,</p>
<p>I would find myself thinking about food a lot.</p>
<p>It drove the structure of the day.</p>
<p>It influenced a lot of the things I would talk about</p>
<p>and think about.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really think of it that way until it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And you notice with keto and fasting</p>
<p>that you can spend really long hours of the day</p>
<p>just doing some cool stuff that you love</p>
<p>and food doesn&rsquo;t come into play</p>
<p>in your mind and your actual activity.</p>
<p>My personal cons of the keto diet is</p>
<p>I enjoy eating higher volume.</p>
<p>It gives you a feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>And I think with the keto diet</p>
<p>is a lower volume of food in general.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still full in terms of your body</p>
<p>not saying you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not a feeling of real fullness.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s also a benefit because you just feel better,</p>
<p>you feel lighter, less bloated, and so on.</p>
<p>I find this is actually changing a lot,</p>
<p>but keto used to be a little bit less socially friendly.</p>
<p>Most of the fun foods, foods you associate</p>
<p>with kind of just like going crazy at parties</p>
<p>or restaurants and so on, have a ton of carbs.</p>
<p>And so in social settings,</p>
<p>it often feel like you&rsquo;re being restrictive</p>
<p>and not partaking in the fun if you&rsquo;re doing a keto diet.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s changing a lot.</p>
<p>People are becoming much more accepting of it.</p>
<p>For example, at McDonald&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you can order just the beef patties for $1.50</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t look at you weird,</p>
<p>at least in my experience,</p>
<p>if you just get the burger without a bun.</p>
<p>Another con is keto and carnivore just doesn&rsquo;t sound healthy</p>
<p>so I usually try not to talk about it too much</p>
<p>because it just makes me feel really good,</p>
<p>my mind focused, my body performs well.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if I want to sort of prescribe it to others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely something I recommend you try,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t feel like conclusively saying</p>
<p>this diet is great for everybody, I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t know enough to be able to say that</p>
<p>and also it just doesn&rsquo;t sound right to say that.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;ve loved meat my whole life,</p>
<p>I feel the best when I eat a lot of meat.</p>
<p>I do think about the ethical side of veganism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m reading about now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking a lot about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ongoing journey, perhaps I&rsquo;ll have more to say,</p>
<p>more of my mind to be changed in the future, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>But for now, for many years now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the keto diet,</p>
<p>a mix of keto and carnivore diets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>What was the darkest time in your life</p>
<p>and what did your road to recovery look like?</p>
<p>In general, I love life, so it&rsquo;s difficult for me</p>
<p>to talk about these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But let me briefly say that I think the darkest times</p>
<p>have been when I&rsquo;ve put my faith in people,</p>
<p>when I opened my heart to them</p>
<p>and they turned out not to be</p>
<p>the best versions of themselves</p>
<p>or maybe the kind of amazing people that I&rsquo;d hope,</p>
<p>I thought they might be.</p>
<p>So my heart has been broken in small ways in my life,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure it has been for many people.</p>
<p>But the fire of hope still burns bright,</p>
<p>perhaps even brighter.</p>
<p>You mentioned road to recovery.</p>
<p>I think with the people I mentioned,</p>
<p>I focus on the positive moments, and there always are,</p>
<p>and just have gratitude for those</p>
<p>and just don&rsquo;t linger on the negative.</p>
<p>I just remember the good times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I recover, that&rsquo;s how I keep my optimism,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I keep my heart open</p>
<p>for future amazing people to take the risk.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure my heart will be broken again,</p>
<p>perhaps many times in the future.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s always worth the risk.</p>
<p>I like the, I wrote this down, the Marcus Aurelius quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Love the people with whom fate brings you together</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;and do so with all of your heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all we can do.</p>
<p>I hope some of these answers</p>
<p>were at least somewhat interesting or useful.</p>
<p>If so, I&rsquo;ll try to do it again in the future.</p>
<p>It is currently 4, oh, it&rsquo;s 421.</p>
<p>When I started saying that sentence, it was 420 a.m.</p>
<p>A good time to end as any, perhaps the best.</p>
<p>Good night, I love you all.</p>
