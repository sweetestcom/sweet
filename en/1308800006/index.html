    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>On October 25th, 1984, all the way out in Amarillo, Texas,</p>
<p>a 29-year-old man named Ricky Mock went into a convenience store</p>
<p>and held the cashiers and guests at gunpoint, demanding money.</p>
<p>When he got what he was looking for, he took off,</p>
<p>only to be pulled over a few hours later</p>
<p>by an Amarillo officer who noticed his Indiana plates.</p>
<p>Ricky assumed that they knew it was him who robbed the place,</p>
<p>so as soon as he stopped his car,</p>
<p>he hopped out and pointed his pistol at the patrol car,</p>
<p>prompting the officer to fatally shoot him.</p>
<p>Police searched his car and found not only the stolen money</p>
<p>from the convenience store holdup,</p>
<p>but tons of other stolen cash and other stolen stuff</p>
<p>from way out in Indiana.</p>
<p>So word quickly made its way from Texas to Indiana,</p>
<p>where Ricky was wanted for other armed robberies.</p>
<p>State police were sent to search his apartment in Logansport, Indiana,</p>
<p>for anything else that didn&rsquo;t belong to him.</p>
<p>And they did find some items from local burglaries,</p>
<p>but what else they found was shocking.</p>
<p>There was some bloody clothes and a newspaper clipping</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with any robbery</p>
<p>that they were investigating.</p>
<p>The clipping had to do with a murder.</p>
<p>They quickly figured out who was the lead detective on that case,</p>
<p>Sergeant Dave Yokelet.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading his report of that call.</p>
<p>He informed me of an individual who had been shot and killed</p>
<p>by police in Amarillo, Texas the day prior,</p>
<p>which would be the 25th of October, 1984.</p>
<p>He advised this individual was Ricky Mock.</p>
<p>Police were searching an apartment in Logansport, Indiana,</p>
<p>where this individual is from,</p>
<p>and had located a newspaper clipping</p>
<p>in regards to the homicide investigation</p>
<p>and also some clothes that had what appeared to be blood on them.</p>
<p>This is Episode 5.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Gunned Down.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dave Yokelet drove the 35 or so miles</p>
<p>from his house in Marshall County to Logansport, Indiana,</p>
<p>and he met ISP detectives at Ricky Mock&rsquo;s apartment on Helm Street.</p>
<p>They showed him a pair of brown shoes and white towels</p>
<p>that looked to have blood spots on them.</p>
<p>There was also a pair of pants in the apartment</p>
<p>with some stains that were similar,</p>
<p>but police couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were blood or not.</p>
<p>Even more suspicious, police found some plastic</p>
<p>Playtex dishwashing gloves</p>
<p>that also looked to have blood stains on them.</p>
<p>The newspaper clipping that police found in Ricky&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>was cut out from the Logansport newspaper</p>
<p>and was dated August 23rd.</p>
<p>It was an article that described a man</p>
<p>that was fleeing from police</p>
<p>who matched the suspect description from the Hulse homicide.</p>
<p>Now, prior to this, Ricky Mock was not a name</p>
<p>that had come up before in the Hulse investigation.</p>
<p>And sure, he was kind of known locally around town,</p>
<p>but not for anything even close to what happened to Darlene.</p>
<p>But blood on clothes?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that from a robbery.</p>
<p>And having that clipping,</p>
<p>it screamed that there was a connection to be found.</p>
<p>All of the bloody items were sent off to the state crime lab</p>
<p>to see if they could tie Darlene&rsquo;s death to Ricky.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sergeant Yokelet worked to find out</p>
<p>more about who Ricky Mock was.</p>
<p>When he checked out his criminal history,</p>
<p>it seemed to be mostly robberies and burglaries</p>
<p>all around northern Indiana.</p>
<p>This guy seemed to be financially motivated</p>
<p>and mostly pulled off quick cash grabs.</p>
<p>There was nothing in any of the reports</p>
<p>about him hurting anyone in the process.</p>
<p>Now, physically, Ricky fit the description.</p>
<p>Blonde, skinny, clean-shaven.</p>
<p>So Sergeant Yokelet got Ricky&rsquo;s most recent mugshot</p>
<p>and went straight back to the Hulse family</p>
<p>to see if Marie and Melissa recognized him.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Again, that wasn&rsquo;t enough for the police</p>
<p>to completely discount Ricky as a suspect,</p>
<p>so they kept investigating him</p>
<p>to see if they could place him in Argus on August 17th.</p>
<p>In doing so, they did find out</p>
<p>that some of his social circles overlap with Danny Bender&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which was interesting from an investigative standpoint,</p>
<p>but also not that surprising because Argus is so small.</p>
<p>The police went and interviewed a lot of those people.</p>
<p>But when they were talking to them,</p>
<p>as far as whether or not Ricky was capable of murder,</p>
<p>the vote was split.</p>
<p>Some said, oh, yeah, definitely,</p>
<p>if he had the right motivation,</p>
<p>and others said, no way.</p>
<p>Robbery is as far as he would go.</p>
<p>According to his apartment landline calls,</p>
<p>there was a phone call placed</p>
<p>from his apartment in Logansport</p>
<p>on August 17th at 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>which had to have been a rollercoaster of emotions</p>
<p>that happened in, like, a split second for investigators</p>
<p>because this is amazing.</p>
<p>Yes, he was in Indiana the day that Darlene was murdered,</p>
<p>but, oh, shit, there is no way he could have done it.</p>
<p>The timeline didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Darlene was abducted in Argus around 9.30,</p>
<p>which means that he would have had to kill her,</p>
<p>taken her body to a different location,</p>
<p>and then been back to his apartment in Logansport</p>
<p>40 minutes away,</p>
<p>making a casual phone call by 10 a.m.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t working with the timeline as they knew it.</p>
<p>But investigators knew if they were off</p>
<p>on the timing of Darlene&rsquo;s murder by even 15 minutes,</p>
<p>it would have been possible,</p>
<p>although still a big stretch.</p>
<p>And just in case you&rsquo;re wondering,</p>
<p>police did track down the person that Ricky called that morning</p>
<p>just to verify that it had been him</p>
<p>on the phone from his apartment.</p>
<p>And they said, yeah, it was him,</p>
<p>and it was a totally normal, everyday phone call,</p>
<p>nothing damning about it.</p>
<p>They also tracked down a woman</p>
<p>whose name was on a pill bottle in Ricky&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>Now, police at first had assumed that these were stolen meds,</p>
<p>but the woman said that she had been sort of dating Ricky,</p>
<p>and in fact, she had dropped off the pills at his apartment</p>
<p>on the afternoon of the 17th,</p>
<p>and she said that Ricky was there at home</p>
<p>just kind of lounging around.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like he really even left</p>
<p>after making this phone call.</p>
<p>Police were feeling pretty on the fence about Ricky,</p>
<p>at least that is until the crime lab results came back.</p>
<p>The ISP testing confirmed that it was in fact blood</p>
<p>on Ricky&rsquo;s stuff,</p>
<p>and that blood appeared to be consistent</p>
<p>with Darlene&rsquo;s blood type.</p>
<p>Now, blood testing,</p>
<p>especially at the state levels back then,</p>
<p>was super generic.</p>
<p>It basically could just tell you type O or type A, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they knew that if they were going to nail this guy,</p>
<p>especially with a tight timeline that they would be working with,</p>
<p>they would need something definitive.</p>
<p>So they asked the FBI to perform their own tests</p>
<p>since they had more advanced equipment.</p>
<p>They analyzed the same samples,</p>
<p>and their findings were that it was definitely</p>
<p>not Darlene&rsquo;s blood on Ricky&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>Just to be extra sure he wasn&rsquo;t connected to the crime scene,</p>
<p>police also arranged to get one of Ricky&rsquo;s hairs</p>
<p>sent to Indiana from Texas</p>
<p>and had it tested against a few of the hairs</p>
<p>found at Darlene&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>the ones on her body and on baby Kristen&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>And it turns out that none of those hairs matched Ricky&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Actually, all but one of the hairs turned out to be Darlene&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So the blood and the hairs weren&rsquo;t a match.</p>
<p>But the list of crimes that Ricky had been accused of was long.</p>
<p>After the robbery in Texas,</p>
<p>Amarillo police sent notices to police departments</p>
<p>about Ricky&rsquo;s death,</p>
<p>and they got like a dozen calls back from officers</p>
<p>saying that he was wanted for crimes in their areas,</p>
<p>mostly armed robberies throughout the Midwest.</p>
<p>Just to be extra thorough,</p>
<p>police continued doing interviews regarding Ricky.</p>
<p>They talked to this guy named Joe Krip,</p>
<p>who was apparently Ricky&rsquo;s like BFF.</p>
<p>With Ricky dead,</p>
<p>police figured Joe was the next best person to talk to</p>
<p>because the two were super tight.</p>
<p>Joe said that his buddy Ricky, RIP,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t have abducted or killed anyone back in August</p>
<p>because he had actually wrecked his motorcycle in July</p>
<p>and was barely able to walk for like months after that.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t think Ricky would have been able to struggle with anyone</p>
<p>or move a body in the condition that he was in.</p>
<p>Joe also laughed off the fact</p>
<p>that Ricky had cut out that newspaper clipping</p>
<p>about a fugitive police were looking for</p>
<p>because the fugitive was Ricky.</p>
<p>Ricky thought it was hilarious that he&rsquo;d been fleeing from police</p>
<p>and actually got away with it by hiding in a cornfield.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because he had anything to do with Darlene&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The next question police asked Joe</p>
<p>was if Ricky had any access to green cars,</p>
<p>and in fact, he did.</p>
<p>Joe said that Ricky had bought a four-door early 70s green Maverick</p>
<p>off a girl they knew.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t remember when Ricky drove the car, though,</p>
<p>so police followed up with that girl that he mentioned</p>
<p>and she said that Ricky had borrowed the green car back in September</p>
<p>and then bought it off her in early October before going to Texas.</p>
<p>She said that she couldn&rsquo;t remember Ricky using the car before September.</p>
<p>But then police got a call from a guy named Mike Murphy</p>
<p>who said that Ricky had bought a green car off him over the summer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reenactment of Sergeant Yokelet&rsquo;s interview with Mike.</p>
<p>The way we understand it, he bought a car from you.</p>
<p>Yeah, a 1974 two-door Ford Brougham, green.</p>
<p>That was a green one?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Is that supposed to be the same one that he wrecked later on</p>
<p>or a girl had wrecked?</p>
<p>A girl had wrecked it as far as I know.</p>
<p>There were other times that Ricky came to your house?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Kind of just basically tell me,</p>
<p>what would take place when he was over here</p>
<p>or what pretext he would come over on?</p>
<p>He would just come over to visit kids around,</p>
<p>just shoot the breeze, put it that way.</p>
<p>In talking with other people and in talking with you,</p>
<p>he was the type of individual that bragged a lot?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did he ever brag to you or show off to you</p>
<p>as far as telling you that he was involved in any other crimes,</p>
<p>doing any crime?</p>
<p>No, not until after, you know.</p>
<p>Sam or Joe or one of them told me that he had been in Medaryville</p>
<p>or something in Medaryville when he was younger.</p>
<p>And then he told me what had been his priors,</p>
<p>but he told me that he had gone on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>After that, the questioning switched to something about a gun</p>
<p>that Mike said Ricky stole from him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bit of a reach,</p>
<p>but you can tell Sergeant Yokelet has his reasoning for asking.</p>
<p>Basically, one of the guns that Ricky had in his car</p>
<p>when he died in Texas</p>
<p>was the one that Mike used to keep under his mattress.</p>
<p>That gun used to belong to Mike&rsquo;s brother,</p>
<p>who was also murdered in Argus like 10 years prior,</p>
<p>but not far from the Hulse home.</p>
<p>In Sergeant Yokelet&rsquo;s report of his interview with Mike,</p>
<p>he wrote, quote,</p>
<p>It is not known for certain if there&rsquo;s any connection at this time</p>
<p>between the homicide of Darlene Hulse</p>
<p>to any of the other homicides that have taken place several years ago.</p>
<p>However, it appears to this officer to be very coincidental</p>
<p>that the weapon that was in the possession of a suspect</p>
<p>in the Darlene Hulse investigation</p>
<p>originally belonged to an individual that was killed on State Road 110,</p>
<p>that it was believed his death was also possibly a homicide.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the case in Argus where the woman got killed.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can explain to me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve heard from other people around or Ricky?</p>
<p>Well, to tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t think he did it.</p>
<p>And, you know, and then Bob come up one night and talked to me.</p>
<p>Bob?</p>
<p>Engel.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I just asked him, I said,</p>
<p>do you think that he could have did it?</p>
<p>And Bob looked at me and says,</p>
<p>if the girl approached him, you know,</p>
<p>and spooked him and caught him off guard, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, he might have did it out of pure fright</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t know what the heck to do with her.</p>
<p>When he was around here, the wife said he acted strange.</p>
<p>But, you know, anybody who walks into the house to her is going to act strange.</p>
<p>He was a very intelligent man, you know.</p>
<p>He just pulled stupid bullshit.</p>
<p>Finally, police interviewed Ricky&rsquo;s wife, Christine.</p>
<p>The two had separated in early 1984,</p>
<p>but they had a two-year-old kid together.</p>
<p>Christine told police that for the first two weeks of August,</p>
<p>Ricky had their son with him in Logansport.</p>
<p>She said that on August 13th, he had returned him to her house,</p>
<p>and at that time, Ricky was still suffering from his injuries</p>
<p>that he had gotten in the motorcycle accident.</p>
<p>Christine said that Ricky could walk,</p>
<p>that it was really difficult for him.</p>
<p>She also said that Ricky had a bad temper,</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t come right out and say</p>
<p>that she thought he was capable of murdering someone.</p>
<p>After all their interviews, investigators had a few key takeaways.</p>
<p>They basically knew Ricky was a full-time robber,</p>
<p>and he liked to brag about his crimes.</p>
<p>He had bragged about being wanted by the Merrillville, Indiana, PD</p>
<p>to his wife and Joe before going to Texas.</p>
<p>So, if he had been wanted for murder,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t he have at least told Joe?</p>
<p>Or mentioned that he&rsquo;d gone too far and had to skip town?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re making your living stealing cash from people,</p>
<p>being wanted for murder might lend some street cred to your reputation.</p>
<p>In November 1984, the Plymouth Bureau of the South Bend Tribune</p>
<p>published an article with the headline,</p>
<p>Not Likely, Dead Man Is Killer.</p>
<p>Sergeant Yochelet was quoted in that story basically saying</p>
<p>things weren&rsquo;t adding up for Ricky Mock like they had hoped.</p>
<p>Most of it came back to that 10 a.m. phone call</p>
<p>that he had made from his apartment on August 17th.</p>
<p>But Ron Hulse, probably to try and comfort his daughters,</p>
<p>decided to cling to the Ricky Mock theory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Kristen and Marie.</p>
<p>And Dad had always told us growing up that it was&hellip;</p>
<p>They had caught the guy, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Because we were scared.</p>
<p>That he was shot and killed in Texas robbing a bank.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s just so far-fetched.</p>
<p>When he talked to me about it, it was always just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re safe, you&rsquo;re okay, they&rsquo;ve caught him.</p>
<p>Because when I was little, I was scared.</p>
<p>I was scared he was going to come back.</p>
<p>And I would have nightmares.</p>
<p>I imagine Ron was doing everything he could to try and comfort the girls.</p>
<p>And maybe at that time it was easier to believe that Ricky did it</p>
<p>because he was dead.</p>
<p>Maybe it comforted him in a way too.</p>
<p>But in fall 1984, if there had ever been any case to make</p>
<p>against Ricky Mock, it fizzled out faster than it came together.</p>
<p>Just as it had for Robert Zebrowski and Danny Bender.</p>
<p>For a moment, police considered pivoting</p>
<p>and going back to interrogating Danny even harder.</p>
<p>But a few days after his dear Thelma letter from jail,</p>
<p>police got a call from the Illinois State Police.</p>
<p>One of their troopers recalled stopping two hitchhikers on August 15th</p>
<p>just across the Illinois state line from Indiana.</p>
<p>It was Danny Bender and his friend Tim.</p>
<p>They were headed out west just like they told detectives here</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have any active warrants.</p>
<p>Danny had even gotten permission from his parole officer to leave the state</p>
<p>so the Illinois State Trooper let them go.</p>
<p>Police knew that it would have been nearly impossible</p>
<p>for Danny to have found his way back to Arcus by the morning of the 17th.</p>
<p>So they knew they had to move on.</p>
<p>If you look at old news coverage in the weeks after Darlene&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>it is all about Danny, Robert and Ricky.</p>
<p>You can sense how desperate police were to find the monster</p>
<p>who viciously took Darlene away from her family.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to see why police zeroed in on them.</p>
<p>They were all hard partying guys who were caught up</p>
<p>in various shady activities in and around Arcus.</p>
<p>People who had dealings with those men heard about something bad</p>
<p>that had happened and they were like, well it must have been one of them.</p>
<p>And it seemed as if police wanted it to be one of them.</p>
<p>They were drifters.</p>
<p>Anywhere they went, trouble followed.</p>
<p>That kind of random tragedy seems easier for the community to handle</p>
<p>because the subtle message is it&rsquo;s not one of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone from the outside.</p>
<p>Someone who was always bad.</p>
<p>Someone who you could spot a mile away.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t so simple.</p>
<p>None of the men connected directly.</p>
<p>Only indirectly and through lots of other petty criminals.</p>
<p>And the circumstantial evidence that could have possibly tied</p>
<p>any of them to Darlene was shaky at best.</p>
<p>Two months into a murder investigation, in a small town,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the type of information detectives want to have to admit</p>
<p>when reporters call or when members of the community</p>
<p>stop them at the grocery store or the cafe to ask for updates</p>
<p>in finding the despicable man who killed the sweet stay-at-home mom.</p>
<p>So as investigators prepared to hit the reset button on their investigation,</p>
<p>they had to finally grapple with their worst fear.</p>
<p>That whoever killed Darlene was living among them.</p>
<p>And as police were coming to terms with that,</p>
<p>the Argus community was living in fear.</p>
<p>Something so horrible could happen to sweet, straight-laced Darlene Hulse.</p>
<p>Were any of them safe?</p>
<p>Especially in their homes.</p>
<p>As far as bad habits, the only one I ever got her on was the fact that</p>
<p>at night she never pulled the drapes or pulled the shade down.</p>
<p>She just thought that we lived out in a remote area.</p>
<p>Anybody that&rsquo;s out there is going to be sick anyway.</p>
<p>And if I went into the bedroom first, was going to shower or something,</p>
<p>then I always pulled them down.</p>
<p>But she never did.</p>
<p>She never did.</p>
<p>And I just wonder now if there&rsquo;s been someone looking all along or what.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming up in Episode 6,</p>
<p>Evil All Around.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
