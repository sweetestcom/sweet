    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attentum.</p>
<p>I keep reading in all of the entertainment stories how desperate the entertainment industry</p>
<p>is for new ideas and new concepts and subject matter and all this stuff and I read one the</p>
<p>other day that says this is the reason why you keep seeing like Teenage Mutant Ninja</p>
<p>Turtles 47 and every cartoon you grew up with as a kid made into a live action movie.</p>
<p>I mean they&rsquo;re just desperate for you know they need ideas.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe that I refuse to believe it because the ideas are hiding in plain sight</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t get it I don&rsquo;t get why the stories that are right there aren&rsquo;t just snapped up</p>
<p>and used I mean they&rsquo;re sitting there like diamonds on the beach.</p>
<p>And because human history is so vast right not just in terms of geography but also you</p>
<p>know eras that there are so many stories that whatever you&rsquo;re particularly trying</p>
<p>to well let&rsquo;s just take a movie for example but it could be anything whatever you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to make a movie out of I mean there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the right diamond on the beach for</p>
<p>you and maybe multiples.</p>
<p>I was thinking the other day everybody wants to make you know a strong female you know</p>
<p>protagonist sort of film right now from a female I mean it&rsquo;s it would be the perfect</p>
<p>idea right the perfect time period right now to do the definitive movie how about the only</p>
<p>movie on what I think and remember my knowledge is the opposite of vast and deep but but from</p>
<p>my limited perspective this is the most interesting I don&rsquo;t even know that the adjectives elude</p>
<p>me woman in the entire ancient period of you know Greek Mediterranean West Asian history</p>
<p>you know that world it&rsquo;s Alexander the Great&rsquo;s mother how the hell has that movie not been</p>
<p>made and let me stop and point out that Alexander the Great story may be the you know when people</p>
<p>say to me because I said once that history has ruined me for fiction and people will</p>
<p>come up to me sometimes and want an example you know give me an example from history and</p>
<p>I always use the same one because it&rsquo;s right on the tip of my tongue and it&rsquo;s also the</p>
<p>best example I can think of I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s you know arguable I always say the Alexander</p>
<p>the Great story now obviously it doesn&rsquo;t have dragons and stuff and you can get that</p>
<p>in fiction but to balance that out the story is basically true and that&rsquo;ll compensate you</p>
<p>in my book anyway for a lot of dragons and the reason the Alexander the Great story is</p>
<p>so amazing is because he&rsquo;s just one of many over-the-top larger-than-life figures in it</p>
<p>he may be like Seinfeld in the TV series Seinfeld where everyone orbiting around him is a more</p>
<p>interesting figure although he&rsquo;s pretty damn interesting too but the story is so interesting</p>
<p>you can break pieces off of the main story and just examine them and get a kick out of</p>
<p>it I mean we&rsquo;ve done that before we&rsquo;ve mined the Alexander vein on this hardcore history</p>
<p>podcast already I mean the first show we did was called Alexander vs. Hitler then we did</p>
<p>one on what we called the Macedonian soap opera but the name you usually hear is the</p>
<p>funeral games the period after Alexander&rsquo;s death where there was this scramble for the</p>
<p>Empire and Alexander&rsquo;s mother was one of the key figures the Queen you might say on the</p>
<p>chessboard during that entire struggle so we&rsquo;ve dealt with her before but I was thinking</p>
<p>you know just reading these stories about how you don&rsquo;t have any content and everybody</p>
<p>wants to make a good strong female movie well how about the greatest story you&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>and I should point out that I was trying to use as my model for this conversation today</p>
<p>some of the earlier hardcore history shows we did because we used to think if we would</p>
<p>just name them in a very limited way so that we set the parameters with the title of the</p>
<p>show it would keep us from going too deep and getting out of hand that was when we were</p>
<p>young and we didn&rsquo;t know what we were doing and we didn&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s impossible so</p>
<p>what are we going to do we&rsquo;re going to try it again we don&rsquo;t learn from history but those</p>
<p>shows were shows like Nazi tidbits and thoughts on Churchill and meandering through the Cold</p>
<p>War you know sort of denotes that it&rsquo;s not going to be a deep and intensive look we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to hit some of the more interesting points worth discussing some people miss those</p>
<p>shows some people don&rsquo;t miss those shows so we&rsquo;re going to please about half of you now</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll call this today&rsquo;s show glimpses of Olympias as we look at the most interesting</p>
<p>female figure that I know of in the ancient world Alexander the Great&rsquo;s mom and I should</p>
<p>tell you and this is proof positive that I am a history geek because I have been giggling</p>
<p>to myself for like the last 24 hours I&rsquo;ve been reading the historian Elizabeth Carney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>book she&rsquo;s the only one who I think actually put a book out specifically about Olympias</p>
<p>Alexander&rsquo;s mom it&rsquo;s called Olympias and in it she addresses one of the let&rsquo;s call them</p>
<p>psychological profiles that people have attempted to make concerning Alexander for 2,500 years</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got to be the most psychoanalyzed historical figure from a long time ago that I can think</p>
<p>of and what&rsquo;s great about him of course is you can see him a thousand different ways</p>
<p>so take your pick but Elizabeth Carney was addressing this question that has arisen from</p>
<p>you know way back in the time when this phrase was actually in use but the question was was</p>
<p>Alexander the Great a mama&rsquo;s boy in air quotes mama&rsquo;s boy I don&rsquo;t even know what that means</p>
<p>anymore I think like Howard Wolowitz on the Big Bang Theory which makes that question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m snickering because was Alexander the Great a mama&rsquo;s boys funny on a couple</p>
<p>of different levels but they&rsquo;re history geek levels the first one is think about Alexander</p>
<p>the Great for a minute right I&rsquo;m thinking Howard Wolowitz instead we have a guy that</p>
<p>is responsible one way or another for the deaths of at least hundreds of thousands and</p>
<p>maybe millions of people conquered a ton of the known world during the time period</p>
<p>far beyond anything anybody thought possible remember this guy conquered from Greece to</p>
<p>India into India he fought elephants in the rainforest with Macedonian Greek soldiers</p>
<p>he did not do this from some command center way behind the lines instead he would lead</p>
<p>the decisive cavalry charge himself probably from the front of a wedge formation which</p>
<p>is like a pyramid and he&rsquo;d be the guy you know the star on the top of the Christmas</p>
<p>tree position the tip of the spear in the wedge so hardly a shrinking violet he was</p>
<p>known to drink other people under the table in drinking contests at parties and occasionally</p>
<p>at least on one occasion spear one of his best friends at one of these parties he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>strike me as the Howard Wolowitz stereotypically you know to mama&rsquo;s boy in air quotes but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny for another reason because Alexander was all those things I just mentioned a person</p>
<p>that has been seen as everything from a philosopher king to a genocidal thug and everything in</p>
<p>between he could have been all those things in his case and still been a mama&rsquo;s boy because</p>
<p>look at his mama this is the I&rsquo;m listen again limited knowledge this is the most formidable</p>
<p>woman in history as far as from a geopolitical sense anyway you can see women get involved in</p>
<p>stories in the past with these male writers from Greece and Rome and these people who had to</p>
<p>catalog them and they&rsquo;re often story props bits and pieces and furniture in great the stories of</p>
<p>great manner events sometimes they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re sort of the wicked Eve type of character where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the root of problems other times the they represent a religious and divine side of things</p>
<p>which is interesting and plays into this story too but as Elizabeth Carney points out in her</p>
<p>book Olympia&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really tough to tease out all of the stereotypes and the and the cultural</p>
<p>influences of all these ancient writers who would oftentimes excuse a male figure like an Alexander</p>
<p>for doing something you know horrible maybe they had to wipe out a village and a person like Plutarch</p>
<p>an ancient writer would say well it&rsquo;s a they have to do that it&rsquo;s sometimes you know real</p>
<p>politic or Machiavellian is the way we look at it now sometimes a man has to do what a man has</p>
<p>to do to move history forward or whatever the tough decisions but when a woman does the same</p>
<p>thing it gets attributed not to logical real-world questions but emotion you know it&rsquo;s envy it&rsquo;s spite</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the jealousy of a woman she was angry you know it&rsquo;s irrational right so just seeing it</p>
<p>through a lens where in a guy like Plutarch&rsquo;s time a person like Olympias looks pretty uppity</p>
<p>in fact though let&rsquo;s be honest Olympia looks uppity from the start it&rsquo;s part of what makes her fun</p>
<p>because if you look at the stew that she walked into when she joined the Macedonian royal family</p>
<p>how do you how do you not get killed in that environment first or how do you avoid trouble</p>
<p>to begin with most people would walk in there and go how do I stay out of trouble in this</p>
<p>environment she walked in and and well far from shrinking in a sense she took it over and she</p>
<p>scared the crap out of some of the most august over-the-top larger-than-life figures of their</p>
<p>time one of them was Philip II the guy she showed up to marry in 357 BCE so let&rsquo;s tell a little of</p>
<p>this story but like I said glimpses of Olympias because I don&rsquo;t want to get too deeply into it</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons including we&rsquo;ve talked about some of this stuff before I am saving most of this</p>
<p>stuff for the big Alexander show I have in my back pocket for some later date blueprint for</p>
<p>Armageddon was one of those shows we were saving for a while and when the centennial happened of</p>
<p>World War one boom we did that one I got the Alexander one in the future and I&rsquo;m hoping that</p>
<p>my super intense interest in this means a slightly better chance of a good show or shows so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to get too deeply into a bunch of stuff I&rsquo;m saving for that someday I will say and this is a</p>
<p>little bit of a tangent in this story that I usually point out is the most unbelievable</p>
<p>interesting historical tale of all time as you know whatever is true and whatever isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only been two movies attempted by Hollywood or at least released by Hollywood on this story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible just incredible to me and one was in 1956 and Richard Burton was Alexander the Great</p>
<p>there was another one that was supposed to be a movie ended up being downgraded and cut up to like</p>
<p>a TV movie like a sword and sandals Western thriller with William Shatner as Alexander the</p>
<p>Great sort of like Captain Kirk with blonde hair and a more falsetto we voice I like William Shatner</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s probably too happy with it either though and then the one done by Oliver</p>
<p>Stone not that long ago and I support an artist&rsquo;s right to look at a person like Alexander and his</p>
<p>era from a thousand different viewpoints because I think it lends itself to it it&rsquo;s part of the fun</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea I want to give him credit for something though because one thing he</p>
<p>did has stayed with me ever since and I actually can&rsquo;t get it out of my mind I have to confess to</p>
<p>it right now I didn&rsquo;t like his casting I found out he made the most maybe the most interesting</p>
<p>character in the story Val Kilmer is Philip the second come on but uh Alexander&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>is played by Angelina Jolie and I didn&rsquo;t like the casting and then I saw her and now I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>unsee it I think she&rsquo;s perfect at least you know everybody&rsquo;s got their image my image of the of</p>
<p>this person first of all I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the makeup or just how Jolie looks or some combination</p>
<p>of the two boy you she looks like my image of what a person in the northern greek southern Albania</p>
<p>area of Epirus would look like she looks the part to me and at the time she did the movie she really</p>
<p>seems to be of that age that most of Olympius&rsquo;s story seems to happen in where she&rsquo;s not a young</p>
<p>lady anymore and she&rsquo;s not an older lady anymore it&rsquo;s that middle range but she still commands</p>
<p>attention in a physical sense and there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for it it might not have just been</p>
<p>conventional beauty I mean the woman is supposed to have carried snakes around with her whether or</p>
<p>not that&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;ll make an impression right the stories are wonderful and watching Elizabeth</p>
<p>Carney try to make sense of what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not in the stories is fascinating the one thing</p>
<p>she does say though is the snakes were probably probably real so we should back up and talk about</p>
<p>the snakes and make sense of all this story for a minute Olympius ends up marrying this is why</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s famous right she marries the up-and-coming soon-to-be greatest man of her age in her world</p>
<p>the guy who would have been Alexander the Great had he not died he&rsquo;s one of these kings that</p>
<p>actually is maybe like the best example you will ever see who builds up everything necessary for</p>
<p>some great endeavor dies before he can carry it out hands over the you know the the car all gassed</p>
<p>up and ready to go to his son who then gets you know does it and gets credit for it Philip II is</p>
<p>the guy that set up the invasion of Persia he actually had a beachhead established in Persian</p>
<p>territory when he died Alexander grabbed the keys to the car and conquered you know half the known</p>
<p>world with it he was using basically the German Wehrmacht of 1940 right before the whole Russian</p>
<p>problem it was the greatest army of its time with a host of generals and marshals to help him out</p>
<p>right he had tutors right away and this group was in my top five of greatest assembly of generals</p>
<p>and marshals and and over the top military figures under a single great visionary leader you will</p>
<p>ever see Genghis Khan had a great group of generals Napoleon had I mean you know it is ever</p>
<p>has there ever been a better assembly of larger than life marshals and generals than Napoleon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>general staff people and then you have Alexander and Alexander&rsquo;s father and all these figures</p>
<p>who are not only going to play huge roles after his death and start whole kingdoms and dynasties</p>
<p>of their own but they&rsquo;re all these I mean right out of central casting I mean take Antigonus</p>
<p>monothomas Antigonus one eye he&rsquo;s got one eye he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s looks like I mean they always portray</p>
<p>him like this giant sort of bearded I mean they just the Greeks in Athens and Sparta looked at</p>
<p>the people up in Macedonia like they were kind of barbarians and the funny part about it is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sliding scale because the Macedonians were always trying to import all these Greek scholars and</p>
<p>and teachers and artwork and and all the stuff to try to gussy themselves up a little and and buff</p>
<p>up their image with those cultured southern Greeks who might be a little sniffy and effeminate but</p>
<p>whatever the Macedonians were moving up in the world during this time period trying to point</p>
<p>out to the other Greeks hey we&rsquo;re one of you we should be in the Olympics too and Philip was</p>
<p>allowed that early on that&rsquo;s why Olympius might have been named Olympius but if the Macedonians</p>
<p>were trying to not look so barbaric they looked at the people where Olympius&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>as as the weirdos 150 miles away that&rsquo;s part of the fun by the way of the ancient period</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s also localized sometimes I mean one of my favorite periods in Roman history is really</p>
<p>early on when Rome was a small city-state and it&rsquo;s having a war with another city-state and</p>
<p>that city-state&rsquo;s 11 miles away I mean in your big cities now that&rsquo;s like fighting with your suburbs</p>
<p>but I love the locality of it uh Macedonia and Epirus which is where um Olympius is from</p>
<p>only about 150 miles away you know over the mountains though and Epirus is a place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny how you can have this right where the Macedonians are a little leery of uh</p>
<p>Elizabeth Carney quotes some of the ancient stereotypes and says you know they thought</p>
<p>as poisoners and casters of spells now part of what makes this Olympia story uh interesting and</p>
<p>this is see this is my own take on it I try I&rsquo;ve never forgotten an experiment that a teacher did</p>
<p>with us back when I was uh first starting as a history major and it was just the first step in</p>
<p>what would if you carried it all the way to a PhD someday be a long line of trying to get you to purge</p>
<p>your period now from how you see other periods because it&rsquo;s this huge challenge right how do you</p>
<p>objectively look at the past when you&rsquo;ve got all these cultural influences influencing you</p>
<p>and to make it more complicated many of the historians you&rsquo;re reading had their cultural</p>
<p>influences working on them and so this teacher said let&rsquo;s imagine something for a second</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine that instead of like Newtonian laws of physics that we all take for granted and we know</p>
<p>are true right you substitute magic and you believe it as as rock solid with as much certitude</p>
<p>as we believe in the Newtonian laws of physics how does that change everything around you</p>
<p>and when you start thinking about it for a while you go wait a minute I mean for example um in this</p>
<p>world we live in now you have many different competing views on reality and you can almost</p>
<p>treat it like a buffet you can say I accept uh the hard sciences here but I&rsquo;m still into astrology</p>
<p>over there and I&rsquo;m a Catholic so I believe in that but I also just subscribe to this I mean</p>
<p>you can be able you have lots to choose from and there are arguments on all sides it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a buffet</p>
<p>of intellectual uh reality orientation for yourself most periods in human history don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>and in most periods of human history even where you could identify you could go to Athens in the</p>
<p>classical Greek period and say well there were some thinkers that clearly disagreed with the</p>
<p>idea that magic existed or anything they&rsquo;re like the top 0.03 percent of the population right if</p>
<p>the rest of the people believe in magic magic what does that mean and the reason I bring it up is</p>
<p>because the people that Olympia shows up to believe the people where she&rsquo;s from are casters of spells</p>
<p>and you know if you read the sources and you want to believe Olympia&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot</p>
<p>to dissuade them of that notion this was another thing that a teacher explained once a female</p>
<p>teacher was trying to explain again not taking your modern template and putting it over a past</p>
<p>era and trying to draw conclusions and she was talking about um like an equal rights thing</p>
<p>between women and men because we as students and this was the 1980s we were trying to figure out</p>
<p>how you didn&rsquo;t have more examples of societies where the 50 percent of the population that was</p>
<p>female overthrew the existing order right just said enough of being treated like you know slaves</p>
<p>or servants or chattel or property or whatever we&rsquo;ve had it and she said because in a lot of</p>
<p>these cultures they were culturally fit into their own places in society and these were not necessarily</p>
<p>as powerless as we assume they are because we&rsquo;re judging them the way we would judge power</p>
<p>does everybody have the same chance for example to lead the country or to be a general or to be</p>
<p>in these positions of authority right are women giving the same opportunities as men but in some</p>
<p>of these cultures they might not want that but they did have areas of their own power for example</p>
<p>in the greek world and places like macedonia and places like epirus heck in places like ancient</p>
<p>germany and and the kelton well a lot of other societies you can name the women were often</p>
<p>dominant in a religious area and not always as like the high priest but always in these</p>
<p>positions where they would have these relationships with the deity priestesses</p>
<p>if you look at alexander the great&rsquo;s mother and you look at her life and we&rsquo;ll look at some</p>
<p>highlights she comes out like a dungeons and dragons character sometimes i said there were</p>
<p>no dragons in this story but there are snakes she is a follower of dionysus one of the most</p>
<p>interesting gods if you go back and you study you know ancient greek mythology uh in a nutshell</p>
<p>mythology in a nutshell though you know uh my college buddies would say he&rsquo;s the god of partying</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so much deeper than that yes wine okay so they&rsquo;re drinking but there&rsquo;s ritual ecstasy</p>
<p>there may be sexual orgies there it&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s put it this way it&rsquo;s one of those things where i mean i</p>
<p>imagine one guy would wink at another guy and go you know she&rsquo;s a follower of dionysus um but in</p>
<p>the case of somebody like olympius it made her intimidating and the sources make it sound like</p>
<p>she intimidates philip the second philip the second how do you intimidate the greatest man</p>
<p>of his day and age uh let me read you peter green&rsquo;s description and i love peter green this</p>
<p>was written in 1970 but he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s one of those people who raised me on this era in this region</p>
<p>and i still feel like he sets up the legend let&rsquo;s call it the legend of olympus and how is there no</p>
<p>movie about this this woman let&rsquo;s he sets it up perfectly now remember she walks into a scene</p>
<p>let me set it up for you that&rsquo;s like a mafia crime family when oliver stone made his alexander film</p>
<p>there were rumors that martin scorsese had been thinking about making one of his own and i thought</p>
<p>oh that would be perfect because that would fit my image of the scene you know scorsese&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>godfather if you&rsquo;ll pardon the pun of the mafia genre of movies you could take that template</p>
<p>throw it over the macedonian royal house the dynamics of it add a lot more alcohol</p>
<p>and a lot of homosexuality and end up with something like the sopranos on a week-by-week</p>
<p>basis where somebody&rsquo;s getting whacked somebody&rsquo;s getting poisoned you don&rsquo;t have love triangles</p>
<p>you have love hexagons heck it&rsquo;s so violent you have love octagons imagine the complexity when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just dealing with the other woman because these macedonian kings often had multiple</p>
<p>wives you&rsquo;re dealing with all the male lovers of the macedonian king and you all may be jealous</p>
<p>and gossiping and talking with each other it is an explosive situation that leads to people</p>
<p>getting killed pretty often in macedonian history to show you how weird it can get by modern</p>
<p>standards at one point in this story olympius and philip will be marrying off their daughter</p>
<p>cleopatra who is alexander the great&rsquo;s full sister to olympius&rsquo;s brother also named alexander</p>
<p>of melosia so that&rsquo;s cleopatra&rsquo;s uncle they&rsquo;re wedding her too now alexander of melosia</p>
<p>cleopatra&rsquo;s uncle who is marrying cleopatra now is also rumored to have been the lover of philip</p>
<p>as well and philip kind of put alexander on the throne of papyrus so um it&rsquo;s a complicated dynamic</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it and if you&rsquo;re a fan of the ancient world this doesn&rsquo;t put you off this is part of</p>
<p>the attraction like going and being part of a landing party at a very strange planet where</p>
<p>the customs are very different here&rsquo;s what peter green wrote in 1970 about this young girl from</p>
<p>this out-of-the-way place known for poisoners and spell casters when she shows up in this</p>
<p>mafia cry they&rsquo;re not gambinos and bananas um they&rsquo;re arjeds they&rsquo;re the descendants of hercules</p>
<p>or heracles is the better word for it and she shows up and she&rsquo;s descended from her own royal</p>
<p>line which goes back to a different demigod achilles and she&rsquo;s proud of it and aware of it</p>
<p>and just like uh the fact that philip the second is proud and aware that he&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>descendant from heracles who&rsquo;s the son of zeus of course it influences the way her self-image</p>
<p>is and the way she expects to be treated and the way she&rsquo;ll conduct herself peter green writes quote</p>
<p>at all events in the autumn of 357 philip married as a pirate princess and for the first time in his</p>
<p>life found he&rsquo;d taken on rather more than he could handle olympius though not yet 18 had already</p>
<p>emerged as a forceful not to say eccentric personality she was among other things passionately</p>
<p>devoted to the orgiastic rites of dionysus and her menadic frenzies can scarcely have been conducive</p>
<p>to a peaceful domestic life one of her more outre habits unless as has been suggested it had a</p>
<p>ritual origin was keeping an assortment of large tame snakes as pets to employ these creatures on</p>
<p>religious occasions could raise no objections but their intermittent appearance in olympius&rsquo;s bed</p>
<p>must have been a hazard calculated to put even the toughest bridegroom off his stroke</p>
<p>our sources furthermore while admitting olympius&rsquo;s beauty describe her variously as sullen jealous</p>
<p>bloody-minded arrogant headstrong and meddlesome to these attributes we may add towering political</p>
<p>ambition and a literally murderous temper she was determined to be queen in something more than name</p>
<p>this did not endear her to the macedonian barons end quote i love that line from peter green where</p>
<p>he says that olympius gave philip ii maybe something he couldn&rsquo;t handle because if you</p>
<p>look at the history books this guy&rsquo;s mo is kind of that he&rsquo;s a guy no one else can handle and yet</p>
<p>this 17 or 18 year old pirate princess has given him trouble i should point out that when they get</p>
<p>married he&rsquo;s got some life experience on her too he&rsquo;s 25 i think he&rsquo;s already got a couple of wives</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not shrinking violets either he&rsquo;s married to an illyrian princess that if the</p>
<p>sources are to be believed is trained in hand-to-hand combat sword shield helmet the</p>
<p>whole thing so she&rsquo;ll kill you and he&rsquo;s not having any trouble handling her so what&rsquo;s so special about</p>
<p>olympius historian richard a gabriel wrote a whole book on philip ii and he tries to cut down</p>
<p>the list of the man&rsquo;s achievements his formidable nature and all that stuff to um a single paragraph</p>
<p>and this is the way he describes the guy and as i said you think to yourself this is not the kind</p>
<p>of person you would imagine having any trouble with anyone or putting up with any flack from anyone</p>
<p>gabriel writes quote philip ii of macedonia lived 382 bce to 336 bce father of alexander the great</p>
<p>dynastic heir to the arjed kings who traced their lineage to heracles son of the temened family from</p>
<p>argos that had ruled macedonia since the 8th century bce unifier of greece author of greece&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first federal constitution creator of the first national state in europe the first general of the</p>
<p>greek imperial age founder of europe&rsquo;s first great land empire and greece&rsquo;s greatest general was one</p>
<p>of the preeminent statesmen of the ancient world it was philip who saved macedonia from disintegration</p>
<p>military occupation and eventual destruction by securing it against external enemies and by</p>
<p>bringing into existence europe&rsquo;s first national territorial state an entirely new form of</p>
<p>political organization in the west he continues having made macedonia safe philip developed mining</p>
<p>agriculture urbanization trade commerce and greek culture and transformed a semi-feudal tribal</p>
<p>pastoral society into a centralized national state governed by a powerful monarchy and protected by</p>
<p>a modern army end quote and couldn&rsquo;t easily handle a 17 or 18 year old a pirate princess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating and listen timing is everything right i mean if this a pirate princess shows up</p>
<p>and marries some obscure balkan king who never does anything we never hear about her forceful</p>
<p>personality but because she joins the macedonian royal family when the macedonian historical stock</p>
<p>is about to go from nothing to spectacular she&rsquo;s there you know for the ride and she has a huge</p>
<p>influence on it and this forceful personality is going to get amplified by the growing power of the</p>
<p>macedonians on world affairs and this guy she marries is going to play a huge role in that</p>
<p>and then the son she sires is going to do the rest of it in 356 the year after the wedding</p>
<p>basically she and philip welcome young alexander into the world and now olympius&rsquo;s status changes</p>
<p>part of the reason maybe philip couldn&rsquo;t handle her the way he could some other wife is all of a</p>
<p>sudden she seems to be the mother of the prospective heir and that changes things and and her power</p>
<p>base forever afterwards is going to be this connection she has to alexander</p>
<p>normally in history the mother of a king gets left out of the question about the king&rsquo;s qualities i</p>
<p>mean this is even true up until recent times how often do you read about some historical figure</p>
<p>some great historical conqueror or unifier of states or however you want to frame it and then</p>
<p>someone speak about his mother you&rsquo;ll hear sometimes the whole uh you know the king has</p>
<p>a son who&rsquo;s a chip off the old block right looks just like his dad uh carries on the family mission</p>
<p>you can find that example all throughout history but you rarely hear someone say yes you know has</p>
<p>his mother&rsquo;s qualities but you do with alexander and you&rsquo;re tempted to suggest i mean this is just</p>
<p>my theory but it seems obvious to me you can send me an email and tell me how wrong i am because no</p>
<p>no worries there uh but i mean it almost seems like they&rsquo;d ignore it if they could but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>obvious they can&rsquo;t does that make sense he&rsquo;s so obviously a product heavily influenced by</p>
<p>his mother you&rsquo;d be a fool to deny it i i hate to think that that might just be a story i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>so when alexander&rsquo;s young supposedly uh the precocious nature of the child is noticed this</p>
<p>can all be stuff written after the fact alexander put out a ton of propaganda in his life</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s colored the narrative and polluted it ever since</p>
<p>now the two things that olympius traditionally brings to this alexander influence question are</p>
<p>you know her influences as a mother a close personal confidant and parent of alexander</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;d say her social influences and her dna so if the things olympius brings to</p>
<p>the table here the dna side&rsquo;s easy to understand i mean it sounds to me like uh if we were at a</p>
<p>cocktail party in modern times and philip and olympius were there and they didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>each other and they were just sort of talking for the first time and you overheard their conversation</p>
<p>and watched them they would be the kind of people you would go i wonder what kind of kids those two</p>
<p>people would have right so they sound like formidable people to begin with and the greeks</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about dna the way we do but they sure did think about things like lineage and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you hear all this talk about alexander&rsquo;s heracles is descended on this side and</p>
<p>achilles on that side because it has a lot of power if everybody buys into that alexander bought into</p>
<p>it and his mother and part of her role in all this is she&rsquo;s telling him this stuff and telling</p>
<p>him not to forget it one of her reputations historically speaking is that she&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>whispering into alexander&rsquo;s ear you know don&rsquo;t forget who you are</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget your lineage</p>
<p>so besides the dna the personality question that comes into play here and what she did to influence</p>
<p>that well this is where things get more interesting because this is where the magic gets involved</p>
<p>right if she&rsquo;s telling her son that he&rsquo;s not necessarily just a descendant from achilles</p>
<p>you know many generations up the family tree but perhaps that he&rsquo;s related to a god in a much more</p>
<p>close way than that that philip the second&rsquo;s not his dad zeus the king of the gods is his dad oh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s turn to plutarch shall we because he&rsquo;s so fun on stories like this but if they believed it</p>
<p>this is where the power of of mass collective belief right these people don&rsquo;t believe in the</p>
<p>newtonian laws of physics like we do they believe i mean plutarch&rsquo;s writing hundreds of years later</p>
<p>and says this note that there is no question is the way he phrases it quote as for the lineage</p>
<p>of alexander on his father&rsquo;s side he was a descendant of heracles through carinus and on</p>
<p>his mother&rsquo;s side a descendant of i believe it&rsquo;s iacus through neotolomus this is accepted without</p>
<p>any question he writes and plutarch writing hundreds of years later by the way talks about</p>
<p>philip meaning olympius at a religious festival once again olympius always sort of associated with</p>
<p>the mysteries of dionysus and i should apologize to dionysus i didn&rsquo;t mean to uh simply write him</p>
<p>off as just the god of partying earlier dionysus has a fertility connection it&rsquo;s a very powerful</p>
<p>old god in this uh in this pantheon and you wouldn&rsquo;t want to have him angry with you and no</p>
<p>one would during the time period so if you actually believe that olympius has some sort</p>
<p>of priestess-like connection to the god you might steer clear of her too</p>
<p>but as we said maybe more than dionysus we might be talking about someone</p>
<p>uh who at least people believed might be a little closer to the gods as we said plutarch wrote later</p>
<p>quote and he&rsquo;s talking about the night before philip marries olympius quote the night before</p>
<p>that on which the marriage was consummated the bride dreamed that there was a peel of thunder</p>
<p>and that a thunderbolt fell upon her womb and that thereby much fire was kindled which broke</p>
<p>into flames that traveled all about and then was extinguished at a later time too after the marriage</p>
<p>philip dreamed that he was putting a seal upon his wife&rsquo;s womb and the device of the seal as he</p>
<p>thought was the figure of a lion end quote gotta love the ancient history for the good weird stuff</p>
<p>uh apparently according to plutarch philip goes to a bunch of seers and asks them what does all</p>
<p>this mean and most of them say you got to keep a closer eye on your wife right make sure no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming into the marriage bed that you don&rsquo;t know about um but philip apparently if you believe</p>
<p>plutarch uh he seems less worried about that than what he does know about here&rsquo;s what plutarch says</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s quoting by the way another one of these seers that says quote a serpent was once seen lying</p>
<p>stretched out by the side of olympius as she slept and we are told that this more than anything else</p>
<p>dulled the ardor of philip&rsquo;s attentions to his wife so that he no longer came often to sleep</p>
<p>by her side either because he feared that some spells and enchantments might be practiced upon</p>
<p>him by her or because he shrank from her embraces in the conviction that she was the partner of a</p>
<p>superior being end quote understand this is the sort of stuff that alexander&rsquo;s propaganda might</p>
<p>wanted to play up but it&rsquo;s part of this character of this woman is it true it could be</p>
<p>is magic true no does it have an influence if people believe it yeah</p>
<p>if alexander was trying to make people think he was the son of a god</p>
<p>might a story like that you know help his case fake news goes way back</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s worth asking an obvious question and you can ask this about a lot of historical</p>
<p>events and the farther back in history you go the more easily you can ask it how much of this is</p>
<p>true how much of this is a story or a fable it&rsquo;s hard to know it&rsquo;s part of what makes the job of</p>
<p>historians and you know i&rsquo;m not one i&rsquo;m a fan i&rsquo;m an admirer from afar their jobs are fascinating</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re detectives they&rsquo;re doing investigative research they start with these sources that have</p>
<p>come down to us right somehow through all the fire and earthquakes and war and everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened since since early times information makes it through the pipeline but it&rsquo;s a tiny</p>
<p>tiny fraction of what was originally there and oftentimes you don&rsquo;t get it directly you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get a scroll from the alexandrian library so you can read ptolemy&rsquo;s memoirs you know in the original</p>
<p>right there you get copies of copies of copies and the people who write and do the copying this</p>
<p>was a by hand thing right are from much later eras with very different values and they copy what they</p>
<p>want and maybe the way they want part of the job of the historical investigator is to sit there and</p>
<p>sift through all that and it would be easy if all you had to deal with is a scroll from alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time and try to weed out alexander&rsquo;s personal propaganda that he embedded into it but then what</p>
<p>happens when a roman gets their hands on it to write the history of alexander hundreds of years</p>
<p>after alexander farther away from alexander than we are from george washington&rsquo;s time now</p>
<p>what sources are they using well theoretically they&rsquo;re going to libraries too and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know digging out scrolls and something like ptolemy&rsquo;s you know one of alexander&rsquo;s generals</p>
<p>you know his memoirs are going to be there theoretically and the historians can actually</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so fascinating can sit there and and connect data points and say well he was probably</p>
<p>using ptolemy&rsquo;s uh memoirs because this other guy says the same thing so i mean it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>detective work but it&rsquo;s ever changing and every time you find something new you have to alter the</p>
<p>paradigm a little and olympius is even harder for two reasons one because she&rsquo;s being written about</p>
<p>as an addendum to other stories right she&rsquo;s alexander&rsquo;s mother so when someone writes a</p>
<p>piece about alexander she&rsquo;s one of the characters in that story the other reason as we said is</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s a woman and when you think about the different copies and eras and filters that</p>
<p>this original story has to go through before it gets to us now you think about the different</p>
<p>attitudes towards women that the original macedonians had that alexander&rsquo;s propaganda</p>
<p>might have might have seen things by then you think about their changing status in roman times</p>
<p>then think about the post-roman world and and the middle ages when you&rsquo;ve got monks and scribes</p>
<p>copying this stuff in a religious context i mean this is hard stuff to try to figure out the stuff</p>
<p>we have from olympius or about olympius rather is is has made it through that same pipeline and so</p>
<p>trying to dissect the fables from the stories from the truth really difficult the one thing</p>
<p>you try to work on and hang everything on are these data points right data point number one</p>
<p>olympius marries philip seems to be a concrete moment this is a connect the dots game there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dot olympius gives birth to alexander the great boom another data point connect that dot</p>
<p>there are going to be periods in her life where we are missing data points right she&rsquo;s not part</p>
<p>of the alexander story nothing&rsquo;s going on with olympius now so fast forward and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>fast forward yada yada yada because we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on there are things we can infer</p>
<p>because we can see what&rsquo;s going on at the same time her husband philip is off doing his you know</p>
<p>making his obituary essentially he&rsquo;s piling up the achievements this is the period in his life</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s laid that foundation that we said earlier now he&rsquo;s capitalizing on it my mythical producer ben</p>
<p>had suggested casting some of these people and i thought you know like trying to figure out if you</p>
<p>like angelina jolie but you didn&rsquo;t like val kilmer as philip who would you like as philip</p>
<p>and i spent a stupid amount of time and a stupid amount of time to not have a better answer</p>
<p>researching actors and going back and watching clips on them it was silly and the best i came</p>
<p>up with although he&rsquo;s a lot better than a lot of the other ones i came up with i thought a 38 40</p>
<p>42 year old charles bronson would have met my view of it kind of he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got that look where you</p>
<p>could see him coming from that region he&rsquo;s not macedonian he&rsquo;s not even from the balkans he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lithuanian or latvian but i think his family you know go go back to like tatars from the step</p>
<p>i think like angelina jolie if you put you know his physical features in the hands of a good</p>
<p>makeup person you&rsquo;re going to get somebody that looks like they could play the role</p>
<p>in terms of the physicality of it and whatnot i messed around for again far too long with one of</p>
<p>those online beard creators where you upload a photo of charles bronson in this case and then</p>
<p>try to find a beard that fits him i couldn&rsquo;t find anything that even looked like it wasn&rsquo;t a joke</p>
<p>i know one of you out there will though i know how these things go so if you do it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get some barbarian looking beard don&rsquo;t fall for that demosthenes portrayal of the guy</p>
<p>this is a wealthy up-and-coming dude who wants to tell and show the greeks down south i mean</p>
<p>part of this is a pr campaign uh that he&rsquo;s a full-fledged member of the greek cultural club</p>
<p>i mean this is a guy you don&rsquo;t have to worry about letting him into the country club he won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>embarrass you look at these flashy suits he wears he&rsquo;s gonna be as turned out as he can be</p>
<p>while still appearing to be you know charles bronson i also think this will be a fun role</p>
<p>for charles bronson because uh you know there&rsquo;s all as we said the the um and and i think this</p>
<p>is a wonderful way of showing how weird this is because the cultural mores are so different</p>
<p>imagine charles bronson in one of those scenes where he has to be with one of the the male lovers</p>
<p>right even interacting with them in a way that implies that you don&rsquo;t have to see anything just</p>
<p>the implication can you think of a more awkward pairing i think that&rsquo;s perfect because um every</p>
<p>time you read about these things the historians always caution you about applying our modern</p>
<p>views because they they say the greeks didn&rsquo;t think about it the way we do it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much cultural um baggage concerned with it so you have to think about it in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally alien watching charles bronson in some sort of gay brokeback mountain brokeback</p>
<p>macedonian mountain scene is about as strange and sriracha sauce on vanilla ice cream that i can</p>
<p>imagine which is how the ancient world looks and feels like i said if you revel in that sort of</p>
<p>stuff um you know there you go it does uh depend on when you also uh create this charles bronson</p>
<p>character because he goes from what appears to be a pretty dashing character maybe a very rough</p>
<p>and tumble as my old history books used to say a macedonian ruler uh to somebody who degrades like</p>
<p>an nfl football player does over a 20-year career he&rsquo;s like jim otto a couple years after he marries</p>
<p>olympius he famously loses his eye and they&rsquo;re pretty sure it&rsquo;s been long debated but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty sure now that they found his skull and some of the bones in a famous tomb and the skull has</p>
<p>the little notch that the arrow left when it took out his eye and i think he suffers like five or</p>
<p>six life-threatening bad awful wounds over his lifetime and by the end of it he&rsquo;s just you can</p>
<p>see the physical toll the cost of this you know starting philip and sons right uh this family</p>
<p>business what it&rsquo;s done to him when alexander&rsquo;s growing up philip&rsquo;s gone a lot he&rsquo;s gone when</p>
<p>alexander&rsquo;s born this is maybe part of the reason that you see the influence that olympia&rsquo;s had on</p>
<p>him she&rsquo;s the primary family member there philip by the way this remarkable combination and you</p>
<p>see it from time to time in great figures of energy and genius it&rsquo;s a force multiplier either</p>
<p>one of those things without the other uh it&rsquo;s great to have but but you put them together and</p>
<p>you get guys like philip you look at philip&rsquo;s schedule and his data points are pretty well</p>
<p>attested it&rsquo;ll wear you out most of us anyway now philip&rsquo;s besieging this city in this year</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s besieging that city in that year holy cow but he&rsquo;s never at home he does want a son that none of</p>
<p>the cultured greeks in the south can sneer at the way they sneer at dad so he&rsquo;s bringing in the best</p>
<p>educators he giving him the best sort of cultural exposure you can he brings in aristotle to be his</p>
<p>tutor how&rsquo;s that for nouveau riche yeah get me the best what&rsquo;s his name aristotle bring him in here</p>
<p>and aristotle&rsquo;s not teaching alexander you know with a hundred other students in the symposium</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s teaching alexander with a couple of alexander&rsquo;s youthful friends that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the class all day long hang with aristotle absorb everything</p>
<p>alexander could of course uh famously recite passages from the great greek plays and dramas</p>
<p>and all these things you have a cultured guy here it&rsquo;s part of how you get that whole view</p>
<p>of him as a philosopher king a cultured man as a buddy of mine always likes to say</p>
<p>a cultured genocidal butcherous thug it&rsquo;s butcherous a word i&rsquo;ll have to call him on that</p>
<p>the whole period when alexander&rsquo;s growing up is one of those yada yada yada times you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>hear a lot of details except how precocious this guy is and all the portents are showing these</p>
<p>signs that he&rsquo;s going to be this amazing guy meanwhile philip is uh by hook or by crook</p>
<p>taking conquering uh somehow acquiring great wealth as he takes over minds um he&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>this huge player in greek politics and at a certain point he clashes with the other major</p>
<p>players you know there are certain city states that are well known athens sparta thebes those</p>
<p>are your big three usually and philip philip has a problem eventually with all of them</p>
<p>his encounters with sparta are famous because it&rsquo;s one of the great lines from sparta one of</p>
<p>the great diplomatic notes from them back to a demand involves philip because he was coming down</p>
<p>near sparta and he gives him one of those ultimatums that says if i have to come down there</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m paraphrasing uh and and destroy you i will you know make you all enslaved i will take</p>
<p>all your stuff you know all that kind of thing if i have to do that and the famous spartan answer and</p>
<p>they were known for very short as as few words as possible it&rsquo;s called the laconic style and the</p>
<p>spartan answer was just one word if that sounds really badass except the spartans did not come</p>
<p>out of their little enclave to play with philip at all right what does that say right we&rsquo;re badass</p>
<p>come and get us uh they stayed away and uh philip famously in 338 bce destroys greek freedom is the</p>
<p>way i always learned about it but you know you&rsquo;ll get different approaches whole different lenses</p>
<p>unified greece is a whole different way to look at it isn&rsquo;t it when he destroyed both those</p>
<p>armies at the battle of kyrinia the combined arms of thebes and athens and it wasn&rsquo;t all that close</p>
<p>famously leading the cavalry charge his young i think he was 17 or 18 years old his young son</p>
<p>alexander right you get your 17 or your 18 year old kid at the tip of the spear there dad</p>
<p>welcome to the homeric ethos and action right so olympius&rsquo;s data points re-enter the picture here</p>
<p>as philip is beginning to get to the height of his power he&rsquo;s doing so many amazing things and</p>
<p>is being recognized as this huge historical figure that alexander supposedly says i think it&rsquo;s plutarch</p>
<p>that says that he&rsquo;s not going to leave anything for me or the functional equivalent he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>do everything you can do alexander was chomping at the bit i like elizabeth carney the historian</p>
<p>who points out that there&rsquo;s this usual relationship between kings and their sons that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>strange right because sometimes the son is the king in waiting just sort of waiting for the dad</p>
<p>to die even if you like the guy the dad however may have several different sons that could get</p>
<p>the kingship in the system like the macedonians so that explains carney thought one explanation</p>
<p>anyway why alexander might be close to his mother she and he had the same interest in him philip</p>
<p>ends up you know he&rsquo;s got a son uh about alexander&rsquo;s age right around named philip erodeus is the way</p>
<p>history describes him he&rsquo;s uh he&rsquo;s interesting he&rsquo;s described all kinds of different ways he</p>
<p>sounds like he&rsquo;s got some sort of mental disability it&rsquo;s obscure i think it&rsquo;s plutarch i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>which of the ancient historians starts the rumor that it was olympius who poisoned him and gave him</p>
<p>that malady don&rsquo;t you love that i mean if you&rsquo;re gonna have a bad guy in the story anybody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in alexander&rsquo;s way who has anything wrong with him might be the witch i mean the priestess</p>
<p>but alexander runs into some trouble as philip is is reaching his ascent and he&rsquo;s planning this</p>
<p>crusade against persia right this is going to be philip&rsquo;s crown and glory he&rsquo;s going to go back and</p>
<p>this is the way the propaganda sells it and pay the persians back for that whole invasion thing</p>
<p>that happened you know with the we are spartans thing more than a century before you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>getting mad at somebody for something that happened in the late 1800s and saying we&rsquo;re finally back</p>
<p>you know you thought we forgot about that no uh philip uh gets a bridgehead going in asia</p>
<p>he creates a league of greek states uh the macedonians didn&rsquo;t rule like god kings this</p>
<p>was a way to do it in a very modern fashion where everybody just is in the greek version of nato</p>
<p>or the warsaw pact or whatever and we&rsquo;re all in this together right and by the way</p>
<p>who is the leader of the group you guessed it the boss of bosses philip the moment where</p>
<p>olympia comes back into the story is when philip takes another wife</p>
<p>the same year that this crusade against persia is announced philip marries cleopatra</p>
<p>now the macedonian history is really hard to follow because they seem to have only had like</p>
<p>nine names or ten names for people and they just reoccur all the time so you get easily confused</p>
<p>cleopatra uh one of those names you see all the time it&rsquo;s not egyptian it&rsquo;s greek and macedonian</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the names i mean alexander&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s name is cleopatra this cleopatra</p>
<p>is the niece of a guy named atlas atlas is one of these important macedonian barons</p>
<p>one of these people that you know are part of the family right we&rsquo;re marrying ourselves together</p>
<p>even more uh we need each other philip needs these people to um they&rsquo;re the best cavalry</p>
<p>in greece he needs them to be on his side and everybody happy so they&rsquo;re going to marry into</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s families and then there&rsquo;s an incident recounted this is part of the macedonian soap opera</p>
<p>thing um where stuff just goes down at a drinking party now if you&rsquo;re a substance abuse counselor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to notice right away that it is probably not smart certainly not by modern standards</p>
<p>to get a whole bunch of these powerful and important people together and they&rsquo;re an emotional</p>
<p>lot by the way but they&rsquo;re all killers in their time period a lot of people were killers right i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to make that sound so extra bad they&rsquo;re not charles manson but these are all</p>
<p>very experienced men kind of hard men uh and they like to drink and they don&rsquo;t like to drink in</p>
<p>moderation one of the critiques that the greeks always had about these people is that they do not</p>
<p>drink wine mixed with water like cultured people do they drink the wine straight and they have</p>
<p>drinking contests this is something that&rsquo;s hard to understand but you have to imagine very big</p>
<p>containers full of wine and then men drinking at the same time and you know the guy who drinks</p>
<p>longer wins but when you read the accounts of this it&rsquo;s crazy and by the way these guys are</p>
<p>all there&rsquo;s weapons everywhere i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a dangerous environment for people to be</p>
<p>um dead drunk in i mean what if you said something in this mafia-like crime family</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t politically correct about somebody who was really powerful</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the story take it or leave it um but it&rsquo;s famous a lot of you know it already there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a drinking party where uh this marriage is being celebrated and atlas this important macedonian</p>
<p>general and baron and everything else is supposed to give a toast something about it&rsquo;s phrased</p>
<p>different ways you know hoping that this provides uh an air but the suggestions in many of the</p>
<p>pieces of literature hopefully provides a legitimate air or a true air or a true full</p>
<p>blood macedonian air remember alexander who is the air has a mother who&rsquo;s not macedonian at all</p>
<p>so what is atlas saying here well in the story that&rsquo;s exactly what alexander says</p>
<p>loud and in front of the whole group of people i remember the richard burton portrayal you know</p>
<p>a cup is thrown and he says are you calling me a bastard or i hope i&rsquo;m remembering the</p>
<p>richard burton portrayal then you have the moment where philip supposedly drunk as a skunk</p>
<p>and now even more broken down you know with a uh spear wound and he&rsquo;s lame and and he gets up from</p>
<p>the table and supposedly pulls a uh a sword almost against alexander which leads alexander</p>
<p>to believe wait why didn&rsquo;t dad get up and defend me in front of that that scurrilous charge right</p>
<p>there which leads to a break in the family and alexander and his mom leave macedonia go back</p>
<p>to epirus and things are chilly philip does not need this kind of problem right away i mean this</p>
<p>is his really dramatic wife and once again there&rsquo;s problems she&rsquo;s got the air i got problems with</p>
<p>atlas now i should point out that there&rsquo;s been lots of speculation and opinions and views of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here this would have been something that would have been hard to figure out</p>
<p>at the time with the sources that we have that we&rsquo;re working with you know it&rsquo;s open for argument</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna try to parse it except to point out that some of the obvious points that have</p>
<p>been made about this when you marry a queen to solidify a diplomatic agreement and that queen</p>
<p>goes back home to her family uh maybe with you know tales of insults to their lineage i mean this</p>
<p>is again the same sort of um thing that will get you whacked in a mafia crime family if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disrespected and she goes back to her brother maybe the former lover of philip at one time</p>
<p>and basically you know she looks like a queen that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>maltreated what does that do to the diplomatic agreement</p>
<p>philip is in a position now where he&rsquo;s kind of uniting all the different families that he&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>together so that they can go off and get this big score that this easy pickens that persia looks like</p>
<p>at this point it looks like it&rsquo;s just there who&rsquo;s going to be the first guy to walk in they&rsquo;ve left</p>
<p>the door open the alarm doesn&rsquo;t work the security guards old and senile it&rsquo;s just there come on all</p>
<p>we got to do is unite and go take that right we&rsquo;ll all be you know kings of the world basically he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just got to keep this fractious coalition of greek states that were only you know cooperating because</p>
<p>he beat them macedonian barons that are always kind of unreliable and and jockeying for you know</p>
<p>closer family ties guys like atlas you could easily see as as an underboss or a boss from a</p>
<p>different family uh that&rsquo;s working with philip now but he&rsquo;s got to be kept happy one of the ways</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kept happy is you marry my niece right uh but marrying my niece causes problems with one of your</p>
<p>wives the mother of the air see it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a soap opera but it&rsquo;s murderous because a lot of people</p>
<p>are going to die because of this uh dynamic at this time olympius and alexander for a short time</p>
<p>worry it might be them but philip is far too smart for this you don&rsquo;t get to where he is without</p>
<p>realizing that this can&rsquo;t work so uh in what elizabeth carney historian elizabeth carney says</p>
<p>is almost certainly a sort of um amending fences sort of affair he arranges another wedding i mean</p>
<p>what do you do right this is the standard approach this wedding is going to strike us all is very</p>
<p>incestuous what he&rsquo;s going to do is he&rsquo;s going to marry his daughter who is also olympius&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s got a lot of wives but this one is alexander&rsquo;s full sister cleopatra he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>marry cleopatra to olympius&rsquo;s brother her uncle former lover probably of her father</p>
<p>and going to just double down on the family relationship there if this is for diplomatic</p>
<p>purposes you can almost see philip not wanting to do any of this but he&rsquo;s got to keep that</p>
<p>important area pacified and with him so he can conduct this long-awaited thing in persia</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already got an advanced party of his generals who&rsquo;ve conquered a little bridgehead over there so</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re ready to go so as part of the ceremonies for this wedding where cleopatra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to marry her uncle philip throws a big bash this is his coming out party this is 25</p>
<p>years or something of work on his part to create this moment he&rsquo;s going to bask in it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to bask in it he invites all the big dignitaries all the top people the ambassadors the</p>
<p>performers everything today we would call it a star-studded affair right the media would all be</p>
<p>there he has a bunch of gold statues made for all the gods and then one other one that just happens</p>
<p>to be him think of the significance of that so this is this multi-day affair supposedly for a</p>
<p>wedding ceremony but in reality a hugely political event</p>
<p>and of course this is going to be a highly choreographed affair isn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>staged and everything is going to be done for a reason it&rsquo;s supposed to convey something</p>
<p>maybe the same thing that having 12 statues of gods and a 13th of the you know main guy actually</p>
<p>the father of the bride that maybe symbolizes something too maybe 13 is an unlucky number too</p>
<p>the way this thing is staged is philip is going to come out in front of a crowd in the amphitheater</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to have alexander his son you know someday to be the great with him that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a symbol right and basically embracing my son here in front of the crowd he must have gone to him and</p>
<p>said something like hey we were chug-a-lugging wine until one person in the contest passed out</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t hold me to account for something i didn&rsquo;t notice that you know bygones bygones who</p>
<p>knows but alexander&rsquo;s there with him the other alexander right philip&rsquo;s brother-in-law the one</p>
<p>that he may have had an affair with the one that&rsquo;s marrying his daughter he&rsquo;s there too</p>
<p>and then philip&rsquo;s got bodyguards right because this is the boss of bosses there&rsquo;s always somebody</p>
<p>who wants to get him demosthenes in athens years before basically said this is a hunted man</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got seven famous bodyguards and maybe another guy but he tells them to stand off</p>
<p>famously because he&rsquo;s trying to show these people in the audience these dignitaries</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not some guy that needs to be afraid of enemies i don&rsquo;t have enemies right people love</p>
<p>me i&rsquo;m a uniter not a divider i mean it&rsquo;s an important piece of symbolism to show that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to have bodyguards i&rsquo;m not in danger he is however falling apart physically i mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking a spear through the knees so he&rsquo;s limping out there he&rsquo;s missing the eyes got about he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>showing all of his 46 years and according to the ancient sources he gets to the center</p>
<p>of this theater and once again you have to think that this is the man&rsquo;s the highlight of this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life so far with great things on the horizon olympius is thought to be in the audience by the</p>
<p>way there was some disagreement on this sometimes but i mean peter green i think uh elizabeth carney</p>
<p>i think they think she was there uh but you know this is her brother marrying her daughter you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a family affair i would think she&rsquo;d be there and that&rsquo;s part of the reconciliation right</p>
<p>all&rsquo;s good with the royal family don&rsquo;t worry um and if she is she gets to watch</p>
<p>a man run out to the center of the theater and plunge a dagger into the ribs of philip ii</p>
<p>in front of everybody all these people he invited to his assassination unwittingly</p>
<p>and history turns on a dime here because most of history as we know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an accumulation of a</p>
<p>ton of trends and chaotic things all pinging off each other you know and and even when things seem</p>
<p>to go quickly sometimes if you examine it you go well you can see that the roots of this go very</p>
<p>deep and the seeds were planted a long time ago for this event but sometimes earthquakes happen</p>
<p>in history and stuff that lee harvey oswald shoots john f kennedy if that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>boom what is that that&rsquo;s a historical earthquake and everything&rsquo;s different afterwards and how</p>
<p>scary that one guy maybe all by his little lonesome self changes the world so dramatically</p>
<p>and what if he wasn&rsquo;t acting alone all those things apply to what happens to philip</p>
<p>it is the great john f kennedy assassination of this time period in this this area</p>
<p>the greatest man in the world was just killed by somebody in front of everybody</p>
<p>right before he&rsquo;s about to embark on this historic mission right he&rsquo;s basically declared war almost</p>
<p>against the persian empire and then this happens well if you think about it that doesn&rsquo;t sound too</p>
<p>coincidental though does it first of all let&rsquo;s go to the sources because um the reason that philip</p>
<p>ends up in this situation is part of the macedonian soap opera remember we talked about</p>
<p>love octagons what does a love octagon look like shall we go to diodorus siculus the ancient writer</p>
<p>all these people writing a long time after these events we presume using some sources that have now</p>
<p>you know been lost to us but who the hell knows</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll pick up diodorus&rsquo;s account uh when he talks about philip coming into the theater right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got this uh this this conquering moment in his life with greater things even to come</p>
<p>quote once the theater had been filled philip himself entered wearing a white cloak he ordered</p>
<p>his bodyguards to follow removed at some distance from him as an indication to everyone that he had</p>
<p>indication to everyone that he had no need of the protection of guards such was the degree of</p>
<p>pre-eminence that he had attained but amid the encomia of everyone as they were congratulating</p>
<p>him an unbelievable and totally unexpected plot against the king came to light that was to bring</p>
<p>about his death end quote congratulating maybe i mean we may be talking about applause there like</p>
<p>a theater people applauding him and lauding him you know as he garland&rsquo;s being thrown his way i</p>
<p>mean i guess if this has to happen to you maybe this is the time i don&rsquo;t know what you would</p>
<p>choose if you could choose but then diodorus diverts from what&rsquo;s about to happen to go into</p>
<p>the roots of what&rsquo;s about to happen and it involves two people named pausanias again we get confused</p>
<p>here right not only do these macedonians have a limited number of names they keep changing them</p>
<p>sometimes in their lifetime both of these figures are named pausanias this is what diodorus says and</p>
<p>now think soap opera and now think murderous soap opera quote in order that our account of this</p>
<p>matter may be clear we shall first explain the causes of the plot he says quote there was a</p>
<p>macedonian named pausanias who originated in the canton known as arrestus he was a bodyguard of</p>
<p>the king and loved by philip for his good looks on observing that another man of the same name</p>
<p>as himself was becoming the object of the king&rsquo;s affections he abused the second pausanias by</p>
<p>calling him an effeminate who was willing to submit to the erotic advances of anyone who desired to</p>
<p>initiate them end quote richard gabriel says it&rsquo;s the equivalent of calling someone a male prostitute</p>
<p>sounds like he&rsquo;s saying you use a male slut what would the reaction be to that especially from</p>
<p>another guy who was probably sleeping with philip well according to diodorus this second pausanias</p>
<p>unable to tolerate the insult he said for a time kept his mouth shut and then diodorus goes to</p>
<p>describe how he throws himself heroically and recklessly in front of the king to protect him</p>
<p>you know as a bodyguard but essentially committing suicide by heroic act and it made atlas mad</p>
<p>atlas you may remember uh the bride&rsquo;s uh uncle in this whole wedding ceremony</p>
<p>apparently atlas got mad that this pausanias guy the good one who threw his life away had to throw</p>
<p>his life away so he decided to punish the initial pausanias guy and the story of how he does that</p>
<p>is positively triggering for some people so i apologize if this is hardcore because it is</p>
<p>welcome to the ancient world diodorus writes quote when this incident became widely known</p>
<p>atlas who was a courtier and exercised a good deal of influence with the king</p>
<p>invited pausanias to dinner and filling with vast quantities of unmixed wine handed his body</p>
<p>over to his stableman to abuse sexually in a drunken rape on sobering up from his intoxication</p>
<p>he pausanias was extremely bitter about the physical abuse he had suffered and accused atlas</p>
<p>before the king philip though incensed at the enormity of atlas&rsquo;s transgression was nevertheless</p>
<p>unwilling to show his abhorrence because of his kinship with him and his present need of his</p>
<p>services end quote so in order to punish this guy for uh for his actions against the other pausanias</p>
<p>atlas has the guy basically date rapes him right he gets him drunk on wine throws him to the stable</p>
<p>mates and it&rsquo;s a male gang rape and pausanias is upset about that as you might imagine someone</p>
<p>would be he goes to perhaps his former lover philip the king and says atlas did this to me</p>
<p>do something about it and he can&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s just married himself to atlas&rsquo;s niece to try to you</p>
<p>know make the relationship more stable atlas is one of the generals who&rsquo;s commanding the bridgehead</p>
<p>in asia he can&rsquo;t upset atlas so he gives this pausanias guy a lot of other things to compensate</p>
<p>him right uh here&rsquo;s some stuff here i&rsquo;ll promote you into the bodyguard all these things just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be mad but he&rsquo;s mad if you believe the sources anyway and instead of just wanting to get even</p>
<p>against the person who set up his gang rape he wants to get even with the guy who didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything about it when he complained he went to the godfather and the godfather didn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>so he whacks philip a knife to the ribs</p>
<p>after stabbing philip pausanias runs out of the theater he is pursued by several of philip&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bodyguards some run to philip he&rsquo;s almost certainly already dead by the time they get there this seems</p>
<p>to have been i mean these these guys were warriors i mean this is a professional hit he would have</p>
<p>known just where to stab somebody philip&rsquo;s probably dead by the time the bodyguards get to him</p>
<p>the other bodyguards take off after pausanias and he would have gotten away deodorus says he has</p>
<p>horses waiting for him right at the ready the getaway car so to speak in ancient terms but he</p>
<p>trips on a vine with his sandals and goes sprawling in the dust and the bodyguards catch up to him and</p>
<p>spear him right there and kill him it&rsquo;s a little jack ruby ish though isn&rsquo;t it and people have</p>
<p>been wondering ever since that moment was pausanias acting alone and i was going through a</p>
<p>bunch of the different theories and and the number one theory just like the jfk assassination is</p>
<p>pausanias might have been acting exactly the way these ancient writers said jilted uh male lover</p>
<p>the godfather didn&rsquo;t i mean the whole thing we just described that can be absolutely true</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other things involved though too a lot of people wanted philip dead demosthenes</p>
<p>said that a long time earlier he was giving his speeches warning about philip he basically said</p>
<p>he has a lot of enemies he won&rsquo;t be around forever lasted longer than some might have thought</p>
<p>actually the ancient writers of course having a woman to potentially link to it often do</p>
<p>and the rumor was that olympius was seen at the grave of uh the assassin putting garlands on it</p>
<p>or something like that decorating or honoring the grave of pausanias later she&rsquo;s tied to it</p>
<p>the idea being that you know her status in the court had been very precarious this was supposed</p>
<p>to be a sort of a makeup affair but philip also might have insulted her family this this family</p>
<p>descended from achilles it was very proud in this um ethical world where that was a very big deal</p>
<p>you can get whacked for that right i mean we talked about how precarious being a macedonian</p>
<p>ruler was anyway it was one of the things that had kept the kingdom down for so long</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t keep a good king around the second they became too powerful somebody wanted to take</p>
<p>them down a peg right the last thing you want is a perpetual boss of bosses if you think someday</p>
<p>you might be the boss of bosses and that&rsquo;s not a pipe dream if you&rsquo;re the mother of the air because</p>
<p>very quickly after philip is stabbed alexander is acclaimed the king and the macedonians do a</p>
<p>thing where they kind of have the the people acclaim the king and there&rsquo;s a lot of argument</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s real or whether it&rsquo;s a bunch of nobles who get out and say get out there and raise</p>
<p>your hands and say you know hail the new king who the hell knows uh but it goes back to that</p>
<p>homeric ethos too it&rsquo;s not a god king it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sort of an acclaimed king and so if you had something</p>
<p>to do with the assassination and you&rsquo;re olympius you just solved all your problems she made out</p>
<p>like a bandit a lot of the people i&rsquo;ve read lately are of you know this changes are of the opinion</p>
<p>that olympius probably didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with what happened to philip and that neither did</p>
<p>alexander if only because they had no need to kill him in public in front of a lot of people</p>
<p>they had access to him in private right this could have been done nicely quietly a little poison in</p>
<p>the right place and who would have known this guy is murdered in front of a giant crowd of admirers</p>
<p>in public i mean today would be the equivalent of having it happen on live television</p>
<p>and the star of the show is the one who&rsquo;s killed the greatest man in the history of this region</p>
<p>right just when they&rsquo;re celebrating it some of the other people who are implicated though make</p>
<p>a lot of sense the athenians could have hired an assassin they would have loved to have seen</p>
<p>philip out of the way but maybe most likely on this assassination you know hitler&rsquo;s who paid for</p>
<p>the the killing you know who hired murder incorporated the persians i&rsquo;m a fan of the</p>
<p>persians as many of you know and one of the wonderful things about them is they had a</p>
<p>government that just did not function well and they figured out ways around it and the number</p>
<p>one way around it was money they had a lot of money and they figured out ways to have money</p>
<p>do things for them so they couldn&rsquo;t beat the greeks on the battlefield because of tactical</p>
<p>dissimilarities between their armies okay well spend a lot of money have the greeks fight each</p>
<p>other that was wonderful they called it the peloponnesian war uh it kept the greeks busy</p>
<p>for a long time kept them out of persia&rsquo;s hair persia has no doubt that uh philip&rsquo;s coming to</p>
<p>invade them he&rsquo;s already basically publicly proclaimed it he&rsquo;s conquered a little territory</p>
<p>already to establish a beachhead as we said he&rsquo;s making inroads diplomatically with some of the</p>
<p>satraps you know closest to him it&rsquo;s going to happen so if you kill him maybe it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but as several of these historians point out the persians probably did not have somebody so inside</p>
<p>the royal family that they could do it quietly and that so they had to kind of do it in public or</p>
<p>you never know this might be a statement right especially if you&rsquo;re pausanias and you really are</p>
<p>acting because you were gang raped and um you know you&rsquo;re not going to be disrespected like that</p>
<p>it all boils down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to trust these ancient writers</p>
<p>who preserve the details of these incidents or what they say are the details or what they heard</p>
<p>were the details or what the source they were using said were the details you can see why</p>
<p>so many historians would love if they could just throw all this stuff out as unreliable and biased</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things but if you do you&rsquo;re not left with a whole lot of information</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not left with a whole lot right i mean for example coinage and inscriptions and stuff</p>
<p>like that will tell you that during this time period there was a change in leadership from</p>
<p>philip king of macedonia to alexander king of macedonia but it probably won&rsquo;t tell you why</p>
<p>and it certainly won&rsquo;t give you any details but that leaves the experts trying to pick out the</p>
<p>fact from the fiction and well as you might imagine it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tough and views change and</p>
<p>differ reminds me again a little of the kennedy assassination we have a lot of different theories</p>
<p>here and when you hear the rationales for them you kind of go i kind of go with a bunch of them</p>
<p>going yeah that makes sense and then i read the next one but yeah that makes sense</p>
<p>in the 1970s when i read alexander of macedon peter green was firmly in the camp of those who</p>
<p>thought olympius and alexander did it a dynastic hit now his views may have updated since then i</p>
<p>should point out an update it doesn&rsquo;t mean better because there&rsquo;s a whole lot of people still think</p>
<p>olympius and alexander did it but the story you know you want to compare it to the jfk assassination</p>
<p>which is a fascinating story of course at the same time it makes it look so vanilla and boring by</p>
<p>comparison i mean for example if you want the analogy here that starts the the mind reeling</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have jackie kennedy basically at the root of the plot to kill her husband</p>
<p>right when he gets killed in the limo next to her she set that up if she&rsquo;s olympius and</p>
<p>you believe that particular conspiracy theory what&rsquo;s more the person if you believe oswald</p>
<p>took a shot at jfk that person is encouraged by jackie kennedy to do the deed and oswald of</p>
<p>course would have had to have a sexual relationship previously with jfk see how weird it gets on how</p>
<p>quickly remember how wild some of the accusations from the ancient writers can get here saying that</p>
<p>olympius placed a gold crown on the assassin&rsquo;s head the assassin was nailed to it like a cross</p>
<p>or a gibbet and that she placed a gold crown on his head and then had uh it this the ashes spread</p>
<p>over philip&rsquo;s grave that every year on the anniversary of the murder she poured libations</p>
<p>and offerings over them that she obtained the murder weapon and dedicated it to apollo</p>
<p>and used her maiden name when she did a lot of accusations right well peter green suggests back</p>
<p>in the 1970s anyway a possible way it all goes down and it starts with olympia&rsquo;s working her</p>
<p>sorceress like magic psychologically speaking on the lee harvey oswald in this story</p>
<p>i mean plutarch has olympius doing the initial inciting of pausanias going up and playing on</p>
<p>his grievances and exhorting him to do this we should recall by the way uh the version i gave</p>
<p>of the pausanias date rape thing that&rsquo;s the mild one the more severe one is that this all happened</p>
<p>at a party and that atlas the guy who organized the whole thing was one of the people who date</p>
<p>raped him before turning him over to the grooms who continued the process and then beat him up</p>
<p>afterwards the point of the story is that this guy&rsquo;s humiliation would have been known to</p>
<p>basically everybody imagine how quickly that gossip got around with all the people that mattered in</p>
<p>his life in a culture of a heroic ethos clan loyalties grievances uh generational feuds um</p>
<p>how do you think this person&rsquo;s gonna gonna be thinking of himself anyway he&rsquo;s humiliated and</p>
<p>if olympius goes to him and and commiserates with him and tells him that this can all be remedied</p>
<p>right we can just put somebody else in power not connected to your whole deed and all these</p>
<p>bad people including atlas will go away and i can think of a whole lot of different appeals that</p>
<p>might have been used on a guy like pausanias starting with the most real world bedrock</p>
<p>one of all how about some money or how about you pull this off get rid of the old king the new king</p>
<p>takes over the new king is going to forgive you make you a valued member of your honor</p>
<p>based society again you will prosper your enemies will pay that&rsquo;s a pretty good incentive in any</p>
<p>time and place for a lot of people isn&rsquo;t it then of course there&rsquo;s the other tradition about what</p>
<p>was maybe going on here and that&rsquo;s that olympius was in the assassin&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>psychologically manipulating him like jackie kennedy working on oswald psychologically</p>
<p>there were no doctorate degrees in psychology in the ancient world that i know of but let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>pretend that the ancients especially the ancient greeks didn&rsquo;t understand human</p>
<p>psychological makeup i mean go look at their plays it&rsquo;s a key integral part of a lot of them</p>
<p>they explore the issue intensely to me when i do my movie it&rsquo;s not going to be a movie it has to</p>
<p>be more like a game of thrones now that i think about it long term sort of thing because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too many characters that come in and out you can hardly learn the names they die and much more</p>
<p>suited to that um but in in the movie i&rsquo;m gonna have uh my moment when olympius goes to pausanias</p>
<p>and gets up in his head i&rsquo;m gonna have her come to him and maybe she did dressed the way some of</p>
<p>these ancient writers describe the dionysian priestesses they carry wands one of them said</p>
<p>they carry wands like magic wands uh some of them wrapped with ivy which was a sacred plant i guess</p>
<p>others dripping honey which is very symbolic if you think about the god of fertility and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff and and wine and all that um and that there were snakes everywhere sometimes on</p>
<p>the wands wrapped around them i think it was plutarch said freaking the man out so she&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to come in my uh long-term hbo miniseries um she&rsquo;s going to come to pausanias and she&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>in his head and she&rsquo;s going to promise a very dionysian thing to promise because remember</p>
<p>dionysus is you know the apollonian tradition according to nietzsche anyway and others is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the rational side of the human mind the logic and all that it&rsquo;s all the other stuff that</p>
<p>dionysus controls the hidden stuff these uh the subconscious the emotional the inspirational the</p>
<p>madness i mean heck acting and most of the arts are dionysian uh at their root</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little mysterious right it&rsquo;s very mysterious to us now looking back in the</p>
<p>ancient world but even in the ancient world it was kind of mysterious it was part of the</p>
<p>attraction and she represents this now another name see this is how i&rsquo;m going to do it as the</p>
<p>producer of this thing the other name for dionysus that dionysus was known as was the liberator</p>
<p>right frees you from care worry sorrow pain the the good side of what wine might do to you</p>
<p>especially in the ancient world versus the destructive nature which is the divine madness</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff although she wouldn&rsquo;t have seen that as destructive that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>good things right well she is promising as a priestess for the liberator maybe</p>
<p>to liberate pausanias from his cares and worries and this hell that he lives in</p>
<p>we should also point out that she&rsquo;s the one who supposedly has horses waiting for the conspirators</p>
<p>right so remember there&rsquo;s not one horse waiting the tradition has multiple horses there multiple</p>
<p>getaway vehicles why do you need multiple horses if you only have one assassin</p>
<p>peter green has a 1970s rundown of how it might have happened and he writes quote</p>
<p>from these facts we may perhaps form a hypothesis as to how philip&rsquo;s murder was planned and carried</p>
<p>out pausanias still hot with resentment at the abominable way he had been treated</p>
<p>was approached probably by olympius and promised high rewards and honors if he would join with his</p>
<p>three kinsmen from orestes in assassinating the king i should point out those three kinsmen</p>
<p>were philip&rsquo;s bodyguards so the guys who jack ruby&rsquo;d him in a minute are the guys who are</p>
<p>supposed to work with him in the assassination this is going to be very joker like from batman</p>
<p>green continues quote olympius undertook to have horses ready for all four of them afterwards but</p>
<p>what pausanias clearly did not know was the real role assigned to his fellow conspirators those</p>
<p>trusted intimates of alexander their business was not the removal of philip it was to silence him</p>
<p>he knew too much once he had served his purpose he was expendable after his death the propaganda</p>
<p>machine could go smoothly into action the elimination of pausanias was an essential stage</p>
<p>in the plot circumstantial evidence he writes does not amount to proof positive but men have been</p>
<p>hanged on weaker cumulative testimony than that assembled here the motive was overwhelming the</p>
<p>opportunity ideal end quote whenever there are these giant earthquake moments in history it just</p>
<p>seems wrong for us to not know more about them because the import would seem to demand that there</p>
<p>be more information about them but then i remember the kennedy assassination which happened two years</p>
<p>before i was born and look at how much you think you know but you don&rsquo;t know about that so imagine</p>
<p>something more than two thousand years ago i&rsquo;ve always loved aby bosworth an alexandrian historian</p>
<p>i like his view that alexander was you know let&rsquo;s not romanticize him too much</p>
<p>but bosworth points out about this period something that we all need to take into account</p>
<p>and it does highlight how difficult a historian&rsquo;s job is trying to piece this stuff together</p>
<p>and the need to use all sorts of things like coinage and archaeology and a bunch of other</p>
<p>other disciplines to supplement the meager bits of information sometimes or the contradictory stuff</p>
<p>and he writes about this period right after philip&rsquo;s death quote the first few days of alexander&rsquo;s reign</p>
<p>must have been among the most critical of his career unfortunately no connected account survives</p>
<p>of them there are scraps of epitome and random flashbacks from later history but most of the</p>
<p>crucial details are irretrievably lost there is infinite scope for speculation and imaginative</p>
<p>reconstruction but the sources themselves allow very little to be said we must be prepared to</p>
<p>admit our ignorance however galling that may be end quote these are the kind of unknowables by the</p>
<p>way that make this a hardcore history addendum show and not a full hardcore history program</p>
<p>because a lot of the data points are missing forget about the stuff between the data points</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know major things like whether or not olympius can accurately be placed at philip&rsquo;s</p>
<p>assassination was she there was she an eyewitness there are historians who say no that she was back</p>
<p>in her homeland at this time and that she didn&rsquo;t come back to macedonia until philip was good and</p>
<p>safely out of the way good and dead maybe for reasons of their own personal security others</p>
<p>though generally following different ancient sources say that she hardly would have missed</p>
<p>a wedding between her daughter and her brother with her son there at an event that was in part</p>
<p>staged to show that everything is just hunky-dory with the royal house you know before the big</p>
<p>persian expedition she&rsquo;s a prop in that propaganda show isn&rsquo;t she she&rsquo;s got to be there but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know another thing you don&rsquo;t know about it and it&rsquo;s key to what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes now</p>
<p>is how many children philip ii actually had richard a gabriel says they only record</p>
<p>the official kids of the official wives in the macedonian tradition but then says philip was a</p>
<p>rampant i believe the word he used was rampant womanizer and he quotes justin i think it was</p>
<p>not the greatest of all sources but who says that philip had sons all over the place</p>
<p>and just because they&rsquo;re not official in the macedonian system that didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>the amount of royal blood mattered whether it was official or not less important especially</p>
<p>if you are a tool of a powerful macedonian clan that wants to push you know for their</p>
<p>chance to have the boss of bosses job and we&rsquo;ll overlook any problems with this contender</p>
<p>heck he&rsquo;s one of philip&rsquo;s kids who cares if he&rsquo;s a bastard</p>
<p>so alexander&rsquo;s first several weeks or month month and a half hard to know what happened</p>
<p>but eventually he emerges as the king he&rsquo;s 20 years old by the way uh some of the powerful</p>
<p>barons that might have pushed back on him so quickly being acclaimed king are just conveniently</p>
<p>out of the way including atlas the guy who said i hope we have a full-blooded true blood macedonian</p>
<p>heir and you know precipitated that drunken fight which led to the need to have the wedding that</p>
<p>philip was just killed at atlas is conveniently back at the bridgehead preparing things for the</p>
<p>big asian expedition and alexander starts his purges these are not abnormal when the kingship</p>
<p>changes hands in macedonian history it&rsquo;s often bloody it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s a godfather</p>
<p>list people to be hit when the godfather died when my father dies carry out your orders</p>
<p>and when philip is killed people start getting killed because of it alexander&rsquo;s official line</p>
<p>once he becomes king by the way is that pausanias did not act alone this was a conspiracy</p>
<p>at his father&rsquo;s funeral at the grave site he executes people a couple of people he&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to you know on his father&rsquo;s side anyway people who potentially could have been put forward i</p>
<p>mean people who might have had a claim to the kingship but alexander says they were involved</p>
<p>in the plot to kill his dad boom they&rsquo;re gone and here&rsquo;s the weird part they might have been</p>
<p>but this becomes very stalin-esque this becomes you know stalin had the kirov excuse kirov&rsquo;s</p>
<p>assassination is the thing that makes all these purges and and killings uh justified um alexander</p>
<p>had his dads and it allows him to cover up uh the traditional macedonian purges where lots of people</p>
<p>are going to get whacked including atlas he&rsquo;ll get it he gets it by like slow messenger they</p>
<p>have their own version of like heat seeking drone missiles or something but they just take forever</p>
<p>to get to their targets like the speed of a horse alexanderson&rsquo;s an assassin uh it&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>probably weeks to get to asia minor and uh we are left wondering how the assassination happened this</p>
<p>often happens in the ancient writings they&rsquo;ll tell you that something happened but they won&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>you how in the case of a mode of death they did use poison they did stuff like that but this sounds</p>
<p>like one of those um traditional sort of uh man-to-man hits back before guns were around</p>
<p>knives were very popular and if you think about the ways the gangsters would do it like the 1920s</p>
<p>uh they grab your hands sometimes in a handshake hold you really tight and then use a pistol on</p>
<p>you from close range they would do the knife equivalent sometimes in the ancient world so</p>
<p>be easy to imagine atlas who was probably in his 60s at this time goes out to greet the</p>
<p>macedonian messenger they probably vaguely know each other maybe some kind of an embrace and then</p>
<p>a knife just in the right place now remember it was atlas&rsquo;s niece cleopatra such a common name</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s confusing who will then change it to eurydice another super common name and confusing</p>
<p>she married philip right that was again the thing that caused the most recent rift in the family</p>
<p>and she has born one maybe two children another one of those things that&rsquo;s galling because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know for sure how many children did cleopatra have in a short time and were they</p>
<p>male or female i&rsquo;m not going to take a position experts differ there was supposed to be a female</p>
<p>her name europa there was in other sources supposed to be a male his name craterus uh you could have</p>
<p>either one or the other or both i don&rsquo;t know neither one of them are going to make it very</p>
<p>long in this world though because they are both under the age of two and they and their mother</p>
<p>are about to get whacked now you may say why are you spending so much time on alexander the greats</p>
<p>purges as he initially comes to power it&rsquo;s a logical question elizabeth carney answers it</p>
<p>when she says because olympius participated in them one of her claims to infamy historically</p>
<p>speaking is that she&rsquo;s the one who eliminates philip&rsquo;s new wife newest wife remember philip&rsquo;s</p>
<p>newest wife is his seventh i should point out she eliminates philip&rsquo;s newest wife</p>
<p>and his one or two children that are either male or female or both</p>
<p>this is one of the events that olympius is most known for and it colors her entire historical</p>
<p>reputation so as you might imagine elizabeth carney writing an entire book on olympius has</p>
<p>the luxury of spending some time on the question and devote several pages to the possibilities</p>
<p>and the first possibility is that it never happened at all and we need to bear this in</p>
<p>mind right we talked about this historical equivalent of fake news or whatever thousands</p>
<p>of years limited sources unreliable sometimes i mean may never have happened</p>
<p>if it did happen what was going on there was it some outbreak of you know like raging hormones</p>
<p>and jealousy and all this sort of stuff from one wife to another the real soap opera stuff</p>
<p>right you stole my husband and i&rsquo;m gonna get you no elizabeth carney points out that these are high</p>
<p>falutin diplomatic marriages um with kings who go out and sleep with anyone they want i mean this is</p>
<p>not a question of of sexuality and all that especially probably not by</p>
<p>her age in the ancient world this is about power and in some cases about personal security and</p>
<p>those two things are related and the way you know this is that had cleopatra you know philip&rsquo;s last</p>
<p>wife gotten to olympius and alexander first the shoe very well could have been on the other foot</p>
<p>elizabeth carney says that this very likely was a do unto others before they did unto you sort of</p>
<p>others before they did unto you sort of thing you hit their family atlas&rsquo;s family before they get you</p>
<p>atlas of course the uncle of cleopatra and he dies too</p>
<p>one of the things that carney points out though is that people die a lot in these</p>
<p>macedonian power transitions as we said and by the standards of the time and place this may have been</p>
<p>a relatively lightweight purge right merciful purge this side of the family cleopatra was always</p>
<p>going to get cut off and any of her offspring were too it is unusual uh it won&rsquo;t be as unusual after</p>
<p>this time period for one woman to be eliminating another woman and a female child likely female</p>
<p>child europa that that&rsquo;s unusual but if these were macedonian males it would have been real</p>
<p>politik and typical macedonian stuff uh because it&rsquo;s a female it&rsquo;s blamed on jealousy and whatnot</p>
<p>but elizabeth carney says and she seems to come down if i&rsquo;m reading her right on the on the idea</p>
<p>that it did happen but it happened for the same kind of calculating she says olympius was always</p>
<p>a very calculating person that it comes down to the same sort of calculation that philip himself</p>
<p>her husband now in the ground would have made she&rsquo;s a hardcore realist and she got cleopatra</p>
<p>and the atlas side of the family before they got her and her son</p>
<p>and how it actually happened is once again the debatable stuff i mean did she carry out</p>
<p>the killings herself did she order them how was it done a much later unreliable source famously</p>
<p>says that she had uh the the other wife of philip and the infant or infants dragged over a a heap of</p>
<p>burning coals like a giant barbecue which again colors her historical reputation whether or not</p>
<p>she did that the killing of the infant too is very hard for everyone and elizabeth carney goes into</p>
<p>that quite a bit and how that would have been perceived during the time period and all this</p>
<p>kind of stuff carney writes that other than the novelty of the woman-on-woman violence</p>
<p>it might not have rattled people that much and she writes quote</p>
<p>several factors indicate that contemporaries were not particularly surprised or bothered by</p>
<p>olympius&rsquo;s actions the mere absent of the incident for most accounts is suggestive</p>
<p>it was not an attention grabber unlike other acts of violence committed by alexander or olympius</p>
<p>the sources do not mention them again at least in terms of olympius dynastic murders were a dime a</p>
<p>dozen before and after these particular deaths and some of those murdered were children philip&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother had been accused albeit almost certainly unjustly of dynastic murders one suspects she</p>
<p>writes that many thought that atlas and cleopatra could hardly have expected anything else once</p>
<p>philip was dead they had committed themselves to what proved to be the losing side in a dynastic</p>
<p>struggle and past reigns demonstrated what happened to those who made such a poor choice</p>
<p>end quote she goes on to theorize that it&rsquo;s possible that the death was by hanging</p>
<p>uh reasons for which we will describe later but like a self-hanging like a suicide where</p>
<p>you know they put up a rope or they hand uh the former bride of philip a rope and sort of suggest</p>
<p>the same way ernst rome in the night of the long knives in nazi germany was supposed to have been</p>
<p>given such a choice you know here you go do what you know you have to do kind of thing and no real</p>
<p>word on what happened to the infant another one of the unreliable ancient sources says that um</p>
<p>olympius killed the infants in front of and there were two in that story i think killed the infants</p>
<p>in front of the mother and then she either died when she saw that out of grief or whatever or</p>
<p>killed herself after that you can see why olympius gets such a fearsome rep historically speaking</p>
<p>the next year and a half or so of what&rsquo;s going on in their lives is going to be alexander</p>
<p>putting together humpty dumpty again his father&rsquo;s creation which was held together in a rickety sort</p>
<p>of sense with a bunch of people who didn&rsquo;t want to be involved in this asian expedition under</p>
<p>macedonian leadership but what were they going to do right a combination of philip&rsquo;s energy his</p>
<p>genius and later in life his gravitas and let&rsquo;s be honest backed by the best army around kept</p>
<p>everybody in line and when he died all those people who would have liked to have seen him</p>
<p>dead whether or not they paid the bill for the murder incorporation tab you know um took the</p>
<p>opportunity to throw off the macedonian yoke in the next year and a half or so is alexander trying</p>
<p>to put the yoke back in humpty now i&rsquo;m a fan of alexander and many of these details i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>leave out here will be in that eventual show whenever the hell i do it uh but let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>ignore the fact that alexander doesn&rsquo;t just inherit the great army of its day which you know</p>
<p>anybody could probably do pretty well with uh he also inherits the leadership of that army</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d said earlier that he was like genghis khan or napoleon that he had the great set of marshals</p>
<p>and generals around him they really fall into two major groups let&rsquo;s call them because other people</p>
<p>have the old guard and the new guard the old guard are dad&rsquo;s generals atlas was one of those guys</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of them and they&rsquo;re all famous and they&rsquo;re good and they are hard-bitten and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>old by this time remember this is not young by today&rsquo;s age standards this is a world where these</p>
<p>ages are quite a bit older than they are today uh these guys are in their 50s and 60s think of</p>
<p>how much fighting they&rsquo;ve already done and think about how they they came from a time before all</p>
<p>this glitz when macedonia was ruling this whole part of the world alexander was born into that</p>
<p>world right i wonder how they felt about the 20 year old wunderkind right especially before he</p>
<p>was proven as anything like a wunderkind not just that these guys are not like the modern generals</p>
<p>in the military his job it is to salute and like robots do what they&rsquo;re told by their superior</p>
<p>you know we we said these are like bosses of other crime families now they may listen to the</p>
<p>boss of bosses right now but if the situation were to turn against their interest that could change</p>
<p>these are barons that&rsquo;s a better way to look at them guys like atlas are barons and the king has</p>
<p>their allegiance for now alexander has the help of one of these really formidable guys who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably in his 60s by this time a guy named antipater antipater is supposed to have sided</p>
<p>with alexander during the transition of power when things might have been kind of hairy and then</p>
<p>all of a sudden he has one of these great barons backing him and the other great barons are away</p>
<p>and you know this antipater is kind of friends of the family he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s loyal to philip and he shows</p>
<p>that loyalty by helping philip&rsquo;s son and olympius they were supposed to be on good terms initially</p>
<p>the reason for bringing antipater&rsquo;s name into all this though is that they&rsquo;re not going to be on</p>
<p>good terms for long this is going to turn out to be probably the most negative personal</p>
<p>relationship in olympius&rsquo;s life in terms of consequences the reason things go south between</p>
<p>she and antipater are often tied to alexander leaving along with a giant chunk of the army most</p>
<p>of the mercenaries and a lot of greek allies when he launches his dad&rsquo;s mission his dad&rsquo;s plan</p>
<p>for an invasion of asia himself with his dad&rsquo;s army</p>
<p>throws a spear when he&rsquo;s disembarking from the boat onto the asian side into the sand</p>
<p>calls the entire area spear one territory and we&rsquo;re off to be dealt with later in the inevitable</p>
<p>alexander show this will continue by the way for 10 to 11 years as alexander continues until</p>
<p>his army makes him stop an army who adored him and saw him as almost a god king and finally he</p>
<p>said we can&rsquo;t go any farther we have snakes and elephants and monsoons and we don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>what home looks like and our armor&rsquo;s falling off us can we stop now and alexander basically</p>
<p>called him a bunch of ingrates what do you want meanwhile antipater and his mother are both in</p>
<p>macedonia antipater is the guy who alexander picked to run the show when i&rsquo;m gone somebody</p>
<p>has to hold down the fort antipater gets the job friend of the family if you got to pick one of</p>
<p>these unreliable macedonian barons this guy looks like the most reliable right this this family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been the most reliable to me the boss of bosses i&rsquo;ll put you in charge antipater uh he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have it seems like an official position for his mother but do you think olympius is just</p>
<p>gonna sit there and say nothing a lot of wives probably would but this is why she makes the</p>
<p>history books because she she doesn&rsquo;t say nothing she says a lot of stuff and antipater&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>deal with alexander&rsquo;s mom probably not used to dealing with women like this at all who get up in</p>
<p>your grill and question some of the things you do the funny part about it is you can&rsquo;t really believe</p>
<p>any of the letters that the alexander romance and some of these sources have that supposedly</p>
<p>show correspondence but you can see that there was correspondence to alexander from both of those</p>
<p>people complaining about each other so his mom would write letters to alexander when he&rsquo;s off</p>
<p>in asia saying you know antipater is uh exceeding his authority he&rsquo;s acting like a king he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>danger of you know becoming a monarch himself and all he&rsquo;s complaining complaining complaining</p>
<p>and antipater is writing to alexander complaining about his mom and the interference and she&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know she&rsquo;s uh exceeding her authority and getting involved in things she shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speaking of getting involved in things she probably shouldn&rsquo;t one of the stories about</p>
<p>mother and son olympius and alexander that always makes the rounds as evidence someone</p>
<p>points out of the mama&rsquo;s boy oedipal complex version or view of alexander has to do with</p>
<p>worries over alexander&rsquo;s sexuality as he gets older now the reason this comes into play at</p>
<p>this point in the story is because before this great invasion of asia this king who&rsquo;s been a king</p>
<p>you know year and a half something like that almost two years um he has no wife and he has no</p>
<p>heir and his generals are telling him listen it would be really smart you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>at the tip of the spear here fighting lots of battles in this big country uh you should have</p>
<p>an heir and alexander shows no real enthusiasm for this and the story um is famous of alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother hiring him a thessalian courtesan that thessaly&rsquo;s in northern greece and a courtesan</p>
<p>of course is a prostitute although in this day and age these might have been people of some status</p>
<p>and wealth and standing too especially if you&rsquo;re getting one for a prince peter green writes quote</p>
<p>both he meaning philip alexander&rsquo;s dad both he and olympius according to theophrastes were worried</p>
<p>by among other things the boy&rsquo;s lack of heterosexual interests they feared he might be</p>
<p>turning out a girlish invert and even went so far as to procure a beautiful thessalian courtesan</p>
<p>named calyxenia i believe it is to help develop his manly nature olympius herself we are told</p>
<p>frequently begged him to have intercourse with this woman which does not suggest any great</p>
<p>enthusiasm on his part but then what son would take kindly to a maternally selected mistress</p>
<p>end quote good point there a little weird at least nowadays nevertheless without</p>
<p>heir or wife in 334 bce alexander takes off on his adventure in asia never to return home again</p>
<p>leaving his mother in antipater back at home and this is where the data points get sparse right</p>
<p>they sort of go away with alexander she&rsquo;s doing a couple of things it&rsquo;s thought back at home</p>
<p>the first thing is she is obviously the equivalent of the king&rsquo;s eye in persia that&rsquo;s the famous</p>
<p>position where the persian king would have an official who stayed in the governor&rsquo;s palaces</p>
<p>and watched the governors for the king watched to make sure that they do what the king wanted</p>
<p>watched to make sure you know go to the marketplace listen to the scuttlebutt listen to</p>
<p>any rumors being fine and constantly report back to the king she was certainly doing this for alexander</p>
<p>as we said earlier she&rsquo;s the person the one person probably in this world whose interests</p>
<p>completely line up with alexander&rsquo;s and the one person he can almost totally trust her her power</p>
<p>rests on him right his his life and success is what makes her power manifest and so she has the</p>
<p>same interest he does let&rsquo;s protect alexander and his interest so she&rsquo;s watching antipater</p>
<p>for alexander no doubt about that but she&rsquo;s also doing things in uh elizabeth carney it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>book by the way it&rsquo;s not a child&rsquo;s book but if you like uh olympius it&rsquo;s the only one i found</p>
<p>just on olympius uh pick that up but she points out that women in the ancient world did things</p>
<p>that are sometimes under the radar but that are these really important parts of the story</p>
<p>like diplomacy it&rsquo;s such a personal relationship thing in this time period although i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>diplomats who will say it&rsquo;s still about personal relationships even today</p>
<p>go look if you just want to see how recently it was how it could even manifest look at the</p>
<p>correspondence between the the various royal families of europe before the first world war</p>
<p>broke out and how much they were writing these intimate letters to their cousins and whatnot</p>
<p>but bringing up major things like treaties and agreements and diplomacy and everything else right</p>
<p>unofficial diplomatic stuff from the back channels if you will well in most periods in human history</p>
<p>most places had it on a like a personal level right who&rsquo;s in your rolodex i know that guy i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go talk to him whatever it might be right a lot of these people would send their children</p>
<p>to foreign courts and then they would come back home later and then if you needed to do diplomacy</p>
<p>with those courts you&rsquo;d send the child that grew up there right uh if alexander or philip had a</p>
<p>problem with anyone in a pirate you send olympias right she&rsquo;s from there she knows everybody i grew</p>
<p>up with all those people i&rsquo;ll go talk to them that&rsquo;s personal diplomacy it sounds like she was</p>
<p>doing a lot of that and that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that maybe antipater would be like she&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>exceeding her authority they also found her signature or her daughter&rsquo;s signature on some</p>
<p>official shipments of food and stuff so it&rsquo;s theorized that maybe during a time of food</p>
<p>shortage she either signed the invoice or maybe even out of her own funds paid for food to be</p>
<p>brought in that&rsquo;s another thing that might look like it undercut antipater&rsquo;s you know competence</p>
<p>or whatever i&rsquo;ll complain about that to alexander in my next letter but even as alexander continues</p>
<p>and goes from victory to victory in the east there&rsquo;s almost like something from his mother</p>
<p>that follows him and once again who the heck i cannot i can&rsquo;t stress that enough this is part</p>
<p>of a story a story that may be based i&rsquo;d love to be able to compare the original to what it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>and how much of this stuff is true when when multiple sources talk about it you start to put</p>
<p>a little bit more maybe there&rsquo;s something to this um something goes wrong with alexander over the</p>
<p>the slightly more than a decade that he has left in this life while he&rsquo;s becoming the great</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s going on in his head and there&rsquo;s been debate ever since about what this is</p>
<p>the easiest thing to probably point to is he looks like some of the other great conquerors</p>
<p>in history who would engage and embark on a lucky lucky is the wrong word but but a string of</p>
<p>unbroken successes improbable amounts of success to where they start to think of themselves as</p>
<p>something more than human a man of destiny uh somebody smiled on by the gods or whatever right</p>
<p>the story about alexander always contains this question of whether or not philip was his real</p>
<p>father and if philip wasn&rsquo;t his real father the implication was that it was zeus we told you about</p>
<p>the lightning striking the womb thing all that&rsquo;s part of later writings but it&rsquo;s all part of this</p>
<p>idea that alexander began to wonder and and there was a wonderful historian i read who tried to</p>
<p>point out that this isn&rsquo;t that unusual in the greek macedonian way of seeing things because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s after all what the achilles is and and the heracles are these are people whose deeds</p>
<p>prove to be so superhuman that you can then sort of go well obviously they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re part god</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s how you know that you&rsquo;re a demigod or something and if you&rsquo;re in alexander</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing these amazing things well gosh we&rsquo;ve seen it in more modern times where</p>
<p>it seems to be a known hazard of the great conqueror business that you might become megalomaniacal</p>
<p>and you might start to think there&rsquo;s something divine going on here and olympius&rsquo;s impact on</p>
<p>this story is that you know it&rsquo;s unlikely that hitler&rsquo;s mom was whispering in his ear that there</p>
<p>was something super special about him napoleon&rsquo;s mom either the tradition holds that that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>case with alexander his mother was whispering in his ear at the very least remember that you are a</p>
<p>descendant of achilles but it might be a little bit bigger even than that one of the things another</p>
<p>historian that i read pointed out i hadn&rsquo;t even thought about this but it&rsquo;s right uh that in a</p>
<p>patrilineal society like macedonia where everybody always calls attention to their their father&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family line alexander constantly called attention to his mothers and constantly sort of associated</p>
<p>himself with achilles rather than his dad&rsquo;s line and heracles zeus however which is sort of you</p>
<p>know it all devolves to zeus in the end zeus however began to fascinate him as his conquest</p>
<p>went on and in the alexander story famously he&rsquo;s going to go to all these oracles when he conquers</p>
<p>egypt uh he finds the famous oracle there and he&rsquo;s going into these oracles and the stories are</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s asking these oracles you know it&rsquo;s philip my dad and the implication is if philip isn&rsquo;t his</p>
<p>dad zeus is now all by itself i&rsquo;m not even sure that thinking that you are the son of a god or</p>
<p>something is all that terrible depends on how it works out right maybe you&rsquo;re a a wonderful person</p>
<p>who thinks they&rsquo;re the son of a god but in alexander&rsquo;s case it&rsquo;s wrapped up with all the</p>
<p>other traditional stuff that&rsquo;s going on the megalomania the mental instability uh historians</p>
<p>and writers ever since have been trying to put a label on it and figure it out there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>unknown space in which to theorize you get pretty wide variation of ideas i have a whole book</p>
<p>devoted to the idea that if you plug in rampant alcoholism for x the unknown quantity in the</p>
<p>story boom everything else makes sense well that&rsquo;s just an argument but there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>about it that if you could bring olympias from her home or the or the or the ruling area of</p>
<p>macedonia in a giant concord jet land her in babylon where alexander is 10 years after she</p>
<p>last saw him if she could have a conversation with her son i wonder if she would recognize him</p>
<p>the alcohol situation is a factor there&rsquo;s no doubt about it i mean his best friend and</p>
<p>probable lover hefestian will die from drinking and not only does he almost die from drinking</p>
<p>initially he&rsquo;s told to lay off the drinking for like a few days and he can&rsquo;t even do that and when</p>
<p>he drinks some more he dies alexander&rsquo;s response to this was to drink more i mean these are people</p>
<p>who are dying sometimes i mean imagine having chug-a-lug contests where sometimes one of the</p>
<p>participants dies i just imagine the other participant turning around lowering his giant</p>
<p>cauldron of wine and going i win it&rsquo;s pretty hardcore right uh the only thing i could say uh</p>
<p>that sort of mollifies it a little bit is that the persians that alexander took over</p>
<p>their ruler kind of is a big drinker and is supposed to be a big drinker like that too a heroic</p>
<p>drinker you want to be the king of the persians you better be able to drink sir just saying</p>
<p>even now i think okay rampant alcoholic who thinks he&rsquo;s the son of a god</p>
<p>you could still work with that couldn&rsquo;t you it&rsquo;s when you get to another of the known</p>
<p>um pitfalls of this uh great conqueror sort of lifestyle that it all falls apart for him maybe</p>
<p>the uh the paranoia and the suspicion and he begins to start killing the people around him</p>
<p>he begins to to think everyone&rsquo;s a threat and maybe those letters from his mom years ago</p>
<p>that were saying antipater&rsquo;s trying to take over antipater&rsquo;s doing too much antipater this and</p>
<p>maybe he could rebuke her back then just say lay off i know i know he&rsquo;s trying to conquer the world</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get back to you maybe now when you become more suspicious and as the mental instability</p>
<p>takes hold uh and all these other problems he&rsquo;s got some war wounds that are maybe taking a toll</p>
<p>on him sort of too he&rsquo;s not the man he was probably um maybe you start listening to your</p>
<p>mom&rsquo;s letters a little bit more you you already were thinking everyone around you&rsquo;s plotting and</p>
<p>now she&rsquo;s saying this stuff about antipater and she&rsquo;s been saying it for like 10 years certainly</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s smoke there&rsquo;s fire in 323 alexander decides to sack antipater</p>
<p>sends him a note from babylon saying uh bring me some more replacement troops and come on over here</p>
<p>i want to see you with everybody getting whacked around alexander all of a sudden antipater who</p>
<p>is in his 60s 70s maybe even now uh he thinks this is a trap traditionally he&rsquo;s and anybody</p>
<p>would think mafia crime family again alexander wants you to come on over to this uh clam house</p>
<p>and have a little something to eat just want to talk to you um so antipater doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t drop his command and leave macedonia and go to see alexander he doesn&rsquo;t respond to</p>
<p>the summons so eventually he does send his son cassander though cassander&rsquo;s about alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>age by the way and he&rsquo;s important to the story very important um elizabeth carney pointed out</p>
<p>something that you kind of remember knowing but it didn&rsquo;t sink in until she said it was how many</p>
<p>of these people had known each other their whole lives what&rsquo;s more in the macedonian court many of</p>
<p>these people&rsquo;s parents knew each other as toddlers and in a lot of cases even their grandparents</p>
<p>played together on the schoolyard alexander and cassander were two of the people in that very tiny</p>
<p>class taught by aristotle and when you look at that class when the students in that class are</p>
<p>named they all become like alexander&rsquo;s generals and his advisors and his bodyguards</p>
<p>earlier we had mentioned the old guard of the generals phillips you know people his dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>generals he has his own contemporaries who become generals and become great leaders of armies after</p>
<p>his time too and these are all guys that went to school with him cassander&rsquo;s one of those guys</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really like each other that much apparently and cassander shows up in alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>court ostensibly i guess to beg for his dad&rsquo;s job but in this case that&rsquo;s almost the same thing as</p>
<p>begging for his life and in a famous story once again take it or leave it cassander walks in and</p>
<p>sees something that the macedonians around alexander have become accustomed to but cassander</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t seen it yet he sees the persians bowing on the ground to alexander it&rsquo;s how they treat their</p>
<p>kings you know you see the same thing in egypt that&rsquo;s how they treated the pharaohs right get</p>
<p>right down on the ground like a god but the macedonians didn&rsquo;t do that stuff right they thought</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t democracy what they had in macedonia but it was this sort of egalitarian where we acclaim</p>
<p>the leader it was a much more down-to-earth sort of leadership by comparison and cassander is</p>
<p>supposed to have seen the persians doing this in front of alexander to alexander and laughing at</p>
<p>it or making fun of it and in the story alexander and this is a sign probably of the megalomania</p>
<p>although maybe he would have done this back in the old days alexander grabs him by the hair and</p>
<p>starts smashing his head against the wall scaring cassander so badly that we&rsquo;re told i think it was</p>
<p>plutarch who said that you know decades later long after alexander&rsquo;s dead and gone uh cassander</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t even pass a statue of the man without going weak in the knees and i think plutarch</p>
<p>said taking quite a while to recover cassander was hardly the only person though scared at this time</p>
<p>alexander had everybody on edge it&rsquo;s like the third reich at the end or i mean all these rulers</p>
<p>get a little unstable at the end and they see plots everywhere um there are a lot of people who</p>
<p>may at this time have thought that it was worth taking a chance on trying to get rid of alexander</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t get rid of him he was likely to get rid of you and cassander is one of the</p>
<p>people implicated as a potential participant in alexander&rsquo;s death by the way not only is</p>
<p>antipater&rsquo;s oldest son cassander here cassander&rsquo;s brother another son of antipater is alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cup bearer the one who you know just to make sure that this cup does not get out of my hands and</p>
<p>nobody spikes it with anything that guy is antipater&rsquo;s other son now the only time you care</p>
<p>about the ancestry of a king&rsquo;s cup bearer it&rsquo;s a little like an offensive lineman in football you</p>
<p>only care about their name apparently when something goes wrong well the only time the</p>
<p>poor cup bearer gets mentioned is when something goes wrong or depending on you know what the cup</p>
<p>bears involved with and who they&rsquo;re involved with when something goes right on june 10th june 11th</p>
<p>323 bce a 32 year old alexander the great dies and no one to this day can say definitively why</p>
<p>theories abound in all directions from the natural to the unnatural</p>
<p>from the common sense and obvious to the wild guy had a lot of reasons he might have died though and</p>
<p>disease is an obvious one of medical professionals have been looking and examining the the evidence</p>
<p>from hundreds of years later that writers have kept about this kind of stuff and they will</p>
<p>proclaim definitively it was just disease or that disease and i&rsquo;ve heard everything</p>
<p>typhus cholera malaria west nile virus all of it then there&rsquo;s the uh sort of common sense ones i</p>
<p>mean you can look at it and go this is a guy with some major war wounds that probably began to take</p>
<p>its toll uh the the drinking is uh long term and uh chronic and and still at very high levels i mean</p>
<p>that will take a toll mixing it all together it could be an accumulation of things weaken his</p>
<p>immune system and the west nile virus gets him revenge of the persian empire through the mosquito</p>
<p>but there has always been a tradition modern and ancient included by most of the sources</p>
<p>that alexander was assassinated poisoned that cassander brought the poison that the cup bearer</p>
<p>son of antipater fed it to alexander that the poison might have been mixed by aristotle himself</p>
<p>appalled by alexander&rsquo;s descent into tyrannical madness and that maybe cassander&rsquo;s job wasn&rsquo;t to</p>
<p>go there and plead for his dad&rsquo;s job and life but to assess alexander&rsquo;s sanity and willingness to</p>
<p>be reasonable because remember antipater and those people are all back in greece they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>letters and hearing stories but maybe you send your son and say get a look for yourself and if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not reasonable take him out olympius certainly thinks antipater and company did it and</p>
<p>she will eventually proclaim this publicly and you have to be careful because the propaganda from this</p>
<p>period following alexander&rsquo;s death is heavy duty and it comes from all sides so saying he killed</p>
<p>alexander would be a huge propaganda tool but you can tell by the way it helps take something you</p>
<p>know there was always a lot of gasoline soaked wood in the olympius antipater relationship</p>
<p>this is when it turns into a vendetta a real clan blood feud between uh the official name for them</p>
<p>are the um antipatrids which are the family of antipater but think about it like a you know</p>
<p>the gambinos the bananos the antipatrids and olympius&rsquo;s clan which includes two distinct</p>
<p>ones really her clan back home remember she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s maybe become the regent of her homeland</p>
<p>during this time period because her poor brother who married cleopatra alexander&rsquo;s sister gets</p>
<p>himself killed in a war in italy and apparently the kids are too young so cleopatra or olympius</p>
<p>or both are maybe running the show back in the old epirus melosian homeland and now with pretty</p>
<p>much no male family members around to succeed she&rsquo;s kind of the front and center face of the</p>
<p>royal family back in macedonia or what was the royal family and this is where you just get the</p>
<p>feeling that uh all the people around alexander are feeling really bad that he didn&rsquo;t take that</p>
<p>good advice marry uh one woman or what the heck you know take a page out of his dad&rsquo;s playbook and</p>
<p>marry two make sure one of them&rsquo;s a full-blooded macedonian uh get a few kids going before you</p>
<p>leave for your expedition in asia by the time you die here in 323 bce at 32 it&rsquo;s 32 right um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a couple of kids back in macedonia if you get lucky</p>
<p>an heir maybe 12 years old maybe 13 years old by this time i didn&rsquo;t do the math</p>
<p>now we all know how the macedonian history goes the likelihood of a child you know having the</p>
<p>throne kept long enough for them to succeed it uh is a long shot in macedonia but the older you are</p>
<p>the better the chance you&rsquo;ll make it and let&rsquo;s be honest any kid of alexander is going to have</p>
<p>an a bloodline that&rsquo;s incomparable right so maybe that that&rsquo;s a get out of jail free card from</p>
<p>typical macedonian history you&rsquo;re the son of alexander you&rsquo;re the grandson of philip ii and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest you know who will be there guarding you until she dies of old age or</p>
<p>something else olympius because the interest with alexander&rsquo;s heir will line up with his mother the</p>
<p>same way that alexander&rsquo;s interested and this will be the role she&rsquo;ll play for the rest of her life</p>
<p>the guardian of the air but if alexander didn&rsquo;t have any heirs back in macedonia before he left</p>
<p>for asia what am i talking about well there&rsquo;s not much uh there is a a non-official wife so</p>
<p>a mistress she&rsquo;s often called and the child&rsquo;s often called the illegitimate son of alexander</p>
<p>his name is heracles he&rsquo;s three or four years old by this time and he&rsquo;s off somewhere in like</p>
<p>bactria which is in modern afghanistan or a real real real upper part of persia he&rsquo;s a long way</p>
<p>away and his mother&rsquo;s a barbarian for goodness sake or at least the macedonians would think so</p>
<p>or at least half barbarian in any way this kid does not get anywhere near the attention you</p>
<p>would think he would get until power brokers feel like they can use him and then he all of</p>
<p>a sudden i guess in some sources appears on the scene i&rsquo;ve read some historians who question</p>
<p>whether he really existed at all uh but there is something real that everyone can point to</p>
<p>alexander&rsquo;s got an official wife in persia and she&rsquo;s pregnant when alexander dies</p>
<p>she apparently quickly kills alexander&rsquo;s other wives keeping the bloodline pure the macedonians</p>
<p>and persians both are into that sometimes but if you&rsquo;re worried about a 13 or 14 or 12 year</p>
<p>old heir back in macedonia the one he didn&rsquo;t have surviving long enough to get to the throne</p>
<p>what chance does a kid who isn&rsquo;t even born yet have what&rsquo;s more it could be a female</p>
<p>might not make it to term this is the ancient world after all</p>
<p>the bottom line though is that there&rsquo;s no logical easy answer to what do we do now</p>
<p>once alexander dies and if you think about it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really kind of a crazy moment</p>
<p>in history these are always my favorite things and naturally there&rsquo;s never enough information</p>
<p>did it really go down the way most of the sources kind of say it went down which is</p>
<p>that when alexander dies there is no plan as we said he&rsquo;s supposed to the story says that when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s asked on his deathbed to whom he leaves the empire you know if you&rsquo;re basically an emperor</p>
<p>alexander who&rsquo;s the next emperor and he says to the strongest very macho macedonian homeric answer</p>
<p>maybe something you could justify in a darwinian may the best man win kind of competition for the</p>
<p>throne but disastrous for his people when you&rsquo;re talking about this as a successor to the entire</p>
<p>policy right why don&rsquo;t you fight it out and we&rsquo;ll see that&rsquo;s going to lead to more deaths for</p>
<p>macedonian soldiers than philip and alexander&rsquo;s wars put together the macedonian infantry didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>suffer as terribly as you might think because they were so victorious and so dominant</p>
<p>i had a professor once that said if you want to know the way to defeat the best army in any age</p>
<p>in history split it up and make it fight itself you saw that in roman history by the way the</p>
<p>nastiest most dangerous opponents the legionaries ever faced or other legionaries in civil wars</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next this is crazy to even say over the next 44 or 45</p>
<p>years that&rsquo;s how long it will take for the to the strongest thing to be settled</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re known as the wars of the alexandrian successors or the wars of the successors of the</p>
<p>wars of the diatokai that&rsquo;s the greek word for successors the rest of olympius&rsquo;s life by the way</p>
<p>will be spent as a player in this geopolitical struggle that will happen in phases it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like 44 45 years of continual war there&rsquo;ll be multiple phases that happen and there are so</p>
<p>many players it is to me anyway easily the most complicated struggle in the ancient world it is</p>
<p>very tough to keep track of as they say in sports the players without a scorecard a dizzying array</p>
<p>of personalities a very weird um crabs in a bucket type dynamic where the most august scary</p>
<p>and impressive people are eliminated early because everyone who&rsquo;s less competent and</p>
<p>less impressive bands together to take them down olympius will be one of those people by the way</p>
<p>she is a very scary player in the early phases of this so she&rsquo;s gotten rid of as quickly as</p>
<p>anybody can do it but she&rsquo;s very hard to deal with because she represents ghosts impressive ghosts</p>
<p>the power of olympius which stemmed from her relationship to philip for a while and then</p>
<p>from her relationship to alexander after that will now stem from the power that those</p>
<p>former figures still possess it will it will flow through her i mean i think about her like</p>
<p>this priestess but now the authority and gravitas and reputation of philip and alexander combined</p>
<p>are emanating through her and it affects the infantry of alexander&rsquo;s army let me explain</p>
<p>when alexander dies the story is that uh you know everybody kind of looks at each other this</p>
<p>is a cult of personality empire right it&rsquo;s really concentrated into one person he makes all the</p>
<p>decisions he&rsquo;s i mean every he&rsquo;s the heart the soul and the brain of this place and when he</p>
<p>goes away a bunch of the macedonian nobility go into a room and start debating what you know</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do now the best way to think about this maybe is that this is as close as</p>
<p>you can come they&rsquo;re in babylon where alexander dies by the way this is as close as you can come</p>
<p>to the old macedonian smoke-filled room where the aristocrats and the heads of the families decide</p>
<p>who it&rsquo;s going to be have to be in our jed for the last long period of time but you know we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>figure this out as elizabeth carney points out though they&rsquo;ve had two kings and haven&rsquo;t had to</p>
<p>do this for a long time and the last time they did something like this macedonia was a not important</p>
<p>at all kingdom north of greece a bunch of barbarians according to the greeks and the</p>
<p>greeks could actually from the southern states could actually interfere in in who got to be the</p>
<p>macedonian king and now she points out they&rsquo;re having one of these meetings</p>
<p>to determine half the known world&rsquo;s fate it&rsquo;s a little bit different isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s more they&rsquo;re operating in a really weird uh one historian called it a a potentially</p>
<p>terrifying period of time here after alexander&rsquo;s death there&rsquo;s a problem sometimes when you read</p>
<p>history and the black words on the white page fail to convey uh the parts of history sometimes</p>
<p>that are the most human right the reason it can&rsquo;t be a science the emotional stuff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two kinds of emotional stuff there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re having an emotional moment yourself</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very different than society is having an emotional moment all at the same time and i</p>
<p>try to think of emotional analogies which is both a a very cool and stupid concept at the</p>
<p>same time because you know there&rsquo;s really no analogies when you think about what might happen</p>
<p>but you try to say okay if people in this time period are operating in a stunned sort of state</p>
<p>of mind i try to think of like after 9 11 when you walked around and everybody had this there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>good english word for it i always use like 20 adjectives to try to explain it where i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>one really good long german word would hit it right on the head like they always do</p>
<p>stunned uh surprised uh disbelief a real sense of disbelief then there&rsquo;s like a brain fog if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything like the 9 11 thing uh there&rsquo;s a real sense of trepidation about what happens now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not hysteria it&rsquo;s not mania but it&rsquo;s not stable it&rsquo;s a time where you could see the</p>
<p>emotional state of mind of everybody is on edge and as every major historian points out from the</p>
<p>sources we have which are not great you get this feeling like civil war could happen at any moment</p>
<p>like you have gasoline soaked wood here and it wouldn&rsquo;t take much and the reason why is because</p>
<p>the elites in the macedonian army the cavalry are the ones in the back smoky filled room thinking</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to figure this out the infantry of the macedonian army are the salt of the earth</p>
<p>types they&rsquo;re not going to be so much salt of the earth types later when they get rich and</p>
<p>they turn mercenary but during this time period they&rsquo;re still like the farmer people of macedonia</p>
<p>you know the people who have a real loyalty to the royal house who have a there&rsquo;s a more mythical</p>
<p>sort of feel to it patriotism is the wrong word in the era before nationalism arose but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little like patriotism their their allegiance is to the family of alexander i mean think about it</p>
<p>if you have had two virtual demigod kings in a row from that line i mean why would you want to</p>
<p>change horses in midstream alexander and philip and now you want to do something else and by the</p>
<p>way i didn&rsquo;t mention that something else the agreement eventually worked out with all these</p>
<p>crabs in a bucket in this back room trying to broker some deal is that they&rsquo;re gonna wait to</p>
<p>see about the child that roxanne alexander&rsquo;s wife is pregnant with because if it&rsquo;s a boy</p>
<p>we will hold the kingship for they&rsquo;ll have a regency right and we told you already 18 years</p>
<p>these guys are gonna hold this for this keep the throne warm for 18 years okay well that&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>kind of decision right there isn&rsquo;t it and the infantry who are made up like we said of these</p>
<p>people who are loyal to the royal house and they pretty much have their own idea who the throne</p>
<p>should go to and they present him to the cavalry apparently in one of these making them an offer</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t refuse kind of deals and he&rsquo;s dressed this this person is dressed in alexander&rsquo;s clothes</p>
<p>supposedly one source you know has him in the armor his name just added by this group of infantry</p>
<p>by the way is philip so if you dressed in alexander&rsquo;s clothes your name is philip well</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to tell you something it&rsquo;s philip aridaeus though it&rsquo;s alexander&rsquo;s brother who has</p>
<p>that sort of indeterminable mental condition as one historian said the only reason that this is</p>
<p>the only person you have to turn to is because anybody that alexander was afraid of is gone by</p>
<p>now so he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of this guy why because he&rsquo;s no threat although i read someone else that</p>
<p>said the fact that the infantry knew him and he was in babylon with them he was sort of a mascot</p>
<p>apparently is the way it&rsquo;s portrayed you know the team mascot um but the fact that the infantry knew</p>
<p>him and wanted him for this role may have been an indication that that&rsquo;s not really true in history</p>
<p>so who knows the uh two sides the infantry the salt of the earth type start clashing with the</p>
<p>cavalry violence almost breaks out or does and the cavalry leaves babylon the infantry stays in</p>
<p>babylon and then the cavalry puts babylon under siege you have an explosive moment here and then</p>
<p>the deal is brokered the deal is that there will be no compromises on either side that both sides</p>
<p>get what they want so there&rsquo;s going to be two kings the unborn child of roxanne who does turn</p>
<p>out to be a boy and alexander the great is alexander the third so they&rsquo;ll name this one</p>
<p>alexander the fourth and alexander&rsquo;s half-brother son of philip and a thessalian dancing girl i</p>
<p>believe is going to be the other king and neither one of them can rule without a regent so a regent</p>
<p>is appointed and away we go elizabeth carney tries to get into the head a little bit of olympus</p>
<p>on an emotional level when she finds out her son is dead she has no body she has nothing and</p>
<p>you know most mothers would be very bereaved in this situation her situation&rsquo;s worse because</p>
<p>alexander was her guarantee of safety not just for her but for her immediate loved ones altogether</p>
<p>the reason her enemy antipater couldn&rsquo;t touch her when alexander was alive he&rsquo;s still in macedonia</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s nearby if she&rsquo;s not in macedonia i think she keeps going back and forth between macedonia</p>
<p>and her homeland in melosia but all of a sudden i mean antipater can do whatever he wants to her</p>
<p>except for one thing he&rsquo;s got to be careful because all throughout the rest of her life</p>
<p>her life the salt of the earth macedonian soldiers not so much the cavalry but but the people on the</p>
<p>ground the everyday joes in the ranks they&rsquo;re going to show an immense amount of loyalty to her</p>
<p>and the loyalty of the troops during this time period in this next successor war is key because</p>
<p>at times they will turn on their commanders in this in the upcoming wars there&rsquo;ll be incidents</p>
<p>of them deciding to i mean in one in one famous case the baggage of the infantry in a in a conflict</p>
<p>is captured and so to get their baggage back they hand the general over it&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>interesting time period for all of these different generals um who essentially have pieces of the</p>
<p>wehrmacht that they&rsquo;re that they&rsquo;re fighting with against other pieces of the wehrmacht but sometimes</p>
<p>the pieces in the wehrmacht have a mind of their own and olympius is one of those people that will</p>
<p>prove to be a dangerous person to do anything against because your own wehrmacht troops might</p>
<p>turn against you this is an interesting thing for the generals to try to have to deal with it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dynamic in this crisis and interestingly enough it&rsquo;s not just olympius that commands this sort of</p>
<p>loyalty from the backbone of the macedonian army and probably the farmers and the folks back home</p>
<p>in macedonia it&rsquo;s not just her it&rsquo;s all the close family of philip ii and of course she&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>only close family of philip ii she&rsquo;s also not the only one able to channel power in the here and now</p>
<p>through ghosts philip ii olympius&rsquo;s long dead husband now the great philip ii alexander&rsquo;s dad</p>
<p>you know he had seven wives right he didn&rsquo;t just have olympius and those wives produced</p>
<p>offspring didn&rsquo;t they obviously they didn&rsquo;t have any of the male offspring survive to become</p>
<p>competitors of alexander because well that&rsquo;s what purges are for right alexander would have gotten</p>
<p>those guys but the women are no threat to him so they usually didn&rsquo;t get touched which means</p>
<p>when it comes to what those salt of the earth backbone of the macedonian army and probably the</p>
<p>macedonian folks back home if they have a loyalty to the royal family at this point that mainly</p>
<p>means women which provides a level of power boost that is unusual what&rsquo;s unusual about the next part</p>
<p>of this story it to me it is the best part of this story because it&rsquo;s so rare it&rsquo;s rare to see women</p>
<p>exerting themselves on the on the global geopolitical stage especially before modern times</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re out there there&rsquo;s incidents there&rsquo;s even incidents of multiple women doing it at the</p>
<p>same time but they&rsquo;re rare i&rsquo;ve never and you know i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m ignorant on so many subjects and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it happened in chinese history because everything happened in chinese history once upon</p>
<p>a time um but i&rsquo;ve not encountered another era where you have so many powerful august women</p>
<p>in the story operating on both sides by the way and often at odds with each other in a in a full-on</p>
<p>geopolitical diplomatic power sense as as now and you might be able to make a case that it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>of the way the conditions developed and one of the conditions is all these men that might have</p>
<p>otherwise assumed this role are gone and if philip ii and alexander the great&rsquo;s memory</p>
<p>confers power on the people left over in the family and those people are women well you see</p>
<p>a unique opportunity for these women to figure out a tool to use that power after alexander dies</p>
<p>you have a mass rush of all these various macedonian royal clans marrying into each other</p>
<p>for diplomatic purposes right covering their ass hedging their bets this is a it&rsquo;s a dangerous time</p>
<p>right which of these successors might win what what might happen to us who are we what if you</p>
<p>support the wrong guy for the boss of bosses and then afterwards the other guy they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>remember that right elizabeth carney called this period the brisk post alexander elite macedonian</p>
<p>marriage market which i thought was interesting now the reason it concerns us though is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple of these potential marriage partners from the royal clan who are game changers right</p>
<p>they could end this story of who gets to succeed alexander right now right there doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>be the equivalent of an ancient world war for 44 45 years to settle it we could settle it right now</p>
<p>you know in 322 or something uh year after alexander dies we&rsquo;ll settle it right now</p>
<p>all you got to do is have one of these crabs in a bucket one of these successor warlords has to</p>
<p>just get the edge and it&rsquo;s all over and it&rsquo;s got to be a pretty good edge because the other crabs</p>
<p>in the bucket will pull you down if if you just get a slight bit more power than they have you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to win the game you got to hit the jackpot if this is like a murderous version of the bachelorette</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to get the hand of the bride that can confer legitimacy on you who&rsquo;s out there that</p>
<p>could do that and think about how much power that gives the person who can do that</p>
<p>well there are multiple potential people who could marry into one of these successors clans</p>
<p>and get them closer to the royal house but there&rsquo;s almost a hierarchy right this person will get you</p>
<p>this close to the royal house but this person will get you two steps closer to the royal house</p>
<p>you want to get the jackpot you got to marry alexander the great sister don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s only got one full-blooded sibling cleopatra the one who married her uncle who&rsquo;s gone off and</p>
<p>died in italy now leaving her a widow boom here she is available the bachelorette</p>
<p>and of course olympias and her daughter cleopatra work as a team here sort of so it&rsquo;s the olympias</p>
<p>cleopatra limited partnership here and they desperately need to utilize this power of</p>
<p>having the ability to confer upon you a spouse and then of course subsequent children</p>
<p>whose father was philip ii whose brother was alexander the great whose mother is olympias i</p>
<p>mean come on that is your game changer right there you want to be the crab that crawls out of the</p>
<p>bucket you marry cleopatra and she knows it but this power also makes her dangerous to others</p>
<p>i mean if you happen to be the successor warlord who gets her hand in marriage well fantastic for</p>
<p>you but what does that mean for all your competitors all the warlords who didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>her hand in marriage so over her over her lifetime she&rsquo;s going to either court or be courted by many</p>
<p>of the major players in this story all the big wigs are going to try to get her hand in marriage</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s the obvious prize here but if you can&rsquo;t have her hand in marriage she&rsquo;s the obvious target too</p>
<p>at least you have to block her because she&rsquo;s another one of those people that you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>kill right sometimes you just want to kill these people if you&rsquo;re one of these successors but there</p>
<p>are certain people that have sort of a cloak of invincibility around them and it&rsquo;s the ghosts</p>
<p>protecting them philip ii and alexander you go off and kill them uh your troops might kill you</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s not just speculation because some of the other women in this story have an incident very</p>
<p>similar to that happen to them this is where the other women come into the piece um philip ii had</p>
<p>multiple wives remember we talked about one of these wives as as an example of how tough you</p>
<p>know philip shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with olympus right he has that warrior that illyrian warrior</p>
<p>princess as a wife one of his other ones the wonder woman lady fights with sword shield helmet</p>
<p>remember we talked about her well you know she had children with philip imagine how august a child of</p>
<p>that woman trained in combat maybe even leading troops melded with philip&rsquo;s dna think of how</p>
<p>august those kids would be well here they come into the story and they&rsquo;re female as we said earlier</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of the names and the players in this story without a scorecard this</p>
<p>is the case by the way for any long wars the 30 years war is the same way where there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>time for so much stuff to occur that it&rsquo;s impossible to keep track of it all it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>multi-generational soap opera kind of as we said i was trying to think of the way to simplify this</p>
<p>the best and the best way to say it is that alexander&rsquo;s half-sister the woman who we just</p>
<p>talked about who is the daughter of wonder woman and philip ii her name is kanani it looks like</p>
<p>cyan if you ever see it written also trained in the ways of the warrior illyrian princesses right</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s a killer a hand-to-hand killer apparently too very cultured i mean she&rsquo;s philip ii&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter she&rsquo;s the king&rsquo;s daughter so she&rsquo;ll just kill you in a cultured sort of manner um she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involved in what some historians call a scheme it looks much more like a a grab for power in this</p>
<p>post-alexandrian world and let&rsquo;s remember power this might not be because they&rsquo;re power hungry</p>
<p>power is synonymous with safety here and the best way to get eliminated is to be shut out of power</p>
<p>by your enemies what happens though is that this kanani daughter of wonder woman and philip ii</p>
<p>makes a bold play to seize one of the sources of power and authority in this very unstable</p>
<p>post-alexandrian world and this is all happening in the wake of alexander&rsquo;s death so a year two</p>
<p>three this is the initial you know initial power moves of this whole thing there&rsquo;s two places that</p>
<p>power emanates from officially in this world right now and it&rsquo;s the two kings alexander&rsquo;s infant son</p>
<p>alexander the fourth with the persian or bactrian mom i think he&rsquo;s still in asia at this point but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an infant right he&rsquo;s a prop in the power struggles for now but then you have philip</p>
<p>the mascot king the one with the disability of some sort he&rsquo;s almost certainly being used as a</p>
<p>puppet by the warlords you know who are the regents right we&rsquo;re ruling for the king who&rsquo;s right here</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s indisposed at the moment but what happens if somebody steals the puppet from the warlords</p>
<p>right the the person who&rsquo;s making it possible for you to keep the army loyal and happy and</p>
<p>thinking that he&rsquo;s running the show and really you&rsquo;re running the show through him if you&rsquo;re one</p>
<p>of the warlords how do you how do you prevent somebody from stealing the puppet well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what this scheme is this daughter of philip the second and wonder woman is bringing her daughter</p>
<p>adea uridic is going to be what she&rsquo;s known as eventually bringing her daughter and she&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to try to marry her daughter to one of the kings right she can&rsquo;t have the infant king he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>marriageable anyway but philip merodeus doesn&rsquo;t have a wife now if you&rsquo;re trying to pull this</p>
<p>scheme off though you can&rsquo;t go to the warlords you can&rsquo;t go to the people who have the puppet now</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to steal the puppet from and say hey let me steal the puppet do i have your blessing</p>
<p>you got to bypass them well how do you bypass them you go right to the source of power</p>
<p>the macedonian army and the infantry the salt of the earth types so the warlord general types</p>
<p>the successors they get word that this is underway that this scheme is ongoing and that this woman</p>
<p>kanane is on the way and i&rsquo;ve read sources that say she has a small bodyguard with her others that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got a decent size entourage others that she&rsquo;s got a whole army behind her so i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>which of those is true but she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s protected the general sent out someone to intercept her</p>
<p>before she could get to the infantry because lord knows the infantry will probably say yes to this</p>
<p>deal um and the intercepting force somehow blocks her for a little bit of time and in that little</p>
<p>bit of time she&rsquo;s killed sources differ on what happened here everything from assassinated to uh</p>
<p>violence breaking up between the various bodyguards that leads to her being killed in the fray</p>
<p>to a full-blown um story again from one of the less reputable sources that she&rsquo;s giving a speech</p>
<p>she sounds fully like philip&rsquo;s daughter in this warrior princess like she&rsquo;s getting up in the face</p>
<p>of her assassins and pleading her case and yelling at them and she&rsquo;s in the middle of a speech in one</p>
<p>of these stories to the troops that are there there are macedonian troops they&rsquo;re witnessing</p>
<p>all this and while she&rsquo;s in the middle of the speech she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s stabbed or killed and and cut</p>
<p>down in the middle of the conversation no matter which of those stories is true it apparently</p>
<p>happens in a way that either the macedonian troops see it at the time watch it live or hear about it</p>
<p>soon after and they&rsquo;re outraged you can&rsquo;t kill philip ii&rsquo;s daughter who the hell are you</p>
<p>and and these warlords who are counting on these military forces to stay loyal to them</p>
<p>are about to be thrown to the crocodiles by these same troops because they killed one of philip</p>
<p>ii&rsquo;s daughters in front of them the only way they manage to avoid disaster is to give in to what</p>
<p>that now dead daughter of philip wanted they have to go ahead and let this granddaughter of philip</p>
<p>this adaya yuridike lady marry the mascot king marry the puppet and as i think it was ab bosworth</p>
<p>who coined the phrase and it&rsquo;s not very nice uh the marriage of the amazon to the idiot but it</p>
<p>gives you a sense of what&rsquo;s going on here an easily controllable not very august uh personality</p>
<p>who was being controlled by these powerful marshals is now going to be controlled by this</p>
<p>powerful personality called adaya yuridike and if you took an ancient greek playwright brought</p>
<p>them in the time machine and let them write for one of today&rsquo;s tv daytime soap operas that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>i see this whole whole situation unfolding because it looks like this is revenge from another one of</p>
<p>philip&rsquo;s wives against olympius from the grave through her descendants something wonderfully</p>
<p>greek about that this adaya yuridike is going to be an instant thorn in the side of olympius though</p>
<p>remember she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s the granddaughter of her husband she&rsquo;s going to be an instant thorn in</p>
<p>the side because what if she&rsquo;s able to make you know philip aridaeus the the mascot king what if</p>
<p>she can make him legitimate enough so no one&rsquo;s going to wait around 17 years for olympius&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grandson to come of age in other words could she turn the puppet king into a real king the only</p>
<p>king that she dominates it&rsquo;s wonderful but i said earlier that this period is one of the ones i use</p>
<p>as evidence for why history ruins fiction for me because we already have a wonderful story here</p>
<p>kind of unbelievable wild you know uh and then in typical alexandrian fashion the story gets kicked</p>
<p>up two notches notch number one apparently alexander the great had a day yuridike&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>killed when she was a kid one of his purges you know potential competitor so if she didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the other side of the family to begin with she really doesn&rsquo;t like him now the other thing and</p>
<p>i find this to be the one where i would send this script back to the screenwriter and said sorry you</p>
<p>went too far here nobody&rsquo;s gonna buy that um she&rsquo;s apparently something like 16 years old</p>
<p>her age is tough to determine in dividing the spoils though robin waterfield said 16</p>
<p>wow and 16 really doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in a neutral playing field historically speaking right</p>
<p>because we all know people got married younger what was romeo and juliet and she&rsquo;s like 13 14</p>
<p>something like that but we&rsquo;re not talking about somebody who just gets married and then ends up</p>
<p>in somebody&rsquo;s you know royal family or whatnot we&rsquo;re talking about somebody who almost immediately</p>
<p>asserts her prerogatives and tries to rest as much control as she can grab over the situation here</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not playing with a bunch of little court functionaries she&rsquo;s doing this in a room full of</p>
<p>these generals and marshals that are so great i said that only like napoleon&rsquo;s group of generals</p>
<p>and marshals and genghis khans i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s rarefied air and some of these guys are like</p>
<p>multiple times her age there&rsquo;s a bunch of these dudes in their late 60s all the way up to their</p>
<p>mid-70s still in the field fighting by the way they don&rsquo;t make people like this anymore um we</p>
<p>should point out guys who were fighting with alexander&rsquo;s dad the day alexander was born</p>
<p>and some 16 year old is going to come in there who wasn&rsquo;t even a part of the story five minutes ago</p>
<p>and start telling them how it&rsquo;s going to be this is insane and i wouldn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>when i do my multi-part you know the 45 57 episodes whatever it&rsquo;s going to be on my cable</p>
<p>channel i&rsquo;m going to find some actress from that region because i feel like there&rsquo;s in my head</p>
<p>anyway i have a very specific kind of fire in mind that that that&rsquo;s native to the region i</p>
<p>guess you could say you know greece northern greece albania bulgaria maybe maybe sicily</p>
<p>um and then go find yourself like a 16 year old from there who it sounds like something out of</p>
<p>the hunger games doesn&rsquo;t it too much to be believed because this 16 year old is not going</p>
<p>to stay in the shadows at all now the year she marries philip erodeus though is 321 bce this is</p>
<p>two years after alexander the great dies and it is the year that the whole post-alexander deal on</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re going to run things goes murderously sideways the deal made in the wake of alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death you know under pressure in haste it never seems like that had much of a chance of lasting</p>
<p>especially with all these ambitious powerful people uh involved it would have required a lot</p>
<p>of good behavior on a lot of people&rsquo;s parts to understand the setup because it&rsquo;s kind of important</p>
<p>um essentially what all these people did in deciding how they were going to run alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>empire after he died was to run it like the persians ran theirs and really if you want to</p>
<p>look at it similar to the way the macedonians ran macedonia before they got all big and powerful</p>
<p>all these great successors these generals these marshals these high administrators these bodyguards</p>
<p>of alexander would all be given territories you know think al capone the south side&rsquo;s his territory</p>
<p>ptolemy ptolemy gets egypt and so all these people rule these areas and they rule them kind of like</p>
<p>kings and i keep calling them warlords because they fit the definition of the term at the same</p>
<p>time one historian reminds us that these are at this time period people who are practically kings</p>
<p>themselves fabulously wealthy immensely famous lots of troops uh swear allegiance to them i mean</p>
<p>these are these are kings in their own right you start if you&rsquo;re a king after a while uh wanting</p>
<p>to be treated like a king and not really wanting to bow the knee to any boss of bosses but this</p>
<p>system has one that&rsquo;s the deal it is like a persian system where all of the satraps are kings</p>
<p>in their own territory but there is someone called the king of kings and that was the high commander</p>
<p>well that person&rsquo;s uh title in this system is regent and they they rule with the royal power</p>
<p>in the name of the two kings who are not capable of ruling at the moment this person just happens</p>
<p>to get this job because he was at alexander&rsquo;s bedside as alexander lay dying and alexander</p>
<p>gives the signet ring to this guy his name is perdicus by the way and he&rsquo;s one of the successors</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an impressive figure and as we had mentioned earlier in this dynamic some of the</p>
<p>impressive figures are the ones most of the other people agree we don&rsquo;t want them around</p>
<p>now this signet ring that alexander gives to perdicus is not the equivalent of giving him</p>
<p>the crown it&rsquo;s not saying i leave the empire to you it&rsquo;s more like if we go back to our analogy</p>
<p>of um you know philip and sons asian conquest expedition llc or whatever the family business</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like giving him the keys to the office so he can open up in the morning for everyone else</p>
<p>so perdicus will basically use that though against the other successors and say hey you know he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t give you the office keys did he so perdicus becomes the first regent and then he</p>
<p>starts acting if you&rsquo;re looking at this from the point of view of his successor opponents he starts</p>
<p>acting like a king or wanting to look like a king or starting to want to act like he could be the</p>
<p>next alexander and so you know they had to take him down olympius plays a role in this which is</p>
<p>why some historians have always blamed her for being at the root cause of this entire world war</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get very many women in geopolitical history in the ancient world and then they</p>
<p>finally write about her and they accuse her of starting a multi-generational world war</p>
<p>come on and probably for reasons of jealousy and revenge and you know spite all those typical</p>
<p>female qualities even good historians use words like scheming and meddling and things like that</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going was she really meddling or were there geopolitical concerns going on here that</p>
<p>explain it in a better way than meddling do we accuse alexander of meddling in other kingdoms</p>
<p>affairs being the regent though gives this proticus guy the inside track to being the</p>
<p>next alexander and olympia starts positioning herself back in macedonia to be on his side</p>
<p>because she needs anybody who&rsquo;s going to be someone who can protect her and and protect</p>
<p>her interest from antipater right now that alexander&rsquo;s dead this nice feud she has with</p>
<p>antipater you know you can you can light the torch to that gasoline soaked wood that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been soaking down for more than a decade now who&rsquo;s going to protect you from antipater well she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working on that she actually you know schemes or medals in affairs in greece right after alexander</p>
<p>dies to stir up trouble just to keep antipater busy which is of course just going to make him</p>
<p>a little bit more angry right and then uh perdicus this first guy who gets the regency uh he becomes</p>
<p>the first crab dynamic victim in the bucket one of the crazy things about the war of the</p>
<p>successors and it will be hard to find anything quite like it is that it combines this element of</p>
<p>geopolitical cutthroat machiavellian type world affairs at the highest level you know</p>
<p>in that geopolitical world right that that mediterranean western asia northern africa world</p>
<p>with very close personal relationship dynamics that&rsquo;s why the soap opera thing works so well</p>
<p>americans love to point out and talk about the element of the american civil war that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating about how the generals on both sides knew each other and often served together in wars</p>
<p>and had close relationships uh it is it&rsquo;s a dynamic element that adds a humanness and a</p>
<p>relationship between enemies that you normally don&rsquo;t have when the enemies are foreign right i</p>
<p>know those guys yeah well you get this to a degree you&rsquo;ll never see anywhere else in this in this</p>
<p>upcoming series of wars because all of the leaders of these countries know each other</p>
<p>intimately families were probably close may have been toddlers together uh may have been in the</p>
<p>aristotle school together certainly served together many in the greatest event that they can find</p>
<p>anywhere in their history books till they go back to mythical times with gods right they conquered</p>
<p>the east together as comrades maybe saved each other&rsquo;s lives and now they&rsquo;re ordering hits on</p>
<p>each other what&rsquo;s more these officer corps in all these versions of the wehrmacht the macedonian army</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now spread out from albania to afghanistan from egypt to india um all these upper officer</p>
<p>corps know each other which causes huge issues you&rsquo;ll get people making statements and saying</p>
<p>things like well i&rsquo;m not going to fight against craterus i won&rsquo;t fight against him or troops that</p>
<p>end up liking the general that they&rsquo;re about to fight against that they know personally and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very popular more than the person they&rsquo;re fighting for and switching sides what this really is is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a world war that&rsquo;s going to encompass the entire former empire of alexander but that is really at</p>
<p>its core a macedonian civil war and all these millions of people in these territories most of</p>
<p>whom have already suffered by being conquered by the macedonians are going to get swept up into it</p>
<p>the reason olympia sometimes gets accused of starting the war</p>
<p>is that this perdicus guy the regent the guy who has the inside track to succeeding alexander</p>
<p>is already kind of riding high and scaring everybody he&rsquo;s scaring everybody to the point</p>
<p>where he has to make a marriage arrangement with his you know competitors to try to make them feel</p>
<p>better so he&rsquo;s going to marry antipater&rsquo;s daughter right or olympia&rsquo;s enemy antipater</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good for olympia&rsquo;s by the way he&rsquo;s going to marry antipater&rsquo;s daughter and that</p>
<p>will help you know patch over their differences so he&rsquo;s betrothed to this woman whose name is nasia</p>
<p>and olympia sends cleopatra the bachelorette to go in and block her and offer marriage to her</p>
<p>instead this would completely discombobulate everything in his book dividing the spoils</p>
<p>author robin waterfield describes olympia&rsquo;s scheme or meddling this way quote olympius was still</p>
<p>nervous about antipater once he had finished settling affairs in southern greece he was bound</p>
<p>to punish her for her support of the greek rebellion she came up with a bold ploy knowing</p>
<p>that nasia this is antipater&rsquo;s daughter was betrothed to perdiccas and was even now on her</p>
<p>way to pasidia for the wedding she simultaneously sent cleopatra to sardis which is nearby and wrote</p>
<p>to eumenes suggesting that perdiccas might like to marry her daughter instead she needed perdiccas</p>
<p>to be antipater&rsquo;s enemy not his son-in-law she needed antipater to be distracted by war in asia</p>
<p>and unable to turn his attention to epirus her homeland the plan worked perfectly he writes</p>
<p>he continues quote olympius&rsquo;s overall intention now and in the following years was to see her</p>
<p>grandson alexander the fourth gain the macedonian throne even though the chances of his attaining</p>
<p>his majority must have appeared very bleak offering cleopatra alexander&rsquo;s sister to perdiccas was a</p>
<p>major plank in the scheme she wanted to see perdiccas arrive in macedon married to alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister welcomed by alexander&rsquo;s mother with two kings and alexander&rsquo;s corpse in his train and at</p>
<p>the head of the army with which alexander had conquered the east under such circumstances</p>
<p>antipater would have had no future barring unforeseeable accidents perdiccas would have</p>
<p>been the sole ruler of the empire until alexander the fourth came of age with olympius by his side</p>
<p>end quote apparently perdiccas is tempted by this whole thing but he goes ahead with the</p>
<p>wedding marries antipater&rsquo;s daughter anyway but then starts sending messages to cleopatra</p>
<p>basically insinuating that he&rsquo;s still interested and maybe they could work this deal and that kind</p>
<p>of thing and that becomes known to the other big powerful generals and marshals to them</p>
<p>many histories portray this as like the moment of reveal when perdiccas&rsquo;s true intentions are</p>
<p>are made known to everyone i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s quite that big of the the reveal moment but</p>
<p>essentially it shows hey i&rsquo;m going for it all he&rsquo;s the first to trigger the famous crabs in a</p>
<p>bucket dynamic i&rsquo;ve overused and talked about this whole program he will um have several powerful</p>
<p>marshals band together to take him down he will also fight with ptolemy another one of the</p>
<p>successors whose whose territory is egypt ptolemy is one of my favorite ones he was a bodyguard of</p>
<p>alexander&rsquo;s he was a member of the the small class of boys who uh learned from aristotle</p>
<p>he is the one who gets egypt for his territory he&rsquo;s also the one who in 321 bce steals alexander</p>
<p>the great&rsquo;s preserved corpse while it&rsquo;s on its way in a uh in a big display a convoy showing off</p>
<p>the god king to all the people along the royal road all the way back to macedonia where it can</p>
<p>be buried in its native soil and instead ptolemy in the greatest heist in all human history steals</p>
<p>it brings it back to egypt it will become a tourist attraction for generations and peter green</p>
<p>calls it a quasi-magical good luck charm and legitimizer of power he says in the macedonian</p>
<p>system in order to be considered a legitimate successor to the previous king you have to bury</p>
<p>the previous king and only ptolemy has the body at this point what a great heist it&rsquo;s like al capone</p>
<p>seizing all that bootleg liquor from a competitor</p>
<p>uh and essentially offering him the kingdom right i give you cleopatra it&rsquo;s jackpot you win</p>
<p>is that with all these other powerful generals against perdiccas uh he gets whacked it happens</p>
<p>to him in egypt when he&rsquo;s fighting ptolemy the guy who stole alexander&rsquo;s body uh apparently</p>
<p>officers come into perdiccas&rsquo;s tent and knife him or or get him with a sword he&rsquo;d already had</p>
<p>all kinds of debacles he had an army desert to the other side uh he had a river crossing that</p>
<p>went disastrously awry and maybe two thousand men drowned or were eaten by crocodiles and so</p>
<p>the army probably had a lot of reason to not be happy with him so when these officers knifed him</p>
<p>uh sometimes you&rsquo;ll read in the history books it&rsquo;ll say that uh he was killed by his own troops</p>
<p>and if your officers knife you that&rsquo;s still technically true but it has a different connotation</p>
<p>and in this case uh some of the histories record that ptolemy is sitting across the river with his</p>
<p>army waiting for word that this deed has been carried out that sure sounds like a mafia hit</p>
<p>though doesn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s ruthless but i keep reminding myself ruthlessness is pretty much</p>
<p>par for the course in the power politics game from the beginning of history till like yesterday</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing different about the ruthlessness it&rsquo;s always a little shocking how ruthless we</p>
<p>human beings can be sometimes but nothing new there what makes this successor&rsquo;s period so</p>
<p>fascinating and interesting and twisty and weird and different and maybe potentially upsetting</p>
<p>is that all this ruthlessness is happening between people who know each other so well</p>
<p>as we said earlier there&rsquo;s a web of connection between these people some of their families go</p>
<p>back generations some of them were toddlers together some of them were in class together</p>
<p>with aristotle almost all of them with the exception of a few were on the the big eastern</p>
<p>campaign to conquer the world with alexander i mean these are people who are closely connected</p>
<p>on a personal level so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re being ruthless against a bunch of people you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that personal angle is very strange and you wonder this is the way i always think i wonder if</p>
<p>Ptolemy felt any sort of emotional weirdness about if he was i should say disclaimer Ptolemy</p>
<p>might not have done it but the theory is telling me probably did do it he certainly may have had</p>
<p>other successors uh saying yeah go do it um but i mean would he have felt any emotional</p>
<p>pangs of um sentiment at all and if he did you&rsquo;d go okay that&rsquo;s interesting if he didn&rsquo;t that would</p>
<p>be interesting too i can hear one of my history teachers saying you&rsquo;re putting your own cultural</p>
<p>relevance into this they were raised in a different environment they wouldn&rsquo;t have thought</p>
<p>about it the way you thought about it well if that&rsquo;s true and they were able to be that kind</p>
<p>of ruthless to people they knew and sometimes cared about deeply well that&rsquo;s interesting too</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it nonetheless perdicases death is part of the first round of culling of these successor</p>
<p>bigwigs and he&rsquo;s hardly the only one there will be a number of major figures taken out</p>
<p>in this conflict so in 320 bce they have to have a conference where they all get together again</p>
<p>because they got a lot of vacancies and some of the key jobs right because the people are dead now</p>
<p>and so they have this conference in 320 in syria i believe where they&rsquo;re going to reapportion the</p>
<p>jobs fill these positions confirm other people in their positions whatever now it&rsquo;s at this point</p>
<p>that we see another uh entrance onto the history books and you get the sense that she forced her</p>
<p>way on this this is not something the historians were dying to find out again it&rsquo;s unavoidable and</p>
<p>it may explain things a day a yuridic is here again she&rsquo;s apparently at this conference she</p>
<p>comes with her husband if they&rsquo;re going to be deciding you know the power situation apparently</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s either going to be there or they&rsquo;re the you know figment of legitimacy</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s hiding behind but she goes out with these bigwigs she&rsquo;s what 17 now she asserts</p>
<p>the authority of the the throne demands more rights over the regency that kind of thing and</p>
<p>once again you&rsquo;re sitting here going wow then something happens with her you want to talk about</p>
<p>powerful women and remember with things like this this long ago you have to read between the lines</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to get separated data points and you have to say to yourself like an algebra problem</p>
<p>if she could do this what might we deduce about her right she apparently does something and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unclear again that uh that prompts all kinds of troubles and and reactions she somehow gets in</p>
<p>front of a large crowd of soldiers and starts inciting them at this conference</p>
<p>there is apparently some sort of cash flow issue uh the soldiers haven&rsquo;t been paid or do some money</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re angry about it we&rsquo;ve already pointed out occasions where the macedonian infantry the</p>
<p>rank-and-file can get kind of fiery it&rsquo;s not just the ladies in this story from the region that can</p>
<p>get that way the macedonian infantry can get a little fiery and she&rsquo;s playing that up she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inciting them one historian i read said it got to the point where they&rsquo;re the the troops were</p>
<p>almost ready to start lynching their officers or the marshals or whatnot there were two temporary</p>
<p>uh people who took perticus&rsquo;s job just until they decided something at the conference and both of</p>
<p>them were unable to handle a day of eurydice if you believe the sources sort of threw up their</p>
<p>hands and didn&rsquo;t know what to do so when i say connect the data points and realize what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on in between who the hell can&rsquo;t handle a 17 i mean you say to yourself how is she already such</p>
<p>an issue enter onto the scene antipater olympius&rsquo;s old enemy the vendetta the head of the vendetta</p>
<p>clan the whole thing right he shows up once again we imagine in his late 70s here probably</p>
<p>and he sort of quells the situation and it&rsquo;s not easy one historian said it was a um a blend of</p>
<p>firmness and conciliation that helped get the troops in line again and antipater sort of puts</p>
<p>a muzzle or a straitjacket on a day of eurydice for the moment you know throws her off a twitter</p>
<p>whatever it is whatever the ancient equivalent is but it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it was easy and the</p>
<p>fact that he&rsquo;s got to do this once again shows you that she&rsquo;s a very interesting character right</p>
<p>i sort of get the feeling like you know he&rsquo;d love to have her killed in a different world</p>
<p>it would just solve everything but his hands are tied right she&rsquo;s got the cloak of invulnerability</p>
<p>right now and she apparently knows it she&rsquo;s going to use it antipater is going to be given</p>
<p>the top job basically at this conference he&rsquo;s going to be the guy that succeeds perdicus which</p>
<p>is exactly the opposite of what olympius was hoping for right so much of the machinations that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been involved with since her son&rsquo;s death have been designed to prevent this guy from</p>
<p>becoming powerful and here he is basically now at the top of his of his game in his late 70s</p>
<p>approaching his early 80s he will come back to macedonia in 320 bce 319 bce bringing both kings</p>
<p>with him philip erodeus the mascot king and alexander&rsquo;s probably would you say toddler now</p>
<p>alexander the fourth with his mother alexander&rsquo;s persian bactrian wife essentially um antipater</p>
<p>also now will hold this office of regent he basically has all of the trappings of legitimacy</p>
<p>that you could possibly have to be the one who um you know gives orders in alexander&rsquo;s stead</p>
<p>except for alexander&rsquo;s body ptolemy is of course coveting that at home talking to it maybe when no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s looking but with antipater coming back to macedonia with this sort of power and authority</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard not to see this as one of the lowest points in olympius&rsquo;s life and maybe she&rsquo;s in great</p>
<p>physical danger here too remember not only uh did she already have a lot of water under the bridge</p>
<p>probably in the relationship with this guy but she can plausibly be accused of setting in motion</p>
<p>the wave of destruction and wars and everything that&rsquo;s been going on since alexander died so i</p>
<p>mean he&rsquo;s got a lot of reasons to want to see her gone it&rsquo;s a time when a person who had devoted</p>
<p>their entire life to a particular deity might expect a little divine intervention and perhaps</p>
<p>if you look at things from a magical point of view it&rsquo;s possible that that&rsquo;s exactly what she gets here</p>
<p>in 319 bce a relatively short time after he arrives back in macedonia after being given</p>
<p>you know the trappings of perdiccas&rsquo;s position and legitimacy antipater dies</p>
<p>is now obviously there&rsquo;s no talk of conspiracy or worries about poison and whatnot here when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 78 79 80 81 years old whatever he was uh people aren&rsquo;t surprised it&rsquo;s another reason if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a person who wants to go tell olympius don&rsquo;t think your god did this he was an old man</p>
<p>he was bound to kick off eventually she might come back with a very plausible reply and say yeah but</p>
<p>how do you explain the next part then the next part is that as antipater lay dying his son</p>
<p>cassander was supposed to be at his side when last we saw cassander alexander the great was beating</p>
<p>his head against the wall and he was forever traumatized and couldn&rsquo;t walk by a statue of</p>
<p>the great figure without going weak in the knees even decades later we&rsquo;re told cassander who might</p>
<p>have been the guy that delivered the poison to the cup bearer that killed alexander if poison did</p>
<p>kill alexander cassander&rsquo;s by his dad&rsquo;s bedside and clearly expects to be the one who his dad</p>
<p>gives his power and authority to and the reason you can deduce that is because when his dad doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>this cassander gets pissed runs off and immediately starts the second round of the successor wars</p>
<p>about 45 minutes after the last round ended you can see why people sometimes like to think of them</p>
<p>as continuous conflicts now here&rsquo;s the thing had cassander gotten the gig from his dad it would</p>
<p>have been a disaster for olympius and her people and that was sort of the one you would think was</p>
<p>going to get the job so antipater might have been old and that might have been expected but</p>
<p>the idea that antipater would hand the regency over not to his son cassander but to a person</p>
<p>who would end up being close enough to olympius to be on her side well what are the odds of that</p>
<p>sometimes it pays to have friends in high places she might think i&rsquo;ve read some really good</p>
<p>histories though that have really good rational explanations for why antipater might not have</p>
<p>given the job to cassander the first one and the most plausible being he may not have seen it as</p>
<p>his job to give it was the syndicate right the other bosses who gave me this job and and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the ones who&rsquo;ll decide who&rsquo;ll replace me i read one guy who had a great line about wisdom because</p>
<p>when you look at the only successor who&rsquo;s really going to come out ahead in all these uh crabs in</p>
<p>a bucket dynamic kind of thing it&rsquo;s going to be ptolemy the guy with alexander&rsquo;s body and sometimes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost a karmic sort of explanation given why he&rsquo;s the one that chose not to participate</p>
<p>in alexander&rsquo;s so-called funeral games right stayed out of the crabs in the bucket dynamic</p>
<p>therefore he survived right what&rsquo;s the line from war games the only way to win is not to play</p>
<p>ptolemy didn&rsquo;t play and maybe antipater by not giving his power and authority to his son</p>
<p>was basically asserting that listen son stay out of this mess and you&rsquo;ll prosper</p>
<p>but if i give this ring to you they&rsquo;re going to see this as an attempt to create a dynasty</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get all those powerful generals combining to take you down the way they took down</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just avoid this and we&rsquo;ll give the job to good old loyal polyprecon or polypercon</p>
<p>this is going to be this guy this poor polyprecon guy&rsquo;s a moment on the world stage he seems like a</p>
<p>trustworthy not very august general in a in a room full of really great generals one historian</p>
<p>in a not very nice way said he was a jackal amongst lions the lions being the great marshals</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a bad general though it&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s going to end up fighting these other generals and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really good so all of his shortcomings will be exposed and this is where um you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having that argument with olympia&rsquo;s trying to explain to her that this is not your god favoring</p>
<p>you you would come back with yeah well if your god was trying to help you out why would he</p>
<p>saddle you with the polyprecon guy as your general because that&rsquo;s where olympia&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>downside&rsquo;s going to happen in his fighting who&rsquo;s he going to be fighting cassander what&rsquo;s he going</p>
<p>to be fighting over which of the two kings gets to be the only king you know that deal when</p>
<p>alexander died we&rsquo;re going to have two kings and they&rsquo;re both going to be legitimate we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to raise them up blah blah blah yeah well that ends here uh there&rsquo;s going to be one king and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be figured out who it is over the next couple of years it&rsquo;s either going to be the</p>
<p>mascot king philip aridaeus or it&rsquo;s going to be the let&rsquo;s call him the toddler king alexander the</p>
<p>fourth maybe he&rsquo;s five years old now so maybe not toddler anymore the representatives of uh the</p>
<p>mascot king are obviously a day of eurydice they will hook their wagon both sides need military</p>
<p>support they will hook their wagon to cassander&rsquo;s cause so he&rsquo;s kind of their champion and we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know yet whether a day of eurydice figures that cassander is her puppet or whether cassander</p>
<p>figures she&rsquo;s his on the other side you have the little kid alexander the fourth you have his</p>
<p>mother alexander&rsquo;s persian bactrian wife you have olympius and you have this polypercon guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be the guy that goes and wrestles with cassander all over this theater militarily</p>
<p>and some of cassander&rsquo;s allies and basically lose that&rsquo;s what happens they lose everywhere else but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a battle that actually physically involves both of our female champions</p>
<p>here on opposite sides uh i can tell you with only a little bit of shame that the entire reason</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve told you this entire story the entire reason i would justify the 57 part series on the cable</p>
<p>network that i&rsquo;d like to do is for this battle and this scene and unfortunately the ancient sources</p>
<p>tell you it happened give you like a sentence or two but they leave out all the juicy drama and</p>
<p>color that could be in there uh so i&rsquo;ll try to fill it in with what little we know what little</p>
<p>we know is already fascinating there&rsquo;s an ancient historian uh durris of samos</p>
<p>he called this battle the first war between women certainly he is mistaken because with all of human</p>
<p>history there&rsquo;s just too much out there where you can say reasonably with an odds uh the odds out</p>
<p>there probably happened before and i always safely say it probably happened in china before it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>safe bet but in 317 bce at one point again there&rsquo;s a lot we don&rsquo;t know dating may be suspect</p>
<p>but a day ridic he might have come back to macedonia and attempted to sort of just dismiss</p>
<p>uh the guy that antipater left everything to sorry polypropylene we don&rsquo;t need you anymore</p>
<p>your services are no longer required we&rsquo;re giving it to cassander and philip erodeus is going to be</p>
<p>the new king or whatever she said that&rsquo;s so pissed off olympius that olympius uh gets an army together</p>
<p>most of them the local levies from her her homeland and she may have been ruling her</p>
<p>homeland directly at this point by the way she&rsquo;ll get her levies together she has some</p>
<p>macedonian troops uh both sides i should point out have macedonian staffs of command officers</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not operating alone there&rsquo;s a group of people deciding on strategy and all that</p>
<p>but there will be an encounter at the a pirate macedonian border between these two women</p>
<p>at the heads of their armies basically sort of let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s call them the faces of both sides</p>
<p>on one side is a day a eurydice with an army with quite a few macedonians on paper this should be</p>
<p>the victorious force because they have the deciding factor right these what do we call the</p>
<p>ancient wehrmacht units these people who conquered the world or at least the military system that</p>
<p>produced them led by officers lots of veterans it&rsquo;s a fearsome force a day a eurydice is dressed</p>
<p>like one of them in armor with weapons helmet the whole she&rsquo;s dressed like a soldier like a man</p>
<p>and her illyrian heritage is always remarked upon her mother uh certainly fought and was</p>
<p>trained to fight may have commanded troops as i said may have killed a rival queen in single</p>
<p>combat and her mother the illyrian who married married philip ii well goes without saying she</p>
<p>was trained as well i find this sort of interesting because this is a what is she about 20 years old</p>
<p>now i don&rsquo;t know when her birthday is but let&rsquo;s say 20 years old a day a eurydice she&rsquo;s essentially</p>
<p>going to go out there and and say to the men that she is every bit as able to compete in their area</p>
<p>of power as they are right it&rsquo;s the same attitude that we have today right no job should be uh</p>
<p>unavailable uh i&rsquo;m just as good as you are i can do just as good of a job as you can right</p>
<p>olympius is on the other side and she&rsquo;s going to take a totally sort of a different stand</p>
<p>this is all interpreted through me so i hope you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll give me a grain of salt here but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll explain my thinking um she doesn&rsquo;t come out dressed as a warrior she&rsquo;s not going to compete</p>
<p>and try to be an equal to the men in their area of power she has her own area of power where she</p>
<p>already has an advantage in fact she&rsquo;s got a power that nobody can touch out there and i love it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something where you know i can talk about these people believe in magic or this or</p>
<p>that all i want and make it sound like isn&rsquo;t that silly but olympius is going to do something at</p>
<p>this battle that is magical and it&rsquo;s not silly in fact the consequences of it are fearsome and</p>
<p>the repercussions are huge and if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s magic um or you don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>word that that meets the definition of what we&rsquo;re about to see here maybe you have another but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my thinking when these two armies meet there&rsquo;s going to be um quite a bit of time where they</p>
<p>face off against each other this is pretty common in a in a field battle a set piece battle from</p>
<p>these eras now they&rsquo;re not all set piece battles you have encounter battles you have battles that</p>
<p>happen between cavalry forces but when you have these kind of battles between sides that have</p>
<p>troops that stand shoulder to shoulder in ranks it often takes a long time to set up</p>
<p>think about a parade ground with tens of thousands or more people you&rsquo;re trying to get into the right</p>
<p>positions and then maybe the last minute you go i don&rsquo;t want these guys there move them 100 yards</p>
<p>down that way and then move the guys i mean there&rsquo;s finagling sometimes you have light troops</p>
<p>and skirmishers all around sort of conducting activities obscuring views and whatnot but</p>
<p>generally these two lines of people will have sometimes hours to stare at each other across a</p>
<p>sort of a no man&rsquo;s land farther than the distance an arrow can be shot that&rsquo;s sort of the point</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re just out of range but you can watch each other this is something modern</p>
<p>soldiery really doesn&rsquo;t ever get to do in fact in combat you&rsquo;re lucky to ever see an enemy sometimes</p>
<p>in modern you know any 20th century and afterward sort of combat because the ranges are so far</p>
<p>here you get to watch and have a look at and monitor your enemy for quite a long time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you see so many displays intended to intimidate the other side because you have time to do that</p>
<p>commanders often dressed quite conspicuously it&rsquo;s a trade-off you become a target for the</p>
<p>enemy when they can easily identify you but you want your own troops to be able to easily identify</p>
<p>you because one of the worst things that can happen is for a rumor to spread that you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>or something and then everything collapses and oh geez sorry almost happened to william the</p>
<p>conqueror at the battle of hastings in 1066 famously so oftentimes both sides even from</p>
<p>across the no man&rsquo;s land can pick out and identify figures you know on the other side and this is key</p>
<p>because the reason a day a eurydice is so conspicuously dressed is so that</p>
<p>they will know you know who they&rsquo;re up against right this is the queen i have philip erodeus with</p>
<p>me the king philip&rsquo;s son right we&rsquo;re the legitimate side on the other side is olympius we are told</p>
<p>dressed like a follower of dionysus maybe like a priestess of dionysus and she plays that side up</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not wearing armor um we&rsquo;re not told exactly what a follower of dionysus and dressed up like</p>
<p>that means appears as a follower of dionysus in my movie i know what it means diadem around the hair</p>
<p>flowing gown there will be snakes of course because i mean personally i think if you get one</p>
<p>snake you probably get a package deal so i&rsquo;m just watching a bunch of snakes i want my wand with ivy</p>
<p>wrapped around it dripping honey whatever but she is showing up to these people as a</p>
<p>channeler she&rsquo;s a she&rsquo;s a necromancer of sorts right she conjures the dead and she hasn&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>an occasion where she&rsquo;s had to do that she&rsquo;s like one of those um you know fast draw gunmen in the</p>
<p>west where because of their reputation you know how fast they have killed all these men or whatever</p>
<p>you know who they are uh you don&rsquo;t ask you don&rsquo;t give them any trouble you just let their reputation</p>
<p>get them what they want but every now and then some young kid comes into the town and demands</p>
<p>that this guy show him that he&rsquo;s really as fast as everyone says this is the time where olympius has</p>
<p>to conjure ghosts because she needs them now and she needs them in a physical sense in this battle</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe in magic what do you think this is before the battle starts or just as the</p>
<p>battle starts and the two sides are about to face off a day a uridic ease macedonian forces</p>
<p>lay down their weapons or they put up their spears or they send officers out who say we will</p>
<p>not fight against the mother of alexander the great and the wife of philip the second and the</p>
<p>son of alexander the great we don&rsquo;t know how they and i&rsquo;m using air quotes my hands one of my one of</p>
<p>my old ancient copies of of an ancient translation says um changed allegiances so exactly how it</p>
<p>happened isn&rsquo;t known but what is known is olympius was able to channel the ghosts in a way that</p>
<p>magically forced the other side to not fight her folks we&rsquo;re talking about a set piece battle here</p>
<p>almost certainly tens of thousands of troops on each side a massive affair of humanity out there</p>
<p>and when they notice olympius on the other side dressed as a follower of dionysus</p>
<p>even though they have a queen in their ranks with a son of philip the second they refuse to fight</p>
<p>what is that is that not magic you want an analogy there&rsquo;s a famous story about napoleon</p>
<p>and you know napoleon&rsquo;s the one who they said um that he was apparently worth his presence on the</p>
<p>battlefield was worth i&rsquo;m going from memory here i think they said 40 000 men his presence on the</p>
<p>battlefield was worth 40 000 men now they were not talking about his strategic brilliance or his</p>
<p>tactical ability all that was already baked into the pie that was taken into account right the fact</p>
<p>that as a commander making plans he would be wonderful when they said his presence is worth</p>
<p>40 000 men they meant because of the magic the emotional and inspirational ability it had on</p>
<p>his troops the the lift it gave them the sense that their destiny was now</p>
<p>latched to his destiny and his destiny was clear right in alexander&rsquo;s case he&rsquo;s a god right</p>
<p>um in napoleon&rsquo;s case well it&rsquo;s as close as you can get to a god in that era</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a famous story about napoleon that after he loses in his exile for the first time</p>
<p>he will famously come back to france unexpectedly with a small bodyguard he will land and as he</p>
<p>advances toward paris he picks up more and more troops along the way and at one point the king</p>
<p>desperate to stop him sends out forces you know to sort of end it kill him whatever it takes uh</p>
<p>with an officer who i believe going from memory here was one of napoleon&rsquo;s generals</p>
<p>and they stop him and there&rsquo;s this face-off where they&rsquo;ve got the guns pointed at him at least in</p>
<p>the movie version of it anyway um you know stand there stop you&rsquo;re under arrest whatever it is</p>
<p>napoleon walks out in front of his own bodyguard troops and says if you want to kill your emperor</p>
<p>you know here i am some wonderful dramatic move and his forces sort of dissolve into puddles of</p>
<p>emotional tears drop their guns lift him up you know and the march to paris is on viva emperor</p>
<p>you know the the magic that&rsquo;s magic folks what that is the ability to all of a sudden um just</p>
<p>morph a mass human emotional response into a way that completely changes the dynamics of a situation</p>
<p>in in a way that is inexplicable in any other sense how do you explain these macedonian forces</p>
<p>who by all rights should have destroyed olympius&rsquo;s the pirate levies laying down their arms giving</p>
<p>her the battle well you can have a number of logical explanations for that but i&rsquo;m just thinking</p>
<p>olympius is going to go and say what my irish catholic uh great aunt would always say to me</p>
<p>when i thought i would win these logical arguments with her it&rsquo;s a question of faith</p>
<p>dionysus saves her ass again and delivers into her hands her enemies philip aridaeus is captured</p>
<p>almost immediately a day a eurydice soon afterwards and they fall into olympius&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>which as you already probably know is the worst place they can be in fairness to her if the shoe</p>
<p>had been on the other foot she probably would have been doomed as well but the shoe&rsquo;s not on</p>
<p>the other foot and because of that philip aridaeus and a day erudite are doomed and she mistreats</p>
<p>them for a couple of days or a certain period of time the ancient sources say</p>
<p>before sending i have different sources on this thracians they&rsquo;re always poor thracians are always</p>
<p>implicated as like the executioners are the ones who you get to do dirty work especially if it</p>
<p>involves killing a king uh that you might not think a macedonian would handle too well you know</p>
<p>you you might think they might balk at it so instead you send the thracians in there to go</p>
<p>do that olympia supposedly sends thracians into stab philip aridaeus the mascot king to death</p>
<p>death by a blade being the way that these kind of kings were supposed to die</p>
<p>and then famously sending three items to a day a eurydice diadora siculus says it was a uh a noose</p>
<p>a sword and some hemlock hemlock&rsquo;s poison basically and this may have been what she did</p>
<p>years ago to one of philip&rsquo;s wives too it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically saying you know choose the way you want</p>
<p>to do this but you know what you have to do and instead we&rsquo;re told that she after denouncing</p>
<p>olympius and supposedly olympius was going to be nicer to her although you know if you believe it</p>
<p>uh but she kept saying the kingdom&rsquo;s supposed to be mine not yours and so she got mad at her</p>
<p>uh but instead of giving uh olympius the satisfaction of killing her with one of the</p>
<p>things olympius gave her she hangs herself with her girdle we&rsquo;re told olympius and her forces um</p>
<p>then sweep into macedonia right the queen is back and she instantly kills like a hundred of cassandra</p>
<p>supporters boom that&rsquo;s some bad publicity as peter green points out and we&rsquo;ll kind of get</p>
<p>her in trouble with a backlash that&rsquo;s going to come back to haunt her pretty much right away</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not all that olympius did by the way she also gets her hands</p>
<p>on one of cassandra&rsquo;s brothers kills him she may have she&rsquo;s accused certainly of</p>
<p>going to another of cassandra&rsquo;s brothers the guy who was alexander&rsquo;s cup bearer</p>
<p>and desecrating his grave and maybe scattering the bones out in the open which would have been</p>
<p>really sacrilegious a real religious offense to greek and macedonian sensibilities if she did it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a public statement though about what she thinks of that family the vendetta continues</p>
<p>right and your bones will not rest in peace elizabeth carney had a very interesting line</p>
<p>when she pointed out that this is exactly the sort of activity that you would think was designed to</p>
<p>bring cassandra back to macedonia right drop everything in greece and come back and deal</p>
<p>with this right before she kills more of your supporters but then she points out that when</p>
<p>he does just that neither olympius nor the guy who looks a little like her puppet general at</p>
<p>this point palipicon neither one of them seems ready for it cassandra&rsquo;s conducted all these</p>
<p>campaigns relatively brilliantly uh does so here there&rsquo;s a point where there&rsquo;s a point where uh</p>
<p>the forces of olympius try to block him like palipicons out there with troops and they all</p>
<p>try to block him and he blocks both of them and he goes right for olympius&rsquo;s forces almost as if</p>
<p>he knows the uh you know napoleon is worth 40 000 men sort of an equation and realizes to heck with</p>
<p>these little forces of troops i can deal with later get olympius she&rsquo;s the dangerous one right</p>
<p>we said in this story that the most impressive most dangerous people are the ones who are going</p>
<p>to get eliminated from these 44 45 year old conflict uh first olympius is seen by cassandra</p>
<p>for what she is she&rsquo;s the only woman you could think of that&rsquo;s in a position where she&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>macedonia she&rsquo;s got to go he will drive her forces uh into a town on the coast that is not</p>
<p>ready for any kind of siege the sources differ some saying she has almost no troops with her</p>
<p>others saying she&rsquo;s got a substantial force so who the heck knows the chronology is disputed here</p>
<p>amongst the experts some who think everything kind of collapses very quickly others who think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a year and a half long prolonged siege where people are starving you know you can</p>
<p>see the bones through the rib cage i mean that kind of starvation and the chronology is messed</p>
<p>up right including when all this goes down that we&rsquo;re about to talk about now uh but between 317</p>
<p>and 315 how about we we make it safe that way um olympius is walled up kind of under siege in the</p>
<p>city she has to surrender she either gets caught while trying to escape by sea and has to surrender</p>
<p>or she has a deal where she turns over the city and everybody agrees okay we surrender uh either</p>
<p>one of those cases the deal seems to be the same her life is supposed to be spared cassandra is</p>
<p>supposed to spare her life and and some other prominent figures lives too he will renege on</p>
<p>all of those agreements this is part of what makes cassandra the kind of character he is</p>
<p>uh you simply can&rsquo;t trust him at all and here&rsquo;s the thing before you judge him too harshly you</p>
<p>have to go if the shoe were on the other foot you know would olympius have done this she very well</p>
<p>might have so all these people are rather ruthless uh olympius gets treated a little unfairly for her</p>
<p>ruthlessness because it&rsquo;s viewed through the female lens where if she was just another guy</p>
<p>like cassandra which she kind of is sometimes um might be a little bit different in this case the</p>
<p>magic is protecting olympius apparently even now though because cassandra&rsquo;s got to figure out a way</p>
<p>to kill her he can&rsquo;t really do it in the back room the way she killed uh philip ordeos and those</p>
<p>people while she had them in custody he might lose his head if he did that so he does something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another typical macedonian thing and tries to make it sort of public so that everybody&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>on this decision he gets the macedonian army uh under very interesting dubious sorts of perhaps</p>
<p>tactics to uh put a death sentence on her he has people testify about what she did during these</p>
<p>purges and all these kinds of things and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of stories and i&rsquo;m sorry i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know one from another in terms of what&rsquo;s better in talking about what happened after the assembly</p>
<p>condemns olympius to death elizabeth carney going over a bunch of the ancient writers versions of</p>
<p>this says quote at this point the accounts diverge they differ about the context of her death</p>
<p>its perpetrators and its method pausanias simply says that cassandra turned olympius over to those</p>
<p>macedonians who were irritated with her so that she could be stoned to death justin complaining</p>
<p>that the macedonians had forgotten the wealth power and security that her husband and son had</p>
<p>brought them reports that when olympius saw armed men approaching her she went out to meet them</p>
<p>dressed in royal attire and supported by two maids this action surprised her would-be assassins</p>
<p>and reminded them of her former majesty and the names of all the kings she called to mind</p>
<p>and they did not kill her instead cassandra had to send other men to stab her rather than trying</p>
<p>to avoid the sword and its wounds or crying out quote end quote like a woman justin claims</p>
<p>that olympius faced death in the manner of brave men in keeping with the glory of her ancient</p>
<p>lineage so that quote you could see alexander even in his dying mother end quote elizabeth carney</p>
<p>continues quote by going out to meet her killers justin&rsquo;s olympius defined her death and rendered</p>
<p>it as a kind of forced suicide since she in effect chose it and chose to make it a public death</p>
<p>end quote she then goes on to reports deodorus&rsquo;s view though and his is a more confusing point of</p>
<p>view she says but may be closer to the mark and it&rsquo;s interesting she points out that cassandra</p>
<p>might have been trying to get olympius condemned by you know this large group of sort of hand-picked</p>
<p>people in a hand-picked situation so that he had the cloak of legitimacy around it</p>
<p>but prevent her from being able to ever mount a defense and carney says it was possible that it</p>
<p>was coming to a situation where she was going to have a chance now to give you know her two two</p>
<p>cents into this whole thing and her side of the story and that cassandra panicked because if she</p>
<p>could basically think about it gandalf wise if she could utter the spell everybody might be transfixed</p>
<p>right and so he has her uh done away with quietly by relatives of those that she killed in the purge</p>
<p>as a way to prevent any chance that she could work her magic again with the macedonian troops</p>
<p>or population carney then points out that if it seems a little storytelling like if it seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already been written by this storyteller and it&rsquo;s just too uh it&rsquo;s too good to be true</p>
<p>you know send the script back to the screenwriter carney points out there may have been a reason for</p>
<p>this in the same way that christianity in europe in the middle ages provides a a framework giving</p>
<p>people an idea of how to act these homeric stories and legends and traditions gave these people an</p>
<p>idea of how to act so if it seems like it&rsquo;s right out of the iliad that may be because that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>they saw these circumstances in terms of how you should act carney points out that it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>olympius&rsquo;s death but also a day of your ridicues that follows this same sort of homeric sort of</p>
<p>feel this storytelling thing where they seem like heroes in the iliad and she writes quote</p>
<p>in effect homer and tragedy gave them a script one that was genuinely meaningful to them but</p>
<p>also something they could manipulate to their own ends olympius her daughter cleopatra the</p>
<p>bachelorette and a day a eurydice may have done much the same olympius believed herself to be</p>
<p>a linear descendant of both achilles and priam the heroic tradition gave her a model for how</p>
<p>she ought to die and she may well have followed it surely she would have thought that her uh</p>
<p>grandeur and authority and honor demanded it the irony is that olympius did not die the private</p>
<p>appropriately gendered death that she had granted her female enemies men killed her with swords</p>
<p>perhaps even in public she died the death of a male hero end quote when olympius has taken out</p>
<p>her grandson alexander the fourth loses his greatest and most powerful defender and officially</p>
<p>falls under the protection of cassander so you can see how that&rsquo;s going to go he&rsquo;s just licking</p>
<p>his lips trying to decide how long he has to wait before he can get away with you know maybe just</p>
<p>being king himself and then doing away with this kid i never liked his dad anyway bashed my head</p>
<p>against the wall you know he who laughs last laughs the loudest cassander will be responsible</p>
<p>for killing alexander the great&rsquo;s son alexander the great&rsquo;s wife alexander the great&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>and of course if you believe that one branch of the conspiracy theories he</p>
<p>may have been involved in killing alexander the great himself</p>
<p>the only close relative of alexander the great he didn&rsquo;t seem to want to kill all the time</p>
<p>was alexander the great&rsquo;s sister cleopatra the bachelorette he may have</p>
<p>gone after her hand in marriage at one point because she&rsquo;s so damn eligible right</p>
<p>so much legitimacy she&rsquo;s just wouldn&rsquo;t she be a prize can you imagine that marriage talk about</p>
<p>the bad blood at that wedding when those two sides of those two families end up getting married</p>
<p>those two families end up in the same place at the same time and then have one of their</p>
<p>massive drinking contests while armed no trouble at all but cleopatra will be the close relative</p>
<p>of alexander the great that cassander doesn&rsquo;t kill she&rsquo;s almost too dangerous to kill</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s also too dangerous to leave out there running around she will find herself</p>
<p>for at least the last decade of her life under a sort of i read one account that</p>
<p>said sort of a plush or an honorable house arrest where one of these successor generals</p>
<p>just sort of locks her up like rapunzel you can&rsquo;t let her out she&rsquo;s like the typhoid mary of</p>
<p>matrimony she could get out marry some successor and all of a sudden you know you&rsquo;ve destabilized</p>
<p>the entire strategic world and hundreds of thousands of people could pay the price for</p>
<p>that right there&rsquo;s a history and she may have been trying to do just that at some point near</p>
<p>the end of her life right get out and marry somebody right everybody&rsquo;s worst fears confirmed</p>
<p>she will be probably quietly assassinated around 308 bce ish when maybe everybody&rsquo;s attention had</p>
<p>turned and the price for doing something like that had diminished somewhat it&rsquo;s worth noting that</p>
<p>the potential value of all of alexander the great&rsquo;s close relatives was so high</p>
<p>that none of them would be allowed to live there is no happily ever after in his direct line</p>
<p>or anybody really closely connected to him</p>
<p>and listen just to be silly for a minute i don&rsquo;t doubt that there&rsquo;s enough residual magic left</p>
<p>that if cassander and these other successors missed one that if some provable direct</p>
<p>descendant of alexander the great&rsquo;s family were to show up today i think they could win the top</p>
<p>job in greek or modern federation of macedonia politics it&rsquo;s macedonia actually my point is is</p>
<p>i still think there&rsquo;s enough residual power today that if somebody showed up with the right pedigree</p>
<p>and could prove it um they&rsquo;ll still be running the show in that region</p>
<p>it just goes to show that even after 2300 years the magic&rsquo;s not all gone yet</p>
<p>because the show you just heard wasn&rsquo;t long enough and the plan was for that show to be</p>
<p>about an hour and 15 minutes so you see about what my failure rate is time wise</p>
<p>but because that wasn&rsquo;t long enough let&rsquo;s add a little tag to it and forestall some emails</p>
<p>directed at me because i can already hear you you know from inside my head right now and so rather</p>
<p>than send me those emails let me answer a few of those questions or deal with a few of those</p>
<p>comments right now first for the many of you who are sitting there going does this mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to be another supernova in the east episode no it means nothing like that part of</p>
<p>the reason we have a hardcore history addendum feed is so that we can keep the other one sort of</p>
<p>purer with what you&rsquo;re waiting for while we can still take historical vacations or do different</p>
<p>things uh interview shows whatever it might be something that doesn&rsquo;t fit on the other feed this</p>
<p>was a chance to take a little historical vacation to one of my favorite times and places a place i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to read tons of books just to get enough foundational information to discuss things</p>
<p>halfway rationally i can already hear the many of you who are saying that it is irresponsible</p>
<p>of a person in my position to cast with actors and actresses philip and olympius and not cast</p>
<p>alexander it is something i wrestled with while i debated how much time i was wasting trying to</p>
<p>find the right person for philip and then you think okay you got to do alexander now too but</p>
<p>oh my god if philip was tough i mean philip&rsquo;s one of those guys i could throw somebody out there you</p>
<p>could go yeah that&rsquo;s kind of interesting alexander&rsquo;s a guy you throw your actor out there</p>
<p>you get a punch in the nose people feel passionate about that and part of the reason it&rsquo;s so tough</p>
<p>to avoid the punch in the nose is that alexander as we said you can view him so many different ways</p>
<p>that the choice of who you want to play him is sort of implicitly saying which way you choose</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it so i fooled around with it just like i did to cast philip&rsquo;s dad by the way i was also</p>
<p>looking for someone that would have just a good dynamic also with charles bronson and angelina</p>
<p>jolie i mean you think who fits who creates a wonderful weird stew there that just fits</p>
<p>well the alexander circumstance so don&rsquo;t punch me in the nose uh i have this terrible problem i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know very many actors and actresses i have an even worse problem i don&rsquo;t know any good</p>
<p>actors and actresses from that part of the world the balkans because that&rsquo;s who probably should</p>
<p>really play him so cut me some slack there and i&rsquo;m old and a lot of the people i remember who</p>
<p>are going to be from age 20 to age 32 33 the alexander lifespan there that that&rsquo;s the age</p>
<p>that actor has to play so imagine him in that age so you got to go back in the time machine get the</p>
<p>actor from them but heck i&rsquo;m getting 35 year old charles bronson or something so the time machine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working nicholas cage i know that&rsquo;s bizarre i kept coming back to him when i kept looking at</p>
<p>the other people that i was looking at maybe for the role because nobody&rsquo;s right but i have this</p>
<p>weird view of alexander and i need somebody who can sort of go from the one guy before he becomes</p>
<p>uh the guy everyone&rsquo;s bowing to in asia before he converts to the megalomania and i just thought god</p>
<p>you need a certain range and he has to look the right nicholas cage could be from that region</p>
<p>or it would blonde his hair up a little it looked like he did when he was in those new wave movies</p>
<p>in the early 80s he and charles bronson together in the scenes uh with that tension between them</p>
<p>i think would be wonderful and he and angelina jolie i mean i don&rsquo;t even have to make up any</p>
<p>script or it already seems like it&rsquo;s kind of oedipal and weird doesn&rsquo;t it anyway uh you know</p>
<p>send your angry emails to dan carlin at punch in the nose dot face eugene oregon blah blah blah</p>
<p>i should also point out that uh the emails that will come to us as they always do</p>
<p>with the pronunciation of the word macedonia versus macedonia i&rsquo;m just going to forestall</p>
<p>that because we&rsquo;ve talked about it endlessly and a bazillion other people have to this is a long</p>
<p>running thing folks i remember 30 years ago i got my first history book that actually didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>give you the option uh and and used a k instead of a c and it was over those step people i like</p>
<p>so much the tribe this the scythians um we always call them scythians because that&rsquo;s how it was</p>
<p>spelled finally one of these historians just said screw that and put a k there because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>way i mean they wouldn&rsquo;t know what the word scythian meant probably even in greece today</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not how they pronounce it that&rsquo;s part of a change in</p>
<p>in the latin language that was done in the in the late 19th century mostly i mean it&rsquo;s this is not</p>
<p>this is not some conspiracy thing it&rsquo;s not hidden um but it it created a divide between people that</p>
<p>learned it one way and don&rsquo;t want to change and that&rsquo;s fine and people who want to get back to a</p>
<p>pronunciation more like the original or more like it is in most of the world today let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>most people say macedonia or macedonia or macedonia i mean most people don&rsquo;t say macedonia</p>
<p>and most people didn&rsquo;t say macedonia back then either nobody did of course the problem is is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all hypocrites on this because while i want to be you know as close and faithful to the</p>
<p>original as possible you&rsquo;re not going to see me substituting for julius caesar julius caesar</p>
<p>although when you think about it that is a pretty badass name for some space alien</p>
<p>you know who&rsquo;s conquering things left and right right oh no julius caesar is coming you know i</p>
<p>i guess my point is is that i won&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not going to say kikero instead of cicero</p>
<p>but macedonia seems um the right thing to do just like scythian seems the right thing to do so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a judgment call potato patato it&rsquo;s not a mistake it&rsquo;s intended um you can find out stuff about</p>
<p>this all over the internet though it&rsquo;s been going on for at least 30 years finally i was listening</p>
<p>to the playback and i did not think that i did a good enough job on this program i&rsquo;m usually pretty</p>
<p>good about it of telling you exactly which book you know we said which author it often was and</p>
<p>which historian but we didn&rsquo;t tell you which books we were specifically uh using information</p>
<p>from or whatnot um we were pretty good about the elizabeth carney book olympus which as i said you</p>
<p>ought to go pick that up if you like that stuff she did a great job she&rsquo;s become the the go-to</p>
<p>person on that issue at least in english and every book you see that talks about olympus even in a in</p>
<p>a tangent kind of way references her i used two different peter green books um one was a alexander</p>
<p>of mackadon 356 to 323 bca historical biography this is the updated it&rsquo;s been updated and revised</p>
<p>several times this one came out i think in the mid early to mid-1990s um but the original work</p>
<p>was a 1970 work and then of course for those of you who are the hellenistic junkies the tome</p>
<p>for um people who are interested in the period alexander to actium the historical evolution of</p>
<p>the hellenistic age the word comprehensive does not do it justice and the whole politics</p>
<p>and strategy and and all that kind of stuff is just one little chunk of what it deals with</p>
<p>we also use robin waterfield&rsquo;s dividing the spoils the war for alexander the great&rsquo;s empire</p>
<p>a great book i mean he does as good of a job as i think you can do simplifying this stuff and</p>
<p>bringing out a bunch of the really interesting aspects because it can get dry if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dive in and and show the relationships between these people and the things that really</p>
<p>makes it really interesting i think he does a great job of that</p>
<p>we quoted ab bosworth and that was from his book conquest and empire the reign of alexander the</p>
<p>great bosworth of course one of my he&rsquo;s an australian historian one of my favorite um</p>
<p>in terms of he just his view of alexander the great is fascinating</p>
<p>and and perhaps perhaps the right one i mean i sometimes i read his stuff and i go wow you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that could really be the way the guy was finally we used uh richard a gabriel&rsquo;s book uh</p>
<p>philip ii of macedonia greater than alexander for some of the stuff as well and you know we</p>
<p>always put this stuff in the show notes which are on our website at dan carlin.com we link these</p>
<p>books directly to a place like an you know major online bookseller where you can buy them you know</p>
<p>right away one click whatever it is we encourage you to do so we like books and we like these</p>
<p>people or we wouldn&rsquo;t have used them so if you&rsquo;re thinking about buying them we&rsquo;ll go to the website</p>
<p>and check them out and uh and maybe that would be just the christmas gift for yourself for next</p>
<p>year&rsquo;s christmas why wait</p>
