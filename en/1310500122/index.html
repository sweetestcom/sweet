    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>This is a solo episode of the podcast.</p>
<p>One of many, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add these to the RSS feed</p>
<p>so you can listen to them as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s interesting to some folks.</p>
<p>These will probably have a Lex solo number</p>
<p>before the title of the episode,</p>
<p>as opposed to just the number for the regular interviews.</p>
<p>The aim is for these episodes</p>
<p>to be focused on a particular topic.</p>
<p>At times challenging, at times personal,</p>
<p>at times exciting to me on a technical</p>
<p>or philosophical level, like the episode today.</p>
<p>This episode is on the long-term future possibilities</p>
<p>of brain-computer interfaces in general,</p>
<p>and Neuralink specifically,</p>
<p>based on the recent update on progress</p>
<p>from the Neuralink team.</p>
<p>I have a basic outline in front of me with some ideas,</p>
<p>but most of it is just off the top of my head,</p>
<p>so I hope you&rsquo;re okay listening to that kind of thing,</p>
<p>about my general thoughts about Neuralink</p>
<p>and the recent update of progress.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to attend the demo in person,</p>
<p>as a random visitor, really,</p>
<p>and chat with another random,</p>
<p>but much, much smarter visitor, Jim Keller,</p>
<p>with whom I did a podcast a while ago,</p>
<p>and we agreed to do another with him soon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most interesting and brilliant people I know,</p>
<p>so it was great to catch up.</p>
<p>But outside of that, I was just a spectator,</p>
<p>everybody else watching online.</p>
<p>I have no insider information,</p>
<p>have no interest in insider information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a fan, longtime fan, of the human brain,</p>
<p>and anyone who&rsquo;s working hard</p>
<p>to understand its inner workings.</p>
<p>The general sense I got is that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of exciting engineering and scientific challenges</p>
<p>that the big and varied team there is tackling.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really exciting place to be.</p>
<p>Just lots of ideas swimming in the air,</p>
<p>and lots of brilliant people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always exciting to me to sort of be</p>
<p>in the presence of great engineering teams,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s exciting to see that.</p>
<p>But what I found especially exciting</p>
<p>for my romantic and scientific soul</p>
<p>is the long-term vision, the dreams,</p>
<p>the possibilities that were mentioned by the team</p>
<p>in a spontaneous final question that was asked,</p>
<p>where every member of the team up there answered</p>
<p>their own version of what they&rsquo;re excited about</p>
<p>to see in the next decade, two decades,</p>
<p>long-term future possibilities of this technology.</p>
<p>So this video is about that,</p>
<p>my thoughts about the possible ways</p>
<p>that Neuralink might change the world</p>
<p>and the human condition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to stick to some categories, some structure,</p>
<p>and try to discuss off the top of my head</p>
<p>my thoughts of the possibilities</p>
<p>that fall within those categories.</p>
<p>I should note here that a lot of the things I&rsquo;ll discuss</p>
<p>are long-term visions of the future.</p>
<p>To make all of these visions a reality</p>
<p>is exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a journey of many breakthroughs required,</p>
<p>but I think we are now in the realm</p>
<p>where a lot of these things are scientific</p>
<p>and engineering challenges</p>
<p>that can be solved by great teams,</p>
<p>by bold innovation from many companies,</p>
<p>not just Neuralink, hopefully many others,</p>
<p>hopefully many competitors</p>
<p>that push the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
<p>But this video is about the visions of the possible futures.</p>
<p>And I think great efforts of humankind start with a vision.</p>
<p>Let me give you a quick outline of categories</p>
<p>within which I see some exciting possibilities.</p>
<p>So first is alleviation of human suffering.</p>
<p>Second is understanding of consciousness, intelligence.</p>
<p>Third is augmentation of the body and mind,</p>
<p>and generally, augmenting reality.</p>
<p>Fourth is gaming,</p>
<p>and beyond that, virtual worlds, virtual reality.</p>
<p>Fifth is all the engineering challenges</p>
<p>around merging biological systems</p>
<p>and computational systems, basically tech.</p>
<p>Sixth is telepathy,</p>
<p>much richer forms of different communication.</p>
<p>Seventh is saving and replaying of memories,</p>
<p>but also saving and replaying of mental state</p>
<p>or mind states, period.</p>
<p>And finally, eighth is merging with artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>all the exciting possibilities around that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to discuss.</p>
<p>So since I&rsquo;m Russian,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start by discussing human suffering.</p>
<p>I think first and foremost,</p>
<p>as was mentioned by the team,</p>
<p>is the possibility that Neuralink</p>
<p>might help alleviate human suffering.</p>
<p>The nervous system, the brain,</p>
<p>at the very basic level is the source of pain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s both physical pain and psychological pain.</p>
<p>So you can talk about anxiety, depression,</p>
<p>trauma of all different kinds.</p>
<p>The ability to measure signals from the brain,</p>
<p>and perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>the ability to send signals</p>
<p>and in a closed loop interact continuously</p>
<p>with the brain, sending signals in both directions.</p>
<p>It seems like it provides a very rich toolkit</p>
<p>with which to start to deeply understand</p>
<p>the human brain generally,</p>
<p>but in the nearest term to focus that exploration</p>
<p>on the understanding of neurological diseases</p>
<p>so that we may first, of course, understand,</p>
<p>and second, to treat them.</p>
<p>A huge number of mysteries yet to be uncovered</p>
<p>at the very basic level</p>
<p>of how do we treat some of these diseases,</p>
<p>and that falls into the category of human suffering.</p>
<p>You know, we often think about suffering</p>
<p>as arising from the environment</p>
<p>within which the individual lives.</p>
<p>So by placing the focus on the environment,</p>
<p>it allows us to kind of be hopeful</p>
<p>because we can make the environment better.</p>
<p>The source of trauma, the source of anxiety,</p>
<p>the source of depression,</p>
<p>all of the things that come up in political discourse,</p>
<p>these are all things that we can do something about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we focus on</p>
<p>when we try to alleviate human suffering.</p>
<p>But from another perspective,</p>
<p>the real source of suffering and pain</p>
<p>is the human mind, which creates the experience,</p>
<p>the lived experience from the perception</p>
<p>of the external environment</p>
<p>and the perception of the internal environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of discussion of meditation, exercise,</p>
<p>a lot of social programs and education,</p>
<p>all kinds of things that aim to help the mind.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>the exciting possibility with a brain-computer interface</p>
<p>is that we might be able to accelerate our understanding</p>
<p>and treatment and control</p>
<p>of the internal environment of the mind.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it&rsquo;s also important to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s injustice in the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s evil in the world.</p>
<p>Neither Neuralink or any other piece of technology</p>
<p>will be able to get rid of hatred in the world.</p>
<p>But the hope is that at the individual level,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to aid in the alleviation to some degree</p>
<p>of all the sources of neurological suffering.</p>
<p>So second category of future possibilities in Neuralink</p>
<p>have to do around our understanding</p>
<p>of how the brain and the mind works</p>
<p>and all of the things that derive from that.</p>
<p>So basically, we&rsquo;ll supercharge research</p>
<p>going on in neuroscience today.</p>
<p>So first is understanding how the brain works</p>
<p>at the functional level.</p>
<p>So all the different modules,</p>
<p>from memory to perception to cognition</p>
<p>and all the sub-modules of that.</p>
<p>And as we untangle those pieces,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that it will inspire or instruct us</p>
<p>on the engineering side of how to build smarter</p>
<p>and smarter artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>So inspire totally new algorithms for learning systems,</p>
<p>for reasoning systems, for knowledge base,</p>
<p>knowledge acquisition, and so on.</p>
<p>And as you push that further, of course,</p>
<p>to me as an artificial intelligence researcher,</p>
<p>the exciting possibility is that we may be able</p>
<p>to understand human intelligence,</p>
<p>where, not location-wise, but functionally,</p>
<p>where intelligence arises in the brain,</p>
<p>or good answers to the question of what is intelligence.</p>
<p>And the next step is, beyond just engineering AI systems,</p>
<p>that may help us understand how we enhance it.</p>
<p>You have all these productivity hacks,</p>
<p>all these kind of life hacks.</p>
<p>Understanding from where our ability to reason</p>
<p>about this world comes from might help us</p>
<p>to really have some nice brain hacks</p>
<p>to improve our ability to reason</p>
<p>in a purely natural way, I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>This is before any kind of augmentation</p>
<p>from a computational device.</p>
<p>Now the next level of understanding the human brain,</p>
<p>as was mentioned by the team,</p>
<p>as I bring up often, is a fascinating,</p>
<p>hardest, most interesting problem, I would say,</p>
<p>in the mind, is the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>Beyond intelligence, where does consciousness</p>
<p>arise from the brain?</p>
<p>Again, not location-wise, but functionally.</p>
<p>And again, to be able to, with more scientific rigor,</p>
<p>answer the question, what is consciousness?</p>
<p>Is it a property of matter?</p>
<p>Is it a unique emergent property of the human brain?</p>
<p>Is it something totally different</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t even understand?</p>
<p>Like our mind is some kind of key</p>
<p>into an alternate dimension that only psychedelics</p>
<p>and a device like Neuralink may be able to unlock.</p>
<p>So at the risk of sounding crazy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an exciting possibility to take consciousness</p>
<p>from, I would say, a field of philosophy</p>
<p>in the 20th century to a field of science</p>
<p>and engineering in the 21st century.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s deeply interlinked with intelligence</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a beautiful dance there</p>
<p>between consciousness and intelligence in the human mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not easy or even necessary to untangle,</p>
<p>but I think understanding one</p>
<p>will help us understand the other.</p>
<p>And finally, perhaps, interconnected with consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence, it might help us take the question of,</p>
<p>is there free will into the realm</p>
<p>of science and engineering versus the realm of philosophy?</p>
<p>To try to make a rigorous study of,</p>
<p>where does this experience of making a choice,</p>
<p>making decisions, like we humans have a control</p>
<p>of the way the future unfolds from where that arises,</p>
<p>is that a real part of the fabric of reality</p>
<p>or is that something that the brain conjures up?</p>
<p>What I see Neuralink as,</p>
<p>as I talked with Elon the second time on the podcast,</p>
<p>I see it as a way to sort of get beyond the factory walls</p>
<p>and see how the inner workings of the factories operate.</p>
<p>As a scientist, as an engineer, and a bit of a philosopher,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s truly exciting.</p>
<p>Third future possibility of Neuralink</p>
<p>is augmentations of all different kinds.</p>
<p>So regaining the ability to move</p>
<p>for people who can&rsquo;t move parts of their body.</p>
<p>I mentioned neurological conditions that affect the mind,</p>
<p>but certainly there&rsquo;s neurological conditions</p>
<p>that affect the body.</p>
<p>I mean, giving people who can&rsquo;t walk</p>
<p>the ability to walk again or to walk for the first time,</p>
<p>such an exciting possibility.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen videos of people who, for the first time,</p>
<p>are able to see color or gain a function</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t have before through technology,</p>
<p>the bliss in their eyes is magical.</p>
<p>Now, the augmentation doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>just in regaining the physical function of the body.</p>
<p>It could be augmentation to the mind.</p>
<p>It could be, for example, regaining the ability to see</p>
<p>by stimulating the visual cortex,</p>
<p>connecting a camera to the visual cortex.</p>
<p>And perhaps more than regaining regular visual function,</p>
<p>it could lead to superhuman-level vision,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s expanding the spectrum,</p>
<p>like ability to see infrared,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s doing some basic augmented reality kind of things</p>
<p>where some of the detections are done for you</p>
<p>about moving objects, about the categories of objects,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas here are the same as those explored</p>
<p>by the work that people are doing</p>
<p>in augmented reality devices,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very possible that the difference</p>
<p>between a brain-computer interface and glasses, for example,</p>
<p>or heads-up displays, is that BCIs might be able</p>
<p>to create a much richer, high-bandwidth experience</p>
<p>with a fast, closed loop of perception,</p>
<p>more so than the constraints that you have to operate under</p>
<p>with glasses or HUDs.</p>
<p>Fourth, a super exciting possibility for those of us</p>
<p>who were once gamers, or still are gamers,</p>
<p>is by creating an immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p>So BCIs might be able to, once again,</p>
<p>read the brain and stimulate parts of the brain</p>
<p>that enrich in some way the gaming experience.</p>
<p>This could be very shallow, kind of basic enrichment,</p>
<p>just being able to measure levels of excitement, emotion,</p>
<p>those kinds of things that can aid</p>
<p>in the experience of the game.</p>
<p>But also, again, as I said, with augmented reality,</p>
<p>being able to stimulate the visual cortex</p>
<p>in order to create an immersive visual experience.</p>
<p>So with a brain-computer interface,</p>
<p>beyond just gaming, you can start to think</p>
<p>about creating virtual worlds, virtual reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very useful for games,</p>
<p>but just creating an immersive experience</p>
<p>of all different kinds.</p>
<p>Again, this is an open question,</p>
<p>but there could be technical barriers</p>
<p>in creating an immersive, rich, high-bandwidth experience</p>
<p>with a virtual reality headset</p>
<p>versus a brain-computer interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question of creating</p>
<p>a fully immersive experience, what is easier to do</p>
<p>in the long sort of arc of history?</p>
<p>With the technology we have today,</p>
<p>it seems clearly more doable in the short term</p>
<p>to create virtual reality experiences with a headset</p>
<p>as opposed to something that requires brain surgery.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say,</p>
<p>if we look at the long arc of technological progress,</p>
<p>that the much easier solution won&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from the direct access to the brain</p>
<p>through something like a brain-computer interface.</p>
<p>And again, I think bigger than gaming,</p>
<p>a lot of people write to me about psychedelics,</p>
<p>for example, which I&rsquo;ve never done.</p>
<p>But this would be an example of something</p>
<p>where you can create visual experiences</p>
<p>that are safe and controlled</p>
<p>and can take you, perhaps,</p>
<p>to some of those different multiple dimensions</p>
<p>or wherever the heck you go when you take psychedelics</p>
<p>in a more controlled way, perhaps.</p>
<p>And maybe even taking a step back</p>
<p>into more kind of vanilla experiences</p>
<p>of visualizations and meditation.</p>
<p>So imagine the closed loop</p>
<p>of being able to write and read from the brain</p>
<p>in aiding the meditation experience,</p>
<p>sort of emptying your brain from thoughts</p>
<p>figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>The fifth exciting future possibilities</p>
<p>of Neuralink and brain-computer interfaces</p>
<p>is all the innovation and engineering</p>
<p>around the two-way communication</p>
<p>between a human-made electrical computational system</p>
<p>and a biological system.</p>
<p>Just the fabric, the nature of the two design paradigms,</p>
<p>not saying biological systems are designed,</p>
<p>but they are designed through evolution.</p>
<p>Whatever that resilient mess, mush of biology</p>
<p>to the more structured, architectured electrical systems</p>
<p>that are programmed explicitly and clearly,</p>
<p>the communication between these two different worlds</p>
<p>and bringing them closer and closer together</p>
<p>is super exciting.</p>
<p>First, at the very basic level,</p>
<p>that could be all the innovation</p>
<p>around robotic neurosurgery or even surgery in general.</p>
<p>So allowing robots to do what narrow AI systems do best,</p>
<p>which is for basic tasks that have vision and control</p>
<p>where everything is controlled in the environment.</p>
<p>Fully actuated system to be able to minimize</p>
<p>the risk of injury, maximize the probability of success.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting innovations</p>
<p>around just the robotic side of that.</p>
<p>The next layer of that,</p>
<p>when you look at some of the materials engineering</p>
<p>and even the computational side</p>
<p>of connecting the laces to the brain,</p>
<p>so connecting the electrical device</p>
<p>to the biological device,</p>
<p>we may be able to understand how to engineer</p>
<p>sort of physical computational systems</p>
<p>that have some of the same nice properties of resilience</p>
<p>that biological systems have.</p>
<p>And in so doing, be able to work better</p>
<p>with biological systems,</p>
<p>but also just be able to be more resilient, more robust,</p>
<p>more adaptable perhaps,</p>
<p>or maybe come up with totally different ways</p>
<p>that such systems can learn about their environment,</p>
<p>just like our biological systems can at multiple levels.</p>
<p>And another layer of that,</p>
<p>when you look at what Neuralink is currently doing,</p>
<p>they have 1,024 channels.</p>
<p>The engineering around scaling that to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna put numbers out,</p>
<p>but any number above that is super exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already 100x anything else that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>but you can imagine, especially long-term,</p>
<p>it being 10,000, 100,000.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be millions, maybe billions.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much possibility</p>
<p>of engineering breakthroughs</p>
<p>about the number of channels that are possible</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t yet imagine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a engineering challenge</p>
<p>of how to scale these number of connections,</p>
<p>which are tricky to do</p>
<p>because they have to live, exist successfully</p>
<p>in cooperation with biological systems</p>
<p>for months, years, for long periods of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a forcing function</p>
<p>for us to understand really how we can engineer systems</p>
<p>that in the best possible ways</p>
<p>are not only able to work with other biological systems,</p>
<p>but become more like those biological systems.</p>
<p>So sixth possible future of Neuralink and BCIs</p>
<p>was mentioned a few times by the team</p>
<p>under the flag of telepathic communication or telepathy,</p>
<p>conceptual and consensual telepathy.</p>
<p>So I think, in general,</p>
<p>to enrich the bandwidth in quantity and quality</p>
<p>of the communication between two human beings.</p>
<p>So you can imagine being able to communicate</p>
<p>not just through this kind of 1D realm of words,</p>
<p>but to communicate visual concepts, first of all,</p>
<p>but also kind of mind maps</p>
<p>of like multi-dimensional concept maps</p>
<p>that are in our mind</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re trying to reason through things,</p>
<p>to be able to communicate those in some way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be kind of perfect replication,</p>
<p>but any kind of improvement,</p>
<p>increase in the bandwidth</p>
<p>of the communication between humans</p>
<p>on the visual or on the conceptual side</p>
<p>is super interesting.</p>
<p>I think somebody on the team mentioned kind of art,</p>
<p>to be able to communicate creative,</p>
<p>artistic kind of things in your mind</p>
<p>and share them with others</p>
<p>without having to learn the skill of converting that art</p>
<p>into something in a physical world</p>
<p>that can be observed by others.</p>
<p>You can sort of directly, without learning the skill,</p>
<p>be able to communicate all the crazy beautiful things</p>
<p>that are in your mind.</p>
<p>I think for my world of like programming, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be exciting to think that two human beings</p>
<p>at any level could sort of collaborate together.</p>
<p>It gives a whole nother meaning to pair coding,</p>
<p>where two people can collaborate together</p>
<p>as they work on a project of any kind,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the programming world</p>
<p>or any kind of design world,</p>
<p>architecture, any kind of illustrations,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Collaborations between humans for intellectual labor,</p>
<p>for design, for engineering work,</p>
<p>or any kind of collaboration in the intellectual space.</p>
<p>And finally, I think it&rsquo;d be pretty good for podcasting.</p>
<p>So for those of us who don&rsquo;t like the sound of our voice,</p>
<p>and funny enough, don&rsquo;t like to be in front of the camera,</p>
<p>instead of having to convert my thoughts awkwardly</p>
<p>in a monotone voice into a microphone,</p>
<p>I can somehow communicate them in a much richer way,</p>
<p>which I think at least for an introvert,</p>
<p>I think the kind of things going on in my mind</p>
<p>seem to be much more eloquent and interesting</p>
<p>than the kind of things that come out of my mouth</p>
<p>when I perform the conversion.</p>
<p>So from like a car mechanic,</p>
<p>or maybe I should say like brain mechanic perspective,</p>
<p>my converter is not working very well</p>
<p>between the brain thoughts and visualizations</p>
<p>and concept space to mouth speaking</p>
<p>different English concepts.</p>
<p>So I look forward to this podcast</p>
<p>being consumed and generated telepathically.</p>
<p>So seven possible future application of Neuralink</p>
<p>will be the ability to save and replay memories,</p>
<p>or save and replay mind states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to do what Daniel Kahneman, for example,</p>
<p>talks about as many of us kind of live life</p>
<p>through memories of previous events.</p>
<p>So kind of the memorable, special things that happen to us</p>
<p>are experienced more deeply and more frequently</p>
<p>through our memories than directly</p>
<p>when we actually experience them for the first time.</p>
<p>And the exciting possibility of Neuralink</p>
<p>is basically improving the resolution of that memory replay</p>
<p>that we generally do anyway.</p>
<p>As people should check out Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>he describes it quite eloquently.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, many of us live in our memories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also from a certain perspective,</p>
<p>nice to be able to modify, delete,</p>
<p>or alter some of those memories.</p>
<p>So for example, on a darker side,</p>
<p>it could be traumatic events</p>
<p>that from a psychological perspective could be haunting.</p>
<p>You can remove or at least alleviate</p>
<p>the impact of those memories onto your cognition,</p>
<p>or maybe pull stuff from the subconscious.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a Freud&rsquo;s favorite kind of toolkit</p>
<p>to play around and explore with our own mind</p>
<p>to discover our demons.</p>
<p>So as opposed to the David Goggins approach</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve taken recently of doing insane amounts of exercise</p>
<p>to discover and have a conversation with my demons,</p>
<p>could do it in a more controlled and safe environment</p>
<p>of brain-computer interfaces.</p>
<p>As a quick side note, there&rsquo;s interesting echoes</p>
<p>of the memory replay that you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in our reinforcement learning systems.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think that</p>
<p>instead of just us being able to replay our memories,</p>
<p>it could be our own little machine learning systems</p>
<p>that can learn something from our previous memories</p>
<p>by replaying them over and over</p>
<p>to try to give us maybe a strategy</p>
<p>of how to avoid those memories in the past.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically converting our prior experiences</p>
<p>into data, and once it&rsquo;s converted into data,</p>
<p>that could be used for all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>So you can think of like a personal machine learning system</p>
<p>that can replay your memories and try to figure out,</p>
<p>try to be a personal executive assistant to you</p>
<p>to advise you what to learn from those experiences.</p>
<p>With a lot of these applications that I&rsquo;ve already discussed,</p>
<p>privacy and security is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>I mean, like with actually a lot of our technology,</p>
<p>but this is very much at the forefront</p>
<p>of what Neuralink is working on currently</p>
<p>and always will be, and I think a lot of companies</p>
<p>in general in the tech space will sink or swim</p>
<p>based on how much they respect privacy and security.</p>
<p>I think in the early days of our development</p>
<p>with social networks and so on,</p>
<p>you could get away easier</p>
<p>by being careless with people&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>I think my long-term, perhaps optimistic,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a realistic view of the future</p>
<p>that people will demand much more control over their data,</p>
<p>demand much more transparency around privacy and security,</p>
<p>transparency and clarity.</p>
<p>So of course, that&rsquo;s underlying all the different futures</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m discussing.</p>
<p>And finally, to move a little bit beyond the ability</p>
<p>to save and replay memories is to save mental states,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s essentially a path towards digital immortality.</p>
<p>So you can think of being able to save the contents</p>
<p>or the critical contents of your mind into digital form</p>
<p>and then being able to transfer it to other systems,</p>
<p>to robots, or as in, for example,</p>
<p>my discussion with Sarah Seager,</p>
<p>who searches for habitable planets</p>
<p>outside our solar system, exoplanets.</p>
<p>We discussed the idea that one way, perhaps,</p>
<p>to reach far away livable planets</p>
<p>that might have extraterrestrial intelligent life on them</p>
<p>is by sending digital humans there.</p>
<p>So being able to save essential</p>
<p>or entire contents of the human mind</p>
<p>and to be able to reload it once you arrive</p>
<p>into any kind of, whether it&rsquo;s a biological</p>
<p>or a robotic system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that Ray Kurzweil thinks about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a kind of stuff that I think a lot of people</p>
<p>are excited about is the ability to store</p>
<p>and digitally transfer the contents,</p>
<p>the important, the beautiful contents of the human mind.</p>
<p>Finally, the eighth future possibility of Neuralink,</p>
<p>and also one of the original motivations</p>
<p>behind the company, is the methodology</p>
<p>by which the human mind, the human brain,</p>
<p>the human society can merge</p>
<p>with artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>once they&rsquo;re able to achieve human level</p>
<p>and superhuman level intelligence.</p>
<p>Since the origins of the field of AI,</p>
<p>most, if not all, of the progress that&rsquo;s been made</p>
<p>has been in what might be called</p>
<p>narrow artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>But as a lot of people have discussed,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a lot of debates around this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of thoughts, but it seems very possible</p>
<p>that humans, limited though we are,</p>
<p>will one day be able to engineer systems</p>
<p>that are far more intelligent than us human beings</p>
<p>in some dimension that fundamentally changes</p>
<p>the fabric of human society.</p>
<p>So we already have AI systems that are much better</p>
<p>at a lot of things than humans in a narrow way,</p>
<p>but there might be a set of dimensions</p>
<p>where an intelligence system is able to generalize</p>
<p>better than humans in a set of tasks</p>
<p>that can lead to existential risks to human beings,</p>
<p>where artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>essentially become a kind of direct or indirect competitor,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s a paperclip manufacturing AI systems</p>
<p>that destroys all humans just to make</p>
<p>its manufactured paperclips a little bit more efficient,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s a much more complex distributed system,</p>
<p>kind of like our social networks of today,</p>
<p>but much smarter with some kind of combination</p>
<p>of GPT-3 or GPT-20 systems that kind of creep up on us</p>
<p>like the boiling water creeps up on the lobster</p>
<p>and overwhelms the resources or the capacities</p>
<p>of human civilization in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamentally traumatic or destructive</p>
<p>or poses an existential risk.</p>
<p>Even if that point is far away in time,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s difficult to predict,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to rationally say</p>
<p>that we will never reach that point.</p>
<p>So once you allow that as a possibility,</p>
<p>you start to think from a engineering perspective,</p>
<p>how can we minimize the existential risk</p>
<p>associated with that?</p>
<p>And then creating ways to merge with the AI</p>
<p>so we kind of ride the wave of AI</p>
<p>and they ride the wave of the functionalities</p>
<p>of the human brain is an interesting possibility.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful vision of a future</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly filled with mystery.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know how AGI systems will evolve,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting idea that as AI systems</p>
<p>become smarter and smarter,</p>
<p>it is one way to ensure our survival</p>
<p>is to expand the capacity of the human mind</p>
<p>to communicate with AI and with the AI</p>
<p>to communicate with the human mind.</p>
<p>At the basic level, to me that&rsquo;s super exciting</p>
<p>because AI systems can learn from the brain,</p>
<p>the brain can learn from AI systems.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, as a person who is a big fan of deep thinking,</p>
<p>of sitting for multiple hours and focusing on a single idea</p>
<p>and just thinking with a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and thinking about an idea,</p>
<p>I find myself needing to look up things a lot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually a huge distraction</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge drain on my mental resources</p>
<p>and the kind of distraction, the timing of the thinking</p>
<p>is disrupted by having to look up</p>
<p>different kinds of information,</p>
<p>to look up different kinds of papers,</p>
<p>to look up even basic information on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So the ability to kind of close the loop,</p>
<p>to increase the bandwidth of thinking,</p>
<p>of the lookup of the information that&rsquo;s available online</p>
<p>is super exciting to me.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not even AGI,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like basic recommender systems,</p>
<p>basic search engines, basic even like GBT three plus plus</p>
<p>type of communication back and forth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really exciting to empower the brain</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s doing the usual kind of deep thinking</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>but then of course you could take that farther</p>
<p>as the AI systems get smarter and smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>If we completely open the gates of the communication</p>
<p>in two ways, then it increases the likelihood of AGI</p>
<p>not leaving us behind.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a scary and exciting future</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably where we humans do our best work.</p>
<p>I hope these thoughts were interesting,</p>
<p>useful to some of you.</p>
<p>In these difficult times of economic pain,</p>
<p>of political division,</p>
<p>I personally and I hope others do too,</p>
<p>draw a lot of inspiration from companies,</p>
<p>from people, from scientists</p>
<p>that are boldly pushing forward</p>
<p>the limits of human knowledge,</p>
<p>the limits of human capability</p>
<p>and just engineering and building,</p>
<p>doing their best to engineer and build</p>
<p>a better future for our world.</p>
<p>So I hope you find it inspiring as well.</p>
<p>And as always, I love you all</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
