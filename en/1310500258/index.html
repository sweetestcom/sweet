    <p>The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattacharya,</p>
<p>Professor of Medicine, Health Policy and Economics</p>
<p>at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns</p>
<p>and the blinding, destructive effects of arrogance</p>
<p>on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.</p>
<p>Jay Bhattacharya is the coauthor</p>
<p>of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,</p>
<p>a one page document that in October 2020</p>
<p>made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Most of this podcast conversation</p>
<p>is about the ideas related to this document.</p>
<p>And so let me say a few things here about what troubles me.</p>
<p>Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy</p>
<p>often ignore the quiet suffering of millions</p>
<p>that it results in, which includes economic pain,</p>
<p>loss of jobs that give meaning and pride</p>
<p>in the face of uncertainty, the increase in suicide</p>
<p>and suicidal ideation, and in general,</p>
<p>the fear and anger that arises from the powerlessness</p>
<p>forced onto the populace</p>
<p>by the self proclaimed elites and experts.</p>
<p>Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns</p>
<p>talk down to the masses about which path forward</p>
<p>is right and which is wrong.</p>
<p>What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy</p>
<p>among the policymakers for the common man</p>
<p>and in general for people unlike themselves.</p>
<p>The landscape of suffering is vast</p>
<p>and must be fully considered</p>
<p>in calculating the response to the pandemic</p>
<p>with humility and with rigorous,</p>
<p>open minded scientific debate.</p>
<p>Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins</p>
<p>to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two coauthors</p>
<p>fringe epidemiologists and also called</p>
<p>for a devastating published take down of their ideas.</p>
<p>These words from Francis broke my heart.</p>
<p>I understand them, I can even steel man them,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, on balance,</p>
<p>they show to me a failure of leadership.</p>
<p>Leadership in a pandemic is hard,</p>
<p>which is why great leaders are remembered by history.</p>
<p>They are rare, they stand out and they give me hope.</p>
<p>Also, this whole mess inspires me</p>
<p>on my small individual level to do the right thing</p>
<p>in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.</p>
<p>I talked to Francis Collins,</p>
<p>I talked to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO.</p>
<p>I also talked and will continue to talk</p>
<p>with people like Jay and other dissenting voices</p>
<p>that challenge the mainstream narratives</p>
<p>and those in the seats of power.</p>
<p>I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>in their ideas with respect and empathy,</p>
<p>but also with guts and skill.</p>
<p>The skill part, I hope to improve on over time.</p>
<p>And I do believe that conversation</p>
<p>and an open mind is the way out of this.</p>
<p>And finally, as I&rsquo;ve said in the past,</p>
<p>I value love and integrity far, far above money,</p>
<p>fame and power.</p>
<p>Those latter three are all ephemeral.</p>
<p>They slip through the fingers of anyone</p>
<p>who tries to hold on and leave behind</p>
<p>an empty shell of a human being.</p>
<p>I prefer to die a man who lived by principles</p>
<p>that nobody could shake and a man</p>
<p>who added a bit of love to the world.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jay Bhattacharya.</p>
<p>To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?</p>
<p>Do we have a good measure for this very question?</p>
<p>So the best evidence for COVID, the deadliness of COVID,</p>
<p>comes from a whole series of seroprevalence studies.</p>
<p>Seroprevalence studies are these studies</p>
<p>of antibody prevalence in the population at large.</p>
<p>I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,</p>
<p>one in Santa Clara County, one in L.A. County,</p>
<p>and one with Major League Baseball around the U.S.</p>
<p>If I may just pause you for a second.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t know what serology is and seroprevalence,</p>
<p>it does sound like you say zero prevalence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s sero and serology is antibodies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a survey that counts the number of antibodies.</p>
<p>Specific to COVID, yes.</p>
<p>People that have antibodies specific to COVID,</p>
<p>which perhaps shows an indication</p>
<p>that they likely have had COVID,</p>
<p>and therefore this is a way to study</p>
<p>how many people in the population</p>
<p>have been exposed to or have had COVID.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So the idea is that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly the number of people with COVID</p>
<p>just by counting the people</p>
<p>that present themselves with symptoms of COVID.</p>
<p>COVID has, it turns out, a very wide range of symptoms,</p>
<p>ranging from no symptoms at all</p>
<p>to this deadly viral pneumonia</p>
<p>that has killed so many people.</p>
<p>And the problem is, if you just count the number of cases,</p>
<p>the people who have very few symptoms</p>
<p>often don&rsquo;t show up for testing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re outside of the can of public health.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to know the answer to your question</p>
<p>without understanding how many people are infected,</p>
<p>because you can probably tell the number of deaths,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s some controversy over that.</p>
<p>But that, so the numerator is possible,</p>
<p>but the denominator is much harder.</p>
<p>How much controversy is there about the death?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go on a million tangents.</p>
<p>Is that, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna, I have a million questions.</p>
<p>So one, I love data so much,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like almost tuned out</p>
<p>paying attention to COVID data,</p>
<p>because I feel like I&rsquo;m walking on shaky ground.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who to trust.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,</p>
<p>different kinds of data.</p>
<p>The death one, that seems like a really important one.</p>
<p>Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,</p>
<p>or is it just a giant, messy thing that mixed up?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this kind of stories about hospitals</p>
<p>being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some truth in some of that.</p>
<p>Let me just talk about the incentives.</p>
<p>So in the United States, we passed this CARES Act</p>
<p>that was aimed at making sure hospital systems</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The couple of things they did,</p>
<p>one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,</p>
<p>tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.</p>
<p>And the other thing they did is they gave a 20% bump</p>
<p>to Medicare payments for elderly patients</p>
<p>who are treated with COVID.</p>
<p>The idea is that there&rsquo;s more expensive to treat them</p>
<p>at the early days.</p>
<p>So that did provide an incentive</p>
<p>to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital,</p>
<p>because your financial success of the hospital,</p>
<p>or at least not lack of financial ruin</p>
<p>depended on having many COVID patients.</p>
<p>The other thing on the death certificates</p>
<p>is that reporting of deaths is a separate issue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a financial incentive there,</p>
<p>but there is this sort of like complicated,</p>
<p>you know, when you fill out a death certificate</p>
<p>for a patient with a lot of conditions,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say a patient has diabetes,</p>
<p>a patient that, well, that diabetes could lead</p>
<p>to heart failure.</p>
<p>You know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,</p>
<p>your lungs fill up, then you get COVID and you die.</p>
<p>So what do you write on the death certificate?</p>
<p>Was it COVID that killed you?</p>
<p>Was it the lungs filling up?</p>
<p>Was it the heart failure?</p>
<p>Was it the diabetes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to like disentangle.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of times what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>is that people have like erred</p>
<p>on the side of signing it as COVID.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the evidence of this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a couple of audits of death certificates</p>
<p>in places like Santa Clara County,</p>
<p>where I live, in Alameda County, California,</p>
<p>where they carefully went through the death certificate</p>
<p>and said, okay, is this reasonable to say</p>
<p>this was actually COVID or it was COVID incidental?</p>
<p>And they found that about 25%, 20, 25% of the deaths</p>
<p>were more likely incidental than directly due to COVID.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t get too excited about this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a philosophical question, right?</p>
<p>Like ultimately, what kills you?</p>
<p>Which is an odd thing to say if you&rsquo;re not in medicine,</p>
<p>but like really, it&rsquo;s almost always multifactorial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always just the bus hits you.</p>
<p>The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.</p>
<p>Was it the brain bleed that killed you?</p>
<p>Would it have burst anyway?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?</p>
<p>The way you die is a philosophical question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a sociological and psychological question</p>
<p>because it seems like every single person</p>
<p>who has passed away over the past couple of years,</p>
<p>kind of the first question that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Was it COVID?</p>
<p>Not just because you&rsquo;re trying to be political,</p>
<p>but just in your mind.</p>
<p>No, I think there&rsquo;s a psychological reason for this, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, we spent the better part</p>
<p>of at least a half century in the United States</p>
<p>not worried too much about infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The notion was we essentially conquered them.</p>
<p>It was something that happens</p>
<p>in far away places to other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true for much of the developed world.</p>
<p>Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.</p>
<p>And for the first time in living memory,</p>
<p>we have a disease that can kill us.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re effectively evolved to fear that,</p>
<p>like the panic centers of our brain,</p>
<p>the lizard part of our brain takes over.</p>
<p>And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not surprising that people,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re filling out death certificates</p>
<p>or thinking about what led to the death,</p>
<p>this most salient thing that&rsquo;s in the front</p>
<p>of everyone&rsquo;s brain would jump to the top.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t ignore this very deep psychological thing</p>
<p>when we consider what people say on the internet,</p>
<p>what people say to each other,</p>
<p>what people write in scientific papers, everything.</p>
<p>It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,</p>
<p>everything changed in the way people feel about each other,</p>
<p>just the way they communicate with each other.</p>
<p>I think the level of emotion involved,</p>
<p>I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.</p>
<p>For sometimes short periods of time</p>
<p>and sometimes it was always therapeutic,</p>
<p>like you were waiting to get out</p>
<p>like the darkest parts of you,</p>
<p>just to say, if you&rsquo;re angry at something in this world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say it now.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably talking</p>
<p>to some deep primal thing that fear we have</p>
<p>for formalities of all different kinds.</p>
<p>And then when that fear is aroused</p>
<p>in all the deepest emotions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a Freudian psychotherapy session,</p>
<p>but across the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that psychologists are going to have</p>
<p>a field day with for a generation trying to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, I think what you say is right,</p>
<p>but piled on top of that is also this sort of,</p>
<p>this impetus to empathy,</p>
<p>the empathized compassion toward others,</p>
<p>essentially militarized, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m protecting you by some actions</p>
<p>and those actions, if I don&rsquo;t do them,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do them,</p>
<p>well, that must mean you hate me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s created this like social tension</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>And we looked at each other</p>
<p>as if we were just simply sources of germs</p>
<p>rather than people to get to know,</p>
<p>people to enjoy, people to get to learn from.</p>
<p>It colored basically almost every human interaction</p>
<p>for every human on the planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, the basic common humanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can wear a mask,</p>
<p>you can stand far away,</p>
<p>but the love you have for each other</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>that was dissipating by region too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced having traveled</p>
<p>quite a bit throughout this time.</p>
<p>It was really sad,</p>
<p>even people that are really close together,</p>
<p>just the way they stood,</p>
<p>the way they looked at each other.</p>
<p>And it made me feel for a moment</p>
<p>that the fabric that connects all of us</p>
<p>is more fragile than I thought.</p>
<p>I mean, if you walk down the street,</p>
<p>or if you ever, if you did this during COVID,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you had this experience</p>
<p>where you walk down the street,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not wearing a mask,</p>
<p>or even if you are,</p>
<p>people will jump off the sidewalk</p>
<p>that you walked past them,</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re poison,</p>
<p>even though the data are that COVID spreads</p>
<p>indifferently outdoors,</p>
<p>or if at all, really, outdoors.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not simply a biological</p>
<p>or infectious disease phenomenon,</p>
<p>or epidemiological phenomenon.</p>
<p>It is a change in the way humans treated each other,</p>
<p>I hope temporary.</p>
<p>I do wanna say on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts</p>
<p>when the pandemic broke out.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where I was, yeah.</p>
<p>And then I came here to Austin, Texas</p>
<p>to visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and he was the first person without pause,</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t a political statement,</p>
<p>this was anything,</p>
<p>just walked toward me and gave me a big hug</p>
<p>and say, it&rsquo;s great to see you.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you how great it felt</p>
<p>because I, in that moment,</p>
<p>realized the absence of that connection back in Boston</p>
<p>over just a couple of months.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ll talk about it more,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s tragic to think about that distancing,</p>
<p>that dissolution of common humanity at scale,</p>
<p>what kind of impact it has on society.</p>
<p>Just across the board, political division,</p>
<p>and just in the quiet of your own mind,</p>
<p>in the privacy of your own home, the depression,</p>
<p>the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide.</p>
<p>And forget suicide, just low key suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that&rsquo;s the suffering,</p>
<p>that isolation, we&rsquo;re not meant to live alone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not meant to live apart from one another.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, of course, the ideology of lockdown</p>
<p>is to make people live apart, alone, isolated,</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t spread diseases to each other, right?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not actually designed as a species</p>
<p>to live that way.</p>
<p>And that, what you&rsquo;re describing, I think,</p>
<p>if everyone&rsquo;s honest with themselves, have felt,</p>
<p>especially in places where lockdowns have been</p>
<p>sort of very militantly enforced,</p>
<p>has felt deep into their core.</p>
<p>Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths.</p>
<p>You said that the data isn&rsquo;t perfect,</p>
<p>because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys</p>
<p>to understand how many cases there were</p>
<p>to determine the rate of deaths.</p>
<p>And we need to have a strong footing</p>
<p>in the number of deaths.</p>
<p>But if we assume that the number of deaths</p>
<p>is approximately correct, like what&rsquo;s your sense,</p>
<p>what kind of statements can we say about the deadliness</p>
<p>of COVID across different demographics?</p>
<p>Maybe not in a political way or in the current way,</p>
<p>but when history looks back at this moment of time,</p>
<p>50 years from now, 100 years from now,</p>
<p>the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,</p>
<p>what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?</p>
<p>I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID depends on</p>
<p>not just the virus itself, but who it infects.</p>
<p>So probably the most important thing about it,</p>
<p>about the deadliness of COVID,</p>
<p>is this steep age gradient in the mortality rate.</p>
<p>So according to these seroprevalence studies</p>
<p>that have been done, now hundreds of them,</p>
<p>mostly from before vaccination,</p>
<p>because vaccination also reduces</p>
<p>the mortality risk of COVID,</p>
<p>the seroprevalence studies suggest that the risk of death,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re, say, over the age of 70, is very high.</p>
<p>You know, 5% if you get COVID.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re under the age of 70, it&rsquo;s lower, 0.05.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not a single sharp cutoff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re 50, say, the infection fatality rate</p>
<p>from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data.</p>
<p>That means 99.8% survival if you&rsquo;re 50.</p>
<p>And for every seven years of age above that, double it.</p>
<p>Every seven years of age below that, halve it.</p>
<p>So a 57 year old would have a 0.4%.</p>
<p>Mortality, a 64 year old would have a 0.8% and so on.</p>
<p>And if you have a severe chronic disease,</p>
<p>like diabetes or if you&rsquo;re morbidly obese,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like adding seven years to your life.</p>
<p>And this is for unvaccinated folks?</p>
<p>This is unvaccinated before Delta also.</p>
<p>Are there a lot of people that would be listening to this</p>
<p>with PhDs at the end of their name</p>
<p>that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some disagreement over this.</p>
<p>And the disagreement is about the quality</p>
<p>of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.</p>
<p>So as I said earlier, I was the senior investigator</p>
<p>in three different seroprevalence studies</p>
<p>very early in the epidemic.</p>
<p>I view them as very high quality studies.</p>
<p>In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit</p>
<p>that we obtained from someone who works</p>
<p>in major league baseball, actually.</p>
<p>He had ordered these test kits very early in March, 2020,</p>
<p>that measures, very accurately measures antibody levels,</p>
<p>antibodies in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>These test kits were eventually were approved by the,</p>
<p>had an EUA by the emergency use authorization by the FDA,</p>
<p>sort of shortly after we did this.</p>
<p>And it had a very low false positive rate,</p>
<p>false positive means if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>the kit shows up positive anyways.</p>
<p>That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.</p>
<p>And based on studies, a very large number of studies</p>
<p>looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit,</p>
<p>and 0.5% of the time, 2018,</p>
<p>there shouldn&rsquo;t be antibodies there to COVID.</p>
<p>So if it turns positive to false positives, 0.5% of the time.</p>
<p>And then like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%,</p>
<p>something like that, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact number,</p>
<p>but the false positive rate is the important thing there.</p>
<p>So you have a population in March, 2020 or April, 2020,</p>
<p>with very low fraction of patients</p>
<p>having been exposed to COVID,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how much, but low,</p>
<p>even a small false positive rate</p>
<p>could end up biasing your study quite a bit.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a formula to adjust for that.</p>
<p>You can adjust for the false positive rate,</p>
<p>false negative rate.</p>
<p>We did that adjustment, and those studies found</p>
<p>in a community population,</p>
<p>so leaving aside people in nursing homes</p>
<p>who have a higher death rate from COVID,</p>
<p>the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County</p>
<p>and in LA County.</p>
<p>Across all age groups in a community,</p>
<p>community meaning just like regular folks.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s actually a real important question too.</p>
<p>So the Santa Clara study,</p>
<p>we did this Facebook sampling scheme,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,</p>
<p>but it was very difficult to get a random sample</p>
<p>and during lockdown,</p>
<p>where we put out an ad on Facebook</p>
<p>soliciting people to volunteer for the study,</p>
<p>randomly selected set of people.</p>
<p>We were hoping to get a random selection of people</p>
<p>from Santa Clara County, but it tended to,</p>
<p>the people who tend to volunteer</p>
<p>were from the richer parts of the county.</p>
<p>Like I had Stanford professors writing,</p>
<p>begging to be in the study</p>
<p>because they wanted to know their antibody levels.</p>
<p>So we did some adjustment for that.</p>
<p>In LA County, we hired a firm</p>
<p>that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t include nursing homes,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t include people in jail, things like that,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t include the homeless populations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s representative of a community dwelling population,</p>
<p>both of those.</p>
<p>And there we found that both in LA County</p>
<p>and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,</p>
<p>something like 40 to 50 times more infections</p>
<p>than cases in both places.</p>
<p>So for every case that had been reported</p>
<p>to the public health authorities,</p>
<p>we found 40 or 50 other infections,</p>
<p>people with antibodies in their blood</p>
<p>that suggested that they&rsquo;d had COVID and recovered.</p>
<p>So people were not reporting,</p>
<p>or severe, at least in those days, underreporting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there was testing problem.</p>
<p>I mean, there weren&rsquo;t so many tests available.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A lot of them, we asked a set of questions</p>
<p>about the symptoms they&rsquo;d faced,</p>
<p>and most of them said they&rsquo;d faced no symptoms,</p>
<p>or at the most, 30, 40% of them said</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d faced no symptoms.</p>
<p>And I mean, even these days,</p>
<p>how many people report that they get COVID</p>
<p>when they get COVID?</p>
<p>Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%,</p>
<p>has that approximately held up over time?</p>
<p>That is, so Professor John Ioannidis,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>is a world expert in meta now,</p>
<p>so probably the most cited scientist on Earth, I think,</p>
<p>at least living.</p>
<p>He did a meta analysis of now 100 or more</p>
<p>of these seroprevalence studies.</p>
<p>And what he found was that that 0.2%</p>
<p>is roughly the worldwide number.</p>
<p>In fact, I think he cites this lower number, 0.15%,</p>
<p>as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.</p>
<p>So we did these studies,</p>
<p>and it generated an enormous amount of blowback</p>
<p>by people who thought that the infection fatality rate</p>
<p>is much higher.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some controversy over the quality</p>
<p>of some of the other studies that are done.</p>
<p>And so there are some people who look at this</p>
<p>same literature and say, well,</p>
<p>the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs.</p>
<p>The higher quality studies.</p>
<p>IFR?</p>
<p>Oh, infection fatality rate, I apologize.</p>
<p>I do this in lectures, too, I apologize.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to rudely interrupt you</p>
<p>and ask for the basics sometimes, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>No, of course.</p>
<p>So these higher quality studies, they say,</p>
<p>tend to produce higher IFR.</p>
<p>But the problem is that if you want</p>
<p>a global infection fatality rate,</p>
<p>you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere,</p>
<p>even in places that don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have the infrastructure set up</p>
<p>to produce very, very high quality studies.</p>
<p>And in poor places in the world,</p>
<p>places like Africa,</p>
<p>the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.</p>
<p>And in some richer places, like New York City,</p>
<p>the infection fatality rate is much higher.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a range of IFRs, not a single number.</p>
<p>This sometimes surprises people,</p>
<p>because they think, well, it&rsquo;s a virus,</p>
<p>it should have the same properties no matter where it goes.</p>
<p>But the virus kills or infects or hurts</p>
<p>in interaction with the host.</p>
<p>And the properties of both the host and the virus</p>
<p>combine to produce the outcome.</p>
<p>But you also mentioned the environment, too?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m thinking mainly just about the person.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m gonna think about it,</p>
<p>the most simplest way to think about it is age.</p>
<p>Age is the single most important risk factor.</p>
<p>So older places are going to have a higher IFR</p>
<p>than younger places.</p>
<p>Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.</p>
<p>So in some sense, it&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>that they have a low infection fatality rate.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way you would explain</p>
<p>the difference between Africa and New York City</p>
<p>in terms of the fatality rate, is the age, the average age?</p>
<p>Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic</p>
<p>in New York City, the older populations</p>
<p>living in nursing homes were differentially infected</p>
<p>based on, because of policies that were adopted,</p>
<p>to send COVID infected patients back to nursing homes</p>
<p>to keep hospitals empty.</p>
<p>What do you mean by differentially infected?</p>
<p>The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by different.</p>
<p>The policy, it&rsquo;s the person that matters.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like the virus just kind of doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, I mean, there is some contribution</p>
<p>from the environment, different regions</p>
<p>have different proximity maybe of people interacting</p>
<p>or the dynamics of the way they interact.</p>
<p>Yeah, like if you have situations</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s lots of intergenerational interactions,</p>
<p>then you have a very different risk profile</p>
<p>than if you have societies</p>
<p>that are where generations are more separate</p>
<p>from one another.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this.</p>
<p>So you have in New York, you have a population</p>
<p>that was infected in the early days</p>
<p>that was very likely going to die,</p>
<p>had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.</p>
<p>And so New York City had a higher IFR,</p>
<p>especially in the early days than like Africa has had.</p>
<p>The other thing is treatment, right?</p>
<p>So the treatments that we adopted</p>
<p>in the early days of the epidemic,</p>
<p>I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.</p>
<p>Which treatments?</p>
<p>Using ventilators, like the over reliance on ventilators</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m primarily thinking of,</p>
<p>but I can think of other things.</p>
<p>But that also we&rsquo;ve learned over time</p>
<p>how better to manage patients with the disease.</p>
<p>So you have all those things combined.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the controversy over this number is.</p>
<p>I mean, New York City also is a central hub</p>
<p>for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories</p>
<p>and narratives in article form.</p>
<p>And I remember those quite dramatic stories</p>
<p>about sort of doctors in the hospitals</p>
<p>and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s very serious, very dramatic,</p>
<p>very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals.</p>
<p>Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always tragic.</p>
<p>And you can always write a hell of a good story about that.</p>
<p>And you should, about the loss of loved ones.</p>
<p>But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,</p>
<p>over this kind of dramatic deaths.</p>
<p>And so in response to that, it&rsquo;s very unpleasant to hear,</p>
<p>even to consider the possibility</p>
<p>that the death rate is not as high as you might feel.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,</p>
<p>both by regular people and also the scientific community</p>
<p>in response to those studies,</p>
<p>those early studies in April of 2020.</p>
<p>To me, they were studies.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re the kinds of,</p>
<p>not exactly the kinds of work I&rsquo;ve worked on all my life,</p>
<p>but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper</p>
<p>and you get responses from your fellow scientists</p>
<p>and you change the paper to improve it,</p>
<p>you hopefully learn something from it.</p>
<p>Well, but to push back, it&rsquo;s just a study.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some studies, and this is kind of interesting,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve received similar pushback on other topics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some studies that, if wrong,</p>
<p>might have wide ranging detrimental effects on society.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way they would perceive the studies.</p>
<p>If you say the death rate is lower,</p>
<p>and you end up, as you often do in science,</p>
<p>realizing that, nope, that was a flaw</p>
<p>in the way the study was conducted,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just not representative of a broader population,</p>
<p>and then you realize the death rate is much higher,</p>
<p>that might be very damaging in people&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably where the scientific community</p>
<p>sort of just steel man the kind of response,</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s where they felt like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some findings where you better be damn sure</p>
<p>before you kind of report them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right,</p>
<p>and it turns out we were right.</p>
<p>So we released the Santa Clara study</p>
<p>via this open science process</p>
<p>and this server called MedArchive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed for releasing studies</p>
<p>that have not yet been peer reviewed</p>
<p>in order to garner comment from the scientists</p>
<p>before peer review.</p>
<p>The LA County study,</p>
<p>we went through this traditional peer review process</p>
<p>and got it published in the Journal</p>
<p>of American Medical Association sometime in like July,</p>
<p>I think, I forget the date, of 2020.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020</p>
<p>in this sort of working paper archive.</p>
<p>The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,</p>
<p>we had a result that we thought was quite important,</p>
<p>and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it</p>
<p>and also tell the world about it.</p>
<p>And we wanted to get feedback.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the purpose</p>
<p>of sending it to these kinds of places.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the problem is that</p>
<p>when people think about published science,</p>
<p>they think of it as automatically true.</p>
<p>And if it goes through peer review,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s automatically true.</p>
<p>If it hasn&rsquo;t gone through peer review,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not automatically true.</p>
<p>And especially in medicine,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not used to having this access</p>
<p>to pre peer reviewed work.</p>
<p>I mean, in economics, actually, that&rsquo;s quite normal.</p>
<p>You takes years to get something published.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very active debate over</p>
<p>or discussion about papers before they&rsquo;re peer reviewed</p>
<p>in this sort of working paper way,</p>
<p>much less normal or much newer in medicine.</p>
<p>And so I think part of that,</p>
<p>the perception about what process happens in open science</p>
<p>when you release a study, that got people confused.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, it was a very important result</p>
<p>because we had just locked the world down</p>
<p>in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results.</p>
<p>And if that study was right, if our study was right,</p>
<p>that meant we&rsquo;d made a mistake.</p>
<p>And not because the death rate was low,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually not the key thing there.</p>
<p>The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,</p>
<p>these test and trace policies,</p>
<p>these policies, these lockdown policies</p>
<p>aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero.</p>
<p>That was essentially the idea.</p>
<p>If we can just get the virus to go away,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t have to ever worry about it again.</p>
<p>The main problem with our result</p>
<p>as far as that strategy was concerned wasn&rsquo;t the death rate,</p>
<p>it was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases.</p>
<p>It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate</p>
<p>that we identified of the antibodies in the population.</p>
<p>If that number is right, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>The virus is not going to go to zero.</p>
<p>And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to get the viral level down to zero.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have to let the virus</p>
<p>go through the entire population in some way or some other?</p>
<p>We can talk about that in a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Great Barrington Declaration.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to let the virus go through the population.</p>
<p>You can shield preferentially.</p>
<p>The policy we chose was to shield preferentially</p>
<p>the laptop class,</p>
<p>the set of people who could work from home</p>
<p>without losing their job.</p>
<p>And we did a very good job at protecting them.</p>
<p>Well, let me take a small tangent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna jump around in time,</p>
<p>which I think will be the best way to tell the story.</p>
<p>So that was the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, actually, can I go back one more thing for that?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>and I should have started with this.</p>
<p>What led me to do those studies was a paper</p>
<p>that I had remembered seeing</p>
<p>from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.</p>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ve been much less active</p>
<p>in writing about that.</p>
<p>I had written like a paper or two about that in 2009.</p>
<p>There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate,</p>
<p>except it unfolded over the course of three years,</p>
<p>two or three years.</p>
<p>The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1</p>
<p>counted the number of cases in the denominator,</p>
<p>counted the number of deaths in the numerator,</p>
<p>cases meaning people identified as having H1N1,</p>
<p>showing up the doctor, tested to have it.</p>
<p>And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality</p>
<p>were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of more years,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,</p>
<p>seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out.</p>
<p>And it turned out that there were 100 or more times</p>
<p>people infected per case.</p>
<p>And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02%</p>
<p>for H1N1, not the three, like 100 fold difference.</p>
<p>So this made you think, okay,</p>
<p>it took us a couple of two or three years</p>
<p>to discover the truth behind the actual infections</p>
<p>for H1N1, and then what&rsquo;s the truth here</p>
<p>and can we get there faster?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way as the H1N1 flu did.</p>
<p>I mean, it spreads via solization,</p>
<p>via person to person breathing, kind of contact up.</p>
<p>It may be some by fomites, but it seems less likely now.</p>
<p>In any case, it seemed really important to me</p>
<p>to speed up the process</p>
<p>of having those seroprevalence studies</p>
<p>so that we can better understand who was at risk</p>
<p>and what the right strategy ought to be.</p>
<p>This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza,</p>
<p>the flu, and COVID in the context of the discussion</p>
<p>we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?</p>
<p>So you mentioned COVID is a very particular</p>
<p>kind of steepness, where the X axis is age.</p>
<p>So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza</p>
<p>and COVID, because a lot of people outside the folks</p>
<p>who suggest that the lizards who run the world</p>
<p>have completely fabricated and invented COVID,</p>
<p>outside of those folks, kind of the natural process</p>
<p>by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is, say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s just like the flu.</p>
<p>The flu is a very serious thing, actually.</p>
<p>So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?</p>
<p>Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.</p>
<p>It kills 50, 60,000 people a year,</p>
<p>something I found out,</p>
<p>depending on the particular strain that goes around,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the United States.</p>
<p>The primary difference to me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of differences,</p>
<p>but one of the most salient differences</p>
<p>is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.</p>
<p>So the flu is more deadly to children than COVID is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no controversy about that.</p>
<p>Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions</p>
<p>to COVID infection than they do to flu infections.</p>
<p>And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Rate of fatality, all of that.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to maybe also comment on,</p>
<p>I think in another conversation you mentioned</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a U shape to the flu curve,</p>
<p>so meaning there&rsquo;s actually quite a large number of kids</p>
<p>that die from flu.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu,</p>
<p>the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.</p>
<p>And that is not the case with COVID.</p>
<p>More than, I&rsquo;m gonna get the number wrong,</p>
<p>but something like 70, 80% of the deaths</p>
<p>are people over the age of 60.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve talked about the fear the whole time, really.</p>
<p>But my interaction with folks,</p>
<p>now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have that real firsthand experience,</p>
<p>but my interaction with folks is at the core of fear</p>
<p>that folks had is for their children.</p>
<p>Like that somehow I don&rsquo;t wanna get infected</p>
<p>because of the kids.</p>
<p>Because God forbid something happens to the kids.</p>
<p>And I think that obviously that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>this kind of the kids come first no matter what,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one priority.</p>
<p>But for this particular virus,</p>
<p>that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like,</p>
<p>or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.</p>
<p>But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu</p>
<p>just overall, and especially to older people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right, so.</p>
<p>The numbers, when the story is all said and done,</p>
<p>COVID would take many more lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, 0.2 sounds like a small number,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a small number worldwide.</p>
<p>What do you think that number will be</p>
<p>by the, you know, that&rsquo;s not like me,</p>
<p>but would we cross, I think it&rsquo;s in the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way the deaths are currently reported,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 800,000, something like that.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll cross a million?</p>
<p>Seems likely, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s something that might continue</p>
<p>with different variants, what?</p>
<p>Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID.</p>
<p>The end state of COVID is it&rsquo;s here forever.</p>
<p>I think that there is good evidence of immunity</p>
<p>after infection, such that you&rsquo;re protected</p>
<p>both against reinfection and also against</p>
<p>severe disease upon reinfection.</p>
<p>So the second time you get it, it&rsquo;s not true for everyone,</p>
<p>but for many people, the second time you get it</p>
<p>will be milder, much milder than the first time you get it.</p>
<p>With the long tail, like that lasts for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just, there are studies that follow, of course,</p>
<p>people who are infected for a year,</p>
<p>and the reinfection rate is something like</p>
<p>somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.</p>
<p>And like a pretty fantastic study out in Italy</p>
<p>has found that, there&rsquo;s one in Sweden, I think,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few studies that have found similar things.</p>
<p>And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,</p>
<p>much less likely to end up in the hospital,</p>
<p>much less likely to die.</p>
<p>So what the end state of COVID is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s circulating the population forever</p>
<p>and you get it multiple times.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then there&rsquo;s, I think, studies and discussions</p>
<p>like the best protection would be to get it</p>
<p>and then also to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people push back against that</p>
<p>for the obvious reasons from both sides,</p>
<p>because somehow the discourse has become</p>
<p>less scientific and more political.</p>
<p>Well, I think you wanna, the first time you meet it</p>
<p>is gonna be the most deadly for you.</p>
<p>And so the first time you meet it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just wise to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The vaccine reduces severe disease.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll talk about the vaccine,</p>
<p>because I wanna make sure I address it carefully</p>
<p>and properly and in full context.</p>
<p>But yes, sort of to add to the context,</p>
<p>a lot of the fascinating discussions we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>is in the early days of COVID</p>
<p>and now for people who are unvaccinated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the interesting story is.</p>
<p>The policy story, the sociological story and so on.</p>
<p>But let me go to something really fascinating</p>
<p>just because of the people involved,</p>
<p>the human beings involved,</p>
<p>and because of how deeply I care about science</p>
<p>and also kindness, respect and love and human things.</p>
<p>Francis Collins wrote a letter in October 2020</p>
<p>to Anthony Fauci and I think somebody else.</p>
<p>I have the letter, oh, it&rsquo;s not a letter, email, I apologize.</p>
<p>Hi, Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.</p>
<p>This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a coauthor on.</p>
<p>This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists</p>
<p>who met with the secretary</p>
<p>seem to be getting a lot of attention</p>
<p>and even a co signature from Nobel Prize winner,</p>
<p>Mike Levitt at Stanford.</p>
<p>There needs to be a quick and devastating</p>
<p>published take down of its premises.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything like that online yet.</p>
<p>Is it underway, question mark, Francis.</p>
<p>Francis Collins, director of the NIH,</p>
<p>somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.</p>
<p>Okay, a million questions I wanna ask.</p>
<p>But first, how did that make you feel</p>
<p>when you first saw this email come to light,</p>
<p>when did it come to light?</p>
<p>This week, actually, I think, or last week.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is because of freedom of information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, sort of maybe,</p>
<p>because I do wanna add positive stuff</p>
<p>on the side of Francis here.</p>
<p>Boy, when I see stuff like that,</p>
<p>I wonder if all my emails leaked, how much embarrassing stuff.</p>
<p>Like, I think I&rsquo;m a good person,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t read my old emails.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;m pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, he&rsquo;s a Christian,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a Christian, I&rsquo;m supposed to forgive, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think he was looking at this</p>
<p>Great Barrington Declaration as a political problem</p>
<p>to be solved, as opposed to a serious</p>
<p>alternative approach to the epidemic.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about it in more detail,</p>
<p>but just in case people are not familiar,</p>
<p>Great Barrington Declaration was a document</p>
<p>that you coauthored that basically argues</p>
<p>against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID,</p>
<p>and you propose another solution that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>But the point is, it&rsquo;s not that dramatic of a document,</p>
<p>it is just a document that criticizes</p>
<p>one policy solution that was proposed.</p>
<p>But it was the policy solution that had been put forward</p>
<p>by Dr. Collins and by Tony Fauci,</p>
<p>and a few other science, I mean, I think a relatively</p>
<p>small number of scientists and epidemiologists</p>
<p>in charge of the advice given to governments worldwide.</p>
<p>And it was a challenge to that policy</p>
<p>that said that, look, there is an alternate path,</p>
<p>that the path we&rsquo;ve chosen, this path of lockdown</p>
<p>with the aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,</p>
<p>I mean, that was unstated.</p>
<p>Cannot work and is causing catastrophic harm</p>
<p>to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.</p>
<p>We put this out in October 4th, I think, of 2020,</p>
<p>and it went viral.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never actually been involved</p>
<p>with anything like this,</p>
<p>where I just put the document on the web,</p>
<p>and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.</p>
<p>It really struck a chord of people,</p>
<p>because I think even by October of 2020,</p>
<p>people had this sense that there was something really wrong</p>
<p>with the COVID policy that we&rsquo;ve been following.</p>
<p>And they were looking for reasonable people</p>
<p>to give an alternative.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not arguing that COVID isn&rsquo;t a serious thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a very serious thing.</p>
<p>This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.</p>
<p>But we were saying that the policy we&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>is not the right one.</p>
<p>So how does a democratic government deal with that challenge?</p>
<p>So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.</p>
<p>I was actually, frankly, just,</p>
<p>I suspected there&rsquo;d been some email exchanges like that,</p>
<p>not necessarily from Francis Collins,</p>
<p>around the government around this time.</p>
<p>I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign</p>
<p>almost immediately after we published it,</p>
<p>where newspapers mischaracterized it</p>
<p>in the same way over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and sought to characterize me</p>
<p>as sort of a marginal fringe figure or whatnot.</p>
<p>Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kulldorff,</p>
<p>or the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.</p>
<p>I felt the brunt of that all year long.</p>
<p>So to see this in black and white,</p>
<p>in the handwriting, essentially,</p>
<p>I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins</p>
<p>was actually, frankly, a disappointment,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve looked up to him for years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve looked up to him as well.</p>
<p>I mean, I look for the best in people,</p>
<p>and I still look up to him.</p>
<p>What troubles me is several things.</p>
<p>The reason I said about the asshole emails</p>
<p>I send late at night is I can understand this email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fear, it&rsquo;s panic, not being sure.</p>
<p>The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.</p>
<p>Plus Mike Leavitt, who won a Nobel Prize, I mean.</p>
<p>But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,</p>
<p>I have said things like that about others,</p>
<p>like a little bit too unkind.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t really mean it.</p>
<p>Now, add to that, he recently, this week,</p>
<p>whatever, doubled down on the fringe.</p>
<p>This is really troubling to me,</p>
<p>that I can excuse this email,</p>
<p>but the arrogance there, Francis, honestly,</p>
<p>I mean, broke my heart a little bit there.</p>
<p>This was an opportunity to, especially at this stage,</p>
<p>to say, just like I told him,</p>
<p>to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.</p>
<p>I was wrong to not be open to ideas.</p>
<p>I still believe that this is not,</p>
<p>like, say, like, actually argue with the proposal,</p>
<p>with the policy, the proposed solution.</p>
<p>Also, the devastating published,</p>
<p>devastating takedown, devastating takedown.</p>
<p>As you say, somebody who&rsquo;s sitting on billions of dollars</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re giving to scientists,</p>
<p>some of whom are often not their best human beings</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re fighting with each other over money,</p>
<p>not being cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re challenging the integrity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re corrupting the integrity of scientists</p>
<p>by allocating them money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now playing with that</p>
<p>by saying devastating takedown.</p>
<p>Where do you think the published takedown will come from?</p>
<p>It will come from those scientists</p>
<p>to whom you&rsquo;re giving money.</p>
<p>What kind of example would they give</p>
<p>to the academic community that thrives on freedom?</p>
<p>Like, this is, I believe Francis Collins is a great man.</p>
<p>One of the things I was troubled by</p>
<p>is the negative response to him</p>
<p>from people that don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the positive impact that NIH has had on society,</p>
<p>how many people it&rsquo;s helped.</p>
<p>But this is exactly the, so he&rsquo;s not just a scientist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a scientific leader</p>
<p>that in difficult times we live in,</p>
<p>is supposed to inspire us with trust,</p>
<p>with love, with the freedom of thought.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?</p>
<p>Those are the heroes of science.</p>
<p>When you look at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>we love those people.</p>
<p>We love ideas, even when they get proven wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what always attracted me to science.</p>
<p>Like somebody, the lone voice saying,</p>
<p>oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is,</p>
<p>Galileo was saying something truly revolutionary.</p>
<p>We were saying that what we proposed</p>
<p>in the Great Barbarian Declaration</p>
<p>was actually just the old pandemic plan.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t anything really fundamentally novel.</p>
<p>In fact, there were plans like this</p>
<p>that lockdown scientists had written</p>
<p>in late February, early March of 2020.</p>
<p>So we were not saying anything radical.</p>
<p>We were just calling for a debate effectively</p>
<p>over the existing lockdown policy.</p>
<p>And this is a disappointment,</p>
<p>a really, truly a big disappointment</p>
<p>because by doing this, you were absolutely right, Lex.</p>
<p>He sent a signal to so many other scientists</p>
<p>to just stay silent, even if you had reservations.</p>
<p>Yeah, devastating take down that people,</p>
<p>you know how many people wrote to me privately,</p>
<p>like Stanford, MIT,</p>
<p>how amazing the conversation with Francis Collins was?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of admiration because,</p>
<p>okay, how do I put it?</p>
<p>A lot of people get into science</p>
<p>because they wanna help the world.</p>
<p>They get excited by the ideas</p>
<p>and they really are working hard to help</p>
<p>in whatever the discipline is.</p>
<p>And then there is sources of funding</p>
<p>which help you do help at a larger scale.</p>
<p>So you admire the people that are distributing the money</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often, at least on the surface,</p>
<p>are really also good people.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re great scientists.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sort of,</p>
<p>like sometimes people from outside</p>
<p>think academia is broken some kind of way.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It really is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so deeply heartbreaking</p>
<p>where this person is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is malevolence.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s just incompetence of communication twice.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also arrogance at the bottom of it too.</p>
<p>But all of us have arrogance at the bottom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular kind of arrogance.</p>
<p>So here it&rsquo;s of the same kind of arrogance</p>
<p>that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV</p>
<p>and says that if you criticize me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not simply criticizing a man,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re criticizing science itself.</p>
<p>That is at the heart also of this email.</p>
<p>The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,</p>
<p>Collins and Fauci were recommending</p>
<p>to the president of the United States were right.</p>
<p>Not just right, but right so far right</p>
<p>that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.</p>
<p>And I think that is really the heart of that email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that my position is unchallengeable.</p>
<p>Now to be completely, to be as charitable as I can be</p>
<p>to this, I believe they thought that.</p>
<p>I believe some of them still think that,</p>
<p>that there was only one true policy possible</p>
<p>in response to COVID.</p>
<p>Every other policy was immoral.</p>
<p>And if you come from that position,</p>
<p>then you write an email like that.</p>
<p>You go on TV, you say effectively la science est moi, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that is what happens</p>
<p>when you have this sort of unchallengeable arrogance</p>
<p>that the policy you&rsquo;re following is correct.</p>
<p>I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,</p>
<p>what I was hoping for was a discussion</p>
<p>about how to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>I mean, that was the key idea to me in the whole thing</p>
<p>was better protection of the older population</p>
<p>who were really at really serious risk</p>
<p>if infected with COVID.</p>
<p>And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,</p>
<p>to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.</p>
<p>And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health</p>
<p>about better methods, better policies</p>
<p>to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So when we were met with instead a series</p>
<p>of essentially propagandist lies about it.</p>
<p>So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters in those days,</p>
<p>why do you want to let the virus rip?</p>
<p>Let it rip, let it rip.</p>
<p>The words let it rip does not appear</p>
<p>in the Great Bank Declaration.</p>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to let the virus rip.</p>
<p>The goal is to protect the vulnerable,</p>
<p>to let society go open schools and do other things</p>
<p>that function as best it can</p>
<p>in the midst of a terrible pandemic, yes,</p>
<p>but not let the virus rip</p>
<p>where the most vulnerable aren&rsquo;t protected.</p>
<p>The goal was to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So why let it rip?</p>
<p>Because it was a propaganda term</p>
<p>to hit the fear centers of people&rsquo;s brains.</p>
<p>Oh, these people are immoral.</p>
<p>They just want to let the virus go through society</p>
<p>and hurt everybody.</p>
<p>That was the idea.</p>
<p>It was a way to preclude a discussion</p>
<p>and preclude a debate about the existing policy.</p>
<p>So this is an app called Clubhouse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone back on it recently to practice Russian,</p>
<p>unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a great way</p>
<p>to talk to regular people in Russian.</p>
<p>But I also, I was nervous.</p>
<p>I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation</p>
<p>and there was a vaccine room and so I joined it.</p>
<p>And it was a pro science room.</p>
<p>These are like scientists</p>
<p>that were calling each other pro science.</p>
<p>The whole thing was like theater to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t thoroughly researched,</p>
<p>but looking at the resume,</p>
<p>they were like pretty solid researchers and doctors.</p>
<p>And they were mocking everybody who was at all,</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they stood for,</p>
<p>but they were just mocking people</p>
<p>and the arrogance was overwhelming.</p>
<p>I had to shut off because I couldn&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>that human beings can be like this to each other.</p>
<p>And then I went back just to double check,</p>
<p>is this really happening?</p>
<p>How many people are here?</p>
<p>Is this theater?</p>
<p>And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse</p>
<p>to make a couple of comments.</p>
<p>And then as I opened my mouth, I said, thank you so much.</p>
<p>This is a great room, sort of the usual civil politeness,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m worried that the kind of arrogance</p>
<p>with which things are being discussed here</p>
<p>will further divide us, not unite us.</p>
<p>And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,</p>
<p>I was thrown off stage.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t why I mentioned platform,</p>
<p>but like I am like Lex Friedman, MIT,</p>
<p>also, which is something those people seem</p>
<p>to sometimes care about, followers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Like, did you just do that?</p>
<p>And then they said, enough of that nonsense.</p>
<p>Enough of that nonsense.</p>
<p>They said to me, enough of that nonsense.</p>
<p>Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins,</p>
<p>is the Pfizer CEO.</p>
<p>To bring you on, French epidemiologist also, so just.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But this broke my heart, the arrogance.</p>
<p>And this is, echoes of that arrogance</p>
<p>is something you see in this email.</p>
<p>And I really would love to have a million things</p>
<p>to talk about to try to figure out</p>
<p>how can we find a path forward?</p>
<p>I think a lot of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in the discussion over COVID,</p>
<p>and especially in the scientific community,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two ways to look at science, I think,</p>
<p>that have been competing with each other for a while now.</p>
<p>One way, and this is the way that I view science</p>
<p>and why I&rsquo;ve always found it so attractive,</p>
<p>is an invitation to a structured discussion</p>
<p>where the discussion is tempered by evidence,</p>
<p>by data, by reasoning and logic, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a dialectical process where if I believe A</p>
<p>and you believe B, well, we talk about it.</p>
<p>We come up with an experiment</p>
<p>that distinguishes between the two.</p>
<p>And while B turns out to be right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all frustrated, but I buy you dinner</p>
<p>and I say, no, no, no, no, C.</p>
<p>And then we go on from there, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what science is at its best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this process of using data in discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human activity, right?</p>
<p>To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s another way</p>
<p>that people have used science or thought about science</p>
<p>as truth in and of itself, right?</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s science, therefore it&rsquo;s true automatically.</p>
<p>And what does the science say to do?</p>
<p>Well, the science never says to do anything.</p>
<p>The science says, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then we have to apply our human values to say,</p>
<p>okay, well, if we do this, then this is likely to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the science says.</p>
<p>If we do that, then that is likely to happen.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;d rather have this than that, right?</p>
<p>But science doesn&rsquo;t tell us</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d rather have this than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our human values that tell us</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d rather have this than that.</p>
<p>Science plays a role, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only role.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it helps understand the constraints we face,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us what to do</p>
<p>in face of those constraints.</p>
<p>But underneath it, at the individual level,</p>
<p>at the institutional level,</p>
<p>it seems like arrogance is really destructive.</p>
<p>So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.</p>
<p>So sort of always not being sure that you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>This is actually kind of,</p>
<p>Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.</p>
<p>How do you make sure that AI,</p>
<p>super intelligent AI doesn&rsquo;t destroy us?</p>
<p>You built in a sort of module within it</p>
<p>that it always doubts its actions.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not sure.</p>
<p>Like, I know it says I&rsquo;m supposed to destroy all humans,</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>And that maybe I&rsquo;m wrong is essential for progress,</p>
<p>for actually doing in the long arc of history better,</p>
<p>not the perfect thing,</p>
<p>but better and better and better and better.</p>
<p>I mean, the question I have here for you is this,</p>
<p>this email so clearly captures some maybe echo,</p>
<p>but maybe a core to the problem.</p>
<p>Do you put responsibility of this email,</p>
<p>of the shortcomings and failures</p>
<p>on individuals or institutions?</p>
<p>Is this Francis Collins, Anthony?</p>
<p>No, this is an institutional failure, right?</p>
<p>So the NIH, so I&rsquo;ve had two decades of NIH funding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat on NIH review panels.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.</p>
<p>To some extent, it&rsquo;s also to help scientists,</p>
<p>to direct scientists to work on things</p>
<p>that are very important for public health</p>
<p>or for the health of the public.</p>
<p>So, and the way you do that is you say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna put $50 million</p>
<p>on the research in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease this year</p>
<p>or $70 million on HIV or whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>And that pot of money then scientists compete</p>
<p>with each other for the best ideas to use it</p>
<p>to address that problem.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially an endeavor</p>
<p>to support the work of scientists.</p>
<p>It is not in and of itself a policy organ.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say what public health policy should be.</p>
<p>For that, you have the CDC and what happened</p>
<p>during the pandemic is that people in the NIH</p>
<p>were called upon to contribute</p>
<p>to public health policymaking.</p>
<p>And that created the conflict of interest</p>
<p>you see in that email, right?</p>
<p>So now you have the head of the NIH in effect saying</p>
<p>to all scientists, you must agree with me</p>
<p>in the policy that I&rsquo;ve recommended</p>
<p>or else you&rsquo;re a fringe.</p>
<p>That is a deep conflict of interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deep because first he&rsquo;s conflicted.</p>
<p>He has this dual role as the head of the NIH,</p>
<p>supporter of scientific funding</p>
<p>and then also inappropriately called</p>
<p>to set or help set pandemic policy.</p>
<p>That should never have happened.</p>
<p>There should be a bright line between those two roles.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.</p>
<p>I had a chance to talk to him on a podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you maybe by chance</p>
<p>gotten a chance to hear a few words.</p>
<p>I heard some of it, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I have kind of a question to that</p>
<p>because a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things</p>
<p>about Francis Collins and like I said,</p>
<p>I still believe he&rsquo;s a great man and a great scientist.</p>
<p>One of the things when I talked to him off mic</p>
<p>about the vaccine,</p>
<p>the excitement he had about when we were recollecting</p>
<p>when they first gotten an inkling</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually going to be possible to get a vaccine,</p>
<p>just he wasn&rsquo;t messaging,</p>
<p>just in the private or of our own conversation,</p>
<p>he was really excited and why was he excited?</p>
<p>Because he gets to help a lot of people.</p>
<p>This is a man that really wants to help people</p>
<p>and there could be some institutional self delusion,</p>
<p>the arrogance, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that lead to this kind of email.</p>
<p>But ultimately the goal is this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people quite realize this.</p>
<p>The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,</p>
<p>the reason there needs to be a devastating published</p>
<p>take down, he, I believe really believes</p>
<p>that it could be very dangerous</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders</p>
<p>because like you said, in his role</p>
<p>where he defines some of the public policy,</p>
<p>depending on how he thinks about the world,</p>
<p>millions of people could die</p>
<p>because of one decision he make.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of burden to walk with.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that he has bad intentions.</p>
<p>I think that he was basically put,</p>
<p>was put or maybe put himself in a position</p>
<p>where this kind of conflict of interest</p>
<p>was going to create this kind of reaction, right?</p>
<p>The kind of humility that you&rsquo;re calling for</p>
<p>is almost impossible when you have that dual role</p>
<p>that you shouldn&rsquo;t have as funder of science</p>
<p>and also setter of scientific policy.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you just said,</p>
<p>except the last part.</p>
<p>The humility is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Humility is always difficult.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge incentive</p>
<p>for humility in that position.</p>
<p>Now look at history.</p>
<p>Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.</p>
<p>So if you like being popular,</p>
<p>if you like having impact, legacy,</p>
<p>these descendants of ape seem to care about legacy,</p>
<p>especially as they get older in these high positions.</p>
<p>I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>that he has to be proud of in his career.</p>
<p>I mean, the Human Genome Project</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without him.</p>
<p>And he is a great man and a great scientist.</p>
<p>So it is tragic to me that his career</p>
<p>has ended in this particular way.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question</p>
<p>about my podcast conversation with him?</p>
<p>By way of advice or maybe criticism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that wrote to me</p>
<p>kind words of support and a lot of people</p>
<p>that wrote to me respectful, constructive criticism.</p>
<p>How would you suggest to have conversations</p>
<p>with folks like that?</p>
<p>And maybe, I mean,</p>
<p>because I have other conversations like this,</p>
<p>including I was debating whether to talk to Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk.</p>
<p>And so what kind of conversation do you have?</p>
<p>And sorry to take us on a tangent,</p>
<p>but almost from an interview perspective</p>
<p>of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science</p>
<p>or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna figure this out?</p>
<p>I mean, I think you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had been now interviewed by many people.</p>
<p>I think the style you have really works well, Lex.</p>
<p>You have to,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna be ever an attack dog</p>
<p>trying to go after somebody and force them to like,</p>
<p>sort of admit that they were wrong or whatever about,</p>
<p>I mean, I also actually find that form of journalism</p>
<p>and podcasting really off putting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to watch.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a whole other tangent.</p>
<p>Is that actually effective?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Do you wanna ask Hitler,</p>
<p>and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying a lot about the rise and fall</p>
<p>of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>I think about interviewing Stalin.</p>
<p>Like I put myself in that mindset,</p>
<p>like how do you have conversations with people</p>
<p>to understand who they are so that,</p>
<p>not so you can sit there and yell at them,</p>
<p>but to understand who they are</p>
<p>so that you can inspire a very large number of people</p>
<p>to be the best version of themselves</p>
<p>and to avoid the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone that&rsquo;s involved in this debate</p>
<p>has good intentions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming at it from their points of view.</p>
<p>They have their weaknesses.</p>
<p>And if you can paint a picture in your questioning</p>
<p>by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>and their point of view, you&rsquo;ve done a service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all I personally like to see</p>
<p>in those kinds of interviews.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.</p>
<p>The key thing is understanding where they&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>understanding their thinking,</p>
<p>understanding the constraints they faced</p>
<p>and how did they manage them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna provide a much,</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s what I look for</p>
<p>when I listen to podcasts like yours,</p>
<p>is an understanding of that person and the moment</p>
<p>and how they dealt with it.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way</p>
<p>a flaw in a person&rsquo;s thinking together.</p>
<p>Like as opposed to discovering the positive thing together,</p>
<p>you discover the thing, well,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s how science is, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we find it so attractive is this,</p>
<p>I like it when a student shows me I&rsquo;m thinking incorrectly.</p>
<p>Right, I&rsquo;m really grateful to that student</p>
<p>because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it</p>
<p>and then start thinking even more correctly.</p>
<p>I mean, and there are moments when,</p>
<p>I mean, like this is probably a good time to say</p>
<p>like what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right?</p>
<p>So like for instance, you said Francis Collins had a moment</p>
<p>when he learned that there was quite possible</p>
<p>to get a vaccine going.</p>
<p>He must&rsquo;ve learned that quite early.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t learn that early.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know, in March of 2020,</p>
<p>in my experience with vaccine development,</p>
<p>it would&rsquo;ve take, I thought it would take a decade or more</p>
<p>to get a vaccine.</p>
<p>That was wrong, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, and I was so happy</p>
<p>when I started to see the preliminary numbers</p>
<p>in the Pfizer trial that strongly suggested</p>
<p>it was going to work.</p>
<p>And I was, I mean, like very few times in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy to be wrong.</p>
<p>And it changes kind of, I think I&rsquo;ve heard you mention</p>
<p>that a lockdown is still a bad idea</p>
<p>unless the vaccine comes out in like tomorrow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still like suffering and economic pain,</p>
<p>all kinds of pain can still happen</p>
<p>in even just a scale of weeks versus months.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about the vaccine.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy</p>
<p>of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?</p>
<p>So for the vaccine safety data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually challenging to convey to the public</p>
<p>how this is normally done.</p>
<p>Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a long trial with large numbers,</p>
<p>relatively large numbers of people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d follow them over a long time</p>
<p>and the trial will give you some indication</p>
<p>of the safety of the vaccine.</p>
<p>And it did, I mean, but the trial,</p>
<p>the way it was constructed, when it came out</p>
<p>that it was protective against COVID,</p>
<p>it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.</p>
<p>And so that placebo arm was vaccinated, large part of it.</p>
<p>And so that meant that from the trial,</p>
<p>you were not going to be able to get data</p>
<p>on the longterm safety profiles of the vaccine.</p>
<p>And also the other thing about trials,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of people enrolled,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still not enough to get</p>
<p>when you deploy a vaccine at population scale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see things that weren&rsquo;t in the trial,</p>
<p>guaranteed, populations of people</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t represented well in the trial</p>
<p>are gonna be given the vaccine</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re gonna have things that happen to them</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when people were a little bit</p>
<p>skeptical when the trial was done about the safety profile,</p>
<p>just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it</p>
<p>so that it was gonna be hard to get a complete picture</p>
<p>from the trials itself.</p>
<p>And the trial showed they were pretty safe</p>
<p>and quite effective at preventing both you</p>
<p>from getting COVID,</p>
<p>like I said, I think the main endpoint of the trial itself</p>
<p>was a symptomatic COVID, right?</p>
<p>So that was like, that was, I mean, it was really to me,</p>
<p>like it was about as amazing achievement as anything,</p>
<p>organizing a trial of that scale and running it so quickly.</p>
<p>And the final results being so surprisingly high.</p>
<p>So good, right?</p>
<p>And so, but the problem then was,</p>
<p>normally it would take a long time,</p>
<p>the FDA would tell Pfizer to go back</p>
<p>and try it in this subgroup,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d work more on dosing,</p>
<p>they do all these kinds of things</p>
<p>that kind of didn&rsquo;t, we really didn&rsquo;t have time for</p>
<p>in the middle of the pandemic, right?</p>
<p>So you have a basis for approval that it&rsquo;s less full</p>
<p>than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine.</p>
<p>But the results were good, the results looked really good.</p>
<p>And actually, I should say for the most part,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been born out when we&rsquo;ve given the vaccine at scale</p>
<p>in terms of protection against severe disease, right?</p>
<p>So people who have got the vaccine</p>
<p>for a very long time after they&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>for the full vaccination have had great protection</p>
<p>against being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s separate, because this seems to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s critics of both categories, but different.</p>
<p>Kids and kids, not older people,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say five years old and above or something,</p>
<p>or 13 years old and above.</p>
<p>So for those, it seems like the reduction</p>
<p>of the rate of fatalities and serious illness</p>
<p>seems to be something like 10X.</p>
<p>I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.</p>
<p>It transforms the problem of focus protection</p>
<p>from something that&rsquo;s quite challenging,</p>
<p>possible, I believe, but quite challenging</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s much, much more manageable.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine in and of itself when deployed</p>
<p>in older populations is a form of focus protection.</p>
<p>Yes, by the way, we&rsquo;ll talk about the focus protection</p>
<p>in one segment, because it&rsquo;s such a brilliant idea</p>
<p>for this pandemic or for future pandemics.</p>
<p>I thought the sociological, psychological discussion</p>
<p>about the letter from Francis Collins is,</p>
<p>because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m glad we talked about that first.</p>
<p>But so there seems to be, the vaccines work</p>
<p>to reduce deaths, and that has especially</p>
<p>the most transformative effects for the older folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong,</p>
<p>for sure, in the pandemic.</p>
<p>In January of this year, 2021,</p>
<p>I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right, it would make it so that you were much less likely</p>
<p>to be infected at all, because the antibodies</p>
<p>that were produced by the vaccines</p>
<p>looked like they were neutralizing antibodies</p>
<p>that would essentially block you from being infected at all.</p>
<p>That turned out to be wrong, right?</p>
<p>So I think, and it became clear as data came out</p>
<p>from Israel, which vaccinated very early,</p>
<p>that they were seeing surges of infection,</p>
<p>even in a very highly vaccinated population,</p>
<p>that the vaccine does not stop infection.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a used car salesman,</p>
<p>and you were selling the vaccine,</p>
<p>and the features you thought a vaccine would have,</p>
<p>I mean, I have a similar kind of sense</p>
<p>when the vaccine came out.</p>
<p>Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it,</p>
<p>it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it,</p>
<p>and if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it</p>
<p>to somebody else.</p>
<p>And it turns out that those latter two things</p>
<p>are not as definitive, or in fact,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know to which degree they&rsquo;re not there at all.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little complicated,</p>
<p>because I think the first two or three months</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;re fully vaccinated, after the second dose,</p>
<p>you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection.</p>
<p>So that, which is pretty good, I mean, right?</p>
<p>But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.</p>
<p>Some places, some studies, like there&rsquo;s a study</p>
<p>out of Sweden that suggests it might even drop to zero.</p>
<p>But, and then you&rsquo;re also infectious</p>
<p>for some period of time, if you do get it,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re vaccinated.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It seems to be lucidated that the period of time</p>
<p>your infectious is shorter.</p>
<p>Is shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high.</p>
<p>So you still, the point is that the vaccine</p>
<p>might reduce some risk of infecting others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a categorical difference.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not safe to be in the presence</p>
<p>of just vaccinated people.</p>
<p>You can still get infected.</p>
<p>Right, so, I mean, there&rsquo;s a million things</p>
<p>I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense</p>
<p>because the vaccine really helps</p>
<p>on the worst part of this pandemic,</p>
<p>which is killing people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy</p>
<p>come from in terms of, it seems like,</p>
<p>obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution</p>
<p>to let us open this thing up.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed</p>
<p>with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A very night with a very naive title,</p>
<p>which says we can end the lockdowns in a month.</p>
<p>And the idea is very simple.</p>
<p>Vaccinate all vulnerable people</p>
<p>and then open up.</p>
<p>Open up.</p>
<p>Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms,</p>
<p>this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration.</p>
<p>Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms</p>
<p>are devastating to the population at large.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this considerable segment of people</p>
<p>that are vulnerable, protect them.</p>
<p>Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool</p>
<p>to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population,</p>
<p>and as you said, there&rsquo;s a tenfold decrease</p>
<p>in the mortality risk from getting infected,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, amazing.</p>
<p>So that was the strategy we outlined.</p>
<p>What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.</p>
<p>So first there&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;re asking about vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>I think first there&rsquo;s the inherent limitations</p>
<p>of how to measure vaccine safety, right?</p>
<p>So we talked about a little bit about the trial,</p>
<p>but also after the trial, there&rsquo;s a mechanism,</p>
<p>and this is the work I&rsquo;ve been involved with before COVID,</p>
<p>on tracking and identifying and checking</p>
<p>whether the vaccines actually are safe.</p>
<p>And the central challenge is one of causality.</p>
<p>So you no longer have the randomized trial,</p>
<p>but you wanna know is the vaccine,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s deployed at scale, causing adverse events.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t just look at people who are vaccinated</p>
<p>and see what adverse events happen,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what would have happened</p>
<p>if the person had not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>So you have to have some control group.</p>
<p>Now, what happened is there&rsquo;s several systems</p>
<p>to check this that the CDC uses.</p>
<p>One very commonly known one now is called VAERS,</p>
<p>the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.</p>
<p>There, anyone who has an adverse event,</p>
<p>either a regular person or a doctor can just go report,</p>
<p>look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache</p>
<p>or whatever it is, the person died</p>
<p>a day after I had the vaccine, right?</p>
<p>Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first,</p>
<p>and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine.</p>
<p>So sometimes you&rsquo;ll see someone&rsquo;s vaccinated</p>
<p>and a few days later they die.</p>
<p>Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?</p>
<p>Really difficult to tell.</p>
<p>In order to tell, you need a control group.</p>
<p>For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Datalink.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another system called BEST,</p>
<p>I forget what the acronym is,</p>
<p>to essentially to track cohorts of people,</p>
<p>vaccinated versus unvaccinated,</p>
<p>with as careful of matching as you can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not randomized,</p>
<p>and then see if you have safety signals</p>
<p>that pop up in the vaccinated</p>
<p>relative to the control group unvaccinated.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, for instance,</p>
<p>how the myocarditis risk was picked up</p>
<p>in especially young men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also how the higher risk of blood clots</p>
<p>in middle age and older women</p>
<p>with the J&amp;J vaccine was picked up.</p>
<p>There, what you have are situations</p>
<p>where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low</p>
<p>that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not hard to understand that the vaccine did this.</p>
<p>Young men should not be having myocarditis.</p>
<p>Middle age women should not be having</p>
<p>huge blood clots in the brain.</p>
<p>So when you see that, you can say it&rsquo;s linked.</p>
<p>Now, the rates are low.</p>
<p>So young men, maybe one in 5,000,</p>
<p>one in 10,000 of the vaccine,</p>
<p>vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis.</p>
<p>Young women, middle age women, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the right number might be,</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;d say, it&rsquo;s like one in hundreds of thousands,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>So these are rare outcomes,</p>
<p>but they are vaccine linked outcomes.</p>
<p>How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?</p>
<p>I think you just tell people.</p>
<p>You tell people here are the risks.</p>
<p>You transparently tell them.</p>
<p>And just, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not getting into something that they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t treat people like they&rsquo;re children</p>
<p>and need to be told lies</p>
<p>because they won&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the full complexity of the truth.</p>
<p>People, I think, are pretty good at,</p>
<p>or actually, people with time are good at understanding data,</p>
<p>but better than anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re better at,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit.</p>
<p>And you give them either one of those.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll give you one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I think it&rsquo;s greatly undermined vaccine,</p>
<p>greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine,</p>
<p>is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID,</p>
<p>you have extremely good immunity,</p>
<p>both against infection and access to disease.</p>
<p>And that denial leads to people distrusting the message</p>
<p>given by like the CDC director, for instance,</p>
<p>in favor of the vaccine, right?</p>
<p>Why would you deny a thing that&rsquo;s such an obvious fact?</p>
<p>Like you can look at the data and it just,</p>
<p>I mean, it just pops out at you</p>
<p>that people that are COVID recovered</p>
<p>are not getting infected again at very high rates,</p>
<p>much lower rates.</p>
<p>After these kinds of conversations,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure after this very conversation,</p>
<p>I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire,</p>
<p>I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.</p>
<p>They also have a platform.</p>
<p>And I believe, at least in my mind,</p>
<p>about this COVID set of topics,</p>
<p>they represent a group of people.</p>
<p>Each group has smart, thoughtful,</p>
<p>well intentioned human beings.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know who is right,</p>
<p>but I do know that they&rsquo;re kind of tribal a little bit,</p>
<p>those groups.</p>
<p>And so the question I wanna ask is like,</p>
<p>what do you think about these two groups</p>
<p>and this kind of tension over the vaccine</p>
<p>that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics</p>
<p>on which to focus on,</p>
<p>like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,</p>
<p>whether there should be vaccine mandates or not,</p>
<p>which seem to be often very kind of specific policy</p>
<p>kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a symptom of the distrust</p>
<p>that people have in public health.</p>
<p>I think this kind of schism over the vaccine</p>
<p>does not happen in places</p>
<p>where the public health authorities</p>
<p>have been much more trustworthy, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t see this vaccine</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t seen Sweden, for instance.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened in the United States</p>
<p>is that the vaccine has become first because of politics,</p>
<p>but then also because of the scientific arrogance,</p>
<p>this sort of touchstone issue,</p>
<p>and people line up on both sides of it,</p>
<p>and the different language you&rsquo;re hearing</p>
<p>is structured around that.</p>
<p>So before the election, for instance,</p>
<p>I did a testimony in the House</p>
<p>on measurement of vaccine safety.</p>
<p>And I was invited by the Republicans.</p>
<p>There were, I think, four other experts</p>
<p>invited by the Democrats,</p>
<p>or three other experts invited by Democrats,</p>
<p>each of whom had a lot of experience</p>
<p>in measuring vaccine safety.</p>
<p>I was really surprised to hear them each doubt</p>
<p>whether the FDA would do a reasonable job</p>
<p>in assessing vaccine safety,</p>
<p>including by people who have long records</p>
<p>of working with the FDA.</p>
<p>I mean, these are professionals, great scientists,</p>
<p>whose main sort of goal in life</p>
<p>is to make sure that unsafe vaccines</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get released into the world.</p>
<p>And if they are, they get pulled.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re casting down on the vaccine</p>
<p>the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.</p>
<p>And then after the election,</p>
<p>the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?</p>
<p>All of a sudden, it&rsquo;s Republicans that are cast</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re vaccine hesitant.</p>
<p>That kind of political shift, the public notices.</p>
<p>If all it takes is an election to change</p>
<p>how people talk about the safety of the vaccine,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re not talking science anymore,</p>
<p>many people think, right?</p>
<p>I think that created its hesitancy.</p>
<p>The other thing I think,</p>
<p>I think the hesitancy,</p>
<p>some politicians viewed it as a political,</p>
<p>as sort of like a political opportunity</p>
<p>to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.</p>
<p>And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re telling me I&rsquo;m a rube</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t want the vaccine</p>
<p>because I want everyone to die,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m gonna react really negatively.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re talking down to me</p>
<p>about my legitimate sort of concerns</p>
<p>about whether this vaccine is safe to take,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard from women</p>
<p>who were thinking about getting pregnant,</p>
<p>should I take the vaccine?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, there are all kinds of questions,</p>
<p>legitimate questions that I think</p>
<p>should have good data to answer</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t necessarily have good data to answer.</p>
<p>So what do you do in the face of that?</p>
<p>Well, one reaction is to pretend</p>
<p>like we know for a fact that it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t have the data to know for a fact</p>
<p>in that particular group</p>
<p>with that particular set of clinical circumstances you know.</p>
<p>And that I think breeds hesitancy.</p>
<p>People can detect that bullshit.</p>
<p>Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, leave with humility.</p>
<p>Yeah, you will end up with a better result.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO.</p>
<p>This is part therapy session, part advice,</p>
<p>because again, I really want us to get through this together</p>
<p>and it feels like the division is a thing</p>
<p>that prevents us from getting through this together.</p>
<p>And once again, just like with Francis Collins,</p>
<p>a lot of people wrote to me words of support</p>
<p>and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand the nature of the criticism.</p>
<p>So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine</p>
<p>and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That I have a better understanding of.</p>
<p>But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.</p>
<p>So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand am I so naive</p>
<p>that I just don&rsquo;t see it?</p>
<p>Because yes, there&rsquo;s corrupt people and they&rsquo;re greedy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re flawed in all walks of life.</p>
<p>But companies do quite an incredible job</p>
<p>of taking a good idea at the scale</p>
<p>and making some money with that idea.</p>
<p>But they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not obvious to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see where the manipulation is.</p>
<p>So the fear that people have and I talked to Joe</p>
<p>about this quite a bit.</p>
<p>I think this is a legitimate fear</p>
<p>and a fear you should often have</p>
<p>that money has influenced,</p>
<p>this proportional influence, especially in politics.</p>
<p>So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine</p>
<p>was connected to the fact that lots of money</p>
<p>could be made by manufacturing the vaccine.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite a heck of a difficult task</p>
<p>to alleviate that concern.</p>
<p>Like you really have to be a great man or woman or a leader</p>
<p>to convince people that you&rsquo;re not full of shit,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not just playing a game on them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a difficult task.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I really don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the natural distrust every billionaire,</p>
<p>distrust everybody who&rsquo;s trying to make money</p>
<p>because it feels like under a capitalistic system at least,</p>
<p>the way to do a lot of good,</p>
<p>like to do good at scale in the world</p>
<p>is by being at least in part motivated by profit.</p>
<p>I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?</p>
<p>So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement.</p>
<p>The discovery of the vaccine</p>
<p>and then the manufacturing at scale</p>
<p>so that billions of people can take the vaccine</p>
<p>in a relatively short time.</p>
<p>That is a remarkable achievement</p>
<p>that could not have happened without companies like Pfizer.</p>
<p>And on the other hand,</p>
<p>there is this sort of corrupting influence of that money.</p>
<p>Just to give you one example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an enormous controversy over whether</p>
<p>relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs</p>
<p>can be used to treat the disease.</p>
<p>None of, no company like Pfizer</p>
<p>has any interest whatsoever in evaluating it.</p>
<p>Even Merck, I think it was Merck,</p>
<p>that had the patent on ivermectin now expired,</p>
<p>has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.</p>
<p>Not only do they not have interest,</p>
<p>they have a way of talking about people</p>
<p>who might have a little bit of interest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s again.</p>
<p>Fringe.</p>
<p>Full of arrogance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that is what troubles me.</p>
<p>Is there not a, it&rsquo;s back to the play of science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, they&rsquo;re not a bit of curiosity.</p>
<p>One, okay, one, the natural curiosity of a human being</p>
<p>that should always be there and an open mind is.</p>
<p>And second, in the case of ivermectin</p>
<p>and other things like that,</p>
<p>you have to acknowledge</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a very large number of people</p>
<p>who care about this topic.</p>
<p>And this is a way to inspire them</p>
<p>to also play in the space of science,</p>
<p>to inspire them with science.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just like dismiss everybody</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t just dismiss people, period.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think here, take ivermectin, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a study funded by the NIH,</p>
<p>by Tony Fauci&rsquo;s NIAID and the NIH</p>
<p>called ACTIV6 that&rsquo;s a randomized trial of ivermectin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s due to be completed in March, 2023.</p>
<p>So normally when you have private actors</p>
<p>like these big drug companies that have no interest</p>
<p>in conducting some kind of scientific experiment</p>
<p>that would have some public benefit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the job of the government,</p>
<p>and in this case, the NIH to fund that kind of work.</p>
<p>The NIH has been incredibly slow</p>
<p>in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been left to lots of other private activities</p>
<p>of uneven quality.</p>
<p>And hence, that&rsquo;s why you have these big fights.</p>
<p>Because the data are not solid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have these big fights.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also, okay, forget the process of science here,</p>
<p>the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies,</p>
<p>just the way it&rsquo;s being communicated about.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, like to horse paste, I mean, come on.</p>
<p>The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking ivermectin</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve heard good things about it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sick and they&rsquo;re desperate.</p>
<p>And to call it horse paste, that was terrible.</p>
<p>That was deeply irresponsible.</p>
<p>My hope is grounded in the fact</p>
<p>that young people see the bullshit of this,</p>
<p>young PhD students, graduate students,</p>
<p>young students in college,</p>
<p>they see the less than stellar way</p>
<p>that our scientific leaders</p>
<p>and our political leaders are behaving,</p>
<p>and then the new generation</p>
<p>will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>That is my hope, because that&rsquo;s the cool thing I see</p>
<p>about young people is they&rsquo;re good at detecting bullshit</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to be part of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope in the space of science.</p>
<p>Let me return to this idea</p>
<p>of the Great Barrington Declaration,</p>
<p>return to the beginning.</p>
<p>So what are the basics?</p>
<p>Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?</p>
<p>What are some of the ideas in it?</p>
<p>You mentioned focused protection.</p>
<p>What are your concerns about lockdowns?</p>
<p>Just paint the picture of this early proposal.</p>
<p>Sure, so the Great Barrington Declaration,</p>
<p>first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a great name.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such an epic name,</p>
<p>but the reason why it&rsquo;s called that is way less than epic.</p>
<p>It was because the conference,</p>
<p>which is organized by Martin Kulldorff,</p>
<p>who was a professor at Harvard University,</p>
<p>by a statistician, he actually designed the safety system,</p>
<p>the statistical system that the FDA uses</p>
<p>for tracking vaccine safety.</p>
<p>He and I had met previously just the summer before,</p>
<p>that summer, and he invited me</p>
<p>to come to this small conference</p>
<p>where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta,</p>
<p>who is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard,</p>
<p>sorry, at Oxford University.</p>
<p>And I mean, I jumped at the chance</p>
<p>because I knew that Martin and Sunetra</p>
<p>were both smarter than me,</p>
<p>and it would be fun to talk about</p>
<p>what the right strategy would be.</p>
<p>On the drive in, I didn&rsquo;t know what the name of the town was</p>
<p>and I asked, they said it was Great Barrington,</p>
<p>and I had it in the back of my head.</p>
<p>Martin and I arrived a little early</p>
<p>and we were writing an op ed about some of the ideas,</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;ll get to talk about very soon,</p>
<p>about focused protection and the right strategy.</p>
<p>And when Sunetra arrived,</p>
<p>we realized we&rsquo;d actually come basically to the same place</p>
<p>about the right way to deal with the epidemic.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, why don&rsquo;t we write something</p>
<p>like the Port Huron Statement,</p>
<p>is what I had in the back of my head.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, what&rsquo;s the name of this town again?</p>
<p>It was Great Barrington.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not Barrington, it&rsquo;s Great Barrington.</p>
<p>Which is fantastic, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so over the top that it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally like the Big Bang.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about these over the top fun titles</p>
<p>that just really delivered the power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my main contribution was the title,</p>
<p>the name Great Barrington Decorate.</p>
<p>But yeah, so it was kind of a,</p>
<p>so the idea is actually, well, the title is great.</p>
<p>And I think that it was written in a very stylish way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less than a page, you can go look online and read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written for, not for scientists,</p>
<p>but for the general public</p>
<p>so that people can understand the ideas really simply.</p>
<p>But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.</p>
<p>It actually represents the old pandemic plans</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve used for a century</p>
<p>dealing with other similar pandemics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s twofold.</p>
<p>First, let me talk about the science it rests on,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll talk about the plan.</p>
<p>The science actually, some of it we already talked about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this massive age gradient</p>
<p>in the risk of COVID infection.</p>
<p>Older people face much higher risk than younger people.</p>
<p>The second bit of science is all,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not controversial, right?</p>
<p>Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2,</p>
<p>no matter what, everyone thinks,</p>
<p>everyone agrees on this age gradient.</p>
<p>The second bit of science is also not controversial.</p>
<p>The lockdown focused policies that we&rsquo;ve followed</p>
<p>have absolutely devastating consequences</p>
<p>on the health of the population.</p>
<p>Let me just give you some examples.</p>
<p>And this was known in October of 2020 when we wrote it.</p>
<p>So the UN was sounding alarms</p>
<p>that there would be tens of millions of people</p>
<p>who would starve as a consequence</p>
<p>of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s come to pass.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of children</p>
<p>in places like South Asia dead from starvation</p>
<p>as a consequence of lockdowns.</p>
<p>The priorities like the treatment of patients</p>
<p>with tuberculosis in poor countries stopped</p>
<p>because of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Childhood vaccinations of measles, mumps, rubella,</p>
<p>DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,</p>
<p>all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of children skipping these doses</p>
<p>for diseases that are actually deadly for them.</p>
<p>Is there, just on a small tangent,</p>
<p>is it well understood to you what are the mechanisms</p>
<p>that stop all those things because of lockdowns?</p>
<p>Is it some aspect of supply chain?</p>
<p>Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?</p>
<p>Is it because there&rsquo;s a disincentive to go outside</p>
<p>by people even when they deeply need help?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the above.</p>
<p>But a lot of those efforts,</p>
<p>especially those vaccination efforts are funded</p>
<p>and run by Western efforts.</p>
<p>Like Gavi is a, I think it&rsquo;s a Gates funded thing actually</p>
<p>that provides vaccines for millions of kids worldwide.</p>
<p>And those efforts were scaled back.</p>
<p>Malaria prevention efforts.</p>
<p>So in the developing world,</p>
<p>it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.</p>
<p>There was also direct effects.</p>
<p>Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted,</p>
<p>there was an order that 10 million migrant workers</p>
<p>who live in big cities and they live hand to mouth,</p>
<p>they buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts with the money,</p>
<p>they buy food for themselves and coconuts</p>
<p>for the next day to sell,</p>
<p>walk back to their villages</p>
<p>or go back to their villages overnight.</p>
<p>So 10 million people walking back to their villages</p>
<p>or taking a train back, 1,000 died on route.</p>
<p>Overcrowded trains dying essentially on the side of the road.</p>
<p>I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.</p>
<p>And the lockdowns there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like what&rsquo;s happened in the West as well,</p>
<p>but it was so severe.</p>
<p>There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai</p>
<p>by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai,</p>
<p>there were 70% seroprevalence in July or August of 2020,</p>
<p>whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%, right?</p>
<p>So it was incredibly unequal.</p>
<p>The lockdowns protected the relatively well off</p>
<p>and spread the disease among the poor.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the developing world.</p>
<p>In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns</p>
<p>were also quite bad, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked already about isolation and depression.</p>
<p>There was a study done in July of 2020</p>
<p>that found that one in four young adults</p>
<p>seriously considered suicide.</p>
<p>Now, suicide rates haven&rsquo;t spiked up so much,</p>
<p>but the depths of despair that would lead somebody</p>
<p>to seriously consider suicide itself</p>
<p>should be a source of great concern in public health.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of the troubling things about measuring</p>
<p>well being is we&rsquo;re okay at measuring death and suicide.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not so good at measuring suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people talk about maybe even Holodomor</p>
<p>under Stalin or the concentration camps with Hitler.</p>
<p>We talk about deaths, but we don&rsquo;t talk about the suffering</p>
<p>over periods of years by people living in fear,</p>
<p>by people starving, psychological trauma</p>
<p>that lasts a lifetime, all of those things.</p>
<p>I mean, and just to get back to that point,</p>
<p>we closed schools, especially in blue states,</p>
<p>we closed schools.</p>
<p>Now, richer parents could send their kids</p>
<p>to private schools, many of which stayed open</p>
<p>even in the blue states.</p>
<p>They could get pods, they could get tutors,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not true for poor and middle class parents.</p>
<p>And as a result, what we did is we took away</p>
<p>life opportunities for kids.</p>
<p>We tried to teach five year olds to read via Zoom</p>
<p>in kindergarten, right?</p>
<p>And the consequence actually, you think, okay,</p>
<p>we can just make it up, but it&rsquo;s really difficult</p>
<p>to make that up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a literature in health economics that shows</p>
<p>that even relatively small disruptions in schooling</p>
<p>can have lifelong consequences, negative consequences</p>
<p>for kids, right?</p>
<p>So they end up growing up poorer, they lead shorter lives</p>
<p>and less healthy lives as a consequence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the literature now shows is likely to happen</p>
<p>with the interruptions of schooling that we had</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.</p>
<p>There were in the early days of the epidemic</p>
<p>great indications that children first were not</p>
<p>very severely at risk from COVID itself,</p>
<p>nor are they super spreaders.</p>
<p>Schools were not the source of community spread,</p>
<p>communities spread the disease to schools,</p>
<p>not the other way around.</p>
<p>And we can talk about the scientific base of that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like, but that was pretty well known</p>
<p>even in October.</p>
<p>We closed hospitals in order to keep them</p>
<p>available to COVID patients, but as a result,</p>
<p>women skipped breast cancer screening.</p>
<p>As a result, they are showing up with late stage</p>
<p>breast cancer that should have been picked up last year.</p>
<p>Men and women skipped colon cancer screening,</p>
<p>again, with later stage disease that should have been</p>
<p>picked up last year with earlier stage.</p>
<p>For patients with diabetes, it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to have regular screening for blood sugar levels</p>
<p>and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement.</p>
<p>And we skipped that.</p>
<p>People stayed home with heart attacks</p>
<p>and died at home with heart attacks.</p>
<p>So you had this like sort of wide range of medical</p>
<p>and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored</p>
<p>as a result of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s the economic pain.</p>
<p>So like you said, whatever is a good term</p>
<p>for the non laptop class, people would lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Yes, there might be in the Western world support</p>
<p>for them financially, but the big loss there</p>
<p>that is perhaps correlated with depression and suicide</p>
<p>is loss of meaning, loss of hope for the future,</p>
<p>loss of kind of a sense of stability,</p>
<p>all the pride you have in being able to make money</p>
<p>that allows you to pave your own way in the world.</p>
<p>And yes, just having less money than you&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>so your family, your kids are suffering,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, again, an economics literature on this,</p>
<p>on deaths of despair it was called.</p>
<p>2009, there was the great recession.</p>
<p>It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from drugs,</p>
<p>suicidality, depression, as a result of the job losses</p>
<p>that happened during the great recession.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s happening again,</p>
<p>like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an accident, that&rsquo;s a lockdown harm, right?</p>
<p>Same thing with the job losses.</p>
<p>The job losses, by the way, are like, it&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>because the states that stayed open</p>
<p>have had much, much lower unemployment</p>
<p>than the states that stayed closed.</p>
<p>The labor force participation rates declined by 3%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s women that separated</p>
<p>because they stayed home with their kids.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reversed a generation of women,</p>
<p>improving women&rsquo;s participation in the labor force.</p>
<p>Do you think it has to do with the institutions</p>
<p>that we mentioned that there was so much priority given</p>
<p>or so much power given to maybe NIH</p>
<p>versus other civilian leaders?</p>
<p>Or do people just not care about the economic pain?</p>
<p>The leaders, I mean, because to me it was obvious.</p>
<p>I mean, probably it&rsquo;s just studying history.</p>
<p>Whenever I listen to people on Twitter</p>
<p>or on mainstream news or just anything,</p>
<p>I realize that&rsquo;s the very kind of top.</p>
<p>The people that have a voice</p>
<p>represent a tiny selection of people.</p>
<p>And so whenever there&rsquo;s hard times,</p>
<p>I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless,</p>
<p>the quiet suffering of the tens of millions,</p>
<p>of the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Do the political leaders not just give a damn?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing</p>
<p>at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p>where if you brought up economic harms at all,</p>
<p>you were seen as callous.</p>
<p>So I had a reporter call me up</p>
<p>almost at the very beginning of the epidemic</p>
<p>asking me about a very particular phenomenon.</p>
<p>So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse</p>
<p>because children were gonna be staying at home.</p>
<p>Child abuse is generally picked up at school.</p>
<p>And that actually happened.</p>
<p>So the reported child abuse dropped,</p>
<p>but actual child abuse increased</p>
<p>because normally you pick up the child abuse at school</p>
<p>and that you have the intervention, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, so I was talking about like,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s gonna be some economic harms</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna have health consequences,</p>
<p>but the economic harms matter.</p>
<p>But he counseled me.</p>
<p>And I think he had my best interest at heart.</p>
<p>Like if you were to put that in the story,</p>
<p>I would be, I&rsquo;d essentially be canceled.</p>
<p>Because what the narrative that arose in March of 2020</p>
<p>is if you care about money at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re evil and crass, you must only care about lives.</p>
<p>The problem with that narrative is that that money,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>is actually lives of poor people, right?</p>
<p>When you throw 100 million people around the world</p>
<p>into poverty, you&rsquo;re going to see enormous harm</p>
<p>to their health, enormous increases in their mortality.</p>
<p>It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that</p>
<p>in the context of this pandemic response.</p>
<p>Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot</p>
<p>that there are so many other public health priorities as well</p>
<p>that need our attention desperately.</p>
<p>And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco</p>
<p>when I visited, I was thinking of moving there for a startup.</p>
<p>This is the thing I&rsquo;m really afraid of,</p>
<p>especially if I have any effect on the world</p>
<p>through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.</p>
<p>That you mentioned the laptop class,</p>
<p>living in this world where you&rsquo;re only concerned</p>
<p>about this particular class of people.</p>
<p>And also, perhaps early on in the pandemic,</p>
<p>amongst the laptop class,</p>
<p>there was a legitimate concern for health,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not sure how deadly this virus is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not sure who to listen to, so there&rsquo;s a real concern.</p>
<p>And then at a certain point when the data starts coming in,</p>
<p>you start becoming more and more detached from the data.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t start caring less and less,</p>
<p>and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,</p>
<p>like existing in the space of narratives,</p>
<p>and you have this narrative in San Francisco</p>
<p>in the laptop class that you just are very proud</p>
<p>that you know the truth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the sole possessors of the truth,</p>
<p>you congratulate yourself on it,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t care what actually gigantic detrimental effect</p>
<p>that has on society, because you&rsquo;re mostly fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so terrified of that.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I think the antidote to that</p>
<p>is just to remember.</p>
<p>You remember.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, you know, remember where you came from</p>
<p>and remember who you&rsquo;re doing this for.</p>
<p>At the back of your head should always be,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose?</p>
<p>Like, why am I here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of this?</p>
<p>And if the purpose is simply self aggrandizement,</p>
<p>then you should rethink,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll just end up being a hollow life.</p>
<p>All of us will be forgotten in the end.</p>
<p>Focused protection, the idea, the policy,</p>
<p>what is focused protection?</p>
<p>Right, so I was saying that there&rsquo;s two scientific bases,</p>
<p>right, so one is this steep age gradient,</p>
<p>and the second is the existence of locked arms.</p>
<p>Again, I think there&rsquo;s very little disagreement</p>
<p>in the scientific community on both of those facts.</p>
<p>If you put those facts together,</p>
<p>the obvious policy is to protect the people</p>
<p>who are at the most severe risk from the disease itself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the idea of focused protection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the general principle of it.</p>
<p>The actual implementation of it</p>
<p>depends on the living circumstances</p>
<p>of the people that are at risk,</p>
<p>the resources that are available in the community,</p>
<p>the technology that&rsquo;s available to do this.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost always going to be,</p>
<p>in fact, it&rsquo;ll always be a local thing,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll depend on all of those things</p>
<p>which are all local in nature.</p>
<p>Right, so one very, very obvious thing,</p>
<p>in a country like ours,</p>
<p>where so many older people live in institutionalized settings</p>
<p>and nursing home settings,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where older, really vulnerable,</p>
<p>chronically ill patients often live,</p>
<p>and you know this disease affects that group,</p>
<p>most commonly, it is absolutely vital</p>
<p>to protect that group.</p>
<p>We should have known that in February 2020,</p>
<p>just from the Chinese data.</p>
<p>And we should have thought about that group</p>
<p>as the key constraint in our policymaking.</p>
<p>Instead, we thought about, in February and March 2020,</p>
<p>as hospital beds as the key constraint.</p>
<p>Hospital beds and ventilator shortages,</p>
<p>and so we ran around trying to address</p>
<p>that constraint, like a linear programming problem,</p>
<p>you figure out which constraint&rsquo;s binding</p>
<p>and you address that one thing</p>
<p>and then you go on to the next one, right?</p>
<p>If that one constraint,</p>
<p>we said, okay, the constraint is hospital beds.</p>
<p>That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states</p>
<p>to send COVID infected patients who were on the verge</p>
<p>or looked like they were about to recover</p>
<p>back to nursing homes,</p>
<p>who then spread the disease all through there,</p>
<p>because they wanted to preserve the hospital beds.</p>
<p>Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization,</p>
<p>I love the way you frame this.</p>
<p>But those are kind of connected, right?</p>
<p>If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable,</p>
<p>you will also have the effect</p>
<p>of not hitting the ceiling of the available hospital beds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the irony.</p>
<p>If we protected the vulnerable,</p>
<p>the vulnerable are the most likely to be hospitalized,</p>
<p>and so by protecting the hospital,</p>
<p>by protecting the vulnerable,</p>
<p>we will also have addressed the shortage of hospital beds</p>
<p>more effectively.</p>
<p>So that little shift in priority</p>
<p>would have had a big impact.</p>
<p>Okay, but specifically, the idea is to,</p>
<p>and we could talk about different ideas</p>
<p>of how to actually do this,</p>
<p>but you basically do a lockdown or something like that</p>
<p>on a very small set of people.</p>
<p>You may have to do that</p>
<p>if community spread is very high,</p>
<p>but generally, I think it would depend on, again,</p>
<p>the living circumstances and the,</p>
<p>so for instance, if you are in a,</p>
<p>if you have a, here&rsquo;s a very simple idea</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require a lockdown forced on them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually generally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in favor of that kind of forced lockdown</p>
<p>because you just won&rsquo;t get cooperation.</p>
<p>But what you could do is provide resources</p>
<p>to that group of people.</p>
<p>So imagine you live next door to somebody, an older couple,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s high community spread.</p>
<p>Well, they have to go grocery shopping.</p>
<p>We did like, some communities did these</p>
<p>like senior only grocery hour, right?</p>
<p>But they have to still have to go out</p>
<p>and they might get exposed</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re shopping amongst other seniors.</p>
<p>Well, why not organized home delivery of groceries to them?</p>
<p>We did that for the laptop class, right?</p>
<p>Or you can even just use a volunteer effort.</p>
<p>The older people living next door,</p>
<p>just call them up and say,</p>
<p>can I help you go out and go shopping for you?</p>
<p>And so you would have potentially federal support</p>
<p>of that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So these kinds of efforts.</p>
<p>Identify where the vulnerable people live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really challenging in multigenerational homes.</p>
<p>In LA County, for instance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of older people living together</p>
<p>with younger people in relatively crowded,</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s really quite a challenge.</p>
<p>But there again, you can use resources.</p>
<p>So if grandma is worried that grandson has come home,</p>
<p>but is potentially been exposed,</p>
<p>grandson calls grandma says, I mean,</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve been at a party where COVID was.</p>
<p>Grandma calls public health, public health,</p>
<p>and says, okay, you can have this hotel room</p>
<p>for a couple of days until you check to turn negative.</p>
<p>In case it wasn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>the idea of focused protection</p>
<p>is the people that are vulnerable, protect them.</p>
<p>And everybody else goes on with their lives,</p>
<p>open up the economy, just do as it was before.</p>
<p>There was still fear abroad.</p>
<p>So there still would be some restrictions</p>
<p>that people would pose on themselves.</p>
<p>They probably would go to parties less.</p>
<p>The grandsons probably wouldn&rsquo;t go so many parties, right?</p>
<p>There would be less participation in big gatherings.</p>
<p>And you may even say like big gatherings</p>
<p>in order to restrict community spread again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against any of that,</p>
<p>but you shouldn&rsquo;t be closing businesses.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be closing churches and synagogues.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be forcing people to not go to school.</p>
<p>You should not be shuttering businesses.</p>
<p>You should just allow society to go on.</p>
<p>Some disease will spread, but as we&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>the lockdown didn&rsquo;t stop the disease from spreading anyways.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what do you make of the criticism that this idea,</p>
<p>like all good ideas cannot actually be implemented</p>
<p>in a heterogeneous society</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of people intermixing?</p>
<p>And once you open it up,</p>
<p>people like the younger people will just forget</p>
<p>that this is even existing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll stop caring about the older people</p>
<p>and mess up the whole thing.</p>
<p>And the government will not want to fund</p>
<p>any kind of the great efforts you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>about food delivery and then the food delivery services</p>
<p>be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway?</p>
<p>Because like, it&rsquo;s not making me much money.</p>
<p>And so therefore like all good ideas, it will collapse.</p>
<p>That might be true.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s always a risk with policy thing,</p>
<p>but I think if you think back to the moment,</p>
<p>but we actually felt like we were in this together</p>
<p>to some extent.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right, I think that that empathy that we had</p>
<p>that was used to like tell people to stay in</p>
<p>and like happily, not go in happily,</p>
<p>but like stay in to like wear a mask</p>
<p>or to do all these things that we thought</p>
<p>would help other people could have been redirected</p>
<p>to actually helping the people who most needed to be helped.</p>
<p>Especially, I do remember March.</p>
<p>So this is even way before Barrington,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>March, April, May, there was a feeling like</p>
<p>if we all just work together, we&rsquo;ll solve this.</p>
<p>And that maybe started to, when did that start breaking down?</p>
<p>I mean, unfortunately the election is mixed into this.</p>
<p>That it became politicized.</p>
<p>But I think it lasted quite a long time.</p>
<p>I think into the summer,</p>
<p>I think there was some of that sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it obviously varied among different people.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s true it would have been challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also true that it&rsquo;s heterogeneous,</p>
<p>exactly the way you said.</p>
<p>But what that means is you need a local response,</p>
<p>a response, so like my vision of a public health officer</p>
<p>is someone that understands their community,</p>
<p>not necessarily the nation at large, but their community,</p>
<p>and then works within their community</p>
<p>to figure out how to deploy the resources</p>
<p>that they have available</p>
<p>to do the kind of protection policies we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what should have happened.</p>
<p>Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts</p>
<p>closing, making sure businesses stayed closed.</p>
<p>Businesses that, I mean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hardware stores that closed.</p>
<p>What good did closing a hardware store do</p>
<p>for the spread of COVID?</p>
<p>If it had an effect on COVID spread,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be March.</p>
<p>Checking to make sure that plexiglass</p>
<p>was put up everywhere,</p>
<p>which now in retrospect turns out</p>
<p>to have probably made the disease worse.</p>
<p>Masking enforcement, so shaming around masks,</p>
<p>I mean, a huge amount of effort on things</p>
<p>that were only tangentially related to focus protection.</p>
<p>What if we turned our energy,</p>
<p>that enormous energy put into that,</p>
<p>instead into focus protection of the vulnerable?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially the conversation I was calling for.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t, I mean, I didn&rsquo;t think of it</p>
<p>as we had every single idea.</p>
<p>I mean, we gave some concrete proposals,</p>
<p>but the criticism we got was that</p>
<p>those concrete proposals weren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>And the answer to that is that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of them as enough.</p>
<p>I was thinking that I wanted to involve</p>
<p>an enormous number of people in local public health</p>
<p>to help think about how to do focus protection</p>
<p>in their communities.</p>
<p>The question that&rsquo;s interesting here is about the future too.</p>
<p>So COVID has very specific characteristics,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, about the curve of the death rate</p>
<p>based on the, like it seems like with COVID,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit easier to actually identify</p>
<p>a group of people that you need to protect.</p>
<p>So other viruses may not be this way.</p>
<p>So might lockdown be a good idea, like hardcore lockdown</p>
<p>for a future virus that&rsquo;s 10 times deadlier,</p>
<p>but spreads at the same rate as COVID?</p>
<p>Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine a virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 times deadlier, what&rsquo;s the right response?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s always gonna be focus protection,</p>
<p>but the group that needs the focus protection may change</p>
<p>depending on the biology of the virus, right?</p>
<p>So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the US,</p>
<p>the great, the people at most risk were children.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know really at the beginning</p>
<p>there was this fecal oral spread.</p>
<p>And so we did all kinds of crazy things,</p>
<p>including like spraying DDT in communities,</p>
<p>which somehow was supposed to get rid of polio.</p>
<p>But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak,</p>
<p>they would close the school down.</p>
<p>And that was the right thing to do</p>
<p>because that group that needed protection was children.</p>
<p>And the disease was spread, we thought in schools.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single formula that works,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a single principle that works, right?</p>
<p>No matter, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a disease</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uniformly deadly across every group</p>
<p>in every single person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be some group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s differentially harmed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be some group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s differentially protected.</p>
<p>And that may change over time, right?</p>
<p>So like in this disease, in this epidemic,</p>
<p>as people got infected and recovered,</p>
<p>we now had a class of people</p>
<p>that were pretty well protected against the disease.</p>
<p>They should be, like instead of ostracizing them</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want a vaccine,</p>
<p>we should be allowing them to work.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re having staffing shortages in hospitals now</p>
<p>because we forgot that principle.</p>
<p>Is quite a bit of this a technology problem?</p>
<p>So being able to,</p>
<p>how much of it is a sociological problem?</p>
<p>How much of it is a technology problem?</p>
<p>Like where do you put the blame</p>
<p>sort of on why this didn&rsquo;t go so great</p>
<p>and how it can go great in the beginning?</p>
<p>I mean, think about lockdowns.</p>
<p>Like if we didn&rsquo;t have Zoom,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have lockdowns.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason in 2009 we didn&rsquo;t lock down.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t have the technology to replace work</p>
<p>with this remote technology.</p>
<p>So we had good lockdown technology in Zoom.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have good focus protection technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, focus protection</p>
<p>is always gonna be complicated,</p>
<p>especially for something like this that spreads so easily,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be complicated.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the last person to say it would have been perfect.</p>
<p>There would have been people that would have gotten sick,</p>
<p>but they got sick anyways.</p>
<p>The hope was that if we suppress community spread</p>
<p>low enough, we can protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>That was the hope by lockdown.</p>
<p>The reality was that only a certain class of people</p>
<p>were able to benefit from lockdown.</p>
<p>The rest of society, we call them essential workers,</p>
<p>had to keep working and they got sick.</p>
<p>And the disease kept spreading.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t actually have a substantial effect</p>
<p>on community spread in non laptop class populations.</p>
<p>And also we should probably expand the class of people</p>
<p>we call vulnerable to those who would suffer,</p>
<p>who have the capacity to suffer,</p>
<p>given the policies you&rsquo;re weighing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very disingenuous to call the vulnerable</p>
<p>just the people, obviously we had the very specific meaning,</p>
<p>but broadly speaking, vulnerable should include anybody</p>
<p>who can suffer based on the policies you take</p>
<p>in response to a virus.</p>
<p>That principle you just said is completely agree with</p>
<p>is something I think has been lost.</p>
<p>And unfortunately lost, right?</p>
<p>So the policies themselves, if they have harm,</p>
<p>those are real and we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend like they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And essentially demonize the people that suffer them.</p>
<p>Or pretend, I mean like a lot of times like the depression</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thought of as like not so important,</p>
<p>but it is important.</p>
<p>And especially the harm to the people in poor countries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like been out of sight, out of mind</p>
<p>in much of the rich parts of the world.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ve hoped that we seeing this,</p>
<p>learning lessons of history with the communication tools</p>
<p>who have now will learn this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going to another country</p>
<p>and bombing targeted terrorist locations,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s going to be some civilians who die,</p>
<p>pretending that the child who watches their dad die</p>
<p>is not going to grow up, first of all, traumatized,</p>
<p>but second of all, potentially bring more hate to the world</p>
<p>than the hate that you were allegedly fighting</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another sort of considering only one kind of harm</p>
<p>and not the full range of harms</p>
<p>that are being caused by your policies.</p>
<p>You know, like the good return to focus protection,</p>
<p>we still should be following the policy now for COVID</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>So the vaccines, there&rsquo;s a great shortage of vaccines.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t know it in the United States</p>
<p>and the rich parts of the world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a great shortage of vaccines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to be able to vaccinate the most of the,</p>
<p>like the entire set of elderly at least,</p>
<p>and or larger groups until late 2022.</p>
<p>Huge numbers of older people around the world</p>
<p>in poor countries that have not COVID recovered yet,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re still quite vulnerable, have not had the vaccine.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re talking about vaccinating five year olds</p>
<p>who benefit, if at all, from the vaccines</p>
<p>of just a very little bit</p>
<p>because they face such a low risk of harm from COVID.</p>
<p>Well, something that&rsquo;s a little bit near and dear</p>
<p>to our specific, the two of our hearts.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re at Stanford.</p>
<p>So Stanford recently announced</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going back to virtual,</p>
<p>at least for some period of time in response to the,</p>
<p>maybe you can clarify, but I think it&rsquo;s in response</p>
<p>to the escalated, how would they phrase it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to Omicron.</p>
<p>And a few other universities are kind of like</p>
<p>considering back and forth.</p>
<p>In my perspective, as somebody who loves</p>
<p>in person lectures, who sees the value of that</p>
<p>to students, to young minds, also looking at the data,</p>
<p>seems the risk aversion in university policies</p>
<p>around this, given how healthy the student population is,</p>
<p>seems not well calibrated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>Also, pathological is one way to put it.</p>
<p>Given that, I believe, depending on the university,</p>
<p>but I think many universities require</p>
<p>that the student body is vaccinated at this point.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a big mistake by Stanford to do this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to say that because I just hope MIT doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about Stanford?</p>
<p>Is there a student?</p>
<p>I completely agree with you.</p>
<p>I think we have failed in our mission</p>
<p>to educate our students by this decision.</p>
<p>And I think, frankly, just more broadly,</p>
<p>I think we failed generally over the course</p>
<p>of the last year and a half in living up</p>
<p>to our educational mission.</p>
<p>In person teaching is vital.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand, if you have older faculty,</p>
<p>the principle of focus protection says,</p>
<p>provide some alternative teaching arrangements for them.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>From the kid&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more harmed by not getting the education</p>
<p>we promised them than by COVID.</p>
<p>So applying this principle of this focus protection,</p>
<p>let young professors teach in person.</p>
<p>This is before the vaccine.</p>
<p>After the vaccine, let everyone teach in person.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the part,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the discussion we&rsquo;re even having</p>
<p>because, okay, let&rsquo;s leave focus protection aside here</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a brilliant policy for,</p>
<p>perhaps for the future when there&rsquo;s no vaccine.</p>
<p>Now with the vaccine, I&rsquo;m misunderstanding something here</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re now in a space that&rsquo;s psychological.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer about biology</p>
<p>because with the booster shots,</p>
<p>which I believe MIT is now requiring before January,</p>
<p>with the booster shots, the data shows,</p>
<p>no matter how old you are, the risks are very low</p>
<p>for ending up in a hospital</p>
<p>relative to all the other risks you face when you&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Can you explain the policy around closing a university</p>
<p>but also just a policy about just being so scared still</p>
<p>in the university setting?</p>
<p>I think the great universities have done great harm</p>
<p>by modeling this kind of behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, to me, sorry to keep interrupting,</p>
<p>but to me, the university should be the beacon</p>
<p>of great behavior, not the beacon of scared, conservative,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not mess up.</p>
<p>Pathological.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not make it pathological.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not make anybody angry.</p>
<p>It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>Yes, so I think the central problem is,</p>
<p>actually related to the central problem</p>
<p>of COVID policy more generally,</p>
<p>the goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading</p>
<p>rather than to reduce the harm from the disease.</p>
<p>If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading,</p>
<p>the sad fact is we have no technology to accomplish that.</p>
<p>At this point.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s already deeply integrated into human civilization.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s here forever, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a zero survey of white tail deer in the US.</p>
<p>It turns out 80% of white tail deer in the US</p>
<p>have COVID antibodies.</p>
<p>Dogs get it, cats get it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost certainly human animal transmission of it.</p>
<p>I mean, presumably, I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard bats get it,</p>
<p>apparently, so you have a situation</p>
<p>where you have this disease that&rsquo;s here to stay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the vaccines don&rsquo;t stop the spread of it,</p>
<p>the lockdowns don&rsquo;t stop the spread of it.</p>
<p>We have no technology to stop the spread of it.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re burning the earth trying to stop,</p>
<p>do something that&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>rather than working on what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And so like letting regular college happen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great good.</p>
<p>Universities are a wonderful invention</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s contributed so much to society.</p>
<p>Just decide to shut it down.</p>
<p>The universities should be fighting tooth and nail</p>
<p>to not be shut down, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Whatever the mechanisms that results</p>
<p>in the universities doing that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably, this is me talking,</p>
<p>it probably has to do with certain incentives</p>
<p>for the administration, probably has to do with lawyers</p>
<p>and legal kinds of things to avoid legal trouble.</p>
<p>But once again, it&rsquo;s when the administration</p>
<p>has too much power and too much definition</p>
<p>of what the policy is for the university,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you get into trouble.</p>
<p>The beauty, the power of the university</p>
<p>should be about the faculty and the students.</p>
<p>Administration just gets in the way, get out of the way.</p>
<p>I mean, they can help organize things.</p>
<p>They play some important role, but they certainly do.</p>
<p>But they need to remember what the mission is.</p>
<p>The mission is not safety.</p>
<p>The mission, actually, universities should be</p>
<p>dangerous places for ideas and whatnot.</p>
<p>What is the role of fear in a pandemic?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been dancing around it.</p>
<p>Is it useful?</p>
<p>Is it destructive?</p>
<p>Or is there sort of a complicated story here?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re taking us back into January 2020.</p>
<p>There was so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>This could have been a pandemic that is Black Death,</p>
<p>the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very new to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rusty.</p>
<p>So there is some value to fear</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t do the stupid thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just go on living.</p>
<p>I guess where I come from,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost entirely counterproductive.</p>
<p>I think fear should never be used as a tactic</p>
<p>to manipulate human behavior by public health.</p>
<p>So the fear on the individual level,</p>
<p>that feeling of fear,</p>
<p>you should be very hesitant about that feeling</p>
<p>because it could be easily manipulated by the powerful.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think that fear is natural.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something that you have to stoke to get</p>
<p>when the facts on the ground suggest it, right?</p>
<p>In fact, the tendency for humans</p>
<p>in the face of threats from infectious disease</p>
<p>is to exaggerate the fear in their own minds</p>
<p>of being contaminated by the environment and by others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just natural to humans.</p>
<p>And the role of public health</p>
<p>is not necessarily to eradicate the fear,</p>
<p>but obviously technological advances</p>
<p>can help eradicate the fear,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really to help manage that fear</p>
<p>and help people put the sort of incentives</p>
<p>that come out of that to useful things</p>
<p>as opposed to harmful things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened in this pandemic</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s been a deliberate policy to stoke the fear,</p>
<p>to help make people think that the disease</p>
<p>is worse than it actually is.</p>
<p>In survey after survey, you see this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been incredibly damaging.</p>
<p>So young people have readily given away</p>
<p>their willingness to participate in regular life</p>
<p>because A, they fear COVID more than they ought,</p>
<p>and B, they fear that they&rsquo;re gonna harm the vulnerable</p>
<p>in their lives.</p>
<p>You put those two together</p>
<p>and you get this powerful demand for lockdowns.</p>
<p>You see this all over the world.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand</p>
<p>for irrational policies, irrational policies,</p>
<p>because I would like to mention the flip side of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saddened to see how much money</p>
<p>there is to be made by the martyrs,</p>
<p>the people, the conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>that tell you you should be afraid of the government.</p>
<p>You should be afraid of the man.</p>
<p>It feels like fear is the problem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some guy that once said something</p>
<p>about we should fear fear itself.</p>
<p>He was a president or something.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m worried about both sides here, that.</p>
<p>Well, I think the general principle</p>
<p>is that should not be a tool of public policy, right?</p>
<p>The public policy should attempt,</p>
<p>and public health policy in particular,</p>
<p>should attempt to address that fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you should tell people lies, of course not.</p>
<p>Tell people accurately what the risk is.</p>
<p>Give people tools that have evidence</p>
<p>that they can address their risk with</p>
<p>and level with people when we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that is the right adult way</p>
<p>to deal with this pandemic from a public health point of view.</p>
<p>And that is not the policy we have followed.</p>
<p>Instead, public health is intentionally stoked the fear</p>
<p>in order to gain compliance with its edicts.</p>
<p>And I think the consequence of that</p>
<p>is people distrust public health.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about, the distrust of government,</p>
<p>I think is partly a consequence of that.</p>
<p>That movement, which is much smaller once upon a time,</p>
<p>is much larger now because of essentially</p>
<p>people look at what public health has done</p>
<p>and said they&rsquo;ve lied to me a whole bunch of times</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of things is the general sense.</p>
<p>And there are consequences to that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to work in public health for a long time</p>
<p>to try to regain the trust of the public.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this, you&rsquo;ve been inspiring to me,</p>
<p>to a lot of people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been fearless, bold,</p>
<p>in these kind of challenging the policies</p>
<p>and not in a martyr kind of way</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re walking the line gracefully</p>
<p>and beautifully, I would say.</p>
<p>And looking at that, I think you&rsquo;re an inspiration</p>
<p>to a lot of young people.</p>
<p>So I have to ask, what advice would you give them</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re thinking of going into science,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re thinking of having an impact in the world,</p>
<p>what advice would you give them about their career</p>
<p>and maybe about their life?</p>
<p>Thinking about somebody in high school,</p>
<p>maybe in undergraduate college.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say a few things.</p>
<p>One is, this is a wonderful profession.</p>
<p>You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many</p>
<p>and do it by having fun,</p>
<p>the kind of play we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute privilege to be able to work</p>
<p>in this kind of area.</p>
<p>And to young people looking to say,</p>
<p>that have some gifts or desire for this area,</p>
<p>I say, please, go for it.</p>
<p>So this area of science broadly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it could be,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t have any gifts in AI,</p>
<p>but like, it could be your buddy,</p>
<p>or in health or in medicine or whatever,</p>
<p>whatever your gifts lie, develop them,</p>
<p>work hard and develop them,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth it, not just because you get some status,</p>
<p>but because the journey is fun.</p>
<p>And the result is improvements in the lives of so many.</p>
<p>So I think that is the encouragement I give.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also say, if you&rsquo;re looking at this ugliness</p>
<p>of this debate that&rsquo;s happened over the pandemic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say to young people,</p>
<p>we need you to come in and help transform it.</p>
<p>Many of the people you see in this debate</p>
<p>that behave poorly, I ask you forgive them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done my best to try,</p>
<p>because many of them are acting out of their own sense</p>
<p>that they need to do good,</p>
<p>but the mistake they&rsquo;ve made is in this arrogance</p>
<p>and this power.</p>
<p>So when you come in, remember that example</p>
<p>as a negative example.</p>
<p>And so that when you join the debate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll join it in a spirit of humility</p>
<p>and a spirit of trying to learn</p>
<p>while keeping that love that led you</p>
<p>to enter the field in the first place.</p>
<p>And yeah, choose forgiveness versus like derision.</p>
<p>Like the people that you know have messed up,</p>
<p>like give them a pass,</p>
<p>because it feels like that&rsquo;s how improvement starts.</p>
<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve been thinking this is like,</p>
<p>I told you I&rsquo;m Christian, right?</p>
<p>So like God has given me many opportunities</p>
<p>to forgive people, learned to practice how to do that.</p>
<p>Gave you a gift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very humbling thing, I guess.</p>
<p>Is there a memory from when you were young</p>
<p>that was very formative to you?</p>
<p>So you just gave advice to some young people.</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out to you</p>
<p>that a decision you made, an event that happened</p>
<p>that made you the man you are today?</p>
<p>I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment.</p>
<p>Like I was born in India and we moved when I was four.</p>
<p>My dad had eight brothers and sisters</p>
<p>and my mom had four brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>She grew up in the slum in Calcutta.</p>
<p>My dad, his dad died when he was young</p>
<p>and he supported his family, his brothers and sisters</p>
<p>with university scholarship money.</p>
<p>Came to the US and my dad worked in a McDonald&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s an electrical engineer,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t find a job in 1971.</p>
<p>And so he worked at McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We lived in a, like this, basically the housing port</p>
<p>like development in Cambridge,</p>
<p>this like this middle building on the 17th floor,</p>
<p>this like housing development.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that was transformative for me.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t realize so much at the time</p>
<p>how that experience of being essentially like poor,</p>
<p>lower middle class, what effect it had on my outlook.</p>
<p>You mentioned to me offline</p>
<p>that you listened to the conversation</p>
<p>that I had with my dad.</p>
<p>What impact did your dad have on your life?</p>
<p>What memories do you have about him?</p>
<p>He was a rocket scientist actually.</p>
<p>He helped design rocket guidance systems.</p>
<p>He died when I was 20 and I still miss him to this day.</p>
<p>And I think that experience of seeing him</p>
<p>sacrifice himself for his family, brilliant man,</p>
<p>but in many ways frustrated with like his opportunities</p>
<p>in the world, which is probably what led him</p>
<p>to come to the US in the first place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s transformed, that&rsquo;s had a transformative effect on me</p>
<p>and I wish I could tell him that looking back.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Your dad is no longer with us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the old wise sage that represents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only worried about death once in this pandemic.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve had two, my cousin was 73</p>
<p>and my uncle who&rsquo;s 74 died in India during the pandemic.</p>
<p>And I grieve them both from COVID.</p>
<p>Like the fear of COVID really has only hit me</p>
<p>only really once during this and it wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>And I recognize it&rsquo;s irrational.</p>
<p>So on the eve of the Santa Clara County seroprevalence study,</p>
<p>it was a really interesting thing</p>
<p>because so many people volunteered to help.</p>
<p>And my daughter who&rsquo;s 20, I guess she was 19 at the time</p>
<p>and my wife also volunteered to help</p>
<p>with like various aspects of the study.</p>
<p>And so the eve of the study,</p>
<p>they were going to go out in public</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what the death rate was</p>
<p>because we hadn&rsquo;t done the study.</p>
<p>And I suspected it was lower than people were saying</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I knew about the age gradient</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d seen the Chinese data and my daughter&rsquo;s young</p>
<p>but my wife is my age and I didn&rsquo;t know the death rate.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t sleep the night before.</p>
<p>Like what if I&rsquo;m putting my family,</p>
<p>my daughter and my wife at risk</p>
<p>because of some activity that I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>It was kind of, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it was.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s worried about the wellbeing of others.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror.</p>
<p>If I die, I die.</p>
<p>I mean, like I just, it&rsquo;s not, again, I&rsquo;m Christian.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, death is not the end for me, I believe.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t particularly worried about my own death</p>
<p>but I do, I mean, I just, I think we can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>but we worry about the wellbeing of our loved ones.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of God, then let me ask you,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning</p>
<p>of this whole journey we&rsquo;re on?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>Love one another.</p>
<p>Treat your neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s love, as simple as that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d love to see a little bit more of that</p>
<p>in this pandemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve seen some of the worst</p>
<p>but I think some of that is just good therapy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping in the end, what we have here is love.</p>
<p>At the very least, make your dad proud</p>
<p>with some incredible rockets that we&rsquo;re launching.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d get along well with my dad, Lex.</p>
<p>I definitely would.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been an inspiration to so many people</p>
<p>and keep fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending your valuable time</p>
<p>with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here, appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jay Bhattacharya.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you some words from Alice Walker.</p>
<p>The most common way people give up their power</p>
<p>is by thinking they don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
