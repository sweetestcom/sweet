    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>There was a lot of big news, obviously this past week, when a leaked draft of the Supreme</p>
<p>Court&rsquo;s Roe v. Wade decision was published by Politico. The draft opinion written by Justice</p>
<p>Alito would turn Roe v. Wade from a federal issue to a state issue. Now, this is a bit above all of</p>
<p>our pay grades, so Chamath had a really great idea to tap some people who are actual experts</p>
<p>in the Supreme Court. Chamath, maybe you could introduce our guests.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>And queue this up for us. Thank you.</p>
<p>Great. So first, I&rsquo;d like to introduce Amy Howe. Amy, until 2016, served as the editor</p>
<p>and a reporter for SCOTUSblog, which is the premier blog that covers the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>She continues to serve as an independent contractor and reporter for SCOTUSblog.</p>
<p>She also writes for her blog called Howe on the Court. And before turning to full-time blogging,</p>
<p>she was a counsel in over two dozen merits cases at the Supreme Court and argued two cases there.</p>
<p>From 2004 until 2011, she co-taught Supreme Court litigation at Stanford Law School. And from</p>
<p>2005 to 2013, she co-taught a similar class at Harvard Law School. And I&rsquo;d also like to introduce</p>
<p>her partner in SCOTUS and also her partner in life, Tom Goldstein, another dear friend of mine.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, Tom has served as one of the lawyers for one of the parties in just</p>
<p>under 10% of all the cases argued before the Supreme Court. He has argued 43 cases himself</p>
<p>and two that I think are probably a little bit near and dear to all of our hearts. In 2000,</p>
<p>Tom served as second chair for Lawrence Tribe and David Bowies on behalf of Vice President Al Gore</p>
<p>and Bush v. Gore. And most recently, he represented Google in a fair use copyright infringement case,</p>
<p>Google v. Oracle, about the use of Java APIs. And so Tom and Amy, thank you guys for giving us</p>
<p>your precious time. Welcome to the pod.</p>
<p>Thanks for having us.</p>
<p>Thanks for having us. I was a little nervous about what the introduction was going to be like,</p>
<p>so thank you.</p>
<p>So guys, there&rsquo;s a million questions to start with or that we can go, but maybe just to frame</p>
<p>the issue. Can you guys just first walk us through the original Roe v. Wade decision,</p>
<p>how it was made, and the rights that it conferred? And then maybe we can go from there and talk</p>
<p>about what has happened as a result of the way it was written and the judgment as it stood.</p>
<p>Sure. Roe v. Wade, back in the early 1970s, was a decision by Justice Harry Blackmun,</p>
<p>in which the court held for the first time that there is a constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p>And at that point, the court ruled that it was regulated by time up through the trimesters.</p>
<p>Am I getting this right, Tom?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then in 1992, in a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey,</p>
<p>that was an earlier effort to overrule Roe v. Wade because abortion opponents started</p>
<p>pretty quickly trying to overturn Roe v. Wade. And so in 1992, in a case called Planned Parenthood</p>
<p>v. Casey, the Supreme Court did not overrule Roe. In fact, reaffirmed it, but switched the test a</p>
<p>little bit, the constitutional test, to decide whether other abortion restrictions can stand.</p>
<p>And this was a decision by Justices David Souter, Anthony Kennedy, and Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor,</p>
<p>who were all appointed by Republican presidents. And they said there&rsquo;s a constitutional right to</p>
<p>an abortion up until the point at which the fetus becomes viable, which these days is</p>
<p>somewhere around the 24th week of pregnancy. But states can regulate abortions as long as</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t impose an undue burden on the woman&rsquo;s right to an abortion.</p>
<p>I was just going to tack on what&rsquo;s sitting underneath Roe, because that ends up being</p>
<p>a big deal these days. You know, where did it come from? Seven justices in Roe v. Wade say</p>
<p>there is this constitutional right to an abortion up to a point. And of course, there&rsquo;s no textual</p>
<p>reference to abortion in the Constitution. Instead, the Supreme Court drew on earlier decisions</p>
<p>involving what was called the constitutional right to privacy, essentially a kind of bodily</p>
<p>autonomy right, an individual liberty principle that you&rsquo;re going to control your own destiny</p>
<p>and your own body, drawing on cases involving contraception, for example, for both married and</p>
<p>unmarried couples. And that really is the doctrinal, the jurisprudential piece of this thing</p>
<p>that conservatives have been after so hard. You&rsquo;ve got kind of two branches of conservatism in play.</p>
<p>One is, look, kind of religious and social conservatism that abortion is evil. And then</p>
<p>you have a jurisprudential lawyers kind of thing, like you made this up. It&rsquo;s not in the Constitution.</p>
<p>And those two threads have come together and have been at the root of this 50-year battle over Roe.</p>
<p>In fact, before we unpack that, maybe you want to just define for people, as I understood as I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been learning about this this week, there&rsquo;s this one sort of moral spectrum between liberalism</p>
<p>and conservatism. But then there&rsquo;s this orthogonal form of like originalism, I guess is what folks</p>
<p>call it. Can you just define those terms so everybody understands what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Sure. So, you know, in ordinary politics, we do think of conservatism and then kind of more</p>
<p>libertarianism, a kind of Peter Thiel, get the government out of my life. And conservatives</p>
<p>do believe that the government has an important role, frequently conservatives believe this,</p>
<p>an important role in regulating abortion and prohibiting abortion, whereas a libertarian</p>
<p>would be more likely to say, no, this is my body, my choice, for example. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of along the political spectrum. In the legal spectrum, you have this sense of people,</p>
<p>there are a set of conservatives in particular, principally, who think that the Constitution</p>
<p>should be interpreted today the way that it would have been understood the day that it was enacted,</p>
<p>or that an amendment to the Constitution was enacted. So that the 14th Amendment to the</p>
<p>Constitution, for example, prohibits depriving someone of liberty or property without due</p>
<p>process of law. And they would say, well, what was due process of law at that time?</p>
<p>What was liberty at that time? Whereas a more progressive constitutionalist, somebody more on</p>
<p>the left would say, look, no, there are lots of things that aren&rsquo;t enumerated in the Constitution,</p>
<p>including, you know, a right to bodily autonomy at all, the right to contraception, the right even</p>
<p>rights even conservatives care about the right to educate your child in the way that you see fit.</p>
<p>And the Constitution, in particular, has to be able to adapt to modern circumstances. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why actually our Constitution is so vague. There are lots of more modern constitutions, take the</p>
<p>South African Constitution, that have lots and lots and lots and lots of detailed provisions</p>
<p>tackling all kinds of problems, including modern problems. But the view of progressive</p>
<p>constitutionalists is that, look, when the country was founded, and they wrote the Constitution,</p>
<p>they knew the country was going to be around for centuries. And they didn&rsquo;t intend to capture every</p>
<p>kind of social circumstance that intend to capture every modern problem, which couldn&rsquo;t even be</p>
<p>contemplated. So yeah, that&rsquo;s the those are the two different kinds of conservatism we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about. But both originalists say, look, there&rsquo;s no right to abortion in the Constitution, the founders</p>
<p>of the country would have never imagined that we would strike down bans on abortion. And then social</p>
<p>conservatives are like, well, this is a really, really important role of government. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>protecting unborn life.</p>
<p>Amy, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve had a chance to read Alito&rsquo;s draft opinion. But can you sort of walk</p>
<p>us through his legal framework for coming to his conclusion that that this thing needs to be struck</p>
<p>down and what why he&rsquo;s saying what he&rsquo;s saying?</p>
<p>Yes, it is a 67 page opinion with another 30 pages or so in the appendix. And what he tackles it</p>
<p>in two ways. The first is kind of from this originalist perspective. He looks at the idea</p>
<p>of whether or not the right to an abortion is something that is deeply rooted in our country&rsquo;s</p>
<p>history. And he concludes that it is not that not only was there no right to an abortion, he said,</p>
<p>until the late 20th century, when right around the time that the court issued his decision in</p>
<p>Roe. But in fact, abortion was a crime in many places. And so he starts from that premise that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no deeply rooted tradition of abortion being a right in under the Constitution. And</p>
<p>that goes to the idea of what did the framers intend? Does it fall within this fundamental</p>
<p>right that would be protected by the Constitution, even if it is not specifically enumerated in the</p>
<p>Constitution? But then he also has to look at Roe and Casey, because those laws have been in effect,</p>
<p>that those cases have been in effect for 50 years now, that the court issued this decision in Roe</p>
<p>in the early 70s, and then reaffirmed it in Casey in 1992. Because the Supreme Court and courts</p>
<p>generally have a principle called stare decisis that says that courts should not overturn their</p>
<p>decisions just because they think the earlier decisions are wrong, that there needs to be a</p>
<p>good reason to do that. And the court has never said specifically exactly what you need to do</p>
<p>to overrule a decision. But over the years, they have outlined some factors that you can look at</p>
<p>to decide whether or not you should do so. And so he walks through those factors, the idea that Roe</p>
<p>and Casey were simply wrong when they were decided for the reasons that Tom has just</p>
<p>discussed and that Alita discusses at great length, that there&rsquo;s no deeply rooted tradition</p>
<p>of abortion being a right. Another thing that courts often look at is whether or not people</p>
<p>have relied on the court&rsquo;s decisions here in Roe and Casey. And he said that even in Casey,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t this idea that people arrange their personal lives, you know, in the short term around</p>
<p>the idea that they have a right to an abortion. They&rsquo;ve looked at it in Casey and sort of in</p>
<p>people since then, in sort of the broader sense, that women have made decisions about their lives,</p>
<p>so with the idea that they will have reproductive freedom. And he says that&rsquo;s really not the right</p>
<p>way to look at the issue of reliance. He looks at whether or not the test that the Supreme Court has</p>
<p>and other courts have been using to review restrictions on abortion, this undue burden</p>
<p>standard, is what he calls workable. And he concludes that it&rsquo;s not workable because, he says,</p>
<p>this idea of an undue burden test is so amorphous that courts have reached all kinds of different</p>
<p>decisions on various abortion restrictions. And so for those reasons, he says, abortion is a</p>
<p>profound immoral question, he says, but it&rsquo;s not one that is protected by the Constitution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question that should be decided by the people and their representatives,</p>
<p>and should go back to the states.</p>
<p>Brenton Burchell Can I just follow up on that point? So I think</p>
<p>a lot of people when they read a headline like Roe v. Wade overturned, they think that the Supreme</p>
<p>Court is directly legislating on the issue of abortion, and it means abortion ban nationwide.</p>
<p>I think that may be even the popular conception of what just happened. Can you just explain that</p>
<p>a little bit more that, you know, what exactly is the Supreme Court deciding on this issue? And</p>
<p>specifically, what the Supreme Court is doing here is more deciding who gets to decide,</p>
<p>rather than issuing policy themselves. Could you explain that for viewers?</p>
<p>Dr. Nicholas Breyfogle And as you do that, maybe you could just</p>
<p>highlight the role the Supreme Court is meant to have in our system of government,</p>
<p>just as a basic kind of concept, which I&rsquo;m not sure is like, as clearly understood here.</p>
<p>Brenton Burchell Sure. So, you know,</p>
<p>there are the three branches of government, the president, the executive branch, the legislative</p>
<p>branch, which is Congress, and the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court&rsquo;s job is to,</p>
<p>in this case, interpret the Constitution. Some of the cases that come to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>are technical, they don&rsquo;t even involve the Constitution. What did Congress</p>
<p>mean to say when it enacted this law about bankruptcy? But then it also gets these really</p>
<p>momentous cases like abortion. And this case is a challenge, the actual case that came to the</p>
<p>Supreme Court, is a challenge to a Mississippi law that was passed with the idea that it could</p>
<p>go to the Supreme Court and challenge Roe and Casey, but a Mississippi law that was passed</p>
<p>a couple of years ago that would ban virtually all abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.</p>
<p>And so abortion providers in Mississippi went to court and said, under the Supreme Court&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jurisprudence, these decisions in Roe and Casey, this law is unconstitutional because women,</p>
<p>you know, as the law currently stands, have a right to an abortion up until the point at which</p>
<p>the fetus becomes viable, which is around 24 weeks, but is certainly well after the 15th week</p>
<p>of pregnancy. So the case made its way up there as a challenge to this Mississippi law. But the</p>
<p>state of Mississippi, in defending the law, specifically asked the court to overrule Roe</p>
<p>and Casey. And so what that means is the Supreme Court is deciding whether or not this law is</p>
<p>unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court, as the draft opinion suggests, holds that</p>
<p>the law is constitutional, that Roe and Casey should be overruled, then the issue does go back</p>
<p>to the states, is the way that most people think of it. And each state, whether it&rsquo;s Mississippi</p>
<p>or Texas or Oklahoma or California, can decide for itself whether or not they want to allow</p>
<p>abortions, and if so, on what terms. You know, I think it&rsquo;s a little bit, you know, it does go</p>
<p>back to the states, the people can decide. But defenders of Roe and Casey, supporters of abortion</p>
<p>rights say that part of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s job is to say what the Constitution means, and that</p>
<p>there are some rights, like freedom of speech, you know, the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms</p>
<p>that are, if they&rsquo;re in the Constitution, then the states shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to decide that</p>
<p>the Supreme Court&rsquo;s job is to protect them. So if they strike this down, basically, all the state</p>
<p>legislatures will start to pass their own laws that govern what happens in that state, and the</p>
<p>federal government will not have a role or a say, ultimately, in state abortion laws. Is that</p>
<p>fair? Is that what&rsquo;s going to happen next, if this gets struck down? Yes, I mean, there are already,</p>
<p>you know, at least a dozen, if not more states that have what&rsquo;s called trigger laws that have</p>
<p>already been passed by the state legislature, with an eye towards this decision or some other</p>
<p>decision by the Supreme Court, over ruling Roe and Casey. So those states wouldn&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>pass new laws, those laws restricting abortion would go into effect immediately. And can I just</p>
<p>ask, maybe for sex to like, why, why isn&rsquo;t there a constitutional amendment, if this is a,</p>
<p>an issue that folks feel, you know, should be kind of indoctrinated as an amendment to the</p>
<p>Constitution? Why has that not happened? And, you know, why do these cases kind of keep recycling,</p>
<p>and the decision making kind of keeps going back to the states, and they keep getting litigated?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t constitutional amendments get passed anymore?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to pass a constitutional amendment. I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I was gonna say, yeah, let me just step back first on this question of states versus</p>
<p>the federal government. So when the Supreme Court says the Constitution doesn&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>a right to an abortion, they aren&rsquo;t technically saying, okay, now it&rsquo;ll be up to the state</p>
<p>legislatures, they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;ll be up to legislatures. So you have to pause on the fact</p>
<p>that it is at this point possible that you could have a federal protection for abortion or a</p>
<p>federal ban on abortion. Then the question would be, is that constitutional? Or is this a states</p>
<p>rights issue where only the states can regulate it? But there is a big, big, big fight looming</p>
<p>in Congress on both sides. The only reason that you&rsquo;re not getting a federal statute when you have</p>
<p>a Democrats in control of the Senate, the House and the presidency, the only reason you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting a federal statute protecting your right to an abortion is the filibuster, essentially.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the</p>
<p>Sorry, just just just just to sorry to interrupt, but a statute is a law,</p>
<p>not a constitutional amendment, right? Can you just distinguish?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. So the Constitution is our founding foundational doctrine document.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what creates the Congress and gives Congress the power to regulate certain things. It creates</p>
<p>the presidency, and it creates the Supreme Court. And so it&rsquo;s the most important thing,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do something that violates the Constitution, then Congress can pass laws,</p>
<p>and states can&rsquo;t do anything that is contrary to either the federal constitution or a federal</p>
<p>statute, unless the Constitution says, oh, only the states can handle this question.</p>
<p>So there would be a big fight over whether abortion is strictly</p>
<p>the regime and strictly the purview of the states to deal with. Then you say, okay,</p>
<p>well, the Constitution stands above everything else, uber all this, why don&rsquo;t we just amend</p>
<p>the Constitution? And as you suggest, we&rsquo;re just not in the business of doing that anymore.</p>
<p>There, we have very few constitutional amendments, and we haven&rsquo;t done it in a long time.</p>
<p>The Constitution imposes all kinds of hurdles in terms of congressional authorization,</p>
<p>state authorization. It&rsquo;s why the Equal Rights Amendment was never passed. It&rsquo;s just incredibly</p>
<p>hard to get the kind of supermajority in the country that you need to amend the Constitution</p>
<p>and our kind of foundational rights. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s made the Supreme Court so important,</p>
<p>by the way. And that is, we have something like the Equal Protection Clause, we have a right to</p>
<p>free speech, we have a right to the free exercise of religion. And those are big capacious phrases</p>
<p>that nobody can objectively tell you what they mean. They mean what five justices of the Supreme</p>
<p>Court say they mean. And that&rsquo;s why there are all these fights over Supreme Court appointments.</p>
<p>Because the justices have enormous power by five, four majorities to fundamentally change the course</p>
<p>of American life. And it can be in a conservative direction or a more liberal direction. Remember,</p>
<p>the most famous thing the Supreme Court has done recently before this decision is recognizing a</p>
<p>right to gay marriage. I want to go there. But just before I go there, I want to go back to</p>
<p>something that Amy mentioned, which is stare decisis, this idea of precedent. My understanding</p>
<p>is that when Supreme Court nominees go through the confirmation process, this is a really important</p>
<p>part of what they&rsquo;re asked, right through their confirmation process. What are your views on stare</p>
<p>decisis? What are your views on Roe? And there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion right now about whether,</p>
<p>you know, specifically Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, who signed up to this Alito draft, at least,</p>
<p>may have lied to Congress in the way that they answered their questions. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>guys can sort of talk us through that, and whether you have an opinion on on on that and</p>
<p>their actual congressional testimony to get confirmed. So what they said, and I went back</p>
<p>actually, and looked at some, although not all of Justice Kavanaugh&rsquo;s confirmation hearings today,</p>
<p>actually, you know, what they said at their confirmation hearings, was that Roe and Casey</p>
<p>were settled law, that Roe has been in effect for 50 years, and then Casey came along and reaffirmed</p>
<p>it. So I think Justice Kavanaugh called it precedent, on top of precedent. So that seems</p>
<p>like stare decisis. It just said in different words, or no. Oh, yeah. And there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>that that all of the nominees that have gone through, have acknowledged, because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just two cases, there are 10 abortion cases, you know, this has been in front of the Supreme Court</p>
<p>ever since 73, over and over and over again, and Casey adopted this framework. And it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>reaffirmed over and over and over. And the court has been moving in a conservative direction,</p>
<p>upholding more abortion restrictions, but the foundation, the core of Roe has been there.</p>
<p>But the issue is this, when someone says, this is a precedent and a super precedent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not saying it cannot be overruled. Everything can be overruled. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why Alito&rsquo;s draft is so strong. It uses a formulation that Kavanaugh has used, which is</p>
<p>egregiously wrong from the start. So that if something is just outrageously, totally wrong,</p>
<p>now, pause to the fact that a super majority of Supreme Court justices have thought it was correct,</p>
<p>including a bunch of Republican appointees.</p>
<p>For 50 years.</p>
<p>Right. And, you know, including the court that first adopted it, but this majority has come up</p>
<p>in a kind of jurisprudential, with a jurisprudential vision that&rsquo;s sufficiently conservative to say,</p>
<p>this is essentially the most outrageous thing the Supreme Court has ever done is Roe,</p>
<p>because it interjected itself without any textual basis into one of the foundational moral debates</p>
<p>of our time, which is what legislature should be handling. So now some of the, you know,</p>
<p>moderate Republicans, Susan Collins, Senator Murkowski, have said they&rsquo;re quite upset about</p>
<p>this because they feel misled. But I think the defenders of the justices would say, well, I mean,</p>
<p>they did say it was precedent or unprecedented, but they didn&rsquo;t say it was immune from being</p>
<p>overruled. And here you go.</p>
<p>Just to add in one tiny little detail in the draft opinion by Justice Alito,</p>
<p>is that one of the things he talks about when he&rsquo;s outlining the principle of stare decisis,</p>
<p>he says that this principle is actually at its weakest in cases like this one involving</p>
<p>the interpretation of the Constitution, because only the Supreme Court gets to say what the</p>
<p>Constitution means. And at some point, you don&rsquo;t want to sort of trundle along with an</p>
<p>interpretation of the Constitution that is, as Tom suggested, egregiously wrong. He said,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re talking about a Supreme Court decision interpreting</p>
<p>a law that was passed by Congress, if Congress doesn&rsquo;t like that decision, they can get together</p>
<p>and pass a new law, but only the Supreme Court can say what the law is. So I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>obviously, I&rsquo;m not defending the Alito opinion, that&rsquo;s not my job as a reporter, but</p>
<p>that is, I think, one of the points that someone would make in explaining why</p>
<p>this, despite what they said at their confirmation hearings, if they voted to overrule Rowan Casey.</p>
<p>I have a, I&rsquo;d like to ask a question first, which is, I think this is really fascinating,</p>
<p>like the history of it, it&rsquo;s amazing for you to really unpack it for us. I want to ask a</p>
<p>human question here. And maybe because these judges are humans, and there&rsquo;s like a sentiment</p>
<p>here, where the majority of the country does not want to do this. It&rsquo;s been the law for</p>
<p>generations of women have had this protection, it&rsquo;s been 50 years. So I think the question a lot</p>
<p>of us have watching all this is, why is this happening right now? And is this some, you know,</p>
<p>strategy that&rsquo;s been played out to overturn this, because it feels profoundly unfair to take a right</p>
<p>away from these generations of women. And there&rsquo;s this anger that&rsquo;s built up of how on earth could</p>
<p>this happen. So maybe you could tell us about the humans who are in these positions of power,</p>
<p>and why they made this decision, because we can look at all these laws and the precedent.</p>
<p>But there is also the reality that the deck has been stacked with this court,</p>
<p>it seems quite strategically. And this feels like a rug pull to a lot of the people who voted these</p>
<p>people on. And now you have a large group of the country who feels like this is exactly the</p>
<p>opposite of what the majority of us want. So can you explain that to us what&rsquo;s going on here with</p>
<p>these humans who have these positions of power and authority? Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a fair</p>
<p>characterization of what is a majority of the country that is to varying degrees, pro choice.</p>
<p>Now, we ought to pause and recognize that there is another significant part of the country for</p>
<p>whom this is, you know, an incredibly important positive moment. The country is divided on this</p>
<p>question. There are passionate views on both sides. The women who are directly affected,</p>
<p>many of them will feel no doubt incredibly impassioned strongly that this is an outrage.</p>
<p>But there are activists on both sides. And yes, from the day that Roe was decided,</p>
<p>there has been an unflinching commitment among conservatives to undo it. And it has taken them</p>
<p>five decades to do it. But they have marched forward from that position where they were</p>
<p>losing seven to two in the Supreme Court till June of this year, where they will likely win</p>
<p>five to four. And they have worked tirelessly to put justices on the Supreme Court who would be</p>
<p>willing to take this step. They thought that John Roberts would, and it appears that he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>likely willing to cut back on Roe, but not overrule it entirely. But that the other conservatives,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s been on for a while, like Justice Thomas, or instead,</p>
<p>much more recent appointments, which is in Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and in Barrett, and Justice</p>
<p>Alito having been on the court for a while. Those people, this is the number one agenda</p>
<p>item for what they believe is correcting the course of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation</p>
<p>of the Constitution, that this was the one that was most out of bounds, because it was the most</p>
<p>made up in their mind. Now, we should talk a little bit about what it&rsquo;s going to mean for</p>
<p>other areas of the law, like gay rights and that sort of thing. But in a very human sense, there</p>
<p>has been an utter human commitment by pro-life forces to stop what they regard as the murder of</p>
<p>millions of unborn children, and an unbelievable commitment among pro-choice forces to maintain</p>
<p>what is a basic individual liberty. Yeah, I just wanted to add, I mean,</p>
<p>I think I agree with everything that Tom said. And I think in particular, you have to look at,</p>
<p>you know, go back to 2015, and then in particular, the 2016 election. Donald Trump</p>
<p>was elected, you know, in no small part because he pledged to put justices on the court who would</p>
<p>overrule Roe and Casey. You know, you had conservatives who weren&rsquo;t quite sure about him,</p>
<p>but felt so strongly about this issue that they were willing to go to the ballot box</p>
<p>and vote for him because they trusted him based on including like a list of Supreme Court</p>
<p>potential nominees that he released before the 2016 election, which is something that nobody</p>
<p>had done before, but I think worked out very well for him. You know, and then, you know,</p>
<p>sort of compare that with people, as Tom said, on this issue, people who opposed abortion were often</p>
<p>single issue voters. You know, in the 2016 elections, you had, you know, the</p>
<p>the butter emails crowd who weren&rsquo;t necessarily going to go to the polls for Hillary Clinton,</p>
<p>even though they likely would be abortion rights supporters. And, you know, often just like not,</p>
<p>I think there was probably an element of disbelief, the idea that this right was so</p>
<p>solidly enshrined in American constitutional law, that that it would stand despite who might</p>
<p>be on the court. So, Amy, I want to ask a jump question from here. Then this is an issue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close to all of us. When we read Roe v. Wade, we were I think we were all like a little shocked,</p>
<p>like, wow, this is happening. And then the second wave of news was how this created potential to</p>
<p>undo Obergefell, right? So the gay rights law, or even like interracial marriage, you know,</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s in an interracial marriage, I am, you know, many of our friends are, are gay and married.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to think about what this does precedentially? And does it create risk that all</p>
<p>those rights could be taken away from us or our people that we care about? Like, is that something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible here?</p>
<p>I mean, I do think there&rsquo;s a lot of those rights are going to be challenged. Justice Alito,</p>
<p>in this draft opinion, says no, those rights are different, you know, because only abortion</p>
<p>rests on the purposeful termination of a human life. But, you know, to go back to what Tom</p>
<p>talked about earlier, you know, those rights rest, you know, are also not in the Constitution,</p>
<p>rest on this same sort of principle called, you know, substantive, substantive due process,</p>
<p>you know, rest on a right to privacy. And there were definitely arguments made in the Supreme</p>
<p>Court in the Mississippi case, not by Mississippi, but by groups supporting Mississippi, that if you</p>
<p>overrule Roe and Casey, you do have to go back and look at these other rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the reasoning for overruling Roe is by and large, the same reason that you would</p>
<p>overrule Obergefell. Obergefell is a much less well settled precedent. You know, it hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as opposed to Roe many, many, many times. You can just as easily say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an issue for the states. And when you see in Justice Alito&rsquo;s, what you see is two things in</p>
<p>Justice Alito&rsquo;s opinion, a bunch of reasoning that would be used to strike down a bunch of</p>
<p>other rights go all the way back to where do we think we find the right to contraception?</p>
<p>But where is that? And the Supreme Court, both with respect to married and unmarried couples,</p>
<p>said there&rsquo;s a right to contraception, but it&rsquo;s not in the text of the Constitution.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that&rsquo;s not in the text of the Constitution. As I said,</p>
<p>the Constitution is super vague. So, you have a bunch of stuff in Alito&rsquo;s opinion that says</p>
<p>all of the reasoning that&rsquo;s in those cases, essentially, is wrong. And then you have a</p>
<p>paragraph that says, but, but, but, but, but, by the way, this is just about abortion. Why?</p>
<p>Because it is. And the difficulty is that in a later case, it&rsquo;s much, much, much easier to apply</p>
<p>all the thinking than the truism that this is just about abortion, because this case just is</p>
<p>about abortion. But I think what&rsquo;s very likely is, you know, I&rsquo;m a legal realist, and that is,</p>
<p>I think that the justices decide what they want to do, and then they write the opinion that gets</p>
<p>theirs. When the court voted to overrule Roe, when five justices did that after the oral argument in</p>
<p>this Dobbs case, one or more of the justices said, okay, I&rsquo;ll join an opinion overruling Roe,</p>
<p>if it is absolutely clear that it will not lead to the overruling of these other things. And so,</p>
<p>Justice Alito put that in there. He doesn&rsquo;t believe it for a second that those decisions</p>
<p>are rightly, that those rulings should necessarily stand. But it appears that they don&rsquo;t have five</p>
<p>votes for that view. But look, they didn&rsquo;t have five votes for overruling Roe until very, very</p>
<p>recently. And you can put another conservative on the court, or, you know, these five could end up</p>
<p>doing it. It is very much in play, that at the very least, you have to acknowledge that a lot</p>
<p>of things that people thought were kind of foundational bases for how we order our lives,</p>
<p>because they were protected by the Constitution, may well not be anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, I just like isn&rsquo;t there like an element of compassion that has to be a part of</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re supposed to do their job? I mean,</p>
<p>I know five people who disagree with you. It just so happens that they&rsquo;re a majority.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question. Let me ask a question about this sort of parade of horrible. So,</p>
<p>Tom, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying that, that overturning Roe would implicate these other cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and as you mentioned, Alito specifically says, well, presumably it&rsquo;s Alito</p>
<p>in this Dobbs decision, those cases are not affected. So, he does carve out this case</p>
<p>specifically. But this, but separate from that, this Supreme Court just two years ago in Boston</p>
<p>v. Clayton County, read, you know, LGBTQ rights into Title VII. And that opinion was written by</p>
<p>Gorsuch, with Roberts joining him, you know, and I think it was, that was a 6-3 majority.</p>
<p>So, the idea that this Supreme Court would overturn, you know, marriage equality, you know,</p>
<p>which was just written by Kennedy in 2015. I mean,</p>
<p>I understand that you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s possible, but is it really likely?</p>
<p>Well, look, BOSIC is totally different. It&rsquo;s interpreting a federal statute,</p>
<p>a law that Congress passed. That&rsquo;s their point. The conservative&rsquo;s view is like,</p>
<p>okay, Congress passes a law to protect, you know, same-sex marriage, fantastic, have at it.</p>
<p>And if it is passed Title VII to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,</p>
<p>fine. We don&rsquo;t have a problem with that. But it&rsquo;s, our problem is interpreting the Constitution</p>
<p>to strike down those laws. Do you say, is it likely? You know, it is a bizarre circumstance,</p>
<p>because doctrinally, when we think as lawyers, when we think as judges, it should be much harder</p>
<p>to overturn Roe v. Wade, because we do have, this is a lot of water under a lot of bridges.</p>
<p>Whereas with same-sex marriage, it&rsquo;s a pretty new thing that we&rsquo;ve recognized in the Constitution.</p>
<p>And if you say, look, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the founders of the Constitution,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about originalism. I&rsquo;m going to give you two propositions. You tell me</p>
<p>which one is more likely. And that is, in the year 1800, someone said, given the choice,</p>
<p>do we protect a woman&rsquo;s right to have an abortion, say, in the instance of rape or</p>
<p>incest or something like that? Or we&rsquo;re going to say that there&rsquo;s a constitutional right for two</p>
<p>men to marry each other. This is not close. It is just not close. Now, I believe in both of those</p>
<p>rights, but nobody seriously would say that the founders of the country, in enacting and</p>
<p>adopting the Constitution, thought that they were protecting same-sex marriage. And if you want to</p>
<p>look at it from that perspective, and this opinion does, then Obergefell is just an easy target,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>In order for the sort of the parade of horribles to happen, though,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a two-step process, right? The first step is the Supreme Court throws it back</p>
<p>to the legislature. Then the legislature has to do something that you think is appalling.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you know, marriage equality is now popular as a position in both parties,</p>
<p>right? So, the idea that even if that decision was overturned, that all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you would have a change in that law seems unlikely, right?</p>
<p>No. No, because all that has to happen is that a court clerk in rural Texas says,</p>
<p>I refuse to sign this marriage certificate. Remember, a lot of these statutes haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>formally been withdrawn. They haven&rsquo;t been, they&rsquo;re sitting on the books. They&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>invalid. So, too, with Roe, there are a bunch of statutes on the books that are abortion</p>
<p>restrictions that everybody knows are unconstitutional. They&rsquo;re not enforced.</p>
<p>Those are in states, you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. And so, too, with respect to gay marriage. And all other kinds,</p>
<p>lots and lots of other, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of statutes</p>
<p>that discriminated against gay couples and gay individuals and the LGBTQ community. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bunches of that stuff still on the books. And all it takes is for one conservative to say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m going to apply those laws. Let&rsquo;s go. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. The attorney general</p>
<p>of Texas has said, look, I&rsquo;m now, see, I heard what&rsquo;s going to happen with Roe. I&rsquo;m now looking</p>
<p>at Plyler versus Doe. That&rsquo;s the constitutional decision that says states have to educate</p>
<p>children no matter whether or not they&rsquo;re lawfully in the country or not. I mean,</p>
<p>this is going to be extremely motivating and extremely animating to conservative legislatures,</p>
<p>to conservative attorneys general in the states. Everything&rsquo;s now in play. It&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give it a shot. Let&rsquo;s take it up to the Supreme Court. It can get worse from the conservative</p>
<p>perspective. They&rsquo;ve already lost on some of these issues. And so, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a scary quarter century.</p>
<p>It seems to me, Amy, the, we grew up, I&rsquo;m of Gen X, 51 years old, with this profound respect</p>
<p>for the Supreme Court, that it felt fair, it felt just, it felt like the one institution</p>
<p>that was above politics. And now it feels, because of flipping a 50 year old law, as if it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and these, you know, sort of, you know, the interview process when they were being confirmed,</p>
<p>and maybe the rug pulling there, that we can&rsquo;t trust it, and then this leak happens. So,</p>
<p>now it all feels like this institution is not trustworthy, is biased, is political.</p>
<p>So, were we living under a mirage that it wasn&rsquo;t? Or has something fundamentally changed</p>
<p>when we look at the Supreme Court, and how they&rsquo;re behaving now? That&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling with is, was I just, you know, living under a false vision of this institution,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m seeing reality? Or has something actually changed with the court? And should we,</p>
<p>as a country, be looking at the court differently?</p>
<p>I mean, I think at least one thing that has changed is that right up until the point,</p>
<p>you know, in the last 10 years, when Justices David Souter and John Paul Stevens retired,</p>
<p>and then Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018, you know, people who are sitting on the Supreme Court,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t always, you know, people did not always have the sense that they were</p>
<p>voting in the same way as the party that put them on the court. You know, Justices Souter</p>
<p>and Stevens, it really had become a solid part of the court&rsquo;s liberal wing by the time they retired.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy was still a conservative, but he was a conservative, you know, who provided</p>
<p>the key votes on things like same-sex marriage, and whether or not there is a right to be intimate</p>
<p>with somebody of the same gender. And so you just didn&rsquo;t, I think people looked at the court</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t think those decisions are political, you know, they&rsquo;re not always dividing</p>
<p>five to four on sort of so-called party lines. I think that has changed,</p>
<p>and I think some of the confirmation hearings, I think, in particular,</p>
<p>Democrats and progressives feel that at least one of the seats, either Justice Gorsuch or</p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was stolen, in effect, because Justice Scalia died in February of 2016.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to have hearings for President Obama&rsquo;s nominee,</p>
<p>saying the next president has to decide, you know, you can agree with that, you can disagree</p>
<p>with that. But then Justice Ginsburg dies in September 2020, and the Republicans rush to put</p>
<p>someone, now Justice Barrett, on the court before the presidential election. And so I think people</p>
<p>do just, I think there is a general sense that it is more political than it used to be.</p>
<p>What about the leak, Tom? You just wrote about that, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, can I just say, one other thing was happening, Jason, and that was you were winning.</p>
<p>I mean, people think the Supreme Court is political when they don&rsquo;t like what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And so when there was a right to an abortion, when the Affordable Care Act is being upheld,</p>
<p>when Obergefell is being decided in favor of same-sex marriage, you and me tend to think of</p>
<p>that as, oh, that&rsquo;s just the way the Constitution should be. We&rsquo;ve got an objective, sensible set</p>
<p>of justices. And then we start losing, and we get the perspective that the other side</p>
<p>ideologically has had. They think the Supreme Court&rsquo;s been super political in Roe, in Casey,</p>
<p>and Obergefell, and in the ACA, because they think the Constitution means the opposite. And so they</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve got a bunch of, that the court has been way too liberal and way too ends-oriented.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no objective answer with respect to most constitutional questions,</p>
<p>because the document&rsquo;s so vague, we have this notion of what&rsquo;s judicial activism? Well,</p>
<p>judicial activism is losing. Because if you win, then obviously, it&rsquo;s what the Constitution was</p>
<p>meant to be from the beginning. And so we do have this, the perception of any individual about the</p>
<p>Supreme Court, and whether it&rsquo;s neutral and objective, or instead, political and biased,</p>
<p>tends to be rooted 95% on whether you like what it&rsquo;s doing or not. So, I&rsquo;d love to hear from-</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very fair observation. I mean, even its fans would admit the Warren Court was a highly</p>
<p>activist court. So, I think you tend to think of the court as being activist to the extent that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like the results. Although, obviously, there are more or less incremental approaches</p>
<p>that one could take. Actually, in this decision, it looks like Roberts was angling for the</p>
<p>incrementalist approach here, which was to-</p>
<p>Explain what incrementalist means in this context, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think incremental, there was, I&rsquo;m not sure, I guess, it just, you can call it whatever you</p>
<p>want. So, at the oral argument in December, one of the alternative grounds that Mississippi had</p>
<p>offered was to still uphold their law, but not formally overrule Roe v. Casey. And at the oral</p>
<p>argument, Roberts seemed to be the only person who was interested in that alternative ground.</p>
<p>So, that would still be a major shift in abortion rights laws, but it would not formally overrule</p>
<p>Roe v. Casey.</p>
<p>In that moment, and please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, the Biden administration also said they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want that nuanced decision. They wanted Roe voted up or down in its entirety. Is that right?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that nobody, including the lawyers,</p>
<p>liked the alternative ground. I think that is right.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s an optical illusion. The chief is a sophisticated guy who is very aware of all</p>
<p>these issues related to public opinion and the court. He knows how strident the reaction would</p>
<p>be and will be if Roe v. Wade is overruled. And so, he&rsquo;d rather take this step by step and kind</p>
<p>of like turn up the temperature of the water to a slower boil so that it&rsquo;s less of a surprise if</p>
<p>and when Roe v. Wade is overruled five years from now, because he doesn&rsquo;t have to go that far today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you know, movement conservatives realize, look, you know, Justice Scalia died,</p>
<p>a lot can change. We&rsquo;ve got our shot. Let&rsquo;s take it right now. And at least at the initial vote,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to be super aggressive. And that apparent, that seems to be the debate that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playing out now. And in these leaks is, you know, what will happen with Kavanaugh and Barrett? And</p>
<p>will they go with the chief or instead with Alito&rsquo;s stronger opinion?</p>
<p>Exactly. So, this is what I wanted to ask both of you. How does this play out from here inside</p>
<p>the court itself? And is there a chance that this draft isn&rsquo;t the ultimate decision? Is there a way</p>
<p>that there can be a middle ground path? Like, what happens from here? Or is this basically</p>
<p>a fait accompli as as as written right now?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll let Tom talk about the leak. And he&rsquo;s got some theories about what might have happened.</p>
<p>It is, this is the first draft, you can see that on the copy that Politico published.</p>
<p>And it is from apparently from back in February, the argument was in December.</p>
<p>Nobody expected to get the decision in this case, and all likelihood until</p>
<p>late June. And so, you know, I do think that there is a chance that the opinion could change</p>
<p>in some way, it might not have quite as strong a tone. Or, you know, it&rsquo;s possible that what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on behind the scenes, and we just don&rsquo;t know it, is some sort of effort to move justices</p>
<p>away from this opinion to this alternative ground that the chief was advocating for at the oral</p>
<p>argument in December, you know, I&rsquo;ll let Tom talk about some of the theories that he has,</p>
<p>you know, one of the things that somebody who actually gets to go to the oral arguments right</p>
<p>now, when you are at the oral arguments, in any case, but in particular, this case, you know,</p>
<p>the justices are talking to the lawyers, asking the lawyers questions, trying to flesh out what</p>
<p>their positions are, you know, what the possible resolution of the case may be, the justices are</p>
<p>also talking to each other. And so, one thing that was not a leak, but was really interesting</p>
<p>at an oral argument, on April 20, a couple of days before this Wall Street Journal editorial</p>
<p>that Tom is going to talk about, and then a couple of weeks before Politico leaked,</p>
<p>there was a discussion in a case involving the Miranda right, you know, you have the right to</p>
<p>remain silent law, the law and order thing. And the question was whether or not you can bring a</p>
<p>lawsuit, a federal civil rights claim, if your Miranda right has been violated, and so not</p>
<p>anything to do with abortion. But at the oral argument, Justice Kagan starts talking to the</p>
<p>lawyer who&rsquo;s arguing the case about the Miranda decision, there was a Miranda decision in 2000,</p>
<p>and which the Supreme Court by vote of 72, held that Congress cannot overrule Miranda.</p>
<p>And she said, you know, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice at the time,</p>
<p>wrote the decision, and he was someone who made clear that he had not been,</p>
<p>he thought that Miranda was wrong, but nonetheless voted to uphold it because he knew what an effect</p>
<p>overruling something that everyone believes is part of our constitutional landscape, so to speak,</p>
<p>would have on the court&rsquo;s legitimacy. And you really had the sense at that point that she</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t talking about Miranda, that she was talking about Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood</p>
<p>versus Casey in this case, because this was something that this is an issue that Justice</p>
<p>Kavanaugh had raised at his confirmation hearings talking about Rehnquist and Miranda. And so,</p>
<p>you have the sense that maybe things still are in play behind the scenes at the Supreme Court as</p>
<p>recently as, you know, a couple of weeks ago. She wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessarily trying to make this</p>
<p>point if she thought it was set in stone.</p>
<p>Paul Yeah, so a couple of weeks ago,</p>
<p>somebody leaked to the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and this has happened before</p>
<p>a couple of times over the past, you know, decade-ish, that five justices had voted to overrule</p>
<p>Roe, but it was in play and that the Chief Justice was trying to pull along to a more moderate</p>
<p>position, Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett. And it wasn&rsquo;t styled as a leak, but we now know it was a</p>
<p>leak, including because the Wall Street Journal editorial board said, and we think Justice Alito</p>
<p>is writing the opinion out of nowhere. Like, nobody in the world would go on the record saying</p>
<p>that was true unless they knew it. So, they knew what was going on, and that&rsquo;s a very strong</p>
<p>indication that things are still in play. Then with respect to Politico, Politico was told that</p>
<p>five justices had voted to overturn Roe, and that was the current vote, but did not say that five</p>
<p>justices were signed on to this opinion. And that&rsquo;s what happened. So, Justice Alito circulated</p>
<p>this opinion in February, and then he&rsquo;s supposed to get memos back from his majority saying, hey,</p>
<p>Sam, if you make these five changes, I&rsquo;ll join your opinion, and boom, then you&rsquo;ve got an actual</p>
<p>majority for the court. But all that you see from February 10 is this is Sam Alito&rsquo;s view,</p>
<p>and it is the outcome that five people voted for at the Conference of the Justices.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s a bunch missing between February and now in terms of actually getting to a majority.</p>
<p>So, the most likely scenario right now is that it is in play. Now, what does it mean to be in</p>
<p>play? And is it, as I said, an optical illusion? Well, it is not in play whether this statute&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be upheld. What&rsquo;s in play is, are they going to admit to overruling Roe? And how far</p>
<p>are they going to go in doing something that would, for example, uphold a six-week ban?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s states with six-week bans. What about statutes that are total abortion bans?</p>
<p>Are those now constitutional? So, are we going to go step by step, and is this going to be a</p>
<p>five-year process, or is it going to happen on the last day of June of this year? That might</p>
<p>be in play, but people ought not be misled into thinking there&rsquo;s a real, real debate</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in abortion in the Supreme Court. Roe is, on life support, best case.</p>
<p>Is there anything, because the person who leaked this, we would assume, is hoping to make some</p>
<p>change and send this out as a warning sign to the country and the people who want to preserve Roe.</p>
<p>Would we agree on that?</p>
<p>Some people think that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s true. Others think that this was an effort to get</p>
<p>Kavanaugh on record as having voted to overturn Roe and to hold his feet to the fire. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly how I interpret the leak to the Wall Street Journal editorial board. I think the</p>
<p>release of the opinion, however, the distinct, like this piece of paper, is intended to do what</p>
<p>it did, which is to motivate progressive forces and say, wake up, this is really happening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not kidding. You&rsquo;ve been hearing that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s getting more and more conservative,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m telling you, in eight weeks, you don&rsquo;t have a right to an abortion anymore.</p>
<p>You better get your act together.</p>
<p>So the second question is, is there any chance that public sentiment could make a change in the</p>
<p>thinking of the Supreme Court? Is that farcical for us to think? Or are they humans and they see</p>
<p>this and say, you know, we got to dial this back? Or we got to, you know, you know, in somehow,</p>
<p>maybe dampen the blow of this if we are going to overturn it? Could protests,</p>
<p>mass protests and sentiment actually change their thinking, Amy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to say. I mean, I really do think it&rsquo;s probably you&rsquo;re probably talking</p>
<p>about just one or two justices rather than all of the justices as a whole. You know,</p>
<p>because I do think that there is probably a sense among some of the more conservative justices</p>
<p>who would have signed on to this opinion that we are not going to be, we&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>you know, step off the path because somebody leaked this document and people aren&rsquo;t gonna</p>
<p>like it. We&rsquo;re going to stay the course. But, you know, I think you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>you know, in all likelihood, one or two justices, whether they will be affected by this. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so hard to know. And so much depends on what the leaker was trying to accomplish,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Institutionally, they&rsquo;re in a hell of a bind. You know, right now,</p>
<p>we know that there was this initial vote. Now let&rsquo;s say that the ultimate opinion doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overrule Roe and Justice Kavanaugh joins the Chief Justice to do something</p>
<p>less aggressive. Institutionally, that sets an unbelievably bad precedent if it creates the</p>
<p>impression that leaking documents to the public leading to protests causes the Supreme Court to</p>
<p>change its mind. So that&rsquo;s a horrible place for the justices to be in, to be perceived as reacting</p>
<p>to the leak in a way that the leaker intended. What that invites later generations of court staff</p>
<p>to do is, is no bueno.</p>
<p>It seemed like Alito almost thought it was going to happen because there&rsquo;s a section in his thing</p>
<p>that actually speaks, Amy, you mentioned it, about being almost oblivious, maybe is the right word,</p>
<p>to what happens on the outside, that they needed to do what&rsquo;s right, almost, in a way,</p>
<p>almost forecasting this. I have a question for both of you, which is more general in nature,</p>
<p>which is, should we have age limits for Supreme Court justices? So one of the things,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean to, you know, I don&rsquo;t mean to sound morbid when I say this, but,</p>
<p>you know, these folks literally are in the chair until they die, and this is what I think creates</p>
<p>some of this, some of these issues, right? So RBG, you know, there could be a claim now that if</p>
<p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg had actually stepped down, or tried to hold on, you know, it would, could</p>
<p>have been a different outcome, there could have been a different person. What do you guys think</p>
<p>about this age limit concept for Supreme Court justices and dealing with that in that way versus</p>
<p>making these lifetime appointments? I&rsquo;m personally strongly in favor of this, but you have to</p>
<p>recognize that it would require changing the Constitution. There are all kinds of attempted</p>
<p>workarounds, but I&rsquo;m telling you that the people who would decide the constitutionality of the</p>
<p>workarounds are the justices themselves, and they would have no interest in accepting any</p>
<p>limitation on their life tenure. So, you have to expect that we&rsquo;re talking about something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of pie in the sky, because we&rsquo;re not going to amend the Constitution to do this until we end up</p>
<p>with a justice who&rsquo;s senile, and who can&rsquo;t do the job, and the Supreme Court turns into a laughing</p>
<p>stock. And at that point, the country will react, but we&rsquo;re just not good as a country at seeing</p>
<p>this problem coming. I mean, fundamentally, what happens is we&rsquo;re now incentivized to put people</p>
<p>on the Supreme Court when they&rsquo;re in their late teens, and just get them on there as soon as you</p>
<p>can, and keep them there for 70 years. And it&rsquo;s not gotten terrible, and Justice Thomas was</p>
<p>extremely young, but we seem to have settled around 50 years old. And there&rsquo;s nothing intrinsically</p>
<p>wrong with having somebody on the court for 30 years or 40 years at age 50. We&rsquo;ve been super</p>
<p>lucky when it&rsquo;s come to the fact that everybody&rsquo;s been pretty copus mentis. We&rsquo;ve run good,</p>
<p>and we could run much worse than we have. We see this in the Senate right now,</p>
<p>that we have some problems, and it could happen with a Supreme Court justice. But the difficulty</p>
<p>is even ‚Äì Are you referring to maybe they become senile, they&rsquo;re not all there,</p>
<p>they could have Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s, whatever?</p>
<p>Yeah, and then what do you do? Because you can&rsquo;t, you know, you&rsquo;re going to impeach them.</p>
<p>People who like the outcomes are going to ‚Äì but only the justices themselves can decide whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to leave. But the problem is this, we&rsquo;re getting ‚Äì we have a huge incentive now to</p>
<p>put on somebody who&rsquo;s very young, and the lead time effect of one presidency, of the Trump</p>
<p>presidency, for example, now will span four decades. And that I don&rsquo;t think the framers</p>
<p>intended. Remember, the average life expectancy at the time of the Constitution&rsquo;s framing,</p>
<p>when we said life tenure, was decades shorter, even for people who like Supreme Court justices</p>
<p>back then who had very good healthcare. And so, nobody contemplated this when we</p>
<p>originally said life tenure.</p>
<p>There is a proposal on this, that there were a few members of the House, I think,</p>
<p>including Ro Khanna and Rashid Tlaib and some other folks, but also some conservatives supported</p>
<p>too, for an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices. And I think the way it would work is,</p>
<p>basically, each president would get to name two justices. So, basically, every two years,</p>
<p>someone rolls off, and then the new president gets to choose a pick, and so every president gets two.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, basically, if you think there&rsquo;s nine justices on the court, so it takes 18 years</p>
<p>for a full cycle for it to roll over. I think it&rsquo;s pretty interesting because it would take</p>
<p>a lot of the heat out of these sort of Supreme Court nomination battles where somebody dies,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s a nomination fight, and both sides are playing for all the marbles.</p>
<p>If you knew that every presidential election, every president met two votes on the Supreme</p>
<p>Court, it would sort of normalize things. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s actually&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not what the Constitution says.</p>
<p>I know we need a constitutional amendment, but I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, there would still occasionally be openings that would be</p>
<p>created if someone had to step down or would have passed away, but you&rsquo;re right that it would,</p>
<p>people would be able to plan. We would know when people were going to be rolling on and</p>
<p>rolling off. I do think it is, you know, it&rsquo;s always struck me, it&rsquo;s kind of ironic</p>
<p>that it is, at least from a constitutional perspective, easier to add justices to the</p>
<p>court than to impose term limits for which there seems to be a fair amount of support.</p>
<p>Tom and Amy, you have been unbelievably generous with your time and your knowledge.</p>
<p>We truly appreciate you coming here and explaining it to the all-in</p>
<p>audience. We&rsquo;re all better for the work that you do and for you sharing them.</p>
<p>The podcast is amazing. It&rsquo;s so generous of you to have us.</p>
<p>Thanks for having us. Great to talk to you guys.</p>
<p>All right, Chamath, first off, thanks for getting those amazing guests. It was quite</p>
<p>an education. I think first, you know, we&rsquo;ll recognize it&rsquo;s four guys talking about abortion,</p>
<p>and, you know, we understand this is not exactly our issue to discuss and opine on.</p>
<p>No, but Jason, the takeaway for me was that this is not just an abortion issue.</p>
<p>Oh, of course. The downstream ones are severe, yeah.</p>
<p>This is gay marriage. This is interracial marriage.</p>
<p>So, on the gay marriage point, let&rsquo;s just go back to that for a second. So, look, I think Tom did a</p>
<p>nice job laying out, you know, in pretty neutral terms what&rsquo;s going on here and where he had a</p>
<p>point of view. He, you know, expressed it. I think the idea that this leads to gay marriage being</p>
<p>overturned, I don&rsquo;t see it. It&rsquo;s just, you know, maybe it&rsquo;s not impossible, but I just don&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>it. There&rsquo;s two reasons. So, first of all, the Bostick case I mentioned, this was a case just</p>
<p>two years ago, written by Gorsuch, joined by Roberts, and the other, so it was a 6-3 decision</p>
<p>in which Gorsuch held that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender employees</p>
<p>against discrimination. Now, Tom is right that that&rsquo;s statutory, not constitutional,</p>
<p>but Gorsuch didn&rsquo;t have to find in that statute that sex applied to gay people and transgender</p>
<p>people. The court decided on its own to do that, to interpret the statute that way. So,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling me that a court that just two years ago decided that you cannot discriminate</p>
<p>against gay employees is now going to allow discrimination against gay marriage? I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t buy it. And the second issue, the second reason is that marriage equality is broadly</p>
<p>popular now in the United States. People&rsquo;s minds have really changed on that issue.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think the court would want to go back on an issue where, again, they just ruled on this</p>
<p>in 2015, where basically the issue is now settled in the country. One of the differences, I think,</p>
<p>with abortion is it&rsquo;s still a very hot issue, and it&rsquo;s not settled in the way that marriage</p>
<p>equality or gay marriage is settled. So, I just don&rsquo;t buy this idea that now we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>overturning gay marriage, that we&rsquo;re going to be overturning, like, for example, contraception.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t buy it. Why? Because nobody in the country is arguing for outlawing contraception.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the counterargument to that, David, that people would have is,</p>
<p>well, we didn&rsquo;t think they were going to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they have. And so,</p>
<p>we feel we got rug pulled, Kavanaugh, et cetera. People, when they were being interrogated about</p>
<p>their views on these things, they felt like they lied. So, I guess, what would the response be</p>
<p>there? Because there seems to be a trust issue here that people are not trusting</p>
<p>the Supreme Court right now. And again, of course, depending on which side you are,</p>
<p>you might be thrilled or not thrilled with the outcomes. I think that was a very good point in</p>
<p>our discussion. But people didn&rsquo;t think this outcome would happen with Roe v. Wade. So,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to believe anything the court says.</p>
<p>We did talk about this earlier. I think we mentioned this when we talked about</p>
<p>abortion some episodes ago, that this case was going to go. And we mentioned, I think,</p>
<p>this in the context of this and affirmative action as two things that were going to get</p>
<p>challenged and would probably lose. And unfortunately, it turns out we&rsquo;re right on</p>
<p>one. And it looks like we may be right on the other as well, because I think the affirmative</p>
<p>action case will get ‚Äì</p>
<p>Did we think that Roe was going to get overturned? Did you think that, David?</p>
<p>I admit I thought Roberts was going to get his way on this. So, I am a little bit surprised.</p>
<p>I still think that, in terms of the testimony of these nominees, I mean, look, Tom,</p>
<p>I think, nailed the answer to that question. Saying that these decisions are settled law</p>
<p>is just a platitude. I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s settled law. It doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be overturned.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, we all know that in these nomination hearings, the job of every nominee</p>
<p>from either party is to basically say as little as possible. And describing Roe as settled law</p>
<p>is doing that. I mean, it&rsquo;s not ‚Äì you could still go back and overturn it. So, this idea that</p>
<p>they lied or whatever, I mean, look, people hear what they want to hear in these ‚Äì</p>
<p>The Republicans and the Democrats have a perfectly rehearsed answer</p>
<p>when somebody in the Senate confirmation hearing says, will you overturn it? And they say,</p>
<p>I could never adjudicate a case without knowing the facts, and I have to look at every case as</p>
<p>a clean slate. It&rsquo;s like a very well-practiced answer to every question. To your point, David,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very rehearsed confirmation process.</p>
<p>Right, exactly. So, this idea that they lied or whatever, look, the only way you think they</p>
<p>lied is if you read something into an answer that was a platitude that you wanted to hear.</p>
<p>My issue with this is the following, which is that I do think that there is a role for</p>
<p>compassion in how we&rsquo;re governed, okay? And what I have an issue with is that</p>
<p>at the sake of this originalism, to go and just be so textual about the constitution,</p>
<p>are you willing to abandon all compassion and an understanding? And that&rsquo;s where I just struggle,</p>
<p>and Jason, I think you asked it, where is the role of humanity in doing one&rsquo;s job, right?</p>
<p>And why is it that there&rsquo;s a belief that one must so fervently interpret in a very black and</p>
<p>white binary way a document that is, for all intents and purposes, still quite old, right?</p>
<p>And everything has the potential for improvement. And so, this belief that we got it right the first</p>
<p>time, and that there isn&rsquo;t any room for any dynamic improvement, to me, I really struggle with.</p>
<p>Let me just play devil&rsquo;s advocate. Your point of view is that the humanity in making these</p>
<p>decisions is driven by what you consider to be your moral standing here, which is</p>
<p>one of pro-choice. And there are other folks in the United States who have the moral standing</p>
<p>of pro-life, which is to say, I don&rsquo;t believe that that choice should sit with an individual,</p>
<p>given that it infringes on the life of another. And I think that&rsquo;s really what this is all about,</p>
<p>which is in these circumstances where there are different points of view on what morality is,</p>
<p>what ethics should be in this case, that&rsquo;s where the law and the courts have to play an</p>
<p>adjudicating role. And that&rsquo;s what makes it so tough, right? I hear you, but look, my perspective</p>
<p>on this is that, yeah, I am fundamentally pro-choice. I don&rsquo;t think I have the right to say</p>
<p>what a woman can do with her body. That&rsquo;s just absolutely not my role or a right that I should</p>
<p>have. I understand, however, and this may sound that I&rsquo;m talking on both sides, I understand</p>
<p>when people say this should be a past law. Okay? I think that that&rsquo;s a very reasonable thing to say.</p>
<p>You know, people should be able to vote that law and people should be able to enact that law.</p>
<p>I just think that when you have 50 years of a precedent, you know, where there is, as Tom said,</p>
<p>so much water under so many bridges, this is why I think, well, why couldn&rsquo;t you overturn</p>
<p>loving Virginia, right? Why couldn&rsquo;t you overturn Griswold? Why couldn&rsquo;t you overturn Obergefell?</p>
<p>And this is where I just think like, are we not just taking a big step back in society and saying,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to throw out compassion in favor of original textualism, and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>not sure that that&rsquo;s a good trade off in 2022 America. It&rsquo;s very interesting. This is such a</p>
<p>polarizing issue for us. And it seems like other societies have found a resolution in a way to move</p>
<p>forward. I also think sorry, just to finish, Jason, I also think like, this is where okay,</p>
<p>honesty, politicians step up and do your job one way or the other. You have a responsibility to</p>
<p>reflect the will of the people and you have a responsibility to collect that nuanced perspective</p>
<p>and implement a framework that represents that. And instead, what I think I see politicians on</p>
<p>both sides is just, you know, screaming like crazy people at each other. And it just doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything. So what are we going to do? And we&rsquo;re going to have the same conversation, guys about</p>
<p>affirmative action, right? We&rsquo;re going to have that conversation. And we&rsquo;re going to wonder,</p>
<p>okay, well, is affirmative action, was it reasonable? Was it good? Was it bad? Well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a right that&rsquo;s affirmed in the Constitution. And so you know, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>go away. I think thinking about intellectually, the, the way to resolve the issue for the country,</p>
<p>or path forward, might be interesting to delve into here. Is there a path forward, you see, David?</p>
<p>Because listen, we, it is one brush we paint with your either and the language is framed as such</p>
<p>pro choice, or anti choice, pro life or anti life. Obviously, these are loaded framings to begin with.</p>
<p>And people could be not want to see abortions occurring in the world. And they could also still</p>
<p>be pro choice, right? This is a very nuanced issue. And then people might have different</p>
<p>feelings that I know this is graphic and hard to talk about. But people might have different</p>
<p>feelings about the second trimester, the third trimester and very different feelings about the</p>
<p>first trimester and when an abortion occurs. And people who are pro choice might not be for third</p>
<p>trimester abortions, they may want to have some basic rules around abortion. So I&rsquo;m not putting</p>
<p>my own personal beliefs out there. And I&rsquo;m just framing a question. But what are your thoughts in</p>
<p>terms of moving forward? Because this is a could possibly be a state issue in July.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so let&rsquo;s assume that this is the decision. And it&rsquo;s I guess it&rsquo;ll officially</p>
<p>come down in June or end of June. So let&rsquo;s assume that this is the decision, by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still possible that Roberts could peel off a vote, and then we would get a scenario in which</p>
<p>Roe is upheld while modifying it to allow, you know, laws like the Mississippi law. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>assume that this decision that appears to be written by Alito ends up being the law.</p>
<p>What that will mean is that like Tom said, we&rsquo;ll have a vote in Congress, the Democrats will see</p>
<p>if they can basically uphold Roe by through a law, which Biden would then sign. I think the issue</p>
<p>there is they have to get enough votes to break the filibuster. And I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to do that. So let&rsquo;s assume that fails, then it goes to the states. So in states like</p>
<p>California, where we are, there&rsquo;s going to be no change whatsoever. In fact, you know,</p>
<p>Newsom Democrats are saying they&rsquo;re going to enshrine the current law in the Constitution</p>
<p>of the state. That&rsquo;s really that doesn&rsquo;t do anything. Abortion will remain broadly legal</p>
<p>in California, and in blue states, places like New York, coastal states. So right off the bat,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in about half the states, 25 of them or so, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s gonna be a change.</p>
<p>In about 12 states, these restrictions that are already on the books are going to go into effect.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to have about, you know, 12 or 13 states that become battlegrounds,</p>
<p>purple states, basically. And we will have those states through their legislatures and</p>
<p>through their elected representatives are going to have to figure out what their policy is going</p>
<p>to be. And that is going to be a huge issue in those states. And I think where this will go is,</p>
<p>I think politicians who figure out where the center is and figure out where most of the people</p>
<p>in their state are, are the ones who are going to benefit. And maybe the potentially hopeful</p>
<p>scenario here is that it will force people to compromise when they actually have to craft</p>
<p>legislation. They&rsquo;re gonna have to work through those compromises. Until now, the issue has been</p>
<p>so fully preempted by the Supreme Court that everybody basically was making these absolutist</p>
<p>rights argument, right? Like one side is saying there&rsquo;s a right to choice, one side saying there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a right to life. These are rights that are being framed in absolutes that Brooke no compromise.</p>
<p>There was no reason to compromise because there was nothing legislatively to work through or</p>
<p>compromise, right? These were arguments being made to the Supreme Court. So no one&rsquo;s had to</p>
<p>compromise. And I think when they actually start working on legislation, they start working through</p>
<p>these questions, Jason, of what you&rsquo;re saying, which is, should abortion be allowed in the third</p>
<p>trimester? Okay. No, most people would say no. Should it be allowed in the second trimester</p>
<p>and so forth? So you have to work through those questions. By the same token, if the pro-life side</p>
<p>refuses to make compromises for, say, rape and incest, they&rsquo;re gonna be punished by voters in</p>
<p>those states. I mean, that is very unpopular. So both sides here, I think, are gonna have to learn</p>
<p>to compromise. And it&rsquo;s gonna be a messy process. But the hope would be that at the end of this,</p>
<p>we do eventually arrive at some sort of resolution to the issue like we have in every other Western</p>
<p>country. In every other Western country, even ones that are quite religious, this is not a</p>
<p>culture war issue. And I think you could argue that one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s become a culture</p>
<p>war issue is because the Supreme Court preempted it and stopped the democratic process from working</p>
<p>50 years ago. And so the only way for people to express themselves is to make these, again,</p>
<p>absolutist rights arguments in front of the Supreme Court. I think that when it comes to the messy</p>
<p>issue of democracy, when people actually have to work through these things through their elected</p>
<p>representatives, who will lose elections, they will lose elections if they take positions that</p>
<p>are too extreme, I think maybe we will get to a compromise. I think you&rsquo;re saying something</p>
<p>really important. You&rsquo;re saying, had Blackmun not adjudicated Roe v. Wade in 73, it would have been</p>
<p>up to Congress at that time, they would have passed some set of laws and over successive</p>
<p>iterations of those laws, you&rsquo;re saying there would be a framework so that a moment like this</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t happen. Yeah, and you know what, that exactly what you just said was written by a</p>
<p>Supreme Court justice in a Law Review article in 1992. I&rsquo;m gonna let you guess who that justice</p>
<p>was in a second, but I kind of just read you a couple of statements from it. This justice said</p>
<p>that, no measured motion, the Roe decision left virtually no state with laws fully conforming to</p>
<p>the court&rsquo;s delineation of abortion regulation still permissible. Around that extraordinary</p>
<p>decision, a well-organized and vocal right-to-life movement rallied and succeeded for a considerable</p>
<p>time in turning the legislative tide in the opposite direction, meaning there was already</p>
<p>a trend before Roe towards liberalizing these abortion laws across various states. Even Ronald</p>
<p>Reagan, a governor, had signed a law liberalizing abortion in California. And that process was</p>
<p>halted and stopped by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision, which in one decision invalidated</p>
<p>every single abortion law in America. And then what this justice said is that Roe halted a</p>
<p>political process that was moving in a reformed direction and thereby, I believe, prolonged</p>
<p>divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue. Do you know who the justice was who</p>
<p>said that? Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So she obviously was for ultimately the holding in Roe, but what</p>
<p>she said she would have done was have a much more incrementalist, narrow decision that would have</p>
<p>maybe invalidated just that Texas law, but threw it back to the legislature so that they could then</p>
<p>work out the issue. And instead, she felt like the Supreme Court making such a sweeping decision,</p>
<p>it created a backlash. And I think for 50 years, we&rsquo;ve been living with that backlash, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a culture war in this country over it, while every other Western nation has gone through the</p>
<p>democratic process of working out the messy compromise. Now, I think what Roberts was trying</p>
<p>to do is create an incremental approach to putting it back in the hands of the legislature. And I</p>
<p>think you could argue for the same reason that Ruth Bader Ginsburg argues that the incrementalist</p>
<p>approach would have been better. I think it was certainly the politically shrewder move, right,</p>
<p>not just throw this grenade into 50 state legislatures, but to gradually move the issue</p>
<p>back to the states. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of wisdom in an incrementalist approach, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Roberts or Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they both are basically saying, or you call it the story</p>
<p>decisive approach, you give weight to precedent, you don&rsquo;t just overrule these 50-year precedents.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of wisdom in that approach as well. But I think the hope here would be</p>
<p>that by letting the legislative process work through this issue, we can hopefully eventually</p>
<p>get to a stable, sustainable consensus. And it will be chaotic, but other countries</p>
<p>have dealt with this. Australia has, basically by the states in Australia, they have different</p>
<p>weak requirements. And Europe has certain weak requirements. I read a New York Times article and</p>
<p>you pointed me to some of these resources. So, a possible outcome is states starting to build</p>
<p>their own framework in terms of rape, incest, on demand, on request versus a certain number of</p>
<p>weeks. And that is just going to be an absolute amount of chaos for some number of years.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, if the parties don&rsquo;t compromise on this, voters will eventually punish them. I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to see Glenn Young can like victories by the Republican Party if they</p>
<p>broke no compromise on, for example, the issue of rape and incest. By the same token, I think</p>
<p>Democrats will have to, in a lot in purple states, they will have to concede that there is a</p>
<p>competing rights interest at some point on the part of the unborn baby, right? I mean, are you</p>
<p>really going to allow abortion into the nine-month of pregnancy if the life of the mother is at stake?</p>
<p>So, both sides have never had to acknowledge that the other side had anything useful to say.</p>
<p>And I think now they will. And if the absolutists and both parties refuse to do that,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to lose elections.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so hard to get the proper statistics here, because I think</p>
<p>a lot of the, I&rsquo;ve been looking, trying to understand what the country actually thinks.</p>
<p>And people do not ask very nuanced questions. Do you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned?</p>
<p>People get asked that question. The majority believe it shouldn&rsquo;t be. Do you believe that,</p>
<p>you know, like, we don&rsquo;t have all of these nuanced issues by state, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe people haven&rsquo;t even thought it through, right? Like, do most people who are pro-choice</p>
<p>have an opinion on the third trimester, on the second trimester? Do they actually</p>
<p>have an idea of when they feel and, you know, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I have not given this total</p>
<p>thought myself as to how I feel about it. I learned a lot by reading this. Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that was in the opinion that I didn&rsquo;t know. But it says, at the time of enactment of</p>
<p>this Mississippi law, only six countries beside the United States permitted non therapeutic or</p>
<p>elective abortions on demand. After the 20th week of gestation, those other six countries were</p>
<p>Canada, China, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. That&rsquo;s it in the whole</p>
<p>world. And so, you know, to your point, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s all these granular details. And I think,</p>
<p>as David said, a group of politicians need to sit in a room and really think through these things</p>
<p>and kind of try to try to get to some kind of basis that doesn&rsquo;t take back something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been in the books for 50 years. That&rsquo;s something so fun. That&rsquo;s the really tragic part about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s such an unequal thing to do.</p>
<p>Unfair. It feels profoundly unfair to take a right away after 50 years. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the Republican Party is going to just pay such a massive price for this.</p>
<p>Broadly, I mean, is this a case where like, the dog catches the car bites defender,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now like, Oh, my God, because</p>
<p>Well, this is why I&rsquo;m asking what is the what is the true prioritization of things as we know</p>
<p>how the world works today, meaning, I understand what it means to be an originalist,</p>
<p>or a textualist, I understand that, right. And I respect people&rsquo;s perspectives that the</p>
<p>Constitution should be interpreted verbatim. I understand that. And I and I respect people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to think that the thing though, Jason, to your point of like the dog catching the car</p>
<p>in the fender or whatever, is okay. Do you do that at the sake of a lack of compassion or lack</p>
<p>of empathy for how the world works today? And should we not have a point of view that says,</p>
<p>irrespective of how we decide, we should factor in what the moral temperature of the country is</p>
<p>in that moment in which something is decided? And I</p>
<p>have some context, like, there&rsquo;s a context here of it being law for 50 years that you cannot</p>
<p>disregard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Obergefell took until 2015 to really happen, right? Because by that point, it was a it</p>
<p>was there was this beginning of a sea change, where, you know, I think it&rsquo;s like 70%, I think</p>
<p>in a Gallup poll that I saw, support, same sex marriage, and I think it was about 80%. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>100, by the way, 80% support interracial marriage, and 92%. This is all in the same Gallup poll 92%</p>
<p>support, they don&rsquo;t think that using contraceptives, contraceptives is immoral.</p>
<p>Okay, but that still leaves 30%, 20%, and 8% that still think something that&rsquo;s very different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such a clear majority of America. So my, my hope is that, you know, as tragic as this</p>
<p>ruling is, if this is what comes to pass, that it&rsquo;s narrowly defined, so that to your point,</p>
<p>David, we don&rsquo;t open the Pandora&rsquo;s box on all of these other things that we have decided as a</p>
<p>nation are very reasonable things. You know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think over Obergefell is going to get overturned. I just don&rsquo;t see it. And the reason</p>
<p>is because of the way the Supreme Court handled that issue. So, you know, again, go back to the</p>
<p>early 1990s, the way that that this issue first came up is that a Hawaii court found that there</p>
<p>was a right to gay marriage, and there was a huge uproar. Supreme Court did not take up the case,</p>
<p>they did not take the bait. So what happened then is Congress passed DOMA, the Defense of Marriage</p>
<p>Act, which was huge majorities in both parties, and Bill Clinton signed it, remember this,</p>
<p>stating that marriage was, you know, one man and one woman. And so if the Supreme Court had</p>
<p>basically taken up the issue then and found a right to gay marriage, we might have had a</p>
<p>constitutional amendment banning gay marriage by now. And we&rsquo;d be trying to work our way out from</p>
<p>under that and figuring out how to get rid of that. But instead, the court did not take the</p>
<p>bait, they stayed out of it until 2013, when attitudes had changed substantially. And then</p>
<p>they invalidated DOMA in 2013, and then Obergefell came along in 2015. So I think the pattern here</p>
<p>is that the court has learned to stay out of these hot button issues until they become a little bit</p>
<p>more settled. And then what they do is once the public&rsquo;s opinion has sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Is clear.</p>
<p>Is clear, then they enshrine it.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it clear that people want the right for women to choose?</p>
<p>Well, but it created this enormous backlash that the&hellip;</p>
<p>What enormous backlash? You mean amongst the minority?</p>
<p>Well, you say that, but it&rsquo;s a very large group of people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the minority. You just said yourself that the majority in the court</p>
<p>wants the majority of people to go for gay marriage. That&rsquo;s the disconnect I have.</p>
<p>Well, but here&rsquo;s another disconnect, right, Jake? If you believe your position on this</p>
<p>is so incredibly popular and has such a supermajority, why are you worried about</p>
<p>it being returned to the state legislatures? They will basically pass the laws that you want.</p>
<p>Well, no, I believe in some places, the minority might be the majority in a certain state,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll have women in those states who aren&rsquo;t able to get an abortion safely.</p>
<p>That would be my concern.</p>
<p>I think that the country is deeply divided on this issue. Look, it all depends on how</p>
<p>you define the labels. It is true that most people say they&rsquo;re pro-choice. However,</p>
<p>if you frame the question as, should there be no restrictions at all,</p>
<p>most people would say they&rsquo;re in favor of restrictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a totally different frame.</p>
<p>Exactly. So my point is, the country is still deeply divided over this.</p>
<p>And the issue got preempted by the Supreme Court 50 years ago, and we&rsquo;ve never made</p>
<p>progress since then. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be very messy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fair. If you frame the question as, do you believe women should have the right</p>
<p>to choose in the first trimester, we would probably have the overwhelming majority of</p>
<p>people say, sure, that&rsquo;s no problem. And then we would be arguing over second trimester and</p>
<p>third trimester.</p>
<p>I just posted the Gallup data. They&rsquo;ve longitudinally tracked attitudes and</p>
<p>opinions of abortion since 1975. As of today, in 2021, 2022, you know, the split between</p>
<p>pro-choice and pro-life is very even. It&rsquo;s, you know, 49% is pro-choice and 47% is pro-life. But</p>
<p>if you ask the more nuanced question that David said, 48% consider abortion to be legal</p>
<p>only under certain circumstances, 32% say it should be legal under any circumstance,</p>
<p>and 19% said it should be illegal in all circumstances. And so to your point,</p>
<p>the plurality of people, half of America, basically wants it as a supported right</p>
<p>with some boundary conditions, but then there&rsquo;s 32% of people that want it under all circumstances.</p>
<p>So I think the compromise is that there is a 70 plus percent majority of people</p>
<p>who can craft a law here, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And also the question of, do you consider yourself pro-choice or pro-life? That is the</p>
<p>personal question, not do you think it should be legal or illegal? That&rsquo;s what do you believe as a</p>
<p>human being on planet Earth? Are you pro-choice or you&rsquo;re pro-life? And I guess that would be assumed</p>
<p>if you had a baby. But then when you look at the illegal, the illegal is under 20% now. It&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>18, 19% now. So&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, since in 1975, that line hasn&rsquo;t moved.</p>
<p>Right. And that would be highly religious people, I would assume, make up the majority of that 19%</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s really moved is, you know, we&rsquo;ve doubled the number of people that say it should</p>
<p>be legal in all circumstances since Roe. And that&rsquo;s come from people who thought it should be</p>
<p>legal under some circumstances.</p>
<p>Yeah, 20 to 32. So 50% plus.</p>
<p>This is a fraught issue for the Republican Party, because if they only appeal to their base,</p>
<p>the 32% who should&hellip; Actually, no, sorry. It&rsquo;s 32% say it should always be legal. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Democratic base. But if they appeal to the 19% who say never, as opposed to the 48% who say</p>
<p>reasonable restrictions, they could lose some elections here. Look, I think until now, the issue</p>
<p>has been a little bit performative because both parties could just appeal to their base because</p>
<p>the issue had been preempted. There were no laws to vote on. Now there are going to be real laws</p>
<p>to vote on. There&rsquo;s going to be real votes. And people, if they don&rsquo;t move to where the majority</p>
<p>of the country are, they&rsquo;re going to pay a political price for that.</p>
<p>So basically, translated, Republicans are going to have to</p>
<p>fall into this bucket of legal under certain. And they&rsquo;re going to not listen to illegal in</p>
<p>all because that means they&rsquo;ll just be so disconnected from the reality of American</p>
<p>life in 2022. They will not get office.</p>
<p>As long as we can have some reasonable voter participation that isn&rsquo;t about</p>
<p>the extreme riches of both parties. Again, this is again, what we&rsquo;ve been saying, I think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the more centrists that show up and vote, the more compassionate and rational we can be.</p>
<p>And getting to Denmark is what they call it, right?</p>
<p>What is it called?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a term getting to Denmark, which is a term for where the politicians and the people</p>
<p>who represent you are in sync with the beliefs of the majority of the country. And if you get</p>
<p>to Denmark, you know, the distance between what politicians are doing and what the people want is</p>
<p>very short, you have this consensus or this alignment. And we don&rsquo;t have that alignment</p>
<p>right now. And this is probably the most pronounced issue and gun control, we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we can always hold out hope that, you know, there&rsquo;s a more temperate, moderate form of a</p>
<p>ruling. That&rsquo;s not what this is. But in the case that this is what it is, I hope David that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, and that it starts and ends with Roe and that it gets the states to be activated to do</p>
<p>something. And it doesn&rsquo;t spill over to other things like gay marriage, or even interracial</p>
<p>marriage, because I just think that I don&rsquo;t put it past one law clerk someplace who&rsquo;s hellbent on</p>
<p>proving a point to use an originalist framing of what they believe the Constitution says to run</p>
<p>these cases up the flagpole.</p>
<p>Right. But I don&rsquo;t think the Supreme Court is going to overturn those other cases. I&rsquo;d just</p>
<p>be shocked. I don&rsquo;t even think they will take those challenges.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just absolutely devastated by this. It&rsquo;s just, to take away women&rsquo;s right to choose is just</p>
<p>insane to me. But we&rsquo;ll see. We don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen here. So,</p>
<p>hopefully, we&rsquo;ll get some resolution.</p>
<p>I really love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you guys too.</p>
