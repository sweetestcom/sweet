    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to episode two of the All In podcast with Jason and Chamath,</p>
<p>some basic ground rules here. If you&rsquo;re not into speculation, you don&rsquo;t like to debate,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like to question authority, and you don&rsquo;t like to get a shit ton of inside</p>
<p>information, I&rsquo;m going to actually turn the podcast off right now and go download The</p>
<p>Daily from The New York Times or All Things Considered or some other bullshit, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here to do speculating and talking about inside information and the real deal. With me, as</p>
<p>always, my co host Chamath Palihapitiya, if you don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce it, Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>Chamath, how you doing? You holding up okay?</p>
<p>I am doing fabulously well. We are in week four of our lockdown sheltering in place here.</p>
<p>You losing your mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not because I&rsquo;m fortunate to be in the suburbs. I think if I was cooped up in an</p>
<p>apartment in the city, I would feel a lot worse than I do right now. But there&rsquo;s a lot of fresh</p>
<p>air, the weather&rsquo;s finally turned, it&rsquo;s not raining as much. So we get to see the sun a</p>
<p>little bit, makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, can you imagine 15, 20 years ago, hold up in an apartment with three kids</p>
<p>who are home from school, like these people who are in a city, they must be going insane.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much value to visiting New York. But if you&rsquo;re stuck there in a quarantine</p>
<p>lockdown, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do.</p>
<p>All right, well, we got a great guest today. Why don&rsquo;t you introduce our guest Chamath?</p>
<p>Well, we are really lucky here. This is a person who I&rsquo;ve known now for, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe</p>
<p>15, 20 years. What I would call him is one of my best show ponies. I have ridden this</p>
<p>motherfucker up and down in everything he&rsquo;s done. He has made me so much money. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>owning the publishing rights to the YouTube back catalog. This is how prolific this guy is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like owning the Beatles back catalog, right? You&rsquo;re like Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Backlog. So David Sachs, though, no, all kidding aside, David Sachs is one of the most incredible</p>
<p>people that we know. One of our closest friends. Big bit of a background on David. He</p>
<p>almost became a lawyer, but dropped out of law school after going to Stanford and worked</p>
<p>with Peter Thiel at PayPal and was a chief operating officer there. Left PayPal.</p>
<p>Moved to Los Angeles. Unsuccessfully kept his virginity. Found a way to not get laid as a movie</p>
<p>producer in Hollywood, which seems to be impossible, but David found a way of doing it.</p>
<p>Produced a movie, one of the best known movies of that generation called Thank You for Smoking.</p>
<p>Then moved back up here, started Genie, pivoted, started Yammer, sold that for more than a billion</p>
<p>dollars to Microsoft and became during that time, frankly, one of the most unsung heroes</p>
<p>of company founders and was a prolific investor in some of the most well-known iconic businesses</p>
<p>of this last generation. Airbnb, Uber, Slack, the list goes on and on. And now is the co-founder</p>
<p>of Kraft Ventures, which is essentially David&rsquo;s early stage venture business where he</p>
<p>helps a lot of really great companies get to the next level and frankly,</p>
<p>the level that he&rsquo;s been playing at for a while. Despite all of that, again, I just see him as</p>
<p>a show pony. Some money printing machine. If you can get in on that fund,</p>
<p>if you can get in on those companies, you&rsquo;re going to do well. Saks is an operating machine.</p>
<p>Welcome to the program. David Saks, welcome to the pod.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>How are you holding up, Saks, just personally, family, everything, companies, just generally,</p>
<p>psychologically? How is this impacting you?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all fortunate to be safe and we started paying attention to the virus, I guess,</p>
<p>in February because of Twitter tech. There are a bunch of people in the tech ecosystem who started</p>
<p>tweeting very alarming things in February or even going as far back as like January 30th.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know for sure if they were right, but some of them were friends of mine. And so</p>
<p>we were to get seriously and we started doing work from home, I think on March 1st. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all been kind of self-isolated since then. And fortunately, everyone has been safe.</p>
<p>Holding up pretty well.</p>
<p>Saksiput, tell everybody on the pod, our group chat and basically what it is,</p>
<p>what we do on that group chat and what you think about it.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I mean, basically our poker group and sort of extended poker group, which is about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s probably about 20 players who rotate in and out of our poker game.</p>
<p>We have a chat group and we used to just talk about cards and stuff like that. But very rapidly,</p>
<p>it became a place to share information about the virus and the response and what was going to</p>
<p>happen. And the remarkable thing is that whatever we talk about ends up becoming like, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everyone else figures it out about a week or two later. And I think it has helped us stay about a</p>
<p>week or two ahead of the curve on this thing. Has it generally been mentally reassuring or</p>
<p>has it amplified your anxiety talking about it all the time in that chat?</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing is that we have people in that chat who are very optimistic.</p>
<p>We have people who are very pessimistic. We have people in between. And then we have people who</p>
<p>swing around quite a bit. And so I think you get like all the perspectives. And I think, I guess</p>
<p>my view of the future is that very hard to try and figure out what&rsquo;s going to happen. You have</p>
<p>to think about it in terms of scenarios. And so the chat group helps understand what those</p>
<p>scenarios might look like. So where would you describe each of us then on the positive,</p>
<p>negative, and then swingy? You&rsquo;re in which cap? Are you swingy?</p>
<p>So I think the three basic scenarios are V, U, and L. And Jason, I would describe you as a V.</p>
<p>I think Chamath is closer to the U, which is the most pessimistic. Sorry, the L is the most</p>
<p>pessimistic. And then the U is sort of somewhere in between. And I sort of swing between the U</p>
<p>and the L. But I also understand the case for the V. And those initials really refer to the shape</p>
<p>of the recovery to come and how quickly we&rsquo;ll come out of this.</p>
<p>So David, before we drill down into your beliefs on the future, let&rsquo;s talk about the past.</p>
<p>What do you think this entire episode has shown us, whether it&rsquo;s from a public health perspective</p>
<p>or an economic perspective? But how would you summarize your view of the world as it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>revealed to you in the past two months? Yeah. I mean, I think that</p>
<p>we live most of our lives during these relatively calm periods, and then our lives get redefined by</p>
<p>these apocalypse events. And we&rsquo;re not really wired for this rate of change. I think it was</p>
<p>Lennon who said something like there&rsquo;s some decades when nothing happens, and there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>weeks where decades happen. And I think that&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s happening here. And it feels</p>
<p>like, I mean, a little bit, the last thing that was like this was 9-11, where, you know, you woke</p>
<p>up that morning, saw the Twin Towers coming down on TV, and you realize that we were now in a</p>
<p>different era. And something like that&rsquo;s happening here as well, just in slower motion.</p>
<p>What do you think the government did right? And what do you think that the government did wrong?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, limiting the flights in from Wuhan or China was a good initial step. But</p>
<p>after that, it seemed like the response was very slow and sort of disbelieving and kind of</p>
<p>incredulous. And we&rsquo;ve seen this basically everywhere. The initial response of just about</p>
<p>every country, with a few notable exceptions in Asia that had previous experience with SARS. But</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve seen in just about every country is that nobody believes it&rsquo;s going to happen to them</p>
<p>until it happens to them. And then even in the United States, you know, it&rsquo;s like no one believes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to happen in their city until someone on their social network gets the virus. And then</p>
<p>all of a sudden, they take it seriously. And so there&rsquo;s always been this like, it&rsquo;s like the slow</p>
<p>moving train wreck where you see it coming and people are just a little bit too slow to react.</p>
<p>And you know, the problem is, it&rsquo;s all about the doubling time. So if the virus doubles,</p>
<p>you know, every two or three days, in the absence of any action at all, maybe even doubles every</p>
<p>day in a very dense city like New York City, just waiting two or three weeks can make 1000x</p>
<p>difference in, you know, somewhere between, I guess, 10x to 1000x difference, depending on the</p>
<p>doubling time, whether if you wait two weeks or three weeks. I saw an article on, there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of articles now talking about why has New York been hit so hard and California has been relatively</p>
<p>mild. And, and the articles were saying, you know, California only declared shelter in place</p>
<p>one week ahead of New York, how can it be doing so much better, and they&rsquo;re looking for all these</p>
<p>different causes and explanations. And, you know, even one week makes a huge difference. If in New</p>
<p>York, New York&rsquo;s been hit about 12 times harder than California. But if the doubling time is just</p>
<p>two days, one week is a 12x difference. That&rsquo;s how the exponential exponential reality works. And</p>
<p>so, like being a week, you know, or two weeks or three weeks behind the curve is incredibly costly.</p>
<p>How do you break down local government versus federal government and the action there?</p>
<p>And is America&rsquo;s architecture, with states, rights and powers, a benefit in this case? Or</p>
<p>is it a negative? Because we did see the blue states take it very seriously, the red states</p>
<p>take it less seriously, the red states have a lot more distance between individuals, the blue states</p>
<p>tend to be coastal cities, they&rsquo;re more dense. Maybe you could handicap for us the the spread</p>
<p>of the virus with the layer on top of it of local governments and the political climate we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, you know, the decentralized nature of the American system is both a blessing and a</p>
<p>curse in this type of situation. The curse is that it&rsquo;s been very hard to create a unified</p>
<p>national strategy where we&rsquo;re doing lockdowns piecemeal. And so the lockdowns get thwarted as</p>
<p>people move around between areas that are not locked down and start new outbreaks. Very hard</p>
<p>to control a virus that way. You know, we&rsquo;re also not able to act in the authoritarian way that we</p>
<p>saw China act and move on to control the virus very early on. But the blessing of decentralization</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s allowed, you know, the governors of states to react, and it&rsquo;s allowed private</p>
<p>companies to react, and it&rsquo;s allowed entrepreneurs to react, and you see a lot of people helping in</p>
<p>different ways. And that can make up for having kind of a more ineffectual, centralized response,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t likely to work completely in a country the size anyway.</p>
<p>Do you think that the health apparatus of the United States</p>
<p>did its job? And where do you think the areas of opportunity are to improve?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re talking about the health system, it seems like the health system has done a great</p>
<p>job in reacting to the virus in terms of hospitalizations, you know, adding hospital</p>
<p>beds, adding ICU capacity. Even in New York, it looks like, I think Cuomo just said today that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got, you know, ICU capacity, they&rsquo;ve got hospital beds. I think the hospital system has</p>
<p>done a great job rapidly creating more capacity. We haven&rsquo;t seen a situation like in Italy or even</p>
<p>the UK, where they&rsquo;re literally rationing ventilators and making horrible triage decisions</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s going to get a ventilator and who&rsquo;s not, you know. We haven&rsquo;t seen those types of</p>
<p>horrors in the US. But if by health system, we mean the FDA, the CDC, the WHO, which is</p>
<p>part of the US system, but we do rely on them to some extent, you&rsquo;ve just seen, I think, you know,</p>
<p>amazing, really malpractice or negligence. If they&rsquo;re a pharma company, I think they&rsquo;d be sued.</p>
<p>You have that, you know, you have on the CDC website, things that I haven&rsquo;t checked it today,</p>
<p>but as of a few days ago, were just blatantly not true. I mean, saying that you only needed a mask,</p>
<p>if you were actually taking care of a person with COVID-19, that standing, say, a three-foot</p>
<p>distance was sufficient, that was sort of an acceptable amount of social distancing,</p>
<p>even if the other person is coughing or sneezing, and that&rsquo;s not true. They&rsquo;re just saying things</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t true. And then, you know, on the, you know, the CDC and the Surgeon General until</p>
<p>basically the last few days, were telling us that masks didn&rsquo;t work, weren&rsquo;t effective, didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and then now they&rsquo;ve flipped to recommending them, but they&rsquo;re still not required,</p>
<p>and I just wrote a blog today that I published about half an hour ago that&hellip;</p>
<p>I thought the best part of that blog post, by the way, it&rsquo;s up on Medium and Saks has tweeted,</p>
<p>and I retweeted it, David, is what you said at the end, which is, we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the most draconian measure, quarantining people, which we use this softer term, shelter in place,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a quarantine, call it what it is, you&rsquo;re not allowed to leave your house except under rare</p>
<p>circumstances. But we won&rsquo;t do the basic thing of wearing the mask, it makes no sense. And Chamath,</p>
<p>I think you had a really interesting question early on here, which I think we should all</p>
<p>circle back on one more time, which is, what is this reveal, right? Like, in this kind of a crisis,</p>
<p>and I love the statement of Saks where, you know, some decades nothing happens, and then a week,</p>
<p>you have a decade happen. The thing that I am, I think is the big takeaway for me is handicapping</p>
<p>who you can trust, and what people&rsquo;s agendas are, and how they behave in a crisis. Because</p>
<p>there are a group of people building models. And what is the motivation of somebody who builds a</p>
<p>model? We think about, we all get pitched as investors, or when we worked inside of companies,</p>
<p>we build models, and we know the models mean nothing, they&rsquo;re made by humans. And what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the motivation of somebody building a model in today&rsquo;s climate, that then people adopt that</p>
<p>model, and there&rsquo;s life or death? What would you handicap? Would you go conservative? Would you go</p>
<p>aggressive? Would you lean into people dying in the case of supporting the economy? And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the model makers, there&rsquo;s the government, local and federal, you have the media, who are trying</p>
<p>to get clicks in some cases, you have capitalists who are trying to, you know, protect their book</p>
<p>and their bets. How do we all look at and think about people&rsquo;s agendas and like the CDC having</p>
<p>an agenda, the local government and the model makers having agenda? Chamath, maybe you could</p>
<p>take that one. Yeah, I think that the masks issue is actually the most instructive thing</p>
<p>in this whole debacle. And the reason is that there was pretty obvious data very early on,</p>
<p>that it was something that had unknown, but pretty useful upside, and absolutely zero deleterious</p>
<p>downside, right? So if you were thinking about risk management, and I gave you some options,</p>
<p>option one is do nothing. Option two is here&rsquo;s some drugs that you can take prophylactically,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really know either the efficacy or the long-term damage to a broad-based population</p>
<p>of people taking them. And option three was a piece of cloth over your nose and mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, for 10 cents. And apparently, at a minimum, it prevents other people from smelling your bad</p>
<p>breath, but at a maximum, it prevents projectiles of disease-laden spit getting into your orifices.</p>
<p>Death vapor. Causing you to die. Yes. And we couldn&rsquo;t agree that that was a-</p>
<p>Why? Why? Why? Was the agenda here because they didn&rsquo;t want people buying up the masks</p>
<p>and not going to healthcare workers? No, because it was never about-</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t we agree on something this simple? Because it was never about the N95 masks. You</p>
<p>could have worn a cloth mask, a tea cloth could have covered it up and given you 70% efficacy.</p>
<p>This has everything to do with incentives and everything to do with your other question as well,</p>
<p>which is like, why do modelers behave the way that they do? All of this is about being taken</p>
<p>seriously. And so to be taken seriously, you have to understand the incentives in the game that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing. So for a modeler and a forecaster, the incentive is all around being conservative</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re taken seriously. There&rsquo;s nobody that has any upside in showing a</p>
<p>model that shows 10,000 people dying. All of the attention and the gravity with which you&rsquo;re taken</p>
<p>and the attention that you get is when you first put out a model that shows that 2 million people</p>
<p>could die, which is what Imperial College did. And that eventually you walk it back and you walk it</p>
<p>back. And after the actuals exceed the forecast, then the data converges on what actually happens</p>
<p>and you see that these models were woefully inaccurate. It&rsquo;s the same with why the CDC or</p>
<p>the WHO are just so completely incompetent. Because the incentives in those organizations</p>
<p>are essentially to play their game and that game is not one of public health, but it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>politics. And so you have these people fighting each other over political territory and the right</p>
<p>to basically make decisions versus the actual substance and the validity of the decision.</p>
<p>‚Äì David, does that correlate with your thinking and then superimpose the media on top of that?</p>
<p>‚Äì Yeah. I mean, so I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things going on. One is that there is a huge</p>
<p>culture clash going on between the people who need conclusive scientific proof before they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to recommend any course of action. And then between other people who are willing to</p>
<p>take a more experimental approach to try things to iterate the way that we do in startup land</p>
<p>when confronted with company existential issues. And the latter approach is smart when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of upside in trying something and not much downside. And the other approach of this</p>
<p>scientific, the pseudo-scientific sounding approach where you&rsquo;re constantly demanding</p>
<p>conclusive evidence, it&rsquo;s actually people pretending to be smart. It&rsquo;s people who want to</p>
<p>sound smart, but it&rsquo;s actually a pretty dumb approach. And so we&rsquo;ve seen this culture clash</p>
<p>playing out over and over again. ‚Äì So I should repeat it back to you, David. Experts are afraid</p>
<p>to do something experimental with low downside because they have reputations and they want to</p>
<p>sound smart, whereas entrepreneurs or maybe capitalists or other problem solvers or perhaps</p>
<p>even gamblers are going to say, there&rsquo;s no downside here. What&rsquo;s the downside to putting</p>
<p>a mask on? Nothing. Let&rsquo;s try it. The same thing with chloroquine and the Z-Pak. Very early on,</p>
<p>people were saying, like Elon and other folks in our circle, why not just do it? ‚Äì Well,</p>
<p>hold on a second. Hold on a second. Chloroquine, let&rsquo;s not put that in the same category.</p>
<p>‚Äì Okay, why? ‚Äì This is the point. Because it&rsquo;s a drug, Jason.</p>
<p>‚Äì Yes. ‚Äì It&rsquo;s a drug for malaria.</p>
<p>‚Äì Okay, but on the spectrum ‚Äì You have zero evidence. No, no, Jason, hold on a second.</p>
<p>‚Äì Of taking it if you&rsquo;re sick already. ‚Äì No. We still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>‚Äì Right. ‚Äì Let&rsquo;s be clear, okay?</p>
<p>So masks is a wholly different thing. This is why I said it that way.</p>
<p>‚Äì Yeah. ‚Äì The minute you start to add drugs,</p>
<p>you come off as an armchair epidemiologist and anybody reasonably smart can poke holes in your</p>
<p>theory and you sound like a fucking moron. You cannot sound like a moron by telling people to</p>
<p>wear a cloth over their nose and their mouth. ‚Äì Okay, but the next step, if you were in the</p>
<p>hospital and you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed and they said, hey, the doctor says, you might want to try this,</p>
<p>there were people who were saying, don&rsquo;t even try it. And there was a direct correlation when</p>
<p>Trump said he was behind it. It seemed like the media and everybody were like,</p>
<p>this is the worst idea ever. ‚Äì I know, but this is your point,</p>
<p>which is that the incentives of that game are to politicize things versus think about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the best interests and the public health interests of either the United States or the</p>
<p>world. ‚Äì But aren&rsquo;t we in agreement to try it if you were in the ICU and they said, hey,</p>
<p>you want to try this, you wouldn&rsquo;t try it? ‚Äì No, but this is the problem. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the posture of the American political infrastructure is broken. And moments like</p>
<p>this shine a light on how broken it is. Because as David said, all of the testing and iteration,</p>
<p>all of those things are must-haves in peacetime. They are nice-to-haves in wartime. You don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a time to walk around and test fire a gun and make sure this works and that works. The enemy</p>
<p>is in front of you, you shoot and you fire and you aim later. And in that posture, we have to</p>
<p>have a set of rules that contemplate giving people at the ground floor, on the border of where their</p>
<p>life is at risk, the right to make a decision as well-informed as it can be about what they can try</p>
<p>to do to save their life. And doctors need to be equally empowered. And we&rsquo;ve effectively done that,</p>
<p>but we just did it in fits and starts. And in that, there is all of this noise that delays</p>
<p>the right decision, which is not that hydrochloroquine is good or bad, but it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s all the published data into the hands of the doctor who can actually read and understand it</p>
<p>so that he or she and the patient can make a decision together.</p>
<p>‚Äì Yeah, agreed. Sax, what are your thoughts on chloroquine and the Z-Pak and that whole</p>
<p>sort of unraveling of this is the miracle, it&rsquo;s not the miracle, it&rsquo;s worth looking at?</p>
<p>And how that debate occurred, let&rsquo;s say, on the Twitter,</p>
<p>and then also in our stream when we were talking? ‚Äì Well, Trump was not the first to</p>
<p>embrace the potential of hydroxychloroquine. In fact, we were talking about it in our chat group</p>
<p>before it became national news. Of course, once he did embrace it, it became political football,</p>
<p>and a lot of people wanted to prove him wrong. And so now it&rsquo;s hard to have a conversation about</p>
<p>it without it becoming political. But the argument for hydroxychloroquine really started</p>
<p>with some research papers that showed that it worked in vitro, basically in test tubes,</p>
<p>against the virus. And it worked against SARS, which is a related sort of category of virus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert or anything. This is just sort of me telling you what I know as a consumer of</p>
<p>information. And so it was not crazy to think this is something that should be tried in the</p>
<p>context of COVID-19. Now, we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to work or not. I saw an interesting</p>
<p>presentation by UCSF, and their working theory on it is that hydroxychloroquine plus Z-Pak might</p>
<p>have some impact in the first week of the virus before peak viral replication takes place. And</p>
<p>this might help interfere with the virus replicating. Once you&rsquo;re in respiratory distress,</p>
<p>though, and it&rsquo;s in your lungs, you&rsquo;re into a different phase of this, and they don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that. They think you need to look at other things. So it sounded like this was potentially valid</p>
<p>treatment in week one, less effect in week two. And by week three, when you&rsquo;re in severe ARDS,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you got to find other things. So in terms of what the right policy is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be in favor of the right to try. I mean, ultimately, we should let patients and doctors</p>
<p>make this decision together. And so I think the FDA did the right thing giving emergency</p>
<p>trial authorization to doctors to be able to try this with their patients. And what I think is</p>
<p>happening is, is that there&rsquo;s your sort of rapid decentralized information sharing happening</p>
<p>among doctors and hospitals. And, you know, I think they&rsquo;re getting to the right answer here.</p>
<p>Okay, do we do we feel comfortable moving on to financial implications of this? Or</p>
<p>are there things about the modeling?</p>
<p>On upside downside, I agree with Jamal that hydroxychloroquine is a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>mass or sort of the really unambiguous one. Because it&rsquo;s just so easy. There&rsquo;s so little</p>
<p>down just cloth. It&rsquo;s cotton, right? You literally could put a bandana on your underwear. Yeah,</p>
<p>you could use your own underwear and just put it across your face. I mean, this is what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>insane. That David&rsquo;s right. I remember having this argument with someone because on the CDC website,</p>
<p>as David said, he would only recommend it not as a preventative measure for you. But if you were</p>
<p>old, you should use a mask only if you were treating somebody with COVID-19.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an element of these authorities trying to manage us, you know, I can you know,</p>
<p>I really hate that, that. I mean, I do think that they thought about, will we create a run</p>
<p>on mass? Well, you know, that that that they don&rsquo;t want to tell us the truth, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>afraid of some of the consequences of telling us the truth. And, you know, I hate that feeling of</p>
<p>being lied to by public officials, because they&rsquo;re trying to manage. I&rsquo;m willing to be infantiled</p>
<p>by people that are smarter than me. Yeah. So can you give us a list of the four people you think</p>
<p>are smarter than you? Go ahead. I am. I am not who are those four people infantile by nameless</p>
<p>bureaucracies. And I think that Americans deserve to not be infantile. I mean, for the amount of</p>
<p>money that we pay and the amount in taxes, and the amount of power that we give folks.</p>
<p>The one thing that I&rsquo;m realizing through this whole thing is like, you know, the it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>true in some respect that the countries that had some level of authoritarian management did well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that the countries that had robust civil services, filled with people who</p>
<p>are at the top of their class also did well. Singapore, South Korea, where it is a stature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a point of pride to work for the government, where it&rsquo;s some of the best paying jobs,</p>
<p>Japan. And so, you know, one of the things that I realized is like, career bureaucrats</p>
<p>really do infantile Americans in a way that&rsquo;s really unproductive and unhealthy. I mean,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it surprise you and kind of like perturb you that the ex head of the FDA is way more</p>
<p>prominent and out front with his point of view than the current head of the FDA? I mean, what</p>
<p>the hell is going on? I think what we know is going on is I mean, Trump was elected, and he</p>
<p>dismantled some of this and the system was broken. I think now I think that that&rsquo;s unfair. And,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not a big Trump supporter, but I think it&rsquo;s unfair to pin it on him. The</p>
<p>reality is maybe he defunded or underfunded a bunch of things. But the hollowing out of our</p>
<p>institutions have been happening for 40 years. And it started with Reagan, to be clear, because we</p>
<p>tilted the scales towards free market trickle down economics, where government was viewed</p>
<p>as a stop for really smart people to inject themselves into industry at higher levels.</p>
<p>Or it was a place that&rsquo;s, you know, capable people would never go. Because capitalism,</p>
<p>the way that it was structured, was set up in such an aggressive, tilted manner for those that</p>
<p>were capable. And unfortunately, it hollowed out the government from people that were really strong</p>
<p>of character in a broadly speaking kind of way. And so what happens is that then bureaucracies</p>
<p>form the incentives change. And you get what you&rsquo;ve gotten right now, which is again,</p>
<p>it is a it is a point of argument on something as simple, and frankly, idiotic as a mask.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s move on to talking about the economy. And, David, you&rsquo;ve been quite a heretic</p>
<p>on Twitter, because you decided to engage in the one conversation you&rsquo;re not allowed to have,</p>
<p>which is talking about people&rsquo;s livelihoods, as opposed to their lives. You can only keep</p>
<p>one thought in your mind, as far as the kind of woke far left is concerned. And the Twitter mobs,</p>
<p>you could only talk about people in life and death, you can&rsquo;t talk about their livelihoods.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve been talking and starting a dialogue on how you would structure teams in a startup for</p>
<p>how do we deal with the crisis versus how do we go back to work? So explain how you would do this,</p>
<p>if this was a startup company, if you were doing it on an entrepreneurial level,</p>
<p>and what you think the road looks like. Let&rsquo;s start with San Francisco Bay Area,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll extrapolate to the most acute area in America, New York.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the big question that everyone&rsquo;s going to be asking by the end of April is what now?</p>
<p>Because I do think you&rsquo;re already seeing this in the New York data, that quarantines work. But</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be a total surprise to us. Historically, quarantines have always worked. I</p>
<p>mean, quarantines were the way that people dealt with plagues when they didn&rsquo;t have any technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the problem is just they&rsquo;re incredibly costly. And if the quarantine goes on for months,</p>
<p>is our only way of dealing with the virus, then we could be looking at the depression.</p>
<p>So the question really is, once we&rsquo;ve arrested the exponentiality of the virus, and I think we</p>
<p>have to do that first. But once we&rsquo;ve arrested the exponentiality, the big question is going to be,</p>
<p>well, now how do we get out of this? And what I worry about is that the daily update mentality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that our leaders are giving us these daily updates showing that they&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>a bias for action, which I think is good. But I worry that we&rsquo;re not going to be ready, that this</p>
<p>precious time that we&rsquo;re buying with quarantine is not going to lead to a better plan in May,</p>
<p>because no one&rsquo;s really working on that plan. They&rsquo;re just working on the triage, the immediate</p>
<p>response, the making sure that hospitals around the country have the ventilators and beds they</p>
<p>need, and we put in the orders. Why is it, David, that people can&rsquo;t keep these two parallel</p>
<p>processes in their mind at once? You&rsquo;ve been attacked viciously on Twitter, the media attacks</p>
<p>anybody who brings this up as only caring about capitalism, when in fact, you need to do both</p>
<p>plans. You need to figure out how people get back to their livelihoods, and we avoid a depression,</p>
<p>which would kill more people, ultimately, right? I mean, I think there&rsquo;s consensus about that,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s depression or suicide, etc., or people not being able to feed themselves or</p>
<p>have nutritious food and healthcare. So why can&rsquo;t people put these two things in their mind at once?</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s talk about the actual plan. If you were planning, and you were the mayor of</p>
<p>San Francisco, or you were in Trump&rsquo;s cabinet, and they said, okay, David, you make the plan</p>
<p>for the Bay Area to go back to work, take us through your 123, and then we&rsquo;ll throw it to</p>
<p>Jamal. What I would do is, I would do what I would do in a company for a product release,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;d have, in a company, I&rsquo;d have a product manager for the 1.0 release, and I have a</p>
<p>different product manager for the 2.0 release, because it&rsquo;s very hard for somebody to be all</p>
<p>in on two different releases, which have two different schedules. So I think the team that</p>
<p>we have right now that&rsquo;s basically concerned with the immediate response, the triage, that you keep</p>
<p>doing what they&rsquo;re doing, make sure that the country&rsquo;s reacting the right way, that it has</p>
<p>all the supplies they need, that they&rsquo;re berating 3M into giving us more PPE or whatever it is.</p>
<p>But I think that there should be a separate team, a czar for the 2.0 response, which should be</p>
<p>focused on how do we create a new system that gets us out of lockdown, but doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>re-trigger the exponentiality of the virus. And I think that person, that team should be ready</p>
<p>to slide the new system into place in May. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s beginning of May, end of May,</p>
<p>whatever, but sometime in May, they should be ready to slide that new system into place</p>
<p>so that this precious time we&rsquo;re buying isn&rsquo;t wasted.</p>
<p>Give us your 123. One is masks, obviously, I would think.</p>
<p>Masks is a total no-brainer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number one. Give us your 234 if you want to riff here a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the other elements of the plan that people keep talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rapid, ubiquitous testing. I mean, you have to have same-day results. This business of it</p>
<p>taking two, three, four days in the lab, the problem is if someone is infected, they could</p>
<p>be passing it on during that time. You don&rsquo;t isolate them in time. So we have to have massive,</p>
<p>ubiquitous same-day testing, along with contact tracing so that when you do find out that</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s got it, you can not isolate not just them, but all their contacts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a system that seems to have worked in South Korea. And I mean, those seem to be the pillars.</p>
<p>And is quarantining the high risk during this first phase of the rollout with testing,</p>
<p>social distancing, and masks? That seems to be the no-brainer. I would add fourth bullet point,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re obese, diabetic, asthma, or some combination of those and over 60,</p>
<p>and or over 60, you got to stay home now. And you cannot be in touch with anybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s out and about and part of that first wave to go back to society.</p>
<p>Right. We know that certain segments of the population are at much higher risk than others.</p>
<p>And so part of having a more fine-tuned response to the virus, other than just shutting everything</p>
<p>down, would say, well, let the people who are at very, very low risk go back out still wearing</p>
<p>masks and having the right protocols and hygiene and all that stuff. But you keep the high risk</p>
<p>population isolated rather than shutting down the entire economy. All right, Chamath, if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the board of directors, and David was the SAR of the May plan to go back, what questions would you</p>
<p>have for him? And how critical can you be of his plan? Let&rsquo;s make this as if we were actually in</p>
<p>charge. Chamath, savage David&rsquo;s plan. Well, I probably would push David to consider</p>
<p>a more aggressive approach here. And this is something that I&rsquo;ve talked about before,</p>
<p>Jason, you and I have talked about this on the podcast before, but we need a biological patriot</p>
<p>act. I know that it&rsquo;s unpalatable for people on the left for certain reasons and people on the</p>
<p>right for other reasons, but it just doesn&rsquo;t matter what they think. It was reported today,</p>
<p>by the way, that the CDC and the task force at the White House is considering immunity cards,</p>
<p>but a much more beefed up version of them. These need to be cards that have</p>
<p>some kind of chip inside them that are non-hackable and issued by the government.</p>
<p>But what I would push David to think about if he was the SAR of getting back to work</p>
<p>is the following, which is, I agree with the broad-based testing. I think that you need to</p>
<p>have some kind of wristband that allows you to be inside of certain green zones in every single</p>
<p>city or town in the country that allow you to in some way be back to normal. But there also</p>
<p>needs to be red zones where you cannot. We need to have a very, very quick way of restarting a</p>
<p>quarantine if there are hot spots that develop. But all of it needs to be supported by broad-based</p>
<p>testing and a biological patriot act. We do need to have immunity cards. And the simple basic reason</p>
<p>is that it is the only way that one can prioritize the economic salvation of the US economy.</p>
<p>Because I think once we have paid the cost from the public health perspective, which we are doing</p>
<p>at the end of this quarantine in flattening the curve or crushing the curve, our immediate focus</p>
<p>has to be in resuscitating the GDP of this country. Because otherwise, the number of deaths</p>
<p>and the amount of pain that is caused by economic destruction will far outnumber the number of</p>
<p>people that die from this, which is tragic already. And the only way that I can see for</p>
<p>us to do that in a scalable way is with an immunity card, a biological patriot act. So,</p>
<p>I would be pushing David to think about that and rip the Band-Aid off and get that done.</p>
<p>And David, I would also push you on thinking about quarantining not just at home, but maybe</p>
<p>by region and hot zone. So, if we know the New York corridor or the Northeast corridor is severely</p>
<p>infected, nobody in or out of that corridor without a visa, without, and I know this is a</p>
<p>very touchy issue, well, in terms of civil liberties, but until we&rsquo;re through this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why people from New York need to go to Florida without maybe a rare exception or,</p>
<p>you know, something to that effect, right? So, if we know we got California out of it, or</p>
<p>if SoCal is still in the thick of it, but NorCal isn&rsquo;t, maybe we have some level of testing</p>
<p>required to get on a flight to come to San Francisco or to go to leave New York. So,</p>
<p>those are two punch-ups. How would you look at those, David, as the new czar of getting back to</p>
<p>work? I think it&rsquo;s all on the table. I mean, I like the green zone, red zone idea. I like</p>
<p>using immunity information. We&rsquo;ve been talking in our chat group for, I think, a month about</p>
<p>these blood serology tests. I tweeted, I took one of those tests weeks ago, I think like three</p>
<p>weeks ago before the FDA had even approved it, and I tweeted about it. So, yeah, I think all that,</p>
<p>I think the immunity cards, I think we should use all that information. I mean, it would all be on</p>
<p>the table for sure. But I think most of all, these ideas need to be tied together into a coherent</p>
<p>system. And I&rsquo;m worried that our approach to date has been so ad hoc that we&rsquo;re not going to have a</p>
<p>coherent system ready to go as a replacement to shutdowns in May when we need it. Is part of this,</p>
<p>you talked before about how you didn&rsquo;t like to be managed. I think we all agree we&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>managed and massaged because they really do not want to even talk to us about going back to work</p>
<p>in May or what happens, because they&rsquo;re afraid that we&rsquo;re going to jump the gun and we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>going to just go to Crissy Field or whatever park or Central Park and just throw a giant party.</p>
<p>But people are not stupid. There is a certain self-preservation here that should be inherent</p>
<p>in all these discussions, which is any reasonable person watching the death toll in New York does</p>
<p>not want to leave their house. And so why can&rsquo;t well, how much of the lack of discussion about</p>
<p>this issue? Do you think David is because people are afraid to treat people like adults because</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re going to just go out to Crissy Field or, you know, Dolores Park?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think you&rsquo;re right that there was a long period of time where the authorities were</p>
<p>just trying to get everyone to buy into the idea that the virus was dangerous, they needed to</p>
<p>shelter in place. And they didn&rsquo;t want to hear any views that appeared to be contradicting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they were contradicting it. You know, I remember when the Imperial College</p>
<p>study model came out, and they said that 2.2 million people would die in the U.S.</p>
<p>And I tweeted that. I thought that number was insane. It was fear mongering.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, that&rsquo;s turned out to be the case. But, you know, people responded, well,</p>
<p>good. I mean, even if it is fear mongering, we need to make people afraid, because otherwise,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t do the right things. I guess that&rsquo;s true in a situation in which we&rsquo;re relying on</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s voluntary compliance to engage in a quarantine or to wear a mask. And I guess part</p>
<p>of the response here is to figure out what what, what action items should not be voluntary that we</p>
<p>just need to do in order to get past this.</p>
<p>Chamath, your thoughts?</p>
<p>I think that getting back to work is going to be much, much more difficult than people think.</p>
<p>I think that in the absence of a vaccine, which looks like at best 18 to 24 months from now,</p>
<p>we will never get to 100% of where we were before, or at least the potential to be at 100%.</p>
<p>And so, I just think that over the next two years, we&rsquo;re in for a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>difficulty. And this is sort of where, you know, I&rsquo;d like to shift the conversation. I think that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve now poured between the United States government and the Fed,</p>
<p>almost $10 trillion. We smeared it into the economy. And only three cents of every dollar</p>
<p>has gone into people&rsquo;s pockets. And I think we&rsquo;re hoping that the other 97 cents somehow</p>
<p>trickles down into their pockets in some way, shape, or form. Now, when you look at that 97</p>
<p>cents, half of it was, you know, things like propping up the commercial paper market,</p>
<p>propping up the repo market. But it&rsquo;s also been things like propping up investment grade debt,</p>
<p>propping up high yield debt. And I have a real issue with this, because I think that</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to take two years to get back to normal, and I really do think it&rsquo;s two years,</p>
<p>because Jason, a lot of the fears that you expressed, people will have as lingering doubts</p>
<p>and will prevent them from being at 100%, which means businesses will not be at 100%</p>
<p>until you can get an injection and know that you&rsquo;re protected. We&rsquo;re doing an enormous amount</p>
<p>of damage, because we&rsquo;re taking trillions of dollars and flooding it into the economy</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s just not going to be effective. And I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re taking enough time</p>
<p>to really think through these things. So, you know, on the one hand, while I appreciate the</p>
<p>velocity, or not the velocity, the intention, you know, like, I think Jerome Powell&rsquo;s commentary,</p>
<p>I applaud, which is like, you know, he&rsquo;s saying all the right things, which is,</p>
<p>we will do everything possible. But the lending program to companies has been haphazard and</p>
<p>difficult. But it did get started in three weeks. And some people have gotten money in week four of</p>
<p>this. I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty incredible. No, you know, the numbers that I&rsquo;ve read is that, you</p>
<p>know, on average, the loans are turning out to be sort of like, you know, in the 10s of 1000s. And</p>
<p>on top of that, you know, David and I talked about this in the group chat, but the math makes it so</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re better off furloughing or letting people go than you are taking PPP, which means</p>
<p>that a lot of this money may never get taken. And so, you know, but again, all of that is still a</p>
<p>small rounding error, we&rsquo;re talking about less than 10 cents on the dollar, 90 cents of the</p>
<p>dollar have gone into areas that will not really touch an average American citizen. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just fundamentally wrong, because the trickle down theory of all of this, you know,</p>
<p>was started 40 years ago, and we can see now that it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>David, any thoughts on the stimulus?</p>
<p>Well, I think I think what&rsquo;s happened is that we have a 30% hole in our economy right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got, you know, like a 15% unemployment rate going to going to 25 or 30, maybe as high as that,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know yet. You&rsquo;ve got a, you know, we think that GDP is going to contract in the next</p>
<p>quarter by a quarter to a third. And so you&rsquo;ve got this giant hole in the economy. And what the</p>
<p>Fed and Treasury are trying to do is plug that hole for a period of time until they can get</p>
<p>through this, this health crisis. And if the crisis only lasts a few months, maybe they can</p>
<p>hold it all together. But I do worry that if it lasts longer, it&rsquo;s going to slip out of their</p>
<p>hands. And, and the result is going to be a cascade of defaults and bankruptcies and</p>
<p>effectively a great unraveling of our economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that I think that though, in fairness, like this is where I think bankruptcy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost viewed as a four letter word, but it&rsquo;s not. And in many ways, the bankruptcy process</p>
<p>could actually be the saving grace of American business in this moment. And the reason I say</p>
<p>that is that it allows in a bankruptcy, these companies to discharge a lot of the debt. And we</p>
<p>could set up a mechanism where these bankruptcies could be done in a way where, again, similar to</p>
<p>taking PPP, you don&rsquo;t let people go, you know, a percentage of the of the cap table must go to the</p>
<p>pensions if they have them, a certain percentage of the cap table must go to employees. And then</p>
<p>the remaining percentage goes to the secured bondholders. And so the existing equity holders,</p>
<p>and the unsecured bondholders would effectively, you know, not be made whole, but in that all the</p>
<p>employees would be. And if you combine that with a UBI program where you put, look, in the United</p>
<p>States economy, only $8 trillion is wages. So, you know, we could do so much. If we had given every</p>
<p>United States citizen their absolute salary of 2019, right now, we&rsquo;d still have 2 trillion left</p>
<p>to bail out companies. And everybody could take a year and get paid, like literally have a year</p>
<p>sabbatical and be paid. I think what it really does is it guarantees the chances or it maximizes,</p>
<p>sorry, the chances of a consumer led recovery, like, the United States has never been an economic</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s been vibrant because of government spending or other things. We&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>vibrant because we&rsquo;ve been consumer led. It&rsquo;s consumer consumption. And it&rsquo;s customers of</p>
<p>companies buying products that they need or want that drive the economy forward. And if you think</p>
<p>about our largest customer base, they are the US population. And by guaranteeing their revenue,</p>
<p>so to speak, you actually allow them to then spend once they get out of quarantine,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see them spend even in fits and starts. In this way, you know, you could spend $500</p>
<p>billion buying a bunch of junk debt. I really don&rsquo;t see as a reasonably, you know, savvy</p>
<p>participant in the markets how it actually helps anything. I think all it does is it saddles you</p>
<p>and me and all of our listeners with a bunch of toxic junk debt that eventually has to get sold</p>
<p>by the Fed, as David said, in the grand unraveling. And it would be more healthy market,</p>
<p>what wouldn&rsquo;t it be more healthy, David, to allow a certain percentage of these companies,</p>
<p>the weaker ones to fail, so that the stronger ones could then pick up those employees,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be some stability. And I&rsquo;m curious if you&rsquo;d think that we&rsquo;re going to be living in</p>
<p>a world where when people have speculated about this, maybe some the individual consumer changes</p>
<p>their perspective, and maybe people come out of this crisis with a different worldview. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily subscribe to this, but Chamath, you do, we&rsquo;ve had this conversation. And so I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>David, if you think the American consumer will forever change, and maybe they upgrade their phone</p>
<p>half as much, they, you know, spend less, and they basically live a more modest rural lifestyle,</p>
<p>and people maybe stay out in Tahoe, or Colorado, wherever they went during this crisis,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts? Well, you&rsquo;re really talking about depression era values. And</p>
<p>the problem is, if we acquire those values via depression, that that would be a pretty</p>
<p>bad outcome here. So, but yes, that could happen. You know, I think where I agree with Chamath is</p>
<p>that I think that even though the federal government, the Fed, the Treasury have a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of firepower, in a situation like this, it may not be an exhaustible and we</p>
<p>have to kind of pick and choose and prioritize who&rsquo;s going to get aid and who&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>bailouts. And right now, it feels a little bit willy nilly. You know, and it feels like it,</p>
<p>under those circumstances, the bailouts default to the people who are politically connected and</p>
<p>powerful, as opposed to the workers, the pension funds, you know, the main street small business</p>
<p>owner who&rsquo;s worked their whole life on a business now all of a sudden, is underwater. And I think,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s gonna be very hard to get the, the, the aid to the right people.</p>
<p>Look, in the last four weeks, in the last four weeks, oh, sorry, in the last week,</p>
<p>this is an incredible set, I apologize. In the last week, the amount of distress debt in the US</p>
<p>has quadrupled in one week to a trillion dollars. So, as an example, to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more visible to Jay Powell, or to Steve Mnuchin, in the Fed and at the Treasury,</p>
<p>then, then it is that, you know, thousands and thousands of nameless anonymous small businesses.</p>
<p>Who owns this? Can you give an example of what that debt would be for the listeners?</p>
<p>Sure, like, you know, I mean, I mean, so, you know, I mean, a fallen angel today is Ford. So</p>
<p>we were not to pick, we&rsquo;re not going to pick on Ford, but we&rsquo;re just going to point to it</p>
<p>as a well known company. So this is a car manufacturer. They employ hundreds and</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people in very important political states, you know,</p>
<p>to Michigan, Ohio, I think, Tennessee, probably. But Ohio and Michigan, obviously critical states.</p>
<p>And they, you know, issue debt into the market to fund, you know, building factories or buying</p>
<p>equipment, who buys that debt, pension funds by the debt, family offices by the debt,</p>
<p>hedge funds by the debt. Now, those guys were giving out a coupon, and they were paying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say, four or five or 6% a year on this interest. But now, because of all this economic</p>
<p>uncertainty, people think that their ability to pay that back has gone way down. And so now they</p>
<p>have to issue debt at much higher interest rates. And the existing debt has a much lower credit</p>
<p>quality. It&rsquo;s effectively like you having a credit card. And, you know, American Express</p>
<p>calling you and saying, Jason, I think the odds of you paying your credit card balance have gone</p>
<p>way down. So I&rsquo;m increasing your interest rate to 24% from 17%. Yeah, and then I get another credit</p>
<p>card to pay it off. And, and so essentially, what&rsquo;s happened is the Federal Reserve has decided</p>
<p>to become that next credit card issuer. What could go wrong? Instead of doing it for you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing it for companies, but not for you. And the question is, is that okay? Well,</p>
<p>at some level, companies like Ford should be saved, because I think these are iconic businesses</p>
<p>that employ hundreds of thousands of people. And they&rsquo;re critical linchpins in the economy,</p>
<p>right? Because they have a massive supply chain network. And, you know, they&rsquo;re really important</p>
<p>for many other things beyond just the economics that they themselves represent. But there are</p>
<p>better ways to help Ford. You could lend Ford as much money as they needed to meet their short-term</p>
<p>obligations, similarly to the way that the Federal Reserve would allow a bank to borrow from their</p>
<p>window. And I think that that&rsquo;s a very reasonable approach. The question is really when the Fed</p>
<p>then basically acts as a buyer of last resort and obfuscates the price of these bonds,</p>
<p>and essentially is saying, the American taxpayer will own these bonds for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>If you think that at some point, those bonds that you bought for, you know, $0.90 on the dollar</p>
<p>are worth $0.90 on the dollar, then everything is okay. But if there&rsquo;s a chance that $0.90 goes to</p>
<p>$0.70, the people that really eat that cost are us in the short term and our children in the</p>
<p>medium and long term. I have a silly question. It&rsquo;s obviously not my wheelhouse corporate debt</p>
<p>like this. Why wouldn&rsquo;t there be a clause that if they didn&rsquo;t pay back that $0.90 on the dollar</p>
<p>that the American government bought it for, it converts into equity in the company?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question. Because the Federal Reserve has chosen to go and essentially the equivalent</p>
<p>of open an E-Trade account and step into the markets by themselves and just buy.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re buying bonds, and they&rsquo;re buying individual bonds, and they&rsquo;re buying indices</p>
<p>that control or that have exposure to certain bonds. What they are not doing is going directly</p>
<p>to these companies and negotiating, essentially saying, I will give you $4 or $5 billion,</p>
<p>and what I want you to do is retire that old debt and replace it with this new instrument,</p>
<p>and here are the terms of this new instrument. The United States taxpayer gets, you know,</p>
<p>3% or 4% warrant coverage of the company. You know, you must make sure that the pension holders</p>
<p>are made whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a no-brainer. Why wouldn&rsquo;t we have those clauses? It&rsquo;s like basic blocking and tackling</p>
<p>that, you know, seed funds have. David Sachs, why is this not like a no-brainer?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think we&rsquo;ve got to get a good deal for taxpayers. I mean,</p>
<p>Jamath has said it, I&rsquo;ve heard Mark Cuban say it pretty eloquently. I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve even heard Trump say that we have to get a good deal for taxpayers. I just think that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in such an emergency, they&rsquo;re not really taking the time to do that. They&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re trying to do things they can do immediately.</p>
<p>Yeah, the forgivableness of this money, to me, is the thing I don&rsquo;t understand. Why is any of</p>
<p>it forgivable? Why isn&rsquo;t all of it just, you know, a 10-year long or 20-year long loan that converts</p>
<p>into equity over some tranches? But Jason, this is why if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>haphazardly fire trillions of dollars out of a bazooka, why not give more than three cents on</p>
<p>the dollar to average Americans? Why not put it into the pockets of every single bank account?</p>
<p>You know, who knows how much everybody made? The IRS does. And, you know, the IRS has a mailing</p>
<p>address for everybody. And the IRS either gets a check or mails a check to every single taxpayer</p>
<p>in the United States, which also‚Äî And they also have direct deposit for half of the people.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping us from saying, well, you know what, why don&rsquo;t we do</p>
<p>10%? 10 cents of every dollar. Why don&rsquo;t we do 15 cents of every dollar to Americans? I really</p>
<p>think this is the way that you limit the amount of waste that&rsquo;s going to happen. So, the intention</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t wrong. And we shouldn&rsquo;t castigate people for wanting to put money in the system, as David</p>
<p>said, to plug the hole. But we can&rsquo;t be so haphazard as to not think about the moral hazards</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creating and try to fix them in real time. And so, this 10 trillion has already gone out the</p>
<p>door. But if the next trillion or two don&rsquo;t touch Americans, I think it&rsquo;s going to create an</p>
<p>enormous amount of damage. We&rsquo;ve only given people a few weeks of a lifeline. And they need more.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t tell companies that they can have effectively a limitless lifeline,</p>
<p>but not the individuals. Because I do think at some point, companies will find a way to get out</p>
<p>of these loans and or break the covenants with not much repercussion.</p>
<p>Okay, I want to wrap with two sort of not doomsday scenarios, but I want to touch on politics. And I</p>
<p>also want to know, in the chance that this quarantine goes on for May and June, in other words,</p>
<p>San Francisco says, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to keep going. And New York says we&rsquo;re keeping going.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about not just April being in quarantine, but May and or June. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at June 1st or July 1st. What are the chances, David, that people say, you know what,</p>
<p>I am a free person, I want to take my life into my own hands, I want to make my own decision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going out, I&rsquo;m going to go surfing, I&rsquo;m going to do this. And we have this social unrest. And</p>
<p>how do politicians handicap that in this new world?</p>
<p>I think that could happen. I mean, particularly among young populations who are not at risk</p>
<p>as much, you know, for the relatively younger, healthier people who don&rsquo;t have comorbidity</p>
<p>factors could say, look, I&rsquo;ve got a one in 1000 chance or, you know, or less of dying if</p>
<p>even if I do get this. And I&rsquo;m just going to take that chance. But it&rsquo;s all the more reason</p>
<p>why I think we need a strategy to get out of lockdown, that already includes the idea of</p>
<p>letting out these, these people who are at much lower risk and, and isolates the people who are</p>
<p>at higher risk. And against the, you have anything to add to that, Chamath, that kind of doomsday</p>
<p>scenario, or that eventuality? Well, I think that you&rsquo;re very right, Jason, that I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get out of lockdown until June 1st at the earliest. And I think that&rsquo;s in California,</p>
<p>I think the nuisance posture is basically that if April looks like the curves are decaying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be mid May to late May before he lifts this thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can handle this.</p>
<p>And, but, but it&rsquo;s also important that that we understand, like, you know, we just talked about</p>
<p>companies. The only entity that&rsquo;s in even worse shape than companies and people are states and</p>
<p>cities and counties. Yeah, their debt is incredible. They have no revenue, and massive revenue,</p>
<p>massive costs and their nonprofits. And think of the, the, you know, the garbage collector,</p>
<p>the fireman, the police officer, the teacher, these are like, these are the backbones and</p>
<p>the pillars of our of our community. It&rsquo;s such a good thing that we were so resilient. And</p>
<p>we thought ahead and built up massive surpluses in our tax bases. Oh, wait, we didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Well, there, there were some provisions to do that these rainy day funds, but those are going</p>
<p>to get exhausted. And, you know, we&rsquo;re going to have to bail those guys out as well. So this is</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying, which is that when you&rsquo;re pumping in trillions of dollars haphazardly into the</p>
<p>capital markets before you think about people, or you think about the states and cities and</p>
<p>communities in America, I just think it&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Let me ask this even more simply, David, under what circumstance would you be willing to go back</p>
<p>to our poker game on a Monday night, and have six, seven of us around a table,</p>
<p>sharing a meal and playing cards for six hours?</p>
<p>Um, well, if there was if there was a treatment for for the virus, so that you knew that if you</p>
<p>got it, you weren&rsquo;t gonna die, that would be a big deal. Okay, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the obvious.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a Russian lead aspect to the virus right now, or even if your odds are low,</p>
<p>you know, you still don&rsquo;t want to take the chance. I think the next thing that would probably help</p>
<p>with would be that if we had this rapid ubiquitous testing, so I could know that the people who are</p>
<p>in the room with me are all tested, we&rsquo;re all tested, and we&rsquo;re all negative. And you know,</p>
<p>they could repeat the test on a frequent enough basis that we can all trust in the result.</p>
<p>That would make a big difference, I think. All right, let&rsquo;s wrap with politics. All of</p>
<p>this is occurring in an election year. Bernie is out of the race. Biden is doing a daily</p>
<p>webcast. Trump&rsquo;s ratings are through the roof, as he is more than willing to let us all know in his</p>
<p>abhorrent, narcissistic way that his ratings are just tremendous right now in the middle of</p>
<p>thousands of Americans dying a day. But we have to touch on this because elections are how we</p>
<p>govern and make these decisions is by who we put into these positions. So what do we think,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just make odds here, odds that Trump wins again? Odds that Biden wins? If you had to</p>
<p>lay the odds, if you had to give it a percentage, or you want to set a line, what are your thoughts,</p>
<p>David? I always think that these things are basically a coin flip, I mean, this far out.</p>
<p>I mean, right now, it seems like, you know, Trump&rsquo;s ratings have never been higher. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>polling relatively well. And Biden just seems completely irrelevant. But if we&rsquo;re still dealing</p>
<p>with the virus by November, if we&rsquo;ve cycled in and out of lockdown, if we have kind of an</p>
<p>unresolved situation, if the economy is in a very, very deep recession or depression, I think, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s up for grabs. Jamal, I think that if, if there is a V shaped recovery of any kind,</p>
<p>Trump will win in a landslide. Right now, we are in a V shaped recovery, the market has come back.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not. No, we&rsquo;re not. Well, if you use the market as a guide. Now, the market is,</p>
<p>the market is completely decoupled from Main Street. And so what Wall Street does is irrelevant</p>
<p>right now. What I mean by recovery is what happens on Main Street. Okay. Because if you have 16,</p>
<p>17, 20, 22% unemployment, I mean, you could feel the prancing dog and he&rsquo;ll beat Trump.</p>
<p>So I think that the President needs a massive victory. So what does the game theory say? The</p>
<p>game theory probably says that he&rsquo;ll try to force people to go back to work as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s even a modicum, a shred of evidence on some kind of, you know, therapeutic, they&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>you know, drum it up like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a cure, and try to confuse people that there&rsquo;s a vaccine.</p>
<p>But I think he needs that. Because in the absence of that, again, I just go back to</p>
<p>how difficult will it be to start real life, I think it&rsquo;s going to be difficult. And I think in</p>
<p>that people won&rsquo;t have a lot of patience for the fact that, you know, the debt will have ballooned,</p>
<p>deficits will have ballooned, trillions of dollars will have gone out the door,</p>
<p>and people will be meaningfully struggling going into Election Day. I don&rsquo;t think that that helps</p>
<p>Trump at all. And, you know, by the way, and we&rsquo;ll talk about this in our next podcast,</p>
<p>because we should probably get an economist to talk about it. But, you know, what is putting</p>
<p>$10 trillion, or whatever the final number is, it&rsquo;ll probably be 20 trillion, you know, one,</p>
<p>one times US GDP. What does that do to the economy? What does that do to long term inflation? Like,</p>
<p>if you see what&rsquo;s happening, Japan did, and they went through a lost decade or two?</p>
<p>No, I think the best better example is what happened in China, which is a combination of</p>
<p>fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2009 and 10. And the results are basically a lot of fake growth,</p>
<p>and massive inflation. And so, you know, it&rsquo;s probably useful to debate that in the next,</p>
<p>in the next pod. What are the chances? I think it creates a lot of risk for Trump.</p>
<p>What are the chances of a dark horse candidate? Yeah, in it on the zero, zero. So it&rsquo;s Biden,</p>
<p>for sure. Yeah, it&rsquo;s no chance. Barring a Biden health emergency. I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>he is. He&rsquo;s, you know, not a spring chicken. So so either person, either person gets Coronavirus,</p>
<p>it could be. Yeah. Well, no, I look if anything happened to him. Yeah. Yeah. We shouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>talk about these possibilities. So I don&rsquo;t want to sound like, you know, it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>no one wants this to happen. But I look, I think Jamal is right. They&rsquo;re not gonna replace</p>
<p>the head of the ticket absent, you know, something health wise happen.</p>
<p>What is your game theory then on how Trump will play this? Because in Chamath&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>getting back to work earlier, makes it seem like we&rsquo;re getting back to normal. And he did that.</p>
<p>But a politician might also say, you know what, I think there&rsquo;s a chance of the second wave. So</p>
<p>I want to keep it closed until June or July 1, then time it. And I know this sounds incredibly</p>
<p>cynical, that a elected official would make health and economic policy decisions on their reelection,</p>
<p>but that is the reality we live in, is it not? Sure, of course. I think the next big political</p>
<p>debate is going to be around this what now, you know, we Yes, the quarantines have arrested the</p>
<p>exponentiality of the virus, but how do we get out of them? And, and, you know, Trump&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>have to make a decision about when and how we get out. And he&rsquo;s going to be eager to get out</p>
<p>of lockdown to restart the economy. But on the other hand, if he mistimes it, and we cycle,</p>
<p>you know, the virus then takes off again, and we cycle back into the other lockdown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s very dangerous for him politically, too. So he&rsquo;s got a needle to thread there.</p>
<p>I agree. I agree with Chamath that if this ends up being V-shaped, Trump is a shoo-in.</p>
<p>But if it ends up being a recession, a deep recession or depression, if we end up,</p>
<p>then I think the question is going to be, does he appear to be more in the, is he a, is he a Hoover</p>
<p>or is he more involved in an FDR? You know, and explain that for people listening. Well, I mean,</p>
<p>so, so Hoover took took the blame for the Great Depression, FDR gets elected in 1932. We&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>in the Great Depression in 1936, when he gets reelected, you know, and because he&rsquo;s seen as,</p>
<p>as, as a man of action, he does these fireside chats, and he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s doing things. And,</p>
<p>and I do think that, you know, Trump kind of pivoted from initially being</p>
<p>a little bit flat footed on the virus and now doing these daily briefings. And I think the</p>
<p>American public is giving him credit for action right now. And so, so obviously, if those actions</p>
<p>work, I think he gets reelected. And if they don&rsquo;t work, the question is, you know, does he get</p>
<p>blamed for that? Is it, is he a Hoover or is he an FDR?</p>
<p>All right. On that note, I encourage everybody to wear masks, social distancing. And for those</p>
<p>people in the audience who are startups and investors, keep, keep the faith, keep investing,</p>
<p>keep starting companies, never a bad time to start a great company in my mind. And Chamath,</p>
<p>any final thoughts? Here we are. It&rsquo;s, what is today&rsquo;s date? Is it? I know it&rsquo;s April,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s somewhere around the 10th. Am I even close? It&rsquo;s Friday, right?</p>
<p>April 10th. Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s just make a decision to be all in on masks.</p>
<p>All in masks.</p>
<p>All in on masks. And take it into our own arms. We don&rsquo;t need to be told that these things make</p>
<p>sense. They make sense. You&rsquo;re an idiot if you think otherwise.</p>
<p>David, closing thoughts? Oh, keep going. Chamath, any other thoughts?</p>
<p>Totally agree with that. That was my blog today. We shouldn&rsquo;t have to make it the law. But I think</p>
<p>we we should because there&rsquo;s still people who aren&rsquo;t adopting it. But it&rsquo;s the lowest cost</p>
<p>thing we can do. And if you look at the Asian countries that have controlled the virus,</p>
<p>every single person wears a mask when they go out in public. Every single person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple no brainer. Give people $1,000 fine if you&rsquo;re not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Give them a warning first and hand them a mask. Like literally the cops should have masks and</p>
<p>they should hand them to you say put this mask on. And if I see you again, you get $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>The post office should put one or a number of these in everyone&rsquo;s mailbox.</p>
<p>This is the first step to having a more fine tuned policy than just quarantine.</p>
<p>And if we can&rsquo;t even get this right, then I fear for what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great execution idea. The mail carriers, every mail carrier leaves them.</p>
<p>And then you could also get the private sector. You tell every UPS FedEx driver,</p>
<p>the government gives them those masks. Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon. They just all have it. Hey, Jeff, somebody clip this and send it to Jeff. Jeff,</p>
<p>if you want to do a mitzvah, give all these masks to the drivers and just leave masks on</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s doorstep and forget about Trump and whatever government officials going to</p>
<p>drag their heels on it. Go ahead. You do it, Jeff Bezos. And hey, how great was Jack giving</p>
<p>away a billion dollars? I mean, we saw him get barbecued on social media, but</p>
<p>what a strong move, huh? And he&rsquo;s going to‚Äî Strong.</p>
<p>He put it in a Google sheet. He&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s a Google sheet.</p>
<p>And made the sheet open. I mean, it&rsquo;s the strongest move ever. It&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>everybody, you know, I&rsquo;ve always been very skeptical of philanthropy because I feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, a dalliance of the established rich in North America because they like to have</p>
<p>their names on things. And here&rsquo;s a guy who just basically pwned all of that. I don&rsquo;t need a</p>
<p>hospital with my name on it. I don&rsquo;t need a building with my name on it. Here&rsquo;s a billion</p>
<p>dollars, and here&rsquo;s a Google spreadsheet to track it, which means I&rsquo;m going to have zero</p>
<p>overhead in running it. I mean, it&rsquo;s so strong. It&rsquo;s literally like, the only thing that could</p>
<p>be stronger is if he connected it to a Stripe account. And like, as he swiped his credit card,</p>
<p>it just‚Äî It&rsquo;s just so strong.</p>
<p>He should put a Zapier that tweets it. I mean, he has a Google doc which is set</p>
<p>so that everybody can read it at all times. I mean, for a billion dollars, it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best. He should start a Slack instance</p>
<p>with like each of those non-profits having their own channel.</p>
<p>By the way, he completely pwned the Giving Pledge in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Yes. The Giving Pledge, which nobody has any‚Äî it&rsquo;s pretty opaque. Now it&rsquo;s just like, here it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, pretend you&rsquo;re going to give your money away. We don&rsquo;t need to know how much. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really need to do it. There&rsquo;s no accountability, but we have this fun party once a year.</p>
<p>We can all hang out and, you know‚Äî</p>
<p>How is the party? Is it good?</p>
<p>I slap each other. I haven&rsquo;t signed it. I&rsquo;m not signing it.</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s like, the Giving Pledge. Yeah.</p>
<p>So stupid. It&rsquo;s like the sign of insecurity.</p>
<p>Saxy Poo, thanks for coming on the pod, Rain Man. We appreciate it.</p>
<p>Love you, Saxy Poo.</p>
<p>We love you, Saxy Poo.</p>
<p>Love you, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Love you too, Chamath. Bestie C. We love you. And everybody, stay safe, seriously.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to close‚Äî</p>
<p>Wear a mask.</p>
<p>Wear a mask. And to those people on the front lines, the janitors, the Google, the Amazon</p>
<p>drivers, Instacart, people in the food supply‚Äî</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the fucking best.</p>
<p>You are the best. It&rsquo;s amazing what you&rsquo;re doing. What a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Get the money to them.</p>
<p>Yeah. And seriously, Amazon, let us tip those drivers in our‚Äî</p>
<p>Get the money to them.</p>
<p>For sure. Double the pay. Okay. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time. Bye-bye.</p>
