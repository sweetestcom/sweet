    <p>Our card this week is Eddie and Francis Sazauskas,</p>
<p>the three of clubs from Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Eddie and Francis were in their mid-70s</p>
<p>and still working hard as successful scrap metal dealers,</p>
<p>when one day, a monster showed up in their junkyard,</p>
<p>leaving behind a mystery</p>
<p>that has lasted for more than three decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>A little after 9 o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday, November 30th, 1988,</p>
<p>Herbert Baumgart arrived to his friend Eddie&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>to start the workday.</p>
<p>He was moving a little slower that morning</p>
<p>because there was a fresh dusting of snow on the roads</p>
<p>in their small town of Sheboygan, Wisconsin,</p>
<p>and he wanted to drive safely.</p>
<p>Herbert was 72 and only worked one day a week</p>
<p>at his friend&rsquo;s well-known junk business,</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s Jalopi Jungle.</p>
<p>Jalopi is a term for an old car,</p>
<p>and Eddie had fields full of old cars.</p>
<p>Eddie was 75, so a few years older than Herbert,</p>
<p>and he ran the business with his 73-year-old wife, Frances.</p>
<p>The two sometimes joked about retirement,</p>
<p>but never fully committed.</p>
<p>Eddie was a junk dealer,</p>
<p>which basically meant that he collected</p>
<p>and bought old discarded cars and car parts</p>
<p>and other secondhand stuff to resell or trade.</p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s property was massive, over 80 acres,</p>
<p>and spread around it were several barns and fields</p>
<p>full of rusty old stuff.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve looked like a mess,</p>
<p>but it was an organized mess,</p>
<p>and Eddie and Frances lived in a house</p>
<p>on the back of their property near a big barn.</p>
<p>As Herbert turned down their driveway</p>
<p>that Wednesday morning, he noticed that it was extra quiet.</p>
<p>He parked his car by the barn</p>
<p>closest to Eddie and Frances&rsquo; house</p>
<p>and tried to get into the barn, but the door was locked.</p>
<p>Now that immediately stuck out as odd,</p>
<p>because every time he&rsquo;d come over</p>
<p>to help Eddie out with work before,</p>
<p>that barn had never been locked.</p>
<p>In fact, it was even weirder</p>
<p>that Eddie wasn&rsquo;t already out working,</p>
<p>because usually Herbert would hardly ever</p>
<p>beat Eddie to the barn.</p>
<p>Eddie was always the first to rise in the morning</p>
<p>and get to work.</p>
<p>When Herbert looked between the couple&rsquo;s house and the barn,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t notice any tire marks or fresh footprints</p>
<p>in the snow between the two locations.</p>
<p>So he figured the only explanation</p>
<p>was that maybe Eddie and Frances had a late breakfast</p>
<p>and were taking things slow.</p>
<p>So his next move was to head toward the house</p>
<p>and knock on their door.</p>
<p>Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Misty Nelson</p>
<p>said Herbert rapped on the front door a few times</p>
<p>and no one answered.</p>
<p>But when he tried that door, it was unlocked.</p>
<p>And he walks in and doesn&rsquo;t see anyone in the house</p>
<p>and actually notices that the beds are made.</p>
<p>So he knows that they&rsquo;re around somewhere</p>
<p>and then goes back out to the barn again.</p>
<p>Herbert was able to get into the barn</p>
<p>using a back door that was unlocked,</p>
<p>but it was dark when he stepped inside.</p>
<p>So he couldn&rsquo;t see much,</p>
<p>except the outline of some objects and things laying around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he peeks around and sees</p>
<p>what we believe is probably just a body</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>Herbert fumbled around and found the lights.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he saw the scene</p>
<p>was far worse than he first thought.</p>
<p>On the floor, close to the barn&rsquo;s front door</p>
<p>was the body of his friend, Eddie.</p>
<p>And laying right next to him was Eddie&rsquo;s wife, Frances.</p>
<p>It was a horrifying scene.</p>
<p>Eddie looked like he&rsquo;d been severely beaten in the head</p>
<p>and was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Frances was on her side,</p>
<p>but by the way she was positioned,</p>
<p>it made it so that parts of both of their bodies</p>
<p>were overlapped.</p>
<p>Herbert wasn&rsquo;t able to see Frances&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>so he couldn&rsquo;t tell if she had suffered</p>
<p>a similar savage beating like her husband.</p>
<p>All he could tell was that neither of them were breathing.</p>
<p>Within seconds of seeing his friends,</p>
<p>Herbert picked up a phone that was in the barn</p>
<p>and called police at 9.38 a.m.</p>
<p>He had called in 911 and had stated</p>
<p>that he had found a man down not breathing in the barn</p>
<p>and then had said that it was the Jalopy Jungle,</p>
<p>which locals here were aware of what that is.</p>
<p>It was a local junkyard.</p>
<p>While he waited for authorities to arrive,</p>
<p>Herbert stepped outside to catch his breath.</p>
<p>He was freaked out being in the barn all by himself.</p>
<p>I mean, what if the killer was still in there?</p>
<p>He had no idea, but he wasn&rsquo;t gonna take any chances.</p>
<p>The Sezauskas&rsquo; property was technically in Sheboygan County,</p>
<p>just outside the town limits.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to know at the time,</p>
<p>it was in the middle of a possible annexation with the town,</p>
<p>which caused some initial confusion</p>
<p>about which law enforcement jurisdiction</p>
<p>was sent to respond.</p>
<p>But eventually, paramedics and law enforcement officers</p>
<p>from both the town and the county arrived to the scene.</p>
<p>Medical staff were able to determine pretty quickly</p>
<p>that Eddie and Francis had no signs of life.</p>
<p>And after a call to the county coroner</p>
<p>to bring them on scene, the two were pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Right away, deputies got to work looking around.</p>
<p>The barn was full of random stuff.</p>
<p>To be honest, under any other circumstances,</p>
<p>would have appeared to have had signs of ransacking,</p>
<p>but the clutter was to be expected</p>
<p>since Eddie operated a junkyard.</p>
<p>Signs of the couple&rsquo;s physical attack were obvious, though.</p>
<p>There was blood on some big metal barrels near their bodies</p>
<p>and even more of it on the floor.</p>
<p>Sergeant Lance Dassler,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s worked the Sezauskas&rsquo; case since about 2005,</p>
<p>said investigators at the scene knew immediately</p>
<p>that the couple had been killed inside the barn.</p>
<p>With the blood that&rsquo;s on these things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we believe that the actual beating</p>
<p>occurred in that room.</p>
<p>Despite searching through all of the junk</p>
<p>and seeing tools and things that might have been able</p>
<p>to cause the couple&rsquo;s fatal injuries,</p>
<p>an obvious murder weapon,</p>
<p>like something with blood or hair on it,</p>
<p>was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>One of the responding officers on the scene</p>
<p>speculated that they might be dealing with a murder-suicide.</p>
<p>But after everyone gave that theory some more thought,</p>
<p>the idea fizzled out.</p>
<p>I mean, just from looking at the layout</p>
<p>of the crime scene itself,</p>
<p>the victims&rsquo; injuries,</p>
<p>and the absence of any kind of obvious murder weapons</p>
<p>near their bodies, it didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>When they searched Eddie and Frances for any clues,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they noticed that Eddie&rsquo;s wallet was missing.</p>
<p>So then detectives wondered</p>
<p>if the killer was motivated by money,</p>
<p>like a robbery gone wrong.</p>
<p>Photos were taken of the scene</p>
<p>and one of the officers did a videotape walkthrough</p>
<p>of the inside and outside of the barn.</p>
<p>But this was 1988,</p>
<p>and whether it was due to a lack of resources</p>
<p>or a lack of training,</p>
<p>the images they captured were few,</p>
<p>and even the ones they did get were not the best quality.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t take as many photographs</p>
<p>and that of the other parts of the barn,</p>
<p>whereas now, if this happened today,</p>
<p>we would have every inch of this place photographed</p>
<p>and video recorded.</p>
<p>Back then, what do we have,</p>
<p>30-something photos of the crime scene?</p>
<p>32 photos to be exact,</p>
<p>which for a double murder case, Sergeant Dassler is right,</p>
<p>that is not many at all.</p>
<p>Once deputies were done taking videos and photos,</p>
<p>the coroner transported the victims&rsquo; bodies for autopsy</p>
<p>and the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>notified Eddie and Frances&rsquo;s family members.</p>
<p>The couple didn&rsquo;t have any children,</p>
<p>but they each had siblings, nieces, and nephews</p>
<p>that they were close with,</p>
<p>who lived nearby and throughout Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Once the family knew,</p>
<p>the word of the crime spread fast throughout the community.</p>
<p>This was big news.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have homicides very often</p>
<p>in Sheboygan County, thankfully, and we still don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very fortunate like that,</p>
<p>so for this to be a double homicide</p>
<p>of an elderly couple at that,</p>
<p>people running a business, just trying to,</p>
<p>hardworking people still working at their age,</p>
<p>it was big news.</p>
<p>I grew up in Sheboygan, I remember when it happened.</p>
<p>I was a kid just out of high school at that point,</p>
<p>or still in high school at that point,</p>
<p>and, no, everybody was talking about it.</p>
<p>It was big news in Sheboygan, too,</p>
<p>that something like this had happened.</p>
<p>In some cases, word was spreading so fast,</p>
<p>it got to family members before police could,</p>
<p>like with Frances&rsquo;s sister, Annette.</p>
<p>Annette was actually one</p>
<p>of the first people investigators talked to,</p>
<p>but she told detectives</p>
<p>that before police ever even came over,</p>
<p>her phone had been ringing off the hook,</p>
<p>with family members telling her bits and pieces</p>
<p>of disjointed information</p>
<p>that basically something bad had happened</p>
<p>over at Frances and Eddie&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>Eventually, a family member called her that morning</p>
<p>and said Eddie was found dead,</p>
<p>but the details were slim,</p>
<p>and the relative wasn&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to tell her anything about Frances.</p>
<p>Annette said she tried a few times</p>
<p>to call over to her sister&rsquo;s place, but no one answered.</p>
<p>And Annette knew this was weird</p>
<p>because she said that she</p>
<p>and Frances talked on the phone regularly,</p>
<p>like multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It was at that point police had to break the news to her.</p>
<p>Eddie was, in fact, dead, and so was her sister.</p>
<p>And worse, the two had been murdered.</p>
<p>After she regained her composure,</p>
<p>she helped detectives start to form a timeline</p>
<p>of the couple&rsquo;s last communications and movements.</p>
<p>Annette revealed that she had talked</p>
<p>to Frances Tuesday morning, November 29th, at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>That was just 24 hours before the crime scene was discovered.</p>
<p>They were talking about it snowing,</p>
<p>and Frances was talking about having to go into town,</p>
<p>and in the afternoon it called for rain,</p>
<p>and that she would maybe just wait</p>
<p>until the afternoon to go</p>
<p>because of the snow in the morning.</p>
<p>When Annette called back around 11.50,</p>
<p>there was no answer and no call back.</p>
<p>And then, so she called again around 8 p.m. that evening,</p>
<p>and again, no answer.</p>
<p>Based on that information, police started to wonder</p>
<p>if Annette&rsquo;s calls that Frances had missed on Tuesday</p>
<p>meant that Eddie and Frances were killed that day,</p>
<p>and not the morning of Wednesday, November 30th,</p>
<p>like investigators initially thought.</p>
<p>The next person authorities talked to</p>
<p>was Eddie and Frances&rsquo; nephew, a man named Dale,</p>
<p>who said that he&rsquo;d also tried to reach Eddie and Frances</p>
<p>on November 29th.</p>
<p>He said that he received no answer</p>
<p>after leaving the phone ring 10 to 15 times,</p>
<p>and then Dale said that his wife had also tried calling</p>
<p>every hour after 10 p.m.</p>
<p>in an effort to make contact with them.</p>
<p>Dale and his wife were a little worried</p>
<p>that Eddie and Frances weren&rsquo;t answering,</p>
<p>but they held off on calling the police for a welfare check</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t think it was totally warranted.</p>
<p>On Thursday, just a day after Eddie and Frances were found,</p>
<p>news of their murders hit local newsstands and TV outlets.</p>
<p>The December 1st, 1988 front page of the Sheboygan Press</p>
<p>read, Homicide Suspected in Death of Couple.</p>
<p>A photo of a cop car parked outside the Sezauskas&rsquo; barn</p>
<p>ran underneath the headline.</p>
<p>The article quoted officials from a news conference</p>
<p>they held that morning.</p>
<p>A Sheboygan County District Attorney at the time</p>
<p>said the couple&rsquo;s cause of death were still being determined,</p>
<p>but since all signs pointed to their deaths</p>
<p>being suspicious in nature,</p>
<p>the case was being investigated as a double homicide.</p>
<p>Reporters at the press conference asked officials</p>
<p>if they determined a motive for the crime,</p>
<p>but detectives couldn&rsquo;t provide one,</p>
<p>reiterating that Eddie and Frances were well-known,</p>
<p>loved, and respected in the community.</p>
<p>Basically, they would say it was just too early to speculate.</p>
<p>Later that same day, a resident pathologist in Sheboygan County</p>
<p>conducted the couple&rsquo;s autopsies at a local hospital.</p>
<p>While investigators awaited those results,</p>
<p>they continued to process the crime scene for clues.</p>
<p>Like Sergeant Dassler said earlier,</p>
<p>detectives&rsquo; main theory at the time</p>
<p>was that Eddie and Frances had been killed in the barn.</p>
<p>But just for good measure,</p>
<p>deputies also wanted to look around the couple&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>for more evidence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s during that search</p>
<p>that police found something really interesting.</p>
<p>When Sheboygan County deputies processed Eddie and Frances&rsquo; house</p>
<p>after their murders,</p>
<p>they found signs that things weren&rsquo;t quite right.</p>
<p>There was definitely something that happened in the house</p>
<p>that leads us to believe</p>
<p>that there was some type of initial confrontation in the house.</p>
<p>If that sounds vague to you, that&rsquo;s because it is.</p>
<p>Wisconsin investigators still won&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>what they found inside Eddie and Frances&rsquo; house.</p>
<p>What Sergeant Dassler would confirm for our team</p>
<p>is that the house itself was not ransacked.</p>
<p>And this detail about what deputies found in the house</p>
<p>would be something that only the killer or killers</p>
<p>would know about,</p>
<p>which is why they aren&rsquo;t telling the public.</p>
<p>Whatever this clue was,</p>
<p>it strongly indicated to investigators</p>
<p>that the house was not ransacked.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re not going to go into the details</p>
<p>of what happened in the house right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go into the details of what happened</p>
<p>It strongly indicated to investigators back in the day</p>
<p>that whoever the suspect or suspects were,</p>
<p>they might have come over to the junkyard</p>
<p>with intentions to rob the couple.</p>
<p>That idea has been floated</p>
<p>with a lot of different variations.</p>
<p>Eddie stumbles across these people on the property,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re looking for money.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they confront him,</p>
<p>whether or not somebody then goes into the house</p>
<p>to get Frances, to try to get her,</p>
<p>to encourage him to cooperate and give the money up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not certain, obviously.</p>
<p>After the newspaper story about the couple&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>on Thursday, December 1st,</p>
<p>members of the community started calling in tips.</p>
<p>And there was a theme among those phone calls</p>
<p>that fed into this idea</p>
<p>that perhaps robbery was the killer&rsquo;s main motive.</p>
<p>So there were always rumors that they had a lot of money.</p>
<p>You know, the business that they were involved in</p>
<p>was a lot of times,</p>
<p>in particular back in the 80s, was all cash.</p>
<p>Eddie was kind of rumored</p>
<p>to always have like a roll of cash on him</p>
<p>when he was out and about in the community.</p>
<p>So people knew that he had cash.</p>
<p>There were rumors that we&rsquo;ve heard during the investigation</p>
<p>that people would say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, there was rumors</p>
<p>that they had cash hidden around on the property</p>
<p>and things of that nature.</p>
<p>Before authorities could really dig into those leads,</p>
<p>the autopsy results for Eddie came in.</p>
<p>An article in the Sheboygan Press from December 2nd</p>
<p>reported that Eddie had been hit in the head</p>
<p>with a blunt object enough times</p>
<p>to cause catastrophic open wounds.</p>
<p>He had been bludgeoned to death.</p>
<p>But Frances, on the other hand, was a different story.</p>
<p>Pathologists had a hard time figuring out</p>
<p>exactly how she died.</p>
<p>The Sheboygan County coroner at the time,</p>
<p>a man named Dave Leffin,</p>
<p>said that he couldn&rsquo;t rule out blunt force trauma</p>
<p>or strangulation for Frances&rsquo; cause of death.</p>
<p>He said the only thing he could rule out was a heart attack.</p>
<p>But then Leffin turned right around</p>
<p>and basically contradicted himself</p>
<p>when he told the Sheboygan Press</p>
<p>that Frances&rsquo; autopsy, quote,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t rule out several possibilities,</p>
<p>such as dying of fright</p>
<p>as if she had just seen her husband get killed, end quote.</p>
<p>Since the autopsy results were gonna be crucial</p>
<p>to the investigation,</p>
<p>the coroner called in backup from a forensic pathologist</p>
<p>with the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>As investigators at the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>awaited that doctor&rsquo;s findings,</p>
<p>they headed back to the barn</p>
<p>to continue looking for clues or items</p>
<p>that might have been used to inflict Eddie&rsquo;s injuries.</p>
<p>They wanted and honestly needed to find the murder weapon</p>
<p>if it was laying around there somewhere,</p>
<p>blending in with the rest of the junk in the barn.</p>
<p>But as you can imagine,</p>
<p>finding a club-like murder weapon</p>
<p>that was used in a deadly beating in a barn full of junk</p>
<p>proved to be damn near impossible.</p>
<p>There were tire irons, pipes, car parts, wrenches,</p>
<p>and other tools and machinery</p>
<p>that could have easily been used to kill someone.</p>
<p>The problem was none of those things had any blood on them</p>
<p>and most didn&rsquo;t appear as if they&rsquo;d been cleaned either.</p>
<p>Detectives even sent a dive team</p>
<p>to search the nearby Pigeon River,</p>
<p>but that turned up nothing.</p>
<p>But luckily, the Milwaukee Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>did have something.</p>
<p>By December of 1988,</p>
<p>they had determined a cause of death for Frances.</p>
<p>She was strangled to death.</p>
<p>This was confusing to investigators back then.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s confusing to me now.</p>
<p>I mean, for one thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange that there weren&rsquo;t more obvious signs of that</p>
<p>for the coroner to see,</p>
<p>but most importantly,</p>
<p>their two victims had two different causes of death.</p>
<p>So different, in fact,</p>
<p>that the medical findings caused detectives to wonder</p>
<p>if they were dealing with two killers instead of just one.</p>
<p>Maybe someone held Eddie</p>
<p>and decided to beat him in front of Frances,</p>
<p>which then caused her to scream,</p>
<p>so maybe another perpetrator strangled her.</p>
<p>All of the questions and possible scenarios</p>
<p>were swirling for investigators.</p>
<p>And there were actually some details</p>
<p>in the couple&rsquo;s autopsy reports</p>
<p>that somewhat supported this version of events.</p>
<p>The documents stated that there were ligature markings</p>
<p>found on their bodies,</p>
<p>which made detectives strongly suspect</p>
<p>that both Eddie and Frances</p>
<p>could have been tied up before they were killed.</p>
<p>The only thing that didn&rsquo;t jive with that</p>
<p>was the fact that when their bodies were found,</p>
<p>there were no restraints on them,</p>
<p>nothing like rope or twine anywhere.</p>
<p>So either the killer removed the ligatures</p>
<p>after killing the couple and took it with them,</p>
<p>or the marks were from something else</p>
<p>that police couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>Tied up or not, the big question was still about motive.</p>
<p>Despite searching all over Eddie and Frances&rsquo; barn,</p>
<p>home, and property,</p>
<p>police never had any luck finding money stashed away</p>
<p>or large quantities of cash</p>
<p>that the couple were rumored to have had.</p>
<p>And if somehow it was just missed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably never gonna be found.</p>
<p>In the years since the crime,</p>
<p>their acreage has been sold</p>
<p>and part of it annexed into the city limits.</p>
<p>The barns are no longer there,</p>
<p>and even the road near their property has been rerouted.</p>
<p>Today, the area looks nothing like it did back in 1988.</p>
<p>For weeks after the crime,</p>
<p>deputies with the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>worked through tons of tips that they&rsquo;d received,</p>
<p>and they decided there were three main angles,</p>
<p>or I guess you could say there are three concrete leads</p>
<p>that they felt were worth pursuing.</p>
<p>The first, and probably the farthest stretch</p>
<p>in investigators&rsquo; eyes,</p>
<p>was that maybe the couple had been killed</p>
<p>because Eddie had been resistant</p>
<p>to let his 80 acres of land be annexed by the town.</p>
<p>Eddie and Frances&rsquo; great nephew, Justin Skvars,</p>
<p>has heard this rumor over and over throughout the years,</p>
<p>and he believes wholeheartedly it is far-fetched.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a number of people reach out to me on Facebook</p>
<p>and send me their tin hat takes on this,</p>
<p>and I mean, it&rsquo;s just so preposterous.</p>
<p>Justin lives out of state now,</p>
<p>but he was born and raised in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>He was just a toddler</p>
<p>when his great aunt and uncle were killed.</p>
<p>I certainly think that my parents shielded me</p>
<p>from what had happened at the time</p>
<p>and probably maybe discussed it in front of me,</p>
<p>but I was maybe too young to understand.</p>
<p>I certainly remember going to the junkyard pretty vividly.</p>
<p>They were such good people,</p>
<p>and everybody that I reached out to,</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t have a tip or a lead,</p>
<p>told me a great story about how Eddie and Fran</p>
<p>either cut them a deal or helped them out</p>
<p>or was willing to lend a hand when other places weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office never seriously considered the theory</p>
<p>about Eddie being a target over his land</p>
<p>possibly being annexed by the town.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true that Eddie fought against the annexation,</p>
<p>but according to everyone our team interviewed,</p>
<p>his conversations about it with town officials were civil.</p>
<p>Justin said, out of all the rumors</p>
<p>that still pop up about Eddie and Francis&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>that one might be the worst.</p>
<p>I can tell you that in Sheboygan County,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no land worth a double murder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those theories</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t want to seem to go away,</p>
<p>and people always just seem to bring it up.</p>
<p>The next lead police looked into</p>
<p>came from information they&rsquo;d received</p>
<p>about a high school kid</p>
<p>who lived really close to Eddie and Francis.</p>
<p>There was an individual who, at the time of the crimes,</p>
<p>was like 17 or 18 years old</p>
<p>who ran his mouth at some parties in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>So he was a high school-aged kid,</p>
<p>ran his mouth at some parties.</p>
<p>Like, he was the tough guy,</p>
<p>and he was responsible for the murders.</p>
<p>He lived a couple blocks away from the Zazowskis'.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dassler said detectives at the time</p>
<p>interviewed the teenager,</p>
<p>but he denied being involved in the murders.</p>
<p>Deputies continued to keep the pressure on him</p>
<p>in follow-up interviews,</p>
<p>but every time he denied any involvement,</p>
<p>saying that he was just mouthing off at a party</p>
<p>and people shouldn&rsquo;t have taken him seriously.</p>
<p>Ultimately, police started to doubt his viability</p>
<p>as a suspect the longer that they spoke with him,</p>
<p>because at one point,</p>
<p>they learned that he&rsquo;d bragged</p>
<p>about shooting the Zazowskis'.</p>
<p>Apparently, he&rsquo;d said this statement to a friend</p>
<p>before the couple&rsquo;s cause of death were made public,</p>
<p>and police knew that the evidence did not show</p>
<p>a gun had been used in the murders.</p>
<p>Some of the things that were coming in</p>
<p>in reference to him being involved</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t match the crime scene.</p>
<p>There was talk that they were shot, and they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s things like that,</p>
<p>but those things really sidetracked people</p>
<p>for a long time in the investigation.</p>
<p>The rumor about the teenage boy bragging around town</p>
<p>made its way back to Eddie and Frances&rsquo; family members,</p>
<p>and it was truly hurtful.</p>
<p>So sick and so disgusting</p>
<p>that you would brag about committing a double murder</p>
<p>of an elderly couple</p>
<p>and take it as some kind of badge of honor</p>
<p>or make it look like you did this and you&rsquo;re to be feared.</p>
<p>It took police back in the late 80s a long time</p>
<p>to figure out that the bragging teenager lead</p>
<p>was a waste of their time.</p>
<p>So it was months before they really moved on</p>
<p>to their next theory.</p>
<p>Their last solid avenue of the investigation</p>
<p>had to do with this local guy</p>
<p>who was known for burglarizing businesses in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>We know his real name,</p>
<p>but police asked us not to reveal it,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna call him Roger throughout this episode.</p>
<p>He was a bad guy, I guess, for lack of better terms.</p>
<p>He was a career criminal,</p>
<p>kind of was known as kind of a fighter in the area.</p>
<p>Roger was known to target local businesses</p>
<p>and steal cash from their registers.</p>
<p>A lot of the tips the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>fielded in the first few weeks of the investigation</p>
<p>had to do with him being involved somehow.</p>
<p>So police wanted to talk to Roger</p>
<p>and anyone he ran around town with.</p>
<p>They got a hold of four of his friends,</p>
<p>three of whom who all agreed to be interviewed by police.</p>
<p>And each of those guys denied committing the murders.</p>
<p>And the fourth guy just flat out refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>But deputies also interviewed people</p>
<p>associated with the men,</p>
<p>like their spouses and other acquaintances.</p>
<p>And they got enough information to confirm</p>
<p>that the men and Roger had all been together</p>
<p>at a roofing job earlier in the day on November 29th.</p>
<p>And none of them seemed to have had strong alibis</p>
<p>for that afternoon,</p>
<p>which was the window of time</p>
<p>that authorities believed Fran and Addie had been killed.</p>
<p>Investigators felt in their guts</p>
<p>that if the group was involved,</p>
<p>Roger was definitely their ringleader.</p>
<p>He was this guy who once you probably met him,</p>
<p>you probably didn&rsquo;t forget him.</p>
<p>He had white, almost, or blonde, almost white hair,</p>
<p>real ice blue eyes is what everybody else said.</p>
<p>He kind of stood out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a good chance that they recognized him</p>
<p>and he knew, based on what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t leave them.</p>
<p>Roger&rsquo;s criminal history built him such a reputation</p>
<p>as a brazen burglar,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s the subject of folklore in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>People there still tell stories about him</p>
<p>and how he was known to walk into businesses after hours</p>
<p>and literally pick up safes full of money and valuables</p>
<p>and just carry them out by himself,</p>
<p>like some kind of supervillain.</p>
<p>Deputies and town police officers</p>
<p>knew Roger&rsquo;s lengthy rap sheet made him a strong suspect.</p>
<p>So they worked to build a case against him</p>
<p>for several of the other crimes</p>
<p>they believed he was responsible for around town,</p>
<p>basically thinking that</p>
<p>if they could just put enough pressure on him,</p>
<p>he would come clean about the Sosowskis&rsquo; homicides.</p>
<p>While they sat on Roger,</p>
<p>authorities knew they needed to find physical evidence</p>
<p>that might tie him to the crime,</p>
<p>or at least eliminate him entirely.</p>
<p>In 1988, DNA testing came on the scene.</p>
<p>So investigators sent the clothing</p>
<p>that Francis and Eddie had been wearing</p>
<p>when they were killed</p>
<p>to the state crime lab for further analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because the technology</p>
<p>was still so limited at the time,</p>
<p>techs weren&rsquo;t able to detect any foreign DNA</p>
<p>on any of the items.</p>
<p>Then in June of 1989,</p>
<p>a cleaning crew that had been hired</p>
<p>to clean out Eddie and Francis&rsquo; barn</p>
<p>came across something that police had missed,</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s wallet.</p>
<p>Cleaners had found it discarded</p>
<p>in a random barrel inside the barn.</p>
<p>They turned the wallet over</p>
<p>to the Sheboygan County detectives</p>
<p>who opened it up and found no cash inside, only Eddie&rsquo;s ID.</p>
<p>Just like all the physical evidence so far in this case,</p>
<p>the wallet was sent off to the state lab for processing,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t find any fingerprints or DNA on it.</p>
<p>A few months later, in the fall of 1989,</p>
<p>police arrested Roger</p>
<p>and they charged him with 20 burglaries,</p>
<p>crimes totally unrelated to the double homicide.</p>
<p>When it came time for his sentencing,</p>
<p>the judge gave 44-year-old Roger 100 years in prison.</p>
<p>So basically a life sentence.</p>
<p>According to court documents,</p>
<p>Roger and his lawyers appealed that sentence,</p>
<p>arguing to the state&rsquo;s high court that it was excessive.</p>
<p>The justices on the appellate level</p>
<p>ended up agreeing with their argument</p>
<p>and then Roger was given a lesser sentence,</p>
<p>95 years instead of 100.</p>
<p>How that makes a ton of sense, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but back to prison he went.</p>
<p>Despite all their efforts to pressure Roger</p>
<p>while he served time,</p>
<p>detectives working Francis in Eddie&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t have any hard evidence</p>
<p>linking him to the two murders,</p>
<p>but he still remained their best suspect.</p>
<p>In 1990, so two years after the murders,</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s office officially confirmed to the local press</p>
<p>that they had a suspect,</p>
<p>though without specifically naming Roger.</p>
<p>But reading between the lines,</p>
<p>everyone in the area, including the public and the press,</p>
<p>assumed that Roger was who authorities considered their guy.</p>
<p>Throughout the early 1990s,</p>
<p>investigators worked to investigate Roger</p>
<p>and his associates,</p>
<p>and each of them was brought in for polygraph exams.</p>
<p>But the results aren&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>Current investigators don&rsquo;t have any documentation</p>
<p>of what was said in those lie detector tests</p>
<p>or who might have passed and who might have failed.</p>
<p>Detectives working the case today</p>
<p>chalk the absence of these reports</p>
<p>up to the detectives in the 90s not taking very good notes.</p>
<p>Dassler and Nelson said if the investigators back then</p>
<p>did at some point have documentation</p>
<p>of the polygraph results,</p>
<p>they also might have just gotten lost</p>
<p>in unorganized evidence storage,</p>
<p>which is actually more common than you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>But regardless, the polygraphs that were done in the 90s</p>
<p>must not have been very helpful</p>
<p>because after that, the case went cold.</p>
<p>Throughout the late 90s, as DNA testing was evolving,</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s office resubmitted the victim&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>for further analysis as many times as possible,</p>
<p>hoping for a break in the case.</p>
<p>But every time they got a call from the lab,</p>
<p>they got bad news.</p>
<p>The results were worthless.</p>
<p>The tests were still not detecting any foreign DNA</p>
<p>on the clothing, which could mean one of two things.</p>
<p>Either the technology back then wasn&rsquo;t good enough,</p>
<p>which we all know was the case in the 90s</p>
<p>when the use of DNA testing in criminal cases was still new,</p>
<p>or two, the killer or killers literally did not leave</p>
<p>any DNA at the crime scene.</p>
<p>So with no forensic evidence materializing</p>
<p>despite so many submissions to the DNA lab,</p>
<p>the case continued to stall.</p>
<p>Tips eventually stopped coming in too,</p>
<p>and investigators were losing hope of ever closing the case.</p>
<p>But then in the summer of 1998, a decade after the crime,</p>
<p>something unbelievable happened.</p>
<p>They asked him specifically if he was involved</p>
<p>and he said, yes, but I didn&rsquo;t hurt them.</p>
<p>I only wanted to take their money.</p>
<p>In June of 1998, the sheriff&rsquo;s office heard that Roger,</p>
<p>their primary suspect in the murders,</p>
<p>was dying of cancer in prison.</p>
<p>So they thought, how about we try</p>
<p>and get a deathbed confession out of him?</p>
<p>But instead of sending a Sheboygan County detective,</p>
<p>an FBI agent who was familiar with Roger</p>
<p>and already had some rapport with him</p>
<p>from his other crimes was sent to do the interview.</p>
<p>He goes there, interviews him.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he gives a quasi confession</p>
<p>to being involved in this case.</p>
<p>He essentially says that he was aware</p>
<p>of the Jalopy Jungle having a lot of money</p>
<p>hidden around the junkyard</p>
<p>and that him and his partners just wanted the money.</p>
<p>Now, this sounds like a solid break in the case, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this federal agent must have been standing</p>
<p>over Roger&rsquo;s hospital prison bed thinking,</p>
<p>okay, game over, case solved, we can all go home now.</p>
<p>But somehow, for reasons current homicide detectives</p>
<p>cannot even explain,</p>
<p>the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>never got word of this deathbed half confession,</p>
<p>which I know is bananas.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more wild, Wisconsin investigators</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even find out about it until 2006, eight years later.</p>
<p>We see in a report, there&rsquo;s like a fax cover sheet</p>
<p>that says, hey, here&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>See what you can do with this.</p>
<p>But yet there&rsquo;s no report attached to it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>The fax didn&rsquo;t come through completely</p>
<p>and the detective who he sent it to got tied up</p>
<p>and never followed up to say,</p>
<p>hey, where&rsquo;s the rest of the report or whatever?</p>
<p>But we hadn&rsquo;t seen that until we found that fax sheet</p>
<p>just going through the files one day.</p>
<p>And get this, Roger died literally</p>
<p>the day after his confession to the FBI agent.</p>
<p>So even if county detectives had known about it at the time,</p>
<p>it was too late for them to go back</p>
<p>and ask him any follow-up questions.</p>
<p>So in 2006, when new detectives</p>
<p>who were reinvestigating the Sazowskis case</p>
<p>tracked down the full 1998 interview with Roger,</p>
<p>they were really looking forward to hearing for themselves</p>
<p>exactly what he said.</p>
<p>But once they got ahold of the tape,</p>
<p>they realized that there were actually</p>
<p>some things Roger mentioned that didn&rsquo;t really add up.</p>
<p>For one, Roger said something</p>
<p>about putting the couple in a closet,</p>
<p>which was a detail homicide detectives</p>
<p>had no evidence to support.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking something&rsquo;s just not right about this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anything about them</p>
<p>having been in a closet, things like that.</p>
<p>So what we decided to do is we start looking</p>
<p>at previous crimes that these guys were involved in.</p>
<p>Police found out that Roger and his group of friends</p>
<p>had committed a home invasion</p>
<p>not long before Eddie and Frances&rsquo; murders</p>
<p>in a neighboring county.</p>
<p>That crime involved an elderly couple</p>
<p>that they had tied up and put in a closet.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one major difference</p>
<p>between that crime and the Sazowskis case.</p>
<p>Roger and his friends didn&rsquo;t kill the other couple.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even injure them.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure the ordeal was still very traumatic</p>
<p>for those two victims,</p>
<p>but Roger and his buddies just stole some money</p>
<p>and then left.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dassler has always wondered</p>
<p>if maybe Roger had been so heavily medicated</p>
<p>and close to death when he spoke with the FBI</p>
<p>that maybe he might&rsquo;ve gotten the two crimes confused.</p>
<p>According to police,</p>
<p>during his June 1998 interview with the FBI agent,</p>
<p>Roger became so sick that his nurse at the prison</p>
<p>had to respond to the room and adjust his oxygen.</p>
<p>So medical staff stopped the interview</p>
<p>and then Roger died.</p>
<p>So around the time that Sergeant Dassler</p>
<p>was finding this out in 2006,</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s office started working</p>
<p>with the Wisconsin Department of Justice</p>
<p>to take another crack at solving the case,</p>
<p>which generated some publicity.</p>
<p>Based on some of those news stories that ran in 2007,</p>
<p>Francis and Eddie&rsquo;s nephew, Justin,</p>
<p>took a renewed interest in his aunt and uncle&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>I was in law school at the time</p>
<p>and because Eddie and Fran had no children,</p>
<p>there was nobody really following up</p>
<p>with law enforcement at the time.</p>
<p>So because of my burdening legal background,</p>
<p>I decided that I would kind of take the reins</p>
<p>and be my family&rsquo;s advocate for Eddie and Fran.</p>
<p>In 2007 and 2008, Justin started doing some outreach</p>
<p>to see what he could find out.</p>
<p>He also filed records requests</p>
<p>to launch an informal investigation of his own.</p>
<p>To be honest with you, you know,</p>
<p>I had always known that there had been suspects</p>
<p>and that there was a group of suspects specifically</p>
<p>that were always suspected to have activity</p>
<p>or be involvement at least,</p>
<p>but social media was a real game changer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a tool that obviously my parents</p>
<p>and my grandparents didn&rsquo;t have at their disposal</p>
<p>and certainly not in 1988.</p>
<p>It allowed me to finally be able to reach out to those people</p>
<p>and speak to them directly, introduce myself,</p>
<p>tell them who I was,</p>
<p>tell them that I had a personal interest in the story</p>
<p>and to ask questions.</p>
<p>In 2008, on the 20-year anniversary of their murders,</p>
<p>the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>put up billboards around town</p>
<p>asking for anyone with information on the cold case</p>
<p>to come forward.</p>
<p>The billboards showed Francis and Eddie&rsquo;s photos.</p>
<p>The county strategically placed them on specific roads</p>
<p>knowing Roger&rsquo;s old co-conspirators</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been involved in his previous crimes</p>
<p>would drive by and see them.</p>
<p>And that did drum up a new lead,</p>
<p>one that detectives thought could close the case for good.</p>
<p>We ultimately end up with some witnesses,</p>
<p>one witness in particular that says,</p>
<p>I was driving through that day,</p>
<p>I end up seeing people that I&rsquo;m familiar with,</p>
<p>one of them being in the area of the Chilappe jungle.</p>
<p>That name the witness mentioned was Roger,</p>
<p>but the witness was loosely credible.</p>
<p>He told authorities that back in 1988,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d been Roger&rsquo;s cocaine dealer.</p>
<p>And on November 29th,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d been coming through Sheboygan with his girlfriend</p>
<p>and he had seen Roger and Roger&rsquo;s van</p>
<p>at Eddie and Francis&rsquo;s house the day of the murders.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dassler and his partner at the time</p>
<p>did confirm the man had cocaine-related arrests</p>
<p>from back in 88,</p>
<p>but they wanted to corroborate</p>
<p>this man&rsquo;s statement beyond that.</p>
<p>We ultimately take a trip down to Jasper, Alabama</p>
<p>to speak with that witness&rsquo;s girlfriend.</p>
<p>She does not recall that at all.</p>
<p>It ends up being that she has no memory of that.</p>
<p>When detectives interviewed him later,</p>
<p>the man recalled it being a nice sunny day outside</p>
<p>on November 29th, 1988 in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>But authorities knew that the weather</p>
<p>on the day of the murders</p>
<p>had actually been the exact opposite.</p>
<p>For investigators, little inaccuracies like that</p>
<p>made the witness less credible,</p>
<p>and they wondered if he had ulterior motives</p>
<p>for coming forward,</p>
<p>like maybe getting old charges amended</p>
<p>in exchange for info about Roger.</p>
<p>In the end, the lead ended up going nowhere.</p>
<p>Justin said that for his family,</p>
<p>ups and downs like this in the case have been really hard.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office had said multiple times</p>
<p>that it could be a matter of days if things go right.</p>
<p>If things don&rsquo;t go right,</p>
<p>it could be a matter of weeks or months.</p>
<p>And here we are 33 years later,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still no formal charges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been incredibly frustrating</p>
<p>because I do feel like we are incredibly close.</p>
<p>I mean, even in my investigation as a private citizen,</p>
<p>a invested private citizen at that,</p>
<p>but I believe I know who&rsquo;s responsible for their murders.</p>
<p>With regards to the investigation that I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I believe that I have a strong circumstantial case,</p>
<p>understanding the burden of proof and the charges,</p>
<p>the possible charges that this suspect group would face.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s any secret</p>
<p>that the Chabon County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>is waiting for at least one person to come forward</p>
<p>who has vital information.</p>
<p>And if you read the articles</p>
<p>about Eni and Fran within the newspaper,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty clear that there&rsquo;s at least one,</p>
<p>probably more people or more people</p>
<p>that have that pertinent knowledge</p>
<p>that could make it an open-and-shut case.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing Justin could say</p>
<p>to the person or group of people</p>
<p>responsible for killing his Aunt Frances and Uncle Eddie,</p>
<p>it would be this.</p>
<p>Put yourself in my shoes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s horrible to have to experience this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s even worse to not have resolution.</p>
<p>Eni and Fran were good people.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t deserve this.</p>
<p>If you can imagine losing family</p>
<p>in the horrendous way that we did,</p>
<p>if it was your loved one,</p>
<p>you would want somebody to come forward,</p>
<p>just do the right thing.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dassler said today</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working with state and federal authorities</p>
<p>to get all of Roger&rsquo;s old friends in</p>
<p>to take new polygraph tests.</p>
<p>Without fingerprints or foreign DNA at the scene,</p>
<p>the key to solving the case is gonna be information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been kept under wraps for decades.</p>
<p>Justin said that his family&rsquo;s even supportive</p>
<p>of one suspect getting an immunity deal</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what helps close the case.</p>
<p>I feel like if one person gets immunity</p>
<p>but still goes on the record and states what happened</p>
<p>and it gets a conviction on everybody else who&rsquo;s culpable,</p>
<p>while that wouldn&rsquo;t be the best result,</p>
<p>it would still be justice for Eni and Fran.</p>
<p>I mean, unfortunately now,</p>
<p>people who are responsible for a murder</p>
<p>have been, double murder, have been walking free,</p>
<p>walking the streets for 33 years.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s absolute travesty</p>
<p>that these people have been part of society</p>
<p>and walking the streets</p>
<p>after committing a heinous double murder.</p>
<p>So I think the best possible option,</p>
<p>which would have been a swift arrest and conviction,</p>
<p>is out the door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hoping that at some point,</p>
<p>we are able to have charges</p>
<p>and that these people who committed this horrible,</p>
<p>unspeakable act of violence are brought to justice.</p>
<p>Eni and Francis Czajauskas were living honest, quiet lives</p>
<p>when somebody stole their futures from them.</p>
<p>They were in their 70s and healthy for their ages.</p>
<p>They might&rsquo;ve enjoyed a nice, long retirement</p>
<p>but never got the chance.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the 1988 Czajauskas double murder</p>
<p>in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, come forward.</p>
<p>It could be the missing piece that&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>to give their families delayed justice.</p>
