<p>﻿good morning doc you with us us
good morning doctor bird</p>
<p>can you hear me I sure can -
right so welcome everyone we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here in I&rsquo;m here to answer your
questions anything that I say is</p>
<p>not meant to diagnose</p>
<p>you or provide provide</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>very kind of just went all right
let me just let me just kind of</p>
<p>cover what I would recommend now
realize that anytime someone</p>
<p>goes through any types of
surgery the adrenal gland reacts</p>
<p>with high levels of adrenal
hormones and adrenaline and</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>so even though your mother just
one under anesthetics the</p>
<p>adrenal glands</p>
<p>still kicked in and this is why
after surgery you could actually</p>
<p>experience a lot of side effects
and</p>
<p>problems like that so I think
the best thing that I would do I</p>
<p>would recommend</p>
<p>is to apply the adrenal
protocols that I recommend like</p>
<p>even watch the video that I did
on</p>
<p>on recovery after surgery she&rsquo;s
going to need a lot of B</p>
<p>vitamins she&rsquo;s going to need to
do maybe some adrenal protocols</p>
<p>I would watch the video</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>on adrenal stress webinar so
check that out and apply the</p>
<p>information but I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing you can do
because I think what happened is</p>
<p>just the she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s elderly and</p>
<p>then she&rsquo;s just trying to
recover from this this adrenal</p>
<p>shock to the system so I just
created a video just on this one</p>
<p>point so watch that and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need to do do</p>
<p>thanks for your call yeah thank
you you&rsquo;re welcome mmm all right</p>
<p>so Maria is on the call she&rsquo;s
from Connecticut are you there</p>
<p>Marie</p>
<p>hi Marina dr. Burke Hi how are
you</p>
<p>good how are you I have a
question I&rsquo;m good I have a</p>
<p>question regarding my
eight-year-old son he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>mucusy he&rsquo;s been that way
probably for about</p>
<p>eight years you had recommended
before that I trial and toe</p>
<p>kindness I did do that I didn&rsquo;t
see and I just</p>
<p>want to know should I just keep
doing it can I mix it with water</p>
<p>I tried to do the Neti Pot</p>
<p>with it not so good and then my
second question is I</p>
<p>a person doesn&rsquo;t have a uterus
that&rsquo;s cute o still work because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of belly fat</p>
<p>but the person doesn&rsquo;t have a a
uterus well you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing the uterus I always
recommend when I was in practice</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really great remedy
you can find it online it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>standard process is called
eutrophication just</p>
<p>tends to support women after
they had a hysterectomy and</p>
<p>also you want to support the
ovaries as well with just I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on healthy Quito and I&rsquo;m
going too fast and you may need</p>
<p>to fast longer and you</p>
<p>may need to take something
called an acetal</p>
<p>acetal inositol helps to
regulate the hormones from the</p>
<p>pituitary gland</p>
<p>follicle stimulating hormone and
luteinizing hormone so that may</p>
<p>help women that are missing
either ovaries or the uterus</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just kind of
throws off the whole hormonal</p>
<p>pathway and then as far as your
son goes I think I missed the</p>
<p>first part of the question I
know he is</p>
<p>sinus problems and you&rsquo;re trying
to give him a neti pot or can</p>
<p>you re ask that again</p>
<p>sure so one of your topics you
had set to trial and toe sinus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little powder so I
have been trying that</p>
<p>and he still very mucusy and
with this current age were going</p>
<p>through his school system</p>
<p>is very hyper sensitive so I
tried doing that I&rsquo;ve also tried</p>
<p>the Neti Pot</p>
<p>with just a saline solution but
nothing seems to help he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>tested for allergies which they
say he does not have and she</p>
<p>just always sounds like he has a</p>
<p>hole</p>
<p>this do you how is this diet is
he consuming any sugar of any</p>
<p>kind yeah yeah is he consuming
any dairy just cheese we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink milk or yogurt it&rsquo;s you I
would def because what happens</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a usually the could
be like a fungus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing on the sinuses
creating this constant mucus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s and they lives on sugar I
would reply with start doing</p>
<p>some Quito replacement</p>
<p>treats with Xylitol because not
at all</p>
<p>is a sugar substitute that
actually helps your sinuses by</p>
<p>the way that&rsquo;s one thing I would
do for sure</p>
<p>and then have them not consume
cheese right now because the</p>
<p>milk and their can actually
provide can stimulate more mucus</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the sugar in the
cheese</p>
<p>and I think that will really
really help help him okay thank</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re welcome all right
Deborah is from Hawaii</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s calling in are you
there Debbie I am here</p>
<p>good morning good morning
morning</p>
<p>so I had a couple of questions
the first one was I make my own</p>
<p>Jun and sometimes kombucha and I
know in one of your videos you</p>
<p>said make sure to check the
label to see how many carbs are</p>
<p>in there and I&rsquo;m like well how
do I know that it&rsquo;s ready</p>
<p>specially after the second
ferment when I add fruit juices</p>
<p>how do I know that they&rsquo;ve eaten
everything up and and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>having too many carbs and</p>
<p>yeah the second question is
about can you talk about people</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>who start with</p>
<p>Quito but have always had
problems with low weight and</p>
<p>anyways those are questions good
question</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a taste
test you just going to taste it</p>
<p>because as you</p>
<p>leave it ferment longer and
longer it becomes more or less</p>
<p>sweet more bitter and more more
carbonated so the kombucha that</p>
<p>has very low sugars like to
grams it&rsquo;s very carbonated it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as sweet</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to just going to
test it along the way and just</p>
<p>determine when to stop Brewing
it or you know with that</p>
<p>too little scobie yeast fungus
thing that actually helps you</p>
<p>make it and the next question is
as far as weight goes</p>
<p>you know the benefits of Quito
and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>are go Way Beyond just losing
weight so so what I do if you</p>
<p>want to just</p>
<p>your weight just keep your fats
on the high side</p>
<p>maybe not do one meal a day
maybe due to militate make sure</p>
<p>your calories are high</p>
<p>maintain exercise and then if
you</p>
<p>in a play around with your carbs
because you</p>
<p>maybe you go up to like maybe 40
or 50 grams of carbs in the form</p>
<p>of berries</p>
<p>that may help you maintain your
weight okay good because I</p>
<p>always lose weight when I go</p>
<p>on a diet so I&rsquo;m kind of and I
start yeah and I&rsquo;m losing weight</p>
<p>again I know I know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s
it&rsquo;s the other thing you could</p>
<p>do is add some</p>
<p>MCT oil through the day because
we want to we just we want to</p>
<p>get those ketones</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to have to just
do various things to avoid you</p>
<p>tapping into your own fat
Reserves because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>holding a lot of it so it&rsquo;s
really just kind of</p>
<p>of keep your carbs bit higher
but not too much and then keep</p>
<p>the fat High make sure the
calories are high as well okay</p>
<p>thank you so very much you&rsquo;re
welcome hey hey Steve yes I</p>
<p>have some interesting questions
for me well I do and also I want</p>
<p>you to say hello to the world
dr. Berg because they are</p>
<p>calling in from everywhere as
usual Quebec Algeria Martinique</p>
<p>Spain Sweden</p>
<p>France turkey Saudi Arabia
Jordan Finland Australia UK</p>
<p>India Ethiopia has Mania of all
places Philippines and</p>
<p>all across the</p>
<p>the u.s. and Canada of course
and I could go on but why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we get to some questions wow
yeah so it&rsquo;s credible people</p>
<p>want to you know get healthy
field grade and lose weight in</p>
<p>whatever order that should be so
they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>interested in that&rsquo;s Craig
getting some great great playoff</p>
<p>your wonderful programs and
let&rsquo;s see so let&rsquo;s see from New</p>
<p>York wants to know</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s B12 is very low
perhaps they had a tested and</p>
<p>very anxious</p>
<p>wants to know what&rsquo;s the sort of</p>
<p>you know play between B vitamins
and</p>
<p>anxiety and how they can manage
that that&rsquo;s one of the symptoms</p>
<p>of a B vitamin deficiency
usually it&rsquo;s be one but it could</p>
<p>be B12 B12 has more to do with a
lot of the neurological issues</p>
<p>that are involved in</p>
<p>myelin sheath and even your red
blood cell production</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re low in B12 you
could have a whole series of</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>and even even severe pain in
your body neurological pain</p>
<p>so you never want to let
yourself go too far but be one</p>
<p>is the one that&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for the anxiety if you&rsquo;re
deficient and so that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that you want to take</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never would recommend taking
the</p>
<p>typical synthetic bees that are
out there just because it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>yes they do work to some degree
if you take high doses of them</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re made from lot of as
petroleum so why not get a</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>source and I&rsquo;ve done a lot of
videos on this nutritional yeast</p>
<p>is one of the best things it&rsquo;s
interesting Steve nutritional</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>actually depending on what
environment it is put in</p>
<p>depending on what the medium is
that you grow it on on</p>
<p>you can do various things so it
can live on glucose it can live</p>
<p>on fructose it can even live on
protein so it is highly adaptive</p>
<p>and a lot of times people make
it with certain minerals so then</p>
<p>it spikes the</p>
<p>minerals far as it can combines
the mineral in a way that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easily absorbed so when you&rsquo;re
taking your Tricia least you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not just getting B vitamins
you&rsquo;re getting the trace</p>
<p>minerals you&rsquo;re getting various</p>
<p>antioxidants you&rsquo;re getting
amino acids and you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>good nice range of</p>
<p>and B vitamins your</p>
<p>Stevi big know I got what I just
am a freak for it and I use it</p>
<p>not only for the benefits that
it gives in terms of mood and</p>
<p>health and so on but also it
just keeps me from breaking my</p>
<p>fast I nibble a couple of those</p>
<p>things ax issue them and it&rsquo;s
Apes my appetite and</p>
<p>as a result the viewers can see
that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m moderately now isn&rsquo;t
that great that&rsquo;s great let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give let&rsquo;s give everyone the
first quiz</p>
<p>all right okay so so</p>
<p>got in the first question
question that it hit it okay</p>
<p>okay what causes dark colored
urine now there&rsquo;s multiple</p>
<p>things but what</p>
<p>would be the most common reason
for dark darken colored urine so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit darker than it
should be it should be yellow</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not quite yellow what
what is the underlying cost to</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s see if you guys can</p>
<p>spot the answer to that</p>
<p>while we go to Jani from New
York who&rsquo;s been waiting</p>
<p>patiently are you there</p>
<p>yes thank you I my my question
here</p>
<p>my 10 year old granddaughter
just had a spinal surgery</p>
<p>in August its genetic for
curvature of the spine she</p>
<p>the surgery was well didn&rsquo;t went
well but now she is exact</p>
<p>experiencing spasms spasms from
the Doctor</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s an excellent doctor said
but has not ever seen this</p>
<p>before within two weeks</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to be going to a
neurologist to see why these</p>
<p>spasms</p>
<p>happening because as she walks
she falls and has a bit of a</p>
<p>plane was wondering there are
vegan and and do eat some</p>
<p>sugar but mostly vegan what food
can</p>
<p>I help with with her her eating
and you being a</p>
<p>Chiropractic Doctor too what
suggestion to helps</p>
<p>so when she had the surgery</p>
<p>what spinal level did they do
surgery on it was a was a lower</p>
<p>lumbar was it a Rasik what was</p>
<p>it it was for the back I mean
see if the pain is happening in</p>
<p>the back</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m a grandmother her mother
knows II don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know know I can tell you</p>
<p>exactly did the surgery for
scoliosis no it was genetic</p>
<p>curvature of the spine</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>was the curvature of the spine
in the lower part or the upper</p>
<p>part is mostly the upper part oh
was it like a</p>
<p>hunchback or was it a kind of an
s-curve she was getting</p>
<p>hunching she was hunching it was
getting more of her yeah okay</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real simple solution solution
I think that you&rsquo;ll be happy to</p>
<p>call because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even kyphosis that condition is
usually coming from a</p>
<p>originally from a vitamin D
deficiency vitamin D deficiency</p>
<p>softens the bones and messes
with the skeletal muscles and it</p>
<p>can create abnormal curvatures
of the spine either Hunchback</p>
<p>which is kyphosis or lordosis or
even scoliosis</p>
<p>so if you were to give her
vitamin D and they have</p>
<p>you know you can actually get in
the Sun but it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>right now but she needs vitamin
D and higher amounts I would</p>
<p>give her a ten thousand at least
10,000 IU&rsquo;s Maybe 20,000 I use</p>
<p>and that really helps the
muscles</p>
<p>that helps the absorption of
calcium in the muscle to not to</p>
<p>mention the electrolytes which
you can get from eating high</p>
<p>amounts of leafy greens But
realize</p>
<p>that Sugar depletes you of
electrolytes especially</p>
<p>potassium so that could be one
of the</p>
<p>problems vitamin E E is another
good thing for muscle but I get</p>
<p>the feeling that it&rsquo;s could be a
vitamin D issue</p>
<p>the last thing I would recommend
I&rsquo;ve done videos on this so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you have spasm on the right
right side of the spine in the</p>
<p>mid back like by that&rsquo;s called
the rhomboids the Sea of a spasm</p>
<p>on the right side a little trick
would be to</p>
<p>do some massage on the opposite</p>
<p>opposite side that will help -
and then the other thing too is</p>
<p>if any time a muscle</p>
<p>is tighter than it should be you
can stretch the opposing muscle</p>
<p>so even on</p>
<p>the back you can work on the
front part of the muscles on the</p>
<p>PEC muscles so there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve done
videos on this you can look them</p>
<p>up on muscle spasm there&rsquo;s
techniques and there&rsquo;s nutrition</p>
<p>so that okay okay wonderful
thank you so much</p>
<p>for well thank you okay</p>
<p>okay see you all right let&rsquo;s go
to Maddie oh wait before we go</p>
<p>to Maddie what do we have Steve
as the</p>
<p>answers to the question darker
urine okay well I tell you what</p>
<p>85% dehydration I even guessed
that 10% too much protein or</p>
<p>high carbs that&rsquo;s interesting in
five deficient in vitamin B</p>
<p>Okay so you know all of you guys
are right and it is true that</p>
<p>dehydration will definitely
cause that I mean probably you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>to be correct is probably most
of the time however the answer I</p>
<p>was looking for</p>
<p>is something a little different
normally what makes the urine</p>
<p>yellow is a pigment that is
coming from the byproduct of</p>
<p>something called</p>
<p>bilirubin which is the end
product of your body trying to</p>
<p>recycle</p>
<p>and break down red blood cells
so the red part is iron</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s separated from the heme
and then it goes to different</p>
<p>different colors so the first
color is going to turn into his</p>
<p>green and that&rsquo;s why your your
gallbladder</p>
<p>bile is green and then that
color then changed gets absorbed</p>
<p>and it turns yellow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why your urine is yellow
and then it gets oxidized in the</p>
<p>colon is brown and that&rsquo;s why
you&rsquo;re still has brown but if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem with</p>
<p>dark colored urine that usually
is because you&rsquo;re lacking</p>
<p>the the bilirubin that&rsquo;s should
be exiting and that</p>
<p>comes from</p>
<p>either a gallstone or a blockage
in the ducts or sludge in the</p>
<p>bile ducts which is a lack of
bile so so it tells me that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re your diet is not correct
and you probably should be</p>
<p>taking some purified bile salts
and then what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice is the you&rsquo;ll get
more flow from your liver to the</p>
<p>small intestine</p>
<p>and the dark colored urine
should actually clear up so this</p>
<p>is the same thing if you have a
pale colored stool it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Gray or you&rsquo;re getting jaundice
that&rsquo;s a blockage and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s backing up into the liver</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re turning yellow and
and one last sentence the</p>
<p>itchiness so those are the
symptoms that indicates that you</p>
<p>have some other vials Fletcher
gallstones</p>
<p>all right Steve how about a
question okay let&rsquo;s do it so</p>
<p>on Facebook this time we have
almond should someone who is</p>
<p>anemic be fasting interesting
question hmm well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>types of anemia your B12 and Amy
of iron anemia</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re anemic I think I
probably would first fix</p>
<p>that but but here&rsquo;s the Catch 22
there are certain conditions of</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>have in our autoimmune auto
immune to something</p>
<p>called the intrinsic factor this
little thing in your in your</p>
<p>intestine and your</p>
<p>stomach which could be causing
the inability to absorb B12 in</p>
<p>which case</p>
<p>Steve fasting would be very
beneficial to anything with auto</p>
<p>anything connected to autoimmune
including inflammatory</p>
<p>conditions so it really depends
on what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing that anemia</p>
<p>but you know what Steve I&rsquo;m
writing this down now because</p>
<p>because this is another
opportunity for me to create a</p>
<p>video on anemia and fasting I
like that oh and by the way way</p>
<p>yeah and if you&rsquo;re you know best
way to get your iron is the</p>
<p>animal products like either
liver or beef or</p>
<p>you can get it as a supplement
is like either</p>
<p>concentrated grass-fed beef
things like that now I will stay</p>
<p>I will throw out there</p>
<p>you guys are very helpful in
giving me ideas to do videos on</p>
<p>and I always want to ask</p>
<p>the question if you wouldn&rsquo;t
mind if you if you think of a</p>
<p>good good that I should do do a
presentation on type it in the</p>
<p>comments</p>
<p>within this presentation because
I&rsquo;m going to read all of them</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m done and I&rsquo;ll line up</p>
<p>some videos because I&rsquo;m always
curious what you guys want to</p>
<p>videos on so definitely type
that in the the comment section</p>
<p>all right Steve now you can give
me a question</p>
<p>all right here we go stand by
when we push my visit John to</p>
<p>screen all right this time it&rsquo;s
from Susan no I&rsquo;m sorry Susan</p>
<p>you stand by because we&rsquo;re going
to go back to YouTube</p>
<p>Amy wants to know what can I do
about my seizures seizures</p>
<p>yeah you too okay I did a video
on that I&rsquo;m going to release it</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>need to do something called let
me think if I remember the name</p>
<p>of it Kido</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s right the ketogenic
diet that&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>and and and especially fasting
together because</p>
<p>a certain parts of the brain
when it starts to short-circuit</p>
<p>and because going like this
Haywire</p>
<p>situation can be overridden fuel
Wise by by ketones</p>
<p>if you start doing the ketogenic
diet it&rsquo;s been known as the</p>
<p>therapy for epileptic</p>
<p>seizures and the other thing if
you want to take it to the next</p>
<p>level you can take the MCT oil</p>
<p>with that so MCT oil Kido and
intermittent fasting is the</p>
<p>absolute best thing to do for
seizures seizures</p>
<p>Steve I&rsquo;m going to take a
question from Maddie now Maddie</p>
<p>is from San Antonio Texas by the
Alamo you had a question about</p>
<p>your brother go ahead yeah thank
you for taking my call and good</p>
<p>morning yes this question is
actually for my brother he</p>
<p>is 15 years old and he&rsquo;s been
diagnosed by with</p>
<p>their my toe most cited I don&rsquo;t
know if I pronounced that</p>
<p>correctly and apparently</p>
<p>weeks in science CPK I don&rsquo;t
even know what is that but both</p>
<p>up and make</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s a what of you Superman
can you recommend for me to</p>
<p>bring because he lives in
another country and I want to</p>
<p>bring him something because I
think he&rsquo;s meeting some kind of</p>
<p>vitamin because he doesn&rsquo;t need
to eat beef and you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>joined get very swollen and he
doesn&rsquo;t work out he</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even move I got it well
there&rsquo;s two two reasons for that</p>
<p>chances are it&rsquo;s probably some
type of</p>
<p>autoimmune equation but the best
remedy would be the D3 k 2 the</p>
<p>vitamin D3 Theta divided by D 3
is</p>
<p>wonderful anti-inflammatory for
for joint problems as well</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m going to mention
healthy Quito and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a given he should be on
that no doubt but vitamin D is</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>is the go to for</p>
<p>inflammatory joint issues
there&rsquo;s a lot of other remedies</p>
<p>that you could take you know you
can take</p>
<p>milk thistle one another one
called calcium</p>
<p>hydroxide but but I think I&rsquo;m
not going to give you the I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to recommend all those
I would stick with D3</p>
<p>Quito and fasting okay</p>
<p>okay perfect thank you very much
you&rsquo;re welcome let&rsquo;s go to know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I just a quick</p>
<p>no go ahead housecleaning and
that&rsquo;s our just disclaimer</p>
<p>reminder do you want to hit us
with a dock</p>
<p>yeah just anything that I say
guys is not meant to diagnose</p>
<p>or replace your medical care
check with your doctor before</p>
<p>taking any of my recommendations
because number one we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a doctor-patient relationship
and number two I&rsquo;m just giving</p>
<p>my opinion opinion</p>
<p>okay thank you sir all right so
so Steve let&rsquo;s go with the next</p>
<p>question that I have for ever
this is the next Quiz all right</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re
on a Statin okay</p>
<p>for cholesterol and the question
is what nutrient do you need to</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>taking if you are are on a
statin for some reason you have</p>
<p>to take it there&rsquo;s a nutrient
that you need to take it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>very important what is that</p>
<p>nutrient you need to take</p>
<p>to offset interest the
complications of a a statin okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>and as you guys are chewing on
that question I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>right to</p>
<p>Greg from Southern California hi
Greg</p>
<p>are you there okay Steve can you</p>
<p>see if you can connect with with
Greg I sure will I tell you you</p>
<p>what in the meantime I let Susan
hanging while we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>get Greg back and Susan from
Facebook wants to know what</p>
<p>the best treatment for an
abscessed tooth might be</p>
<p>oh okay if you have an abscess
this</p>
<p>is kind of a catch 22 because
yes you want to take a regular</p>
<p>now but if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an infection or any of your
tooth and I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>really going to say I&rsquo;m an
expert in this but I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>say that many times the</p>
<p>tooth might be dead and
sometimes you have to clean up</p>
<p>that infection</p>
<p>that infection in that that too
can create massive massive</p>
<p>issues for you health wise
anything from stiffness in your</p>
<p>neck which is a</p>
<p>your body your immune system is
reacting to it to heart problems</p>
<p>too arthritis in the joints so
these apps is are a huge issue I</p>
<p>would go to a</p>
<p>holistic dentist</p>
<p>with it but there are that would
be what I would recommend do not</p>
<p>ignore it because it&rsquo;s amazing
how one infection can create a</p>
<p>massive issues do your entire
health</p>
<p>that is wavering okay and by the
way we have Greg standing by we</p>
<p>got him back up here so</p>
<p>stand by Greg go ahead hi dr.
Berg thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call can you hear me now sure
perfectly but</p>
<p>have ulis so so three weeks ago
I had</p>
<p>a poisoning and high fever
hundred and four I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>55 so you know that&rsquo;s not so
good about a week later I had a</p>
<p>really severe autoimmune
response I can barely walk</p>
<p>stiff joints joints</p>
<p>weakness lots of fatigue and so
my doctor put me on well I went</p>
<p>to emergency they thought maybe
I had Guillain-Barre syndrome</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>eliminated that but my doctor
put me on pregnant zone and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be having</p>
<p>much of an effect so I decided
to put myself on a in a fast and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 36 hours</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering how long until
I should start</p>
<p>start the ying an improvement
because I&rsquo;m you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>concerned not being able to walk
is kind of</p>
<p>a concern so yeah well Greg your</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very very smart to do
that because obviously something</p>
<p>in your that food poisoning</p>
<p>triggered an immune reaction
that&rsquo;s now potentially creating</p>
<p>antibodies with the immune
system so I would treat this as</p>
<p>a an immune problem more than
anything and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the exact right thing are
you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing fine with the
fasting maybe go a little bit</p>
<p>longer and then and then come
back</p>
<p>off of it with the healthy
version of Quito I would at the</p>
<p>same time this is very important
I would be taking no less than</p>
<p>40,000 not international units
of vitamin D3 every single day</p>
<p>simply because that&rsquo;s really
really important for the immune</p>
<p>system as well in addition to
that there&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>Natural things that I would do I
would be doing oohing zinc I</p>
<p>would be doing probably higher
amounts I would also be doing</p>
<p>probably depending on</p>
<p>its is it in your joints in the
lower extremity</p>
<p>my legs are weak I don&rsquo;t really
feel the joint issue as much as</p>
<p>I do in my hand my hands are so
stiff that I can barely grasp</p>
<p>things and I think part of it I
forgot to add the beginning</p>
<p>I the emergency room set that I
had a UTI which is so odd</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had one before so the
infection maybe is</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m having such a weird
weird autoimmune response</p>
<p>the I&rsquo;ve done with my anabolics
for the</p>
<p>urinary tract infection so okay
so okay then this is what</p>
<p>I would recommend definitely get
on a good probiotic you know and</p>
<p>I even recommend if someone
takes an antibiotic</p>
<p>take the probiotics at the same
time it&rsquo;s not going to be a</p>
<p>problem but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be okay help you
because as soon as you wipe out</p>
<p>those bacteria you wiping out
your immune system to which is</p>
<p>leaving you open wide open into</p>
<p>problems the other thing is I
think oregano</p>
<p>thyme clothes those are</p>
<p>I would get them in like these
little pearls supplements</p>
<p>because that can kind of like go
through the</p>
<p>body and help naturally clear
out things it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>natural antibiotic without the
side effects</p>
<p>but the zinc in vitamin D with
the fasting those three things</p>
<p>and just give it more time keep
your stress low that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be important do understand the
prednisone thing because that</p>
<p>comes with a package you know it
works short term but boy</p>
<p>it just it can be a problem
because every time you take it</p>
<p>again it doesn&rsquo;t work as well
and then your that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>with me with Poison Ivy and so I
walk about</p>
<p>three feet away from Poison Ivy
and I&rsquo;ll start getting it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird I don&rsquo;t even have to touch</p>
<p>it but that&rsquo;s um but I think
you&rsquo;re doing the right thing</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re doing now just
add those those those additional</p>
<p>things yes okay Steve and
talking to Great doctor about</p>
<p>the best so I should talk to my
doctor</p>
<p>about how long I can fast
because I&rsquo;ve done I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>afford a fast so I can you know
I can go another 24 hours you</p>
<p>know I would I would</p>
<p>I would I would ride the way it
can go faster go do it longer</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>fasting is your body right now
your immune system is becoming</p>
<p>stronger when you&rsquo;re fasting so
you&rsquo;re going to within 72 hours</p>
<p>you start developing</p>
<p>stem cells</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have before that help
to strengthen the immune system</p>
<p>and rebuild it so you know ride
the wave a little bit longer and</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll start to see</p>
<p>changes and then go back to a
healthy keto for a while and</p>
<p>then fast again keep doing that
that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were</p>
<p>you all right very good great
answer Dock and now how about an</p>
<p>answer to our question which is
What vitamin</p>
<p>nutrient is important for
someone on a Statin and 90% of</p>
<p>our audience from all over the
world said</p>
<p>vitamin D 5 claim that potassium
is the proper potion and then</p>
<p>another five percent said co Q
10</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised about</p>
<p>that okay so the answer is Coke
you to end</p>
<p>and co Q 10 is something that is
needed for supporting your</p>
<p>energy in your</p>
<p>muscles not just the skeletal
muscles but your heart muscle as</p>
<p>well now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing about statins
they block the enzyme that helps</p>
<p>you make cholesterol cholesterol
is needed for cell membranes to</p>
<p>make vitamin D</p>
<p>to make bile to</p>
<p>steroid hormone so it&rsquo;s really
really important so you start</p>
<p>blocking this and one of the big</p>
<p>huge symptoms</p>
<p>is problems with your muscles
inflammation muscles weak</p>
<p>muscles autoimmune immune to
your muscle cells I mean to like</p>
<p>muscular autoimmune issues
another problem would be</p>
<p>necrosis like</p>
<p>literally dying of muscle cells
so it&rsquo;s a lot of muscle issue</p>
<p>and it just so happens that Co
Q10 can greatly help</p>
<p>reduce those symptoms so that is
very very very important</p>
<p>because when you take statins
you also deplete your co Q 10 so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re left certainly give a
shout-out on YouTube for Irish</p>
<p>and Deborah</p>
<p>who answered that question may
be some on Facebook sorry folks</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to look over
there but Irish and Deborah were</p>
<p>correct with</p>
<p>Co Q 10 yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really
good for co Q 10 is really good</p>
<p>for heart heart issues gives you
energy for the heart</p>
<p>but definitely the statins which
you know how I feel about</p>
<p>sentence anyway but anyway</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m ready for a question if
you have one Steve or I can go</p>
<p>to the phone calls let&rsquo;s go to
seba on Facebook I want to know</p>
<p>the best way to treat tinnitus
that terrible</p>
<p>terrible ringing of tinnitus
Okay so I did two videos on this</p>
<p>I would recommend doing a</p>
<p>benfotiamine benfotiamine is a B
vitamin that is a fat-soluble it</p>
<p>helps</p>
<p>to penetrate the nerves
especially the ones that</p>
<p>are up in the brain and so part
of the cranial nerves so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would</p>
<p>do I have done several videos on
tonight as I would watch those</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>technique that you can do do
that</p>
<p>you know Works maybe 50% of the
time and then I give all the</p>
<p>recommendations to info to me
now would be my go-to</p>
<p>recommendation for that one
Steve wonderful how about the</p>
<p>phones okay so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk to Susan from Grants Pass
your question Susan</p>
<p>are you there yes I am can you
hear me okay great I do</p>
<p>hear you okay good morning I&rsquo;m a
postmenopausal</p>
<p>woman I aged 63 I&rsquo;ve been on
your Quito</p>
<p>diet for way of life or three
and a half years after about six</p>
<p>months on keto I noticed a lot
of wrinkles</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been wondering what to
do about that I recently came</p>
<p>across the</p>
<p>the idea that all of the silica
that I&rsquo;m no longer eating</p>
<p>because I loved whole wheat
bread and brown rice and all the</p>
<p>stuff that has silica in it and
I don&rsquo;t eat that anymore so I</p>
<p>started to take a syllabus</p>
<p>supplement I think that&rsquo;s going
to take six months or so</p>
<p>to see results but what do you
think about that you know I just</p>
<p>I did a video on silica and I&rsquo;ve
been researching it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic for the skin Integrity
of</p>
<p>this skin</p>
<p>skin and the tone of the skin
and the collagen part of the</p>
<p>skin so you are definitely on
the right track with that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing I would Implement and
you got to give it some time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s different
types of silica silica and</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s you know I
would probably I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily give you a brand
names but the ones that are more</p>
<p>bioavailable probably would be
better and sometimes</p>
<p>they come in a liquid but you
can do some research on that the</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>thing thing that I I will tell
you that sometimes when you do</p>
<p>Kido you&rsquo;re getting rid of fluid
from the body and but this</p>
<p>probably would be different than
you</p>
<p>but especially when you
initially do it you lose this</p>
<p>fluid retention and sometimes
you might show up more wrinkles</p>
<p>because your might look like
you&rsquo;re dehydrated but I think</p>
<p>the best way to do that is to
make sure you have enough salt</p>
<p>which is maybe one level
teaspoon a day throughout your</p>
<p>food and then drink a little bit
more fluid just</p>
<p>just to keep or fluids up a
little bit because it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>easy to just kind of like not do
salt sand water and an end up</p>
<p>kind of like looking a little
bit more wrinkles but and of</p>
<p>course I would look at the
stress level</p>
<p>cortisol try to keep that down
giving a little bit more sleep</p>
<p>make sure your you have all the
Amega 3 fatty acids for your</p>
<p>skin because your skin needs the
fats</p>
<p>the DHA which is very very
important and then I think um</p>
<p>that would</p>
<p>be something</p>
<p>something and then of course
change the fasting as well but</p>
<p>right yeah yeah another another
question you mentioned about</p>
<p>coffee this morning I do drink
hmm maybe more than what</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>recommended is that going to
give me more wrinkles well</p>
<p>coffee will do two things it
will deplete your potassium</p>
<p>which is all about hydration for
sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even kind of like a
caffeine caffeine induced</p>
<p>hypokalemia which is low
potassium from doing</p>
<p>coffee so if you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>maybe keep it at one per day and
then make sure you&rsquo;re taking not</p>
<p>just potassium but vitamin</p>
<p>B1 which is also another vitamin
that can be depleted from</p>
<p>when you do too much tea or
coffee that can be deplete your</p>
<p>be Wonderful Will dock until we
got three more questions why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you launch the next one
for audience okay all right the</p>
<p>next question is</p>
<p>what would be the best Trace
mineral for all</p>
<p>all sirs</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best Trace mineral
for ulcers okay anywhere in the</p>
<p>body all right so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go
right to Jeanette and I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>plugging through these questions
pretty nicely so we can have</p>
<p>more callers I want to just get
as many questions answers as</p>
<p>possible hey Jeanette are you
you there from from Somerville</p>
<p>you had a question about can
Quito get my mother off stands</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>high cholesterol right there&rsquo;s
years because you just</p>
<p>found out that she had high
cholesterol and so is there a</p>
<p>way to heal that</p>
<p>with Quito but also would be
Toby be dangerous for someone</p>
<p>who had high cholesterol you you
know that&rsquo;s a very important</p>
<p>question because I want everyone
to know that the majority of</p>
<p>people who do Kido reduce their
cholesterol</p>
<p>actually the</p>
<p>harmful type which is not just
LDL it&rsquo;s the type of LDL called</p>
<p>small dense small dense
particles which can go invade</p>
<p>the inside the lining of your
your arteries but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that you need to now</p>
<p>carbohydrates in excess
especially I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>sugars and refined carbs</p>
<p>have to go somewhere in the body
so they&rsquo;re converted to certain</p>
<p>fats as well as cholesterol</p>
<p>and triglycerides so it&rsquo;s the
carbs that she needs to pay</p>
<p>attention to not the fat so
that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s why Quito is</p>
<p>low carb and it&rsquo;ll help your
cholesterol it&rsquo;ll help your</p>
<p>profiles that will support your
heart</p>
<p>also everyone should know that
your fat cells</p>
<p>are a storage for cholesterol so
as you get into Quito</p>
<p>keto and you start mobilizing</p>
<p>using your fat and you release
of triglycerides for energy</p>
<p>and you will also release the
cholesterol so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>sometimes it might go up
temporarily because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting rid o of all the stored
cholesterol that you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>also the one of the main main
Regulators for cholesterol is</p>
<p>bile salts so if your
gallbladder is not working that</p>
<p>well your cholesterol might be a
little bit high from that alone</p>
<p>so taking more some purify bath
salts can help</p>
<p>greatly eat kind of keep your
cholesterol in check</p>
<p>the question great thank you
very much you&rsquo;re welcome all</p>
<p>right doc</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already got some results
in here on your last question</p>
<p>which is what Trace mineral is
beneficial for ulcers 95% of our</p>
<p>worldwide viewers said zinc 5%
of folic acid and iron and I</p>
<p>think maybe a sprinkling of
potassium what say you doctor</p>
<p>the the answer is zinc you guys
are correct</p>
<p>very well done think you know if
you&rsquo;re deficient in zinc you get</p>
<p>poor wound healing</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t he and deficiency of
zinc will cause not just ulcers</p>
<p>in certain places in the body
even even if you have</p>
<p>also seen your in your rectum as</p>
<p>as ulcerative colitis or in your
duodenum or your stomach and</p>
<p>even if you have gastritis which
is inflammation stomach zinc is</p>
<p>really really important a good
remedy would be a type of zinc</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>zinc carnosine so that&rsquo;s another
that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>version that could be very
helpful you know I might say</p>
<p>speaking of zinc and vitamin D
now</p>
<p>of the health recommendations
for covid-19 heavily</p>
<p>lean and vitamin D and I might
mention that dr. Byrd mentioned</p>
<p>that six months ago long before
it was on the</p>
<p>you know the ether so a good for
you I know that&rsquo;s not a cure to</p>
<p>coming from dr. Berg but what a
great observation and how early</p>
<p>it came from our show versus of
the world&rsquo;s health organizations</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t get me started Steve
on that topic okay</p>
<p>oh my gosh okay good so so Steve
I</p>
<p>I do have um two more very
interesting questions but I want</p>
<p>to take a call first okay</p>
<p>go for it let&rsquo;s go to Nadia from</p>
<p>from Lexington</p>
<p>are you there a lot Nadia yes
I&rsquo;m here hi dr. Burke how are</p>
<p>you doing great thanks yes I
have actually two questions the</p>
<p>first one is I&rsquo;ve been on keto
for since August and I am</p>
<p>diabetic type</p>
<p>to I&rsquo;ve been on insulin and she
other medications so right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a great result I&rsquo;m off
insulin for sure such a short</p>
<p>period of time</p>
<p>time yeah and I&rsquo;m so happy about
so but the thing is I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had cholesterol</p>
<p>issues before or triglycerides I
understand I&rsquo;ve watched your</p>
<p>videos about</p>
<p>cholesterol so</p>
<p>my cholesterol is a little bit
high right now my concern is my</p>
<p>triglycerides are extremely high
I&rsquo;ve never had this</p>
<p>issue before as well and and my
second question is</p>
<p>is when I started Taquito I
noticed that I lost about ten</p>
<p>pounds and mainly that water or
water retention or anything</p>
<p>but right now I gained I gained
about six pounds six more</p>
<p>pounds and I didn&rsquo;t change
anything on the diet and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting as well
interesting interesting</p>
<p>interesting I</p>
<p>think what I would do if I were
you I think you need some gall</p>
<p>bladder support bile salts</p>
<p>salts</p>
<p>and the reason for that is that
will help your your mobilization</p>
<p>of the cholesterol triglycerides
and other fats through the liver</p>
<p>and out through the gallbladder
little bit better and I think it</p>
<p>will also help your weight loss
as well because I think the</p>
<p>liver needs a little bit of
support but you did give me you</p>
<p>inspired me to give you I mean
to create a video on this as</p>
<p>well and of course if they had
more time I would dig into other</p>
<p>reasons for why you would gain
weight I think you know</p>
<p>I think it could be either water
retention or it could be stress</p>
<p>or sleep or something else
because typically what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing you&rsquo;re not going to start
gaining fat if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>Quito and intermittent fasting
it&rsquo;s just not going to happen so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other reason</p>
<p>and I have seen though kind of
like a liver issue that needs</p>
<p>more people need more bile and
so that&rsquo;s what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you any suggestions about
bile</p>
<p>which which bile I should take</p>
<p>because on that you guys have it
has gelatin and we don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>gelatin then what you can
actually</p>
<p>just go to the health food store
and get a purified bile salts</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>gelatin you can try that but you
need</p>
<p>purified bile salts so just find
one that has has good reviews</p>
<p>and you can check</p>
<p>that out now I&rsquo;m sure okay how
about we move on to our next</p>
<p>question batter up for the next</p>
<p>question doc yep okay so when
some people take</p>
<p>antibiotics specifically Cipro
and other types of</p>
<p>antibiotics one of the main side
effects it&rsquo;s not I mean</p>
<p>majorly common but it isn&rsquo;t side
effect is tendon rupture</p>
<p>rupture your ruptures Okay so
why why would it rupture What</p>
<p>would that</p>
<p>antibiotic do that could cause a
ruptured tendon</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see what we got with
that one okay Steve looking</p>
<p>sounds great and if I could go
to</p>
<p>Maria real quick on YouTube and
Maria I&rsquo;m not teasing you</p>
<p>because this comes up so long</p>
<p>but dr. Berg will explain</p>
<p>the Folly of your question so
for now how long should I stay</p>
<p>on keto and of course the answer
is as long as you want to enjoy</p>
<p>life and have fun fun and</p>
<p>it means slamming donuts and
feeling absolutely ghastly so I</p>
<p>think we know the answer but doc
why don&rsquo;t you expand on that</p>
<p>yeah how long should you kiddo
well just until you hit the</p>
<p>weight weight loss goal then you
can go back to your normal foods</p>
<p>and regular Foods now you don&rsquo;t
want to do that Quito is I think</p>
<p>this is my opinion and I think
speaking for a whole lot of</p>
<p>people who have been on this but
I mean</p>
<p>come on it&rsquo;s like these crates
so many positive benefits</p>
<p>it is it is the the eating plan
that we&rsquo;re kind of designed to</p>
<p>consume because you do so well
on it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any other
program that even comes close to</p>
<p>the combination of the healthy
version of Quito and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting it handles
so many issues why would you</p>
<p>want to go on to anything else
now there&rsquo;s some naysayers Steve</p>
<p>that will say Well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the studies we haven&rsquo;t done this
long term so in other words all</p>
<p>these great benefits that you
get</p>
<p>that are only short term but if
you&rsquo;re on the diet</p>
<p>long-term you need to go back</p>
<p>the whatever diet you need to be
on I mean like that is</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s something works
in the old short term tons of</p>
<p>sugar so we don&rsquo;t have I know so
take a couple of cups of sugar</p>
<p>and and listen once again the
reason that I don&rsquo;t call it a</p>
<p>diet it&rsquo;s a absolute lifestyle
is because the weight is</p>
<p>secondary to my mental health I
do I don&rsquo;t know how many other</p>
<p>people are like that but I do
terribly on high carbs and sugar</p>
<p>I feel Gastly and when I&rsquo;m in
the middle of it I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>realize I&rsquo;m in in that place and
once as I get back</p>
<p>lower the carbs intermittent
fasting works for me as well the</p>
<p>nothing tastes as good as a good
keto diet feels</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t call it a diet I
mean you just feel better all</p>
<p>around and so for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not well I don&rsquo;t want to
return to having an extra 20</p>
<p>pounds on me I don&rsquo;t want to
return to and by the way let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Diane reminded me Quito is</p>
<p>not a diet thank you Diane
you&rsquo;re absolutely right it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lifestyle and I don&rsquo;t want to go
back to</p>
<p>misery life is great on this
plan so you can&rsquo;t peel me off at</p>
<p>do I have a mistake you know do
I have a slip every once in a</p>
<p>while yes I do but I&rsquo;m quickly
reminded of why that&rsquo;s a rotten</p>
<p>way to live</p>
<p>yeah to go the goal of Quito is
to get your body into the state</p>
<p>of health where you you&rsquo;re in a
power state so you have the so</p>
<p>much health Reserve that you
have the flexibility to if you</p>
<p>need if you want to go off
occasionally like I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to make it sound like you like
you have this strict thing in</p>
<p>your like you have to like
completely and utterly</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>always do this but the point</p>
<p>is that get yourself into a
place where you can you have a</p>
<p>lot of flexibility so let&rsquo;s say
you do go off</p>
<p>and you you&rsquo;re going to have
problems with it but you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>with it because you know what to
do to get it back and again</p>
<p>personally I don&rsquo;t do that very
often because I just like to the</p>
<p>way I feel when I do it I&rsquo;m
pretty disciplined simply</p>
<p>because I was so sick in the
past that I&rsquo;m like you know what</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to go that
direction</p>
<p>I like this and I can stick with
it I do know that there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these social things going on on
and yeah have to enjoy life with</p>
<p>all these cars but I prefer</p>
<p>not to do that but like to give
you guys the flexibility at some</p>
<p>point okay Steve we&rsquo;re back and
we got some ice ice</p>
<p>Ok good what do we got okay so
why do some people experience</p>
<p>tendon ruptures with certain
antibiotics like</p>
<p>see Pro Cipro and 70% sounds
like somebody looked this up I</p>
<p>have no idea collagen</p>
<p>synthesis 30% said Ciprofloxacin
impacts the</p>
<p>the the tendons wow okay you
guys you did look it up I think</p>
<p>but yeah it does affect this</p>
<p>antibiotic and there&rsquo;s this
there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them</p>
<p>that do this and I will create a
video on this</p>
<p>Blocks Your small child your
small chain fatty</p>
<p>acid your amino acids the short
chain fatty acids amino</p>
<p>acids so at block certain amino
acids that make your attendance</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>Branch chain amino acids I&rsquo;m
trying to get around to saying</p>
<p>that I finally kicked out it out
now the reason why what&rsquo;s behind</p>
<p>that is very interesting it&rsquo;s a
it blocks vitamin</p>
<p>B12 and vitamin B1 is not all
about just about carbohydrate</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about amino acid
metabolism</p>
<p>as well so really it&rsquo;s the lack
of be one that then</p>
<p>then blocks ability to make
collagen and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>it ruptures it gets weak so so
if you&rsquo;re on see Pro or other</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>I would recommend taking be one
now what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>that Steve is</p>
<p>your microbes in your gut also
have the ability to make be one</p>
<p>and so you have an antibiotic
and you wipe out those microbes</p>
<p>guess what you&rsquo;re not going to
make the B</p>
<p>vitamins that well anymore so
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll show up is a</p>
<p>deficiency so</p>
<p>interesting so you have to take
more or of the right kind of B</p>
<p>vitamins and I like that&rsquo;s why
like nutritional yeast to be</p>
<p>able to prevent some of these
complications but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing worse than having a
ruptured tendon when you say</p>
<p>Steve absolutely yeah that&rsquo;s a
game you&rsquo;re killing Tenon</p>
<p>then you hobble around so we
don&rsquo;t want to do that only dock</p>
<p>with five minutes late you want
to hit him up with the last</p>
<p>question oh that&rsquo;s weird because
I have we have five minutes to</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>as mighty as my clock wrong no I
think I said five minutes or</p>
<p>five minutes left</p>
<p>so if I miss the okay good yeah
I&rsquo;m ready for another question</p>
<p>guys okay so you go on keto and
you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>your higher amounts of fat and
then you end up with the side</p>
<p>effect dizziness you get up and
you kind of feel dizzy and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like well what&rsquo;s going on
here</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there what do
you what do you need to do</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s the neck that&rsquo;s the
last question</p>
<p>Adriana you had a question here
from San Jose</p>
<p>go ahead with your question yes
I&rsquo;m 43</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a beef and I&rsquo;ve been dealing
with fibroids for the past 12</p>
<p>years and I started doing</p>
<p>the intermittent fasting the
healthy</p>
<p>Keitel and the is and I even
went organic and I even bought</p>
<p>the the</p>
<p>the sea kelp yeah he has
Reynolds stress d3k to</p>
<p>Adrenaline cortisol support
Esther Dan the sleep aid and the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder but I started</p>
<p>making these yeah and I started
not to feel well either</p>
<p>so is there something that I&rsquo;m
not taking the right way and you</p>
<p>know what I have in between</p>
<p>venue for the past two months
yeah okay so I think</p>
<p>I think the only ones I would
probably focus on right now of</p>
<p>course keep</p>
<p>in your Quito and I&rsquo;m going to
fasting maybe you cut it down a</p>
<p>bit it&rsquo;s quite a few</p>
<p>things were taking all at the
same time and you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s causing what but I
think probably the estrogen</p>
<p>balance and with Jim is
something I would take take that</p>
<p>right now and then what I would
do</p>
<p>is take that</p>
<p>that for one let&rsquo;s see how you
feel with your Quito and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to fasting and then the
next day add the seek help and</p>
<p>see how you feel because what we
want to do is going to isolate</p>
<p>what is it that&rsquo;s creating this
weird feeling</p>
<p>and you can you can use you
slowly add one more in there to</p>
<p>see what is it then you could
then you call back in 1 or 2</p>
<p>weeks and let me know what that
was and I can give</p>
<p>you more data but the other
thing that you want to do and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the right thing</p>
<p>is the fasting is going to</p>
<p>very very important important in
helping you shrink these things</p>
<p>the other thing too is when you
eat just make sure that you do</p>
<p>not consume Dairy right now
because that can create issues</p>
<p>and then the last thing</p>
<p>that was very important is to
look at this fibroid as a tumor</p>
<p>and one really good natural
thing to do is to prevent</p>
<p>the blood flow to the tumor you
want to take</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s an
anti-angiogenic anti-angiogenic</p>
<p>fact it&rsquo;s basically the
cruciferous vegetables will help</p>
<p>decrease the blood flow these
blood vessels that are feeding</p>
<p>this tumor</p>
<p>so so if you were to take make
sure and you&rsquo;re healthy version</p>
<p>like add more Cal add more
broccoli brussel sprouts</p>
<p>every single day that would be
real smart to do</p>
<p>okay and then my able to eat
organic Meats still even having</p>
<p>these are just wait on that yeah
you definitely want to do</p>
<p>organic meat because probably
you might get some anemia from</p>
<p>the bleeding so you want to do
organic everything you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do the hormones the
hormones in the these products</p>
<p>will stimulate issues so you
know maybe you try fish right</p>
<p>now fish might be a good protein
right now because</p>
<p>sometimes there might be some
growth hormones in the meat okay</p>
<p>and how many</p>
<p>we talked to I take a day maybe
you just avoid those in just two</p>
<p>salmon right now or some good
high quality wild caught fish</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>good question okay Don we have
got some answers for your final</p>
<p>quiz question today and the
question again is if you start</p>
<p>Quito and add more fat to the
diet yet feel dizzy when</p>
<p>standing of what nutrient might
be missing</p>
<p>ninety percent of our
respondents say electrolytes</p>
<p>five percent say salt and trace
minerals and about another five</p>
<p>percent say B 3 and b 2</p>
<p>2 Okay so all you guys are all
right on you&rsquo;re just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking with this</p>
<p>is very well done of course I
was looking for another answer</p>
<p>but no but you are correct and
I&rsquo;m going to do a video</p>
<p>on this to give you more of a
well-rounded thing but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing that</p>
<p>is important that I want to
mention when you excuse me do</p>
<p>Quito you&rsquo;re coming off
carbohydrates</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming moderate amount
of protein and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming a higher amount of fat
when you consume a higher</p>
<p>amounts of fat</p>
<p>realize that the fats that you
eat normally do not contain</p>
<p>contain the B vitamins there&rsquo;s
not a lot of B vitamins</p>
<p>especially be one in fat it&rsquo;s in
the protein but not that so</p>
<p>anytime you</p>
<p>consume anything and higher
amounts without the B vitamins</p>
<p>especially be one it&rsquo;s going to
take more be metabolize that</p>
<p>fuel that fat so you could
become slightly deficient and be</p>
<p>one if you go on a high fat diet
if you&rsquo;re not following my</p>
<p>recommendations which I always
tell people to it minimally do</p>
<p>electrolytes minerals and
nutritional yeast for your B</p>
<p>vitamins I always recommend that</p>
<p>Steve for for this reason our
ger the sole person on Facebook</p>
<p>that said be one so
congratulations Carter you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ahead of the pack wow so what
happens when you&rsquo;re low in be 1</p>
<p>and this is another thing</p>
<p>since we have a minute to talk
about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to mention it&rsquo;s
fascinating actually I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to do a video on this when
you&rsquo;re lacking be one which is</p>
<p>water soluble you can have all
sorts of problems with your</p>
<p>autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system and</p>
<p>and the part of the brain that&rsquo;s
real sensitive to be one is the</p>
<p>brain stem and in the brainstem
you have</p>
<p>a big part of your autonomic
nervous system specifically your</p>
<p>parasympathetic nervous system
where the vagus nerve comes out</p>
<p>so you can have problems with
digestion</p>
<p>lack of digestion gastroparesis
where it&rsquo;s not come it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>snow like you might have
constipation or slow digestive</p>
<p>system but also</p>
<p>when you stand up</p>
<p>your might get dizzy because the
autonomic nervous system is not</p>
<p>adapting so so you might you
might associate this with</p>
<p>adrenal issues from stress</p>
<p>but in reality it&rsquo;s an adrenal
issue for sure but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>coming from stress is coming
from a</p>
<p>B1 deficiency and your ability
to adapt from rising from</p>
<p>squatting to standing to lying
down the standing you just take</p>
<p>be one that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just want to put that out
there there is another the</p>
<p>reason to take the B vitamins
and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that are
connected to be one I will be</p>
<p>doing some videos next week on
this so so on that note I want</p>
<p>to thank</p>
<p>everyone for your wonderful
questions and please two things</p>
<p>number one right down some ideas
for me on a future</p>
<p>video because I&rsquo;m always looking
for ideas and I&rsquo;d like to get it</p>
<p>from things that you guys tell
me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in number
one</p>
<p>and then secondly we now have
some really good Quito trained</p>
<p>Consultants that are ready to</p>
<p>take calls for various questions
you know let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting on keto and you need to
get</p>
<p>some advice and we can send you
the like a PDF form of my</p>
<p>my eating plan if you want or if
you&rsquo;re on keto and you it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going that well and you have
