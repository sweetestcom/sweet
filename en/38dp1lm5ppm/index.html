Burke here listen in this video I&amp;rsquo;m gonna discuss how to dissolve kidney stones but I want to make a disclaimer first make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re discussing it for this information any changes with your doctor because this is not meant for a replacement for any meds or any surgery that they&amp;rsquo;re gonna do any okay so I just wanted to present this as extra information to work with he or she in helping to you know prevent this from coming back or helping slow down stones sometimes it takes several months to dissolve stones and if you can prevent an invasive procedure I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to try this you can always go back and get your ultrasound and see if the stones are shrinking but here&amp;rsquo;s here&amp;rsquo;s the data most kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones or calcium phosphate stones twenty percent or a little less than twenty percent of the stones are uric acid crystal stones okay so there&amp;rsquo;s two different there&amp;rsquo;s several but these are the main two now golf stones are completely different than kidney stones as far as the formation gall stones are more cholesterol stones because of lack of bile kidney stones if we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the most common are calcium oxalate stones okay so there&amp;rsquo;s there&amp;rsquo;s really two things that you need to put your attention on one is removing the oxalates from your diet this is like a waste product from metabolism but oxalates bind with calcium in the kidney okay and they develop these little crystals that then can create a lot of problems they can get lodged right on the kidney right before the ureter and cause a backup of fluid and pressure and cause a lot of pain the symptoms from kidney stones are very similar to the symptoms from gull stones so sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is causing what because they&amp;rsquo;re very very similar but you can get an ultrasound or a cat scan to find that out all right so the underlying mechanism is that usually the person is low in citrates and high in oxalates now citrates actually help prevent the formation of stones and help dissolve stones so the two mechanisms that you want to focus our increasing sit rates in the diet decreasing oxalates all right so let&amp;rsquo;s go through step one number one you want to increase sit rates there are many types of lemon juice that you can consume I like the volcano lemon juice you can even get lemon juice any lemon juice and it will work but I would like to recommend that you get a higher quality lemon juice because it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more nutritious volcano is the best but you can just get organic lemon juice but lemon juice has a lot of citrates anything any mineral with citrate at the end of it is a citrate so you can do potassium citrate which I like that one way better than sodium citrate but potassium citrate will break off so a good portion of the potassium will go this way the citrate will go that way and it starts to form with the calcium and help break up the stones so that will handle the citrate number two you want to avoid oxalates now I put a link down below of all the different categories of foods and what has high extremely high oxalates and what are very low and you can use that but spinach is the top of the list spinach has hundreds of milligrams of oxalates per ounces of spinach and then we also have avocado is high dates are high grapefruit is high potato wheat beans beets are very high Swiss chard is very high Kiwi canned pineapple is very high figs and tofu are very high in oxalates okay nuts unfortunately very high almonds are very very high I&amp;rsquo;m sorry did you realize that kale is very low in oxalates even though it&amp;rsquo;s a cruciferous it has like seven teen milligrams per three ounces spinach is hundreds okay cabbage is low in oxalates bok choy is low cauliflower is low cucumber is low so take the list down below dissect it make notes and what you&amp;rsquo;re going to you know do if as far as you&amp;rsquo;re changing your diet now the point I want to make is this it is true and some of the other videos I talked about calcium coming out of solution into the different soft tissues when your body is too alkaline okay so when you have alkalosis calcium participates or it precipitates out of the solution and starts clogging up joints and things that&amp;rsquo;s true but if you take dietary calcium like some cheese and things like that that will not end up in the calcium through the kidneys in fact some of that calcium through the digestive system will bind with the oxalates and lower the chance of getting a stone the thing you need to worry about is taking dietary extra calcium like supplements like calcium in a supplement form especially calcium carbonate you want to avoid that so just make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not taking these supplements with calcium but you can take some dietary foods that are higher in calcium okay the other point I want to make is there&amp;rsquo;s a confusion with vitamin D there&amp;rsquo;s mixed reviews a lot of the recent research says that vitamin D actually helps lower stones some of the older research says it will increase it but here&amp;rsquo;s my viewpoint vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium in the intestines by 20 times that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean it ends up in the kidney okay so I think it&amp;rsquo;s okay vitamin k2 is another vitamin that&amp;rsquo;s very important if you have kidney stones because that helps you hold calcium in the bone that helps you remove calcium from soft tissues and puts it in the bone where it should be so this is a very good anti kidney stone vitamin there&amp;rsquo;s also mixed reviews and vitamin C or ascorbic acid you know synthetic like large amounts of the scorebook acid some studies show that it increases some studies do not so I am I don&amp;rsquo;t have an opinion about it and see I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what it does some people think that cranberry helps dissolve kidney stones it does not all cranberry will do will help lessen the stickiness of the bacteria on your ladder okay now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about uric acid crystals now that particular type of stone usually comes when your pH is too acid your urine pH is too acid and that could happen after several things number one you need a ketosis diet and all of a sudden you upload a kidney stone or you have an insulin problem a lot of diabetics have kidney stones because of the sugar involved because sugar fructose that kind of can lead to uric acid building up in the body so if you have more of the uric acid stones what you want to do is increase the pH and you can do that or alkalis the by a little bit more by taking the potassium citrate or even lemon juice because both of these are alkaline even though the lemon juice is a an acid it turns into an alkaline ash in the body so actually these two remedies will be good for both of these the I last point on the mention that&amp;rsquo;s very very important is that if you have a uric acid crystals in the kidney they&amp;rsquo;re little stones or gout you need to fix the insulin you need to lower the insulin okay because it usually comes from insulin resistance I&amp;rsquo;m gonna put a link down below to give you the data I just wanted the more of a comprehensive video because I have a lot of different videos talking about different aspects but this is a real comprehensive video just to give you the overview of what to do if you had a kidney stone alright thanks for watching'>

<p>﻿hey guys dr. Burke here listen in this video I&rsquo;m 
gonna discuss how to dissolve kidney stones but I  </p>
<p>want to make a disclaimer first make sure that 
you&rsquo;re discussing it for this information any  </p>
<p>changes with your doctor because this is not meant 
for a replacement for any meds or any surgery that  </p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna do any okay so I just wanted to 
present this as extra information to work with  </p>
<p>he or she in helping to you know prevent this from 
coming back or helping slow down stones sometimes  </p>
<p>it takes several months to dissolve stones and 
if you can prevent an invasive procedure I think  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth it to try this you can always go 
back and get your ultrasound and see if the  </p>
<p>stones are shrinking but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the data 
most kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones  </p>
<p>or calcium phosphate stones twenty percent or 
a little less than twenty percent of the stones  </p>
<p>are uric acid crystal stones okay so there&rsquo;s two 
different there&rsquo;s several but these are the main  </p>
<p>two now golf stones are completely different than 
kidney stones as far as the formation gall stones  </p>
<p>are more cholesterol stones because of lack of 
bile kidney stones if we&rsquo;re going to talk about  </p>
<p>the most common are calcium oxalate stones okay so 
there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s really two things that you need to  </p>
<p>put your attention on one is removing the oxalates 
from your diet this is like a waste product from  </p>
<p>metabolism but oxalates bind with calcium in the 
kidney okay and they develop these little crystals  </p>
<p>that then can create a lot of problems they can 
get lodged right on the kidney right before the  </p>
<p>ureter and cause a backup of fluid and pressure 
and cause a lot of pain the symptoms from kidney  </p>
<p>stones are very similar to the symptoms from gull 
stones so sometimes you don&rsquo;t know what is causing  </p>
<p>what because they&rsquo;re very very similar but you 
can get an ultrasound or a cat scan to find that  </p>
<p>out all right so the underlying mechanism is that 
usually the person is low in citrates and high  </p>
<p>in oxalates now citrates actually help prevent 
the formation of stones and help dissolve stones  </p>
<p>so the two mechanisms that you want to focus 
our increasing sit rates in the diet decreasing  </p>
<p>oxalates all right so let&rsquo;s go through step one 
number one you want to increase sit rates there  </p>
<p>are many types of lemon juice that you can 
consume I like the volcano lemon juice you  </p>
<p>can even get lemon juice any lemon juice and it 
will work but I would like to recommend that you  </p>
<p>get a higher quality lemon juice because it&rsquo;s 
a lot more nutritious volcano is the best but  </p>
<p>you can just get organic lemon juice but lemon 
juice has a lot of citrates anything any mineral  </p>
<p>with citrate at the end of it is a citrate so 
you can do potassium citrate which I like that  </p>
<p>one way better than sodium citrate but potassium 
citrate will break off so a good portion of the  </p>
<p>potassium will go this way the citrate will 
go that way and it starts to form with the  </p>
<p>calcium and help break up the stones so that will 
handle the citrate number two you want to avoid  </p>
<p>oxalates now I put a link down below of all the 
different categories of foods and what has high  </p>
<p>extremely high oxalates and what are very low 
and you can use that but spinach is the top of  </p>
<p>the list spinach has hundreds of milligrams of 
oxalates per ounces of spinach and then we also  </p>
<p>have avocado is high dates are high grapefruit 
is high potato wheat beans beets are very high  </p>
<p>Swiss chard is very high Kiwi canned pineapple is 
very high figs and tofu are very high in oxalates  </p>
<p>okay nuts unfortunately very high almonds are 
very very high I&rsquo;m sorry did you realize that  </p>
<p>kale is very low in oxalates even though it&rsquo;s a 
cruciferous it has like seven teen milligrams  </p>
<p>per three ounces spinach is hundreds okay cabbage 
is low in oxalates bok choy is low cauliflower is  </p>
<p>low cucumber is low so take the list down below 
dissect it make notes and what you&rsquo;re going to  </p>
<p>you know do if as far as you&rsquo;re changing your 
diet now the point I want to make is this it is  </p>
<p>true and some of the other videos I talked about 
calcium coming out of solution into the different  </p>
<p>soft tissues when your body is too alkaline okay 
so when you have alkalosis calcium participates or  </p>
<p>it precipitates out of the solution and starts 
clogging up joints and things that&rsquo;s true but  </p>
<p>if you take dietary calcium like some cheese 
and things like that that will not end up in  </p>
<p>the calcium through the kidneys in fact some of 
that calcium through the digestive system will  </p>
<p>bind with the oxalates and lower the chance of 
getting a stone the thing you need to worry about  </p>
<p>is taking dietary extra calcium like supplements 
like calcium in a supplement form especially  </p>
<p>calcium carbonate you want to avoid that so just 
make sure you&rsquo;re not taking these supplements  </p>
<p>with calcium but you can take some dietary foods 
that are higher in calcium okay the other point I  </p>
<p>want to make is there&rsquo;s a confusion with vitamin D 
there&rsquo;s mixed reviews a lot of the recent research  </p>
<p>says that vitamin D actually helps lower stones 
some of the older research says it will increase  </p>
<p>it but here&rsquo;s my viewpoint vitamin D helps the 
absorption of calcium in the intestines by 20  </p>
<p>times that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it ends up in 
the kidney okay so I think it&rsquo;s okay vitamin k2 is  </p>
<p>another vitamin that&rsquo;s very important if you have 
kidney stones because that helps you hold calcium  </p>
<p>in the bone that helps you remove calcium from 
soft tissues and puts it in the bone where it  </p>
<p>should be so this is a very good anti kidney stone 
vitamin there&rsquo;s also mixed reviews and vitamin C  </p>
<p>or ascorbic acid you know synthetic like large 
amounts of the scorebook acid some studies show  </p>
<p>that it increases some studies do not so I am I 
don&rsquo;t have an opinion about it and see I don&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>know exactly what it does some people think that 
cranberry helps dissolve kidney stones it does  </p>
<p>not all cranberry will do will help lessen the 
stickiness of the bacteria on your ladder okay  </p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s talk about uric acid crystals now that 
particular type of stone usually comes when your  </p>
<p>pH is too acid your urine pH is too acid and that 
could happen after several things number one you  </p>
<p>need a ketosis diet and all of a sudden you upload 
a kidney stone or you have an insulin problem a  </p>
<p>lot of diabetics have kidney stones because of the 
sugar involved because sugar fructose that kind of  </p>
<p>can lead to uric acid building up in the body so 
if you have more of the uric acid stones what you  </p>
<p>want to do is increase the pH and you can do that 
or alkalis the by a little bit more by taking the  </p>
<p>potassium citrate or even lemon juice because both 
of these are alkaline even though the lemon juice  </p>
<p>is a an acid it turns into an alkaline ash in the 
body so actually these two remedies will be good  </p>
<p>for both of these the I last point on the mention 
that&rsquo;s very very important is that if you have a  </p>
<p>uric acid crystals in the kidney they&rsquo;re little 
stones or gout you need to fix the insulin you  </p>
<p>need to lower the insulin okay because it usually 
comes from insulin resistance I&rsquo;m gonna put a link  </p>
<p>down below to give you the data I just wanted the 
more of a comprehensive video because I have a  </p>
<p>lot of different videos talking about different 
aspects but this is a real comprehensive video  </p>
<p>just to give you the overview of what to do if 
you had a kidney stone alright thanks for watching</p>
