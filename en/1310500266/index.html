    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>How would you, as a higher intelligence,</p>
<p>represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?</p>
<p>Do you think they saw what they say they saw?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t just start showing up in 1947.</p>
<p>How hard do you think it is for aliens</p>
<p>to communicate with humans?</p>
<p>What do we believe in?</p>
<p>We believe in technology.</p>
<p>So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?</p>
<p>But the common thread is you&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something else here with you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s, as you said, watching you.</p>
<p>You are a professor at Stanford</p>
<p>studying the biology of the human organism</p>
<p>at the level of individual cells.</p>
<p>So let me ask first the big,</p>
<p>ridiculous philosophical question.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect</p>
<p>of human biology at the level of the cell to you?</p>
<p>The micromachines and the nanomachines</p>
<p>that proteins make and become,</p>
<p>that to me is the most interesting.</p>
<p>The fact that you have this basically dynamic computer</p>
<p>within every cell that&rsquo;s constantly processing</p>
<p>its environment, and at the heart of it is DNA,</p>
<p>which is a dynamic machine, a dynamic computation process.</p>
<p>People think of the DNA as a linear code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s codes within codes within codes.</p>
<p>And it is actually the epigenetic state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing this amazing processing.</p>
<p>I mean, if you ever wanted to believe in God,</p>
<p>just look inside the cell.</p>
<p>So DNA is both information and computer.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How did that computer come about?</p>
<p>A big continuing on the philosophical question.</p>
<p>Is this both scientific and philosophical?</p>
<p>How did life originate on Earth, do you think?</p>
<p>How did this, at every level, so the very first step</p>
<p>and the fascinating complex computer that is DNA,</p>
<p>that is multicellular organism,</p>
<p>and then maybe the fascinating complex computer</p>
<p>that is the human mind?</p>
<p>Well, I think you have to take just one more step back</p>
<p>to the complex computer that is the universe, right?</p>
<p>All of the so called particles or the waves</p>
<p>that people think the universe is made of</p>
<p>and appears, to me at least, to be a computational process.</p>
<p>And embedded in that is biology, right?</p>
<p>So all the atoms of a protein, et cetera,</p>
<p>sit in that computational matrix.</p>
<p>From my point of view, it&rsquo;s computing something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s computing towards something.</p>
<p>It was created, in some ways, if you want to believe in God,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that I do,</p>
<p>but if you want to believe in something,</p>
<p>the universe was created or at least enabled</p>
<p>to allow for life to form.</p>
<p>And so the DNA, if you ask, where does DNA come from?</p>
<p>And you can go all the way back to Richard Dawkins</p>
<p>and the selfish gene hypothesis.</p>
<p>The way I look at DNA, though,</p>
<p>is it is not a moment in time.</p>
<p>It assumes the context of the body and the environment</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s going to live.</p>
<p>And so if you want to ask a question of where</p>
<p>and how does information get stored,</p>
<p>DNA, although it&rsquo;s only 3 billion base pairs long,</p>
<p>contains more information than, I think,</p>
<p>the entire computational memory resources</p>
<p>of our current technology.</p>
<p>Because who and what you are is both what you were as an egg</p>
<p>all the way through to the day you die,</p>
<p>and it embodies all the different cell types</p>
<p>and organs in your body.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a computational reservoir</p>
<p>of information and expectation that you will become.</p>
<p>So actually, I would sort of turn it around a different way</p>
<p>and say, if you wanted to create</p>
<p>the best memory storage system possible,</p>
<p>you could reverse engineer what a human is</p>
<p>and create a DNA memory system</p>
<p>that is not just the linear version,</p>
<p>but is also everything that it could become.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about DNA,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about Earth and the environment creating DNA.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about trying to come up</p>
<p>with an optimal computer for this particular environment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you were to reverse engineer that computer,</p>
<p>what do you mean by considering</p>
<p>all the possible things it could become?</p>
<p>So who you are today, right?</p>
<p>So 3 billion bits of information</p>
<p>does not explain Lex Friedman, doesn&rsquo;t explain me, right?</p>
<p>But the DNA embodies the expectation</p>
<p>of the environment in which you will live and grow</p>
<p>and become.</p>
<p>So all the information that is you, right,</p>
<p>is actually not only embedded in the DNA,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s embedded in the context</p>
<p>of the world in which you grow into and develop, right?</p>
<p>But so all that information though</p>
<p>is packed in the expectation of what the DNA expects to see.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So like some of the information,</p>
<p>is that accurate to say is stored outside the body?</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>The information is stored outside</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a context of expectation.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, to linger on this point,</p>
<p>if we were to run Earth over again a million times,</p>
<p>how many different versions</p>
<p>of this type of computer would we get?</p>
<p>I think it would be different each time.</p>
<p>I mean, if you assume there&rsquo;s no such thing as fate, right,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all pre programmed,</p>
<p>and that there is some sort of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>variation or randomness at the beginning,</p>
<p>you would get as many different versions of life</p>
<p>as you could imagine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it would all be</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s something built into the substrate</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t always be left handed proteins, right?</p>
<p>But I wonder what the flap of a butterfly wing,</p>
<p>what effects it has,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s possible that this system</p>
<p>is really good at finding the efficient answer,</p>
<p>and maybe the efficient answer is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only a small finite set of them</p>
<p>for this particular environment.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of, in a way, the anthropomorphic universe</p>
<p>of the multiverse expectations, right?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s probably a zillion other kinds of universes</p>
<p>out there if you believe in multiverse theory.</p>
<p>We only live in the ones where the rules are such</p>
<p>that lifelike hours can exist.</p>
<p>So using that logic, how many alien civilizations</p>
<p>do you think are out there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like trillions of environments, aka planets,</p>
<p>or maybe you can think even bigger than planets.</p>
<p>How many lifelike organisms do you think</p>
<p>are out there thriving, and maybe how many</p>
<p>do you think are long gone, but were once here?</p>
<p>I think, well, innumerable, I think in terms</p>
<p>of the present. Greater than zero.</p>
<p>Much greater than zero.</p>
<p>I mean, I would just be surprised.</p>
<p>What a waste, right, of all that space just for us</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re never gonna get there.</p>
<p>That would be my first way to think about it.</p>
<p>But second, I mean, I remember when I was about</p>
<p>seven or eight years old, and I would love</p>
<p>if any of your listeners could find</p>
<p>this National Geographic.</p>
<p>I remember opening the page of the National Geographic.</p>
<p>I was about, again, seven to 10 years old,</p>
<p>and it was sort of a current picture of the universe.</p>
<p>It was around probably 1968, 1969.</p>
<p>I just remember looking at it and thinking,</p>
<p>what kinds of empires have risen and fallen</p>
<p>across that space that we&rsquo;ll never know about?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t that sad that we know nothing</p>
<p>about something so grand?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve always been a reader of science fiction</p>
<p>because I like the creative ideas</p>
<p>of what people come up with.</p>
<p>And I especially like science fiction writers</p>
<p>that base it in good science,</p>
<p>but base it also in evolution.</p>
<p>That if you evolve a civilization from something</p>
<p>lifelike, right, some sort of biology,</p>
<p>its assumptions about the universe will come</p>
<p>from the environment in which it grew up.</p>
<p>So for instance, Larry Niven is a great writer,</p>
<p>and he imagines different kinds of civilizations.</p>
<p>In some cases, what happens if intelligence</p>
<p>evolved from a herd animal, right?</p>
<p>Would you lead from behind, right?</p>
<p>Would you be, you know, in his case,</p>
<p>one of them were the so called puppeteers.</p>
<p>And to them, the moral imperative is cowardice.</p>
<p>You put other people forward to run the risk for you, right?</p>
<p>And so he writes entire books around that premise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another guy, Brin, David Brin is his name,</p>
<p>and he writes the so called uplift universe books.</p>
<p>And in those, he takes different intelligences,</p>
<p>each from a different evolutionary background.</p>
<p>And then he posits a civilization based around</p>
<p>where and what they came from.</p>
<p>And so to me, I mean, that&rsquo;s just fun.</p>
<p>But I mean, back to your original question is</p>
<p>how many are there?</p>
<p>I think as many stars as we can see.</p>
<p>Now, how many are currently there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole question of,</p>
<p>you know, how long can a civilization last</p>
<p>before it runs out of steam?</p>
<p>And you, for instance, does it just get bored</p>
<p>or does it transcend to something else?</p>
<p>Or does it say, I&rsquo;ve seen enough and I&rsquo;m done?</p>
<p>What does running out of steam look like?</p>
<p>It could be destroy itself or get bored.</p>
<p>You know, or we&rsquo;ve done everything we can</p>
<p>and they just decide to stop.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you all must worry that we stop reproducing</p>
<p>or we slow down the reproduction rate</p>
<p>to where the population can go to zero.</p>
<p>We can go to zero and we can&rsquo;t and we collapse.</p>
<p>I mean, so the only way to get around that</p>
<p>is perhaps create enough machines with AI</p>
<p>to take care of us.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to people that told stories</p>
<p>of UFO encounters.</p>
<p>What is the most fascinating to you about the stories</p>
<p>of these UFO encounters that you&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that people have told you?</p>
<p>The similarity of them, the uniformity of the stories.</p>
<p>Now, I just wanna say upfront,</p>
<p>a lot of people think that when I speculate,</p>
<p>I believe something, that&rsquo;s not true, right?</p>
<p>Speculation is just creativity.</p>
<p>Speculation is the beginning of hypothesis.</p>
<p>None of what I hear in terms of the anecdotes</p>
<p>do I necessarily believe are they true?</p>
<p>But I still find them fascinating to listen to</p>
<p>because at some level they&rsquo;re still raw data</p>
<p>and you have to listen.</p>
<p>And once you start to hear the same story again and again,</p>
<p>then you have to say, well, there might be something to it.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s some kind of a Jungian background</p>
<p>in the human mind and human consciousness</p>
<p>that creates these stories again and again</p>
<p>as coming out of the DNA,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming out of that pre programmed something.</p>
<p>And Jung talked quite a bit about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>The collective unconscious.</p>
<p>But actually one of the most interesting ones I find</p>
<p>is this constant message</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not taking care of your world.</p>
<p>And this came long before climate change.</p>
<p>It came long before many kinds of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say current day memes around</p>
<p>taking care of our planet, pollution, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so, for instance, perhaps the best example of this,</p>
<p>the one that I find the most fascinating</p>
<p>is a story out of Zimbabwe, 50 or 60 children,</p>
<p>one afternoon in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It was a well educated group of white and black children</p>
<p>who had lunchtime in the playground, saw a craft</p>
<p>and they saw little men.</p>
<p>And they all ran into the teachers</p>
<p>and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures.</p>
<p>And the message several of them got was</p>
<p>you are not taking care of your planet.</p>
<p>And it got, you know, there&rsquo;s actually a movie coming out</p>
<p>on this episode and 30 years later now,</p>
<p>the people who were there, the children</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve now grown up say, it happened to us.</p>
<p>Now, did it happen?</p>
<p>Was it some sort of hallucination</p>
<p>or was it an imposed hallucination by something?</p>
<p>Was it material?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but these kids were seven to 10 years old.</p>
<p>You see them on video.</p>
<p>Seven to 10 year olds can&rsquo;t lie like that.</p>
<p>And so, you know, whether it&rsquo;s real or not, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I find that fascinating data.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s these unconnected stories</p>
<p>of individuals with the same story.</p>
<p>That is worthy of further inquiry.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here we are humans with limited cognitive capacities</p>
<p>trying to make sense of the world,</p>
<p>trying to understand what is real and not.</p>
<p>We have this DNA that somehow in complex ways</p>
<p>is interacting with the environment.</p>
<p>And then we get these novel ideas</p>
<p>that come from the populace.</p>
<p>And then they make us wonder about what it all means.</p>
<p>And so how to interpret it.</p>
<p>If you think from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms?</p>
<p>You perhaps have to find in points</p>
<p>on this interaction between the DNA and its manifestations</p>
<p>in terms of the human mind</p>
<p>and how it interacts with the environment.</p>
<p>So it gets some kind of, all right, what is this DNA?</p>
<p>What does this environment have to get in somehow</p>
<p>to like interact with it, to perturb the system</p>
<p>to where these little ants, human like ants</p>
<p>get like excited and figures and see stuff out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has, and then somehow steer them.</p>
<p>First of all, for investigative purposes,</p>
<p>understand like oftentimes to understand a system,</p>
<p>you have to perturb it.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like poke at it to get excited or not.</p>
<p>And then the other ways you want to,</p>
<p>if you worry about them,</p>
<p>you can steer in one direction or another.</p>
<p>And this kind of idea that we&rsquo;re not taking care</p>
<p>of our world, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s comforting, that&rsquo;s hopeful</p>
<p>because that means the greater intelligence,</p>
<p>which is what I would hope would want to take care of us.</p>
<p>Like we want to take care of the gorillas</p>
<p>in the national parks in Africa.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we don&rsquo;t want to take care of cockroaches.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a line we draw.</p>
<p>So you have to hope that.</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;re a bunch of angry monkeys</p>
<p>and maybe whatever these intelligences are,</p>
<p>are also keeping an eye on us.</p>
<p>That you don&rsquo;t want a bunch of,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want the angry monkey troop</p>
<p>stomping around the local galactic arm.</p>
<p>Do you think these folks are telling the truth?</p>
<p>Do you think they saw what they say they saw?</p>
<p>I think they saw what they said they saw,</p>
<p>but I also think they saw what they were shown.</p>
<p>I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of,</p>
<p>okay, how long has this been around?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t just start showing up in 1947, right?</p>
<p>There are stories going back into the 1800s</p>
<p>of people who saw things in their farming,</p>
<p>in their farm fields in the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in local newspapers from the 1800s, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But if you can go even further back,</p>
<p>so to your point of how would you as a higher intelligence</p>
<p>represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to pre civilization.</p>
<p>Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest</p>
<p>and you give messages through that.</p>
<p>Once you get a little bit more civilized,</p>
<p>then you show yourself as the gods and then you&rsquo;re God.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t believe in God anymore necessarily,</p>
<p>not everybody does.</p>
<p>So what do we believe in?</p>
<p>We believe in technology.</p>
<p>So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?</p>
<p>But the common thread is you&rsquo;re not alone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something else here with you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s, as you said, watching you</p>
<p>and at least watching over your shoulder.</p>
<p>But I think that like any good parent,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tell your student everything, you make them learn</p>
<p>and learning requires mistakes</p>
<p>because if you tell them everything, then they get lazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve looked at the brains of, or information coming</p>
<p>from the brain of some of the people</p>
<p>that have had UFO encounters.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s common about the brain of people</p>
<p>who encounter UFOs?</p>
<p>So the study started with a group of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a cohort of individuals that were brought to me</p>
<p>and their MRIs to ask about the damage</p>
<p>that had been seen in these individuals.</p>
<p>It turns out that the majority of those patients</p>
<p>ended up being, as far as we can tell, Havana syndrome.</p>
<p>And so for me at least, that part of the story ends</p>
<p>in terms of the injury,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely almost all Havana syndrome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s problem now, that&rsquo;s not my problem.</p>
<p>But when we were looking at the brains of these individuals,</p>
<p>we noticed something right in the center</p>
<p>of the basal ganglia in many of these individuals</p>
<p>that at first we thought was damage.</p>
<p>It was basically an enriched patch of MRI dense neurons</p>
<p>that we thought was damage,</p>
<p>but then it was showing up in everybody.</p>
<p>And then we looked and we said, oh, it&rsquo;s actually not.</p>
<p>The other readings on these MRIs showed</p>
<p>that actually that&rsquo;s living tissue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the head of the caudate in the pitamen.</p>
<p>And at the time, and I remember even asking</p>
<p>a good friend of mine at Stanford, who was a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>what does the basal ganglia do?</p>
<p>He said, oh, the basal ganglia is just about movement</p>
<p>and nerve and motor control.</p>
<p>I said, well, that&rsquo;s odd because these other papers</p>
<p>that we were reading at the time started to suggest</p>
<p>that it was involved with higher intelligence</p>
<p>and is actually downstream of the executive function</p>
<p>and involved with intuition and planning.</p>
<p>And then if you think about it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna have motor control,</p>
<p>which is centralized in one place,</p>
<p>motor control requires knowledge of the environment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna move something and hit the table.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re walking across a room,</p>
<p>you want to be aware and cognizant</p>
<p>of what you might bump into.</p>
<p>So obviously all of that planning</p>
<p>requires access to all the senses.</p>
<p>It requires access to your desires, memory,</p>
<p>knowledge of where and what you want</p>
<p>and desire to walk nearby.</p>
<p>Like I used the example of if you&rsquo;re at a party,</p>
<p>you wanna avoid that person, you like that person,</p>
<p>the waiter is about to drop something.</p>
<p>All without thinking, you maneuver.</p>
<p>So that actually, all that planning is done</p>
<p>in the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually now called the brain within the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a goal processing system.</p>
<p>Subservient to executive function.</p>
<p>So what we think we found there was not something</p>
<p>which allows people to talk to UFOs.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the UFO community took it a step too far.</p>
<p>What I think we found was a form of higher</p>
<p>functioning and processing.</p>
<p>So what we then looked at,</p>
<p>and this was the most fascinating part of it,</p>
<p>we looked then at individuals in the families</p>
<p>or those, let&rsquo;s say the index case individuals.</p>
<p>And we found that it was actually in families.</p>
<p>And more so, this is the most fascinating part.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve probably looked now at about 200 just random cases</p>
<p>that you can download off of databases online.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see this higher connectivity.</p>
<p>You only find it in what Kit Green would have called</p>
<p>or has called higher functioning individuals.</p>
<p>People who are, I mean, he called them savants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the means to, we haven&rsquo;t done the testing.</p>
<p>But it turns out my family has it, right?</p>
<p>We found it in me, my brother, my sister, my mother.</p>
<p>We found it as well in other individuals,</p>
<p>husband and wife pairs.</p>
<p>So statistically, if you had a group of 20 individuals</p>
<p>and you found two husband wife pairs, both of whom had it,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s only found at about, we think,</p>
<p>one in 200, one in 300 individuals.</p>
<p>The fact that two individuals came together,</p>
<p>two sets of individuals came together,</p>
<p>both of whom had it, implied either</p>
<p>a restricted breeding group or attraction.</p>
<p>The reason why it seems to be in, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>so called experiencers or people who claim,</p>
<p>if intuition is the ability to see something</p>
<p>that other people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean that in a paranormal sense,</p>
<p>but being able to see something just in front of you</p>
<p>that other people might just dismiss,</p>
<p>well, maybe that&rsquo;s a function of a higher kind</p>
<p>of intelligence to say, well, I&rsquo;m not looking at an artifact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking at something that I should just ignore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing something and I recognize it for,</p>
<p>not what it is, but that it is something</p>
<p>different than what is normally found in my environment.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I have a little bit of that.</p>
<p>I seem to see the magic in a lot of moments.</p>
<p>I have a deep, it&rsquo;s obviously, not obviously,</p>
<p>but it seems to be chemical in nature</p>
<p>that I just am excited about life.</p>
<p>I love life.</p>
<p>I love stupid things.</p>
<p>It feels like I&rsquo;m high a lot,</p>
<p>on mushrooms or something like that,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d really appreciate that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m able to detect something about the environment</p>
<p>that maybe others don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I seem to be over the top grateful to be alive</p>
<p>for a lot of stupid reasons, and that&rsquo;s in there somewhere.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>because it really is true that our brains,</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;re brought up, but also the genetics</p>
<p>enables us to see certain slices of the world,</p>
<p>and some people are probably more receptive</p>
<p>to anomalous information.</p>
<p>They see the magic, the possibility in the novel thing</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of finding the pattern</p>
<p>of the common, of the regular.</p>
<p>Some people are more, wait a minute, this is kind of weird.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of those people would probably</p>
<p>become scientists too.</p>
<p>Like, huh, there&rsquo;s this pattern happening</p>
<p>over and over and over, and then something weird</p>
<p>just happened, and then you get excited by that weirdness</p>
<p>and start to pull the string and discover</p>
<p>what is at the core of that weirdness.</p>
<p>Perhaps, is that, maybe by way of question,</p>
<p>how does the human perception system deal</p>
<p>with anomalous information, do you think?</p>
<p>Well, it first tries to classify it</p>
<p>and get it out of the way.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not food, if it&rsquo;s not sex, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not in the way of my desires,</p>
<p>or if it is in the way of my desires,</p>
<p>then you focus on it.</p>
<p>And so I think the question is</p>
<p>how much spare processing power,</p>
<p>how much CPU cycles do we spend</p>
<p>on things that are not those core desires?</p>
<p>What is the most kind of memorable, powerful</p>
<p>UFO encounter report you ever heard?</p>
<p>Just to you, on a personal level,</p>
<p>like something that was really powerful.</p>
<p>Well, I mentioned the Zimbabwe one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s particularly interesting.</p>
<p>And one that actually most people don&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>but family driving down the highway,</p>
<p>two little girls in the back, open glass topped car,</p>
<p>and the little girls see a craft right over their car.</p>
<p>This is in the middle of the day on a busy highway.</p>
<p>The mother sees it.</p>
<p>Nobody can, they look around, nobody else seems to see it.</p>
<p>So the girls take out their camera, take a picture of it,</p>
<p>and then they get home.</p>
<p>They look at the picture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no craft, but there&rsquo;s a little object</p>
<p>about 30 feet above their car or so,</p>
<p>probably about three feet across, kind of star shaped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the craft, but it&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>Obviously there was something there.</p>
<p>And so what were they seeing?</p>
<p>Were they seeing a projection?</p>
<p>Were they seeing, and why were only they seeing it?</p>
<p>And the photograph was capturing something very different</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;re seeing, but they&rsquo;re still an object.</p>
<p>Can you give a little bit of context?</p>
<p>Is this from modern day?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s modern day.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, they had a camera.</p>
<p>I mean, they had a cell phone camera.</p>
<p>And this is like a report provided.</p>
<p>By the way, where is a central place to provide a report?</p>
<p>Is this?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a move on, but this isn&rsquo;t public.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the picture.</p>
<p>Oh, this is something you&rsquo;ve directly interacted with.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen the picture.</p>
<p>So those moments like that, they captivate your mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so different,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t fall into the standard story at all.</p>
<p>But it also, but in another way, it&rsquo;s kind of a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a clear enunciation of this notion</p>
<p>that when people see events,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t all see the same thing.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve heard this about traffic accidents.</p>
<p>Different people will see the color of the car differently</p>
<p>or the chain of events differently.</p>
<p>And this tells you that memory isn&rsquo;t anywhere near</p>
<p>what we think it is.</p>
<p>But the issue around these so called UFO reports</p>
<p>is that the same people will see a very different thing,</p>
<p>almost as if whatever it is is projecting a,</p>
<p>is projecting something into the mind</p>
<p>rather than it being real, right?</p>
<p>Rather than it being a real manifestation,</p>
<p>material in front of you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually almost some sort of an altered virtual reality</p>
<p>that is imposed on you.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the company Meta</p>
<p>and all the virtual reality companies</p>
<p>would love to have something like that, right?</p>
<p>Where you don&rsquo;t have to actually wear something</p>
<p>on your face to experience a virtual reality.</p>
<p>What happens if you could just project it?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the fundamental question</p>
<p>from an alien perspective.</p>
<p>When you look at it, or as we humans look at ants,</p>
<p>how does its perception system operate?</p>
<p>So not only how does this thing&rsquo;s mind operate,</p>
<p>how does the human mind operate,</p>
<p>but how does their perception system operate</p>
<p>so that we can stimulate the perception system properly</p>
<p>to get them to think certain things.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s a really important question.</p>
<p>Humans think that the only way to communicate</p>
<p>is in 3D or 4D space time, there&rsquo;s physical objects,</p>
<p>or maybe you write things into some kind of language.</p>
<p>But there could be just so much more richness</p>
<p>in how you can communicate.</p>
<p>And so, from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>where somebody has much greater technological capabilities,</p>
<p>you have to figure out how do I use the skills I have</p>
<p>to stimulate the limited humans.</p>
<p>Right, well, I mean, let&rsquo;s take the ants exam</p>
<p>again as an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you wanted to make ants practical.</p>
<p>You wanted to use them for something, right?</p>
<p>You wanted to use them as a form of biological robot.</p>
<p>Now, DARPA and other people have been trying</p>
<p>to use insects for, turn them into biological robots.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to, you would have to interact</p>
<p>with their sense of smell, right?</p>
<p>Their pheromone system that they use to interact</p>
<p>with each other.</p>
<p>So you would either create those molecules</p>
<p>to talk to them, to make them do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying talk to them as if they&rsquo;re intelligent,</p>
<p>but talk to them to manipulate them in ways that you want.</p>
<p>Or if you were advanced enough,</p>
<p>you would use some sort of electromagnetic or other means</p>
<p>to stimulate their neurons in ways</p>
<p>that would accomplish the same goal as the pheromones,</p>
<p>but by doing it in a sort of a telefactoring way.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you wanted to telefactor with humans.</p>
<p>You would interact with them.</p>
<p>And this is, again, this is a technology</p>
<p>which you could imagine possible.</p>
<p>You could telefactor information</p>
<p>into the sensory system of a human, right?</p>
<p>But then each human is a little bit different.</p>
<p>So either you know enough about them to tailor it</p>
<p>to that individual, or you just basically take advantage</p>
<p>of whatever the sensory net is that that individual has.</p>
<p>So if you happen to be good at sound,</p>
<p>or you happen to be a very visually inclined individual,</p>
<p>then maybe the sensory information that you get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most effective in terms of transmitting information</p>
<p>would come through that portal.</p>
<p>I think the aliens would need to figure out</p>
<p>that humans value physical consistency.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve discovered physics.</p>
<p>So we want our perception to make sense.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an obvious fact of perception,</p>
<p>that you have to figure out what kind of things</p>
<p>are humans used to observing</p>
<p>in this particular environment of Earth,</p>
<p>and how do we stimulate the perception system</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not anomalous,</p>
<p>or not too, it doesn&rsquo;t cross that threshold</p>
<p>of just like, well, that&rsquo;s way too weird.</p>
<p>So they have to, I mean, that&rsquo;s not obvious</p>
<p>that that should be important.</p>
<p>Maybe you wanna err on the side of anomaly,</p>
<p>like lean into the weirdness.</p>
<p>So communication is complicated.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I always find this issue</p>
<p>of people talking about the so called grays as interesting,</p>
<p>because it is related to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different enough,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not so different as to be scary, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not venom dripping fangs, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different enough,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like they&rsquo;re what you could imagine</p>
<p>us becoming in some distant future.</p>
<p>So is that a purposeful representation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t believe in the grays, for instance,</p>
<p>but I believe that people think that they see it.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re talking about a communication strategy</p>
<p>that says, you know, we&rsquo;re like you,</p>
<p>but not the same as you,</p>
<p>this might be a manifestation that you represent</p>
<p>in terms of a communication strategy.</p>
<p>What do you make of David&rsquo;s favorite sighting</p>
<p>of the Tic Tac UFO,</p>
<p>and other pilots who have seen these objects</p>
<p>that seem to defy the laws of physics?</p>
<p>Well, I think you have to take them at their word.</p>
<p>Are they fascinating to you?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>No, I know a lot of these people, right?</p>
<p>So I know Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon,</p>
<p>the whole crowd I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>I saw the videos about three weeks or so</p>
<p>before they went public.</p>
<p>I was at a bar with Lou overlooking the Pentagon</p>
<p>in Crystal City, and they showed them to me,</p>
<p>and my hair stood on end.</p>
<p>And he said, this is coming out soon.</p>
<p>And I know one of the guys on the inside</p>
<p>who was the Naval Intelligence</p>
<p>who had interviewed all of these pilots again</p>
<p>before this came out.</p>
<p>And it was hair raising to hear this,</p>
<p>but also exciting that here&rsquo;s not just people&rsquo;s testimony,</p>
<p>these are credible individuals.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve seen the 60 minute episode</p>
<p>with some of the pilots,</p>
<p>they have no monetary gain.</p>
<p>If anything, they&rsquo;ve got negative gain from coming out.</p>
<p>But then you also have all of those simultaneous</p>
<p>ship analysis from the USS Princeton</p>
<p>and the radar analysis, et cetera.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s just data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a conclusion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be perfectly happy, honestly, perfectly happy</p>
<p>if somebody showed that it was all a hoax.</p>
<p>I can go back to my day job, right?</p>
<p>That could be a hoax, but other things might not be.</p>
<p>This is the point.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s nice to remove some of the stigma</p>
<p>about this topic because it&rsquo;s all just data</p>
<p>and anomalous events are such that they&rsquo;re going to be rare</p>
<p>in terms of how much data they represent.</p>
<p>But we have to consider the full range of data</p>
<p>to discover the things that actually represent something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, if we pull at it, we&rsquo;ll discover something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extraterrestrial or something deep</p>
<p>about the phenomena on Earth that we don&rsquo;t yet understand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, if it only stimulates people, for instance,</p>
<p>to think, okay, well, what happens if we could move</p>
<p>like that with momentumless movement?</p>
<p>And it stimulates young individuals to go into the sciences</p>
<p>to ask those questions.</p>
<p>That to me is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, after I&rsquo;ve been openly talking about this</p>
<p>in the last year, especially, I&rsquo;ve had a number</p>
<p>of students from top schools who aren&rsquo;t my students</p>
<p>come to me and say, if I can help, let me.</p>
<p>How can I help?</p>
<p>I never had thought about this before,</p>
<p>but you opened, you and others, not just you and others,</p>
<p>have opened my mind to thinking about this matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s actually funny</p>
<p>that Elon Musk doesn&rsquo;t think too much about this,</p>
<p>these kinds of propulsion systems that could defy</p>
<p>the laws of physics as we currently understand them.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s a powerful way to think what is possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring, even if some of the data</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t represent extraterrestrial vehicles.</p>
<p>I think the observation itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like something you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is hypothesizing, imagining these things,</p>
<p>considering the possibility of these things,</p>
<p>I think opens up your mind in a way</p>
<p>that ultimately can create the technology.</p>
<p>First, you have to believe the technology is possible</p>
<p>before you can create it.</p>
<p>In my own lab, we always look for,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve said before, what is inevitable,</p>
<p>and saying inevitably this is the kind of data we need,</p>
<p>but if we need that kind of data,</p>
<p>the instrument we want doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Okay, so I imagine the perfect instrument, I can&rsquo;t make it,</p>
<p>and you back into something which is practical,</p>
<p>and then you, in a sense, reverse engineer the future</p>
<p>of what it is that you wanna make.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve started and sold at least half a dozen</p>
<p>or more companies using that basic premise.</p>
<p>And so it was always something that didn&rsquo;t exist today,</p>
<p>but we imagined what we wanted.</p>
<p>And at the time, many people said it couldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, all the gene therapy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done today with retroviruses</p>
<p>came from a group meeting in David Baltimore&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>I was a postdoc with him, and one of the other postdocs</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to make retroviruses in a way</p>
<p>that he wanted to, and I realized I had a cell line</p>
<p>that would allow us to make retroviruses</p>
<p>in two days rather than two months.</p>
<p>And so he and I then worked together to make that system,</p>
<p>and now all gene therapy with retroviruses</p>
<p>is done using this basic approach around the whole world,</p>
<p>because something couldn&rsquo;t be done,</p>
<p>and we wanted to do it better, and we imagined the future.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, I think, what the whole UFO phenomenon</p>
<p>is doing for people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, let&rsquo;s imagine a future</p>
<p>where these kinds of technologies are,</p>
<p>but also let&rsquo;s imagine a future</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t blow ourselves up, right?</p>
<p>So if these things are there,</p>
<p>they manage to not blow themselves up.</p>
<p>So it means that at least one other civilization</p>
<p>got past the inflection point.</p>
<p>So if some of the encounters are actually representing</p>
<p>alien civilizations visiting us,</p>
<p>why do you think they&rsquo;re doing so?</p>
<p>You suggested that perhaps it&rsquo;s the study</p>
<p>understand their own past, right?</p>
<p>What are some of the motivations, do you think?</p>
<p>And again, from our perspective, us as humans,</p>
<p>what motivations would we have</p>
<p>when we approach other civilizations</p>
<p>we might discover in the future?</p>
<p>Well, I think one motivation might be</p>
<p>to steer us away from the precipice, right?</p>
<p>Or on the assumption that,</p>
<p>even if we make it past the precipice,</p>
<p>at least we&rsquo;re not a bunch of psychopaths running around.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a little bit of motivation there</p>
<p>to make sure that the neighbor that&rsquo;s growing up next to you</p>
<p>is not unruly.</p>
<p>But I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s sort of a moral imperative,</p>
<p>like what we have with creating national parks</p>
<p>where animals can continue to live out their lives</p>
<p>in a natural way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be, I mean, the problem is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re imagining from a anthropomorphic viewpoint</p>
<p>what an alien might think.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said before, alien means alien, right?</p>
<p>I mean, not Hollywood aliens,</p>
<p>but a whole different way of thinking</p>
<p>and a whole different level of experience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say wisdom, hopefully,</p>
<p>that we could only hope to understand.</p>
<p>Now, but if we ever get out there,</p>
<p>if we ever make it past our current problems,</p>
<p>and even if we don&rsquo;t have faster than light travel,</p>
<p>and even if we&rsquo;re only using ram scoops</p>
<p>or light sails to get where we wanna go,</p>
<p>and it takes us 10,000 years to get somewhere</p>
<p>or to spread out, we might encounter such things.</p>
<p>And are we just gonna stomp all over it</p>
<p>like we did in colonial South America or Africa</p>
<p>or all the rest on our current path, likely?</p>
<p>And so what are we gonna learn?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re getting better and better</p>
<p>at understanding what is life.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re getting better and better</p>
<p>at being careful, not to step on it when we see it.</p>
<p>And this is one of the nice things</p>
<p>about talking about UFOs is it expands the Overton window.</p>
<p>It expands our understanding of what possibly could be life.</p>
<p>It gets us to think.</p>
<p>It gets the scientific community to think.</p>
<p>When we go to Mars, when we go to these different moons</p>
<p>that possibly have life,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not looking at legged organisms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at some kind of complexity</p>
<p>that arises in resistance to the natural world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting.</p>
<p>I like that, resistance to the natural world, yeah.</p>
<p>So somehow there&rsquo;s a rebellious process,</p>
<p>complex system going on here.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the many ways it could take form.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense for aliens that as the technology develops,</p>
<p>they take form more and more as information,</p>
<p>as something that can influence the space of ideas,</p>
<p>of the processing of data itself.</p>
<p>So I just, this idea of embodiment that we humans so admire,</p>
<p>physically visible, perceivable embodiment</p>
<p>may be a very inefficient thing, right?</p>
<p>If you think just about your area, AI,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to make smaller and smaller and smaller</p>
<p>circuitry that is basically closer and closer</p>
<p>to the physics of how the universe operates, right?</p>
<p>Right down at the level of, I mean, quantum computers</p>
<p>are basically right down about quantum information storage.</p>
<p>So fast forward 10,000, 100,000 years,</p>
<p>maybe somebody found a way to embody AI directly</p>
<p>into the physics of the universe, right?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t require a physical manifestation.</p>
<p>It just sits in space time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a locally ordered space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just locally ordered space time, right?</p>
<p>You know, I mean, but maybe they just,</p>
<p>they found a way to embody it there.</p>
<p>They probably have to get really good</p>
<p>at not, you know, trampling on the ants.</p>
<p>The better your technology gets,</p>
<p>the easier it is to accidentally like, oops,</p>
<p>just destroy these simpleton biological systems.</p>
<p>We constantly think about whatever these things might be.</p>
<p>We think that they are some sort of a unified force.</p>
<p>Well, maybe they&rsquo;re not unified.</p>
<p>Maybe they are as disparate as you and I are.</p>
<p>And maybe what keeps them from stomping all over the ants</p>
<p>is each other, right?</p>
<p>That they are in a self tension</p>
<p>to prevent one or more of them from running amok.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of the anarchy of nations</p>
<p>that we have on earth.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always going to be this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hierarchy.</p>
<p>This hierarchy that&rsquo;s formed</p>
<p>of greater and greater intelligences.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all probably also wondering,</p>
<p>wait, what&rsquo;s bigger than me?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I always wonder is that maybe that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>what keeps them in line is something that is beyond them.</p>
<p>Like what created the universe.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s probably a question that bothers them too.</p>
<p>What about the communication task itself?</p>
<p>How hard do you think it is for aliens</p>
<p>to communicate with humans?</p>
<p>So is this something you think about</p>
<p>about this barrier of communication</p>
<p>between biological systems and something else?</p>
<p>How difficult is it to find a common language?</p>
<p>Well, I think if you&rsquo;re smart enough</p>
<p>or technologically enabled enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, whether your concepts</p>
<p>can ever be dumbed down to us,</p>
<p>that might be hard.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Again, talking to the ants.</p>
<p>Talking to the ants.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>On Instagram.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You want to look good in this picture.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the essential problem of,</p>
<p>you know, perhaps they realize</p>
<p>who it is that they&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>And they say, rather than muddy the picture,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only going to give them limited information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe we could sit down,</p>
<p>like you and I, and have a conversation.</p>
<p>But then they would make assumptions.</p>
<p>The humans would then make assumptions about us</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not humans, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stay at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just let them know that we&rsquo;re here, right?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the limited amount of communication.</p>
<p>Again, this notion that</p>
<p>if you give somebody everything, they&rsquo;ll get lazy.</p>
<p>And, you know, if they&rsquo;ve been around as long as they have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve seen every kind of thing that can go wrong.</p>
<p>And so they know as much as they might want to step in,</p>
<p>that that would be a wrong thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to also understand</p>
<p>the amount of wisdom they carry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and so it&rsquo;s very easy as well for religions to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into a whole religious conversation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very easy for,</p>
<p>you could see how religions could call them angels</p>
<p>or devils or what have you.</p>
<p>Because, again, if you&rsquo;re trying to fit it</p>
<p>into a framework of cultural understanding,</p>
<p>the first thing you reach for is God.</p>
<p>And so when you look at what these things are,</p>
<p>and again, with the angels and the devils,</p>
<p>in a similar sort of way, their communication is limited.</p>
<p>They just kind of give little, what&rsquo;s the oracle of Delphi?</p>
<p>They kind of give these Delphic pronouncements,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out</p>
<p>what it is that they really mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Steven Greer claimed that a skeleton discovered</p>
<p>in Atacama region of Chile might be an alien.</p>
<p>You reached out to him and took on the task</p>
<p>of proving or disproving that with the rigor of science.</p>
<p>The result is a paper titled</p>
<p>Whole Genome Sequencing of Atacama Skeleton</p>
<p>Shows Novel Mutations Linked with Dysplasia.</p>
<p>Can you tell this full story?</p>
<p>Well, the story was, as you put it right there, correct.</p>
<p>Reached out, got a sample of the body,</p>
<p>did the DNA sequencing, then worked with a team</p>
<p>of two other Stanford scientists</p>
<p>and Roche sequencing group, Roche Diagnostics,</p>
<p>and probably a total team of about 11 or so people.</p>
<p>And as is standard in these kinds of things,</p>
<p>the professors actually don&rsquo;t do the work.</p>
<p>The students do the work and figured out the answer.</p>
<p>And then we helped them put together the story.</p>
<p>And the story was simply that it was human, 100%.</p>
<p>I went into it thinking it was originally a monkey</p>
<p>of some sort.</p>
<p>I got kind of excited a few months into the process,</p>
<p>thinking, well, what happens if it is an alien, right?</p>
<p>Can you describe some of the characteristics</p>
<p>of the skeleton that makes it unique and interesting?</p>
<p>Primarily, it had dysmorphias of the brain.</p>
<p>And so the first thing I did actually,</p>
<p>when I got pictures of it,</p>
<p>I took it to a local expert at Stanford</p>
<p>and he was on the paper.</p>
<p>And he was the world expert in pediatric bone dysmorphias.</p>
<p>He literally wrote the book on this,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>You go to an expert when it&rsquo;s outside</p>
<p>of your field of interest.</p>
<p>And he said, well, I haven&rsquo;t seen this particular collection</p>
<p>of mutations before or this physiology before,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what I think it might be.</p>
<p>And he said, but based on the size of the thing</p>
<p>and the bone density, it would appear to be like six</p>
<p>or seven years old.</p>
<p>Now, again, that&rsquo;s the thing where I think the lay public</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand or takes a speculation like that</p>
<p>and turns it into a fact.</p>
<p>No one ever said that it was that age.</p>
<p>We only said that the bones made it look like it was</p>
<p>that age, but then we went back and looked for,</p>
<p>we went back and looked for genetic explanations</p>
<p>of why things might look the way they did.</p>
<p>And if you, again, read the paper is very carefully</p>
<p>caveated to say that these mutations might result in this.</p>
<p>But what we did find was an unexpectedly large number</p>
<p>of mutations associated with bone growth in this individual.</p>
<p>And it was just a bad roll of the dice, right?</p>
<p>You roll the dice enough times</p>
<p>with enough people born every year</p>
<p>and someone will roll the wrong dice all at once.</p>
<p>So the sad part about it was individuals</p>
<p>in the UFO community who wanted to think</p>
<p>that there was some sort of conspiracy around it, right?</p>
<p>That somebody had somehow convinced all of my students to lie.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, you know, I would lose my job,</p>
<p>first of all, and they would all be in trouble forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also it&rsquo;s just projecting malevolence</p>
<p>onto people that doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think exists</p>
<p>in normal populace and especially doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>in the scientific community.</p>
<p>The kind of people that go into science,</p>
<p>I mean, this is what bothers me</p>
<p>with the current distrust of science,</p>
<p>is they might be naive, they might not,</p>
<p>especially in modern science, look at the big picture,</p>
<p>philosophical, ethical questions, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but ultimately they&rsquo;re people with integrity</p>
<p>and just a deep curiosity</p>
<p>for the discovery of cool little things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no malevolence, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>in the scientific community.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a bigger story here,</p>
<p>which is, you know, there&rsquo;s a hunger in the populace</p>
<p>to discover something anomalous, something new.</p>
<p>And, you know, science has to be both open to the anomalous,</p>
<p>but also to reject the anomalous</p>
<p>when the data doesn&rsquo;t support it.</p>
<p>What do you make of that, you know,</p>
<p>walking that line for you?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re dealing with UFO encounters,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with the anomalous.</p>
<p>Well, people have said, let&rsquo;s go back to the Atacama case</p>
<p>that I was debunking it.</p>
<p>Well, debunking is a loaded term.</p>
<p>Sort of assumes that you were going in purposefully</p>
<p>to prove something is wrong.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, I was just going in to collect the data.</p>
<p>And, you know, I showed that this one was human.</p>
<p>There was another skull that somebody had at one point.</p>
<p>It was called the star child.</p>
<p>They called it the star child skull.</p>
<p>I said, you know, I looked at it.</p>
<p>I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done.</p>
<p>I said, this is human.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>The people who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me,</p>
<p>and then eventually another group came in</p>
<p>and proved that I was right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about debunking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting the more spectacular and hyped cases</p>
<p>off the table.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I got interested in it</p>
<p>is because somebody was hyping it.</p>
<p>And not because I wanted to disprove it,</p>
<p>but because I just wanted to know.</p>
<p>And thus, get it off the table, because it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the rubble will be something interesting.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>You get the dross off the table.</p>
<p>And then somewhere in the data will</p>
<p>be something worth real inquiry.</p>
<p>And that, if you inquire deeply enough,</p>
<p>will be extravagant as well.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what actually excites scientists is to, I mean,</p>
<p>you want, with the rigor of science,</p>
<p>to actually reveal the extravagant.</p>
<p>And so look at CRISPR as probably the most perfect</p>
<p>example of that.</p>
<p>These weird sequences in bacterial genomes,</p>
<p>all arrayed one after the other with these strange sequences</p>
<p>around them, but when you looked at the sequences,</p>
<p>they looked like viruses.</p>
<p>And so how did they get there?</p>
<p>And lo and behold, after a lot of effort and work,</p>
<p>well, a couple of Nobel Prizes went out the door.</p>
<p>But these strange things ended up</p>
<p>having extraordinarily extravagant possibilities.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also looked at UFO materials.</p>
<p>You are in possession of UFO materials yourself.</p>
<p>Claimed UFO materials, alleged.</p>
<p>Alleged UFO materials, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s another term?</p>
<p>Weird materials that don&rsquo;t seem to have a story.</p>
<p>They have a story that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be of natural origins,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, you know, there&rsquo;s a process to proving that.</p>
<p>And that process may take decades, if not centuries,</p>
<p>because you have to keep pulling at the string</p>
<p>and discover where they could possibly come from.</p>
<p>But anyway, you&rsquo;re in a possession</p>
<p>of some materials of this kind.</p>
<p>Can you describe some of them and maybe also</p>
<p>talk to the process of how you investigate them,</p>
<p>how do you analyze them?</p>
<p>Right, so let&rsquo;s say that there&rsquo;s two classes of materials</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been given by people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not given by the government or anything,</p>
<p>just given people who&rsquo;ve collected them,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a reasonable chain of evidence associated</p>
<p>with them that you believe is not just a pebble somebody</p>
<p>picked up off a road.</p>
<p>There are almost always things that people have claimed</p>
<p>have either been dropped off as like some sort</p>
<p>of a leftover material, molten metals,</p>
<p>or they are from an object that was released from this</p>
<p>or that kind of exploded.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost always metals.</p>
<p>I have some couple of things that</p>
<p>might be biological that are interesting that I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really spent a lot of time on yet.</p>
<p>When you look at a metal, you basically, well, OK,</p>
<p>what are the elements in it?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s it made of?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s pretty standard approaches to doing that.</p>
<p>Most of them involve a technology</p>
<p>called mass spectrometry, and there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>about five or six different kinds of mass spectrometry</p>
<p>that you could bring to bear on answering it.</p>
<p>And they either tell you, depending</p>
<p>upon the limit of the resolution of the instrument,</p>
<p>they either tell you the elements that are there,</p>
<p>or they tell you the isotopes that are there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re interested not just in knowing whether something</p>
<p>is there or not, you&rsquo;re interested in knowing</p>
<p>whether there are the amounts of it,</p>
<p>and in the case of elements, how many different isotopes</p>
<p>are there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of where, in some of these cases,</p>
<p>it gets interesting.</p>
<p>Because in at least one of the materials,</p>
<p>as we first studied it, the isotope ratios of, in this case,</p>
<p>it was magnesium, are way off normal.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.</p>
<p>All it proves is that it was probably accomplished</p>
<p>by some kind of an industrial process.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the result of a process,</p>
<p>and this is sort of the leftover,</p>
<p>or whether it was made that way for a particular purpose,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>All I know is that it was engineered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But then the question is, sort of you go one step deeper,</p>
<p>why would you engineer it?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Why engineer it, and what does engineered means?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of, it could be a byproduct,</p>
<p>it could be the main result of an engineering process,</p>
<p>it would be a small part of the engineering process that</p>
<p>is the main part.</p>
<p>Well, so the ratios of isotopes for any given element</p>
<p>are basically the result of stellar processes.</p>
<p>Supernova blew up sometime several billion years ago.</p>
<p>That became a cloud.</p>
<p>Those atoms coalesced gravitationally</p>
<p>to form another sun, and a ring that became a rocky planet.</p>
<p>And the ratios of the isotopes were determined</p>
<p>at the time of that explosion.</p>
<p>And so everything in the local solar system</p>
<p>is more or less of that ratio, depending</p>
<p>upon certain gravitational difference.</p>
<p>But by fragments of a percent, not whole tens of percent</p>
<p>difference.</p>
<p>So what do humans use isotopes for?</p>
<p>Mostly to blow stuff up.</p>
<p>I mean, the vast majority of the isotopes</p>
<p>that have been made in the per pound or ton</p>
<p>are things like certain ratios of plutonium and uranium</p>
<p>to blow stuff up.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make or engineer isotopes, which today</p>
<p>is relatively easy to do, but it&rsquo;s still expensive.</p>
<p>For any other reason, apart from, let&rsquo;s say, anti cancer,</p>
<p>we use stable isotopes and money these days</p>
<p>as a counterfeiting tool.</p>
<p>You basically embed certain ratios of isotopes</p>
<p>in to make it harder for counterfeiters to accomplish.</p>
<p>But other than that, we don&rsquo;t do anything with that.</p>
<p>So why would you make grams of such material in this one case</p>
<p>and drop it around on a beach in Brazil?</p>
<p>So which case are we talking about?</p>
<p>Describe that, because this is the Ubatuba case.</p>
<p>Can you describe this case a little bit further,</p>
<p>like what material we&rsquo;re talking about, just the full story</p>
<p>of the case?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>So a fisherman saw an object that released something,</p>
<p>or it exploded.</p>
<p>And it was this relatively, I&rsquo;ve got some big chunks of it,</p>
<p>relatively pure magnesium with obviously something else in it</p>
<p>because magnesium burns.</p>
<p>So it had something in it that would, other metals,</p>
<p>simple alloy that would prevent it from basically burning up.</p>
<p>And so the question is, and so then we</p>
<p>had two pieces that came from two different chains of custody,</p>
<p>both claimed to be from the same object.</p>
<p>At least physically, when you look at the two things,</p>
<p>they look the same.</p>
<p>So we took small fragments of each of them.</p>
<p>We put them in an instrument called a secondary ion mass</p>
<p>spec, which is an extremely sensitive instrument.</p>
<p>And it can see down to 0.0001 mass units,</p>
<p>which is important for, let&rsquo;s say, more arcane reasons.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a sensitive instrument.</p>
<p>And so one of the chains of custody,</p>
<p>we had two pieces from the same chain of custody,</p>
<p>and then two pieces from the other chain of custody.</p>
<p>One of them had completely normal magnesium isotope</p>
<p>ratios, magnesium 24, 25, 26.</p>
<p>And the other was off, not just slightly off, way off.</p>
<p>And they were both off to the same extent.</p>
<p>I mean, it was sort of like you had an internal control</p>
<p>of what was normal.</p>
<p>And you had this other one, which was wrong.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re left with kind of an open question.</p>
<p>Was this a hoax?</p>
<p>Were these two chains of custody, one of them a hoax,</p>
<p>that somebody purposefully introduced those things?</p>
<p>Because you could do it.</p>
<p>It would cost a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, at the time that this was found,</p>
<p>I guess the 1970s or so, it might have been earlier,</p>
<p>I forget, the amount that I had would</p>
<p>have cost several tens of thousands of dollars to make.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not something you would just throw around.</p>
<p>And why would you do it in the hope that some guy 30 years</p>
<p>from then would pick it up and study it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very subtle, subtle troll.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long term plan.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t know what to make of it,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So a different kind of question that you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>is, what constitutes evidence?</p>
<p>So is this sufficient evidence? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>But somebody&rsquo;s put it forward.</p>
<p>I have the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll study it.</p>
<p>And my objective is to sort of take</p>
<p>those that I think are credible enough</p>
<p>and do a reasonable analysis, put it out there.</p>
<p>And maybe somebody else will come up with an idea</p>
<p>as to what it is.</p>
<p>Now, what would be better is some sort of true technology,</p>
<p>something that is obviously.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth Shostak</p>
<p>have come out rightfully and have said,</p>
<p>when you show up with something really obviously technology</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand, then we&rsquo;ll pay attention.</p>
<p>Not just material.</p>
<p>A piece of metal is interesting.</p>
<p>And several of the things that I&rsquo;ve looked at</p>
<p>and other things that people have come to me with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve found to be completely banal</p>
<p>or were actually pieces of aircraft</p>
<p>that were invented back in the 1940s.</p>
<p>And so take them off the table.</p>
<p>But I think, again, I think showing up</p>
<p>with technology that we humans would find completely novel</p>
<p>is actually a really difficult task for aliens</p>
<p>because it obviously can&rsquo;t be so novel</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>And I would say most of the technology aliens likely have</p>
<p>would be something we don&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a hard problem how to convince ants.</p>
<p>You first have to understand what ants are tweeting about.</p>
<p>What they care about in order to inject into their culture.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s why I think it would be the technology</p>
<p>that you could present is in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>is try to influence individual humans with the encounters</p>
<p>and try to, with this kind of thing that you mentioned</p>
<p>about us not taking messages, about us not taking care of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult. I mean, for them to understand,</p>
<p>you have to come up with trinkets that impress us.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the very technology,</p>
<p>the fascination with the development of technology</p>
<p>and the development of technology,</p>
<p>the actual act of innovation itself</p>
<p>is the thing that they&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of what Jacques Vall√©e thinks about, is the role of&hellip;</p>
<p>The control system, he calls it.</p>
<p>The control system. Well, let me ask about Jacques.</p>
<p>Who is he? You know him. Who is Jacques Vall√©e?</p>
<p>What have you learned from him about life, about UFOs,</p>
<p>about technology, about our role in the universe?</p>
<p>Well, I met Jacques actually soon after the whole Atacama thing happened.</p>
<p>I was visited by those people associated with the government</p>
<p>and whatever around the Havana&hellip;</p>
<p>What ended up mostly being Havana syndrome patients,</p>
<p>but also Jacques at the same time.</p>
<p>And they were actually working behind the scenes with each other,</p>
<p>that, oh, here&rsquo;s this Stanford professor</p>
<p>who is willing to talk about this stuff and investigate things.</p>
<p>Maybe we should go talk to him.</p>
<p>And he reached out through a colleague</p>
<p>and he and I had lunch actually at the Rosewood Inn up on near Sandhill.</p>
<p>So Jacques is one of the first openly active scientists,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really a scientist, in this area going back to the 1960s.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s put forward a number of ideas,</p>
<p>speculations about what it might be that people are interacting with.</p>
<p>And the first thing that I learned from him</p>
<p>is this notion of what he called Kabuki theater,</p>
<p>that many of the things that people have seen are&hellip;</p>
<p>I remember reading his books and thinking,</p>
<p>he uses this word absurd a lot.</p>
<p>He said, the things that people claim they see are absurd, right?</p>
<p>A ship doesn&rsquo;t land in a farmer&rsquo;s field</p>
<p>and then come up and knock on the door and say,</p>
<p>can I have a glass of water?</p>
<p>And these are stories literally out of newspapers from the 1930s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>And the other thing that people say, ships don&rsquo;t crash.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so technologically advanced, you don&rsquo;t crash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd that they crash.</p>
<p>So he says, this is put on as a show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an influence campaign, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not meant to influence individuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meant to influence a culture as a whole.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t look at us as individuals.</p>
<p>Maybe they look at us as an organism that lives on a planet, right?</p>
<p>And perhaps rightly so.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how you interact with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you influence them.</p>
<p>So that was one of the first things that kind of took me back</p>
<p>and realized, wow, there&rsquo;s actually&hellip;</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a puppet master behind the scenes that&rsquo;s doing this influencing</p>
<p>and that all this stuff about aliens is just not true, per se.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a representation of something that is meant to influence.</p>
<p>So that was probably the most interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, the man is brilliant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, and I&rsquo;m sorry, Jacques, he can also be incredibly annoying</p>
<p>to have a conversation with because he will pick apart your arguments</p>
<p>or anything that you think you know</p>
<p>and show you why you don&rsquo;t know what you think you know.</p>
<p>And he used the example that, for me, that is all you need</p>
<p>is one counter example to any conclusion and you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And so I learned from him&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m supposed to be a good scientist, but I learned from him,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk about conclusions, just talk about the data</p>
<p>because data is not wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, convince yourself that the data is not wrong or not an artifact,</p>
<p>but be careful about your conclusions because whatever is going on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more complicated than we imagine.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>Being able to always step back because we humans get excited.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>Powerful, being able to always step back because we humans get excited.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.</p>
<p>Well, in some of my Twitter feeds, when I dare to go on Twitter,</p>
<p>are full of, well, when are you going to give us the answer?</p>
<p>Science is not immediate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to be patient.</p>
<p>And even some of my science colleagues have said, well, where&rsquo;s the data?</p>
<p>My answer to them has been, where&rsquo;s been your work to try to produce any?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to give you everything on a silver platter.</p>
<p>We talked offline how much I love data and machine learning and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been really disheartening to see the U.S.</p>
<p>government not invest as much as they possibly could into this whole process.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump to the most recent thing, which is what do you make of the report</p>
<p>titled Preliminary Assessment, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena that was released by the</p>
<p>Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June 2021.</p>
<p>So this is what&rsquo;s like, okay, we&rsquo;re going to step back and we&rsquo;re going to like,</p>
<p>where do we stand and where do we hope the future is?</p>
<p>What do you make of that report?</p>
<p>Is it hopeful?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>I see it as very hopeful, very hopeful.</p>
<p>I think the adults are finally stepping up and being in charge, right?</p>
<p>In the good sense of adult.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>In the good sense of adult.</p>
<p>This childlike curiosity is a pretty powerful thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, I think, the people who were worried that the populace at large might run</p>
<p>screaming into the streets and riot, you know, have, you know, they basically,</p>
<p>the empiric evidence is they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You know, these videos and all these things have been out for now, what, five years?</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even know about it, right?</p>
<p>So as hyped as it&rsquo;s been and all over the newspapers that it&rsquo;s been and et cetera,</p>
<p>you know, even Tucker Carlson has talked about it many times on his news program.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan has.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>So I think people, if it&rsquo;s not affecting their day to day life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going on with their day to day life.</p>
<p>So, but that said, I think it was an important sea change in the internal</p>
<p>discussions going on in the government because, and the reason being,</p>
<p>that I think this is actually partly true with the maturation of human social technology.</p>
<p>It was becoming so obvious that this stuff was showing up again and again and again around our ships.</p>
<p>They just couldn&rsquo;t keep it quiet anymore, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, we need to do something about it.</p>
<p>And Lou Elizondo and Chris and others, to their great credit, found the right angle to talk about this.</p>
<p>It says, well, okay, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not out there.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the Russians, the Chinese or somebody else.</p>
<p>We should know about this because we damn sure know it&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>So that to me is an important thing to finally be a little bit more open about the matter.</p>
<p>But like I often say, I&rsquo;m not looking for people to give me permission to do anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to do the analysis myself with what I have.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb has taken the same approach.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m not going to wait for the government to give me telescopic information about technologies</p>
<p>or things that might be even on our own solar system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to collect it myself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the right way to do it, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for somebody else to give it to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to inspire a large number of people to do a wider spread data collection.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, you yourself can&rsquo;t do a large enough data collection that would,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about anomalous events, you should be collecting high resolution data</p>
<p>about everything that&rsquo;s happening on Earth in terms of like, in terms of the kind of things</p>
<p>that would indicate to you a strong signal that something weird happened here.</p>
<p>And this is why governments can be good at funding large scale efforts.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, NASA and so on, working with SpaceX, with Blue Origin, you know,</p>
<p>fund capitalistic sort of fund companies, fund company efforts to do huge moonshot projects.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And in the same way, do huge moonshot data collection efforts in terms of UFOs.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not, it needs to be like 10X, like one or two orders of magnitude more funding.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>To do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I understand on the flip side of that, if you make it about what are the Russians,</p>
<p>whether the Chinese doing, you know, make it a question of geopolitics, it gets touchy.</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;re kind of taken away from the realm of science and&hellip;</p>
<p>Making it military.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest, this is what makes me as an engineer, makes me truly sad that some</p>
<p>of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed Martin, and we will never know about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I wish we were, it was different, but it&rsquo;s the world we live in.</p>
<p>You know, but related to that UIP task force announcement that you just said, you know,</p>
<p>the bill was passed in the Department of Defense and now it formally establishes an office</p>
<p>to collate that information and also to be transparent about it.</p>
<p>Money is now set aside, right?</p>
<p>What do you think of it, just in case people don&rsquo;t know, the DOD establishing new department</p>
<p>to study UFOs called Airborne Naming Command.</p>
<p>But yes, Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group.</p>
<p>Do you know how to pronounce that?</p>
<p>No, I do not.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>AOI MSG.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stupid and needs to be renamed, but&hellip;</p>
<p>AOI MSG.</p>
<p>AO, all right, is directed by the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.</p>
<p>What do you make of this office?</p>
<p>Are you hopeful about this office?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s still a tug of war going on behind the scenes as to who&rsquo;s going to control</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>But I do know, though, that money has been set aside that will be used to make things</p>
<p>more public, right, to start to get others involved.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m involved with an effort to get other academics involved.</p>
<p>So you think there might be some of that money could be directed towards funding maybe like</p>
<p>groups like yours to do some research here.</p>
<p>So they would be open to that, you think?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I mean, nothing is set in stone yet.</p>
<p>So, you know, and I&rsquo;m not hiding anything because I just don&rsquo;t know anything, right.</p>
<p>But I do think that there will be public efforts.</p>
<p>Now, there are being set up other private efforts to bring monies involved and to use</p>
<p>that to leverage and get access to some of the internal resources as well.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re seeing is kind of an ecosystem building up in a positive sense of people</p>
<p>who are willing to do the research.</p>
<p>So, you know, before it would be you couldn&rsquo;t even go to a scientist and ask them to help.</p>
<p>Now, if there&rsquo;s money, as I said before, scientists are essentially capitalists.</p>
<p>We go where the money is.</p>
<p>I mean, the work that I&rsquo;ve done, I did out of my own pocket.</p>
<p>And probably about $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 of money went into the paper we published</p>
<p>out of my own pocket.</p>
<p>But the amount of money that needs to go in is in at least the few millions to do</p>
<p>a proper analysis of these materials.</p>
<p>The work I know that the Galileo project is involved with, it&rsquo;s probably in the, you</p>
<p>know, 5 to 10 million range to get stuff done.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually a relatively modest amount of money to accomplish something that</p>
<p>has been in the zeitgeist for decades.</p>
<p>I should also push back a little bit on something you probably will agree with.</p>
<p>You said scientists are essentially capitalists.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve noticed is there&rsquo;s certainly an influence of money, but oftentimes when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about basic research and basic science, the money is a little bit ambiguous to what</p>
<p>direction you&rsquo;re doing the research in.</p>
<p>And the scientists get really good at telling a narrative of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fulfilling the purpose of this funding, but we&rsquo;re actually, they end up doing really what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re curious about.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And of course you cannot deviate like if you&rsquo;re getting funded to study penguins in Antarctica,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t start building rockets, but probably you can because you will convince some kind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll concoct a narrative saying rockets are really important for studying penguins</p>
<p>in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually, this is one thing I think people don&rsquo;t generally understand</p>
<p>about the scientific mind is I don&rsquo;t know how capitalistic it is because if it was,</p>
<p>they would start an effing company.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I mean, when I meant capitalist, I didn&rsquo;t mean in the, they&rsquo;ll start companies per se.</p>
<p>I mean, we can only do the research where there&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And so from, you know, maybe it&rsquo;s a bad use of the term capitalist.</p>
<p>But we will only do the research where there&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>I mean, why do most people work, many biologists work in cancer?</p>
<p>Uh, work in cancer research because there&rsquo;s a lot of money there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important problem, but I might not have ever gotten involved in it if there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve gone and I was going to be a botanist when I, when I was a kid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Um, so having money available will bring people to bear.</p>
<p>Now, another mistake that&rsquo;s often actually made, I think by the lay public about science</p>
<p>is that people think that we&rsquo;re paid to do things.</p>
<p>Just as you said, I get a research grant and luckily from the NIH there, they give you</p>
<p>a fair amount of latitude.</p>
<p>I will go my own way and I&rsquo;ll find something.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve proposed something, but I&rsquo;ll end up somewhere entirely different by the end</p>
<p>of the project.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how good science is done.</p>
<p>You follow the, you follow the data, you follow the results.</p>
<p>Um, and so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping can be done here.</p>
<p>I think the worst kind of thing that could be done with this subject area is to put it</p>
<p>inside another company where they have a set plan of what it is they&rsquo;re going to do and</p>
<p>the scientists either tell, do what the executives tell them to do or not.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t how anything will really get discovered.</p>
<p>Put it, get it out into the public, get open minds thinking about it and then publishing</p>
<p>on it and doing the right kind of work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how real progress will be made with this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s again, put our sort of philosophical hats on.</p>
<p>Do you think the US government or some other government is in possession of something of</p>
<p>extraterrestrial origin that is far more impressive than anything we&rsquo;ve seen in the public?</p>
<p>If I, I&rsquo;ve not seen anything personally, but if I believe the people who I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>can lie, yes.</p>
<p>This is how does that make you feel in terms of the way government works, the way our human</p>
<p>civilization works, that there might be things like that and we&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not public.</p>
<p>Is, is, is there a hopeful message for transparency that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Like if you were, if you were, uh, in power and I&rsquo;m not saying president because maybe</p>
<p>the president is not the source of power here.</p>
<p>Would you release this information in some way or form?</p>
<p>Yes, if I were, I think it would, I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s something that can bring</p>
<p>humanity together, right?</p>
<p>I think that knowledge of this kind of thing to know that we are, you know, we are more</p>
<p>alike than we are different in comparison to whatever this is, is, uh, is a positive</p>
<p>thing for us.</p>
<p>Um, and to know, you know, I don&rsquo;t necessarily care that the government has been hiding it.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, people who&rsquo;ve been talking about what we should give government</p>
<p>officials or whatever amnesty, I think that&rsquo;s probably the right, the right answer.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, this isn&rsquo;t a time to look back and say, you did something wrong.</p>
<p>You did whatever you did because that was the data you had available to you at the time</p>
<p>and those, you had good reasons for doing it.</p>
<p>Now, if your reasons were selfish, if your reasons where you wanted to do it because</p>
<p>you wanted to monetize it yourself, uh, to the, to your benefit, but against that of</p>
<p>others, then I think maybe there&rsquo;s something else that could be said, but you know, an</p>
<p>opportunity to get all this information out.</p>
<p>If I were in charge, I would, I would try to do it.</p>
<p>Now I might be shown something though that says, there&rsquo;s a reason why you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to let anybody know this.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t want to let anybody know this and maybe you don&rsquo;t want everybody have having</p>
<p>access to unlimited, uh, energy because maybe you might turn it into a bomb or something</p>
<p>that gives you hints that something like unlimited energy is possible, but you haven&rsquo;t figured</p>
<p>it out yet.</p>
<p>And if you make it public, maybe some of the other governments you have tensions with we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>figure it out first.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of an arms race going on, I think in all forms and it&rsquo;s, it makes me</p>
<p>truly sad because, uh, it&rsquo;s obvious that, um, for example, the origins of the COVID</p>
<p>virus, it&rsquo;s obvious to me that the Chinese government, whatever the origins are, is interested</p>
<p>in not releasing information about it because it can only be bad for the Chinese government.</p>
<p>And every government thinks like this, like every, actually this has been disappointment</p>
<p>to me talking to PR folks at companies, like they&rsquo;re always nervous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always like conservative in the sense like, well, if we release more stuff, it can</p>
<p>only be bad.</p>
<p>And then an Elon Musk character comes along who tweets ridiculous memes and doesn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fuck.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been encouraging CEOs, I&rsquo;ve been encouraging people to be transparent.</p>
<p>And of course, government is national security is really like another level as human lives</p>
<p>at stake.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start at the lighter case of just releasing some of the awesome insides of the</p>
<p>tech, how, how the sausages made the technology and being transparent about it because it</p>
<p>excites people.</p>
<p>It uh, like you said, it, it connects people and inspires them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good for the brand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for everybody.</p>
<p>I, I honestly think this kind of idea that people will steal the information and we use</p>
<p>it against you is, um, is an idea that&rsquo;s not true in his idea of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Like you said, some of the benefits of the social media, uh, our, our social world is</p>
<p>that transparency is beneficial and I hope governments will learn that lesson.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re the, usually the last to learn such lessons.</p>
<p>What do you make of Bob Lazar&rsquo;s story in terms of possession of aircraft?</p>
<p>Do you believe him?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the Bob Lazar story to be quite honest.</p>
<p>I mean, I, uh, Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and, uh, has done some,</p>
<p>you know, beautiful, uh, documentaries.</p>
<p>Um, I just don&rsquo;t, I, I don&rsquo;t know how to interpret it.</p>
<p>And um, you know, and again, there&rsquo;s some of the people who I fraternize with think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all rubbish.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, but he, maybe he&rsquo;s right, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, the, the problem is, and um, this is a little bit different about how I approach</p>
<p>the whole area than a lot of others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less interested in going over old paperwork and all these old histories of who said what,</p>
<p>you know, the whole, he said, she said of the history of, of UFOs, I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I worked on the brain area because it&rsquo;s something I can collect data on.</p>
<p>I can go back to the same individual, collect their MRI again and redo it.</p>
<p>I can hand that MRI to somebody else.</p>
<p>They can analyze it.</p>
<p>I can get materials, I can analyze them.</p>
<p>I can get some of these skeletons.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t touch any skeletons ever again, but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce</p>
<p>the data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m good at.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I&rsquo;m, I, I, I&rsquo;m not going to go into the whole, I&rsquo;m not a historian.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a human side to it.</p>
<p>I want, sometimes I think with these, because again, anomalous, rare events, some of the</p>
<p>data is inextricably connected to humans, the observations, I mean, I hope in the future,</p>
<p>you know, that, that, that sensory data will not be polluted by human subjectivity.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s still, that&rsquo;s still powerful data, even direct observations, like if you</p>
<p>talk about pilots.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an interesting question to me, whether Babasar is telling the truth, whether</p>
<p>he believes he&rsquo;s telling the truth too, and what also, what impact his story and stories</p>
<p>like his have on the willingness of governments to be transparent and so on.</p>
<p>So you know, you have to credit his story for captivating the imagination of people</p>
<p>and getting the conversation going.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s maintained his story for all these years with little to no change that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>So but there&rsquo;s so many other people who are, let&rsquo;s say, experts in that story.</p>
<p>Their gut, you know, you accumulate a set of sort of circumstantial evidence where your</p>
<p>gut will say that somebody is not telling the truth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned Avi Loeb, I forgot to ask you about Oumuamua.</p>
<p>You know, because you&rsquo;ve analyzed specimens here on Earth, what do you make of that one?</p>
<p>And what do you make broadly of our efforts to look, look at rocks, essentially, or look</p>
<p>at objects flying around in our solar system?</p>
<p>Is that a valuable pursuit or maybe most of the stories can be, most of the fascinating</p>
<p>things could be discovered here on Earth or on other nearby planets?</p>
<p>Just going to Oumuamua, you know, I think Avi&rsquo;s insight is an interesting speculation,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like I was saying before, people can sometimes look at something and not see it for what</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>Somebody would just look at that and say, oh, it&rsquo;s an asteroid and dismiss it.</p>
<p>There was something odd about the data that Avi picked up on and said, well, here&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alternative explanation that doesn&rsquo;t fit, that actually better fits the models than</p>
<p>it just being a rock, you know.</p>
<p>And to his credit, he just has ignored the critics because he believes the data is real</p>
<p>and is using that then as a battering ram to go after other things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, what is his main conclusion?</p>
<p>Does he say it could be of alien extraterrestrial origin?</p>
<p>Is that his?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one of the things.</p>
<p>I mean, he, you know, he&rsquo;s explained how it could be a light sale.</p>
<p>And a light sale is certainly within near human capabilities to make such a thing.</p>
<p>I think Yuri Milner, he&rsquo;s a Russian billionaire.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s involved, I think, in a project to make light sales with laser, you know, to, to launch</p>
<p>them with laser power, essentially, towards Alpha Centauri, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that humans could make.</p>
<p>I think Avi&rsquo;s proposal is perfectly within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>I mean, sadly, the thing is, you know, now nearly out of our solar system.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s inspiring to do greater levels of data collection in our solar</p>
<p>system, but also here on Earth.</p>
<p>And it just seems like we should be constantly collecting, collecting data because the tools</p>
<p>of software that we&rsquo;re developing get better and better at dealing with huge amounts of</p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing the nature of science, I mean, collect all of the data, right?</p>
<p>Collect the data.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I, the Galileo project asked me over the weekend to join and I did.</p>
<p>So you know, I&rsquo;m not a specialist in any of the stuff that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But you know, in looking at the list of people who are on there, there are really no biologists</p>
<p>on there.</p>
<p>So at, at some point, if my expertise is required for something.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal and the vision of the Galileo project?</p>
<p>Better talk to Avi, but my understanding and just actually looking at the, at the sort</p>
<p>of the bylaws this morning, literally just got them, is number one, collect the data</p>
<p>on UAP.</p>
<p>And number two, collect data on local, potentially local technological artifacts.</p>
<p>I need to look into this.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>And Avi is heading the Galileo project.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you spoken to him?</p>
<p>On this podcast?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That was before, I believe it was before he was headed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Is this a new creation?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The Galileo project was, I think it&rsquo;s about six or seven months old now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s getting a group of scientists together.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Actually, I am, I was looking at some of their stuff over the weekend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shocked at the level of organization that they&rsquo;ve already got put together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It looks like a moonshot project.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been involved with a lot of NIH, large NIH projects, which involve a lot of</p>
<p>people in coordination and they&rsquo;re putting it together.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re extremely well published in a lot of the fields we began this conversation with.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a legit scientist, but yet you&rsquo;re keeping an open mind to a lot of ideas that</p>
<p>maybe require you to take a leap outside of the conventional.</p>
<p>So what advice would you give to young people today that are in high school or in college</p>
<p>that are dreaming of having impact in science or maybe in whatever career path that goes</p>
<p>outside of the conventional that really does something new?</p>
<p>If you believe in something, you believe that an idea is valuable or you haven&rsquo;t approached</p>
<p>something, don&rsquo;t let others shame you into not doing it.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what they</p>
<p>want you to do rather than what you want to do.</p>
<p>So shame sometimes is good to stop you from doing something unethical or wrong, but shame</p>
<p>also is something that is circumscribing your environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never let people who&rsquo;ve told me, you shouldn&rsquo;t do that line of science, you should</p>
<p>be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that, give me a break.</p>
<p>Why is it wrong to ask questions about this area?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with asking the question?</p>
<p>Frankly, you&rsquo;re the person who&rsquo;s wrong for trying to stop these questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the person who&rsquo;s almost acting like a cultist.</p>
<p>You basically have closed your mind to what the possibilities are, and if I&rsquo;m not hurting</p>
<p>anybody, and if it could lead to an advance, and if it&rsquo;s my time, why does it bother you?</p>
<p>I had a very well known scientist once tell me that I was going to hurt my career talking</p>
<p>about this.</p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s enhanced my career.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions on this.</p>
<p>So first of all, just a small comment on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that it feels like a lot of the progress in science is done by people</p>
<p>pursuing an idea that another senior faculty would probably say, this is going to hurt</p>
<p>your career.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually a pretty good indicator that there&rsquo;s something interesting when a</p>
<p>senior wise person tells you this is going to hurt your career.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just the one, as a small, if I were to give advice to young people, if</p>
<p>somebody senior tells you this is going to hurt your career, think twice about taking</p>
<p>their advice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the primary thing.</p>
<p>And the other, I tell my own students, I have a lab of about 20, 30 people and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>that big since 1992.</p>
<p>People come and go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the data that falls in line that&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the spot off the graph that you want to understand.</p>
<p>When something is way off the graph, that&rsquo;s the interesting thing because that&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>where discovery is.</p>
<p>And the number of times that I&rsquo;ve stopped people in my lab and said, wait a second,</p>
<p>go back a few slides.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>And then it ended up being something interesting that made their careers, I could count on</p>
<p>a few hands.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get excited by the extraordinary that&rsquo;s outside of the thing that you&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>Just on a personal psychological level, is there, I&rsquo;m sure at Stanford, I&rsquo;m sure in you</p>
<p>exploring some of these ideas, there&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p>How do you not give in to the pressure?</p>
<p>How do you not give in to the people that push you away from these topics?</p>
<p>What would you say is shame?</p>
<p>I just point to my successes.</p>
<p>I say, you&rsquo;re the ones who told me not to start companies all this time ago.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re the one coming to me for advice for how to start a company.</p>
<p>But from the scientific area, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re wanting to take something off the table that</p>
<p>might be an explanation.</p>
<p>How is that the scientific method?</p>
<p>I reverse shame them.</p>
<p>So purely with reason through conversation, you&rsquo;re able to do that.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t feel, because to me it would just feel lonely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a community of science, and when you&rsquo;re working on something that&rsquo;s outside a particular</p>
<p>conventional way of thinking, it can be lonely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s in the AI field, if you were working on neural networks in the 90s, it could be</p>
<p>lonely.</p>
<p>I have met some of the most fascinating people ever that had I stayed the conventional track,</p>
<p>I would never have met.</p>
<p>Truly brilliant people because of this.</p>
<p>So it is for those worried about, well, should I step outside of my comfort zone?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to meet some really interesting people.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m open about this area, I&rsquo;ll go and give a talk in Boston, Harvard or MIT.</p>
<p>And at dinner, inevitably, this subject comes up.</p>
<p>And inevitably somebody else at the table will admit both that they&rsquo;re interested or</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve seen something.</p>
<p>And suddenly the whole tone of the conversation changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like there&rsquo;s safety in numbers and then, or I&rsquo;ve had people come to me afterwards</p>
<p>after dinner and say, Hey, I don&rsquo;t talk about this openly, but.</p>
<p>So the number of scientists who know that there&rsquo;s something else going on is much larger</p>
<p>than the scientific community would like to think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really powerful one, which is, I don&rsquo;t talk about this openly, but here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I believe.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d be surprised how many people speak like this and hold those beliefs.</p>
<p>And I am optimistic about social media and a more connected world to reveal more and</p>
<p>more, like us not to have these two personalities, we&rsquo;re like this public and private one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned the big questions of the origins of the universe.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing for us humans, our human existence here</p>
<p>on earth, or just at the individual level of a human life?</p>
<p>What Gary is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I think that what we&rsquo;re going through today with this realization, it&rsquo;s kind of like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lived on an island your whole life and you&rsquo;ve looked across the ocean and you&rsquo;ve never imagined</p>
<p>there was another island with anybody else on it.</p>
<p>And then suddenly a ship with sails shows up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand it, but you realize that suddenly your world just got a lot bigger.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in one of those moments right now that our world view, our galactic view</p>
<p>is opening to something a little bit bigger.</p>
<p>And not just that there might be somebody else, but that there&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>And what it is, is yet to be understood.</p>
<p>And the fact that it isn&rsquo;t understood to me is what&rsquo;s exciting because I can fill it with</p>
<p>my dreams.</p>
<p>And this discovery our world might is about to get a lot more humbling and a lot more</p>
<p>fascinating once we look out and realize we were on an island all along.</p>
<p>It makes us both smaller but larger at the same time to me.</p>
<p>You know, I can look outside at the stars and think and imagine what else might be out</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And although I know that I will never see it all, it excites me to know that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Well Gary, both to respect your time and also because at 12 I turned into a princess, let</p>
<p>me just say thank you for doing everything you&rsquo;re doing as a great scientist, as a person</p>
<p>willing to reject the conventional, and thank you for spending your extremely valuable time</p>
<p>with me today.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>It was great talking.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gary Nolan.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Stanislav Lem in Solaris.</p>
<p>How do you expect to communicate with the ocean when we can&rsquo;t even understand one another?</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
