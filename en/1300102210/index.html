<p>think he&rsquo;s that he does a lot of shows and</p>
<p>they they sell out and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so kissing that fans ass he&rsquo;s got he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a nice guy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing a lot of guys like to bag</p>
<p>on the guy for</p>
<p>because when he wanted he was really really</p>
<p>green and new</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t follow</p>
<p>anybody for that yeah he&rsquo;s always been nice to me</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been nice to me too i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen him wants to stand up</p>
<p>and i saw him</p>
<p>i judged the</p>
<p>first last comic</p>
<p>standing and he fucking</p>
<p>crushed you did</p>
<p>the laugh fact that was when</p>
<p>we caught ants</p>
<p>stealing material</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>buddy rocket</p>
<p>screamed at me</p>
<p>right right almost had a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>that was a fucked up</p>
<p>story because this dude aunt was</p>
<p>stealing jokes</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>like book jokes right like</p>
<p>jokes out of movies old</p>
<p>carlin shit</p>
<p>and you know i</p>
<p>complimented him</p>
<p>first and said you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>good performer you got a lot of energy you know but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard that shit before</p>
<p>and then buddy hack it</p>
<p>starts you fucking asshole</p>
<p>who the fuck are you you fucking asshole</p>
<p>my cat just got scared</p>
<p>come here baby come here</p>
<p>she got scared when i use my</p>
<p>buddy hackett voice she gets scared</p>
<p>come here baby</p>
<p>come here you want to be on tv he&rsquo;s not doing more</p>
<p>buddy hack voices um</p>
<p>come here honey</p>
<p>anyway the story was with buddy hackett</p>
<p>when i when i started</p>
<p>when i started saying that this guy was</p>
<p>stealing material</p>
<p>buddy hackett</p>
<p>got really upset because</p>
<p>but you know buddy hackett&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an old school like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a comic from like you know the the catskills days</p>
<p>those guys all stolen their</p>
<p>you know they all did each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s jokes and there was no internet back then</p>
<p>yeah right wasn&rsquo;t even any fucking</p>
<p>tv you had some gags and he did them and nobody knew</p>
<p>yeah and if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do your gags</p>
<p>first you know the guy in</p>
<p>front of you did them</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is a lot of guys</p>
<p>from that era like</p>
<p>bob newhart&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous for the</p>
<p>phone bit yeah</p>
<p>yeah bob new</p>
<p>hearts famous for he&rsquo;s like on the</p>
<p>phone and he&rsquo;ll do one sided</p>
<p>the one sided</p>
<p>phone conversation</p>
<p>hilarious but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of guys from that era who did the same exact</p>
<p>phone bit so well um</p>
<p>anyway wild</p>
<p>he was yelling at me</p>
<p>there was a part of me</p>
<p>that wanted to go shut the fuck up you old cocksucker</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i swap he died two weeks later</p>
<p>wow which means he was real</p>
<p>close to death that</p>
<p>night could have</p>
<p>so if i yelled at him</p>
<p>he might have keeled over and fucking died</p>
<p>right there and it was</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>ten percent</p>
<p>ten percent of me</p>
<p>that was like</p>
<p>why am i listening to this old douchebag because my</p>
<p>philosophy on old people has always been</p>
<p>that old assholes were assholes when they were young</p>
<p>they just survived you know</p>
<p>right you just became an asshole when you turn</p>
<p>eight that guy&rsquo;s a douchebag</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about yelling at him but i said you know what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna help anybody</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point this is all on</p>
<p>television so everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna see this guy&rsquo;s material they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna know what happened so</p>
<p>i did nothing</p>
<p>so here we are with</p>
<p>john hephron</p>
<p>neural linguistic programming freak</p>
<p>john hephron is</p>
<p>recalibrating his mind</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had some very negative</p>
<p>negative patterns that he was following</p>
<p>earlier on in his life</p>
<p>these abandon all those</p>
<p>no more drinking no more bad</p>
<p>stuff john heffron is all about positive energy and</p>
<p>and and tony robbins right well doug</p>
<p>kind of yeah but the tony robbins without the</p>
<p>walking on on fire and going to a seminar with</p>
<p>twenty thousand really</p>
<p>motivated people yeah what is the walking on fire it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably helps you it teaches you to walk on fire</p>
<p>how you would then apply that</p>
<p>skill to other things in your life i have no idea</p>
<p>you know cause even if</p>
<p>you have an argument with your girl you can&rsquo;t go well</p>
<p>i can walk on fire</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t apply to</p>
<p>anything else but walking on fire</p>
<p>right like guys</p>
<p>fighting that bus boards</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s great if</p>
<p>a guy jumps in</p>
<p>front of you with</p>
<p>six boards yeah what&rsquo;s the fucking</p>
<p>point of breaking</p>
<p>boards i don&rsquo;t get that or the</p>
<p>break in the</p>
<p>i guess it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>power in a punch but not well that is if a guy is</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>boards break pretty easy that&rsquo;s a sad</p>
<p>thing those</p>
<p>boards used for demonstrations</p>
<p>outbreak when i as a kid</p>
<p>i can go whenever we used to open up a new school</p>
<p>we would all have to go and do demonstrations and</p>
<p>what part of demonstration was you had to kick boards</p>
<p>break boards so</p>
<p>it was just always seems so silly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>what was i gonna say we</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the newer linguistic stuff oh yeah</p>
<p>so buddy hackett so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing all this programming</p>
<p>and this programming leads to</p>
<p>better performances on stage</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s basically that it just kind of</p>
<p>we rewires your brain everybody</p>
<p>if something happens you probably react</p>
<p>similar in every single situation</p>
<p>so this kind of just change your</p>
<p>brain to maybe take a</p>
<p>the best it gives you options to handle</p>
<p>situations where</p>
<p>you have zero options then you&rsquo;re just gonna freak out</p>
<p>and if you have</p>
<p>a few you usually take the best option for</p>
<p>but it also keeps you from doing</p>
<p>shitty things</p>
<p>right it keeps you from ruining your life</p>
<p>yeah for me</p>
<p>yeah for me what i did is you kind of work</p>
<p>backwards you figure out what you want to accomplish</p>
<p>and then you kind of get all</p>
<p>those feelings</p>
<p>and what it feel like once you accomplish</p>
<p>those and it kind of</p>
<p>let your brain know this is the way i</p>
<p>wanna go this is make</p>
<p>every decision um</p>
<p>in the right way to to obtain that goal</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know some people go well that&rsquo;s all common</p>
<p>sense stuff but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference between</p>
<p>common sense and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s common knowledge or actually</p>
<p>applying it</p>
<p>right but you</p>
<p>apply it now you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>about doing that</p>
<p>right yeah i do before i get on</p>
<p>stage i do some techniques to get me because you know</p>
<p>as stand ups you can get in</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what you travel with guys that</p>
<p>you like but a lot of times i&rsquo;m working with dudes that</p>
<p>bug me yeah you know</p>
<p>problem or material</p>
<p>yeah or whatever so you get in a bad mood for</p>
<p>eight billion different reasons before you get on</p>
<p>stage and then you</p>
<p>enter that stage and you&rsquo;re kind of in a pissy mood</p>
<p>which in that comes across to the</p>
<p>crowd or what i</p>
<p>would do is i</p>
<p>would see a</p>
<p>group of guys let&rsquo;s say and in my head i</p>
<p>would go all</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>gonna heckle</p>
<p>and then i start playing this</p>
<p>movie in my head all they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna heckle</p>
<p>right of my favorite joke</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s gonna wreck that</p>
<p>thing and i</p>
<p>start to go like</p>
<p>literally play</p>
<p>it out as if it happened so then when i got on stage</p>
<p>i was already mad at</p>
<p>these guys that didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>so i take the</p>
<p>stage with a little bit more</p>
<p>testosterone and then that</p>
<p>puts a weird vibe on the</p>
<p>crowd even though those guys</p>
<p>might have not set anything the entire show</p>
<p>but now i do that with</p>
<p>every part of my life and i</p>
<p>think a lot of people do you know you</p>
<p>like oh look at that girl over there i&rsquo;d ask her out</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna say no though</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna say no and make me feel</p>
<p>stupid in front of all</p>
<p>my other friends and blah blah blah</p>
<p>just do the</p>
<p>same there&rsquo;s a lag</p>
<p>there is a definitely a lag because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching us on the video</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally different from what we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like john</p>
<p>still talking on the</p>
<p>video but right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna have that though really</p>
<p>was that because you</p>
<p>streamed gay as fuck it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re live streaming</p>
<p>video you know</p>
<p>is it would it be</p>
<p>better if we were on blog</p>
<p>tv i mean it</p>
<p>what about justin</p>
<p>tv would that be better yeah but</p>
<p>who cares about</p>
<p>what people</p>
<p>watching this care man</p>
<p>is a guy saying lag he&rsquo;s upset</p>
<p>no how did how did</p>
<p>they know there&rsquo;s a lag because he&rsquo;s watching the</p>
<p>video and the sound is different</p>
<p>no no the sound in video is the same is it yeah okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 15 it is a 15</p>
<p>seconds delay</p>
<p>oh how the hell does he know there&rsquo;s a lag then</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>on a slow shitty you got a shitty ass internet</p>
<p>connection faggot</p>
<p>why you blaming us</p>
<p>aol dial up</p>
<p>john heffron</p>
<p>not only is he a</p>
<p>stand up comedian he also hosted the</p>
<p>mma awards this year</p>
<p>which was a total</p>
<p>fucking disaster</p>
<p>really complete</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t say it was a total</p>
<p>the edited version</p>
<p>came out awesome the way you told it to me well</p>
<p>for me for me it was the</p>
<p>check cleared</p>
<p>the check is</p>
<p>clear let&rsquo;s talk yeah the check is</p>
<p>clear but for me</p>
<p>it was where the</p>
<p>people who got to see it on</p>
<p>versus got to see it live</p>
<p>as if it was happening so there was a lot of</p>
<p>shoot this guy this guy sucks</p>
<p>um to those</p>
<p>to me talking</p>
<p>about me hosting</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>those sitting</p>
<p>in the safety of</p>
<p>their computer and being</p>
<p>maybe 15 or 16 years old you</p>
<p>would probably think</p>
<p>that it suck</p>
<p>not realizing that hosting something like oh</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen the</p>
<p>sound if you just have to</p>
<p>press refresh if you</p>
<p>press refresh</p>
<p>your sound and</p>
<p>video should sync up that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming on</p>
<p>some dude said that the</p>
<p>mma awards were lame</p>
<p>well you know what</p>
<p>well i compared to</p>
<p>oh yeah my thing to that lame</p>
<p>lame this is</p>
<p>my thing is</p>
<p>is lame to what</p>
<p>is like is what i don&rsquo;t get is people</p>
<p>compare them and me awards to what the</p>
<p>oscars no no no</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like not interesting to</p>
<p>watch you know it was a</p>
<p>clip show it was</p>
<p>a highlighted</p>
<p>clip show and people got to realize i</p>
<p>think for the</p>
<p>first one in the</p>
<p>budget they had</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you know</p>
<p>guys like you or</p>
<p>kevin j people</p>
<p>always like why is the rogan host why isn&rsquo;t kevin j</p>
<p>like big guys that people know honestly</p>
<p>because they had zero dollars well it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>the hosting</p>
<p>thing i couldn&rsquo;t host</p>
<p>today because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a commentator for the</p>
<p>you see yeah and they wanted to make it non</p>
<p>yeah they wanted some even</p>
<p>though i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m a huge</p>
<p>mma fan and i&rsquo;m as objective as possible</p>
<p>when it comes to</p>
<p>other organizations like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always talking</p>
<p>about theodore</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m always talking</p>
<p>about ioki and all</p>
<p>these different guys who fight</p>
<p>alistar overream</p>
<p>and different guys are</p>
<p>fighting other organizations i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a big believer in you know</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>look at all i mean if you&rsquo;re a fan you have to</p>
<p>like all the different organizations you can&rsquo;t just be</p>
<p>loyal obviously the</p>
<p>ufc&rsquo;s the greatest job i&rsquo;ve ever had and it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>awesome gig and and i</p>
<p>appreciate the hell out of it and i love the job but</p>
<p>as a fan you know you can&rsquo;t just only follow the</p>
<p>fighters and the</p>
<p>fights that are in that organization that&rsquo;s just silly</p>
<p>i love my favorite</p>
<p>thing i tweeted this so i was</p>
<p>watching you do a</p>
<p>commentating</p>
<p>one of the fights i love when you call out an entire</p>
<p>group of twenty thousand people for bullying</p>
<p>because i i get i get mad like</p>
<p>just drunk yeah</p>
<p>the bottom line is that i</p>
<p>understand if they didn&rsquo;t like the decision that makes</p>
<p>sense but once the dude is</p>
<p>talking when they&rsquo;re interviewing the dude boo and him</p>
<p>all he did was like</p>
<p>aaron simpson versus</p>
<p>tom laurel yeah</p>
<p>was the last one</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t boo</p>
<p>aaron simpson</p>
<p>the guy fought his ass off</p>
<p>he got hurt really bad the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>and came back and won the</p>
<p>second and the</p>
<p>third and it was a</p>
<p>really gutty performance</p>
<p>man and it had mad endurance and even in the</p>
<p>third round</p>
<p>he outpaced tom</p>
<p>lawler i mean it was just a</p>
<p>great fight</p>
<p>overall great fight</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know how anybody could have</p>
<p>enjoyed it i mean</p>
<p>i think in situations like that i hate</p>
<p>close decisions</p>
<p>because close decisions like that</p>
<p>man it could have gone either way</p>
<p>and so the fight</p>
<p>really took</p>
<p>place everybody saw what happened</p>
<p>and to decide that one</p>
<p>guy wanted or another guy wanted when it&rsquo;s that close</p>
<p>i would much rather have a draw</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>fight could have easily been a draw</p>
<p>you know a lot of people thought that tom lawler won</p>
<p>which i definitely</p>
<p>think he won the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>aaron simpson won the</p>
<p>second and third</p>
<p>although not in as</p>
<p>large a margin</p>
<p>second very</p>
<p>slight in the</p>
<p>third a little bit more</p>
<p>i think if you looked at it on</p>
<p>paper you could say well</p>
<p>maybe you could give the first</p>
<p>round 10 8 but</p>
<p>the bottom line is</p>
<p>forget about all that the bottom line is it was a</p>
<p>great fight</p>
<p>either guy should feel like a loser</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no way tom waller</p>
<p>should feel like a loser</p>
<p>after that fight</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>aaron simpson</p>
<p>should have got booed i why</p>
<p>anytime i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>alive fight or or you hear the people</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get mad but i love when people start</p>
<p>going you know</p>
<p>start yelling</p>
<p>stand them up when they&rsquo;ve been on the ground for</p>
<p>maybe 35 seconds yeah it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>war if guys</p>
<p>or if guys feel out each</p>
<p>other like i&rsquo;m okay with and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>sparred i mean i sparr</p>
<p>mma is my golf i don&rsquo;t sparr</p>
<p>to really try to</p>
<p>kill anybody i</p>
<p>enjoy the workout of it but even</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>have to fill out a guy you don&rsquo;t just go go and then</p>
<p>start start</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>expect like hockey</p>
<p>fights sometimes</p>
<p>where just erupts immediately</p>
<p>they walk out they go toe to toe</p>
<p>in start well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just that the when the action is</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s so exciting</p>
<p>that people want to keep that part going</p>
<p>and then when it goes to the ground the uneducated fans</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>they get upset but</p>
<p>problem is the</p>
<p>referees in</p>
<p>small towns</p>
<p>like when we go to memphis i don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>small towns memphis isn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>small town but</p>
<p>we go outside of vegas</p>
<p>a lot of times they use</p>
<p>local referees</p>
<p>and these guys they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>too busy they get involved in the action too much</p>
<p>you know fight guys fight guys</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting you know like guys in the</p>
<p>guard he&rsquo;s working as guards</p>
<p>trying for an armbar trying for something</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna stand you up i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing up</p>
<p>what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing up</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>fighting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think most are part of</p>
<p>fighting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think most people realize the difficulty</p>
<p>is i mean just</p>
<p>have somebody your size if not a little bit bigger</p>
<p>lay on top of you</p>
<p>and then stand up from that position</p>
<p>just letting that person just with</p>
<p>their weights and</p>
<p>how hard it is</p>
<p>just to stand up</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>like if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on if i&rsquo;m on my back and you&rsquo;re on top of me and i</p>
<p>and i scramble</p>
<p>and i get it that we both</p>
<p>we stand up together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge feet in itself</p>
<p>it is you know it</p>
<p>maybe not that it</p>
<p>should be that the only</p>
<p>way you should get up is if you got up</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be the referee</p>
<p>stands you up i hate all that shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always said that if</p>
<p>if someone like brock lesnar</p>
<p>can take you down and molest you for five minutes yeah</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s tough shit</p>
<p>tough shit he&rsquo;s got you on your back you gotta find</p>
<p>a way to get back up tp</p>
<p>and if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s five minutes of him</p>
<p>punching you in the face and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and if your technique to</p>
<p>avoid that is to turn</p>
<p>and run in circles so we can&rsquo;t tackle you</p>
<p>then do it then that&rsquo;s it yeah</p>
<p>it is whatever</p>
<p>gets you and</p>
<p>believe me that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna you what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna decide</p>
<p>your career</p>
<p>is gonna be fans</p>
<p>and whether fans like your style</p>
<p>whether or not you sell tickets whether</p>
<p>or not you know you optimize your potential as a</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>and the fans are</p>
<p>gonna let you know whether or not they like your</p>
<p>style and if you got a boring ass</p>
<p>style even if you like winning</p>
<p>fights nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give a shit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna buy your pay per</p>
<p>views and that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s commerce you know that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to work you know it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>let let the</p>
<p>market dictate</p>
<p>what you know whether people</p>
<p>like people or not now i you said you sent a clip the</p>
<p>other day of tag team</p>
<p>but what do you</p>
<p>think the evolution if we were just to pretend the</p>
<p>evolution you</p>
<p>think maybe in</p>
<p>40 years they&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>maybe numchucks on</p>
<p>a hook on the side of the cage</p>
<p>where then no i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not as fun</p>
<p>the fun things</p>
<p>man to man no weapons that&rsquo;s what i mean you</p>
<p>could go to</p>
<p>roman gladiator</p>
<p>style have dudes have</p>
<p>sword fights and they would be</p>
<p>certainly be fucking crazy but</p>
<p>ultimately i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it would be as</p>
<p>enjoyable just be more fucked up</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re champions</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>moto musashi you know musashi</p>
<p>beat 62 men in</p>
<p>sword fights</p>
<p>but unless you&rsquo;re musashi</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get fucking sliced up</p>
<p>you know what sucks</p>
<p>about that tag team idea is half the people probably</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a great idea</p>
<p>no they all came from</p>
<p>wrestling no they don&rsquo;t everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrestling fans that</p>
<p>fulken turd</p>
<p>no go to the</p>
<p>go to the youtube clip that i posted up on tag team mma</p>
<p>every fucking car</p>
<p>what the fuck is this gay shit</p>
<p>now why was this what happened then</p>
<p>what happened from the</p>
<p>transition of wrestling</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s an awesome idea to all</p>
<p>those fans well</p>
<p>wrestling&rsquo;s fake i know but</p>
<p>i mean basically</p>
<p>the real the evolution is war</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like football</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a team of</p>
<p>mma guys on one side of the</p>
<p>field and it&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s true i</p>
<p>never thought you know it</p>
<p>i got a hawk hogan</p>
<p>story for you by the way when we were at the ufc he sat</p>
<p>right in front of me and he has this really</p>
<p>weird hair where it looks like it&rsquo;s a wig almost</p>
<p>but he pulled out a comb and during the ufc the</p>
<p>whole time he was just combing the back of his hair</p>
<p>and like just like kind of go like this like</p>
<p>flipping it over his</p>
<p>shoulder and i was just like</p>
<p>is this really</p>
<p>the hulk hogan that i know he&rsquo;s combing his hair</p>
<p>well he probably</p>
<p>does it like for like it&rsquo;s probably a show</p>
<p>like part of his</p>
<p>image images</p>
<p>you know because i mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly he&rsquo;s always on</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s out in public</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s the hulkster</p>
<p>dude interviewing him was the shit was that yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking awesome man he was really nice guy huh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great guy real nice guy</p>
<p>every interview well not</p>
<p>every interview you&rsquo;ve done i saw you interview</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>fight in the</p>
<p>stands right before you go to talk to them</p>
<p>yeah it happened with a</p>
<p>sylvester stallone</p>
<p>your interview rocky</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>there was a thing</p>
<p>did it happen with hulk</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always like a little moment</p>
<p>right before</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny i</p>
<p>guess or to make it more realistic</p>
<p>maybe you could have cage</p>
<p>fighting or</p>
<p>where you have the two</p>
<p>fighters and then</p>
<p>random people</p>
<p>standing around like a bar fight</p>
<p>so then you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>throwing a punch back in heaven it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be robots</p>
<p>mma in the future no</p>
<p>i got human chimp hybrids</p>
<p>people are gonna like</p>
<p>infuse their body with chimp dna and just</p>
<p>jump over the top of the cage they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be so much stronger and faster</p>
<p>well if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some</p>
<p>definitely there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be genetic engineering in the future</p>
<p>and when genetic engineering becomes a reality</p>
<p>forget about steroids steroids are</p>
<p>gonna be nonsense it&rsquo;s gonna be nothing</p>
<p>when they get jeans</p>
<p>that inhibitors</p>
<p>you know that you ever seen the video of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a couple kids that have been born with</p>
<p>myostat and problems</p>
<p>and what happens is they develop like you</p>
<p>extreme amount of muscle they have</p>
<p>all that like there&rsquo;s whippets</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dog called the whippet</p>
<p>and they they breed</p>
<p>these dogs to try to make them you know fast</p>
<p>to make them</p>
<p>sleek and run fast</p>
<p>and occasionally</p>
<p>they have an error in their genetics and they get</p>
<p>giant muscles</p>
<p>like they look like they don&rsquo;t even really look</p>
<p>photoshop but it&rsquo;s a real dog</p>
<p>like super roided up</p>
<p>shredded and no fat it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve done it already to mice</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve engineered mice</p>
<p>so that these mice</p>
<p>have this mile statin</p>
<p>inhibitor situation</p>
<p>going on and they have giant muscles and they can</p>
<p>they live longer i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all for man i hope all that stuff comes around</p>
<p>right around the time when</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m in my 60s 70s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen man i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna sylvester</p>
<p>still on it</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s everything is</p>
<p>going in a direction where</p>
<p>like science fiction</p>
<p>like the things that we thought of as being</p>
<p>completely ridiculous in the 1980s the</p>
<p>stuff that you would see in a movie</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s all real now</p>
<p>well you know i mean</p>
<p>you see that new microsoft</p>
<p>touch thing</p>
<p>where they have a</p>
<p>table and you can put something on the table</p>
<p>and it recognizes what that</p>
<p>something is and gives you information on it i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like minority</p>
<p>or type shit</p>
<p>i mean this is all</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>i was talking</p>
<p>about that new cell</p>
<p>phone idea that nokia has</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>phone that you&rsquo;re talking and then you flip it on your</p>
<p>wrist when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it turns into jewelry</p>
<p>yeah and it wraps around you yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>those bracelets</p>
<p>those old metal bracelets you used to like flip on your</p>
<p>wrist you know like girls</p>
<p>would have them</p>
<p>and stuff but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cell</p>
<p>phone it&rsquo;s a bendable lcd and they just patented</p>
<p>it the other day</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>what it is they can un straighten it out use it as a</p>
<p>phone and then</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re done you just flip it on your wrist</p>
<p>i saw the they had this what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>neo technology</p>
<p>where they took shark skin</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s all bladed</p>
<p>and they made this suit that&rsquo;s almost unstabbable and</p>
<p>stuff for like soldiers</p>
<p>where you wear</p>
<p>almost like a wetsuit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nothing can get through it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like kevlar kevlar but it&rsquo;s thinner and</p>
<p>stuff than it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been before so you can wear it as a full body</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t stab someone with it</p>
<p>well regular kevlar can be</p>
<p>stabbed straight on here with a</p>
<p>knife you can</p>
<p>get through</p>
<p>kevlar but this is some</p>
<p>shark skin is what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some guy invented he invented it to stop</p>
<p>shark attacks and</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that chain mail</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s like a wetsuit that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>so now they&rsquo;re messing with that</p>
<p>stuff one day they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a real iron man suit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>crazy if they don&rsquo;t already</p>
<p>i mean they got it</p>
<p>or all the guys are</p>
<p>gonna look like halo the dudes from</p>
<p>from halo definitely</p>
<p>all that technology it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like star wars</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a helmet that you pull out so you know</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t breathe the air outside and stuff well</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be that but i</p>
<p>think most of the war is</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>fought like what the cia is doing in pakistan</p>
<p>right now they got</p>
<p>drones and these</p>
<p>drones are flying</p>
<p>over pakistan just launching missiles down on people</p>
<p>the bottom line is that all</p>
<p>things accelerate</p>
<p>no things stay</p>
<p>exactly where they are and the only time they degrass</p>
<p>is when there&rsquo;s a gigantic nostril</p>
<p>natural catastrophe</p>
<p>or you know somebody blows up a</p>
<p>bunch of nuclear weapons and</p>
<p>you know we go back to being fucking cavemen</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>things are gonna decelerate</p>
<p>but the way</p>
<p>things are going right now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>move in a crazy or</p>
<p>crazy direction i mean</p>
<p>faster faster</p>
<p>we went from</p>
<p>from bows and</p>
<p>arrows to guns to cannons to</p>
<p>and it keeps</p>
<p>going and going and going</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>drones that fire missiles from the sky</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s and then</p>
<p>you know like the star wars</p>
<p>program they were trying to do with during the raid</p>
<p>administration</p>
<p>you know they were trying to have it so that they have</p>
<p>satellites that can</p>
<p>shoot down missiles</p>
<p>from space but</p>
<p>apparently that was all bullshit</p>
<p>apparently that</p>
<p>never really worked and</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s a gigantic conspiracy</p>
<p>wrapped around</p>
<p>the scientists</p>
<p>that were involved in the star wars program because</p>
<p>apparently a</p>
<p>fuckload of them have died</p>
<p>under suspicious</p>
<p>causes yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a if you google it</p>
<p>anybody wants to google it we can google it</p>
<p>right now and i&rsquo;ll put up a link for you guys but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if this is a</p>
<p>legit obviously</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legit conspiracy theory</p>
<p>but the star wars scientists</p>
<p>on the side note on</p>
<p>the conspiracy theory</p>
<p>stuff that you talk about is there</p>
<p>one site if you let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a new guy alex jones</p>
<p>infowars com</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>geo marconi scientist</p>
<p>death conspiracy theorist</p>
<p>mystery of the dead scientist conspiracy</p>
<p>hmm wikipedia has</p>
<p>a little page</p>
<p>on between nineteen eighty two and nineteen ninety</p>
<p>twenty five british based</p>
<p>gec marconi</p>
<p>scientists and engineers who work</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s a stingray</p>
<p>oh yeah star wars defense</p>
<p>initiative yeah</p>
<p>um died under mysterious circumstances wow</p>
<p>police investigations</p>
<p>found his death to be unconnected oh no yeah</p>
<p>the same police are</p>
<p>out taser and grandma&rsquo;s and shit is that</p>
<p>is that who did it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>snacks out of the vending machine</p>
<p>star wars is probably how aids was created</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>sites on this i don&rsquo;t even want to link it</p>
<p>because i just</p>
<p>yeah you know what i&rsquo;ll do i&rsquo;ll link the google search</p>
<p>so you do your own work</p>
<p>because who the fuck knows</p>
<p>how many of</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>completely crazy</p>
<p>so i just sent it up there who knows</p>
<p>who knows how many guys are</p>
<p>completely out of the fucking mind and who knows</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s real you know</p>
<p>um star wars was reagan right yeah</p>
<p>well that the reagan administration was famous for</p>
<p>a bunch of secret shit was</p>
<p>going on this is reagan introducing star wars</p>
<p>his announcement of what it was back in the day yeah</p>
<p>what are you showing it</p>
<p>yeah what are you gonna show a</p>
<p>video or something</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that nobody gives a fuck yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put that up okay</p>
<p>star wars it&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>thing why not</p>
<p>we can show people</p>
<p>them introducing star wars because i don&rsquo;t want to put</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it was just a program where they</p>
<p>shot supposedly</p>
<p>had satellites that could shoot down</p>
<p>missiles from</p>
<p>space but apparently it was never functional</p>
<p>never never proven</p>
<p>to be effective</p>
<p>they spent billions and billions of dollars on it</p>
<p>and all these scientists</p>
<p>dying the big theory was that you know</p>
<p>these guys knew too much and they knew that it was</p>
<p>horseshit and</p>
<p>so they had to kill him off before they talked</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t put it past them</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>get the cia involved and if you ever read like economic</p>
<p>confessions of an economic hitman</p>
<p>and you find out the shit that our government does</p>
<p>to other countries</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d kill scientists they&rsquo;d kill anybody</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>you know the same people that</p>
<p>wanted us to go to war in iraq and we&rsquo;re willing to lie</p>
<p>about weapons of mass destruction you know everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and on</p>
<p>about september 11th like</p>
<p>do you really</p>
<p>think the government</p>
<p>would allow</p>
<p>innocent people to die during september 11th so they</p>
<p>could go to war</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but do you really</p>
<p>think they believed</p>
<p>there was weapons of mass destruction do you really</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re over in iraq</p>
<p>and afghanistan for good reasons that benefit you and i</p>
<p>no and millions of people have died because of that</p>
<p>at least a million iraqi</p>
<p>civilians have died because of that and so</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re willing to do that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to kill a few thousand here and there</p>
<p>of course they are</p>
<p>and forget about the few thousand that died</p>
<p>during 9 11</p>
<p>the million people that died in iraq are</p>
<p>human beings they&rsquo;re just as</p>
<p>legitimate as the people that died in the twin towers</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>someone says can we change</p>
<p>topic to something fun</p>
<p>allah be praised is his name</p>
<p>somebody said please look up the</p>
<p>definition of</p>
<p>literally you</p>
<p>you mike and dana</p>
<p>use that word too much and you don&rsquo;t know what it means</p>
<p>oh how do you know what i know</p>
<p>faggot what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>the literal</p>
<p>translation</p>
<p>i know it literally</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>talking to somebody recently who has a joe rogan ufc</p>
<p>drinking game</p>
<p>where god gets rocked no</p>
<p>the button he pre</p>
<p>watched it i forgot what he said he pre</p>
<p>he pre watched</p>
<p>watched it and then bet his friends</p>
<p>bj pen spider</p>
<p>monkey legs</p>
<p>is it turner monkey legs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just kind of a weird random</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever said i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard that i might have said it</p>
<p>we know when you do a hundred</p>
<p>yeah yes i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>might have said that one day and forgot i said it</p>
<p>he does have spider man listen this guy there&rsquo;s no such</p>
<p>thing as a legit conspiracy theory</p>
<p>okay smart man</p>
<p>like you fucking</p>
<p>know how funnier people there&rsquo;s no such</p>
<p>thing as real conspiracy theory</p>
<p>of course there are stupid</p>
<p>look up the gulf of</p>
<p>tonkin the gulf of</p>
<p>tonkin incident is</p>
<p>a real conspiracy theory</p>
<p>where the government really did lie</p>
<p>and say that there was an attack</p>
<p>on american</p>
<p>citizens and that&rsquo;s what got us into the vietnam war</p>
<p>look up the</p>
<p>look up the</p>
<p>northwoods document the</p>
<p>northwoods document is a real conspiracy</p>
<p>that the joint</p>
<p>chiefs of staff</p>
<p>drafted up and signed</p>
<p>and then it was</p>
<p>vetoed by kennedy</p>
<p>and what it was was</p>
<p>basically they were trying to get people enthusiastic</p>
<p>about a war with cuba</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna plan attacks on american</p>
<p>civilians they were</p>
<p>gonna blow up an airliner</p>
<p>and blame it on cuba</p>
<p>and say that americans were on</p>
<p>board they were</p>
<p>gonna attack</p>
<p>ships they were</p>
<p>gonna attack guantanamo bay</p>
<p>they were gonna</p>
<p>throw mortars into</p>
<p>guantanamo bay and they were</p>
<p>ready for us casualties</p>
<p>which meant they were willing to kill americans</p>
<p>in order to get us to go to war with cuba</p>
<p>these are real</p>
<p>they look up</p>
<p>how about fucking cigarettes</p>
<p>you want a real conspiracy</p>
<p>theory how come politicians all want to talk</p>
<p>about drugs and we need to keep drugs out of schools</p>
<p>drugs in this country can&rsquo;t even fucking come</p>
<p>close to the</p>
<p>death and destruction the health problems that</p>
<p>cigarettes have</p>
<p>caused but yet</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t hear a fucking</p>
<p>peep out of those guys</p>
<p>about cigarettes</p>
<p>cigarettes kill four hundred thousand people a year</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>alone every fucking year</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>legit conspiracy</p>
<p>where no one is talking</p>
<p>about it and the reason why they&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about it is because</p>
<p>tobacco companies</p>
<p>finance campaigns of politicians</p>
<p>those are conspiracies what</p>
<p>a conspiracy is is someone conspires to do something</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hundreds of</p>
<p>legit conspiracies look up</p>
<p>the iran contra affair look up the fact that oliver</p>
<p>north and all</p>
<p>those guys were involved in doing illegal shit</p>
<p>in order to help to bring in</p>
<p>i just want to see</p>
<p>where they bring cocaine</p>
<p>into the us well that&rsquo;s the accusation and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of books that have been written</p>
<p>and cia agents</p>
<p>who have said that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy named</p>
<p>gary webb who&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>bunch of shit on that and there was a dude</p>
<p>named barry seal who actually was</p>
<p>bringing in cocaine from other</p>
<p>countries got caught</p>
<p>and when he was</p>
<p>about to go to</p>
<p>trial was murdered</p>
<p>and that was to go they</p>
<p>bringing coke from</p>
<p>those like afghanistan type</p>
<p>countries to help support them</p>
<p>to fight the russian yeah and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another one is you know people say oh man the cia</p>
<p>is good they help us and</p>
<p>sure some cia</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure do that but the cia</p>
<p>one of the one of the</p>
<p>planes that&rsquo;s been to guantanamo bay</p>
<p>crashed last year</p>
<p>in mexico with four tons of cocaine</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna put up that link yeah and</p>
<p>it did even fucking make the news man it make reuters</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t make any of the the</p>
<p>big news programs i&rsquo;ll put up that link for you guys</p>
<p>but this is a fucking cia plane</p>
<p>like rupert was the la cop that busted that yeah</p>
<p>yeah that especially on hbo</p>
<p>some the two because there were two</p>
<p>black dudes that were the ones</p>
<p>that all funneled through yeah</p>
<p>the bottom line</p>
<p>about human beings though</p>
<p>is that people</p>
<p>are so lack of days ago when it comes to shed</p>
<p>it just so they</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could that stuff</p>
<p>could be on the news and people</p>
<p>would care more</p>
<p>about john kate you know</p>
<p>john has to pay 10 000</p>
<p>a month and</p>
<p>child support and alimony</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s he gonna do it</p>
<p>and that would be big news</p>
<p>whereas people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give a fuck about</p>
<p>you know the cia</p>
<p>selling drugs they would</p>
<p>all you have to do is have one person on</p>
<p>television say it&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all the i mean that&rsquo;s all you need to get 90</p>
<p>of people to believe it</p>
<p>and a lot of</p>
<p>those shows a lot of the news ones</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that&rsquo;s what they do for a living</p>
<p>they say they can put</p>
<p>their name in a database to be an expert</p>
<p>about whatever</p>
<p>and then cnn or</p>
<p>we need a guy that knows</p>
<p>about and then you&rsquo;re the expert on</p>
<p>drug injection</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>proven that</p>
<p>oil companies have hired scientists to dispute</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>human beings have created global warming</p>
<p>you know who the fuck knows whether or not they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right or wrong when it comes global</p>
<p>warming and most people that</p>
<p>argue it they</p>
<p>argue from the</p>
<p>point of being a conservative or being a liberal</p>
<p>liberals always say we have to stop and</p>
<p>conservatives say there&rsquo;s no connection</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just because they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking parents</p>
<p>to hear you know all</p>
<p>these different people rush limbaugh or whoever on the</p>
<p>radio saying that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>connection that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>these silly liberals</p>
<p>and they just repeat the same dumb shit</p>
<p>and conservatives</p>
<p>do that and then</p>
<p>liberals they</p>
<p>see that fucking al gore cocksucker and they go al</p>
<p>gore said that</p>
<p>meanwhile al</p>
<p>gore&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>a billion dollars off of this fucking climate gate</p>
<p>if you look at like what al gore has made the</p>
<p>money that al gore has made</p>
<p>since an inconvenient</p>
<p>truth came out it&rsquo;s fucking staggering</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s made an incredible amount of</p>
<p>money off of this</p>
<p>and the people that</p>
<p>would benefit from all</p>
<p>these carbon taxes</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re setting this up to make</p>
<p>money and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing no one&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a few scientists are doing with the</p>
<p>right intentions</p>
<p>but most the</p>
<p>politicians that are pushing this they have</p>
<p>ulterior motives</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>money off of this shit</p>
<p>hey joe rogan did you hear</p>
<p>johnny bananas</p>
<p>twenty one at gmail com says</p>
<p>did you hear that the y</p>
<p>chromosome is evolving faster than the x chromosome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cause we&rsquo;re men bitch</p>
<p>johnny bananas we&rsquo;re the only ones with the why</p>
<p>the women don&rsquo;t get the why the why is the future</p>
<p>i just saw i just saw a documentary about that</p>
<p>that males are disappearing</p>
<p>with because of all the chemicals yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why guys act more girlish now if you look at</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a surplus of men</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a surplus of men rather men</p>
<p>act more aggressive</p>
<p>and grow more facial hair and become more masculine</p>
<p>and have more testosterone</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a surplus of women</p>
<p>men tend to</p>
<p>relax and they tend to be more</p>
<p>feminine and they tend to shave</p>
<p>more and be more</p>
<p>metrosexual</p>
<p>yeah this one was</p>
<p>about that all the chemicals</p>
<p>that probably our parents or our parents parents did</p>
<p>in the 60s all the plastics and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>where they said</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t bad for you</p>
<p>now they realized it is and for some reason that</p>
<p>those chemicals</p>
<p>affect men more</p>
<p>like they found</p>
<p>these alligators that live by let&rsquo;s say dow</p>
<p>in in the in the</p>
<p>swamps had smaller balls</p>
<p>than alligators</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>generations</p>
<p>earlier that all</p>
<p>those chemicals were</p>
<p>shrinking the alligator balls i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what job you have that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your guy that</p>
<p>you know one guy goes i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna measure it</p>
<p>alligator balls yeah you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna measure it and we</p>
<p>might need this data</p>
<p>later but that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they say is just from all the chemicals and stuff</p>
<p>that men are acting less like men and producing more</p>
<p>sperm i think in the</p>
<p>more sperm and less</p>
<p>no less sperm like so</p>
<p>young guys now have less</p>
<p>sperm than their dads probably have</p>
<p>which it should be</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the internet</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re getting rid of more</p>
<p>sperm than our dads</p>
<p>huh because we&rsquo;re jerking off</p>
<p>dad did you think jab</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>take off with</p>
<p>i bet it&rsquo;s very much more difficult for your dad to be</p>
<p>obsessive about masturbation</p>
<p>because they used to have to set up a projector</p>
<p>pull the shades down</p>
<p>screen run at little 16</p>
<p>millimeter or some</p>
<p>black and white old lady or go</p>
<p>less molestation nowadays to</p>
<p>i wonder what the odds are</p>
<p>it actually goes or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s down i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s down you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think or go</p>
<p>even back further than that that was guys had to put up</p>
<p>the projector but even go the guys before that had to</p>
<p>paint stuff on walls and caves and</p>
<p>and then you know there&rsquo;s way more</p>
<p>people now there&rsquo;s way more people</p>
<p>now so there&rsquo;s way more molestation but per capita</p>
<p>yeah i wonder i wonder</p>
<p>well you know the japanese</p>
<p>believe the japanese believe that if you show all</p>
<p>that shit you show rape and molestation and crazy sex</p>
<p>you know like that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>school girls on that shit</p>
<p>they feel like that it gets it out of your system</p>
<p>that if you</p>
<p>watch like violence</p>
<p>in in video and</p>
<p>movie form that somehow another gets it out of your</p>
<p>system why do they blur</p>
<p>all their porn now</p>
<p>they only blur the pubes</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird very weird</p>
<p>wait you&rsquo;re allowed to get fucked by a tentacle</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see it you can see</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you see</p>
<p>pussy or do not know the</p>
<p>whole things but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>whole pussy that bad</p>
<p>witness reload</p>
<p>but if you squint</p>
<p>like in the old days in the news if you squint you</p>
<p>could see the stuff</p>
<p>and then i find myself like squinting</p>
<p>going there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other porn that i</p>
<p>could be watching that&rsquo;s way more</p>
<p>like that old old</p>
<p>school kind of french</p>
<p>kind of european porn</p>
<p>yeah do you remember</p>
<p>when you were</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the old days when you</p>
<p>would go on the road</p>
<p>and you go to</p>
<p>hotel rooms</p>
<p>and the dirty</p>
<p>movies would be scrambled</p>
<p>yeah but they</p>
<p>would only be like wiggly</p>
<p>yeah you could almost</p>
<p>through them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see like a tit</p>
<p>you see like a</p>
<p>dick that would go in a</p>
<p>mouth and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have enough to jerk off to you used to be able to those</p>
<p>used to be able to get like a</p>
<p>three or four</p>
<p>minute preview</p>
<p>to see if you wanted so you&rsquo;d have ten and</p>
<p>yeah yeah you hit the</p>
<p>second preview i was</p>
<p>proud of myself</p>
<p>would get hard</p>
<p>and then as the preview was</p>
<p>going i would be done</p>
<p>15 seconds or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird with the vhs like if you borrow</p>
<p>porn from somebody you</p>
<p>could see like what their</p>
<p>thing was because we</p>
<p>you put it in and hit play</p>
<p>whatever scene you know that they just hit stop</p>
<p>after they were done</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re like really that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>did someone have a bit about that</p>
<p>chris rock had a bit</p>
<p>about that about</p>
<p>how he went</p>
<p>turned out one of his porns</p>
<p>and he had left it a certain scene</p>
<p>but then because of the vhs tape</p>
<p>then we went to it the next time</p>
<p>it was a different</p>
<p>scene it&rsquo;s like someone&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>watching my show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>so true right</p>
<p>that was yeah</p>
<p>i remember i remember renting vcrs this is like</p>
<p>eighteen and then</p>
<p>leave it in there when you take it back or something</p>
<p>or you rip off of the</p>

<p>would go to the library and rent a</p>
<p>movie projector just to show like</p>

<p>john hephron&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>loser i should have should</p>
<p>or scam jonathan scam</p>
<p>because you always see</p>
<p>those at the</p>
<p>first whatever</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re looking you always see the word</p>
<p>scam at the top and then when you</p>
<p>click on whatever it is</p>
<p>it just pro</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>cause i think</p>
<p>naturally if you&rsquo;re looking to buy something yeah</p>
<p>you see the</p>
<p>scam you&rsquo;re like well i&rsquo;ll go to the negative first</p>
<p>oh some dude said it was doug stanhope&rsquo;s bit</p>
<p>about his mom with the porno</p>
<p>that makes sense</p>
<p>that makes sense you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful there&rsquo;s a company called ripoff report</p>
<p>and this is like i don&rsquo;t know how this is</p>
<p>legal at all</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mad at your company or something like that</p>
<p>they can put something on there</p>
<p>and what this company does is it uses</p>
<p>spam techniques where</p>
<p>it spams like message</p>
<p>boards and all this shit</p>
<p>all day long so google puts it on the top of your list</p>
<p>so my friend has a fashion company that does like</p>
<p>dresses and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>thing that comes up when you google is rip off report</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s ripping you off and blah blah blah</p>
<p>and michelle</p>
<p>my friends like how do i get rid of this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like well if you give us 2 000</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take it off it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what yeah that seems</p>
<p>like hold on a</p>
<p>second so the company that</p>
<p>reports on people for scams they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically just extorting people yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called ripoff report and the</p>
<p>funny thing is you</p>
<p>can pay them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll take it down they&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>your name off of it</p>
<p>holy shark ripoffreport com</p>
<p>and it seems like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legit company so if you have a problem with</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s business or something like that</p>
<p>you can say</p>
<p>you the right</p>
<p>layer like this person ripped me off and</p>
<p>stuff like that that&rsquo;s extortion</p>
<p>how is that is</p>
<p>extortion and if you go online there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people suing this company there&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>twelve different lawsuits</p>
<p>going on for this company</p>
<p>right now but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been trying</p>
<p>everything to get this shit off like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she was on tv the</p>
<p>other day doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>still first</p>
<p>thing you google her name it comes up</p>
<p>what is her name</p>
<p>michelle wendell</p>
<p>m i c h e l l e</p>
<p>wendell w e n</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somebody like that i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>successful but either way</p>
<p>people like it don&rsquo;t have ripoff report</p>
<p>wow don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>money to go</p>
<p>after her to go after them</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s pretty expensive</p>
<p>i mean i was</p>
<p>going to sue</p>
<p>a company recently</p>
<p>and it was just it</p>
<p>ended up being just so much money</p>
<p>that you had to go well do i want to use that just to</p>
<p>say that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right yeah or do you just save you know</p>
<p>both of those</p>
<p>people are ex employees too that</p>
<p>wrote those things</p>
<p>really she fired</p>
<p>yeah it seems like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be some kind of like libel</p>
<p>or something yeah well they&rsquo;re getting sued but i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay thanks but the whole</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s weird about it is is that it&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>chicks online</p>
<p>and some dude was posing as a</p>
<p>maximal and scam</p>
<p>fifteen thousand dollars out of some doctor in florida</p>
<p>send pictures</p>
<p>photoshop naked</p>

<p>voice like a really</p>
<p>feminine voice</p>

<p>but it&rsquo;s fascinating how fucking</p>
<p>gullible dudes are like how the fuck do you not know</p>
<p>did you put up the link to somebody wanted to know</p>
<p>about the what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about earlier with the mice</p>

<p>bad and then won&rsquo;t do any for like a day or two yeah</p>
<p>now i but then i realize</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s following a lot of people so it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>annoying right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird how like it&rsquo;s so different like myspace</p>
<p>i had no problem getting</p>
<p>frames you know like on</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>but twitter people are a little bit more</p>
<p>picky because they have to read your shit every day</p>
<p>say that again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different how like twitter like</p>
<p>some people are huge on twitter you know you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they are like twitter makes no</p>
<p>sense to me like numbers why you</p>

<p>magazines and he goes on cnn and he talks</p>
<p>about his twitter on cnn and yeah so does</p>
<p>larry king every day but he&rsquo;s not even a quarter</p>

<p>global thermal news</p>
<p>is only 31 years old shazam</p>
<p>these bitches know what time</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how often do i get pwned pw how do you say pwned</p>
<p>in real life pw and eb</p>
<p>someone wants to know how often how often i get tapped</p>
<p>i get tapped at least every month at</p>
<p>least once a month last month i got tapped one two</p>
<p>three times i got tapped</p>
<p>three times last month</p>
<p>and those cuz</p>
<p>moving back to la from</p>
<p>colorado i wasn&rsquo;t i was out of shape and</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t training that much</p>
<p>and you know you roll with good guys you get tapped</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>when you roll like</p>
<p>after the first guy your first guy you know you</p>
<p>drill the way we do it at 10th planet is</p>
<p>you drill for the first half hour 40 minutes</p>
<p>and that gets you</p>
<p>tired but you know you still have good energy but then</p>
<p>the first roll</p>
<p>you have full energy you know the</p>
<p>first roll you feel great but if you roll with a</p>
<p>tough guy and everybody attends planet i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re rolling with</p>
<p>brown belts and purple belts all those dudes are</p>
<p>tough all those</p>
<p>dudes are capable of tapping you out and then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a matter of how much endurance you have because if you</p>
<p>you know you put yourself in bad positions you know</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re pulling</p>
<p>guard all the</p>
<p>time because i&rsquo;m trying to work on my bottom game what</p>
<p>i try to work on my guard</p>
<p>and if you do you get tapped i get tapped</p>
<p>shit i get tapped all the time once a month</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get tapped you either not rolling with good people</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not trying you&rsquo;re not opening yourself up</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t open your game up</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t improve</p>
<p>you gotta you gotta</p>
<p>first of all if i just wanted to get on top all the</p>
<p>time and always hold position and not take any chances</p>
<p>you could go a year without getting tapped but</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>learn and you want to develop your game you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about being tapped</p>
<p>when you get tapped you</p>
<p>gotta go okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one more way that i won&rsquo;t get out my friend</p>
<p>scott got me in this</p>

<p>about its use</p>
<p>one issue in particular</p>
<p>should children</p>
<p>take it to share calvin here with an incredible</p>
<p>story about one family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fight for their son sheriff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right michael and victoria when you say that it</p>
<p>sounds so shocking to so many but</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s prop two fifteen</p>
<p>the compassionate</p>
<p>us act was passed by voters a decade ago</p>
<p>and it does</p>
<p>allow seriously</p>
<p>ill patients with a doctor&rsquo;s recommendation</p>
<p>to use marijuana legally but</p>
<p>what about for children</p>
<p>we did find this one family with a</p>
<p>truly remarkable tale to tell us in this ktla</p>
<p>exclusive report</p>
<p>can you tell me what school&rsquo;s like for you sam</p>
<p>titanic penguin</p>
<p>this is sam</p>
<p>a ten year old who lives with his dad his mom and his</p>
<p>sister lucy in northern california</p>
<p>sam has autism</p>
<p>no no sam from age two till</p>
<p>eight sam&rsquo;s disorder made him violent and</p>
<p>aggressive his parents</p>
<p>steve and angela were truly living a nightmare</p>
<p>every day he got to a point where he was</p>
<p>hurting other children at school and in public</p>
<p>places last times would be um</p>
<p>stay in line at a</p>
<p>store and he would just</p>
<p>instantly just bolt off and go and hit another</p>
<p>child in the face one time he pulled the tv down um he</p>
<p>knocked over all the furniture i mean and i got</p>
<p>and i had to put him in a hold for</p>
<p>maybe an hour i mean just</p>
<p>where his whole body was</p>
<p>spasming it was just</p>
<p>and i was just lay there crying just holding</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s parents worked with</p>
<p>expert doctors who recommended a</p>
<p>succession of conventional prescription</p>
<p>medications like</p>
<p>whisper doll and a host of others</p>
<p>but sam just gained</p>
<p>twenty pounds and</p>
<p>became harder to handle</p>
<p>we were so scared we were like okay</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting more dangerous he&rsquo;s getting bigger and</p>
<p>stronger now that he&rsquo;s twenty</p>
<p>pounds bigger from the respirator</p>
<p>the child that we had</p>
<p>grown to love</p>
<p>was gone it was</p>
<p>just like when you looked at him when you talked to him</p>
<p>he had just disappeared</p>
<p>yeah finally at</p>
<p>their wits end and faced with</p>
<p>a very real prospect of needing to institutionalize</p>
<p>their son sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>parents decided to try something unconventional and</p>
<p>controversial</p>
<p>last year they</p>
<p>began treating sam</p>
<p>with medical marijuana</p>
<p>you think about it it really is the perfect</p>
<p>medication for</p>
<p>that kind of behavior it&rsquo;s just very calming</p>
<p>so this is the</p>
<p>medicine right here</p>
<p>steve and angela got a recommendation</p>
<p>from a medical cannabis doctor they told sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pediatrician</p>
<p>about their plan</p>
<p>and steve grew sam&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>medicine in</p>
<p>their backyard</p>
<p>we had six plants</p>
<p>here this is where</p>
<p>steve took out his tomato</p>
<p>plants to grow</p>
<p>and then harvest</p>
<p>the cannabis</p>
<p>from the marijuana flowers he could make</p>
<p>concentrated form</p>
<p>what people</p>
<p>refer to as hash this ball represents</p>
<p>roughly four</p>
<p>months of doses for sam</p>
<p>so i just take my lighter</p>
<p>steve softens the cannabis with heat</p>
<p>then takes what appears to be just a</p>
<p>check of pot</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s dose for the day what</p>
<p>effects did</p>
<p>the medical cannabis have on sam</p>
<p>well the first time we did it</p>
<p>we just wanted to do</p>
<p>um to see if it</p>
<p>would work at all and</p>
<p>it was just an amazing</p>
<p>experience and i can&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget it</p>
<p>to watch what</p>
<p>happened to him it was just like wow he&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>this anguish</p>
<p>and this pinto</p>
<p>bridge and this</p>
<p>you know obsessiveness</p>
<p>it just like it just went away</p>
<p>just like it just calmed him down</p>
<p>while we were with the family we watched</p>
<p>steve put sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daily dose in a</p>
<p>piece of melon</p>
<p>and take it to him</p>
<p>you swallow that for us</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>shut up buddy</p>
<p>yeah within roughly</p>
<p>twenty minutes the effects were clear</p>
<p>where earlier sam had been animated in ancy</p>
<p>after eating his speck of hash</p>
<p>sam became calm relaxed and social</p>
<p>as a mother</p>
<p>how would you feel</p>
<p>about people saying to you that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting your son</p>
<p>stoned everyday</p>
<p>at first i was very concerned</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>recently i&rsquo;ve been sharing the</p>
<p>story with more</p>
<p>and more people you know friends and co workers and</p>
<p>i find that you know the more i tell people the more i</p>
<p>share with people</p>
<p>the more comfortable i am with it it has</p>
<p>saved our lives and i</p>
<p>think about what it&rsquo;s done for our son</p>
<p>could sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story help others</p>
<p>respected la area</p>
<p>pediatrician</p>
<p>christopher tolsher says we don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about cannabis for kids</p>
<p>for all the</p>
<p>parents out there whose children may have autism</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>message here is that this is intriguing information</p>
<p>that needs more research</p>
<p>before we can confidently say</p>
<p>that marijuana is a safe and effective</p>
<p>treatment for autism</p>
<p>complications</p>
<p>but for this california family medical marijuana has</p>
<p>literally been an answer to their prayers</p>
<p>and a homecoming for their son it was just</p>
<p>um a medication that we saw that</p>
<p>gave us the results that we were always hoping for</p>
<p>i mean i think that really is a key is that he was</p>
<p>happy again he was smiling and laughing</p>
<p>and we had lost that for so long and it was so sad</p>
<p>because we never see it again</p>
<p>it just feels like i have more control</p>
<p>now to help my son instead of depending on doctors who</p>
<p>may have the best intention but</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what sam means</p>
<p>i wanna do what&rsquo;s best for my son</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll do whatever i can for him</p>
<p>well one important note sam&rsquo;s parents tell us that</p>
<p>they have followed the letter of the law regarding his</p>
<p>medication and that they&rsquo;ve grown</p>
<p>only the amount of marijuana that prop</p>
<p>2 15 allows</p>
<p>the medication is for sam</p>
<p>and for nobody else</p>
<p>no sharon does he take this medication</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>started off</p>
<p>at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning he</p>
<p>would take it then they</p>
<p>would give him a</p>
<p>second dose in the afternoon but</p>
<p>after two years he</p>
<p>started this at</p>
<p>eight he&rsquo;s now ten</p>
<p>they sometimes don&rsquo;t have to give it to him</p>
<p>and only give it to him as needed</p>
<p>which is incredible</p>
<p>it really has</p>
<p>changed his behavior</p>
<p>according to them</p>
<p>wow alright</p>
<p>share terrific</p>
<p>story thank you for the report</p>

<p>academy of pediatrics</p>
<p>i want to party with that kid so</p>
<p>last night dr drew is on</p>
<p>and he was talking</p>
<p>about marijuana and how</p>
<p>he was just so he just always on</p>
<p>fight that he&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like what they&rsquo;re just dumb people yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so silly</p>
<p>about his take on marijuana the fight what</p>
<p>the fight medical</p>
<p>marijuana people that want medical marijuana he</p>
<p>thinks they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>silly and they&rsquo;re ruining america and he</p>
<p>thinks that all drugs are bad and that the one</p>
<p>state of mind that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>currently in is the only one</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know you have to ask him but</p>
<p>what he says</p>
<p>about marijuana is</p>
<p>ridiculous because</p>

<p>my kids a ass</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>proof that it&rsquo;s not addictive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>my argument</p>
<p>about it is like anything</p>
<p>could be addictive you can get</p>
<p>addicted to cheeseburgers if you&rsquo;re a fucking retard</p>
<p>you could be one of</p>
<p>those dudes who gets addicted to washing his hands</p>
<p>you know people become compulsive</p>
<p>about shit gt gt</p>
<p>perfect example</p>
<p>people get addicted to</p>
<p>things man it&rsquo;s what we do it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t have the things if</p>
<p>other people are telling you they benefit from it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>stupid about this</p>
<p>whole marijuana</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s no heroin</p>
<p>activists there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no crystal meth</p>
<p>activists it was like you&rsquo;ve got to get on crystal meth</p>
<p>but people keep telling you</p>
<p>that weed has enhanced</p>
<p>their lives and helped the way they</p>
<p>think and made them a better person</p>
<p>and that fuck</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to believe that dude in the article on</p>
<p>what was that commerce magazine</p>
<p>fortune fortune</p>
<p>magazine yeah</p>
<p>the one dude was in the case the</p>
<p>first like six people case study</p>
<p>he said he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gotten high off pocket</p>
<p>but he smokes it constantly</p>
<p>all day long all it helps is with his like arthritis</p>
<p>or whatever it is well we say</p>
<p>barbecued if you keep</p>
<p>going yeah if you</p>
<p>then he realized that his friends were telling</p>
<p>you string just stopped our recording for some reason</p>
<p>all right man probably</p>
<p>the fucking man</p>
<p>the man ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>refresh your browsers people</p>
<p>the man apparently was just fucking our ass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy like it just went off air and then</p>
<p>everything came back on by itself</p>
<p>yeah he took it with his</p>
<p>friends as you want to be a downer because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>taken yeah this is you told a</p>
<p>story and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>focus i got</p>
<p>fuck it but he didn&rsquo;t feel anything so you&rsquo;re like all</p>
<p>right but then he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to like be the one left out so he&rsquo;s like fuck i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>smoke with you guys</p>
<p>just he passed it and he was like take some</p>
<p>and then he realized</p>
<p>he could for the</p>
<p>first time like years and years he</p>
<p>could actually sit there with</p>
<p>those legs and arms like</p>
<p>what about sean rouse</p>
<p>maybe could help him i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that guy does not</p>
<p>smoke pot no</p>
<p>no that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke weed you</p>
<p>would think that doug would</p>
<p>smoke weed stanhope does not like weed</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done mushrooms</p>
<p>of stanhope we did dmt</p>
<p>now we know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go to other dimensions why</p>
<p>does he do it is like pop makes a paranoid</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t like i</p>
<p>understand that that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a side effects of everything for everybody</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>what the paranoia that pot gives</p>
<p>you is really it&rsquo;s almost like the opposite of alcohol</p>
<p>because alcohol makes you look through a tube and</p>
<p>alcohol you like looking at the</p>
<p>world through yeah whoo</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeing but</p>
<p>marijuana is the opposite marijuana like</p>
<p>blinders yeah</p>
<p>i see it in</p>
<p>front of me brian</p>
<p>it went off and brought</p>
<p>on for a second it blift</p>
<p>did it yeah</p>
<p>just so you guys know it&rsquo;s not me fucking it up you</p>
<p>streams just fucking up</p>
<p>right now if you can&rsquo;t see red band</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>sticking his</p>
<p>cock into the</p>
<p>computer you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame brian</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen don&rsquo;t be mean</p>
<p>this is difficult to figure all the</p>
<p>stupid shit out</p>
<p>ultimately i</p>
<p>would love to have this on my website on joerogand</p>
<p>net but right now i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the technology is available</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not quite ready</p>
<p>but this is</p>
<p>ideally the best way to do a show</p>
<p>you know this is way more fun than doing some</p>
<p>some show that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>television that nobody gives a shit about</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>this is we could do</p>
<p>whatever the fuck we want you don&rsquo;t have to look at it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want anything from you you know</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s getting paid</p>
<p>just for fun</p>
<p>you know you have interesting people over and you talk</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>like how many times have you done what&rsquo;s the matter bro</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all blaming me so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get my hands up</p>
<p>who you blaming</p>
<p>i read brian on this and the conan situation how many</p>
<p>times have you done like</p>
<p>a talk show</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you prepare for it it&rsquo;s like a big deal and then</p>
<p>you sit down and you talk to someone for like</p>
<p>seven minutes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like i didn&rsquo;t even say anything</p>
<p>do we get to talk</p>
<p>about anything i mean i had a few</p>
<p>topics that kind of got out of the way a little bit but</p>
<p>nearly said anything and then</p>
<p>and every one of</p>
<p>those shows are</p>
<p>set up for that reason that it&rsquo;s just nothing you just</p>
<p>leave they&rsquo;re going i</p>
<p>that was nothing</p>
<p>anything i didn&rsquo;t even yeah and then</p>
<p>two words it&rsquo;s like you if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>chelsea handler show yeah</p>
<p>those guys on there say like</p>
<p>four or five words that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it and then you&rsquo;re done yeah and then they&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>weird and if people go oh you were</p>
<p>great and but that&rsquo;s what they want</p>
<p>short attention span</p>
<p>bing bang see this guy real quick</p>
<p>but i mean but that&rsquo;s the if you want to go for like</p>
<p>if you want to go for like the average you know</p>
<p>just a shot in the dark with people that&rsquo;s the what you</p>
<p>should give them</p>
<p>you should give them the shortest</p>
<p>quickest little things</p>
<p>as fast as you</p>
<p>can so they don&rsquo;t lose interest or so but at</p>
<p>the end of the day</p>
<p>do you want the people that lose</p>
<p>interest that easy to pay attention to you know no i</p>
<p>get because you&rsquo;re doing a numbers game yeah</p>
<p>but then again</p>
<p>i mean how many times you seen a youtube clip and you</p>
<p>start to open</p>
<p>it up you see 9 and a half minutes you&rsquo;re like fuck it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even want to</p>
<p>start you know we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>those people yeah yeah yeah but that&rsquo;s a youtube</p>
<p>clip is totally different than something like this</p>
<p>you know this is like cool because you</p>
<p>could throw this all at work</p>
<p>you know and you&rsquo;re doing some boring fucking</p>
<p>thing at work</p>
<p>you could throw this on and</p>
<p>watch it while you do it and just</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>enjoy a bunch</p>
<p>of people hanging around talking i like doing that</p>
<p>i like watching fucking soulja boy</p>
<p>you know soulja boy is</p>

<p>greatest video i did somebody put the subtitles yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>what you were saying</p>
<p>so crazy i like</p>

<p>money how much</p>
<p>money he has</p>
<p>and how pretty he is</p>
<p>i enjoy the fuck out of it i really do tell me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entertaining a shit man i was there some said</p>
<p>type of program that</p>
<p>would follow your brain</p>
<p>like so you can look it at</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>searched in one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s next dude that&rsquo;s because</p>

<p>well you could</p>
<p>search well</p>
<p>i somehow went from</p>
<p>i started looking up</p>
<p>fights or something on youtube and then i</p>
<p>found the fight</p>
<p>scene from the</p>
<p>movie bodyguard</p>
<p>from way back in the 80s and somehow my</p>
<p>brain got from there</p>
<p>to where i was</p>
<p>watching a riding</p>
<p>dirty the song</p>
<p>all cut to star trek wrath of kong</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all clips of</p>
<p>khan was riding dirty</p>

<p>brain even how do you</p>
<p>right i love</p>
<p>to watch his clips of something conan</p>
<p>said something funny leno</p>
<p>and then you clip that and next</p>
<p>thing you know i&rsquo;m on</p>

<p>you had a wonderful time</p>
<p>though i go on youtube rides and i go on porn rides to</p>
<p>where you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other start out normal and</p>
<p>next thing you know it&rsquo;s big dicks and</p>

<p>could do is we</p>
<p>could say that you raped us</p>
<p>but how much money</p>

<p>so we have one</p>
<p>other person to see</p>
<p>their condition when they left</p>

<p>famous friend</p>
<p>he would every time he&rsquo;d hook up with a girl in a room</p>
<p>he was like way</p>
<p>famous he&rsquo;d go to the</p>
<p>front desk girl he&rsquo;d walk out that girl</p>
<p>whoever was there</p>
<p>he would stop</p>
<p>so that girl</p>
<p>would talk to that person</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>other person that see</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t run out all</p>
<p>disheveled like what just happened</p>

<p>how much more they have</p>
<p>yeah how much more</p>
<p>money yeah how</p>
<p>much better</p>
<p>their life is so unfair</p>
<p>that people feel like</p>
<p>you owe them something like you got an unfair amount</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s try to take from you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people don&rsquo;t feel bad about like</p>
<p>fake lawsuits they don&rsquo;t even feel bad yeah</p>
<p>the rich have to</p>
<p>which man fuck the rich yeah</p>
<p>and i did you make that</p>
<p>money someone got fucked over yeah</p>
<p>well you just run over my foot</p>
<p>the other day</p>
<p>and they like</p>
<p>play back the video and you didn&rsquo;t get hit by the car</p>
<p>and he was just trying to</p>
<p>hey couldn&rsquo;t the paparazzis</p>
<p>ran i always</p>
<p>think of like have some kind of</p>
<p>thing where you hit one button and you zap</p>
<p>all the other like kind of computers that around you</p>
<p>yeah they have this</p>
<p>right right right</p>
<p>you know what the paparazzis</p>
<p>is the same thing they&rsquo;re just a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>that are making a live and doing something negative and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need to do that but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>sort of negative because a lot of times they call</p>
<p>those people yes i&rsquo;ll be at the iv</p>
<p>come meet me up front</p>
<p>right and go</p>
<p>after them there&rsquo;s a lot of people that like it</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re like chasing someone and someone&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>upset with you like they got</p>
<p>their kids or something like</p>
<p>like dr drew but by the way we were talking</p>
<p>about dr drew i</p>
<p>think his stance</p>
<p>on pod is retarded but he&rsquo;s a really nice guy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done the show</p>
<p>the love line show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met at</p>
<p>lunch time she&rsquo;s a really cool guy</p>
<p>and he told me that he was in hawaii and</p>
<p>the fucking paparazzi</p>
<p>would take pictures of his kids</p>
<p>him and his kids yeah in case</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>well it was</p>
<p>worth something</p>
<p>that they make</p>
<p>money man you get a like a</p>
<p>juicy picture</p>
<p>how about that picture john travolta</p>
<p>kissing that dude somebody got paid for that</p>
<p>how bad was it i saw one of the lips</p>
<p>i saw one that was crazy</p>
<p>when you freeze</p>
<p>frame a kiss</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll never look like a casual pass</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome i love how john travolta</p>
<p>rocks a fabulous wig</p>
<p>you know and just yeah man</p>
<p>in some pictures he&rsquo;s balding</p>
<p>another pictures get the best head of hair ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>the tmz i saw one of the guys who works on tmz</p>
<p>one of the guys so we saw so and so</p>
<p>at the airport and</p>
<p>i want to go up to him so bad with the camera and just</p>
<p>stick it in his face and ask some dumb questions and</p>
<p>yeah probably could have sold that back to</p>
<p>tmz that&rsquo;s one of the things i wanted to do as a</p>
<p>sketch that</p>
<p>will do it would just go fucking or</p>
<p>the guy that does tmz</p>
<p>can he handle that</p>
<p>15 minute show without taking a drink of water</p>
<p>cause he has like</p>
<p>a sippy cup that he just there&rsquo;s no way that water so</p>
<p>dumb it just it&rsquo;s evil</p>
<p>cause those guys are making fun of people</p>
<p>that are on tv</p>
<p>yet every one of them wants to be so</p>
<p>famous and is enjoying</p>
<p>all the fame they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting from being on the show but but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legitimate too because some people like the way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bitchy like they wish they</p>
<p>could be that</p>
<p>bitchy and they like</p>
<p>watching them it&rsquo;s like a form of</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>a lot of what the chelsea</p>
<p>handler shows too</p>
<p>yeah which shit on people we wish we</p>
<p>could work with yes yeah</p>
<p>exactly but you know what there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place for that too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing as like rich people that get</p>
<p>upset at poor people it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people were not</p>
<p>famous they like fuck him pick a</p>
<p>go after tiger woods you know go find him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a billion dollars fuck him</p>
<p>like some woman actually said this on the</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel show</p>
<p>she was running a website</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>could find people&rsquo;s houses</p>
<p>or no no no it was</p>
<p>you would say</p>
<p>where the celebrity is at any</p>
<p>given moment</p>
<p>you would and</p>
<p>jimmy kim was</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t you understand</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>scary like stalkers are when i used to do</p>
<p>radio in detroit</p>
<p>this girl was in</p>
<p>the fifteen sixteen page letters not one</p>
<p>piece of white left on the</p>
<p>paper so it was written</p>

<p>going out with you looking for</p>
<p>houses shit that</p>
<p>never happened you know</p>
<p>i heard about your</p>
<p>secret messages that</p>
<p>and then she went away and then she came back and</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;d be in detroit</p>
<p>she would leave</p>
<p>these letters when your wife&rsquo;s gone and it&rsquo;s just us</p>
<p>you know crazy</p>
<p>stuff so i want to go get a restraining order</p>
<p>against her because she was showing up at my shows and</p>
<p>would find out</p>
<p>where i would be and the</p>
<p>judge would you fuck her</p>
<p>no no no do not</p>
<p>show but it was</p>
<p>nothing nothing nothing</p>
<p>yeah yeah i just want to know</p>
<p>how far back was this yeah yeah no it was a</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>about ten fifteen years and the guy wouldn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>judge would not what she wanted he wanted to hear her</p>
<p>side of the</p>
<p>story now i had</p>
<p>a stack of papers this big of her saying</p>
<p>she came to</p>
<p>the raider station i worked out with some of my</p>
<p>stuff she goes john left this it was an</p>
<p>empty can of</p>

<p>junk mail and baby</p>
<p>shoes right</p>
<p>and then she got to your</p>
<p>house well no this was from her</p>
<p>place i guess</p>
<p>and then i had</p>
<p>stacks of letters saying i hear the</p>
<p>secret messages</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re giving me</p>
<p>i will respond to him when you say this it means this</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>go to his file a restraining</p>
<p>order the judge</p>
<p>you get less than a paragraph to write why</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to hand in any of the psycho stuff</p>
<p>so that and then he saw that and then</p>
<p>the guy who did it for me goes he&rsquo;s a dude</p>
<p>he probably</p>
<p>thinks you&rsquo;re a pussy</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>the judge no</p>
<p>that because i&rsquo;m a guy and i have this girl</p>
<p>stalker the</p>
<p>judge thinks that yeah as like your</p>
<p>pussy your guy handle the girl</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bring us involved was</p>
<p>his attitude so i couldn&rsquo;t i couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>i was the judges attitude that&rsquo;s what you know</p>
<p>that was before that</p>
<p>chick up no</p>
<p>this i tried</p>
<p>doing this i</p>
<p>tried doing</p>
<p>this a couple years ago</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a year ago but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t apply to</p>
<p>california so i go through all this work and</p>
<p>get it done in michigan</p>
<p>they come out to california</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything you got to refire one</p>
<p>california she</p>
<p>she dropped flies in</p>
<p>texas to see you</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>now you have to file one in</p>
<p>texas really</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m a so i</p>
<p>could imagine</p>
<p>not put this information</p>
<p>yeah yeah hey</p>
<p>you know britney murphy the actresses just died</p>
<p>yeah her mom</p>
<p>and her husband</p>
<p>has been doing a tour</p>
<p>of all the talk shows and i got to</p>
<p>catch it today on the</p>
<p>today show yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how fucked up your</p>
<p>daughter just died and they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just sitting there like for no reason not</p>
<p>promoting anything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to like do anything</p>
<p>but just like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen them on like four different talk shows</p>
<p>in the last</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird but they do it for</p>
<p>money and they do it just</p>
<p>to like the</p>
<p>people attention or whatever or say something</p>
<p>about their</p>
<p>daughter the</p>
<p>worst is like</p>
<p>coming up we have britney murphy&rsquo;s mom britney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murphy&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>just sitting there and she knows the camera&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>and it was</p>
<p>not crying randomly</p>
<p>no no no you find it on youtube are we hulu or whatever</p>
<p>and it is disturbing to</p>
<p>watch like it was so</p>
<p>gross and the</p>
<p>husband was so what was the accusation what is the</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the isn&rsquo;t there like a current</p>
<p>the worst thing it was drugs but then they said</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>happened when she was</p>
<p>young i don&rsquo;t think it was a weird</p>
<p>situation at all</p>
<p>really it just came up showering</p>
<p>about heroin and all that</p>
<p>they still don&rsquo;t know yet</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of weird that they</p>
<p>still well it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it kind of</p>
<p>where the husband did want an autopsy</p>
<p>yes you think i think that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>funny and if a 30 year old person dies</p>
<p>you want to know what the fuck happened they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>jewish are they</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t look jewish</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s against religion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s against</p>
<p>religion yeah</p>
<p>what happens if you murder a jew though that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy that makes it easy to murder you guys no no</p>
<p>no you misunderstand it</p>
<p>you actually haven&rsquo;t thought this out</p>
<p>our bodies we can get them on your bodies</p>
<p>yeah but you you&rsquo;re dead but if i just</p>
<p>poison the dead</p>
<p>the cops can&rsquo;t give you an autopsy</p>
<p>but because i</p>
<p>just we just poison that but now they&rsquo;re not gonna know</p>
<p>weird naked choked himself to death yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the story i&rsquo;m sticking to it</p>
<p>yeah no autopsies i think there are certain</p>
<p>situations where they say if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid it might be like a</p>
<p>congenitive is that a word heart disease</p>
<p>like the kids should know if they should get</p>
<p>treated for it congenital general</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but they still</p>
<p>allow for that but not just</p>
<p>randomly to figure out what the cause of</p>
<p>death is still like he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>yeah but anytime</p>
<p>a young actress dies and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>medication around there&rsquo;s a lot of money they do all</p>
<p>they will automatically do it no matter what</p>
<p>whatever somebody says don&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>or i won&rsquo;t answer your</p>
<p>question i&rsquo;d be like man don&rsquo;t waste the money</p>
<p>people like come on this is depressing change the topic</p>
<p>hey do you guys like cats</p>
<p>what do you think about oprah she&rsquo;s so generous yeah</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t paparazzi don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>about me somebody asked me if paparazzi chased me</p>
<p>they would make zero dollars</p>
<p>off my pictures there&rsquo;s no benefit in taking</p>
<p>pictures of me you have to stay</p>
<p>just under that level of fame</p>
<p>you have to stay in the</p>
<p>level of fame where nobody gives a fuck</p>
<p>so you can still work and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about your bills and you can go out to dinner</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna don&rsquo;t get crazy the best i was with brendanzisi</p>
<p>at the vince vaughn</p>
<p>wild west comedy tour like premier</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a party like across the</p>

<p>stand up was there</p>
<p>watching and</p>
<p>stand up said i disagree with 95</p>
<p>of this but it&rsquo;s so fucking goddamn good</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy his stance was fuck the cops</p>
<p>because what they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>heroes now why because it did the job one time</p>

<p>funny jokes</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s brains and comedy is geared like</p>

<p>the minding</p>
<p>store came out</p>
<p>it was like he all of a</p>
<p>sudden was running the comedy store</p>
<p>it was all of a</p>
<p>sudden you know</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like just a tv show anymore now</p>
<p>because the comic</p>
<p>store we&rsquo;ve always done for free</p>
<p>you know i always not only did i work there for free</p>
<p>but i donated</p>
<p>all that when i had when they were giving me</p>
<p>checks they gave me like thousands of dollars worth of</p>
<p>checks and i</p>
<p>never cashed them</p>
<p>because i always knew that they were hurting for cash</p>
<p>so when it came time to do</p>
<p>their taxes i had to donate all that</p>
<p>money back to them</p>
<p>yeah and i paid for the</p>
<p>sound system</p>
<p>i mean i treated that</p>
<p>place like it was our</p>
<p>place you know it was a place</p>
<p>for comics to the mics were cutting out and that</p>
<p>sound that sounds like</p>
<p>crackley and rogan</p>

<p>money because</p>
<p>just for love of the club</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden pauly&rsquo;s running</p>

<p>you know i&rsquo;ll do it all for your mom but for you</p>
<p>no battle now but who gets the store</p>

<p>court probably won yeah</p>
<p>i think his brother gave up that&rsquo;s what i heard</p>
<p>always brothers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve all the years i&rsquo;ve</p>

<p>jamie was introducing</p>
<p>these children</p>
<p>that are on the make a wish foundation</p>
<p>right was it make a wish or something like that</p>
<p>kids are sick</p>
<p>he was introducing them</p>
<p>to michael jackson you say introducing i say pimping</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>buddy buddy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not pimping</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s genius but</p>
<p>he does not want to fuck us</p>
<p>i think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that i didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think michael jackson</p>
<p>fuck those kids</p>
<p>because i think</p>
<p>where are the</p>
<p>bodies there</p>
<p>would be not just one kitty fuck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be fucking</p>
<p>hundreds i think you probably fuck</p>
<p>eight to ten</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he did i think</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s much more likely that we talked</p>
<p>about this before</p>
<p>right yeah i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s much more likely that he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>completely fucked up</p>
<p>and was molested when he</p>
<p>was a kid and abused and he grew up in the public eye</p>
<p>and he grew up as a baby and like being</p>
<p>famous it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d already go back huge</p>
<p>drug user and</p>
<p>just kinda had</p>
<p>i believe in the</p>
<p>power of huge</p>
<p>rumors and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be true what about the</p>
<p>trouble in the ass do you believe that one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to judge</p>
<p>because of that</p>
<p>theory what</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s been injecting</p>
<p>silicone into his dick for six years can it get hard no</p>
<p>is that all head on top yeah and then the head</p>
<p>look at it so that&rsquo;s all that is</p>
<p>to hold it look at him he&rsquo;s weird that&rsquo;s a weird laugh</p>
<p>yeah how weird</p>
<p>could it be he&rsquo;s injecting silicone into his fucking</p>
<p>i mean look at that that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>okay what six years of injecting silicon have left</p>
<p>you hear what this is saying</p>
<p>six years it&rsquo;s on it he&rsquo;s unable to have sex</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to fuck his ass i was good</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>the pleasure</p>
<p>the adventure</p>
<p>and the experience that i&rsquo;ve gotten from this</p>
<p>way way way better than</p>
<p>whatever 15 minutes of pleasure that i</p>
<p>would get what it is</p>
<p>what has he got an experience</p>
<p>what just people see his balls in his dick</p>
<p>and no longer stand up to pee because</p>
<p>it would just kind of go</p>
<p>everywhere you know it was difficult to control</p>
<p>and so i started learning about okay i have to sit down</p>
<p>but you know what all and i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>about some other adjustments in a second</p>
<p>place these adjustments though</p>
<p>they just add to the</p>
<p>excitement for me because it&rsquo;s just another reminder</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s part of the odyssey of of all of this</p>
<p>you so i was sitting down to pee for a long time well</p>
<p>then the size got to be that</p>
<p>when i would sit down</p>
<p>i get wet it would</p>
<p>get dunked into the</p>
<p>water and a lot of toilets including my own here</p>
<p>and so i would</p>
<p>have sort of squat over the ball you know</p>
<p>i think that just the fact that people</p>
<p>look at me and either wonder what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>the basic questions that people ask can you</p>
<p>still have an orgasm things like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting people to think and i&rsquo;m challenging</p>
<p>their ideas of what a penis should look like</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s ridiculous that should function</p>
<p>and so but yours is the only penis that does that</p>
<p>and challenging</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s giving him a challenge are you challenging brain</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not thinking too down the gauntlet bitch</p>
<p>this is the crazy thing like someone pulls</p>
<p>it out</p>
<p>i mean this guy&rsquo;s like so</p>
<p>happy to be pulling out his dick look at this</p>
<p>look at that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even really look like a penis in any way</p>
<p>it really looks like like a basketball</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s challenging your perceptions all right</p>
<p>what the fuck let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go fuck a horse i&rsquo;m getting tired</p>
<p>how naughty is that dude</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ways you can challenge people to think</p>
<p>yeah maybe you know what is that when dudes like</p>
<p>tattoo their dicks and put barbells through them what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there they just i think presentation</p>
<p>presentation i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i hear a silver platter</p>
<p>with a cock with a spur through it</p>
<p>still works</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s plenty of girls that are into that</p>
<p>is there ladies</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a little twitter poll</p>
<p>how many girls are really into dudes with like</p>
<p>tattoos and barbells</p>
<p>same shit with girls</p>
<p>put that barbell in</p>
<p>their vaginas</p>
<p>and you like that and if you say</p>
<p>yes how smelly it makes me sad</p>
<p>the barbell and the</p>
<p>pussy makes me sad</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really like it but i&rsquo;m not that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>against it there&rsquo;s is there a single girl that</p>
<p>ever has gotten a barbell in the</p>
<p>pussy that&rsquo;s not a slut</p>
<p>not anything</p>
<p>wrong with sluts</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t say slut</p>
<p>in any negative way i mean a girl that&rsquo;s down to party</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say that instead</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s no prudes that get</p>
<p>their clips pierced no</p>
<p>you get your clip pierce you&rsquo;re sending a fucking very</p>
<p>message yeah</p>

<p>it is for a straight guy to get laid and then think</p>
<p>about how hard it is for a gay guy to get laid like</p>
<p>their numbers are low</p>
<p>yeah but such a higher percentage</p>
<p>when you find</p>
<p>their numbers yeah</p>

<p>of duty and they</p>
<p>split families up and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s well even</p>
<p>look if you look at rambo remember it was all national</p>
<p>guard guys went</p>
<p>after rambo and the</p>
<p>whole movie was making fun of</p>
<p>these national</p>
<p>guard guys like yeah</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m surprised they&rsquo;re not just like oh you&rsquo;re an eagle</p>
<p>scout you got</p>
<p>a fucking iraq</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s actually not about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes who go over there because they</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of dudes like pat tillman do to join the army</p>
<p>and join the navy</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re doing it to protect this</p>
<p>great country</p>
<p>especially then</p>
<p>in like 2001</p>
<p>2002 people once</p>
<p>they get in then</p>
<p>they realized getting</p>
<p>fucked and that&rsquo;s what happened with pat tillman</p>
<p>i mean he was a huge critic as was his brother</p>
<p>of how fucked up</p>
<p>things are over in iraq and afghanistan</p>
<p>and you know obviously want to kill him</p>
<p>to kill the friendly fire</p>
<p>i remember a year ago i went out and</p>
<p>did a show and i got back to</p>
<p>hotel room and i</p>
<p>googled oldest</p>

<p>guys that are</p>
<p>dudes man that have no fucking</p>

<p>and there&rsquo;s no option</p>
<p>like something to do what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>you taking care</p>
<p>of it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to war</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>now a major problem i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>general it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ve been at war for</p>
<p>eight years dude</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve been at war for</p>
<p>eight years man joining</p>
<p>the military for the last decade has been no joke</p>
<p>yeah you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>what the fuck man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when i was a kid</p>
<p>vietnam ended when i was a little boy</p>
<p>and i remember thinking</p>
<p>very clearly</p>
<p>that oh this is a good</p>
<p>thing cause now there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be any more war</p>
<p>like obviously everybody hates war and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna go to war again</p>
<p>and then when i was like</p>
<p>twenty one was the</p>
<p>first golf war</p>
<p>me and my buddy</p>
<p>jimmy d&rsquo;italia</p>
<p>were sick we had an</p>
<p>apartment together and</p>
<p>waltham massachusetts</p>
<p>it was ethnic the</p>
<p>two guineas</p>
<p>hanging out waltham</p>
<p>and was sitting in</p>
<p>front of the tv and the fucking the first</p>
<p>strike happened and</p>
<p>they showed the missiles coming in and bombs going off</p>
<p>and i was like holy shit</p>
<p>and we me and</p>
<p>jimmy watched it like we were</p>
<p>watching a football game</p>
<p>they were like dude we&rsquo;re at war holy shit</p>
<p>i remember being in college then and the two guys i</p>
<p>lived with were all</p>
<p>reservist and then they got called up so they were</p>
<p>probably twenty</p>
<p>twenty one years old</p>
<p>twenty two got called up and went down to</p>
<p>they were gonna</p>
<p>start to help train</p>
<p>at the time everybody was like just give me a</p>
<p>draft just give me a draft</p>
<p>so we all thought</p>
<p>cause we were that that</p>
<p>age were twenty</p>
<p>twenty one were like</p>
<p>holy crap we&rsquo;re going yeah</p>
<p>oh yeah that was a serious talk yeah yeah</p>
<p>so scary man</p>
<p>i remember when</p>
<p>the first gulf</p>
<p>war happened we&rsquo;re practicing in basketball</p>
<p>and it was the opening</p>
<p>night with some play some high</p>
<p>school play</p>
<p>and somebody came in like the play bomb</p>
<p>the plane&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bomb but i just thought there was like a play bomb</p>
<p>i was like why are you</p>
<p>breaking up a practice with it</p>
<p>so yes i&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>happy about it it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>yeah the whole</p>
<p>thing is so surreal</p>
<p>i got woken</p>
<p>up i don&rsquo;t remember who woke me up somebody woke me up</p>
<p>called being told me that</p>
<p>america&rsquo;s under</p>
<p>attack yeah so they said</p>
<p>america&rsquo;s under attack</p>
<p>and i was like what turn on the news america&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under attack</p>
<p>and we just are so removed</p>
<p>from all the shit</p>
<p>that goes on in the rest of the</p>
<p>world we are so removed from what war really is</p>
<p>unless you talk</p>
<p>to someone who&rsquo;s actually been over there and</p>
<p>come back and they have a very different opinion of it</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re so fucking removed from it over here</p>
<p>when i saw that shit on tv i was like what really</p>
<p>like this isn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>movie i was like your</p>
<p>heart starts beating faster it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>all of a sudden</p>
<p>this team you&rsquo;re on is</p>
<p>under attack</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not you but it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all in this team together</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about that through your day to day life you</p>
<p>could say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy to be an american shit and</p>
<p>you believe in democracy and i&rsquo;m a republican</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really realize you&rsquo;re on some team</p>
<p>until the team&rsquo;s attacked right</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like so dudes that did nothing</p>
<p>dudes who didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these dudes</p>
<p>came over and killed them</p>
<p>just because they were living on this part</p>
<p>yeah they were living in this</p>
<p>patch of dirt so people were killing them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it i thought that was only</p>
<p>movie shit my brother&rsquo;s over there now</p>
<p>is he justin</p>
<p>just got called up again</p>
<p>oh my god yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens when you when you go through a tour</p>
<p>if you sign up for the military</p>
<p>dick cheney</p>
<p>instituted some new situation</p>
<p>where they can just</p>
<p>kind of keep</p>
<p>bringing you back well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still an active reserve so he knew he&rsquo;s eventually got</p>
<p>called up again</p>
<p>but when they were in there were</p>
<p>situations on</p>
<p>their tours and they were</p>
<p>bringing them back yeah</p>
<p>randall mask or how long are you</p>
<p>going to ask the same question over and over and over</p>
<p>again there&rsquo;s some dude asking a question</p>
<p>over again i&rsquo;ve seen it ten times you just show</p>
<p>ordered him joe who gets more women</p>
<p>why you reading it huh</p>
<p>rewarding him</p>
<p>you know i just</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>sorry yeah when people ignore you sometimes</p>
<p>you ever make a joke like in public and nobody laughs</p>
<p>and then you hear somebody like</p>
<p>make the same joke</p>
<p>again because they assume nobody heard them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>look at the response and fucking</p>
<p>take that to me and they didn&rsquo;t find it funny</p>
<p>the worse and someone</p>
<p>thinks you weren&rsquo;t listening and they say it again yeah</p>
<p>one that means it&rsquo;s not in the moment but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to make this joke</p>
<p>this guy says all the branches</p>
<p>other than the army</p>
<p>are overloaded actually</p>
<p>i believe that now</p>
<p>now i think he&rsquo;s probably telling</p>
<p>truth i would</p>
<p>think in this economy i would</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot yeah a lot of people are</p>
<p>a lot higher than</p>
<p>look at what was it how long two years ago new orleans</p>
<p>you know we didn&rsquo;t have enough people to send their</p>
<p>two years ago</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a lot more than two years ago when was katrina</p>
<p>what year was that</p>
<p>maybe it was longer</p>
<p>because that was when i</p>
<p>first heard</p>
<p>about kanye west</p>
<p>when he was like george bush</p>
<p>hates black people i was like</p>
<p>that was way long</p>
<p>that was my favorite was michael</p>
<p>myers reaction because he&rsquo;s just a hollywood guy</p>
<p>i do not want to</p>
<p>be associated with he just so uncomfortable</p>
<p>i know he got so i mean that was like one of the</p>
<p>blackest dangerous things</p>
<p>in this picture</p>
<p>george bush does not like black people george but</p>
<p>hates black people right you say hates or does not like</p>
<p>push he said hey</p>
<p>he said hates hates black people yeah</p>
<p>you know why why is that guy still on tv and</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s on tv because he&rsquo;s a douchebag</p>
<p>and because people are looking for him to do something</p>
<p>wrong his like</p>
<p>his way on tv</p>
<p>has evolved it used to be like</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>young artist</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like this guy&rsquo;s such a cock</p>
<p>like having close to the camera let&rsquo;s see him probably</p>
<p>do something</p>
<p>stupid never</p>
<p>to hate him and it&rsquo;ll get you million hits on youtube</p>
<p>you know like when he took that</p>
<p>microphone away from that girl he&rsquo;ll be hated forever</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do that what was even</p>
<p>worse was his</p>
<p>fake apology on leno</p>
<p>later he was</p>
<p>trying to work up tears but he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite do it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so weak</p>
<p>and he was just</p>
<p>saying he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take a step back and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna work on some show he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna let&rsquo;s just shut the fuck up</p>
<p>the my favorite</p>
<p>is one that he says just please just let me be</p>
<p>great just let me be</p>
<p>great bush george bush</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about black people</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i thought it was</p>
<p>thank you are add</p>
<p>her boy yeah</p>
<p>hate is a very</p>
<p>strong word</p>
<p>hate might make mike myers</p>
<p>flinch and pee a little yeah</p>
<p>made a little little</p>
<p>dribble go this</p>
<p>could ruin my career</p>
<p>what happened to that dude</p>
<p>mike myers yeah it</p>
<p>was there actually making a new awesome powers</p>
<p>yeah that last</p>
<p>movie let it die</p>

<p>clearly someone who&rsquo;s known as a</p>
<p>comedic actor i really</p>
<p>hate him now</p>

<p>wrong way of like dude you&rsquo;re doing the same movie but</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s an indian american accent</p>
<p>because he wasn&rsquo;t over</p>
<p>two years ago he was just like a little bit like</p>

<p>they usually always have the best parts in the preview</p>
<p>there was not one part in this that was fun</p>
<p>that looks good you guys</p>
<p>that is the worst</p>
<p>when you go to preview</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>sit there and go oh what the fuck are they doing</p>
<p>why would someone</p>
<p>like promote this yeah there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>worse than bad comedy</p>

<p>because some</p>
<p>teacher taught them in the clear</p>
<p>move to the rest of the movie that</p>
<p>he sounded like he was being real but he really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and then later was like are you serious</p>
<p>about that yeah i was</p>
<p>i guarantee</p>
<p>you kurt cameron loves the cock</p>
<p>i guarantee you he loves the cock</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no doubt about it there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>crazy gung ho</p>

<p>no sin no masturbation no love</p>
<p>fucking gay as the day as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right you know said</p>
<p>it with every fiber of his being</p>
<p>trying to stay in the straight and narrow</p>
<p>and like girls and meanwhile he just wants fucking</p>
<p>hot mouth i&rsquo;m sure that</p>
<p>herschel walker was talking</p>
<p>about when you doing his fight</p>
<p>strike voice and he said he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>masturbate yeah but he&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>herschel walker&rsquo;s got like</p>
<p>a split personality disorder yes</p>
<p>i heard it was</p>
<p>trauma related i thought it was trauma related</p>
<p>he said that like he gets</p>
<p>his heisman</p>
<p>trophy like he&rsquo;s got all these different well think</p>
<p>about how many times i got must have had concussions</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a big concussion guy though</p>
<p>he plays football</p>
<p>everybody gets concussions playing football</p>
<p>right quarterbacks get it no a quarterback</p>
<p>like who&rsquo;s had the most</p>
<p>like eight ever</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>to take blindside hits all the time</p>
<p>was standing there with somebody fucking</p>
<p>crush them helmet to hell</p>
<p>yeah but but any time you get hit</p>
<p>okay even if you&rsquo;re not getting concussions</p>
<p>a little bit you&rsquo;re getting fucking rattled</p>
<p>yeah even if</p>
<p>you get up and you get back up when you get</p>
<p>smashed into</p>
<p>by some giant dude who&rsquo;s running a full clip</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t go out</p>
<p>and even if you don&rsquo;t have a concussion</p>
<p>where like your pupils are dilated</p>
<p>you got some</p>
<p>brain damage son you just got jarred you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s reality</p>
<p>and when you do that shit over and over and over again</p>
<p>football is one of the most dangerous i saw ben</p>
<p>roethlisberger last week</p>
<p>no it would&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>rothlisberger</p>
<p>is there a big</p>
<p>quarterback whoever it was oh</p>
<p>kurt warner</p>
<p>who threw an interception went to make a tackle</p>
<p>and then he just got blindsided</p>
<p>and you see him on the ground with his</p>
<p>trainers over him and he&rsquo;s like talking but you can</p>
<p>clearly see he&rsquo;s not making any</p>
<p>sense he&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>dropped yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah when it came on</p>
<p>oh wow i did like his reaction was so real tim sylvia</p>
<p>when he fought</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the name</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>when tim sylvia</p>
<p>got cracked in the first</p>
<p>round he woke up</p>
<p>going into the fourth round</p>
<p>yeah he didn&rsquo;t know what round was he thought the</p>
<p>second round was the fourth round</p>
<p>we thought the fourth round was the second round</p>
<p>off by two missed to over the fifth i</p>
<p>think it might have been the fifth</p>
<p>because they told him like this is the last</p>
<p>round he was like what the last</p>
<p>round like he thought it was like the second round</p>
<p>like he was gone</p>
<p>to race he was fighting on autopilot</p>
<p>just your body</p>
<p>your body trying not to die dude</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>random nerves just just randomly</p>
<p>throwing blasted</p>
<p>i love like striking</p>
<p>training i love</p>
<p>like hitting the pad and hitting the bag and</p>
<p>spawn with somebody you can</p>
<p>trust is fun</p>
<p>yeah if you can find that guy that knows 70 is 70</p>
<p>not you&rsquo;re 70</p>
<p>you punch you in the face recently</p>
<p>and your clock</p>
<p>problem yeah</p>
<p>same thing that&rsquo;s why like i like i enjoy</p>
<p>train like you said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>literally i go let&rsquo;s go 40</p>
<p>because i got so much</p>
<p>and if you know people don&rsquo;t know when you do like</p>
<p>striking spawn</p>
<p>the whole deal is that you don&rsquo;t hit each other hard</p>
<p>you hit each other like</p>
<p>a little bit but you don&rsquo;t try to knock each</p>
<p>other out yeah</p>
<p>and so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>and my problem is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>close enough so i told the guy</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go 40 that way if i do get</p>
<p>drilled right in the face it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>so then i throw a kick but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>throwing a kick at</p>
<p>forty percent</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>any little kid</p>
<p>could grab that kick yeah it&rsquo;s not going fast</p>
<p>so he swoops it grabs it and then</p>
<p>blaster punches</p>
<p>as hard as he could</p>
<p>after he catches my foot and then i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>laying there i want yeah that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>more jiu jitsu because the</p>
<p>worst thing is</p>
<p>gonna happen to me is somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna tap me out</p>
<p>yeah i mean that</p>
<p>could be that fluke</p>
<p>weird yeah you get</p>
<p>occasionally but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>just not a gentleman&rsquo;s poor it&rsquo;s just uh</p>
<p>more technical</p>
<p>and the worst</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s happened is i go like that and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going man i</p>
<p>are just weird</p>
<p>plant where</p>
<p>the face slow down good guys don&rsquo;t hurt you</p>
<p>good guys are the least</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>worry about like with a guy like eddie</p>
<p>if he gets your arm he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have full control he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna pull it back and snap it</p>
<p>you gotta worry about</p>
<p>strong blue belts that are just</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>learn how to tap people</p>
<p>those are the ones</p>
<p>you know or you know</p>
<p>just real hyper</p>
<p>aggressive and they don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>relax yet or</p>
<p>super powerful</p>
<p>white belts</p>
<p>who are just</p>
<p>learning moves</p>
<p>emotional gut is</p>
<p>bruises all over your fucking well when you</p>
<p>sparr somebody especially</p>
<p>like if i find a</p>
<p>place wherever i&rsquo;m performing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a better</p>
<p>story for them</p>
<p>yeah is ding</p>
<p>knocked out the</p>
<p>comic that way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a way better story then</p>
<p>i want to work on getting inside you mind if i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>some places that you go to would</p>
<p>know people don&rsquo;t try</p>
<p>to do that at all like when i went to a mall eastons</p>
<p>place in boulder i</p>
<p>when i moved in i</p>
<p>started training there people</p>
<p>could have been nice</p>
<p>yeah everybody was cool</p>
<p>there was no assholes there was no aggro</p>
<p>dudes no one trying to tap you no one getting crazy</p>
<p>i mean they were trying to tap you but they you know</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trying to yeah</p>
<p>you know they were just rolling it was</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s all from how cool the instructor is</p>
<p>the instructors cool to the people like</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s so friendly and so</p>
<p>relaxed and so cool to everybody that everybody in the</p>
<p>whole gym carries that friendly</p>
<p>relaxed attitude</p>
<p>you know you go to like john jacques the same</p>
<p>thing john jacques is a real nice guy</p>
<p>so everybody there is nice</p>
<p>and he was so high the</p>
<p>other day that he</p>
<p>started talking</p>
<p>and he wanted to hand it and then i was like i wonder</p>
<p>if and then you see</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>laughing like he&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>he got so high he</p>
<p>spent the first five minutes of</p>
<p>class talking</p>
<p>about some history channel documentary on ufos</p>
<p>the first five minutes like dude they got scientists</p>
<p>man they got</p>
<p>nasa nasa people going down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the history channel shits going down</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like how high are you right now</p>
<p>often you do do do</p>
<p>once once to one point five times a week</p>
<p>but you still see</p>
<p>i need even that once yeah</p>
<p>get you thinking</p>
<p>about it i just get so mad at myself like i&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>on you learn some</p>
<p>stuff and then you come back and</p>
<p>you just hold somebody</p>
<p>going i used to remember something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>and then try to hold it more you</p>
<p>gotta just be like running</p>
<p>you just stand on</p>
<p>a couple weeks off and you try to do your act like</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s this go you don&rsquo;t even remember your bets you</p>
<p>have to like review your recordings i forgot a shit i</p>
<p>took extended period off and i forgot a shit i was like</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>i can do something here i don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>you forget a lot of shit i forgot</p>
<p>completely forgot how to do this is this move to</p>
<p>break the armbar</p>
<p>loose called the silverado</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my favorite move and i was a purple belt i</p>
<p>completely forgot</p>
<p>about it right</p>
<p>revealing it the other</p>
<p>night i&rsquo;m like oh yeah it&rsquo;s there that&rsquo;s how it goes in</p>
<p>you know i forgot</p>
<p>how to do it but it was like one of my favorite moves</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird jujitsu&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so many moves that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>about it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not matched</p>
<p>right you think</p>
<p>year from now some guy</p>
<p>would do something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right it comes off what</p>
<p>other people are doing yeah so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on what you do and then</p>
<p>but then no</p>
<p>one has ever thought to defend this move yet because</p>
<p>it does get invented then you&rsquo;ve got to have a</p>
<p>counter there&rsquo;s this new move that dudes have</p>
<p>been doing real recently called the japanese necktie</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just come out like i</p>
<p>think aoki was the</p>
<p>first person to do it and</p>
<p>and the group</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>japanese neck ties like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like a dars</p>
<p>but you you you grab it</p>
<p>you grab it with a gable</p>
<p>grip and you turn the guys head up towards his</p>
<p>chest and you have your</p>
<p>chest pinned on them it&rsquo;s fucking nasty</p>
<p>this one the</p>
<p>band it&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how did no one know this before</p>
<p>right right yeah people are in this</p>
<p>position all the time they&rsquo;re trying to get the dar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>choke but really</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an even better</p>
<p>choke that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there so as soon as you lock up that gable</p>
<p>grip and you get on top of a guy</p>
<p>just tuck it</p>
<p>under and you&rsquo;re bending his fucking neck towards his</p>
<p>chest your chest is on top of his head</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got no air no blood</p>
<p>whenever we do</p>
<p>those drills and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those cranks oh</p>
<p>i always pretend</p>
<p>like we have an odd number of people in the</p>
<p>class that i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a partner no you</p>
<p>should do it</p>
<p>yeah but you do it anyway you got to</p>
<p>relax just let them let them yank your neck around</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>small difference between fine and</p>
<p>serious pain</p>
<p>yeah but you got to get used to that</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna hurt you doing that you know but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be uncomfortable</p>
<p>but that that moves it&rsquo;s so important to</p>
<p>learn how where</p>
<p>where it comes on</p>
<p>cause like the japanese necktie comes on so quick</p>
<p>the peruvian of</p>
<p>tattoo it&rsquo;s like well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going like this and then you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>jumping back and hopefully you don&rsquo;t go too far</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a spasi</p>
<p>move it&rsquo;s awesome move</p>
<p>peruvian necktie</p>
<p>and japanese</p>
<p>necktie both of them are the shit</p>
<p>they fuck you up man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible position to be in</p>
<p>i think the japanese neck</p>
<p>ties even mom proving is pretty badass too</p>
<p>and the proving you got your weight on top of them</p>
<p>always the japanese</p>
<p>necktie you kind of like on the side and hooking it but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s so good such a</p>
<p>powerful move like that</p>
<p>well i think we&rsquo;re done do you</p>
<p>agree brian</p>
<p>i was just thinking</p>
<p>of japanese people i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like have i ever seen a japanese guy wear it in no time</p>
<p>well what about that fucking japanese video game</p>
<p>that video that you posted</p>
<p>maybe we should end with that</p>
<p>cause that is the most bizarre fucking</p>
<p>thing i think i&rsquo;ve ever seen on the internet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>crazy japanese video game that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>these two muscle bound gay guys wearing diapers</p>
<p>and there there are</p>
<p>human bicycle</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re riding on the road and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting chased and</p>
<p>i mean it is one of the gayest</p>
<p>weirdest things</p>
<p>japanese lead that lead the the league in</p>
<p>weirdness god is so strange</p>
<p>do you know for people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like you can go to vending machines in</p>
<p>japan you can buy use panties</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s real right</p>
<p>yeah you go places they sell used panties</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t we open one of those there</p>
<p>because you have one of those here</p>
<p>all you have to do is get a girl to put it on real</p>
<p>quick throw it in a bag and then yeah i think you have</p>
<p>to have enough people there because i think</p>
<p>maybe cause</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>should have different</p>
<p>levels you should have different levels</p>
<p>one the girl wears it all day that&rsquo;s the primo</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>her panties all day no shower in the morning no shower</p>
<p>she goes to the gym</p>
<p>and you get</p>
<p>those stinky</p>
<p>sweaty funky</p>
<p>moose knuckle</p>
<p>underwears i</p>
<p>think you missed an opportunity for the</p>
<p>joe rogan fanny pack</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna make a line</p>
<p>and i was already</p>
<p>thinking about your fashion show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m making fanny packs and then</p>
<p>like rogan i mean you</p>
<p>could probably get it so instead of its fanny</p>
<p>pack it&rsquo;s oh you want to</p>
<p>well i mean there&rsquo;s some huge yeah</p>
<p>like people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>balls and people</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m kidding about the fanny pack thing</p>
<p>you see me at the airport i always have one of</p>
<p>those things you should shape a fanny pack like a</p>
<p>skull like a three dimensional</p>
<p>skull you can get a little</p>
<p>crazy with it it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s overhead</p>
<p>compartment for your junk you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying the sky&rsquo;s the limit yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so i mean they really there&rsquo;s a huge open</p>
<p>where and you comfortable so useful</p>
<p>five packs the shit</p>
