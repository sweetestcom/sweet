    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>I&rsquo;m Craig Smith, and this is Eye on AI.</p>
<p>This week, I talked to Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI and one of the</p>
<p>primary minds behind the large-language model GPT-3 and its public progeny, ChatGPT, which</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to say is changing the world.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Ilya has changed the world.</p>
<p>Jeff Hinton has said he was the main impetus for AlexNet, the convolutional neural network</p>
<p>whose dramatic performance stunned the scientific community in 2012 and set off the deep learning</p>
<p>revolution.</p>
<p>As is often the case in these conversations, they assume a lot of knowledge on the part</p>
<p>of listeners, primarily because I don&rsquo;t want to waste the limited time I have to speak</p>
<p>to people like Ilya explaining concepts or people or events that can easily be googled</p>
<p>or binged, I should say, where the ChatGPT can explain for you.</p>
<p>The conversation with Ilya follows a conversation with Yan LeCun in a previous episode, so if</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t listened to that episode, I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy the conversation with Ilya as much as I did.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s terrific to meet you, to talk to you.</p>
<p>I watched many of your talks online and read many of your papers.</p>
<p>Can you start just by introducing yourself, a little bit of your background?</p>
<p>I know you were born in Russia.</p>
<p>Where you were educated, what got you interested in computer science, if that was the initial</p>
<p>impulse, or brain science, neuroscience, or whatever it was, and then I&rsquo;ll start asking</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can talk about that a little bit.</p>
<p>So yeah, indeed, I was born in Russia, I grew up in Israel, and then as a teenager, my family</p>
<p>immigrated to Canada.</p>
<p>My parents say I was interested in AI from a pretty early age.</p>
<p>I also was very motivated by consciousness, I was very disturbed by it.</p>
<p>And I was curious about things that could help me understand it better.</p>
<p>And AI seemed like a very, like a good angle there.</p>
<p>So I think these were some of the ways that got me started.</p>
<p>And I actually started working with Geoff Hinton very early, when I was 17, we moved</p>
<p>to Canada, and I immediately was able to join the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to do machine learning, because that seemed like the most important</p>
<p>aspect of artificial intelligence that at the time was completely inaccessible.</p>
<p>Like to give some context, the year was 2003.</p>
<p>Today, we take it for granted that computers can learn.</p>
<p>But in 2003, we took it for granted that computers can&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>The biggest achievement of AI back then was Deep Blue, the chess plane engine.</p>
<p>But there it was like, you have this game, and you have this tree search, and you have</p>
<p>this simple way of determining if one position is better than another.</p>
<p>And it really did not feel like that could possibly be applicable to the real world,</p>
<p>because there is no learning.</p>
<p>And learning was this big mystery.</p>
<p>And so I was really, really interested in learning.</p>
<p>And to my great luck, Geoff Hinton was a professor in the university I was in.</p>
<p>And so I was able to find him and we began working together almost right away.</p>
<p>And was your impulse as it was for Geoff to understand how the brain worked, or was it</p>
<p>more that you were simply interested in the idea of machines learning?</p>
<p>AI is so big.</p>
<p>And so the motivations were just as many, like, it is interesting, but how does intelligence</p>
<p>work at all?</p>
<p>Like, right now, we have quite a bit of an idea that it&rsquo;s a big neural net, and we know</p>
<p>how it works to some degree.</p>
<p>But back then, all of the neural nets were around.</p>
<p>No one knew that neural nets are good for anything.</p>
<p>So how does intelligence work at all?</p>
<p>How can we make computers be even slightly intelligent?</p>
<p>And I had a very explicit intention to make a very small, but the real contribution to</p>
<p>AI, because there were lots of contributions to AI which weren&rsquo;t real, which were, like</p>
<p>I could tell, for various reasons that they weren&rsquo;t real, that nothing would come out</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>And I just thought, nothing works at all.</p>
<p>AI is a hopeless field.</p>
<p>So the motivation was, could I understand how intelligence works and also make a contribution</p>
<p>towards it?</p>
<p>So that was my initial early motivation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 2003, almost exactly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And then Alex, and I&rsquo;ve spoken to Jeff, and he said that it was really your excitement</p>
<p>about the breakthroughs in convolutional neural networks that led you to apply for</p>
<p>the ImageNet competition, and that Alex had the coding skills to train the network.</p>
<p>Can you talk just a little bit about that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get bogged down in history, but it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, I had the realization that if you train a large neural network on a large,</p>
<p>sorry, large and deep, because back then the deep part was still new, if you train a large</p>
<p>and a deep neural network on a big enough dataset that specifies some complicated tasks</p>
<p>that people do, such as vision, but also others, and you just train that neural network, then</p>
<p>you will succeed necessarily.</p>
<p>And the logic for it was very irreducible, where we know that the human brain can solve</p>
<p>these tasks and can solve them quickly.</p>
<p>And the human brain is just a neural network with slow neurons.</p>
<p>So we know that some neural network can do it really well.</p>
<p>So then we just need to take a smaller but related neural network and just train it on</p>
<p>data and the best neural network inside the computer will be related to the neural network</p>
<p>that we have that performs this task.</p>
<p>So it was an argument that the neural network, the large and deep neural network can solve</p>
<p>the task.</p>
<p>And furthermore, we have the tools to train it.</p>
<p>That was the result of the technical work that was done in Jeff&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>So you combine the two, we can train those neural networks.</p>
<p>It needs to be big enough so that if you trained it, it would work well.</p>
<p>And you need the data which can specify the solution.</p>
<p>And with ImageNet, all the ingredients were there.</p>
<p>Alex had these very fast convolutional kernels.</p>
<p>ImageNet had large enough data and there was a real opportunity to do something totally</p>
<p>unprecedented and it totally worked out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was supervised learning and the convolutional neural nets.</p>
<p>In 2017, the attention is all you need paper came out introducing self-attention and transformers.</p>
<p>At what point did the GPT project start?</p>
<p>Is there some intuition about transformers and self-supervised learning?</p>
<p>Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>So for context, at OpenAI from the earliest days, we were exploring the idea that predicting</p>
<p>the next thing is all you need.</p>
<p>We were exploring it with the much more limited neural networks of the time.</p>
<p>But the hope was that if you have a neural network that can predict the next word, the</p>
<p>next pixel, really it&rsquo;s about compression.</p>
<p>Prediction is compression.</p>
<p>And predicting the next word is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Let me think about the best way to explain it.</p>
<p>Because there were many things going on and they were all related.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll take a different direction.</p>
<p>We were indeed interested in trying to understand how far predicting the next word is going</p>
<p>to go and whether it will solve unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>So back before the GPTs, unsupervised learning was considered to be the holy grail of machine</p>
<p>learning.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just been fully solved and no one even talks about it.</p>
<p>But it was a holy grail.</p>
<p>It was very mysterious.</p>
<p>And so we were exploring the idea.</p>
<p>I was really excited about it, that predicting the next word well enough is going to give</p>
<p>you unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>If it will learn everything about the data set, that&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>
<p>But our neural networks were not up for the task.</p>
<p>We were using recurrent neural networks.</p>
<p>When the transformer came out, it was literally, as soon as the paper came out, literally the</p>
<p>next day, it was clear to me, to us, that transformers address the limitations of recurrent</p>
<p>neural networks of learning long-term dependencies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technical thing, but it was like we switch to transformers right away.</p>
<p>And so the very nascent GPT effort continued then.</p>
<p>And then like with the transformer, it started to work better and you make it bigger and</p>
<p>then we realized we need to keep making it bigger.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what led to eventually GPT-3 and essentially where we are today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to ask, actually, I&rsquo;m getting caught up in this history, but I&rsquo;m so interested</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>I want to get to the problems or the shortcomings of large language models or large models generally.</p>
<p>But Rich Sutton had been writing about scaling and how that&rsquo;s all we need to do.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need new algorithms.</p>
<p>We just need to scale.</p>
<p>Did he have an influence on you or was that a parallel track of thinking?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would say that when he posted his article, then we were very pleased to see some external</p>
<p>people thinking in similar lines and we thought it was very eloquently articulated.</p>
<p>But I actually think that the bitter lesson as articulated overstates its case.</p>
<p>Or at least I think the takeaway that people have taken from it overstates its case.</p>
<p>The takeaway that people have is it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, just scale.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not exactly true.</p>
<p>You got to scale something specific.</p>
<p>You got to have something that you&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from the scale.</p>
<p>The great breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides us with the first ever way</p>
<p>of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return.</p>
<p>Before that, what would people use large computer clusters for?</p>
<p>I guess they would do it for weather simulations or physics simulations or something, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it, maybe moviemaking.</p>
<p>But no one had any real need for computer clusters because what do you do with them?</p>
<p>The fact that deep neural networks, when you make them larger and you train them on</p>
<p>more data, work better, provided us with the first thing that is interesting to scale.</p>
<p>But perhaps one day we will discover that there is some little twist on the thing that</p>
<p>we scale that&rsquo;s going to be even better to scale.</p>
<p>Now how big of a twist and then of course, with the benefit of hindsight, you will say,</p>
<p>does it even count?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a simple change.</p>
<p>But I think the true statement is that it matters what you scale.</p>
<p>Right now we just found a thing to scale that gives us something in return.</p>
<p>The limitation of large language models as they exist is their knowledge is contained</p>
<p>in the language that they&rsquo;re trained on.</p>
<p>And most human knowledge, I think everyone agrees, is non-linguistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure Noam Chomsky agrees, but there&rsquo;s a problem in the large language models.</p>
<p>As I understand it, their objective is to satisfy the statistical consistency of the</p>
<p>prompt.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have an underlying understanding of reality that language relates to.</p>
<p>I asked Chet Chibiti about myself.</p>
<p>It recognized that I&rsquo;m a journalist, that I&rsquo;ve worked at these various newspapers, but</p>
<p>it went on and on about awards that I&rsquo;ve never won and it all read beautifully, but none</p>
<p>of it connected to the underlying reality.</p>
<p>Is there something that is being done to address that in your research going forward?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So before I comment on the immediate question that you ask, I want to comment about some</p>
<p>of the earlier parts of the question.</p>
<p>I think that it is very hard to talk about the limits or limitations rather, of even</p>
<p>something like a language model, because two years ago, people confidently spoke about</p>
<p>their limitations and they were entirely different, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to keep this context in mind.</p>
<p>How confident are we that these limitations that we&rsquo;ll see today will still be with us</p>
<p>two years from now?</p>
<p>I am not that confident.</p>
<p>There is another comment I want to make about one part of the question, which is that these</p>
<p>models just learned the statistical regularities and therefore they don&rsquo;t really know what</p>
<p>the nature of the world is.</p>
<p>And I have a view that differs from this.</p>
<p>In other words, I think that learning the statistical regularities is a far bigger deal</p>
<p>than meets the eye.</p>
<p>The reason we don&rsquo;t initially think so is because we haven&rsquo;t, at least most people,</p>
<p>those who haven&rsquo;t really spent a lot of time with neural networks, which are on some level</p>
<p>statistical, like what&rsquo;s a statistical model?</p>
<p>You just fit some parameters, like what is really happening?</p>
<p>But I think there is a better interpretation to the earlier point of prediction as compression.</p>
<p>Compression is also a statistical phenomenon, yet to predict, you eventually need to understand</p>
<p>the true underlying process that produced the data.</p>
<p>To predict the data well, to compress it well, you need to understand more and more about</p>
<p>the world that produced the data.</p>
<p>As our generative models become extraordinarily good, they will have, I claim, a shocking</p>
<p>degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the world.</p>
<p>It is the world as seen through the lens of text.</p>
<p>It tries to learn more and more about the world through a projection of the world on</p>
<p>the space of text as expressed by human beings on the internet.</p>
<p>But still, this text already expresses the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example, a recent example, which I think is really telling and fascinating.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all heard of Sidney, Bing&rsquo;s alter ego.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this really interesting interaction with Sidney, where Sidney became combative</p>
<p>and aggressive when the user told it that it thinks that Google is a better search engine</p>
<p>than Bing.</p>
<p>Now, what is a good way to think about this phenomenon?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good language?</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>You can say, well, it&rsquo;s just predicting what people would do and people would do this,</p>
<p>which is true.</p>
<p>But maybe we&rsquo;re now reaching a point where the language of psychology is starting to</p>
<p>be appropriate to understand the behavior of these neural networks.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the limitations.</p>
<p>It is indeed the case that these neural networks, they do have a tendency to hallucinate.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because a language model is great for learning about the world, but it is a</p>
<p>little bit less great for producing good outputs.</p>
<p>And there are various technical reasons for that, which I could elaborate on if you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful, but it is right now, like at this second, I will skip that.</p>
<p>There are technical reasons why a language model is much better at learning about the</p>
<p>world, learning incredible representations of ideas, of concepts, of people, of processes</p>
<p>that exist.</p>
<p>But its outputs aren&rsquo;t quite as good as one would hope or rather as good as they could</p>
<p>be, which is why, for example, for a system like CHI-GPT, this is a language model that</p>
<p>has an additional reinforcement learning training process.</p>
<p>We call it reinforcement learning from human feedback.</p>
<p>But the thing to understand about that process is this, we can say that the pre-training</p>
<p>process, when you just train a language model, you want to learn everything about the world.</p>
<p>But then the reinforcement learning from human feedback, now we care about the outputs.</p>
<p>Now we say, anytime the output is inappropriate, don&rsquo;t do this again.</p>
<p>Every time the output does not make sense, don&rsquo;t do this again.</p>
<p>And it learns quickly to produce good outputs.</p>
<p>But now it is the level of the outputs, which is not the case during pre-training, during</p>
<p>the language model training process.</p>
<p>Now, on the point of hallucinations, and it has a propensity of making stuff up, indeed,</p>
<p>it is true.</p>
<p>Right now, these neural networks, even CHI-GPT, makes things up from time to time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that also greatly limits their usefulness.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m quite hopeful that by simply improving this subsequent reinforcement learning from</p>
<p>human feedback step, we could just teach it to not hallucinate.</p>
<p>Now you could say, is it really going to learn?</p>
<p>My answer is, let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<p>And that feedback loop is coming from the public CHI-GPT interface, that if it tells</p>
<p>me that I won a Pulitzer, which unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t, I can tell it that it&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>Will that train it or create some punishment or reward so that the next time I ask, it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be more accurate?</p>
<p>The way we do things today is that we hire people to teach our neural net to behave,</p>
<p>to teach CHI-GPT to behave.</p>
<p>And right now, the manner, the precise manner in which they specify the desired behavior</p>
<p>is a little bit different.</p>
<p>But indeed, what you described is the way in which teaching is going to basically be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the correct way to teach.</p>
<p>And you just interact with it.</p>
<p>And it sees from your reaction, it infers, oh, that&rsquo;s not what you wanted.</p>
<p>You are not happy with its output.</p>
<p>Therefore the output was not good and it should do something differently next time.</p>
<p>So in particular, hallucinations come up as one of the bigger issues.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see, but I think there is a quite a high chance that this approach will be able</p>
<p>to address them completely.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to you about Yann LeCun&rsquo;s work on joint embedding predictive architectures</p>
<p>and his idea that what&rsquo;s missing from large language models is this underlying world model</p>
<p>that is non-linguistic, that the language model can refer to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s built.</p>
<p>But I wanted to hear what you thought of that and whether you&rsquo;ve explored that at all.</p>
<p>So I reviewed Yann LeCun&rsquo;s proposal and there are a number of ideas there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re expressed in different language.</p>
<p>And there are some maybe small differences from the current paradigm.</p>
<p>But to my mind, they are not very significant and I&rsquo;d like to elaborate.</p>
<p>The first claim is that it is desirable for a system to have multi-modal understanding</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t just know about the world from text.</p>
<p>And my comment on that will be that indeed multi-modal understanding is desirable because</p>
<p>you learn more about the world.</p>
<p>You learn more about people.</p>
<p>You learn more about their condition.</p>
<p>And so the system will be able to understand what the task that it&rsquo;s supposed to solve</p>
<p>and the people and what they want better.</p>
<p>We have done quite a bit of work on that, most notably in the form of two major neural</p>
<p>nets that we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>One is called CLIP and one is called DALI.</p>
<p>Both of them move towards this multi-modal direction.</p>
<p>But I also want to say that I don&rsquo;t see the situation as a binary either or, that if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have vision, if you don&rsquo;t understand the world visually or from video, then things</p>
<p>will not work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to make the case for that.</p>
<p>So I think that some things are much easier to learn from images and diagrams and so on.</p>
<p>But I claim that you can still learn them from text only, just more slowly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>Consider the notion of color.</p>
<p>Surely one cannot learn the notion of color from text only.</p>
<p>And yet, when you look at the embeddings, I need to make a small detour to explain the</p>
<p>concept of an embedding.</p>
<p>Every neural network represents words, sentences, concepts through representations, embeddings,</p>
<p>high-dimensional vectors.</p>
<p>And one thing that we can do is that we can look at those high-dimensional vectors and</p>
<p>we can look at what&rsquo;s similar to what.</p>
<p>How does the network see this concept or that concept?</p>
<p>And so we can look at the embeddings of colors.</p>
<p>And embeddings of colors happen to be exactly right.</p>
<p>It knows that purple is more similar to blue than to red.</p>
<p>It knows that purple is less similar to red than orange is.</p>
<p>It knows all those things just from text.</p>
<p>How can that be?</p>
<p>So if you have a vision, the distinctions between color just jump at you.</p>
<p>You immediately perceive them, whereas with text, it takes you longer.</p>
<p>Maybe you know how to talk and you already understand syntax and words and grammars.</p>
<p>And only much later you say, oh, these colors actually start to understand them.</p>
<p>So this will be my point about the necessity of multimodality, which I claim it is not</p>
<p>necessary, but it is most definitely useful.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good direction to pursue.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it in such stark either or claims.</p>
<p>So the proposal in the paper makes a claim that one of the big challenges is predicting</p>
<p>high-dimensional vectors which have uncertainty about them.</p>
<p>So for example, predicting an image, like the paper makes a very strong claim there</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a major challenge and we need to use a particular approach to address that.</p>
<p>But one thing which I found surprising or at least unacknowledged in the paper is that</p>
<p>the current autoregressive transformers already have that property.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you two examples.</p>
<p>One is given one page in a book, predict the next page in a book.</p>
<p>There could be so many possible pages that follow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complicated high-dimensional space and they deal with it just fine.</p>
<p>The same applies to images.</p>
<p>These autoregressive transformers work perfectly on images.</p>
<p>For example, like with OpenAI, we&rsquo;ve done work on the IGPT.</p>
<p>We just took the transformer and we applied it to pixels and it worked super well and</p>
<p>it could generate images in a very complicated and subtle ways.</p>
<p>It had the very beautiful unsupervised representation learning with DALI-1.</p>
<p>Same thing again.</p>
<p>Think of it as large pixels, like rather than generate a million pixels, we cluster the</p>
<p>pixels into large pixels and we generate a thousand large pixels.</p>
<p>I believe Google&rsquo;s work on image generation from earlier this year called PARTY, I believe</p>
<p>they also take a similar approach.</p>
<p>So the part where I thought that the paper made a strong comment around, well, the current</p>
<p>approaches can&rsquo;t deal with predicting high-dimensional distributions, I think they definitely can.</p>
<p>So maybe this is another point that I would make.</p>
<p>And then what you&rsquo;re talking about converting pixels into vectors, it&rsquo;s essentially turning</p>
<p>everything into language, a vector is like a string of text, right?</p>
<p>Define language though.</p>
<p>You turn it into a sequence, a sequence of what?</p>
<p>Like you could argue that even for a human life is a sequence of bits.</p>
<p>Now there are other things that people use right now, like diffusion modes, where they</p>
<p>produce those bits rather than one bit at a time, they produce them in parallel.</p>
<p>But I would argue that on some level, this distinction is immaterial.</p>
<p>I claim that on some level it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It matters as in like you can get a 10x efficiency gain, which is huge in practice, but conceptually</p>
<p>I claim it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>On this idea of having an army of human trainers that are working with chat GPT or a large</p>
<p>language model to guide it in effect with reinforcement learning, just intuitively that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound like an efficient way of teaching a model about the underlying reality of its language.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a way of automating that?</p>
<p>To Yen&rsquo;s credit, I think that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s talking about, is coming up with an algorithmic</p>
<p>means of teaching a model the underlying reality without a human having to intervene.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I have two comments on that.</p>
<p>I think, so the first place, so I have a different view on the question, so I wouldn&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with the phrasing of the question.</p>
<p>I claim that our pre-trained models already know everything they need to know about the</p>
<p>underlying reality.</p>
<p>They already have this knowledge of language and also a great deal of knowledge about the</p>
<p>processes that exist in the world that produce this language.</p>
<p>And maybe I should reiterate this point, it&rsquo;s a small tangent, but I think it&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>The thing that large generative models learn about their data, and in this case, large</p>
<p>language models about text data are some compressed representations of the real world processes</p>
<p>that produce this data, which means not only people and something about their thoughts,</p>
<p>something about their feelings, but also something about the condition that people are in and</p>
<p>the interactions that exist between them, the different situations a person can be.</p>
<p>All of these are part of that compressed process that is represented by the neural net to produce</p>
<p>the text.</p>
<p>The better the language model, the better the generative model, the higher the fidelity,</p>
<p>the better it captures this process.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first comment I will make.</p>
<p>And so in particular, I will say the models already have the knowledge.</p>
<p>Now the army of teachers, as you phrase it, indeed, when you want to build a system that</p>
<p>performs as well as possible, you just say, okay, if this thing works, do more of that.</p>
<p>But of course, those teachers are also using AI assistants.</p>
<p>Those teachers aren&rsquo;t on their own.</p>
<p>They are working with our tools together.</p>
<p>They are very efficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the tools are doing the majority of the work, but you do need to have oversight.</p>
<p>You need to have people reviewing the behavior because you want to have it to eventually</p>
<p>to achieve a very high level of reliability.</p>
<p>But overall, I&rsquo;ll say that we are at the same time, this second step after we take the finished</p>
<p>pre-trained model, and then we apply the reinforcement learning on it.</p>
<p>There is indeed a lot of motivation to make it as efficient and as precise as possible</p>
<p>so that the resulting language model will be as well-behaved as possible.</p>
<p>So yeah, there is these human teachers who are teaching them a model of desired behavior.</p>
<p>They are also using AI assistants.</p>
<p>And the manner in which they use AI assistants is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>So their own efficiency keeps increasing.</p>
<p>So maybe this will be one way to answer this question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re saying is through this process, eventually the model will become</p>
<p>more and more discerning, more and more accurate in its outputs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There is an analogy here, which is it already knows all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And now we just want to really say, no, this is not what we want.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this here.</p>
<p>You made a mistake here in the output.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s exactly as you say, with as much AI in the loop as possible.</p>
<p>So that the teachers who are providing the final correction to the system, their work</p>
<p>is amplified.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not unlike an education process, how to act well in the world.</p>
<p>We need to do additional training just to make sure that the model knows that hallucination</p>
<p>is not okay ever.</p>
<p>And then once it knows that, now you are in business.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that reinforcement learning human teacher loop that will teach it.</p>
<p>Human teacher loop or some other variant.</p>
<p>But there is definitely an argument to be made that something here should work.</p>
<p>And we will find out pretty soon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the questions.</p>
<p>Where is this going?</p>
<p>What research are you focused on right now?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t talk in detail about the specific research that I&rsquo;m working on, but I can mention</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>I can mention some of the research in broad strokes and it would be something like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in making those models more reliable, more controllable, make them</p>
<p>learn faster from less data, less instructions.</p>
<p>Make them so that indeed they don&rsquo;t hallucinate.</p>
<p>And I think that all this cluster of questions which I mentioned, they&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a question of how far in the future are we talking about in this question?</p>
<p>And what I commented here on is the perhaps nearer future.</p>
<p>You talk about the similarities between the brain and neural nets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting observation that Jeff Hinton made to me, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>new to other people, but that large models or large language models in particular hold</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of data with a modest number of parameters compared to the human</p>
<p>brain, which has trillions and trillions of parameters, but a relatively small amount</p>
<p>of data.</p>
<p>Have you thought of it in those terms?</p>
<p>And can you talk about what&rsquo;s missing in large models to have more parameters to handle</p>
<p>the data?</p>
<p>Is that a hardware problem or a training problem?</p>
<p>This comment which you made is related to one of the problems that I mentioned in the</p>
<p>earlier questions of learning from less data.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current structure of the technology does like a lot of data, especially early</p>
<p>in training.</p>
<p>Now, later in training, it becomes a bit less data hungry, which is why at the end it can</p>
<p>learn very, not as fast as people yet, but it can learn quite quickly.</p>
<p>So already that means that in some sense, do we even care that we need all this data</p>
<p>to get to this point?</p>
<p>But indeed, more generally, I think it will be possible to learn more from less data.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just, I think it requires some creative ideas, but I think it is possible.</p>
<p>And I think learning more from less data will unlock a lot of different possibilities.</p>
<p>It will allow us to teach our AIs the skills that is missing and to convey to it our desires</p>
<p>and preferences, exactly how we want it to behave more easily.</p>
<p>So I would say that faster learning is indeed very nice.</p>
<p>And although already after language models are trained, they can learn quite quickly.</p>
<p>I think there is opportunities to do more there.</p>
<p>I heard you make a comment that we need faster processors to be able to scale further.</p>
<p>And it appears that the scaling of models, that there&rsquo;s no ends in sight, but the power</p>
<p>required to train these models were reaching the limit, at least the socially accepted</p>
<p>limit.</p>
<p>So I just want to make one comment, which is, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact comment that</p>
<p>I made that you&rsquo;re referring to, but you always want faster processors.</p>
<p>Of course, you always want more of them.</p>
<p>Of course, power keeps going up.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the cost is going up.</p>
<p>And the question that I would ask is not whether the cost is large, but whether the thing that</p>
<p>we get out of paying this cost outweighs the cost.</p>
<p>Maybe you pay all this cost and you get nothing, then yeah, that&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>But if you get something very useful, something very valuable, something which can solve a</p>
<p>lot of problems that we have, which we really want solved, then the cost can be justified.</p>
<p>But in terms of the processors, faster processors, yeah, any day.</p>
<p>Are you involved at all in the hardware question?</p>
<p>Do you work with Cerebris, for example, the wafer scale chips?</p>
<p>No, all our hardware comes from Azure and the GPUs that they provide us with.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You did talk at one point, I saw, about democracy and about the impact that AI can have on democracy.</p>
<p>People have talked to me about that if you had enough data and a large enough model,</p>
<p>you could train the model on the data and it could come up with an optimal solution</p>
<p>that would satisfy everybody.</p>
<p>Do you have any aspiration or do you think about where this might lead in terms of</p>
<p>helping humans manage society?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a big question because it&rsquo;s a much more future-looking question.</p>
<p>I think that there is still many ways in which our models will become</p>
<p>far more capable than they are right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>In particular, the way we train them and use them and so on, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a few changes here and there.</p>
<p>They might not be immediately obvious today, but I think in hindsight, it will be extremely obvious</p>
<p>that will indeed allow it to have the ability to come up with solutions to problems of this kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unpredictable exactly how governments will use this technology as a source of getting advice</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>I think that to the question of democracy, one thing which I think could happen in the future</p>
<p>is that because you have these neural nets and they&rsquo;re going to be so pervasive and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be so impactful in society, we will find that it is desirable to have some kind</p>
<p>of a democratic process where let&rsquo;s say the citizens of a country provide some information</p>
<p>to the neural net about how they&rsquo;d like things to be, how they&rsquo;d like it to behave or something</p>
<p>along these lines.</p>
<p>I could imagine that happening.</p>
<p>That can be a very high bandwidth form of democracy, perhaps, where you get a lot more</p>
<p>information out of each citizen and you aggregate it to specify how exactly you want such systems</p>
<p>to act.</p>
<p>Now, it opens a whole lot of questions, but that&rsquo;s one thing that could happen in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can see in the democracy example you give that individuals would have the opportunity to</p>
<p>input data.</p>
<p>This sort of goes to the world model question.</p>
<p>Do you think AI systems will eventually be large enough that they can understand a situation</p>
<p>and analyze all of the variables?</p>
<p>But you would need a model that does more than absorb language, I would think.</p>
<p>What does it mean to analyze all the variables?</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be a choice you need to make where you say,</p>
<p>these variables seem really important.</p>
<p>I want to go deep because a person can read a book.</p>
<p>I can read a hundred books or I can read one book very slowly and carefully and get more</p>
<p>out of it.</p>
<p>There will be some element of that also.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably fundamentally impossible to understand everything in some sense.</p>
<p>Anytime there is any kind of complicated situation in society, even in a company,</p>
<p>even in a mid-sized company, it&rsquo;s already beyond the comprehension of any single individual.</p>
<p>I think that if we build our AI systems the right way,</p>
<p>I think AI could be incredibly helpful in pretty much any situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this episode.</p>
<p>I want to thank Ilya for his time.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Ellie George for helping arrange the interview.</p>
