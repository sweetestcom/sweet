<p>the the estrogen the dim mm-hm and as</p>
<p>far as I wanted to know when how long do</p>
<p>I need to wait for these hair</p>
<p>supplements are taking effect</p>
<p>I do get released from my gallbladder</p>
<p>I have no gallbladder but the</p>
<p>supplements there and the hair and nails</p>
<p>I do get that but I wanted to know how</p>
<p>long will it take for me to notice about</p>
<p>the the dim and d3 and the k2 and I also</p>
<p>have like a woman feminine problem with</p>
<p>bad breath I wanted to know what your</p>
<p>advice is or knows okay hey quick</p>
<p>question what female problem would you</p>
<p>have related to the estrogen and dim</p>
<p>would it be hot flashes or something</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>breast cancer breast cancer okay well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk about that real quick if</p>
<p>you have breast cancer it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not going to notice any</p>
<p>difference when you&rsquo;re taking it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more protective preventive so when</p>
<p>you actually balance out the bad Astra</p>
<p>j&rsquo;en you may not feel any difference so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tough one unless you have some</p>
<p>physical subjective symptom related to</p>
<p>estrogen dominance but it&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>preventative thing a lot of research on</p>
<p>it you you&rsquo;re getting some results on</p>
<p>the nails but the hair I think you said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some patches I just have one</p>
<p>question do you have any acid reflux</p>
<p>sometimes sometimes okay so so you</p>
<p>mentioned the joint formula how long</p>
<p>does it take to work what what knee is a</p>
<p>problem left or right it&rsquo;s the left knee</p>
<p>I have a they said I need to have a knee</p>
<p>replacement I&rsquo;m bone-on-bone okay and</p>
<p>then I have also have the it feels like</p>
<p>the pain is coming from my right groin</p>
<p>but they say it&rsquo;s the hip but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need replacement yet okay yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a compensation so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things you want to do Michelle</p>
<p>you got bone on bone I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on my eating plan perfectly there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>cheating I&rsquo;m just assuming that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably true if you&rsquo;re not really get</p>
<p>back on it because that will reduce</p>
<p>inflammation now here&rsquo;s the data on the</p>
<p>joint thing it if you have bone and bone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna you&rsquo;re gonna have to add some</p>
<p>other techniques for example if you</p>
<p>search knee pain on YouTube there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>videos that I have one is part one part</p>
<p>two I would follow that because you want</p>
<p>to be working on the right thigh and the</p>
<p>hamstring and the outer part of your</p>
<p>thigh so you&rsquo;re gonna massage the right</p>
<p>side that&rsquo;s gonna take the pressure off</p>
<p>the left knee and then in addition I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s gonna help balance because</p>
<p>if you have bone and bone and your left</p>
<p>knee you&rsquo;ve been kind of your gate has</p>
<p>been asymmetrical and you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>supporting the rights more on the</p>
<p>muscles on the right side so you have to</p>
<p>balance it out that will really bring</p>
<p>down the pain because if you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that you may not fully get the benefit</p>
<p>of the joint formula joint formula takes</p>
<p>some time especially since it has a very</p>
<p>specific type of collagen that helps</p>
<p>rebuild ligaments and tendons and part</p>
<p>of the meniscus in there so it will help</p>
<p>that now the other thing is that you</p>
<p>have bad breath what I would do the</p>
<p>first thing I would start to acidify</p>
<p>your stomach start adding more upset of</p>
<p>vinegar you can either get into tablets</p>
<p>or just in the water and dilute that and</p>
<p>start drinking that because if we drop</p>
<p>your pH you&rsquo;ll get a better digestion of</p>
<p>protein which will be less waste from</p>
<p>your protein and</p>
<p>that will improve things the other thing</p>
<p>with bad breath is it&rsquo;s more of a gut</p>
<p>problem so you also want to add</p>
<p>fermented vegetables like sauerkraut</p>
<p>pickles start building that up and maybe</p>
<p>even some kefir over time that should</p>
<p>help kind of deodorize the breath all</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>thanks Michelle hey Tina you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air you&rsquo;re from New Jersey go ahead yeah</p>
<p>and I wanna god bless you for helping</p>
<p>added now my question is I have you been</p>
<p>feeling good for nine years now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like off and on and on I went to</p>
<p>emergency with my big test after test</p>
<p>colonoscopy got serology I want to get</p>
<p>ology I want to cardiologists I did it</p>
<p>all but they can&rsquo;t find what is wrong</p>
<p>with me I feel weak you know my body</p>
<p>feels weak sometimes my legs few weeks</p>
<p>like a chumpy attacking my new system I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what it is and that&rsquo;s kinda</p>
<p>what it is too</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just wondering if you can tell me</p>
<p>what it is and what to do please</p>
<p>okay Tina um let me just kind of narrow</p>
<p>in real quickly to see if I can help you</p>
<p>because it could be a million different</p>
<p>reasons so I have a question are you</p>
<p>doing the eating plan in my videos</p>
<p>perfectly or are you kind of partially</p>
<p>doing it no I I do this by my side like</p>
<p>a vegetable I still you know and it</p>
<p>comes all of it whatever I talk to my</p>
<p>body all of it buddy okay so when you</p>
<p>say attack your body do you mean you</p>
<p>have inflammation to somewhere all of a</p>
<p>sudden my body will feel weak my legs</p>
<p>feel weak that&rsquo;s how I feel I get panic</p>
<p>I guess yeah you know like panic okay</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s a couple things I would</p>
<p>jump right into number one again it</p>
<p>could be many things the thing that I</p>
<p>would start first is there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>b-vitamin symptoms that you have I would</p>
<p>do b12 and B one may</p>
<p>be six but if you take nutritional yeast</p>
<p>and you take a tablespoon or two per day</p>
<p>that will normally relieve those</p>
<p>symptoms that you told me if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe what you can do is fill out the</p>
<p>evaluation quiz on my side it&rsquo;s a free</p>
<p>thing and then we can kind of analyze it</p>
<p>based in everything because I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>need a little bit of your history and</p>
<p>ask you a lot of in-depth questions but</p>
<p>right now I think it&rsquo;s the B vitamin</p>
<p>deficiency primarily b12 b6 and be one</p>
<p>of those vitamins can make you feel weak</p>
<p>anxiety kind of you know when you get up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of out of breath yeah so go</p>
<p>ahead and do that and then let let us</p>
<p>know hey Vanessa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from California go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air thank you for taking my call</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following up on some of the things</p>
<p>that you prescribed or your advice to</p>
<p>take the last time and also have</p>
<p>question related to the adrenal gland</p>
<p>related symptom so the instrument look</p>
<p>low cost cord and a gall bladder and</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar those are the three</p>
<p>things I start taking about two weeks</p>
<p>now and I just wanted to know how long</p>
<p>do I go on with this and the dosage to</p>
<p>take up the seemed to be different from</p>
<p>the label up on the box versus what you</p>
<p>show on your video so I just want to</p>
<p>know for that what are the top what are</p>
<p>the top two symptoms that you have I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pre-diabetic and and I feel like the</p>
<p>gall bladder fits in that description</p>
<p>for the liver problem in all that</p>
<p>horrible and adrenal problems do you</p>
<p>have a gallbladder yes I do I&rsquo;m 56 and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pre-diabetic two years ago</p>
<p>condition wise and not just the main</p>
<p>thing and then of course I came with the</p>
<p>migraine headaches from the two years</p>
<p>ago as well okay all right Vanessa so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the general answer to that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always a good question how long</p>
<p>do I take supplements it really depends</p>
<p>on how bad your problem is before you</p>
<p>get started you know obviously if you</p>
<p>have a pre-diabetic it takes 10 years to</p>
<p>become a pre died</p>
<p>Vanek so insulin resistance takes time</p>
<p>so you know you want to give it a chance</p>
<p>to help the nutrition rejuvenate you for</p>
<p>example the insulin and glucose support</p>
<p>has like ten different things that</p>
<p>support the pancreas and blood sugars so</p>
<p>you may be on that for a bit it could be</p>
<p>more than four or five months but the</p>
<p>the goal is to get you to a point where</p>
<p>those symptoms are improving if you have</p>
<p>a test an a1c test and it comes down</p>
<p>real low to the low fives then we know</p>
<p>you hey you&rsquo;re stable and then you can</p>
<p>start weaning off some of these things</p>
<p>and then see how you do so it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>test it&rsquo;s like okay take it out see if</p>
<p>you actually are able to hold that</p>
<p>because that you&rsquo;re right the goal is to</p>
<p>try to get is the most nutrition from</p>
<p>your diet without having to rely on a</p>
<p>supplement but if there&rsquo;s long term</p>
<p>chronic liver damage if there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>gallbladder then you&rsquo;re gonna need some</p>
<p>type of long-term support nutritionally</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also it&rsquo;s really hard to get</p>
<p>certain nutrients from the food like</p>
<p>trace minerals so those are more of a</p>
<p>long-term thing as a way to enhance your</p>
<p>health so really with you I think I</p>
<p>would probably maybe another a month or</p>
<p>two start weaning off some of the stuff</p>
<p>and see how you do you might be able to</p>
<p>go without the gallbladder go without</p>
<p>the insulin but it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to test because</p>
<p>that it could be from way over here some</p>
<p>people need for like 1 month other</p>
<p>people need it for like a year so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to answer that we just have</p>
<p>to test the waters all right thanks</p>
<p>Vanessa</p>
<p>diddy you&rsquo;re from New York City you have</p>
<p>a question go ahead oh yeah I do</p>
<p>good morning so I have a question</p>
<p>regarding caffeine withdrawals I mean a</p>
<p>couple of weeks now go and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>drinking we saw a child approximately 2</p>
<p>milligrams of caffeine per cup so I</p>
<p>realized that I get massive withdrawal</p>
<p>symptoms which included actually almost</p>
<p>had to go to emergency room two weeks</p>
<p>ago so I found you online and then I</p>
<p>absolutely bought the adrenal package</p>
<p>now I am reading well I continue to</p>
<p>research what&rsquo;s going on and what I see</p>
<p>here is for example there are doctors</p>
<p>writing online that some of the</p>
<p>components which are in the adrenal de</p>
<p>package actually also might be a</p>
<p>distance such as ashwagandha for example</p>
<p>so I wondered because I want to get rid</p>
<p>of all substances that might be</p>
<p>addictive</p>
<p>you know yeah because I don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>with any addiction so I wanted to hear</p>
<p>any of your comments regarding it good</p>
<p>good question let&rsquo;s talk about that like</p>
<p>even some people don&rsquo;t want to become</p>
<p>addicted to laksa tips right so they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take a laxative so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about caffeine caffeine is addicting it</p>
<p>gives you a sense of well-being</p>
<p>alertness if your body is so used to it</p>
<p>because it has to raise the adrenal it</p>
<p>has to activate the adrenal what happens</p>
<p>is that you cut that out that caffeine</p>
<p>also the adrenals go crash and burn and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need something to bring you</p>
<p>up so I always tell people to do a</p>
<p>gradual weaning off and then eventually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go cold turkey add the tea in</p>
<p>their tea house just a little tiny bit</p>
<p>of caffeine and you can start doing tea</p>
<p>for awhile and and then eventually just</p>
<p>like you know cut it completely out over</p>
<p>a period of some months but if you have</p>
<p>that many withdrawals your adrenal needs</p>
<p>some serious help</p>
<p>ashwagandha is not addictive in fact I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know of any herb that is addictive</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s from nature mainly</p>
<p>addictions are you know caffeine</p>
<p>nicotine drugs that type of thing so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know a lot of times on the</p>
<p>Internet you see all sorts of things</p>
<p>that are just totally false</p>
<p>ashwagandha gives a sense of relaxation</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s meant to kind of help the</p>
<p>adrenal so you as you start working on</p>
<p>the adrenals start eating better start</p>
<p>sleeping better the need for that will</p>
<p>go down but to be addicted to an herb is</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s not true so I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be fine in that but let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>talk about one more point in that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you had a laxative which is herbal</p>
<p>versus constipation and you can</p>
<p>turn about becoming dependent on</p>
<p>laxatives well the damage of not going</p>
<p>and being constipated is huge auto</p>
<p>intoxication poison flowed into the body</p>
<p>bad so it&rsquo;s much better to keep taking</p>
<p>the laxatives keeping the bowels going</p>
<p>until that&rsquo;s you get that thing</p>
<p>corrected so we just have to look at</p>
<p>relative importance &ndash;is is it important</p>
<p>to keep the stress off your body lower</p>
<p>cortisol using Austral ganda absolutely</p>
<p>so versus any type of possible</p>
<p>addictions i have never in 27 years</p>
<p>heard of anyone that&rsquo;s addicted to</p>
<p>ashwagandha so so i don&rsquo;t think you have</p>
<p>to worry about that so i think you doing</p>
<p>fine just do a gradual thing over a</p>
<p>period of time and some people need to</p>
<p>be on a little tiny caffeine for you</p>
<p>know months before they can come off but</p>
<p>the goal is to greatly reduce it like</p>
<p>one like a small cup of coffee in the</p>
<p>morning usually will not create much</p>
<p>damage to people so i wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>stressing about too much about that but</p>
<p>caffeine does tend to deplete B vitamins</p>
<p>thanks didi</p>
<p>okay so Vanessa Europe from new drew new</p>
<p>york go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi my question i have two one about</p>
<p>probiotics the one about iron the one on</p>
<p>probiotics is every time i take</p>
<p>probiotics because my doctor told me i</p>
<p>need them</p>
<p>my heart beats really rapidly and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure what&rsquo;s causing that why that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening why is that the reaction</p>
<p>mm-hmm okay and the second question I</p>
<p>was recently diagnosed with anemia but</p>
<p>for the last 10 years my hair has like</p>
<p>gradually broken off and the doctor is</p>
<p>now saying it&rsquo;s anemia but I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>operated at like 11 which is within the</p>
<p>normal range 11.1 that&rsquo;s always been my</p>
<p>normal iron range so how much higher</p>
<p>would you think I would have to go to be</p>
<p>normal if our if at that normal range or</p>
<p>a quote-unquote normal range my hair</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fall about and everything okay</p>
<p>did do you have any type of indication</p>
<p>that that anemia is coming from b12</p>
<p>deficiency or do they know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>iron deficiency</p>
<p>they did my ferritin levels and me</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually guessing they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know but I have in the past I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like fainted and have fainting spells</p>
<p>and different things so the doctor is</p>
<p>now assuming it could be iron</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve taken beats my b12 test they</p>
<p>said I was okay but they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know they really do seem to be guessing</p>
<p>because you know obviously your hair is</p>
<p>falling out</p>
<p>something is wrong right and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just send me away any more right now</p>
<p>what about your do you have any</p>
<p>indication of what could be causing and</p>
<p>could it be excessive men&rsquo;s menstruation</p>
<p>do you have any type of problems with</p>
<p>stomach like your indigestion or gas or</p>
<p>heartburn I was diagnosed was also</p>
<p>having fibroids but with the fibroids</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m although does cause heavy</p>
<p>bleeding for the whole course of the</p>
<p>month it doesn&rsquo;t really matter when they</p>
<p>took my blood test it was still the same</p>
<p>at eleven point one for my iron so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really sure okay all right</p>
<p>so the first question is probiotics and</p>
<p>heartbeat and let&rsquo;s talk about that the</p>
<p>probiotics tend to increase lactic</p>
<p>lactobacillus microbe these microbes</p>
<p>make lactic acid so sometimes when you</p>
<p>take them and it makes just a little bit</p>
<p>too much lactic acid your pH slightly</p>
<p>goes more acidic which is actually going</p>
<p>down that up so when the pH is more</p>
<p>acidic it does tend to increase the</p>
<p>heart rate a little bit so what I would</p>
<p>do with the probiotic is I would take</p>
<p>less and take take it at different parts</p>
<p>of the day maybe take in the morning</p>
<p>verses before night and just see how you</p>
<p>do but you need the probiotic but the</p>
<p>point is that I think it&rsquo;s altering your</p>
<p>ph a little too much and sometimes some</p>
<p>of the probiotics people are sensitive</p>
<p>to because they&rsquo;re Dairy related and</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t even have an allergy to</p>
<p>Dairy so if that&rsquo;s the case you can get</p>
<p>a non-dairy probiotic okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number one number two the anemia thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of that a lot more</p>
<p>to this I&rsquo;ll have to create a video on</p>
<p>this but there&rsquo;s a couple things that if</p>
<p>you have a fibroid even though your iron</p>
<p>levels test normal in the body you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually having a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>blood that&rsquo;s stored in a fibroid so look</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a tumor which can create a lack of</p>
<p>blood in other places but it might not</p>
<p>show low iron in your blood so the point</p>
<p>is that fibroids come from too much</p>
<p>estrogen estrogen dominance so the</p>
<p>estrogen balance and dim would be a good</p>
<p>option and also adding more cruciferous</p>
<p>to actually counter that probably some</p>
<p>good sea kelp</p>
<p>Icelandic sea kelp would also help lower</p>
<p>estrogen so that&rsquo;s one thing the other</p>
<p>thing that you might want to look at is</p>
<p>just increasing the acid in your stomach</p>
<p>and that would be with betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>that will instantly increase the</p>
<p>absorption and function of your iron the</p>
<p>last thing with iron is that if people</p>
<p>are vegans or vegetarians and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming a lot of vegetables for their</p>
<p>iron there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not prepared correctly</p>
<p>or you know you&rsquo;re not germinating them</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not soaking in water and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing with that you&rsquo;re gonna have high</p>
<p>levels of phytic acid and that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to block iron so that&rsquo;s probably not the</p>
<p>case in your situation but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing I always look at thanks</p>
<p>Vanessa</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s Michelle I think from Virginia</p>
<p>you had a question go ahead and and um I</p>
<p>called a while back about too big and</p>
<p>you recommended to seek help and was the</p>
<p>IMD yeah and I just wanted to make ask</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve also having like excess</p>
<p>facial hair issues and I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>know if eating those two would increase</p>
<p>it more and I also wanted to ask what</p>
<p>your recommended dose for the seek help</p>
<p>and dentists and if there are any</p>
<p>natural brands that you recommend okay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting facial hair though right</p>
<p>yeah okay so the fact that your facial</p>
<p>hair is probably a little bit of PCOS or</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome going on</p>
<p>which is basically high androgens so</p>
<p>the seek help and the estrogen balance</p>
<p>with dim that I think I&rsquo;ve recommended</p>
<p>those are two natural products I have a</p>
<p>seek out from Iceland which is organic</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the site and an estrogen</p>
<p>balance with Jim both of those do not</p>
<p>increase androgens what they do is they</p>
<p>help balance the estrogen and the button</p>
<p>your existing body to get rid of some of</p>
<p>the bad and increase the good ratios</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s one thing that they do</p>
<p>but typically PCOS high antigens come</p>
<p>from either an overactive adrenal gland</p>
<p>which is stress or high levels of</p>
<p>insulin which if you&rsquo;re on my eating</p>
<p>program that I&rsquo;m recommending over and</p>
<p>over and over and over that could be</p>
<p>beneficial because if we can lower</p>
<p>insulin you&rsquo;ll get less conversion to</p>
<p>androgens because increase insulin</p>
<p>converts to androgen and then that will</p>
<p>cause the facial hair so again those are</p>
<p>the two products sea kelp Icelandic</p>
<p>estrogen balance plus dim and then get</p>
<p>on the eating plan to lower your insulin</p>
<p>or fix the insulin resistance that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do all right hey Traci</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Chicago you had a question</p>
<p>go ahead uh yes I do um I I believe I</p>
<p>had the adrenal body type I believe I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>estrogen dominant I had was struggling</p>
<p>with fibroids for years which resulted</p>
<p>in me having to have a hysterectomy and</p>
<p>they also removed my ovaries and I was</p>
<p>not in menopause yet so it threw me into</p>
<p>immediate menopause and now my body</p>
<p>composition over the past two years my</p>
<p>muscles have like disintegrated I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gained 25 pounds by pulled back you know</p>
<p>composition has completely changed and</p>
<p>the doctor put me on estradiol</p>
<p>and I also saw who listed me who told me</p>
<p>you know not to take estradiol so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking for your advice and I also have</p>
<p>like the low average bone density for my</p>
<p>age</p>
<p>similarly to excuse and say what I</p>
<p>should do to get this do I take this or</p>
<p>or not okay Tracy let me let me show you</p>
<p>hey mr. producer I&rsquo;m gonna go to the</p>
<p>board and draw a little thing for you so</p>
<p>you can see this alright so here the o</p>
<p>breeze here&rsquo;s the uterus</p>
<p>you had these removed okay you need to</p>
<p>go find them and get them back now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good now you have two adrenals there on</p>
<p>top of your kidney okay and the adrenal</p>
<p>is a backup organ for these organs</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the backup it produces the same</p>
<p>hormones so the fact that you had these</p>
<p>removed make the made the adrenal glands</p>
<p>increase in function they had to work</p>
<p>harder if your adrenal glands are tired</p>
<p>going into this situation they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already existing weak and you remove</p>
<p>this and forced the adrenals to work</p>
<p>harder it&rsquo;s gonna throw off your</p>
<p>hormones it&rsquo;s going to put stress on the</p>
<p>hormones and create all sorts of</p>
<p>symptoms with cortisol you know estrogen</p>
<p>deficiencies and you name it the doctors</p>
<p>then come in and give you estrogen which</p>
<p>by the way the adrenal gland makes so it</p>
<p>causes the adrenal gland not to have to</p>
<p>produce that because you&rsquo;re taking it so</p>
<p>what you really should do if you have</p>
<p>these organs removed is support the</p>
<p>adrenal nutritionally not the hormones</p>
<p>not taking a hormone but to support the</p>
<p>gland with with glandular extracts</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that I have that</p>
<p>do that one is the it used to be called</p>
<p>the adrenal night formula but now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a sleep aid regular because it</p>
<p>has adrenal extracts in it and it</p>
<p>actually supports the adrenal so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing and also the adrenal and</p>
<p>cortisol relief also supports the</p>
<p>adrenal and then start doing maybe even</p>
<p>some acupressure on the adrenals so look</p>
<p>that up I have a lot of data on that and</p>
<p>then start to sur</p>
<p>adrenal what to eat and focus on that so</p>
<p>the dreamless need a little more protein</p>
<p>they need a lot of potassium foods they</p>
<p>need they need more fat because that</p>
<p>builds up the adrenal hormones but does</p>
<p>not need low fat it needs low intensity</p>
<p>exercise walking long walks reducing</p>
<p>stress better sleep that type of thing</p>
<p>but the point is that this is a long</p>
<p>answer to you need to support the</p>
<p>adrenals that&rsquo;s pretty much the quick</p>
<p>answer to that and let me plug back in</p>
<p>here okay great</p>
<p>hope that helped Tracy okay so naive is</p>
<p>it Nazz how do you pronounce your form</p>
<p>yeah okay yeah okay yeah actually one</p>
<p>year old and I didn&rsquo;t have gallbladder</p>
<p>but according to native videos that I</p>
<p>was watching I&rsquo;d like to take comedy in</p>
<p>tights to for my knee pain and also</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m losing my hair I want to</p>
<p>take the type one for my here and I was</p>
<p>wondering if I think those two together</p>
<p>is it like okay and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>recommended dosage and what kind of</p>
<p>collagen like me when I go online there</p>
<p>are too many kind fish animals and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what one is organic on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not and the recommended dosage some of</p>
<p>them are 40 milligrams I&rsquo;m okay Matt</p>
<p>Raney right okay good question so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things there are certain</p>
<p>types of collagen for hair there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain type of collagen for rebuilding</p>
<p>knee joints and other joints with</p>
<p>cartilage and tendons and ligaments I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have any opinion on any</p>
<p>other brands because I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many brands out there but the</p>
<p>brands that I use I use a joint pain</p>
<p>formula that has very specific healing</p>
<p>and rejuvenating collagen building</p>
<p>properties for not just the joints but</p>
<p>for the ligaments and tendons so it</p>
<p>helps rejuvenate that and helps build</p>
<p>that up but that&rsquo;s not the only thing</p>
<p>because a lot of times you might not</p>
<p>miss</p>
<p>missing collagen you might have an</p>
<p>inflammatory condition so in that</p>
<p>formula I put the best anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>herbs stinging on a root there is also</p>
<p>MSM there&rsquo;s just a whole bunch of</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory natural things that I</p>
<p>recommend is called joint pain formula</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s for your joints it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a very comprehensive hormone for the</p>
<p>hair I recommend the hair formula simply</p>
<p>because it has the collagen and has</p>
<p>things in there for autoimmune like</p>
<p>alopecia it has the natural B vitamins</p>
<p>it has the trace minerals that has</p>
<p>silica but they&rsquo;re all in a food base</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not synthetic so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to recommend for your hair but it</p>
<p>goes beyond just collagen it goes into</p>
<p>the nutrients that help collagen stick</p>
<p>and form in the body alright hey Joanne</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Toronto go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air hi dr. Berg thank you for taking</p>
<p>my call and thanks for your show sure my</p>
<p>question for you is I&rsquo;m 47 I still have</p>
<p>a regular cycle going on every month</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been low-carb for about a year and</p>
<p>a half with great results and I exercise</p>
<p>which is running about twice a week and</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s been great feeling wise</p>
<p>except for lately I&rsquo;ve noticed during</p>
<p>certain times of the month I get a</p>
<p>shortness of breath and I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had my heart checked I&rsquo;ve had an</p>
<p>ultrasound done on my thyroid and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been given of course anxiety medication</p>
<p>from my doctor because that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>thought it was but um I&rsquo;ve read a few</p>
<p>reports online from other women who have</p>
<p>been going through this also and a lot</p>
<p>of them are saying that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>progesterone related so I just wanted</p>
<p>your thoughts on that and to see what</p>
<p>what my options might be yeah hey John</p>
<p>and again anything that I recommend</p>
<p>check with your doctor I&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>diagnose or say I can cure any problems</p>
<p>okay so just want to make that noise no</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the question I have what part</p>
<p>of your cycle do you notice these</p>
<p>symptoms is it day 14 is it right</p>
<p>in the period when is it well</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m because I&rsquo;m just starting to</p>
<p>track it now actually yeah it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>hard to stay but for this month so far</p>
<p>yes I did notice it starting just</p>
<p>shortly after ovulation okay I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how long that&rsquo;s going to take me</p>
<p>until like I said I&rsquo;m still trying to</p>
<p>track it and figure out exactly when</p>
<p>this is happening but I do think there</p>
<p>is some type of pattern because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>and in some weeks I&rsquo;m fine and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just hit me again god I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>for help</p>
<p>well let me just let me just cut you off</p>
<p>there and I&rsquo;m gonna show you oh my gosh</p>
<p>I just dropped around the call sorry so</p>
<p>but let me just show you on the board</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;ll be watching on your</p>
<p>computer and but let&rsquo;s just take a look</p>
<p>at this right here</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your menstrual cycle day 14 is</p>
<p>when you ovulate okay that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>egg gets released and then we have day</p>
<p>28 here when you start your period so</p>
<p>what happens I always like to see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>date coincidence what happens just</p>
<p>before at day 14 guess what you spiked</p>
<p>estrogen okay and then about a week</p>
<p>before your period used ice spiked</p>
<p>progesterone so if you&rsquo;re getting these</p>
<p>symptoms right after ovulation right</p>
<p>about here I&rsquo;m gonna say that your</p>
<p>progesterone is probably too low or</p>
<p>yesterday is too high one way to bring</p>
<p>the estrogen down since your menopause</p>
<p>going through menopause we have a</p>
<p>situation where estrogen does decrease</p>
<p>but so does progesterone but</p>
<p>progesterone really drops even more than</p>
<p>estrogen giving you a situation where</p>
<p>your estrogen dominant so because the</p>
<p>ratios because the progesterone that</p>
<p>protects you against too much estrogen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a counter hormone so</p>
<p>you could correct this by taking more</p>
<p>progesterone okay so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>no-brainer but you didn&rsquo;t really correct</p>
<p>it you just kind of patched it up if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 47 going through menopause what</p>
<p>you want to do is you want to support</p>
<p>the back-up organ which is</p>
<p>your adrenals so we&rsquo;re back to the</p>
<p>adrenals again and that will naturally</p>
<p>kind of balance things out but if you</p>
<p>wanted a quick fix go ahead and take</p>
<p>some progesterone cream and that will</p>
<p>knock out the symptoms simply because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to that specific problem</p>
<p>all right sorry I&rsquo;d knocked you knocked</p>
<p>you off but okay so now Nancy you have a</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;re from Alabama go ahead</p>
<p>hey dr. Barry first of all thank you so</p>
<p>much for the information you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>out there learning so much from what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re giving us and I&rsquo;m on your</p>
<p>ketogenic diet of about you know 7080</p>
<p>percent good fat intake and moderate</p>
<p>protein low carb with the high</p>
<p>vegetables and I&rsquo;m logging it all on an</p>
<p>app and I&rsquo;m on about Bay twelve here and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s maybe a</p>
<p>recommendation with the Grahams maybe</p>
<p>for a fat feel like I might be taking in</p>
<p>too much fat even though I&rsquo;m on mark</p>
<p>with the percentages still wondering if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just taking in a few months yeah</p>
<p>okay good question answer you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really difficult to give you a grandmom</p>
<p>out because it can range from this many</p>
<p>grams of this many grams the best thing</p>
<p>to think about is to the principle of a</p>
<p>try and eat your fats in a whole form</p>
<p>unfortunately just like refined</p>
<p>carbohydrates you do have refined fats</p>
<p>which you know normally even even oils</p>
<p>and butter and these other fats and even</p>
<p>coconut oil is out of the natural food</p>
<p>base complex now it doesn&rsquo;t cause harm</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nutrition in those but</p>
<p>just realize they&rsquo;re out of the normal</p>
<p>complex so that&rsquo;s one of the biggest</p>
<p>some things we&rsquo;re starting a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet is being able to digest those fats</p>
<p>initially because you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>enzymes of the gallbladder help from the</p>
<p>bile to be able to break them down so I</p>
<p>would very simply just cut it way down</p>
<p>see how you feel is it working are you</p>
<p>getting rid of the symptoms of insulin</p>
<p>resistance are you more satisfied after</p>
<p>a meal can you go longer without crave</p>
<p>and a drop in blood sugar does the way</p>
<p>coming off in the midsection okay use</p>
<p>your hunger a drop being down those are</p>
<p>all the key factors so right at the end</p>
<p>of the meal the the real big reason I</p>
<p>would increase fat is to be able to go</p>
<p>longer between meals but I would just</p>
<p>start lowering it and see how you how</p>
<p>you do and not worry about the grams but</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t go out of your way to add a</p>
<p>lot of fat try to have the whole food</p>
<p>like an avocado or maybe coconut with</p>
<p>the fat or peanut butter or something</p>
<p>like that or brie cheese and then see</p>
<p>how you do with that all right</p>
<p>hey Miriam you&rsquo;re from London go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air very informative so</p>
<p>thank you I actually am over four years</p>
<p>old I am taking because I I suffer</p>
<p>hypothyroid I am the micrograms of</p>
<p>levothyroxine and I discovered because</p>
<p>of your channel I take in apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar I got it taking it well I was</p>
<p>wondering if series if it&rsquo;s good or</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m thinking this medicine I was</p>
<p>wondering because recently maybe two</p>
<p>weeks ago I feel very weak I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>why yeah this is my opinion most</p>
<p>hypothyroid problems are secondary to</p>
<p>either a gall bladder or liver issue or</p>
<p>high estrogen okay so apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar does increase the release of</p>
<p>bile so that&rsquo;s supposed to increase the</p>
<p>conversion but you may need some bile</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>I call it bile the the gall bladder</p>
<p>formula which will then increase more</p>
<p>bile and help more conversion from t4 to</p>
<p>t3 okay so see if you that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>okay and also look at do you</p>
<p>any symptoms of gallbladder and you</p>
<p>should watch my videos to find that out</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not the case let&rsquo;s look at</p>
<p>estrogen are you a sergeant dominant now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going on your 40s he possibly</p>
<p>could be pre menopausal which could</p>
<p>increase the estrogen because the it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I said before the pedestrian goes</p>
<p>way too low so you may be getting better</p>
<p>results by lowering your ratios by</p>
<p>probably taking the estrogen balance</p>
<p>plus dim or supporting the adrenals so</p>
<p>those are the two things that I would</p>
<p>look at instantly just to see if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get results because the goal is to</p>
<p>find the real reason why you have the</p>
<p>low thyroid you know why you have that</p>
<p>some people also then just need a little</p>
<p>seek help to increase iodine and bones</p>
<p>thyroid goes right back in but again go</p>
<p>ahead keep taking medication but fine</p>
<p>try to experiment to see what else could</p>
<p>improve the thyroid see you eventually</p>
<p>can come off that men all right hey</p>
<p>Brenda you&rsquo;re from New York go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air yeah hi good money</p>
<p>about that birth weight I did call you</p>
<p>last week man I still have a problem</p>
<p>with my digestion I have to question</p>
<p>after food even I don&rsquo;t have a diabetic</p>
<p>in my life but I do check my blood sugar</p>
<p>in morning when I wake up and I do check</p>
<p>my sugar level every morning when I wake</p>
<p>up what is the digital meat in one</p>
<p>finger and to another finger because one</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re reading is different we made</p>
<p>a finger usually I&rsquo;m always in a 68 to</p>
<p>75 in the morning but because I want to</p>
<p>be more healthy just I follow whatever</p>
<p>low carb depletes us in the YouTube you</p>
<p>know so I&rsquo;ll find out when I consume</p>
<p>more vegetable compared to the lower</p>
<p>eating the rice and cookies that I got</p>
<p>more higher sugar level what does it go</p>
<p>to burn no ha ha how high will it go</p>
<p>when you eat more vegetables when I it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defensible it&rsquo;s causing me very very</p>
<p>bloating I sometimes go out and then</p>
<p>when I check my blood sugar even though</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat rice in a day or any any any</p>
<p>cop it</p>
<p>ninety-eight in the morning sometimes</p>
<p>hundreds okay and then but it if I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume that maths festival my sugar</p>
<p>level going down to 68 to 70 again like</p>
<p>today like three days ago I check I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you because I was throwing</p>
<p>out of too much of my stomach I stop it</p>
<p>I stop it and then my sugar level going</p>
<p>down very but like before we just make</p>
<p>me very happy right Brendan Brendan</p>
<p>question a question do you know what</p>
<p>normal blood pressure is what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>normal blood I&rsquo;m sorry blood glucose</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the normal blood sugar okay</p>
<p>alright then thanks let me just answer</p>
<p>this real quick this is an easy one it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah we need to eat more vegetables but</p>
<p>your problem is you&rsquo;re not digesting</p>
<p>those fibers and the vegetables and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s creating the bloating the</p>
<p>bloating will create stress the stress</p>
<p>will activate coral the coral will</p>
<p>increase the blood sugars you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>within the normal range but I think you</p>
<p>need to either consume different</p>
<p>vegetables that you can digest like some</p>
<p>type of lettuce that is like not part of</p>
<p>the cruciferous or fermented vegetables</p>
<p>okay and I think that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to go right now because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>enzymes to digest it because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain microbes missing so just cut</p>
<p>down on the best the type of vegetables</p>
<p>that blow you until there&rsquo;s no more</p>
<p>bloating and I think that will solve it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not too concerned about the</p>
<p>blood sugar because it&rsquo;s still below a</p>
<p>hundred but 68 to 70 it could be normal</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in ketosis</p>
<p>but yeah even it goes up to one hundred</p>
<p>is still fine okay thanks hey Jonathan</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Oregon go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air</p>
<p>hey Jonathan are you there yes good</p>
<p>morning dr. Berg thank you very much my</p>
<p>question is not really to do with</p>
<p>illness but to do with health I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>studying your material over the last</p>
<p>month and I&rsquo;m very very grateful for it</p>
<p>two to two questions one just very</p>
<p>general about why aren&rsquo;t more</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s adopting this kind of a</p>
<p>approach I have 64 years of retraining</p>
<p>my mind from all that I&rsquo;ve you know</p>
<p>learnt over the years and that that kind</p>
<p>of retrain of mine takes some doing</p>
<p>secondly I I we started 192 pounds I</p>
<p>have a goal of getting to 160 but it</p>
<p>occurs to me that I don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what what goal at all</p>
<p>I should have I&rsquo;m 5 foot 6 in height but</p>
<p>and I wonder what your views will be of</p>
<p>what height you can get to and I suppose</p>
<p>my third question is I haven&rsquo;t heard a</p>
<p>lot about exercise with the ketosis diet</p>
<p>so thank you</p>
<p>ok great Jonathan let&rsquo;s take the first</p>
<p>question governments are composed of</p>
<p>large groups of people not just one</p>
<p>person and because of that they are the</p>
<p>last group to come on board with a new</p>
<p>idea so that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re always the</p>
<p>last in fact if you want some truthful</p>
<p>information find out what the</p>
<p>governments are doing and do the exact</p>
<p>opposite and you&rsquo;ll probably very very</p>
<p>successful ok because they&rsquo;re always way</p>
<p>behind of the current research it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>political as well and ok second question</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 192 you want to get to one of</p>
<p>these six but you&rsquo;re not sure if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the right thing well it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really going to be tricky because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t really see you I can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>your bone structure I can&rsquo;t see your</p>
<p>shape every shape is different the goal</p>
<p>is not necessarily a weight goal but how</p>
<p>you look maybe body fat that would be a</p>
<p>better goal and how your shape is you</p>
<p>know your muscular content you know do</p>
<p>you as your belly flat do you do you</p>
<p>feel good about the way you look and the</p>
<p>overall health you have the energy do</p>
<p>you have the vitality how is your</p>
<p>sleeping how&rsquo;s your stress level I think</p>
<p>that would be a better goal and then if</p>
<p>you can achieve that you will always</p>
<p>find that the weight goes to where you</p>
<p>need to be third question I just</p>
<p>released a video yesterday on exercise</p>
<p>and keep ptosis so you can watch that</p>
<p>but the I think you brought up a really</p>
<p>good point because I want to bring this</p>
<p>up this is um there&rsquo;s this whole dogma</p>
<p>with exercise that you go through this</p>
<p>thing called a bunk which you actually</p>
<p>hit a wall because you run out of your</p>
<p>stored sugar it&rsquo;s called glycogen in</p>
<p>your muscle and then the muscle just</p>
<p>gets fatigued and you can&rsquo;t go anymore</p>
<p>so then we need to do carbo loading and</p>
<p>we need to add more carbs or sugar</p>
<p>before during and after an athletic</p>
<p>marathon or endurance race or even some</p>
<p>type of exercise right well there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>some recent research that I have in the</p>
<p>video that shows that if you key to</p>
<p>adapt which means you do this over a</p>
<p>period of months like in you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>athlete you will not only have better</p>
<p>performance but you will burn more than</p>
<p>two times the amount of fat as the</p>
<p>person consuming the sugar in other</p>
<p>words your body your muscles can run on</p>
<p>fat efficiently once you key to adapt</p>
<p>but if you take an athlete and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t key to adapt let&rsquo;s say they do</p>
<p>this in like two or three weeks and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not adapted they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>enzymes to burn the fat so they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>crash and burn 85% of your body can run</p>
<p>on fat fuel and the rest that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dependent on glucose like part a part of</p>
<p>the brain part of the kidney part of the</p>
<p>eye and the sperm and the red blood cell</p>
<p>all are dependent on glucose but your</p>
<p>body can easily make the sugar from the</p>
<p>fat that you&rsquo;re eating from your stored</p>
<p>fat and from your protein that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating it doesn&rsquo;t need glucose so</p>
<p>you watch in the next several years all</p>
<p>these top athletes will start going more</p>
<p>ketogenic because their efficiency is</p>
<p>going to be better it&rsquo;s less waste more</p>
<p>oxygen better efficiency you can produce</p>
<p>more ATP which is the energy currency</p>
<p>which is more energy in general and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just more of a cleaner fuel source all</p>
<p>right Jonathan hey Jacqueline you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Toronto Canada go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air I have a question about milk and</p>
<p>PETA genic diet I understand</p>
<p>milk is rather contraindicated because</p>
<p>of the lactose the sugars what if one</p>
<p>drinks lactose free milk good good</p>
<p>question the other thing that you there</p>
<p>are other sugars in milk other than</p>
<p>lactose</p>
<p>however lactose is part of the biggest</p>
<p>sugar so I think you would be fine</p>
<p>consuming some milk with lactose free</p>
<p>but it has to be grass-fed or organic</p>
<p>and the problem with milk - is that the</p>
<p>cows consume the grains which is GMO</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one number two the other</p>
<p>problems is pasteurized and when you</p>
<p>have pasteurized milk you have a</p>
<p>different product than raw milk it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illegal to sell it in most states in the</p>
<p>US so what you maybe in Canada you can</p>
<p>get some raw milk and if you can get</p>
<p>that and it&rsquo;s like grass-fed that would</p>
<p>be great it&rsquo;s much easier to get the raw</p>
<p>milk organic grass-fed cheese which has</p>
<p>a lot less lactose than milk then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>low carb and it&rsquo;s high protein and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fermented so it&rsquo;s easy to digest versus</p>
<p>just milk but a little milk here and</p>
<p>there is a very minor point but just</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s organic milk</p>
<p>alright Jacqueline hey Susan you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air you&rsquo;re from Ohio go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re next hi dr. Berg how are you good</p>
<p>thanks I want to thank you very much for</p>
<p>all your information I&rsquo;m a newbie and I</p>
<p>just had my first</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar drink this morning</p>
<p>and I was pleasantly surprised to find</p>
<p>that it was quite refreshing my problem</p>
<p>is is I am a food addict</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not drugs it&rsquo;s not money it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gambling it&rsquo;s food so in 2007 I went</p>
<p>through a liquid diet through a</p>
<p>hospitals outpatient program and I lost</p>
<p>100 pounds and 53 inches and I also quit</p>
<p>smoking that very first week from the 16</p>
<p>year habit I kept that weight off until</p>
<p>2013 when I had my first foot surgery</p>
<p>for a bunion to make a long story short</p>
<p>that doctor did a botched job and</p>
<p>subsequently I just had my fifth great</p>
<p>foot surgery on May 1st to try to</p>
<p>correct the problem so exercise was not</p>
<p>walking it&rsquo;s gonna have to be like water</p>
<p>aerobics hmm but I need to lose weight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gained my body is completely</p>
<p>different than it was before</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gained a lot of weight back not</p>
<p>all of it but quite a bit of it okay and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if your ketogenic diet</p>
<p>will kind of put my body back where it</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>okay good let me answer that Susan first</p>
<p>of all what do you want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that people for some reason get a lot of</p>
<p>pleasure from food I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>surprising but people actually only even</p>
<p>live for the sensation of food it</p>
<p>actually makes you feel better right so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take that away from you</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re going to want it</p>
<p>more so if you start watching a lot of</p>
<p>the videos that we have my wife and I</p>
<p>with the recipe videos you can get some</p>
<p>amazing ideas for a pleasurable</p>
<p>so-called junk food no sugar ketogenic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way to go so that shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>an issue because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>pleasure in some of the stuff I mean</p>
<p>like bread and chocolate and cake and</p>
<p>all these ice cream I mean there&rsquo;s ways</p>
<p>that you can make it just takes a little</p>
<p>more time that&rsquo;s number one number two</p>
<p>85%</p>
<p>of your success with weight loss will</p>
<p>come from changing your eating and only</p>
<p>15% with exercise so you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>get your goal with just exercise so that</p>
<p>the good point is we don&rsquo;t really need</p>
<p>exercise to get you at least 85% to your</p>
<p>goal even if you didn&rsquo;t exercise now the</p>
<p>advantage of the ketogenic diet is that</p>
<p>ketosis is basically putting your by in</p>
<p>fact learning now wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense</p>
<p>if you want to lose weight is to burn</p>
<p>fat I mean why wouldn&rsquo;t anyone want to</p>
<p>burn fat keep ptosis or the ketosis diet</p>
<p>is the science of getting your body in</p>
<p>fat burning so I&rsquo;m like that is like</p>
<p>what everyone should be doing if they</p>
<p>want to lose weight it&rsquo;s a tool I show</p>
<p>you some tweaks to my videos of how to</p>
<p>do it correctly so yes I highly</p>
<p>recommend you do that because you can</p>
<p>get to your goal healthily without</p>
<p>craving and hunger okay so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>cool the last thing is that bunion</p>
<p>removal I should do a video on that but</p>
<p>instead of getting more therapy if you</p>
<p>had this done on the right foot the</p>
<p>surgery and the bunion and this whole</p>
<p>thing and now it&rsquo;s pain because now you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t walk on you can&rsquo;t run out you need</p>
<p>to maybe watch some of the videos that I</p>
<p>have on that but you need to do massage</p>
<p>on the opposite foot right where they do</p>
<p>the surgery probably on the inner toe</p>
<p>where your bunion was and you start</p>
<p>massaging the left foot it&rsquo;s gonna hurt</p>
<p>like hell why why is it gonna be hurt on</p>
<p>the opposite because the way the nerve</p>
<p>reflexes go but if you would work that</p>
<p>out maybe five minutes every day and</p>
<p>just massage the whole thing and the</p>
<p>compensating muscles which is gonna be</p>
<p>in your left calf it&rsquo;s gonna hurt maybe</p>
<p>have someone else do it and work that</p>
<p>out or even higher massage therapist to</p>
<p>work that out you will and I wish we</p>
<p>could all do a video before and after</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll be putting pressure on</p>
<p>your right foot within probably a day or</p>
<p>two and it won&rsquo;t hurt anymore it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fastest way to knock out of pain so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>create a video on that but in the</p>
<p>meantime I already have videos on how to</p>
<p>get rid of toe pain and foot pain work</p>
<p>on the opposite side all right Susan</p>
<p>alright hey Sean you&rsquo;re from South</p>
<p>Africa go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg thank you I just want to</p>
<p>thank you for all your your videos and</p>
<p>recipes and everything is really amazing</p>
<p>my question is regarding your sweeteners</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m pre-diabetic and my doctor</p>
<p>actually told me to stay away from</p>
<p>sweeteners like desirable and because</p>
<p>your wall she told me that your</p>
<p>intestines can actually taste or detect</p>
<p>the sweetness and therefore still</p>
<p>produced insulin and I would just like</p>
<p>to get your take on that because you use</p>
<p>quite a bit of sweetener in all your</p>
<p>recipe yeah I always love this when</p>
<p>people give their opinions and what I</p>
<p>would like to do is that when someone</p>
<p>says even they say with stevia well</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sweet then your body will</p>
<p>start increasing insulin because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between the</p>
<p>sensation of sweet and sugar I would</p>
<p>always say well where did you where did</p>
<p>you hear that who told you that</p>
<p>what reference are you quoting right</p>
<p>there it breaks right down because they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have a reference there is no data</p>
<p>on that in fact the data if you take</p>
<p>non-gmo xylitol it has a much lower</p>
<p>glycemic index it has this interesting</p>
<p>property of being sweet without</p>
<p>increasing insulin very much compared to</p>
<p>sugar that&rsquo;s what it does same thing</p>
<p>with stevia same thing with three three</p>
<p>tall I&rsquo;ve been using with tens of</p>
<p>thousands of actual patients over a long</p>
<p>period of time and I can tell you you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be safe with consuming that being a</p>
<p>diabetic but again on the net from your</p>
<p>doctor you&rsquo;re going to hear every</p>
<p>different opinion the difference between</p>
<p>an opinion in fact is the fact is based</p>
<p>on evidence the opinion that may or may</p>
<p>not be based on evidence so you just</p>
<p>have to find out where&rsquo;s the source who</p>
<p>told you that and then you&rsquo;ll find out</p>
<p>they probably heard it from the National</p>
<p>Enquirer or some other high-quality</p>
<p>reference all right thanks Shawn hey</p>
<p>Lisa you&rsquo;re from Missouri go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air hi doctor bird my</p>
<p>question I just recently had some lab</p>
<p>work done this week and I got my results</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m dealing with</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>Cuoco my numbers came in at 125</p>
<p>the range is 74 to 106 and then I&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>dealing with high cholesterol I&rsquo;m in my</p>
<p>50 and I have gone one year without</p>
<p>ministration and I spoke to my doctor</p>
<p>about that he said two years so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that I&rsquo;m totally I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally out of the woods</p>
<p>administrating my body is going through</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>I just incorporated eating</p>
<p>steel-cut oatmeal into my diet and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that was a good thing</p>
<p>because I had basically been sticking</p>
<p>with eggs and spinach more your protein</p>
<p>and your vegetables okay and the only</p>
<p>reason why I incorporated the steel-cut</p>
<p>oatmeal because they were telling me</p>
<p>with my high cholesterol to start eating</p>
<p>more oats</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a big thing for</p>
<p>me so I want to have some feedback on</p>
<p>what I should try to to do to get these</p>
<p>numbers back in range because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to go on medication yeah I got it</p>
<p>thanks Lisa this this is just so funny</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this whole push against</p>
<p>lowering cholesterol so they&rsquo;ll do it by</p>
<p>adding more grains because oatmeal has</p>
<p>the beta glutens which will lower</p>
<p>cholesterol but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>cholesterol is is a healer it actually</p>
<p>heals the body it&rsquo;s used as a band-aid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your body makes a lot of it because</p>
<p>it needs it it&rsquo;s a precursor to certain</p>
<p>hormones especially during menopause in</p>
<p>fact and this might be mind-blowing and</p>
<p>different than what you&rsquo;ve been hearing</p>
<p>and I will create a video on this but</p>
<p>you could literally increase more</p>
<p>cholesterol in the diet and lower</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s cholesterol simply because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feedback mechanism now most</p>
<p>people will not believe that and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine but I just say try it for two weeks</p>
<p>and just watch what happens because you</p>
<p>your cholesterol changes day to day</p>
<p>and you could even do it within you know</p>
<p>three days and see this interesting you</p>
<p>could buy a cholesterol tester at the</p>
<p>drugstore and then test yourself every</p>
<p>day and you will see it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>bizarre in fact adding more cholesterol</p>
<p>to lower cholesterol just because your</p>
<p>body then won&rsquo;t have to hold on I mean</p>
<p>it can actually release some of it so I</p>
<p>think I would cut out the steel-cut</p>
<p>oatmeal I think I would go back to what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing but the other point I want</p>
<p>to make is you have to do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting that because you have if your</p>
<p>cholesterol and your blood sugars are up</p>
<p>we still have a problem with insulin</p>
<p>resistance so we&rsquo;re gonna have to keep</p>
<p>working on that because all these other</p>
<p>things are symptoms of high levels of</p>
<p>insulin so I would do a combination of</p>
<p>ketosis in a minute fasting maybe</p>
<p>because of your age I would go to two</p>
<p>meals a day but you&rsquo;re gonna have to add</p>
<p>more fat to be able to go from one meal</p>
<p>to the next and watch what happens</p>
<p>within two or three weeks to your</p>
<p>cholesterol and your blood sugars it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>come right down I also watch the videos</p>
<p>on debugging stubborn weight loss you</p>
<p>can go with my membership site and get a</p>
<p>lot more data on that and they can</p>
<p>actually get to the nitty gritty ax to</p>
<p>see there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>things you can do to take it to the next</p>
<p>level as well but I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing fine just cut out</p>
<p>the oatmeal and realize that a lot of</p>
<p>medical doctors just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>nutritional training they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>symptom based and they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll and we</p>
<p>need doctors that emergency care and</p>
<p>things like that but when they get into</p>
<p>nutritional things they just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>some are learning but unfortunately</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way it is hey Edward you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Florida go ahead people you and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some progress and I want to</p>
<p>know why maybe I&rsquo;m gonna leave a slower</p>
<p>than maybe most people and that is the</p>
<p>way I perceive it as we&rsquo;ve gone about</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t you take on that okay so and</p>
<p>again right after your question we have</p>
<p>one two three four more questions and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re not going to take any more</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing Edward underneath</p>
<p>the left ribcage is the pancreas and</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s happening the new thing</p>
<p>with the new introduction of fats to the</p>
<p>diet is putting maybe a little strain on</p>
<p>the pancreas so what I would recommend</p>
<p>in your case very simply is to find some</p>
<p>enzyme combination called pink</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called pancreatin okay and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>group of enzymes that you can take into</p>
<p>some of the form to take the support off</p>
<p>the pancreas and just help your pancreas</p>
<p>you know work better because what</p>
<p>happens if you are a typical person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been eating sugar your whole life</p>
<p>whatever your insulin resistance that</p>
<p>puts a lot of strain in the pancreas now</p>
<p>the pancreas can&rsquo;t produce the enzymes</p>
<p>that it needs to and then it might</p>
<p>strain the pancreas then cause all sorts</p>
<p>of you know irritation or swelling or</p>
<p>the pancreas to work so hard so I would</p>
<p>just add the enzymes to it and maybe cut</p>
<p>down the fat just a little bit and see</p>
<p>if those symptoms don&rsquo;t go completely</p>
<p>away so we have someone from India go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air it&rsquo;s Shammi</p>
<p>regarding your hypothyroid shopping</p>
<p>oh hi I I is not my primary question my</p>
<p>primary question is on fibroids</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve had fibroids I think from 2003</p>
<p>or four I figured it out in 2005 I did a</p>
<p>myomectomy in 2000 from I&rsquo;m 39 years old</p>
<p>now so</p>
<p>2005 is my first surgery on I did my</p>
<p>iMac to me I think I had intramural and</p>
<p>sub serious fibroids I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>pronounce that</p>
<p>and I 10 years later I did a follow-up</p>
<p>surgery because again I you know it grew</p>
<p>back right so this was in 2016 so post</p>
<p>surgery</p>
<p>I think about a couple of months later I</p>
<p>went back for a follow-up and I still</p>
<p>do have a little bit of fibroid I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one point six centimeters</p>
<p>pretty small but my uterus is still</p>
<p>bulky and post-surgery my bleeding has</p>
<p>become less while my period cycle is</p>
<p>perfected so 2020 seven-day cycle the</p>
<p>bleeding has become less so I want to</p>
<p>know I mean what is it that I can do see</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to keep doing the surgery</p>
<p>again right so I want to know is there a</p>
<p>way to kind of control this you know</p>
<p>fibroid and my little bit of background</p>
<p>everything else seems to be normal my</p>
<p>liver or gallbladder or ovaries</p>
<p>everything is normal but I do have a</p>
<p>bulky uterus okay I&rsquo;m like what I rode</p>
<p>medication okay great thanks so let me</p>
<p>just kind of give you the four things</p>
<p>number one I know in India I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>in your area the part of India but they</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting introduced even GMO</p>
<p>things cotton for example is GMO cotton</p>
<p>and cotton if it&rsquo;s GMO it&rsquo;s sprayed with</p>
<p>glyphosate well you have a female&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tampon their pads and their panty liners</p>
<p>that are actually very close to the area</p>
<p>of the body that you can actually</p>
<p>increase absorption of those that</p>
<p>herbicide that can then create fibroids</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s estrogenic so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing you have to do organic in that</p>
<p>situation the other thing is make sure</p>
<p>that all of your foods are organic and</p>
<p>without hormones okay because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what&rsquo;s creating this growth of</p>
<p>fibroid underneath everything else</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still you know you&rsquo;re possibly</p>
<p>going in the pre menopause at this age</p>
<p>possibly an X gonna increase your</p>
<p>estrogen to progesterone ratio that</p>
<p>could be another factor it&rsquo;s unlikely</p>
<p>but that could be a situation so you</p>
<p>might have to actively balance out your</p>
<p>estrogen so you do the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables get something called dim di M</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a concentrated cruciferous it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that will help and then the very organic</p>
<p>healthy seek help that will decrease the</p>
<p>estrogen as well that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>if I were in your shoes and I think that</p>
<p>should really resolve the problem okay</p>
<p>so Paul you&rsquo;re from Australia go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>I thank you dr. Berg I five years ago I</p>
<p>had three stents put in my arteries and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve put me on cholesterol tablets</p>
<p>statin tablets also a blood-pressure</p>
<p>tablet which I&rsquo;ve never had blood</p>
<p>pressure in my life and also an aspirin</p>
<p>I saw one of your videos and I decided</p>
<p>there and then that I&rsquo;ll chuckle I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>by all these tablets and I ordered some</p>
<p>of the or k2d three tablets but a friend</p>
<p>of mine was telling me he had this is</p>
<p>got the same problem with he had stents</p>
<p>put in but he&rsquo;s his specialist said that</p>
<p>he has to lower his cholesterol because</p>
<p>there could be a problem with his tense</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m in the catch-22 I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do I&rsquo;m taking the I&rsquo;m taking the</p>
<p>aspirin but not not the not the</p>
<p>cholesterol tablets my cholesterol was</p>
<p>with the tablets were at four point six</p>
<p>when I threw them out and I had a test</p>
<p>at my local chemist came to six point</p>
<p>four yeah I at the moment I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>sufficient and some q10 and I&rsquo;m waiting</p>
<p>for your medication to arrive and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start taking lives now again I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>quite sure about this</p>
<p>cholesterol thing in the stent yeah I</p>
<p>think Paul I&rsquo;m gonna actually don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do some videos on that because I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a big problem there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much confusion total cholesterol doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean anything related to arteries you</p>
<p>want to know about the different types</p>
<p>of LDL which I&rsquo;ll do a video on but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re taking d3 k2</p>
<p>which is the absolute best thing for the</p>
<p>arteries because it D calcifies the</p>
<p>arteries it makes</p>
<p>artery&rsquo;s more elastic the cholesterol is</p>
<p>this only coming in there as a band-aid</p>
<p>to heal the broken down artery that is</p>
<p>probably has some micro hemorrhaging or</p>
<p>bleeding from preexisting stuff the</p>
<p>other thing you have to do to even</p>
<p>balance your cholesterol is to get fixed</p>
<p>insulin resistance so I think you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>probably been watching my videos are</p>
<p>already doing that if you follow that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be very successful to</p>
<p>heal the circulation the heart the</p>
<p>arteries the blood vessels it makes the</p>
<p>arteries less inflamed which is then</p>
<p>going to attract less LDL LDL basically</p>
<p>triggers an immune reaction because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there to actually heal things so if the</p>
<p>LDL goes up and you&rsquo;re not eating any</p>
<p>sugar it just means that your body is</p>
<p>trying to heal something so number one</p>
<p>in the K 2 and D 3 we added the red</p>
<p>yeast extract which is very powerful for</p>
<p>cholesterol so that&rsquo;s number one</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re taking the right thing</p>
<p>number two you want to get on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet hardcore you want to make</p>
<p>sure that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting so those snacks between</p>
<p>the meals and then number three I would</p>
<p>highly recommend doing a more broad</p>
<p>cholesterol panel to look at the whole</p>
<p>picture the different types of LDL and</p>
<p>get someone if it needs to be my team or</p>
<p>someone else to evaluate that correctly</p>
<p>and start evaluating that over the next</p>
<p>few months and I think you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>way more successful but you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard because your friend tells</p>
<p>you this their doctor tells you that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re confused you need to be had it on</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll create some videos on the LDL</p>
<p>very soon so you can have all the data</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to be in fear but I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing the right thing</p>
<p>thanks Paul hey LeAnn you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Brooklyn go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thirteen years I&rsquo;ve been having a heart</p>
<p>palpitation right now I&rsquo;m 40 and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still having the same problem I did</p>
<p>already</p>
<p>Prentis EKG echo they monitor my heart</p>
<p>for two weeks and it&rsquo;s the same problem</p>
<p>and I know they can&rsquo;t get mad and say</p>
<p>what is the problem if he can do any</p>
<p>blood tests they can we know one of the</p>
<p>doctors tell me probably I&rsquo;m a half in</p>
<p>panic attack she wanted me to see Dion</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any panic attacks so I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go to see the psychiatrist I have</p>
<p>you know no problem to plan fully</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s talk about the real heart</p>
<p>palpitations is an electrolyte problem I</p>
<p>did a video on that again I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>giving information to do your own</p>
<p>research I&rsquo;m not telling you that this</p>
<p>is going to be the cure but I will say</p>
<p>that you may want to go into the area of</p>
<p>consuming more potassium foods and even</p>
<p>a potassium supplement I do have an</p>
<p>electrolyte powder it&rsquo;s I temporarily</p>
<p>ran out of it I will have it in ten days</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing higher levels of</p>
<p>potassium like if you were to do an</p>
<p>extra 3,000 milligrams of potassium that</p>
<p>is will put the electrical system back</p>
<p>into the connection with the pacemakers</p>
<p>in the heart and of course you want to</p>
<p>also get the magnesium as well the</p>
<p>combination in the in the whole</p>
<p>electrolyte mix because your</p>
<p>palpitations are either a magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency or a potassium deficiency if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been consuming those over a</p>
<p>period of time</p>
<p>and you still have heart palpitations</p>
<p>then we know you have insulin resistance</p>
<p>in which case you need to follow that</p>
<p>eating plan I&rsquo;m recommending like to a</p>
<p>tee because insulin resistance blocks</p>
<p>the absorption of potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium so that could be the reason so</p>
<p>you just have to go right back into</p>
<p>fixing that eating better in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and that will start increasing</p>
<p>your potassium and reduces the</p>
<p>palpations but sometimes by taking the</p>
<p>potassium that can also speed up the</p>
<p>fixing your insulin resistance at the</p>
<p>same</p>
<p>time so you can kill two birds with one</p>
<p>stone go ahead and try that okay and</p>
<p>then let us know and maybe about a month</p>
<p>from now all right then we have someone</p>
<p>from Miami Florida</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Nabila go ahead yes hello how are</p>
<p>you doing you&rsquo;re amazing and a gift and</p>
<p>thank you for everything that you do I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>56 years old and I have a history of</p>
<p>hepatitis C I was treated for that</p>
<p>I finished the harvoni last year in July</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m hearing incidents of liver</p>
<p>cancer occurring from what I understand</p>
<p>the microenvironment of the liver you</p>
<p>know is not restored although you know</p>
<p>we are treated and you know no one has</p>
<p>spoken to me about that my GI hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spoken to me about that and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>concerned also I have hypothyroidism my</p>
<p>valve matter was removed in 1999 and you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m about 210 pounds and I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>difficulty losing weight so these are my</p>
<p>concerns if you can assist me with that</p>
<p>sure okay great and you&rsquo;ll be the last</p>
<p>caller so here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the thing I</p>
<p>would get some high quality licorice</p>
<p>root licorice root has this interesting</p>
<p>property that improves viral hepatitis</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s one thing secondly the</p>
<p>reason why if hypothyroid is probably</p>
<p>because the gall bladder was moved</p>
<p>because now you can&rsquo;t have a difficult</p>
<p>difficult time converting t4 to t3 so</p>
<p>you probably would benefit from</p>
<p>something called gall bladder formula</p>
<p>and maybe even milk thistle for the</p>
<p>inflammation on the liver so and then to</p>
<p>put the icing on the cake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bad expression to basically</p>
<p>take the next level follow the the</p>
<p>eating recommendations that I have on</p>
<p>the videos with in a minute fasting and</p>
<p>ketosis because that&rsquo;s going to take a</p>
<p>huge stress off the liver it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>take inflammation of the liver and</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s viral the you can&rsquo;t kill a</p>
<p>virus all you can do is put it in</p>
<p>remission</p>
<p>so you just your only solution is to</p>
<p>stay extremely healthy</p>
<p>okay and vibrant so thank you so much</p>
<p>for calling hey you guys were great I</p>
<p>hope you got some tips until next week</p>
<p>have a great week I&rsquo;ll release some more</p>
<p>videos each day so thanks for watching</p>
<p>and thanks for your calls</p>
