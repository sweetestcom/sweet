<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªøhello everyone so before Dave Feldman</p>
<p>does his talking cholesterol I wanted to</p>
<p>first give you some basic understanding</p>
<p>of the definitions he&rsquo;s going to use so</p>
<p>you really can digest and understand</p>
<p>everything that he&rsquo;s going to say okay</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna start with this</p>
<p>definition of cholesterol so the first</p>
<p>thing you need to know is that</p>
<p>cholesterol is not really a fat it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a fat it&rsquo;s a fad like waxy substance</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s start with the purpose of</p>
<p>cholesterol number one it provides the</p>
<p>raw material to certain hormones okay</p>
<p>number two it makes up all of your</p>
<p>cellular membranes so in other words the</p>
<p>outer shell of your cells are made up of</p>
<p>cholesterol 3 it makes up part of the</p>
<p>brain without cholesterol the brain will</p>
<p>not work correctly also a part of the</p>
<p>nervous system the insulation around the</p>
<p>nerves is made from cholesterol 4 it</p>
<p>helps make bile</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s bile bile is the detergent</p>
<p>that helps you break down certain fats</p>
<p>to turn them into fat type of vitamins</p>
<p>essential fats that you need like</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids and it helps you</p>
<p>make certain vitamins like vitamin D so</p>
<p>without cholesterol you can&rsquo;t make bile</p>
<p>and you cannot make vitamin D so it has</p>
<p>a very important purpose everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>focused on cholesterol being bad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna clog your arteries but cholesterol</p>
<p>is very very important to actually help</p>
<p>make up part of the body tissues alright</p>
<p>so the next thing you need to know is</p>
<p>that the body makes a lot of cholesterol</p>
<p>itself it makes roughly about 3,000</p>
<p>milligrams of cholesterol every single</p>
<p>day that encompasses 75% of the</p>
<p>cholesterol in your body so if we were</p>
<p>to take you to cluster out of your body</p>
<p>75% of it would be made by your body and</p>
<p>only 25% of it comes from the diet the</p>
<p>next point is that cholesterol is a part</p>
<p>of plaquing as in a clogged artery ok</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the cause of the plaquing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of the crime scene but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the criminal just because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cholesterol in a plaque doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that it caused the plaque cholesterol is</p>
<p>there as part of a band-aid trying to</p>
<p>heal</p>
<p>something as you&rsquo;re gonna find out it</p>
<p>has several really important purposes</p>
<p>and let me just touch on this word</p>
<p>triglycerides okay simply it is a type</p>
<p>of fat that makes up your fat cell it</p>
<p>also can be consumed from your diet to</p>
<p>supply energy or be used to store fat</p>
<p>carbohydrates that you eat can be</p>
<p>converted to triglyceride in the fat</p>
<p>cell so triglycerides are called lipids</p>
<p>and what you need to know is that</p>
<p>cholesterol triglycerides and other flip</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s are hydrophobic which means they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mix well with water okay like oil</p>
<p>and water do not mix so then the body</p>
<p>has to do certain things to make it mix</p>
<p>with water to allow the fat to travel to</p>
<p>the rest of the cells why because it</p>
<p>provides the raw material to hormones</p>
<p>and helps make up the cell membrane help</p>
<p>support the brain makes the bile of</p>
<p>vitamin D how is it going to do that if</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be transported so your body</p>
<p>adds a protein to the lipid and that is</p>
<p>called Lippo proteins okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the next section on that</p>
<p>okay so in this section we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about the five lipoproteins</p>
<p>okay lipoproteins basically our boats or</p>
<p>carriers to transport fat and</p>
<p>cholesterol to the body because fat</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mix well it&rsquo;s hydrophobic with</p>
<p>water so we need to add a protein to the</p>
<p>fat to allow it to travel through the</p>
<p>body okay so the first one we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>talk about is this thing called a Kyllo</p>
<p>micron okay what is that basically that</p>
<p>is a boat that transports the dietary</p>
<p>fat that fat from your diet from the</p>
<p>small intestine to the cells okay so</p>
<p>this is created when you&rsquo;re eating so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a boat that takes the diet fat and</p>
<p>it brings into the cells</p>
<p>okay another name for this chylomicron</p>
<p>is ultra low density lipoprotein so let</p>
<p>me explain this because it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>confusing</p>
<p>ultra low density because if you look at</p>
<p>the other ones in relationship to this</p>
<p>one you have something called very low</p>
<p>density lipoproteins intermediate</p>
<p>density lipoproteins low-density</p>
<p>lipoproteins and high-density</p>
<p>lipoproteins so if something is more</p>
<p>dense high-density that means it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>compacted okay</p>
<p>so you see how small it is now look at a</p>
<p>chylomicron it&rsquo;s ultra low density so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bigger it&rsquo;s not very dense it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>ultra low density particle okay so then</p>
<p>we have very low density lipoprotein</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s smaller and it gets smaller and</p>
<p>smaller and smaller and reality we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just making something more dense so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just another way to understand</p>
<p>the relationship between all of these to</p>
<p>try to make it a little bit simpler okay</p>
<p>so the chylomicron is created when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating but when you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fasting okay what we have to</p>
<p>do is we have to take the energy or fat</p>
<p>from the fat cell and transport that to</p>
<p>the cells okay we need a shuttle for</p>
<p>that and the first shuttle is the very</p>
<p>low-density lipoprotein so basically you</p>
<p>have this boat that has this energy that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to start feeding the cells</p>
<p>okay feeding it fat triglycerides and</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to end up as a</p>
<p>low-density lipoprotein so you can kind</p>
<p>of look at this is these three together</p>
<p>as a kind of a transition phase so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go from here to here to here</p>
<p>and by the way there are other functions</p>
<p>than just feeding the cell as well and</p>
<p>number one it&rsquo;s going to provide vitamin</p>
<p>E and other antioxidants to actually</p>
<p>neutralize free radicals help neutralize</p>
<p>pathogens there&rsquo;s even a little bit of</p>
<p>carotenoid in here which is another</p>
<p>antioxidant so the very low-density</p>
<p>lipoprotein carries the fat from the</p>
<p>liver to the cells and then this would</p>
<p>be the next phase with the LDL which</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s done with its purpose it gets</p>
<p>recycled by the liver now what is the</p>
<p>HDL the high density lipoprotein do it</p>
<p>carries excessive cholesterol that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still lingering around from these guys</p>
<p>back to the liver to be recycled or used</p>
<p>for some other purpose so each of these</p>
<p>boats</p>
<p>their own percentages of triglycerides</p>
<p>cholesterol and protein okay and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what makes them different all right so</p>
<p>now that you have a little background</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go right into Dave Feldman&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a senior software engineer business</p>
<p>developer and an entrepreneur in April</p>
<p>of 2015 he began a low-carb high-fat</p>
<p>diet and after experiencing a</p>
<p>significant rise in his total</p>
<p>cholesterol committed himself to</p>
<p>learning everything he could about</p>
<p>cholesterol and the lipid system lipid</p>
<p>his fat right</p>
<p>using his engineering background so here</p>
<p>to make a pretty complicated subject</p>
<p>simple for you are you gonna come up</p>
<p>here and say something</p>
<p>Dave Felton thank you thank you so much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious do you guys do you guys like</p>
<p>plays yeah yeah I mean you ever go out</p>
<p>to the theater kind of get to enjoy a</p>
<p>night on the town well what I&rsquo;ve liked</p>
<p>about this conference is fairly early on</p>
<p>when Eric approached me we started</p>
<p>chatting up this idea that would sound</p>
<p>outlandish to other conferences but this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t like other conferences right now</p>
<p>so I would like to introduce to you an</p>
<p>important cast that&rsquo;s actually at play</p>
<p>right now inside your body please</p>
<p>welcome the cast of the lipid system</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll stop yeah just stay here come on I</p>
<p>know I know we really decked it out on</p>
<p>the pricing here now I&rsquo;m gonna do is</p>
<p>have you guys a little bit more over</p>
<p>here and spread out so that the podiums</p>
<p>not too much in the way hope you guys</p>
<p>have a decent view nabiollah ford here</p>
<p>perfect alright so how many of you guys</p>
<p>had a fatty meal Wow a lot of you a lot</p>
<p>of you had a fatty meal it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>well what happened to those fatty acids</p>
<p>that were being pulled through your</p>
<p>digestive system well they got packaged</p>
<p>into something called a kite sorry a</p>
<p>triglyceride</p>
<p>now the triglyceride as we see here by</p>
<p>your digestive tract is having trouble</p>
<p>getting it into the bloodstream and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s hydro phobic but she</p>
<p>has about to transport and that is</p>
<p>called the chylomicron a lipoprotein now</p>
<p>the chylomicron is kind of like a waiter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving around your bloodstream</p>
<p>going to these different cells and oh</p>
<p>one of the cells would like a</p>
<p>triglyceride and now that all of the</p>
<p>triglycerides are off of the chylomicron</p>
<p>it then gets absorbed by the liver</p>
<p>however you&rsquo;re not always eating right</p>
<p>so at a certain point you are fasting</p>
<p>you hear much about fasting at this</p>
<p>conference your body should be in a</p>
<p>state of fasting not just overnight but</p>
<p>also between meals so then what happens</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we still have some cells that need</p>
<p>energy you can tell that&rsquo;s by the way</p>
<p>the signal that you know the cells need</p>
<p>the energy well fortunately the liver</p>
<p>can help out and it does so using the</p>
<p>fat cells</p>
<p>the liver has its own boat known as a</p>
<p>VLDL and there it is</p>
<p>with fat cells ultimately supplying</p>
<p>those triglycerides through the liver to</p>
<p>the boat and now it does the same thing</p>
<p>that chylomicrons were doing but from</p>
<p>its own boat</p>
<p>go ahead and now that it&rsquo;s relieved of</p>
<p>all of its triglycerides</p>
<p>unlike the chylomicron it has a second</p>
<p>job it is an LDL particle so now it has</p>
<p>things you hardly ever hear about one of</p>
<p>those for example is that it actually</p>
<p>helps to neutralize pathogens it does so</p>
<p>with something known as vitamin E ooh</p>
<p>was a nice ring but now that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally out of vitamin E what can it do</p>
<p>with this last pathogen that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>forward well fortunately it can bind to</p>
<p>that pathogen to help clear it</p>
<p>and that ladies and gentlemen is your</p>
<p>lipid system at work as we see it now</p>
<p>thank you so much oh my gosh we were</p>
<p>gonna do a a theater bow here we go</p>
<p>okay get one more big round of applause</p>
<p>for everybody you volunteered for this</p>
<p>thank you guys so much so now if I could</p>
<p>get my presentation up I think we&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>ready to get started hopefully this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t double making me all right keto</p>
<p>and cholesterol so it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>sentiment that I&rsquo;ve seen the entire time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in this and it&rsquo;s will</p>
<p>be actually three years next month but</p>
<p>very early on in the literature</p>
<p>I saw effectively what you see in this</p>
<p>cartoon which if you can&rsquo;t read it says</p>
<p>we already know the killer is</p>
<p>cholesterol we just need to get enough</p>
<p>evidence to prove it and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>effectively what I&rsquo;ve seen over and over</p>
<p>again and again I&rsquo;m an engineer like</p>
<p>Iver you can&rsquo;t say something like hey</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at risk for a meteor strike and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incumbent on me to prove you wrong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to you to actually prove the</p>
<p>meteor strike is in fact imminent that</p>
<p>we should do something about it so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back before three years ago in my own</p>
<p>health journey this was what I would</p>
<p>call my fighting weight and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if any of you guys have ever done this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this when I was running and</p>
<p>yet I still somehow had a gut if I knew</p>
<p>I was coming up on a camera while</p>
<p>running I try to suck in my gut I try to</p>
<p>get the shot right well I certainly may</p>
<p>not be able to see my gut in these shots</p>
<p>but you can certainly see my neck in my</p>
<p>face I was definitely a lot puffier this</p>
<p>next picture was actually my engagement</p>
<p>photos with my wife</p>
<p>and at that time I weighed quite a bit</p>
<p>more than I do now well this is me now</p>
<p>start Quito in April 2015 lost 25 pounds</p>
<p>and the big moment again was about three</p>
<p>years ago next month I became obsessed</p>
<p>with cholesterol research since seeing</p>
<p>my total and LDL cholesterol skyrocket</p>
<p>and after that I began extensive in</p>
<p>tawan experiments to learn more and for</p>
<p>those of you in the room who know what I</p>
<p>mean by extensive in of one experiments</p>
<p>you know the inside joke for those of</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have a little journey</p>
<p>together so I take metrics constantly</p>
<p>this is back these are old pictures you</p>
<p>can tell because I have a precision</p>
<p>extra when in fact I like to use keto</p>
<p>mojo all the time now I have it for both</p>
<p>glucose for ketones I do blood pressure</p>
<p>I do like a whole bunch of metrics but</p>
<p>this is probably what I&rsquo;m most known for</p>
<p>I take a picture of every single thing</p>
<p>that I ingest everything in fact at</p>
<p>every conference I make everyone aware</p>
<p>of this I will give you $100 if you can</p>
<p>capture me</p>
<p>ingesting anything that I didn&rsquo;t already</p>
<p>take a picture of first but I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>warn you my wife hasn&rsquo;t collected on</p>
<p>that so it&rsquo;s not looking good yes this</p>
<p>is literally everything you may have</p>
<p>noticed my left hand appears in it and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so that there&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>reference for volume so if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>actually weighing it I can be sure that</p>
<p>I know approximately what the quantity</p>
<p>is but a lot of times I weigh it as well</p>
<p>like you see I&rsquo;m doing here with the</p>
<p>shredded cheese and when I say</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m not talking just</p>
<p>foodstuffs I&rsquo;m talking also supplements</p>
<p>and yes</p>
<p>even water every single sip of water</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had I even have a symbol by</p>
<p>the way for when I go to a water</p>
<p>fountain and I hold up how many fingers</p>
<p>for how many gulps that I&rsquo;ve done now</p>
<p>why am I doing this why am i capturing</p>
<p>every single thing I&rsquo;m eating this</p>
<p>obsessively well they have to match with</p>
<p>my blood tests how many blood tests have</p>
<p>I had I&rsquo;ve had about a hundred and five</p>
<p>in the last 35 months since my research</p>
<p>has begun and the reason I emphasize</p>
<p>this is because I take the data that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>collecting very seriously to the extent</p>
<p>to where when I&rsquo;m doing these</p>
<p>experiments</p>
<p>I can show you just how tightly</p>
<p>controlled it is that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>bring me about to the inversion pattern</p>
<p>now for those of you are not familiar</p>
<p>with my work this will be quite amazing</p>
<p>because this is really the model at the</p>
<p>end of the day as to why it is that it</p>
<p>relates back to me as a software</p>
<p>engineer</p>
<p>I saw early on that this looked like a</p>
<p>network but these different things talk</p>
<p>to each other and that&rsquo;s part of why I</p>
<p>was happy to put that play on just now</p>
<p>was because you can&rsquo;t look at the lipid</p>
<p>system in a static manner you have to</p>
<p>look at it in a dynamic manner and once</p>
<p>you do and particularly the more you can</p>
<p>kind of understand networks and software</p>
<p>engineering in my opinion the more you</p>
<p>can get why it can be the way that does</p>
<p>and how well it can function so about I</p>
<p>want to say two and a half years ago I</p>
<p>was at low-carb ville and I brought</p>
<p>these eight data points</p>
<p>that was back when I had only eight</p>
<p>blood tests and I took them over three</p>
<p>months and as you could probably see by</p>
<p>that dotted orange line it seems to</p>
<p>reflect what&rsquo;s going on above it in that</p>
<p>sort of solid blue line that dotted</p>
<p>orange line is a three-day average of my</p>
<p>dietary fat that solid blue line that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my LDL cholesterol so I took that to</p>
<p>low-carb Bale and I stocked all of the</p>
<p>different doctors there the different</p>
<p>researchers and so forth but I actually</p>
<p>happen to have a great conversation with</p>
<p>Ivor Cummins as it happens to be the one</p>
<p>other major engineer there and sure</p>
<p>enough I said you know what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>this I once I get home</p>
<p>because this was taken over three months</p>
<p>and it was about every like 13 14 days</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna actually do one full week</p>
<p>where I actually eat to a meal plan like</p>
<p>you see here so that I can induce a</p>
<p>curve to see if the LDL cholesterol will</p>
<p>even follow it when I&rsquo;m doing it one day</p>
<p>after the next actually was going into</p>
<p>the phlebotomist getting my blood drawn</p>
<p>every single day so what happened that</p>
<p>happen sure enough we see the reflection</p>
<p>shown and then of course for my next one</p>
<p>I said well heck what if I just go gin</p>
<p>the fat what if I have tons and tons of</p>
<p>it well we then see the lowest LDL see</p>
<p>that I got since I started since then</p>
<p>you can see with 29 data points the very</p>
<p>beginning of my research what is clearly</p>
<p>what I would call the inversion pattern</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna flip the axes on the left</p>
<p>side flip it so that you can actually</p>
<p>see how well it retrofits when you can</p>
<p>see the inversion together</p>
<p>unquestionably one of the most amazing</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;ve ever seen and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing to me even more so that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually just looking at nutrition</p>
<p>labels coming to the macros and from the</p>
<p>macros ultimately being able to predict</p>
<p>accurately what the cholesterol levels</p>
<p>will be in my blood now for those of you</p>
<p>who are actually rendered the statistics</p>
<p>mumbo-jumbo the Pearson and the</p>
<p>regression those are amazing scores</p>
<p>and this is what I call the inversion</p>
<p>pattern the dietary fat inversion for</p>
<p>LDL seen it&rsquo;s really quite simple I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right now recording this on a Saturday</p>
<p>so if I were to have taken my blood this</p>
<p>morning I would look backwards three</p>
<p>days the Friday yesterday and the</p>
<p>Thursday before that and then the</p>
<p>Wednesday before that and from those</p>
<p>three days I feel that I can make it</p>
<p>fairly strong guess as to what my</p>
<p>resulting LDL cholesterol would be now</p>
<p>how is it that I can get to that well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain the model to you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to warn you this may be</p>
<p>one of the more technical areas but for</p>
<p>the mumbo-jumbo slides don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna slow down and walk you through it</p>
<p>now this is one of those slides the</p>
<p>truth is this is what you hear about all</p>
<p>the time in the ketogenic community and</p>
<p>even outside the ketogenic community</p>
<p>that carbs and protein can be converted</p>
<p>to glucose okay that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>you also hear all the time about how fat</p>
<p>can be converted to ketones and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true but here&rsquo;s the thing you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>often hear about it you don&rsquo;t often hear</p>
<p>about how fat can be delivered directly</p>
<p>to cells until just a moment ago with</p>
<p>our little play showing how they can get</p>
<p>transported in these boats</p>
<p>so these are the other pathways by which</p>
<p>fatty acids can come directly to your</p>
<p>cells but I want to focus on one</p>
<p>particular one I want to focus on the</p>
<p>one that includes that word I want you</p>
<p>to remember</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any word I want you to remember</p>
<p>past this it&rsquo;s triglycerides try as in</p>
<p>three fatty acids three fatty acids</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bundled up and they are</p>
<p>basically the stored form of fat and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re loaded onto these boats that</p>
<p>your body makes and then sends around</p>
<p>your bloodstream and I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>off-script for just a sec does anyone</p>
<p>know about what measurement just what</p>
<p>total quantity of LDL particles you have</p>
<p>in your blood stream right now is anyone</p>
<p>want to guess no millions I mean you</p>
<p>think millions how many think trillions</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s a trick question it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>millions of trillions it&rsquo;s known as a</p>
<p>quintillion and it&rsquo;s a one followed by</p>
<p>18 zeros your body makes these in large</p>
<p>quantities every single week it actually</p>
<p>will synthesize and then reabsorb these</p>
<p>at very high quantities so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>keen to be sure that it delivers these</p>
<p>triglycerides and ultimately then</p>
<p>remodel back to LDL particles so putting</p>
<p>it pretty simply if you were to think of</p>
<p>a boat as a lipoprotein like this cruise</p>
<p>ship what are the passengers passengers</p>
<p>are triglycerides it&rsquo;s right okay so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the cholesterol on this</p>
<p>cholesterol is the life rafts what is</p>
<p>the purpose of a cruise ship the cruise</p>
<p>ships purpose is actually to mainly move</p>
<p>around the passengers the cruise ships</p>
<p>purpose is not mainly to move around the</p>
<p>life rafts however you wouldn&rsquo;t get on a</p>
<p>cruise ship that didn&rsquo;t have life rafts</p>
<p>so you do still want the life rafts it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still very relevant and you&rsquo;ll see why a</p>
<p>little bit more later so this is where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kind of break it out into a</p>
<p>little bit of a diagram and what&rsquo;s neat</p>
<p>is because of the play beforehand and</p>
<p>everything else we&rsquo;re helping to kind of</p>
<p>set you up a little bit more</p>
<p>so now let&rsquo;s define what is an Apple</p>
<p>lipoprotein okay so it&rsquo;s an additional</p>
<p>protein that binds to the lipid so you</p>
<p>remember these little boats called the</p>
<p>lipoprotein there&rsquo;s five different ones</p>
<p>that have different ratios of protein</p>
<p>cholesterol triglycerides they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>carrying vitamin E as the antioxidant so</p>
<p>the Apple lipoprotein is basically the</p>
<p>captain of this ship that&rsquo;s directing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s occurring and we also have</p>
<p>phospholipids which is another type of</p>
<p>lipid that is used in making cellular</p>
<p>membranes so now different</p>
<p>apolipoproteins do different jobs and</p>
<p>they have different names okay their</p>
<p>name simply ABCDE h j l m and they have</p>
<p>also subclasses of names so a would have</p>
<p>a subclass of different names B could</p>
<p>have a subclass so LD L uses Apple B HDL</p>
<p>uses Apple a and IDL uses Apple II so</p>
<p>you can see that these things right here</p>
<p>have different effects for each one of</p>
<p>these so what actually do they do well</p>
<p>they have several things that they do so</p>
<p>number one they would activate certain</p>
<p>enzymes to help the conversion of a VLDL</p>
<p>to an IDL to an LDL so basically they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making the fat dissolve from an</p>
<p>enzyme called lipase and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>helping this unload so they can convert</p>
<p>to this end product right here they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also involved in transporting or</p>
<p>directing the boats to through the</p>
<p>circulation through the limp to the</p>
<p>cells and they&rsquo;re also involved in a</p>
<p>communication of where they start to</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re supposed to end up so very</p>
<p>simply an apple lipoprotein is the</p>
<p>captain of the boat or the ship and</p>
<p>without them these lipoproteins would be</p>
<p>a mindless bag of fat and cholesterol we</p>
<p>talked about the chylomicrons they came</p>
<p>from the small intestine they came from</p>
<p>food you just ate they got loaded up</p>
<p>with those triglycerides a nice big</p>
<p>payload and then they got sent on their</p>
<p>way to then go ahead and provide that to</p>
<p>your tissues as soon as possible and</p>
<p>once they did and they lost their cargo</p>
<p>they then ultimately get</p>
<p>absorbed back at the liver but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a line that comes from the liver</p>
<p>primarily of triglycerides that came</p>
<p>ultimately from your fat stores from</p>
<p>your body so when you&rsquo;re fasting you</p>
<p>absolutely are pulling more of those</p>
<p>triglycerides into these vldls to then</p>
<p>move around and they move into something</p>
<p>known as ideals intermediate density</p>
<p>lipoproteins which can also be absorbed</p>
<p>and this is the story of energy delivery</p>
<p>at least in terms of fatty acids direct</p>
<p>delivery so now let&rsquo;s talk about this</p>
<p>other part of what lipoproteins do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just energy delivery</p>
<p>their support you guys have all heard</p>
<p>about HDL the so-called good cholesterol</p>
<p>what they really mean is the cholesterol</p>
<p>found inside these lipoproteins these</p>
<p>boats and these are in fact very good</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very good in your system you</p>
<p>want them operating and doing very well</p>
<p>you just like to see your HDL</p>
<p>cholesterol very high well they also</p>
<p>work closely with LDL particles the so</p>
<p>called bad cholesterol but of course</p>
<p>what they mean is the cholesterol found</p>
<p>in low-density lipoproteins the boat now</p>
<p>you notice this is the one line that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pulling double-duty</p>
<p>you see chylomicrons they&rsquo;re pretty much</p>
<p>delivering energy HDL is pretty much in</p>
<p>a support role this is the energy</p>
<p>delivery this is the support only only</p>
<p>the purple line only vldls to ideals to</p>
<p>LDLs have two jobs</p>
<p>the first job being energy delivery the</p>
<p>second job being in its support role and</p>
<p>I showed you a couple of those support</p>
<p>roles for example in being able to clear</p>
<p>pathogens and also neutralizing free</p>
<p>radicals with vitamin E also known as</p>
<p>alpha tocopheryl you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>remember that just remember the vitamin</p>
<p>E so now you have to say okay now hold</p>
<p>on I&rsquo;ve heard that high v LDLs and</p>
<p>triglycerides are associated with</p>
<p>disease that&rsquo;s true if they&rsquo;re lingering</p>
<p>how do you know if they&rsquo;re lingering you</p>
<p>know because it comes up in your blood</p>
<p>test so oftentimes when I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>people about triglyceride so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being</p>
<p>fueled by triglycerides they go and</p>
<p>understand Dave I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>I see that my triglycerides have dropped</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s correct because your usage</p>
<p>of triglycerides has gone up you&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>using your fat at a much higher degree</p>
<p>and therefore there&rsquo;s less and less</p>
<p>triglycerides per boat and that might</p>
<p>mean that there&rsquo;s more LDL particles</p>
<p>that started out as vldls that deliver</p>
<p>the fatty acids you following me all</p>
<p>right so now let&rsquo;s talk about my low</p>
<p>carb cholesterol challenge I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>keep putting this into my presentations</p>
<p>until it finally gets answered but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna say about eight months ago I open</p>
<p>this challenge and I wanted to put it</p>
<p>out to all sorts of different people I</p>
<p>paint a lot of Lokar a lot of</p>
<p>lipid-lowering experts people who are</p>
<p>not necessarily low-carb who say look</p>
<p>you guys are getting overly comforted</p>
<p>when you have high LDL cholesterol just</p>
<p>because you have high HDL cholesterol</p>
<p>and low triglycerides I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>constantly call this the triad</p>
<p>those three together and I said that</p>
<p>okay great so why don&rsquo;t we start looking</p>
<p>at the studies that actually examine all</p>
<p>three of these together the high LDL</p>
<p>cholesterol that so-called bad</p>
<p>cholesterol the high HDL cholesterol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so-called good cholesterol the low</p>
<p>triglycerides because from what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>seeing doesn&rsquo;t look as if there is as</p>
<p>much of a problem but I want to see some</p>
<p>conflicting data so I had this up eight</p>
<p>months ago for six months while I had</p>
<p>this up I got no studies they have done</p>
<p>studies from the other direction again</p>
<p>studies that have shown the opposite</p>
<p>including from our friends at Framingham</p>
<p>this actually was about four thousand</p>
<p>different people and what I loved about</p>
<p>this was it also excluded users of</p>
<p>lipid-lowering therapy so you have a</p>
<p>nice fresh batch of people who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already have cardiovascular disease at</p>
<p>baseline to see what a difference it</p>
<p>would make for them with heart disease</p>
<p>and this is what we saw I&rsquo;m sorry is a</p>
<p>little bit mumbo jumbo but the o.r above</p>
<p>is called the odds ratio generally you</p>
<p>want that to be as low as possible</p>
<p>people everybody with an LDL cholesterol</p>
<p>higher than 100 so long as they had</p>
<p>low triglycerides in high HDL we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing fantastic well okay maybe this was</p>
<p>including those people who had like say</p>
<p>an LDL of 102 or 103 so fortunately on</p>
<p>the same chart we also have people who</p>
<p>have an LDL above 130 now that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>higher but guess what it&rsquo;s the same 0.7</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re talking significantly higher</p>
<p>levels of LDL cholesterol it&rsquo;s still so</p>
<p>much better but I actually got another</p>
<p>study this one I liked even more because</p>
<p>in this case they were actually using</p>
<p>men who of course are tend to be a lot</p>
<p>higher risk for hardy vascular disease</p>
<p>around 3,000 of them 53 to 74 and they</p>
<p>divided the group by those who have an</p>
<p>LDL of a hundred and seventy or less a</p>
<p>hundred and seventy or less that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely high or so we&rsquo;re told to one</p>
<p>hundred and seventy or more but if you</p>
<p>look the darkened bar on the left side</p>
<p>is HDL cholesterol that is above fifty</p>
<p>seven triglycerides below ninety seven</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the tertiary if the line is</p>
<p>almost identical on both sides whether</p>
<p>you had whether you had a high or low</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol you ended up in better</p>
<p>shape regardless so long as your HDL was</p>
<p>high the difference is less than two</p>
<p>thirds and 1% but I really want to call</p>
<p>your attention to even more strikingly</p>
<p>at the top end at the risk level where</p>
<p>your HDL is low and your triglycerides</p>
<p>are high that&rsquo;s nearly identical</p>
<p>regardless of your LDL so I can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>it I keep looking at data like this and</p>
<p>I say low LDL high LDL does it seem to</p>
<p>matter as much as HDL and triglycerides</p>
<p>now through a little more humor on it I</p>
<p>said I had that challenge up for six</p>
<p>months two months ago as of two days</p>
<p>coming I went ahead and put some money</p>
<p>behind it so I actually I actually I put</p>
<p>it out there that I would like to give</p>
<p>three hundred dollars to anybody who can</p>
<p>find me at least one study just</p>
<p>one study that showed those people who</p>
<p>have high HDL and low triglycerides with</p>
<p>high LDL would have a higher rate of</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease and I even made</p>
<p>it not even high I said just above</p>
<p>average and I wanted to use the numbers</p>
<p>that the American Heart Association a</p>
<p>lot of different like heart.org for</p>
<p>example just just just above average and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to see one study and I&rsquo;ve now</p>
<p>put money behind it I have not spent one</p>
<p>time of that bounty thus far so with</p>
<p>that in mind I&rsquo;m gonna show you some</p>
<p>very very surprising data that came out</p>
<p>of the most recent experiment that I did</p>
<p>with the weight gain and this experiment</p>
<p>before I start talking about it I want</p>
<p>to emphasize to everybody don&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>there are a number of experiments that I</p>
<p>kind of have - okey half knots aid I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing this so that you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>this experiment in particular some</p>
<p>people get inspired to do experiments</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve done this is not one of them I</p>
<p>actually knew I&rsquo;d need to induce a state</p>
<p>of hyperinsulinemia to accomplish this</p>
<p>but I had an opportunity scenario you</p>
<p>see I still had some weight left over</p>
<p>from a previous couple of experiments my</p>
<p>capstone in my sugar experiments</p>
<p>you have to read up on my blog to hear</p>
<p>about that I know how crazy that sounds</p>
<p>and I had an upcoming trip with an</p>
<p>understanding wife can I just set the</p>
<p>scene there was one night where I walk</p>
<p>into the bedroom and she&rsquo;s reading and I</p>
<p>go you know honey had really helped my</p>
<p>research a lot if I could gain about 20</p>
<p>pounds of fat that&rsquo;s how awesome she is</p>
<p>so you know okay who are the experiment</p>
<p>upsides obviously this was a chance to</p>
<p>observe and compare cholesterol at</p>
<p>higher weight on a standard American</p>
<p>diet and to observe what happens when we</p>
<p>change over to ketogenic diet almost all</p>
<p>of that data will be available on the</p>
<p>blog soon but there was an obvious</p>
<p>experiment downside there is short and</p>
<p>long-term risks</p>
<p>I knew this going in and I made this</p>
<p>clear to my wife and I made this clear</p>
<p>to everybody else which is why I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want anyone else to do this obviously</p>
<p>inducing a high level hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>is not recommended under any</p>
<p>circumstance just avoid that in general</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anything you take from this</p>
<p>conference it&rsquo;s that so you can actually</p>
<p>see this in the media that I was doing</p>
<p>it around the time of the experiment you</p>
<p>can see my face gets a lot puffy or my</p>
<p>neck gets puffy or etc and this was the</p>
<p>timeline is fairly straightforward Oh</p>
<p>kind of cuts it off a little bit but you</p>
<p>can see I was a little bit of a ramp up</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mainly through the month of</p>
<p>April that I&rsquo;m actually gaining this</p>
<p>weight and here&rsquo;s what I was eating</p>
<p>bread a lot of bread I had a lot of</p>
<p>cheesy bread I had a lot of sandwiches</p>
<p>and I had that&rsquo;s like a chunky steak</p>
<p>meat pie that I was getting from a place</p>
<p>called pie-faced in Australia and I</p>
<p>actually intentionally avoided a lot of</p>
<p>sugary treats because I just wanted to</p>
<p>see you know what would come up with</p>
<p>just a lot of starchy foods just just in</p>
<p>case you were curious works like a charm</p>
<p>in lots of weight I hadn&rsquo;t yet gained my</p>
<p>my goal weight of 205 so fortunately I</p>
<p>was moving now into a new phase of the</p>
<p>timeline which is for five days I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>doing a controlled standard American</p>
<p>diet experiment by that I mean I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>eating to a particular plan what does</p>
<p>that plan look like looks like this at</p>
<p>10 a.m. I&rsquo;d have a footlong Subway</p>
<p>sandwich at 3 p.m. I would have a medium</p>
<p>pepperoni pizza and then at a p.m. I to</p>
<p>have another footlong Subway sandwich</p>
<p>total calories 4217 hungry do you think</p>
<p>I gain weight</p>
<p>I gained weight that didn&rsquo;t quite give</p>
<p>me to my 205 but I was I was really</p>
<p>ready to stop it there by the way for</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s contemplating leaving he</p>
<p>doe going I wonder what it&rsquo;s like to be</p>
<p>like this I wonder if they&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>enjoyed it you really honestly did not</p>
<p>enjoy it I&rsquo;m gonna say there&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>thing I find that I miss when I ever I</p>
<p>do these experiments that take me back</p>
<p>to carbs and I&rsquo;ll be honest about this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hand-holding part that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to use like knives and forks</p>
<p>as much that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s all anything</p>
<p>else I feel like I get just fine with</p>
<p>keto so okay I&rsquo;d then take a huge number</p>
<p>of tests and I want to point just to one</p>
<p>in particular that third one from the</p>
<p>left up there that&rsquo;s my blood pressure</p>
<p>it reads 140 over 86 I&rsquo;m telling you my</p>
<p>blood pressure normally is around I want</p>
<p>to say 104 over 71 maybe so I really was</p>
<p>ready to step off this experiment I was</p>
<p>getting quite a bit concern now I then</p>
<p>took a whole bunch of blood tests you</p>
<p>only need to be you don&rsquo;t need to pay</p>
<p>attention to that but then I finally got</p>
<p>to move to the keto phase which was a</p>
<p>lot more refreshing now I got to have</p>
<p>sausage scrambled eggs and I did have to</p>
<p>keep it somewhat mundane so that I could</p>
<p>control for all the variables so it</p>
<p>otherwise was a lot of cheese and</p>
<p>hard-boiled eggs with some almonds this</p>
<p>was a lot better 2437 calories total</p>
<p>carbs 20 and this is effectively what</p>
<p>the controlled phase moving into the</p>
<p>other control phase of the key to look</p>
<p>like so I was literally eating the same</p>
<p>thing in about the same way every single</p>
<p>day and as I like to joke it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like Groundhog Day I like when the</p>
<p>audience laughs that because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel as old when I say that and so now</p>
<p>if we look at my triglycerides versus</p>
<p>the way my triglycerides in the blood</p>
<p>versus the way we can&rsquo;t really tell a</p>
<p>lot and that&rsquo;s because this isn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>relative comparison but what if I take</p>
<p>my relative or if I take my weight and</p>
<p>actually do a relative comparison so</p>
<p>that we can see what&rsquo;s happening between</p>
<p>that five-pound Delta well we see that</p>
<p>it looks like this striking my</p>
<p>triglycerides were much higher during</p>
<p>the standard American diet started</p>
<p>dropping as I started dropping weight</p>
<p>but here</p>
<p>the kicker how many of you guys have</p>
<p>heard show of hands how many guys have</p>
<p>heard that your LDL cholesterol can go</p>
<p>up as you&rsquo;re losing weight well I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been hearing this for years and as the</p>
<p>cholesterol guy I really wanted to know</p>
<p>and now this was my one chance going</p>
<p>from a standard American diet to keto</p>
<p>and losing weight at the same time I</p>
<p>finally got to find out and this is what</p>
<p>that looks like</p>
<p>my LDL cholesterol had started at a much</p>
<p>lower level at 133 which I&rsquo;m sure my</p>
<p>doctor would have been a lot happier</p>
<p>with and then as I started losing the</p>
<p>weight it jumped up to 228 that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>change of over a hundred milligrams per</p>
<p>deciliter or close to a hundred</p>
<p>milligrams per deciliter through a delta</p>
<p>of just five pounds of weight loss so</p>
<p>without question from now on whenever</p>
<p>anybody is actively losing weight I say</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t even look at your lipids but</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even bother with it right this is</p>
<p>what it looks like when we invert the</p>
<p>pattern it&rsquo;s actually quite striking and</p>
<p>the pure scent is amazing it at point</p>
<p>nine three six okay now I&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>new data you&rsquo;ll notice this table over</p>
<p>here is now starting to pay attention</p>
<p>they were used to my other stuff so this</p>
<p>is the resistance training experiment</p>
<p>now enough you guys have heard but I was</p>
<p>on a podcast recently otherwise I was</p>
<p>the Peter Atia drive and I had a habit</p>
<p>of doing this I have a habit of</p>
<p>announcing my hypotheses in advance</p>
<p>publicly I by the way I had a friend who</p>
<p>said you shouldn&rsquo;t do that because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna eventually embarrass</p>
<p>yourself I said I thought that actually</p>
<p>was what science was is too you know put</p>
<p>forth your hypothesis before you test</p>
<p>the experiment and he said and by the</p>
<p>way he&rsquo;s a PhD grad he goes well not</p>
<p>anymore so I&rsquo;m going to tell you them</p>
<p>this is the mumbo jumbo and then I have</p>
<p>a translation one for the next one so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna read this aloud again more</p>
<p>Theory this is me talking to Peter I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually going to be testing intensive</p>
<p>exercise myself in the next series of</p>
<p>experiments that I&rsquo;m doing there is a</p>
<p>difference between those people who are</p>
<p>doing things like say endurance running</p>
<p>and those who are weightlifting or</p>
<p>resistance training in that I think</p>
<p>there is a greater overall gradient of</p>
<p>reset</p>
<p>Durr mediated endocytosis for muscle</p>
<p>repair and growth don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>translation coming I could be wrong</p>
<p>about that but I&rsquo;ll be very curious to</p>
<p>see if it turns out to be the case when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it myself and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>translation of what I really said I said</p>
<p>I think when you make your muscles sore</p>
<p>they eat LDL particles to repair and</p>
<p>grow I hadn&rsquo;t yet done this experiment</p>
<p>at the time that I did the podcast so I</p>
<p>was very excited to do it this ended up</p>
<p>being the longest controlled experiment</p>
<p>well before I get started let me tell</p>
<p>you how I thought of that well you see</p>
<p>this is a cell membrane and a cell</p>
<p>membrane is made up of two things</p>
<p>especially phospholipids it&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>lipid and cholesterol that&rsquo;s what that</p>
<p>little orange guy is there right what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a low-density lipoprotein made up of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made up of phospholipids and you</p>
<p>get one guess Wester all okay so why is</p>
<p>there this process that cells have halt</p>
<p>that long word I used before receptor</p>
<p>mediated endocytosis basically the</p>
<p>engulfing of a lipoprotein why do they</p>
<p>have that well i had speculated for some</p>
<p>time that that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s for raw</p>
<p>material certainly they would say cells</p>
<p>have enough on hand to be able to repair</p>
<p>and synthesize their own cholesterol for</p>
<p>the most part I think that they&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>but what if the man climbs if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck in your home you may have enough</p>
<p>in your garage to be able to do repairs</p>
<p>to your drywall what if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if Home</p>
<p>Depot was driving by your house every</p>
<p>five minutes saying aide you need</p>
<p>anything doing anything so my theory was</p>
<p>very simple I believed that if I could</p>
<p>control for every other thing that there</p>
<p>was that if I did some intensive</p>
<p>exercise I would see a drop in my LDL</p>
<p>cholesterol because there&rsquo;d be a drop in</p>
<p>my LDL particle count but in order to do</p>
<p>that I would need to like live my life</p>
<p>the same way day after day after day I</p>
<p>think I could do that okay that was the</p>
<p>plan try to keep everything identical</p>
<p>from one day to the next for 20</p>
<p>days straight so I need to have a big</p>
<p>washout period so I can be sure that I</p>
<p>had a baseline and that was gonna have</p>
<p>the same things the same way every day</p>
<p>but on top of that also control for</p>
<p>exercise I did my usual 2.5 miles of</p>
<p>walking in the afternoon every time and</p>
<p>this is what that looked like no these</p>
<p>are not duplicate pictures this is</p>
<p>literally the pictures they took on</p>
<p>those days and at those times so I</p>
<p>wanted to be sure I control for</p>
<p>everything that I could including even</p>
<p>sleep which I wasn&rsquo;t always as</p>
<p>successful with and this is what it</p>
<p>looked like this was all of my lipid</p>
<p>numbers taken for my cardio check day</p>
<p>after day up until the first</p>
<p>intervention period then this is what</p>
<p>happened we see not only does it dip</p>
<p>down but actually it starts to come back</p>
<p>up right around the time I happen to be</p>
<p>doing the second intervention phase and</p>
<p>what did that look like that look like</p>
<p>this you can actually see clearly very</p>
<p>well delineated an intervention phase</p>
<p>one we see a drop of around 11% on</p>
<p>intervention phase two where I actually</p>
<p>really hit it I did the weights I went</p>
<p>to the gym and I also got vibration</p>
<p>plates my LDL cholesterol dropped 13%</p>
<p>keeping all other things the same now I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t prove that that was entirely into</p>
<p>cytosis I don&rsquo;t even know for sure how</p>
<p>much of that it was into scientists but</p>
<p>do I believe that that&rsquo;s still the case</p>
<p>yes what does it take to do that it</p>
<p>takes this takes being able to isolate</p>
<p>every other variable this was also one</p>
<p>other thing I just wanted to point out</p>
<p>that I thought was fascinating as you</p>
<p>can see on the intervention phase I was</p>
<p>also doing glucose versus ketones the</p>
<p>glucose are in the blue at the top the</p>
<p>glucose actually didn&rsquo;t change that much</p>
<p>but the key talents sure did he tone</p>
<p>production actually went up quite a bit</p>
<p>or I should say perhaps the overage</p>
<p>would have quite a bit because we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually see the uptake coming into the</p>
<p>cells I thought that was actually quite</p>
<p>fascinating as you can see it starts to</p>
<p>taper back down toward the end of the</p>
<p>experiment now I told you about the fat</p>
<p>experiment I actually want to come back</p>
<p>to because one of the most powerful</p>
<p>slides I have in any presentation I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you now and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>gonna drive home a lot of how I</p>
<p>understand LDL cholesterol and</p>
<p>why it is that I still have the state of</p>
<p>uncertainty that I do as far as its risk</p>
<p>so the carotid intima-media thickness</p>
<p>test is a test along the carotid</p>
<p>arteries that are along the side of your</p>
<p>neck and it&rsquo;s supposed to be effectively</p>
<p>in his used in many studies as a proxy</p>
<p>for a thorough sporadic burden what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to do is measure both the</p>
<p>thickness of your intima and your media</p>
<p>together now I have been tracking mine</p>
<p>every six months starting in July of</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>every six months to my surprise and</p>
<p>appreciation my left carotid artery was</p>
<p>slowly regressing not progressing it</p>
<p>should actually be staying the same or</p>
<p>going up with my age that&rsquo;s the normal</p>
<p>progression but yet it was actually</p>
<p>going down my right carotid artery</p>
<p>started much higher started at 600 I</p>
<p>want to say around 680 something along</p>
<p>those lines it actually dropped about a</p>
<p>hundred and fifty nanometers while I was</p>
<p>on this ketogenic diet but you remember</p>
<p>I then after we go through all of this I</p>
<p>then go ahead and have the standard</p>
<p>American diet experiment I take my C IMT</p>
<p>toward the end of that standard American</p>
<p>diet experiment and I&rsquo;ll say I was</p>
<p>speculating there was a chance that</p>
<p>might move north right well sure enough</p>
<p>the left carotid artery jumped up higher</p>
<p>than it had ever been before the right</p>
<p>likewise in fact if you add that last</p>
<p>line you can see just what a pronounced</p>
<p>difference it is following four weeks of</p>
<p>a standard American experiment standard</p>
<p>American diet experiment I really have</p>
<p>to say for any of you guys who right now</p>
<p>are thinking you know what I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take a break from keto for the</p>
<p>holidays</p>
<p>I want this burned into your head now</p>
<p>obviously I can be somewhat jovial about</p>
<p>it because I am banking on the</p>
<p>regression restarting again and if in</p>
<p>fact that turns out to be true that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be some pretty powerful data there&rsquo;s me</p>
<p>making another public hypothesis about</p>
<p>my data we&rsquo;ll see how that turns out now</p>
<p>this went from the lowest ever on both</p>
<p>sides both sides not one side to the</p>
<p>highest ever on both sides showing just</p>
<p>how much of a difference it makes but</p>
<p>this is the part that&rsquo;s going to bring</p>
<p>it home you see I already read in the</p>
<p>literature several times one of the</p>
<p>contributing factors not just to a</p>
<p>thorough score attic plaque but in</p>
<p>particular to the carotid intima-media</p>
<p>thickness is as you can see highlighted</p>
<p>a high lipoprotein levels high</p>
<p>lipoprotein levels yet look closely if</p>
<p>we add this last column on ldlc and LDL</p>
<p>P I was averaging 200 LDL 200 milligrams</p>
<p>per deciliter of LDL 200 or more</p>
<p>throughout this period of time and my</p>
<p>LDL particle count was 2,000 or more</p>
<p>both considered well into the 90th</p>
<p>percentile of risk at those levels my</p>
<p>left and right carotid arteries were</p>
<p>regressing so what happened to my LDL</p>
<p>see in my LDL P I&rsquo;ll give you a hint</p>
<p>when I did the standard American diet as</p>
<p>I hypothesized would happen my LDL see</p>
<p>dropped to what it was before I started</p>
<p>keto how much did it drop dropped to 130</p>
<p>my LDL particle was what would be</p>
<p>considered a much more attractive 1130</p>
<p>so if you were looking at this chart</p>
<p>alone and you were saying hey what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best thing that I could do to help</p>
<p>regress the thickness of my intima you</p>
<p>would come to the conclusion the thing I</p>
<p>was doing in the first four rows makes</p>
<p>more sense than the thing I did in the</p>
<p>last row that&rsquo;s why this data is so</p>
<p>powerful even though it&rsquo;s only ten data</p>
<p>points so far I want to do one big thank</p>
<p>you to my patrons I want to emphasize</p>
<p>something to all of you I take no money</p>
<p>from any corporate entity in order to</p>
<p>maintain the integrity of my data and so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate</p>
<p>to have literally a hundred and sixty</p>
<p>plus people who actually directly</p>
<p>support my patreon which makes this</p>
<p>research possible could you please give</p>
<p>them a round of applause for me</p>
<p>and thank you so much for your time I</p>
<p>really appreciate it I&rsquo;m really in love</p>
<p>in this conference thank you so much</p>
<p>you</p>
