    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 28, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians.</p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;re going to turn our attention northward, to the peoples of Northern Europe</p>
<p>who spoke the Germanic dialects which became Old English.</p>
<p>These were the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and we can probably add in the Frisians, as</p>
<p>well as some Franks.</p>
<p>All of these people spoke closely related West Germanic languages, and they all lived</p>
<p>in the same general region near the North Sea before the migrations to Britain began</p>
<p>around the 4th and 5th centuries.</p>
<p>It probably goes without saying that the historical events described over the next couple of episodes</p>
<p>are some of the most important and significant events in the overall history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because these events represent the origin of the language.</p>
<p>If these events had not occurred, there would be no England, or English language.</p>
<p>The Germanic dialects of the early Anglo-Saxon tribes would have remained on the continent,</p>
<p>and there, they would have likely blended into the modern Low German and Dutch dialects.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s what happened to the language of the Saxons who actually remained on the</p>
<p>continent.</p>
<p>And even if the language of the Anglo-Saxons had somehow survived as a distinct language</p>
<p>on the continent, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a language that we would recognize today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the British Isles, the Celtic languages would have continued to dominate</p>
<p>the entire region, at least until the arrival of the Vikings and the Normans.</p>
<p>But of course, that&rsquo;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Instead, the Anglo-Saxons moved to Britain, where they developed a new culture, and eventually,</p>
<p>a new language.</p>
<p>So this basically marks the beginning of the transition to the second volume of the podcast,</p>
<p>The Period of the Anglo-Saxons and Old English.</p>
<p>But before we make this transition, let me make a few preliminary notes.</p>
<p>First, up to this point, we&rsquo;ve explored the background of English, what we might call</p>
<p>pre-English.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the first 27 episodes was to explore the period from the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language to the fall of the Roman Empire, and the impact that those events had on the</p>
<p>languages of Western Europe.</p>
<p>So obviously, I&rsquo;ve taken a very broad approach to the topic of English.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to continue to do that as we move forward.</p>
<p>The emphasis will shift to the British Isles, but I&rsquo;m going to continue to look at developments</p>
<p>elsewhere, especially in continental Europe and specifically within the region which we</p>
<p>will come to know as France.</p>
<p>Because the developments there will have a huge impact on English after 1066.</p>
<p>In fact, those developments will change English from an unrecognizable Germanic language into</p>
<p>a language that we can actually read and understand today.</p>
<p>I will also continue to look at political and cultural developments as they impacted</p>
<p>the language over time.</p>
<p>But this is not going to be a full, proper history of England.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the expertise to deliver that kind of history, and frankly, there are much</p>
<p>better podcasts out there if you&rsquo;re interested in the overall history of England.</p>
<p>In fact, let me recommend David Crowther&rsquo;s excellent History of England podcast if you</p>
<p>want a more complete history of the Anglo-Saxons and England.</p>
<p>Not only do I enjoy listening to David&rsquo;s podcast, but he was actually one of the first podcasters</p>
<p>to reach out to me when I began this podcast to give me some words of encouragement.</p>
<p>And this is a good time to mention David&rsquo;s podcast, since it begins with the arrival</p>
<p>of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain.</p>
<p>You might also check out the British History podcast by Jamie Jeffers, which begins with</p>
<p>the arrival of the Romans in Britain.</p>
<p>And if you want an enjoyable monarch-by-monarch look at English history, you can try the Rex</p>
<p>Factor podcast, which I also recommend.</p>
<p>So with those plugs out of the way, let&rsquo;s turn to the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>and the people who gave us the Old English language.</p>
<p>Over the past few episodes, most of our attention has been focused on Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It was in this region that the Goths challenged the Roman Empire and eventually established</p>
<p>Gothic kingdoms in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>And we looked at other Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Alemanni and the Vandals.</p>
<p>And while these tribes were busy crossing the Rhine and the Danube into Roman territory,</p>
<p>there was another group of Germanic tribes living in the north along the North Sea coast,</p>
<p>basically the Netherlands and northern Germany and southern Denmark.</p>
<p>And those tribes were sort of in the background, more focused on expanding along the North</p>
<p>Sea than expanding down into Gaul.</p>
<p>Obviously, geography was a factor here.</p>
<p>These tribes had direct access to the North Sea.</p>
<p>And powerful Franks stood between them and the Rhine.</p>
<p>So when the Roman Empire began to collapse, their focus was always going to be more on</p>
<p>expansion by sea rather than land.</p>
<p>So who were these people?</p>
<p>Well, remember that Tacitus had identified this group of West Germanic tribes as the</p>
<p>Ingbionis, and he placed them in the same North Sea region at the end of the first century.</p>
<p>Tacitus mentioned a tribe among these people called the Frisii, who lived along the coast</p>
<p>of the modern Netherlands.</p>
<p>And this was the region that was the home of the Frisians during the later centuries.</p>
<p>He also mentioned a tribe called the Anglii, who lived around the southern region of modern</p>
<p>day Denmark.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the geography of Denmark, the mainland part of Denmark is</p>
<p>a peninsula which sticks out into the sea.</p>
<p>It basically forms the dividing line between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>This peninsula is called Jutland, and the Anglii lived in the southern part of that</p>
<p>peninsula.</p>
<p>By the way, Lewis Henwood has been kind enough to prepare a map for this episode, which shows</p>
<p>the locations of the various tribes in northern Europe.</p>
<p>So check out the website, historyofenglishpodcast.com, if you want to see where the tribes were initially</p>
<p>located.</p>
<p>So where did the name of the Anglii come from?</p>
<p>Well, the answer may lie in the geography of the Jutland Peninsula where the early Anglii</p>
<p>lived.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no universal agreement regarding the etymology of the name of the Anglii.</p>
<p>But the most prominent theory holds that the name comes from the fact that the peninsula</p>
<p>where the Angles lived happens to stick out into the ocean, forming a hook shape.</p>
<p>And the early Germans called a fish hook an Anga.</p>
<p>So they may have used that term for the name of the tribe that lived in that region, which</p>
<p>resembled a hook shape.</p>
<p>So Anga, meaning hook, came to mean the people who lived in the hook-shaped region of the</p>
<p>Jutland Peninsula, the Anglii.</p>
<p>That Germanic word Anga, meaning hook or fish hook, passed into Old English as Angle, where</p>
<p>it retained its original meaning.</p>
<p>And that word still exists in modern English.</p>
<p>We sometimes call a fisherman an angler.</p>
<p>And fishing with a fish hook is angling.</p>
<p>By the way, you may be wondering what the connection is between the word angle, meaning</p>
<p>hook or fish hook, and the use of the word angle in geometry, as in 90 degree angle or</p>
<p>the angle of the sun.</p>
<p>Well, angle is one of those words that comes to us in modern English from two completely</p>
<p>different sources.</p>
<p>But today, they both have the same spelling and same pronunciation.</p>
<p>And they have related meanings.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, the use of angle as hook comes from the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But the use of angle in geometry comes from Greek, via Latin and later French.</p>
<p>And as you may have figured out by now, when we have two very similar words coming to us</p>
<p>from different language families, we can suspect a common Indo-European origin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the case here.</p>
<p>Germanic angle and Greek angle both come from the same Indo-European root word, ang, which</p>
<p>meant to bend.</p>
<p>So, within the Germanic language family, it was used to describe something bent or curved,</p>
<p>like a hook.</p>
<p>But within early Greek, it was used to describe something that was bent or crooked, like a</p>
<p>crooked road or corner.</p>
<p>And from there, it was used in early Greek geometry to mean the measurement of intersecting</p>
<p>lines.</p>
<p>So, the curvy nature of the word angle, as in fishhook, is Germanic.</p>
<p>And the sharp nature of the word, as in 45-degree angle, is Greek.</p>
<p>But both come from the same Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>By the way, that Indo-European root word gave us another word as well.</p>
<p>The place where your foot protrudes from your leg is an ankle.</p>
<p>Again, this goes back to the same Indo-European root word, meaning to bend, and it comes to</p>
<p>us via the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So, in the same way that the bend where the Jutland Peninsula extends into the ocean is</p>
<p>called the home of the angles, the bend where your foot extends from your leg is called</p>
<p>your ankle.</p>
<p>And that word ankle also shows us the close links between the angles and the Frisians.</p>
<p>The original Old English version of the word was ankleal, and it appears that ankleal was</p>
<p>a combination of that Indo-European root word ang, meaning bend, and kleal, meaning claw.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the original version of the word claw.</p>
<p>But at some later point, after the Viking invasion of Britain and the heavy influence</p>
<p>of Old Norse, the pronunciation changed from ankleal to ankle.</p>
<p>This later pronunciation resembled the Old Norse pronunciation, but it was also almost</p>
<p>identical to the Frisian pronunciation.</p>
<p>And many modern linguists still believe that the Frisian version of ankle somehow influenced</p>
<p>this later pronunciation change in Middle English.</p>
<p>Both onkle and ongle received their modern pronunciations after the English vowel shifted</p>
<p>shortly before the time of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the vowel a shifted from the pronunciation in continental Europe,</p>
<p>which was a, to the modern long pronunciation a.</p>
<p>So onkle and ongle became ankle and angle.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen where the name angles comes from, and as I&rsquo;ve noted, Tacitus mentioned</p>
<p>both the angles and the Frisii in the North Sea region.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t mention the Saxons or the Franks at all.</p>
<p>You might remember that both of those groups were tribal coalitions or confederations which</p>
<p>formed in the years after Tacitus.</p>
<p>The first mention of a tribe called the Saxons occurred in the middle of the second century.</p>
<p>The Greek geographer Ptolemy placed them along the North Sea coast around modern-day Holstein</p>
<p>in northern Germany.</p>
<p>So between the time of Tacitus and Ptolemy, several of the smaller tribes in the region</p>
<p>had started to coalesce into this larger, unified tribe known as the Saxons.</p>
<p>This coalition probably included a prominent tribe mentioned by Tacitus called the Chossi.</p>
<p>And part of this coalition likely included the remnants of another tribe in the region</p>
<p>called the Longobards or Lombards.</p>
<p>Shortly after the time of Tacitus, the Lombard tribe began a general migration southward,</p>
<p>but some of the Lombards remained in northern Germany.</p>
<p>And those that remained were likely incorporated into this new Saxon confederation.</p>
<p>This is actually a very important point because it means that the Lombards probably spoke</p>
<p>a dialect which was very similar to the Saxon dialect during this early period.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see in an upcoming episode, the other group of Lombards which traveled southward</p>
<p>eventually settled in northern Italy and established a kingdom there after the fall of the</p>
<p>Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And that is actually the origin of the modern Lombardy region of northern Italy.</p>
<p>And by the time the Lombards reached northern Italy, their language had changed significantly.</p>
<p>And in fact, by the later date in the 6th century, their language reflected the changes</p>
<p>which had started to distinguish the Low German dialects in northern Germany from the High</p>
<p>German dialects in the mountainous regions of southern Germany.</p>
<p>So the migration of the Lombards provides some compelling evidence about the evolution</p>
<p>of the Germanic languages shortly after the Anglo-Saxons headed to Britain.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;ll look at that in a little more detail in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>The key point here is that some of the remnants of the early Lombards in northern Germany</p>
<p>likely became part of the original Saxon tribe.</p>
<p>Once the original Saxon tribe was formed, it continued to grow as other small neighboring</p>
<p>tribes also joined the coalition.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not known if these other tribes joined the Saxons voluntarily or if they were</p>
<p>conquered, but most historians believe it was a combination of both.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the Saxons were viewed as a warlike tribe and as a tribe which sought</p>
<p>to expand into neighboring regions.</p>
<p>And part of that tendency is reflected in the name Saxons.</p>
<p>Historians generally believe that the name of the tribe came from the type of sword they</p>
<p>commonly used, which was called the sax.</p>
<p>The word sax actually comes from an earlier Indo-European root word, sek, which meant</p>
<p>to cut.</p>
<p>That word passed into the Germanic languages as sax, meaning a knife or sword which cuts.</p>
<p>And a Saxon was a swordsman, someone who wielded the sax.</p>
<p>By the way, that original Indo-European root word also passed into Latin and later French</p>
<p>where it was used to mean something that had been cut off.</p>
<p>That word was sectioned.</p>
<p>So Saxon and section are cognate, both coming from the same Indo-European word meaning to</p>
<p>cut.</p>
<p>So those were the early Angles and Saxons.</p>
<p>But early historical sources tell us that there were other people who joined in the</p>
<p>later migration to Britain.</p>
<p>Supposedly, these people included the Jutes.</p>
<p>But who were the Jutes?</p>
<p>Well that actually remains a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>The only evidence as to the identity of the Jutes is the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark,</p>
<p>which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>As I noted, the Jutland Peninsula extends into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The Angles lived in the southern part of the peninsula, and the Jutes were their immediate</p>
<p>neighbors to the north.</p>
<p>In fact, the name of the peninsula, Jutland, basically means land of the Jutes.</p>
<p>So if this region of modern Denmark was the home of the Jutes, were these the same Jutes</p>
<p>who joined the Angles and Saxons in the migration to Britain?</p>
<p>Well, maybe or maybe not.</p>
<p>Geography would suggest that the answer is yes.</p>
<p>They lived in Jutland, and they were neighbors of the Angles, and they had direct access</p>
<p>to the North Sea along their western coast.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of problems which have perplexed later historians.</p>
<p>First, the people who lived in the central and northern portions of Jutland probably</p>
<p>spoke a North Germanic language.</p>
<p>Remember that the Germanic languages had become divided into three distinct groups by this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>The East Germanic languages included the language of the Goths.</p>
<p>The West Germanic languages included the languages of the Angles, Saxons, Frisians, Franks, and</p>
<p>other tribes further south.</p>
<p>But in the north, in the Scandinavian homeland, a distinct North Germanic language family</p>
<p>had emerged.</p>
<p>This was the origin of Old Norse, the language of the Vikings, and it&rsquo;s the ultimate origin</p>
<p>of the modern Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>Well, geography would strongly suggest that the Jutes spoke a North Germanic dialect,</p>
<p>which would have been quite different from the West Germanic languages of the Angles</p>
<p>and Saxons.</p>
<p>Now this poses some problems for language historians who have assumed that the languages</p>
<p>of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were all very closely related.</p>
<p>So closely related that they could probably communicate with each other without too much</p>
<p>difficulty.</p>
<p>But if the Jutes were from Jutland in Denmark, they probably would have spoken a language</p>
<p>that was quite a bit different from the early Anglo-Saxon dialects.</p>
<p>Now there are some explanations for this language issue.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a transitional region in between the Angles and the Jutes where the dialects</p>
<p>were more similar, and maybe these were the Jutes who accompanied the Angles and Saxons.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that we&rsquo;re still close enough to the original Germanic language that</p>
<p>the dialect differences were manageable.</p>
<p>But beyond the language issue, there&rsquo;s another reason why some scholars question whether</p>
<p>the Jutes actually came from Jutland.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the Jutes settled in Kent on the eastern coast of England.</p>
<p>But archaeological research in this region has uncovered grave goods which are the type</p>
<p>typically found in Frankish sites along the lower Rhine.</p>
<p>So one modern theory holds that the Jutes was a name given to Franks or a Frankish-Saxon</p>
<p>hybrid group that settled in Kent.</p>
<p>Now linguistically, this makes more sense because the Frankish language was closely</p>
<p>related to the Anglo-Saxon dialects.</p>
<p>And geographically, the area of Kent is located directly across the English Channel from</p>
<p>the region where the Frankish tribes lived.</p>
<p>Now a variation of this theory is that a group of Jutes originated in Jutland and then traveled</p>
<p>along the North Sea coast down to the Frankish coast where they settled for a while.</p>
<p>And there they adopted some of the culture of the Franks, and their language evolved</p>
<p>to become more like the West Germanic dialects spoken in that region.</p>
<p>And from there, they migrated across the English Channel to Britain, directly from</p>
<p>the Frankish territory, but they still retained the name Jutes.</p>
<p>Now this hybrid theory would help to explain some of the archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s just a theory.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s some other theories about the Jutes as well.</p>
<p>Another theory links them with the Geats in southern Sweden who feature prominently in Beowulf.</p>
<p>You might remember that Beowulf was a Geat, and was later the king of the Geats.</p>
<p>Well for purposes of this episode, we can just assume that the Jutes originated in Jutland,</p>
<p>but they may or may not have actually traveled directly from there to Britain.</p>
<p>Now despite the uncertainty concerning the Jutes, we have a pretty good idea as to the</p>
<p>origins and locations of the other tribes along the North Sea coast.</p>
<p>And at least in the case of the Saxons, these tribes actually extended pretty far inland</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>But beginning around the time of Tacitus in the first century, and continuing for a period</p>
<p>of about 500 years afterwards, the sea levels began to rise in the North Sea coastal region.</p>
<p>And that meant the region experienced a great deal of flooding.</p>
<p>Archaeological research confirms that settlements in the region began to be built on elevated</p>
<p>mounds during this period.</p>
<p>And flooding would have meant that good farmland would have become more limited.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last time, population growth in the region was another factor which was</p>
<p>causing many of these tribes to look elsewhere for land.</p>
<p>So the combination of flooding and population growth forced these tribes to expand outward</p>
<p>in order to survive.</p>
<p>By the third century, there was another factor at work, the imperial crisis in Rome.</p>
<p>The Alamanni and the Franks were making their first incursions across the Rhine into Gaul.</p>
<p>And around this same time, there&rsquo;s strong evidence that the early Anglo-Saxons took</p>
<p>to the sea to find places to raid and new places to settle.</p>
<p>The ships which they used were not as advanced as the ships of the later Vikings about five</p>
<p>or six centuries later.</p>
<p>So they probably had to hug the coast as they traveled westward.</p>
<p>And that meant they probably had to stop along the way in Frisia along the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>And this is part of the evidence that some Frisians were included in these excursions.</p>
<p>Now these North Sea people were not only exploring the coastal regions along Frisia and northern</p>
<p>Gaul.</p>
<p>They were also making brief excursions across the English Channel into southern Britain.</p>
<p>And part of the evidence of this early period of expansion was a system of defenses constructed</p>
<p>by the Roman Empire in the late third century.</p>
<p>Those defenses were built along the shores on both sides of the English Channel.</p>
<p>And the key is what the Romans called those defenses.</p>
<p>They called them the Saxon Shore.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much a confirmation that the defenses were built to deal with the Saxons</p>
<p>who were exploring and raiding along the coast.</p>
<p>Now we have to be a little careful with the use of that name Saxon Shore coined by the</p>
<p>Romans.</p>
<p>We probably can&rsquo;t take the title too literally.</p>
<p>It appears that the term Saxon was sometimes used as a general reference to any migrant</p>
<p>or raider from across the North Sea.</p>
<p>So it could have included Angles, Frisians, Franks, or Jutes.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s some strong parallels here to the later Viking invasion from just a little</p>
<p>further up the northern coast.</p>
<p>The first Vikings came as raiders.</p>
<p>Then they began to arrive in greater numbers as invaders.</p>
<p>And then they began to carve out entire regions where they settled.</p>
<p>Well the earlier Saxons did the same thing.</p>
<p>But again, even though the Romans called these defenses the Saxon Shore, the invading tribes</p>
<p>probably included the neighbors of the Saxons as well.</p>
<p>For example, we know that the language and culture of the Angles was very similar to</p>
<p>that of the Saxons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost impossible to distinguish the movements of the Angles from the movements</p>
<p>of the Saxons.</p>
<p>And the Franks were also expanding westward during this same time frame.</p>
<p>So some of these Roman defenses were probably aimed at invading Franks as well.</p>
<p>These various tribes first appeared as a collection of raiders and war bands with no centralized</p>
<p>political organization.</p>
<p>So these were not efforts to establish colonies as we would come to know them in more recent</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>A colony is established by a motherland and maintains a political connection to that mother</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the case here.</p>
<p>These were individual raiders and settlers just looking for new lands in which to settle.</p>
<p>Or in some cases, they were just looking for valuables to steal.</p>
<p>The only real difference between stealing land and stealing goods is how long you intend</p>
<p>to stay.</p>
<p>You can take goods and leave.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to take land, you have to stay and defend it.</p>
<p>And that takes a lot more people, especially in an era of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>So early on, the Saxon focus was more on raiding and leaving and taking anything of</p>
<p>value with them.</p>
<p>But as the Roman Empire began to decline, the Roman troops began to be called back to</p>
<p>the continent, and Roman defenses in northern Europe began to weaken and crumble.</p>
<p>Well now it became increasingly possible to take some of the land as well.</p>
<p>So we start to see a move from an era of raiding to an era of settlement.</p>
<p>By the late 4th century, the Saxon shore defenses had been largely abandoned across northern</p>
<p>Gaul as Rome increasingly withdrew troops from the region to deal with problems elsewhere.</p>
<p>And with those defenses abandoned, Saxon settlements began to appear along the coast of Gaul.</p>
<p>Over time, as the Franks expanded into this region, the Saxon coastal settlements were</p>
<p>assimilated into the new Frankish kingdom.</p>
<p>And this might help to explain the mystery of the Jutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that some of these coastal settlements along the coast of Gaul included</p>
<p>Jutes, and that some of those Jutes later migrated across the Channel to Britain.</p>
<p>That would explain why there are Frankish artifacts in the area supposedly settled by</p>
<p>the Jutes in eastern England.</p>
<p>Now even though the Romans abandoned the Saxon shore defenses in northern Gaul, they continued</p>
<p>to maintain the defenses in southern Britain.</p>
<p>Of course, somebody had to man those defenses, and that was an increasing problem for the</p>
<p>Romans during this period.</p>
<p>So they did what they often did in these situations, they brought in Germanic mercenaries.</p>
<p>This included the Franks and Alamanni, and it may have included Saxons as well.</p>
<p>If Saxons were included as mercenaries, that would make them the first Saxon settlers in</p>
<p>Britain.</p>
<p>Archaeology suggests that Saxons were present in eastern Britain during this period in the</p>
<p>4th century.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have excavated Roman cemeteries from this period in the region along the Lower</p>
<p>Thames, and they&rsquo;ve discovered belt fittings of the type and style typically worn by Frankish</p>
<p>and Saxon mercenaries.</p>
<p>And in the same region, sunken huts have been discovered which are believed to have been</p>
<p>built around the year 400.</p>
<p>These huts are constructed in a style typically associated with later Anglo-Saxon huts.</p>
<p>So these may have been the first Saxon settlers in Britain.</p>
<p>And they may have been in contact with other Saxons on the continent.</p>
<p>Roman records also indicate that Frisians were stationed in Britain during this period</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>They were also there as mercenaries in other parts of the island.</p>
<p>Now these Frisians would have known about the weaknesses of the Roman defenses in Britain.</p>
<p>And this information could have been communicated back to Frisia.</p>
<p>So the general picture which is emerging in Britain during the 4th century is the gradual</p>
<p>withdrawal of Roman troops to the continent and the gradual increase of Germanic mercenaries</p>
<p>to deal with the local threats.</p>
<p>These threats not only included the Germanic tribes who were threatening the coast, but</p>
<p>it also included threats from northern Britain as well.</p>
<p>In the regions north of the Roman territory, in the area of modern-day Scotland, there</p>
<p>was a native tribe called the Picts.</p>
<p>And there was another tribe in the region with ultimate origins in Ireland called the</p>
<p>Scots.</p>
<p>And as I said, the Picts were a native people who spoke their own language.</p>
<p>We know virtually nothing about the language other than a few place names with Pictish</p>
<p>origins.</p>
<p>Now some scholars think that long-term Celtic influences may have resulted in a Pictish</p>
<p>language which was basically Celtic or a pre-Celtic language with strong Celtic influences.</p>
<p>At any rate, we&rsquo;ll probably never know much about their language.</p>
<p>But the Scots did speak a Celtic language.</p>
<p>And over many centuries, the power of the Picts declined as the Scots expanded throughout</p>
<p>the region.</p>
<p>So eventually, the Picts became assimilated into the Scots and basically disappeared as</p>
<p>a distinct group.</p>
<p>But for now, during the last few centuries of Roman Britain, the Picts were the major</p>
<p>threat in northern Britain.</p>
<p>So Roman Britain had to deal with Picts and Scots invading by land from the north as well</p>
<p>as Saxons and other Germanic tribes arriving by sea from the east and the south.</p>
<p>And in a fascinating little piece of Dark Age history, it actually appears that all</p>
<p>of these various tribes somehow coordinated a universal attack on Roman territory in the</p>
<p>year 367.</p>
<p>Again, the details are unclear, but in that year, invaders descended from all directions.</p>
<p>Picts and Scots from the north and Saxons and Franks from the east.</p>
<p>There was a period of looting and pillaging.</p>
<p>The Romans dispatched troops from the continent to take back control and impose law and order.</p>
<p>And the Romans repelled the invaders.</p>
<p>They rebuilt the damaged forts and repaired the damaged towns.</p>
<p>But perhaps it was just a big coincidence that all of those invaders descended at the</p>
<p>same time.</p>
<p>But Roman sources report a general belief that the attacks were somehow coordinated.</p>
<p>Remember that there were a lot of Germanic tribes in Britain as mercenaries, and many</p>
<p>of them had contact with the tribes back home.</p>
<p>So maybe they were able to coordinate their attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, the threat of barbarian invasions of Britain was only a small part of the overall</p>
<p>threat to the Roman Empire, as we&rsquo;ve seen in the past couple of episodes.</p>
<p>And as we know, the Romans had to deal with the Goths and the Franks and the Alemanni</p>
<p>and the Vandals and the other continental tribes around the same time.</p>
<p>And those threats were actually much closer to home for the Romans.</p>
<p>So in the first decade of the 5th century, the Romans began to withdraw more troops</p>
<p>from Britain to deal with the problems on the continent.</p>
<p>The Romans also stopped sending money to Britain to pay the mercenaries that remained there.</p>
<p>Now alarmed for their own safety and despairing for the lack of help and money from Rome,</p>
<p>the mercenaries in Britain rose in rebellion and appointed three successive leaders or</p>
<p>tyrants, as later historians called them.</p>
<p>The last of these three tyrants, calling himself Constantine III, took his troops to</p>
<p>Gaul where they were defeated and he was actually eventually executed.</p>
<p>But when these troops left for Gaul, there was a power vacuum in Roman Britain.</p>
<p>Around the year 408, the Saxons apparently became aware that the Roman army had vacated</p>
<p>Britain and they launched another major raid along the British coast.</p>
<p>Two years later, in the year 410, the Goths invaded and sacked Rome.</p>
<p>And as you may recall from the last episode, at the same time the Goths were invading Rome,</p>
<p>the Roman Britons were asking for help from Rome to deal with the increasing threats coming</p>
<p>at them from the south, the east, and the north.</p>
<p>And the Romans basically said, sorry, you&rsquo;re going to have to defend for yourselves.</p>
<p>And that effectively ended official Roman rule in Britain.</p>
<p>But some Roman troops still remained in Britain.</p>
<p>And in the next episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at what happened in the 5th century as they</p>
<p>tried to defend the island from invaders coming at them from all directions.</p>
<p>Of course, they ultimately failed and the Anglo-Saxons soon came to control the area</p>
<p>of Roman Britain.</p>
<p>But the details of that part of the story are still the subject of ongoing debates.</p>
<p>So that takes us to the year 410, when Britain effectively ceased to be part of the Roman</p>
<p>Empire.</p>
<p>And in the decades that followed, especially after the year 450, the Anglo-Saxon invasions</p>
<p>of Britain began in earnest.</p>
<p>In fact, most general histories of England tend to focus on the invasions which began</p>
<p>around the year 450 and continued for the next couple of centuries.</p>
<p>But in this episode, I wanted you to see that the arrival of the Germanic tribes was actually</p>
<p>much more gradual than that.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons didn&rsquo;t just wake up one day and decide, hey, let&rsquo;s all go to Britain.</p>
<p>It was actually a continuation of an ongoing process.</p>
<p>And once the Romans pulled out, that process was accelerated.</p>
<p>And when the Romans pulled out, that meant that writing went with them.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve established by now, the Germanic tribes were illiterate except for a few occasional</p>
<p>runic inscriptions.</p>
<p>For purposes of our story, that will become a problem as we move forward.</p>
<p>It basically means that we don&rsquo;t have any contemporary written accounts of what happened</p>
<p>for the first century or so after the Romans left.</p>
<p>But even after then, the accounts are very limited.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll try to piece together what happened as the Anglo-Saxons began to carve</p>
<p>out their own region in Britain, the region which will eventually become known as England,</p>
<p>with a language which will come to be known as English.</p>
<p>But for the rest of this episode, I want to explore what the languages of the North Sea</p>
<p>tribes sounded like when the first tribes began to settle in southern Britain.</p>
<p>These languages were not written down at the time.</p>
<p>But based on later versions of the languages that were written down, like Old English and</p>
<p>Old Saxon and Old Frisian, linguists have been able to compare the languages and determine</p>
<p>just how similar they were early on.</p>
<p>For example, all three languages had continued to simplify the Germanic system of inflections</p>
<p>on the ends of words.</p>
<p>As we know by now, the original Germanic language had lots of different word endings which we</p>
<p>call inflections.</p>
<p>And over time, English has gotten rid of most of those endings.</p>
<p>And that process actually began within this family of North Sea languages before Old English</p>
<p>emerged as a distinct language.</p>
<p>And we can see this process of simplifying the word endings in the way all of these North</p>
<p>Sea languages handled verb endings.</p>
<p>In English, when we have a verb, it stays the same in all of its plural forms.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the verb jump.</p>
<p>In first person plural, we have we jump.</p>
<p>In second person plural, we have you jump, or you all jump.</p>
<p>In third person plural, we have they jump.</p>
<p>But notice that the verb jump stays the same in all of these cases.</p>
<p>We jump, you jump, they jump.</p>
<p>We sing, you sing, they sing.</p>
<p>We study, you study, they study.</p>
<p>We think, you think, they think.</p>
<p>The verb doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>There are no specific endings to put on the end.</p>
<p>Well, this feature of English was also found in Old Saxon and Old Frisian.</p>
<p>But within other Germanic languages, the verbs varied in each of those plural forms.</p>
<p>So this indicates that the Angles, Saxons, and Frisians were not only using similar words,</p>
<p>they were also sharing a similar grammar.</p>
<p>The similarities between the languages of the Angles, Saxons, and Frisians can also</p>
<p>be seen in certain sound changes that happened very early on within all three languages,</p>
<p>and which were unique to those three languages.</p>
<p>For example, the three languages dropped the M or N sound in certain words, specifically</p>
<p>when the M or N sound appeared between a vowel on one side and an F sound or a TH sound or</p>
<p>an S sound on the other side.</p>
<p>In those cases, the M or N sound was dropped.</p>
<p>Again, this was a very specific change, and it happened within all three of these North</p>
<p>Sea languages.</p>
<p>So for example, the Old High German word for five was fienf, with an M sound in the middle.</p>
<p>The word was basically the same in Gothic.</p>
<p>But the word was fief in Old English and Old Saxon, without the M in the middle.</p>
<p>We can also see it in the word for us.</p>
<p>In Old High German, the word was unsa, with an N sound.</p>
<p>And the Gothic version was unsis, also with an N sound.</p>
<p>And you might remember from the Gothic version of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer that it began ata unsar,</p>
<p>which meant Father Our.</p>
<p>So in unsar for Our, we can also hear that N sound in Gothic.</p>
<p>Well, in Old English and Old Saxon, the word became us, without the N sound.</p>
<p>And of course, it later became us after the English vowel sound shifted around.</p>
<p>But again, we can hear in that example how the Early English, Saxon, and Frisian dialects</p>
<p>dropped that middle N or M sound.</p>
<p>We can also look at a word like goose.</p>
<p>For example, Modern German pronounces the word as gans.</p>
<p>In Dutch, it&rsquo;s hans.</p>
<p>Both have that N sound at the end.</p>
<p>But English has dropped it.</p>
<p>In English, it&rsquo;s goos.</p>
<p>And in Modern Frisian, it&rsquo;s goos.</p>
<p>So the word is almost identical in English and Frisian, and both have lost the N sound.</p>
<p>Well, we haven&rsquo;t completely lost the N sound.</p>
<p>We still do have a version of the word with the original N sound.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s gander, meaning a male goose.</p>
<p>As in, what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander.</p>
<p>That later version of the word retained the N sound, but the more generic English word</p>
<p>goose has lost it.</p>
<p>Now these sound changes may seem like technical points, but the reason they&rsquo;re important</p>
<p>is because they show us the similarity between Early English, Saxon, and Frisian.</p>
<p>These languages not only made many of the same changes to their respective grammars,</p>
<p>but they also made many of the same changes to their words.</p>
<p>The strong similarities between these old languages is still reflected in the modern</p>
<p>versions of the languages, Modern English and Modern Frisian.</p>
<p>In fact, many linguists place those two languages together in their own unique branch of the</p>
<p>West Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Now over time, the two languages have become more distinct.</p>
<p>English was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Norman French.</p>
<p>And Frisian was heavily influenced by Dutch.</p>
<p>And of course, all languages evolve over time on their own.</p>
<p>But despite these changes and outside influences, the two languages still have remarkable similarities.</p>
<p>For example, many Germanic languages have a G or K sound in many words.</p>
<p>These are sounds that are called valar consonants by linguists.</p>
<p>But it basically refers to consonants produced in the back of the mouth or throat region.</p>
<p>Well both English and Frisian have dropped those sounds in many words and replaced them</p>
<p>with a vowel sound like a or i.</p>
<p>So for example, take the English word day.</p>
<p>In German, it&rsquo;s tag.</p>
<p>In Dutch, it&rsquo;s dag.</p>
<p>By the way, as is always the case, my pronunciations are intended to be approximate, not necessarily</p>
<p>exact.</p>
<p>I just want to illustrate the point.</p>
<p>So both the German and Dutch versions of the word end with a valar consonant, that G or</p>
<p>K sound.</p>
<p>But in English, that consonant is gone, and it&rsquo;s been replaced with the a sound, day.</p>
<p>In Frisian, that consonant is also gone, and it&rsquo;s been replaced with an i sound, so the</p>
<p>word is die.</p>
<p>So whereas tag and dag sound foreign to us, day and die are much closer to each other,</p>
<p>and the Frisian version sounds more familiar to us.</p>
<p>We see the same relationship in the various words for rain.</p>
<p>In German, it&rsquo;s regen.</p>
<p>In Dutch, it&rsquo;s regen.</p>
<p>Both have two syllables with a valar consonant in the middle.</p>
<p>But in English, we have rain.</p>
<p>One syllable and no consonant in the middle.</p>
<p>And in Frisian, the word is rijn.</p>
<p>Again, one syllable and no consonant in the middle.</p>
<p>In some other words, the Germanic languages have retained a hard G sound where English</p>
<p>and Frisian have developed a Y sound.</p>
<p>So for example, the German word for yarn is garten.</p>
<p>But in English, it&rsquo;s yarn.</p>
<p>And the Frisian version is j√§rn.</p>
<p>So as we compare words, we can see that Frisian and English made a lot of the same sound changes</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>And there are many, many more examples of these common changes, but I just wanted to</p>
<p>give you a few examples here.</p>
<p>And as I noted back in episode 3, the modern similarities between English and Frisian are</p>
<p>so strong that we can read entire sentences the same way in both languages.</p>
<p>You might remember the saying, bread, butter, and green cheese is good English and good</p>
<p>Fris.</p>
<p>That phrase, remember, is read almost identically in English and Frisian.</p>
<p>And here are some more words that are very similar in both languages today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read the English word first, and then the Frisian equivalent.</p>
<p>So we have book and buik, is, is, in, in, ice, ish, out, out, ear, ear, hundred, hundred,</p>
<p>honey, hunig, salt, salt, good, gut, blood, blot, foot, foot, fish, fisk, young, young,</p>
<p>heart, hert.</p>
<p>So these are just a few examples.</p>
<p>We can also see that the Frisians still tend to use the en suffix to make words plural,</p>
<p>which Old English used to do much more prominently.</p>
<p>So we have one ox and several oxen, and we have one brother and several brethren.</p>
<p>Well, modern Frisian still tends to do this.</p>
<p>So one lion is a lyu, but several are a lyuan.</p>
<p>And one calf is a kiel, but several are a kielin.</p>
<p>Comparing English and Frisian also presents us with some interesting etymology.</p>
<p>Take the word sky in English.</p>
<p>The Frisian word is loft.</p>
<p>And in that word loft, we can see a connection to our modern English word loft.</p>
<p>In fact, both words are spelled exactly the same, we just have a different vowel pronunciation.</p>
<p>But loft once meant sky in Old English, just like it does in modern Frisian.</p>
<p>Over time, the meaning has changed to mean an upstairs room, like hayloft in a barn.</p>
<p>But we still have that original meaning when we speak of something being aloft.</p>
<p>Of course, the German word is also very similar, Luft, as in the World War II Air Force Luftwaffe</p>
<p>or Lufthansa Airlines.</p>
<p>By the way, we also get the word lift from the same Germanic root word, and of course</p>
<p>we lift something in the air toward the sky.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is the Frisian word for flower.</p>
<p>The Frisian word is bloem.</p>
<p>Again, if we listen closely, we can hear the connection to English.</p>
<p>Of course, we have essentially the same word, bloem, which means a flower blossom, or,</p>
<p>as a verb, the process of a flower blossoming.</p>
<p>But that word came into English thanks to the Vikings and their Old Norse language.</p>
<p>The original Old English version of the word was blossma, which gave us the word blossom.</p>
<p>So bloem and blossom are synonyms in modern English.</p>
<p>One word comes from Old English, blossom, and one word comes from Old Norse, bloom.</p>
<p>And both are very similar to the Frisian word for flower, bloem.</p>
<p>Let me also take this opportunity to mention a great blog if you&rsquo;re interested in comparing</p>
<p>English and Frisian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funwithfrisian.blogspot.com.</p>
<p>So in concluding my look at English and Frisian, the main point I wanted to make was that both</p>
<p>languages are very similar today, but they were even more similar in the distant past.</p>
<p>And during the time of the first Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain, the languages of the</p>
<p>Angles, Saxons, and Frisians were so close that they could settle in the same general</p>
<p>region and, over time, their languages could quickly meld together into a new, more-or-less</p>
<p>common language.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And next time, we&rsquo;re going to look at how these tribes became permanent residents of</p>
<p>Britain, not just raiders or temporary mercenaries.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll explore how they began to carve out their own regions and, in the process,</p>
<p>how they laid the foundation for many of the modern English dialects in Britain.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll also keep a close eye on the events which were taking place at the same time back</p>
<p>on the continent.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
