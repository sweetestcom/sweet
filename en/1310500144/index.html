    <p>The following is a conversation with Erik Brynjolfsson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an economics professor at Stanford</p>
<p>and the director of Stanford&rsquo;s Digital Economy Lab.</p>
<p>Previously, he was a long, long time professor at MIT</p>
<p>where he did groundbreaking work</p>
<p>on the economics of information.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of many books,</p>
<p>including The Second Machine Age</p>
<p>and Machine Platform Crowd,</p>
<p>coauthored with Andrew McAfee.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>Ventura Watches, the maker of classy,</p>
<p>well performing watches.</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN, the VPN I&rsquo;ve used for many years</p>
<p>to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>And CashApp, the app I use to send money to friends.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that the impact</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence and automation</p>
<p>on our economy and our world</p>
<p>is something worth thinking deeply about.</p>
<p>Like with many topics that are linked</p>
<p>to predicting the future evolution of technology,</p>
<p>it is often too easy to fall into one of two camps.</p>
<p>The fear mongering camp</p>
<p>or the technological utopianism camp.</p>
<p>As always, the future will land us somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I prefer to wear two hats in these discussions</p>
<p>and alternate between them often.</p>
<p>The hat of a pragmatic engineer</p>
<p>and the hat of a futurist.</p>
<p>This is probably a good time to mention Andrew Yang,</p>
<p>the presidential candidate who has been</p>
<p>one of the high profile thinkers on this topic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure I will speak with him</p>
<p>on this podcast eventually.</p>
<p>A conversation with Andrew has been on the table many times.</p>
<p>Our schedules just haven&rsquo;t aligned,</p>
<p>especially because I have a strongly held to preference</p>
<p>for long form, two, three, four hours or more,</p>
<p>and in person.</p>
<p>I work hard to not compromise on this.</p>
<p>Trust me, it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Even more so in the times of COVID,</p>
<p>which requires getting tested nonstop,</p>
<p>staying isolated and doing a lot of costly</p>
<p>and uncomfortable things that minimize risk for the guest.</p>
<p>The reason I do this is because to me,</p>
<p>something is lost in remote conversation.</p>
<p>That something, that magic,</p>
<p>I think is worth the effort,</p>
<p>even if it ultimately leads to a failed conversation.</p>
<p>This is how I approach life,</p>
<p>treasuring the possibility of a rare moment of magic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to go to the ends of the world</p>
<p>for just such a moment.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Erik Brynjolfsson.</p>
<p>You posted a quote on Twitter by Albert Bartlett</p>
<p>saying that the greatest shortcoming of the human race</p>
<p>is our inability to understand the exponential function.</p>
<p>Why would you say the exponential growth</p>
<p>is important to understand?</p>
<p>Yeah, that quote, I remember posting that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a reprise of something Andy McAfee and I said</p>
<p>in the second machine age,</p>
<p>but I posted it in early March</p>
<p>when COVID was really just beginning to take off</p>
<p>and I was really scared.</p>
<p>There were actually only a couple dozen cases,</p>
<p>maybe less at that time,</p>
<p>but they were doubling every like two or three days</p>
<p>and I could see, oh my God, this is gonna be a catastrophe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna happen soon,</p>
<p>but nobody was taking it very seriously</p>
<p>or not a lot of people were taking it very seriously.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember I did my last in person conference</p>
<p>that week, I was flying back from Las Vegas</p>
<p>and I was the only person on the plane wearing a mask</p>
<p>and the flight attendant came over to me.</p>
<p>She looked very concerned.</p>
<p>She kind of put her hands on my shoulder.</p>
<p>She was touching me all over, which I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled about</p>
<p>and she goes, do you have some kind of anxiety disorder?</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>And I was like, no, it&rsquo;s because of COVID.</p>
<p>This is early March.</p>
<p>Early March, but I was worried</p>
<p>because I knew I could see or I suspected, I guess,</p>
<p>that that doubling would continue and it did</p>
<p>and pretty soon we had thousands of times more cases.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I use that quote,</p>
<p>I try to, it&rsquo;s motivated by more optimistic things</p>
<p>like Moore&rsquo;s law and the wonders</p>
<p>of having more computer power,</p>
<p>but in either case, it can be very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>I mean, if you walk for 10 minutes,</p>
<p>you get about 10 times as far away</p>
<p>as if you walk for one minute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way our physical world works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way our brains are wired,</p>
<p>but if something doubles for 10 times as long,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get 10 times as much.</p>
<p>You get a thousand times as much</p>
<p>and after 20, it&rsquo;s a billion.</p>
<p>After 30, it&rsquo;s a, no, sorry, after 20, it&rsquo;s a million.</p>
<p>After 30, it&rsquo;s a billion.</p>
<p>And pretty soon after that,</p>
<p>it just gets to these numbers that you can barely grasp.</p>
<p>Our world is becoming more and more exponential,</p>
<p>mainly because of digital technologies.</p>
<p>So more and more often our intuitions are out of whack</p>
<p>and that can be good in the case of things creating wonders,</p>
<p>but it can be dangerous in the case of viruses</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>Do you think it generally applies,</p>
<p>like is there spaces where it does apply</p>
<p>and where it doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to build an intuition</p>
<p>about in which aspects of our society</p>
<p>does exponential growth apply?</p>
<p>Well, you can learn the math,</p>
<p>but the truth is our brains, I think,</p>
<p>tend to learn more from experiences.</p>
<p>So we just start seeing it more and more often.</p>
<p>So hanging around Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>hanging around AI and computer researchers,</p>
<p>I see this kind of exponential growth a lot more frequently</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting used to it, but I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>I still underestimate some of the progress</p>
<p>in just talking to someone about GPT3</p>
<p>and how rapidly natural language has improved.</p>
<p>But I think that as the world becomes more exponential,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll all start experiencing it more frequently.</p>
<p>The danger is that we may make some mistakes in the meantime</p>
<p>using our old kind of caveman intuitions</p>
<p>about how the world works.</p>
<p>Well, the weird thing is it always kind of looks linear</p>
<p>in the moment.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s hard to feel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to like introspect</p>
<p>and really acknowledge how much has changed</p>
<p>in just a couple of years or five years or 10 years</p>
<p>with the internet.</p>
<p>If we just look at advancements of AI</p>
<p>or even just social media,</p>
<p>all the various technologies</p>
<p>that go into the digital umbrella,</p>
<p>it feels pretty calm and normal and gradual.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of stuff,</p>
<p>I think there are parts of the world,</p>
<p>most of the world that is not exponential.</p>
<p>The way humans learn,</p>
<p>the way organizations change,</p>
<p>the way our whole institutions adapt and evolve,</p>
<p>those don&rsquo;t improve at exponential paces.</p>
<p>And that leads to a mismatch oftentimes</p>
<p>between these exponentially improving technologies</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say changing technologies</p>
<p>because some of them are exponentially more dangerous</p>
<p>and our intuitions and our human skills</p>
<p>and our institutions that just don&rsquo;t change very fast at all.</p>
<p>And that mismatch I think is at the root</p>
<p>of a lot of the problems in our society,</p>
<p>the growing inequality</p>
<p>and other dysfunctions in our political</p>
<p>and economic systems.</p>
<p>So one guy that talks about exponential functions</p>
<p>a lot is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He seems to internalize this kind of way</p>
<p>of exponential thinking.</p>
<p>He calls it first principles thinking,</p>
<p>sort of the kind of going to the basics,</p>
<p>asking the question,</p>
<p>like what were the assumptions of the past?</p>
<p>How can we throw them out the window?</p>
<p>How can we do this 10X much more efficiently</p>
<p>and constantly practicing that process?</p>
<p>And also using that kind of thinking</p>
<p>to estimate sort of when, you know, create deadlines</p>
<p>and estimate when you&rsquo;ll be able to deliver</p>
<p>on some of these technologies.</p>
<p>Now, it often gets him in trouble</p>
<p>because he overestimates,</p>
<p>like he doesn&rsquo;t meet the initial estimates of the deadlines,</p>
<p>but he seems to deliver late but deliver.</p>
<p>And which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Like, what are your thoughts about this whole thing?</p>
<p>I think we can all learn from Elon.</p>
<p>I think going to first principles,</p>
<p>I talked about two ways of getting more of a grip</p>
<p>on the exponential function.</p>
<p>And one of them just comes from first principles.</p>
<p>You know, if you understand the math of it,</p>
<p>you can see what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And even if it seems counterintuitive</p>
<p>that a couple of dozen of COVID cases</p>
<p>can become thousands or tens or hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of them in a month,</p>
<p>it makes sense once you just do the math.</p>
<p>And I think Elon tries to do that a lot.</p>
<p>You know, in fairness, I think he also benefits</p>
<p>from hanging out in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s experienced it in a lot of different applications.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not as much of a shock to him anymore,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s something we can all learn from.</p>
<p>In my own life, I remember one of my first experiences</p>
<p>really seeing it was when I was a grad student</p>
<p>and my advisor asked me to plot the growth of computer power</p>
<p>in the US economy in different industries.</p>
<p>And there are all these, you know,</p>
<p>exponentially growing curves.</p>
<p>And I was like, holy shit, look at this.</p>
<p>In each industry, it was just taking off.</p>
<p>And, you know, you didn&rsquo;t have to be a rocket scientist</p>
<p>to extend that and say, wow,</p>
<p>this means that this was in the late 80s and early 90s</p>
<p>that, you know, if it goes anything like that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have orders of magnitude more computer power</p>
<p>than we did at that time.</p>
<p>And of course we do.</p>
<p>So, you know, when people look at Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>they often talk about it as just,</p>
<p>so the exponential function is actually</p>
<p>a stack of S curves.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s you milk or whatever,</p>
<p>take the most advantage of a particular little revolution</p>
<p>and then you search for another revolution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically revolutions stack on top of revolutions.</p>
<p>Do you have any intuition about how the head humans</p>
<p>keep finding ways to revolutionize things?</p>
<p>Well, first, let me just unpack that first point</p>
<p>that I talked about exponential curves,</p>
<p>but no exponential curve continues forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said that if anything can&rsquo;t go on forever,</p>
<p>eventually it will stop.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s very profound, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it seems that a lot of people don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>that half of it as well either.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why all exponential functions eventually turn</p>
<p>into some kind of S curve or stop in some other way,</p>
<p>maybe catastrophically.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a cap with COVID as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, it went up and then it sort of, you know,</p>
<p>at some point it starts saturating the pool of people</p>
<p>to be infected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a standard epidemiological model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beginning to happen with Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>or different generations of computer power.</p>
<p>It happens with all exponential curves.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing is you elude,</p>
<p>the second part of your question is that we&rsquo;ve been able</p>
<p>to come up with a new S curve on top of the previous one</p>
<p>and do that generation after generation with new materials,</p>
<p>new processes, and just extend it further and further.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone has a really good theory</p>
<p>about why we&rsquo;ve been so successful in doing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that we have been,</p>
<p>and I hope it continues for some time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, one beginning of a theory</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s huge incentives when other parts</p>
<p>of the system are going on that clock speed</p>
<p>of doubling every two to three years.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one component of it that&rsquo;s not keeping up,</p>
<p>then the economic incentives become really large</p>
<p>to improve that one part.</p>
<p>It becomes a bottleneck and anyone who can do improvements</p>
<p>in that part can reap huge returns</p>
<p>so that the resources automatically get focused</p>
<p>on whatever part of the system isn&rsquo;t keeping up.</p>
<p>Do you think some version of the Moore&rsquo;s law will continue?</p>
<p>Some version, yes, it is.</p>
<p>I mean, one version that has become more important</p>
<p>is something I call Coomey&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>which is named after John Coomey,</p>
<p>who I should mention was also my college roommate,</p>
<p>but he identified the fact that energy consumption</p>
<p>has been declining by a factor of two.</p>
<p>And for most of us, that&rsquo;s more important.</p>
<p>The new iPhones came out today as we&rsquo;re recording this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when you&rsquo;re gonna make it available.</p>
<p>Very soon after this, yeah.</p>
<p>And for most of us, having the iPhone be twice as fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice, but having the battery lifelonger,</p>
<p>that would be much more valuable.</p>
<p>And the fact that a lot of the progress in chips now</p>
<p>is reducing energy consumption is probably more important</p>
<p>for many applications than just the raw speed.</p>
<p>Other dimensions of Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>are in AI and machine learning.</p>
<p>Those tend to be very parallelizable functions,</p>
<p>especially deep neural nets.</p>
<p>And so instead of having one chip,</p>
<p>you can have multiple chips or you can have a GPU,</p>
<p>graphic processing unit that goes faster.</p>
<p>Now, special chips designed for machine learning</p>
<p>like tensor processing units,</p>
<p>each time you switch, there&rsquo;s another 10X</p>
<p>or 100X improvement above and beyond Moore&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>So I think that the raw silicon</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t improving as much as it used to,</p>
<p>but these other dimensions are becoming important,</p>
<p>more important, and we&rsquo;re seeing progress in them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the work by OpenAI</p>
<p>where they show the exponential improvement</p>
<p>of the training of neural networks</p>
<p>just literally in the techniques used.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s almost like the algorithm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think like, can I actually continue?</p>
<p>I was figuring out more and more tricks</p>
<p>on how to train networks faster and faster.</p>
<p>The progress has been staggering.</p>
<p>If you look at image recognition, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a function of at least three things</p>
<p>that are coming together.</p>
<p>One, we just talked about faster chips,</p>
<p>not just Moore&rsquo;s law, but GPUs, TPUs and other technologies.</p>
<p>The second is just a lot more data.</p>
<p>I mean, we are awash in digital data today</p>
<p>in a way we weren&rsquo;t 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Photography, I&rsquo;m old enough to remember,</p>
<p>it used to be chemical, and now everything is digital.</p>
<p>I took probably 50 digital photos yesterday.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that if it was chemical.</p>
<p>And we have the internet of things</p>
<p>and all sorts of other types of data.</p>
<p>When we walk around with our phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just broadcasting a huge amounts of digital data</p>
<p>that can be used as training sets.</p>
<p>And then last but not least, as they mentioned at OpenAI,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been significant improvements in the techniques.</p>
<p>The core idea of deep neural nets</p>
<p>has been around for a few decades,</p>
<p>but the advances in making it work more efficiently</p>
<p>have also improved a couple of orders of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>So you multiply together,</p>
<p>a hundred fold improvement in computer power,</p>
<p>a hundred fold or more improvement in data,</p>
<p>a hundred fold improvement in techniques</p>
<p>of software and algorithms,</p>
<p>and soon you&rsquo;re getting into a million fold improvements.</p>
<p>So somebody brought this up, this idea with GPT3 that,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s trained in a self supervised way</p>
<p>on basically internet data.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the, I&rsquo;ve seen arguments made</p>
<p>and they seem to be pretty convincing</p>
<p>that the bottleneck there is going to be</p>
<p>how much data there is on the internet,</p>
<p>which is a fascinating idea that it literally</p>
<p>will just run out of human generated data to train on.</p>
<p>Right, I know we make it to the point where it&rsquo;s consumed</p>
<p>basically all of human knowledge</p>
<p>or all digitized human knowledge, yeah.</p>
<p>And that will be the bottleneck.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing with bottlenecks</p>
<p>is people often use bottlenecks</p>
<p>as a way to argue against exponential growth.</p>
<p>They say, well, there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you can overcome this bottleneck,</p>
<p>but we seem to somehow keep coming up in new ways</p>
<p>to like overcome whatever bottlenecks</p>
<p>the critics come up with, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you overcome the data bottleneck,</p>
<p>but probably more efficient training algorithms.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you already mentioned that,</p>
<p>that these training algorithms are getting much better</p>
<p>at using smaller amounts of data.</p>
<p>We also are just capturing a lot more data than we used to,</p>
<p>especially in China, but all around us.</p>
<p>So those are both important.</p>
<p>In some applications, you can simulate the data,</p>
<p>video games, some of the self driving car systems</p>
<p>are simulating driving, and of course,</p>
<p>that has some risks and weaknesses,</p>
<p>but you can also, if you want to exhaust</p>
<p>all the different ways you could beat a video game,</p>
<p>you could just simulate all the options.</p>
<p>Can we take a step in that direction of autonomous vehicles?</p>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;re talking to the CTO of Waymo tomorrow.</p>
<p>And obviously, I&rsquo;m talking to Elon again in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on autonomous vehicles?</p>
<p>Like where do we stand as a problem</p>
<p>that has the potential of revolutionizing the world?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m really excited about that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s become much clearer</p>
<p>that the original way that I thought about it,</p>
<p>most people thought about like,</p>
<p>you know, will we have a self driving car or not</p>
<p>is way too simple.</p>
<p>The better way to think about it</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a whole continuum</p>
<p>of how much driving and assisting the car can do.</p>
<p>I noticed that you&rsquo;re right next door</p>
<p>to the Toyota Research Institute.</p>
<p>That is a total accident.</p>
<p>I love the TRI folks, but yeah.</p>
<p>Have you talked to Gil Pratt?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re supposed to talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of the,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good counterpart to say what Elon is doing.</p>
<p>And hopefully they can be frank</p>
<p>in what they think about each other,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve heard both of them talk about it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re much more, you know,</p>
<p>this is an assistive, a guardian angel</p>
<p>that watches over you as opposed to try to do everything.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some things like driving on a highway,</p>
<p>you know, from LA to Phoenix,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s mostly good weather, straight roads.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s close to a solved problem, let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>In other situations, you know,</p>
<p>driving through the snow in Boston</p>
<p>where the roads are kind of crazy.</p>
<p>And most importantly, you have to make a lot of judgments</p>
<p>about what the other driver is gonna do</p>
<p>at these intersections that aren&rsquo;t really right angles</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t very well described.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like game theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much harder problem</p>
<p>and requires understanding human motivations.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a continuum there of some places</p>
<p>where the cars will work very well</p>
<p>and others where it could probably take decades.</p>
<p>What do you think about the Waymo?</p>
<p>So you mentioned two companies</p>
<p>that actually have cars on the road.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Waymo approach that it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to release anything until it&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna be very strict</p>
<p>about the streets that we travel on,</p>
<p>but it better be perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m smart enough to be humble</p>
<p>and not try to get between.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s very bright people</p>
<p>on both sides of the argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to them and they make convincing arguments to me</p>
<p>about how careful they need to be and the social acceptance.</p>
<p>Some people thought that when the first few people died</p>
<p>from self driving cars, that would shut down the industry,</p>
<p>but it was more of a blip actually.</p>
<p>And, you know, so that was interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s still a concern</p>
<p>that if there could be setbacks, if we do this wrong,</p>
<p>you know, your listeners may be familiar</p>
<p>with the different levels of self driving,</p>
<p>you know, level one, two, three, four, five.</p>
<p>I think Andrew Ng has convinced me that this idea</p>
<p>of really focusing on level four,</p>
<p>where you only go in areas that are well mapped</p>
<p>rather than just going out in the wild</p>
<p>is the way things are gonna evolve.</p>
<p>But you can just keep expanding those areas</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve mapped things really well,</p>
<p>where you really understand them</p>
<p>and eventually all become kind of interconnected.</p>
<p>And that could be a kind of another way of progressing</p>
<p>to make it more feasible over time.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of like the Waymo approach,</p>
<p>which is they just now released,</p>
<p>I think just like a day or two ago,</p>
<p>a public, like anyone from the public</p>
<p>in the Phoenix, Arizona to, you know,</p>
<p>you can get a ride in a Waymo car</p>
<p>with no person, no driver.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ve taken away the safety driver?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for a while now there&rsquo;s been no safety driver.</p>
<p>Okay, because I mean, I&rsquo;ve been following that one</p>
<p>in particular, but I thought it was kind of funny</p>
<p>about a year ago when they had the safety driver</p>
<p>and then they added a second safety driver</p>
<p>because the first safety driver would fall asleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>in the right direction with that.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ve Waymo in particular</p>
<p>done a really good job of that.</p>
<p>They actually have a very interesting infrastructure</p>
<p>of remote like observation.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not controlling the vehicles remotely,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re able to, it&rsquo;s like a customer service.</p>
<p>They can anytime tune into the car.</p>
<p>I bet they can probably remotely control it as well,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s officially not the function that they use.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that being really,</p>
<p>because I think the thing that&rsquo;s proven harder</p>
<p>than maybe some of the early people expected</p>
<p>was there&rsquo;s a long tail of weird exceptions.</p>
<p>So you can deal with 90, 99, 99.99% of the cases,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s something that just never been seen before</p>
<p>in the training data.</p>
<p>And humans more or less can work around that.</p>
<p>Although let me be clear and note,</p>
<p>there are about 30,000 human fatalities</p>
<p>just in the United States and maybe a million worldwide.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re far from perfect.</p>
<p>But I think people have higher expectations of machines.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate that level of death</p>
<p>and damage from a machine.</p>
<p>And so we have to do a lot better</p>
<p>at dealing with those edge cases.</p>
<p>And also the tricky thing that if I have a criticism</p>
<p>for the Waymo folks, there&rsquo;s such a huge focus on safety</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t talk enough about creating products</p>
<p>that people, that customers love,</p>
<p>that human beings love using.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to create a thing that&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>at the extremes, but then nobody wants to get into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, back to Elon, I think one of,</p>
<p>part of his genius was with the electric cars.</p>
<p>Before he came along, electric cars were all kind of</p>
<p>underpowered, really light,</p>
<p>and there were sort of wimpy cars that weren&rsquo;t fun.</p>
<p>And the first thing he did was he made a roadster</p>
<p>that went zero to 60 faster than just about any other car</p>
<p>and went the other end.</p>
<p>And I think that was a really wise marketing move</p>
<p>as well as a wise technology move.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out</p>
<p>what the right marketing move is for AI systems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been, I think it requires guts and risk taking</p>
<p>which is what Elon practices.</p>
<p>I mean, to the chagrin of perhaps investors or whatever,</p>
<p>but it also requires rethinking what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think way too many people are unimaginative,</p>
<p>intellectually lazy, and when they take AI,</p>
<p>they basically say, what are we doing now?</p>
<p>How can we make a machine do the same thing?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll save some costs, we&rsquo;ll have less labor.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the worst thing</p>
<p>in the world to do, but it&rsquo;s really not leading</p>
<p>to a quantum change in the way you do things.</p>
<p>When Jeff Bezos said, hey, we&rsquo;re gonna use the internet</p>
<p>to change how bookstores work and we&rsquo;re gonna use technology,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t go and say, okay, let&rsquo;s put a robot cashier</p>
<p>where the human cashier is and leave everything else alone.</p>
<p>That would have been a very lame way to automate a bookstore.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like went from soup to nuts and let&rsquo;s just rethink it.</p>
<p>We get rid of the physical bookstore.</p>
<p>We have a warehouse, we have delivery,</p>
<p>we have people order on a screen</p>
<p>and everything was reinvented.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been the story</p>
<p>of these general purpose technologies all through history.</p>
<p>And in my books, I write about like electricity</p>
<p>and how for 30 years, there was almost no productivity gain</p>
<p>from the electrification of factories a century ago.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not because electricity</p>
<p>is a wimpy useless technology.</p>
<p>We all know how awesome electricity is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cause at first,</p>
<p>they really didn&rsquo;t rethink the factories.</p>
<p>It was only after they reinvented them</p>
<p>and we describe how in the book,</p>
<p>then you suddenly got a doubling and tripling</p>
<p>of productivity growth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the combination of the technology</p>
<p>with the new business models, new business organization.</p>
<p>That just takes a long time</p>
<p>and it takes more creativity than most people have.</p>
<p>Can you maybe linger on electricity?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s a fun one.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, sure, I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened.</p>
<p>Before electricity, there were basically steam engines</p>
<p>or sometimes water wheels and to power the machinery,</p>
<p>you had to have pulleys and crankshafts</p>
<p>and you really can&rsquo;t make them too long</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;ll break the torsion.</p>
<p>So all the equipment was kind of clustered</p>
<p>around this one giant steam engine.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make small steam engines either</p>
<p>cause of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>So you have one giant steam engine,</p>
<p>all the equipment clustered around it, multi story.</p>
<p>They have it vertical to minimize the distance</p>
<p>as well as horizontal.</p>
<p>And then when they did electricity,</p>
<p>they took out the steam engine.</p>
<p>They got the biggest electric motor</p>
<p>they could buy from General Electric or someone like that.</p>
<p>And nothing much else changed.</p>
<p>It took until a generation of managers retired</p>
<p>or died three years later,</p>
<p>that people started thinking,</p>
<p>wait, we don&rsquo;t have to do it that way.</p>
<p>You can make electric motors, big, small, medium.</p>
<p>You can put one with each piece of equipment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this big debate</p>
<p>if you read the management literature</p>
<p>between what they call a group drive versus unit drive</p>
<p>where every machine would have its own motor.</p>
<p>Well, once they did that, once they went to unit drive,</p>
<p>those guys won the debate.</p>
<p>Then you started having a new kind of factory</p>
<p>which is sometimes spread out over acres, single story</p>
<p>and each piece of equipment has its own motor.</p>
<p>And most importantly, they weren&rsquo;t laid out based on</p>
<p>who needed the most power.</p>
<p>They were laid out based on</p>
<p>what is the workflow of materials?</p>
<p>Assembly line, let&rsquo;s have it go from this machine</p>
<p>to that machine, to that machine.</p>
<p>Once they rethought the factory that way,</p>
<p>huge increases in productivity.</p>
<p>It was just staggering.</p>
<p>People like Paul David have documented this</p>
<p>in their research papers.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a lesson you see over and over.</p>
<p>It happened when the steam engine changed manual production.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened with the computerization.</p>
<p>People like Michael Hammer said, don&rsquo;t automate, obliterate.</p>
<p>In each case, the big gains only came once</p>
<p>smart entrepreneurs and managers</p>
<p>basically reinvented their industries.</p>
<p>I mean, one other interesting point about all that</p>
<p>is that during that reinvention period,</p>
<p>you often actually not only don&rsquo;t see productivity growth,</p>
<p>you can actually see a slipping back.</p>
<p>Measured productivity actually falls.</p>
<p>I just wrote a paper with Chad Severson and Daniel Rock</p>
<p>called the productivity J curve,</p>
<p>which basically shows that in a lot of these cases,</p>
<p>you have a downward dip before it goes up.</p>
<p>And that downward dip is when everyone&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to like reinvent things.</p>
<p>And you could say that they&rsquo;re creating knowledge</p>
<p>and intangible assets,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t show up on anyone&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t show up in GDP.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re doing nothing.</p>
<p>Like take self driving cars, we were just talking about it.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of billions of dollars</p>
<p>spent developing self driving cars.</p>
<p>And basically no chauffeur has lost his job, no taxi driver.</p>
<p>I guess I got to check out the ones that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big J curve.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a bunch of spending</p>
<p>and no real consumer benefit.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re doing that in the belief,</p>
<p>I think the justified belief</p>
<p>that they will get the upward part of the J curve</p>
<p>and there will be some big returns,</p>
<p>but in the short run, you&rsquo;re not seeing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happening with a lot of other AI technologies,</p>
<p>just as it happened</p>
<p>with earlier general purpose technologies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having relatively low productivity growth lately.</p>
<p>As an economist, one of the things that disappoints me</p>
<p>is that as eye popping as these technologies are,</p>
<p>you and I are both excited</p>
<p>about some of the things they can do.</p>
<p>The economic productivity statistics are kind of dismal.</p>
<p>We actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>have had lower productivity growth</p>
<p>in the past about 15 years</p>
<p>than we did in the previous 15 years,</p>
<p>in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not what you would have expected</p>
<p>if these technologies were that much better.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re in kind of a long J curve there.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start seeing the upward tick,</p>
<p>maybe as soon as next year.</p>
<p>But the past decade has been a bit disappointing</p>
<p>if you thought there&rsquo;s a one to one relationship</p>
<p>between cool technology and higher productivity.</p>
<p>Well, what would you place your biggest hope</p>
<p>for productivity increases on?</p>
<p>Because you kind of said at a high level AI,</p>
<p>but if I were to think about</p>
<p>what has been so revolutionary in the last 10 years,</p>
<p>I would 15 years and thinking about the internet,</p>
<p>I would say things like,</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;m not saying anything ridiculous,</p>
<p>but everything from Wikipedia to Twitter.</p>
<p>So like these kind of websites,</p>
<p>not so much AI,</p>
<p>but like I would expect to see some kind</p>
<p>of big productivity increases</p>
<p>from just the connectivity between people</p>
<p>and the access to more information.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so that&rsquo;s another area</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of research on actually,</p>
<p>is these free goods like Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Zoom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually doing this in person,</p>
<p>but almost everything else I do these days is online.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about all those</p>
<p>is most of them have a price of zero.</p>
<p>What do you pay for Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Maybe like a little bit for the electrons</p>
<p>to come to your house.</p>
<p>Basically zero, right?</p>
<p>Take a small pause and say, I donate to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Often you should too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for you, yeah.</p>
<p>So, but what does that do mean for GDP?</p>
<p>GDP is based on the price and quantity</p>
<p>of all the goods, things bought and sold.</p>
<p>If something has zero price,</p>
<p>you know how much it contributes to GDP?</p>
<p>To a first approximation, zero.</p>
<p>So these digital goods that we&rsquo;re getting more and more of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re spending more and more hours a day</p>
<p>consuming stuff off of screens,</p>
<p>little screens, big screens,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get priced into GDP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t create value.</p>
<p>I get a lot of value from watching cat videos</p>
<p>and reading Wikipedia articles and listening to podcasts,</p>
<p>even if I don&rsquo;t pay for them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a mismatch there.</p>
<p>Now, in fairness, economists,</p>
<p>since Simon Kuznets invented GDP and productivity,</p>
<p>all those statistics back in the 1930s,</p>
<p>he recognized, he in fact said,</p>
<p>this is not a measure of wellbeing.</p>
<p>This is not a measure of welfare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a measure of production.</p>
<p>But almost everybody has kind of forgotten</p>
<p>that he said that and they just use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how well off are we?</p>
<p>What was GDP last year?</p>
<p>It was 2.3% growth or whatever.</p>
<p>That is how much physical production,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the value we&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>We need a new set of statistics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m working with some colleagues.</p>
<p>Avi Collis and others to develop something</p>
<p>we call GDP dash B.</p>
<p>GDP B measures the benefits you get, not the cost.</p>
<p>If you get benefit from Zoom or Wikipedia or Facebook,</p>
<p>then that gets counted in GDP B,</p>
<p>even if you pay zero for it.</p>
<p>So, you know, back to your original point,</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of gain over the past decade</p>
<p>in these digital goods that doesn&rsquo;t show up in GDP,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t show up in productivity.</p>
<p>By the way, productivity is just defined</p>
<p>as GDP divided by hours worked.</p>
<p>So if you mismeasure GDP,</p>
<p>you mismeasure productivity by the exact same amount.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something we need to fix.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with the statistical agencies</p>
<p>to come up with a new set of metrics.</p>
<p>And, you know, over the coming years,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;re not gonna do away with GDP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very useful, but we&rsquo;ll see a parallel set of accounts</p>
<p>that measure the benefits.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to get that B in the GDP B?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the reasons it hasn&rsquo;t been done before</p>
<p>is that, you know, you can measure it,</p>
<p>the cash register, what people pay for stuff,</p>
<p>but how do you measure what they would have paid,</p>
<p>like what the value is?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot harder, you know?</p>
<p>How much is Wikipedia worth to you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have to answer.</p>
<p>And to do that, what we do is we can use online experiments.</p>
<p>We do massive online choice experiments.</p>
<p>We ask hundreds of thousands, now millions of people</p>
<p>to do lots of sort of A, B tests.</p>
<p>How much would I have to pay you</p>
<p>to give up Wikipedia for a month?</p>
<p>How much would I have to pay you to stop using your phone?</p>
<p>And in some cases, it&rsquo;s hypothetical.</p>
<p>In other cases, we actually enforce it,</p>
<p>which is kind of expensive.</p>
<p>Like we pay somebody $30 to stop using Facebook</p>
<p>and we see if they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And some people will give it up for $10.</p>
<p>Some people won&rsquo;t give it up even if you give them $100.</p>
<p>And then you get a whole demand curve.</p>
<p>You get to see what all the different prices are</p>
<p>and how much value different people get.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly,</p>
<p>different people have different values.</p>
<p>We find that women tend to value Facebook more than men.</p>
<p>Old people tend to value it a little bit more</p>
<p>than young people.</p>
<p>That was interesting.</p>
<p>I think young people maybe know about other networks</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know the name of that are better than Facebook.</p>
<p>And so you get to see these patterns,</p>
<p>but every person&rsquo;s individual.</p>
<p>And then if you add up all those numbers,</p>
<p>you start getting an estimate of the value.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Is this a work that will soon eventually be published?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s a version of it</p>
<p>in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>about I think we call it massive online choice experiments.</p>
<p>I should remember the title, but it&rsquo;s on my website.</p>
<p>So yeah, we have some more papers coming out on it,</p>
<p>but the first one is already out.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of a fascinating mystery</p>
<p>that Twitter, Facebook,</p>
<p>like all these social networks are free.</p>
<p>And it seems like almost none of them except for YouTube</p>
<p>have experimented with removing ads for money.</p>
<p>Can you like, do you understand that</p>
<p>from both economics and the product perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s something that, you know,</p>
<p>so I teach a course on digital business models.</p>
<p>So I used to at MIT, at Stanford, I&rsquo;m not quite sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not teaching until next spring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking what my course is gonna be.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of different business models.</p>
<p>And when you have something that has zero marginal cost,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of forces,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s any kind of competition</p>
<p>that push prices down to zero.</p>
<p>But you can have ad supported systems,</p>
<p>you can bundle things together.</p>
<p>You can have volunteer, you mentioned Wikipedia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s donations.</p>
<p>And I think economists underestimate</p>
<p>the power of volunteerism and donations.</p>
<p>Your national public radio.</p>
<p>Actually, how do you, this podcast, how is this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the revenue model?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sponsors at the beginning.</p>
<p>And then, and people, the funny thing is,</p>
<p>I tell people they can, it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>I tell them the timestamp.</p>
<p>So if you wanna skip the sponsors, you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that a bunch of people,</p>
<p>so I read the advertisement</p>
<p>and then a bunch of people enjoy reading it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, they may learn something from it.</p>
<p>And also from the advertiser&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>those are people who are actually interested.</p>
<p>I mean, the example I sometimes get is like,</p>
<p>I bought a car recently and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>all the car ads were like interesting to me.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then like, now that I have the car,</p>
<p>like I sort of zone out on, but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The car companies, they don&rsquo;t really wanna be advertising</p>
<p>to me if I&rsquo;m not gonna buy their product.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of these different revenue models</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little complicated,</p>
<p>but the economic theory has to do</p>
<p>with what the shape of the demand curve is,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s better to monetize it with charging people</p>
<p>versus when you&rsquo;re better off doing advertising.</p>
<p>I mean, in short, when the demand curve</p>
<p>is relatively flat and wide,</p>
<p>like generic news and things like that,</p>
<p>then you tend to do better with advertising.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a good that&rsquo;s only useful to a small number</p>
<p>of people, but they&rsquo;re willing to pay a lot,</p>
<p>they have a very high value for it,</p>
<p>then advertising isn&rsquo;t gonna work as well</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re better off charging for it.</p>
<p>Both of them have some inefficiencies.</p>
<p>And then when you get into targeting</p>
<p>and you get into these other revenue models,</p>
<p>it gets more complicated,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some economic theory on it.</p>
<p>I also think to be frank,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of experimentation that&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>because sometimes things are a little counterintuitive,</p>
<p>especially when you get into what are called</p>
<p>two sided networks or platform effects,</p>
<p>where you may grow the market on one side</p>
<p>and harvest the revenue on the other side.</p>
<p>Facebook tries to get more and more users</p>
<p>and then they harvest the revenue from advertising.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way of kind of thinking about it.</p>
<p>Is it strange to you that they haven&rsquo;t experimented?</p>
<p>Well, they are experimenting.</p>
<p>So they are doing some experiments</p>
<p>about what the willingness is for people to pay.</p>
<p>I think that when they do the math,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna work out that they still are better off</p>
<p>with an advertising driven model, but&hellip;</p>
<p>What about a mix?</p>
<p>Like this is what YouTube is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you allow the person to decide,</p>
<p>the customer to decide exactly which model they prefer.</p>
<p>No, that can work really well.</p>
<p>And newspapers, of course,</p>
<p>have known this for a long time.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times,</p>
<p>they have subscription revenue.</p>
<p>They also have advertising revenue.</p>
<p>And that can definitely work.</p>
<p>Online, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to have a dial</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more personalized</p>
<p>and everybody can kind of roll their own mix.</p>
<p>And I could imagine having a little slider</p>
<p>about how much advertising you want or are willing to take.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s done right and it&rsquo;s incentive compatible,</p>
<p>it could be a win win where both the content provider</p>
<p>and the consumer are better off</p>
<p>than they would have been before.</p>
<p>Yeah, the done right part is a really good point.</p>
<p>Like with the Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>and the single click purchase on Amazon,</p>
<p>the frictionless effort there,</p>
<p>if I could just rant for a second</p>
<p>about the Wall Street Journal,</p>
<p>all the newspapers you mentioned,</p>
<p>is I have to click so many times to subscribe to them</p>
<p>that I literally don&rsquo;t subscribe</p>
<p>just because of the number of times I have to click.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why so many companies make it so hard.</p>
<p>I mean, another example is when you buy a new iPhone</p>
<p>or a new computer, whatever,</p>
<p>I feel like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna lose an afternoon</p>
<p>just like loading up and getting all my stuff back.</p>
<p>And for a lot of us,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more of a deterrent than the price.</p>
<p>And if they could make it painless,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d give them a lot more money.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping somebody listening is working</p>
<p>on making it more painless for us to buy your products.</p>
<p>If we could just like linger a little bit</p>
<p>on the social network thing,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this Netflix social dilemma.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I saw that.</p>
<p>And Tristan Harris and company, yeah.</p>
<p>And people&rsquo;s data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really sensitive and social networks</p>
<p>are at the core arguably of many of societal like tension</p>
<p>and some of the most important things happening in society.</p>
<p>So it feels like it&rsquo;s important to get this right,</p>
<p>both from a business model perspective</p>
<p>and just like a trust perspective.</p>
<p>I still gotta, I mean, it just still feels like,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s experimentation going on.</p>
<p>It still feels like everyone is afraid</p>
<p>to try different business models, like really try.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m worried that people are afraid</p>
<p>to try different business models.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also worried that some of the business models</p>
<p>may lead them to bad choices.</p>
<p>And Danny Kahneman talks about system one and system two,</p>
<p>sort of like a reptilian brain</p>
<p>that reacts quickly to what we see,</p>
<p>see something interesting, we click on it,</p>
<p>we retweet it versus our system two,</p>
<p>our frontal cortex that&rsquo;s supposed to be more careful</p>
<p>and rational that really doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>as many decisions as it should.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a tendency for a lot of these social networks</p>
<p>to really exploit system one, our quick instant reaction,</p>
<p>make it so we just click on stuff and pass it on</p>
<p>and not really think carefully about it.</p>
<p>And that system, it tends to be driven</p>
<p>by sex, violence, disgust, anger, fear,</p>
<p>these relatively primitive kinds of emotions.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re important for a lot of purposes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not a great way to organize a society.</p>
<p>And most importantly, when you think about this huge,</p>
<p>amazing information infrastructure we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected billions of brains across the globe,</p>
<p>not just so we can all access information,</p>
<p>but we can all contribute to it and share it.</p>
<p>Arguably the most important thing</p>
<p>that that network should do is favor truth over falsehoods.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s been designed,</p>
<p>not necessarily intentionally, is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>My MIT colleagues are all, and Deb Roy and others at MIT,</p>
<p>did a terrific paper in the cover of Science.</p>
<p>And they documented what we all feared,</p>
<p>which is that lies spread faster than truth</p>
<p>on social networks.</p>
<p>They looked at a bunch of tweets and retweets,</p>
<p>and they found that false information</p>
<p>was more likely to spread further, faster, to more people.</p>
<p>And why was that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because people like lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because people like things that are shocking,</p>
<p>amazing, can you believe this?</p>
<p>Something that is not mundane,</p>
<p>not something that everybody else already knew.</p>
<p>And what are the most unbelievable things?</p>
<p>Well, lies.</p>
<p>And so if you wanna find something unbelievable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier to do that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not constrained by the truth.</p>
<p>So they found that the emotional valence</p>
<p>of false information was just much higher.</p>
<p>It was more likely to be shocking,</p>
<p>and therefore more likely to be spread.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing was that</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily driven by the algorithms.</p>
<p>I know that there is some evidence,</p>
<p>Zeynep Tufekci and others have pointed out on YouTube,</p>
<p>some of the algorithms unintentionally were tuned</p>
<p>to amplify more extremist content.</p>
<p>But in the study of Twitter that Sinan and Deb and others did,</p>
<p>they found that even if you took out all the bots</p>
<p>and all the automated tweets,</p>
<p>you still had lies spreading significantly faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the problems with ourselves</p>
<p>that we just can&rsquo;t resist passing on the salacious content.</p>
<p>But I also blame the platforms</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s different ways you can design a platform.</p>
<p>You can design a platform in a way</p>
<p>that makes it easy to spread lies</p>
<p>and to retweet and spread things on,</p>
<p>or you can kind of put some friction on that</p>
<p>and try to favor truth.</p>
<p>I had dinner with Jimmy Wales once,</p>
<p>the guy who helped found Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And he convinced me that, look,</p>
<p>you can make some design choices,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s at Facebook, at Twitter,</p>
<p>at Wikipedia, or Reddit, whatever,</p>
<p>and depending on how you make those choices,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely or less likely to have false news.</p>
<p>Create a little bit of friction, like you said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the, and so if I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>It could be friction, it could be speeding the truth,</p>
<p>either way, but, and I don&rsquo;t totally understand&hellip;</p>
<p>Speeding the truth, I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Amplifying it and giving it more credit.</p>
<p>And in academia, which is far, far from perfect,</p>
<p>but when someone has an important discovery,</p>
<p>it tends to get more cited</p>
<p>and people kind of look to it more</p>
<p>and sort of, it tends to get amplified a little bit.</p>
<p>So you could try to do that too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the silver bullet is,</p>
<p>but the meta point is that if we spend time</p>
<p>thinking about it, we can amplify truth over falsehoods.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m disappointed in the heads of these social networks</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t been as successful</p>
<p>or maybe haven&rsquo;t tried as hard to amplify truth.</p>
<p>And part of it, going back to what we said earlier,</p>
<p>is these revenue models may push them</p>
<p>more towards growing fast, spreading information rapidly,</p>
<p>getting lots of users,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t the same thing as finding truth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, implicit in what you&rsquo;re saying now</p>
<p>is a hopeful message that with platforms,</p>
<p>we can take a step towards a greater</p>
<p>and greater popularity of truth.</p>
<p>But the more cynical view is that</p>
<p>what the last few years have revealed</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made</p>
<p>in dismantling even the idea of truth,</p>
<p>that nothing is true.</p>
<p>And as a thought experiment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that our future will have,</p>
<p>like the idea of truth is something we won&rsquo;t even have.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible in the future</p>
<p>that everything is on the table in terms of truth,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just swimming in this kind of digital economy</p>
<p>where ideas are just little toys</p>
<p>that are not at all connected to reality?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a technological determinist,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inevitable that it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing that I&rsquo;ve come away with</p>
<p>every time I do these studies,</p>
<p>and I emphasize it in my books and elsewhere,</p>
<p>is that technology doesn&rsquo;t shape our destiny,</p>
<p>we shape our destiny.</p>
<p>So just by us having this conversation,</p>
<p>I hope that your audience is gonna take it upon themselves</p>
<p>as they design their products,</p>
<p>and they think about, they use products,</p>
<p>as they manage companies,</p>
<p>how can they make conscious decisions</p>
<p>to favor truth over falsehoods,</p>
<p>favor the better kinds of societies,</p>
<p>and not abdicate and say, well, we just build the tools.</p>
<p>I think there was a saying that,</p>
<p>was it the German scientist</p>
<p>when they were working on the missiles in late World War II?</p>
<p>They said, well, our job is to make the missiles go up.</p>
<p>Where they come down, that&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s department.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obviously not the, I think it&rsquo;s obvious,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the right attitude</p>
<p>that technologists should have,</p>
<p>that engineers should have.</p>
<p>They should be very conscious</p>
<p>about what the implications are.</p>
<p>And if we think carefully about it,</p>
<p>we can avoid the kind of world that you just described,</p>
<p>where truth is all relative.</p>
<p>There are going to be people who benefit from a world</p>
<p>of where people don&rsquo;t check facts,</p>
<p>and where truth is relative,</p>
<p>and popularity or fame or money is orthogonal to truth.</p>
<p>But one of the reasons I suspect</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had so much progress over the past few hundred</p>
<p>years is the invention of the scientific method,</p>
<p>which is a really powerful tool or meta tool</p>
<p>for finding truth and favoring things that are true</p>
<p>versus things that are false.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t pass the scientific method,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re less likely to be true.</p>
<p>And that has, the societies and the people</p>
<p>and the organizations that embrace that</p>
<p>have done a lot better than the ones who haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m hoping that people keep that in mind</p>
<p>and continue to try to embrace not just the truth,</p>
<p>but methods that lead to the truth.</p>
<p>So maybe on a more personal question,</p>
<p>if one were to try to build a competitor to Twitter,</p>
<p>what would you advise?</p>
<p>Is there, I mean, the bigger, the meta question,</p>
<p>is that the right way to improve systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that the underlying premise</p>
<p>behind Twitter and all these networks is amazing,</p>
<p>that we can communicate with each other.</p>
<p>And I use it a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a subpart of Twitter called Econ Twitter,</p>
<p>where we economists tweet to each other</p>
<p>and talk about new papers.</p>
<p>Something came out in the NBER,</p>
<p>the National Bureau of Economic Research,</p>
<p>and we share about it.</p>
<p>People critique it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been a godsend</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really sped up the scientific process,</p>
<p>if you can call economic scientific.</p>
<p>Does it get divisive in that little?</p>
<p>Sometimes, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Sometimes it does.</p>
<p>It can also be done in nasty ways and there&rsquo;s the bad parts.</p>
<p>But the good parts are great</p>
<p>because you just speed up that clock speed</p>
<p>of learning about things.</p>
<p>Instead of like in the old, old days,</p>
<p>waiting to read it in a journal,</p>
<p>or the not so old days when you&rsquo;d see it posted</p>
<p>on a website and you&rsquo;d read it.</p>
<p>Now on Twitter, people will distill it down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a real art to getting to the essence of things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been great.</p>
<p>But it certainly, we all know that Twitter</p>
<p>can be a cesspool of misinformation.</p>
<p>And like I just said,</p>
<p>unfortunately misinformation tends to spread faster</p>
<p>on Twitter than truth.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of people</p>
<p>who are very vulnerable to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve been fooled at times.</p>
<p>There are agents, whether from Russia</p>
<p>or from political groups or others</p>
<p>that explicitly create efforts at misinformation</p>
<p>and efforts at getting people to hate each other.</p>
<p>Or even more important lately I&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>is nut picking.</p>
<p>You know the idea of nut picking?</p>
<p>No, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good term.</p>
<p>Nut picking is when you find like an extreme nut case</p>
<p>on the other side and then you amplify them</p>
<p>and make it seem like that&rsquo;s typical of the other side.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not literally lying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking some idiot, you know,</p>
<p>renting on the subway or just, you know,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re in the KKK or Antifa or whatever,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just, and you,</p>
<p>normally nobody would pay attention to this guy.</p>
<p>Like 12 people would see him and it&rsquo;d be the end.</p>
<p>Instead with video or whatever,</p>
<p>you get tens of millions of people say it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this, you know, I look at it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I get angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t believe that person</p>
<p>did something so terrible.</p>
<p>Let me tell all my friends about this terrible person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great way to generate division.</p>
<p>I talked to a friend who studied Russian misinformation</p>
<p>campaigns, and they&rsquo;re very clever about literally</p>
<p>being on both sides of some of these debates.</p>
<p>They would have some people pretend to be part of BLM.</p>
<p>Some people pretend to be white nationalists</p>
<p>and they would be throwing epithets at each other,</p>
<p>saying crazy things at each other.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re literally playing both sides of it,</p>
<p>but their goal wasn&rsquo;t for one or the other to win.</p>
<p>It was for everybody to get behaving</p>
<p>and distrusting everyone else.</p>
<p>So these tools can definitely be used for that.</p>
<p>And they are being used for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been super destructive for our democracy</p>
<p>and our society.</p>
<p>And the people who run these platforms,</p>
<p>I think have a social responsibility,</p>
<p>a moral and ethical, personal responsibility</p>
<p>to do a better job and to shut that stuff down.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you can shut it down,</p>
<p>but to design them in a way that, you know,</p>
<p>as I said earlier, favors truth over falsehoods</p>
<p>and favors positive types of</p>
<p>communication versus destructive ones.</p>
<p>And just like you said, it&rsquo;s also on us.</p>
<p>I try to be all about love and compassion,</p>
<p>empathy on Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things,</p>
<p>nut picking is a fascinating term.</p>
<p>One of the things that people do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think even more dangerous</p>
<p>is nut picking applied to individual statements</p>
<p>of good people.</p>
<p>So basically worst case analysis in computer science</p>
<p>is taking sometimes out of context,</p>
<p>but sometimes in context,</p>
<p>a statement, one statement by a person,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been, because I&rsquo;ve been reading</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>I often talk about Hitler on this podcast with folks</p>
<p>and it is so easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really dangerous.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m all leaning in, I&rsquo;m 100%.</p>
<p>Because, well, it&rsquo;s actually a safer place</p>
<p>than people realize because it&rsquo;s history</p>
<p>and history in long form is actually very fascinating</p>
<p>to think about and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I could see how that could be taken</p>
<p>totally out of context and it&rsquo;s very worrying.</p>
<p>You know, these digital infrastructures,</p>
<p>not just they disseminate things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re sort of permanent.</p>
<p>So anything you say at some point,</p>
<p>someone can go back and find something you said</p>
<p>three years ago, perhaps jokingly, perhaps not,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re just wrong and you made them, you know,</p>
<p>and like that becomes, they can use that to define you</p>
<p>if they have ill intent.</p>
<p>And we all need to be a little more forgiving.</p>
<p>I mean, somewhere in my 20s, I told myself,</p>
<p>I was going through all my different friends</p>
<p>and I was like, you know, every one of them</p>
<p>has at least like one nutty opinion.</p>
<p>And I was like, there&rsquo;s like nobody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like completely, except me, of course,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure they thought that about me too.</p>
<p>And so you just kind of like learned</p>
<p>to be a little bit tolerant that like, okay,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder who the responsibility lays on there.</p>
<p>Like, I think ultimately it&rsquo;s about leadership.</p>
<p>Like the previous president, Barack Obama,</p>
<p>has been, I think, quite eloquent</p>
<p>at walking this very difficult line</p>
<p>of talking about cancel culture, but it&rsquo;s a difficult,</p>
<p>it takes skill.</p>
<p>Because you say the wrong thing</p>
<p>and you piss off a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so you have to do it well.</p>
<p>But then also the platform of the technology is,</p>
<p>should slow down, create friction,</p>
<p>and spreading this kind of nut picking in all its forms.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>No, and your point that we have to like learn over time,</p>
<p>how to manage it.</p>
<p>I mean, we can&rsquo;t put it all on the platform</p>
<p>and say, you guys design it.</p>
<p>Because if we&rsquo;re idiots about using it,</p>
<p>nobody can design a platform that withstands that.</p>
<p>And every new technology people learn its dangers.</p>
<p>You know, when someone invented fire,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great cooking and everything,</p>
<p>but then somebody burned themself.</p>
<p>And then you had to like learn how to like avoid,</p>
<p>maybe somebody invented a fire extinguisher later.</p>
<p>So you kind of like figure out ways</p>
<p>of working around these technologies.</p>
<p>Someone invented seat belts, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly true</p>
<p>with all the new digital technologies</p>
<p>that we have to figure out,</p>
<p>not just technologies that protect us,</p>
<p>but ways of using them that emphasize</p>
<p>that are more likely to be successful than dangerous.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve written quite a bit</p>
<p>about how artificial intelligence might change our world.</p>
<p>How do you think if we look forward,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict the future,</p>
<p>but if we look at trends from the past</p>
<p>and we tried to predict what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>in the rest of the 21st century,</p>
<p>how do you think AI will change our world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m mostly a techno optimist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at the extreme, you know,</p>
<p>the singularity is near end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>but I do think that we&rsquo;re likely in</p>
<p>for some significantly improved living standards,</p>
<p>some really important progress,</p>
<p>even just the technologies that are already kind of like</p>
<p>in the can that haven&rsquo;t diffused.</p>
<p>You know, when I talked earlier about the J curve,</p>
<p>it could take 10, 20, 30 years for an existing technology</p>
<p>to have the kind of profound effects.</p>
<p>And when I look at whether it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>vision systems, voice recognition, problem solving systems,</p>
<p>even if nothing new got invented,</p>
<p>we would have a few decades of progress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited about that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s gonna lead to us being wealthier,</p>
<p>healthier, I mean,</p>
<p>the healthcare is probably one of the applications</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good news.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna have the end of work anytime soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many things that machines still can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>When I look around the world</p>
<p>and think of whether it&rsquo;s childcare or healthcare,</p>
<p>cleaning the environment, interacting with people,</p>
<p>scientific work, artistic creativity,</p>
<p>these are things that for now,</p>
<p>machines aren&rsquo;t able to do nearly as well as humans,</p>
<p>even just something as mundane as, you know,</p>
<p>folding laundry or whatever.</p>
<p>And many of these, I think are gonna be years or decades</p>
<p>before machines catch up.</p>
<p>You know, I may be surprised on some of them,</p>
<p>but overall, I think there&rsquo;s plenty of work</p>
<p>for humans to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of problems in society</p>
<p>that need the human touch.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to repurpose.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to, as machines are able to do some tasks,</p>
<p>people are gonna have to reskill and move into other areas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s gonna be going on</p>
<p>for the next, you know, 10, 20, 30 years or more,</p>
<p>kind of big restructuring of society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get wealthier and people will have to do new skills.</p>
<p>Now, if you turn the dial further, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>50 or a hundred years into the future,</p>
<p>then, you know, maybe all bets are off.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s possible that machines will be able to do</p>
<p>most of what people do.</p>
<p>You know, say one or 200 years, I think it&rsquo;s even likely.</p>
<p>And at that point,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re more in the sort of abundance economy.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re in a world where there&rsquo;s really little</p>
<p>for the humans can do economically better than machines,</p>
<p>other than be human.</p>
<p>And, you know, that will take a transition as well,</p>
<p>kind of more of a transition of how we get meaning in life</p>
<p>and what our values are.</p>
<p>But shame on us if we screw that up.</p>
<p>I mean, that should be like great, great news.</p>
<p>And it kind of saddens me that some people see that</p>
<p>as like a big problem.</p>
<p>I think that would be, should be wonderful</p>
<p>if people have all the health and material things</p>
<p>that they need and can focus on loving each other</p>
<p>and discussing philosophy and playing</p>
<p>and doing all the other things that don&rsquo;t require work.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;d be surprised to see what the 20,</p>
<p>if we were to travel in time, 100 years into the future,</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to,</p>
<p>like if I gave you a month to like talk to people,</p>
<p>no, like let&rsquo;s say a week,</p>
<p>would you be able to understand what the hell&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>You mean if I was there for a week?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you were there for a week.</p>
<p>A hundred years in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, so I&rsquo;ll give you one thought experiment is like,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it possible that we&rsquo;re all living in virtual reality</p>
<p>by then?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played around with some of those VR headsets</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not great,</p>
<p>but I mean the average person spends many waking hours</p>
<p>staring at screens right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of low res compared to what they could be</p>
<p>in 30 or 50 years, but certainly games</p>
<p>and why not any other interactions could be done with VR?</p>
<p>And that would be a pretty different world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d all, in some ways be as rich as we wanted.</p>
<p>We could have castles and we could be traveling</p>
<p>anywhere we want and it could obviously be multisensory.</p>
<p>So that would be possible and of course there&rsquo;s people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had Elon Musk on and others, there are people,</p>
<p>Nick Bostrom makes the simulation argument</p>
<p>that maybe we&rsquo;re already there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already there.</p>
<p>So, but in general, or do you not even think about</p>
<p>in this kind of way, you&rsquo;re self critically thinking,</p>
<p>how good are you as an economist at predicting</p>
<p>what the future looks like?</p>
<p>Do you have a?</p>
<p>Well, it starts getting, I mean,</p>
<p>I feel reasonably comfortable the next five, 10, 20 years</p>
<p>in terms of that path.</p>
<p>When you start getting truly superhuman</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, kind of by definition,</p>
<p>be able to think of a lot of things</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t have thought of and create a world</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not sure I can predict what that world</p>
<p>is going to be like.</p>
<p>One thing that AI researchers, AI safety researchers</p>
<p>worry about is what&rsquo;s called the alignment problem.</p>
<p>When an AI is that powerful,</p>
<p>then they can do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And you really hope that their values</p>
<p>are aligned with our values.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even tricky to finding what our values are.</p>
<p>I mean, first off, we all have different values.</p>
<p>And secondly, maybe if we were smarter,</p>
<p>we would have better values.</p>
<p>Like, I like to think that we have better values</p>
<p>than we did in 1860 and, or in the year 200 BC</p>
<p>on a lot of dimensions,</p>
<p>things that we consider barbaric today.</p>
<p>And it may be that if I thought about it more deeply,</p>
<p>I would also be morally evolved.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;d be a vegetarian or do other things</p>
<p>that right now, whether my future self</p>
<p>would consider kind of immoral.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tricky problem,</p>
<p>getting the AI to do what we want,</p>
<p>assuming it&rsquo;s even a friendly AI.</p>
<p>I mean, I should probably mention</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a nontrivial other branch</p>
<p>where we destroy ourselves, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of exponentially improving</p>
<p>technologies that could be ferociously destructive,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in nanotechnology or biotech</p>
<p>and weaponized viruses, AI and other things that.</p>
<p>nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons, of course.</p>
<p>The old school technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, good old nuclear weapons that could be devastating</p>
<p>or even existential and new things yet to be invented.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a branch that I think is pretty significant.</p>
<p>And there are those who think that one of the reasons</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t been contacted by other civilizations, right?</p>
<p>Is that once you get to a certain level of complexity</p>
<p>in technology, there&rsquo;s just too many ways to go wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to blow yourself up.</p>
<p>And people, or I should say species,</p>
<p>end up falling into one of those traps.</p>
<p>The great filter.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an optimistic view of that.</p>
<p>If there is literally no intelligent life out there</p>
<p>in the universe, or at least in our galaxy,</p>
<p>that means that we&rsquo;ve passed at least one</p>
<p>of the great filters or some of the great filters</p>
<p>that we survived.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think Robin Hansen has a good way of,</p>
<p>maybe others have a good way of thinking about this,</p>
<p>that if there are no other intelligence creatures out there</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to detect,</p>
<p>one possibility is that there&rsquo;s a filter ahead of us.</p>
<p>And when you get a little more advanced,</p>
<p>maybe in a hundred or a thousand or 10,000 years,</p>
<p>things just get destroyed for some reason.</p>
<p>The other one is the great filters behind us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be good, is that most planets don&rsquo;t even evolve life</p>
<p>or if they don&rsquo;t evolve life,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t evolve intelligent life.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ve gotten past that.</p>
<p>And so now maybe we&rsquo;re on the good side</p>
<p>of the great filter.</p>
<p>So if we sort of rewind back and look at the thing</p>
<p>where we could say something a little bit more comfortably</p>
<p>at five years and 10 years out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written about jobs</p>
<p>and the impact on sort of our economy and the jobs</p>
<p>in terms of artificial intelligence that it might have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating question of what kind of jobs are safe,</p>
<p>what kind of jobs are not.</p>
<p>Can you maybe speak to your intuition</p>
<p>about how we should think about AI changing</p>
<p>the landscape of work?</p>
<p>Sure, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, this is a really important question</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;re very far</p>
<p>from artificial general intelligence,</p>
<p>which is AI that can just do the full breadth</p>
<p>of what humans can do.</p>
<p>But we do have human level or superhuman level</p>
<p>narrow intelligence, narrow artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And obviously my calculator can do math a lot better</p>
<p>than I can.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of other things</p>
<p>that machines can do better than I can.</p>
<p>So which is which?</p>
<p>We actually set out to address that question</p>
<p>with Tom Mitchell.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper called what can machine learning do</p>
<p>that was in science.</p>
<p>And we went and interviewed a whole bunch of AI experts</p>
<p>and kind of synthesized what they thought machine learning</p>
<p>was good at and wasn&rsquo;t good at.</p>
<p>And we came up with what we called a rubric,</p>
<p>basically a set of questions you can ask about any task</p>
<p>that will tell you whether it&rsquo;s likely to score high or low</p>
<p>on suitability for machine learning.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve applied that</p>
<p>to a bunch of tasks in the economy.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a data set of all the tasks</p>
<p>in the US economy, believe it or not, it&rsquo;s called ONET.</p>
<p>The US government put it together,</p>
<p>part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>They divide the economy into about 970 occupations</p>
<p>like bus driver, economist, primary school teacher,</p>
<p>radiologist, and then for each one of them,</p>
<p>they describe which tasks need to be done.</p>
<p>Like for radiologists, there are 27 distinct tasks.</p>
<p>So we went through all those tasks</p>
<p>to see whether or not a machine could do them.</p>
<p>And what we found interestingly was&hellip;</p>
<p>Brilliant study by the way, that&rsquo;s so awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>So what we found was that there was no occupation</p>
<p>in our data set where machine learning just ran the table</p>
<p>and did everything.</p>
<p>And there was almost no occupation</p>
<p>where machine learning didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>like a significant ability to do things.</p>
<p>Like take radiology, a lot of people I hear saying,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the end of radiology.</p>
<p>And one of the 27 tasks is read medical images.</p>
<p>Really important one, like it&rsquo;s kind of a core job.</p>
<p>And machines have basically gotten as good</p>
<p>or better than radiologists.</p>
<p>There was just an article in Nature last week,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been publishing them for the past few years</p>
<p>showing that machine learning can do as well as humans</p>
<p>on many kinds of diagnostic imaging tasks.</p>
<p>But other things that radiologists do,</p>
<p>they sometimes administer conscious sedation.</p>
<p>They sometimes do physical exams.</p>
<p>They have to synthesize the results</p>
<p>and explain it to the other doctors or to the patients.</p>
<p>In all those categories,</p>
<p>machine learning isn&rsquo;t really up to snuff yet.</p>
<p>So that job, we&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of restructuring.</p>
<p>Parts of the job, they&rsquo;ll hand over to machines.</p>
<p>Others, humans will do more of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been more or less the pattern all of them.</p>
<p>So, you know, to oversimplify a bit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of restructuring,</p>
<p>reorganization of work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s real gonna be a great time.</p>
<p>It is a great time for smart entrepreneurs and managers</p>
<p>to do that reinvention of work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna see mass unemployment.</p>
<p>To get more specifically to your question,</p>
<p>the kinds of tasks that machines tend to be good at</p>
<p>are a lot of routine problem solving,</p>
<p>mapping inputs X into outputs Y.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of data on the Xs and the Ys,</p>
<p>the inputs and the outputs,</p>
<p>you can do that kind of mapping and find the relationships.</p>
<p>They tend to not be very good at,</p>
<p>even now, fine motor control and dexterity.</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence and human interactions</p>
<p>and thinking outside the box, creative work.</p>
<p>If you give it a well structured task,</p>
<p>machines can be very good at it.</p>
<p>But even asking the right questions, that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quote that Andrew McAfee and I use</p>
<p>in our book, Second Machine Age.</p>
<p>Apparently Pablo Picasso was shown an early computer</p>
<p>and he came away kind of unimpressed.</p>
<p>He goes, well, I don&rsquo;t see all the fusses.</p>
<p>All that does is answer questions.</p>
<p>And to him, the interesting thing was asking the questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, try to replace me, GPT3, I dare you.</p>
<p>Although some people think I&rsquo;m a robot.</p>
<p>You have this cool plot that shows,</p>
<p>I just remember where economists land,</p>
<p>where I think the X axis is the income.</p>
<p>And then the Y axis is, I guess,</p>
<p>aggregating the information of how replaceable the job is.</p>
<p>Or I think there&rsquo;s an index.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a suitability for machine learning index.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So we have all 970 occupations on that chart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool plot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s scatters in all four corners</p>
<p>have some occupations.</p>
<p>But there is a definite pattern,</p>
<p>which is the lower wage occupations tend to have more tasks</p>
<p>that are suitable for machine learning, like cashiers.</p>
<p>I mean, anyone who&rsquo;s gone to a supermarket or CVS</p>
<p>knows that they not only read barcodes,</p>
<p>but they can recognize an apple and an orange</p>
<p>and a lot of things cashiers, humans used to be needed for.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>there are some jobs like airline pilot</p>
<p>that are among the highest paid in our economy,</p>
<p>but also a lot of them are suitable for machine learning.</p>
<p>A lot of those tasks are.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, you mentioned economists.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help peeking at those</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re paid a fair amount,</p>
<p>maybe not as much as some of us think they should be.</p>
<p>But they have some tasks that are suitable</p>
<p>for machine learning, but for now at least,</p>
<p>most of the tasks of economists</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t end up being in that category.</p>
<p>And I should say, I didn&rsquo;t like create that data.</p>
<p>We just took the analysis and that&rsquo;s what came out of it.</p>
<p>And over time, that scatter plot will be updated</p>
<p>as the technology improves.</p>
<p>But it was just interesting to see the pattern there.</p>
<p>And it is a little troubling in so far</p>
<p>as if you just take the technology as it is today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely to worsen income inequality</p>
<p>on a lot of dimensions.</p>
<p>So on this topic of the effect of AI</p>
<p>on our landscape of work,</p>
<p>one of the people that have been speaking about it</p>
<p>in the public domain, public discourse</p>
<p>is the presidential candidate, Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Andrew?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about UBI,</p>
<p>that universal basic income</p>
<p>that he made one of the core ideas,</p>
<p>by the way, he has like hundreds of ideas</p>
<p>about like everything, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about him</p>
<p>and what are your thoughts about UBI?</p>
<p>Let me answer the question about his broader approach first.</p>
<p>I mean, I just love that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really thoughtful, analytical.</p>
<p>I agree with his values.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And he read my book and mentions it sometimes,</p>
<p>so it makes me even more excited.</p>
<p>And the thing that he really made the centerpiece</p>
<p>of his campaign was UBI.</p>
<p>And I was originally kind of a fan of it.</p>
<p>And then as I studied it more, I became less of a fan,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m beginning to come back a little bit.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a little bit of my evolution.</p>
<p>As an economist, we have, by looking at the problem</p>
<p>of people not having enough income and the simplest thing</p>
<p>is, well, why don&rsquo;t we write them a check?</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>But then I talked to my sociologist friends</p>
<p>and they really convinced me that just writing a check</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really get at the core values.</p>
<p>Voltaire once said that work solves three great ills,</p>
<p>boredom, vice, and need.</p>
<p>And you can deal with the need thing by writing a check,</p>
<p>but people need a sense of meaning,</p>
<p>they need something to do.</p>
<p>And when, say, steel workers or coal miners lost their jobs</p>
<p>and were just given checks, alcoholism, depression, divorce,</p>
<p>all those social indicators, drug use, all went way up.</p>
<p>People just weren&rsquo;t happy</p>
<p>just sitting around collecting a check.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s part of the way they were raised.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s something innate in people</p>
<p>that they need to feel wanted and needed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as simple as just writing people a check.</p>
<p>You need to also give them a way to have a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>And that was important to me.</p>
<p>And the second thing is that, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we are far from the end of work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the idea that there&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>not enough work to be done.</p>
<p>I see like our cities need to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>And robots can&rsquo;t do most of that.</p>
<p>We need to have better childcare.</p>
<p>We need better healthcare.</p>
<p>We need to take care of people who are mentally ill or older.</p>
<p>We need to repair our roads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much work that require at least partly,</p>
<p>maybe entirely a human component.</p>
<p>So rather than like write all these people off,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find a way to repurpose them and keep them engaged.</p>
<p>Now that said, I would like to see more buying power</p>
<p>from people who are sort of at the bottom end</p>
<p>of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The economy has been designed and evolved in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think very unfair to a lot of hardworking people.</p>
<p>I see super hardworking people who aren&rsquo;t really seeing</p>
<p>their wages grow over the past 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>while some other people who have been super smart</p>
<p>and or super lucky have made billions</p>
<p>or hundreds of billions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they need those hundreds of billions</p>
<p>to have the right incentives to invent things.</p>
<p>I think if you talk to almost any of them as I have,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think that they need an extra $10 billion</p>
<p>to do what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Most of them probably would love to do it for only a billion</p>
<p>or maybe for nothing.</p>
<p>For nothing, many of them, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, an interesting point to make is,</p>
<p>do we think that Bill Gates would have founded Microsoft</p>
<p>if tax rates were 70%?</p>
<p>Well, we know he would have because they were tax rates</p>
<p>of 70% when he founded it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s as big a deterrent</p>
<p>and we could provide more buying power to people.</p>
<p>My own favorite tool is the Earned Income Tax Credit,</p>
<p>which is basically a way of supplementing income</p>
<p>of people who have jobs and giving employers</p>
<p>an incentive to hire even more people.</p>
<p>The minimum wage can discourage employment,</p>
<p>but the Earned Income Tax Credit encourages employment</p>
<p>by supplementing people&rsquo;s wages.</p>
<p>If the employer can only afford to pay them $10 for a task,</p>
<p>the rest of us kick in another five or $10</p>
<p>and bring their wages up to 15 or 20 total.</p>
<p>And then they have more buying power.</p>
<p>Then entrepreneurs are thinking, how can we cater to them?</p>
<p>How can we make products for them?</p>
<p>And it becomes a self reinforcing system</p>
<p>where people are better off.</p>
<p>Ian Drang and I had a good discussion</p>
<p>where he suggested instead of a universal basic income,</p>
<p>he suggested, or instead of an unconditional basic income,</p>
<p>how about a conditional basic income</p>
<p>where the condition is you learn some new skills,</p>
<p>we need to reskill our workforce.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make it easier for people to find ways</p>
<p>to get those skills and get rewarded for doing them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a neat idea as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So, I mean, one of the questions,</p>
<p>one of the dreams of UBI is that you provide</p>
<p>some little safety net while you retrain,</p>
<p>while you learn a new skill.</p>
<p>But like, I think, I guess you&rsquo;re speaking</p>
<p>to the intuition that that doesn&rsquo;t always,</p>
<p>like there needs to be some incentive to reskill,</p>
<p>to train, to learn a new thing.</p>
<p>I think it helps.</p>
<p>I mean, there are lots of self motivated people,</p>
<p>but there are also people that maybe need a little guidance</p>
<p>or help and I think it&rsquo;s a really hard question</p>
<p>for someone who is losing a job in one area to know</p>
<p>what is the new area I should be learning skills in.</p>
<p>And we could provide a much better set of tools</p>
<p>and platforms that maps it.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s a set of skills you already have.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s in demand.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a path for you to go from where you are</p>
<p>to where you need to be.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a total, how do I put it nicely about myself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally clueless about the economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not totally true, but pretty good approximation.</p>
<p>If you were to try to fix our tax system</p>
<p>and, or maybe from another side,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s fundamental problems in taxation</p>
<p>or some fundamental problems about our economy,</p>
<p>what would you try to fix?</p>
<p>What would you try to speak to?</p>
<p>You know, I definitely think our whole tax system,</p>
<p>our political and economic system has gotten more</p>
<p>and more screwed up over the past 20, 30 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that hard to make headway</p>
<p>in improving it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need to totally reinvent stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of it is what I&rsquo;ve been elsewhere with Andy</p>
<p>and others called economics 101.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s just some basic principles</p>
<p>that have worked really well in the 20th century</p>
<p>that we sort of forgot, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of investing in education,</p>
<p>investing in infrastructure, welcoming immigrants,</p>
<p>having a tax system that was more progressive and fair.</p>
<p>At one point, tax rates were on top incomes</p>
<p>were significantly higher.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve come down a lot to the point where</p>
<p>in many cases they&rsquo;re lower now</p>
<p>than they are for poorer people.</p>
<p>So, and we could do things like earned income tax credit</p>
<p>to get a little more wonky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see more Pigouvian taxes.</p>
<p>What that means is you tax things that are bad</p>
<p>instead of things that are good.</p>
<p>So right now we tax labor, we tax capital</p>
<p>and which is unfortunate</p>
<p>because one of the basic principles of economics</p>
<p>if you tax something, you tend to get less of it.</p>
<p>So, you know, right now there&rsquo;s still work to be done</p>
<p>and still capital to be invested in.</p>
<p>But instead we should be taxing things like pollution</p>
<p>and congestion.</p>
<p>And if we did that, we would have less pollution.</p>
<p>So a carbon tax is, you know,</p>
<p>almost every economist would say it&rsquo;s a no brainer</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re Republican or Democrat,</p>
<p>Greg Mankiw who is head of George Bush&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Council of Economic Advisers or Dick Schmollensie</p>
<p>who is another Republican economist agree.</p>
<p>And of course a lot of Democratic economists agree as well.</p>
<p>If we taxed carbon,</p>
<p>we could raise hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>We could take that money and redistribute it</p>
<p>through an earned income tax credit or other things</p>
<p>so that overall our tax system would become more progressive.</p>
<p>We could tax congestion.</p>
<p>One of the things that kills me as an economist</p>
<p>is every time I sit in a traffic jam,</p>
<p>I know that it&rsquo;s completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>This is complete wasted time.</p>
<p>You just visualize the cost and productivity.</p>
<p>Exactly, because they are taking costs for me</p>
<p>and all the people around me.</p>
<p>And if they charged a congestion tax,</p>
<p>they would take that same amount of money</p>
<p>and people would, it would streamline the roads.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re in Singapore, the traffic just flows</p>
<p>because they have a congestion tax.</p>
<p>They listened to economists.</p>
<p>They invited me and others to go talk to them.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d still be paying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be paying a congestion tax instead of paying in my time,</p>
<p>but that money would now be available for healthcare,</p>
<p>be available for infrastructure,</p>
<p>or be available just to give to people</p>
<p>so they could buy food or whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it saddens me when you sit,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting in a traffic jam,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like taxing me and then taking that money</p>
<p>and dumping it in the ocean, just like destroying it.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things like that</p>
<p>that economists, and I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like doing anything radical here.</p>
<p>Most, you know, good economists would,</p>
<p>I probably agree with me point by point on these things.</p>
<p>And we could do those things</p>
<p>and our whole economy would become much more efficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d become fairer, invest in R&amp;D and research,</p>
<p>which is close to a free lunch is what we have.</p>
<p>My erstwhile MIT colleague, Bob Solla,</p>
<p>got the Nobel Prize, not yesterday, but 30 years ago,</p>
<p>for describing that most improvements</p>
<p>in living standards come from tech progress.</p>
<p>And Paul Romer later got a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for noting that investments in R&amp;D and human capital</p>
<p>can speed the rate of tech progress.</p>
<p>So if we do that, then we&rsquo;ll be healthier and wealthier.</p>
<p>Yeah, from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>I remember taking an undergrad econ,</p>
<p>you mentioned econ 101.</p>
<p>It seemed from all the plots I saw</p>
<p>that R&amp;D is an obvious, as close to free lunch as we have,</p>
<p>it seemed like obvious that we should do more research.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Like what, what, like, there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>Well, we should do basic research.</p>
<p>I mean, so let me just be clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if everybody did more research</p>
<p>and I would make this issue</p>
<p>between applied development versus basic research.</p>
<p>So applied development, like, you know,</p>
<p>how do we get this self driving car, you know,</p>
<p>feature to work better in the Tesla?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great for private companies</p>
<p>because they can capture the value from that.</p>
<p>If they make a better self driving car system,</p>
<p>they can sell cars that are more valuable</p>
<p>and then make money.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an incentive that there&rsquo;s not a big problem there</p>
<p>and smart companies, Amazon, Tesla,</p>
<p>and others are investing in it.</p>
<p>The problem is with basic research,</p>
<p>like coming up with core basic ideas,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in nuclear fusion</p>
<p>or artificial intelligence or biotech.</p>
<p>There, if someone invents something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for them to capture the benefits from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shared by everybody, which is great in a way,</p>
<p>but it means that they&rsquo;re not gonna have the incentives</p>
<p>to put as much effort into it.</p>
<p>There you need, it&rsquo;s a classic public good.</p>
<p>There you need the government to be involved in it.</p>
<p>And the US government used to be investing much more in R&amp;D,</p>
<p>but we have slashed that part of the government</p>
<p>really foolishly and we&rsquo;re all poorer,</p>
<p>significantly poorer as a result.</p>
<p>Growth rates are down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not having the kind of scientific progress</p>
<p>we used to have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been sort of a short term eating the seed corn,</p>
<p>whatever metaphor you wanna use</p>
<p>where people grab some money, put it in their pockets today,</p>
<p>but five, 10, 20 years later,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a lot poorer than they otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re living through a pandemic right now,</p>
<p>globally in the United States.</p>
<p>From an economics perspective,</p>
<p>how do you think this pandemic will change the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been remarkable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s horrible how many people have suffered,</p>
<p>the amount of death, the economic destruction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also striking just the amount of change in work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>In the last 20 weeks, I&rsquo;ve seen more change</p>
<p>than there were in the previous 20 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been nothing like it</p>
<p>since probably the World War II mobilization</p>
<p>in terms of reorganizing our economy.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is the shift to remote work.</p>
<p>And I and many other people stopped going into the office</p>
<p>and teaching my students in person.</p>
<p>I did a study on this with a bunch of colleagues</p>
<p>at MIT and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And what we found was that before the pandemic,</p>
<p>in the beginning of 2020, about one in six,</p>
<p>a little over 15% of Americans were working remotely.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, that grew steadily and hit 50%,</p>
<p>roughly half of Americans working at home.</p>
<p>So a complete transformation.</p>
<p>And of course, it wasn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like everybody did it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an information worker, professional,</p>
<p>if you work mainly with data,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re much more likely to work at home.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a manufacturing worker,</p>
<p>working with other people or physical things,</p>
<p>then it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to work at home.</p>
<p>And instead, those people were much more likely</p>
<p>to become laid off or unemployed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been something that&rsquo;s had very disparate effects</p>
<p>on different parts of the workforce.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s gonna be sticky in a sense</p>
<p>that after vaccine comes out and the economy reopens,</p>
<p>do you think remote work will continue?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is yes, a lot of it will.</p>
<p>Of course, some of it will go back,</p>
<p>but a surprising amount of it will stay.</p>
<p>I personally, for instance, I moved my seminars,</p>
<p>my academic seminars to Zoom,</p>
<p>and I was surprised how well it worked.</p>
<p>So it works?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, obviously we were able to reach</p>
<p>a much broader audience.</p>
<p>So we have people tuning in from Europe</p>
<p>and other countries,</p>
<p>just all over the United States for that matter.</p>
<p>I also actually found that it would,</p>
<p>in many ways, is more egalitarian.</p>
<p>We use the chat feature and other tools,</p>
<p>and grad students and others who might&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a little shy about speaking up,</p>
<p>we now kind of have more of ability for lots of voices.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re answering each other&rsquo;s questions,</p>
<p>so you kind of get parallel.</p>
<p>Like if someone had some question about some of the data</p>
<p>or a reference or whatever,</p>
<p>then someone else in the chat would answer it.</p>
<p>And the whole thing just became like a higher bandwidth,</p>
<p>higher quality thing.</p>
<p>So I thought that was kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are discovering that these tools</p>
<p>that thanks to technologists have been developed</p>
<p>over the past decade,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a lot more powerful than we thought.</p>
<p>I mean, all the terrible things we&rsquo;ve seen with COVID</p>
<p>and the real failure of many of our institutions</p>
<p>that I thought would work better.</p>
<p>One area that&rsquo;s been a bright spot is our technologies.</p>
<p>Bandwidth has held up pretty well,</p>
<p>and all of our email and other tools</p>
<p>have just scaled up kind of gracefully.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been a plus.</p>
<p>Economists call this question</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;ll go back a hysteresis.</p>
<p>The question is like when you boil an egg</p>
<p>after it gets cold again, it stays hard.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re gonna have a fair amount</p>
<p>of hysteresis in the economy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna move to this new,</p>
<p>we have moved to a new remote work system,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna snap all the way back</p>
<p>to where it was before.</p>
<p>One of the things that worries me is that the people</p>
<p>with lots of followers on Twitter and people with voices,</p>
<p>people that can, voices that can be magnified by reporters</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff are the people</p>
<p>that fall into this category</p>
<p>that we were referring to just now</p>
<p>where they can still function</p>
<p>and be successful with remote work.</p>
<p>And then there is a kind of quiet suffering</p>
<p>of what feels like millions of people</p>
<p>whose jobs are disturbed profoundly by this pandemic,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have many followers on Twitter.</p>
<p>What do we, and again, I apologize,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been reading the rise and fall of the Third Reich</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a connection to the depression</p>
<p>on the American side.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep, complicated connection</p>
<p>to how suffering can turn into forces</p>
<p>that potentially change the world in destructive ways.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s something I worry about is like,</p>
<p>what is this suffering going to materialize itself</p>
<p>in five, 10 years?</p>
<p>Is that something you worry about, think about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the center of what I worry about.</p>
<p>And let me break it down to two parts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moral and ethical aspect to it.</p>
<p>We need to relieve this suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure the values of, I think most Americans,</p>
<p>we like to see shared prosperity</p>
<p>or most people on the planet.</p>
<p>And we would like to see people not falling behind</p>
<p>and they have fallen behind, not just due to COVID,</p>
<p>but in the previous couple of decades,</p>
<p>median income has barely moved,</p>
<p>depending on how you measure it.</p>
<p>And the incomes of the top 1% have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>And part of that is due to the ways technology has been used.</p>
<p>Part of this been due to, frankly, our political system</p>
<p>has continually shifted more wealth into those people</p>
<p>who have the powerful interest.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just, I think, a moral imperative</p>
<p>to do a better job.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we&rsquo;re all gonna be wealthier</p>
<p>if more people can contribute,</p>
<p>more people have the wherewithal.</p>
<p>But the second thing is that there&rsquo;s a real political risk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a political scientist,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to be one, I think,</p>
<p>to see how a lot of people are really upset</p>
<p>with they&rsquo;re getting a raw deal</p>
<p>and they want to smash the system in different ways,</p>
<p>in 2016 and 2018.</p>
<p>And now I think there are a lot of people</p>
<p>who are looking at the political system</p>
<p>and they feel like it&rsquo;s not working for them</p>
<p>and they just wanna do something radical.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, demagogues have harnessed that</p>
<p>in a way that is pretty destructive to the country.</p>
<p>And an analogy I see is what happened with trade.</p>
<p>Almost every economist thinks that free trade</p>
<p>is a good thing, that when two people voluntarily exchange</p>
<p>almost by definition, they&rsquo;re both better off</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s voluntary.</p>
<p>And so generally, trade is a good thing.</p>
<p>But they also recognize that trade can lead</p>
<p>to uneven effects, that there can be winners and losers</p>
<p>in some of the people who didn&rsquo;t have the skills</p>
<p>to compete with somebody else or didn&rsquo;t have other assets.</p>
<p>And so trade can shift prices</p>
<p>in ways that are averse to some people.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a formula that economists have,</p>
<p>which is that you have free trade,</p>
<p>but then you compensate the people who are hurt</p>
<p>and free trade makes the pie bigger.</p>
<p>And since the pie is bigger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible for everyone to be better off.</p>
<p>You can make the winners better off,</p>
<p>but you can also compensate those who don&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>And so they end up being better off as well.</p>
<p>What happened was that we didn&rsquo;t fulfill that promise.</p>
<p>We did have some more increased free trade</p>
<p>in the 80s and 90s, but we didn&rsquo;t compensate the people</p>
<p>who were hurt.</p>
<p>And so they felt like the people in power</p>
<p>reneged on the bargain, and I think they did.</p>
<p>And so then there&rsquo;s a backlash against trade.</p>
<p>And now both political parties,</p>
<p>but especially Trump and company,</p>
<p>have really pushed back against free trade.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that&rsquo;s bad for the country.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that&rsquo;s bad for living standards.</p>
<p>But in a way I can understand</p>
<p>that people felt they were betrayed.</p>
<p>Technology has a lot of similar characteristics.</p>
<p>Technology can make us all better off.</p>
<p>It makes the pie bigger.</p>
<p>It creates wealth and health, but it can also be uneven.</p>
<p>Not everyone automatically benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible for some people,</p>
<p>even a majority of people to get left behind</p>
<p>while a small group benefits.</p>
<p>What most economists would say,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s make the pie bigger,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s make sure we adjust the system</p>
<p>so we compensate the people who are hurt.</p>
<p>And since the pie is bigger,</p>
<p>we can make the rich richer,</p>
<p>we can make the middle class richer,</p>
<p>we can make the poor richer.</p>
<p>Mathematically, everyone could be better off.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>And again, people are saying this isn&rsquo;t working for us.</p>
<p>And again, instead of fixing the distribution,</p>
<p>a lot of people are beginning to say,</p>
<p>hey, technology sucks, we&rsquo;ve got to stop it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s throw rocks at the Google bus.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s blow it up.</p>
<p>And there were the Luddites almost exactly 200 years ago</p>
<p>who smashed the looms and the spinning machines</p>
<p>because they felt like those machines weren&rsquo;t helping them.</p>
<p>We have a real imperative,</p>
<p>not just to do the morally right thing,</p>
<p>but to do the thing that is gonna save the country,</p>
<p>which is make sure that we create</p>
<p>not just prosperity, but shared prosperity.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been at MIT for over 30 years, I think.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell anyone how old I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re now moved to Stanford.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try not to say anything</p>
<p>about how great MIT is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that move been like?</p>
<p>What, it&rsquo;s East Coast to West Coast?</p>
<p>Well, MIT is great.</p>
<p>MIT has been very good to me.</p>
<p>It continues to be very good to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing place.</p>
<p>I continue to have so many amazing friends</p>
<p>and colleagues there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate to have been able</p>
<p>to spend a lot of time at MIT.</p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s also amazing.</p>
<p>And part of what attracted me out here</p>
<p>was not just the weather, but also Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it, is really more of the epicenter</p>
<p>of the technological revolution.</p>
<p>And I wanna be close to the people</p>
<p>who are inventing AI and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A lot of it is being invested at MIT for that matter</p>
<p>in Europe and China and elsewhere, in Nia.</p>
<p>But being a little closer to some of the key technologists</p>
<p>was something that was important to me.</p>
<p>And it may be shallow,</p>
<p>but I also do enjoy the good weather.</p>
<p>And I felt a little ripped off</p>
<p>when I came here a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>And immediately there are the fires</p>
<p>and my eyes were burning, the sky was orange</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the heat waves.</p>
<p>And so it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I&rsquo;ve been promised,</p>
<p>but fingers crossed it&rsquo;ll get back to better.</p>
<p>But maybe on a brief aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some criticism of academia</p>
<p>and universities and different avenues.</p>
<p>And I, as a person who&rsquo;s gotten to enjoy universities</p>
<p>from the pure playground of ideas that it can be,</p>
<p>always kind of try to find the words</p>
<p>to tell people that these are magical places.</p>
<p>Is there something that you can speak to</p>
<p>that is beautiful or powerful about universities?</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, first off, I mean,</p>
<p>economists have this concept called revealed preference.</p>
<p>You can ask people what they say</p>
<p>or you can watch what they do.</p>
<p>And so obviously by reveal preferences, I love academia.</p>
<p>I could be doing lots of other things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I enjoy a lot.</p>
<p>And I think the word magical is exactly right.</p>
<p>At least it is for me.</p>
<p>I do what I love, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully my Dean won&rsquo;t be listening,</p>
<p>but I would do this for free.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just what I like to do.</p>
<p>I like to do research.</p>
<p>I love to have conversations like this with you</p>
<p>and with my students, with my fellow colleagues.</p>
<p>I love being around the smartest people I can find</p>
<p>and learning something from them</p>
<p>and having them challenge me.</p>
<p>And that just gives me joy.</p>
<p>And every day I find something new and exciting to work on.</p>
<p>And a university environment is really filled</p>
<p>with other people who feel that way.</p>
<p>And so I feel very fortunate to be part of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m lucky that I&rsquo;m in a society</p>
<p>where I can actually get paid for it</p>
<p>and put food on the table</p>
<p>while doing the stuff that I really love.</p>
<p>And I hope someday everybody can have jobs</p>
<p>that are like that.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that it&rsquo;s not necessarily easy</p>
<p>for everybody to have a job that they both love</p>
<p>and also they get paid for.</p>
<p>So there are things that don&rsquo;t go well in academia,</p>
<p>but by and large, I think it&rsquo;s a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>kinder, gentler version of a lot of the world.</p>
<p>You know, we sort of cut each other a little slack</p>
<p>on things like, you know, on just a lot of things.</p>
<p>You know, of course there&rsquo;s harsh debates</p>
<p>and discussions about things</p>
<p>and some petty politics here and there.</p>
<p>I personally, I try to stay away</p>
<p>from most of that sort of politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my thing.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t affect me most of the time,</p>
<p>sometimes a little bit, maybe.</p>
<p>But, you know, being able to pull together something,</p>
<p>we have the digital economy lab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all these brilliant grad students</p>
<p>and undergraduates and postdocs</p>
<p>that are just doing stuff that I learned from.</p>
<p>And every one of them has some aspect</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like way, way more brilliant.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, to me, actually I really enjoy that,</p>
<p>being in a room with lots of other smart people.</p>
<p>And Stanford has made it very easy to attract,</p>
<p>you know, those people.</p>
<p>I just, you know, say I&rsquo;m gonna do a seminar, whatever,</p>
<p>and the people come, they come and wanna work with me.</p>
<p>We get funding, we get data sets,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s come together real nicely.</p>
<p>And the rest is just fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun, yeah.</p>
<p>And we feel like we&rsquo;re working on important problems,</p>
<p>you know, and we&rsquo;re doing things that, you know,</p>
<p>I think are first order in terms of what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in the world, and that&rsquo;s very satisfying to me.</p>
<p>Maybe a bit of a fun question.</p>
<p>What three books, technical, fiction, philosophical,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve enjoyed, had a big, big impact in your life?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I go back to like my teen years,</p>
<p>and, you know, I read Sid Arthur,</p>
<p>which is a philosophical book,</p>
<p>and kind of helps keep me centered.</p>
<p>By Herman Hesse.</p>
<p>Yeah, by Herman Hesse, exactly.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get too wrapped up in material things</p>
<p>or other things, and just sort of, you know,</p>
<p>try to find peace on things.</p>
<p>A book that actually influenced me a lot</p>
<p>in terms of my career was called</p>
<p>The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Halbrenner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually about economists.</p>
<p>It goes through a series of different,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s written in a very lively form,</p>
<p>and it probably sounds boring,</p>
<p>but it did describe whether it&rsquo;s Adam Smith</p>
<p>or Karl Marx or John Maynard Keynes,</p>
<p>and each of them sort of what their key insights were,</p>
<p>but also kind of their personalities,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>I became an economist was just understanding</p>
<p>how they grapple with the big questions of the world.</p>
<p>So would you recommend it as a good whirlwind overview</p>
<p>of the history of economics?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>It kind of takes you through the different things,</p>
<p>and so you can understand how they reach,</p>
<p>thinking some of the strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I mean, it probably is a little out of date now.</p>
<p>It needs to be updated a bit,</p>
<p>but you could at least look through</p>
<p>the first couple hundred years of economics,</p>
<p>which is not a bad place to start.</p>
<p>More recently, I mean, a book I really enjoyed</p>
<p>is by my friend and colleague, Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>called Life 3.0.</p>
<p>You should have him on your podcast if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>He was episode number one.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s back, he&rsquo;ll be back, he&rsquo;ll be back soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, he&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>I love the way his brain works,</p>
<p>and he makes you think about profound things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got such a joyful approach to life,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s been a great book,</p>
<p>and I learn a lot from it, I think everybody,</p>
<p>but he explains it in a way, even though he&rsquo;s so brilliant,</p>
<p>that everyone can understand, that I can understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s three, but let me mention maybe one or two others.</p>
<p>I mean, I recently read More From Less</p>
<p>by my sometimes coauthor, Andrew McAfee.</p>
<p>It made me optimistic about how we can continue</p>
<p>to have rising living standards</p>
<p>while living more lightly on the planet.</p>
<p>In fact, because of higher living standards,</p>
<p>because of technology,</p>
<p>because of digitization that I mentioned,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to have as big an impact on the planet,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a great story to tell,</p>
<p>and he documents it very carefully.</p>
<p>You know, a personal kind of self help book</p>
<p>that I found kind of useful, People, is Atomic Habits.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s his name, James Clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, James Clear.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, yeah, it&rsquo;s a good name,</p>
<p>because he writes very clearly,</p>
<p>and you know, most of the sentences I read in that book,</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, I know that,</p>
<p>but it just really helps to have somebody like remind you</p>
<p>and tell you and kind of just reinforce it, and it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>So build habits in your life that you hope to have,</p>
<p>that have a positive impact,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have to make it big things.</p>
<p>It could be just tiny little.</p>
<p>Exactly, I mean, the word atomic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a pun, I think he says.</p>
<p>You know, one, atomic means they&rsquo;re really small.</p>
<p>You take these little things, but also like atomic power,</p>
<p>can have like, you know, big impact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny, yeah.</p>
<p>The biggest ridiculous question,</p>
<p>especially to ask an economist, but also a human being,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve gotten the answer to that from somebody else.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all still working on that one, but what is it?</p>
<p>You know, I actually learned a lot from my son, Luke,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s 19 now, but he&rsquo;s always loved philosophy,</p>
<p>and he reads way more sophisticated philosophy than I do.</p>
<p>I went and took him to Oxford,</p>
<p>and he spent the whole time like pulling</p>
<p>all these obscure books down and reading them.</p>
<p>And a couple of years ago, we had this argument,</p>
<p>and he was trying to convince me that hedonism</p>
<p>was the ultimate, you know, meaning of life,</p>
<p>just pleasure seeking, and&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, how old was he at the time?</p>
<p>17, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But he made a really good like intellectual argument</p>
<p>for it too, and you know,</p>
<p>but you know, it just didn&rsquo;t strike me as right.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, while I am kind of a utilitarian,</p>
<p>like, you know, I do think we should do the grace,</p>
<p>good for the grace number, that&rsquo;s just too shallow.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that real happiness</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come from seeking pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a little, it&rsquo;s ironic.</p>
<p>Like if you really focus on being happy,</p>
<p>I think it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You gotta like be doing something bigger.</p>
<p>I think the analogy I sometimes use is, you know,</p>
<p>when you look at a dim star in the sky,</p>
<p>if you look right at it, it kind of disappears,</p>
<p>but you have to look a little to the side,</p>
<p>and then the parts of your retina</p>
<p>that are better at absorbing light,</p>
<p>you know, can pick it up better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with happiness.</p>
<p>I think you need to sort of find something, other goal,</p>
<p>something, some meaning in life,</p>
<p>and that ultimately makes you happier</p>
<p>than if you go squarely at just pleasure.</p>
<p>And so for me, you know, the kind of research I do</p>
<p>that I think is trying to change the world,</p>
<p>make the world a better place,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not like an evolutionary psychologist,</p>
<p>but my guess is that our brains are wired,</p>
<p>not just for pleasure, but we&rsquo;re social animals,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re wired to like help others.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really deeply rooted in our psyche.</p>
<p>And if we do help others, if we do,</p>
<p>or at least feel like we&rsquo;re helping others,</p>
<p>you know, our reward systems kick in,</p>
<p>and we end up being more deeply satisfied</p>
<p>than if we just do something selfish and shallow.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Eric.</p>
<p>You were one of the people when I first showed up at MIT,</p>
<p>that made me proud to be at MIT.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so sad that you&rsquo;re now at Stanford,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do wonderful things at Stanford as well.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till future books,</p>
<p>and people should definitely read your other books.</p>
<p>Well, thank you so much.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re all part of the invisible college,</p>
<p>as we call it.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re all part of this intellectual</p>
<p>and human community where we all can learn from each other.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter physically</p>
<p>where we are so much anymore.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
