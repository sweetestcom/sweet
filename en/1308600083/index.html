    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to be discussing bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>often called bipolar depression.</p>
<p>Bipolar depression is a condition</p>
<p>in which people undergo massive shifts in their energy,</p>
<p>their perception, and their mood.</p>
<p>However, it is very important to note</p>
<p>that the shifts in mood, energy, and perception</p>
<p>are all maladaptive.</p>
<p>They can often cause tremendous damage</p>
<p>to the person suffering from bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and tremendous damage to the people in their lives.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to parse the biology</p>
<p>that leads to these shifts in mood, energy, and perception,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about</p>
<p>the various treatments that exist.</p>
<p>Some of those treatments have been around</p>
<p>for a very long time,</p>
<p>and indeed, one of those treatments, lithium,</p>
<p>has an incredible backstory about its discovery,</p>
<p>and in understanding how lithium works</p>
<p>and some of the ways in which it does not work well,</p>
<p>it reveals a tremendous amount</p>
<p>about how the brain works normally in all individuals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a miraculous story</p>
<p>that I look forward to sharing with you.</p>
<p>As we go forward in this discussion about bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I want everyone to keep in mind</p>
<p>that it is a very severe condition.</p>
<p>In fact, people suffering from bipolar disorder</p>
<p>are at 20 to 30 times greater risk of suicide.</p>
<p>So today is a serious discussion,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly one in which people</p>
<p>who are suffering from manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or who know people that are suffering</p>
<p>from manic bipolar disorder can benefit from.</p>
<p>However, for those of you that might know people</p>
<p>or who themselves suffer from major depression,</p>
<p>we will also be talking about</p>
<p>important treatment developments for major depression.</p>
<p>Major depression is a very common thing for many people.</p>
<p>In fact, most people will suffer from depression</p>
<p>of some sort at some point in their life,</p>
<p>although not necessarily a major depressive episode,</p>
<p>and yet major depression is very common.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll soon learn up to 20% of people</p>
<p>will suffer from major depression.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion will encompass all of that,</p>
<p>and it will also encompass basic brain mechanisms</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience</p>
<p>both for good and for worse,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about the basic biology</p>
<p>of how the brain regulates mood, energy, and perception.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the discussion</p>
<p>about manic bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I want to highlight some recent findings</p>
<p>in an area totally separate from mental health</p>
<p>that I think are really important for everyone to know about.</p>
<p>This is a paper published in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is a cell press journal, an excellent journal.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the three apex journals.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are curious,</p>
<p>papers published in the journal Nature, Science, and Cell</p>
<p>are considered the sort of Super Bowl, Stanley Cup,</p>
<p>and NBA championships of publishing.</p>
<p>And this paper entitled</p>
<p>An Interorgan Neural Circuit for Appetite Suppression</p>
<p>illustrates a very important principle</p>
<p>that I think everyone should know about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the principle of so-called parallel pathways.</p>
<p>Parallel pathways, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>are pathways that could be neural pathways</p>
<p>or hormonal pathways or otherwise</p>
<p>that operate independently of one another</p>
<p>to accomplish a common goal.</p>
<p>And what this paper really shows</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a set of peptides in the body.</p>
<p>And the peptide that I&rsquo;m referring to today</p>
<p>is called GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide one,</p>
<p>and some related peptides.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about these on the podcast before</p>
<p>for two reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m a big proponent and consumer of yerba mate.</p>
<p>Yerba mate is a tea that can promote the release</p>
<p>of glucagon-like peptide one.</p>
<p>And there are also new prescription drugs</p>
<p>that are now hitting the market</p>
<p>and for which there are really impressive clinical trials</p>
<p>for diabetes and obesity</p>
<p>that are essentially glucagon-like peptide one stimulator.</p>
<p>So they stimulate the release of that,</p>
<p>or they are in fact a synthetic version</p>
<p>of glucagon-like peptide one.</p>
<p>What is glucagon-like peptide one?</p>
<p>It is a peptide, which is a small little protein</p>
<p>that can dramatically suppress appetite.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why these drugs are being explored</p>
<p>and are showing quite impressive results</p>
<p>for things like treatment of type two diabetes</p>
<p>and other forms of diabetes, as well as obesity.</p>
<p>So they lead to weight loss.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of the yerba mate stimulation</p>
<p>of glucagon-like peptide one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a much lower amount</p>
<p>of glucagon-like peptide one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released from drinking yerba mate</p>
<p>as opposed to say, taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1</p>
<p>or taking a drug that is GLP-1.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I should also point out</p>
<p>that yerba mate comes in a bunch of different forms.</p>
<p>There is some concern about certain smoky flavored forms</p>
<p>of yerba mate being carcinogenic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I avoid those forms of yerba mate.</p>
<p>But for me, yerba mate is one of the preferred sources</p>
<p>of caffeine for me.</p>
<p>I like the way it tastes.</p>
<p>It does provide that sort of caffeine kick</p>
<p>that I like to have early in the day for focus</p>
<p>and for work and for exercise.</p>
<p>And yet I actively avoid the smoked varieties</p>
<p>of yerba mate because of the potential carcinogenic effects</p>
<p>of the smoked varieties.</p>
<p>Glucagon-like peptide one, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>can suppress appetite.</p>
<p>But what this paper shows is it does that</p>
<p>by at least two mechanisms through parallel pathways.</p>
<p>What this paper shows is that glucagon-like peptide one</p>
<p>acts on receptors in the body</p>
<p>in a portion of the nervous system</p>
<p>called the enteric nervous system,</p>
<p>E-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system.</p>
<p>This is a component of your nervous system</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really have control over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s autonomic or automatic.</p>
<p>GLP-1 binds to what are called</p>
<p>intestinal fugal enteric neurons.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the name,</p>
<p>but those neurons do two things.</p>
<p>First of all, they cause some gut distention.</p>
<p>So they actually make you feel full.</p>
<p>This is incredible, right?</p>
<p>A peptide, not actual physical food,</p>
<p>but a peptide that stimulates neurons</p>
<p>that cause changes in the so-called mechanoreceptors</p>
<p>of the gut of the enteric nervous system</p>
<p>and make people feel full.</p>
<p>So it can lead to actually mild,</p>
<p>or I suppose if levels of GLP-1 are very high,</p>
<p>to major gut distention, okay?</p>
<p>I think that the levels of GLP-1</p>
<p>that would come from drinking yerba mate</p>
<p>and hopefully from appropriate dosaging</p>
<p>of the synthetic forms of GLP-1</p>
<p>or drugs that stimulate GLP-1</p>
<p>would cause mild, not major gut distention</p>
<p>because major gut distention would be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut</p>
<p>to increase gut distention</p>
<p>and by way of a pathway that goes from the gut</p>
<p>up to the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>this little cluster of neurons</p>
<p>about the size of a marble</p>
<p>that sits above the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms.</p>
<p>So this is really beautiful, right?</p>
<p>You have a peptide, a small little protein</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released in the gut</p>
<p>and that release within the gut causes gut distention,</p>
<p>which makes you feel full.</p>
<p>And by way of neural stimulation of the hypothalamus</p>
<p>also activates neural pathways within the brain</p>
<p>that trigger satiety,</p>
<p>the feeling of having had enough food.</p>
<p>So to me, GLP-1 is both impressive and important.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this recent category of drugs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now hitting the market seems to adjust obesity</p>
<p>or can help people with weight loss</p>
<p>in order to help their health.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s doing so by at least two mechanisms.</p>
<p>One is within the brain</p>
<p>and the other is within the gut and communication</p>
<p>through the so-called gut-brain access.</p>
<p>Because again, these enteric neurons</p>
<p>are communicating to the brain, the hypothalamus</p>
<p>by way of this, what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the sympathogastro spinal reticular hypothalamic pathway.</p>
<p>You absolutely do not need to know all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough to make your mouth feel distended.</p>
<p>But at the same time, things like yerba mate,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure there are other compounds out there as well,</p>
<p>but certainly yerba mate can stimulate the release of GLP-1.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are looking</p>
<p>for some mild appetite suppression</p>
<p>and want to accomplish that while also ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>yerba mate might be a good option for that.</p>
<p>And just know that it&rsquo;s operating through two mechanisms,</p>
<p>on the body through mild gut distention</p>
<p>to make you feel full and on the brain to increase satiety</p>
<p>or make you feel less hungry.</p>
<p>And then for everybody,</p>
<p>not just those that are interested in appetite suppression,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that these parallel pathways are fundamental</p>
<p>to how we are organized.</p>
<p>Another good example of this would be</p>
<p>when we are excited by something positive or negative,</p>
<p>so it could be stressful or we&rsquo;re positively aroused,</p>
<p>there is a parallel activation of epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline, both from your adrenals</p>
<p>and from an area in the brain called the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>So again and again, we see this in biology</p>
<p>and in neuroscience, that your brain and your body</p>
<p>are acting in concert.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re acting together through mechanisms</p>
<p>that either are independent,</p>
<p>so separately in the brain and separately in the body,</p>
<p>but directed towards a common goal</p>
<p>or through communication between brain and body</p>
<p>and almost always that communication</p>
<p>is going to be bi-directional,</p>
<p>body to brain and brain to body.</p>
<p>So I think these results are really interesting</p>
<p>and really important for sake of weight loss,</p>
<p>for sake of appetite suppression,</p>
<p>and just generally for the way that they illustrate</p>
<p>this very important theme of the way that we are constructed</p>
<p>at a biological level, which is parallel pathways.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to refer to bipolar disorder</p>
<p>interchangeably with bipolar depression.</p>
<p>Although, as you will soon learn,</p>
<p>not everyone with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>necessarily goes through highs and lows.</p>
<p>There is a subset of people who suffer from bipolar disorder</p>
<p>who experienced the manic phases,</p>
<p>the highly elevated mood and energy,</p>
<p>and then drop down to so-called baseline.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t necessarily go down into a depressive state.</p>
<p>They often will return to a somewhat normal state.</p>
<p>In fact, we will talk about the percentage of time</p>
<p>that people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>tend to be symptom-free, manic, or depressed</p>
<p>in the context of the different categories</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>But as we wade into this topic that is bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I just want to give you a little bit</p>
<p>of the background statistics to anchor us</p>
<p>in just how serious and prevalent bipolar disorder is.</p>
<p>So bipolar disorder impacts about 1% of people.</p>
<p>That might seem like a small percentage.</p>
<p>If you think about a room of a hundred people,</p>
<p>that means that at least one of them</p>
<p>is very likely to have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier in the introduction,</p>
<p>bipolar disorder is very serious.</p>
<p>It has a 20 to 30% greater incidence of suicide</p>
<p>than the general population,</p>
<p>which is, first of all,</p>
<p>extremely tragic and extremely concerning.</p>
<p>So anyone that thinks they might have bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or who knows someone with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>should be especially vigilant about this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the signs and risk factors,</p>
<p>age of onset, et cetera, as we move forward.</p>
<p>So 1% of people have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The typical age of onset is anywhere from 20 to 25 years old,</p>
<p>although it can be much earlier.</p>
<p>And the earlier the onset of a bipolar episode,</p>
<p>which we will define in a few minutes,</p>
<p>the earlier the onset of that episode,</p>
<p>the higher likelihood that the bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is going to be a stable feature</p>
<p>of that person&rsquo;s psychology going forward.</p>
<p>And yet, I also want to point out</p>
<p>that there are some very good treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that those people could still benefit from.</p>
<p>There are basically two kinds of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>referred to as bipolar I and bipolar II.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just talk about bipolar I first.</p>
<p>Bipolar I is characterized</p>
<p>by a fairly extended period of mania.</p>
<p>What is mania?</p>
<p>Mania is a period of very elevated mood,</p>
<p>energy, distractibility, impulsivity,</p>
<p>and some other symptomology</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about going forward.</p>
<p>But this manic episode is extreme.</p>
<p>This is a condition in which the energy lift,</p>
<p>the mood lift, and the sort of impulsivity</p>
<p>and actions and words of the person</p>
<p>suffering from manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>are very noticeable and very extreme.</p>
<p>Now, a key thing, however,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not always noticeable</p>
<p>to the person suffering from it</p>
<p>that they are in this mode.</p>
<p>Sometimes they recognize that, sometimes they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always highly recognizable to other people</p>
<p>that the person suffering from manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is not like other people.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about bipolar I in a little bit more depth.</p>
<p>One of the key clinical criteria</p>
<p>or diagnostic criteria for bipolar I</p>
<p>is that a person suffer from these manic episodes</p>
<p>or display these manic episodes for seven days or more.</p>
<p>That turns out to be very key.</p>
<p>The stability of that manic episode for seven days or more</p>
<p>turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>And for those seven days,</p>
<p>the person is in an elevated mood, expansive thought,</p>
<p>all day, every day for those seven days.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why somebody could be in a manic mode.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that somebody has bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>In fact, someone could be in a manic mode</p>
<p>for seven days or more</p>
<p>and still not be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, there are other things</p>
<p>that can create manic episodes,</p>
<p>things like traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>things like seizure,</p>
<p>things like various prescription drugs or illicit drugs,</p>
<p>things like amphetamine and cocaine.</p>
<p>That is not the same as bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>even though from a symptomology perspective,</p>
<p>they might look even identical.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about these symptoms</p>
<p>and the diagnostic criteria</p>
<p>that a psychiatrist would use</p>
<p>in order to ask whether or not someone is manic</p>
<p>because they have manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or whether or not that person is manic</p>
<p>for some other reason,</p>
<p>such as traumatic brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera.</p>
<p>So typically a person will be brought into a clinic</p>
<p>or a person would bring themselves to a clinic</p>
<p>or meet with a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>It seems more likely</p>
<p>that they would be directed toward a psychiatrist</p>
<p>because oftentimes people who are in a manic episode</p>
<p>just simply won&rsquo;t have the perspective</p>
<p>or the foresight to bring themselves into the clinic.</p>
<p>And the psychiatrist is going to start to evaluate</p>
<p>for a couple of different things.</p>
<p>But first of all,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to try and figure out</p>
<p>is whether or not the person has at least three</p>
<p>of the following symptoms.</p>
<p>The first symptom is distractibility.</p>
<p>Is the person distractible?</p>
<p>Are they going from one thing to the next?</p>
<p>People who are in a manic episode</p>
<p>will be talking about a pen</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll be talking about, you know,</p>
<p>something they saw the other day</p>
<p>and then something they want to purchase</p>
<p>and then a place they&rsquo;re going to travel to, et cetera.</p>
<p>But they are also very prone to any stimulus within the room</p>
<p>meaning, you know, a bell could go off</p>
<p>or there could be a sound out in the hallway</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll orient to that.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll orient to the clinician</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll orient to something in their pocket.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all over the place.</p>
<p>You could think of this a little bit like ADHD</p>
<p>or attention deficit disorder, but it&rsquo;s very extreme.</p>
<p>So highly distractible, highly impulsive.</p>
<p>Impulsivity relates to actions.</p>
<p>So the person might be fidgeting with something</p>
<p>and then they might try and leave the room</p>
<p>or the person might, if they were out in the real world,</p>
<p>somebody might notice that the person is going</p>
<p>and purchasing, you know, multiples of something</p>
<p>that would be unusual for someone to purchase.</p>
<p>So for instance, I happen to know someone</p>
<p>whose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and their ex-spouse went out</p>
<p>and bought 10 plus air fryers, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think unless you&rsquo;re a restaurant</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s using a lot of air fryers,</p>
<p>the idea that you would need more than one or two air fryers</p>
<p>might just seem a little bit out of the norm.</p>
<p>And so that impulsivity can be at purchasing.</p>
<p>It can be other things as well.</p>
<p>It could be booking, you know,</p>
<p>12 international trips in one afternoon</p>
<p>or going and buying three cars, et cetera.</p>
<p>So impulsivity.</p>
<p>The other is grandiosity.</p>
<p>People who have manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>who are in a manic episode will often display words of</p>
<p>or actions of grandiosity.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, these are not lies in the sense</p>
<p>that the person isn&rsquo;t lying</p>
<p>in order to try and pull one over on anybody.</p>
<p>These are actual beliefs that the person comes to have</p>
<p>about their grandiose position in the world</p>
<p>or grandiose opportunities or potential in the world.</p>
<p>Typical forms of grandiosity in manic episodes</p>
<p>would be that the person suddenly decides</p>
<p>that they are going to win a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>They are the person selected to win a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to write a novel that afternoon</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to win a Pulitzer Prize that year,</p>
<p>which is more or less a delusion of grandeur, right?</p>
<p>The idea that someone could do that in one afternoon,</p>
<p>I suppose it is possible in the realm of all possibilities,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Other forms of grandiosity that often present themselves</p>
<p>in people suffering from a manic episode</p>
<p>will be that they&rsquo;re going to run for president</p>
<p>or that they are the person that they believe is selected</p>
<p>by the citizens of a given country</p>
<p>or by the universe to be the president of that country</p>
<p>or to be president of the universe, right?</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous,</p>
<p>but those sorts of delusions of grandiosity</p>
<p>are one condition that often presents itself</p>
<p>or one set of symptoms that presents itself.</p>
<p>Flight of ideas are also typical of manic episodes.</p>
<p>So this is a little bit like distractibility,</p>
<p>but this would be people talking extensively</p>
<p>about one thing and then switching</p>
<p>and talking extensively about something else.</p>
<p>It would be as if I was doing this podcast</p>
<p>talking about manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and then suddenly switching to OCD</p>
<p>and then to deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and then to the role of sugar</p>
<p>and its impact on the brain, et cetera.</p>
<p>So essentially a random selection</p>
<p>of the different topics that exist in science,</p>
<p>all of which I happen to be very interested in</p>
<p>and curious about,</p>
<p>but just as we have episodes of the podcast</p>
<p>that are about one or two topics</p>
<p>and we focus on those</p>
<p>in a fairly narrow trench of discussion,</p>
<p>somebody who has a flight of ideas</p>
<p>would be jumping between categories and topics</p>
<p>in a kind of pseudo random way.</p>
<p>So they might take off down a path of one thing</p>
<p>and then switch to another without any transition</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have any logical structure to them.</p>
<p>The other aspect of manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that often presents itself in the manic episodes</p>
<p>are agitation.</p>
<p>People feeling extremely physically agitated,</p>
<p>so a lot of shaking and moving about.</p>
<p>This can venture into the realm of paranoia,</p>
<p>but a lot of agitation,</p>
<p>a difficulty sitting down and being still,</p>
<p>a difficulty in just looking, feeling and acting calm.</p>
<p>And then another condition is no sleep.</p>
<p>And when I say no sleep,</p>
<p>I mean no sleep or very minimal sleep.</p>
<p>As incredible as it sounds,</p>
<p>people who are in a manic episode</p>
<p>can often go seven days or more with zero sleep.</p>
<p>And a key feature of this zero sleep</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re not troubled by it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking, oh, I&rsquo;m suffering from insomnia</p>
<p>and I really, really want to sleep.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s the case, but more often than not,</p>
<p>they are simply not sleeping.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re staying up 24 hours, then another 24 hours.</p>
<p>It just continues for an entire week.</p>
<p>Again, inconceivable to those of us</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t suffer from manic episodes.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how pulled apart</p>
<p>most of us would feel under those conditions.</p>
<p>And yet they are just going and going and going</p>
<p>with no sleep up all hours,</p>
<p>shopping, talking, running,</p>
<p>doing all sorts of different things</p>
<p>in the categories of other symptoms</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t bother them that they&rsquo;re not sleeping.</p>
<p>And then the last sort of category of symptoms</p>
<p>that the psychiatrist is evaluating for</p>
<p>and seeing if they present is rapid pressured speech.</p>
<p>The rapid pressured speech is something</p>
<p>that when you hear it, you recognize it.</p>
<p>This is somebody that almost seems to be hitting you</p>
<p>a speech like machine gun fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming at you, coming at you, coming at you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s really no room for conversation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not offering any opportunity for a back and forth.</p>
<p>Or if there is a back and forth,</p>
<p>they might ask you how you feel about something.</p>
<p>And then you started, well, then they&rsquo;re going to hit you</p>
<p>with another barrage or a paragraph of information</p>
<p>or of just speech that&rsquo;s pseudo random.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity,</p>
<p>flight of ideas, agitation, no sleep,</p>
<p>and rapid pressured speech.</p>
<p>For someone to be diagnosed as in a manic episode,</p>
<p>they do not have to be engaging in</p>
<p>or displaying all of those symptoms.</p>
<p>They do, however, need to present</p>
<p>at least three of those symptoms.</p>
<p>And then in order to meet the condition of bipolar one,</p>
<p>they have to be presenting those three symptoms</p>
<p>for at least seven days.</p>
<p>It could be longer, but at least seven days.</p>
<p>Now, this seems pretty straightforward, right?</p>
<p>At one level, the way that I described this</p>
<p>and the way that it exists in the clinical literature,</p>
<p>you could think, well,</p>
<p>this should be pretty easy to diagnose.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s a complication there or a challenge there</p>
<p>because the psychiatrist, again, has to determine</p>
<p>that these manic episodes are not due to something other</p>
<p>than bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>For instance, again, it could be TBI,</p>
<p>traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>It could be seizures or meds or other sorts of drugs.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids, which are often prescribed</p>
<p>for a number of immune conditions or for wound healing,</p>
<p>can also cause manic episodes.</p>
<p>So they have to determine that everything that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>meets the criteria I described before,</p>
<p>three out of seven of these symptom categories</p>
<p>for seven days or more,</p>
<p>and that it can&rsquo;t be better explained</p>
<p>by something else going on in that person&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>or immediate medical history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Now, the other challenge,</p>
<p>and this is something that&rsquo;s going to come up again</p>
<p>and again today, not just in the description of the biology</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but also in the description of different treatments</p>
<p>and treatment approaches,</p>
<p>is that typically when somebody is sitting in front</p>
<p>of a psychiatrist, in particular for the first time,</p>
<p>those two people are interacting,</p>
<p>the psychiatrist is just getting one snapshot</p>
<p>of the person at that moment, right?</p>
<p>So the person could be on day one of a manic episode.</p>
<p>The person might be on day six of a manic episode.</p>
<p>The person could be transitioning out of a manic episode,</p>
<p>or the person could be suffering from a combination</p>
<p>of manic episode where,</p>
<p>because of the impulsivity of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>they went out and used illicit drugs.</p>
<p>They also used cocaine.</p>
<p>So the psychiatrist has a serious challenge.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist has to determine</p>
<p>based on a conversation, right?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a blood test.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a measurement that you can take on a scale</p>
<p>or with a biomarker.</p>
<p>They have to use language,</p>
<p>a conversation with somebody who by all accounts</p>
<p>is pretty impaired at conversation to determine</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re suffering from a manic episode</p>
<p>that is the consequence of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>You can imagine this in the real world as somebody says,</p>
<p>well, how long has it been since you slept?</p>
<p>And the person starts to answer,</p>
<p>oh, well, the other day I went down to the basement.</p>
<p>I was going to get something out of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>I thought I might take a nap.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden they&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>completely different.</p>
<p>So they might not even have an answer.</p>
<p>So the psychiatrist has to be a really good detective,</p>
<p>a benevolent detective, but a detective nonetheless,</p>
<p>in determining whether or not these symptoms have existed</p>
<p>for seven days or more and whether or not they meet</p>
<p>the at least three, it could be more,</p>
<p>but at least three of the criteria of symptom categories</p>
<p>I talked about before.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that they do,</p>
<p>assuming that the patient meets those criteria,</p>
<p>they are likely to be diagnosed with bipolar one.</p>
<p>Now, bipolar one disorder means they&rsquo;re having these</p>
<p>extended manic episodes, seven days or more,</p>
<p>but it does not necessarily mean that they are dropping</p>
<p>into a depressive episode as well.</p>
<p>This is a common misconception about bipolar disorder</p>
<p>because as it&rsquo;s often called,</p>
<p>bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar depression.</p>
<p>And yet many people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily experience the deep depressive episodes.</p>
<p>Many of them do, but many of them do not.</p>
<p>So somebody can truly be diagnosed accurately</p>
<p>with bipolar one,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re only experiencing manic episodes</p>
<p>and then dropping down to baseline,</p>
<p>manic episode, then dropping down to baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important to understand.</p>
<p>Now, the second category of bipolar disorder is bipolar two.</p>
<p>So BP two or bipolar disorder two is somewhat different</p>
<p>than bipolar disorder one.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s characterized most often</p>
<p>by the presence of both manic episodes,</p>
<p>mania and depressive episodes,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s referred to as hypomania.</p>
<p>Now, anytime in biology or in medicine, you hear hypo,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the opposite of hyper, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got normal hyper and hypo.</p>
<p>Hypomania is a somewhat suppressed level of mania.</p>
<p>So this is not going to be as extreme as the mania</p>
<p>that we typically think of.</p>
<p>And yet the hypo can be due to the duration,</p>
<p>not the intensity of mania.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Hypomania can mean a lessened intensity of mania,</p>
<p>but it can also be used to refer</p>
<p>to a shorter duration of mania.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s one of the key criteria for bipolar two.</p>
<p>Bipolar two is often diagnosed on the basis</p>
<p>of the presence of manic episodes</p>
<p>that are lasting four days or even less.</p>
<p>So someone with BP two might have four days</p>
<p>of this increased energy, goal-directed activity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re irritable, they&rsquo;re euphoric,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sleeping, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only lasting for about four days.</p>
<p>Or they could be having longer extended periods of mania,</p>
<p>but they are hypomanic episodes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not quite as intense.</p>
<p>So the pressured speech isn&rsquo;t quite as pressured.</p>
<p>The impulsivity isn&rsquo;t quite as severe, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The other aspect of bipolar two</p>
<p>is one that I had mentioned briefly a moment ago,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s often associated</p>
<p>with the drops into the depressive episodes.</p>
<p>So people are going from manic episodes</p>
<p>for four days or less,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re dropping into a depression,</p>
<p>going back to normal, manic again.</p>
<p>I do want to point out, however,</p>
<p>that people who have bipolar one</p>
<p>can indeed go from manic episodes</p>
<p>to severe what we call major depression.</p>
<p>So they can oscillate like a sine wave,</p>
<p>really high highs, really low lows.</p>
<p>And very important to understand</p>
<p>in terms of understanding both bipolar one and bipolar two</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not always a sine wave.</p>
<p>This is really important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that, frankly,</p>
<p>I did not know until I started researching this episode</p>
<p>and talking to some psychiatrists.</p>
<p>I should mention, I&rsquo;ve talked to several</p>
<p>board-certified psychiatrists</p>
<p>in preparation for this episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give some references to them.</p>
<p>And in fact, some of them are going to be coming</p>
<p>on the podcast as guests in the future</p>
<p>for more in-depth discussion about bipolar</p>
<p>and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>But all the psychiatrists I spoke to</p>
<p>confirmed what the other was saying,</p>
<p>which was that the way that bipolar disorder can present</p>
<p>can vary tremendously between individuals.</p>
<p>One person might go from very high highs</p>
<p>that last seven days or more to very low lows,</p>
<p>bouts of depression, major depression</p>
<p>that can last two weeks or more.</p>
<p>Other people are rapid cycling by way of three days manic,</p>
<p>three days normal, three days manic,</p>
<p>and then dropping into three days depression.</p>
<p>So you want to erase that picture in your mind</p>
<p>that manic bipolar disorder is this sine wave,</p>
<p>this cycling up and down between mania and depression.</p>
<p>It can take a lot of different forms.</p>
<p>And again, this is a serious challenge</p>
<p>for the psychiatrist to diagnose people</p>
<p>because of that fact that they&rsquo;re only getting a snapshot</p>
<p>of the person unless they&rsquo;ve known them for some time</p>
<p>and are working with them for some time.</p>
<p>But this is also especially important for those of you</p>
<p>that either have bipolar depression</p>
<p>or suspect that you might,</p>
<p>or that know someone with bipolar depression</p>
<p>or suspect somebody might have bipolar depression,</p>
<p>AKA bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re noticing that somebody is very manic</p>
<p>and then normal, well, that&rsquo;s a very different picture</p>
<p>than somebody who&rsquo;s going from very manic</p>
<p>to very deep bouts of depression.</p>
<p>The very manic to deep bouts of depression</p>
<p>is easier to recognize</p>
<p>because of the extremes of those highs and lows.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem somewhat obvious to all of you</p>
<p>as I describe it.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s very important as a, frankly,</p>
<p>a citizen of the planet who knows other human beings</p>
<p>to keep an eye out for these manic episodes.</p>
<p>Because again, whether or not it&rsquo;s four days or less</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s seven days or more,</p>
<p>these manic episodes really are the defining criteria</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar depression.</p>
<p>There are a couple other key features</p>
<p>about bipolar I and bipolar II</p>
<p>that can allow us to get better insight</p>
<p>into whether or not somebody has bipolar I or bipolar II.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the percentage of time</p>
<p>that people with bipolar I versus bipolar II</p>
<p>spend in a manic state, a depressed state,</p>
<p>or a symptom-free state.</p>
<p>And this is also important to discuss</p>
<p>because it turns out that people</p>
<p>with genuine diagnosed bipolar I or bipolar II</p>
<p>are often symptom-free,</p>
<p>which again can make it difficult</p>
<p>for us as people that know them</p>
<p>or for people that are treating people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>to identify whether or not somebody</p>
<p>is in a manic episode or a depressive episode</p>
<p>or whether or not they are headed into a manic</p>
<p>or depressive episode.</p>
<p>So the numbers on this have been studied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from a paper, actually two papers,</p>
<p>first author Judd, J-U-D-D et al,</p>
<p>published some years ago, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>but the data hold up really nicely over time.</p>
<p>These were both published</p>
<p>in Journal of American Medical Association Psychiatry,</p>
<p>so JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.</p>
<p>And basically people who have bipolar I on average</p>
<p>spend about 50%, it&rsquo;s actually 53% was the number</p>
<p>that was eventually converged upon,</p>
<p>but about 50% of their time is symptom-free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>Somebody who has genuine bipolar I disorder</p>
<p>can spend as much as half of their life symptom-free,</p>
<p>sleeping normally, speaking normally, et cetera.</p>
<p>About 32% of the time depressed.</p>
<p>And when we say depressed, we mean major depression.</p>
<p>So severe challenges with waking up</p>
<p>at two or three in the morning</p>
<p>and having trouble falling back asleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the defining characteristics of depression</p>
<p>or sleeping far too much,</p>
<p>having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning,</p>
<p>suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation</p>
<p>all the general symptoms of major depression,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about a little bit more later.</p>
<p>And in an upcoming episode</p>
<p>about major depression in particular,</p>
<p>and then about 15% of their time</p>
<p>in this kind of manic state or mixed manic state</p>
<p>where they are showing long,</p>
<p>again, seven days or more bouts of sleeplessness,</p>
<p>irritability, pressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.</p>
<p>Contrast that with people who have bipolar II disorder</p>
<p>who are spending about half of their time</p>
<p>in a depressed state.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>People with bipolar II disorder,</p>
<p>while not always displaying depressed states</p>
<p>or oscillations between mania or hypomania</p>
<p>and depressed states,</p>
<p>they tend to be in the depressed state more often.</p>
<p>And again, this is major depression.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a little bit of a low,</p>
<p>this is a serious depression of their nervous system,</p>
<p>their mood, and as we say, their affect,</p>
<p>their outlook on life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the key distinguishing features</p>
<p>of major depression is that people&rsquo;s outlook on life</p>
<p>becomes very diminished in the sense</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t see a future.</p>
<p>You ask them about, you know, how&rsquo;s work going?</p>
<p>How are relationships?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that they feel that that&rsquo;s going poorly.</p>
<p>They really feel as if there&rsquo;s no opportunity</p>
<p>for those things to improve.</p>
<p>Those people with bipolar II tend to be symptom-free</p>
<p>about 45% of the time.</p>
<p>Again, these are averages.</p>
<p>So about 45% of the time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a considerable amount of the time.</p>
<p>And they tend to be in these hypomanic states</p>
<p>only about four or 5% of the time.</p>
<p>Again, the criteria for BP2, bipolar II</p>
<p>is these four days or less of mania or hypomania,</p>
<p>but only 4% of the time or 5% of the time</p>
<p>is a small enough sliver of the pie</p>
<p>that is these people&rsquo;s existence</p>
<p>that you can imagine why it would be easy</p>
<p>for them or other people to overlook the fact</p>
<p>that they have bipolar disorder and not major depression.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>This is a person who, or I should say a collection of people</p>
<p>who are spending about half of their time depressed,</p>
<p>close to half, 45% of their time symptom-free,</p>
<p>and then about 5% of their time in a hypomanic state.</p>
<p>So either shortened bouts of a high intensity mania</p>
<p>or hypomania that is of reduced intensity.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I mentioned</p>
<p>these percentages of time spent in a symptom-free,</p>
<p>depressed, manic, or hypomanic state</p>
<p>is because one of my major goals for today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is that it will increase awareness</p>
<p>of whether or not you or somebody you know,</p>
<p>could be a coworker, could be a family member, et cetera,</p>
<p>might be suffering from bipolar I or bipolar II.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that if somebody is suffering</p>
<p>from bipolar I, that is likely to be revealed</p>
<p>or to reveal itself before too long</p>
<p>because of the fact that people have these extended periods</p>
<p>of mania and mania is such an extreme state,</p>
<p>not just for the person who&rsquo;s experiencing it,</p>
<p>but the way that it presents is just so extreme</p>
<p>and out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>But bipolar II, you can imagine,</p>
<p>could really duck under the radar of our awareness.</p>
<p>And you could imagine that we might just think</p>
<p>somebody is low or depressed,</p>
<p>especially if that person tends to self-medicate</p>
<p>with alcohol or other substances.</p>
<p>We might think, oh, well, they&rsquo;re drinking more than often,</p>
<p>more than usual, excuse me,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re spending more time alone and isolating.</p>
<p>But then when they&rsquo;re in their hypomanic state,</p>
<p>that might actually present as normal to us</p>
<p>because they were in such a depressed state before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important that we dial up our awareness,</p>
<p>that we can tune our antennae to the possibility</p>
<p>that people out there who might appear depressed</p>
<p>or that we haven&rsquo;t heard from in a while</p>
<p>might actually be suffering from bipolar II disorder.</p>
<p>Before we move into a in-depth discussion</p>
<p>about the different kinds of treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on just a few additional aspects</p>
<p>of what bipolar disorder can do</p>
<p>in terms of its negative consequences,</p>
<p>and also talk about some of the inherited risk,</p>
<p>that is the genetic factors and the environmental factors</p>
<p>that can contribute to bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>In terms of the burden,</p>
<p>the very real emotional and occupational</p>
<p>and educational burden that can occur</p>
<p>for somebody with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually been studied.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a measure of this, it&rsquo;s called global burden,</p>
<p>which is defined as the years lost</p>
<p>in engaging in normal life due to some disability.</p>
<p>So that disability could be cancer,</p>
<p>that disability in this case is bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And basically the way this sort of study is done</p>
<p>is that through questionnaires,</p>
<p>I should say quite in-depth questionnaires,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a probing for whether or not somebody</p>
<p>has lost two consecutive weeks or more</p>
<p>of interest in normal activities.</p>
<p>Now, for people who have depression,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a kind of straightforward thing to address, right?</p>
<p>You ask somebody, when was the last time you ate?</p>
<p>Or when was the last time</p>
<p>that you went a few days without food?</p>
<p>Or lost interest in relationships or work or sex</p>
<p>or things of that sort?</p>
<p>And they answer and you can figure out the amount of time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve essentially been withdrawn</p>
<p>from normal levels of activity for them.</p>
<p>With bipolar disorder, what it turns out</p>
<p>is that the global burden of having bipolar one</p>
<p>and even bipolar two is massive.</p>
<p>In fact, having bipolar disorder</p>
<p>sits as one of the highest risk factors</p>
<p>for being in the top 10 of all categories of disabilities</p>
<p>leading to global burden.</p>
<p>Put in plain English, what that means is having bipolar one</p>
<p>or bipolar two disorder is extremely debilitating.</p>
<p>It really slows down one&rsquo;s life trajectory</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s treated properly.</p>
<p>Now, the other aspect of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is its heritability.</p>
<p>And this gets into a little bit of some tricky science</p>
<p>related to inheritability versus the genetic contribution</p>
<p>of a given disease.</p>
<p>So that might sound like the same thing.</p>
<p>You think, okay, genes relate to heritability,</p>
<p>heritability relates to genes.</p>
<p>But of course, everything about the way</p>
<p>that our nervous system works and functions</p>
<p>and expresses itself, healthy or otherwise,</p>
<p>is an interaction between our genes and our environment.</p>
<p>And so typically the way these studies are done</p>
<p>is you address what is the risk</p>
<p>of somebody having a given condition</p>
<p>in the general population.</p>
<p>We talked about that before.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a 1% of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Compare that to people who have only major depression.</p>
<p>So this would be repeated bouts of two weeks</p>
<p>or more of serious depression, not just low mood</p>
<p>or something due to a life loss, but major depression,</p>
<p>which is 10 to 17% of people have major depression.</p>
<p>Okay, they suffer from major depressive disorder</p>
<p>compared to bipolar disorder, which again is 1%.</p>
<p>Now, you can address how much of the 1% of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that exists is due to genes versus environment</p>
<p>in a somewhat exact way.</p>
<p>This is never an exact science.</p>
<p>And the way that this is typically done</p>
<p>is to look at concordance, that is the likelihood</p>
<p>that two identical twins will both have a given condition</p>
<p>as opposed to two fraternal twins,</p>
<p>which have more different genes</p>
<p>than identical twins, of course,</p>
<p>and then two siblings who have similar genes, of course,</p>
<p>but less similar than identical or fraternal twins</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So what you basically do is you evaluate the probability</p>
<p>that two people in the general population</p>
<p>who are completely unrelated will have the same condition</p>
<p>versus two people in the general population</p>
<p>who are very related identical twins.</p>
<p>And what you find is that in identical twins,</p>
<p>if one identical twin has true major depression</p>
<p>or major depressive disorder, there&rsquo;s a 20 to 45% chance</p>
<p>that their identical twin</p>
<p>will also have major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>Now that tells you right there that it can&rsquo;t all be genes,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a gene for major depression per se,</p>
<p>or if it is a gene or a collection of genes,</p>
<p>that those genes are also subject</p>
<p>to environmental influences,</p>
<p>either prenatal within the womb or after children are born.</p>
<p>Now, the large range there of 20 to 45%</p>
<p>could be due to any number of things.</p>
<p>It could be experimental,</p>
<p>meaning the techniques that were used in experiments.</p>
<p>It could be due to regional differences, right?</p>
<p>One part of the world versus another.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different factors.</p>
<p>Right now, we probably shouldn&rsquo;t delve into all that.</p>
<p>At some point, we&rsquo;ll probably do an episode</p>
<p>all about the genetics of nervous system heritability</p>
<p>and heritability of features and mental health, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we can compare major depression and the heritability</p>
<p>or the genetic concordance between identical twins</p>
<p>in major depression and bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>and ask if one twin of an identical twin pair</p>
<p>has bipolar depression,</p>
<p>what is the likelihood that the other twin will have it?</p>
<p>And it turns out that number is much higher.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 40 to 70% likelihood or probability</p>
<p>that if one twin has bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>that their identical twin will also have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So again, the total incidence of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>in the general population is much lower</p>
<p>than it is for major depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1% for bipolar versus 10 to 17% for major depression.</p>
<p>But the genetic component is much higher,</p>
<p>40 to 70% for bipolar disorder versus 20 to 45%</p>
<p>for major depression.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m throwing a lot of numbers out there,</p>
<p>but basically what this means is that researchers</p>
<p>have been able to take those numbers and filter them</p>
<p>through a number of different risk factors</p>
<p>that are related to early development,</p>
<p>ask questions like if two twins were raised separately</p>
<p>or together in one part of the world versus another,</p>
<p>or had a two-parent household versus one-parent household,</p>
<p>you know, evaluate a lot of different variables.</p>
<p>What they were able to discover,</p>
<p>and this has been shown again and again,</p>
<p>is that the genetic contribution to bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is very, very high.</p>
<p>That is the heritability of bipolar disorder is 85%.</p>
<p>Okay, so again, I want to be really clear what this means.</p>
<p>The total occurrence in the general population, fairly low.</p>
<p>Still serious, 1%, but fairly low</p>
<p>compared to other things like major depression.</p>
<p>However, if someone has bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that they inherited some gene</p>
<p>or sets of genes, or more accurately,</p>
<p>a susceptibility within their genes</p>
<p>to environmental influences</p>
<p>that can trigger bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to discuss</p>
<p>and to conceptualize heritability,</p>
<p>so I want to be very careful</p>
<p>with the way that I&rsquo;m wording this.</p>
<p>What this means is that people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>very likely have a gene,</p>
<p>or more typically, it&rsquo;s going to be a set of genes</p>
<p>that creates a susceptibility for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>to present itself.</p>
<p>Now, what environmental factors trigger</p>
<p>or increase that susceptibility is not entirely clear.</p>
<p>This always seems to center back</p>
<p>onto the same sets of things like early life stress,</p>
<p>trauma, et cetera.</p>
<p>Certainly, those are going to exacerbate the likelihood</p>
<p>that someone who has a genetic propensity</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder will express that bipolar disorder</p>
<p>in its full array of symptomology,</p>
<p>but 85%, while very, very high, is not 100%.</p>
<p>Again, 85%, while a very high number for heritability,</p>
<p>is not 100%.</p>
<p>What that means is that there is no single gene</p>
<p>or identified gene cluster for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The reason I keep drilling into this over and over</p>
<p>is that I think we can confidently say</p>
<p>that if someone has bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>that there was something in their genetic lineage</p>
<p>that led to that, or that very likely led to that,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s not like eye color</p>
<p>or some other physical feature</p>
<p>which we can actually do the direct,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s called Mendelian genetics,</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not somebody directly inherited</p>
<p>that gene from one parent or the other parent.</p>
<p>So the takeaway here is that if you have,</p>
<p>certainly an identical twin or a fraternal twin</p>
<p>or a sibling or a parent, or even a cousin or an uncle</p>
<p>that has bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>in particular, bipolar I,</p>
<p>well, then you need to be on the lookout</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder, perhaps in yourself</p>
<p>and for the family members of that person.</p>
<p>My goal within this episode up until now</p>
<p>has been to provide a clear and detailed picture</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder and its various forms.</p>
<p>Before we start to talk about treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder and some of the neural circuit basis</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder, I want to make sure</p>
<p>that I distinguish bipolar disorder</p>
<p>from borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode or maybe even several episodes</p>
<p>about borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>Borderline personality disorder can indeed present itself</p>
<p>in ways that resemble bipolar disorder and vice versa,</p>
<p>but there are some key distinctions that need to be made</p>
<p>because it turns out that bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and borderline personality disorder are quite distinct</p>
<p>in terms of their defining criteria.</p>
<p>The key distinction between somebody</p>
<p>with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is that in borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>there can be episodes that can resemble mania or hypomania,</p>
<p>so periods of flights of ideas</p>
<p>or where people are spending money excessively</p>
<p>or are sexually promiscuous in ways that seem manic</p>
<p>or could even be a little bit manic or a lot manic,</p>
<p>and yet more often than not,</p>
<p>there is an environmental trigger for those manic episodes.</p>
<p>That is distinctly different from bipolar disorder</p>
<p>where the person will have manic episodes</p>
<p>without any need for a trigger.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t need to be a call from someone saying,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s go on a vacation together,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something coming up this Friday</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really exciting,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s enter a relationship together</p>
<p>of one form or another.</p>
<p>The person with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania</p>
<p>or episodes of major depression</p>
<p>without any need for an external stimulus</p>
<p>or environmental trigger,</p>
<p>but the person with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>almost always, again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never an always in biology and psychiatry,</p>
<p>but almost always is going to exhibit flights of mania</p>
<p>or depressive episodes or other types of mood shifts</p>
<p>that are dramatic and maladaptive</p>
<p>in response to things that are coming in</p>
<p>through the external environment</p>
<p>or relationships of some kind.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the defining characteristics</p>
<p>of borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>is this thing that&rsquo;s referred to as splitting.</p>
<p>A good example of splitting</p>
<p>in the person with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>is that they will feel that they absolutely adore you</p>
<p>and want to spend all their time with you</p>
<p>and just think the world of you.</p>
<p>You can do no wrong.</p>
<p>And in fact, they genuinely can feel that way</p>
<p>and can genuinely think that way about you.</p>
<p>And then for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it could be a perception of something that you did</p>
<p>or something that you said</p>
<p>or suspicion that you&rsquo;re thinking something about them,</p>
<p>they can suddenly shift or split their emotions</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s called move you from a good object</p>
<p>or a can do no wrong object to a bad object.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll suddenly decide that you are cheating on them</p>
<p>or that you are being mean to them</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re insulting them</p>
<p>or that something that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is in violation to their self-worth,</p>
<p>their wellbeing, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that can send them down a pathway</p>
<p>of being very angry, very depressed, et cetera.</p>
<p>As I described the contour of a person</p>
<p>with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>as somebody who splits very suddenly</p>
<p>in response to some environmental trigger,</p>
<p>real or perceived, there&rsquo;s the risk, of course,</p>
<p>that it makes the person</p>
<p>with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>sound like a bad person,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re very volatile.</p>
<p>And while they can be volatile,</p>
<p>I want to be very careful to point out</p>
<p>that the person with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>is also suffering in this context.</p>
<p>So while those sorts of relationships</p>
<p>with people with borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re romantic relationships</p>
<p>or familial or coworkers, et cetera,</p>
<p>can be very challenged, can be very high friction</p>
<p>because of the good object, bad object shifts, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bi-directional,</p>
<p>meaning the person with borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>as you can imagine,</p>
<p>is also going through a lot of suffering.</p>
<p>At one moment, they feel as if someone is wonderful</p>
<p>and can do no wrong to them</p>
<p>and they want to be so strongly affiliated with them.</p>
<p>And then in the next moment,</p>
<p>they feel as if that person is attacking them</p>
<p>through their actions or even through their non-actions.</p>
<p>So again, we will return to borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>in a separate episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serious disorder,</p>
<p>both for the person that has it and for people around them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some emerging treatments</p>
<p>that are showing promise,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fairly common disorder,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important that we distinguish</p>
<p>borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>mostly on the basis of this need for a trigger.</p>
<p>Again, in bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>there is no need for a trigger to create a manic episode</p>
<p>or a major depressive episode.</p>
<p>They just happen, or they can just happen.</p>
<p>Whereas in borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>almost always there&rsquo;s an external trigger</p>
<p>or a perception that something happened in the environment</p>
<p>or that somebody is behaving a certain way</p>
<p>that dramatically shifts the person</p>
<p>with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>from one mode to the next.</p>
<p>As we move into our discussion about the treatments</p>
<p>for and neural circuits underlying bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I want to just nail down one more key point.</p>
<p>This is a very brief point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s perhaps the most important point,</p>
<p>which is the highs and lows,</p>
<p>or we should say the highs, these manic episodes,</p>
<p>and sometimes lows,</p>
<p>because again, not everybody with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>one or two, suffers from depressive episodes.</p>
<p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>
<p>In particular in bipolar two, yes,</p>
<p>but people with bipolar one can have extreme manic episodes</p>
<p>and then just return to normal, as you recall.</p>
<p>Well, those extreme lows and or extreme highs</p>
<p>of people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>impact their lives in very negative ways.</p>
<p>This is essential.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re going to return to</p>
<p>a little bit later when we talk about the relationship</p>
<p>between bipolar disorder and creativity,</p>
<p>because it turns out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a quite strong association there,</p>
<p>one that would almost lead you to believe</p>
<p>that being bipolar can be beneficial in certain contexts.</p>
<p>And yet on whole,</p>
<p>having bipolar disorder is extremely detrimental</p>
<p>and challenging to the person suffering from it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that we want to keep in mind</p>
<p>as we think about treatments and the underlying biology.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And in the discussion of those treatments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an absolutely incredible history</p>
<p>of the discovery of one particular treatment</p>
<p>that still shows great success in many patients,</p>
<p>although some people can&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>for reasons that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>And in the description of the discovery</p>
<p>of this treatment for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>it also reveals to us that sometimes treatments</p>
<p>come to the profession of medicine and through science</p>
<p>in ways that precede the discovery</p>
<p>of the underlying biology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Every once in a while,</p>
<p>someone will discover a treatment for a disease</p>
<p>without any understanding</p>
<p>about the underlying biological basis of that disease.</p>
<p>And in fact, that is the case for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And the treatment that we are referring to is lithium.</p>
<p>Lithium, as some of you know,</p>
<p>is on the periodic table of elements.</p>
<p>It is indeed a naturally occurring substance.</p>
<p>It actually arrived on earth by way of stardust.</p>
<p>Yes, we are talking about stardust on this podcast.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the origins of lithium</p>
<p>and how lithium arrived here on earth for its discovery</p>
<p>and applications in psychiatry,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful talk that exists on YouTube</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll provide a link to this in the show note captions</p>
<p>that describes the history of lithium</p>
<p>in terms of its interplanetary travels</p>
<p>and arrival on earth.</p>
<p>This is a talk delivered by a physicist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s expert in quantum mechanics and is expert in lithium.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a just wonderful talk that I can refer you to.</p>
<p>Less on the biology in that talk,</p>
<p>but certainly a lot about lithium as an element.</p>
<p>So for those of you nerds like me</p>
<p>that love to know how things came to be here on the planet</p>
<p>in one form or another,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll encourage you to take a brief listen to that talk.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss lithium</p>
<p>in the context of its applications</p>
<p>for treatment of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And the discovery of lithium</p>
<p>as a treatment for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is truly a miraculous story</p>
<p>that I think everyone should know.</p>
<p>The key player in this story is a physician</p>
<p>by the last name Cade.</p>
<p>He was an Australian physician.</p>
<p>And Cade has a very interesting story in his own right.</p>
<p>Cade was an Australian psychiatrist</p>
<p>or Australian psychiatrist who also was a soldier.</p>
<p>And during World War II,</p>
<p>after the fall of Singapore to Japan,</p>
<p>he became a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>And he was a prisoner of war from 1942 until 1945.</p>
<p>So he had some time for observation.</p>
<p>And during his imprisonment,</p>
<p>he observed some of his fellow inmates</p>
<p>as going through pretty wild vacillations</p>
<p>in mood and energy,</p>
<p>essentially going from manic episodes to depressed episodes</p>
<p>or from manic to normal episodes.</p>
<p>And for one reason or another,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know why because I couldn&rsquo;t find any report</p>
<p>as to why he hypothesized this,</p>
<p>but he hypothesized that there was some buildup</p>
<p>of some chemical in these people&rsquo;s brains</p>
<p>that then they would urinate out.</p>
<p>And that urinating out of whatever chemical</p>
<p>was in there would allow them to be more relaxed</p>
<p>and not manic.</p>
<p>In other words, Cade hypothesized</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a buildup of a chemical</p>
<p>in certain people&rsquo;s brains that makes them manic</p>
<p>and they urinate that chemical out.</p>
<p>So eventually he got out of this prison,</p>
<p>as we mentioned in 1945,</p>
<p>and he started doing experiments</p>
<p>in addition to seeing patients in his clinic.</p>
<p>And what he did is he started to take urine</p>
<p>from people who exhibited mania</p>
<p>and urine from people who were not manic.</p>
<p>And he took that urine and he would inject it</p>
<p>into guinea pigs as an experimental model.</p>
<p>And his general observation</p>
<p>was that there was something in the urine</p>
<p>that was indeed making the guinea pigs more manic</p>
<p>if they were injected with urine from a manic patient.</p>
<p>The exact measures that he was taking</p>
<p>in these guinea pigs wasn&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>This is at a time or an era in science</p>
<p>when you could just sort of report things</p>
<p>a little bit more subjectively,</p>
<p>although there were still numbers and statistics.</p>
<p>It was a little bit more of like case studies</p>
<p>and descriptions.</p>
<p>But it turns out that even though</p>
<p>that all seems a little bit loose,</p>
<p>it led to some incredible and still important discoveries</p>
<p>for psychiatric health.</p>
<p>So what he figured out was that the urine</p>
<p>from manic patients seemed to be more toxic</p>
<p>for these guinea pigs.</p>
<p>And he also knew that there are two toxic substances</p>
<p>in urine, urea and uric acid.</p>
<p>So he was able to separate the urea and uric acid</p>
<p>from people with mania and patients that did not have mania.</p>
<p>And he figured out that the urea was the same</p>
<p>in both these mentally ill manic patients</p>
<p>and the non-manic patients.</p>
<p>So it did not seem that urea was the compound</p>
<p>that was creating these manic episodes</p>
<p>or related to manic episodes or held the toxicity.</p>
<p>So instead he focused on the uric acid.</p>
<p>Now, in order to put the uric acid into solution</p>
<p>so that he could inject it into these guinea pigs,</p>
<p>he had to try a number of different compounds</p>
<p>in order to dilute it.</p>
<p>It just so happens that,</p>
<p>and you chemists will be familiar with this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain things</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t go into solution easily.</p>
<p>You put the powder in a vial,</p>
<p>you add some water or a saline or another solution,</p>
<p>you mix it up and the powder stays suspended in there.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t actually ever become a clear liquid</p>
<p>that you can inject.</p>
<p>So in order to try injecting different strains</p>
<p>of uric acid, he ended up using lithium</p>
<p>to assist in the dilution and lithium worked.</p>
<p>So what he basically was doing, again, for you chemists,</p>
<p>is he was taking uric acid, he was adding lithium</p>
<p>and making a solution of lithium urate, okay?</p>
<p>This is a lot of details, but this is important</p>
<p>because what he eventually found</p>
<p>is that when he diluted the uric acid with lithium</p>
<p>and created lithium urate,</p>
<p>lithium urate could actually calm down these guinea pigs</p>
<p>that were injected with the toxic urea.</p>
<p>He also found that lithium urate</p>
<p>had a generally calming effect on these guinea pigs.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re really off in crazy territory, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about urine from patients</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s separating out urea and uric acid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding lithium to the uric acid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re injecting this into guinea pigs.</p>
<p>This is getting pretty wild and pretty weird,</p>
<p>but this is medicine.</p>
<p>And from time to time, this is medicine and science.</p>
<p>Cade was a good scientist</p>
<p>in addition to being a good physician.</p>
<p>And by good scientists,</p>
<p>I mean that he did control experiments.</p>
<p>Here he was injecting lithium urate into animals</p>
<p>and seeing an effect, but he knew that</p>
<p>that solution of lithium urate</p>
<p>contained not just the uric acid,</p>
<p>but it also contained lithium.</p>
<p>And so he quite appropriately asked,</p>
<p>maybe the lithium alone is having this calming effect</p>
<p>on these guinea pigs.</p>
<p>And indeed that was the case.</p>
<p>When he did the proper control experiment</p>
<p>and injected only lithium solution into these guinea pigs,</p>
<p>they calmed down.</p>
<p>From there, he, in sort of 1940 style medicine,</p>
<p>this would not happen now,</p>
<p>he very quickly moved from that animal model</p>
<p>into human patients</p>
<p>and started injecting human patients with lithium</p>
<p>or providing lithium orally to those patients.</p>
<p>And lo and behold,</p>
<p>found an absolutely profound and positive effect of lithium</p>
<p>in reducing symptoms of mania.</p>
<p>And as all good physician scientists do,</p>
<p>he wrote up his results</p>
<p>and he wrote it up in a paper entitled</p>
<p>Lithium Salts and the Treatment of Psychotic Excitement.</p>
<p>Okay, back then they didn&rsquo;t call it mania,</p>
<p>they called it psychotic excitement.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published September 3rd, 1949</p>
<p>in the Medical Journal of Australia.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study</p>
<p>as now a classic study in the field of psychiatry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful paper to read.</p>
<p>And actually I encourage people,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not a scientist or a clinician,</p>
<p>to just take a quick look at the second page in this paper</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve made available to you,</p>
<p>where he describes each of the various case studies</p>
<p>or the individuals that he looked at.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to read these in detail now</p>
<p>because it would take a lot of unnecessary time,</p>
<p>but things like case seven, MC, aged 40 years old,</p>
<p>suffering from manic recurrent mania.</p>
<p>In this episode, he&rsquo;d been excited, restless,</p>
<p>and violent for over two months</p>
<p>and was interfering so often</p>
<p>that he had to be confined to a single room during the day.</p>
<p>Right, so this is very debilitating,</p>
<p>what we now know to be bipolar depression.</p>
<p>He commenced taking lithium citrate 20 grains,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a measure of the amount of lithium,</p>
<p>three times a day.</p>
<p>In four days, he was distinctly quieter.</p>
<p>And by February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal.</p>
<p>He continued well, and on February 20th, 1949,</p>
<p>the dose of citrate was reduced to 10 grains,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>He left the hospital.</p>
<p>There are numerous descriptions of this sort</p>
<p>within this paper,</p>
<p>including some descriptions of patients</p>
<p>that did not see such success,</p>
<p>and including some descriptions of patients</p>
<p>that suffered from some negative side effects.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important to point out as well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an absolutely wonderful paper,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an absolutely wonderful voyage</p>
<p>into the history of psychiatry,</p>
<p>right down to the discussion</p>
<p>where in just three short paragraphs,</p>
<p>Cade really lays out the case</p>
<p>for why lithium is such an important discovery</p>
<p>in the treatment of what at that time</p>
<p>they were calling psychotic excitement</p>
<p>and what we now know to be manic bipolar depression.</p>
<p>Lithium, I should mention,</p>
<p>has a number of important features,</p>
<p>but also a number of important side effects</p>
<p>that need to be considered.</p>
<p>First of all, it does have a certain toxicity,</p>
<p>and so levels of lithium in the blood</p>
<p>need to be monitored extremely carefully.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing</p>
<p>that people can just take at a given dose</p>
<p>and every patient responds the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of oversight</p>
<p>and a lot of blood tests that have to be done,</p>
<p>especially in the first three months of lithium treatment.</p>
<p>I should mention that lithium treatment is still used</p>
<p>to some great degree of success in many,</p>
<p>not all people suffering from bipolar depression</p>
<p>or bipolar disorder rather,</p>
<p>but there are a number of important things that happened</p>
<p>between 1949 and present day</p>
<p>that prevented lithium from reaching patients</p>
<p>that really needed it.</p>
<p>And that all can be summarized</p>
<p>in two or three short sentences.</p>
<p>Basically, by virtue of the fact</p>
<p>that lithium is a naturally occurring element,</p>
<p>it could not be patented.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of that,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of potential profit for drug companies</p>
<p>to produce lithium.</p>
<p>In fact, still to this day, it&rsquo;s very low cost.</p>
<p>And still to this day,</p>
<p>no one really owns the patent for lithium</p>
<p>in its purest form.</p>
<p>So that made it unattractive.</p>
<p>It turns out that the FDA in the United States</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t allow lithium to be used as a treatment</p>
<p>for manic bipolar disorder until 1970.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about a full 21 years</p>
<p>from the publication of this paper</p>
<p>by Cade in the Medical Journal of Australia</p>
<p>showing quite beautifully the great potential</p>
<p>and use of lithium</p>
<p>for quelling the symptoms of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>until the first patients in the United States</p>
<p>were starting to access lithium regularly.</p>
<p>And nowadays, of course, lithium is available,</p>
<p>but still not able to be patented</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s element number three on the periodic table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s naturally occurring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not literally falling down from the stars as stardust</p>
<p>and going into pill form,</p>
<p>but rather it can be synthesized in laboratories,</p>
<p>but it is available.</p>
<p>It does show not only great potential in many patients,</p>
<p>but great application in many patients</p>
<p>despite its side effects.</p>
<p>So lithium really stands as this kind of golden example</p>
<p>of a treatment that works, at least in many individuals,</p>
<p>prior to an understanding of the biological basis</p>
<p>of the disease for which that treatment is needed.</p>
<p>Now, with that said,</p>
<p>scientists and clinicians have been quite rigorous</p>
<p>in trying to understand why and how lithium works</p>
<p>in order to understand the why and how of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>This is the way that proper medicine and science is done.</p>
<p>Even if there&rsquo;s an excellent treatment for something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to understand why that treatment works</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>not everyone responds to that treatment.</p>
<p>Second of all, scientists and physicians understand</p>
<p>that just because we have one treatment that works,</p>
<p>if it has any side effects at all,</p>
<p>there is the possibility for better treatments.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about trying to bypass a drug</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make much money for drug companies.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people think in those terms,</p>
<p>they think, oh, well, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this continued search for better treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder, even though lithium works</p>
<p>because lithium doesn&rsquo;t allow drug companies</p>
<p>to make much money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really the case.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, is that the toxicity,</p>
<p>some of the other issues that are created with lithium,</p>
<p>the fact that people need the ongoing blood testing,</p>
<p>et cetera, really stimulates the need,</p>
<p>really an urgent need for new and better treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And only by understanding how lithium works</p>
<p>at the cellar level, at the neural circuit level, et cetera,</p>
<p>do we really stand to find those new discoveries.</p>
<p>If you were to do a literature search</p>
<p>on the actions and mechanisms of lithium</p>
<p>in terms of how it can calm people down</p>
<p>and reduce their manic episodes,</p>
<p>you would find an enormous array of papers,</p>
<p>literally thousands of scientific studies in animals</p>
<p>and in humans, which for instance,</p>
<p>will tell you that lithium treatment</p>
<p>will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived nootrophic</p>
<p>factor.</p>
<p>BDNF is often talked about in the context</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity, the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And indeed, it does seem that ingesting lithium</p>
<p>increases BDNF.</p>
<p>BDNF is what we call permissive for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t create specific changes in the brain,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s not going to make your memory better</p>
<p>or your coordination better</p>
<p>or your emotional state better per se.</p>
<p>What BDNF does is it permits the neurons,</p>
<p>the nerve cells and their connections in the brain</p>
<p>to be more likely to change</p>
<p>if the proper environmental conditions are met.</p>
<p>That is BDNF creates a kind of buoyancy to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It opens the gates to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So lithium does increase BDNF.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in the context of the neural circuits involved</p>
<p>with bipolar disorder in a few minutes.</p>
<p>It also seems to be a potent anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>Now, inflammation is one of those words</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thrown around extensively nowadays,</p>
<p>especially on social media,</p>
<p>and especially as it relates to any health condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation</p>
<p>always seems to be discussed</p>
<p>in the context of inflammation being bad.</p>
<p>But I do want to point out that inflammation</p>
<p>is a natural adaptive response to physical injury</p>
<p>to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the basis</p>
<p>by which adaptations occur to exercise.</p>
<p>So for instance, you were to weight train</p>
<p>and use a heavier than normal weight</p>
<p>and do a set to failure</p>
<p>or create some little micro tears in the muscle</p>
<p>that are healthy in the sense</p>
<p>that they would create adaptations</p>
<p>and make that muscle stronger, maybe even grow that muscle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an inflammatory response associated with that</p>
<p>that is critical to the positive adaptation.</p>
<p>So inflammation isn&rsquo;t always bad,</p>
<p>although excessive, or as we say,</p>
<p>runaway inflammation is bad.</p>
<p>Lithium seems to be able to suppress inflammation</p>
<p>and importantly, it can suppress inflammation</p>
<p>in neural tissues and within the brain in particular.</p>
<p>That is important.</p>
<p>And we will return to that</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s important in a little bit.</p>
<p>The other thing about lithium</p>
<p>is that lithium is neuroprotective.</p>
<p>That is, it can prevent neurons from dying</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Why would neurons die?</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.</p>
<p>There can be a physical insult to the neurons.</p>
<p>You can get hit really hard in the head.</p>
<p>A bullet, you know, God forbid,</p>
<p>can enter the skull and kill neurons.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.</p>
<p>Neuroprotection is a situation</p>
<p>in which a neuron is given some sort of chemical</p>
<p>or physical resiliency that allows it to suffer an insult</p>
<p>and yet bounce back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very similar to the way</p>
<p>that we think about psychological resiliency.</p>
<p>Neuroprotection is an ability for neurons</p>
<p>to be better able to handle stress of different kinds,</p>
<p>in particular, excitotoxicity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phenomenon in bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and a lot of other psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>in which hyperactivity of certain brain areas</p>
<p>actually starts to kill off neurons.</p>
<p>Hyperactivity doesn&rsquo;t always do this,</p>
<p>but it turns out that if certain brain circuits</p>
<p>are too active for too long,</p>
<p>some of the chemicals associated with neuronal activity,</p>
<p>things like calcium and neurotransmitters like glutamate</p>
<p>can actually kill the very neurons that are active.</p>
<p>So it seems that lithium</p>
<p>can prevent some of that neurotoxicity.</p>
<p>Now, this turns out to be particularly important</p>
<p>for this discussion about bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and the neural circuit basis of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Because if we are to take a step back and ask</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s different in the brains</p>
<p>of people with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>there are some very interesting answers</p>
<p>that start to emerge.</p>
<p>There are basically two main neural circuits</p>
<p>that are present in normal individuals.</p>
<p>I say normal, I say that respectfully</p>
<p>to the people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>by referring to people who do not suffer</p>
<p>from manic episodes or from manic depression.</p>
<p>There are circuits that are present</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and in people that do not suffer from bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Both of those circuits do the same thing</p>
<p>in both sets of individuals.</p>
<p>And yet in people with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>there seems to be an atrophy</p>
<p>or a removal of certain neural connections over time</p>
<p>that leads to a situation</p>
<p>in which people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>become very poor at registering their own internal state,</p>
<p>in particular, their emotional states</p>
<p>and their somatic states.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re referring to here</p>
<p>is something called interoception.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast before,</p>
<p>but there are two modes of perception.</p>
<p>Perception, of course, is a attention</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s happening in our environment</p>
<p>or to us on or within our body.</p>
<p>Exteroception is literally an attention</p>
<p>to things that are happening</p>
<p>beyond the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>So seeing that person&rsquo;s face over there</p>
<p>or seeing that color of leaf over there</p>
<p>or hearing a sound over to my left,</p>
<p>that is exteroception,</p>
<p>perception of things beyond the confines of one&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s interoception,</p>
<p>which is perception of things that are happening internally.</p>
<p>How full does my gut feel?</p>
<p>How fast is my heart beating?</p>
<p>Some people can measure that quite accurately</p>
<p>just by thinking about it, other people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How happy am I?</p>
<p>How sad am I?</p>
<p>How energetic am I?</p>
<p>How lethargic am I, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we are always existing in a balance</p>
<p>between exteroception and interoception.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, people with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>over time, and especially into the second</p>
<p>and third decade of having bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>seem to have progressively diminished levels</p>
<p>of interoception.</p>
<p>And that very likely is important</p>
<p>in their inability to register, for instance,</p>
<p>that, wow, they are talking at an excessive rate</p>
<p>or they haven&rsquo;t slept in five or even 10 days,</p>
<p>or they haven&rsquo;t eaten in a long period of time.</p>
<p>This atrophy of neural circuits for interoception</p>
<p>is starting to emerge</p>
<p>as one of the defining neural circuit characteristics</p>
<p>or underpinnings of bipolar.</p>
<p>Now I bridge to this conversation about neural circuits</p>
<p>from the statement that lithium can protect</p>
<p>against some of the neurotoxic effects</p>
<p>of neural circuits being very active.</p>
<p>Now this can get a little bit complicated,</p>
<p>but I promise I&rsquo;m gonna make it clear</p>
<p>for any of you that are watching and or listening.</p>
<p>The reality is that people with bipolar depression</p>
<p>very likely have a hyperactivity,</p>
<p>that is an increased level of activity</p>
<p>in certain circuits within the brain</p>
<p>early in the expression of their disease.</p>
<p>And that typically, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>sets in around the early 20s,</p>
<p>although sometimes that can be even earlier</p>
<p>in the teens and so forth.</p>
<p>But that hyperactivity, we think,</p>
<p>leads to a toxicity, an excitotoxicity</p>
<p>of certain elements of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for interoception.</p>
<p>In other words, the overuse of certain circuits</p>
<p>can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy,</p>
<p>or even a death of certain elements within those circuits.</p>
<p>And it appears that lithium,</p>
<p>through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects,</p>
<p>and through its ability to increase BDNF,</p>
<p>very likely protects us</p>
<p>against some of that atrophy</p>
<p>of those circuits for interoception.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t a case in which people with bipolar</p>
<p>have a neural circuit or lack a neural circuit,</p>
<p>and people without bipolar are the opposite.</p>
<p>This is a case in which</p>
<p>everyone more or less starts out the same,</p>
<p>but it seems that there&rsquo;s a hyperactivity</p>
<p>of certain neural circuits in people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that over time actually causes those circuits to diminish.</p>
<p>Now, this is very important</p>
<p>because some of the more recent longitudinal studies</p>
<p>doing brain imaging on people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and those without, and doing that over time</p>
<p>in patients starting as early as their teens,</p>
<p>but into their 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>reveals just that,</p>
<p>that there can be hyperactivity of circuits early on,</p>
<p>but then hypo, reduced activity of those very same circuits</p>
<p>at a time five or 10 years later.</p>
<p>Again, this speaks to the complicated nature</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder and the complicated nature of psychiatry</p>
<p>and linking specific psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>to neural circuits in general.</p>
<p>Because if you have a situation in which,</p>
<p>you know, in one disease,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just hypothesize here for a second</p>
<p>that for instance, in certain forms of schizophrenia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s elevated dopamine,</p>
<p>and were we to just reduce the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that they would receive relief</p>
<p>from those schizophrenic symptoms?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all pretty straightforward on the face of it.</p>
<p>But in this situation with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about is hyperactivity,</p>
<p>too much activity,</p>
<p>leading to hypoactivity</p>
<p>through death of those very circuits.</p>
<p>And so now you can especially appreciate</p>
<p>why when the patient shows up to the psychiatrist</p>
<p>or when the psychiatrist shows up to the patient</p>
<p>in the total course of their disease</p>
<p>is going to be very important.</p>
<p>And then layer on top of that,</p>
<p>the complexity of the fact</p>
<p>that the very defining characteristic of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is that there are oscillations in mood.</p>
<p>So now we need to think about treatments,</p>
<p>not just for the manic episodes,</p>
<p>but also treatments for the depressive episodes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in fact what psychiatrists do.</p>
<p>Turns out that they apply different treatments</p>
<p>or combinations of treatments</p>
<p>for patients that are in manic episodes</p>
<p>versus depressive episodes.</p>
<p>And they have to infer all that from discussions.</p>
<p>Again, just exchange of words,</p>
<p>depending on when that person walked into their office,</p>
<p>where they are in terms of manic episodes,</p>
<p>no symptomology or depressive symptomology,</p>
<p>and whether or not they&rsquo;ve had that symptomology</p>
<p>for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>And then just to make the situation even more complicated,</p>
<p>the very circuits that atrophy,</p>
<p>that start to wane and disappear</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>are the circuits for interoception,</p>
<p>for understanding of what&rsquo;s going on in one&rsquo;s own body.</p>
<p>So you can imagine if you sit down and ask somebody,</p>
<p>well, how long has it been since you slept?</p>
<p>That person may genuinely not know.</p>
<p>Or if you ask the very depressed person,</p>
<p>how depressed are you?</p>
<p>That person may not be able to articulate that.</p>
<p>So fortunately there are solutions to this.</p>
<p>And the solution is that more often than not,</p>
<p>the accurate understanding of whether or not</p>
<p>someone has bipolar depression or not,</p>
<p>and what stage of the illness they might be in or not,</p>
<p>is going to depend on the reports of people around them</p>
<p>and not the patient themselves.</p>
<p>Hence the importance of having a rather detailed</p>
<p>and admittedly a rather intense discussion</p>
<p>about the symptomology of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>so that you can have an understanding</p>
<p>of the people around you and have an eye and an ear</p>
<p>to whether or not those people</p>
<p>might be suffering from bipolar.</p>
<p>And if so, at what stage of the disease</p>
<p>they might happen to be at.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about what is known about the neural circuits</p>
<p>that lead to the manic states,</p>
<p>as well as the depressive states,</p>
<p>but mainly the manic states of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>We already discussed the fact that interoception,</p>
<p>registering of one&rsquo;s own internal emotions</p>
<p>and bodily states is diminished</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t really talked about the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for that lack of recognition.</p>
<p>For that reason, I&rsquo;d like to point out a paper.</p>
<p>This is a fairly recent paper, just came out this year,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an excellent one,</p>
<p>looking at the changes over time in neural circuitry</p>
<p>in people with high genetic risk for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>and in particular in young people.</p>
<p>And studies of this sort are rare,</p>
<p>but are exceedingly important</p>
<p>because of the fact that they track individuals over time.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Longitudinal Changes in Structural Connectivity</p>
<p>in Young People at High Genetic Risk for Bipolar Disorder.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>There are a lot of data in this paper,</p>
<p>in particular neuroimaging data.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite extensive</p>
<p>in terms of analyzing the so-called connectomics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of genomics,</p>
<p>which is the analysis of genes</p>
<p>and their display in different individuals</p>
<p>or different animals, et cetera.</p>
<p>You have proteomics,</p>
<p>which is the display of,</p>
<p>or the existence of different proteins.</p>
<p>So omics is a big thing now in science.</p>
<p>You kind of throw omics behind anything</p>
<p>and it becomes its own Wikipedia page,</p>
<p>which means it becomes its own thing.</p>
<p>So to speak, I say that only partially in jest.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, connectomics is the analysis of connections</p>
<p>between different neurons and neural circuit elements.</p>
<p>And what this paper really showed</p>
<p>by analyzing the connectomics</p>
<p>of neural circuits in the brains</p>
<p>of many different people with different categories of,</p>
<p>and onset of, and severity of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>as well as controls in different age groups, et cetera,</p>
<p>is that people who are a particularly high risk</p>
<p>for having bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or that have full-blown bipolar disorder</p>
<p>have deficits and actually reductions</p>
<p>in the amount of connectivity</p>
<p>between what are called the parietal brain regions</p>
<p>and the limbic system.</p>
<p>Now, the limbic system I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>before in this podcast,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not familiar with it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what it is in a moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply a collection of brain structures,</p>
<p>not one brain structure,</p>
<p>but a collection of brain structures</p>
<p>that generally are responsible</p>
<p>for shifting the overall state that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>from states of more relaxed and calm</p>
<p>to states of more alert and focused.</p>
<p>The limbic system is intimately related</p>
<p>to the so-called autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which regulates our sleep-wake cycles</p>
<p>and a number of other things like our digestion, et cetera,</p>
<p>our level of hunger and on and on.</p>
<p>So the limbic system is really kind of like a volume control</p>
<p>or as nerd scientists like to say,</p>
<p>a kind of game control on the overall level</p>
<p>or amplitude of alertness or calmness.</p>
<p>In fact, if we&rsquo;re very, very calm,</p>
<p>we are asleep or even more calm, we can be in a coma.</p>
<p>If we are very alert,</p>
<p>we can be wide awake and ready to work and run, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or if we are very, very, very alert</p>
<p>by way of limbic autonomic interactions,</p>
<p>well, then we can be in anxiety,</p>
<p>we can be in full-blown panic attack,</p>
<p>or we can be in mania.</p>
<p>We can have so much energy</p>
<p>that we feel like we don&rsquo;t need to sleep.</p>
<p>And in fact, disruptions in the circuitry</p>
<p>really seems to be what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in people who have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Now, if disruptions in the circuitry</p>
<p>are present in the limbic system,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that the limbic system is at fault</p>
<p>because the way that neural circuits work</p>
<p>is that different brain areas are talking to one another</p>
<p>through electrical chemical signaling</p>
<p>and they are regulating one another.</p>
<p>And what this paper really tells us</p>
<p>is that there are elements within the parietal lobe,</p>
<p>which is a kind of a section of the brain</p>
<p>that sits off to the side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really off to the side,</p>
<p>but in neuroanatomical nomenclature,</p>
<p>the parietal lobe is connected in two ways bidirectionally.</p>
<p>So parietal lobe is connecting to limbic system</p>
<p>and limbic system is connecting to parietal lobe.</p>
<p>And in people with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>it seems that the parietal lobe</p>
<p>is able to exert less top-down control,</p>
<p>that is less suppression</p>
<p>of certain elements of the limbic system,</p>
<p>which at least right now is leading researchers</p>
<p>to hypothesize that the limbic system</p>
<p>is sort of revving at higher levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like RPM in your cars</p>
<p>or kind of red lining at times</p>
<p>and for durations that are inappropriate</p>
<p>or at least abnormal.</p>
<p>So we have two major sets of neural circuit deficits</p>
<p>or changes in people with bipolar.</p>
<p>Their lack of internal awareness is reduced</p>
<p>and that turns out to be by way of neural structures</p>
<p>like the insula, which is a brain region</p>
<p>that is connected in a very direct way</p>
<p>to our somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>So the part of our cortex that registers how we feel,</p>
<p>literally, sense of touch and internal state.</p>
<p>So those circuits, excuse me,</p>
<p>for those of you listening, I just bumped the microphone.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Those circuits are disrupted in people with bipolar</p>
<p>and the top-down control,</p>
<p>the kind of accelerator and brake</p>
<p>on our overall levels of energy are also disrupted.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s all fine and good because, well, it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>at least according to what the data</p>
<p>at this point in time tell us.</p>
<p>There may be new discoveries to come,</p>
<p>but that all seems to be the case,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us how to modulate</p>
<p>or change that circuitry.</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t tell us how something like lithium</p>
<p>can actually benefit a large number of patients</p>
<p>or how a good number of the other treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder, which we&rsquo;ll talk about going forward,</p>
<p>can benefit patients with bipolar.</p>
<p>So it appears that lithium is exerting its positive effects</p>
<p>on bipolar depression treatment,</p>
<p>at least in part by preventing the loss</p>
<p>of certain neural circuits,</p>
<p>namely the neural circuits for interoception</p>
<p>and the top-down control over the limbic system.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that by examining lithium&rsquo;s effects</p>
<p>at an even more reductionist level,</p>
<p>we can gain really important insight</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s going on in bipolar depression</p>
<p>and some of the other treatments for bipolar depression,</p>
<p>including behavioral treatments,</p>
<p>things like transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>and even some of the more natural</p>
<p>or so-called nutraceutical treatments,</p>
<p>including things like high-dose omega-3 supplementation,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re going to talk about extensively.</p>
<p>Now, in order to understand</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to talk about next,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that everybody understand</p>
<p>a key concept of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And this is a key concept,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not one is talking</p>
<p>about bipolar depression.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s something I think everybody,</p>
<p>every citizen of earth should know about,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called homeostatic plasticity.</p>
<p>Homeostatic plasticity is a particular form</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity in which if a neural circuit</p>
<p>is overactive for a period of time,</p>
<p>there are changes that occur at the cellular level</p>
<p>that lead to a balance or a homeostatic regulation</p>
<p>of that circuit so that it&rsquo;s no longer overactive.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a neural circuit is underactive</p>
<p>for a period of time,</p>
<p>certain changes happen within the cells of that circuit</p>
<p>to ramp up their activity</p>
<p>or make them more likely to be active.</p>
<p>And whether or not a neural circuit</p>
<p>and the neurons within it become more active</p>
<p>or less active in the context of homeostatic plasticity</p>
<p>largely depends on one mechanism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful mechanism</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll make very clear to you right now,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology.</p>
<p>Neurons communicate with one another</p>
<p>by releasing so-called neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>which are just chemicals.</p>
<p>Those neurotransmitters are vomited out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually vomited,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re spit out into the so-called synaptic cleft,</p>
<p>often called the synapse.</p>
<p>The synapse is just a little gap between neurons.</p>
<p>And when they are released into the synapse,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t just stay there.</p>
<p>They actually park or bind to receptors</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s called the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>And depending on how many receptors they bind to</p>
<p>and how many receptors are available, et cetera,</p>
<p>they can have a greater or lesser effect</p>
<p>on the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>This scenario of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>being released into synapses,</p>
<p>then binding to receptors on postsynaptic neurons</p>
<p>and influencing the electrical excitability</p>
<p>of those postsynaptic neurons</p>
<p>sits central to not just the treatment of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but to all treatments of all psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>and indeed to things like neuropathic pain as well.</p>
<p>For example, the so-called SSRIs,</p>
<p>Prozac, Zoloft, and others, et cetera,</p>
<p>stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released into the synapse.</p>
<p>And then the SSRI,</p>
<p>the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor,</p>
<p>allows more of that serotonin</p>
<p>to sit within the synapse for longer, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reuptake inhibitor.</p>
<p>It prevents reuptake by the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>And that serotonin therefore can park in</p>
<p>or dock in the receptors, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>of the postsynaptic neuron in greater numbers</p>
<p>and have a greater impact on that postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>So the drugs that are used to treat depression</p>
<p>or other things of that sort, things like SSRIs,</p>
<p>work by changing the availability</p>
<p>of neurotransmitter in the synapse.</p>
<p>Other things like MAO inhibitors,</p>
<p>monoamine oxase inhibitors, work a different way.</p>
<p>They inhibit the enzyme.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear A-S-E in biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely an enzyme which breaks things down.</p>
<p>So MAO inhibitors prevent the breakdown,</p>
<p>not the reuptake, but the breakdown of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>and therefore allow more neurotransmitter</p>
<p>to be available in the synapse</p>
<p>and influence the postsynaptic cell.</p>
<p>Homeostatic plasticity is a form of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>in which overall circuits can become much more excitable</p>
<p>or much less excitable by the addition of more receptors</p>
<p>in the postsynaptic neuron or by the removal</p>
<p>of more receptors from the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>And the way this happens is just beautiful.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the visual system</p>
<p>and the person primarily responsible</p>
<p>for the discovery of homeostatic plasticity,</p>
<p>although there are several,</p>
<p>is a woman by the name of Gina Tergiano.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a professor at Brandeis University.</p>
<p>And what the Tergiano laboratory showed was that,</p>
<p>for instance, if we are in the dark</p>
<p>for a long period of time, literally,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not seeing much for a long period of time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in the number of receptors</p>
<p>in the postsynaptic neurons so that a smaller amount</p>
<p>of light and excitability within the visual system</p>
<p>can lead to greater amounts of activity</p>
<p>in the visual system.</p>
<p>Conversely, if there&rsquo;s an overactivity</p>
<p>or an increase in activity in the visual system</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>then a number of receptors in the postsynaptic neuron</p>
<p>are removed from that postsynaptic neuron surface,</p>
<p>making any neurotransmitter that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>only able to bind the receptors that are left</p>
<p>and have less of an influence on those cells.</p>
<p>In other words, keeping a circuit</p>
<p>in so-called homeostatic balance</p>
<p>in a particular range of excitability.</p>
<p>Now, while that&rsquo;s a mouthful and an earful</p>
<p>and a conceptful, I don&rsquo;t know if a conceptful is a word,</p>
<p>but in any case, that&rsquo;s a lot to think about.</p>
<p>But all you need to know is that if a neural circuit</p>
<p>is very active for a period of time,</p>
<p>in normal individuals, there will be a reduction</p>
<p>in the amount of activity by way of removing receptors</p>
<p>that bind neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Whereas if a neural circuit is very quiet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not activated for a period of time,</p>
<p>maybe your leg is in a cast, for instance,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not activating your quadriceps and calves</p>
<p>very much well, when that cast comes off,</p>
<p>sure, the muscle might be atrophied,</p>
<p>but the nerves that connect to that muscle</p>
<p>are actually in a position to influence that muscle</p>
<p>even more once you start using that muscle or those muscles,</p>
<p>because whatever neurotransmitter is released</p>
<p>now has the opportunity to bind to more receptors,</p>
<p>in that case, in muscle, or in the case of brain circuits</p>
<p>in postsynaptic neurons.</p>
<p>So homeostatic plasticity is this beautiful</p>
<p>balancing mechanism that makes sure that neural circuits</p>
<p>are never too active nor too quiet for too long.</p>
<p>And in a beautiful display of how treatments</p>
<p>can lead to a better understanding of biology,</p>
<p>which can lead to the discovery of even better treatments,</p>
<p>lithium and another compound, which we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>ketamine, seem to exert their actions largely</p>
<p>through effects on homeostatic neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful paper that describes</p>
<p>all the nitty gritty of this.</p>
<p>Certainly most people listening, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>are not going to be interested in all this detail,</p>
<p>but for those of you that you are</p>
<p>and you want to delve deep into this,</p>
<p>this paper was published in Neuron, Cell Press Journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity</p>
<p>for the Treatment of Mood Disorders.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one particular figure in this paper</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just describe to you</p>
<p>in which measurements were made from neurons</p>
<p>and the number of receptors in those neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done somewhat indirectly through a method</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s detailed and neuroscientists are familiar with.</p>
<p>Basically what it measures is how excited</p>
<p>a given neuron is, electrically excited a given neuron is</p>
<p>to a given amount of neurotransmitter, okay?</p>
<p>So the amount of neurotransmitter that&rsquo;s vomited</p>
<p>onto a neuron is essentially kept constant</p>
<p>and then the response of the post-synaptic neuron</p>
<p>is measured.</p>
<p>So it can be of one level or higher or lower</p>
<p>depending on homeostatic plasticity.</p>
<p>And what this paper shows</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s been shown over and over again</p>
<p>is that when neurons are exposed to lithium</p>
<p>for a period of time,</p>
<p>there is a reduction in the excitability</p>
<p>of the post-synaptic neuron.</p>
<p>That is neurons within the brain become less excitable</p>
<p>over time if lithium is present.</p>
<p>Whereas ketamine, which is now a common FDA approved,</p>
<p>at least in the US,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s approved for the treatment of major depression.</p>
<p>Ketamine does the opposite.</p>
<p>Ketamine seems to increase the number of receptors</p>
<p>in the post-synaptic neuron</p>
<p>and lead to greater levels of excitability</p>
<p>and electrical activity within neural circuits</p>
<p>to a given fixed amount of neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>So this is super interesting</p>
<p>because what it means is that lithium is causing circuits</p>
<p>to be less active.</p>
<p>Ketamine is causing circuits to be more active.</p>
<p>And we know from excellent clinical data now</p>
<p>that ketamine seems to be a very effective treatment</p>
<p>for major depression</p>
<p>and for the major depressive episodes</p>
<p>of people that suffer from bipolar depression</p>
<p>that includes these major depressive episodes</p>
<p>of two weeks or longer of suppressed mood,</p>
<p>appetite, sleep issues, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, the key thing about ketamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s often not discussed</p>
<p>is that while its effects are very potent,</p>
<p>they are transient.</p>
<p>So one major drawback to ketamine therapy for depression</p>
<p>is that it has to be done repeatedly.</p>
<p>And how repeatedly or how often rather</p>
<p>depends of course on a discussion</p>
<p>between the psychiatrist and the patient.</p>
<p>This is not something to cowboy on your own.</p>
<p>I know that,</p>
<p>and many of you are probably familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that ketamine also is abused recreationally.</p>
<p>It is a so-called NMDA,</p>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.</p>
<p>So it blocks the very receptor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for neuroplasticity</p>
<p>for changes in neural circuits.</p>
<p>It also changes excitability neurons as I just described.</p>
<p>So ketamine is a very potent chemical</p>
<p>that has been shown over and over again</p>
<p>and is now FDA approved</p>
<p>for the treatment of major depression,</p>
<p>but its effects seem to be transient.</p>
<p>Lithium, as I described earlier,</p>
<p>seems to reduce the manic episodes</p>
<p>or the intensity of manic episodes in symptomology</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing that through neuroprotection.</p>
<p>So protecting neural circuits from dying away</p>
<p>that initially are overactive</p>
<p>and that overactivity causing excitotoxicity.</p>
<p>It blocks that excitotoxicity we believe.</p>
<p>And it seems to do that in part</p>
<p>by diminishing the amount of activity in those circuits.</p>
<p>So this is a beautiful mechanistic story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the sort of story that you&rsquo;d love to have</p>
<p>for a great number of psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>And fortunately we have for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Overactivity of a given circuit</p>
<p>eventually leads to neurotoxicity, excuse me.</p>
<p>Lithium is preventing that neurotoxicity</p>
<p>by reducing the number of receptors</p>
<p>in certain elements within those circuits.</p>
<p>So, so-called homeostatic scaling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s down-regulating the number of receptors</p>
<p>leading to less excitability</p>
<p>and preventing, we think, excitotoxicity.</p>
<p>And in that sense, you can see exactly why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to get lithium treatment in there early</p>
<p>for people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Ketamine as a treatment for major depression</p>
<p>seems to be effective, but transient.</p>
<p>And you can also see why it would be important</p>
<p>not just to reduce the manic episodes</p>
<p>for people with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but to also treat the depressive episodes.</p>
<p>So this is a key feature of the treatment</p>
<p>for bipolar depression and for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>There needs to be treatment both of the mania</p>
<p>and of the depressive episodes if they&rsquo;re present.</p>
<p>And fortunately there are excellent drugs to do that.</p>
<p>And I should mention that ketamine and lithium</p>
<p>are just two of the drugs within the kit</p>
<p>that psychiatrists have access to.</p>
<p>There are many things, olanzapines</p>
<p>and a number of different, including clozapine.</p>
<p>Clozapine is an antipsychotic,</p>
<p>which is commonly prescribed as a sedative in some cases</p>
<p>that allows people in manic episodes to sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s classically described</p>
<p>as so-called dopamine receptor four antagonist,</p>
<p>although it does other things as well.</p>
<p>Clozapine has a number of side effect features</p>
<p>related to white blood cell and things of that sort</p>
<p>that require careful monitoring.</p>
<p>So there are an enormous number now,</p>
<p>literally dozens and dozens of different drugs,</p>
<p>each designed to target either the manic phase,</p>
<p>the depressive phase or some,</p>
<p>what we call acute sort of early phases</p>
<p>versus ongoing treatments.</p>
<p>This is a vast galaxy of drug treatments</p>
<p>that really should be navigated.</p>
<p>I should say absolutely should be navigated</p>
<p>by a board certified psychiatrist.</p>
<p>And of course, in close discussion</p>
<p>with both the person suffering from bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but also ideally the family members</p>
<p>of the person suffering from bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>But I think at least up until now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve focused on the two major pathways for treatment,</p>
<p>lithium and ketamine.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about why lithium and ketamine work,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working on opposite ends</p>
<p>of this homeostatic scaling.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about the circuits that are involved</p>
<p>in generating what we think are the manic symptomology</p>
<p>and the lack of interoception,</p>
<p>why people can just persist in staying awake,</p>
<p>awake, awake, not eating, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now you have in mind how all that is put together.</p>
<p>And I think you have in mind</p>
<p>some of the well-demonstrated treatments</p>
<p>for the different component parts of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>which now I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;re also well-versed in</p>
<p>based on our early, early discussion</p>
<p>of what constitutes bipolar I and bipolar II.</p>
<p>Now I would like to also talk about</p>
<p>some of the not so typical therapeutics</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>and also point to the things that have been tried and failed</p>
<p>for successful treatment of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Because some of those things are often talked about</p>
<p>and suggested, especially in online communities.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s not clear that any of them</p>
<p>are particularly hazardous on their own,</p>
<p>although some of them do carry some hazards,</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because of the critical time-sensitive nature</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder and the urgency</p>
<p>of getting treatments early</p>
<p>to try and prevent some of the longer lasting</p>
<p>neural circuit changes,</p>
<p>that if people can avoid some of the less effective</p>
<p>or demonstrated to be ineffective treatments,</p>
<p>that they stand to combat bipolar disorder</p>
<p>much more successfully.</p>
<p>First of all, a key point about drug therapies</p>
<p>versus non-drug therapies or talk therapies.</p>
<p>Without question, drug therapies</p>
<p>are going to be most effective when done</p>
<p>also with talk therapies.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about which talk therapies</p>
<p>have been demonstrated to be most effective.</p>
<p>There is some argument about what I&rsquo;m about to say next,</p>
<p>but in general, most psychiatrists will tell you,</p>
<p>or certainly the ones I&rsquo;ve spoken to have told me,</p>
<p>that talk therapy on its own is rarely, if ever,</p>
<p>effective for bipolar depression and bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s BP1 or BP2.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality of it.</p>
<p>You know, contrast that with our discussion</p>
<p>about obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>which we talked about a few episodes ago.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen that episode,</p>
<p>we have an in-depth episode all about OCD</p>
<p>and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>There, it seems that drug therapies and talk therapies</p>
<p>can be done independently or in combination.</p>
<p>As expected, combined drug and talk therapies</p>
<p>are more effective there than either one alone,</p>
<p>but there are pretty impressive effects</p>
<p>of talk therapy alone,</p>
<p>provided that they&rsquo;re initiated at the right time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the right form of talk therapy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OCD, but in terms of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>it really seems that the drug therapies are necessary,</p>
<p>at least in most all cases.</p>
<p>That said, talk therapies are terrific augment</p>
<p>or support for those drug therapies,</p>
<p>and sometimes can allow people to take lower doses</p>
<p>of those drug therapies,</p>
<p>which turns out to be important</p>
<p>because of the side effect profiles of a lot of drug</p>
<p>therapies and sometimes the cost as well.</p>
<p>I guess we can think of cost</p>
<p>just as another side effect, really.</p>
<p>There are both established and more novel forms</p>
<p>of talk therapy being used, again,</p>
<p>in concert with drug treatments for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one</p>
<p>that seems to be best,</p>
<p>at least by way of the statistics and papers that exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the one that&rsquo;s been explored the most.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s often considered</p>
<p>the most popular or effective</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s also been around longer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been explored the most.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy, in general,</p>
<p>is a progressive exposure of the patient</p>
<p>in a very controlled way in a clinical setting</p>
<p>to some of the triggers or the conditions</p>
<p>that would exacerbate bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said,</p>
<p>borderline personality disorder has all these triggers</p>
<p>and triggered elements from the external environment,</p>
<p>whereas bipolar disorder does not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still true,</p>
<p>but it is the case that somebody with bipolar</p>
<p>can have worse symptoms if life conditions get worse</p>
<p>or more stressful.</p>
<p>So cognitive behavioral therapy in the discussion about,</p>
<p>and sometimes the direct exposure</p>
<p>to anxiety provoking elements of life</p>
<p>can be very helpful for adjusting the responses</p>
<p>to those otherwise triggering events</p>
<p>and sometimes making the drug treatments more effective</p>
<p>even at lower doses.</p>
<p>There are also forms of therapy,</p>
<p>including family-focused therapy,</p>
<p>which is especially important in terms of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>because family members,</p>
<p>provided that they are not themselves in a manic episode</p>
<p>due to the close heritability of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but family members can often be excellent windows</p>
<p>into whether or not somebody is doing well or poorly</p>
<p>or is veering toward</p>
<p>or is emerging from a manic or depressive episode</p>
<p>because they understand that person.</p>
<p>They have a lot of data.</p>
<p>It could be purely subjective data,</p>
<p>but they have a lot of exposure to how long</p>
<p>or well somebody has been sleeping or eating, et cetera.</p>
<p>So family-focused therapy involves other members</p>
<p>of the person suffering from bipolar disorders family,</p>
<p>as well as conversations about family members</p>
<p>in a way that helps patients with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>navigate not just through manic episodes</p>
<p>and depressive episodes,</p>
<p>but start to learn to predict what are the conditions,</p>
<p>psychological, physical, and otherwise,</p>
<p>that can trigger bipolar episodes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a category of therapy</p>
<p>called interpersonal and social rhythm therapy.</p>
<p>This is deserving of its own entire episode, really.</p>
<p>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</p>
<p>is sort of an expansion on family-focused therapy,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s distinct in certain ways as well,</p>
<p>and really focuses on how people are relating</p>
<p>to others in their life and in the workplace</p>
<p>and in the school environment</p>
<p>and also within the family, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I should say that a overall theme</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emerging in psychiatry and psychology</p>
<p>is to start wherever possible</p>
<p>to incorporate more of the social aspects</p>
<p>and the interpersonal aspects.</p>
<p>In other words, not just talking to</p>
<p>and examining a patient as one biological system,</p>
<p>one nervous system, one set of chemicals and one life,</p>
<p>but rather a set of chemicals, neural circuits,</p>
<p>and a life that&rsquo;s embedded in the chemicals</p>
<p>and neural circuits and lives of other people.</p>
<p>Just by way of example,</p>
<p>you can imagine that if somebody</p>
<p>is in a very healthy relationship</p>
<p>or a very abusive relationship,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s going to strongly impact</p>
<p>the outcomes of manic episodes.</p>
<p>You can imagine that if the financial situation</p>
<p>is one in which people can recover from manic episodes,</p>
<p>I did mention this earlier, but I should have, forgive me,</p>
<p>that oftentimes people who are in a manic episode</p>
<p>will go out and spend immense amounts of money</p>
<p>that they simply cannot afford to lose.</p>
<p>And then the depressive episodes that in many cases follow</p>
<p>are made far worse by the financial anxiety</p>
<p>and the financial stress that results</p>
<p>from those manic episodes of spending, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then of course, this carries over to sexual promiscuity</p>
<p>where people might be dealing with unwanted pregnancy</p>
<p>or STIs or very fractured interpersonal dynamics</p>
<p>with existing or new relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, you can imagine how these manic episodes</p>
<p>as well as the depressive episodes</p>
<p>can really wick out into an enormous amount of destruction,</p>
<p>which brings us back to the initial criteria</p>
<p>of BP1 and BP2 is that these manic episodes</p>
<p>are not a good thing.</p>
<p>These depressive episodes are not a good thing.</p>
<p>They create this sense of euphoria</p>
<p>in the person experiencing mania,</p>
<p>or they create this sense that anything is possible.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, and actually every day,</p>
<p>these episodes are quite maladaptive.</p>
<p>They really destroy people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the life of the person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s suffering from bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And so hence cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>family-focused therapy,</p>
<p>and interpersonal and social rhythm therapies</p>
<p>are the primary three talk therapies</p>
<p>that are most often combined with drug therapies</p>
<p>in order to try and really reduce the harm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really all about harm reduction</p>
<p>from manic episodes and depressive episodes.</p>
<p>One very exciting and emerging treatment</p>
<p>that does show great promise,</p>
<p>and in some cases great outcomes for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is believe it or not, electric shock therapy.</p>
<p>Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric.</p>
<p>And in fact, it tends to look barbaric,</p>
<p>although this is done in the controlled setting</p>
<p>of a hospital.</p>
<p>If any of you have seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest,</p>
<p>I think the final scene or near final scene</p>
<p>in that movie was Jack Nicholson</p>
<p>with the sort of bite protector in his mouth</p>
<p>and getting electric shock therapy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as the name suggests,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inducing a global seizure,</p>
<p>either low level or grand mal type seizure</p>
<p>in the patient&rsquo;s brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>And you might ask, well, why would one want to do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that this is a well-established</p>
<p>and in many cases,</p>
<p>very effective treatment for major depression.</p>
<p>Electric shock therapy is generally used</p>
<p>for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>So these are people that have no positive response</p>
<p>or ongoing positive response to drug therapies</p>
<p>or other therapies.</p>
<p>Electric shock therapy is thought to work primarily</p>
<p>by stimulating the massive kind of indiscriminate release</p>
<p>of things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,</p>
<p>a huge variety of neuromodulators,</p>
<p>as well as things like BDNF, brain-derived nootrophic factor,</p>
<p>which then allows neuroplasticity to take place.</p>
<p>Again, BDNF being permissive for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>The problem with ECT is that it&rsquo;s really only useful</p>
<p>for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually target the manic aspects</p>
<p>of bipolar depression and bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but nonetheless is used when drug treatments don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Some of the negatives of electric shock therapy</p>
<p>or electric convulsive therapy, ECT,</p>
<p>is the proper acronym and way it&rsquo;s described,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s quite invasive, right?</p>
<p>This is something that you need to go to the hospital for.</p>
<p>And oftentimes there&rsquo;s some inpatient care required</p>
<p>after the electric convulsive therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fairly high cost,</p>
<p>especially for those that don&rsquo;t have insurance.</p>
<p>And of course it requires anesthesia.</p>
<p>For most people, that&rsquo;s not going to be a problem,</p>
<p>but for many people that could be a problem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s often some associated memory loss.</p>
<p>And so the memory loss,</p>
<p>the invasive nature of ECT and the cost</p>
<p>oftentimes rule out ECT for most patients.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s sort of a late stage</p>
<p>or kind of last resort type thing</p>
<p>for treatment resistant depression.</p>
<p>Nowadays, ketamine type therapy is done repeatedly</p>
<p>or other treatments, for instance,</p>
<p>transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>which is basically non-invasive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a coil that&rsquo;s placed on the outside of the skull,</p>
<p>excuse me, and we can more accurately refer to it</p>
<p>as repetitive or RTMS,</p>
<p>repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool</p>
<p>that allows researchers and clinicians</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of activity in specific neural circuits</p>
<p>so they can actually target the magnetic field</p>
<p>to particular neural circuits</p>
<p>to reduce activity in those neural circuits.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s minimally invasive.</p>
<p>It has been shown to be effective</p>
<p>in both increasing neuroplasticity in positive ways,</p>
<p>as well as reducing depressive episodes.</p>
<p>And in a few instances in reducing the amplitude</p>
<p>or the intensity of manic episodes</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s still a very early technique.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of clinics and labs doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to see more advertisements,</p>
<p>literally commercial clinics</p>
<p>that are advertising RTMS or TMS.</p>
<p>I encourage you to approach those clinics with caution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the mind that if those clinics</p>
<p>are not either closely</p>
<p>or maybe even distantly associated</p>
<p>with a research institution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really up on the latest of RTMS,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be wise to at least do your research, right?</p>
<p>And explore, talk to other patients</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done these treatments.</p>
<p>But certainly in university hospitals</p>
<p>and in clinical settings and research settings,</p>
<p>RTMS is being used as a way to, for instance,</p>
<p>reduce the activity of certain limbic circuitries</p>
<p>so that people are just overall less excitable in manic</p>
<p>or to activate,</p>
<p>because it can also be used for activation now,</p>
<p>certain neural circuits,</p>
<p>activate, for instance, the parietal inputs,</p>
<p>the top-down control over the limbic system.</p>
<p>This is all happening right now.</p>
<p>So we have ECT, repetitive TMS or RTMS.</p>
<p>And then, as I mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies,</p>
<p>most of those are targeted</p>
<p>toward the depressive aspects of manic depression.</p>
<p>So for people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t include depression,</p>
<p>those are going to be less effective.</p>
<p>But overall, it&rsquo;s going to be the talk therapies</p>
<p>of the sort that we discussed earlier or a moment ago,</p>
<p>plus drug treatments,</p>
<p>almost always lithium will be explored,</p>
<p>plus some treatments for the depressive episodes</p>
<p>in particular, if those depressive episodes are present.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about psilocybin,</p>
<p>which is a psychedelic.</p>
<p>In the US, psilocybin is still illegal.</p>
<p>It is not legal,</p>
<p>meaning you can get in a lot of trouble for possessing it,</p>
<p>certainly for selling it, et cetera.</p>
<p>But psilocybin is being explored as a clinical therapy</p>
<p>in certain laboratory settings,</p>
<p>in particular at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being explored in human patients</p>
<p>for the treatment of major depression,</p>
<p>for OCD, I believe, as well,</p>
<p>but certainly for major depression and for eating disorders.</p>
<p>And it seems from the initial wave of publications</p>
<p>from that work done by the incredible Matthew Johnson</p>
<p>or Dr. Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>who was a guest on this podcast before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also been on the Tim Ferriss podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast</p>
<p>and talked about some of the work with psilocybin</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>Very impressive results there.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine,</p>
<p>very impressive results for the major depressive episodes</p>
<p>for bipolar.</p>
<p>However, at least to my knowledge, again, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>there have not been any controlled clinical trials</p>
<p>exploring psilocybin for the mania</p>
<p>associated with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>If someone out there is aware of those clinical trials,</p>
<p>please let me know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do an update in a future podcast.</p>
<p>But right now, no knowledge from me</p>
<p>about psilocybin clinical trials</p>
<p>for the manic component of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>A number of people are probably also going to wonder about</p>
<p>whether or not cannabis or medical marijuana</p>
<p>is useful for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>To address this, I looked to some previous lectures</p>
<p>and some clinicians at Stanford Psychiatry.</p>
<p>This question was asked of them.</p>
<p>And as it turns out,</p>
<p>cannabis does not seem to be effective</p>
<p>for the treatment of the manic phases of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or for the treatment of the major depressive component.</p>
<p>The only treatment perhaps,</p>
<p>or I should say the only situation perhaps</p>
<p>in which it might be useful,</p>
<p>and this is what was relayed to me,</p>
<p>is that it may help with sleep in certain people</p>
<p>that are having trouble with insomnia.</p>
<p>Although nowadays it&rsquo;s far more common</p>
<p>for people in manic episodes to be prescribed things</p>
<p>like trazodone or other benzos, benzodiazepines,</p>
<p>in order to try and get sleep within the manic episodes.</p>
<p>And benzodiazepines and trazodone, et cetera,</p>
<p>work largely through the so-called GABA system.</p>
<p>This is a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that causes reductions in excitability of neurons,</p>
<p>hence why it&rsquo;s being used to try and calm people down</p>
<p>and allow them to sleep during their manic episodes.</p>
<p>So not a lot or essentially no data</p>
<p>supporting the use of cannabis</p>
<p>for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se,</p>
<p>nor data supporting the use of psilocybin</p>
<p>for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se.</p>
<p>But I realized as I say that,</p>
<p>that there are going to be a number of people</p>
<p>that may have had positive or negative experiences</p>
<p>with cannabis or psilocybin</p>
<p>as they relate to bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So please, if you&rsquo;re willing or comfortable,</p>
<p>put that if you&rsquo;re comfortable</p>
<p>into the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>And of course, if you are aware of any studies</p>
<p>on cannabis or psilocybin showing positive outcomes</p>
<p>for the treatment of bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>please provide links or PubMed ideas to those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to peruse those studies.</p>
<p>There are two naturopathic,</p>
<p>or I should say nutrition supplement-based approaches</p>
<p>to bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>They get talked about a lot.</p>
<p>And one of them shows some interesting promise</p>
<p>or effectiveness even in a limited context.</p>
<p>Before marching into this description</p>
<p>of these two compounds,</p>
<p>in fact, before even mentioning these two compounds,</p>
<p>I do want to emphasize what&rsquo;s been said</p>
<p>and written about over and over again,</p>
<p>and what was relayed to me from expert psychiatrists.</p>
<p>It is not wise to rely purely on talk therapy</p>
<p>or on natural approaches to the treatment</p>
<p>of bipolar disorder, given the intensity of the disorder</p>
<p>and the high propensity for suicide risk</p>
<p>in people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>It is a chemical and neural circuit disruption,</p>
<p>and it needs to be dealt with head-on</p>
<p>through the appropriate chemistry</p>
<p>and prescription drug approaches</p>
<p>from a board-certified psychiatrist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this to protect me.</p>
<p>I say this truly to protect those who either suffer from</p>
<p>or think they may suffer from bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>or if you know someone who you think might suffer</p>
<p>from a bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Now, all that is not to say</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t useful lifestyle interventions</p>
<p>that can support people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So I just briefly want to mention those.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m lifting the statements I&rsquo;m about to make</p>
<p>from some excellent online lectures</p>
<p>from psychiatrists at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>which essentially say that, of course, of course, of course,</p>
<p>getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise,</p>
<p>getting proper nutrition,</p>
<p>having quality, healthy social interactions,</p>
<p>even getting regular sunlight in the day</p>
<p>and avoiding bright light at night,</p>
<p>all of those things are going to braid together</p>
<p>to support the nervous system and the psyche of somebody</p>
<p>with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>But they braid together to support the psyche</p>
<p>and the neurochemistry and the neural circuits</p>
<p>of anybody and everybody.</p>
<p>So they have generally a modulatory effect.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re indirectly shifting the likelihood</p>
<p>that somebody might have an episode</p>
<p>or the intensity of an episode,</p>
<p>in particular, the depressive episodes, right?</p>
<p>You can imagine how someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s heading into a depressive episode,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re on a lower amount of medication</p>
<p>or they haven&rsquo;t yet medicated</p>
<p>for the depressive episode of bipolar.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re making sure,</p>
<p>or their family is making sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting exercise, sunshine,</p>
<p>eating correctly, social engagement, et cetera.</p>
<p>Of course, it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>why they would have perhaps a shallower drop</p>
<p>into depression or maybe an offset of depressive episode.</p>
<p>That said, most all, if not all people</p>
<p>with bipolar disorder are likely</p>
<p>to need some sort of drug therapy intervention</p>
<p>in order to help them.</p>
<p>So lifestyle factors are always important</p>
<p>in all individuals,</p>
<p>though suffering from psychiatric conditions or not.</p>
<p>But in some conditions of the mind and body,</p>
<p>those lifestyle interventions can have a greater effect</p>
<p>in offsetting symptoms,</p>
<p>whereas in bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s naive and in fact wrong</p>
<p>to say that lifestyle interventions alone</p>
<p>are going to prevent especially the extreme forms</p>
<p>of mania and depression.</p>
<p>Again, bipolar disorder being so serious</p>
<p>and carrying such high suicide risk,</p>
<p>we just have to point this out again and again.</p>
<p>Now, with that said, there are two substances</p>
<p>generally found as supplements,</p>
<p>although there are other sources of them as well,</p>
<p>including within nutritional sources</p>
<p>that have been shown, at least in some studies,</p>
<p>to be pretty effective</p>
<p>in adjusting the symptoms of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And those two things are inositol and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Now, inositol is a compound</p>
<p>that is taken for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve talked about on the podcast before.</p>
<p>I personally take inositol</p>
<p>not because I have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>In fact, I am quite lucky</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t have bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but I take inositol at 900 milligrams of myoinositol</p>
<p>every third night or so in order to improve my sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve added to my sleep stack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I found greatly enhances</p>
<p>the depth and quality of my sleep.</p>
<p>And if I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the bathroom, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s greatly enhanced my ability to fall back asleep</p>
<p>when I want to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>It also seems to have a fairly potent</p>
<p>anti-anxiety effect during the day.</p>
<p>And as I discussed in our episode</p>
<p>about obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>inositol has been used at high dosages.</p>
<p>Again, I should say myoinositol has been used</p>
<p>at high dosages, levels of even 10, 18 grams.</p>
<p>Those are massive dosages, by the way,</p>
<p>to deal with certain symptoms of OCD to limited success.</p>
<p>And I should mention that high dosages</p>
<p>of 10 or 18 grams of inositol</p>
<p>can cause a lot of gastric discomfort, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about inositol</p>
<p>and its various uses, I encourage you to go to examine.com</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the so-called human effect matrix</p>
<p>and that human effects matrix will describe</p>
<p>the many places in which myoinositol</p>
<p>and other forms of inositol have been shown to be effective</p>
<p>in, for instance, reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>Myoinositol is important because myoinositol,</p>
<p>and we can just say inositol,</p>
<p>is related to so-called second messenger pathways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep</p>
<p>into second messenger pathways,</p>
<p>but when certain substances bind,</p>
<p>like neurotransmitters to a receptor on a cell surface,</p>
<p>oftentimes those receptors themselves will open</p>
<p>and allow the passage of ions and other things into a cell.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they will engage</p>
<p>what are called second messenger systems.</p>
<p>That is, they will trigger mechanisms within the cell</p>
<p>to then go do other things.</p>
<p>This is probably something we should get into</p>
<p>in real detail in a future episode</p>
<p>for those of you that really want to nerd out</p>
<p>on cell-cell signaling, which is a favorite topic of mine.</p>
<p>In any case, inositol is related</p>
<p>to a number of so-called second messenger systems,</p>
<p>this handoff or this kind of stimulating</p>
<p>of changes within a cell that can inspire changes</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called the membrane fluidity,</p>
<p>can actually make the membranes of cells,</p>
<p>the outside fence around a cell,</p>
<p>which is made up of fatty stuff,</p>
<p>it can change the fluidity,</p>
<p>meaning how readily things can float around in the membrane.</p>
<p>You know, we think of cells as very rigid,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a cell, there&rsquo;s a neuron,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a immune cell,</p>
<p>but actually those cells have a fatty outside,</p>
<p>in particular, neurons have a fatty outside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thin, fatty outside,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called the cell membrane,</p>
<p>and things are floating around in that cell membrane,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like jello that hasn&rsquo;t quite fixed,</p>
<p>and so things like receptors moving into the synapse</p>
<p>or moving out of the synapse for homeostatic plasticity,</p>
<p>things like the ability for certain genes</p>
<p>to be turned on in a cell or not turned on</p>
<p>can depend a lot on things that are happening</p>
<p>in that cell membrane and how readily things move around</p>
<p>in the cell membrane.</p>
<p>One way to think about</p>
<p>this whole picture of membrane fluidity</p>
<p>is that just imagine that every one of your cells</p>
<p>has this layer, it&rsquo;s kind of a gelatinous-like layer,</p>
<p>and there are lots of little rafts floating around in there,</p>
<p>but those rafts are able to move more quickly</p>
<p>from one place to another</p>
<p>or get more stuck in one place or another,</p>
<p>depending on how set that jello is.</p>
<p>Inositol and lithium,</p>
<p>and as we&rsquo;ll talk about next,</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids seem to change</p>
<p>the fluidity of those membranes.</p>
<p>In other words, they allow things to move in</p>
<p>and out of those membranes more readily or not,</p>
<p>and this is no surprise,</p>
<p>given that those membranes are made out of fatty stuff.</p>
<p>In particular, the membranes of neurons</p>
<p>are called a lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two layers of fat.</p>
<p>Okay, bi means two, lipid, fat,</p>
<p>and omega-3 fatty acids of the sort</p>
<p>that are found in certain fish,</p>
<p>and that fatty fish in particular,</p>
<p>and that are found in fish oil and cod liver oil, et cetera,</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them,</p>
<p>are used for a lot of different things,</p>
<p>but they can be readily incorporated into pathways</p>
<p>or directly incorporated into cell membranes,</p>
<p>changing the way those cell membranes work,</p>
<p>and if those cell membranes</p>
<p>are the cell membranes of neurons,</p>
<p>changing the way that neurons work.</p>
<p>So the ability for fish oil,</p>
<p>and in particular, the omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>which come in varieties like EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment,</p>
<p>have been explored at relatively high dosages</p>
<p>for their ability to offset some of the effects of mania</p>
<p>and to offset the effects of depressive episodes</p>
<p>in bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>and actually, the data there are pretty impressive,</p>
<p>although they are varied,</p>
<p>meaning you will find several studies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll mention a few,</p>
<p>that found no effect of omega-3 supplementation</p>
<p>through fish oil.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s capsuled fish oil,</p>
<p>although fish oil can also be taken in liquid form.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, taking in liquid form</p>
<p>is the more cost-efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>Taking in capsule form is the more palatable way to do it,</p>
<p>because fish oil, for a lot of people, doesn&rsquo;t taste good,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, there are several studies</p>
<p>that have shown that supplementing with fish oil</p>
<p>or omega-3 fatty acids at levels of, for instance,</p>
<p>four grams per day for a period of time,</p>
<p>this is a study that we will link in the show notes,</p>
<p>this is Murphy et al. 2012,</p>
<p>this is a fatty acid supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA,</p>
<p>actually worsened symptoms of mania</p>
<p>over a period of about 16 weeks,</p>
<p>which on the face of it makes it seem like,</p>
<p>okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,</p>
<p>very likely to not be good for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>and yet, that was the manic phase.</p>
<p>When one looks at some of the other studies</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,</p>
<p>there is, for instance, a study published in 1999,</p>
<p>this is a much higher dosage supplementation</p>
<p>with omega-3 fatty acid,</p>
<p>this is a 9.6 grams of fish oil per day for four months,</p>
<p>and that actually greatly reduced symptoms</p>
<p>of bipolar depression compared to the control group,</p>
<p>which received olive oil,</p>
<p>olive oil is a different form of fat,</p>
<p>monounsaturated fat,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t contain as much of the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>So 9.6 grams of fish oil per day over four months</p>
<p>is a lot of fish oil to be ingesting on a given day.</p>
<p>This was a double-blind study,</p>
<p>this was only carried out, I should mention, in 30 subjects,</p>
<p>but it was males and females,</p>
<p>and the age range was pretty broad,</p>
<p>anywhere from 18 all the way up to 64 years of age,</p>
<p>which is important given the sort of longitudinal</p>
<p>or changes over time that one sees in bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the major takeaway.</p>
<p>Supplementing with high-dose omega-3s</p>
<p>does seem to be beneficial for a good number of people</p>
<p>with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>However, again, I want to highlight,</p>
<p>however, it should not be viewed</p>
<p>as the only treatment approach for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>This goes back to what I was saying before</p>
<p>about the essential need in most every case</p>
<p>for high-potency prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>prescribed by a board-certified psychiatrist</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>However, omega-3 supplementation does seem to improve</p>
<p>or reduce the depressive symptoms</p>
<p>in the major depressive episodes of bipolar,</p>
<p>and there are a couple of studies,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll link to these in the show notes as well,</p>
<p>that show that it may even improve</p>
<p>some of the manic episodes as well,</p>
<p>meaning it reduces some of the manic symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, I say all this from a place of great caution</p>
<p>because I know, especially for listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in the behavioral tools,</p>
<p>the supplement-based tools, the nutrition tools</p>
<p>that can support bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I can overemphasize enough</p>
<p>that especially for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and the great risk of suicide and suffering</p>
<p>and inappropriate spending,</p>
<p>or I should say maladaptive spending and impulsivity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a scenario</p>
<p>in which just talk therapy and fish oil</p>
<p>and lifestyle interventions are going to completely suppress</p>
<p>or treat bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>People with bipolar disorder really need to consider</p>
<p>the full picture of treatments, the drug treatments,</p>
<p>the talk therapy treatments and lifestyle treatments</p>
<p>and nutraceutical, or we can say supplement-based treatments</p>
<p>such as omega-3 supplementation,</p>
<p>as a full and necessary picture</p>
<p>for dealing with their illness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss, however, if I didn&rsquo;t emphasize</p>
<p>that the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation</p>
<p>is very interesting,</p>
<p>not just in terms of the subjective effects,</p>
<p>people saying they feel less depressed</p>
<p>or able to sleep better,</p>
<p>or maybe even some reduction in manic symptoms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually been some really good brain imaging</p>
<p>to try and understand how omega-3 fatty acid treatments</p>
<p>are actually changing the brains and neural circuits</p>
<p>of people with bipolar.</p>
<p>And I will put a reference to this.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published</p>
<p>in the American Journal of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entitled Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment</p>
<p>and T2 Whole Brain Relaxation Times in Bipolar Disorder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the opportunity</p>
<p>to go into a lot of detail right now</p>
<p>about what T2 whole brain relaxation times are,</p>
<p>but basically when people go into a MRI</p>
<p>or f-functional MRI scanner,</p>
<p>magnetic resonant imaging scanner,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re getting essentially</p>
<p>is pulses of magnetic fields.</p>
<p>And the way that brain structures</p>
<p>and neural activity can be evaluated</p>
<p>has a lot to do with the sort of spinning,</p>
<p>or not sort of, it has to do with the spinning</p>
<p>and the relaxation times of different elements,</p>
<p>literally the protons and electrons within the neurons.</p>
<p>So it gets really detailed there.</p>
<p>And the relaxation time is essentially looking</p>
<p>at how quickly some of that spinning returns to rest.</p>
<p>And in particular, the fact that the relaxation times</p>
<p>are different for aqueous, that is liquid,</p>
<p>versus lipid, fatty,</p>
<p>versus other components of brain tissue.</p>
<p>And basically what this study shows</p>
<p>is that the membranes of neurons within the brains</p>
<p>of these people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>showed more fluidity, more ability of things</p>
<p>to move in and around the membranes,</p>
<p>which we know is an important component of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>in bipolar subjects that were treated</p>
<p>with omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>as compared to bipolar subjects</p>
<p>that did not receive omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>And fortunately, this study also include</p>
<p>a healthy comparison group</p>
<p>where they could essentially find</p>
<p>that people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>who supplemented with omega-3s</p>
<p>had changes at the cellular level</p>
<p>and the neural circuit level</p>
<p>that brought their brains and neural circuits</p>
<p>closer to that of the healthy comparison subjects.</p>
<p>So while I don&rsquo;t want to point</p>
<p>to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation</p>
<p>as the be-all end-all of treatment for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>certainly it is not,</p>
<p>it does have a strong mechanistic basis</p>
<p>for its possible support of neural circuitry,</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and in particular, the ability to make changes</p>
<p>in cell membranes that are very reminiscent</p>
<p>of some of the neural circuit changes</p>
<p>and changes in membrane fluidity</p>
<p>that are seen with lithium treatment</p>
<p>and other known prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>that have been established now for decades</p>
<p>to be very effective for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So what that says is that omega-3 supplementation,</p>
<p>while not the only intervention that one should consider,</p>
<p>is something to consider and talk about with your doctor,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s operating in powerful ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s changing, for instance,</p>
<p>your gut microbiome, which is powerful,</p>
<p>but is indirect to the brain.</p>
<p>It does seem to be having direct effects</p>
<p>on neurons and neural circuits.</p>
<p>Before we begin to conclude our discussion</p>
<p>about bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I want to talk a little bit about this word disorder.</p>
<p>And this is a theme that doesn&rsquo;t just relate</p>
<p>to bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but other psychiatric disorders as well.</p>
<p>And when we think of a disorder,</p>
<p>we think of something that is really detrimental to us,</p>
<p>something that really impairs our ability</p>
<p>to function in work and school and relationships</p>
<p>and really starts to pull down our health status</p>
<p>in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>And certainly, bipolar disorder meets those criteria.</p>
<p>However, there is this idea</p>
<p>that things like bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>even things like schizophrenia in some cases,</p>
<p>are responsible for some of the creative aspects</p>
<p>or the creative works that have been observed</p>
<p>and carried out by human beings for many centuries.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>there are good data to support the fact</p>
<p>that certain aspects of mania</p>
<p>are associated with creativity.</p>
<p>Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity,</p>
<p>its neural circuit basis, its chemical basis</p>
<p>here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And certainly, we will have that conversation.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly touch upon this idea</p>
<p>that certain occupations are associated</p>
<p>with a higher incidence of bipolar depression.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s been explored at a research level.</p>
<p>Really, there are data pointed to the fact</p>
<p>that certain individuals of certain occupations</p>
<p>tend to be more creative</p>
<p>and that creativity is associated with,</p>
<p>again, associated, this isn&rsquo;t causal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s associated or correlated with higher levels</p>
<p>or incidence of bipolar depression</p>
<p>and maybe even other forms of depression.</p>
<p>So this is a study looking at mood disorders</p>
<p>in eminent individuals.</p>
<p>So these are people that are not just good at what they do,</p>
<p>but are exceptional at what they do</p>
<p>and explored the percentage of people in given professions</p>
<p>with either depression or mania.</p>
<p>And this was actually a dataset gleaned</p>
<p>from more than 1,000 20th century Westerners</p>
<p>based on their biographies that were reviewed</p>
<p>by other people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of an indirect measurement.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t psychiatrist data.</p>
<p>This is data, or I should say, these are data</p>
<p>that were compiled from self-reports</p>
<p>or from reads of self-reports.</p>
<p>And they explored a number of different professions.</p>
<p>So for instance, they looked at people in the military</p>
<p>or people who were professional athletes</p>
<p>or natural scientists or social scientists,</p>
<p>people who occupied positions in public office</p>
<p>or were musical performers, artists,</p>
<p>nonfiction writers, poetry, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are a lot of professions here.</p>
<p>I will post this or I&rsquo;ll post a link to it</p>
<p>in the show note captions for you to peruse,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just give you a sense of the extremes</p>
<p>on this graph because they&rsquo;re very interesting.</p>
<p>Turns out that if you were to look at the profession,</p>
<p>or I should say among the professions they looked at</p>
<p>in this study, because they didn&rsquo;t look at all professions,</p>
<p>those in the military and those who are professional</p>
<p>athletes or had jobs in the social or natural sciences</p>
<p>had the, of those, there was a lower percentage</p>
<p>of those that had depression or mania.</p>
<p>In some cases, like those who are professional athletes</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t seem to have, there was no incidence of mania,</p>
<p>at least in this data set.</p>
<p>Whereas at the opposite extreme of the graph,</p>
<p>those that were poets, so these are eminent individuals,</p>
<p>people that were exceptional poets,</p>
<p>exceptional fiction writers, exceptional artists</p>
<p>or nonfiction writers, well, there,</p>
<p>especially for the poets, you find that as many as 90%</p>
<p>of these very successful poets had either depression</p>
<p>or mania, as high as 90%, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Contrast that with military where it&rsquo;s as few as 10%</p>
<p>or professional athletes where it&rsquo;s as few as 20%.</p>
<p>And for the professional athletes, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>none of them had mania.</p>
<p>So does this mean that being a poet will make you manic</p>
<p>or depressed?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, let&rsquo;s look at the poetry category.</p>
<p>It turns out that 75% of these eminent poets,</p>
<p>these highly accomplished poets had major depression.</p>
<p>Whereas only about 20% of those poets had manic episodes.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s not that being a poet</p>
<p>is going to give you mania.</p>
<p>Certainly we&rsquo;re not saying that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that being a poet is going to give you depression,</p>
<p>but it turns out that people with depression</p>
<p>and people with depression and mania</p>
<p>seem to gravitate towards poetry</p>
<p>or at least are very successful at poetry.</p>
<p>Again, associative, correlative, no causal relationship here</p>
<p>but it is really striking to see how</p>
<p>the creative occupations, poetry, fiction, art,</p>
<p>nonfiction writing, even though nonfiction writing</p>
<p>is about nonfiction, it&rsquo;s still creative,</p>
<p>music, composition, theater,</p>
<p>much higher incidence of things like mania.</p>
<p>And in fact, for the people in theater, the actors,</p>
<p>even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania</p>
<p>is lower than that in poets,</p>
<p>the fraction of those individuals that have mania</p>
<p>is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 30% of those that they looked at</p>
<p>who are actors have manic episodes or have full-blown mania.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m referring to these data because first of all,</p>
<p>I find them incredibly interesting, right?</p>
<p>Up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects.</p>
<p>And again, they&rsquo;re extremely maladaptive,</p>
<p>much, much higher incidence of suicide, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;d be wrong to say that certain aspects</p>
<p>of manic episodes don&rsquo;t lend themselves well to creativity</p>
<p>or that certain aspects of major depression</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t lend themselves well to creativity</p>
<p>or to the performing arts or to poetry.</p>
<p>That said, in no way, shape or form,</p>
<p>do I believe that being depressed is a good thing</p>
<p>or that being manic is a good thing.</p>
<p>Again, we return to the basic foundational criteria</p>
<p>for bipolar disorder and major depression,</p>
<p>which is that the pressured speech, the not sleeping,</p>
<p>the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas</p>
<p>are generally not going to lead,</p>
<p>or I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>are not going to lead to good places.</p>
<p>In fact, often lead to bad places.</p>
<p>But we would also be wrong if we didn&rsquo;t consider the fact</p>
<p>that there is a somewhat inextricable relationship</p>
<p>between mania and creativity.</p>
<p>And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania,</p>
<p>maybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>of composing or writing poetry,</p>
<p>maybe even some of the lows that we feel, right?</p>
<p>Some of the sadness, some of the grief,</p>
<p>some of the nostalgia that we feel,</p>
<p>provided that it&rsquo;s not pathologic,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not persistent for the four or seven days</p>
<p>that are diagnostic of bipolar two</p>
<p>and bipolar one disorder respectively.</p>
<p>Well, then we can start to view emotional states</p>
<p>as something that can actually lend themselves</p>
<p>to positive outcomes and maybe even to creativity</p>
<p>and to improved occupations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important that we have a nuanced view</p>
<p>of what sadness versus depression</p>
<p>versus major depression are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that we distinguish between being erratic,</p>
<p>being very energized and full-blown bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And I raise this for another reason as well.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s very common to hear people saying,</p>
<p>oh, you know, that person is OCD.</p>
<p>Well, on the episode about OCD that I did a few weeks back,</p>
<p>that you can find if you like at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>in that episode, I pointed out</p>
<p>that OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>is very maladaptive, right?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s number seven, as I recall,</p>
<p>on the list of debilitating diseases,</p>
<p>all diseases in terms of lost time at work,</p>
<p>suffering relationships, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really serious condition.</p>
<p>And yet we often hear, oh, that person is obsessive.</p>
<p>And as I pointed out,</p>
<p>there is obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>And then there is obsessive compulsive tendencies,</p>
<p>which actually benefit people.</p>
<p>But that is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder</p>
<p>as a clinically diagnosed thing.</p>
<p>Similarly, we hear that, oh, somebody is being bipolar,</p>
<p>or, you know, they&rsquo;re all over the place, they&rsquo;re bipolar.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very subjective</p>
<p>kind of label that people give one another in passing.</p>
<p>More and more often I&rsquo;m hearing this.</p>
<p>And yet bipolar disorder, whether or not it&rsquo;s BP1 or BP2,</p>
<p>are extremely maladaptive</p>
<p>and extremely associated with high suicide risk.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m not here to police people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not the word police</p>
<p>or the nomenclature police,</p>
<p>I do think that whether or not you refer to people as OCD</p>
<p>or as bipolar, et cetera, that&rsquo;s up to you, all right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my place to say.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s important that all of us understand</p>
<p>that these psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>carry with them tremendous maladaptive weight.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve really done a deep dive</p>
<p>into bipolar disorder and to both the manic</p>
<p>and the depressive components that are present</p>
<p>or can be present in bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and the different forms of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and some of the major treatments for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>in particular lithium and its underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>and some of the neural circuit and chemical basis</p>
<p>and neuroplasticity basis</p>
<p>of the treatments for bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>in particular homeostatic scaling or homeostatic plasticity.</p>
<p>All of that, of course, is relevant to bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and I hope will be useful in your understanding</p>
<p>and maybe even in your pursuit of treatments</p>
<p>for bipolar depression,</p>
<p>bipolar disorder for you or other people.</p>
<p>I also hope that it will be useful in your understanding</p>
<p>of how brain circuits work in normal conditions</p>
<p>or in conditions where there is no disease state</p>
<p>or maladaptive conditions.</p>
<p>Homeostatic plasticity is present in all of us.</p>
<p>Membrane fluidity due to how easily things move around</p>
<p>in the surface, the fatty layers on the outside of neurons</p>
<p>and the movement of receptors in and out of neurons,</p>
<p>that is present in all of us.</p>
<p>The influence of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>is central to that discussion,</p>
<p>as is the discussion about various drug treatments</p>
<p>because even if you&rsquo;re not somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taking a drug treatment</p>
<p>or who is pursuing a drug treatment for bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or another psychiatric condition,</p>
<p>your serotonin levels, your dopamine levels,</p>
<p>your acetylcholine levels,</p>
<p>all of these play into what we call your mental</p>
<p>and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, if any of you are interested</p>
<p>in the various categories of neuromodulators</p>
<p>and tools to adjust those neuromodulators</p>
<p>under more standard non-disease conditions,</p>
<p>we did an episode on neurochemicals</p>
<p>and how to control them.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>along with all other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Should mention everything is timestamped</p>
<p>so you can navigate to the specific topics</p>
<p>and tools of interest to you.</p>

<p>and the treatments for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>I do hope you found it beneficial</p>
<p>both for yourself and for others.</p>
<p>I just want to remind people that bipolar disorder</p>
<p>is an extremely serious condition.</p>

<p>on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>Once again, while supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary</p>
<p>for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit</p>
<p>from them for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone support and other aspects of mental</p>
<p>and physical health and performance.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast is happy to announce</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>

<p>We are Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>In both places, I cover science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct</p>
<p>from the information covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely zero cost and it contains summaries</p>
