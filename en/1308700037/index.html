    <p>Our card this week is Irving Schumann, the Five of Diamonds from Arizona.</p>
<p>On a September afternoon in 2008, 84-year-old Irving, a well-known Phoenix real estate developer</p>
<p>and Jewish philanthropist, was firing off some work emails alone in his office when</p>
<p>an intruder burst in.</p>
<p>Irving tried to fight off his attacker in an intense struggle, leaving behind a horrific</p>
<p>crime scene and a mystery that has endured for nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 2nd, 2008, 84-year-old Irving Schumann and his good pal Ethan had</p>
<p>plans to enjoy a fun night out.</p>
<p>The two had a 6 p.m. dinner reservation and tickets to the Broadway show A Chorus Line</p>
<p>at Arizona State&rsquo;s Gammage Theater.</p>
<p>Ethan was first to arrive at the restaurant, but as he waited and waited, there was no</p>
<p>Irving.</p>
<p>When Ethan couldn&rsquo;t reach him on his cell, he tried Irving&rsquo;s house phone, and Therese,</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s longtime girlfriend of 14 years, picked up.</p>
<p>Ethan asked her if Irving had been running late or had forgotten about their plans, but</p>
<p>she said no, Irving wasn&rsquo;t home, and in fact, she hadn&rsquo;t seen him since she&rsquo;d gotten</p>
<p>home from work a few hours ago.</p>
<p>Even more strange, Therese said Ethan wasn&rsquo;t even the first person to call asking where</p>
<p>Irving might be.</p>
<p>One of Irving&rsquo;s grown daughters, who lived out of state, had also just called the house</p>
<p>looking for her father after she couldn&rsquo;t reach him on his cell.</p>
<p>This made Therese uneasy.</p>
<p>She stopped making dinner and glanced down at the kitchen counter, and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>she saw it, Irving&rsquo;s show tickets.</p>
<p>And just like that, her unease turned to alarm.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone at around 6.30, Therese jumped into her car and headed toward</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s office in North Central Phoenix, which is just about like two miles or so</p>
<p>from their house, so she was there in no time.</p>
<p>When she pulled up to the off-white one-story commercial office plaza, which was in front</p>
<p>of a busy intersection and bus stop, the pit in her stomach grew when she realized Irving&rsquo;s</p>
<p>98 gold Lexus was not in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Therese walked into the unlocked office and called out for her partner as she took in</p>
<p>the horror around her.</p>
<p>There was blood smears on furniture.</p>
<p>There was blood on the walls and window blinds.</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s glasses, which he always had on because he couldn&rsquo;t see without them, were</p>
<p>on the floor.</p>
<p>Frantic, Therese continued her search, looking everywhere she could for Irving, but she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find him anywhere, so finally she went to the back end of the office&rsquo;s interior, where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a storage room.</p>
<p>Therese&rsquo;s heart must have been racing as she opened the unlocked door and saw Irving,</p>
<p>who was unresponsive, on the floor, covered in blood.</p>
<p>When Irving didn&rsquo;t respond to her cries, she ran out of the storage room and back through</p>
<p>the bloody crime scene.</p>
<p>Once she was outside, Therese cried and screamed into the phone as she dialed 911.</p>
<p>Some people in neighboring businesses who knew the couple rushed outside and approached</p>
<p>Therese, who was inconsolable.</p>
<p>Post-responders arrived soon after, around 7.15pm, and right away Irving was pronounced</p>
<p>dead.</p>
<p>Irving was in bad shape.</p>
<p>All they could really deduce by looking at him was that he&rsquo;d been hit repeatedly with</p>
<p>some sort of object and he put up a fight.</p>
<p>As far as figuring out what Irving had been beaten with, investigators were stumped because</p>
<p>there was no weapon left at the scene.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Phoenix Police Detective Michelle Cervantes to explain.</p>
<p>Typically, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine if it&rsquo;s not a pattern wound.</p>
<p>So for instance, like a hammer, if you&rsquo;re struck with a hammer, it will leave a pattern</p>
<p>injury and most time the medical examiners will be able to determine what kind of object</p>
<p>was used.</p>
<p>Detective Cervantes wasn&rsquo;t originally assigned to the case, but she&rsquo;s part of the six-person</p>
<p>cold case homicide unit responsible for the investigation today.</p>
<p>Since the attack obviously took place in Irving&rsquo;s workplace, there were definitely some random</p>
<p>office supplies that could theoretically have been used to commit the murder, but none of</p>
<p>them matched the injuries on his body, which were mostly on his head and upper torso.</p>
<p>As a result, there was a lot of blood at the crime scene, and techs needed to figure out</p>
<p>if it was all Irving&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So they swapped blood droplets near the front of the business, on the floor, as well as</p>
<p>smears that were found on walls and on a paper shredder, though they knew that it would be</p>
<p>at least a few weeks until results from the testing could be analyzed, so it would be</p>
<p>important to find potential witnesses to the crime.</p>
<p>Police outside started talking to anyone who might have seen or heard something out of</p>
<p>the ordinary that day, primarily people from other nearby businesses.</p>
<p>Police also worked to get statements from some of Irving&rsquo;s colleagues who had started</p>
<p>to gather there after word spread, and of course, they talked to Therese.</p>
<p>Therese told police that the last time she talked to Irving was around 7 that morning</p>
<p>when she left the house for work.</p>
<p>Now she didn&rsquo;t return home till about 4.30 or 5, and she walked police through her timeline</p>
<p>of fielding the phone calls about Irving&rsquo;s whereabouts, rushing to the office, and finding</p>
<p>his body before calling 911.</p>
<p>In kind of a weird twist, Therese also told the cops that Irving&rsquo;s car was missing, along</p>
<p>with a handgun that he usually kept in the drawer of his desk, when he wasn&rsquo;t carrying</p>
<p>it himself.</p>
<p>Police learned more about Irving as a person.</p>
<p>They were told that he was a loving partner, dad, and grandpa, and everyone said that he</p>
<p>was a warm and comforting presence who had a habit of wearing a fanny pack full of cash,</p>
<p>and he enjoyed giving out $2 bills and $1 gold coins to kids.</p>
<p>Which totally tracks when you consider the fact that between his three kids, who were</p>
<p>grown, he had six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren that he adored.</p>
<p>And the $2 bill thing is just such a grandpa move, it&rsquo;s actually something that my grandpa</p>
<p>used to do when he was alive.</p>
<p>Police also learned that Irving, or Irv, as his friends and family called him, was originally</p>
<p>from Chicago.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy World War II vet relocated to the valley in the 60s and considered himself</p>
<p>a proud Phoenician, which was also evidenced by his fierce devotion to the Suns basketball</p>
<p>team.</p>
<p>Irving himself was in great shape and loved to play racquetball.</p>
<p>Aside from his real estate business, which he&rsquo;d run for 50 years, investigators learned</p>
<p>that he was well-known in philanthropic circles and was super active in the Jewish Community</p>
<p>Foundation of Greater Phoenix.</p>
<p>He had even been awarded the Medal of Honor by the Jewish Federation&rsquo;s Regional Chapter,</p>
<p>which is the highest accolade the group gives out.</p>
<p>So based on what police were gathering about this guy, it was clear that he was someone</p>
<p>who was an incredibly integral and visible part of his faith community.</p>
<p>With that in mind, investigators had to entertain the possibility that maybe this was a murder</p>
<p>driven by anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s employees, who&rsquo;d started to gather at the scene when they heard what happened,</p>
<p>said they didn&rsquo;t know of any bitter clients or sketchy real estate transactions or honestly</p>
<p>anything that might have given someone a motive to do this.</p>
<p>The last employee to see Irving alive that day, again, this is September 2nd, told police</p>
<p>that he left the office at around 2.30 p.m. and that Irving was at his desk sending emails</p>
<p>and he seemed to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>And after that employee left for the day, Irving was on his own.</p>
<p>His employees were forthcoming and helpful.</p>
<p>So they were all immediately ruled out, as were the people who worked in nearby businesses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of those individuals should be looked at as suspects.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re along a busy street.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what that area looked like back in 2008.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking, what, 14 years later?</p>
<p>So things can change.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any reason to believe that any of these nearby businesses that were contacted,</p>
<p>that the employees would lie that they didn&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p>To try and confirm what Irving had been doing when his killer busted in, police pulled</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s work emails.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he had sent a flurry of emails between 2.15 p.m. and 4.15 p.m.</p>
<p>Which made investigators think that whoever killed him probably entered the office between</p>
<p>4.15 and 6.45, which is roughly around the time that Therese pulled up to check on him.</p>
<p>Police went through each and every correspondence that he sent, but they didn&rsquo;t find anything</p>
<p>weird or suspicious.</p>
<p>In fact, other than the large amount of blood, the only thing about the crime or the scene</p>
<p>itself that really stuck out to police was the fact that Irving&rsquo;s car, along with his</p>
<p>leather fanny pack of cash and his handgun and his gold coins, were all missing.</p>
<p>Which made them wonder if Irving was the victim of a robbery turned homicide.</p>
<p>Perhaps the killer took advantage of an elderly man alone in a business at the end of a workday.</p>
<p>But where do you go with that?</p>
<p>When a crime is potentially totally random, where do you start?</p>
<p>Well, lucky for investigators, two days after Irving&rsquo;s body was found, a call comes in</p>
<p>that tells them exactly where to start.</p>
<p>The call came in at around 2 a.m. and it was police in San Bernardino, California on the</p>
<p>other end of the line.</p>
<p>They basically said, hey, one of our traffic cops ran plates on a 98 gold Lexus and it</p>
<p>came up as stolen.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you know, when we tried to pull them over, they actually tried to take</p>
<p>off but ended up crashing.</p>
<p>And long story short, we got these two guys detained if you want to come talk to them.</p>
<p>And absolutely, they wanted to talk to them.</p>
<p>Detectives wasted no time and immediately hightailed it to San Bernardino, about a five-hour</p>
<p>drive west.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where they met with the officers involved in the traffic stop.</p>
<p>San Bernardino police debriefed their Arizona counterparts about how they made the stop</p>
<p>in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>They said the two people in the car were both 30-something men who local police were</p>
<p>familiar with because they had a history of drug-related charges.</p>
<p>And in fact, the two seemed to be under the influence of something when the car was pulled</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>Detectives were hopeful that these guys might hold the answers to solving Irving&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But what San Bernardino police told them next made them less sure.</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Daily Breeze newspaper, they told them that Irving&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Lexus had been seen frequently over the last two days near an area in and around a Greyhound</p>
<p>bus station on 6th and G Streets.</p>
<p>This is adjacent to some, like, small hotels.</p>
<p>Detective Cervantes said that the two men stole the car from the parking lot of the</p>
<p>Economy Inn on West 6th Street the day before.</p>
<p>The men told police that the keys were just, like, straight up on the ground near the car,</p>
<p>as if someone dropped them.</p>
<p>But the men say that they didn&rsquo;t know whose car it was.</p>
<p>And they were adamant that they were in no way associated with whoever stole it first.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;d only driven the car around for maybe half a day or so before they were</p>
<p>picked up by police.</p>
<p>So even though this seems like maybe it&rsquo;s a dead end, the accused car thieves did change</p>
<p>the course of the investigation with what they did share with police.</p>
<p>According to Detective Cervantes, when they finally spoke with them directly, the men</p>
<p>told investigators that word on the street was, prior to them stealing it, the car was</p>
<p>being driven by a transient man who ditched it at one of the hotels and boarded a Greyhound</p>
<p>bus out of the area as recently as September 3rd, which is just the day before.</p>
<p>Police continued to question the accused California car thieves about their whereabouts from the</p>
<p>past two days.</p>
<p>But the pair insisted they were just joyriding and they had nothing to do with any murder.</p>
<p>In the end, police were able to vouch for the fact that these guys were both in San</p>
<p>Bernardino on September 2nd and hadn&rsquo;t been anywhere else in the days since, certainly</p>
<p>not Phoenix.</p>
<p>Investigators also couldn&rsquo;t find any real connection for either men back to Arizona.</p>
<p>Now even if these men didn&rsquo;t seem to be who they were looking for, police definitely weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leaving San Bernardino empty handed.</p>
<p>Phoenix and San Bernardino worked together to process the car, which is how they came</p>
<p>upon another possible clue.</p>
<p>They came up with partial fingerprints that belonged to someone who was in Irving, and</p>
<p>not just in one place, they were all throughout the car.</p>
<p>On the rear view mirror, on the gear shift, on the outside of the gas cover.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the prints and any touch DNA that they got belonged to the two men</p>
<p>who were accused of stealing the car after the suspect.</p>
<p>So this really didn&rsquo;t move the needle at all for police.</p>
<p>Before they hit the road back to Arizona, Phoenix police paid a visit to the hotels</p>
<p>in the area near the Greyhound station to see if they could turn up any info about the</p>
<p>transient man who supposedly been getting around in Irving&rsquo;s Lexus.</p>
<p>But considering they didn&rsquo;t exactly know who they were looking for, their efforts didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>turn up anything solid to run with.</p>
<p>In a September 5th, 2008 article in the Arizona Republic newspaper, Danielle Schumann-Heller,</p>
<p>one of Irving&rsquo;s three grown children, was quoted saying,</p>
<p>We are thrilled they found the car, and hope it will lead to finding out who did this to</p>
<p>our father.</p>
<p>Our greatest concern, other than laying our father to rest and giving him a fitting funeral,</p>
<p>is finding out who did this to him.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 5th, Irving&rsquo;s family members held a funeral and services for a man who,</p>
<p>by all accounts, was a giant in the community.</p>
<p>In no time at all, an online guestbook attached to Irving&rsquo;s obituary attracted dozens and</p>
<p>dozens of entries from all over as loved ones mourned.</p>
<p>They reminisced about Irving excitedly talking basketball over shared Shabbat meals, about</p>
<p>how Irving still took the time each week to call his 94-year-old aunt just to check</p>
<p>in, about how he, quote, was just a ridiculously likable guy.</p>
<p>Someone also wrote,</p>
<p>You will always be remembered by me as a man with a kind heart, a strong sense of justice,</p>
<p>and a soul filled with kindness.</p>
<p>By September 12th, about two weeks after the case agents returned to Phoenix, Irving&rsquo;s</p>
<p>autopsy findings, as well as the results from blood swabs taken at the crime scene,</p>
<p>came back.</p>
<p>The medical examiner concluded that Irving&rsquo;s cause of death was a result of blunt force</p>
<p>trauma and strangulation.</p>
<p>It still wasn&rsquo;t clear, though, what kind of object Irving was beaten with.</p>
<p>As for the blood found throughout the business, it mostly belonged to Irving.</p>
<p>And while the lab results indicated that there were some foreign profiles in the submitted</p>
<p>samples, there weren&rsquo;t enough markers in any of them to submit to CODIS.</p>
<p>Despite the promising momentum at the front end of the investigation, police started to</p>
<p>hit a wall after about three weeks of legwork.</p>
<p>Then months later, an officer accidentally stumbled upon a new lead in the case.</p>
<p>On November 19th of 2008, a Phoenix patrol officer came across a man who was asleep at</p>
<p>a bus stop in front of Irving&rsquo;s workplace.</p>
<p>Now the man was local, but didn&rsquo;t have a place to live full time, and Phoenix has a law on</p>
<p>the books that makes it a crime to sleep in a city-owned space, so the guy was actually</p>
<p>arrested.</p>
<p>And this was a guy who was also known to police.</p>
<p>He had a history of drug and weapons-related offenses and was known to regularly hang out</p>
<p>in the parking lots and surrounding areas behind the bus stop.</p>
<p>Despite the man being arrested in a public space, Detective Cervantes declined to provide</p>
<p>us with his name and referred to him only by his initials, D.A.</p>
<p>According to the detective, though, the officer who arrested and booked D.A. got to talking</p>
<p>with this guy and was asking him what he&rsquo;d been up to lately.</p>
<p>D.A. told police that he&rsquo;d taken a trip relatively recently to visit some friends</p>
<p>in San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Investigator&rsquo;s interest was officially piqued, especially considering D.A. couldn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>them the exact dates of his trip, nor could he say how he even got there.</p>
<p>He originally said he flew to California, but that story fell apart when he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even say what airline he traveled with or provide any kind of trip confirmation.</p>
<p>Then D.A. relented and was like, oh, okay, I was just confused and I actually took the</p>
<p>bus there.</p>
<p>More specifically, he told police he&rsquo;d taken a Greyhound to and from San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Now, even though D.A. supposedly couldn&rsquo;t recall the exact dates he traveled, officers</p>
<p>had something to work with.</p>
<p>Since police knew D.A. and where he tended to loiter, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to infer</p>
<p>when he skipped town, so investigators were able to figure out the approximate timeframe</p>
<p>of his trip and that it was likely in the first week of September, based on when he</p>
<p>was and wasn&rsquo;t known to be hanging around the bus stop and the plaza parking lot.</p>
<p>So police were extremely curious to learn more about what specifically took D.A. out</p>
<p>to San Bernardino around the time a local murder victim&rsquo;s car was found in the same</p>
<p>city.</p>
<p>But it also wasn&rsquo;t lost on investigators who were working the murder that pretty much</p>
<p>all of this information was circumstantial, no matter how incriminating.</p>
<p>That is, until police compared the items that were found on D.A. during his arrest with</p>
<p>a list of known missing items from the crime scene.</p>
<p>And get this, on D.A.&rsquo;s person, police found multiple golden dollars and a $2 bill,</p>
<p>just like the ones Irving used to gift to kids.</p>
<p>And they also found a couple hundred in cash, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been uncommon for the</p>
<p>84-year-old to be carrying in a fanny pack that he usually wore.</p>
<p>Now the fanny pack itself and the gun, however, were not found on D.A., but what they did</p>
<p>find was enough for police to consider him their lead person of interest.</p>
<p>When he was asked about where these items had come from and how he got them, D.A. stopped</p>
<p>cooperating with investigators altogether and he refused to answer any more questions.</p>
<p>So they had to release D.A.</p>
<p>With this individual, I did not run across any reports indicating that they attempted</p>
<p>to contact him again.</p>
<p>When our reporter asked Detective Cervantes why the items found on D.A. weren&rsquo;t grounds</p>
<p>for an arrest or even a search warrant to go through any of his belongings, she said</p>
<p>that the evidence was purely circumstantial and that a warrant was never even considered</p>
<p>since the items found on D.A. were the only items he had on him.</p>
<p>There were no personal belongings or backpack or really anything else that they even could</p>
<p>search.</p>
<p>She also said, to her knowledge, none of the items underwent any kind of DNA testing, so</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t be, like, definitively linked back to Irving.</p>
<p>After that, the case went completely cold.</p>
<p>Detectives never found any threats or indications that Irving was targeted because of his religion.</p>
<p>And after finding that stuff on D.A., they pretty much decided that it had been a robbery</p>
<p>and that D.A. was responsible.</p>
<p>But there was still not enough for an arrest.</p>
<p>In 2009, a year after Irving&rsquo;s murder, Silent Witness, which is a nonprofit public information</p>
<p>arm of the Phoenix Police Department, tried to drum up interest for the case by upping</p>
<p>the reward offered for information.</p>
<p>Investigators say that on Tuesday, September 2nd of 2008, sometime between 2 and 5 p.m.,</p>
<p>84-year-old Irving Schumann was murdered inside his business off of Camelback Road</p>
<p>in North 7th Avenue.</p>
<p>They believe that the suspect may have stolen his car, which was later recovered in San</p>
<p>Bernardino, California, but they&rsquo;ve not yet identified a suspect in this case.</p>
<p>If you have any information that would lead to the arrest or indictment of the suspect</p>
<p>in this case, the reward has been increased to up to $11,000.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, nothing came from the announcement.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2012, Irving&rsquo;s family announced that, for a limited time, they would increase</p>
<p>the reward money to $30,000 for information that led police to their dad&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Amy and Rick Schumann in an October 2012 interview with Phoenix&rsquo;s ABC affiliate.</p>
<p>I want justice for my dad and nothing is going to bring him back, but I, for me, I really</p>
<p>think I would feel better.</p>
<p>It is our deepest prayer that someone will come forward and do the right thing.</p>
<p>Around the time of the five-year mark in 2013, the Phoenix PD&rsquo;s Cold Case Unit performed</p>
<p>an audit of all the work done in this investigation to date, poking holes in their own work to</p>
<p>determine what, if any, fresh steps could be taken.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t yield us any probative results.</p>
<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ve done all of the DNA that we could and also all the latent print</p>
<p>analysis that we could.</p>
<p>So right now we&rsquo;re heavily relying on the public to come and hopefully give us some</p>
<p>new information.</p>
<p>After that case review in March of 2014, police got what some might consider to be a huge</p>
<p>break in the case.</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s handgun was recovered at an undisclosed location in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Detective Cervantes said that police were led to the stolen gun when they were investigating</p>
<p>an unrelated home invasion case.</p>
<p>The person who had Irving&rsquo;s gun on him told police that he had obtained the gun from a</p>
<p>third party who law enforcement never identified and therefore couldn&rsquo;t track down.</p>
<p>And I know this sounds out of the blue and totally random, and unfortunately, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all Detective Cervantes said that she knew about the recovery of the gun.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have any other information that would shed light on why or how authorities</p>
<p>were able to locate the gun 300 miles northwest of Phoenix and six years after it was believed</p>
<p>to have been stolen.</p>
<p>You know, questions we have were like, how were Phoenix police even informed that it</p>
<p>was found?</p>
<p>Who made the connection that it belonged to Irving?</p>
<p>Was there any kind of DNA testing performed that could maybe lead to any insight?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a little frustrating because Detective Cervantes couldn&rsquo;t tell us if any</p>
<p>real investigative work was done after that or if they were continuing to try and build</p>
<p>a case just against DA.</p>
<p>The most she could account for in the next stretch of time that was from 2014 to 2019</p>
<p>was pointing to some unfounded tips that would come in here and there.</p>
<p>For example, police fielded theories and speculation about the possibility some disgruntled tenant</p>
<p>Irving leased property to had it out for him, but that never checked out.</p>
<p>Beyond that, even if they were getting closer to charging DA with Irving&rsquo;s murder or looking</p>
<p>for a chance to interview him again, they lost their chance in 2019 because he died.</p>
<p>Now Irving&rsquo;s family and friends are left hoping that the truth about his murder didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>die with DA.</p>
<p>Maybe Phoenix police know more than they&rsquo;re telling us, but it seems like they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>missing a piece of the puzzle that could actually close Irving&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>I believe every cold case is solvable.</p>
<p>In this case, unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have any witnesses or any witnesses that have come</p>
<p>forward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there are witnesses because he was alone in this business.</p>
<p>So I would hope that there&rsquo;s people out there that have more information because whoever</p>
<p>did this most likely spoke about it and talked about it.</p>
<p>But those people aren&rsquo;t coming forward to let us know for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple reasons why people don&rsquo;t want to come forward.</p>
<p>That would be big if they could.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfortunate that if it does end up being this person of interest, he&rsquo;s already deceased.</p>
<p>Just because the primary suspect is dead doesn&rsquo;t mean that Irving and his loved ones</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t deserve to close this horrific chapter of their lives.</p>
<p>If DA did do it, police believe that he would have told someone.</p>
<p>Maybe it was when he allegedly drove Irving&rsquo;s car to California or when he got back to Phoenix.</p>
<p>If you knew DA, a transient man who was known to hang out near the bus stop and business</p>
<p>complex off Camelback Road and North 7th Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona, and you think that</p>
<p>you may have information about the September 2nd, 2008 murder of Irving Schuman,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to speak up.</p>
<p>Or if you interacted with him in San Bernardino in early September 2008 at the Economy Inn</p>
<p>where Irving&rsquo;s stolen car was ditched.</p>
<p>Or maybe you know something related to a different suspect that police should consider.</p>
<p>If you do, please call Silent Witness.</p>
<p>You can remain anonymous and earn a reward up to $2,000.</p>
<p>Their number is 480-948-6377.</p>
<p>Irving&rsquo;s children and grandchildren deserve answers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s help them find some.</p>
