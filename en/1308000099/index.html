    <p>Let&rsquo;s go Jason start. Let&rsquo;s go. Do you have any intros? Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. All right, if you want intros</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not willing to pay for him. So don&rsquo;t even go there</p>
<p>Saks is awake. All right. Well, then we&rsquo;ll start with you Saks if you want to do your job</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do the intros and if you wanna</p>
<p>You want to slow roll your effort because you think you&rsquo;re negotiating with us</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t give a shit. Listen, I&rsquo;m doing all the projects. I think we care about your intros do a bad job. We don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>Waiting in the wings all we do it. Well, then I&rsquo;ll just do three sacks intros in a row. Oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true. Do do a couple of bad jobs so that we can boot you off the show. Oh, that&rsquo;ll be so quick</p>
<p>All right. Here we go</p>
<p>Rain man David</p>
<p>All in summit I packed the joint but Saks won&rsquo;t give me an extra point his crypto holdings</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find a floor gonna have him flying commercial for the first time since 2004</p>
<p>Welcome David Saks back to the program the rain man. Good to be here. Ah now Freeberg</p>
<p>I never wanted to see him go, but you got to show up for work. You can&rsquo;t do every other show the Sultan of science</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly not a fad. Then again, did you see those ratings with Brad? Welcome back the Sultan of science?</p>
<p>By the way, our show beat Brad&rsquo;s rating. So thank you very much Jake out. Okay. Well a little drama always builds a little audience</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. Chama healthy competition. Well Chamath ease in Italy living a life</p>
<p>So grand his next back a luxury wine and sweater brand this market is leaving him in a daze</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s been tipsy in the Mediterranean for the past 10 days. Welcome back the dictator. Thank you</p>
<p>Thank you. I just I put them on stun. I didn&rsquo;t want to do any kill shots there</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>On edge including the audience the audience had a lot to say about whether we cover a lot of the controversial topics</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade January 6th and</p>
<p>Ukraine all I did a bunch of surveys 50% of people want us to talk about a 50% don&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see which one&rsquo;s we get to say</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Do you think we should be?</p>
<p>Surveying the audience to ask him what they want us to talk about because when we started the show we just talked about stuff that</p>
<p>We thought was interesting sure and people happen to look like it and listen and tune in for it</p>
<p>If you end up asking the audience what they want</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you end up becoming like a Fox News or like any other media company where you just ultimately use the feedback loop to drive?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I wouldn&rsquo;t every week of the show. I will tweet like hey anything you want on the docket because sometimes people have good</p>
<p>ideas</p>
<p>But yeah, certainly you shouldn&rsquo;t base it on like a survey. No, I think it was just like a way to get some feedback</p>
<p>Yeah, we were just yeah, that&rsquo;s how we started was we were just kind of being intellectually honest with each other and curious</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we were interested in and it worked and if people don&rsquo;t like it, they don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think we should the big controversial thing like a like a vote for your topics</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we follow definitely not we shouldn&rsquo;t I think we&rsquo;ll agree on that</p>
<p>I think just there is an ongoing debate amongst the audience of what percentage of this show should be</p>
<p>Politics and when should we talk about politics and are we doing too much politics?</p>
<p>And so I think let&rsquo;s start with markets. Let me ask you one more question</p>
<p>Do you think our objective should be to grow the audience or should our objective to be talking about the things we want to talk</p>
<p>About yeah, what do you think? I mean, what do you think sex?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to pull the audience about what you want to talk about. I mean</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think it&rsquo;s good to have an audience otherwise, what are we doing but yeah, um</p>
<p>but look what the audience showed is that half and wanted to talk about those topics roughly and half didn&rsquo;t I suspect that</p>
<p>Most topics are going to be like that, you know</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s just not markets and people like I think 80 90 percent of people want to hear us talk about markets and startups</p>
<p>Yes, like our core stuff, right david</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just saying if your objective function is to maximize your audience</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna end up making a tiktok video of people twerking or something, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the show. Did you just volunteer to twerk on the show? I&rsquo;m not gonna do that now</p>
<p>I think i&rsquo;m pretty sure chamath will I have the video of free bird twerking at uh all in summit anyway</p>
<p>Hey who all right, let&rsquo;s get started with um</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on in crypto because</p>
<p>People do want to hear about that and it&rsquo;s been quite stunning a british virgin island court ordered the liquidation of three arrows capital</p>
<p>Three ac after creditors sued the crypto hedge fund for failing to repay its debt. They had three billion in assets under management</p>
<p>They had a huge position in the now defunct, uh stablecoin terra and its token luna</p>
<p>And they were trading on some massive amount of margin, uh, how much and</p>
<p>What deposits they were using to do this?</p>
<p>Uh, we will find out</p>
<p>Um now they&rsquo;re being forced to liquidated to be liquidated three ac owed voyager digital 650 million</p>
<p>Could not pay it which sent voyager stock down 60 and caused them to need a bailout from sam bankman freed</p>
<p>which has led to</p>
<p>Sbf as he&rsquo;s known in the industry bailing out a couple of other major folks in crypto</p>
<p>He provided a 200 million dollar credit line to voyager</p>
<p>Digital, this is a canadian crypto lender. They&rsquo;ll lend you money against your crypto</p>
<p>uh, and</p>
<p>Ftx provided a 250 million dollar credit line to blockfi</p>
<p>Ftx is obviously spf&rsquo;s company</p>
<p>And according to early blockfi investors, the ftx credit line would wipe out all existing shareholders</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re starting to see the really uh onerous term sheets to keep these things alive</p>
<p>This is of course in the face of an entire crypto collapse</p>
<p>With many crypto coins seeing what we saw in growth socks</p>
<p>Is this the end of crypto, uh, is it going to rebound again? What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Chamath sacks friedberg who wants to start on crypto?</p>
<p>Did you guys see the chart that I posted into the group chat that showed bitcoin?</p>
<p>Activity as a function of year and value. Can you just put that up just so that we can look at that together?</p>
<p>the crazy thing about this chart when you look at it is and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious is that we</p>
<p>Are collectively in one way shape or form basically trading up</p>
<p>Uh ever since 2018 really with all the stimulus because if you look at you know, the mean price of bitcoin</p>
<p>About 2018. It was a nothing burger</p>
<p>You know what we were talking about was, you know a price that was sort of between a few thousand dollars two three thousand</p>
<p>Ten thousand three thousand, you know, and then all of a sudden when all of the stimulus money hit the market</p>
<p>Look what happened to it?</p>
<p>But I think something unique also happened which is that people really understood how to run these very complicated</p>
<p>off-chain bitcoin arms</p>
<p>And I think we should explain what those are because those are what&rsquo;s behind the three arrows capital. It&rsquo;s behind</p>
<p>You know, I think sam had this kind of</p>
<p>Oblique tweet that said, you know, some of these exchanges are actually already in solvent</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already the walking dead</p>
<p>So the first thing to keep in mind is that you know, this is a completely unregulated market, right?</p>
<p>There are no middle maker market makers per se that actually have reporting requirements to any regulatory authority</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any clearinghouses</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a way for us to understand systemic risk as it builds in the crypto market</p>
<p>So what happened starting in 2018 and 19 is people realized the following things were true</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of what we talked about last week</p>
<p>You go and do some crazy round</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>You know mark up some phantom equity in a company</p>
<p>That company then issues tokens</p>
<p>You then list the tokens not on, you know a blockchain per se</p>
<p>obviously but</p>
<p>Uh in a place where trades can happen off-chain</p>
<p>Right, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of exchanges where these things happen off-chain because it&rsquo;s one, you know</p>
<p>Company and then they have a bunch of segregated sub accounts</p>
<p>And what happens is when these things initially get listed retail goes crazy. The price goes up folks basically dump on retail</p>
<p>And you know you spin that loop as fast as you can and you can extract an enormous amount of money</p>
<p>Along the way all these things like defy all of a sudden popped out of nowhere and it&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>You can earn 15, 16, 17, 18 percent just deposit the bitcoin and so folks would deposit bitcoin</p>
<p>But then what would happen is like the places where those deposits were held would then need to obviously</p>
<p>find places to make that</p>
<p>11, 12 or 13 percent</p>
<p>And so then they would go off-chain</p>
<p>To some other random person who was offering to pay them even more than that and they would try to arb the difference</p>
<p>But it all catches up with you</p>
<p>Because when something like a terra goes to zero all the bitcoin that was used to basically, you know</p>
<p>Run that defy process around terra vanishes</p>
<p>You know, and then all of a sudden you the lender are like, hey, can I have my bitcoin back?</p>
<p>And the broker&rsquo;s like well, actually I don&rsquo;t have it. I lent it to somebody else</p>
<p>Let me ask that someone else and they&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t have it, but I have these terra coins</p>
<p>You know because I was running some arb and now it went to zero and that&rsquo;s essentially</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing right now, so we have two big problems</p>
<p>And then I think we have a third that&rsquo;s kind of funny</p>
<p>The first big problem is like obviously in the absence of any regulatory oversight. This stuff is going to happen</p>
<p>Systemic risks are going to build up. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re facing right now</p>
<p>Is an enormous amount of systemic risk largely around bitcoin a bunch of this money. I think has been essentially just</p>
<p>vaporized</p>
<p>And so all these people that try to find</p>
<p>Their deposits especially in custodial accounts in off-chain brokers</p>
<p>Maybe sol at some point</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just going to be a huge shit show if that actually happens and to be clear</p>
<p>Chamath they don&rsquo;t have the keys to their own bitcoin. They gave money to a custodial account</p>
<p>They then did this lending went out to get them to 15</p>
<p>And they</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have any recourse here. They can&rsquo;t get there. Well, look at this</p>
<p>Bitcoin owners put them in a wallet and own the keys</p>
<p>Does anybody have recourse to this three arrows capital and all of this other interrelated parties that are now, you know</p>
<p>Gone completely bankrupt because of this scam. The answer is absolutely not</p>
<p>Um, so that that&rsquo;s the first problem you have absolutely zero oversight, which means systemic risk has been built up in the system</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>The second thing is that exactly what you just said jason is that people don&rsquo;t even understand chain of custody here</p>
<p>Which is that you thought that you owned this bitcoin?</p>
<p>It turns out you actually may not actually own them at all. You thought that you were properly lending them out</p>
<p>You actually don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>There is no enforceable contract it turns out and so I think that&rsquo;s going to be an entire</p>
<p>Set of different legal issues</p>
<p>That are now going to come to the service because people who actually legitimately lent this stuff out</p>
<p>For example, like if you short a stock and you go and borrow stock from any one of us</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really tight guardrails, you know, if you wanted to go and put a credit derivative swap on against that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a central clearinghouse that makes sure you&rsquo;re not over levered</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>You have to go and get audited by a bank to even get in a the kind of account that allows you to put these</p>
<p>derivatives on</p>
<p>None of that was possible in crypto and then the last thing</p>
<p>Which I think is kind of funny is that we&rsquo;ve had to listen to every millennial and gen z market observer in crypto</p>
<p>Tout how this is not like boomers and they turned out to be the same same same</p>
<p>I mean, this is the funnest thing of all it&rsquo;s like of all of the times</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had to hear how it&rsquo;s so different. It turns out it is entirely the same</p>
<p>Entirely entirely in fact worse the custodian issue is definitely a major one sax</p>
<p>What do you think is happening in crypto right now? The price is obviously going down a lot</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have a</p>
<p>New point of view on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly pissed off that sbf is trying to raise my taxes in california</p>
<p>Explain that sam bankman freed. He runs ftx and his company he lives in the bahamas</p>
<p>Okay, and there are probably reasons for that related to liability or taxes or something like that</p>
<p>Can you tell us what what ftx does they&rsquo;re like a coinbase competitor?</p>
<p>But they obviously think it&rsquo;s beneficial to be offshore and not under us jurisdiction and they&rsquo;re very profitable, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, supposedly they&rsquo;re super profitable</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s worth like 10 or 15 billion dollars</p>
<p>This is my understanding</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s been very successful at this. I don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re in the bahamas. I think either they&rsquo;re in there for</p>
<p>Securities regulation reasons or for tax reasons, but it&rsquo;s one of those two in any event</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t live in california and yet</p>
<p>He is sponsoring a ballot initiative here</p>
<p>that would add a</p>
<p>0.75 tax on incomes over 5 million to finance a</p>
<p>Pandemic prevention institute of his design</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing this with dustin moskovitz another billionaire doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with his money</p>
<p>He was may remember that dustin was the guy funding chase aboudine</p>
<p>In any event, this would be this pandemic preventions to be governed by an unaccountable board</p>
<p>As opposed to something like the university of california</p>
<p>This is like them using the ballot initiative system to fund their pet philanthropic projects. I mean, there&rsquo;s really no need for this</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, this is sounds like something that should be done federally. Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well, first of all, it&rsquo;s looking in the rearview mirror in terms of like a budgetary priority</p>
<p>But even if you believe this was a priority, I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;d be the responsibility of california</p>
<p>taxpayers exclusively</p>
<p>And even if it was you&rsquo;d want to do it under say the uc system</p>
<p>some sort of accountable board as opposed to having a report to</p>
<p>You know sam and dustin</p>
<p>so it makes no sense and this is really going to hurt the california tax base because</p>
<p>If you start raising</p>
<p>taxes on</p>
<p>You know california millionaires more of them are going to leave the state and then that tax revenue leaves the state</p>
<p>And so it actually hurts the general budget</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you know california teachers association for example opposes this</p>
<p>Is because they know that this is going to have a negative impact on core services</p>
<p>What is but what&rsquo;s offensive to me is I mean, so first of all, this is just a stupid idea in like every possible way</p>
<p>But what is a guy who lives in the bahamas doing funding ballot initiatives in california to raise our taxes</p>
<p>thereby worsening the california fiscal situation</p>
<p>To fund his pet philanthropic projects if you&rsquo;re worth 10 billion just fund it on your own, you know</p>
<p>Do it through your family foundation. I don&rsquo;t know why you need to raise the taxes on all of us</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very bizarre</p>
<p>Why is he giving well the simple answer is because I think it helps curry favor with politicians that he needs for other things</p>
<p>But this is that&rsquo;s why you would do it that&rsquo;s why I would do it</p>
<p>This is currying negative favor because first of all</p>
<p>Every millionaire in california should be up in arms over this but even i&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think we know his game plan?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but I&rsquo;d say even liberal politicians and interest groups in california</p>
<p>like the like the teachers association don&rsquo;t want this because</p>
<p>The money&rsquo;s not going to a cause they support</p>
<p>And it will probably it will almost certainly</p>
<p>drive down the state&rsquo;s tax base, right because</p>
<p>People on the margins are going to leave we already have the highest taxes in the nation. We&rsquo;re at what like 13.3</p>
<p>For the top end we have a hundred billion dollar surplus for a reason all these ipos all of these</p>
<p>Venture capitalists ceos and rank and file tech workers are just paying massive amounts of tax here and they&rsquo;re leaving right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s highly levered to capital gains, right and so last year we had a boom market</p>
<p>We now know in hindsight that it was inflated</p>
<p>That was all driven by this liquidity bubble</p>
<p>So do you think that&rsquo;s going to be the case this year?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re due for a huge budget shortfall next year because there&rsquo;s going to be no capital gains</p>
<p>They better hold on to that hundred billion for sure. The california tax base is highly leveraged to this boom bust cycle</p>
<p>And driving the top earners out of the state is only going to worsen that impact. So</p>
<p>You know, but again, I question why is a guy in the behind it&rsquo;d be one thing if it was just</p>
<p>Dustin doing it, I guess but I don&rsquo;t understand why sam&rsquo;s taking the lead when he&rsquo;s not even a california taxpayer because I think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very sophisticated</p>
<p>Player in not just crypto, but frankly, uh</p>
<p>Regulated and unregulated finance and look he I think he spends a lot of money</p>
<p>in dc as well, and I think that he has a very</p>
<p>Thoughtful game plan and then you know when you look at who his parents are his parents are</p>
<p>Really really smart thoughtful people as well to law professors at stanford. And so I suspect not</p>
<p>Knowing and having spoken to him</p>
<p>um that I think that there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>Specific strategy that these guys have around who they need</p>
<p>to influence</p>
<p>and what they care about and then willing to</p>
<p>As a pass-through fund those things in order to create</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>you know influence that he needs for the things that he cares about and I suspect that it&rsquo;s that kind of horse trading which</p>
<p>Is I think it&rsquo;s pretty typical in u.s. Politics. Um</p>
<p>The question though is what will happen</p>
<p>if ftx</p>
<p>um has to really talk about</p>
<p>You know everything that&rsquo;s actually happening in crypto crypto, you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that ftx could do a lot to help understand a lot of this off-chain</p>
<p>Activity some of the you know, especially the stuff that&rsquo;s really in the gray</p>
<p>especially the stuff that&rsquo;s going to come to light over the next few years is</p>
<p>I mean you have to understand guys like, you know, we&rsquo;ve torched two trillion dollars and it&rsquo;s not of institutional capital</p>
<p>You know, this is overwhelmingly retail capital</p>
<p>all of this is going to inspire a lot of</p>
<p>District attorneys and doj activity the discovery is going to be bonkers and it&rsquo;s all going to be regulated</p>
<p>to the point of in which it kills a lot of</p>
<p>The opportunity I think this is going to become the most regulated space. Well, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I mean I I if the goal here was to carry favor</p>
<p>Then I think sam must think there&rsquo;s not going to be a red wave in november because I don&rsquo;t think republican</p>
<p>Politicians are going to look very favorably on a guy who&rsquo;s using his money</p>
<p>To raise taxes in a state. He doesn&rsquo;t even live. All right. Well, let&rsquo;s move back to the crypto piece</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s move back to the crypto piece here. That&rsquo;s the bigger. That&rsquo;s the bigger thing not a few million dollars of lobbying</p>
<p>At this point with this many retail investors, well, actually let me let me start with this freeberg</p>
<p>Is there a real technology here and how much of what we&rsquo;ve just witnessed with this crypto collapse and the crypto boom bust cycle?</p>
<p>How much is this based on what you would perceive as real technology?</p>
<p>That is going to advance the human species forward and how much of this was hype if you were to put a percentage on it</p>
<p>You know trillions of dollars in assets, you know</p>
<p>Created and then wiped out</p>
<p>How much of this was actually real technology?</p>
<p>How much of it was complete utter waste of fucking time?</p>
<p>And a grift i&rsquo;m no crypto expert and i&rsquo;ve not been an investor in cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>I read the original bitcoin white paper</p>
<p>Makes sense bitcoin itself to me makes sense as a potential</p>
<p>Initially was kind of interesting as a potential alternative currency, but the transaction fees were very high</p>
<p>And so it never really seemed to make sense as a replacement for traditional financial networks</p>
<p>Until those transaction fees dropped below those of the traditional financial networks</p>
<p>And the biggest concern i&rsquo;ve always had which i&rsquo;ve mentioned multiple times on the show</p>
<p>Is that whenever anyone?</p>
<p>Talks about a quote cryptocurrency</p>
<p>They talk about the price of it in dollars</p>
<p>And if it really is meant to be an alternative</p>
<p>to the u.s dollar</p>
<p>Why are you talking about it in the price of u.s dollars and it&rsquo;s up and it&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>Relative to dollars and that implies ultimately that the intention would be to transact back to u.s dollars</p>
<p>Which implies that the intent is not to be a replacement for the u.s dollar</p>
<p>Which was a lot of the early prognostication of bitcoin?</p>
<p>Was it was going to be a replacement for the u.s dollar? It&rsquo;s going to be an alternative to traditional monetary systems</p>
<p>But ultimately if you&rsquo;re just measuring this in dollars and it&rsquo;s up and it&rsquo;s down everyone&rsquo;s freaking out every day about cryptos up cryptos down</p>
<p>That means it really is more like a security</p>
<p>Except securities definitionally are supposed to have a secured interest in some underlying set of assets and there&rsquo;s no underlying asset</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually a security because it doesn&rsquo;t provide you a secured interest in anything</p>
<p>So it is effectively a bet on some systems of computers that are meant to facilitate some set of activities</p>
<p>That you know, ultimately people really only seem to value in u.s dollars. So, um</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know I mean like where does it all go it seems like I mentioned at our predictions episode last year</p>
<p>That all of these smaller things are going to get blown out</p>
<p>These quote unquote cryptocurrencies, even though many of them don&rsquo;t really act like a currency</p>
<p>And you know, maybe bitcoin itself persists and it seems to me like that&rsquo;s always going to have good staying power</p>
<p>As an observer. I&rsquo;m not a participant</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You know anytime someone telling you something&rsquo;s in dollars and it&rsquo;s going up and it&rsquo;s going down and you&rsquo;re betting on whether it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>To go up or go down and your intention is to transact back to dollars</p>
<p>You know and and there&rsquo;s no one these have been securities the whole time</p>
<p>This is the problem I have with it this has been</p>
<p>You know a shadow securities stack that was created in parallel to the existing one with a lot of</p>
<p>You know oversight and what did we think would happen if you created a global casino with no rules</p>
<p>Other securities have an underlying interest in something. This has an underlying sure interest</p>
<p>In some line on the blockchain of that particular network. That&rsquo;s exactly that&rsquo;s exactly what it has</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a secured interest in a line of code in on a distributed. No, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it has a secure</p>
<p>a bitcoin has</p>
<p>a legitimate</p>
<p>uh, non-fungible entry in a blockchain that says it and only it represents that thing and I think that that</p>
<p>you know is is I guess that the</p>
<p>The link some may call it tenuous, but I I mean I tend to think at this point bitcoin</p>
<p>Probably has to be regulated like a security even</p>
<p>even if it is not and it&rsquo;s more of a commodity only because of the</p>
<p>the volume and the sheer size of both the market and the</p>
<p>The potential fallout is the way you&rsquo;re saying it, right?</p>
<p>The potential fallout when things go off the rails is so great. You kind of need to have some rails</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I mean like like again as I&rsquo;ve said like look if you&rsquo;re a market participant trying to trade</p>
<p>You know, very sophisticated, you know derivatives of any kind for example in the credit markets</p>
<p>We have to go and we create these things called isdas. They&rsquo;re called isdas, you know</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically a kind of an account that allows us to go and</p>
<p>You know take risk in some of these very esoteric markets, but the the underlying principle around that</p>
<p>Is a common set of parameters a clearinghouse the ability to monitor risk</p>
<p>None of those things exist here. And I think that&rsquo;s really what folks have to solve for now</p>
<p>secondarily is</p>
<p>What were all these kind of like shadow activities, you know?</p>
<p>It just it turned, you know, it seemed too good to be true when you would hear</p>
<p>Wow, this d5 protocol will yield you 24 and you&rsquo;re just like who was paying the 24</p>
<p>It never made sense really but then none of us really questioned it</p>
<p>You know, I you know</p>
<p>I had people on this week in startups</p>
<p>I questioned it all the time and they could never explain it to me and then</p>
<p>Now the explanation was well, we were giving you we were giving short-term loans to other people who basically wanted a margin loan</p>
<p>You know, they want to they don&rsquo;t want they want to hold all their bitcoin</p>
<p>But that was only four or five percent what they were also doing was giving you tokens in some other cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>That they were basically originating. So they basically were like we&rsquo;ll give you four percent on your bitcoin loan</p>
<p>Somebody else will pay that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll pay that but then the other 11 is coming from some tokens. We&rsquo;re giving you that actually</p>
<p>You know, you have airline miles. We have to answer you airline miles. We have to answer a really important question if you</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve we you know, look the the markets have incinerated</p>
<p>Many trillions of dollars I just saw like for example, there was 1.7 trillion</p>
<p>you know that was just</p>
<p>Torched in etfs alone just in the since the beginning of this year, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that or more</p>
<p>in the crypto side</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that or more on public equities, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably going to do that or more in other markets, but every other market is regulated and there&rsquo;s a full accounting</p>
<p>Of the pnls on the dollars that are won and the dollars that are lost</p>
<p>and here</p>
<p>Some folks have just you know, basically escaped with billions and billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>And the bag holder is just you know</p>
<p>A regional investor. So the real question is</p>
<p>Our regulator is going to actually care to try to do something because oh, yeah</p>
<p>The level of grift that&rsquo;s happened in this market is extreme</p>
<p>And especially when especially when everybody was telling you no this time is different. This market is completely different</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s transparent. It&rsquo;s on chain. You can see everything and it turns out actually most of it was not on chain. It was off chain</p>
<p>And they were using they were using this</p>
<p>Hey have fun being poor this like psyops to get you to participate. Okay boomer. You don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>Gensler I was talking to kramer on cnbc. Here&rsquo;s the quote some like bitcoin and that&rsquo;s the only one jim</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say because i&rsquo;m not going to talk about any of those</p>
<p>These tokens that my predecessors and others have said are a commodity</p>
<p>Um, and then he said</p>
<p>Many of these crypto financial assets have the key attributes of a security aside from bitcoin. He believes</p>
<p>You know, like these things are securities and that makes sense because 99 of people buying them sacks were buying them</p>
<p>Because they wanted to see them appreciate they were never using these as utility tokens</p>
<p>They were buying them to you know, see them appreciate and to flip them</p>
<p>So what do you think sacks is there is there when we look back on this whole mess in 10 years?</p>
<p>Is it going to be like the dot-com era where we&rsquo;re like, yeah, I got overheated but amazon and google came out of it</p>
<p>Or are we going to look at it and go? Well, that was tulip season</p>
<p>Well, I I think there is um a future technology platform here with crypto</p>
<p>But I mean i&rsquo;ve been saying this</p>
<p>For the last year that just because there&rsquo;s a future technology platform doesn&rsquo;t tell you what the pricing should be and the price action got decoupled</p>
<p>from the level of progress in the space</p>
<p>You know, you should always be looking at what is the real</p>
<p>usage</p>
<p>use cases</p>
<p>customers revenue things like that and</p>
<p>People stop doing that and I think part of the reason why the narrative was so powerful</p>
<p>If you go back to last year</p>
<p>then the chart that shamas showed about the the increase in the price of bitcoin, which is really the the root of everything right because</p>
<p>you know first bitcoin appreciates and then if you think about it like ethereum is</p>
<p>Ethereum&rsquo;s market cap is like a derivative of the bitcoin market cap</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been roughly 40 percent</p>
<p>And then the all coins sort of get the market cap of the all coins is sort of derivative off ethereum&rsquo;s market cap</p>
<p>So the whole thing kind of moved up in in sync and the reason why bitcoin moved up so much is that as the fed</p>
<p>Kept printing more and more money. You had fans of bitcoin saying look the fed is debasing the u.s</p>
<p>Dollar we&rsquo;re going to need an alternative</p>
<p>Currency that was a powerful narrative that the fed seemed to be vindicating</p>
<p>And there was a positive feedback loop, which is the more the fed debased the currency</p>
<p>the more that the price of bitcoin went up now the reason the price went up was not because</p>
<p>They were debasing the currency. It was because they were creating so much liquidity</p>
<p>That that it created a liquidity effect that then drove up the price</p>
<p>And so so consumers had money that they could buy bitcoin because they were there was more money in the system</p>
<p>Yeah, you created more buyers of bitcoin. That&rsquo;s exactly what happened. They</p>
<p>I mean all of this idiotic you sort of sorry go inside</p>
<p>Yeah, you saw an increase in speculative investments across the board including but not limited to crypto</p>
<p>So again, you know when the fed prints too much money, it creates asset bubbles, but there&rsquo;s a powerful</p>
<p>Reinforcement because as the fed was printing bitcoin and supporters of bitcoin had a really great explanation</p>
<p>For why bitcoin was going up, which is they&rsquo;re destroying the u.s dollar. We&rsquo;re going to need an alternative soon</p>
<p>Now I think in the very very long term could bitcoin be a non-fiat currency</p>
<p>yes, I mean, I actually think the technology works you could create a</p>
<p>a new kind of currency that&rsquo;s backed by math and by</p>
<p>Cryptography as opposed to fiat government, but that could take a really long time</p>
<p>I mean that could be decades in the future and but what happened is the market started thinking well that&rsquo;s going to happen soon</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it just got ahead of itself. That was the tulip part of it</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that I think that</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>Found all of these words, you know written in these economic textbooks</p>
<p>That allowed them frankly to justify what a lot of people were doing in a lot of other markets, which is just straight-up speculation</p>
<p>Because the money printer was going burn</p>
<p>And you know if the if you look at this 92 correlation to the equity markets</p>
<p>I suspect in bitcoin and crypto is probably closer to the even a hundred percent</p>
<p>um because it really was the furthest out on the risk curve and it just made the most sense when you thought money was</p>
<p>You know effectively infinitely going to be available to just buy the riskiest risk assets</p>
<p>Think about the friction taken out of this chamath. You could buy these, you know, uh cryptocurrencies so easily</p>
<p>You could trade them so easily you could create one so easily people were popping up forks of these things</p>
<p>So in a way what technology has done over the last 30 or 40 years from cloud computing to software to open source</p>
<p>Has made it very easy to pop up a startup</p>
<p>Well, you could pop up a currency and then you could get an incredible reward</p>
<p>and you get this incredible reward before you actually make a product for consumers and</p>
<p>And absolutely zero rules and oversight. No oversight. Yeah</p>
<p>The feature that was touted</p>
<p>Was actually the first one to get thrown away which was transparency</p>
<p>Yeah, when all of this activity was actually happening off-chain</p>
<p>This is why you have this systemic risk issue now when sam is saying some of these exchanges are actually in solvement</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s saying is well that exchange has one master</p>
<p>wallet address</p>
<p>Every time you open an account and transact on such exchange</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually just transferring between a database entry inside of that company</p>
<p>And so it may look like it is fine, but it is actually not fine. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s claiming</p>
<p>This is the problem with all of this. So all of this activity, you know built on these principles of openness and</p>
<p>You know defensibility and you know, you you can&rsquo;t inflate it and you know, devalue it and debase it</p>
<p>Turned out to not even matter because the fundamental principle that would allow us to verify all of that was violated right from the get-go</p>
<p>Which was transparency all of it is happening in the dark</p>
<p>Most of this stuff is happening off-chain</p>
<p>And if you think that you know, it&rsquo;s okay to torch a trillion dollars of equities</p>
<p>Well, at least there&rsquo;s rules on the equity side</p>
<p>But to torch two and a half trillion dollars in crypto where there are no rules</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be really, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a very telling sign to see if these folks get their act together and but meaning regulators and politicians and do something</p>
<p>Well, then we made this crazy hybrid where we had the venture community and i&rsquo;m not going to talk about any specific firm here</p>
<p>And to be clear, you know, nobody knows exactly what&rsquo;s happening, but you had coins</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t know by the way, you can&rsquo;t know because it was happening off chain</p>
<p>Exactly</p>
<p>So somebody would originate a coin and I was you know</p>
<p>Offer these deals and you would as a venture capitalist be buying some equity in a company</p>
<p>And then some amount of tokens would be created</p>
<p>Before the token was released to the public or before anybody had insights into this these tokens were swapping around</p>
<p>Everybody had different rights. Some people could sell early. Some people could never sell and it was as if</p>
<p>you know you took the</p>
<p>Process of going public and you gave that to a seed stage or a series a company before they launched their product</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking a company public</p>
<p>Essentially before they go if you if you subpoena, they launch their product</p>
<p>If you subpoena the exchanges</p>
<p>All of this gets turned over. Yeah, because the exchanges are</p>
<p>The honeypot of off chain activity. Yeah, so and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>I think in all of this and it&rsquo;s going to be really funky</p>
<p>This is and what&rsquo;s terrible about this is this is why the accreditation laws</p>
<p>Exist is like only sophisticated people top six percent of americans are allowed to participate in private companies</p>
<p>And what did we do?</p>
<p>We allowed a hundred percent of people on the globe to participate</p>
<p>Backed by pure math back that less than a thousand people in the world actually understand</p>
<p>That could go wrong. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>You cannot buy a stock</p>
<p>But you can buy this cryptographically secure</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to buy a share of linkedin or uber or airbnb, even though you stayed in an airbnb</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an airbnb host. You&rsquo;re too stupid to buy airbnb shares when it&rsquo;s private</p>
<p>But you can buy this cryptocurrency that doesn&rsquo;t even have a product in market and and here&rsquo;s this white paper</p>
<p>That has you know university level pure math as the explanation of why it nothing can go wrong</p>
<p>And you turn it turns out again because nobody actually understood in the first place</p>
<p>This is going to be a decade of discovery</p>
<p>If you look at that price chart what it really means is like again, you know, we talked about this</p>
<p>If the equity markets have to rebase and get all this qt or qe out of it</p>
<p>Yeah, right and then you have to rebase for earnings if you believe you&rsquo;re in a recession and then you have to rebase</p>
<p>For margins if you believe that there&rsquo;s rampant inflation those three things have to happen in the equity markets. We&rsquo;re in the midst of that</p>
<p>Yeah, but that also has to happen on the crypto markets in the crypto markets and if you look at that chart</p>
<p>What it really tells you is that the baseline price of bitcoin where things seemed, you know</p>
<p>Where rational supply and demand were meeting each other before all these, you know, five ten thousand</p>
<p>3,500 to 5,000. Yeah, I was saying about 5,000 still 75 percent for me</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s 20,000 now. So yeah, we got we got we could we have ways to go one thing that I thought was an interesting</p>
<p>sign of potentially bouncing along the bottom</p>
<p>Um zendesk has agreed to be acquired by an investor group in an all cash transaction. They&rsquo;re basically going private here</p>
<p>Uh for around 10.2 billion, uh, if you don&rsquo;t know zendesk</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a help desk software company. It&rsquo;s a sas software company</p>
<p>They turned out a similar acquisition of 17 billion earlier this year their market cap is 9.1 billion in the public markets</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gone up obviously since this announced this was announced but um, they have</p>
<p>Uh a billion three in revenue. They&rsquo;re up 30 percent year over year. So this is a strong company</p>
<p>But the acquisition price is 7.7 times their 2021</p>
<p>Multiple sorry. Did you say they&rsquo;re up 30 percent of the revenue? The revenue is up 30 revenue is up 30 year over year</p>
<p>They have 1.5 billion dollars in cash and securities, uh that are you know marketable security so they&rsquo;re cash rich</p>
<p>Small loss 223 million for the year in 2021. So they have six years of runway if nothing were to change</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you make of this sax is why would they do this?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to so and is this to you like the sign of a bottom if we start seeing</p>
<p>A bunch of these companies that went public that are seemingly strong start to go private</p>
<p>And to go maybe clean up their balance sheet and go public again in three years what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>Well, I mean this isn&rsquo;t a horrible outcome. And by the way, I mean I remember we shared uh</p>
<p>When I was doing yammer a decade ago, we shared a floor in uh, our an office building at 410 townsend with um with zendesk</p>
<p>And they launched a tech crunch 50. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>So we had I think 5 000 square feet and they had the other 5 000 square feet and we were in a standoff both</p>
<p>Of us were expanding and we needed the other half of the floor and it was like who had moved first basically</p>
<p>And anyway, they ended up moving and we took over their space</p>
<p>But so I mean look this is a company that you know was worth 100 million bucks 10 years ago</p>
<p>So whatever it was, I mean they were still, you know, they were very early stage. So</p>
<p>This is still a great outcome. So they&rsquo;ve taken the 17 billion sure with 2020 hindsight. That would have been better</p>
<p>But look you&rsquo;re seeing the valuations here being roughly reflected</p>
<p>The sas index is now down to about five and a half times</p>
<p>Revenue, I think next 12 months revenue for them for the median sas company and the median sas company is growing about 20</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a high growth company, which starts at 40</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trading at about eight times next 12 months revenue. So then zendesk is sort of in there</p>
<p>I mean that is what they&rsquo;re trading for</p>
<p>And sas founders why go why would the founders the board</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you want to go private is the question on people&rsquo;s minds. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not that they wanted to go private</p>
<p>I think that they wanted to stay public and they wanted to build a large business</p>
<p>But this is where the law of large numbers catches up with every company</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so rare to have an apple or a google or a microsoft or a facebook or netflix</p>
<p>Where you can grow for 20 years at 25 plus percent because at some point</p>
<p>25 percent growth over last year just becomes too hard of a mountain. It&rsquo;s a big nine</p>
<p>And so what zendesk suffered from is what most of these sas companies?</p>
<p>Not and i&rsquo;m not trying to disparage them just calling it out. We&rsquo;ll have to go through which is the following</p>
<p>The easiest kind of sas company to start and the one that folks, you know</p>
<p>Really talented investors like sax will fund overwhelmingly over others are what&rsquo;s called bottoms up sas</p>
<p>Right things that sell to the low end of the market things that sell into</p>
<p>You know individuals can buy them in a corporation as opposed to the cio</p>
<p>Yeah, the the unfortunate part of that growth curve</p>
<p>Is that it&rsquo;s pretty terminal within seven to ten years and after that you&rsquo;re forced to go</p>
<p>To the mid market and that eventually you&rsquo;re forced to go enterprise</p>
<p>But when you go to the mid market and you&rsquo;re selling to 500, you know, 1000 2000 person companies and then eventually even enterprise</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about massive investments of opex people</p>
<p>engineers product managers sales people</p>
<p>And all of that stuff costs money and it&rsquo;s not clear that your product is any good</p>
<p>So in the zendesk&rsquo;s example, it&rsquo;s not to say their products were bad</p>
<p>But all of a sudden they were going up and selling a crm tool a salesforce automation tool</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re going head to head against companies like salesforce who are going down market</p>
<p>And all of a sudden salesforce and microsoft and all these companies can play very aggressive pricing games with their products</p>
<p>They can bundle all kinds of other things in for free. They can give you discounts</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to compete as a single individual company. So your growth starts to stall</p>
<p>So I suspect what happened at zendesk</p>
<p>Is they said we can make it</p>
<p>And we believe in ourselves</p>
<p>And they found that it was hard then instead of organically growing. That&rsquo;s when they turned down the 17 billion dollar offer</p>
<p>They tried to grow inorganically. They looked at survey monkey, right?</p>
<p>Which our friend xander runs and said we&rsquo;re going to try to buy that for 4.1 billion dollars and the market said</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>And then the market basically contracts and now they&rsquo;re like well if we go and now torch</p>
<p>Our epita goals and tell the market we&rsquo;re going to go and spend all that billion dollars</p>
<p>We have to try to go up against salesforce and microsoft with a product that we don&rsquo;t know is going to work</p>
<p>Our stock&rsquo;s going to be at a dollar</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s sort of the the parade of terribles that happened for them, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a</p>
<p>warning sign for how difficult it is to get big like what salesforce pulled off right and what</p>
<p>Workday is starting to pull off what service now has pulled off</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t underestimate the quality of I mean google apple facebook. No, i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying specifically enterprise. Yes. Yes those companies</p>
<p>Service now probably being the last one that&rsquo;s really did it</p>
<p>Incredible</p>
<p>So difficult palo alto networks is probably the next closest one now salesforce</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear right salesforce doesn&rsquo;t matter how you get there organically and organically doesn&rsquo;t matter. The point is it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>Most ceos fail nobody. So is this going but okay</p>
<p>So my original question is is this the bouncing along the bottom moment because we have peloton buzzfeed</p>
<p>We have so many of these companies. This is a warning sign</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not yet the bottom</p>
<p>Well, this is a warning sign that says you cannot go into a massive investment cycle</p>
<p>for all companies</p>
<p>Unless you can prove that you can sustain margins</p>
<p>Sustain growth and minimize opex, but isn&rsquo;t this a very sophisticated buyer?</p>
<p>Taking it private. They must have a thesis of how they&rsquo;re going to get their money back</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s my point is sax. Do you think that this is like</p>
<p>If if the company&rsquo;s already public and somebody thinks hey, you know</p>
<p>If I take this private I can do better than if it&rsquo;s public and i&rsquo;ll reintroduce it to the public markets to get liquidity</p>
<p>Later, isn&rsquo;t that what&rsquo;s going to happen here in all likelihood?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making that statement in the absence of understanding how these things are financed</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s got a billion five and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s breakeven almost. So</p>
<p>What about the what about the the billions of dollars of debt?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to take out and slab off this company, right?</p>
<p>What about the number of people they may be talking about post going private at the end of the day?</p>
<p>The private equity firms are not trying to make you know, this 10 billion dollars go to</p>
<p>25 they&rsquo;re trying to make the 2 billion of equity they put in go to three</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of ways that two can go to three before 10 goes to 25</p>
<p>So they want a modest return</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s 50 return. It&rsquo;s a lot. It&rsquo;s making a billion dollars. It&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>Yeah, but but compared to the management team and the board&rsquo;s view of being a public company and growing 20 a year</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s actually in their case 30. Would that be a better opportunity for those shareholders?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what doesn&rsquo;t add up here sacks. What do you think if I had to guess?</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t talked to michael about why they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re operating at a new stage of the business</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as fun to be</p>
<p>Growing a company at call it 20 to 30 a year and now all of a sudden you have to generate</p>
<p>Cash flow and you&rsquo;re being valued on that. I mean they&rsquo;re past</p>
<p>Your thesis. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean it&rsquo;s it seems a potential thesis</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s basically why people sell good businesses. Like I actually don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a problem in their business. I think that</p>
<p>Growing 30 a year with 1.3 billion in revenue plenty of cash in the bank. I think they have a good product</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with the business</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that that I do think founders get burned out and this is an exit</p>
<p>And I do think that the phase of their business they&rsquo;re in right now is not going to be as fun</p>
<p>As the high growth phase look when you&rsquo;re growing 100 200 a year</p>
<p>And investors are willing to fund that growth and they don&rsquo;t really care if you&rsquo;re profitable that is just more fun</p>
<p>than growing a business 20 to 30 a year and</p>
<p>Investors are breathing down your neck saying when are you going to deliver cash flow?</p>
<p>And what the private equity guys do is they&rsquo;re going to go in there and they&rsquo;re going to restructure the business to deliver cash flow</p>
<p>Now I think ultimately these types of businesses</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great these software businesses. They&rsquo;re great business to own because they&rsquo;re high gross margin</p>
<p>And you know, they&rsquo;ve got a subscription base that just keeps growing organically if they&rsquo;ve got positive net dollar retention</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a let&rsquo;s call it a 1.3 billion dollar subscription base that will grow</p>
<p>To 2 billion over the next whatever half dozen years</p>
<p>And quite frankly, I bet you the private equity guys are going to take out half the cost structure</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason this thing could be generating 500 million a year in free cash flow</p>
<p>But the management team would be unwilling to do that because it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>It kind of sucks to do that every day to come in and fire half the team that you hired</p>
<p>And take that hard medicine it just as a bummer for that</p>
<p>Personality type. I think it is a different kind of management challenge. And yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that fun</p>
<p>And but look the thesis behind software companies the justification for them burning money</p>
<p>The justification for them burning money was look we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna spend</p>
<p>Every dollar in revenue that we make and then some because we&rsquo;re building a subscription revenue base</p>
<p>That again has positive net dollar retention. So one day</p>
<p>Okay, one day we won&rsquo;t have to keep investing so much in sales and marketing</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t have to keep investing so much in r&amp;d. We&rsquo;ll still keep investing to some degree</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make the product better, but it&rsquo;s going to be a little bit more maintenance mode. We will get to</p>
<p>Maturity and then you can lay off a third of the staff and all of a sudden and then and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>The company is going to be super profitable</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is is that day never came because the markets never demanded it</p>
<p>Now that day is here. No, no, no</p>
<p>Hold on it never came because the markets kept demanding more growth</p>
<p>If you look at their long-term operating margins, you know when they first when they first came out public</p>
<p>It like had like a negative 30 percent margin</p>
<p>Two years later they had a negative 50 percent margin and over the last seven years</p>
<p>So that was 2015</p>
<p>Up to now they&rsquo;ve crawled their way back to negative 13</p>
<p>So at some point I think investors said oh my gosh, this company has never made money</p>
<p>It needs to keep investing more in order to grow</p>
<p>And I think david to your point, maybe the decision that he didn&rsquo;t want to make was to flip it to a cash cow</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. I looked at</p>
<p>These guys have been generating cash</p>
<p>Their reported gap earnings are negative because of the stock-based comp expense meaning that they&rsquo;re issuing</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big topic to discuss here</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s actually worth highlighting because this is an important one because people have been talking about this considerably lately</p>
<p>So this company&rsquo;s been making money every quarter they generate cash</p>
<p>But in the last quarter</p>
<p>They issued 60 million dollars in stock to employees to compensate them for the work that they do. So that&rsquo;s 250 million roughly</p>
<p>Dollars per year of stock-based comp which is two and a half percent</p>
<p>Of the total shares outstanding in the company are issued as employee comp every year</p>
<p>That number results in a dilutive effect to shareholders over time</p>
<p>Even though the business is generating cash your relative ownership as a shareholder in a business that&rsquo;s generating cash</p>
<p>Is going down by two and a half percent every year because of all the new shares that are being issued</p>
<p>To compensate employees for the work that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s part of the issue that a lot of folks kind of have taken for granted</p>
<p>This was well rooted</p>
<p>In I would say probably google who became very generous very early on with issuing rsus</p>
<p>And stock in their publicly traded securities to employees as part of their compensation package</p>
<p>But google has a 30 40 percent EBITDA margin in terms of incremental contribution of new new revenue</p>
<p>And they can afford to take a point or two of dilution</p>
<p>Google, by the way, it&rsquo;s actually not dilutive. They they buy back shares with their extra cash</p>
<p>So as a shareholder, you actually benefit from this considerable cash generation</p>
<p>But a lot of software businesses and tech companies in general</p>
<p>Have had to rely on issuing shares to compensate employees for the work that they do</p>
<p>So even though the core fundamental of the business is generating cash and cash is going up every year</p>
<p>The business doesn&rsquo;t know how to get out of this cycle of how do you pay these engineers?</p>
<p>$400,000 a year</p>
<p>Without diluting shareholders by issuing all these new shares every year</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have to do that more likely as a private company to figure out how to consolidate earnings how to trim headcount</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that get the thing to generate the cash it needs to generate but freeberg?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a real like you&rsquo;re pretending like it&rsquo;s some fake cost</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a real cost. It&rsquo;s a cost of shareholders for sure. But why but why why the asterisk?</p>
<p>Well, no, there&rsquo;s a specific reason because the business itself</p>
<p>Running out of cash. It&rsquo;s not burning cash. The business is growing its cash balance</p>
<p>But in order to compensate employees for that cash balance, they&rsquo;re diluting you the shareholder, right?</p>
<p>Look</p>
<p>When you own a share of a company, okay</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say by the way is another way of saying that the company is effectively issuing two and a half percent new stock</p>
<p>Every year to fund its operations. I mean, that&rsquo;s another way to think about it</p>
<p>Look, i&rsquo;ll give you the Warren Buffett school</p>
<p>You can tell me that it&rsquo;s stupid but it kind of makes sense which is you take the number of shares you own</p>
<p>You divide it by the total the number of shares outstanding</p>
<p>You look at the total profits</p>
<p>And you say my look through earnings equals that percentage times the total profits. Yeah, your percentage is going down every year with stock based comp</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem. And so the question is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also going down because you&rsquo;re buying real estate</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hiring people you&rsquo;re paying them more like it&rsquo;s going down for a whole host of reasons that asterisk is an irrelevant asterisk in my</p>
<p>Like the end of the day you spend money to grow how you spend the money is not that important to me</p>
<p>Let me say two quick things on the topic. One is um, yeah, I totally agree. It&rsquo;s an expense</p>
<p>on enterprise software and sax you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re the the the master of the art, but</p>
<p>You know as an observer, it seems to me that many of these companies once you have an enterprise account</p>
<p>You benefit from being able to cross sell new products into that account and you can grow this net revenue retention</p>
<p>Number over time and ultimately generate cash</p>
<p>Many of the big enterprise software companies that we&rsquo;ve talked about from salesforce to workday and others have succeeded in doing that</p>
<p>Autodesk is another good example and carl bass. I think it&rsquo;s on the board of zendesk</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done um, they&rsquo;ve done this successfully by bulking up their product categories</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve done acquisitions or they&rsquo;ve done buildouts. And so over time your incremental cost to uh,</p>
<p>to sell a new product and generate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Incremental gross profit goes down and the business performs better with scale</p>
<p>This seems to be one of those businesses where ultimately they couldn&rsquo;t bulk up through acquisition</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t organically try products and they tried and so the challenge is they&rsquo;re kind of a I don&rsquo;t want to say a one-trick</p>
<p>pony</p>
<p>But the portfolio of things that a business like this can sell into and ultimately increment gross profit is very limited</p>
<p>And that business becomes challenging to operate as a public company</p>
<p>Because you really do have to show that momentum as a scaled enterprise software business</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re actually generating real cash over time</p>
<p>The other thing I just want to say on stock based comp and sorry sacks</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come back to one sec, but chamath and you guys I don&rsquo;t know if you realize this but the standard in silicon valley today</p>
<p>Um when a company goes public in an ipo</p>
<p>Is to have what&rsquo;s called an evergreen stock grant proposal</p>
<p>And evergreen basically means that every year the company is authorized the board</p>
<p>automatically</p>
<p>Authorizes the issuance of some percentage of new shares per year. This is typically in the range of four percent</p>
<p>And iss and other you know kind of institutional shareholder advisory services actually vote against</p>
<p>These shareholder proposals and push back against them. But most of the companies in silicon valley that go public</p>
<p>Automatically include evergreens as part of their you know, kind of ipo prospectus. I mean, can we agree?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out of control like it&rsquo;s yeah, which means every year they can they can dilute shareholders by four percent</p>
<p>And independent of how the business operated that year which is effectively the same as doing a four percent</p>
<p>Secondary cash offering every year because it&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;re issuing those shares into the public market</p>
<p>And instead of getting cash you&rsquo;re paying your employees with them</p>
<p>And so it avoids you having to use your own cash balance to pay your employees</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re effectively raising money every year and you&rsquo;re allowed to raise</p>
<p>Up to four percent dilutive effect to shareholders to do that every year</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become a real topic and it seems to me that a lot of the big portfolio managers</p>
<p>Of big institutional funds are starting to pay really close attention to this quote-unquote standard in silicon valley</p>
<p>That stock-based comp expense has become so high and evergreens have become kind of a standard</p>
<p>as almost like an ordinary course of business and it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>Um, you know a really contentious topic and I don&rsquo;t think it would be too surprising</p>
<p>Number one to see cash salaries go up and number two as a result of that to see salaries become rationalized in silicon valley</p>
<p>Where engineers may start to get challenged on the standard 400k per year</p>
<p>That everyone&rsquo;s become used to um, you know in terms of you know, high tier</p>
<p>uh, you know</p>
<p>Promote work. Maybe there is a a compromise that could be had but this compensation you have to remember has been outrageous in some cases</p>
<p>Especially for senior management, and so it makes the core business look broken</p>
<p>But what we actually have is maybe people who are on these boards</p>
<p>Are also in on this compensation</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just bad hygiene and it&rsquo;s not related to the performance of the company, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think the board people are quote in on it</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s you have to pay an engineer 400k a year to compete effectively in silicon valley today</p>
<p>I was talking more about the management&rsquo;s the management stock comp the management stock comp is different than the engineers</p>
<p>You would agree free very like there have been some enormous stock grants board. Yeah. Yeah, certainly if you want to run the company</p>
<p>As a high growth startup with employing these high paid engineers and executives including stock compensation</p>
<p>That is a certain kind of way of running the business</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re trying to run the business for profitability, that&rsquo;s a different way of running the business</p>
<p>And just to add a layer to what happened here that zendesk was under intense pressure</p>
<p>From an activist investor called janna who was basically trying to replace the board of directors. They&rsquo;re running a proxy battle against them. So</p>
<p>Jana has been pressuring them to replace the board to make all these changes</p>
<p>That to take the 17 billion dollar offer, I guess back in march. They didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>Now they did a lower offer at 10 billion. Why I think because the market has clarified we now it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s clearer that we&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>Regime change what the market is valuing is free cash flow as opposed to profitless growth</p>
<p>And my guess is again without having talked to michael</p>
<p>My guess is they probably just threw up their arm and said listen, you know</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not going to be fun to run the company this way, but you also have to</p>
<p>You have to ask the question. Why are these highly sophisticated private equity firms buying it for 10 billion?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to make a lot of money and the way they&rsquo;re going to make a lot of money more than a billion</p>
<p>Yeah, they are going to slash the hell out of the cost structure</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to run it to be highly profitable</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably bring the growth down from 30 percent a year to 20 percent or 15</p>
<p>But the benefit the offsetting benefit to reducing the growth a little bit will be they could probably generate</p>
<p>Three four five hundred million of free cash flow on that business if it&rsquo;s doing 1.3 billion</p>
<p>And they stop investing in r&amp;d and they stop and they bring down the sales and marketing</p>
<p>That could be a that could be a cash cow like you said</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>Um is the I just want you guys to know not to burst this bubble, but when people talk about free cash flow</p>
<p>they touted a lot tech companies touted a lot because</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to add back in stock-based comp as if it didn&rsquo;t exist. The problem is that stock-based comp is non-cash</p>
<p>So when when you&rsquo;re only sourced, so if you see a company that has negative EBITDA negative everything</p>
<p>All of a sudden are like quote unquote free cash flow positive</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they were able to add back in stock-based comp, but that money is not real</p>
<p>So when the only source of free cash is stock-based comp that free cash flow doesn&rsquo;t reflect the company&rsquo;s true profitability</p>
<p>This is what I mean by people play these shell games with these numbers to allow, you know</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s you know value something based on EBITDA actually</p>
<p>No, because you know our stock-based comp is off the charts. Let&rsquo;s actually go to something else</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ll do a non-gap EBITDA measure, you know</p>
<p>You know adjusted EBITDA and then oh actually wait</p>
<p>Sorry, look at free cash flow because you can add back in this gargantuan amount of stock-based comp</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy. I&rsquo;ll just the quote from community EBITDA. We work</p>
<p>The quote from Warren Buffett summarizes the best if compensation isn&rsquo;t an expense. What is it?</p>
<p>And if real and recurring expenses don&rsquo;t belong in the calculation of earnings where in the world do they belong?</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re seeing right?</p>
<p>My point is is not that comp isn&rsquo;t an expense</p>
<p>It is but rather that it&rsquo;s an expense that you can control by reducing the amount of staff</p>
<p>I think these private equity guys are gonna basically whack the cost structure of this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just saying you can distort free cash flow as well because you can head back in stock-based comp. It&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a shell game going on. It&rsquo;s like the dirty secret. Let me ask you a like</p>
<p>an important investing accounting question</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that a business like</p>
<p>Zendesk is generating 100 million dollars of free cash a year</p>
<p>No, no, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, hold on. So every year their cash balance goes up by 100 million dollars</p>
<p>They have a business it generates 100 million dollars of incremental cash every year the cash balance goes up</p>
<p>So you as a shareholder own shares in a company that is creating 100 million dollars of cap of incremental capital per year</p>
<p>However your shares that you own are going down because they&rsquo;re getting diluted every year</p>
<p>By roughly two and a half three percent and that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s two and a half percent is Zendesk&rsquo;s actual number</p>
<p>So every year you&rsquo;re getting diluted by two and a half percent</p>
<p>Would you rather have a business that you are getting diluted by two and a half percent?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s incrementing its overall balance by 100 million dollars</p>
<p>Or would you rather own shares in a company that&rsquo;s burning cash each year?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where this ended up from a market perspective getting rationalized</p>
<p>Is shareholders said I want to have the safety and security of cash generation and i&rsquo;m willing to take on the dilution for it</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how this became, you know as standard as it is when I think about funding a new startup</p>
<p>And I look at the competitive landscape when I see that the competitors have all been acquired by private equity companies</p>
<p>I generally think okay. There&rsquo;s room for innovation here because I know that the first thing the PE</p>
<p>Firms are going to do when they acquire a company</p>
<p>Is like a zero out r&amp;d or just put the product on maintenance mode. There&rsquo;s no innovation that happens</p>
<p>Yep with the product once the PE firms buy the buy it, right?</p>
<p>So the reality is I think those are good targets for startups to do acquisitions, right sax. I mean they&rsquo;ll find yeah</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do roll-ups right because it&rsquo;s they will do financial innovation. They will innovate the the structure</p>
<p>Although the wasteful spending and all the nonsense and lunches. Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>Once like cut out all the kind bars</p>
<p>Yeah, the kind bars are exposed brick walls like all this nonsense. Yeah</p>
<p>So who do you think it&rsquo;s a vegas trip?</p>
<p>Yeah, this stock based compensation is going to go away because they&rsquo;re going to get rid of all the high price engineers</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get rid of the a lot of the high price executives</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to probably they&rsquo;re going to have to keep customer support. They&rsquo;re going to increase cash salaries probably</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll bonus people they&rsquo;ll just do bonuses for hitting targets instead of giving people as much equity in the business</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll run it like a you know, private equity type type play. Why don&rsquo;t you do this sax?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun. It&rsquo;s not interesting to me, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean we&rsquo;re going to see it&rsquo;s not a new product</p>
<p>I think david the other reason why it wouldn&rsquo;t be fun is like it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a level of financial engineering</p>
<p>Which is highly sophisticated. I think for some people it is fun. I think for us it&rsquo;s less fun because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Necessarily creating a company per se not innovative. You&rsquo;re not being a product person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re yeah, but I would say that it is highly sophisticated and the folks that do it at these places that these private equity firms</p>
<p>Are incredibly they&rsquo;re very good at it savvy at how they do it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all the twists and turns of how you you know lever this up and use debt and blah and use a margin loan</p>
<p>and pre-fund the I mean</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the stuff that necessarily we want to be thinking about</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d have to do as well. I totally agree with that. Look i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m happy they exist in the ecosystem because we need firms we need more exits, right and</p>
<p>we know that right now in washington the</p>
<p>The regulatory regime is very difficult. It&rsquo;s very hard to get deals through</p>
<p>So at least you have private equity firms that are providing some exits and we need the ecosystem needs and those exits</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying sacks don&rsquo;t trigger</p>
<p>Like comp competitive concerns with lena khan and her group, right? Like yeah</p>
<p>Some private equity firm took this private. Okay salesforce didn&rsquo;t buy it</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t need to get through regulators. You&rsquo;re going to see a lot</p>
<p>We need exits in order to justify the risk capital that goes in</p>
<p>At the earliest stages which in most cases is going to be a zero</p>
<p>And just to give you some other numbers out there manscaped, uh, which is a company that sells razors for guys</p>
<p>Uh, they had 315 million in net loss in 2021</p>
<p>With 310 million in stock based comp by the way</p>
<p>That number can also be distorted just to be clear if you give a one-time big grant to an executive like a ceo</p>
<p>Yeah, the way that the accounting works on stock based comp. It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing</p>
<p>You can have a very simple</p>
<p>Kind of descriptor on but you can have these very significant short-term costs associated with a big grant</p>
<p>That could vest over a long period of time sure with that has very high strike prices</p>
<p>I mean when elon got that massive grant at tesla, the stock based comp expense was significant</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know what the interesting way into it</p>
<p>It was that was there were 20 targets or something crazy like that and all of them were based or a lot of them were based</p>
<p>On the stock price and the delivery of cars. So that&rsquo;s one of the things that I think is broken. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is one of the things that&rsquo;s broken in silicon valley is that</p>
<p>The the comp in the stock based comp is not tied to performance. It&rsquo;s like just giving people guaranteed salaries</p>
<p>In fact, I was gonna say jason for junior people like there is more sophistication to be clear</p>
<p>In executive comp and public technology companies, I think that should trickle down to the junior people, too</p>
<p>I think everybody should rise and fall with the company&rsquo;s performance. That&rsquo;s my personal feeling</p>
<p>I mean, this is the problem with entitlements, you know, and people being entitled</p>
<p>I started to be like a red pelt here</p>
<p>But we should have like performance should be lauded and compensated for not just showing up and hanging out</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of companies in this position. So look for this as a trend peloton</p>
<p>964 million last quarter in revenue lost 757 million in the quarter</p>
<p>They have a 3.1 billion dollar market cap. They&rsquo;ve only got 879 million dollars worth of cash</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking at these numbers. Hopefully they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re tight. Um</p>
<p>And they have a billion for an inventory that company&rsquo;s going to get taken out</p>
<p>Uh buzzfeed. I don&rsquo;t know why that even went public. They&rsquo;re down 84 percent</p>
<p>They had 91 million media company 91 million dollars in q1 revenue. They lost 45 million</p>
<p>Their market cap is down to 210</p>
<p>Million and they&rsquo;ve only got 74 million in cash or so with some, you know, maybe 100 millions in accounts receivable</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of companies right now that are public</p>
<p>that are</p>
<p>About to hit in a couple of quarters running out of cash going into a recession. Are we going to see?</p>
<p>Some big flame outs. Do you think and are you watching specific companies because the private equity folks must be salivating watching this</p>
<p>Well, I mean look</p>
<p>You asked what the takeaway was around this and I think the takeaway is there&rsquo;s been a regime change in the public markets</p>
<p>The way that investors look at these companies is changing. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>About growth at all costs anymore. They&rsquo;re not just looking at revenues. It&rsquo;s also about margins and cash flow</p>
<p>and you know, we talked about in the last pod how</p>
<p>I think a lot of founders understand intellectually that we&rsquo;re headed for a downturn</p>
<p>If not a recession, but they weren&rsquo;t taking the medicine of basically reducing their burn. Well</p>
<p>This is an indication of what investors are valuing if the only way for zendesk to create value as a public company</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sell to a private equity firm</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to cut half the staff is going to cut off or some huge number of staff to run it for free cash flow</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just an indication of the regime change. So</p>
<p>You know, we need founders to start</p>
<p>Internalizing this information so they can run their businesses more efficiently, you know what investors want right now</p>
<p>They still want growth, but they want it with low burn high burn operations are going to get punished. I&rsquo;ve transitioned most of my</p>
<p>public markets time to focus</p>
<p>on debt</p>
<p>um, and i&rsquo;ve been looking at these companies because yeah, because there&rsquo;s a lot of these really interesting tech companies with a lot of</p>
<p>Because what david said I think is a hundred thousand percent right what sax just said</p>
<p>There is a massive massive regime change here</p>
<p>And yeah, and when shocking you if you don&rsquo;t take the medicine, you know</p>
<p>And and what what&rsquo;s funny is like so many of these companies have been left for dead</p>
<p>But what is really juicy?</p>
<p>Is the few companies that you think will survive?</p>
<p>And specifically making sure you&rsquo;re protected in the capital structure</p>
<p>Which means to own the debt because the debt is always senior to the equity and there&rsquo;s some really really interesting companies out there</p>
<p>That are in that situation and it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s a much better risk reward</p>
<p>In a moment where again, you know, we talked about this, but why would you give up your liquidity today?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer</p>
<p>Why why let&rsquo;s go around before you use this term jason before like skipping along the bottom</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s like psychological wishful thinking as opposed to sort of like a rational summation of the actual jerome</p>
<p>Powell just said I will tank the economy in order to beat inflation. He just said it in the wall street journal</p>
<p>But people believe inflation might be turning over. Do you buy that or not?</p>
<p>No, as i&rsquo;ve said, I think you&rsquo;re going to see eight and nine percent inflation prints for at least the next three or four months</p>
<p>minimum</p>
<p>I think that things could get</p>
<p>Marginally better after that</p>
<p>But I think the thing we don&rsquo;t know and again it just touches and I don&rsquo;t care what the fucking audience thinks touches</p>
<p>Russia and ukraine</p>
<p>So sorry to bring up politics, but no these things are inexorably</p>
<p>intertwined</p>
<p>and if people want to go and venture and gamble in the stock market, you might as well understand this because I think</p>
<p>You know many of the scenarios will trade</p>
<p>Because of what&rsquo;s going to happen with putin</p>
<p>Let me let me ask the question here</p>
<p>How many quarters will this recession be if we had to pick a range pick a two quarter range?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking three to five. What do you think? I have no idea. Okay</p>
<p>Freeberg you got a</p>
<p>This is the second how many quarters?</p>
<p>plus or minus two, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>Uh, is this recession going to be so five plus or minus two four plus or minus two plus or minus one?</p>
<p>What are you thinking will be the bottom out point? I don&rsquo;t like the term i&rsquo;ve told you guys I don&rsquo;t like the term</p>
<p>Quote recession as if it&rsquo;s some absolute negative thing. I mean</p>
<p>negative gdp growth coming off of inflated gdp doesn&rsquo;t feel to me as</p>
<p>Uh systemically challenging to the economy</p>
<p>As uh, you know some other circumstance where for example, there was a global financial crisis or</p>
<p>9 11 or some other kind of factor that that drove things</p>
<p>Uh that that really affected the core economy</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly we we had we had something that that affected the core economy and covid then we had massive stimulus</p>
<p>So I I don&rsquo;t I think there&rsquo;s this unfortunate general characterization of quote unquote recession</p>
<p>being an absolute negative and I think that there&rsquo;s relative growth and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>If your relative growth is negative off of an inflated number</p>
<p>But over okay, let me give you let me let me just finish but over a historic two or three year period</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still growing the economy considerably because jobs, uh jobs are growing and production is growing</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s not as negative as it&rsquo;s being made out to be so i i&rsquo;m not gonna okay</p>
<p>I get you get into let me let me ask you this way then how many more quarters will we have of</p>
<p>Stocks and real estate and assets declining in value or being flat. That&rsquo;s a financial markets question</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a different one. And one thing i&rsquo;ve realized is that financial markets in the short term</p>
<p>Uh, you know the old warren buffett quote or whomever it is that over the long term equities are a weighing machine in the short</p>
<p>Term they&rsquo;re a voting machine</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen with crypto. It was a voting machine that everyone voted on the the hot thing. That&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>And now everyone&rsquo;s voting against it. So I don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re weighing it now. Yeah</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean at some point</p>
<p>You hold a cryptocurrency long enough. You&rsquo;ll find out how much fundamental productive value it&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>And the same is true for owning businesses or other real assets</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find out over the long run how much productive value they&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>So, so you don&rsquo;t want to answer the question of when we hit a floor, okay sacks</p>
<p>When do you think we hit are we are we hitting a floor now?</p>
<p>We have a lot more to go down. I&rsquo;ll tell you one point of view</p>
<p>I I am looking at buying high quality share businesses buying shares of high quality businesses right now</p>
<p>I think that there are things that are that are cheaply priced that if I own them for a long enough period of time</p>
<p>The underlying productive value of that business will return my capital to me</p>
<p>And so you have one that you might want to mention here that you&rsquo;re looking at. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t want to share stock tips at the summit with our friend sunny</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s his trades are up. But like I told him these are longer-term trades</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what do you think in terms of and then we&rsquo;ll go to some of the political stuff that affects markets after this</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s all related</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three things going on here right now economically or three underlying causes one is rate expectations</p>
<p>Have changed massively interest rates have gone up and rate expectations are going up even more</p>
<p>Fueled by inflation and until we see where we&rsquo;re at on inflation whether that gets controlled that issue is not going away</p>
<p>The second big issue is economic slowdown the recession. So the first one is wall street</p>
<p>This is main street and these two things are related because companies are slamming on the brakes</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re seeing that the capital availability is</p>
<p>Greatly getting reduced by this re-rating this regime change in markets</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing an economic slowdown that threatens to turn into a recession</p>
<p>and consumer confidence is part of that right when your</p>
<p>Wages don&rsquo;t buy you as much because food and gas prices are through the roof</p>
<p>That reduces consumer confidence and that also plays into that. So that&rsquo;s the second big issue and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to know</p>
<p>about recession</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take you know</p>
<p>Potentially through the rest of the year before we figure out what&rsquo;s happening there</p>
<p>And then the third part of this is the overhang of this war in europe the ukraine war</p>
<p>Which is now threatening to become a forever war. There was a pretty stunning article</p>
<p>In the washington post this week</p>
<p>in which the administration</p>
<p>Officials were quoted as saying that they would effectively prefer or countenance was their word a global recession and famine</p>
<p>over letting russia</p>
<p>Keep the donbass region. So they are committed now to basically prying</p>
<p>Russia out of the donbass, even if it means global recession</p>
<p>Not to mention they say specifically the donbass or specifically standing up to putin</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of minimizing what we&rsquo;re talking about is is the donbass region what&rsquo;s happened is look</p>
<p>The russians lost the first few weeks of the war in which they tried</p>
<p>To strike they they basically went for a knockout blow to take over kiev topple zelenskyy</p>
<p>I think we accomplished something in preventing that but since then</p>
<p>They have achieved their objective of taking over this eastern portion of the country this donbass region</p>
<p>In which this is where most of the ethnic russians live and these ukrainian separatists who are</p>
<p>Ethnically russian they&rsquo;ve been fighting alongside the russian troops and the russians have basically won that part of the war</p>
<p>And so the question is what do we do now?</p>
<p>And what you had is you had administration officials saying that they would not accept the status quo that they are willing to fight on</p>
<p>For years</p>
<p>You know the same geniuses who gave us the forever wars of the middle east are now giving us a forever war in eastern europe</p>
<p>And they are saying that they are willing to basically continue this fight even if it means global recession now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the american people</p>
<p>ever voted for this but</p>
<p>This is what the administration is pursuing</p>
<p>And you know, you got to remember that there&rsquo;s always the risk that this war spins out of control that we get a nuclear escalation</p>
<p>So I think that this is a huge overhang on markets. It&rsquo;s the third big problem that we have</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see how we get out of this bear market until you get</p>
<p>Clarity and resolution of inflation and rates number one</p>
<p>slow down to recession number two and basically this war in europe number three and it&rsquo;s reflexive because uh,</p>
<p>these next three months as I as I</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>Indicated last week. I think we&rsquo;re going to see inflation</p>
<p>Uh prints that are really high in part because things like rents which haven&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>Which are on a lag will get folded back in so we&rsquo;re going to be printing eight and nine percent</p>
<p>And then guess what jason? It&rsquo;s the fall</p>
<p>It starts to get colder, you know, uh, russia&rsquo;s depriving europe of nat gas</p>
<p>Um, where&rsquo;s the oil going to come from?</p>
<p>OPEC is basically still stiff arming the united states with respect to expanded production capacity</p>
<p>Why because they didn&rsquo;t like the way that we were strong arming them and a whole bunch of other topics</p>
<p>You know, and so where do we stand you could have 180 a barrel oil</p>
<p>By november december when it&rsquo;s cold not just here but in continental europe</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden inflation gets kicks right back up again, it could be seven eight nine percent again</p>
<p>I so I just think all of these things are now so inexorably intertwined. I think david&rsquo;s right we need to</p>
<p>Put this war to bed</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The unfortunate consequence is that right now if we</p>
<p>Want to fight a proxy war there is no elegant off-ramp</p>
<p>that I see so</p>
<p>The prediction markets just so people know are predicting point eight point nine percent</p>
<p>Uh additional inflation in june over and I think that&rsquo;s over last month and last month was 8.6</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to be at nine and a half jason</p>
<p>Could you imagine what the markets do if we print a double digit inflation print ten and a half percent?</p>
<p>10.1</p>
<p>Just the psychology of that</p>
<p>Uh, well consumer psychology is really low right now. No not consumer psychology. I&rsquo;m thinking market psychology. No market, too</p>
<p>Yeah, so we put those two things together and then if this war is never ending and the famine that um</p>
<p>And the impact on 40 million people or something like that that freeberg predicted is actually going to happen in the next six months</p>
<p>Uh, this is going to feel quite chaotic to people around the world</p>
<p>So we we do need to put this war to bed for sure</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no deal on the table right now, but the deal that we&rsquo;ve talked about on previous shows there was always</p>
<p>The broad construct here even before the war began was there were three pieces to it</p>
<p>number one</p>
<p>was that</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Ukraine had to remain a neutral state as opposed to</p>
<p>Being brought into nato and having american troops weapons and bases on russia&rsquo;s border</p>
<p>That was always a red line to them and in exchange for neutrality ukraine would get security guarantees</p>
<p>piece number two was that in the eastern region where you had these</p>
<p>Russians these russian speakers that their rights would be respected and that they would have some autonomy</p>
<p>And again, that was something that ukraine agreed to under the minsk accords</p>
<p>But it was never properly implemented and the third piece was that russia got to keep</p>
<p>Crimea, which again was a fait accompli that happened in 2014</p>
<p>Smart observers of this conflict have been outlining that three-point plan</p>
<p>for over a year</p>
<p>And that is what we&rsquo;re going to end up with the only difference is that it&rsquo;s going to be implemented by force</p>
<p>And ukraine will be destroying the process</p>
<p>That is basically where we&rsquo;re at right now</p>
<p>russia has</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken over the donbass. They&rsquo;ve taken over this eastern 20 percent of the country. They have crimea</p>
<p>And ukraine basically the the rest of it will not be part of nato</p>
<p>That is basically what the russians have done is implement by force</p>
<p>A plan that frankly we could have agreed to through negotiation a year ago and avoided all this death and destruction</p>
<p>My my calculation is maybe I mean, we don&rsquo;t know putin&rsquo;s intent and that&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s the wild card here</p>
<p>He is a bit of a madman. I mean, he&rsquo;s pretty much of a wild card here. He&rsquo;s a dictator who invaded another country</p>
<p>Yeah, my my calculus is slightly different. I think I see two things in order to get us back to a state of</p>
<p>relatively predictable growth and price stability number one is we need to</p>
<p>Reset supply and demand by taking 30 trillion dollars out of global markets</p>
<p>And then the second is we need an off-ramp to this ukraine-russia war so that</p>
<p>There is predictable energy and food supply</p>
<p>To the world so that folks can just get back to what they do best</p>
<p>And if those two things can happen, then the markets will have found the bottom</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Until those two things happen in my opinion</p>
<p>And by the way, the first thing doesn&rsquo;t actually have to happen entirely</p>
<p>You just need to see a path for it and you know</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only one that&rsquo;s doing quantitative tightening right now. The ecb hasn&rsquo;t even started taking all this crazy money out</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know when the bank of england is going to do it</p>
<p>When is you know, the bank of japan going to do it? So this has to be a global coordinated effort before we find the bottom</p>
<p>And this war has to stop</p>
<p>Well, just kind of go back to this, uh unpredictable madman narrative</p>
<p>jason</p>
<p>Yeah, look if you&rsquo;re the dictator. Yes</p>
<p>If what you&rsquo;re trying to say here is that putin bears moral</p>
<p>Culpability and moral responsibility the blood is on his hands for this war. I agree with you on that</p>
<p>Okay, however, this how could you how could you not? I mean, he&rsquo;s the person who invaded right but but just logic there</p>
<p>Right, but the idea that this war was unpredictable or could not have been predicted is simply false because many</p>
<p>Experts did predict it and they did tell us exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>And the reason they knew was going to happen is because russia has been saying since at least 2008</p>
<p>Uh when there was this bucharest summit and nato declared its intent to bring ukraine into nato</p>
<p>The russians been saying that is a red line and russia experts biden&rsquo;s own cia director a guy named bill burns. He was then</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>Emissary to russia and he wrote a memo to then secretary of state connelly&rsquo;s rice</p>
<p>And what he said is that the idea of bringing expanding nato to ukraine?</p>
<p>Was a red line for the entire russian elite not just putin</p>
<p>So, uh, and if you go back and look about what other russian leaders said about nato expansion</p>
<p>Gorbachev said it was a humiliation to russia yeltsin was against it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been against it. And so bill burns warned in 2008</p>
<p>This was a red line and the russians been saying this since 2008</p>
<p>And they were saying it all of last year if you go look at contemporaneous headlines</p>
<p>Describing the tensions between the us and russia</p>
<p>This is the headlines of articles I can provide to nick we can put on the screen</p>
<p>They were saying this was an absolute red line for them</p>
<p>So the idea that this conflict was unpredictable because putin&rsquo;s a madman listen, you can call him a dictator</p>
<p>We can also predict highly predictable. Yeah. Okay, and you know, it&rsquo;s also highly predictable is that china considers?</p>
<p>You know taiwan a renegade, you know</p>
<p>province like yes dictators</p>
<p>You know will tell us what they&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>The question is does the free world want to stand up to dictators and so</p>
<p>While you know, uh, it&rsquo;s messy to stand up to a dictator</p>
<p>The west, you know kind of doesn&rsquo;t have a choice to stand up to dictators or else</p>
<p>They will roll into other countries history has shown that so as messy as this is and as terrible as it is for the economy</p>
<p>I do think that we have to stand up to dictators. There are plenty of dictators where we work with</p>
<p>Biden, they&rsquo;re not invading other countries</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not invading other countries and that&rsquo;s the difference here sax</p>
<p>You know, we could have avoided including a bit of a pass here. He invaded the country</p>
<p>We must stand up to dictators who invade other countries. Well, look, look what you&rsquo;re saying. I don&rsquo;t mean just america. I mean the free world</p>
<p>Yeah, well look look where you&rsquo;ve got us then with this policy you and the people we could have avoided</p>
<p>Yeah, because you are basically spouting this this nonsense</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Look, the question is stand up to dictators who invade other countries. I think you would agree. That&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>Let him talk</p>
<p>Let us discuss. Okay. Freiberg. Okay. Listen</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that russia has been the aggressor, but the question is why did they do this?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really have a theory on that jason except that you believe that on february 24th putin woke up and went nuts</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically your explanation. No, that&rsquo;s not for what&rsquo;s happening in the world</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s a debated. We know it&rsquo;s a debated region. We know that they&rsquo;ve had this conflict for a long time</p>
<p>Okay, so we could we could have used here on the pod many times every every president from bill</p>
<p>Clinton to obama who has dealt with putin has written largely the same account of him in their memoirs</p>
<p>Which is look they know that he&rsquo;s a thug. They know that he&rsquo;s a dictator</p>
<p>However, they always said they always said he&rsquo;s very businesslike. He&rsquo;s very direct. He told them what their issues were. Okay</p>
<p>Putin was very direct. He and biden had a summit in june of last year</p>
<p>The russian&rsquo;s been very direct your attempt to bring ukraine into nato is a red line for us</p>
<p>Why it&rsquo;s a violation?</p>
<p>Of our security interests the idea of bringing a country into nato</p>
<p>It has huge security externalities for them. By the way, we understand this in other contexts</p>
<p>We understood in the context of cuban missile crisis</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t say that cuba had the right to join any military alliance that it chose to</p>
<p>Because we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep as well as at night if cuba had nukes</p>
<p>Pointed at us with a first strike capability. We&rsquo;ve had this conversation. Do you think?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Sweden and finland be invited into nato</p>
<p>I would table that issue until the war is over</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we need to basically deal with that right now</p>
<p>But listen, we don&rsquo;t even have to go back to the cuban missile crisis right now</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a country called the solomon islands about 3 000 miles off the australian coast</p>
<p>They entered into a deal with china security deal and the u.s has been up in arms about that</p>
<p>So, you know, and the reason is we don&rsquo;t want china extending its footprint</p>
<p>In asia, okay</p>
<p>So we treat that deal as having a security externality for us</p>
<p>And yet we refused last year to recognize that there&rsquo;d be any security externality for russia if we brought ukraine into nato</p>
<p>The russians were abundantly clear about what they needed. So my point is this conversation on the pod</p>
<p>Yes, my point is this that this war was easily avoidable through the use of diplomacy</p>
<p>The administration chose you believe that you don&rsquo;t know that you believe that you don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even try it. We never even tried</p>
<p>You actually don&rsquo;t know that you actually listen to that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that jason because here&rsquo;s what happened after the june 16th summit in geneva between putin and biden last year, okay</p>
<p>Putin tells biden to his face. This is a red line as they&rsquo;ve always said. So what does the administration do?</p>
<p>Not only do they not negotiate with the russians. They invite zalinsky to the white house on september 1st of last year</p>
<p>We talked and then on november 10th, they published a massive 10-year charter agreement</p>
<p>This was a huge finger in the eye to the russians</p>
<p>And on the heels of that november 10th charter agreement</p>
<p>The russians basically delivered an ultimatum to the us demanding a written guarantee that ukraine not join nato and then in january</p>
<p>Blinken was tasked with negotiating with lavrov and blinken said there has been no change</p>
<p>There will be no change nato&rsquo;s door is open and will remain open. This administration was incredibly stubborn</p>
<p>They were absolutely refused to use diplomacy to defuse the crisis now you say well, we can&rsquo;t know what it would have done</p>
<p>Well, but the point is they never tried</p>
<p>Is ukraine a sovereign country?</p>
<p>Yeah, they are but do they get to pick what they do in their fate?</p>
<p>Look this idea that they get to pick their fate</p>
<p>As a sovereign country, I think you would agree. Yes</p>
<p>Okay. Well, here&rsquo;s the question is you&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;re trying to do and is is create a doctrine</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re trying to create a new doctrine</p>
<p>That a country gets to join whatever security alliance</p>
<p>They want whatever military alliance they want that is not a doctrine we believe in when it comes to the solomon islands</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a doctrine</p>
<p>We believe in with respect to cuba and the cuban missile crisis</p>
<p>and the fact the matter is is that the nations of the world are engaged in security competition and the and if</p>
<p>If a country like ukraine joins a new military alliance that has huge externalities</p>
<p>And so we do not believe in that doctrine. Jason. This is a doctrine that did not exist</p>
<p>until february</p>
<p>Wait, we don&rsquo;t believe more people should be able to join nato</p>
<p>While sweden clearly believe that but this this doctrine that the countries of the world should be able to join</p>
<p>Whatever military alliance they want that is not a that is not we do not practice that doctrine</p>
<p>That is not an example. It&rsquo;s cuba</p>
<p>Cuba and then more recently the solomon islands. Okay. Yeah, I mean listen, I I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying this war is not a mess all wars tend to be a mess</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying we shouldn&rsquo;t try to resolve it with everything we have</p>
<p>I do think the people of the ukraine and you know get to pick their fate and and I am in support</p>
<p>And I am in support of the of nato being stronger and stronger and i&rsquo;m in favor of isolating putin</p>
<p>Uh, you know and using diplomacy as the primary tactic</p>
<p>To do that and making sure he doesn&rsquo;t run over countries because he won&rsquo;t stop at one</p>
<p>I I think that&rsquo;s the the big question. I think is will he stop at one? Do you think he&rsquo;ll stop at one country?</p>
<p>History has proven he won&rsquo;t you just said are you okay with stopping him?</p>
<p>Listen you you just said that you want to use diplomacy as the primary tactic</p>
<p>Okay, so we agree on that</p>
<p>The question is what you&rsquo;re willing to give up because the administration was not willing to engage on the key russian concern</p>
<p>Which is the admission? Let me ask you of ukraine. It&rsquo;s a native. Do you think russia will stop?</p>
<p>With ukraine or donbass? Do you think that&rsquo;s actually the stopping point for putin?</p>
<p>Listen, I think there&rsquo;s a few ways to come at that question</p>
<p>One is to ask what is the motivation which is very hard to know because it&rsquo;s inside putin&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>Okay, so the second is one of their interests and the third is what are their capabilities?</p>
<p>The capabilities question is pretty easy to answer. I mean they have had a very hard time winning this war</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve won this eastern region of the donbass because I think why is that? Why did they have a hard time?</p>
<p>Well because their military capabilities are obviously not as great as people thought and the native ukraine got a lot of weapons</p>
<p>From the west from from nato exactly. So this idea listen i&rsquo;ve said it before</p>
<p>The eu&rsquo;s gdp is 10 times greater</p>
<p>than russia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>And you know economic strength is the foundation for military strength. Moreover, we&rsquo;ve seen that these nato weapons are incredible the u.s&rsquo;s weaponry</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re in support of providing weapons to ukraine</p>
<p>nato</p>
<p>The eu the european countries i&rsquo;m not in favor of creating a forever war in eastern europe</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s in the cards. No, but the question is jason</p>
<p>You just said that we have to isolate putin we have to deprive him of any</p>
<p>Of any positive outcome from this war? No. No, I said we have to stop him from evading countries</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we stop him from evading more countries that are he&rsquo;s not gonna invade</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna evade nato countries because he&rsquo;s so outmatched well not nato</p>
<p>But I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of countries that are not in nato</p>
<p>So I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the thing but I mean listen, we discussed this a million times here</p>
<p>Well, I think we both agree. We want the war to end</p>
<p>I think we might just the question is what are you willing to do to end the war?</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You know my point is this that the question is what is putin willing to do in terms of starting wars and evading other countries</p>
<p>And what does the west have to do to react to that?</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t start this war, you know, but anyway, let&rsquo;s move on. I think well, hold on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying we and i&rsquo;ve started this war, but we failed to prevent it through the use of diplomacy</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been my point. Yeah, I think this war</p>
<p>It may be out of our control</p>
<p>I think this war was easily preventable if we had listened and engaged in diplomacy</p>
<p>Easily. Yes. Okay. Yes. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Let me just tell you right now the deal that would end this war is the same deal that was on the table last year</p>
<p>Was zero bloodshed which is ukraine remains a neutral state. There&rsquo;s autonomy for the russian speakers in the donbass and crimea</p>
<p>Basically remains part of russia. That was the deal. That is the deal. That will be the deal the only question</p>
<p>Is does the whole country have to be destroyed? All right</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re going to find out in the coming months. And does the world have to go through a global recession and famine?</p>
<p>These are big questions. Uh, yeah, it&rsquo;s not the sacrifice it takes to stand up to dictators is very significant</p>
<p>And especially ones with nuclear bombs and it will be even worse with taiwan</p>
<p>I mean if we think that this is difficult, can you imagine this kind of escalation with a capable?</p>
<p>Adversary if russia is not super capable and their weapons turned out to not be as strong my god</p>
<p>What would taiwan look like did you guys read this story where?</p>
<p>It was the deputy foreign minister got demoted</p>
<p>and there was all this, um</p>
<p>speculation like why did he get demoted and one of the things that came out was that</p>
<p>you know, he was very very pro russia and</p>
<p>And she is not</p>
<p>And g is not and g is much more hedged and moderate and yeah</p>
<p>You know wanted to have more optionality and felt that he was cornered because I think there was some</p>
<p>What was the quote? I mean nick you can pull it but it was something about like</p>
<p>You know the the strength between basically china and russia is infinite</p>
<p>But that was that was a quote that he said that was a little bit off the reservation it seems and so yeah</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a fence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it&rsquo;s an important story as well</p>
<p>I mean, and you know, it&rsquo;s one of the things that we can look at what&rsquo;s happening in these political situations</p>
<p>I think we probably have 50 60 70 percent of the information not even not even really quick</p>
<p>Tell us what&rsquo;s going on in alpha fold world sultan of science</p>
<p>There was a paper published about two weeks ago in the journal science. It&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>An important paper because it used alpha fold</p>
<p>Uh to do some really important work and the work is to actually create</p>
<p>a 3d</p>
<p>structure 3d model</p>
<p>of the nuclear pore complex and that nuclear pore complex is really the</p>
<p>Scaffolding that makes up the nucleus of a cell so all eukaryotes, you know</p>
<p>All plants and animals have a nucleus in our cells and the nucleus holds the dna</p>
<p>And the big question freeberg&rsquo;s internet connection is getting bored</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Just let him finish his sentence did it break up</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine. Keep going. No your internet connection</p>
<p>Because it was so boring what you&rsquo;re talking about keep going</p>
<p>So what does this mean in terms of well, hold on?</p>
<p>So, um, so what this team did and this is a the problem that&rsquo;s uh kind of been around for decades</p>
<p>Is we&rsquo;ve never really understood</p>
<p>What the physical structure of the nucleus in a cell looks like and this is important because the physical structure</p>
<p>Regulates how molecules get into and out of the nucleus</p>
<p>And how dna is expressed and how the rna that comes out of the dna goes into the rest of the cell</p>
<p>And this regulates so much of human health. In fact, it&rsquo;s been shown and demonstrated</p>
<p>that dysfunction</p>
<p>in the nuclear pores or the nuclear pore complex in the cell</p>
<p>Um can lead to things like viral infection brain injury</p>
<p>cancers</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>Many diseases their underlying driver may result from dysfunction</p>
<p>In the transmission of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell</p>
<p>And so scientists have always tried to figure out what does that transport mechanism look like? What does that infrastructure?</p>
<p>look like</p>
<p>And um, so for the first time and scientists have published theories on this and they&rsquo;ve shown using x-ray</p>
<p>imaging</p>
<p>You know some theory around what these complexes look like</p>
<p>Um, and what this team at harvard did that they published two weeks ago is a really groundbreaking</p>
<p>Extremely detailed view of the entire nuclear comp nuclear pore complex around the nucleus of the cell</p>
<p>by combining</p>
<p>Both x-ray imaging and alpha fold. And so what they did is they took the predicted physical structure of those proteins</p>
<p>From alpha fold and use that to construct a sample of what the you know, the nuclear pore complex looks like</p>
<p>How do they know it&rsquo;s accurate?</p>
<p>And so using this x-ray imaging they&rsquo;ve been able to kind of verify some of the assumptions</p>
<p>Alpha fold yields and now they&rsquo;ve created this 3d model</p>
<p>And this 3d model now gives and by the way just to think about this physically what it means like for a second</p>
<p>The nuclear pore complex think about it as like a fence like a spherical fence that sits around the nucleus</p>
<p>And some parts of that fence open and close</p>
<p>Some parts are static</p>
<p>And the way that certain things open and close and what can fit through them and how they fit through and how stuff gets stuck</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to understand as a way to both</p>
<p>Um understand the underlying cause of diseases like cancer</p>
<p>But also how we can create therapeutics and how we can target specific things that we can fix</p>
<p>And how we can get molecules into the nucleus of the cell to regulate dna expression and edit the dna inside</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mind-blowing. So wait if I were to translate this from nerd</p>
<p>You basically alpha fold predicted. No, i&rsquo;m being sincere</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a map here that we were not able to see through x-rays and through you know, physics physics</p>
<p>But alpha fold predicted some of that and filled in the gaps. So now we have the map has been filled</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great that&rsquo;s a great way to describe it</p>
<p>And so now we have this incredibly detailed 3d image and nick can share the images on our youtube. Um</p>
<p>Stream here of what the nuclear pore complex looks like and how each of those pores work. How do they open and close?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the structure of them? This isn&rsquo;t simply like a circle</p>
<p>This is like all these weird tentacles and little things sticking out and that can help us predict what molecules get stuck</p>
<p>And how one error in one of those proteins can cause things to get like a cancer or something like that</p>
<p>How this can cause certain dna to be overexpressed or underexpressed causing things like cancer</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to live forever a whole new area of research in medicine</p>
<p>Gene therapy and new things that we can think about targeting to fix a lot of these underlying diseases</p>
<p>And so this was a groundbreaking paper</p>
<p>Incredible. What&rsquo;s the name of the paper?</p>
<p>Can we just get the name of the paper so people can google it? We&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes as well</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s been an amazing episode. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a team out of harvard</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll send the link in the in the show notes structure of cytoplasmic ring of nuclear pore complex by integrative cryo em and alpha fold</p>
<p>Uh terrible naming not for the general audience</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s okay. Sax is printing it out right now, and he&rsquo;s going to use it for his</p>
<p>His new kittens, but I just want to highlight, you know, because we talked about alpha fold</p>
<p>I think last year or the year before and how it was going to open up all these new areas of research</p>
<p>Here we are a year later</p>
<p>Incredible example of how alpha fold&rsquo;s been used to solve this really misunderstood or never really well understood</p>
<p>Aspect of biology that is at the root cause of so much of disease and creates all this opportunity for medicine and therapeutics</p>
<p>Research and discovery. All right, this is it&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s great to see this breakthrough. Sorry</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get to january 6th or uh, roe v wade. We&rsquo;ll get to those the next episode and we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>Listen, I think roe v wade. I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s uh, I mean do something about the reactions</p>
<p>But we did a pretty thorough episode. So folks really want us to double click we double clicked with two</p>
<p>Of the most constitutional experts in the space when it first got leaked. So please go and watch</p>
<p>Yeah, or listen to that. All right</p>
<p>Which episode is that number? I don&rsquo;t know which we&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be in the show notes for everybody and we&rsquo;ll see you all next time. Bye. Bye</p>
<p>Bye. Bye. Bye. Love you</p>
<p>Rain man david</p>
<p>And instead we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it love you queen of</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
