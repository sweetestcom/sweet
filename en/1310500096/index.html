    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Schwarzman,</p>
<p>CEO and cofounder of Blackstone,</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s leading investment firms</p>
<p>with over $530 billion of assets under management.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most successful business leaders in history.</p>
<p>I recommend his recent book called What It Takes</p>
<p>that tells stories and lessons from his personal journey.</p>
<p>Stephen is a philanthropist</p>
<p>and one of the wealthiest people in the world,</p>
<p>recently signing the Giving Pledge,</p>
<p>thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth</p>
<p>to philanthropic causes.</p>
<p>As an example, in 2018, he donated $350 million to MIT</p>
<p>to help establish his new College of Computing,</p>
<p>the mission of which promotes interdisciplinary, big,</p>
<p>bold research in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>For those of you who know me,</p>
<p>know that MIT is near and dear to my heart</p>
<p>and always will be.</p>
<p>It was and is a place where I believe big, bold,</p>
<p>revolutionary ideas have a home,</p>
<p>and that is what is needed</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence research in the coming decades.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s institutional challenges,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s power</p>
<p>in the passion of individual researchers,</p>
<p>from undergrad to PhD,</p>
<p>from young scientists to senior faculty.</p>
<p>I believe the dream to build intelligence systems</p>
<p>burns brighter than ever in the halls of MIT.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded recently,</p>
<p>but before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the burden of this crisis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong, we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Masterclass,</p>
<p>I thought it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>For $180 a year, you get an all access pass</p>
<p>to watch courses from, to list some of my favorites,</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield on Space Exploration,</p>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson on Scientific Thinking and Communication,</p>
<p>Will Wright, creator of SimCity and Sims on game design,</p>
<p>Carlos Santana on guitar, Gary Kasparov on chess,</p>
<p>Daniel Negrano on poker, and many, many more.</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work,</p>
<p>and the experience of being launched into space alone</p>
<p>is worth the money.</p>
<p>By the way, you can watch it on basically any device.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using ExpressVPN for many years.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to use, press the big power on button,</p>
<p>and your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>And, if you like, you can make it look</p>
<p>like your location is anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>I might be in Boston now, but it can make you look like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in New York, London, Paris,</p>
<p>or anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>This has a large number of obvious benefits.</p>
<p>Certainly, it allows you to access international versions</p>
<p>of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix</p>
<p>or the UK Hulu.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.</p>
<p>I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu 2004,</p>
<p>Windows, Android, but it&rsquo;s available everywhere else too.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Stephen Schwarzman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a tough question.</p>
<p>What idea do you believe,</p>
<p>whether grounded in data or in intuition,</p>
<p>that many people you respect disagree with you on?</p>
<p>Well, there isn&rsquo;t all that much anymore</p>
<p>since the world&rsquo;s so transparent.</p>
<p>But one of the things I believe in and put it in the book,</p>
<p>the book, what it takes is if you&rsquo;re gonna do something,</p>
<p>do something very consequential.</p>
<p>Do something that&rsquo;s quite large, if you can, that&rsquo;s unique.</p>
<p>Because if you operate in that kind of space,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re successful, it&rsquo;s a huge impact.</p>
<p>The prospect of success enables you to recruit people</p>
<p>who wanna be part of that.</p>
<p>And those type of large opportunities</p>
<p>are pretty easily described.</p>
<p>And so, not everybody likes to operate at scale.</p>
<p>Some people like to do small things</p>
<p>because it is meaningful for them emotionally.</p>
<p>And so, occasionally, you get a disagreement on that.</p>
<p>But those are life choices rather than commercial choices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>What good and bad comes with going big?</p>
<p>We often, in America, think big is good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the benefit, what&rsquo;s the cost</p>
<p>in terms of just bigger than business,</p>
<p>but life, happiness, the pursuit of happiness?</p>
<p>Well, you do things that make you happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mandated.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And some people, if they have talent,</p>
<p>like playing pro football,</p>
<p>other people just like throwing the ball around,</p>
<p>not even being on a team.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s better?</p>
<p>Depends what your objectives are.</p>
<p>Depends what your talent is.</p>
<p>Depends what gives you joy.</p>
<p>So, in terms of going big,</p>
<p>is it both for impact on the world</p>
<p>and because you personally gives you joy?</p>
<p>Well, it makes it easier to succeed, actually.</p>
<p>Because if you catch something, for example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cyclical, that&rsquo;s a huge opportunity,</p>
<p>then you usually can find some place</p>
<p>within that huge opportunity where you can make it work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re prosecuting a really small thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wrong, you don&rsquo;t have many places to go.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve always found that the easy place to be</p>
<p>and the ability where you can concentrate human resources,</p>
<p>get people excited about doing really impactful big things,</p>
<p>and you can afford to pay them, actually.</p>
<p>Because the bigger thing can generate much more</p>
<p>in the way of financial resources.</p>
<p>So, that brings people out of talent to help you.</p>
<p>And so, all together, it&rsquo;s a virtuous circle, I think.</p>
<p>How do you know an opportunity when you see one</p>
<p>in terms of the one you wanna go big on?</p>
<p>Is it intuition, is it facts?</p>
<p>Is it back and forth deliberation with people you trust?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process?</p>
<p>Is it art, is it science?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s pattern recognition.</p>
<p>And how do you get to pattern recognition?</p>
<p>First, you need to understand the patterns</p>
<p>and the changes that are happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s either, it&rsquo;s observational on some level.</p>
<p>You can call it data or you can just call it listening</p>
<p>to unusual things that people are saying</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t said before.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always tried to describe this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like seeing a piece of white lint on a black dress.</p>
<p>But most people disregard that piece of lint.</p>
<p>They just see the dress.</p>
<p>I always see the lint.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by how did something get someplace</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not supposed to be?</p>
<p>So, it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be a big discrepancy.</p>
<p>But if something shouldn&rsquo;t be someplace</p>
<p>in a constellation of facts that sort of made sense</p>
<p>in a traditional way, I&rsquo;ve learned that if you focus</p>
<p>on why one discordant note is there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a key to something important.</p>
<p>And if you can find two of those discordant notes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a straight line to someplace.</p>
<p>And that someplace is not where you&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>And usually when you figure out that things are changing</p>
<p>or have changed and you describe them,</p>
<p>which you have to be able to do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not some odd intuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just focusing on facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a scientific discovery, if you will.</p>
<p>When you describe it to other people in the real world,</p>
<p>they tend to do absolutely nothing about it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because humans are comfortable</p>
<p>in their own reality.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s no particular reason at that moment</p>
<p>to shake them out of their reality,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll stay in it even if they&rsquo;re ultimately</p>
<p>completely wrong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been stunned that when I explain</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going, what we&rsquo;re doing and why,</p>
<p>almost everyone just says, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And they continue doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s pretty easy to do that.</p>
<p>But what you need is a huge data set.</p>
<p>So before AI and people&rsquo;s focus on data,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sort of been doing this mostly my whole life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a scientist, I&rsquo;m not let alone a computer scientist.</p>
<p>And you can just hear what people are saying</p>
<p>when somebody says something or you observe something</p>
<p>that simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you really go to work.</p>
<p>The rest of it&rsquo;s just processing.</p>
<p>You know, on a quick tangent,</p>
<p>pattern recognition is a term often used</p>
<p>throughout the history of AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is pattern recognition, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, I would say, various flavors of that.</p>
<p>So usually pattern recognition refers to the process</p>
<p>of the, we said dress and the lint on the dress.</p>
<p>Pattern recognition is very good at identifying the dress</p>
<p>as looking at the pattern that&rsquo;s always there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very common and so on.</p>
<p>You almost refer to a pattern that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called outlier detection in computer science,</p>
<p>right, the rare thing, the small thing.</p>
<p>Now, AI is not often good at that.</p>
<p>Do you, just almost philosophically,</p>
<p>the kind of decisions you made in your life</p>
<p>based scientifically almost on data,</p>
<p>do you think AI in the future will be able to do?</p>
<p>Is it something that could be put down into code</p>
<p>or is it still deeply human?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough for me to say since I don&rsquo;t have domain knowledge</p>
<p>in AI to know everything that could or might occur.</p>
<p>I know, sort of in my own case,</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t see any of that.</p>
<p>I just assumed it was motivational, you know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also sort of, it&rsquo;s hardwiring.</p>
<p>What are you wired or programmed to be finding or looking for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what happens every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not interesting, frankly.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what people mostly do.</p>
<p>I do a bunch of that too because, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you do in normal life.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always been completely fascinated</p>
<p>by the stuff that doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>Or the other way of thinking about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s determining what people want</p>
<p>without them saying it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different kind of pattern.</p>
<p>You can see everything they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a missing piece.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s missing given the other facts.</p>
<p>You know about them and you deliver that</p>
<p>and then that becomes, you know,</p>
<p>sort of very easy to sell to them.</p>
<p>To linger on this point a little bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned that in your family,</p>
<p>when you were growing up,</p>
<p>nobody raised their voice in anger or otherwise.</p>
<p>And you said that this allows you to learn to listen</p>
<p>and hear some interesting things.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate as you have been on that idea,</p>
<p>what do you hear about the world if you listen?</p>
<p>Well, you have to listen really intensely</p>
<p>to understand what people are saying</p>
<p>as well as what people are intending</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not necessarily the same thing.</p>
<p>And people mostly give themselves away</p>
<p>no matter how clever they think they are.</p>
<p>Particularly if you have the full array of inputs.</p>
<p>In other words, if you look at their face,</p>
<p>you look at their eyes, which are the window on the soul,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to conceal what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>You look at facial expressions and posture.</p>
<p>You listen to their voice, which changes.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re comfortable with or not,</p>
<p>are you speaking faster?</p>
<p>Is the amplitude of what you&rsquo;re saying higher?</p>
<p>Most people just give away what&rsquo;s really on their mind.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re not that clever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re busy spending their time thinking about</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re in the process of saying.</p>
<p>And so if you just observe that, not in a hostile way,</p>
<p>but just in an evocative way</p>
<p>and just let them talk for a while,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll more or less tell you almost completely</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>even the stuff they don&rsquo;t want you to know.</p>
<p>And once you know that, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of easy to play that kind of game</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve already told you</p>
<p>everything you need to know.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s easy to get to a conclusion</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s meant to be one, an area of common interest,</p>
<p>since you know almost exactly what&rsquo;s on their mind.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an enormous advantage</p>
<p>as opposed to just walking in someplace</p>
<p>and somebody telling you something</p>
<p>and you believing what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>There are so many different levels of communication.</p>
<p>So a powerful approach to life you discuss in the book</p>
<p>on the topic of listening and really hearing people</p>
<p>is figuring out what the biggest problem,</p>
<p>bothering a particular individual or group is</p>
<p>and coming up with a solution to that problem</p>
<p>and presenting them with a solution, right?</p>
<p>In fact, you brilliantly describe a lot of simple things</p>
<p>that most people just don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of obvious,</p>
<p>find the problem that&rsquo;s bothering somebody deeply.</p>
<p>And as you said, I think you&rsquo;ve implied</p>
<p>that they will usually tell you what the problem is,</p>
<p>but can you talk about this process</p>
<p>of seeing what the biggest problem for a person is,</p>
<p>trying to solve it,</p>
<p>and maybe a particularly memorable example?</p>
<p>Sure, if you know you&rsquo;re gonna meet somebody,</p>
<p>there are two types of situations, chance meetings,</p>
<p>and the second is you know you&rsquo;re gonna meet somebody.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take the easiest one,</p>
<p>which is you know you&rsquo;re gonna meet somebody.</p>
<p>And you start trying to make pretend you&rsquo;re them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s on their mind?</p>
<p>What are they thinking about in their daily life?</p>
<p>What are the big problems they&rsquo;re facing?</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re, you know, to make it a really easy example,</p>
<p>you know, make pretend, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like president of the United States.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to be this president, could be any president.</p>
<p>So you sort of know what&rsquo;s more or less on their mind</p>
<p>because the press keeps reporting it.</p>
<p>And you see it on television, you hear it.</p>
<p>People discuss it.</p>
<p>So you know if you&rsquo;re gonna be running into somebody</p>
<p>in that kind of position.</p>
<p>You sort of know what they look like already.</p>
<p>You know what they sound like.</p>
<p>You know what their voice is like.</p>
<p>And you know what they&rsquo;re focused on.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re gonna meet somebody like that,</p>
<p>what you should do is take the biggest unresolved issue</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re facing and come up with</p>
<p>a few interesting solutions</p>
<p>that basically haven&rsquo;t been out there.</p>
<p>Or that you haven&rsquo;t heard anybody else</p>
<p>always thinking about.</p>
<p>So just to give you an example,</p>
<p>I was sort of in the early 1990s</p>
<p>and I was invited to something at the White House</p>
<p>which was a big deal for me because I was like,</p>
<p>you know, a person from no place.</p>
<p>And you know, I had met the president once before</p>
<p>because it was President Bush</p>
<p>because his son was in my dormitory.</p>
<p>So I had met him at Parents Day.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just like the oddity of things.</p>
<p>So I knew I was gonna see him</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the invitation came from.</p>
<p>And so there was something going on</p>
<p>and I just thought about two or three ways</p>
<p>to approach that issue.</p>
<p>And you know, at that point I was separated</p>
<p>and so I had brought a date to the White House</p>
<p>and so I saw the president</p>
<p>and we sort of went over in a corner for about 10 minutes</p>
<p>and discussed whatever this issue was.</p>
<p>And I later went back to my date.</p>
<p>It was a little rude</p>
<p>but it was meant to be confidential conversation</p>
<p>and I barely knew her.</p>
<p>And you know, she said,</p>
<p>what were you talking about all that time?</p>
<p>I said, well, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something going on in the world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve thought about different ways</p>
<p>of perhaps approaching that and he was interested.</p>
<p>And the answer is of course he was interested.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be interested?</p>
<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy outcome.</p>
<p>And so, you know, conversations of that type,</p>
<p>once somebody knows you&rsquo;re really thinking</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s good for them and good for the situation,</p>
<p>it has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really about being in service,</p>
<p>you know, to the situation.</p>
<p>Then people trust you and they&rsquo;ll tell you other things</p>
<p>because they know your motives are basically very pure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to resolve a difficult situation</p>
<p>or help somebody do it.</p>
<p>So these types of things, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a planned situation, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just come upon somebody</p>
<p>and they start talking and you know,</p>
<p>that requires, you know, like different skills.</p>
<p>You know, you can ask them,</p>
<p>what have you been working on lately?</p>
<p>What are you thinking about?</p>
<p>You can ask them, you know,</p>
<p>has anything been particularly difficult?</p>
<p>And you know, you can ask most people</p>
<p>if they trust you for some reason, they&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>And then you have to instantly go to work on it.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s not as good</p>
<p>as having some advanced planning,</p>
<p>but you know, almost everything going on is like out there.</p>
<p>And people who are involved with interesting situations,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re playing in the same ecosystem.</p>
<p>They just have different roles in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And you know, you could do that</p>
<p>with somebody who owns a pro football team</p>
<p>that loses all the time.</p>
<p>We specialize in those in New York.</p>
<p>And you know, you already have analyzed</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re losing, right?</p>
<p>Inevitably, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t have a great quarterback,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a great coach,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a great general manager</p>
<p>who knows how to hire the best talent.</p>
<p>Those are the three reasons why a team fails, right?</p>
<p>Because there are salary caps,</p>
<p>so every team pays a certain amount of money</p>
<p>for all their players.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gotta be those three positions.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking with somebody like that,</p>
<p>inevitably, even though it&rsquo;s not structured,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know how their team&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll know pretty much why.</p>
<p>And if you start asking questions about that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re typically very happy to talk about it</p>
<p>because they haven&rsquo;t solved that problem.</p>
<p>In some cases, they don&rsquo;t even know that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to see it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I do stuff like that,</p>
<p>which I find is intuitive as a process,</p>
<p>but, you know, leads to really good results.</p>
<p>Well, the funny thing is when you&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>for smart people, it&rsquo;s hard to escape their own ego</p>
<p>and the space of their own problems,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to think about other people&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>It requires for you to let go of the fact</p>
<p>that your own problems are all important</p>
<p>and then to talk about your,</p>
<p>I think while it seems obvious</p>
<p>and I think quite brilliant,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a difficult leap for many people,</p>
<p>especially smart people,</p>
<p>to empathize with, truly empathize with the problems</p>
<p>of others.</p>
<p>Well, I have a competitive advantage,</p>
<p>which is, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m so smart.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not a problem for me.</p>
<p>Well, the truly smartest people I know</p>
<p>say that exact same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, being humble is really useful,</p>
<p>competitive advantage, as you said.</p>
<p>How do you stay humble?</p>
<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t changed much.</p>
<p>Since?</p>
<p>Since I was in my mid teens.</p>
<p>You know, I was raised partly in the city</p>
<p>and partly in the suburbs.</p>
<p>And, you know, whatever the values I had at that time,</p>
<p>those are still my values.</p>
<p>I call them like middle class values,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I was raised.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never changed, why would I?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who I am.</p>
<p>And so the accoutrement of, you know,</p>
<p>the rest of your life has gotta be put on the same,</p>
<p>you know, like solid foundation of who you are.</p>
<p>Because if you start losing who you really are,</p>
<p>who are you?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never had the desire to be somebody else.</p>
<p>I just do other things now that I wouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>as a, you know, sort of as a middle class kid</p>
<p>from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I mean, my life has morphed on a certain level.</p>
<p>But part of the strength of having integrity</p>
<p>of personality is that you can remain in touch</p>
<p>with everybody who comes from that kind of background.</p>
<p>And, you know, even though I do some things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t like that, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of people I meet or situations I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>I always look at it through the same lens.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very psychologically comfortable</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t require me to make any real adjustments</p>
<p>in my life and I just keep plowing ahead.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of activity in progress in recent years</p>
<p>around effective altruism.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring this topic with you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an interesting one from your perspective.</p>
<p>You can put it in any kind of terms,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact.</p>
<p>How do you see the goal of philanthropy,</p>
<p>both from a personal motivation perspective</p>
<p>and the societal big picture impact perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think about philanthropy</p>
<p>the way you would expect me to, okay?</p>
<p>I look at, you know, sort of solving big issues,</p>
<p>addressing big issues, starting new organizations to do it,</p>
<p>much like we do in our business.</p>
<p>You know, we keep growing our business</p>
<p>not by taking the original thing and making it larger,</p>
<p>but continually seeing new things and building those.</p>
<p>And, you know, sort of marshaling financial resources,</p>
<p>human resources, and in our case,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in the investment business,</p>
<p>we find something new that looks like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be terrific and we do that</p>
<p>and it works out really well.</p>
<p>All I do in what you would call philanthropy</p>
<p>is look at other opportunities to help society.</p>
<p>And I end up starting something new,</p>
<p>marshaling people, marshaling a lot of money,</p>
<p>and then at the end of that kind of creative process,</p>
<p>somebody typically asks me to write a check.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wake up and say,</p>
<p>how can I give large amounts of money away?</p>
<p>I look at issues that are important for people.</p>
<p>In some cases, I do smaller things.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s important to a person, and, you know,</p>
<p>I can relate to that person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some unfairness that&rsquo;s happened to them.</p>
<p>And so in situations like that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give money anonymously and help them out.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s like a miniature version</p>
<p>of addressing something really big.</p>
<p>So, you know, at MIT, I&rsquo;m a little bit</p>
<p>you know, at MIT, I&rsquo;ve done a big thing,</p>
<p>you know, helping to start this new school of computing.</p>
<p>And I did that because, you know,</p>
<p>I saw that, you know, there&rsquo;s sort of like a global race on</p>
<p>in AI, quantum, and other major technologies.</p>
<p>And I thought that the US could use more enhancement</p>
<p>from a competitive perspective.</p>
<p>And I also, because I get to China a lot</p>
<p>and I travel around a lot compared to a regular person,</p>
<p>you know, I can see the need to have control</p>
<p>of these types of technologies.</p>
<p>So when they&rsquo;re introduced, we don&rsquo;t create a mess</p>
<p>like we did with the internet and with social media.</p>
<p>Unintended consequence, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating all kinds of issues and freedom of speech</p>
<p>and the functioning of liberal democracies.</p>
<p>So with AI, it was pretty clear</p>
<p>that there was enormous difference of views</p>
<p>around the world by the relatively few practitioners</p>
<p>in the world who really knew what was going on.</p>
<p>And by accident, I knew a bunch of these people,</p>
<p>you know, who were like big famous people.</p>
<p>And I could talk to them and say,</p>
<p>why do you think this is a force for bad?</p>
<p>And someone else, why do you feel this is a force for good?</p>
<p>And how do we move forward with the technology</p>
<p>by the same time, make sure that whatever is potentially,</p>
<p>you know, sort of on the bad side of this technology</p>
<p>with, you know, for example, disruption of workforces</p>
<p>and things like that, that could happen much faster</p>
<p>than the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>What do we do about that?</p>
<p>And how do we keep that under control</p>
<p>so that the really good things about these technologies,</p>
<p>which will be great things,</p>
<p>not good things are allowed to happen?</p>
<p>So to me, you know, this was one of the great issues</p>
<p>facing society.</p>
<p>The number of people who were aware of it were very small.</p>
<p>I just accidentally got sucked into it.</p>
<p>And as soon as I saw it, I went, oh my God, this is mega,</p>
<p>both on a competitive basis globally,</p>
<p>but also in terms of protecting society</p>
<p>and benefiting society.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I got involved.</p>
<p>And at the end, you know, sort of the right thing</p>
<p>that we figured out was, you know,</p>
<p>sort of double MIT&rsquo;s computer science faculty</p>
<p>and basically create the first AI enabled university</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And, you know, in effect, be an example,</p>
<p>a beacon to the rest of the research community</p>
<p>around the world academically,</p>
<p>and create, you know, a much more robust U.S. situation,</p>
<p>competitive situation among the universities.</p>
<p>Because if MIT was going to raise a lot of money</p>
<p>and double its faculty, well, you could bet that,</p>
<p>you know, a number of other universities</p>
<p>were going to do the same thing.</p>
<p>At the end of it, it would be great for knowledge creation,</p>
<p>you know, great for the United States, great for the world.</p>
<p>And so I like to do things that I think are really positive,</p>
<p>things that other people aren&rsquo;t acting on,</p>
<p>that I see for whatever the reason.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s just people I meet and what they say,</p>
<p>and I can recognize when something really profound</p>
<p>is about to happen or needs to.</p>
<p>And I do it, and at the end of the situation,</p>
<p>somebody says, can you write a check to help us?</p>
<p>And then the answer is sure.</p>
<p>I mean, because if I don&rsquo;t, the vision won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the vision of whatever I do</p>
<p>that is compelling.</p>
<p>And essentially, I love that idea of whether it&rsquo;s small</p>
<p>at the individual level or really big,</p>
<p>like the gift to MIT to launch the College of Computing.</p>
<p>It starts with a vision, and you see philanthropy as,</p>
<p>the biggest impact you can have is by launching something new,</p>
<p>especially on an issue that others aren&rsquo;t really addressing.</p>
<p>And I also love the notion, and you&rsquo;re absolutely right,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other universities, Stanford, CMU,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you, that would essentially,</p>
<p>the seed will create other, it&rsquo;ll have a ripple effect</p>
<p>that potentially might help US be a leader</p>
<p>or continue to be a leader in AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s potentially a very transformative research</p>
<p>direction.</p>
<p>Just to linger on that point a little bit,</p>
<p>what is your hope long term for the impact</p>
<p>the college here at MIT might have in the next five, 10,</p>
<p>even 20, or let&rsquo;s get crazy, 30, 50 years?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very difficult to predict the future</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with knowledge production</p>
<p>and creativity.</p>
<p>MIT has, obviously, some unique aspects.</p>
<p>Globally, there&rsquo;s four big academic surveys.</p>
<p>I forget whether it was QS, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the Times in London, the US News, and whatever.</p>
<p>And one of these recently, MIT, was ranked number one</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>So leave aside whether you&rsquo;re number three somewhere else,</p>
<p>in the great sweep of humanity, this is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>So you have a really remarkable aggregation of human talent</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And where it goes, it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>You have to be a scientist to have the right feel.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s important is you have a critical mass of people.</p>
<p>And I think it breaks into two buckets.</p>
<p>One is scientific advancement.</p>
<p>And if the new college can help either</p>
<p>serve as a convening force within the university</p>
<p>or help coordination and communication among people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing, absolute good thing.</p>
<p>The second thing is in the AI ethics area,</p>
<p>which is, in a way, equally important.</p>
<p>Because if the science side creates blowback</p>
<p>so that science is a bit crippled in terms</p>
<p>of going forward because society&rsquo;s reaction to knowledge</p>
<p>advancement in this field becomes really hostile,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve sort of lost the game</p>
<p>in terms of scientific progress and innovation.</p>
<p>And so the AI ethics piece is super important</p>
<p>because in a perfect world, MIT would</p>
<p>serve as a global convener.</p>
<p>Because what you need is you need the research universities.</p>
<p>You need the companies that are driving AI and quantum work.</p>
<p>You need governments who will ultimately</p>
<p>be regulating certain elements of this.</p>
<p>And you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trained</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t get overreactions to one situation, which then goes</p>
<p>viral and it ends up shutting down</p>
<p>avenues that are perfectly fine to be walking down or running</p>
<p>down that avenue.</p>
<p>But if enough discordant information,</p>
<p>not even correct necessarily, sort of gets</p>
<p>pushed around society, then you can end up</p>
<p>with a really hostile regulatory environment and other things.</p>
<p>So you have four drivers that have</p>
<p>to be sort of integrated.</p>
<p>And so if the new school of computing</p>
<p>can be really helpful in that regard,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a real service to science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a service to MIT.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I wanted to get involved for both areas.</p>
<p>And the hope is for me, for others,</p>
<p>for everyone, for the world, is for this particular college</p>
<p>of computing to be a beacon and a connector for these ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think MIT is perfectly positioned to do that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned the media, social media, the internet</p>
<p>as this complex network of communication with flaws,</p>
<p>perhaps, perhaps you can speak to them.</p>
<p>But I personally think that science and technology</p>
<p>has its flaws, but ultimately is, one, sexy, exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way for us to explore and understand</p>
<p>the mysteries of our world.</p>
<p>And two, perhaps more importantly for some people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge way to, a really powerful way</p>
<p>to grow the economy, to improve the quality of life</p>
<p>for everyone.</p>
<p>So how do we get, how do you see the media, social media,</p>
<p>the internet as a society having a healthy discourse</p>
<p>about science, first of all, one that&rsquo;s factual</p>
<p>and two, one that finds science exciting,</p>
<p>that invests in science, that pushes it forward,</p>
<p>especially in this science fiction, fear filled field</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s a little above my pay grade</p>
<p>because trying to control social media</p>
<p>to make it do what you want to do</p>
<p>appears to be beyond almost anybody&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>And the technology is being used to create</p>
<p>what I call the tyranny of the minorities.</p>
<p>A minority is defined as two or three people</p>
<p>on a street corner.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what they look like.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter where they came from.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re united by that one issue that they care about.</p>
<p>And their job is to enforce their views on the world.</p>
<p>And in the political world, people just</p>
<p>are manufacturing truth.</p>
<p>And they throw it all over.</p>
<p>And it affects all of us.</p>
<p>And sometimes people are just hired to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And you think it&rsquo;s one person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just sort of a front for a particular point of view.</p>
<p>And this has become exceptionally disruptive</p>
<p>for society.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s undercutting the ability of liberal democracies</p>
<p>to function.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to get a grip on this.</p>
<p>And I was really surprised when we was up here</p>
<p>for the announcement last spring of the College of Computing.</p>
<p>And they had all these famous scientists, some of whom</p>
<p>were involved with the invention of the internet.</p>
<p>And almost every one of them got up and said,</p>
<p>I think I made a mistake.</p>
<p>And as a non scientist, I never thought</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hear anyone say that.</p>
<p>And what they said is, more or less, to make it simple,</p>
<p>we thought this would be really cool inventing the internet.</p>
<p>We could connect everyone in the world.</p>
<p>We can move knowledge around.</p>
<p>It was instantaneous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really amazing thing.</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t know that there was anyone</p>
<p>who ever thought about social media coming out of that</p>
<p>and the actual consequences for people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always some younger person.</p>
<p>I just saw one of these yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reported on the national news</p>
<p>who killed himself when people use social media</p>
<p>to basically sort of ridicule him or something of that type.</p>
<p>This is dead.</p>
<p>This is dangerous.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t have a solution for that other</p>
<p>than going forward, you can end up</p>
<p>with this type of outcome using AI.</p>
<p>To make this kind of mistake twice is unforgivable.</p>
<p>So interestingly, at least in the West and parts of China,</p>
<p>people are quite sympathetic to the whole concept of AI ethics</p>
<p>and what gets introduced when and cooperation</p>
<p>within your own country, within your own industry,</p>
<p>as well as globally to make sure</p>
<p>that the technology is a force for good.</p>
<p>And that really interesting topic.</p>
<p>Since 2007, you&rsquo;ve had a relationship</p>
<p>with senior leadership with a lot of people in China</p>
<p>and an interest in understanding modern China,</p>
<p>their culture, their world, much like with Russia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Russia originally.</p>
<p>Americans are told a very narrow, one sided story</p>
<p>about China that I&rsquo;m sure misses a lot</p>
<p>of fascinating complexity, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>What lessons about Chinese culture, its ideas as a nation,</p>
<p>its future do you think Americans should know about,</p>
<p>deliberate on, think about?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s sort of a wide question</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re asking about.</p>
<p>China is a pretty unusual place.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physically huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a billion three people.</p>
<p>And the character of the people isn&rsquo;t as well understood</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Chinese people are amazingly energetic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of a billion three people,</p>
<p>one of the things you&rsquo;ve got to be focused on</p>
<p>is how do you make your way through a crowd</p>
<p>of a billion 2.99999 other people.</p>
<p>No, the word for that is competitive.</p>
<p>Yes, they are individually highly energetic,</p>
<p>highly focused, always looking for some opportunity</p>
<p>for themselves because they need to,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of just literally people</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;ve found is they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try and find a way to win for themselves.</p>
<p>And their country is complicated because it basically</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the same kind of functional laws</p>
<p>that we do in the United States and the West.</p>
<p>And the country is controlled really</p>
<p>through a web of relationships you have with other people</p>
<p>and the relationships that those other people have</p>
<p>with other people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredibly dynamic culture</p>
<p>where if somebody knocks somebody up</p>
<p>on the top who&rsquo;s three levels above you</p>
<p>and is, in effect, protecting you,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re like a floating molecule there</p>
<p>without tethering except the one or two layers above you.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s going to get affected.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very dynamic system.</p>
<p>And getting people to change is not that easy</p>
<p>because if there aren&rsquo;t really functioning laws,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only the relationships that everybody has.</p>
<p>And so when you decide to make a major change</p>
<p>and you sign up for it, something</p>
<p>is changing in your life.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t necessarily be all the same people on your team.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very high risk enterprise.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re dealing with China,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to know almost what everybody&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>is with somebody.</p>
<p>So when you suggest doing something differently,</p>
<p>you line up these forces.</p>
<p>In the West, it&rsquo;s usually you talk to a person</p>
<p>and they figure out what&rsquo;s good for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier.</p>
<p>And in that sense, in a funny way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to make change in the West,</p>
<p>just the opposite of what people think.</p>
<p>But once the Chinese system adjusts</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s new, everybody&rsquo;s on the team.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to change them.</p>
<p>But once they&rsquo;re changed, they are incredibly focused in a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard for the West to do</p>
<p>in a more individualistic culture.</p>
<p>So there are all kinds of fascinating things.</p>
<p>One thing that might interest the people who are listening</p>
<p>who are more technologically based than some other group.</p>
<p>I was with one of the top people in the government</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, and he was telling me that every school</p>
<p>child in China is going to be taught computer science.</p>
<p>Now, imagine 100% of these children.</p>
<p>This is such a large number of human beings.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that every one of them</p>
<p>will be good at computer science.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s sort of like in the West,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like math or English, everybody&rsquo;s going to take it.</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s great at English.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t write books.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t write poetry.</p>
<p>And not everybody&rsquo;s good at math.</p>
<p>Somebody like myself, I sort of evolved to the third grade,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still doing flashcards.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make it further in math.</p>
<p>But imagine everybody in their society</p>
<p>is going to be involved with computer science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just even pause on that.</p>
<p>I think computer science involves,</p>
<p>at the basic beginner level, programming.</p>
<p>And the idea that everybody in the society</p>
<p>would have some ability to program a computer is incredible.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s incredibly exciting,</p>
<p>and I think that should give the United States pause</p>
<p>and consider what&hellip;</p>
<p>Talking about sort of philanthropy and launching things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing like launching,</p>
<p>sort of investing in young youth, the education system,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where everything launches.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve got a complicated system</p>
<p>because we have over 3,000 school districts</p>
<p>around the country.</p>
<p>China doesn&rsquo;t worry about that as a concept.</p>
<p>They make a decision at the very top of the government</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what they want to have happen,</p>
<p>and that is what will happen.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really handicapped by this distributed power</p>
<p>in the education area,</p>
<p>although some people involved with that area</p>
<p>will think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But you would know better than I do</p>
<p>what percent of American children</p>
<p>have computer science exposure.</p>
<p>My guess, no knowledge, would be 5% or less.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to be going into a world</p>
<p>where the other major economic power,</p>
<p>sort of like ourselves, has got like 100% and we got 5%,</p>
<p>and the whole computer science area is the future,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re purposely or accidentally actually</p>
<p>handicapping ourselves,</p>
<p>and our system doesn&rsquo;t allow us to adjust quickly to that.</p>
<p>So, you know, issues like this I find fascinating.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough</p>
<p>to go to other countries, which I do,</p>
<p>and you learn what they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>then it informs what we ought to be doing in the United States.</p>
<p>So the current administration, Donald Trump,</p>
<p>has released an executive order on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with it.</p>
<p>In 2019, looking several years ahead,</p>
<p>how does America sort of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve mentioned in terms of the big impact,</p>
<p>we hope your investment in MIT will have a ripple effect,</p>
<p>but from a federal perspective, from a government perspective,</p>
<p>how does America establish, with respect to China,</p>
<p>leadership in the world at the top</p>
<p>for research and development in AI?</p>
<p>I think that you have to get the federal government</p>
<p>in the game in a big way,</p>
<p>and that this leap forward technologically,</p>
<p>which is going to happen with or without us,</p>
<p>you know, really should be with us,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an opportunity, in effect,</p>
<p>for another moonshot kind of mobilization</p>
<p>by the United States.</p>
<p>I think the appetite actually is there to do that.</p>
<p>At the moment, what&rsquo;s getting in the way</p>
<p>is the kind of poisonous politics we have,</p>
<p>but if you go below the lack of cooperation,</p>
<p>which is almost the defining element of American democracy</p>
<p>right now in the Congress,</p>
<p>if you talk to individual members, they get it,</p>
<p>and they would like to do something.</p>
<p>Another part of the issue is we&rsquo;re running huge deficits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re running trillion dollar plus deficits.</p>
<p>So how much money do you need for this initiative?</p>
<p>Where does it come from?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s prepared to stand up for it?</p>
<p>Because if it involves taking away resources</p>
<p>from another area, our political system is not real flexible.</p>
<p>To do that, if you&rsquo;re creating this kind of initiative,</p>
<p>which we need, where does the money come from?</p>
<p>And trying to get money</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got trillion dollar deficits,</p>
<p>in a way, could be easy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference of a trillion</p>
<p>and a trillion and a little more?</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s hard with the mechanisms of Congress.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really important is this is not an issue</p>
<p>that is unknown, and it&rsquo;s viewed as a very important issue.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s almost no one in the Congress</p>
<p>when you sit down and explain what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t say, we&rsquo;ve got to do something.</p>
<p>Let me ask the impossible question.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t endorse Donald Trump, but after he was elected,</p>
<p>you have given him advice, which seems to me a great thing</p>
<p>to do, no matter who the president is,</p>
<p>to positively contribute to this nation by giving advice.</p>
<p>And yet, you&rsquo;ve received a lot of criticism for this.</p>
<p>So on the previous topic of science and technology</p>
<p>and government, how do we have a healthy discourse,</p>
<p>give advice, get excited conversation with the government</p>
<p>about science and technology without it becoming politicized?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>So when I was young, before there was a moonshot,</p>
<p>we had a president named John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And in his inaugural address as president,</p>
<p>he asked not what your country can do for you,</p>
<p>but what you can do for your country.</p>
<p>We had a generation of people my age, basically people,</p>
<p>who grew up with that credo.</p>
<p>And sometimes you don&rsquo;t need to innovate.</p>
<p>You can go back to basic principles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good basic principle.</p>
<p>What can we do?</p>
<p>Americans have GDP per capita of around $60,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not equally distributed, but it&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>And people have, I think, an obligation to help</p>
<p>their country.</p>
<p>And I do that.</p>
<p>And apparently, I take some grief from some people who</p>
<p>project on me things I don&rsquo;t even vaguely believe.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m quite simple.</p>
<p>I tried to help the previous president, President Obama.</p>
<p>He was a good guy.</p>
<p>And he was a different party.</p>
<p>And I tried to help President Bush.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a different party.</p>
<p>And I sort of don&rsquo;t care that much about what the parties are.</p>
<p>I care about, even though I&rsquo;m a big donor for the Republicans,</p>
<p>but what motivates me is, what are the problems we&rsquo;re facing?</p>
<p>Can I help people get to a good outcome that</p>
<p>will stand any test?</p>
<p>But we live in a world now where the filters and the hostility</p>
<p>is so unbelievable.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when I went to school and university,</p>
<p>I went to Yale, we had so much stuff going on.</p>
<p>We had a war called the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>We had sort of black power starting.</p>
<p>And we had a sexual revolution with the birth control pill.</p>
<p>And there was one other major thing going on,</p>
<p>the drug revolution.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a generation that</p>
<p>had more stuff going on in a four year period than my era.</p>
<p>Yet, there wasn&rsquo;t this kind of instant hostility</p>
<p>if you believed something different.</p>
<p>Everybody lived together and respected the other person.</p>
<p>And I think that this type of change needs to happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got to happen from the leadership</p>
<p>of our major institutions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that leaders can</p>
<p>be bullied by people who are against sort</p>
<p>of the classical version of free speech</p>
<p>and letting open expression and inquiry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what universities are for, among other things,</p>
<p>Socratic methods.</p>
<p>And so I have, in the midst of this onslaught of oddness,</p>
<p>I believe in still the basic principles.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have to find a way to get back to that.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t start with the people sort of in the middle</p>
<p>to the bottom who are using these kinds of screens</p>
<p>to shout people down and create an uncooperative environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be done at the top with core principles that</p>
<p>are articulated.</p>
<p>And ironically, if people don&rsquo;t sign on</p>
<p>to these kind of core principles where people are equal</p>
<p>and speech can be heard and you don&rsquo;t have these enormous</p>
<p>shout down biases subtly or out loud,</p>
<p>then they don&rsquo;t belong at those institutions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re violating the core principles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you end up making change.</p>
<p>But you have to have courageous people who</p>
<p>are willing to lay that out for the benefit of not just</p>
<p>their institutions, but for society as a whole.</p>
<p>So I believe that will happen.</p>
<p>But it needs the commitment of senior people</p>
<p>to make it happen.</p>
<p>Courage.</p>
<p>And I think for such great leaders, great universities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge hunger for it.</p>
<p>So I am too very optimistic that it will come.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now personally taking a step into building a startup</p>
<p>first time, hoping to change the world, of course.</p>
<p>There are thousands, maybe more, maybe millions</p>
<p>of other first time entrepreneurs like me.</p>
<p>What advice?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gone through this process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the suffering, the emotional turmoil</p>
<p>it all might entail.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for those people taking that step?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a rough ride.</p>
<p>And you have to be psychologically prepared</p>
<p>for things going wrong with frequency.</p>
<p>You have to be prepared to be put in situations where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being asked to solve problems you didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know those problems existed.</p>
<p>For example, renting space, it&rsquo;s not really a problem</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve never done it.</p>
<p>You have no idea what a lease looks like.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know the relevant rent in a market.</p>
<p>So everything is new.</p>
<p>Everything has to be learned.</p>
<p>What you realize is that it&rsquo;s good to have other people</p>
<p>with you who&rsquo;ve had some experience in areas</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an entrepreneur starting</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know much of anything.</p>
<p>So everything is something new.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important not to be alone,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of overwhelming.</p>
<p>And you need somebody to talk to other than a spouse or a loved</p>
<p>one, because even they get bored with your problems.</p>
<p>And so getting a group, if you look at Alibaba,</p>
<p>Jack Ma was telling me they basically</p>
<p>were like at financial death&rsquo;s door at least twice.</p>
<p>And the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t just Jack.</p>
<p>I mean, people think it is, because he</p>
<p>became the sort of public face and the driver.</p>
<p>But a group of people who can give advice,</p>
<p>share situations to talk about, that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just referring to the small details</p>
<p>like renting space.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the psychological burden.</p>
<p>Yeah, and because most entrepreneurs at some point</p>
<p>question what they&rsquo;re doing, because it&rsquo;s not going so well.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re screwing it up, and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to unscrew it up, because we&rsquo;re all learning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to be learning when there are like 25 variables</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re missing four big ones, you can really make a mess.</p>
<p>And so the ability to, in effect, have either an outsider</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really smart that you can rely on</p>
<p>for certain type of things, or other people who are working</p>
<p>with you on a daily basis, most people</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t had experience believe</p>
<p>in the myth of the one person, one great person,</p>
<p>makes outcomes, creates outcomes that are positive.</p>
<p>Most of us, it&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>If you look back over a lot of the big successful tech</p>
<p>companies, it&rsquo;s not typically one person.</p>
<p>And you will know these stories better than I do,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s your world, not mine.</p>
<p>But even I know that almost every one of them</p>
<p>had two people.</p>
<p>If you look at Google, that&rsquo;s what they had.</p>
<p>And that was the same at Microsoft at the beginning.</p>
<p>And it was the same at Apple.</p>
<p>People have different skills.</p>
<p>And they need to play off of other people.</p>
<p>So the advice that I would give you</p>
<p>is make sure you understand that so you don&rsquo;t head off</p>
<p>in some direction as a lone wolf and find that either you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t invent all the solutions or you make bad decisions</p>
<p>on certain types of things.</p>
<p>This is a team sport.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur means you&rsquo;re alone, in effect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the myth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s mostly a myth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, and you talk about this in your book,</p>
<p>and I could talk to you about it forever,</p>
<p>the harshly self critical aspect to your personality</p>
<p>and to mine as well in the face of failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful tool, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a burden that&rsquo;s very interesting to walk that line.</p>
<p>But let me ask in terms of people around you,</p>
<p>in terms of friends, in the bigger</p>
<p>picture of your own life, where do you</p>
<p>put the value of love, family, friendship</p>
<p>in the big picture journey of your life?</p>
<p>Well, ultimately, all journeys are alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to have support.</p>
<p>And when you go forward and say your job is</p>
<p>to make something work, and that&rsquo;s your number one</p>
<p>priority, and you&rsquo;re going to work at it to make it work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like superhuman effort.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t become successful as part time workers.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re prepared to make that 100% to 120% effort,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need support, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to have people involved</p>
<p>with your life who understand that that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>part of your life.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re involved with somebody,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really understand that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a source of conflict and difficulty.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re involved with the right people,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a dating relationship or a spousal</p>
<p>relationship, you have to involve them in your life,</p>
<p>but not burden them with every minor triumph or mistake.</p>
<p>They actually get bored with it after a while.</p>
<p>And so you have to set up different types of ecosystems.</p>
<p>You have your home life.</p>
<p>You have your love life.</p>
<p>You have children.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the enduring part of what you do.</p>
<p>And then on the other side, you&rsquo;ve got the unpredictable</p>
<p>nature of this type of work.</p>
<p>What I say to people at my firm who are younger, usually,</p>
<p>well, everybody&rsquo;s younger, but people</p>
<p>who are of an age where they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>having their first child, or maybe they have two children,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important to make sure they go away</p>
<p>with their spouse at least once every two months to just</p>
<p>some lovely place where there are no children, no issues,</p>
<p>sometimes once a month if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of energetic and clever.</p>
<p>And that</p>
<p>Escape the craziness of it all.</p>
<p>Yeah, and reaffirm your values as a couple.</p>
<p>And you have to have fun.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have fun with the person you&rsquo;re with,</p>
<p>and all you&rsquo;re doing is dealing with issues,</p>
<p>then that gets pretty old.</p>
<p>And so you have to protect the fun element of your life</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>And the way to do that isn&rsquo;t by hanging around the house</p>
<p>and dealing with sort of more problems.</p>
<p>You have to get away and reinforce and reinvigorate</p>
<p>your relationship.</p>
<p>And whenever I tell one of our younger people about that,</p>
<p>they sort of look at me, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the scales are falling off of their eyes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying, jeez, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so enmeshed in all these things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something, as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you also have to do.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t let relationships slip</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re half overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s no better place to end it.</p>
<p>Steve, thank you so much.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Stephen Schwarzman&rsquo;s book, What It Takes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as hard to start and run a small business</p>
<p>as it is to start a big one.</p>
<p>You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically</p>
<p>as you bludgeon it into existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to raise the money and to find the right people.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to dedicate your life to a business,</p>
<p>which is the only way it will ever work,</p>
<p>you should choose one with the potential to be huge.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
