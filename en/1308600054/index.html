where we discuss science
and science-based tools for everyday life.
I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,
and I&amp;rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

Today, we&amp;rsquo;re talking all about habits.
In particular, we&amp;rsquo;re going to discuss the biology
of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits.

    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking all about habits.</p>
<p>In particular, we&rsquo;re going to discuss the biology</p>
<p>of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits.</p>
<p>I think we can all appreciate the value of having habits.</p>
<p>Habits organize our behavior</p>
<p>into more or less reflexive actions,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have to think too much</p>
<p>about performing the various behaviors that,</p>
<p>for instance, allow us to brush our teeth</p>
<p>or which side of bed we roll out of in the morning.</p>
<p>And then of course, habits can be more elaborate too.</p>
<p>We can be in the habit of exercising</p>
<p>at a particular time of day.</p>
<p>We can be in the habit of eating certain foods.</p>
<p>We can be in the habit of saying</p>
<p>or not saying certain things.</p>
<p>But of course, there are many habits</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t serve us well,</p>
<p>or that perhaps even undermine our immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health goals and psychological goals,</p>
<p>and even some habits that can really undermine</p>
<p>our overall life goals.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about making,</p>
<p>meaning forming, and breaking,</p>
<p>meaning stopping various habits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information out there about habits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find this in the popular sphere.</p>
<p>There are books, there are articles,</p>
<p>there are workshops, and so forth.</p>
<p>However, lesser known is that there&rsquo;s a whole neuroscience</p>
<p>of habit formation and habit breaking,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole field of psychology devoted</p>
<p>to understanding habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>And within those scientific literatures,</p>
<p>I think there are some real gems that,</p>
<p>at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t paid too much attention to in the popular sphere.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology</p>
<p>of habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to spell out two specific types</p>
<p>of habit formation and habit breaking programs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to boil these down to some very explicit steps</p>
<p>that anyone can use.</p>
<p>My reasoning for doing that is,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Many people are thinking about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking about leaving some things behind</p>
<p>from 2021 and previous,</p>
<p>and acquiring some new behaviors,</p>
<p>taking on some new challenges,</p>
<p>and trying to bring new things to their lives.</p>
<p>But regardless of when you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>the programs that I&rsquo;ll outline are grounded</p>
<p>in the neuroscience and biology of habit formation,</p>
<p>and they map very well to what the psychologists</p>
<p>have described in terms of habit formation and breaking.</p>
<p>So today, you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to come away with some practical tools,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certain that regardless of your present state</p>
<p>or goals, there&rsquo;ll be something of value to you.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about habits.</p>
<p>And anytime we&rsquo;re talking about habits,</p>
<p>that means our nervous system learns something.</p>
<p>Now, many people think that habits are just like reflexes,</p>
<p>but pure reflexes are things like the eye blink reflex.</p>
<p>You know, something comes toward your eye</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want it to get in your eye, you&rsquo;ll blink.</p>
<p>Or if you happen to step on a sharp object</p>
<p>or get too close to something that&rsquo;s too hot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll reflexively move away.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t habits.</p>
<p>Those are what we call hardwired reflexes.</p>
<p>Habits are things that our nervous system learned,</p>
<p>but not always consciously.</p>
<p>Sometimes we develop habits that we&rsquo;re not even aware of</p>
<p>until they become a problem,</p>
<p>or maybe they serve us well, who knows?</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is that habits</p>
<p>are a big part of who we are.</p>
<p>What we do habitually makes up much of what we do entirely.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s estimated that up to 70%</p>
<p>of our waking behavior is made up of habitual behavior.</p>
<p>So you can imagine that there&rsquo;s a lot of biology,</p>
<p>meaning cells and hormones and neural pathways, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are going to support the development of those habits.</p>
<p>So if habits are largely learned consciously</p>
<p>or unconsciously, we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>what is learning?</p>
<p>Well, learning is neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is simply the process</p>
<p>by which our nervous system changes</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>We have to ask what changes?</p>
<p>Well, what changes are the connections between neurons?</p>
<p>Neurons are just nerve cells.</p>
<p>They communicate with one another by electricity</p>
<p>and by sending chemical signals to one another</p>
<p>that inspire the next neuron and the next neuron</p>
<p>to either be electrically active or not.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity is about forming new neural circuits,</p>
<p>new pathways by which certain habits are likely to occur</p>
<p>and other ones are less likely to occur.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got habits.</p>
<p>We have that habits are learned.</p>
<p>We have that learning involves neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and that neuroplasticity involves changes</p>
<p>in the connections between neurons, nerve cells.</p>
<p>Okay, so that describes habits</p>
<p>through the lens of neuroscience and biology.</p>
<p>But as many of you are well aware,</p>
<p>there are popular books about habits</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole psychological literature about habits.</p>
<p>And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects</p>
<p>of habits that I think are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits</p>
<p>versus identity-based habits.</p>
<p>Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits</p>
<p>that are designed to bring you a specific outcome</p>
<p>as you do them.</p>
<p>So each and every time you do them.</p>
<p>So for instance, it might be that you want to develop</p>
<p>a habit of getting 60 minutes of zone two cardio each day</p>
<p>or perhaps three, four times a week</p>
<p>as we head into the new year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on the podcast</p>
<p>about the fact that the scientific literature</p>
<p>and the health literature really points</p>
<p>to the incredibly positive effects</p>
<p>of getting 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week minimum</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called zone two cardio.</p>
<p>Zone two cardio is basically any cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>that gets you moving and your heart pumping and breathing,</p>
<p>but not so hard that you can&rsquo;t hold a conversation.</p>
<p>As it kind of puts you at the threshold</p>
<p>of being just able to have a conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit strained.</p>
<p>But if you were to exercise a little bit harder,</p>
<p>you know, run a little bit faster, et cetera,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to talk while you did it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of literature that points to that</p>
<p>as a healthy practice.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;re somebody that wants to get more</p>
<p>of zone two cardio, for instance.</p>
<p>That would be an immediate goal-based habit.</p>
<p>If your goal is to get that cardio maybe four times a week,</p>
<p>every time you do it, you could check off a little box</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d say, okay, I did it, you met the goal.</p>
<p>That is different than so-called identity-based habits</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a larger overarching theme to the habit</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to become, quote unquote, a fit person,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somebody who wants to be an athlete</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you start to attach some sort of larger picture</p>
<p>about yourself or what it means for you to do that habit,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s both the immediate goal, right?</p>
<p>Complete the exercise, complete the session</p>
<p>or whatever it is, check off that box,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re linking it to some sort of larger goal.</p>
<p>Now, why am I making this distinction?</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the one to first make this distinction.</p>
<p>Others have made the distinction between identity</p>
<p>versus immediate goal-based habit formation.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m making the distinction</p>
<p>is that pretty soon in our discussion today,</p>
<p>we are going to talk about dopamine,</p>
<p>a molecule that&rsquo;s associated with motivation and reward</p>
<p>that we make in our brain</p>
<p>and how different schedules of dopamine release</p>
<p>predict whether or not we will stick to a habit or not.</p>
<p>And in particular, whether or not we will be able to form</p>
<p>that habit quickly or not.</p>
<p>Now, this is absolutely critical to understand</p>
<p>for the following reason.</p>
<p>Another thing that you&rsquo;ll hear out there in the literature</p>
<p>is that it takes 21 days to form a habit.</p>
<p>Some people say 18, some people say 21,</p>
<p>some people say 30 days, some people say 60 days.</p>
<p>So which one is it?</p>
<p>Does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form</p>
<p>or does it depend on the person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to form the habit?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there&rsquo;s excellent</p>
<p>peer-reviewed data on this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study published in 2010,</p>
<p>first author Lally, L-A-L-L-Y.</p>
<p>This study found that for the same habit to be formed,</p>
<p>it can take anywhere from 18 days to as many as 254 days</p>
<p>for different individuals to form that habit.</p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is that I always get asked,</p>
<p>is it true that it takes 21 days to form a habit?</p>
<p>Is it true that your nervous system changes in six days</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing something repeatedly?</p>
<p>And the answer is, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly variable.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t tell you actually was what specific habit</p>
<p>they were looking at in that Lally study.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that the specific behavior</p>
<p>was a health-related behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty relevant to our discussion here</p>
<p>on the podcast, which was taking walks after dinner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a really nice literature</p>
<p>showing that walks after a meal</p>
<p>can speed glucose clearance from the bloodstream,</p>
<p>can be beneficial for not just weight loss,</p>
<p>but cardiovascular health, et cetera.</p>
<p>So a walk after dinner seems pretty straightforward, right?</p>
<p>Well, in order to form that habit,</p>
<p>it took some people 18 days and other people 254 days.</p>
<p>How did they know when they formed the habit?</p>
<p>Well, they were doing it about 85% of the time.</p>
<p>And they also reported not having to spend</p>
<p>that much mental effort in order to get into the mode</p>
<p>of taking a walk after dinner.</p>
<p>So for those of you listening,</p>
<p>some of you might be thinking,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that it would take some people 254 days</p>
<p>to get into that habit.</p>
<p>But as I said, people are highly variable.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t form one habit easily,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t form other habits easily.</p>
<p>The mystery of why certain people can form certain habits</p>
<p>more easily than others probably has something to do</p>
<p>with how well people manage what&rsquo;s called limbic friction.</p>
<p>Now, limbic friction is not a term</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>in the formal neurobiological literature</p>
<p>or even psychological literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frankly a term that I coined to encompass</p>
<p>a number of different pieces of the psychology</p>
<p>and neuroscience literature.</p>
<p>Limbic friction is a shorthand way</p>
<p>that I use to describe the strain that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>in order to overcome one of two states within your body.</p>
<p>One state is one of anxiousness</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really anxious</p>
<p>and therefore you can&rsquo;t calm down, you can&rsquo;t relax,</p>
<p>and therefore you can&rsquo;t engage in some particular activity</p>
<p>or thought pattern that you would like.</p>
<p>The other state is one in which you&rsquo;re feeling too tired</p>
<p>or lazy or not motivated.</p>
<p>Both of those states, feeling too alert and too calm,</p>
<p>if you will, relate to the function</p>
<p>of the so-called autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>a set of neurons and hormones and chemicals</p>
<p>in your brain and body that act as sort of a seesaw.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either alert or calm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either asleep or stressed.</p>
<p>Those two states are not compatible with one another.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of wired and tired,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really once you&rsquo;ve been very stressed</p>
<p>for a long time to the point where you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>What does the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>have to do with any of this?</p>
<p>Well, limbic friction is a phrase that can be used</p>
<p>to describe how much effort,</p>
<p>how much activation energy you need</p>
<p>in order to engage in a particular behavior.</p>
<p>So using this Lally study as an example,</p>
<p>some people would eat dinner and then say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m trying to develop the habit</p>
<p>of taking a walk after dinner, so let&rsquo;s get up and go.</p>
<p>Other people will feel like I just don&rsquo;t want to do it today.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to feel too much limbic friction,</p>
<p>and that limbic friction could arrive, again,</p>
<p>from one of two sources.</p>
<p>It could be because they are too tired to do it,</p>
<p>or it could be because they&rsquo;re too anxious</p>
<p>and distracted in order to do it.</p>
<p>So this is a key distinction.</p>
<p>A lot of habit formation has to do</p>
<p>with being in the right state of mind</p>
<p>and being able to control your state of body and mind.</p>
<p>So as we march forward, what you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>is that this phrase or this term limbic friction</p>
<p>is going to be a useful metric</p>
<p>or way for you to touch in with yourself</p>
<p>and address whether or not you are likely to be able</p>
<p>to form a certain habit easily,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s going to be very challenging.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to teach you a way to measure</p>
<p>your degree of limbic friction,</p>
<p>that is how much activation energy it will take</p>
<p>in order for you to execute a new habit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to measure</p>
<p>your limbic friction and activation energy</p>
<p>for how likely it is that you&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to break a habit that you don&rsquo;t want to have.</p>
<p>The other key concept for us to address</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really mainly found in the books</p>
<p>and articles out there about habits</p>
<p>is this notion of what I call linchpin habits.</p>
<p>Lynchpin habits are certain habits</p>
<p>that make a lot of other habits easier to execute.</p>
<p>Now, the sorts of lynchpin habits that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>are always going to be things that you enjoy doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you an example from my life.</p>
<p>I happen to like exercise, not all forms of exercise,</p>
<p>but I happen to like resistance training</p>
<p>and I happen to like running.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m personally in the habit</p>
<p>of getting cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>three or four times per week,</p>
<p>maybe 30 to 60 minutes per session.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in the habit of doing resistance training</p>
<p>three or four times per week,</p>
<p>typically also for about 45 to 60 minutes per session.</p>
<p>Now I enjoy those.</p>
<p>And for reasons that I&rsquo;ll get into a little bit later,</p>
<p>I place those activities typically early in the day</p>
<p>because of the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and the various types of hormones, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are associated with performing those activities.</p>
<p>But I really place those activities</p>
<p>under the umbrella of what I call lynchpin habits.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because those particular habits are easy to execute</p>
<p>because I enjoy them,</p>
<p>but they also make a lot of other habits</p>
<p>easier to execute.</p>
<p>Things like being alert for work,</p>
<p>things like making sure that I get good sleep</p>
<p>the night before,</p>
<p>things like hydration,</p>
<p>things like making sure that I eat the foods</p>
<p>that are better for me</p>
<p>than maybe some of the other foods</p>
<p>that I would more reflexively reach to</p>
<p>if I weren&rsquo;t doing that training.</p>
<p>So certain habits act as lynchpins,</p>
<p>meaning that they shift a lot of other things.</p>
<p>They can control and bias the likelihood that,</p>
<p>in this case, you or me,</p>
<p>will perform other habits that are harder to access,</p>
<p>that we have less of an affinity for.</p>
<p>So again, there&rsquo;s three concepts</p>
<p>that we need to include here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got identity-based versus goal-based habits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the concept that different habits</p>
<p>take different periods of time to adopt</p>
<p>depending on the person and the habit,</p>
<p>and that there are these, what I call lynchpin habits,</p>
<p>certain habits that make other habits easier to execute.</p>
<p>And those lynchpin habits always, always, always</p>
<p>are things that we enjoy doing.</p>
<p>So our goal throughout this episode</p>
<p>is for you to identify which habits</p>
<p>are easy for you to perform,</p>
<p>which ones are hard for you to perform,</p>
<p>and which habits you want to break.</p>
<p>If you want to grab a pen and paper, you can do that,</p>
<p>or if you want to dictate some of that into your phone,</p>
<p>you can, but right now, actually,</p>
<p>if you just want to think about these concepts,</p>
<p>you can always go back later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure to spell out a very specific way</p>
<p>that you can chart out a map towards forming</p>
<p>particular habits and breaking particular habits later on.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like us to do at this point</p>
<p>is to take that concept of limbic friction,</p>
<p>and for you to ask yourself,</p>
<p>what habits you perform on a daily basis?</p>
<p>And these could be things as basic</p>
<p>as brushing your teeth before breakfast,</p>
<p>or brushing your teeth after breakfast.</p>
<p>It could be, for instance, that you get exercise,</p>
<p>or you get it at a particular time of day,</p>
<p>or even that you take a particular route to work, right?</p>
<p>We are very habitual,</p>
<p>and we tend to do things more or less</p>
<p>over and over in the same way,</p>
<p>unless we intervene in ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that we are wired.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to shift to thinking</p>
<p>about a particular aspect of habits,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s habit strength.</p>
<p>Now, you all have different habits.</p>
<p>You probably brush your teeth at a particular time of day.</p>
<p>You probably exercise at particular times of week.</p>
<p>You probably go to the refrigerator in a very habitual way.</p>
<p>We are incredibly habitual organisms.</p>
<p>Unless we intervene in our habits,</p>
<p>they tend to carry out the same way</p>
<p>that they always have once they&rsquo;ve formed.</p>
<p>So you can do this exercise now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to write this down if you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but you certainly are welcome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to evaluate what&rsquo;s called habit strength.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a concept that I created.</p>
<p>Habit strength is something that you will find</p>
<p>in the psychological literature.</p>
<p>Habit strength is measured by two main criteria.</p>
<p>The first is how context dependent a given habit is.</p>
<p>So context dependence is,</p>
<p>if you go from one environment to the next,</p>
<p>do you tend to do the same thing in the same way</p>
<p>at the same time of day?</p>
<p>So for instance, brushing your teeth</p>
<p>first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>maybe some of you do that before breakfast.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you do that later.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you like me don&rsquo;t even eat breakfast.</p>
<p>But when I travel, I tend to brush my teeth</p>
<p>at more or less the same time of day</p>
<p>relative to when I wake up as I do when I&rsquo;m at home.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s context independent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very strong habit, right?</p>
<p>There are certain behaviors like perhaps what you eat</p>
<p>or perhaps how you dress that are context independent</p>
<p>that you might perform one way in one context</p>
<p>and another way in another context.</p>
<p>The other aspect of habit strength</p>
<p>is how much limbic friction is required</p>
<p>to perform that habit on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This is extremely important</p>
<p>because if you were in the process of building habits</p>
<p>and consolidating those habits,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably going to take more limbic friction</p>
<p>to execute those habits.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you set out to get,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 45 minutes of zone two cardio exercise every day,</p>
<p>five or maybe even seven days a week.</p>
<p>Well, if at first you&rsquo;re highly motivated,</p>
<p>limbic friction might be pretty low.</p>
<p>Limbic friction is how much top down,</p>
<p>meaning from your forebrain to your limbic system,</p>
<p>the part of your brain that generates autonomic responses,</p>
<p>how much limbic friction,</p>
<p>meaning conscious override of your state</p>
<p>is required in order to engage in that particular behavior.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re feeling particularly tired</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to get up out of bed</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to go out and do your zone two cardio,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a high degree of limbic friction.</p>
<p>Some people think of it as motivation,</p>
<p>but motivation is a bit of a vague concept</p>
<p>whereas limbic friction involves specific neural circuits.</p>
<p>And you can think of it in a more or less quantitative way.</p>
<p>You can think of that your body is very tired,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to take more limbic friction</p>
<p>in order to get into action, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to overcome more limbic friction,</p>
<p>excuse me.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re very, very alert,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less limbic friction</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re moving towards something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s action oriented.</p>
<p>However, the inverse is also true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you are trying to get into the habit</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in the early stages of forming a habit</p>
<p>to meditate regularly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty quiescent or calming activity.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who comes home from work</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very anxious and you have a lot of work to do</p>
<p>and you have to deal with a bunch of things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of limbic friction to overcome</p>
<p>in order to get into that calm state.</p>
<p>So these two aspects, context dependence,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re likely to do the thing</p>
<p>regardless of where you are, right?</p>
<p>On travel, at home, on vacation, with people around,</p>
<p>not people around, et cetera.</p>
<p>And how much limbic friction is required</p>
<p>to execute that habit will tell you whether or not</p>
<p>that habit is deeply or just shallowly embedded</p>
<p>within your nervous system.</p>
<p>The goal of any habit that we want to form</p>
<p>is to get into what&rsquo;s called automaticity.</p>
<p>Automaticity is fancy language</p>
<p>for the neural circuits can perform it automatically.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the ultimate place to be, right?</p>
<p>If you have all these goals and things that you want</p>
<p>to be doing on a regular basis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d love for them to be habitual</p>
<p>because it takes less mental and physical effort,</p>
<p>less limbic friction in order to execute those.</p>
<p>And so much of what&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>again, in the popular psychology literature,</p>
<p>in books that you&rsquo;ll find on the bookstore shelf</p>
<p>and on Amazon and in the airports</p>
<p>are about how to get from that mode</p>
<p>of high degree of limbic friction to automaticity.</p>
<p>And they offer a number of different ways.</p>
<p>I think many of which are useful,</p>
<p>trying to get you to organize different types of habits</p>
<p>into different bins like value-based and goal-based</p>
<p>and trying to persuade you that structuring habits</p>
<p>at the particular times of day</p>
<p>or in a particular way are going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>And indeed, I think they have helped a lot of people.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like to do is to take the scientific literature</p>
<p>of how the nervous system learns</p>
<p>and engages in neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and apply that to habit formation, habit maintenance,</p>
<p>and if so desired, how to break particular habits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give you a particular tool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gleaned from the research psychology literature.</p>
<p>I should mention that I learned about this</p>
<p>from an excellent review article that&rsquo;s available online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Psychology of Habit.</p>
<p>The authors are Wendy Wood and Dennis Runger.</p>
<p>This is published in Annual Review of Psychology.</p>
<p>The Annual Reviews series is a very high quality series.</p>
<p>There are annual reviews of neuroscience,</p>
<p>annual reviews of psychology,</p>
<p>annual reviews of nutrition science, et cetera.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in exploring review articles</p>
<p>that are grounded in hundreds</p>
<p>of quality peer-reviewed studies,</p>
<p>the Annual Review series is really terrific,</p>
<p>certainly among the best, if not the best.</p>
<p>And they also tend to be quite long and quite comprehensive.</p>
<p>So this review, Psychology of Habit</p>
<p>by Wood and Runger is excellent.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m more or less paraphrasing from them.</p>
<p>So I want to be clear that these are their words, not mine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about the various ways</p>
<p>that habits form in the nervous system.</p>
<p>And they mention with each repetition of a habit,</p>
<p>small changes occur in the cognitive</p>
<p>and neural mechanisms associated with procedural memory.</p>
<p>So I just want to talk for a second</p>
<p>about what procedural memory is.</p>
<p>In the neuroscience of memory,</p>
<p>we distinguish between what&rsquo;s called episodic memory</p>
<p>and procedural memory.</p>
<p>Episodic memory is a recall</p>
<p>of a particular set of events that happened,</p>
<p>whereas procedural memory is holding in mind</p>
<p>the specific sequence of things that need to happen</p>
<p>in order for a particular outcome to occur.</p>
<p>So think of it like a recipe or a protocol,</p>
<p>or if for sake of exercise, it&rsquo;s like sets and reps</p>
<p>or a particular course that you&rsquo;re going to run or cycle</p>
<p>or the number of laps you&rsquo;re going to swim</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;re going to perform it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that for anyone trying to adopt new habits,</p>
<p>getting into the mindset of procedural memory</p>
<p>is very useful for overcoming that barrier</p>
<p>that we call limbic friction.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>A simple visualization exercise,</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be done eyes closed.</p>
<p>Oftentimes we hear visualization exercise.</p>
<p>You think about sitting in a lotus position, eyes closed,</p>
<p>and trying really hard to visualize something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything like that.</p>
<p>It can simply be, if you are deciding to adopt a new habit,</p>
<p>to just think about the very specific sequence of steps</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to execute that habit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll use a trivial example,</p>
<p>but this could be applied to anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I want to get into the habit of making myself</p>
<p>or someone else in my household</p>
<p>a cup of espresso every morning.</p>
<p>I would actually think through each of those steps,</p>
<p>walk into the kitchen, turn on the espresso machine,</p>
<p>draw the espresso, walking through each of those steps</p>
<p>from start to finish.</p>
<p>It turns out just that simple mental exercise done once</p>
<p>can shift people toward a much higher likelihood</p>
<p>of performing that habit regularly, not just the first time,</p>
<p>but as they continue out into the days</p>
<p>and weeks that follow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s remarkable to me.</p>
<p>And the literature is really robust.</p>
<p>Just one mental exercise of thinking through</p>
<p>what are the sequence of steps required</p>
<p>in order to perform this habit from start to finish</p>
<p>can shift the likelihood of being able to perform that habit</p>
<p>from unlikely or moderately likely to very likely over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it pulls from this process</p>
<p>that involves our hippocampus and our neocortex</p>
<p>and other areas of our brain and nervous system</p>
<p>that engage in procedural memory.</p>
<p>It shifts the brain towards a mindset, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a neural circuit set, it would be more accurate</p>
<p>but a mindset slash neural circuit set</p>
<p>of doing things in a particular sequence,</p>
<p>which allows that limbic friction to come down</p>
<p>and increases the likelihood</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to perform that thing.</p>
<p>Simple tool, but very powerful tool</p>
<p>according to the psychology literature.</p>
<p>And actually the cellular and molecular mechanisms</p>
<p>that underlie that sort of procedural memory</p>
<p>stepping through phenomenon are known.</p>
<p>In this article, I mentioned this beautiful review.</p>
<p>They talk about so-called Hebbian learning.</p>
<p>Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada</p>
<p>and birthed this field that has now lasted, gosh,</p>
<p>more than 50 years and is still very strong</p>
<p>in neuroscience and psychology of Hebbian learning.</p>
<p>Hebbian learning is when particular neurons are co-active,</p>
<p>meaning when they fire together,</p>
<p>they tend to strengthen their connections with one another.</p>
<p>And it has a number of different underlying cellular</p>
<p>and molecular features</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to go into in detail.</p>
<p>But for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>I know some of you are hungry</p>
<p>for a little bit more neuroscience.</p>
<p>This involves things like NMDA receptors,</p>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.</p>
<p>NMDA receptors are really important,</p>
<p>I think for everyone to understand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just tell you a little bit about them.</p>
<p>These are receptors that are on the neuron surface.</p>
<p>And normally they don&rsquo;t contribute much</p>
<p>to the activity of those neurons.</p>
<p>Those neurons are perfectly capable of doing their thing</p>
<p>without activation of this NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>But when a neuron gets a very strong input,</p>
<p>a strong stimulus,</p>
<p>that NMDA receptor triggers a number of mechanisms</p>
<p>that recruit to the surface of the neuron</p>
<p>more other receptors.</p>
<p>In other words, it makes that neuron more responsive</p>
<p>to input in the future,</p>
<p>such that it doesn&rsquo;t require so much input.</p>
<p>In other words, it takes a neuron</p>
<p>that is very unlikely to fire</p>
<p>and makes it more likely to fire.</p>
<p>So this procedural stepping through</p>
<p>of the steps of the recipe</p>
<p>or the series of action steps that are involved</p>
<p>in sitting down to study and writing for an hour</p>
<p>or generating exercise,</p>
<p>whatever it is the habit that you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing that exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if your nervous system</p>
<p>thinks you&rsquo;re actually performing the behavior.</p>
<p>Your nervous system isn&rsquo;t stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a lot smarter than that.</p>
<p>It knows the difference between a thought and an action.</p>
<p>But when you do that,</p>
<p>it sets in motion the same neurons</p>
<p>that are going to be required</p>
<p>for the execution of that habit.</p>
<p>And so when you actually show up to perform that habit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if the dominoes fall more easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lower threshold, as we say,</p>
<p>in order to get the habit to perform.</p>
<p>So Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors,</p>
<p>all that nuts and bolts stuff</p>
<p>are really the guts of the mechanisms of how this works.</p>
<p>But for those of you that just want to be more habitual</p>
<p>about certain things,</p>
<p>be able to perform certain things more reflexively</p>
<p>that you would like in your life,</p>
<p>simply take the time, do it once, maybe twice,</p>
<p>and just sit down, close your eyes if you like,</p>
<p>and just step through the procedure</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s going to take in order to perform that habit.</p>
<p>The psychology literature, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>and also the neuroscience literature</p>
<p>strongly supports the fact</p>
<p>that it is going to make it far easier</p>
<p>for you to adopt and maintain that habit.</p>
<p>And if you are somebody who used to perform a habit</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t understand why you dropped it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re frustrated with yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>how you can get back into that habit,</p>
<p>well, by all means, lean right back into that habit.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re having trouble doing that,</p>
<p>also just use the procedural memory exercise</p>
<p>in order to shift your nervous system</p>
<p>toward a higher likelihood</p>
<p>that you will return to that habit,</p>
<p>just the same way I described</p>
<p>for trying to initiate a new habit.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to discuss a second</p>
<p>and what I think is perhaps the most powerful tool</p>
<p>for being able to acquire and stick to new habits.</p>
<p>This tool is rooted in what we call neural circuits.</p>
<p>And I do think it is important to understand a little bit</p>
<p>about how those neural circuits work.</p>
<p>For those of you that are saying, just tell me what to do,</p>
<p>I have to say, as I always say,</p>
<p>understanding a little bit or a lot of underlying mechanism</p>
<p>will help solidify these concepts for you</p>
<p>and will help ensure that the tools that I offer</p>
<p>are going to make sense</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re going to make sense in different contexts</p>
<p>and for different types of habits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>So rather than just tell you what to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you how this particular tool works.</p>
<p>And then in doing that,</p>
<p>you should be able to apply it to any habit</p>
<p>under any conditions.</p>
<p>The tool that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is something called task bracketing.</p>
<p>And the neural circuits associated with task bracketing</p>
<p>are basically the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to learn any new type of habit</p>
<p>or break any habit that you&rsquo;d like to break.</p>
<p>We have in our brain a set of neural circuits</p>
<p>that fall under the umbrella term of the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>The basal ganglia are involved in action execution,</p>
<p>meaning doing certain things,</p>
<p>and action suppression, not doing certain things.</p>
<p>In the experimental realm,</p>
<p>these are referred to as go, meaning do,</p>
<p>or no go, don&rsquo;t do certain things.</p>
<p>And some of us fall more into the category</p>
<p>of we find it very easy to do certain things,</p>
<p>but harder to not do other things.</p>
<p>Some people have a lot of no-go type circuits</p>
<p>that are very robust,</p>
<p>and they have a lot of behavioral constraint,</p>
<p>but they have a harder time getting into action.</p>
<p>And some people have a perfect balance of both,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never met one of those people.</p>
<p>So again, drawing from and more or less paraphrasing</p>
<p>from this beautiful review that I described earlier</p>
<p>in annual review of psychology, excuse me,</p>
<p>by Wood and Runger,</p>
<p>task bracketing involves a particular set of neural circuits</p>
<p>within the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to describe this here again,</p>
<p>paraphrasing a sensory motor loop.</p>
<p>Sensory means just input coming in about sight,</p>
<p>sounds, tastes, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then the motor systems,</p>
<p>the systems of the brain and body that generate action,</p>
<p>taking that information and generating action.</p>
<p>So it turns out that there&rsquo;s an area of our basal ganglia</p>
<p>called the dorsolateral striatum.</p>
<p>We can use the acronym DLS.</p>
<p>Again, dorsolateral striatum.</p>
<p>Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side,</p>
<p>so dorsolateral.</p>
<p>And striatum is a subdivision of the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important for the establishment of behaviors</p>
<p>that are associated with a habit,</p>
<p>but not necessarily the habit itself.</p>
<p>And beautiful studies in both animals and humans</p>
<p>that record the electrical activity</p>
<p>in the dorsolateral striatum,</p>
<p>find that the dorsolateral striatum is associated,</p>
<p>meaning it becomes active</p>
<p>at the beginning of a particular habit</p>
<p>and at the very end and after a particular habit.</p>
<p>Hence the phrase task bracketing, it brackets the habit.</p>
<p>Now, other sets of neurons are going to be active</p>
<p>during the actual execution of the habit.</p>
<p>But what the literature on the dorsolateral striatum</p>
<p>tells us is that we have particular circuits in our brain</p>
<p>that are devoted to framing the events</p>
<p>that happened just before and as we initiate a habit</p>
<p>and just after and as we terminate a habit.</p>
<p>In other words, it acts as a sort of marker</p>
<p>for the habit execution,</p>
<p>but not the execution of the habit per se.</p>
<p>This is very important because task bracketing</p>
<p>is what underlies whether or not a habit</p>
<p>will be context dependent or not,</p>
<p>whether or not it will be strong and likely to occur</p>
<p>even if we didn&rsquo;t get a good night&rsquo;s sleep the night before,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re feeling distracted,</p>
<p>even if we are not feeling like doing something emotionally,</p>
<p>or if we are completely overwhelmed by other events,</p>
<p>if the neural circuits for task bracketing</p>
<p>are deeply embedded in us,</p>
<p>meaning they are very robust around a particular habit,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s likely that we&rsquo;re going to go out</p>
<p>for that zone two cardio no matter what,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to brush our teeth no matter what.</p>
<p>In fact, brushing our teeth is a pretty good example</p>
<p>because for most people,</p>
<p>even if you got a terrible night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>even if everything in your life is going wrong,</p>
<p>chances are, unless you&rsquo;re very depressed,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to leave to work, or even if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to still carry out the behavior</p>
<p>of brushing your teeth in the morning.</p>
<p>I would hope so, actually.</p>
<p>But you are probably less likely</p>
<p>to perform particular habits</p>
<p>that are not what you deem as necessary.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, brushing your teeth,</p>
<p>exercise, eating particular foods,</p>
<p>maybe engaging socially in particular ways,</p>
<p>you are the one that places any kind of value assessment</p>
<p>on which ones are essential and which ones are negotiable.</p>
<p>So task bracketing sets a neural imprint,</p>
<p>a kind of a fingerprint in your brain</p>
<p>of this thing has to happen at this particular time of day,</p>
<p>so much so that it&rsquo;s reflexive.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way that you can build up task bracketing</p>
<p>so that regardless of what it is you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do that thing.</p>
<p>And when I say learn, meaning,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to acquire a habit</p>
<p>that for you is really challenging.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re going to write for an hour a day</p>
<p>on a book project that you&rsquo;ve been thinking about,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to work on mathematics,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to do any sort of thing</p>
<p>that for you there&rsquo;s a lot of limbic friction.</p>
<p>While it is important to think about the sequence of events</p>
<p>that would be required in order to engage in that behavior,</p>
<p>that procedural memory visualization exercise</p>
<p>we talked about before, that will help.</p>
<p>There is a way also that you can orient your nervous system</p>
<p>toward this task bracketing process</p>
<p>so that your nervous system is shifted</p>
<p>or oriented towards the execution of a given habit.</p>
<p>So this is sort of like warming up your body to exercise.</p>
<p>When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,</p>
<p>your body and your brain are primed to execute a habit.</p>
<p>And then you get to consciously insert</p>
<p>which habit you want to perform.</p>
<p>So in order to leverage the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>of task bracketing, in order to increase the likelihood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to perform a particular habit,</p>
<p>I have to break it to you that one thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably heard over and over</p>
<p>about habit formation is not true.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m referring to is this idea</p>
<p>that if you are very specific about exactly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to perform a particular habit,</p>
<p>that you are more likely to perform that habit.</p>
<p>And while that is true in the short-term,</p>
<p>it is not true in the long-term.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that our nervous system</p>
<p>tends to generate particular kinds of behaviors</p>
<p>based not on time, but on our state,</p>
<p>meaning what level of activation is taking place</p>
<p>in our brain and body, how much focus we happen to have,</p>
<p>how fatigued we are, how energized we are.</p>
<p>So while schedules are important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the specific time of day per se</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow you to get into a habit</p>
<p>and form that habit and consolidate that habit.</p>
<p>Rather, it&rsquo;s the state that your brain and body are in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to anchor yourself to.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to offer you a tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually an entire program</p>
<p>by which you can insert particular habits and activities</p>
<p>at particular phases of the day,</p>
<p>not times of day, but phases of the day,</p>
<p>because it turns out that particular phases of the day</p>
<p>are associated with particular biological underpinnings,</p>
<p>chemicals and neural circuits and so forth.</p>
<p>And in doing so, it will make it far more likely</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be able to regularly engage</p>
<p>in these habits and activities over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that will move you from somebody</p>
<p>who ordinarily would take 200 days to form a habit</p>
<p>to one of those 18 days to habit people</p>
<p>in that earlier study I mentioned, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I am certain that it will have a significant shift</p>
<p>on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily</p>
<p>and to consolidate those habits more quickly.</p>
<p>So the program I&rsquo;m about to describe,</p>
<p>I formulated for you based on the neuroscience literature</p>
<p>and the psychology literature of learning</p>
<p>and this concept of task bracketing.</p>
<p>It involves dividing the 24 hour days</p>
<p>into what I call three phases.</p>
<p>The first is phase one,</p>
<p>which is zero to eight hours after waking up,</p>
<p>approximately, okay?</p>
<p>You can put a plus or minus 30 minutes on this for yourself.</p>
<p>The second phase is the nine to 14,</p>
<p>maybe 15 hours after you wake up.</p>
<p>And the third phase is 16 to 24 hours after waking up.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve taken the 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve carved it up into three phases,</p>
<p>phase one, phase two, and phase three.</p>
<p>Now, everything I&rsquo;m describing,</p>
<p>or at least the way I&rsquo;m going to describe it</p>
<p>is based on what I would call a typical schedule,</p>
<p>diurnal schedule.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of nocturnal?</p>
<p>Well, we are diurnal.</p>
<p>Most of us are asleep at night and awake during the day.</p>
<p>I do realize that a number of people have shift work</p>
<p>or they have newborns or other reasons</p>
<p>why they have to be up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and sleeping during the day.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>please listen to the episode that we did</p>
<p>on jet lag and shift work,</p>
<p>because it has a lot of tools</p>
<p>specifically for that population.</p>
<p>But most people go to sleep somewhere around 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>plus or minus two hours,</p>
<p>and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>plus or minus two hours.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m going to use the to bed at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>and the wake up time of 7 a.m.</p>
<p>as the framework for this,</p>
<p>but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule.</p>
<p>Phase one, which again is zero to eight hours after waking,</p>
<p>has a particular neurochemical signature.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you do,</p>
<p>the neuromodulators norepinephrine,</p>
<p>as well as epinephrine,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s noradrenaline and adrenaline,</p>
<p>as well as the neuromodulator dopamine</p>
<p>tend to be elevated during that first</p>
<p>zero to eight hours after waking.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this</p>
<p>related to the fact that also cortisol</p>
<p>is higher in our brain and bloodstream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a healthy level of cortisol upon waking.</p>
<p>Body temperature is increased, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there are several things</p>
<p>that perhaps we should all be doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about many of these on the podcast before,</p>
<p>that in addition to those chemicals</p>
<p>further support an alert and focused state.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just list those off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done many podcasts on each of these.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to access those podcasts,</p>
<p>you can find them in the menu of podcasts</p>
<p>on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera.</p>
<p>They involve, for instance,</p>
<p>viewing sunlight or bright artificial light</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t access sunlight</p>
<p>within the first 30 minutes of waking,</p>
<p>physical exercise of some kind</p>
<p>in this first phase of the day,</p>
<p>zero to eight hours of the day,</p>
<p>ideally pretty early in that phase.</p>
<p>But if it has to be at the seven to eight hour</p>
<p>transition point, that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>Cold exposure in the form of cold showers or ice baths</p>
<p>or outside with minimal clothing,</p>
<p>appropriate yet minimal clothing.</p>
<p>Caffeine ingestion, fasting, for instance,</p>
<p>not ingesting calories also will lend itself</p>
<p>to increased norepinephrine, dopamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you are going to consume foods,</p>
<p>foods that are rich in things like tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is a precursor for dopamine,</p>
<p>you can look up which foods are high in tyrosine.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in supplementation and like to use those routes,</p>
<p>things like alpha-GPC or phenolethylamine</p>
<p>or L-tyrosine if that&rsquo;s in keeping</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re able to do.</p>
<p>Of course, consult your doctor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to rely on supplementation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this all about?</p>
<p>Well, the already elevated norepinephrine and dopamine,</p>
<p>the sunlight, exercise, cold exposure,</p>
<p>caffeine, tyrosine, et cetera,</p>
<p>all of those place the brain and body into a state</p>
<p>in which you are better able,</p>
<p>or I would say more easily able to engage in activities</p>
<p>that have a high degree of limbic friction</p>
<p>and where you need to override that limbic friction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard that the morning is kind of sacred,</p>
<p>conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been discussed in the pop psychology literature</p>
<p>and in the habit formation literature</p>
<p>merely from the perspective of get it out of the way</p>
<p>so you can feel good about having done it.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m referring to is quite different.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is a particular phase of day</p>
<p>that after rising, after waking up that is,</p>
<p>for zero to eight hours, right, in that first phase,</p>
<p>your whole system is action and focus oriented.</p>
<p>And we know that when you are action and focus oriented</p>
<p>and because of the neurochemicals</p>
<p>that are naturally released into your brain and body,</p>
<p>that you will be more likely to overcome</p>
<p>any limbic friction that stands in the way</p>
<p>of performing particular habits.</p>
<p>So as you list out or think about the various habits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to adopt in your life,</p>
<p>take the habits for which you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the highest degree of limbic friction.</p>
<p>They are the hardest for you to engage in.</p>
<p>They require the most activation energy</p>
<p>and put those in this zero to eight hours after waking.</p>
<p>This will greatly facilitate your performance</p>
<p>of those new habits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain of that.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>by doing them in this particular phase of the day,</p>
<p>not necessarily at the same time.</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to be very habitual</p>
<p>and you want to do the exercise or the sunlight viewing</p>
<p>always at the same time, or you want to do,</p>
<p>you want to drink your caffeine</p>
<p>always at the exact same time, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But by placing them in this broader window</p>
<p>of zero to eight hours after waking,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re creating task bracketing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making it such that your nervous system</p>
<p>will predict when you are going to lean in</p>
<p>against limbic friction</p>
<p>in order to perform particular types of habits.</p>
<p>And this is very different than saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always going to run,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m always going to study from 10 to 12 a.m.</p>
<p>every morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And if you can do that, terrific.</p>
<p>But the literature indicates that people who do that,</p>
<p>who are very rigid about when they do things</p>
<p>tend because of context dependence</p>
<p>to not necessarily stick to those habits over time.</p>
<p>Some people do, but many, many people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So think about the hardest habits to form</p>
<p>and the habits that you most want to form</p>
<p>that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain.</p>
<p>And I highly suggest placing those somewhere</p>
<p>within this phase one of zero to eight hours after waking.</p>
<p>Now, of course, some of the things I listed out,</p>
<p>sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure,</p>
<p>caffeine, fasting,</p>
<p>those might be the actual habits themselves.</p>
<p>But here I realize, or rather I want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that many people, including myself,</p>
<p>are doing some or all of these things already.</p>
<p>And many people, including myself,</p>
<p>are trying to adopt new habits</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t fall into the category</p>
<p>of just trying to set your overall state.</p>
<p>Again, norepinephrine, dopamine,</p>
<p>and all these neural systems will be greatly elevated</p>
<p>in this zero to eight hours after waking.</p>
<p>However, the other things I mentioned,</p>
<p>sunlight exposure, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine,</p>
<p>fasting, if that&rsquo;s for you,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re eating during that phase,</p>
<p>eating things that contain some</p>
<p>or elevated levels of tyrosine,</p>
<p>maybe supplementing LGPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera,</p>
<p>all of those things further facilitate the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and therefore the state of mind that&rsquo;s going to be ideal</p>
<p>for leaning into limbic friction</p>
<p>and overriding that limbic friction</p>
<p>so that you can regularly perform that habit.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is leveraging neural systems in order to help you</p>
<p>make it more likely that you&rsquo;re going to be able to engage</p>
<p>and maintain a particular habit.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m referring to as phase one of each day</p>
<p>is useful for acquiring certain habits,</p>
<p>but there are other phases of the day</p>
<p>and those turn out to be useful</p>
<p>for acquiring other types of habits.</p>
<p>Phase two, as I mentioned, is about, again,</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t specifics,</p>
<p>but about nine to 14 or 15 hours after waking.</p>
<p>During this phase of the day,</p>
<p>because of the circadian shifts in our biology,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s circulating in our brain and bloodstream</p>
<p>tends to start to come down</p>
<p>and levels of cortisol tend to start to come down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ideal circumstance.</p>
<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t really want elevated cortisol</p>
<p>late in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a signature of depression and anxiety</p>
<p>and a number of other unfortunate things.</p>
<p>So nine to 14 hours after waking,</p>
<p>dopamine and norepinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>are starting to taper down just naturally</p>
<p>and a different neuromodulator, serotonin,</p>
<p>is starting to rise.</p>
<p>Serotonin is definitely going to be highest</p>
<p>in this second half of the day</p>
<p>and tends to lend itself to a more relaxed state of being.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I do realize that some people</p>
<p>are less of morning people</p>
<p>and find that they really come alive</p>
<p>and awake in the afternoon,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t fall into that category.</p>
<p>Most people feel more alert early in the day,</p>
<p>even anxious early in the day.</p>
<p>And then as the afternoon progresses,</p>
<p>they tend to be a bit more sleepy, a bit more relaxed,</p>
<p>a bit more calm.</p>
<p>There are certain things that we all can and should do</p>
<p>during this phase two of each day</p>
<p>that lend themselves to a state of mind</p>
<p>and a state of body that is going to be beneficial</p>
<p>for the generation and consolidation</p>
<p>of certain types of habits.</p>
<p>What are those things?</p>
<p>First of all, as the day goes on,</p>
<p>you should try if you can to start tapering</p>
<p>the amount of light that you&rsquo;re viewing.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean putting yourself into dim light</p>
<p>at three o&rsquo;clock or four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly not the case.</p>
<p>Simply that you want to start tapering off</p>
<p>the amount of really bright light that you&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s sunlight.</p>
<p>Talked about this before on the podcast,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t heard,</p>
<p>viewing the sun as it&rsquo;s what we call low solar angle.</p>
<p>So as it&rsquo;s headed toward the horizon,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to watch the sunset,</p>
<p>although that can be nice,</p>
<p>but getting some sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>in the second half of the day can also be beneficial</p>
<p>for a number of brain systems and psychological systems.</p>
<p>So you can get some sunlight in your eyes.</p>
<p>You can certainly have artificial lights on,</p>
<p>but you want to start dimming those lights</p>
<p>and bringing them actually physically lower in the room</p>
<p>because the neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that view the upper visual field,</p>
<p>they actually trigger this alertness mechanism</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And in the second half of the day,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re humming around and doing work</p>
<p>at three and four or five or even 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>you are probably headed towards sleep a few hours later.</p>
<p>So things like limiting the total amount of light,</p>
<p>if you can.</p>
<p>Things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>Another thing that I&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t heard about this before,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term</p>
<p>for things like meditation, for yoga nidra,</p>
<p>a very powerful science-supported tool</p>
<p>for teaching you how to relax.</p>
<p>Things like self-hypnosis,</p>
<p>which might sound a little kooky to some of you,</p>
<p>but actually is a clinically-based tool</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s a lot of scientific literature.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great free resource called Revri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a app for both Apple and Android.</p>
<p>This is an app that was developed by colleagues of mine</p>
<p>and researchers at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>You can do these short 15-minute self-hypnosis scripts,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>that can teach you how to relax yourself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even ones for focus, for sleep, for chronic pain.</p>
<p>Again, all very strongly supported</p>
<p>by quality peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p>So things like Revri, meditation.</p>
<p>Things like heat and sauna, hot baths, hot showers.</p>
<p>Those are terrific things to do</p>
<p>in the second half of the day.</p>
<p>They tend to support this serotonergic</p>
<p>or high serotonin-like state</p>
<p>and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in supplementation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always ashwagandha, which reduces cortisol.</p>
<p>Again, peaks in cortisol late in the afternoon and evening</p>
<p>are associated with depression, anxiety, and so forth.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is a pretty potent cortisol-inhibiting tool.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t use it very often,</p>
<p>and I caution people about using it</p>
<p>for longer than two-week periods of time</p>
<p>without taking some breaks.</p>
<p>You can look up more about ashwagandha on examine.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of terrific literature</p>
<p>with links to studies there.</p>
<p>But basically this phase two of the day</p>
<p>is one in which you&rsquo;re alert, you are present,</p>
<p>you are working, you are engaging socially.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re cooking dinner,</p>
<p>probably paying attention to a number of things,</p>
<p>but you should really be trying</p>
<p>to taper off your stress level.</p>
<p>So how do you leverage phase two of the day</p>
<p>for habit formation?</p>
<p>Well, given what we know</p>
<p>about the neurochemistry of learning and memory,</p>
<p>given what we know about task formation</p>
<p>and its reliance on certain forms of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the second half of the day is a terrific time</p>
<p>to take on habits and things that you&rsquo;re already doing</p>
<p>that require very little override of limbic friction.</p>
<p>So these might be things that you could categorize</p>
<p>in common terms as kind of mellower activities.</p>
<p>It might be journaling.</p>
<p>It might be that you already are performing music,</p>
<p>or I should say practicing music regularly,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s a particular type of music</p>
<p>that is hard for you</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re working on a particular piece of music</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to learn a language,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a little bit challenging,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t require a ton of energy</p>
<p>in order to override that limbic friction.</p>
<p>The second half of the day</p>
<p>is a much better time to do that.</p>
<p>Less resistance, as we might say.</p>
<p>But of course, resistance has a neural substrate.</p>
<p>And the reason for doing those things</p>
<p>in the second part of the day,</p>
<p>the so-called phase two, as I&rsquo;ve called it,</p>
<p>part of the day,</p>
<p>is because your ability to override resistance</p>
<p>is really diminished in this second phase of the day.</p>
<p>Some of you might say,</p>
<p>well, wait, I like to exercise</p>
<p>in the second half of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually when I have the most energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I feel warmer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a morning exerciser.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is the acquisition of new behaviors</p>
<p>and placing those consistently</p>
<p>at the second half of the day</p>
<p>in order to engage this task bracketing mechanisms</p>
<p>that I talked about before.</p>
<p>One of the hallmark features</p>
<p>of those basal ganglia circuits for go and no-go</p>
<p>is that they are associated with certain neurochemicals,</p>
<p>dopamine and serotonin, acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and other neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And by placing particular habits</p>
<p>at particular phases of the day,</p>
<p>those neurochemical states start to be associated</p>
<p>with the leaning in and the process of beginning</p>
<p>and, as I mentioned, ending those particular habits.</p>
<p>And in doing so, they shift the whole nervous system</p>
<p>toward being able to predict</p>
<p>that certain things are going to happen</p>
<p>at particular times of day,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be leaning very hard</p>
<p>against limbic friction early in the day in phase one,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re going to be doing things</p>
<p>that require less conscious override</p>
<p>of limbic friction in phase two.</p>
<p>And in doing so, set up this task bracketing system</p>
<p>so that the individual habits that you&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>have a much greater probability</p>
<p>of being executed and consolidated,</p>
<p>meaning that pretty soon</p>
<p>they will just naturally become reflexive.</p>
<p>And as with phase one,</p>
<p>many of the things that I mentioned</p>
<p>that support this, what I&rsquo;m calling a serotonergic state</p>
<p>or a more relaxed state in phase two,</p>
<p>things like seeing some light in the afternoon,</p>
<p>but not a lot of bright light from artificial sources,</p>
<p>things like NSDR, things like heat and sauna,</p>
<p>hot baths, et cetera, ashwagandha.</p>
<p>Again, all of those things themselves</p>
<p>could be habits that you&rsquo;re trying to adopt, right?</p>
<p>In that case, do those if you&rsquo;d like to explore them.</p>
<p>They are quite beneficial for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>not just related to execution of particular habits</p>
<p>in phase two of the day,</p>
<p>but also for improving quality of sleep</p>
<p>and consolidating any learning</p>
<p>that you might&rsquo;ve triggered early in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about that before,</p>
<p>but just briefly as a relevant aside,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity involves triggering the neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>setting it in motion,</p>
<p>but the actual rewiring of the brain</p>
<p>and the reconfiguration of neurons</p>
<p>that will allow that learning to be reflexive,</p>
<p>that actually occurs during states of deep rest,</p>
<p>like NSDR and like deep sleep.</p>
<p>And I should just mention for those of you</p>
<p>that can only exercise or prefer to exercise</p>
<p>in phase two of the day, right?</p>
<p>Nine to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>However, because of the importance of sleep</p>
<p>and in particular deep sleep throughout the night</p>
<p>for not just neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but recovery of muscle and other tissues</p>
<p>that are taxed during physical exercise,</p>
<p>if you do train in phase two,</p>
<p>I highly recommend, highly recommend</p>
<p>that you start doing some sort of NSDR type activity</p>
<p>after you train within an hour or two,</p>
<p>because that will allow you to taper down and relax</p>
<p>so that you can get into the next phase</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about, which is phase three.</p>
<p>Phase three of the 24 hour schedule</p>
<p>runs from about 16 to 24 hours after waking.</p>
<p>During that period of time,</p>
<p>there are a few things that are going to support</p>
<p>being in a state of mind, state of body</p>
<p>that are going to allow neuroplasticity to occur,</p>
<p>that are going to allow the rewiring that you&rsquo;ve triggered</p>
<p>during the waking part of the day to actually take place.</p>
<p>Those things are very low to no light,</p>
<p>meaning keeping your environment very dark</p>
<p>or very, very dim.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to sleep in a room</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s complete blackness.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a little bit overkill,</p>
<p>but for most people keeping the room dark</p>
<p>and keeping the room temperature low</p>
<p>is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep.</p>
<p>The body has to drop by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep.</p>
<p>So low light, low temperature environment,</p>
<p>you can always pile on blankets, of course,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to be cold at night,</p>
<p>you want to be warm enough,</p>
<p>but you want your environment to be cold.</p>
<p>Typically people aren&rsquo;t eating in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Although one thing that can be useful</p>
<p>is to make sure that you&rsquo;re at least well-fed enough</p>
<p>when you head into this third phase of every 24-hour day</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not awake because you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people recommend putting a gap</p>
<p>between your final bite of food</p>
<p>and when you go to sleep at night.</p>
<p>Some people will say that gap should be four hours.</p>
<p>Other people say two hours.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re me, I generally have something, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>within two hours or 90 minutes of going to sleep,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a big meal, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>And I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that.</p>
<p>You have to experiment for yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about supplements that can support sleep</p>
<p>in previous episodes of the podcast,</p>
<p>things like magnesium threonate or magnesium bisglycinate,</p>
<p>things like theanine, apigenin.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to read more about those,</p>
<p>we actually have a newsletter</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just quickly refer you to.</p>
<p>This is the Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter.</p>
<p>You can sign up for it by going to hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to find.</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t sign up,</p>
<p>you can go to the toolkit for sleep that&rsquo;s listed there.</p>
<p>And that toolkit is not just supplements.</p>
<p>That toolkit is a number of different things,</p>
<p>both behavioral and supplement-based</p>
<p>and nutrition-based, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can allow you to get into sleep</p>
<p>and to stay asleep more readily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally zero cost.</p>
<p>You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>So things like low light, low temperature,</p>
<p>the supplements I mentioned,</p>
<p>adjusting your eating schedule appropriately,</p>
<p>obviously not drinking caffeine in the middle of the night</p>
<p>or too close to bed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be critical.</p>
<p>In fact, ideally you wouldn&rsquo;t ingest any caffeine</p>
<p>in phase two of the day</p>
<p>so that you could get into this deeper state of rest</p>
<p>in which habit formation and neuroplasticity can occur.</p>
<p>What if you wake up, right?</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;ve cast phase three</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re supposed to be in this deep slumber.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to wake up at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to be in low light</p>
<p>and your brain is rewiring</p>
<p>and those habits are getting consolidated, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re like me,</p>
<p>you probably get up once in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Maybe you go use the restroom.</p>
<p>Perfectly normal, perfectly normal.</p>
<p>But a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep.</p>
<p>Very important if you get up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use a minimum of light</p>
<p>in order to navigate your surroundings,</p>
<p>just as much as you need in order to safely do so</p>
<p>because light inhibits the hormone melatonin,</p>
<p>can make it very hard to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>If you inhibit melatonin,</p>
<p>the effects of light inhibiting melatonin</p>
<p>are actually very potent, happens very, very quickly.</p>
<p>So try and keep the lights low.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble falling back asleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you might also want to use</p>
<p>something like the Reverie app.</p>
<p>They have a sleep script there</p>
<p>that can hopefully help you get back to sleep</p>
<p>or something like NSDR.</p>
<p>You can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.</p>
<p>These are zero cost.</p>
<p>You can look up one that I particularly like</p>
<p>is NSDR Made For.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company I&rsquo;m associated with,</p>
<p>but the NSDR is completely zero cost.</p>
<p>And there are other things like Yoga Nidra,</p>
<p>which you can find scripts for elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, all of these habits or these behaviors,</p>
<p>these do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts around phase three themselves</p>
<p>might be habits that you&rsquo;re trying to create for yourself.</p>
<p>But again, phase three is really about making sure</p>
<p>that whatever limbic friction you&rsquo;ve been able to override</p>
<p>in phase one and trigger some new habit, right?</p>
<p>Forcing yourself to write or forcing yourself to study</p>
<p>or forcing yourself to exercise</p>
<p>during that high limbic friction state.</p>
<p>And then whatever things you&rsquo;ve been doing in phase two,</p>
<p>which are habits that hopefully have moved</p>
<p>a little bit further along the continuum of newly formed</p>
<p>versus all the way to reflexive</p>
<p>or things that take less limbic friction in order to do.</p>
<p>Phase three is when all of that gets really locked</p>
<p>into the nervous system through those heavy in mechanisms</p>
<p>like NMDA receptors, et cetera, that I talked about before.</p>
<p>Again, neuroplasticity is the basis of habit formation</p>
<p>and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits</p>
<p>happens in these states of deep sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not obeying this phase three,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not giving phase three the materials it needs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not avoiding the certain things like caffeine</p>
<p>and bright light and stress during phase three,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re simply not going to be able to build those habits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been working so hard to trigger in phase one</p>
<p>and phase two of the day.</p>
<p>Again, these are things that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,</p>
<p>but really this is about habit formation.</p>
<p>And the whole reason for placing particular types</p>
<p>of behaviors at particular phases of the day</p>
<p>is to set a framework for that task bracketing.</p>
<p>Again, task bracketing and those circuits</p>
<p>of the basal ganglia indicate that it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>the neural circuits that are engaged by the task itself,</p>
<p>but the neural circuits that are engaged before</p>
<p>and after that task execution,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what gets consolidated.</p>
<p>So when you do things at particular phases of the day</p>
<p>under particular conditions of neurochemistry,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re giving the brain</p>
<p>a very predictable set of sequences that during sleep,</p>
<p>it can start to put into your hard drive, if you will,</p>
<p>it can really program it into your nervous system</p>
<p>so that within a short period of time,</p>
<p>hopefully within 18 or maybe even six days or who knows,</p>
<p>maybe even fewer days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that executing those behaviors</p>
<p>is very, very straightforward for you</p>
<p>and that you won&rsquo;t have to feel so much limbic friction</p>
<p>or override so much limbic friction.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably asking,</p>
<p>okay, if I perform a particular habit during phase one,</p>
<p>and then I do other habits during phase two,</p>
<p>and I eventually get to the point where I&rsquo;m engaging</p>
<p>in those habits in a pretty effortless way,</p>
<p>do I keep them in the same phase of the day?</p>
<p>And the good news is the literature says it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And in fact, moving that particular habit</p>
<p>around somewhat randomly can actually be beneficial to you</p>
<p>because actually moving it from one time of day to the other</p>
<p>is that context independence that we really are seeking.</p>
<p>By being able to do the same thing that we want to do,</p>
<p>regardless of time of day or circumstances,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we know that we&rsquo;ve achieved</p>
<p>a real habit formation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we know that the habit has been moved</p>
<p>into certain components of our neural circuitry</p>
<p>that just allow us to do it what seems like reflexively.</p>
<p>Although earlier I pointed out that these aren&rsquo;t reflexes</p>
<p>in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that this brain area,</p>
<p>the hippocampus that many of you know</p>
<p>is associated with learning and memory</p>
<p>is not actually where memories are stored.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is where memories are formed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where procedures like I talked about before,</p>
<p>procedural memory of how you&rsquo;re going to execute</p>
<p>a particular sequence where that&rsquo;s maintained.</p>
<p>Sort of like if we use the recipe model,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the recipe is maintained</p>
<p>until you know how to cook that dish.</p>
<p>And then the procedural memory literally migrates off</p>
<p>into a different set of neural circuits,</p>
<p>which are the neural circuits of the neocortex</p>
<p>where we have maps of sensory experience,</p>
<p>maps of all kinds of experiences,</p>
<p>including motor maps of how to execute things.</p>
<p>So we use one part of the brain to learn something,</p>
<p>but then that information in the form</p>
<p>of the electrical activity of neurons</p>
<p>is passed off to a different brain area.</p>
<p>Now the neurons themselves don&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>from the hippocampus to the cortex, that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>What happens is the signals,</p>
<p>the sequence of electrical firing,</p>
<p>much like a script for a movie</p>
<p>or the notes on a sheet of paper</p>
<p>for a particular musical piece</p>
<p>is transferred off to a different brain area.</p>
<p>So that whole process of really leaning</p>
<p>into something that&rsquo;s hard, then it becoming easier.</p>
<p>And then eventually that thing becoming</p>
<p>more or less reflexive involves a migration</p>
<p>of the information in the brain.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s migrated out</p>
<p>to a different location in the brain,</p>
<p>at that point it&rsquo;s achieved context independence.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be bracketed by, you know,</p>
<p>your caffeine and your lunch.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to occur immediately</p>
<p>after your afternoon NSDR,</p>
<p>but before your four o&rsquo;clock meeting on Zoom</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>So all this is to say</p>
<p>that once something has become reflexive,</p>
<p>you should play with it a little bit about time of day.</p>
<p>If you want to keep it in the same phase of day, great.</p>
<p>But if you one day decide</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to exercise in the afternoon,</p>
<p>next day you decide you&rsquo;re going to exercise in the morning</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the habit that you&rsquo;re concerned with,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to do that,</p>
<p>that means that it&rsquo;s truly achieved context independence.</p>
<p>It means that you have officially formed that habit.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>much earlier at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>the strength of a habit is dictated</p>
<p>by how much limbic friction, that was one,</p>
<p>and how much context dependence there is.</p>
<p>So when it doesn&rsquo;t take much activation energy</p>
<p>to get into the execution of that habit</p>
<p>and you can do it in any context,</p>
<p>well, then you have formed a habit.</p>
<p>We really can&rsquo;t have a discussion</p>
<p>about learning anything, habits or otherwise,</p>
<p>unless we talk about reward prediction error.</p>
<p>Reward prediction error</p>
<p>is associated with the molecule dopamine,</p>
<p>although I should say there are other neurochemicals</p>
<p>in our brain and body that are also related</p>
<p>to reward prediction error.</p>
<p>But reward prediction error is a very good system</p>
<p>or I should say a lens through which to think about</p>
<p>whether or not we should reward ourselves</p>
<p>for performing a given habit.</p>
<p>And this is a much larger discussion</p>
<p>that actually relates to things like parenting</p>
<p>and self-regulation.</p>
<p>Should we reward kids just for effort?</p>
<p>Should we reward ourselves just for effort?</p>
<p>What should we reward?</p>
<p>How much should we reward ourselves?</p>
<p>When should we withdraw a reward?</p>
<p>Should we use punishment?</p>
<p>These kinds of things.</p>
<p>This is a vast literature.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into all the details,</p>
<p>but the notion of reward prediction error is so powerful</p>
<p>that it can predict most, if not all forms of learning,</p>
<p>including habit formation.</p>
<p>And you can deploy or use particular features</p>
<p>of reward prediction error,</p>
<p>if you would like to reinforce</p>
<p>or accelerate the formation of certain habits.</p>
<p>So reward prediction error, quite simply,</p>
<p>is if you expect a reward and the reward comes,</p>
<p>a particular behavior that was associated</p>
<p>with generating that reward is more likely to occur again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>However, the amount of reward</p>
<p>in the form of this molecule dopamine</p>
<p>that you will experience is even greater</p>
<p>if a reward arrives that&rsquo;s unexpected, okay?</p>
<p>So let me repeat that again.</p>
<p>If I think that something&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be great,</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s say I lean into a habit,</p>
<p>I managed to override my limbic friction</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing my 45 minutes of writing in the morning</p>
<p>with no phone and no internet,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting toward the end and I&rsquo;m anticipating,</p>
<p>huh, I&rsquo;m actually doing this.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling really, really good.</p>
<p>I finish, I definitely will receive a dopamine reward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make my own dopamine reward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it comes from.</p>
<p>Remember, this is all internal.</p>
<p>However, I will also receive dopamine reward</p>
<p>if unexpectedly something positive happens.</p>
<p>And typically if something unexpected but positive happens,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine reward that we get</p>
<p>is actually much greater than in any other conditions.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s hard to surprise yourself</p>
<p>about a behavior that you&rsquo;re deliberately engaging in.</p>
<p>So that becomes a bit of a tricky one.</p>
<p>Reward prediction error also says</p>
<p>that if we expect a reward and the reward doesn&rsquo;t come,</p>
<p>that the pattern of dopamine release</p>
<p>will follow a particular contour.</p>
<p>And that contour is very important.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that I&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m about 30 or 45 minutes in,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, this is great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually, I managed to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m succeeding in executing the behaviors that I need to</p>
<p>in order to perform this habit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m overriding limbic friction.</p>
<p>Just that series of thoughts will start to generate</p>
<p>a dopamine release within my brain and body.</p>
<p>However, if at the 50 minute mark,</p>
<p>the phone rings and I pick up the phone</p>
<p>or I break my own protocol, I break my own self-discipline</p>
<p>and I go on and check social media</p>
<p>or I do something that takes me out of that,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is that my level of dopamine</p>
<p>is actually going to drop below the baseline,</p>
<p>meaning below the level of dopamine I had</p>
<p>before I even started the habit execution.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So what this is, is this is a system that predicts</p>
<p>whether or not rewards are going to come.</p>
<p>When we think a reward is going to come,</p>
<p>it starts to actually arrive earlier</p>
<p>in the form of dopamine release.</p>
<p>This is the feeling that we experience</p>
<p>as in positive anticipation.</p>
<p>You tell a kid, hey, we&rsquo;re going to go to the amusement park</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to go get ice cream.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t had the ice cream yet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not at the amusement park, but they&rsquo;re excited.</p>
<p>The dopamine release comes earlier, okay?</p>
<p>They get to the amusement park or they get the ice cream,</p>
<p>they will also have some dopamine release</p>
<p>associated with that.</p>
<p>But most of it, believe it or not,</p>
<p>came in the form of the anticipation.</p>
<p>And dopamine has some qualities that make</p>
<p>the actual ice cream and the actual amusement park experience</p>
<p>more pleasurable than it would be</p>
<p>had that dopamine release not happened.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the other way to do it</p>
<p>is to surprise a kid.</p>
<p>You tell them, listen, we&rsquo;re going to the class</p>
<p>that you absolutely hate,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to go see the person</p>
<p>that you absolutely despise,</p>
<p>and then you drive them to the amusement park.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big release of dopamine.</p>
<p>But reward prediction error also says</p>
<p>that if you tell the kid or yourself,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re headed to the amusement park,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get some ice cream.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really, really excited.</p>
<p>And then you get there and it&rsquo;s closed</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not letting any more people in.</p>
<p>Well, then the dopamine level drops way below what it was</p>
<p>before you told them that you were headed there, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given a number of different examples</p>
<p>that hopefully make this clear.</p>
<p>Reward prediction error governs virtually all aspects</p>
<p>of effort and all aspects of learning.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because when dopamine is released in the brain and body,</p>
<p>the neural circuits of our brain and body change.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a state change.</p>
<p>Our overlevel, excuse me, our overall level of energy,</p>
<p>but also the sorts of sensory events</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re paying attention to changes</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a lot of dopamine in our system.</p>
<p>Now you can leverage this for habit formation.</p>
<p>Think back to task bracketing.</p>
<p>Think back to limbic friction.</p>
<p>If you are considering adopting a new habit</p>
<p>or if you are trying to break a habit,</p>
<p>something we haven&rsquo;t talked too much about,</p>
<p>but we will in a moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very useful to think not just about the procedural</p>
<p>aspects of what you&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>but also think about the events that precede</p>
<p>and follow that particular habit and the execution,</p>
<p>or at least the effort to execute that habit.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re casting a kind of a spotlight</p>
<p>or around a bin of time or a set of events</p>
<p>for which dopamine can be associated.</p>
<p>What does this look like in the practical sense?</p>
<p>Well, again, I&rsquo;ll just try and use</p>
<p>very simple concrete examples,</p>
<p>but this could carry over to anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I were somebody who has a hard time</p>
<p>getting in that 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardiovascular exercise mid-morning.</p>
<p>This is actually an issue for me.</p>
<p>I much prefer to do resistance exercise</p>
<p>than cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>Although once I do it,</p>
<p>I always feel much better that I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>What I should do is positively anticipate the onset</p>
<p>and the offset of that session, right?</p>
<p>So thinking about leaning into the effort,</p>
<p>going out and doing that zone two cardio session,</p>
<p>and I should think about how I&rsquo;m going to feel after.</p>
<p>So not just thinking about how great</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel after,</p>
<p>but also thinking about how hard it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>at the beginning and then trying to reward myself</p>
<p>subjectively for the entire experience.</p>
<p>In other words, start rewarding task bracketing</p>
<p>in addition to rewarding the execution of the habit itself.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be saying,</p>
<p>well, wait, this is all self-talk.</p>
<p>This is just positive self-talk,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not positive self-talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not saying, you know,</p>
<p>I feel so great about doing something that I actually hate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t lie to yourself,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re welcome to lie to yourself,</p>
<p>but the neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>the literature of growth mindset,</p>
<p>all the literature basically of mindset</p>
<p>speaks to the fact that when you lie to yourself,</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>and you actually set up the opposite of a reward system.</p>
<p>So you have to be brutally honest with yourself</p>
<p>that for instance,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like initiating this cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>but I do like the fact that I&rsquo;ve done it after I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>So what you are doing</p>
<p>is you are applying reward prediction error</p>
<p>to the entire sequence of things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in getting into the habit execution,</p>
<p>getting through the habit execution</p>
<p>and getting out of the habit execution.</p>
<p>How do you do this?</p>
<p>Well, I take us back to our procedural</p>
<p>memory visualization exercise that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>When I talked about it in that context,</p>
<p>I talked about walking through mentally</p>
<p>the series of steps that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to perform a particular habit.</p>
<p>So in the case of the zone two cardio thing,</p>
<p>it would be, okay, I&rsquo;m going to put on my shoes,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to head out the door,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to drive up the road.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular Canyon near here</p>
<p>that if I&rsquo;m going to run,</p>
<p>I happen to like running or I don&rsquo;t hate running enough</p>
<p>that I tend to do it.</p>
<p>Going through that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But even better would be to broaden the time bin</p>
<p>and start to positively anticipate</p>
<p>the period headed into the habit.</p>
<p>So even before you put on your shoes,</p>
<p>the fact that you are successfully placing the habit in,</p>
<p>in this case, phase one of the day,</p>
<p>and that afterwards I&rsquo;m going to feel</p>
<p>a particular set of positive benefits,</p>
<p>elevated mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>I like being hungry and typically after exercise, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p>So I like being hungry because I like eating.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole set of things</p>
<p>that link up with one another.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not just thinking about habit execution</p>
<p>as this isolated little set of events</p>
<p>or this little time bin,</p>
<p>but rather I&rsquo;m drawing a larger envelope around it</p>
<p>and starting to positively associate dopamine reward</p>
<p>with that larger envelope.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are thinking,</p>
<p>well, this is just a psychological trick.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve kind of,</p>
<p>this is sort of like lying to yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re not actually contradicting</p>
<p>the fact that some of this is unpleasant.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>this entire series of events,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m calling this kind of time envelope,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re associating it with a particular reward</p>
<p>that comes later, which for me would be the feeling</p>
<p>that, you know, that I&rsquo;ve completed this, right?</p>
<p>Because for me, that&rsquo;s usually a good feeling.</p>
<p>So reward prediction error is beautiful,</p>
<p>not just because it&rsquo;s a sort of math</p>
<p>of anticipation and reward</p>
<p>or a math of anticipation and disappointment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful because you can stretch out</p>
<p>or make more narrow the time bins</p>
<p>in which reward prediction error works.</p>
<p>Reward prediction error is the way</p>
<p>in which people navigate four-year degrees, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you go, sure, final exam to final exam, et cetera,</p>
<p>but ultimately there&rsquo;s a big payoff at the end</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all basically for that big payoff.</p>
<p>And of course, I understand that it&rsquo;s the journey,</p>
<p>not the destination, but let&rsquo;s face it for a lot of us,</p>
<p>goals and habits are about achieving</p>
<p>some sort of destination.</p>
<p>In the case of zone two cardio for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about trying to stay alive for as long as I can,</p>
<p>as long as I can with vitality that is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the fact that if I&rsquo;m doing that,</p>
<p>I get to eat the foods that I like.</p>
<p>I tend to be able to eat more,</p>
<p>which I happen to really enjoy eating so much</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;d like it just as an activity.</p>
<p>So basically what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is not restrict your thinking to just the habit</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to form,</p>
<p>but rather to grab a hold of the timing before and after</p>
<p>that particular habit and start to positively associate</p>
<p>reward mechanisms in your brain with that entire time bin.</p>
<p>This is a very useful and very powerful tool</p>
<p>in order to form habits.</p>
<p>And I should say that it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that comes naturally to most people.</p>
<p>In fact, even as I describe it,</p>
<p>you might find it&rsquo;s still a little bit abstract,</p>
<p>but what I encourage you to do</p>
<p>if you are finding it to be a little bit vague</p>
<p>would be to pick the habit that you want to form,</p>
<p>write down or think about very concretely,</p>
<p>what is the sequence of steps involved</p>
<p>in the execution of that habit?</p>
<p>And then write down or think about</p>
<p>what is the sequence of events</p>
<p>that need to precede that habit?</p>
<p>Maybe the immediate 10 or 15 minutes before,</p>
<p>as well as the immediate sequence of events</p>
<p>and or feelings that will occur after that habit.</p>
<p>And then call the whole thing a habit execution.</p>
<p>The whole thing,</p>
<p>a effort to engage in that particular habit.</p>
<p>And in doing that and in positively associating</p>
<p>with the idea that you&rsquo;re going to complete</p>
<p>that entire sequence,</p>
<p>you will engage reward prediction error</p>
<p>in the proper way that the dopamine surge</p>
<p>can lend itself toward motivation.</p>
<p>Because ultimately dopamine is not about feeling good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about feeling motivated.</p>
<p>This is something that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>numerous times before,</p>
<p>but dopamine contrary to popular belief</p>
<p>is not a reward molecule</p>
<p>as much as is a molecule of motivation and drive.</p>
<p>And the natural consequence of doing the exercise</p>
<p>I just described of writing things out that proceed</p>
<p>are involved in the immediate execution of the habit</p>
<p>and follow the habit</p>
<p>will allow you to experience an increase in energy</p>
<p>and thereby an increase in likelihood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to engage</p>
<p>in that entire sequence of events.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that dopamine gives us energy.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the molecule epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline is actually manufactured from dopamine.</p>
<p>Biochemically, it comes from dopamine.</p>
<p>So dopamine is powerful</p>
<p>and you can access more dopamine around</p>
<p>even habits that you haven&rsquo;t yet formed</p>
<p>by taking this broader time envelope</p>
<p>and task bracketing that specific task execution</p>
<p>or habit execution.</p>
<p>Way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I promised you that I would deliver two programs</p>
<p>that are geared towards habit formation.</p>
<p>And I promised that I would give you ways</p>
<p>in which you could gauge whether or not</p>
<p>certain habits had moved from high effort,</p>
<p>what I call high limbic friction to reflexive.</p>
<p>We talked about a number of ways to gauge that.</p>
<p>In researching this episode,</p>
<p>I found a tremendous number of different systems</p>
<p>for habit formation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing how much is out there.</p>
<p>There are ones that are 60 days to this</p>
<p>or 21 days to that, or 18 days to this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just rampant in the popular psychology</p>
<p>literature and in the self-help literature.</p>
<p>I want to spell out a particular system</p>
<p>that I think could be very useful to most,</p>
<p>if not all people that&rsquo;s rooted in the biology</p>
<p>of habit formation,</p>
<p>rooted in the psychology of habit formation,</p>
<p>and that is entirely compatible with that phase one,</p>
<p>phase two, phase three type program</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>but encompasses a bit of a longer time scale</p>
<p>and really arrives at a kind of a system, if you will,</p>
<p>for how to build in habits and then to test</p>
<p>whether or not those habits have really stuck</p>
<p>and whether or not they&rsquo;re likely to stick going forward.</p>
<p>And so this is, at least for sake of this example,</p>
<p>a 21 day system.</p>
<p>I picked 21 days because that seems to be the average</p>
<p>or most typical system for engaging neuroplasticity</p>
<p>as it relates to the formation of new habits.</p>
<p>This 21 day system actually is one that someone</p>
<p>I know very well uses and has used for a long time.</p>
<p>Actually use them, their kids use it as well.</p>
<p>And it has a certain elegance to it.</p>
<p>And I think as I describe it,</p>
<p>that elegance will begin to reveal itself.</p>
<p>So basically what this involves is</p>
<p>that you set out to perform six new habits per day</p>
<p>across the course of 21 days.</p>
<p>Why six and why 21?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>But the idea is you write down six things</p>
<p>that you would like to do every day for 21 days.</p>
<p>What phase of the day those things fall into?</p>
<p>Well, that will depend on what they are</p>
<p>and how they relate to those earlier phase one,</p>
<p>phase two, phase three.</p>
<p>But for now, 21 days, six things per day.</p>
<p>However, the expectation</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ll only complete four to five</p>
<p>of those each day, okay?</p>
<p>So built into this is a kind of permission to fail,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not failure because it turns out</p>
<p>that this approach to forming habits</p>
<p>is based not so much on the specific habits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to form,</p>
<p>but the habit of performing habits, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the habit of doing a certain number of things per day.</p>
<p>So you set out to perform six.</p>
<p>Now, another reason for not necessarily performing all six</p>
<p>is that some activities</p>
<p>probably shouldn&rsquo;t be performed each day.</p>
<p>For instance, in my case,</p>
<p>if I were to weight train or even run every day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the sort or my biology is of the sort</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t recover so well.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do resistance training every day,</p>
<p>but I might want to do it four days a week, for instance.</p>
<p>So by having six things in that list,</p>
<p>I could shuffle out that particular activity</p>
<p>on particular days of the week</p>
<p>and simply do four or five other activities.</p>
<p>So 21 days, you list out four to five things.</p>
<p>So it might be zone two cardio resistance training,</p>
<p>sunlight viewing, writing, it could be journaling.</p>
<p>It could be learning a language, mathematics.</p>
<p>Again, this is going to vary</p>
<p>depending on your particular goals</p>
<p>and the habits that you&rsquo;re trying to create,</p>
<p>but no more than six.</p>
<p>And the expectation is that you&rsquo;re not going to perform</p>
<p>more than four to five.</p>
<p>If you miss a day,</p>
<p>meaning you don&rsquo;t perform four to five things,</p>
<p>there is no punishment.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>try and do what in the literature is called</p>
<p>a habit slip compensation,</p>
<p>which is just fancy psychological language</p>
<p>for if you screw up and you don&rsquo;t get all four or five</p>
<p>in one day, you don&rsquo;t do eight the next day</p>
<p>in order to compensate.</p>
<p>This actually brings me back to an example</p>
<p>I had from graduate school.</p>
<p>I remember when I started graduate school,</p>
<p>feeling very excited, but a little bit overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the amount of things that I had to do</p>
<p>because I had to both do research.</p>
<p>I was doing coursework at the time,</p>
<p>graduate student stipends,</p>
<p>and still now, unfortunately, we&rsquo;re depressingly low.</p>
<p>So it was financially stressful.</p>
<p>There were a number of things happening.</p>
<p>And I remember a neurologist, this was at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fantastic scientist and person.</p>
<p>His name is Bob Knight.</p>
<p>Some of you may know him.</p>
<p>I remember he, I went to him and I asked,</p>
<p>what is the process by which someone actually</p>
<p>navigates graduate school successfully?</p>
<p>And he said, listen, you don&rsquo;t want to do anything</p>
<p>or engage in a routine in any way</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t keep up consistently for at least five</p>
<p>and ideally six days per week.</p>
<p>I thought, oh, that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>And he said, every four or five years,</p>
<p>you might have to update that,</p>
<p>but you need to decide what you can do consistently,</p>
<p>what you can do every day or at least six days a week</p>
<p>or five days a week.</p>
<p>And that was very, very useful to me.</p>
<p>And it fits well with this notion of habit slips</p>
<p>that if you happen to screw up</p>
<p>and not be able to engage in whatever habits</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to learn for whatever reason,</p>
<p>that the next day you just get right back</p>
<p>on the horse, so to speak.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a really interesting feature</p>
<p>from the neuroscience literature</p>
<p>and from the psychology literature</p>
<p>that says that chunking this 21 days into two day bins</p>
<p>can be very, very useful.</p>
<p>While it is true that the unit of the day</p>
<p>that our cells use is a circadian one, a 24 hour clock,</p>
<p>there does seem to be something powerful</p>
<p>about engaging in particular habits in a particular sequence</p>
<p>for two days in a row and then resetting.</p>
<p>So thinking, okay, I can do this for a day.</p>
<p>And if I can do it for a day,</p>
<p>I can probably do it for two days and then resetting.</p>
<p>So every two days you&rsquo;re resetting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re chunking this 21 days into a series of two day bins</p>
<p>in which you are trying to perform four to five new habits</p>
<p>and then completing that 21 days.</p>
<p>Now, everything I&rsquo;ve described about this 21 day program</p>
<p>with six things that you&rsquo;re trying to do as new habits</p>
<p>and only performing four to five</p>
<p>and not compensating, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing neuroscientifically unique about it,</p>
<p>except for the fact that it&rsquo;s not just 21 days</p>
<p>broken up into two day chunks.</p>
<p>After 21 days, you stop engaging in this 21 day</p>
<p>deliberate four to five things per day type schedule.</p>
<p>And you simply go into autopilot.</p>
<p>You ask yourself how many of those particular habits</p>
<p>that I was deliberately trying to learn</p>
<p>in the previous 21 days</p>
<p>are automatically incorporated into my schedule.</p>
<p>How many of them am I naturally doing?</p>
<p>In other words, every 21 days,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t update and start adding new habits.</p>
<p>You simply try and maintain the ones that you&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>in that first 21 days.</p>
<p>And this I think is extremely important</p>
<p>because in all of the habit literature that I could find,</p>
<p>sure, there was a lot of psychological data,</p>
<p>neuroscience data, behavioral science data</p>
<p>around here&rsquo;s how you form a habit.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you break a habit.</p>
<p>There was even some kind of tests</p>
<p>for whether or not a habit</p>
<p>had really achieved context independence,</p>
<p>whether or not it was a strongly formed habit.</p>
<p>But there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of information,</p>
<p>at least by my search,</p>
<p>of what to do once you&rsquo;ve formed a habit</p>
<p>and how to evaluate whether or not that habit</p>
<p>is likely to persist long into the future.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>You set out these six things that you would like to learn</p>
<p>or that you would like to acquire in your life,</p>
<p>these habits.</p>
<p>You only expect that you&rsquo;re going to perform</p>
<p>four or five each day.</p>
<p>You do that for 21 days.</p>
<p>Again, if you miss a day,</p>
<p>you just hop right back on the next day.</p>
<p>However, you should think about the functional units</p>
<p>within this 21 day period as two days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to try and nail four to five of these things</p>
<p>for two days.</p>
<p>If you happen to get all six, great,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not necessarily required.</p>
<p>So you can do it for two days,</p>
<p>then reset two days, then reset two days.</p>
<p>And then in the next 21 days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not trying to acquire any new habits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to throw in six more habits</p>
<p>that you want to learn.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply going to assess how well,</p>
<p>how deeply you&rsquo;ve rewired your nervous system</p>
<p>to be able to perform those six habits</p>
<p>of the previous 21 days.</p>
<p>And this is extremely useful, I believe,</p>
<p>because it will allow you to assess whether or not</p>
<p>you can indeed make room, if you even have room,</p>
<p>I should say, for more habits, right?</p>
<p>Many people are trying to cram so many new behaviors</p>
<p>into their nervous system that they don&rsquo;t stand a chance</p>
<p>of learning all those behaviors.</p>
<p>What you may find is that you kept up two of those things</p>
<p>very consistently throughout the 21 days.</p>
<p>And perhaps there was one of them that you did sporadically</p>
<p>and that there were three others that, frankly,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t manage to execute.</p>
<p>You may also be one of these people,</p>
<p>one of these mutants that sets out to do six new things</p>
<p>per day for 21 days and performs every single one of them.</p>
<p>Terrific, more power to you in that case</p>
<p>for the following 21 days.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see whether or not you can continue to perform</p>
<p>those very same six things every day for 21 days.</p>
<p>And then, and only then,</p>
<p>would you want to add more habits in?</p>
<p>So you could repeat this 21 day process,</p>
<p>21 days of new habit, 21 days of testing those new habits</p>
<p>as whether or not they&rsquo;re reflexive or not.</p>
<p>You could do that forever if you wanted.</p>
<p>But the idea is that this isn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing all year long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you perhaps starting the new year,</p>
<p>or regardless of when you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>you set out to make that 21 day really the stimulus period</p>
<p>in which the habits get wired in.</p>
<p>And then the following month,</p>
<p>and maybe even the following months or periods of 21 days</p>
<p>are really that kind of thermometer,</p>
<p>the test bed of how well you&rsquo;ve embedded</p>
<p>those particular habits.</p>
<p>And if indeed you want to continue to add new habits,</p>
<p>or you find that certain habits that you weren&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to embed in your nervous system and make reflexive,</p>
<p>you want to then bring those in, fantastic.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only once you&rsquo;ve achieved all those six habits</p>
<p>as reflexive that you would move forward.</p>
<p>And I think this sort of system,</p>
<p>while it could have been replaced</p>
<p>with many other different systems,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s nothing wholly about the system,</p>
<p>but this particular system has a number of features,</p>
<p>the lack of compensation for missed days,</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s a fairly high intensity program</p>
<p>for 21 days, but then you test yourself,</p>
<p>a kind of a competition test with yourself, if you will.</p>
<p>Those features and the fact that habit slips,</p>
<p>missing of particular habits and not doing all six</p>
<p>is kind of built into the system.</p>
<p>I think makes it a very reasonable one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very adaptable to the real world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one that provided you obey the phase one,</p>
<p>phase two, phase three type system</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>You collapse these two programs with one another,</p>
<p>which hopefully will be easy based</p>
<p>on the descriptions I&rsquo;ve given.</p>
<p>Well, if you do that,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a very high probability</p>
<p>that the habits that you try and form</p>
<p>will achieve this context dependence</p>
<p>and that it will take progressively less</p>
<p>and less limbic friction to perform them.</p>
<p>Thus far, we&rsquo;ve almost exclusively been discussing</p>
<p>how to form habits.</p>
<p>But what about breaking habits?</p>
<p>Certainly many people out there would like to break habits</p>
<p>that they feel don&rsquo;t serve them well.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in breaking habits</p>
<p>is that many habits occur very, very quickly.</p>
<p>And so there isn&rsquo;t an opportunity to intervene</p>
<p>until the habit has already been initiated</p>
<p>and in some cases completed.</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of tools</p>
<p>that neuroscience and psychology</p>
<p>tell us can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Some of those things are somewhat intuitive</p>
<p>and relate to what I call foundational practices,</p>
<p>meaning things that set the overall tone</p>
<p>in your body and brain,</p>
<p>such that you would be less likely</p>
<p>to engage in a particular habit</p>
<p>or that would raise your level of awareness,</p>
<p>both of your situation and to how you feel inside.</p>
<p>So things like stress reduction,</p>
<p>things like getting good sleep,</p>
<p>things like quality nutrition,</p>
<p>things like having positive routines</p>
<p>arranged throughout your day.</p>
<p>All of those, of course, will support you</p>
<p>in trying to break particular habits.</p>
<p>And while that can be very useful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s admittedly very generic advice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t point to any one specific protocol.</p>
<p>In order to identify a specific protocol</p>
<p>that one could apply in order to break habits,</p>
<p>we have to look at the mirror image</p>
<p>of the sort of neuroplasticity that we talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>we talked about a form of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>called long-term potentiation involving the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Just to refresh your memory a little bit,</p>
<p>it basically says that if a set of neurons</p>
<p>is very electrically active,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that over time,</p>
<p>those neurons will communicate with themselves more easily</p>
<p>because of changes in things like NMDA receptor activity,</p>
<p>the recruitment of additional receptors, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a cellular and molecular explanation</p>
<p>for how something goes from unlearned to learned</p>
<p>to reflexive.</p>
<p>Now, in order to break synapses</p>
<p>or to break apart neural connections</p>
<p>that are serving a habit that you don&rsquo;t want to engage in,</p>
<p>we need to engage the process called long-term depression.</p>
<p>And long-term depression has nothing to do</p>
<p>with a state of mental depression or a reduction in mood.</p>
<p>So I really want to be clear</p>
<p>that when I say depression in this context,</p>
<p>it has nothing to do with psychological depression.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with mood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply called long-term depression</p>
<p>because just as long-term potentiation says,</p>
<p>if neuron A triggers the firing of neuron B</p>
<p>and it does so very robustly over and over and over again,</p>
<p>the neuron A will not have to fire as intensely</p>
<p>or as frequently in order to activate neuron B</p>
<p>in the future because they become potentiated, right?</p>
<p>The threshold for co-activation has been reduced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much higher probability</p>
<p>that they will be activated together</p>
<p>at low levels of intensity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what long-term potentiation is.</p>
<p>Long-term depression says that if neuron A is active</p>
<p>and neuron B is not active within a particular time window,</p>
<p>then the connection between neuron A and B</p>
<p>will weaken over time,</p>
<p>even if they started off very strongly connected, okay?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to repeat that</p>
<p>because this is a pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism</p>
<p>whereby if neuron A is active and neuron B is active,</p>
<p>but at a different time or outside a particular,</p>
<p>what we call temporal window,</p>
<p>meaning outside a particular time window,</p>
<p>then through long-term depression,</p>
<p>the connection between neuron A and neuron B will weaken.</p>
<p>And just as a point of interest,</p>
<p>the NMDA receptor is also involved in long-term depression,</p>
<p>although there are other molecular components</p>
<p>involved as well.</p>
<p>So how do you take two neurons</p>
<p>that underlie a habit out of synchrony?</p>
<p>How do you get them to fire asynchronously?</p>
<p>This is pretty interesting</p>
<p>with respect to the cellular molecular biology,</p>
<p>but at the behavioral level, it&rsquo;s especially interesting.</p>
<p>The way that one would do this is let&rsquo;s say for instance,</p>
<p>you have a habit of picking up your phone mid work session.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a reflexive habit</p>
<p>I think that most people have experienced.</p>
<p>And we often hear the idea that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, the phone is so filled with access to dopamine</p>
<p>and incredible things that we&rsquo;re just drawn to it.</p>
<p>But if you notice what&rsquo;s happened with phone use over time,</p>
<p>most people, including myself sometimes, I admit,</p>
<p>find ourselves just looking at our phone</p>
<p>or find ourselves in a particular app</p>
<p>without actually having engaged</p>
<p>in the conscious set of steps of,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m really curious what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in this particular app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really curious what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in this particular website.</p>
<p>And you just kind of find yourself in air quotes.</p>
<p>For those of you listening, I&rsquo;m making air quotes.</p>
<p>You just sort of find yourself doing it</p>
<p>because of the behavior of picking up your phone</p>
<p>is sort of reflexive or has become fully reflexive.</p>
<p>You see this a lot at meals</p>
<p>where multiple people are there</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s looking at their phone.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden someone takes out their phone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll notice that other people</p>
<p>just naturally take out their phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of observed observation induced reflex.</p>
<p>And I would wager that most people aren&rsquo;t consciously aware</p>
<p>of the immediate steps involved.</p>
<p>So the literature says there are a number of ways</p>
<p>to break these sorts of habitual behaviors</p>
<p>or reflexive behaviors.</p>
<p>Most of those approaches involve establishing</p>
<p>some sort of reward for not performing the activity</p>
<p>or some sort of punishment for forming the activity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of some basic things that people will do.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll even put like a rubber band on their wrist</p>
<p>and every time they complain</p>
<p>or every time they do some behavior,</p>
<p>like pick up their phone,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll give themselves a snap on the wrist.</p>
<p>The rationale there is that you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>a somatic, a very physical representation</p>
<p>of something that makes it very real</p>
<p>and harder to overlook.</p>
<p>Other people will just do a tick mark on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The sort of what gets measured</p>
<p>is what gets managed kind of mindset,</p>
<p>where if every time you do something,</p>
<p>you take away the judgment.</p>
<p>This is very new agey, I realize,</p>
<p>but this is what you find out there</p>
<p>if you search the literature.</p>
<p>Even on PubMed, peer reviewed articles,</p>
<p>that every time you engage in a behavior,</p>
<p>you just measure the fact that you did that behavior.</p>
<p>You just mark it down at the end of the day.</p>
<p>People are supposed to look at that and say,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, I can&rsquo;t believe that I spent,</p>
<p>you know, three hours doing something</p>
<p>or I did it 46 times.</p>
<p>And in fact, a lot of apps, social media apps,</p>
<p>will start to give you warnings now</p>
<p>if you opt in that you&rsquo;ve been on the app for an hour,</p>
<p>would you like to leave?</p>
<p>Most people just click right past and go back in.</p>
<p>I think very few people say, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been an hour and therefore you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I absolutely shouldn&rsquo;t engage in this anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just far too easy to just blow past those reminders.</p>
<p>Well, the literature on habit formation</p>
<p>and habit reduction, breaking habits, has been analyzed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful meta-analysis,</p>
<p>which involves looking at a number of different studies</p>
<p>all together, comparing the statistical strength</p>
<p>of each of those studies, looking in different conditions,</p>
<p>what sorts of habits were trying to be made or broken.</p>
<p>The first author on this review is Fritz, F-R-I-T-Z.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll certainly put a link to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Heather Fritz and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Intervention to Modify Habits, a Scoping Review.</p>
<p>And it is indeed a very broad scale review.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the Journal of Occupation, Participation,</p>
<p>and Health, it&rsquo;s published in 2020.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice article.</p>
<p>A couple of things I learned from this article,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll get into the specific tool</p>
<p>for breaking habits.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting thing</p>
<p>that I took from this review was the finding</p>
<p>that notifications to either engage in habits</p>
<p>or to not engage in habits actually</p>
<p>were not very effective over time.</p>
<p>They were effective in the immediate period</p>
<p>when people started using these notifications</p>
<p>as were little sticky notes,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t go into the refrigerator</p>
<p>between the hours of whatever and whatever,</p>
<p>or just visual reminders, physical reminders</p>
<p>or electronic reminders were effective</p>
<p>in the immediate term, but in the long-term</p>
<p>did not predict whether or not people</p>
<p>would effectively stick to habits</p>
<p>they were trying to stick to or break habits</p>
<p>that they were trying to break.</p>
<p>So sadly, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work very well.</p>
<p>And perhaps they just need to come up</p>
<p>with more robust reminders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, mild electric shock or something like that,</p>
<p>because what we do know, only sort of kidding</p>
<p>about mild electric shock, but what we do know</p>
<p>from both human and animal studies</p>
<p>is that things like electric shock,</p>
<p>things like monetary penalties, right?</p>
<p>Having to pay out every time you engage</p>
<p>in a particular behavior, those are pretty effective ways</p>
<p>to break habits.</p>
<p>The problem is when people are not being monitored</p>
<p>for habit use, for instance, you can imagine a situation</p>
<p>where you say, I&rsquo;m not going to pick up my phone</p>
<p>for the four hours in the early part of the day</p>
<p>so that I can get real dedicated focus work done.</p>
<p>Unless someone&rsquo;s monitoring them,</p>
<p>then people don&rsquo;t tend to monitor themselves</p>
<p>completely enough that they punish themselves</p>
<p>completely enough that they break the behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, the punishment isn&rsquo;t bad enough</p>
<p>in order to break the habit, which just speaks</p>
<p>to how powerful these habits are</p>
<p>once they become reflexive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just very, very hard to override.</p>
<p>So it turns out that the key to generating</p>
<p>long-term depression in these pathways</p>
<p>is actually to take the period immediately following</p>
<p>the bad habit execution.</p>
<p>Meaning, let&rsquo;s say you tell yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to pick up your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to bite your nails,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to reflexively walk to the refrigerator</p>
<p>a particular time of day,</p>
<p>but you find yourself doing it anyway.</p>
<p>And what actually has to happen</p>
<p>is bringing conscious awareness to the period</p>
<p>immediately afterward, which I think</p>
<p>most people recognize.</p>
<p>They realize, oh, I just did it again.</p>
<p>I just did it again.</p>
<p>And in that moment, capture the sequence of events,</p>
<p>not that led to the bad habit execution,</p>
<p>but actually to take advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that the neurons that were responsible</p>
<p>for generating that bad habit were active a moment ago,</p>
<p>and to actually engage in a replacement behavior</p>
<p>immediately afterward.</p>
<p>Now, this is really interesting and I think powerful</p>
<p>because I would have thought that you have to engage</p>
<p>in a replacement behavior that truly replaces</p>
<p>the bad habit behavior, right?</p>
<p>That you would have to be able to identify</p>
<p>your state of mind or the sequence of events</p>
<p>leading into the bad habit,</p>
<p>but rather the stage or the period immediately</p>
<p>after the bad habit execution is a unique opportunity</p>
<p>to insert a different type of what we would call</p>
<p>adaptive behavior, but that could be any behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in line with the bad behavior.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s give it an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you find yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do focused work, you pick up your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re disappointing yourself for picking up your phone.</p>
<p>You could, of course, just put it down</p>
<p>and re-engage in the work behavior,</p>
<p>but if you were good at that,</p>
<p>then you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have done it in the first place.</p>
<p>And so what turns out to be very effective</p>
<p>is to go engage in some other positive habit.</p>
<p>Now, this has two major effects.</p>
<p>The first one is you start to link in time</p>
<p>the execution of a bad behavior to this other good behavior.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you start to recruit other neural circuits,</p>
<p>other neurons that can start to somewhat dismantle</p>
<p>the sequence of firing associated with the bad behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, you start to create a kind of a double habit</p>
<p>that starts with a bad habit and then ends with a good habit</p>
<p>and that seems to create enough of a temporal mismatch</p>
<p>so that then recognizing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re heading toward the bad habit</p>
<p>becomes more apparent to you.</p>
<p>So again, I want to make this very, very concrete.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that the behavior</p>
<p>is reflexively picking up one&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>You do that, you think, oh goodness, I did it again.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
<p>You would set that down</p>
<p>and then you would engage in some other positive behavior</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve deemed positive.</p>
<p>And here it&rsquo;s very subjective.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me to give an example</p>
<p>that will necessarily make sense to everybody,</p>
<p>but perhaps you&rsquo;re working on hydration.</p>
<p>So maybe you go have a glass of water.</p>
<p>Maybe you are trying to do breath work or something.</p>
<p>Maybe you are trying to enhance</p>
<p>your language speaking skills.</p>
<p>And so you go and you spend five minutes</p>
<p>doing a particular type of language learning.</p>
<p>You literally exit whatever you are doing</p>
<p>and perform that other new positive habit</p>
<p>in the immediate period right after that,</p>
<p>even for a short period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but what this does is it creates a kind of a cognitive</p>
<p>and a temporal mismatch between the initial bad behavior,</p>
<p>which before is what we would call sort of a closed loop</p>
<p>and the engineers out there</p>
<p>will know what I&rsquo;m talking about, but in closed loop,</p>
<p>so one behavior, one set of neural firings</p>
<p>leads to another, leads to another,</p>
<p>and then just kind of sets the same thing in motion.</p>
<p>It can be kind of a self-perpetuating system.</p>
<p>By changing the number of features that are in that loop,</p>
<p>it disrupts the closed nature of that loop.</p>
<p>It creates what we call an open loop.</p>
<p>And in an open loop, you are better able to intervene.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, this might seem counterintuitive.</p>
<p>You might think, why would I want to reward</p>
<p>the execution of a bad habit with a good habit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to reward myself for the bad habit,</p>
<p>but really what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re trying to change the nature of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are firing so that you can rewrite the script</p>
<p>for that bad habit.</p>
<p>A different way to put it would be,</p>
<p>imagine that the bad habit is like a chord on the piano</p>
<p>that you play or a chord of notes</p>
<p>or a sequence of notes that you would play.</p>
<p>And it comes very easily.</p>
<p>You can play it every single time,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say as you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>a new piece of music,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just constantly inserting that</p>
<p>at the inappropriate times.</p>
<p>That was a, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a decent enough analogy for a bad habit</p>
<p>because it involves some motor execution.</p>
<p>You just find yourself doing it.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to prevent yourself from doing it,</p>
<p>the next time you do it,</p>
<p>add in a new chord or sequence that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>What this does then is it changes the whole nature</p>
<p>of the sequence of neurons that are firing</p>
<p>from bad habit through to the end</p>
<p>of this newly applied good habit.</p>
<p>This is the way in which you start to dismantle,</p>
<p>or when I say dismantle,</p>
<p>really weaken the likelihood that if neuron A fires,</p>
<p>neuron B will fire.</p>
<p>Because as you&rsquo;re starting off in the mode</p>
<p>of very reflexively performing a bad habit,</p>
<p>those neurons are firing together</p>
<p>without you consciously being aware of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible for you to intervene in yourself</p>
<p>without a number of other features like severe punishment,</p>
<p>severe consequence type outcomes.</p>
<p>Rather, tacking on some additional sequences,</p>
<p>like if neuron A fires, neuron B fires,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re saying, okay, well, if neuron B fires,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start inserting neuron CDEF to fire, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the CDEF being the positive behavior</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to insert.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you create a chain of neuronal activation</p>
<p>that then is very easy to dismantle.</p>
<p>And so when people have applied this kind of approach,</p>
<p>it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s own behavior prior to that behavior,</p>
<p>which is very, very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Rather, what they find is that they are able to engage</p>
<p>in remapping of the neural circuits</p>
<p>associated with bad habits</p>
<p>in ways that are very, very straightforward, right?</p>
<p>Because you can always identify</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve done the thing you don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>and then tack onto that something additional</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>Now, the nature of that positive thing is important.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to be something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hard to execute.</p>
<p>You want it to be something that&rsquo;s positive</p>
<p>and fairly easy to execute</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not struggling all the time</p>
<p>to insert this on top of this bad behavior,</p>
<p>whatever that bad behavior might happen to be.</p>
<p>But again, this is rooted</p>
<p>in the biology of long-term depression.</p>
<p>It maps very well to the behavioral change literature</p>
<p>that I was able to glean that really shows</p>
<p>that rather than just get reminders,</p>
<p>rather than try and instill punishment,</p>
<p>rather than setting up reward for breaking bad habits,</p>
<p>that perhaps the simplest way to approach this</p>
<p>is to tack on additional behaviors to the bad habits,</p>
<p>make sure those behaviors are good behaviors</p>
<p>or behaviors that are adaptive for you.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you will soon find</p>
<p>that the initiation of the bad habit</p>
<p>takes on a whole new form</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re not even inspired to do it at all.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that breaking bad habits is really hard.</p>
<p>We had an episode all about addiction</p>
<p>with Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford Medical School.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a colleague of mine</p>
<p>who runs the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford.</p>
<p>And in that episode,</p>
<p>we talked a lot about how addicts for drugs, alcohol,</p>
<p>people who have addictions to certain types of behaviors</p>
<p>or avoidance behaviors even,</p>
<p>that in the case of addiction,</p>
<p>there has to be a tremendous kind of full-scale campaign</p>
<p>for them to be able to intervene in their behavior.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are thinking</p>
<p>about bad habit breaking</p>
<p>in the context of addictive type behaviors,</p>
<p>definitely check out that episode.</p>
<p>Addiction does employ some of these principles</p>
<p>around habit making and habit breaking, as it were.</p>
<p>But of course, because the consequences</p>
<p>of certain habits in addiction can be so severe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other sets of protocols</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a kind of a psychological backdrop to it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>It also relates to the biology of dopamine</p>
<p>and you can find all of that</p>
<p>in the episode with Dr. Anna Lembke.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve covered a lot about the biology</p>
<p>and psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>We talked about why certain habits are so hard to wire in,</p>
<p>why certain habits are so hard to break down and eliminate,</p>
<p>and how we can determine which habits</p>
<p>are going to be easier for us to access</p>
<p>and which habits are going to be harder</p>
<p>for us to access and break.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about this notion of limbic friction</p>
<p>and we talked about context dependence</p>
<p>and we talked about a number of different things</p>
<p>as it relates to neural circuits</p>
<p>and the formation of new connections in the brain</p>
<p>and strengthening and weakening</p>
<p>of connections in the brain.</p>
<p>We also discussed two programs,</p>
<p>programs designed specifically for you</p>
<p>on the basis of the neurobiology literature</p>
<p>and the literature on the psychology</p>
<p>of habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>Just to briefly recap,</p>
<p>one program involves dividing the 24-hour day</p>
<p>into three phases, phase one, phase two, phase three,</p>
<p>and to try and tackle specific habits</p>
<p>at particular phases of the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>The second program involved a 21-day process</p>
<p>of engaging approximately six new habits per day,</p>
<p>although the expectation, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re not going to perform all six of those,</p>
<p>and an assessment in the following 21 days</p>
<p>as to whether or not you have indeed</p>
<p>formed those new habits or not.</p>
<p>And there were a number of other features that I mentioned</p>
<p>that were related to those two general programs,</p>
<p>phase one, phase two, phase three,</p>
<p>and the 21-day program</p>
<p>and how those could be meshed together.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing some of you will probably have questions</p>
<p>about those programs and how to apply them,</p>
<p>but hopefully they were clear enough for you to get started.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity for me to mention</p>
<p>that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>has something called the Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>that is sent out approximately once a month.</p>
<p>For the next newsletter,</p>
<p>I will release a on-paper version of these two systems</p>
<p>and how they mesh together</p>
<p>for habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to access that,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com, you go to the menu,</p>
<p>you can sign up for the newsletter.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s zero cost.</p>
<p>Second of all, we have our privacy policy there,</p>
<p>but I can tell you right now,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t share your email with any vendors</p>
<p>or any other sources.</p>
<p>Those emails stay internal to us.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to see what the sort of flavor</p>
<p>of those newsletters is, the previous newsletters,</p>
<p>for instance, one on tools for sleep</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier or tools for neuroplasticity</p>
<p>in the classroom and outside the classroom as well,</p>
<p>for teachers and for students of various kinds,</p>
<p>those are also posted there.</p>
<p>So you can access any of the previous newsletters.</p>
<p>My hope is that today you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>both the biological mechanisms and the practical tools</p>
<p>by which you can start to establish habits</p>
<p>that for you, you deem adaptive, healthy,</p>
<p>and that are going to support you and your goals.</p>
<p>And that you can start to dismantle some of the habits</p>
<p>that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive</p>
<p>for you and for your goals.</p>

<p>Some of it is unique and different</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s on the podcast.</p>
<p>And once again, I want to thank you</p>
<p>for going on this journey of exploring the neuroscience</p>
<p>and the psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.</p>
<p>I hope it supports you in your goals.</p>
