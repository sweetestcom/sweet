    <ul>
<li>All right, good afternoon, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see you all here.</p>
<p>My name is Courtney Chandler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the senior assistant dean, chief strategy,</p>
<p>and operating officer here at the Haas School of Business</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be here.</p>
<p>On behalf of Dean Ann Harrison,</p>
<p>who is traveling today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you to our today&rsquo;s dean speaker series,</p>
<p>which is co-sponsored by the AmpEquity series.</p>
<p>I am really, really thrilled to be introducing today&rsquo;s guest</p>
<p>as well as welcoming back to campus,</p>
<p>Haas alumna, Yamini Rangan.</p>
<p>Yamini graduated&ndash;</p>
<p>(applauding)</p>
<p>Yamini graduated in 2003 as part</p>
<p>of our full-time MBA program.</p>
<p>And today Yamini serves as the CEO of HubSpot.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Yamini has been recognized</p>
<p>as a leader who is willing to jump into whatever challenges</p>
<p>is presented to her and the defies expectations</p>
<p>on her results.</p>
<p>This was never more on display then in 2021</p>
<p>when HubSpot co-founder Brian Halligan</p>
<p>unexpectedly needed to step down for medical reasons</p>
<p>following a snowmobiling accident,</p>
<p>and asked Yamini to take over running the company for him.</p>
<p>Not only did Yamini embrace this challenge,</p>
<p>but she was so successful after six months</p>
<p>in the role that Halligan asked her to take</p>
<p>the leadership position permanently.</p>
<p>Yamini brings, excuse me, a determination and growth mindset</p>
<p>to every position she&rsquo;s held in her career,</p>
<p>and no doubt, this has been integral to her success.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming CEO,</p>
<p>she served as HubSpot&rsquo;s first ever chief customer officer</p>
<p>overseeing about 3000 people on the marketing sales</p>
<p>and services team.</p>
<p>Before HubSpot, she served as the chief customer officer</p>
<p>at Dropbox and as a VP of sales and strategy</p>
<p>and operations at Workday,</p>
<p>where she helped quadruple revenue.</p>
<p>In 2019, Yamini was recognized as one</p>
<p>of the most influential women in business</p>
<p>by San Francisco Business Times.</p>
<p>Yamini, on behalf of us here at Berkeley Haas,</p>
<p>thank you so much for coming back</p>
<p>and speaking with us today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d now like to turn it over to Kelly McElhanney,</p>
<p>founding director of the Center for Equity,</p>
<p>Gender, and Leadership,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll be leading today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Courtney.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<p>I kind of wanna just to Yamini and talk,</p>
<p>but I know you&rsquo;re all here too.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, there&rsquo;s just so much interesting things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna try to boil it down.</p>
<p>And there will be time for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>My team will not let me be selfish, and we&rsquo;ll open it up.</p>
<p>But I have a question I wanna ask, but it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I wanna know, I&rsquo;m gonna do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start with question and then get bigger.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>So Brian has a snowmobile accident.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] That&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you get a call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what are you doing?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What are you, what&rsquo;s like, Hey, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Can you be the CEO?</p>
<p>(overlapping discussion)</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, doesn&rsquo;t ask quite as dramatic,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you, first of all,</p>
<p>it is so fantastic to be here.</p>
<p>I was here in 2001 with my friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so nice to see you both.</p>
<p>We were all class of 2001, and I remember actually</p>
<p>just joining and, Mimi and Farmina,</p>
<p>they were literally on gold cohort,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s like fantastic to kind of be back here.</p>
<p>And it is just really, really exciting.</p>
<p>So thanks a lot for having me here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s special.</p>
<p>Haas is special.</p>
<p>So anytime coming here is a real, real special treat for me.</p>
<p>And Kelly, you are special.</p>
<p>I think we have had a very longstanding conversation</p>
<p>about diversity and equity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m especially thrilled to come here and join you all.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this was March, 2021.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d been with the company for about a year</p>
<p>and three months, so about five quarters,</p>
<p>and Brian who&rsquo;s the CEO of HubSpot,</p>
<p>and HubSpot is a CRM company for small</p>
<p>and medium businesses.</p>
<p>And I just found out today that Haas and Berkeley uses it</p>
<p>so thrilled to have you all as customers.</p>
<p>We provide marketing sales and service software</p>
<p>for small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been our co-founder as well as CEO for 15 years.</p>
<p>And he was on a snowmobile, getting lunch with his son,</p>
<p>and unfortunately met with somewhat</p>
<p>of a really terrible accident where he broke, you know,</p>
<p>13 bones, was not able to move for six months,</p>
<p>and it was a very key point and turning point, I think,</p>
<p>for him as well as for the company.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d been with the company for about five quarters,</p>
<p>and you know, he called from the hospital</p>
<p>saying that he was not in a position to move,</p>
<p>but he knew and trusted the leadership team</p>
<p>and me to run the organization.</p>
<p>And it was one of those, oh my god,</p>
<p>what is going to happen?</p>
<p>But, you know, in moments like those</p>
<p>in almost ever pivotal moment that you have in your life,</p>
<p>you have to go back to just basic guiding principles</p>
<p>and first principles with which you operate.</p>
<p>And there were a couple of first principles for me.</p>
<p>One is our organization is exceptionally customer centric,</p>
<p>and one of the first principles we have is solve</p>
<p>for the customer.</p>
<p>We call it SFTC, and SFTC is literally everywhere</p>
<p>within the organization.</p>
<p>And so when anything happens that causes a pivot</p>
<p>within the organization, we have to go back</p>
<p>to that first principle.</p>
<p>And then the second one is really</p>
<p>to provide stability and clarity.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the role of leadership,</p>
<p>is to consume uncertainty and be able to deliver clarity.</p>
<p>And so I think those two were literally the first reactions,</p>
<p>how do we continue to solve for the customers</p>
<p>and how as leaders can we continue</p>
<p>to consume uncertainty and transmit clarity?</p>
<p>And yeah, that was last March.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Brian, I will go back to the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start by talking about her journey</p>
<p>from India to technology, but just one more thought.</p>
<p>Brian had a list of people that he could have gone to</p>
<p>and he came to you first.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that says a lot, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Yamini] I hope so.</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>(overlapping discussion)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;d probably been there the shortest amount,</li>
</ul>
<p>and that&rsquo;s amazing to me, I just wanna amplify that,</p>
<p>in our AmpEquity speaker series, that he called her first.</p>
<p>But let me go back with what we had planned to do,</p>
<p>which is talk about, yeah, your journey growing up in India</p>
<p>and how that brought you here to the United States,</p>
<p>into tech, and now into a position of CEO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I will say Berkeley, my two years here were pivotal.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, my journey I&rsquo;ll keep it short,</p>
<p>I grew up in India and started in a very small town</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have a high school.</p>
<p>So part of my early childhood was making sure</p>
<p>that I would get to some kind of college,</p>
<p>and my parents made tons of sacrifices.</p>
<p>My mom moved to a different city</p>
<p>so we could complete our education.</p>
<p>And so fairly humble beginning.</p>
<p>So certainly not aspiring at that time to get</p>
<p>to any type of C-suite position.</p>
<p>So my journey started as an engineer,</p>
<p>and a lot of people say,</p>
<p>Hey, how did you come to the conclusion?</p>
<p>I have an elder sister.</p>
<p>She became a doctor.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to do what she didn&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>I ended up becoming an engineer.</p>
<p>So there was nothing profound about my choice.</p>
<p>But what was very helpful starting as an engineer</p>
<p>is that first principles thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that systems thinking?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like anything that I&rsquo;ve done in my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone back to having first principles</p>
<p>to be able to guide decisions.</p>
<p>And then I came to the US and I studied,</p>
<p>as a computer engineer and continued</p>
<p>my graduate program there and started working</p>
<p>as an engineer.</p>
<p>And as I was in engineering,</p>
<p>I found like my colleagues would always say,</p>
<p>Hey, you should present, you know, our project to, you know,</p>
<p>the boss or to some team.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, I must be good at presenting.</p>
<p>Turns out I was bad at coding.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>So they were like, yeah, you know what,</p>
<p>let at me code and why don&rsquo;t you present?</p>
<p>You seem to be doing that a little bit better.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I found myself like talking</p>
<p>about technology and explaining technology</p>
<p>much more than coding, and I was like, yeah,</p>
<p>this is about the time I was like, okay,</p>
<p>Berkeley sounds great.</p>
<p>So I was fortunate enough to join Berkeley</p>
<p>in 2001 with my cohort mates,</p>
<p>and it was probably the best two years,</p>
<p>you know, of my experience.</p>
<p>And it was also pivotal time.</p>
<p>You know, many may remember,</p>
<p>but September, 9/11 happened right after we started here</p>
<p>in Berkeley and it was a very, very different campus.</p>
<p>When a huge pivotal event like 9/11 happens,</p>
<p>the campus turns very different.</p>
<p>And so for me, I wanted to come in and I wanted</p>
<p>to change my career and found out that I was going</p>
<p>to go back into tech after I graduated,</p>
<p>and I wanted to be in product marketing,</p>
<p>and again, went and did my pitch thinking,</p>
<p>Hey, I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at presenting.</p>
<p>And at the end of the whole pitch, they said,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re gonna be in sales.</p>
<p>And again, it was a very, you know,</p>
<p>a choice that I did not make at that time,</p>
<p>but turns out there are two things that you can do in tech.</p>
<p>You can build a product or you can sell the product,</p>
<p>and both of those are exceptionally foundational in,</p>
<p>you know, what you learn in tech companies.</p>
<p>And so it turns out that was a great choice because I spent</p>
<p>about a decade in sales selling</p>
<p>and understanding buyer behavior and buyer trends,</p>
<p>which turns out to be really, really important</p>
<p>in almost to any industry,</p>
<p>understanding your customers,</p>
<p>understanding why they make choices</p>
<p>and how they make choices, and really catering to that.</p>
<p>And so solving for customers came early based</p>
<p>on all of those experiences.</p>
<p>And then the second decade after Berkeley,</p>
<p>I spent at scaling companies, Workday,</p>
<p>which is a company that&rsquo;s based in Pleasanton,</p>
<p>a cloud ERP company, as well as Dropbox,</p>
<p>which is, you know, an SMB company.</p>
<p>So both of those gave me experiences in terms of scaling.</p>
<p>I tell you all of this because, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here sitting, and some of you are thinking,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do in my life.</p>
<p>I want to, you know, accomplish a lot.</p>
<p>I wanna have impact, but I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s totally fine because life happens</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really trying to make</p>
<p>the best out of opportunity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I got to HubSpot.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I love that because one of the things</li>
</ul>
<p>I hear from that is tech is not just coding, you know?</p>
<p>And I think if we open that up, more people,</p>
<p>more people from just men will be much more interested</p>
<p>in tech when we look at the broader swath of,</p>
<p>you know, your presentation skills got you there,</p>
<p>obviously your engineering degree and everything else.</p>
<p>But I like that story.</p>
<p>So talk about, you&rsquo;ve been at HubSpot now two years?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Two and a half.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two and a half years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What did diversity, equity and inclusion look like</p>
<p>when you started, what does it look like today,</p>
<p>and then maybe some strategies and learnings</p>
<p>from a corporate perspective,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna get into you more as a personal leader.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean, look, Kelly,</li>
</ul>
<p>I can talk to you for a while about diversity and equity.</p>
<p>And I think at HubSpot early on, probably in 2016 and &lsquo;17,</p>
<p>we recognized that change was not happening fast enough.</p>
<p>And that was the time we committed ourselves</p>
<p>to having a diverse and inclusive work environment.</p>
<p>And so we released our first diversity report in 2017,</p>
<p>and that report was not so great in terms of the results.</p>
<p>So we had 15% of our North America employee base</p>
<p>identify as BIPOC,</p>
<p>which is black indigenous people of color.</p>
<p>And we looked at our management ranks,</p>
<p>which is anybody within director or above, so directors,</p>
<p>VPs, SVPs, and above, and more than 60% were male.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t quite like where we started</p>
<p>in terms of that journey.</p>
<p>And so since then, we&rsquo;ve been on a whole path</p>
<p>of really building equity, inclusion and diversity</p>
<p>into the DNA of the company.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that change does not happen overnight</p>
<p>and change does not happen on an annual initiative basis.</p>
<p>It really needs to be built into the DNA</p>
<p>of the organization.</p>
<p>So we released our sixth diversity report last week</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve made, you know, pretty significant progress.</p>
<p>The percentage of employees that identify as BIPOC</p>
<p>has gone from 15% to 35%,</p>
<p>the number of female leaders</p>
<p>within the organization has flipped.</p>
<p>So we now have 60% women in leadership positions.</p>
<p>Within our executive team of nine, four are women.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s me, the CFO is Kate Bueker,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been with us for a few years.</p>
<p>We just hired our CPO, she&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>and our chief product and people officer.</p>
<p>So we have four out of nine, and within our board,</p>
<p>70% identify as women or BIPOC.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just a lot of progress</p>
<p>. And I think we know that we are walking the walk</p>
<p>in terms of diversity, but we also know that change</p>
<p>takes a while and part of what we are working on</p>
<p>and the challenge that we face is now</p>
<p>that we have hired a lot of employees</p>
<p>coming from very diverse backgrounds,</p>
<p>how do we make sure that we onboard them?</p>
<p>How do we make sure that we develop them?</p>
<p>And how do we make sure that we retain</p>
<p>and promote them so that this does not stop</p>
<p>and we actually make meaningful progress</p>
<p>over the next few years?</p>
<p>And I was telling Kelly that, you know,</p>
<p>days seem long, but years seem short.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is it feels</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s not enough progress on a day to day,</p>
<p>week to week basis.</p>
<p>But when you look at it, you know,</p>
<p>over a year or over a five year period,</p>
<p>you begin to see that type of change happen.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot more for us to learn from you</p>
<p>and your playbooks, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I was, Genevieve and ISH-UH-TUH,</li>
</ul>
<p>telling her about our Belonging playbook.</p>
<p>And so she wants an early copy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So EGAL has a belonging playbook</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just being wrapped up and designed,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;ll really, really like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any MBA students from my fall class,</p>
<p>but they were really pushing hard on incremental change</p>
<p>versus just ripping the gate off,</p>
<p>and I wanted to, that&rsquo;s why I wanted her to talk</p>
<p>about that sort of, it&rsquo;s the tension</p>
<p>between incremental change and really sweeping change.</p>
<p>Talk more now about you individually as a leader,</p>
<p>maybe what we&rsquo;re, I would love to hear</p>
<p>two leadership lessons, one that was painful</p>
<p>and you got a little bloodied and one that maybe more fun</p>
<p>to learn along the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>All lessons are a gift.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, I will tell you some more painful than the others.</p>
<p>You know, I think the first one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the leadership lesson is really to be very mindful</p>
<p>of transitions as you evolve as a leader.</p>
<p>And you know, in our careers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go through a number of transitions,</p>
<p>first from an individual contributor</p>
<p>to maybe a manager and then from a manager to maybe,</p>
<p>you know, leader of a large group.</p>
<p>And then from there in your journey to C-suite.</p>
<p>And every one of those transitions are,</p>
<p>you really need to be mindful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you like the first transition</p>
<p>was probably the bloodiest,</p>
<p>most painful one as an individual contributor</p>
<p>to becoming a manager.</p>
<p>And as an individual contributor,</p>
<p>this was after my time at Haas, I was in sales.</p>
<p>And so it is fairly clear in terms</p>
<p>of what performance metrics there are, because in sales,</p>
<p>you have a quota and you have a number,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very clear when you get those,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mostly controlled by yourself.</p>
<p>Now you do have to have great relationship building</p>
<p>with your customers, but that is the key.</p>
<p>And so when I first transitioned from being</p>
<p>an individual contributor in sales to being a manager,</p>
<p>I thought I was doing everything right.</p>
<p>I was, you know, I was working longer than everybody else.</p>
<p>I was working faster than everybody else.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, this is gonna work out great.</p>
<p>Turns out, terrible, terrible.</p>
<p>I think my first performance review after I transitioned</p>
<p>to the manager, I literally took it home</p>
<p>and I was like, oh my God, I made a really big mistake.</p>
<p>I think I am not fit to be a manager.</p>
<p>I probably have to like go back and get back</p>
<p>into my older job of being an individual contributor.</p>
<p>And I found out a few painful lessons.</p>
<p>The first one is when you are an individual contributor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a sprinter&rsquo;s mindset,</p>
<p>you work really fast and you&rsquo;re kind of going,</p>
<p>you know, by yourself.</p>
<p>And when you become a manager,</p>
<p>it is a coach and a cross country coach kind of a mindset,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s not about how fast you go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how you bring people a long in that journey</p>
<p>and how you coach people along the journey.</p>
<p>And so that was a painful experience.</p>
<p>I think the second one is as an individual contributor,</p>
<p>you spend a lot of time making sure that you have answers,</p>
<p>answers your boss might have, or you know,</p>
<p>answers for questions that your boss might have,</p>
<p>or your customer might have.</p>
<p>And the transition is you have to get really good</p>
<p>at asking questions because when you have a team</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re managing a team,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want you to give them all the answers.</p>
<p>They want to know that they can get</p>
<p>to the answers themselves.</p>
<p>And so I had to stop giving answers</p>
<p>and I had to start asking questions,</p>
<p>and that was a huge transition in terms</p>
<p>of thinking about it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I learned, you know,</p>
<p>a couple of lessons from the early stages.</p>
<p>And since then, you know, I&rsquo;ve taken every transition</p>
<p>as a time to pause, reflect and see what you know</p>
<p>are the practices that I have to continue keeping</p>
<p>versus what are the practices that I have to lose</p>
<p>and completely change,</p>
<p>and that has been just an important lesson,</p>
<p>probably very, very painful,</p>
<p>especially based on my initial few performance reviews.</p>
<p>I think the second I would say is that great leaders</p>
<p>are great learners.</p>
<p>And we have something at HubSpot that where we say,</p>
<p>we do not wanna be know-it-alls, we wanna be learn-it-alls.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an exceptionally important lesson</p>
<p>in terms of leadership.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is almost every opportunity</p>
<p>is really about learning.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t need to be perfect as a leader.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to have all of the answers.</p>
<p>And one of the best leaders, you know, really,</p>
<p>if you look at the trajectories about how much</p>
<p>they can change and evolve and learn.</p>
<p>And so the second big lesson is really about, you know,</p>
<p>how to be a great learner before trying</p>
<p>to be a great leader.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say those two are pretty big lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, guys, I&rsquo;m just taking too many notes</li>
</ul>
<p>because this is such great, this is really great,</p>
<p>and I like that one in particular</p>
<p>because it matches our defining principle at Haas</p>
<p>of students always.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did we steal that from you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] No, no, I stole it from Haas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For sure, that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually like your language better, but okay.</p>
<p>So you talk about, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that you bring up transitions as being a learning moment.</p>
<p>One thing that literature shows around imposter syndrome</p>
<p>is that it often shows up,</p>
<p>and I believe it shows up for men and women,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t wanna perpetuate a myth that only women</p>
<p>have imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>I think we let it hold us back more.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both men and women have it,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but the research shows that imposter syndrome</p>
<p>is often highest when you just get a promotion</p>
<p>or recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How, I really don&rsquo;t, so please don&rsquo;t answer it this way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>How do you deal with imposter syndrome?</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t, I wonder how effective it is</p>
<p>when the message is what I learned growing up,</p>
<p>fake it until you make it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if I could fake it</li>
</ul>
<p>until I make it&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Kelly] But that was the advice I got, to fake it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, you know, but Kelly,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the point that you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met plenty of men, you know,</p>
<p>in my career where they feel like they don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>But I do think that women assume that they need</p>
<p>to know everything in the next job</p>
<p>to feel really good.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, a tremendous is number of studies</p>
<p>where if you look at a job description,</p>
<p>the exact same job description,</p>
<p>a male might look at it and say, if I have 50% of it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do phenomenally well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to apply and I&rsquo;ll crush it,</p>
<p>versus a woman looking at the same job description</p>
<p>will want to check off 90% before</p>
<p>they feel confident enough to apply.</p>
<p>And so I do think that we bias ourselves in some of this.</p>
<p>But I will tell, you know,</p>
<p>have I felt imposter syndrome?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, in every one of the transitions,</p>
<p>the first time I actually got my VP promotion,</p>
<p>which in the industry was a pretty big deal,</p>
<p>and when I got it, I was like, no, why, I&rsquo;m not ready?</p>
<p>I thought I had a few more, you know,</p>
<p>quarters to prove this.</p>
<p>And so I was like, no, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>when Brian called and he said,</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna make you permanent CEO,</p>
<p>I was like, no.</p>
<p>The first word were like, no, are you sure?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And you know, in every one of those transitions,</p>
<p>I think the key thing that I have recognized</p>
<p>is that imposter syndrome really comes down</p>
<p>to your perception not being close enough to reality.</p>
<p>It really comes down to, you know,</p>
<p>your sense of what you can accomplish and what you can</p>
<p>actually do is not the same as reality</p>
<p>because someone else actually thinks very differently</p>
<p>from what you think of yourself.</p>
<p>And so my practical advice and I&rsquo;ve gone through this</p>
<p>multiple times in my career is,</p>
<p>when I get to the point of questioning</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m capable of taking the next big challenge</p>
<p>and someone else thinks that I go on and talk</p>
<p>to people that will give me the truth.</p>
<p>So you do need to have truth sayers, you know, around you.</p>
<p>You can call them board of directors,</p>
<p>you can call them mentors, you can call them sponsors,</p>
<p>you can call them any of those names.</p>
<p>But you do need to have someone who will tell you the truth</p>
<p>because your perception is different than the reality.</p>
<p>And so in the case of my last transition, you know,</p>
<p>when Brian called me and I was like,</p>
<p>let me just, you know, take a day or two</p>
<p>to really assess this, you know,</p>
<p>I called our lead independent director of the board.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d seen me operate for a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known her, and I said, are you sure?</p>
<p>Tell me what you&rsquo;re seeing that maybe I need</p>
<p>to catch up with reality.</p>
<p>You know, I asked mentors that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>and who have seen me develop over the last decade,</p>
<p>I said, tell me what, you know,</p>
<p>you are seeing that I should be paying attention to.</p>
<p>I asked my kids, and I have two boys, and I said,</p>
<p>Hey, do you think mom can do this?</p>
<p>And frankly, like, you know,</p>
<p>every one of those actually shared a perspective</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t have of myself and my own capability.</p>
<p>And so I do think imposter syndrome comes a lot</p>
<p>to do with your perception and the gap</p>
<p>of that perception with reality.</p>
<p>And when you do close the gap, then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, I can do it.</p>
<p>Of course, every role you&rsquo;re going to have to learn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to challenge.</p>
<p>But then you now have enough of a judgment</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done these things in the past</p>
<p>that can help you in the future.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I think of closing the gap.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So utilizing your personal board, which I love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But what did your son say?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, he was like, go for it, mommy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>(overlapping discussion)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How old is he, I have a daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, sorry, too old then.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You mentioned mentors and sponsors.</p>
<p>Do you see those as two separate different things,</p>
<p>and how did you go about finding mentors and sponsors,</p>
<p>or did they find you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, do you have a strategy?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean, look, they are different.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;re very, very different.</p>
<p>I mean, a mentor to me is someone that you can learn from.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually for a very specific period of time</p>
<p>for a certain skill,</p>
<p>versus sponsor is someone who is advocating</p>
<p>for you in your career and are, you know,</p>
<p>is helping you kind of get to the next level.</p>
<p>So they are very different.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of folks, you know, come to me and say,</p>
<p>Hey, I want, you know, you to be a mentor,</p>
<p>and most of the times I ask for,</p>
<p>what is the specific skill that you&rsquo;re looking to learn.</p>
<p>And when I have, you know, have gone out</p>
<p>and reached out mentors I&rsquo;ve asked for,</p>
<p>Hey, I see that you&rsquo;ve done a great job</p>
<p>of building your leadership team.</p>
<p>I would like for a six month period where I can learn</p>
<p>from you on how you&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really skill based and competency based,</p>
<p>and sometimes people get confused.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have someone come and say,</p>
<p>Hey, I want some time, but all I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>is get promoted to the next level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t help you get to the next level</p>
<p>as a promotion, but I can help you if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a specific skill.</p>
<p>And so Kelly, I think your question of, did they find you,</p>
<p>it is a natural a process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to now have like five mentors</p>
<p>and I wanna get five mentors by this date.</p>
<p>I think you really have to let it develop</p>
<p>a little bit organically, but you have to look</p>
<p>at where are you today, where do you wanna, you know,</p>
<p>be in three years or five years,</p>
<p>and what are the core skill sets</p>
<p>that you need to develop,</p>
<p>and then go find people who can help you develop</p>
<p>with each of those core skill sets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way you think about having</p>
<p>a great board of directors or, you know,</p>
<p>personal board of directors.</p>
<p>I think sponsorship is completely different.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is someone who is directly in your line of chain</p>
<p>and someone who is advocating for you when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the room.</p>
<p>And the best way to find a sponsor is to earn the trust,</p>
<p>earn their credibility so that they can represent you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not there in the room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some incredible sponsors, people that, you know,</p>
<p>bet on me even before I bet on myself,</p>
<p>but that was because I had worked incredibly hard</p>
<p>to gain their trust and gain the credibility with them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very, very different,</p>
<p>and you actually need both for different reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m just curious if you see a difference, right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m a data wonk,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m much more interested in the real world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the data says that men are, women have more mentors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and men are better at strategically finding sponsors.</p>
<p>Do you see that to be true?</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely, absolutely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I think like we just tend to be perfectionists</p>
<p>in almost everything that we do.</p>
<p>And so we are like, ah, I need to develop all these things</p>
<p>before I can ask for a promotion.</p>
<p>I need to do all of these gaps before I can go</p>
<p>to the next level.</p>
<p>Whereas I think that&rsquo;s not the way world works.</p>
<p>And so I do think that there is a gender bias</p>
<p>that they put on ourselves there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Kelly] So the data&rsquo;s true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] The data seems to be true, absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We had a bit of a, you know, we&rsquo;re doing a bit,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>we have been doing a lot of work around language,</p>
<p>and one of the bits of this work that I think a lot about</p>
<p>is self identities or how do we wanna be identified?</p>
<p>And one of our tips in our playbook around language</p>
<p>is listen to how somebody identifies and then match that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I was, I trust you,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I was able to ask and I like to ask direct questions,</p>
<p>so I would love to share this.</p>
<p>Do you consider yourself a BIPOC female leader?</p>
<p>Do you think of yourself that way?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I did not.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I started, you know, my career and certainly</p>
<p>when I was in Haas, I was like another student, you know,</p>
<p>going to business school, trying to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>things in the world.</p>
<p>And so no, I have never considered myself</p>
<p>as a BIPOC leader or female leader,</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what I brought in.</p>
<p>And also the choices that I made in my career,</p>
<p>being an engineer in tech,</p>
<p>like not a lot of like women around,</p>
<p>and being in sales in tech, not a lot of women around.</p>
<p>So as in mostly early career stages,</p>
<p>I was probably the only woman around and I did a lot</p>
<p>to kind of, you know, let people not put a,</p>
<p>shine a light on that.</p>
<p>I think that was the most important thing.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I have to hang with this group</p>
<p>and I have to really be part of, you know,</p>
<p>we talked about belonging.</p>
<p>I wanted to just belong in that group.</p>
<p>And so I spent a lot of time not thinking about the fact</p>
<p>that I was an Asian woman, Indian woman, or woman,</p>
<p>you know, in the room that I was in.</p>
<p>But what I have found is that as I have grown my career,</p>
<p>I want the next generation of women</p>
<p>as well as BIPOC leaders to feel like</p>
<p>they can belong without having the need to change.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve found that as I&rsquo;ve progressed in my career,</p>
<p>and certainly where I am right now,</p>
<p>that me sharing my identity as yes, an Indian woman,</p>
<p>a person of color, a woman, it helps the next generation.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m embracing it a lot more.</p>
<p>But I certainly started at a point</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that that is happening in the world,</li>
</ul>
<p>that you now feel comfortable,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re also intentionally embracing it</p>
<p>to free generations, you know,</p>
<p>younger generations to embrace it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, and I I&rsquo;ll say like, you know, tech,</li>
</ul>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re all from different industries.</p>
<p>Tech is not, you know, wasn&rsquo;t the most friendly,</p>
<p>but there are industries that are even farther behind</p>
<p>in terms of diversity,</p>
<p>and it shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard for diverse leaders</p>
<p>to be in the C-suite.</p>
<p>And in order for us to have just not incremental change,</p>
<p>but really needle moving change,</p>
<p>we have to be talk talking about the challenges that we face</p>
<p>or being the one person in the room</p>
<p>that looks very different,</p>
<p>for being the person in the room that does not belong.</p>
<p>for really, even in those situations,</p>
<p>being authentic to yourself and what you bring.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re there, here,</li>
</ul>
<p>but also there in that position for other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna open up to questions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll ask one before that.</p>
<p>What do you just feel most proud of in your life,</p>
<p>just in general as a leader.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, so I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m most proud of.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m most proud of like being present with my family</p>
<p>while having just an incredibly,</p>
<p>just wonderful career that I&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>just so great grateful to have.</p>
<p>And a lot of times, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d look at like role models,</p>
<p>and I certainly grew up in the industry</p>
<p>looking at role models of like,</p>
<p>you either have one or you have the other.</p>
<p>And I consider, you know, it a blessing to have the kind</p>
<p>of close relationship I have with my two sons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like 13 and 15.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the love of my life.</p>
<p>I spend a ton of time with them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not quantity of the time that I spend with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the quality and the presence.</p>
<p>You know, if I spend 15 minutes with them at the end</p>
<p>of the day and they feel like they&rsquo;ve connected with me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>
<p>And doing that while having a challenging</p>
<p>and enriching career, that is what I mostly am grateful for.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I also like your real,</li>
</ul>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be at every soccer practice,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be at&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes, you know that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ll never forget driving my daughter,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>carpool&rsquo;s the best time, if you are parents</p>
<p>or gonna become parents, when you have kids in the car,</p>
<p>you hear everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I remember my daughter saying to her friend,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad my mom wasn&rsquo;t that mom,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, oh no, what&rsquo;s gonna come next.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was kind of quiet, and I&rsquo;m like, What mom?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She goes, not the mom that was, you know,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t need to be there at every dance, every chaperone,</p>
<p>(overlapping discussion)</p>
<p>I just wanted some space from you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, thank God.</p>
<p>Thank God that worked out well.</p>
<p>But I like the realistic advice versus the,</p>
<p>you have to be in every exactly practice.</p>
<p>We have people in the audience I have to pay attention to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, because I could just talk to her forever.</p>
<p>Who has questions, and there are, there&rsquo;s at least one mic.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s a mic right there in the middle.</p>
<p>So who would like to, and if you just,</p>
<p>before you ask a question, tell us your name,</p>
<p>and you know, who you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mic right back there if you can walk to the mic.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<ul>
<li>HI I&rsquo;m Simran.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a full-time MBA student and it&rsquo;s great to hear from you,</p>
<p>especially as an Indian woman.</p>
<p>I wanted to, I know you touched a little bit about it.</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when you found it difficult</p>
<p>to strike a work/life balance,</p>
<p>and as you moved across different roles,</p>
<p>especially when you became a VP or a manager</p>
<p>from an IC role?</p>
<p>How did you like strike that balance?</p>
<p>Was there a time when personal life</p>
<p>was more important than corporate?</p>
<p>So if you could talk a little bit more about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think this is a fantastic question,</li>
</ul>
<p>and certainly, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say, come here and say, Hey, it&rsquo;s been an easy ride.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>There are especially times in your life where, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deciding to expand your family, and you have like,</p>
<p>you know, kids under five, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very short lived phase.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I found.</p>
<p>Like when you go through, it&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>will the day ever end and will my list</p>
<p>of to-do items ever end?</p>
<p>And you know what, again, it&rsquo;s a very short period of time</p>
<p>and you are able to get through it.</p>
<p>The thing that I would say, you know,</p>
<p>this is a story I&rsquo;ll give you like, you know, I had,</p>
<p>I thought I was balancing everything really well,</p>
<p>and I went to a field trip when my kid was in second grade.</p>
<p>And that was the period that was exceptionally difficult,</p>
<p>trying to manage work as well as everything.</p>
<p>And you know, this was many years ago,</p>
<p>and I was doing a beautiful job.</p>
<p>It was the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>I had my phone, I was driving the kids on the field trip</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, I&rsquo;m balancing everything.</p>
<p>And I was on the phone the whole time.</p>
<p>And I like closed my, you know, cell phone</p>
<p>with a little of like my hair and everything,</p>
<p>and I came back in the evening, I was like,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that great, mom was there with you the whole time?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that fantastic?</p>
<p>And my son looks at me and says,</p>
<p>you were on the phone the whole time.</p>
<p>And that was such a gut-wrenching, you know,</p>
<p>moment where I&rsquo;m like, I am not balancing it.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m doing a great job balancing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not balancing it.</p>
<p>And so since then, I&rsquo;ve kind of really thought about,</p>
<p>instead of work/life balance, work/life presence,</p>
<p>you know, what does it take for me to be present, you know,</p>
<p>either at work fully or at home fully and how can I do that?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been key, and I set expectations</p>
<p>with my kids on that, I set expectations with my spouse,</p>
<p>and that has been really helpful.</p>
<p>I think the second part of it is to know that, especially,</p>
<p>you know, my husband also works in a very, you know,</p>
<p>crazy job where he doesn&rsquo;t have control of his time,</p>
<p>and we find that we have like an annual conversation</p>
<p>of when are, you know, going for your promotion,</p>
<p>when am I going for the promotion, and what is, you know,</p>
<p>what are we doing in terms of balancing all of those</p>
<p>and having a open conversation with your partner</p>
<p>and making sure it all works, that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And having the same conversation at work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to set very clear boundaries with, you know,</p>
<p>everybody that I work with.</p>
<p>On certain days, I&rsquo;m just not going to be there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to respond.</p>
<p>But you know, other days, I am available and I&rsquo;m available,</p>
<p>you know, when I&rsquo;m there at work.</p>
<p>And so it is hard.</p>
<p>The hardest parts are, you know,</p>
<p>early on in your career when you feel</p>
<p>like you have no control.</p>
<p>But that tends to be fairly short,</p>
<p>and then you are able to get to a place where you</p>
<p>can have presence and integrate, you know,</p>
<p>both family and life.</p>
<p>And you just have to stay true to the commitments</p>
<p>and look at how much you&rsquo;re taking on in a given year</p>
<p>and balance it with everybody around you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Simran] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, hello.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So my name is Isabella.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year undergraduate student,</p>
<p>studying computer science and business starting next year.</p>
<p>So thank you first off for being here.</p>
<p>This is one of my first instances of taking advantage</p>
<p>of what Haas has to offer,</p>
<p>so I think this is an excellent start.</p>
<p>My question, namely being a part of gen Z</p>
<p>and being a part of both the computer science</p>
<p>and the business community, I&rsquo;ve become more and more aware</p>
<p>of just how critical and focused and active people</p>
<p>of my generation are when it comes to civil liberties</p>
<p>and different issues that they are in fact passionate about,</p>
<p>and given the past two years and the rise</p>
<p>of employee activism within workspaces,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about how you in particular</p>
<p>or HubSpot in general is able to facilitate</p>
<p>these more individual, not just a general culture,</p>
<p>but individual conversations, where you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to straddle and hold space for difficult conversations</p>
<p>and allow this whole new workforce to truly bring</p>
<p>their full selves to the table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, first off, you&rsquo;re in a great place.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you have a long road ahead, which is fun, exciting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And honestly, I do think that this is a challenge</p>
<p>that not every company and the industry has fully embraced.</p>
<p>We love, you know, what the next generation,</p>
<p>gen Z as well as millennials bring,</p>
<p>and we want to create the space,</p>
<p>but it is not like an easy, you know, path.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say that especially the last three years</p>
<p>have shown us that, you know,</p>
<p>there is not this pure way in which a company</p>
<p>can just be focused on its objectives</p>
<p>without being part of the community</p>
<p>that we serve and the community that we are part of.</p>
<p>At HubSpot, we try to look at it in a couple</p>
<p>of different ways.</p>
<p>One is, you know, we are a very, very transparent culture,</p>
<p>and so we make space for managers and, you know,</p>
<p>the groups to have conversations</p>
<p>around whatever is happening,</p>
<p>and we really pay attention to that.</p>
<p>We have a number of ERGs, employee resource groups,</p>
<p>that also provide that kind of space.</p>
<p>And then when we think about the voice</p>
<p>that companies can have, there is a little bit of, you know,</p>
<p>what is happening in the world,</p>
<p>what makes really sense for HubSpot&rsquo;s customers,</p>
<p>and what makes sense for, you know,</p>
<p>the community that we operate in?</p>
<p>And there is an intersection of, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for the world,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for the community that we operate in,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s good for our customers?</p>
<p>And if there is a really good intersection there,</p>
<p>then we actually spent a lot more time driving initiatives,</p>
<p>talking about it, and having a conversation about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example, you know,</p>
<p>George Floyd and what, you know,</p>
<p>the black lives movement actually caused,</p>
<p>that was a really big thing that was happening</p>
<p>in our community, and our customers were absolutely impacted</p>
<p>and the world was impacted.</p>
<p>And because we care a lot about diversity,</p>
<p>we spoke about it, we put a plan and we, you know,</p>
<p>really accelerated our ability to hire black employees</p>
<p>and provide a space for them.</p>
<p>That was that intersection.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of things that our happening in the world.</p>
<p>There is environmental costs you can take,</p>
<p>there is war that is happening,</p>
<p>there is a whole bunch of laws that get passed,</p>
<p>voter rights that are happening.</p>
<p>And again, we look at, is it in that intersection</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s good for customers, what&rsquo;s good for the company,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for the community?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, then we choose to provide a space,</p>
<p>but not really take a stance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perfect,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how we look at the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Isabelle] Perfect, thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name is Ethan and I&rsquo;m in the undergraduate program,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I was wondering specifically,</p>
<p>it sounds like when you were tasked with stepping up,</p>
<p>following the accident, that it seemed like a very,</p>
<p>I guess sudden transition for,</p>
<p>and I think you were talking about in like your career,</p>
<p>how you like, I guess, like were able to reflect,</p>
<p>I guess, before you kind of made big transitions,</p>
<p>but this transition perhaps seemed to have</p>
<p>come out of nowhere, and I was wondering, number one,</p>
<p>like how did you navigate through that transition</p>
<p>that was like so sudden.</p>
<p>And also, I guess, just like what are some like lessons</p>
<p>and ways that you were able to make it like</p>
<p>a smooth process and you were able</p>
<p>to convey confidence in that process?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Kelly] Good questions, wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, thank you for the question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re definitely making me reflect a lot.</p>
<p>And you know, it is.</p>
<p>Every transition is different.</p>
<p>This one is certainly sudden.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, look, I think we&rsquo;ve lived now in a year,</p>
<p>you know, probably two or three years of constant change,</p>
<p>constant crisis, constant need for adaptability.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a model of leadership that</p>
<p>is happening right now which is very different from before.</p>
<p>The first thing for me to recognize</p>
<p>is that this is not something that I can control</p>
<p>or use power or authority to, you know, drive through that.</p>
<p>And so the first principle for me was not</p>
<p>about control or power,</p>
<p>but about humility and vulnerability,</p>
<p>and that was an important, you know,</p>
<p>part of that transition, is to say, look, you know,</p>
<p>I know what I know, I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>my very best every single day,</p>
<p>but this is a period of a lot of change.</p>
<p>And so really, humility and vulnerability instead</p>
<p>of kind of power and control,</p>
<p>which could have been a model that you,</p>
<p>you know, would&rsquo;ve adopted.</p>
<p>I think the second thing is really leaning in</p>
<p>on the leadership team.</p>
<p>This was not, and almost every transition,</p>
<p>you can look at who&rsquo;s around you and who&rsquo;s there to help.</p>
<p>And in this case of a very specific sudden transition,</p>
<p>you know, leaning around people, I don&rsquo;t need to become,</p>
<p>you know, a legal expert.</p>
<p>I can lean in on the general council.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to become a product expert.</p>
<p>I can lean in on our chief product officer.</p>
<p>And so knowing that there is a fantastic team</p>
<p>and making sure that we are, you know,</p>
<p>having conversations as a leadership team</p>
<p>rather than a team of leaders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;ve really spent a lot of time,</p>
<p>is how do you make sure that you get the most out</p>
<p>of a leadership team and help them not think</p>
<p>about themselves as a team of leaders.</p>
<p>And that has actually helped a lot during the transition.</p>
<p>And then, you know, mentally, it&rsquo;s almost like the first,</p>
<p>when it was an interim case, the transition was like,</p>
<p>oh, I am a caretaker here.</p>
<p>I need to make sure that everything runs on rails</p>
<p>and the strategy that we have set is going to get executed.</p>
<p>But then when I became like a permanent CEO,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m no longer a caretaker,</p>
<p>even though my job was exactly the same.</p>
<p>I was like no longer a caretaker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the architect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, really going to have to take this</p>
<p>to the next level.</p>
<p>And so there is a mental transition to make.</p>
<p>And so the reflection points are really helpful,</p>
<p>whether it is sudden or whether it is planned.</p>
<p>And you do need to, you know,</p>
<p>think about the pivots that you have to make</p>
<p>and think about what has gotten you there</p>
<p>and what will get you to the next level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a wonderful question.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ethan] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Yamini.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Great to see you.</p>
<p>I am for Farmina Phillips, MBA class of 2003.</p>
<p>Number one, congratulations on all of your career success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been amazing.</p>
<p>Congratulations also to HubSpot for its, you know,</p>
<p>its positive progress in improving its diversity,</p>
<p>equity and inclusion metrics.</p>
<p>So in a room of leaders and future leaders,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious what advice you have for us</p>
<p>to improve diversity, equity, inclusion numbers</p>
<p>in our own organizations and future careers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, Farmina, so nice to see you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We both joined and we were, we were in the first cohort,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just incredible to be back here.</p>
<p>Thank you for the question.</p>
<p>Look, I think, you know, it&rsquo;s a long journey</p>
<p>and every one of us, you know,</p>
<p>we really need to walk the walk.</p>
<p>A lot of organizations and companies, you know,</p>
<p>either look at diversity in a very short timeframe,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ll look at it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re promoting people and say,</p>
<p>do I have enough diversity right now?</p>
<p>And the answer is like, probably not.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t do things, you know,</p>
<p>two years back as you were bringing new leaders</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re helping them really develop</p>
<p>and coach and, you know, promote them,</p>
<p>then the results in terms of your promotion</p>
<p>is not going to look great.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d say like long term rather than just short term</p>
<p>in terms of diversity, building it into kind of the core</p>
<p>of everything that we all do within the organization,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s critical, and really, you know,</p>
<p>identifying where you&rsquo;re seeing progress</p>
<p>and where you&rsquo;re not seeing progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of numbers.</p>
<p>And I know, Kelly, you love data.</p>
<p>I think, you know, more we can actually bring data</p>
<p>into diversity initiatives to look at where are we today</p>
<p>in terms of hiring, where are we today</p>
<p>in terms of developing skillsets,</p>
<p>where are we in terms of promotion,</p>
<p>and how much have we retained and looking at it</p>
<p>at the team level and having some accountability metrics</p>
<p>that then, you know, drive behavior is really the way.</p>
<p>And then you have to recognize that it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take a little while and we have to keep, you know,</p>
<p>doing all of that.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, I&rsquo;d love to have</p>
<p>a longer conversation on this, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Farmina] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So would we, we have a lot of wonderful resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So Genevieve will be happy to tell you about those.</p>
<p>Can I just do one follow up and then I&rsquo;m gonna go back</p>
<p>to you because I do love data,</p>
<p>and when consult with companies, you know,</p>
<p>I just say I have a couple of conditions</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not interested in consulting.</p>
<p>One is collect the data, two, share the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me ask you a slightly different database question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m really thinking I&rsquo;m becoming part of the problem</p>
<p>by going in and continuously talking to companies about,</p>
<p>your company did not ask me to do this,</p>
<p>but many do, when I came to talk to your group,</p>
<p>give me the business case for investing in diversity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because nobody&rsquo;s ever asked me to come in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and give the business case for investing in white men.</p>
<p>So why am I doing that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean we&rsquo;re past that, we&rsquo;re past that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, you know, there is actually a time</p>
<p>we may actually pass the data as well to say</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need an ROI for diversity, you know,</p>
<p>and we should not be having conversations</p>
<p>about a business case for doing what needs to happen.</p>
<p>You know, we all have products or services</p>
<p>that we offer and those products and services</p>
<p>actually represent, you know, diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t have product leaders that are diverse,</p>
<p>how are you gonna serve customers that belong</p>
<p>in a very diverse community?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think like we need data for that at all.</p>
<p>I hope that fewer people ask you, Kelly,</p>
<p>for a business case on diversity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just past that.</p>
<ul>
<li>That depends.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I remember when you, Yamini asked,</p>
<p>not only is Yamini an investor in EE-GOW,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re so grateful for,</p>
<p>I know my team is right in the front,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also an investor in me and believe in my work.</p>
<p>And when you brought me in to speak to your leadership team</p>
<p>and we were going through what to, I said,</p>
<p>do you want me to focus on the business failure?</p>
<p>Like no, just get to the strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I love, that was just, that&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I do still get asked to give.</p>
<p>And I generally start with the white man</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re like, oh, we&rsquo;re sorry we asked you</p>
<p>to do this.</p>
<p>But I will give you, is this the case?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>(overlapping discussion)</p>
<p>Like also make sure you gimme, ask me the business case</p>
<p>for investing in white men,</p>
<p>because that seems like they have a part of the&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the conversation is all about the playbooks,</li>
</ul>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m glad what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>is like it&rsquo;s, in our case, it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>the playbook for hiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the playbook for belonging and retention and inclusion.</p>
<p>How do we make sure that we have great playbooks</p>
<p>and all of the leaders are really, you know, trained.</p>
<p>They have the vocabulary, they have the fluency</p>
<p>to be able to do it.</p>
<p>And I find that the manager level is really important,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where there is least enablement in organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The frozen middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, and because, you know, at the company level,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>like we have diversity goals, we&rsquo;ve published those goals.</p>
<p>And then we have started doing something</p>
<p>like stay interviews.</p>
<p>So instant of exit interviews, when people leave,</p>
<p>you ask them, why are you leaving,</p>
<p>and then we find things&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, I&rsquo;m out of the door.</p>
<p>We do stay interviews actually for BIPOC leaders.</p>
<p>We do them every six months and we ask them, what,</p>
<p>why would you continue to stay,</p>
<p>and hopefully you stay, and what would make you leave?</p>
<p>And we find a lot from those stay interviews.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I found is that</p>
<p>it really comes down to the managers.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, well, I like the fact that HubSpot</p>
<p>talks about culture and diversity,</p>
<p>and my everyday experience really depends on my manager.</p>
<p>If that manager is not able to create</p>
<p>an inclusive environment, then I&rsquo;m not going to be here.</p>
<p>And so it really comes to that.</p>
<p>So how do you enable that level of the organization</p>
<p>to be able to carry what your culture</p>
<p>and diversity really needs, you know, from the org.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s one of my lines:</li>
</ul>
<p>People leave people, not companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just hard for people to hear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, no, they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not leaving HubSpot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re leaving&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Yamini] Absolutely true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I like that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, no, actually actually on the topic of people,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good segue to my question.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for this.</p>
<p>My name is NEH-DAH.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a master&rsquo;s student at the policy school.</p>
<p>And I also work in tech policy.</p>
<p>My question, especially from maybe</p>
<p>an entrepreneurial standpoint,</p>
<p>how do you keep your employees happy and motivated</p>
<p>to go the extra mile, you know,</p>
<p>especially during the early stages of a startup</p>
<p>and when times get rough.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a challenge and it&rsquo;s been more</li>
</ul>
<p>of a challenge in the last two years than before.</p>
<p>How do you keep them happy, motivated,</p>
<p>and maybe productive, right, or, you know, driving impact?</p>
<p>And to us, it really comes down to culture.</p>
<p>And lot of times culture, you know,</p>
<p>gets talked about, values get talked about,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve now been in, you know,</p>
<p>different organizations all the way from startups</p>
<p>to very large organizations.</p>
<p>And in fact like most organizations will say,</p>
<p>Hey, we have a cultural code or we have a set of values.</p>
<p>Now the difference between organizations that really thrive</p>
<p>and maybe not is how much you live those cultural values,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the lived experience of the culture</p>
<p>that creates the right environment.</p>
<p>In the case of HubSpot, we have a cultural code</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically heart.</p>
<p>Heart is humility, empathy, adaptability,</p>
<p>remarkability and transparency.</p>
<p>Those are the five values.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t think there is anything special</p>
<p>about any of those five values,</p>
<p>but I do think what is different in what we try to do</p>
<p>is we try to live it.</p>
<p>And when you try to live it, it means that,</p>
<p>you know, at the top, you know, we have to be transparent.</p>
<p>And you know, if we talk about transparency as a value,</p>
<p>then we live that transparency as a value.</p>
<p>We share almost every detail,</p>
<p>every board meeting notes to our entire company,</p>
<p>and we expect them to uphold that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s at the top, but it&rsquo;s also celebrating everybody</p>
<p>within the organization that stand up for being empathetic</p>
<p>or are completely, you know, humble or adaptable,</p>
<p>and we celebrate that.</p>
<p>So you really need to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t, you know, ensure that you have happy,</p>
<p>motivated employees.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole making sure that when you hire,</p>
<p>you hire for the ability for someone to come</p>
<p>and live in your culture and add to your culture.</p>
<p>You know, we used to say culture fit.</p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;s culture add.</p>
<p>We wanna be able to have someone come and add to our culture</p>
<p>instead of fit within our culture,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And so if you identify with the cultural values</p>
<p>of an organization, then you&rsquo;ll be happy, because if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>if you feel unnatural, then you&rsquo;re kind of like not happy.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important part.</p>
<p>Motivation really comes down to impact.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is that people are motivated</p>
<p>when they know their work in a given week</p>
<p>or a given month or a given year directly impacts</p>
<p>where the organization is going.</p>
<p>And so to have really motivated employees,</p>
<p>you have to have clarity of strategy</p>
<p>and you have to have clarity of work</p>
<p>that really impacts that strategy.</p>
<p>And so in order to do that,</p>
<p>you really have to spend time as leaders.</p>
<p>And, you know, I said this at the beginning,</p>
<p>I do think that leadership job is to consume</p>
<p>a lot of uncertainty and transmit clarity.</p>
<p>And part of creating environment for impact is providing</p>
<p>that direct connection between work and, you know,</p>
<p>the strategic priorities of the company.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have time for one more.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I think you&rsquo;re in line.</p>
<p>Yep, we have one time for one more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Vanessa and I&rsquo;m a first year student</li>
</ul>
<p>in the undergraduate program.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for coming to speak with us today</p>
<p>and sharing such valuable advice and insights.</p>
<p>My question is, I was wondering,</p>
<p>what does a day in the life look like for you?</p>
<p>(speaking faintly)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for asking.</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Thank you for asking me.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it really depends.</p>
<p>You know, I do start early.</p>
<p>I was not, when I was in Berkeley and I was a student,</p>
<p>I was a night owl, never, you know, a morning person,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had to like shift,</p>
<p>especially because I&rsquo;m working for a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based in the east coast</p>
<p>. And so it starts pretty early and, you know,</p>
<p>unfortunately starts with my cell phone.</p>
<p>I wish I had like a better, you know,</p>
<p>answer for how I wake up and get, you know,</p>
<p>back into things.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like waking up with, you know,</p>
<p>stock market and, you know,</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal and New York Times</p>
<p>and really catching up there.</p>
<p>I do spend a lot of time data.</p>
<p>So, you know, I stay very, very close to the data</p>
<p>within the organization.</p>
<p>So typically we&rsquo;ll start with a whole bunch of, you know,</p>
<p>all the key important metrics for the organization.</p>
<p>And, you know, it really varies.</p>
<p>I do have somewhat of a rhythm of the business.</p>
<p>So Mondays is typically management days.</p>
<p>Tuesdays is customer days.</p>
<p>Thursdays is, you know, partner days.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, you know, some method to how</p>
<p>I spend the time.</p>
<p>And Fridays are thinking days, which is actually great.</p>
<p>My favorite is Friday because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have meetings back to back.</p>
<p>And so it really depends on the kind of day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really very, very much of a context switching</p>
<p>that needs to happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to, you know,</p>
<p>not let one meeting really spoil your entire day.</p>
<p>It could be a great meeting or it could</p>
<p>be a terrible meeting,</p>
<p>but you have to like context switch</p>
<p>and make sure that that does not, you know,</p>
<p>transfer to every single meeting within the day.</p>
<p>But mostly it&rsquo;s a long day of meetings</p>
<p>and making decisions and helping others make decisions</p>
<p>within that context of work.</p>
<p>And then evening, you know, is really with,</p>
<p>with my family.</p>
<p>I, you know, definitely, I think COVID</p>
<p>has actually made this easier,</p>
<p>but we are continuing this even</p>
<p>after the pandemic, sit down and have,</p>
<p>you know, conversation with the family.</p>
<p>And then I spend a lot of time reading,</p>
<p>you know, after that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a lot of context switching,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good when you have some method</p>
<p>to the madness there.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I like the context, switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just wanna stay here for another couple hours,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but actually are a CEO and so you have probably</p>
<p>some stuff to do.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>But just a few things.</p>
<p>I mean, I wrote down so much and I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>to go home and write it where I can actually read it.</p>
<p>But I really like the advice about being mindful</p>
<p>specifically when you&rsquo;re in transitions in careers.</p>
<p>I love your description of an individual contributor</p>
<p>as a sprinter&rsquo;s mindset and how you need to shift</p>
<p>that when you become a manager, a cross country coach.</p>
<p>I mean, I love analogies and visuals.</p>
<p>I really like individual contributors</p>
<p>trying to always have the answers,</p>
<p>whereas when you get into a management position,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to ask questions,</p>
<p>I absolutely love great leaders, our great learners,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna, it&rsquo;s just perfect.</p>
<p>Will you take a picture of us?</p>
<p>I can put it on Instagram.</p>
<p>I will attribute it to you, but it&rsquo;s such an awesome,</p>
<p>to go from being a know-all, because I think academia</p>
<p>can get a little bit into the know-it-all mentality,</p>
<p>to being a learn-it-all.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna also talk to my faculty colleagues,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna blame you.</p>
<p>And then finally I really like this concept</p>
<p>of work/life presence.</p>
<p>So Yamini, thank you.</p>
<p>I just feel like you&rsquo;re this beautiful beacon</p>
<p>of leadership light.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I really appreciate that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for investing EGA, and personally,</p>
<p>and for being what we&rsquo;re out here doing.</p>
<p>This is an equity fluent leader right here.</p>
<p>So just so beautiful to see what we talk about</p>
<p>actually personified in your leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh thank you for having me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have Defining Principles wine for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, wonderful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(speaking faintly)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This is for your students always,.</p>
<p>and just thank you for everything.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<p>(speaking faintly off mic)</p>
<ul>
<li>So thanks for being here</li>
</ul>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you at the next EGA event.</p>
<p>We really appreciate you showing up</p>
<p>and I know you don&rsquo;t wanna talk to me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna move and let you wanna talk to her.</p>
<p>(ambient chatter)</p>
