    <p>The following is a conversation with Jason Calacanis,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an entrepreneur, investor, author of Angel,</p>
<p>How to Invest in Technology Startups,</p>
<p>and as many people may know, he&rsquo;s a fun, brilliant,</p>
<p>long time podcast host of This Week in Startups,</p>
<p>and co host of the All In podcast</p>
<p>with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs, and David Friedberg,</p>
<p>who all happen to be poker buddies</p>
<p>and self proclaimed besties.</p>
<p>The result is always a great listen</p>
<p>due to both the love and the heated disagreements.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;ve been learning a lot</p>
<p>about real world finance in the past few months.</p>
<p>To give you a bit of context on the side,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve studied trading from an algorithmic trading perspective</p>
<p>as a machine learning and a game theory problem</p>
<p>off and on for a few years in undergrad and grad school.</p>
<p>I found the distributed complex system aspect of finance</p>
<p>and economics in general fascinating,</p>
<p>but now I find even more fascinating</p>
<p>the human side of the whole thing,</p>
<p>ideas of greed, power, freedom, and truth.</p>
<p>Wall Street bets, Robin Hood, and the whole beautiful mess</p>
<p>around this topic allows us to have great conversations</p>
<p>about human nature and the systems that underlie</p>
<p>the rise and fall of civilizations.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jason Kolokanis.</p>
<p>I have a million things to talk to you about,</p>
<p>but we do happen to be living through</p>
<p>what I would think of as a historic event</p>
<p>in terms of its impact, in terms of almost philosophically</p>
<p>thinking about the role of people</p>
<p>and how they can fight power</p>
<p>with this whole Wall Street bets and GameStop situation.</p>
<p>I was wondering, you&rsquo;ve covered in your amazing</p>
<p>all in podcast, you guys have been having</p>
<p>fascinating battles over this whole situation.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could tell maybe</p>
<p>from your perspective, as it&rsquo;s unrolling</p>
<p>the saga of Wall Street bets and GameStop,</p>
<p>what are some interesting insights</p>
<p>that you have about this whole set of events?</p>
<p>In full disclosure, I was an angel investor</p>
<p>in Robin Hood before they launched.</p>
<p>And when I met the founder, Vlad, and his partner,</p>
<p>you know, they pitched me at a bar,</p>
<p>not too far from where we are right now in Palo Alto,</p>
<p>called Antonio&rsquo;s Nut House.</p>
<p>And my friend Adeo, it&rsquo;s a really good story,</p>
<p>my friend Adeo had asked me to speak</p>
<p>at his founder&rsquo;s institute, which is kind of like</p>
<p>an accelerator for people who were thinking</p>
<p>about starting a company.</p>
<p>And so I gave a talk, and then he said,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s go to Antonio&rsquo;s Nut House</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll meet Elon for a drink.</p>
<p>And so Elon met us for a drink there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the divest of dive bars.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll take a beer and it will&hellip;</p>
<p>I love the image of all of this.</p>
<p>You hang out with Elon at a crappy bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is the worst bar in the peninsula.</p>
<p>Like just garbage on the floor, and like cheap beer,</p>
<p>and warm beer, and like you&rsquo;ll pick up your pint glass</p>
<p>and be lipstick on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>Classy.</p>
<p>Not your lipstick.</p>
<p>You understand, somebody else&rsquo;s lipstick.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re sitting there and Vlad walks up</p>
<p>with his partner and he says, you&rsquo;re Jason Calacanis.</p>
<p>And I said, tell me about your startup.</p>
<p>He said, how do you know I have a startup?</p>
<p>I said, you recognize me.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>And he goes, is that Elon Musk?</p>
<p>And I said, yes, Elon, come say hi.</p>
<p>And he came over and said, hi.</p>
<p>I said, tell me what you do.</p>
<p>He said, well, I&rsquo;m a quant.</p>
<p>I said, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>And he said, quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I know about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like you guys make algorithms</p>
<p>and then try to beat the market, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, so you&rsquo;re gonna pitch me on a startup</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna sell your algorithm to other people.</p>
<p>And if it was so good, why wouldn&rsquo;t you just use it yourself</p>
<p>and print money?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, yeah, no, no, that&rsquo;s not our business.</p>
<p>Our business is we&rsquo;re gonna create an app</p>
<p>to get millennials to trade stocks.</p>
<p>And he said, hmm, you do realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no retail investors anymore.</p>
<p>Like the dot com crash plus the 2008 financial crisis</p>
<p>eliminated any individual&rsquo;s belief</p>
<p>in participating in the stock market.</p>
<p>And he said, that&rsquo;s the opportunity.</p>
<p>I said, okay, I like it.</p>
<p>Tell me more.</p>
<p>He said, well, we&rsquo;re gonna get these millennials to trade.</p>
<p>I said, the same ones who live in their mom&rsquo;s basements</p>
<p>and take Uber and Lyft and are on their parents,</p>
<p>have no money, got screwed and went 250K into debt</p>
<p>for school and now can&rsquo;t get a job.</p>
<p>Those people?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, they have no interest in their future,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna trade stocks.</p>
<p>He said, yeah, that&rsquo;s the opportunity.</p>
<p>I was like, how are you gonna make money?</p>
<p>And he said, well, that&rsquo;s the best part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be free.</p>
<p>And I said, so your idea is to get a group of people</p>
<p>who have no interest in saving for their future</p>
<p>to trade and your business model is free.</p>
<p>And he said, yes.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Because in almost all cases, the crazy outlandish ideas</p>
<p>that nobody believes in are the ones</p>
<p>that have the greatest returns.</p>
<p>I mean, Uber, I introduced to about 25 investors</p>
<p>and three of us said yes.</p>
<p>So a full 12% of the community who saw that deal</p>
<p>decided to do it.</p>
<p>So your sense about this idea being good</p>
<p>had to do with the fact that this guy was just crazy</p>
<p>and ambitious and bold thinking,</p>
<p>or was it that there was something here</p>
<p>in allowing a much larger magnitude of people</p>
<p>to be able to be investors?</p>
<p>Yeah, the way to do really well as an angel investor</p>
<p>or just in technology or in life</p>
<p>is to not say what could go wrong,</p>
<p>but to say what could go right.</p>
<p>And then to just imagine for a moment,</p>
<p>if it does work, what would the world look like?</p>
<p>And so when Elon was investing in Tesla</p>
<p>and some other guys were running it</p>
<p>and he was trying to save the company,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t, is this gonna work?</p>
<p>It was almost positively not gonna work.</p>
<p>And he knew that, but if it does work,</p>
<p>what does the world look like?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>is not the chances of success,</p>
<p>but if it does succeed, what would that look like?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the world needs more people doing.</p>
<p>And so when you looked at Robinhood, it was like,</p>
<p>well, if he does succeed, what would the world look like?</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;ve seen what it looks like.</p>
<p>You have a generation who are so financially sophisticated</p>
<p>that they know how to do puts and calls</p>
<p>and shorts and research at a level</p>
<p>that dominated the hedge fund industry.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pause for a second.</p>
<p>These traders sitting there on a subreddit</p>
<p>in a discord server are able to do analysis and research</p>
<p>and then act in unison to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to beat in the Robinhood sense,</p>
<p>this group of sophisticated insiders</p>
<p>who have more access and more access to capital,</p>
<p>but we will figure out how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>And most things don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way the Wikipedia would ever work, except it did.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, how is this ever gonna work?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not paying anybody,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s both the largest corpus of an encyclopedia ever.</p>
<p>So I think Robinhood actually succeeded.</p>
<p>And then what we saw was this system</p>
<p>and a lot of the systems in our society,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the political system,</p>
<p>the constitution of the United States,</p>
<p>education, higher education, which you&rsquo;re involved in,</p>
<p>and then even the financial system,</p>
<p>we have not stress tested and stress tested it,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t actually know all the edge cases</p>
<p>and how it works.</p>
<p>So Trump was able to just really put this crazy stress test.</p>
<p>Is the democracy going to hold?</p>
<p>Are we gonna break this two or three,</p>
<p>200 someone year old experiment?</p>
<p>And then we looked at the financial markets</p>
<p>and it turns out there were more people shorting the stock</p>
<p>than stocks and shares were available.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m trying to uncover,</p>
<p>where can I see a list of people who have shorted the stock?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but we can tell you sort of how many every two weeks</p>
<p>or maybe twice a week, we can create a report.</p>
<p>Maybe we know.</p>
<p>I was surprised that nobody knows</p>
<p>the list of people who were shorted</p>
<p>and you guys are trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no transparency on a lot of these systems.</p>
<p>And if you call to try to short a stock,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;ll tell you on the phone,</p>
<p>let me see, I think I might know a guy</p>
<p>who has shares to loan out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, am I calling to try to find</p>
<p>like a 73 Mustang Grande in gold?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna call around, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t this be like on a ledger somewhere</p>
<p>and be completely transparent?</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re seeing those things.</p>
<p>And I think the investigations will make it super clear.</p>
<p>But of course, in a vacuum without information,</p>
<p>there are so many investors in these startups</p>
<p>that conflicts can start to appear.</p>
<p>And then you know how it is with people</p>
<p>in conspiracy theories, the mind starts to wander, right?</p>
<p>And so in some cases, there is actually a conspiracy.</p>
<p>And then in other cases, people&rsquo;s mind will fill in like,</p>
<p>oh my God, there&rsquo;s some grand conspiracy here.</p>
<p>I can tell you Robinhood&rsquo;s only goal</p>
<p>is to get more people to trade stocks</p>
<p>and to democratize it even more.</p>
<p>And they apparently were on the brink of seizing as an entity</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t get more money to cover all these trades.</p>
<p>I mean, they were on the brink</p>
<p>and they raised $3.5 billion or something like that</p>
<p>in a week.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in some sense, Robinhood enabled this very,</p>
<p>like the magic of this distributed system</p>
<p>of WallStreetBets, right?</p>
<p>You said Wikipedia, which is another,</p>
<p>which is probably one of my favorite websites</p>
<p>and one of my favorite examples of like a distributed system</p>
<p>somehow coming together in a way,</p>
<p>just like you said at that crappy bar,</p>
<p>I would have guessed it would never work.</p>
<p>But if it does work, it changes everything and it did.</p>
<p>And Robinhood in that same way probably enabled</p>
<p>or was one of the major enablers of WallStreetBets</p>
<p>of giving power, like empowering young kids to learn</p>
<p>about how this whole messy financial system works</p>
<p>and take on the big elite centralized players.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>When these companies get big,</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s changed is the footprint of these startups</p>
<p>and the velocity at which they grow.</p>
<p>So something like Airbnb is another perfect example</p>
<p>of something that should really not work in practice,</p>
<p>but it does.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna rent my couch or my extra room to somebody</p>
<p>like a serial killer,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna stay in somebody&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>like a serial killer&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it really sounds scary,</p>
<p>but it actually works and it has not destroyed</p>
<p>the hotel business.</p>
<p>It has added.</p>
<p>So the best startups induce a market to exist.</p>
<p>If you look at Uber or Airbnb, people replace their cars</p>
<p>and Uber was not competing ultimately with taxis.</p>
<p>They were competing with car ownership,</p>
<p>public transportation, walking, or just not going out.</p>
<p>And then you look at Airbnb,</p>
<p>a lot of people who stay in an Airbnb</p>
<p>would not be taking a trip to Kyoto,</p>
<p>if not for the fact that they could get a $75 beautiful room</p>
<p>with great reviews in Kyoto for three weeks.</p>
<p>It inspires people and it manifests the market</p>
<p>because the product is so transcendent, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that Robinhood did.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t learn how to do this options trading</p>
<p>and puts and calls and all this sophistication stuff,</p>
<p>unless you actually do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too hard to learn except in practice,</p>
<p>just like poker.</p>
<p>If you wanna learn how to play poker or guitar</p>
<p>or tennis or skiing, like you can talk about it.</p>
<p>You can watch YouTube videos,</p>
<p>but at a certain point, you gotta get on the mountain.</p>
<p>At a certain point, you gotta put some chips in the pot</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be painful.</p>
<p>Like poker is gonna be painful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna lose a lot of money</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you should play at the small tables first.</p>
<p>And even in trading, like you look at people</p>
<p>who are doing this crazy trading and GameStop,</p>
<p>a company that&rsquo;s worth maybe a couple of billion dollars,</p>
<p>but certainly not tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Of course, the people who are throwing their money in last</p>
<p>are gonna lose it.</p>
<p>I think everybody knew that.</p>
<p>And so it was a momentum play</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re betting against the hedge funds.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s good for people to learn</p>
<p>and become financially literate</p>
<p>and just always understand the concept of the risk of ruin.</p>
<p>The good news is for a young person,</p>
<p>the risk of ruin might be like they lose $5,000 or something</p>
<p>and then they have to build their stack back up.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really the only thing I am concerned about</p>
<p>is there are people who will play poker or blackjack</p>
<p>or sports betting or whatever it is and lose control.</p>
<p>Just like there might be people who try alcohol</p>
<p>and lose control.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t build a system based upon limiting</p>
<p>the average person&rsquo;s behavior based upon somebody</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t control their ability to drink.</p>
<p>Two glasses of wine instead of 20.</p>
<p>How does this whole thing end?</p>
<p>Probably in tears.</p>
<p>For who?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s crying?</p>
<p>Is everybody crying?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s crying when?</p>
<p>So I think there were some of the hedge funds</p>
<p>that were crying initially.</p>
<p>That maybe some of the Wall Street Bets people</p>
<p>who bought last would be crying.</p>
<p>And then eventually there&rsquo;s probably another set</p>
<p>of hedge funds or even the Wall Street Bets mob</p>
<p>and that army, some of them might&rsquo;ve broke ranks</p>
<p>and then shorted the stock.</p>
<p>So nobody knows.</p>
<p>So everybody has to be aware of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the game.</p>
<p>So if Wall Street Bets said, hey, let&rsquo;s squeeze</p>
<p>these hedge funds because they have too much short interest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all buy the stock.</p>
<p>Then some of them might&rsquo;ve said, okay,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s at two or $300.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll join the short movement now that they&rsquo;ve covered.</p>
<p>And they could have shorted their been like double agent.</p>
<p>So people have to understand like this stuff is gnarly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a free for all.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a literal free for all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of morality,</p>
<p>like a big statement that Wall Street Bets made</p>
<p>in terms of like the elites can&rsquo;t just push us around.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t bully around.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also interested in making money, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>You said that some of the people in the Wall Street Bets</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve broken off and shorted the stock.</p>
<p>Are they more interested?</p>
<p>There was an emergent like morality that emerged</p>
<p>and said like, we&rsquo;re not gonna put up</p>
<p>with the centralized elites,</p>
<p>but is that going to continue?</p>
<p>Are they going to fight the power structures</p>
<p>that are bad for society?</p>
<p>Or are they going to now like,</p>
<p>I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to damage the economy and damage the world?</p>
<p>Or are they going to continue being the good guys</p>
<p>and fighting the evils that manipulate the market?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>You know, it really feels like the Dark Knight series</p>
<p>of films where like some people</p>
<p>just want to see the world burn.</p>
<p>I think there is a contingent of people</p>
<p>who just literally want to see chaos.</p>
<p>Like, you know that contingent on some of these forums</p>
<p>who just want to create chaos, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly that chaos contingent,</p>
<p>but I think overall what the arc will show</p>
<p>is a group of people getting massively educated.</p>
<p>You see it in crypto as well.</p>
<p>There was like a three year period</p>
<p>where all of these failed entrepreneurs who I knew</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t build companies were then coming back to me</p>
<p>after their companies has failed or after they gave up</p>
<p>or couldn&rsquo;t clear market raising money</p>
<p>with the venture capital community</p>
<p>and they were doing ICOs.</p>
<p>And I was like, I met you before, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m doing an ICO now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, where&rsquo;s your company at?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, here&rsquo;s a white paper.</p>
<p>And I was like, this white paper with spelling errors in it</p>
<p>that says you&rsquo;re going to destroy Airbnb</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>is gonna be on an immutable ledger.</p>
<p>Like, wouldn&rsquo;t that be better in a regular database</p>
<p>that was private and not public?</p>
<p>Like, why does it need to be on an immutable ledger?</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, not changing the database is a feature?</p>
<p>That does not seem like a good feature.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, just people are interested in ICOs.</p>
<p>And there was that ICO mania.</p>
<p>And what it showed was there&rsquo;s a global appetite for risk.</p>
<p>People want to try new things.</p>
<p>This is one of the great things about the human spirit</p>
<p>is one of the great things about capitalism.</p>
<p>And one of the things that concerns me most</p>
<p>about where we&rsquo;re at in society</p>
<p>is the sort of socialism, communism,</p>
<p>entrepreneurship is bad, technology is bad,</p>
<p>and polarization of wealth,</p>
<p>and people getting rich is a bad thing.</p>
<p>When I grew up, I&rsquo;m 50 now,</p>
<p>but when I was a Gen Xer growing up,</p>
<p>we kind of maybe too much idolized Bill Gates</p>
<p>and people who were doing interesting things in the world.</p>
<p>And we thought capitalism was a force for good.</p>
<p>I still believe capitalism is a force for good</p>
<p>because when a group of people build a product or service</p>
<p>that changes the world and it gets globally distributed,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Tesla or SpaceX or Google or Airbnb</p>
<p>or Uber or Robinhood,</p>
<p>everybody gets to benefit from that product or service</p>
<p>having to compete.</p>
<p>And if you look at the places where there&rsquo;s no competition</p>
<p>like public education or less established colleges</p>
<p>and something like that,</p>
<p>less competition for accreditation degrees,</p>
<p>like things tend to get a little weird, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>And people tend to be protected and that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>You need competition.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that people shouldn&rsquo;t have global healthcare.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t have a safety net,</p>
<p>but we need to keep capitalism vibrant,</p>
<p>especially because China has now coopted capitalism</p>
<p>and created their own version of capitalism,</p>
<p>which is communism with capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this weird operating system</p>
<p>like we still want to keep communism</p>
<p>so we can take any of your gains at any time,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d like you to be entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>And then you have somebody like the founder of Alibaba,</p>
<p>Jack Ma, who disappears for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Jack Ma?</p>
<p>I was like, he kind of disappears for a couple of weeks</p>
<p>and then he comes back and he&rsquo;s really sorry</p>
<p>about the things he said and then he disappears again.</p>
<p>And like, we have to be very careful.</p>
<p>You know, we have to be very careful if China wins</p>
<p>capitalism, this is going to be an existential threat</p>
<p>for humanity.</p>
<p>The Chinese are no joke.</p>
<p>I mean, they are seriously focused</p>
<p>and they are picking the winners.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very weird system because it is in fact,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you call it.</p>
<p>Like communism and capitalism is such a overloaded terms,</p>
<p>but they do encourage entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>but they, and they do a good job of it.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re like the surveillance thing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re controlling things in a way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird because it seems to work really well for them</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s definitely got short term benefits.</p>
<p>So the question is like, how that gets distorted</p>
<p>and it becomes worse and worse and worse,</p>
<p>which it potentially might be.</p>
<p>And I think on, you know, the entrepreneurial spirit,</p>
<p>which you have a podcast all centered</p>
<p>around the entrepreneurial spirit,</p>
<p>is one of the magical things that makes this country great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if money is deeply tied into that.</p>
<p>I do get bothered by people, you know,</p>
<p>treating the word billionaires if it&rsquo;s a bad word.</p>
<p>But in general, like all the hard things,</p>
<p>all the difficult things we&rsquo;re going through in this country,</p>
<p>it seems like the way out is going to be</p>
<p>making the entrepreneur the hero of society</p>
<p>of like letting that young kid with a big dream</p>
<p>and the guts to take the big risks</p>
<p>and build something totally new,</p>
<p>giving them a chance and whatever that involves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about taxes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about like regulation, all that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about us and just public discourse saying</p>
<p>that kid, that guy, that girl, they&rsquo;re bad asses.</p>
<p>Like encourage them to do it.</p>
<p>We have to have people buy in</p>
<p>to the fact that they have that opportunity.</p>
<p>And I think one of the problems in society is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a group of people who actually don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that they can succeed or they don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>even more perniciously that other people can.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the group of people that I think are highly vocal</p>
<p>but a small group of people,</p>
<p>which are generally people of incredible privilege,</p>
<p>rich parents, white city dwellers, liberals.</p>
<p>They kind of look and say,</p>
<p>poor people cannot change it a lot.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re battling in their minds</p>
<p>to protect poor people.</p>
<p>But they have this very weird</p>
<p>patriarchal kind of approach to it,</p>
<p>which is they think that they&rsquo;re not capable</p>
<p>of changing their lot in life.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>And then once in a while, I&rsquo;ll tweet something where I say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really incredible that every piece of knowledge</p>
<p>you could possibly want is now available for free on YouTube.</p>
<p>And every course from MIT and Harvard and Stanford</p>
<p>is available on edX or Coursera.</p>
<p>And all that information is there freely available.</p>
<p>And you can take the lectures.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>And then people will be like,</p>
<p>yeah, but people don&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the link.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, but they don&rsquo;t have internet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, here&rsquo;s the chart</p>
<p>of internet penetration in America.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, poor people don&rsquo;t have internet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>Find me any downtrodden person without a smartphone</p>
<p>with a high speed connection</p>
<p>that capitalism provided for $12 a month or $15 a month.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to find that.</p>
<p>And we have it so well in this country</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much opportunity,</p>
<p>but people don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually one of the problems.</p>
<p>See, the average American still watches</p>
<p>four or five hours of television a day.</p>
<p>And often I meet people and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I need a technical co founder.</p>
<p>But all I need is a million dollars.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, well, what is your skill?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have a skill.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, are you a designer?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you a product manager?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you a developer?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you a sales executive?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you have an idea?</p>
<p>Well, as my friend, Sam Harris,</p>
<p>I think your friend as well says like,</p>
<p>everybody has like a million ideas an hour.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t really get credit for those.</p>
<p>Even when you&rsquo;re asleep, your idea is spewing ideas.</p>
<p>Like zero credit for your ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about execution.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>You have to believe that you yourself</p>
<p>can be the core of that execution.</p>
<p>You yourself can build the thing in every,</p>
<p>no matter what your circumstances are.</p>
<p>I mean, we could talk about like structural racism</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things that push things down.</p>
<p>But from the individual perspective,</p>
<p>when you just like are coaching</p>
<p>or giving advice to an individual,</p>
<p>you can literally change the world.</p>
<p>I mean, Wall Street Bets is an indication of that</p>
<p>in the financial space that you yourself can have,</p>
<p>can change the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this country is amazing.</p>
<p>Still the best country in the world, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it still is amazing the opportunity</p>
<p>provided to people.</p>
<p>All this educational experience is online.</p>
<p>And the ability, what I tell young people</p>
<p>who are looking for advice, I say,</p>
<p>the skill you need to refine</p>
<p>is the ability to learn new skills.</p>
<p>Like if you become good at learning a new skill,</p>
<p>and Tim Ferriss, a friend of mine has really pioneered this,</p>
<p>he can get to 60 or 70% of like the knowledge</p>
<p>in a skill in some incredibly short period of time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s gonna become a virtuoso drummer</p>
<p>or a great basketball player,</p>
<p>but Tim and I were on vacation together</p>
<p>in like a group vacation in Italy</p>
<p>and there was a basketball court.</p>
<p>And I said, let&rsquo;s go shoot some hoops.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never shot before.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, come on, I&rsquo;ll teach you.</p>
<p>And Tim is fabulously uncoordinated.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>Like he tried to dribble a basketball and do a layup</p>
<p>and it looked like he had a blindfold on.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve never seen something less elegant</p>
<p>than Tim Ferriss doing a layup in basketball.</p>
<p>And then he watched me do it three or four times</p>
<p>and I watched him study me.</p>
<p>And listen, I&rsquo;ve been playing basketball in Brooklyn</p>
<p>since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I got a couple of moves and he was just taking notes</p>
<p>and taking notes and taking notes.</p>
<p>And by the end of a couple of hours of doing this,</p>
<p>I could just watch him checking his form</p>
<p>and figuring it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s every skill in the world now.</p>
<p>And what I tell people is like, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>did you watch Game of Thrones?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah.</p>
<p>Watch Breaking Bad?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I&rsquo;m like, okay, that&rsquo;s about 400 hours.</p>
<p>How about you don&rsquo;t watch the next two</p>
<p>and you put that 400 hours into learning</p>
<p>how to be a graphic designer, a UX person,</p>
<p>a developer, whatever it is and learn how to add skills.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did my whole life.</p>
<p>I was a kid from Brooklyn, went to school at night,</p>
<p>but I was very quick to get to maybe 50%</p>
<p>of the knowledge base of graphic design</p>
<p>or being a writer or being a sales executive,</p>
<p>whatever it was, a developer even.</p>
<p>And I was just good enough to not have people</p>
<p>be able to bullshit me like when I hired them.</p>
<p>And that was a big unlock.</p>
<p>When you know enough that people can&rsquo;t snow you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>And look at yourself.</p>
<p>You figured out how to set up an entire podcast,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have a team around you.</p>
<p>I have a team of like five, six people working on my podcast.</p>
<p>With even knowing enough about to set this up,</p>
<p>you would then be able to hire a team.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be able to call them on their bullshit</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not doing a good job.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that much about this whole thing,</p>
<p>but I know enough to be able to then see</p>
<p>who knows their stuff and not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And the process of learning how to learn</p>
<p>is essential there because I did martial arts,</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so funny to watch.</p>
<p>I did Taekwondo, yeah.</p>
<p>Taekwondo is awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>that do an activity for years,</p>
<p>because just sort of elaborate on something</p>
<p>you were saying about hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the amount of hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the quality that you put in.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice versus just doing some behavior.</p>
<p>I mean, literally I&rsquo;ve been playing chess</p>
<p>and trying to get that going again</p>
<p>after watching Queen&rsquo;s Gambit and I got chess.com.</p>
<p>And I realized I was just playing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not getting better.</p>
<p>And then I was like, oh wait,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little analysis feature here in chess.com</p>
<p>where it will show you your blunders and mistakes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m spending no time</p>
<p>reviewing my losses in chess</p>
<p>and I just wanna play the next game.</p>
<p>I should really review these losses</p>
<p>and figure out what mistakes I made.</p>
<p>And when I started doing that,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, I&rsquo;m getting better.</p>
<p>So some deliberate practice really works.</p>
<p>And if you wanna take it all the way,</p>
<p>Magnus Carlsen, shout out to the guy,</p>
<p>he has an app, but there&rsquo;s a few other coaching apps</p>
<p>where you focus on the end game,</p>
<p>you focus drilling a particular,</p>
<p>you basically don&rsquo;t play the game at all.</p>
<p>You just focus on drilling the different aspects.</p>
<p>The openings, the end game, the end game, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different kinds of puzzles.</p>
<p>So you can really make it into a deliberate practice.</p>
<p>Not to make this episode sponsored by chess.com,</p>
<p>but they literally have puzzles.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh, and it&rsquo;s $100 a year for this product.</p>
<p>And I just thought to myself, this is capitalism.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to charge you $100 an hour for a lesson.</p>
<p>They can charge you $100</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve created the ability for you to play chess</p>
<p>24 hours a day against opponents</p>
<p>who are perfectly matched against you based on your rating.</p>
<p>And they analyze every game and they have puzzles</p>
<p>and they have tutorials and they&rsquo;ve got everything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, just think about how much value</p>
<p>is being provided to society because of capitalism</p>
<p>and because competition.</p>
<p>If you want things to get better</p>
<p>and you wanna step up your game,</p>
<p>just make it slightly competitive.</p>
<p>It is one of these things in human existence</p>
<p>that is so powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, did you see the Michael Jordan documentary,</p>
<p>The Last Dance?</p>
<p>Like half of it, I&rsquo;m still working through it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so competitive and petty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so inspiring that all he cares about is just winning</p>
<p>to the level of which he literally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this running meme, I took that personally</p>
<p>and I took that person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the images of him</p>
<p>sitting smoking a cigar,</p>
<p>looking at like an iPad or a video clip</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, I took that personally.</p>
<p>And you can make a super cut</p>
<p>of every time he took something personally,</p>
<p>he literally takes everything personally</p>
<p>to give himself that competitive motivation to win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s capitalism.</p>
<p>And when people are competing,</p>
<p>man, look at what Elon did to the space of cars.</p>
<p>Like every, they were literally laughing at him</p>
<p>in the first 10 years.</p>
<p>Electric cars, ha ha, that company will go out of business.</p>
<p>And now every single company is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going fully electric by 2035.</p>
<p>And he kicked their asses so brutally</p>
<p>that they had no choice but then to step up their game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we want, right?</p>
<p>And this virus and this pandemic,</p>
<p>I think the great thing that will come out</p>
<p>of this horrible experience that we&rsquo;ve all had</p>
<p>is psychologically death, learning,</p>
<p>just so many bad things occurred,</p>
<p>the economy, people losing their jobs.</p>
<p>But we also got to see the human spirit</p>
<p>with these mRNA vaccines and just how,</p>
<p>if we took out some of the regulation</p>
<p>and people were super motivated,</p>
<p>we might actually be able to eliminate</p>
<p>all pandemics from ever happening again.</p>
<p>And before that, Bill Gates was banging his fist</p>
<p>and Jeff Skoll was doing the movie Contagion.</p>
<p>I mean, for two decades, people have been banging their fist.</p>
<p>We have to be prepared for this.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, yeah, whatever, YOLO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s happened and people are like,</p>
<p>we need to be able to destroy every pandemic and virus</p>
<p>before it happens.</p>
<p>And listen, you know a lot more about science than I do,</p>
<p>but these mRNA has been around for a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just never gotten aggressive about doing it.</p>
<p>And then you think about challenge trials.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been following this,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re doing challenge trials now in the UK this month</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re introducing COVID into healthy young patients</p>
<p>and then giving them the vaccine or, you know.</p>
<p>And that is against all rules and regulations</p>
<p>about do no harm.</p>
<p>But then you think about it.</p>
<p>We kind of celebrate people jumping out of planes</p>
<p>and we got that one guy, Alex Honnold,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s climbing up mountains without a rope</p>
<p>and they give him a North Star, you know,</p>
<p>back page ad and an endorsement deal.</p>
<p>And we celebrate that.</p>
<p>We celebrate people surfing with sharks.</p>
<p>We celebrate people doing deep welding.</p>
<p>We pay them extra to go 200 feet underground</p>
<p>and weld stuff.</p>
<p>And people do dangerous stuff all day long, astronauts.</p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t, soldiers, firefighters,</p>
<p>but we won&rsquo;t let people get paid to do a challenge trial.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re weirdly risk averse in certain areas</p>
<p>that completely don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And this is where the world needs it.</p>
<p>We could have said these thousand people, young people,</p>
<p>who we know are in all likelihood</p>
<p>not going to have a bad outcome,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly lower than riding a motorcycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lower than riding a motorcycle.</p>
<p>People ride motorcycles everywhere.</p>
<p>We have ads for motorcycles.</p>
<p>We could have just said to those thousand people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you a million dollars each to do this.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s your billion dollars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re printing trillions of dollars of money</p>
<p>to deal with this.</p>
<p>If we had just done a thousand people</p>
<p>for a million dollars each to do a challenge trial</p>
<p>in March, April, May, when they had the mRNA vaccines ready,</p>
<p>we could have deployed the vaccines in the summer.</p>
<p>We would have been done with this.</p>
<p>We would have been over by now.</p>
<p>So we get to challenge all of that thinking.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what the great pause did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s letting everybody challenge that thinking is,</p>
<p>why do we have that rule?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, we don&rsquo;t want to have people,</p>
<p>you know, like give up their organs for money.</p>
<p>Like we obviously understand,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a reasonable discussion about,</p>
<p>well, maybe there&rsquo;s a level of risk in a global pandemic.</p>
<p>I mean, we fought the Nazis, right?</p>
<p>We defeated the Nazis.</p>
<p>That took a lot of deaths to do that,</p>
<p>but we had to kill that evil.</p>
<p>This is another evil, which we must fight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to result in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already resulting in thousands of people dying a day,</p>
<p>but we could have actually stopped it earlier</p>
<p>if we just had a reasonable discussion.</p>
<p>This is why podcasting is our respect what you do.</p>
<p>This is why intelligent people are so drawn to podcasts</p>
<p>because you and I can expand on this</p>
<p>and not cancel each other over this very suggestion.</p>
<p>When I make this suggestion,</p>
<p>are challenge trials reasonable or not?</p>
<p>If I were to do that on Twitter, they&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>oh, Calacanis wants to give poor people coronavirus</p>
<p>in order to save rich people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>But you and I could have a reasonable discussion</p>
<p>about a challenge trial is something we should consider</p>
<p>in a acute situation</p>
<p>where millions of people are going to lose their lives.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>of capitalism competition working really well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one of the, to me, sad thing to see</p>
<p>about coronavirus is that, for example,</p>
<p>testing at scale should have, it seems obvious.</p>
<p>I was a little clueless about it,</p>
<p>but because I thought there&rsquo;s no way you can have</p>
<p>like antigen tests at hundreds of millions,</p>
<p>like order hundreds of millions of them and make them cheap.</p>
<p>But actually I realized recently</p>
<p>that there have been available since about like May.</p>
<p>Yeah. You were able to.</p>
<p>In Korea, in Finland, all over the place.</p>
<p>You could have done mass manufacture.</p>
<p>So there, there&rsquo;s a little bit of a failure</p>
<p>of capitalism to step up.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you agree with this,</p>
<p>but it seems that the blame is to be placed</p>
<p>at the regulators and the various institutions.</p>
<p>Chrony capitalism in all likelihood</p>
<p>is what stopped it here in America.</p>
<p>I mean, I had friends who had imported them</p>
<p>from other countries, the testing kits.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve probably been to parties</p>
<p>where people had these kinds of testing kits</p>
<p>from other countries and we&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just approving them now.</p>
<p>Really, in February, month 11 of the pandemic in America,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have testing online, really.</p>
<p>I mean, even if these tests were 80% effective</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re 95% effective, mass producing them,</p>
<p>we should have sent them in every postal,</p>
<p>anybody with a post office box with a mailing address</p>
<p>should have had 10 of them put in their mailing address</p>
<p>just for free from the government.</p>
<p>And then everybody would be testing</p>
<p>and we would have contained it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have test and trace here in the United States.</p>
<p>Well, all the countries that are on the other side of COVID</p>
<p>did it by having testing, tracing</p>
<p>and closing their borders and masks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the combination that works.</p>
<p>The problem with the coronavirus</p>
<p>is while there&rsquo;s a lot of institutions</p>
<p>did not behave their best,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the case that there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>So I tend to give a little bit of a pass</p>
<p>to everybody involved for the uncertainty.</p>
<p>We were all.</p>
<p>I give them that until June.</p>
<p>I wonder how history will remember this whole period.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to ask you,</p>
<p>because you were an early investor in Robinhoods</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a very nice place</p>
<p>of being a huge supporter of the sort of Wall Street bets</p>
<p>kind of distributed power of the people.</p>
<p>And at the same time, because of you being an investor,</p>
<p>like intellectually giving a chance to Robinhood</p>
<p>in this kind of chaotic time of conversations</p>
<p>to think about like, well, what did they do right?</p>
<p>What did they do wrong?</p>
<p>So you have a kind of a balance view on the whole thing,</p>
<p>which is really nice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about what Robinhood did right, I think.</p>
<p>Can you sort of steel man at your mouth&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>of what Robinhood did wrong in the last few days?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, communication is always</p>
<p>the number one issue with these startups, right?</p>
<p>And if you, you have to get ahead of any problem</p>
<p>and you have to put all the bad news out immediately.</p>
<p>And in the case of Robinhood, it seems based on</p>
<p>what has been in the papers and what Robinhood said publicly</p>
<p>is that they had this kind of liquidity crisis, right?</p>
<p>Where they were being, because of these exchanges telling</p>
<p>them you have to put up this amount of money in collateral</p>
<p>and them being pinned at number one in the app store.</p>
<p>There were so many people trying to buy five shares</p>
<p>of this stock, five shares of this meme stock</p>
<p>that it kind of broke their system.</p>
<p>And then the people who clear the trades for them,</p>
<p>they said, you gotta put up a billion dollars,</p>
<p>two billion dollars, three billion dollars.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do that overnight.</p>
<p>And I think that they were in an uncomfortable situation</p>
<p>of like going on TV and saying, we have a liquidity crisis.</p>
<p>Like that could be like a run on the bag.</p>
<p>Everybody then logs in at the same time to Robinhood</p>
<p>and tries to sell every share they own</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid that the whole thing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna collapse, right?</p>
<p>So I think there was this kind of like black swan event</p>
<p>and they probably didn&rsquo;t communicate it all that well.</p>
<p>At the center of that, this is really interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on the nature of communication.</p>
<p>Vlad, the CEO, the guy you met at the bar,</p>
<p>was I think at the center of the communication, right?</p>
<p>So Elon is an example of a guy who also is</p>
<p>at the center of the communication</p>
<p>for his particular set of companies.</p>
<p>And that on Twitter seems to be a really powerful way</p>
<p>to communicate.</p>
<p>And there was something, this is me saying it,</p>
<p>there was something about Vlad that sounded</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s hiding stuff.</p>
<p>As opposed to Elon, it doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s hiding stuff.</p>
<p>It could be the nature, the beat,</p>
<p>the timing of the conversation.</p>
<p>Same thing with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg for some reason often sounds</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s hiding something.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like Jack Dorsey is much less so.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is about the CEOs</p>
<p>that makes you trust them and not.</p>
<p>Might be the point in time, like in terms of escape velocity.</p>
<p>There might be nondisclosures in place</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not aware of where they&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to talk about certain relationships.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And that results like in Vlad&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>and that results in you being like acting weird and nervous.</p>
<p>Or nervous.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could just be the person is nervous.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hard to be building one of these companies</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re at scale and oh my Lord,</p>
<p>the entire thing&rsquo;s coming apart</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the most hated person for that day.</p>
<p>You know how the rage cycle works</p>
<p>and the media is just so crazy</p>
<p>when they get their hooks into something.</p>
<p>I saw it happen with Uber.</p>
<p>We saw it happen with Facebook and even Tesla.</p>
<p>There were times when people did stupid things</p>
<p>with autopilot and it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>somebody is watching a movie and sleeping in their car</p>
<p>or leaving the driver&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>against all the rules of autopilot</p>
<p>and somehow Tesla&rsquo;s responsible for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we have people who stand on top</p>
<p>of their motorcycles and drive down the road</p>
<p>on a motorcycle.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t blame Yamaha or Harley Davidson</p>
<p>for some idiot standing on the seat of their motorcycle</p>
<p>on a highway going 60 miles an hour.</p>
<p>We just say, that person&rsquo;s an idiot.</p>
<p>But when new technology comes out,</p>
<p>we blame the technology, not the person operating it.</p>
<p>And if you are going to operate,</p>
<p>we basically vilify it and demonize it.</p>
<p>I think that is part of it.</p>
<p>Like when the person at, I remember Airbnb,</p>
<p>we always thought, what if somebody trashes your apartment?</p>
<p>And then sure enough, a bunch of meth heads</p>
<p>rented this poor woman&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>She left all of her stuff in it.</p>
<p>And then a bunch of meth heads had a drug party,</p>
<p>destroyed her apartment, ripped up all her photos</p>
<p>and went crazy.</p>
<p>And we knew that day would happen,</p>
<p>but nobody remembers it now.</p>
<p>But it was the number one story on every news channel</p>
<p>because wow, that&rsquo;s an exciting story.</p>
<p>And I just thought to myself,</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms</p>
<p>where the hotel room is being trashed</p>
<p>and people are doing drugs and crazy things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, that&rsquo;s basically every hotel</p>
<p>in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed</p>
<p>by some rock band that&rsquo;s throwing a TV out the window.</p>
<p>Like we expected in a hotel,</p>
<p>we just didn&rsquo;t expect it in somebody&rsquo;s house with Airbnb.</p>
<p>And then Airbnb created rules around,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t rent an Airbnb for a party and they learn.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a learning curve with these companies</p>
<p>and they do get to scale at a level</p>
<p>that is unprecedented.</p>
<p>It used to take decades for a company</p>
<p>to become an international phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now it happens in two, three, four years.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Clubhouse.</p>
<p>This thing went from being a private beta six months ago</p>
<p>to being the number one app in Germany</p>
<p>and in Japan and here.</p>
<p>Like just like that, boom.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s an ecosystem</p>
<p>that has never existed, the app store.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s payments online.</p>
<p>And then everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket.</p>
<p>The thing people got wrong</p>
<p>about entrepreneurship technology and business</p>
<p>over the last couple of decades</p>
<p>was just how big the market was</p>
<p>and then how quickly you could achieve relevancy</p>
<p>in these markets.</p>
<p>We thought the market was like the 60 million homes</p>
<p>were broadband.</p>
<p>And originally it was like maybe 10 or 20.</p>
<p>Then it became 60 million.</p>
<p>Then it was like, okay,</p>
<p>well, how many hours are you at your desktop computer?</p>
<p>Well, like probably at our computers for five hours a day,</p>
<p>10 hours a day at work, three hours a day on our own.</p>
<p>And then it was like,</p>
<p>yeah, nobody&rsquo;s on their desktop computer.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s on their mobile phone.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, they have it with them.</p>
<p>So the people with mobile phones</p>
<p>are now using this high speed device with an app store</p>
<p>with their credit card in it.</p>
<p>In the early days of the internet,</p>
<p>people were scared to put their credit card on the internet.</p>
<p>That was considered a really dumb thing to do.</p>
<p>If you put your credit card on the internet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna lose all your money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna hack you or whatever.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s just amazing to me</p>
<p>how quickly when a company hits,</p>
<p>how quickly it can get to a million subscribers</p>
<p>or 10 million or a billion users, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these networks, like social networks</p>
<p>that allow the spread of the viral spread</p>
<p>of like a new startup, a new company, a new app</p>
<p>to be announced.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>An idea, a podcast, right?</p>
<p>A single thing, a single meme could change the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of Clubhouse, I just wanna,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying so many interesting things,</p>
<p>but there was a magical moment with Vlad and Elon</p>
<p>on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you got that.</p>
<p>That was wild.</p>
<p>Yes, is there, do you have thoughts about that interaction</p>
<p>which felt like so many aspects of this whole situation</p>
<p>feels like totally novel, surreal,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s defining a new era.</p>
<p>It is, yes.</p>
<p>Like a billionaire, the richest human on earth</p>
<p>is interviewing the person at the center</p>
<p>of one of the most interesting mass scale</p>
<p>like power battles in finance ever, perhaps.</p>
<p>And by the way, seven movies have been sold two weeks.</p>
<p>Just think about how fast things are moving, Lex.</p>
<p>This thing happens.</p>
<p>Like people had the idea to short the stock six months ago.</p>
<p>They start doing their research.</p>
<p>They build an army.</p>
<p>They execute the trade.</p>
<p>The system goes down.</p>
<p>Robinhood raises $3.5 billion in four days.</p>
<p>Elon is interviewing them on Clubhouse on Sunday</p>
<p>after the Wednesday it happened.</p>
<p>And now here we are, it&rsquo;s 10 days later.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it feel like it&rsquo;s been 10 months?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 10 days, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 10 days.</p>
<p>10 days.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s like a new president,</p>
<p>all these things, and everyone forgot.</p>
<p>Oh, and there was an insurrection.</p>
<p>By the way, we also almost had a revolution at the Capitol</p>
<p>where a bunch of crazy people who have guns</p>
<p>and body armor, and then a bunch of them</p>
<p>who are just yoloing in cosplay, took over the Capitol.</p>
<p>Well, so, and the other more dramatic thing to me is.</p>
<p>That was one month ago.</p>
<p>That was one month.</p>
<p>And the president of the United States got banned</p>
<p>from every major social network,</p>
<p>and which I think I&rsquo;m still deeply troubled by</p>
<p>is Parler being removed from AWS.</p>
<p>That changed the way, that changed a lot of things.</p>
<p>As somebody who&rsquo;s an aspiring entrepreneur,</p>
<p>that changed the way I see the world.</p>
<p>That little, maybe I&rsquo;m being over dramatic, but.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re paranoid for a reason.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paranoid for a very good reason,</p>
<p>which is as big as these companies can become,</p>
<p>they are beholden to the mob.</p>
<p>And if the mob says, hey, this person needs to be canceled,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to get canceled</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t lose your entire audience.</p>
<p>You could lose your whole customer base,</p>
<p>and you could lose all your employees.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s interesting about your fear</p>
<p>about Parler and AWS taking off</p>
<p>is we went from being like a social network,</p>
<p>which is the software layer.</p>
<p>And then we went to like the infrastructure layer,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll even go after like Cloudflare,</p>
<p>which is a CDN provider, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like a plumbing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like sort of like the telephone.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically holding everybody responsible</p>
<p>on the whole chain of events here.</p>
<p>And what that&rsquo;s going to do is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge believer in crypto,</p>
<p>but distributed computing,</p>
<p>where nobody in decentralized</p>
<p>and distributed computing platforms and open standards,</p>
<p>podcasting is an open standard,</p>
<p>the web is an open standard, FTP was an open standard,</p>
<p>but Twitter and Facebook are closed.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going to happen is we will see</p>
<p>a group of individuals create peer to peer networks</p>
<p>for social media, where nobody can control it.</p>
<p>And the same for cloud computing,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a crypto project where everybody will,</p>
<p>and I invested in a company that tried to do this</p>
<p>and got sold and it didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>but take your hard drive on your computer at home,</p>
<p>you give a terabyte of your 10 terabyte drive</p>
<p>over to the cloud,</p>
<p>and then everybody else does their terabyte.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got this virtual cloud</p>
<p>and anybody can store stuff on it and it&rsquo;s all encrypted,</p>
<p>and then nobody can stop it.</p>
<p>And that could be tweets, it could be videos.</p>
<p>And so this idea that YouTube will be able to tell people,</p>
<p>to kick people off because they&rsquo;re skeptics of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the pandemic or the vaccine,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve, they&rsquo;ll make things</p>
<p>that are more censorship resistant.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll be the reaction to all of this.</p>
<p>This is my question for you,</p>
<p>going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you,</p>
<p>is there, like with Clubhouse, do you see competitors,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that another,</p>
<p>perhaps more decentralized or another kind</p>
<p>of social media will emerge</p>
<p>that will take on Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>and might be able to replace them?</p>
<p>If you look at the whole landscape with Clubhouse</p>
<p>and everything else,</p>
<p>do you think some other company might emerge?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be 10 versions of Clubhouse.</p>
<p>We looked at social networking.</p>
<p>We thought Friendster was it.</p>
<p>Like Friendster was so good,</p>
<p>nobody would be able to compete with that.</p>
<p>It was growing so quickly.</p>
<p>And then MySpace was a juggernaut</p>
<p>and they hit a hundred million in revenue</p>
<p>and a hundred million users.</p>
<p>And it was like, well, that&rsquo;s game over.</p>
<p>And then Facebook and LinkedIn and Snapchat</p>
<p>and FriendFeed and countless others.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s usually 20 people who will win in a category</p>
<p>and 80% of the category will be owned</p>
<p>by the top two or three players.</p>
<p>But will those players change, do you think?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of that?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, if Facebook hadn&rsquo;t bought Instagram,</p>
<p>it would be a company in decline right now.</p>
<p>People would be shorting the stock, right?</p>
<p>Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down</p>
<p>and Instagram saved them and WhatsApp saved them.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s another kind of weird moment</p>
<p>in history that they were able to accumulate</p>
<p>that much power and consolidate that much power.</p>
<p>Instagram should have never sold to them.</p>
<p>That should have gone public.</p>
<p>They had just raised money from Sequoia</p>
<p>and they had raised $50 million at a $500 million valuation</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t need to sell.</p>
<p>And that was a big mistake to sell.</p>
<p>They should have kept going</p>
<p>and they should have took on Facebook.</p>
<p>And if Instagram was a standalone company right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be worth 500 million, 500 billion, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think Facebook might buy Clubhouse has been?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ll probably copy it.</p>
<p>I mean, Zuckerberg has no moral compass</p>
<p>or ethics or anything.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a marauder.</p>
<p>I mean, he basically copied Snapchat seven times.</p>
<p>Like he did poke and he just kept trying</p>
<p>and trying and trying.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders</p>
<p>and the Instagram founders left</p>
<p>is they found Zuckerberg so distasteful</p>
<p>in terms of his ability to copy.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a great leader in that sense?</p>
<p>Because, okay, so when I look at Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great executor.</p>
<p>Is he a great executor?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a great leader.</p>
<p>I was bullish on,</p>
<p>I was excited by Facebook in the very early days.</p>
<p>I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people</p>
<p>and stuff started going wrong in certain kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And again, maybe it&rsquo;s our human nature,</p>
<p>but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy started it because he was unable</p>
<p>to ask girls if they were single and on a date.</p>
<p>I mean, that was his explicit.</p>
<p>That could be a good motivator.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it does.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, the motivation of 18, 19 year old men</p>
<p>or his, yeah, pretty clear.</p>
<p>He was just trying to, he had no game.</p>
<p>He had no game and he needed to know who was single</p>
<p>so he could at least have a shot at getting a date.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little creepy.</p>
<p>A little creepy, yeah.</p>
<p>He, I think, was so obsessed with engagement and winning.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s kind of like one of those friends you have</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just really good at playing a video game,</p>
<p>but maybe doesn&rsquo;t see the bigger picture in life.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason why everybody who worked</p>
<p>for him hates him and doesn&rsquo;t talk to him anymore</p>
<p>and then actively derides him.</p>
<p>Like so many, the people who sold WhatsApp to him</p>
<p>then backed other projects like Telegram</p>
<p>and said horrible things about him on the way out.</p>
<p>These are the people he made billionaires.</p>
<p>And they really don&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>So I think there is something that he does</p>
<p>that does not breed loyalty,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very successful in his focus,</p>
<p>which is growth is all that matters.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a marauder and taking friction out of products</p>
<p>and processes is the playbook of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>for the last decade or two.</p>
<p>So whatever the friction is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like poetry what you&rsquo;re saying right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re speaking so fast</p>
<p>that I almost forget that you&rsquo;re dropping bombs.</p>
<p>But so removing the, removing friction.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying Facebook is exceptionally good</p>
<p>at removing friction. He was the best at it.</p>
<p>I mean, at Uber, they were like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take out tipping.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take out the need for you</p>
<p>to take out your credit card and do payment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna be in your wallet.</p>
<p>You got picked up, you leave, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And I was like, we should have tipping.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, it adds a step.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to have no steps.</p>
<p>You put your address in, you click the button</p>
<p>and you do nothing else.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been obsessed here in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>is how many clicks can we take out of the process?</p>
<p>I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.</p>
<p>Absolutely, one click was the start of it.</p>
<p>And then you look at Clubhouse as an example,</p>
<p>you open Clubhouse and you see rooms,</p>
<p>you click on it, you&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>So in one click, you&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>And then in one click, if you raise your hand</p>
<p>or you get invited and you say, yes, you&rsquo;re speaking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s two clicks to speak, one click to listen.</p>
<p>I mean, the only way they could make that app work</p>
<p>even faster is if you opened it up</p>
<p>and your microphone was turned on,</p>
<p>which is kind of scary, but that is the next evolution.</p>
<p>And what happens when you go that fast</p>
<p>is you get unintended consequences.</p>
<p>And so this is why Facebook has had more fines</p>
<p>than any company in the history of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>just giant fines for doing stuff like this.</p>
<p>And one of them was, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember</p>
<p>when they created groups</p>
<p>or if you have a group for your podcast,</p>
<p>but you can just add people to a group</p>
<p>without their permission.</p>
<p>And there was this famous case</p>
<p>when they first came out with it.</p>
<p>Somebody created a Nambla fake group,</p>
<p>National Man Love Boy Association or whatever,</p>
<p>like pedophilia association.</p>
<p>And they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself,</p>
<p>and like 20 other famous people in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And I was like, and then somebody takes a screenshot of it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re in Nambla?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no.</p>
<p>Facebook, and then Zuckerberg&rsquo;s response was,</p>
<p>well, if your friends put you in that Nambla group,</p>
<p>you should get new friends.</p>
<p>And it was like, you got put in there too.</p>
<p>And then the sad part about it was</p>
<p>there were a group of young men who were gay</p>
<p>and who were in college</p>
<p>and there was a gay choir in their college</p>
<p>and the person who was coordinating their Facebook group</p>
<p>added them.</p>
<p>So Zuckerberg, it wasn&rsquo;t enough for Zuckerberg</p>
<p>to make it so anybody could add anybody to any group</p>
<p>because it will grow faster,</p>
<p>let alone you have to confirm</p>
<p>you wanna be added to the group.</p>
<p>What it also did was posted it on their walls</p>
<p>to increase engagement.</p>
<p>And what they inadvertently did was</p>
<p>they outed a bunch of 18, 19 year olds in college</p>
<p>to their families</p>
<p>because they joined the gay men&rsquo;s choir at some college.</p>
<p>And this is the kind of way,</p>
<p>this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself</p>
<p>and to do better is you have to really think,</p>
<p>well, there is my incentive to grow faster</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s right for society</p>
<p>and for the individual.</p>
<p>You gotta think it through, think it through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes very difficult.</p>
<p>This is where vision is required</p>
<p>to anticipate the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>And it seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to so many great leaders in this world,</p>
<p>privately and publicly.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a great leader</p>
<p>of these tech companies?</p>
<p>Do you have an example?</p>
<p>Is Elon to you a great leader?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a controversial one, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a love and hate, a controversial sense</p>
<p>that there is, and I know a lot of people work with him,</p>
<p>for him, that there&rsquo;s also a love, hate relationship.</p>
<p>The hate comes from the fact</p>
<p>that they get pushed extremely hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very competitive environment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a positive one</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a vision that&rsquo;s underlying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to the Steve Jobs thing.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the,</p>
<p>back to our Michael Jordan discussion as well,</p>
<p>that there seems to be the demons involved in tension</p>
<p>and just anxiety, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>If you wanna do great things,</p>
<p>there will be some suffering</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be some pain,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not easy if you wanna change the world.</p>
<p>And then some people have this expectation</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be easy.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll typically find for any great leader</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to do something super ambitious,</p>
<p>like if you wanna be like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a rich guy and you start a restaurant</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t care about making money</p>
<p>and people have made restaurants before,</p>
<p>you could be high fives</p>
<p>and everybody could love you or whatever.</p>
<p>But if you wanna change the world,</p>
<p>you wanna do something hard driving,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be sacrifice involved.</p>
<p>And so the problem is people are looking at something</p>
<p>that is an Olympic caliber sport</p>
<p>or a Navy SEALs like effort.</p>
<p>In other words, an effort that requires massive sacrifice.</p>
<p>We would not look at somebody who wins a gold medal,</p>
<p>like Michael Phelps and say,</p>
<p>oh my God, he had to get up at 4 a.m. every day</p>
<p>and he had to swim and he had to do an ice bath.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that poor guy, he suffered, he was tortured.</p>
<p>People were super mean to him,</p>
<p>they put him in an ice bath.</p>
<p>It was like, no, he wanted to be</p>
<p>the greatest swimmer of all time</p>
<p>and he knew what the sacrifice entailed.</p>
<p>And that what happens in work, in business,</p>
<p>is that people conflate like,</p>
<p>oh, well, I went to work to make a living to pay my bills</p>
<p>versus Michael Phelps approach to getting gold medals</p>
<p>or Michael Jordan or pick the person,</p>
<p>Elon or Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>And when you look at the reviews of like a place like Amazon,</p>
<p>there was this incredible story in the New York Times</p>
<p>where people were, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember it,</p>
<p>this is the worst place you could ever work, Amazon.</p>
<p>And we talked to 200 people and they all told us,</p>
<p>they all described for us in the New York Times,</p>
<p>a culture of cutthroatness and brutality</p>
<p>that has never before been seen.</p>
<p>And then you see all these people who work for Bezos</p>
<p>for 24 years from when they graduated</p>
<p>with their MBAs until today.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve never left the company</p>
<p>and they are ride or die forever.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re seeing there is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mismatch of people going to work</p>
<p>in an extreme sport or an extreme endeavor</p>
<p>who should not do that.</p>
<p>There are people who should go out into the rice fields</p>
<p>and pick rice.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another group of people who are samurai</p>
<p>and who wield a sword and who take on missions</p>
<p>that are dangerous.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a rice picker and that&rsquo;s what you do</p>
<p>and you feel safe, just getting a couple grains of rice,</p>
<p>put them in a basket, cleaning it and then whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s valid work, no big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not deriding it, I&rsquo;m sort of,</p>
<p>but that is one group.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people who are samurai</p>
<p>and you cannot conflate the two,</p>
<p>you cannot compare the two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what is happening right now in business.</p>
<p>Whenever you see these stories about,</p>
<p>this person at this company is like a tyrant</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so horrible and they yelled at somebody.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in the field</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re taking the beach at Normandy and it&rsquo;s D day</p>
<p>or you gotta take the hill</p>
<p>or you gotta whack Osama bin Laden</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the Navy SEALs and like a rudder,</p>
<p>a rotor gets knocked off the back of the Black Hawk,</p>
<p>like this is serious shit.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t do it if you&rsquo;re not serious.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not serious about changing the world,</p>
<p>why would you go work for Bezos?</p>
<p>Why would you go work for Elon Musk?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it, don&rsquo;t go work there.</p>
<p>This is, let me just sit back</p>
<p>and enjoy the beauty of all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s music to my ears,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s conflicting to a lot of the things I hear</p>
<p>from the way you&rsquo;re supposed to kind of act.</p>
<p>And I think in order to do great things,</p>
<p>you have to, I always admired people</p>
<p>that lose their shit a little bit</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so passionate.</p>
<p>And I apologize and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s a tension,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a drama to the creative process</p>
<p>when especially in the early startup,</p>
<p>this is not like the work life balance idea</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even apply.</p>
<p>Work life balance, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ridiculous concept.</p>
<p>Like the idea that there&rsquo;s like work life balance</p>
<p>in a startup is ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for work life balance,</p>
<p>do not go to a startup or any kind of ambitious company.</p>
<p>There is a series of places you can work in the world</p>
<p>where you do not need to do anything more</p>
<p>than what&rsquo;s put in front of you.</p>
<p>And you just put the round peg in the round hole</p>
<p>and the square peg in the square hole and you go home.</p>
<p>And you get your little bits and grains of rice</p>
<p>and you go heat them up and eat them, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other thing,</p>
<p>which is the extreme pursuit of changing the world</p>
<p>and sacrificing.</p>
<p>And we have a generation of people,</p>
<p>multi generations of people who are soft.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just soft.</p>
<p>I mean, what is the big struggle we&rsquo;ve had to deal with</p>
<p>in America in our lifetimes?</p>
<p>Like 9 11 and we didn&rsquo;t have the Vietnam War</p>
<p>and then we had this like weird Iraq Wars</p>
<p>and Middle East Wars that were kind of like a small number</p>
<p>of people went and we sent drones.</p>
<p>Like we have not had to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Gen Xers, maybe the tail end of boomers</p>
<p>experienced the Vietnam War regrettably.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve had a couple of generations now, three I guess,</p>
<p>that just haven&rsquo;t had to suffer.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re soft as Americans, we&rsquo;re soft.</p>
<p>And then you look at people in China and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, these poor Chinese people are living</p>
<p>in these tiny cramped apartments.</p>
<p>Like they were living in like essentially lean twos</p>
<p>in Northern China with no running water</p>
<p>or like one spigot of ice cold water for the entire village.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re thrilled to be joining the middle class.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s the bottom of the middle class, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken hundreds of millions of people in China</p>
<p>and moved them into the middle class.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, oh my God, these people are suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re up to $4 an hour,</p>
<p>three or $4 an hour in the factories there.</p>
<p>And they were just two decades ago at,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it was probably 50 cents an hour,</p>
<p>something crazy like that.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;ve improved the quality of life there so much,</p>
<p>just like America did 200 years ago or 100 years ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve improved it so much in China</p>
<p>that now they&rsquo;re getting outpriced for factories</p>
<p>from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India,</p>
<p>and people are moving and people in China</p>
<p>are moving the factories out of China into other countries.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese are now outsourcing to Vietnam</p>
<p>and other countries.</p>
<p>So this is the way of the world.</p>
<p>People move up and they get a better lot in life</p>
<p>for their families.</p>
<p>And just in America, we&rsquo;ve gotten soft.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a generation.</p>
<p>How do people die in America now?</p>
<p>Suicide, obesity, heart attacks, anxiety.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re suffering from things</p>
<p>that if you told people 100 years ago</p>
<p>that the number, the top ways Americans would die</p>
<p>would be overeating and suicide,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be like, what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally killing yourself</p>
<p>or eating yourself to death?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in America?</p>
<p>And when everybody, not everybody en masse,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>who have become softer and softer.</p>
<p>Capitalism creates an environment</p>
<p>where there is people that still step up amidst that</p>
<p>with a big dream and challenge the conventions.</p>
<p>And that human spirit just arise above that.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s example of that, Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s example of that.</p>
<p>Countless, countless examples.</p>
<p>And they push the limits of those,</p>
<p>of human beings that are willing to step up.</p>
<p>And I think about sort of how to create a company</p>
<p>that amidst all of this softness</p>
<p>still creates a revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t seem trivial.</p>
<p>It seems like how do you build a culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s once healthy, but also unhealthy</p>
<p>in the way that an Olympic pursuit is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all top down.</p>
<p>Everybody just, you asked earlier what leadership was</p>
<p>and I never answered the question.</p>
<p>I think what leaders do is they set the example,</p>
<p>they set the bar.</p>
<p>And if you look at someone like Elon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re personal friends for 20 years</p>
<p>and he is indefatigable.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, the guy has a stamina that is just phenomenal.</p>
<p>Like he does not get tired.</p>
<p>He works relentlessly</p>
<p>and he sets that standard for the rest of the team.</p>
<p>And I think Bezos is very sharp</p>
<p>and likes to debate stuff and is very,</p>
<p>and Jobs was just incredible at design</p>
<p>and figuring out how to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>So they just, leaders set the standard.</p>
<p>They set the standard.</p>
<p>And you know that your time is over as a leader</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t set the standard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you have to pass the baton, right?</p>
<p>And Bezos did that.</p>
<p>And Bezos now is saying, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 57, I&rsquo;m the richest guy on the planet,</p>
<p>depending on the week.</p>
<p>And I would like to do some other challenges,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t wanna grind it out at Amazon</p>
<p>for another 25 years.</p>
<p>I wanna do other things.</p>
<p>And so he passed the baton.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the healthy thing to do in that regard.</p>
<p>I do think there is a time period</p>
<p>in which you can run that hot.</p>
<p>And then at a certain point you have to then change.</p>
<p>Just like an athlete might go to be a coach, right?</p>
<p>Or a commentator.</p>
<p>And so being an entrepreneur is brutal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seven days a week, 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>Anybody who says anything differently</p>
<p>is kidding themselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to sacrifice.</p>
<p>And this competition, and America has to fight.</p>
<p>If America does not win capitalism, and China does,</p>
<p>it is literally the end of the human species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over for humanity.</p>
<p>Right now, everything has been going really well</p>
<p>in terms of the number of people living in poverty</p>
<p>is plummeting.</p>
<p>Lifespans have been rising.</p>
<p>Science is booming.</p>
<p>The economy is booming.</p>
<p>All these things are incredible.</p>
<p>The one thing that&rsquo;s kind of stagnant right now</p>
<p>is the number of people living in democracy</p>
<p>versus under authoritarian rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>So when you look at all Steve Pinker&rsquo;s charts,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really excited,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one you&rsquo;re gonna see that&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>And I think we peaked with 53 or 54% of people</p>
<p>on the planet Earth being in a democracy,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s going below 50.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because some of the democratic Western countries</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the population growth</p>
<p>of some of the communist and socialist countries</p>
<p>and authoritarian countries.</p>
<p>And we have to make sure that we win capitalism.</p>
<p>We must win economically.</p>
<p>That is the battlefield.</p>
<p>The battlefield is science, technology, and money,</p>
<p>and economy, finance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the battlefield.</p>
<p>China wins, authoritarians win.</p>
<p>And at any time, Xi Jinping can pull Jack Ma into a room</p>
<p>and say, it&rsquo;s time for you to be reeducated.</p>
<p>Or they can put three or four million people,</p>
<p>Uighurs, into prison camps and say, you know what?</p>
<p>This religious thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s counter to what is productive for us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re gonna shave your heads</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to have you</p>
<p>literally pick cotton in the fields.</p>
<p>They have Uighurs with no sense of any kind of</p>
<p>arc of history in the fields picking cottons</p>
<p>as slaves in what can only be described</p>
<p>by every humanitarian organization as a concentration camp.</p>
<p>And every Jewish person I know takes great offense</p>
<p>when somebody uses the Holocaust as a metaphor,</p>
<p>except in the case of the Uighurs right now.</p>
<p>And every Jewish person I&rsquo;ve talked to has said to me,</p>
<p>that is a Holocaust.</p>
<p>That is millions of people going to genocide</p>
<p>because of their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an atheist,</p>
<p>but if people wanna believe a certain religion, fine.</p>
<p>But China&rsquo;s approach is we need to win capitalism so bad,</p>
<p>we need to win on the global stage so bad,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have any of this religious stuff going on here.</p>
<p>That is a distraction from winning and beating America.</p>
<p>And then in America,</p>
<p>the people who are gonna make us win are the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and the scientists and the technology</p>
<p>and our education system and finance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re vilifying those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty dark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark, but I still believe that the vilification</p>
<p>is just in the space of Twitter and the space of ideas.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably a good.</p>
<p>And entrepreneurs win out in the end.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t listen to that.</p>
<p>I believe we&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll build, we&rsquo;ll get the rocks up.</p>
<p>Some of them do actually in their darkest moments,</p>
<p>I can tell you that they turn off their Twitter accounts</p>
<p>and they, I&rsquo;ve had to sit down</p>
<p>with a number of entrepreneurs and say, turn off Twitter.</p>
<p>This is not healthy for you.</p>
<p>This is not a healthy pursuit because,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t read the comments.</p>
<p>If you do, it&rsquo;s like a full contact sport.</p>
<p>You should just take it as like professional wrestling</p>
<p>or something, but stay focused on building companies</p>
<p>and advancing the human species</p>
<p>through science and technology.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re describing, you&rsquo;ve hosted this week in startups</p>
<p>for how many episodes?</p>
<p>11 years, almost 1200 now.</p>
<p>1200.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked to some of the great leaders</p>
<p>in business in general.</p>
<p>Is there a common thing that you see or?</p>
<p>Really, I&rsquo;m in a relationship with their parents.</p>
<p>Like just find me a great entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I will, show me the trauma.</p>
<p>Their dad was like, you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>In the teenage years, is that truly, is there something?</p>
<p>There is definitely something.</p>
<p>Hardship at some point in their life kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, and there&rsquo;s definitely something</p>
<p>with immigrant parents that is a bit of a stereotype</p>
<p>out here, but I&rsquo;ve heard from many investors,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like their, oh, were your parents immigrants?</p>
<p>And did they beat into you that you have to succeed</p>
<p>and you feel the need to succeed</p>
<p>because they suffered to get you to this country?</p>
<p>Like there is an archetype there that I hear.</p>
<p>When I started investing, I heard from a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you wanna find those immigrant founders</p>
<p>who are coming out of Stanford</p>
<p>because they had to fight to get there</p>
<p>and their parents had to fight, right?</p>
<p>So it was like two huge fights and there&rsquo;s so much at stake</p>
<p>as opposed to somebody who&rsquo;s fifth generation</p>
<p>and like had everything handed to them</p>
<p>and they were legacy and got into schools for free.</p>
<p>But I think in general, the ability to get people</p>
<p>to join you on that journey is so critical.</p>
<p>So you have to be charismatic</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean like you&rsquo;re an extrovert.</p>
<p>There are introverts who are super charismatic</p>
<p>and there are soft spoken people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be like super vivacious</p>
<p>or rambunctious people.</p>
<p>They could be just quiet assassins,</p>
<p>but you need to be able to get people</p>
<p>to come on the journey with you.</p>
<p>You have to be that storyteller</p>
<p>and you have to have that passion</p>
<p>and then you have to transfer that enthusiasm to investors,</p>
<p>the press, to customers, to all the stakeholders.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re enthusiastic about it and you&rsquo;re engaged,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s easier for people to come on that journey.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people really start to think about,</p>
<p>well, what is the purpose of what I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>And it sounds corny and when I first heard that,</p>
<p>I was like, it&rsquo;s kind of corny.</p>
<p>But then I read this book by,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got his name, Rick something.</p>
<p>He wrote the purpose driven church</p>
<p>and he had spoken at a TED or something</p>
<p>and everybody went crazy about it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, a church should have one purpose,</p>
<p>one single thing they do.</p>
<p>And like his church,</p>
<p>which was like one of these mega churches in San Diego,</p>
<p>just wanted to do education for this specific country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all they did.</p>
<p>And they just, they benchmarked.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to have a purpose and a mission,</p>
<p>not everything, but a specific purpose of some kind of joy</p>
<p>that you wanna put into the world.</p>
<p>You wanna solve some kind of big, hard problem.</p>
<p>And then everybody knows</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re coming to work every day.</p>
<p>And then for the founder,</p>
<p>when you dread going to work that day</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel like solving that problem anymore,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the tell.</p>
<p>And a lot of times I meet young founders,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why are you doing this?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, I was looking for an idea</p>
<p>and this is the one I came up with</p>
<p>because I think I&rsquo;ll make a lot of money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re gonna quit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get to month nine or 10 of this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna run out of money</p>
<p>or like your CTO is gonna quit,</p>
<p>then your CFO is gonna quit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna lose your biggest customer</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just gonna say, this is not worth it.</p>
<p>And if using Bezos or Elon as examples,</p>
<p>they just needed to see the world change</p>
<p>in very specific ways.</p>
<p>And Steve Jobs, they needed to see a change</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they made money</p>
<p>or they were losing or winning,</p>
<p>they just went to work every day and they had to change it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they didn&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>No choice.</p>
<p>Elon makes it sound like his torture, his whole journey,</p>
<p>but he can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>Having been a witness to it, just as friends for that long,</p>
<p>I have never seen an entrepreneur suffer more than him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been public about that, like you do not wanna be me.</p>
<p>He has suffered for those companies.</p>
<p>He has suffered to get them where they are.</p>
<p>It has not been easy.</p>
<p>Can you second analyze Elon in that aspect?</p>
<p>Like, is it just he can&rsquo;t help it?</p>
<p>He must see the change that he hopes for in the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just incredibly hardworking</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very talented as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people understand that.</p>
<p>He actually is a really brilliant man.</p>
<p>He actually is a really brilliant engineer.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, he actually knows what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and he asked the right questions.</p>
<p>I mean, people were kind of aghast</p>
<p>that he was asking Vlad such good questions.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh my God,</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s the best journalist on the planet.</p>
<p>And it was like, anybody who knows Elon knows</p>
<p>he has great questions.</p>
<p>I mean, I used to have dinner in LA</p>
<p>and my book agent also was Sam Harris&rsquo;s agent.</p>
<p>And Sam and I met through John Brockman</p>
<p>and we became friends because we lived near each other</p>
<p>and I was friends with Elon.</p>
<p>And then I used to invite them to both dinner in Brentwood</p>
<p>because one lived in Bel Air,</p>
<p>one lived in Santa Monica and I lived in Brentwood.</p>
<p>And we would go to this place,</p>
<p>Popone, this Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>And every Tuesday for years, we would just,</p>
<p>the three of us, every other Tuesday or so,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have dinner and I&rsquo;d sit there</p>
<p>and Sam wanted to know about AI</p>
<p>and Elon&rsquo;s talking about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s on the board of DeepMind.</p>
<p>Elon wanted to know about atheism and meditation</p>
<p>and all this other stuff that Sam was an expert on.</p>
<p>I got to sit there and just listen to these two guys talk.</p>
<p>And they have both piercing intelligences,</p>
<p>but Elon, he goes straight to the gut,</p>
<p>like the questions that no engineer wants to hear</p>
<p>is just the basic stuff that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, why the hell are you doing it this way</p>
<p>when the obvious solution is much easier or this or that?</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you tried this?</p>
<p>He can figure things out.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a problem solver.</p>
<p>I mean, and that&rsquo;s another thing,</p>
<p>like I think the great entrepreneurs</p>
<p>can look at a problem with very fresh eyes,</p>
<p>like almost consistently.</p>
<p>And Bezos described that as day one thinking, right?</p>
<p>Like just pretend this is day one every day.</p>
<p>And then other people use the term first principles,</p>
<p>but it basically means like when you see a problem,</p>
<p>pause for a second and really think through</p>
<p>what is the best possible solution here?</p>
<p>What are some alternative solutions and get from everybody,</p>
<p>like how do we solve this problem?</p>
<p>What people do sometimes they get in a rut.</p>
<p>They just come to work and they just go through their email.</p>
<p>They do whatever they did the day before.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think, why are we doing this?</p>
<p>And is there a better way to do it?</p>
<p>Now you can get so obsessive about that</p>
<p>that you can over engineer stuff</p>
<p>and you can never actually ship a product.</p>
<p>So there have to be some pragmatism and some goals</p>
<p>and some dates associated with that.</p>
<p>But it is a very cool thing to really think like,</p>
<p>I wonder if we actually made the batteries ourselves,</p>
<p>what that would look like.</p>
<p>Or I wonder if we could get to two day shipping,</p>
<p>or what if we do same day shipping?</p>
<p>Like you need to have somebody who&rsquo;s willing to say,</p>
<p>you know what, fuck it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set a crazy audacious goal.</p>
<p>Two day shipping of any product</p>
<p>anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>And once you throw the gauntlet down like that,</p>
<p>now everybody knows they&rsquo;re rolling in the right direction.</p>
<p>Two day shipping, Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people didn&rsquo;t realize about Amazon.</p>
<p>The business wasn&rsquo;t shipping all those products.</p>
<p>It was getting you to sign up for Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>They have hundreds of millions of people doing Amazon Prime</p>
<p>for 10 bucks a month.</p>
<p>I think globally it&rsquo;s probably cheaper.</p>
<p>But that was the driver of that business</p>
<p>was all of those people.</p>
<p>Cause they would, you&rsquo;re an Amazon Prime subscriber?</p>
<p>Do you know how much you pay?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It started at $50.</p>
<p>And I think they even had like 40, 50, $60</p>
<p>was like the testing in the early days.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s, I think $149, 12, $13 a month.</p>
<p>If you pay for the year,</p>
<p>I think it goes down to 10 bucks a month, 120.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, you&rsquo;re paying $13 a month</p>
<p>for the privilege of shopping at Amazon.</p>
<p>But you say it&rsquo;s the greatest thing in the world</p>
<p>because anything I need,</p>
<p>if you forgot a microphone or a cable goes bad</p>
<p>or a camera goes bad, you get it here within a day or less.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already been dropping bombs,</p>
<p>incredible advice on startups in general.</p>
<p>But let me maybe go straight in and ask,</p>
<p>is there advice for somebody that wants to go big</p>
<p>to build the big startup to help them succeed?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very similar to the advice I give to investors</p>
<p>because now I teach angel investing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many people who want to invest.</p>
<p>And so I wrote a book on that angel</p>
<p>and then I do a course called Angel University</p>
<p>that I teach six times a year.</p>
<p>And then I have a syndicate called thesyndicate.com</p>
<p>where I invest in companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 6,500 people who are members of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest syndicate in the world.</p>
<p>In fact, the first deal we ever did was calm.com,</p>
<p>the meditation app.</p>
<p>We put $378,000 into it</p>
<p>when it was a $5 million product.</p>
<p>A $5 million company.</p>
<p>So we bought six or 7% of the company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now worth 2 billion.</p>
<p>So you can do the math on that.</p>
<p>We still own 5%.</p>
<p>What year was that?</p>
<p>Six years ago.</p>
<p>So probably seven, yeah, maybe 2015, 2014.</p>
<p>And nobody else would invest in calm.</p>
<p>But Sam Harris was the reason I did because I asked Sam,</p>
<p>tell me about meditation.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s explaining it to me.</p>
<p>And I said, what about this?</p>
<p>You have to have like a mantra.</p>
<p>How does it work exactly?</p>
<p>I know positive.</p>
<p>He was like, well, you know, you should just go to UCLA</p>
<p>and talk to Diana Winston.</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s this whole project there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, UCLA does meditation?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, there&rsquo;s a mindful institute.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like teaching people to be Tahitian meditation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing PTSD and I&rsquo;m doing brain scans.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh.</p>
<p>And then I talked to the UCLA people and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real, yeah, like we taught Phil Jackson</p>
<p>and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O Neal did,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s how they won their championships.</p>
<p>They meditated.</p>
<p>And I was like, hmm, if UCLA is doing it,</p>
<p>Sam says it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Well, fuck it, I&rsquo;ll put money into that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the second biggest investment</p>
<p>in my career after Uber.</p>
<p>And it will in all likelihood become the biggest.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s between Uber, Robinhood and Calm.</p>
<p>And long story short,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m teaching people to angel invest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really two things that you cannot fake.</p>
<p>One is a product that is built really well.</p>
<p>So if you look at Calm, Robinhood, Uber, Tesla, Amazon,</p>
<p>these products are transcendent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re well constructed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s craftsmanship to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great products.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying not fundamentally like the idea,</p>
<p>but the execution of the actual craftsmanship</p>
<p>of the construction.</p>
<p>The actual product is amazing.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p>And that every business has ultimately a customer.</p>
<p>And that customer, if they are in fact delighted</p>
<p>by that product, that&rsquo;s the magic.</p>
<p>Because you need a team to build the product.</p>
<p>And then you need customers to use the product.</p>
<p>And really those three vectors are undeniable.</p>
<p>Now, you can have great teams that build a bad product,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen too often.</p>
<p>Or you can have customers who don&rsquo;t like the product,</p>
<p>but generally speaking,</p>
<p>a great team will build a great product</p>
<p>or a good product that iterate,</p>
<p>and then eventually delight customers.</p>
<p>And so most people say the team is the most important,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of smart people out there.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s assume that you can raise money for your idea,</p>
<p>or you have money,</p>
<p>or you can just convince people to do it for free.</p>
<p>If you make a great product and it connects with users,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the magic.</p>
<p>You look at Clubhouse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a really well designed product.</p>
<p>And that product is connecting with customers.</p>
<p>And if you were to talk to the customers</p>
<p>or look at the product,</p>
<p>you would see a well constructed product</p>
<p>and a delighted customer.</p>
<p>And you can tell the delighted customer</p>
<p>by just the amount of time they use it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called engagement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fancy word for how much they use it.</p>
<p>And Snapchat, when that was going around</p>
<p>and they were trying to raise money,</p>
<p>they had a fraction of the number of users,</p>
<p>but the top maybe third were opening the app every hour.</p>
<p>And nobody had ever seen that before.</p>
<p>People were using Facebook a couple of times a day,</p>
<p>the top users,</p>
<p>but nobody had ever seen people using it every day</p>
<p>for a hundred days in a row, every hour.</p>
<p>And I was like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, the ephemeral messaging,</p>
<p>and then the streaks.</p>
<p>They had created these streaks between people</p>
<p>where every day and then people would be like on vacation,</p>
<p>like, I just have to open my streak</p>
<p>and keep my streak with Lex</p>
<p>that we chatted every day going.</p>
<p>And so they had this like addictive nature to it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Clubhouse was able</p>
<p>to garner so much investment</p>
<p>is the number of hours people were using it every month</p>
<p>was just unbelievably off the charts.</p>
<p>Some of that is execution,</p>
<p>but some of it is the weird magic of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Product market fit.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s something, I mean, Clubhouse,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s still a mystery to me</p>
<p>because I also use Discord voice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intimacy to voice.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Well, you have people&rsquo;s, yeah, tent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, but like the video gets in the way actually,</p>
<p>in a weird way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a privacy when you just use voice.</p>
<p>People are not taking showers now, Lex.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in a pandemic and people just roll out of bed.</p>
<p>And the hair thing, nobody&rsquo;s getting haircuts.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s hair is good, nobody&rsquo;s getting haircuts.</p>
<p>People are wearing gym clothes.</p>
<p>I mean, Zoom is just horrific to be on Zoom</p>
<p>for five hours a day.</p>
<p>It is exhausting.</p>
<p>Well, it does make me wonder what,</p>
<p>once we emerge from the pandemic,</p>
<p>whether a product market fit,</p>
<p>how that evolves with Clubhouse</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know Clubhouse is a beneficiary</p>
<p>of the pandemic for sure.</p>
<p>When do you think the pandemic,</p>
<p>when do you think deaths will be under,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 200 a day and we&rsquo;ll have 200 million people</p>
<p>on the other side of this?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s kind of what it takes, right?</p>
<p>You gotta get to 150, 200 million people</p>
<p>on the other side in America?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>I personally stopped deeply thinking about this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been frustrated for so long that.</p>
<p>You checked out.</p>
<p>I almost checked out</p>
<p>because it psychologically allows me to carry on</p>
<p>because I thought for many months now</p>
<p>that testing needs to be done at scale.</p>
<p>And it still hasn&rsquo;t gotten done.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ridiculous.</p>
<p>We gave up basically on testing.</p>
<p>We gave up.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re all sitting there</p>
<p>waiting for vaccine to come along.</p>
<p>And the distribution of the vaccine is not, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s struggling from the same kind of things</p>
<p>as the testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take quite a bit of time.</p>
<p>So it does, if everything goes great,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s not a second strand of the virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create a second major wave</p>
<p>that I am cynical enough to think</p>
<p>that it won&rsquo;t be until mid summer</p>
<p>that we start opening back up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s gonna be May, June.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit earlier than you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking it.</p>
<p>There are 1.5 million shots in arms a day.</p>
<p>I think this vaccine&rsquo;s been undersold.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a miracle.</p>
<p>Not one person who was in the trials died, who took it,</p>
<p>and only one went to the hospital</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t even put on a ventilator.</p>
<p>So, and the hospitalizations are plummeting</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re at 10% now in the United States.</p>
<p>At the pace, we&rsquo;re going at 1.5 a day.</p>
<p>I think when the Johnson &amp; Johnson one comes out next month,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be 3 million a day maybe, two and a half.</p>
<p>And we already have 100 million people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve likely had it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been doing the math.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re like 60 days away, February, March.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometime in April, I think.</p>
<p>Anybody&rsquo;s gonna be able to get a shot</p>
<p>and the number of deaths is gonna go below 200 a day.</p>
<p>And once that happens,</p>
<p>I think people have had enough of this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna go YOLO.</p>
<p>But see, the crucial piece for me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been focusing on is the social media aspect</p>
<p>of how the, it&rsquo;s not just about the reality of deaths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the state of the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of the human species,</p>
<p>which is determined by our communication on social media.</p>
<p>So yeah, we can be collectively afraid,</p>
<p>the fear can spread, or it could be YOLO can spread,</p>
<p>or it could be like all different kinds of misinformation.</p>
<p>And of course, during the election year,</p>
<p>the politics influences our perception of what is true</p>
<p>and not, but having real rigorous nuanced conversation</p>
<p>about this kind of stuff is the way out of this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where social media really comes in</p>
<p>because social media drives division,</p>
<p>where people form tribes and so on.</p>
<p>And it feels like it&rsquo;s honestly a technology problem.</p>
<p>People say it&rsquo;s a human problem,</p>
<p>but it just feels like, I believe humans are good.</p>
<p>Technology can enable them to be thoughtful.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about the magic of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and then maybe going too far</p>
<p>with the Facebook groups example,</p>
<p>where you take out all that friction.</p>
<p>What happened was we used to have something called Rchron,</p>
<p>reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you consume to feed.</p>
<p>So any kind of social feed,</p>
<p>like Twitter was in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>The newest thing was up top</p>
<p>and you would just work your way backwards.</p>
<p>And so it gave this like really fresh feeling.</p>
<p>And then a guy named Dave Moran</p>
<p>and the team over at Facebook realized,</p>
<p>you know, there are some things</p>
<p>that got a lot of attention two hours ago.</p>
<p>And the stuff since then has not been as important.</p>
<p>But if you miss that, there was a really good tweet</p>
<p>where there was a really good update.</p>
<p>Like somebody had a baby.</p>
<p>Can we get the baby one at the top?</p>
<p>And it was like, well, how would we do that?</p>
<p>How would we know that that&rsquo;s the important one?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, let&rsquo;s put a like button on it</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see how many comments there are.</p>
<p>So if it gets a lot of likes or comments or retweets,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s show those first</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll kind of mix in the most recent stuff.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re on Twitter,</p>
<p>and then when Facebook did that,</p>
<p>Facebook became so addicting</p>
<p>because Facebook was on,</p>
<p>what has got the most engagement?</p>
<p>Put that first.</p>
<p>So every time you opened up Facebook,</p>
<p>you get the dopamine hit.</p>
<p>And then what happens when you see the Bar Mitzvah photo</p>
<p>or, you know, the enraging story</p>
<p>about some injustice in the world?</p>
<p>You retweet it, you write a comment,</p>
<p>you share it on your wall.</p>
<p>And thus this addiction to the outrageous,</p>
<p>the outlandish, the inspiring occurred.</p>
<p>And it used to be like inspiring stuff,</p>
<p>puppies or some heartwarming story.</p>
<p>And then it got dark.</p>
<p>And then people started to realize,</p>
<p>if I wanna show up on the top of my friend&rsquo;s feeds,</p>
<p>if I say something controversial or I&rsquo;m outraged,</p>
<p>I get to the top.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when outrage culture came in.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when cancel culture came in.</p>
<p>Everybody started to realize,</p>
<p>if I try to cancel that person for being a racist</p>
<p>or a sexist or a horrible human being</p>
<p>or whatever they did that&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>I get to the top of the feed.</p>
<p>And we all collectively started playing</p>
<p>a very weird video game,</p>
<p>which is how outraged can we all be?</p>
<p>And to get to the top of the list.</p>
<p>And then of course, with Trump, he realized it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, okay, yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna make fun of a celebrity</p>
<p>and I get more retweets.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna make fun of Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell</p>
<p>for being overweight or something.</p>
<p>And he just starts attacking people.</p>
<p>And people are like, oh my God, what did he say?</p>
<p>And he copied that from Howard Stern.</p>
<p>Cause he was in New York and he used to be on Howard Stern.</p>
<p>Howard Stern took over all the dialogue</p>
<p>in the eighties and nineties because he was outrageous.</p>
<p>And then Trump did that.</p>
<p>And then social media incorporated that</p>
<p>into the operating system.</p>
<p>It became the actual device of social media</p>
<p>was the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got something incredible for you.</p>
<p>Everybody salivates like Pavlov&rsquo;s dog.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I can be outraged.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gotta be undone.</p>
<p>And the only way for that to be undone</p>
<p>is these things can&rsquo;t be billions of people</p>
<p>where the most outrageous thing</p>
<p>that happened in the world today</p>
<p>in the last five minutes is now in front of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people have anxiety.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t sleep and they doom scroll all night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the human mind was not meant to process</p>
<p>this much suffering, pain, anger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have all this mental health issues.</p>
<p>Also, young girls or even adults watching other people</p>
<p>post their private jets and their vacations</p>
<p>and YOLO adventures on their Instagram</p>
<p>to the point at which young people are now faking</p>
<p>being on private jets to put on their Instagram</p>
<p>and creating this crazy FOMO around their Instagrams.</p>
<p>We wonder why people are unhappy.</p>
<p>If you think everybody&rsquo;s on a private jet</p>
<p>going to some Michelin star restaurant</p>
<p>or whatever the coolest thing in the world is today,</p>
<p>going to the Grammys, going to whatever,</p>
<p>Coachella, Burning Man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, ah, but I&rsquo;m home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my house and I&rsquo;m not at Burning Man.</p>
<p>Getting inadequate.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So this whole system is creating</p>
<p>the wrong set of incentives.</p>
<p>I tend to believe it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to still have extremely high engagement</p>
<p>and create a successful profitable business</p>
<p>while encouraging personal growth,</p>
<p>like encouraging people to be the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>I just think we haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we got the first generation of social networks.</p>
<p>I think a new generation needs to be built.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is that your plan for a business?</p>
<p>Well, I have a longer term plan in terms of ambition,</p>
<p>which is I believe in being able to have deep connection</p>
<p>between human and AI systems, like partners, friends.</p>
<p>There is a connection to there with social media.</p>
<p>I do think AI has a strong role to play in representing us,</p>
<p>in guiding us in how we consume social media.</p>
<p>So this algorithm that controls the feed for Facebook</p>
<p>is a somewhat centralized algorithm,</p>
<p>but instead to give more power to the people,</p>
<p>individuals to where each one of us have our own algorithm.</p>
<p>Bring your own algorithm.</p>
<p>BYOA.</p>
<p>BYOA, I like it.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing your own alcohol,</p>
<p>bring your own algorithm.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you thought about it,</p>
<p>if we came and said, when I look at my Twitter feed,</p>
<p>I would like to see the people with,</p>
<p>who are the most helpful in the world,</p>
<p>generous, kind, intelligent, considered,</p>
<p>commenting on things that I don&rsquo;t already know about</p>
<p>because I want to open my worldview.</p>
<p>That could be a beautiful thing for society.</p>
<p>And actually Jack was talking about potentially on Twitter,</p>
<p>letting people bring their own algorithms</p>
<p>and sort their feeds themselves.</p>
<p>This would be a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons Clubhouse has resonated</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s such a diverse group of people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been able to drop in on conversations</p>
<p>with people who are nothing like me</p>
<p>and listen in and hear conversations</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t normally be privy to.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, oh, come join as a speaker.</p>
<p>I want to do a room with you.</p>
<p>I get asked every day, can we do a room?</p>
<p>Can we do a room?</p>
<p>Ask an angel investor, talk about startups.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, my usage of Clubhouse</p>
<p>is going on my Peloton treadmill,</p>
<p>putting Clubhouse on, picking a room and just listening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so delightful for me as a podcaster</p>
<p>where my job is to talk, to sit back</p>
<p>and just put in a couple of miles and play chess</p>
<p>and listen to a Clubhouse discussion</p>
<p>that is about relationships or some fashion or hip hop</p>
<p>or whatever it is that I&rsquo;m not part of.</p>
<p>I just sit there and I listen and you learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like such a delightful thing.</p>
<p>I always think about these kids who go to college</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always been so jealous of these Ivy League kids.</p>
<p>They go and they&rsquo;re like, oh, I got to go to class.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I would just love to sit there</p>
<p>and listen to Professor Lex talk.</p>
<p>What a privilege to sit there</p>
<p>and let somebody else drive and talk and listen and learn.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the beauty of podcasting.</p>
<p>But of course, Clubhouse creates a whole nother experience</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s conversations, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be the in between.</p>
<p>I like it as a, you release your podcast.</p>
<p>Like you and I are going to release this podcast, right?</p>
<p>And then at some point I&rsquo;ll have you on my pod</p>
<p>when you want your startup.</p>
<p>And then at some point somebody is going to be like,</p>
<p>you and I will run into, and I ran into you.</p>
<p>I saw you were on Clubhouse the other night</p>
<p>and I was busy, but I was almost going to click on you</p>
<p>and say, let&rsquo;s start a room together.</p>
<p>But you and I will start a room together</p>
<p>with Eric Weinstein or somebody</p>
<p>or Sam Harris will jump in or Elon</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have a different experience,</p>
<p>which would just shoot the shit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll act as like a fabric</p>
<p>and a little filler between the tent pole podcasts, right?</p>
<p>Like you and Eric, you&rsquo;ve done three, I think, with Eric.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was your four, I haven&rsquo;t released the fourth yet.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so I watched all three</p>
<p>because I really thought your you way</p>
<p>and him like giving you advice</p>
<p>is very interesting dynamic.</p>
<p>I thought it was very interesting dynamic.</p>
<p>And I find him like a fascinating cat.</p>
<p>We know everybody in common, except we&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird because you think about the social graph</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>This is why I think augmented reality</p>
<p>is going to be such an amazing product.</p>
<p>I just have one killer feature I want</p>
<p>for augmented reality, we wear our glasses.</p>
<p>And when I look at you above your head,</p>
<p>I see the relationships we have</p>
<p>and the things we&rsquo;ve done together, right?</p>
<p>So I see, oh, you both know Sam Harris</p>
<p>or you had Elon on the podcast on this date</p>
<p>or you and I were both at Burning Man in 2016.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the most meaningful element</p>
<p>of our connection in the network, yeah.</p>
<p>And then, cause we would discover that through small talk,</p>
<p>but imagine you&rsquo;re like at a party and you look</p>
<p>and it just, people glow and you just see a glow</p>
<p>around a person and like green means</p>
<p>you have some financial relationship.</p>
<p>Blue means you have some friendship one</p>
<p>or yellow means you have friendship one.</p>
<p>Blue means you know nothing about each other.</p>
<p>You have no connections.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, wow, these blue people have no connection to.</p>
<p>These people, that one&rsquo;s glowing red.</p>
<p>We know seven or more people in common.</p>
<p>And those are the seven people.</p>
<p>Oh, we should go talk about how we know each other.</p>
<p>That could, and that sort of happened with Facebook member</p>
<p>or MySpace where you were like, oh, you know that person,</p>
<p>friend of a friend.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what is going to be AR is like,</p>
<p>this is why I think if Apple figures out AR or Snapchat</p>
<p>and they just have those glasses, you know,</p>
<p>forget about VR, it&rsquo;s just nauseating and whatever,</p>
<p>but AR where you put the glasses on,</p>
<p>you see the real world, but you augment it.</p>
<p>You make a, just like you were saying,</p>
<p>you make a frictionless, a very low friction</p>
<p>to make a deep human connection</p>
<p>because you have all the basic elements there already.</p>
<p>Now think about the unintended consequences</p>
<p>of what I just described.</p>
<p>It could get creepy and weird.</p>
<p>The privacy thing.</p>
<p>I mean, people will, here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>people, your privacy is an illusion.</p>
<p>Like all this information is there.</p>
<p>And then people are more than willing to give up privacy</p>
<p>in exchange for some value, you know, it&rsquo;s a value trade.</p>
<p>And giving, if my Tesla,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m driving in the direction of my house,</p>
<p>just starts the navigation and saves me three clicks</p>
<p>and that friction&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to give Tesla my location</p>
<p>and my home address, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not willing to give Zuckerberg anything</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t trust him, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it will be that way with like DNA and other things</p>
<p>at some point we&rsquo;ll just be like, yeah, just take my DNA.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>People can look and see that I&rsquo;m a mental midget</p>
<p>and my IQ is like lower than,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to bring the bell curve up or whatever,</p>
<p>but you could figure out,</p>
<p>like if we all put our DNA in a sequence online</p>
<p>and be like, oh yeah, you know, Lex has got 10 more IQ points</p>
<p>than Jcal and, you know, Sam&rsquo;s got 10 more than Lex.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden people are like all bed out of shape</p>
<p>about it, but what if they, we did that?</p>
<p>And they were like, and by the way, you also,</p>
<p>all three of you are going to get Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unless you do X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>unless you eat more blueberries or whatever we figure out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to accept it pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brave new world.</p>
<p>Brave new world.</p>
<p>I have to ask you, you&rsquo;re, just like you were saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the world experts in investing</p>
<p>and in startups, yeah, VC and so on.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the startup,</p>
<p>I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.</p>
<p>It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what the hell I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>When is the, when should a startup raise money?</p>
<p>And from the perspective of the investor,</p>
<p>when should the investor invest in a startup?</p>
<p>Like, is there a timing thing here?</p>
<p>Is there a, what, yeah, what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important question</p>
<p>because the venture capital community</p>
<p>is only going to fund, you know, sub 1% of enterprises</p>
<p>started in the United States every year,</p>
<p>like maybe 10 basis points of them, like one in a thousand.</p>
<p>And the reason is it&rsquo;s jet fuel.</p>
<p>You only want to take that money</p>
<p>if you really want to build something big</p>
<p>and you want to build it fast.</p>
<p>And when you put jet fuel behind a startup,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve seen with other rockets,</p>
<p>things can blow up and people can die.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not people literally dying,</p>
<p>but the business can go up in smoke, right?</p>
<p>Like rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX</p>
<p>as part of their ambitious plans.</p>
<p>And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in,</p>
<p>go to zero.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to start the business</p>
<p>and only build it off customer revenue</p>
<p>and use your own money and go nice and slow</p>
<p>and grow 10% a year,</p>
<p>the chances of you blowing up the rocket are very low</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re riding a bicycle.</p>
<p>You can go a little faster,</p>
<p>but the bicycle can only go so fast.</p>
<p>And once you start taking that money,</p>
<p>the way venture capital is constructed</p>
<p>as in the mix of like MIT or Harvard&rsquo;s endowments is,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to put some money into safe things</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>these really binary things over here.</p>
<p>And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grown to 20% just as a function</p>
<p>of how successful it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>So, you know, the Harvards of the world and MIT</p>
<p>is probably want five or 10% in venture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s grown to 25% because, you know,</p>
<p>companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla.</p>
<p>But the goal is in these venture funds,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to invest in 30 names</p>
<p>and one or two of them are going to return three times</p>
<p>the capital we&rsquo;ve deployed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a $300 million fund and there&rsquo;s 30 names</p>
<p>and they each got 10 million.</p>
<p>That means one of the 10 million</p>
<p>is going to return the fund plus.</p>
<p>So that means it has to grow 30X and then 60X</p>
<p>to double the fund.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re really supposed to be doing</p>
<p>three times cash on cash.</p>
<p>So that $300 million funds,</p>
<p>the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 million,</p>
<p>triple the person&rsquo;s money as opposed to the stock market,</p>
<p>which doubles your money in the same period.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re supposed to do 25% annualized returns</p>
<p>in order to triple the money.</p>
<p>And maybe I have an outlying chance</p>
<p>of four or five times the money,</p>
<p>which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier</p>
<p>in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was.</p>
<p>And what that means is the venture capitalist behavior</p>
<p>in the game they&rsquo;re playing is different</p>
<p>than you as the founder.</p>
<p>You as the founder, you may really care about this</p>
<p>and it dying really matters to you.</p>
<p>And then you got a venture capitalist who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re betting on 30 names,</p>
<p>we need two of them to hit it out of the park, maybe three,</p>
<p>and nothing else is meaningful.</p>
<p>So now you start thinking about the game theory there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dealing with money that is coming in</p>
<p>that only cares about you going 100X.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different ball game.</p>
<p>Whereas if you build off revenue, you don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>And if you look at a company like com.com,</p>
<p>we invested at 5 million, the next round they did was 250.</p>
<p>They were so capital efficient</p>
<p>that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue</p>
<p>to millions of dollars a month in revenue</p>
<p>over those four years since we invested</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t raise money in between.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve only seen this happen three or four times.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t happen all this capital efficient meaning</p>
<p>based on customer revenue alone</p>
<p>plus some small amount of fundraising, you&rsquo;re able to go.</p>
<p>Like how hard is it to do that?</p>
<p>It takes extreme product market fit.</p>
<p>You have to have a great price for your product</p>
<p>that has a great margin.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you&rsquo;re doing something in hardware,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably impossible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s super capital intensive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably gotta be a software business.</p>
<p>Hardware businesses take a lot more.</p>
<p>Do venture capitals get in the way at all of the business</p>
<p>or is it possible to get out of the way?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you get young venture capitalists</p>
<p>who are starting their career,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very nervous and scared</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re putting all these bets.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a very weird thing that happens.</p>
<p>The bad news comes first.</p>
<p>So companies that don&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>go out of business immediately.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not gonna be Com or Robinhood or Uber,</p>
<p>you know you have one of those great successes</p>
<p>somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor.</p>
<p>What is the first five years like?</p>
<p>First five years, you feel like an idiot.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you make these 10 bets.</p>
<p>In year two, two or three of them come back</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have product market fit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out of money.</p>
<p>And they say, can we have more money?</p>
<p>You say, no, we have to go get it from somebody else</p>
<p>because you have to prove</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s still a market for it.</p>
<p>We may keep our pro rata.</p>
<p>We may put a little bit in</p>
<p>to maintain our percentage ownership,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not going to give you another big chunk of money.</p>
<p>And that company dies.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got 10 million, poof, up in smoke.</p>
<p>Boom, 10 million up in smoke.</p>
<p>So this is called the J curve</p>
<p>where your performance goes down.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s only in years four or five and six</p>
<p>it starts going up.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re seeing right now is the people</p>
<p>who started like I did in 2000,</p>
<p>you know, just 11, 12 years ago.</p>
<p>In 2009, I started investing.</p>
<p>We all look like geniuses.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at the end of the cycle.</p>
<p>We invested after when the stock market was on the floor</p>
<p>after the financial crisis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gone straight up since.</p>
<p>So everybody looked,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of little blips in there,</p>
<p>but generally speaking,</p>
<p>there hasn&rsquo;t been like a major crash</p>
<p>with the exception of the pandemic crash,</p>
<p>but that bounced right back.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it takes a decade to figure out</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re good at it.</p>
<p>And then if the market crashes again,</p>
<p>everybody feels like an idiot again,</p>
<p>the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>So you are now as a founder,</p>
<p>you are now inserting yourself into that casino.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ve got all these other forces</p>
<p>pushing and pulling.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re growing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say your company was growing 50%.</p>
<p>You feel like, wow, I&rsquo;m successful.</p>
<p>I made a million dollars last year.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m doing a million and a half.</p>
<p>And the first thing a VC is gonna say to you is,</p>
<p>how do we triple?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re growing too slow.</p>
<p>See, but that&rsquo;s, like you said,</p>
<p>that beautifully is a rocket fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, in a sense, it&rsquo;s a kind of motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a drive.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a positive.</p>
<p>So if you want that.</p>
<p>Yes, if you want that.</p>
<p>If you want that,</p>
<p>if you want to go to Navy SEAL school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be in pain</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna put that hose in your face</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re underwater</p>
<p>with your hands tied behind your back in the pool</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be choking.</p>
<p>And they may have to do CPR on you.</p>
<p>And like every couple of years, tragically,</p>
<p>somebody dies in Navy SEAL school.</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>Does it mean we&rsquo;re getting rid of the Navy SEALs?</p>
<p>Brock, if he dies, he dies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know David Goggins</p>
<p>as by any chance.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know him personally,</p>
<p>but oh my Lord.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m running 48 miles together with him in person</p>
<p>in a month.</p>
<p>What, you&rsquo;re doing an ultra marathon?</p>
<p>With him and probably other stuff</p>
<p>because he enjoys just breaking people,</p>
<p>making them cry.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;m so jelly.</p>
<p>So no, well, I offered,</p>
<p>we agreed a while ago to do a podcast</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, come, we&rsquo;ll do it this day.</p>
<p>Is he in the Bay Area?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the hell he is,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m supposed to say where it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not anywhere close to anywhere of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>But he seems to be in a bunch of different locations.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s in Oregon or something like that.</p>
<p>What does he do for outside of writing books</p>
<p>and being inspirational?</p>
<p>Does he actually train people or like?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s a full time insane.</p>
<p>Like he fights forest fires like for a few months a year</p>
<p>as a farmer, like unpaid labor.</p>
<p>Like he, you know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are like him, like Navy Seals and so on</p>
<p>that kind of make a career,</p>
<p>automotivational speak and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not interested in any of that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s literally interested in just doing hard shit</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>Breaking himself.</p>
<p>Breaking himself personally.</p>
<p>He seems like he wants to break himself.</p>
<p>And that book is amazing.</p>
<p>And the audio book&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s talking about how fat he was</p>
<p>and how he just had to go and keep running</p>
<p>and his like legs are broken and he&rsquo;s just super pain</p>
<p>and he just goes through it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>Inspiring thing also.</p>
<p>You could have videotaped yourself doing this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see you get destroyed.</p>
<p>This is gonna be so entertaining for the lax audience.</p>
<p>The pain.</p>
<p>But the other inspiring thing is he&rsquo;s happily married</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a partnership there that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>everybody finds this attention as a push and pull</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful, I think.</p>
<p>But in speaking of a beautiful push and pull,</p>
<p>how about that transition?</p>
<p>Yeah, here we go.</p>
<p>You and Chamath on, he&rsquo;s a friend of yours.</p>
<p>Besties. Besties, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, good friend.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s very few people in my life,</p>
<p>him, Elon, David Sachs, John Brockmans.</p>
<p>Very few people have supported me as much as those folks.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a huge debt.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s also cohost on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>We taped episode 21 today.</p>
<p>Oh, today?</p>
<p>Yeah, every Friday now.</p>
<p>They wanna do every Friday.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re addicted like me and you are to podcasts.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to release it when?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably released as we&rsquo;re sitting here.</p>
<p>Okay, beautiful.</p>
<p>Special guest on it.</p>
<p>We had Draymond Green from the Warriors phone in.</p>
<p>So we had our first guest.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really funny</p>
<p>because he plays poker with us and we&rsquo;re all besties, so.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>So you guys went pretty heated against each other</p>
<p>versus on Robin Hood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just two things I wanna ask.</p>
<p>First, on the actual Robin Hood discussion</p>
<p>and the Wall Street Best discussion,</p>
<p>can you steel man his argument?</p>
<p>What was the nature of the disagreement?</p>
<p>Where, yeah, what is the little,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big as spaces</p>
<p>it came off as sounding.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the disagreement?</p>
<p>He felt that Robin Hood turned off trading</p>
<p>because the hedge funds told them to</p>
<p>and that they were bowing down</p>
<p>to the pressure of the hedge funds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true, but in a vacuum of information,</p>
<p>you know what happens to people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>conspiracy theories abound.</p>
<p>And sometimes there is a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>and sometimes there&rsquo;s just the appearance of impropriety</p>
<p>or a bunch of related things.</p>
<p>Like when you look at the Trump situation with Russia,</p>
<p>like was Trump trying to coordinate with Russia</p>
<p>or the Russians just screwing with a bunch of like neophyte</p>
<p>idiotic dipshits like Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know any better.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t know that you shouldn&rsquo;t meet with the Russians</p>
<p>and if you do meet with the Russians,</p>
<p>you are probably a useful idiot.</p>
<p>You probably should tell the FBI.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re just a bunch of idiots in all likelihood,</p>
<p>who knows?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a vacuum of information.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a vacuum of information, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the Russians are trying to compromise everybody.</p>
<p>So would you call it a conspiracy</p>
<p>or would you call it an attempted conspiracy?</p>
<p>There was no conspiracy here.</p>
<p>What it was was Robin Hood needed to raise billions</p>
<p>of dollars to say solvent in all likelihood.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>So they were forced into not talking about it</p>
<p>in all likelihood and had to come up with that money</p>
<p>or shut down.</p>
<p>And then what got me upset with Chamath</p>
<p>and we had a talk afterwards that people don&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about it here for the first time.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we had to have a little, we had to air it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the episode after you guys sound like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had a private, you&rsquo;ve made up.</p>
<p>We had a private discussion, just one on one.</p>
<p>And we said, listen, we love each other, we&rsquo;re besties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been there for each other.</p>
<p>What happened here?</p>
<p>And what happened there is I&rsquo;m fiercely loyal to my folks,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Chamath or Travis from Uber or Saks or whoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a loyal guy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always ride or die with my founders.</p>
<p>If I invest in them, even if they make a mistake</p>
<p>and Uber made plenty of mistakes,</p>
<p>I always went on CNBC, on my podcast and said,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re gonna fix these things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in touch with the team.</p>
<p>Mistakes were made, we&rsquo;re gonna solve them.</p>
<p>This is a group of people with great intent</p>
<p>who want to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I was hated for a period of time with Uber.</p>
<p>I was hated for it last week with Robinhood.</p>
<p>I got a lot of blowback.</p>
<p>But I think in both of those cases, eventually I was right.</p>
<p>Uber is doing great stuff in the world.</p>
<p>Robinhood is doing great stuff in the world.</p>
<p>And I like to be loyal to my investments</p>
<p>and my partners to just,</p>
<p>I feel like if you invest and you&rsquo;re on the team,</p>
<p>you have really three choices.</p>
<p>You either fight for your team, you can go silent,</p>
<p>or you can throw your team under the bus.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve watched investors throw the team</p>
<p>that they invested in that made them a bunch of money</p>
<p>under the bus, not acceptable to me.</p>
<p>And being quiet&rsquo;s not acceptable to me.</p>
<p>So I always ask the founder, do you want me to,</p>
<p>is it okay if I go out and defend you publicly?</p>
<p>If they say yes, I do it.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful, by the way,</p>
<p>because what else do we have in this world</p>
<p>if not friendship?</p>
<p>Loyalty means everything to me.</p>
<p>I grew up in Brooklyn where if you were not loyal</p>
<p>and you were not loyal to your crew,</p>
<p>then you were a Ronin.</p>
<p>You were out there on your own flailing in the,</p>
<p>trust me, you do not want to be on your own</p>
<p>in 1970s, 80s, Brooklyn, Manhattan.</p>
<p>You need to have a crew with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten into, you don&rsquo;t want to get into a fight</p>
<p>with 10 guys and be alone or just be with,</p>
<p>you need a crew to survive.</p>
<p>So I just learned early on, my dad owned a bar,</p>
<p>just drilled into me being loyal.</p>
<p>And so for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bulldog when it comes to loyalty.</p>
<p>And Shemov came out and said,</p>
<p>these guys need to go to jail and they&rsquo;re scumbags.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to defend them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in a position where I can&rsquo;t defend them</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have complete information.</p>
<p>There is no complete information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>And then it becomes the number one story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s my number three investment.</p>
<p>And Shemov has a competing company, SoFi.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s killing my guys.</p>
<p>And then I started killing his guys.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wait a second, we&rsquo;re best friends.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re swinging our swords at each other.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re a group of the seven samurai who fight together.</p>
<p>When did we turn on each other?</p>
<p>And then everybody else who&rsquo;s on the pod,</p>
<p>the two Davids, you know, both on the spectrum a bit,</p>
<p>they got a little Asperger&rsquo;s or whatever.</p>
<p>No offense, Les.</p>
<p>None taken.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying, you know,</p>
<p>but there is, you&rsquo;re into AI and you might be somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence, yeah.</p>
<p>Might not be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Anyway, we upgraded the two Davids firmware.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna upgrade your firmware after this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you, yeah, you&rsquo;re on the 1.5.</p>
<p>You have the three emotions now.</p>
<p>Or should we add a fourth?</p>
<p>Do you wanna go with joy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the 2.0 already.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the 2.0, you got the joy.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it working out for you, the joy chip?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful. It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Just let it happen, Lex.</p>
<p>Just let the joy happen.</p>
<p>So anyway, we just talked about it offline</p>
<p>and we decided like, listen,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t pregame that episode.</p>
<p>And I happened to be skiing with my family.</p>
<p>I had taken the first like vacation</p>
<p>since this goddamn pandemic started.</p>
<p>And I was having a wonderful time.</p>
<p>And then this whole thing blows up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming off the mountain,</p>
<p>just having a great time with my daughter skiing.</p>
<p>And you know, and then I&rsquo;m mixing it up with him.</p>
<p>And you know, he had a short fuse about it</p>
<p>because he was triggered, he told me,</p>
<p>because he really feels like he&rsquo;s fighting</p>
<p>to defend, you know, the every man.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s what my team&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they named the company Robinhood.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the same side here.</p>
<p>And then over time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve started to see the explanation come out.</p>
<p>And you know, people who are friends</p>
<p>are gonna have disagreements.</p>
<p>In the podcast, it happened to happen very publicly.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna become</p>
<p>the number one story in the world.</p>
<p>If Trump still had his Twitter handle,</p>
<p>this would not have been a story.</p>
<p>Trump would have said something about GameStop</p>
<p>and he would have coopted the entire conversation.</p>
<p>So in a way, going back to our censorship discussion,</p>
<p>I might actually be in favor of Trump being censored</p>
<p>only because how delightful has it been since January 20th</p>
<p>that we can all focus on something other than him.</p>
<p>He was exhausting.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of cycles he took on our processors.</p>
<p>He monetized the conversation.</p>
<p>And now this is a little bit more of a distributed,</p>
<p>like this bunch of.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody gets a chance</p>
<p>to be the number one news story.</p>
<p>Everybody gets a chance to discuss it.</p>
<p>So on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love Chamath?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s 11.</p>
<p>I mean, I love Chamath.</p>
<p>I mean, we played cards last night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re besties.</p>
<p>And you know, I would literally jump</p>
<p>in front of a bullet for him.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the lesson in that discussion?</p>
<p>Because it was super, I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think the love was felt and the respect was felt</p>
<p>throughout even when you guys</p>
<p>are going pretty vicious on each other.</p>
<p>Is there a lesson to be learned?</p>
<p>Do you regret any of that conversation?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think he told me</p>
<p>that he regretted some of the things he said.</p>
<p>He said publicly on the podcast,</p>
<p>like, listen, I was a little hot.</p>
<p>I may have said things in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t live with too much regret</p>
<p>because I always think about intent.</p>
<p>As one of the nuance and intent have been totally lost.</p>
<p>The idea that we could have any kind of a nuanced discussion</p>
<p>about things seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p>And the fact that people don&rsquo;t look at people&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p>If you hurt somebody&rsquo;s feelings or you disrespect somebody</p>
<p>or you do something mean or whatever,</p>
<p>I always look at the intent, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had people attack me and I look at the intent</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, that person feels bad about themselves.</p>
<p>Or maybe I said something and I insulted them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why their blowback&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So I always try to think what&rsquo;s the intent of the person.</p>
<p>And then almost universally,</p>
<p>you talk to somebody and you find out,</p>
<p>you ascribe some crazy intent that&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, you know what happened?</p>
<p>I got in a fight with my spouse</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t sleep last night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had a lot of anxiety about my business.</p>
<p>And I just snapped and said something about you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Like I literally had somebody on Twitter this past summer.</p>
<p>I had said something.</p>
<p>I was complaining about a New York Times journalist</p>
<p>and something I thought was wrong.</p>
<p>And this person was a fan of that journalist.</p>
<p>And they went, I kid you not, onto my social media account,</p>
<p>found a picture I&rsquo;d taken about how blue the sky was one day.</p>
<p>They reverse image search the tree line,</p>
<p>found the tree line on Google image search somehow</p>
<p>with a reverse image search,</p>
<p>found an old listing that some broker had listed</p>
<p>on their website of my house,</p>
<p>and then posted my home address, the value of my home,</p>
<p>and doxxed me on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what is going on here?</p>
<p>So I call the person and I look them up</p>
<p>and they work in private equity in Boston.</p>
<p>And I look and I&rsquo;m like, this person works in Boston.</p>
<p>This is July 4th week.</p>
<p>So, and when I look at the person&rsquo;s LinkedIn,</p>
<p>we have seven people in common.</p>
<p>So going back to the AR conversation real quick,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, this person literally just doxxed me.</p>
<p>I asked them to take it down.</p>
<p>They told me they won&rsquo;t take it down.</p>
<p>And then I look at it.</p>
<p>So then I DM him back on Instagram, on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I said, by the way, your boss, Susan,</p>
<p>and I know seven people in common.</p>
<p>And these are the seven people.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot.</p>
<p>What is she going to think when I call her on Monday</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve doxxed me?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my phone number if you&rsquo;d like to talk.</p>
<p>He calls me.</p>
<p>I said, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Why would you do this?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, I really pissed off</p>
<p>about what you said about this person.</p>
<p>I was like, you understand I&rsquo;ve had like two</p>
<p>or three stalkers and anybody who&rsquo;s a high profile</p>
<p>like I am or medium profile,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have weird things happen.</p>
<p>You literally put my home address.</p>
<p>You put my family at risk.</p>
<p>What if I put your home address on my,</p>
<p>I have 400,000 followers or 300,000 followers.</p>
<p>You have like 300.</p>
<p>What if I post your address?</p>
<p>He said, well, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I was like, well, I asked you kindly</p>
<p>to take my address down.</p>
<p>And I said, are you married?</p>
<p>I said, how old are you?</p>
<p>Are you like 25 or something?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m 42.</p>
<p>I was like, you&rsquo;re 42 years old.</p>
<p>I was like, are you married?</p>
<p>Do you have kids?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I just had a baby like six months ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re home with your wife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s July 4th weekend.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doxxing Jason Calagans because you&rsquo;re upset at me</p>
<p>because I said something about a New York Times writer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, this is the biggest mistake of my life.</p>
<p>I said, I tell you what, let&rsquo;s forget it ever happened.</p>
<p>And he wrote me back and he said,</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for how you handled it.</p>
<p>My wife said I&rsquo;m a complete fucking moron.</p>
<p>And he literally sent me an email.</p>
<p>My wife says I&rsquo;m a complete fucking moron.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And I wrote her back.</p>
<p>I said, I wrote her back and I said,</p>
<p>my wife says the same thing to me all the time.</p>
<p>I said, welcome to the club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>But intent, nuance, it matters, right?</p>
<p>And the person could be having a bad day</p>
<p>and they do something stupid they regret.</p>
<p>And what am I gonna do, cancel the guy?</p>
<p>Or if I had called his boss,</p>
<p>he would have been fired immediately.</p>
<p>And then I got to live with this guy got fired</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a kid.</p>
<p>And what is this personal destruction?</p>
<p>Why are we doing this to each other?</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s hard enough.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s hard, right?</p>
<p>Like just getting through the day is hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that little bit of empathy,</p>
<p>thinking about the intent of the person</p>
<p>allows you to then sort of deescalate</p>
<p>this kind of conversation</p>
<p>that social media wants to escalate.</p>
<p>Yes, back to what we were saying.</p>
<p>If this, in my younger years,</p>
<p>I would have retweeted the guy&rsquo;s home address</p>
<p>and my address and would have called his boss</p>
<p>and tried to get him fired or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, now I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>why are we attacking each other?</p>
<p>Life is so hard.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what the pandemic,</p>
<p>I think we should make everybody realize is like,</p>
<p>look at how hard it is.</p>
<p>Life is hard.</p>
<p>And then just think about all the people suffering right now</p>
<p>who are at home, the single mom or dad</p>
<p>with two or three kids at home in public school.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve been laid off</p>
<p>and their kids aren&rsquo;t learning</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in a tiny apartment.</p>
<p>I mean, this has been brutal for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Not to mention people losing loved ones</p>
<p>or maybe some people got Corona</p>
<p>and now their lungs are still not right.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about love?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling it, you know,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re an hour or two here, Lex.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re feeling it.</p>
<p>Feeling like we could become besties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting it.</p>
<p>I feel like we got a bromance going here, Lex.</p>
<p>I feel it too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s Eric Weinstein level,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m feeling the love.</p>
<p>But we talked about those music to my ears,</p>
<p>your whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.</p>
<p>Is there a role,</p>
<p>like what role does love, family, friendship</p>
<p>play in that brutal pursuit of excellence</p>
<p>that is building a startup, building a company</p>
<p>or creating anything new in this world?</p>
<p>Such a great question and totally unprepared for it.</p>
<p>Because nobody would ever ask me about that.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got quite a following</p>
<p>on your podcast is that you&rsquo;re able to ask these questions.</p>
<p>And I can tell one story because, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk about,</p>
<p>I try not to talk about relationship with Elon that often</p>
<p>because, you know, he&rsquo;s so famous now.</p>
<p>I mean, when we met, I used to go out to parties with him</p>
<p>and people were like, oh my God, you&rsquo;re Jason Calacas.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And like, who&rsquo;s your friend?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s my friend, Elon.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, what, he&rsquo;s doing rocket ships?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s told this story publicly.</p>
<p>So I can tell it,</p>
<p>and I would never talk about anything</p>
<p>that he hasn&rsquo;t already talked about publicly,</p>
<p>especially since he&rsquo;s so high profile,</p>
<p>but it was pretty funny moment.</p>
<p>There was a moment in time</p>
<p>when Tesla almost went out of business</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve probably heard the story many times,</p>
<p>but it was during the financial crisis</p>
<p>and they were running out of money.</p>
<p>And they said, you know, let&rsquo;s go get a steak.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in LA and we drove to BOA</p>
<p>and I had my orange Tesla Roadster</p>
<p>and he had his P1 or P2, like the red one</p>
<p>that I think is in space now.</p>
<p>And we drove to the valet and we had a steak together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sitting there.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, I read the story</p>
<p>and Gawker or whatever, you know,</p>
<p>and New York Times here,</p>
<p>you only got like five weeks of money left in Tesla.</p>
<p>He goes, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, thank God.</p>
<p>He goes, we have two weeks.</p>
<p>I was like, oh God.</p>
<p>I was like, well, what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with the rocket ship company?</p>
<p>You know, like, you know, I know you did the one last month</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you have one coming up?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;ve got the third one coming up.</p>
<p>I was like, well, how&rsquo;s that going?</p>
<p>I said, well, we blow that one up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more SpaceX.</p>
<p>I was like, so two weeks of money left in Tesla</p>
<p>and SpaceX, you blew up the first two rockets,</p>
<p>you blow up the third SpaceX, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, I can loan you a couple million dollars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have like a ton.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Our friend, beep, has loaned me some money.</p>
<p>And Elon&rsquo;s been super public about this.</p>
<p>I would never tell the story unless he hadn&rsquo;t been,</p>
<p>but he was talking, he never said who it was,</p>
<p>but somebody had loaned him money to keep him afloat.</p>
<p>He was functionally bankrupt.</p>
<p>I mean, he had the equity in the companies,</p>
<p>but the equity was quickly becoming worth zero</p>
<p>and the financial crisis.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s figuring out if he&rsquo;s going to go on vacation</p>
<p>for Christmas or not.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s on the phone trying to, you know,</p>
<p>save both companies.</p>
<p>And I said, certainly there must be some good news.</p>
<p>And he takes out his Blackberry to date this conversation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know iPhones.</p>
<p>Takes out his Blackberry and he starts swiping.</p>
<p>And he says, don&rsquo;t tell anybody.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m building.</p>
<p>And he shows me the Model S.</p>
<p>And nobody knew that he was working on the Model S.</p>
<p>We knew he was doing the roadster</p>
<p>and he was trying to save the company.</p>
<p>And I looked at it and I was like, that&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>It was the clay models.</p>
<p>So it was a full size clay model.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s human beings standing around a clay version</p>
<p>of this tiny little Blackberry picture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scrolling through on the,</p>
<p>remember that little pad or the ball on the Blackberry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scrolling through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is fucking great.</p>
<p>And I just said to him, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the range going to be?</p>
<p>He says, well, I think we get 250 miles.</p>
<p>I was like, 250 miles?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I think it&rsquo;d be the safest car ever.</p>
<p>I said, what is it going to cost?</p>
<p>He says, I think this could cost eventually 50, $60,000.</p>
<p>I said, Elon, if you make that car,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll change the goddamn world.</p>
<p>You have to, this company must survive</p>
<p>because the roadsters for like 2000 people in United States,</p>
<p>this car is for every person in the United States.</p>
<p>Every single person in the United States</p>
<p>will want this car if it&rsquo;s $50,000.</p>
<p>And maybe some of the people who have 20 or 30,000 dollars</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be able to afford it, but they&rsquo;ll all want it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>And he said, you really think so?</p>
<p>I said, yeah.</p>
<p>So I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade,</p>
<p>and I said, do you have the checkbook?</p>
<p>She does all the finances and stuff like that,</p>
<p>pays the bills and whatever.</p>
<p>And I said, don&rsquo;t tell anybody,</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s making this great car.</p>
<p>And I wrote two checks for $50,000.</p>
<p>And I just took out this paper and I wrote,</p>
<p>E, comma, love the new car, I&rsquo;ll take two.</p>
<p>And I signed it.</p>
<p>I kissed the two $50,000 checks, put them in the envelope,</p>
<p>and I FedExed it to him for Monday delivery.</p>
<p>And I said to Jade, that $100,000 is going to be gone</p>
<p>in 48 hours because it will pay for one or two days</p>
<p>of payroll on Tesla.</p>
<p>So we just added like, instead of two weeks of runway,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got 12 days.</p>
<p>And the checks don&rsquo;t cash, but then I read a story</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s closed the money, saved the company</p>
<p>in like the next week or two.</p>
<p>And a couple of months later, the checks get cashed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>Three years later, I get an email,</p>
<p>your reservation number, it&rsquo;s from Tesla,</p>
<p>your reservation number is 0000001.</p>
<p>And then five seconds later,</p>
<p>your reservation number is 000073.</p>
<p>And I forwarded the number one to Elon,</p>
<p>I said, you know, I can&rsquo;t take number one,</p>
<p>a signature number one, I can&rsquo;t take that, that&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, I got five of them.</p>
<p>And besides, you&rsquo;re the first person who ordered it.</p>
<p>And I was the first person who had seen it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get me to be teary eyed.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>No, it was a very&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful moment.</p>
<p>It was an incredible moment for both of us.</p>
<p>And we talk about it sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>those moments in time.</p>
<p>And to your point about love, Elon&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the darkest moment,</p>
<p>one of the darkest moments in his life probably.</p>
<p>I think it was, I can tell you,</p>
<p>it was the darkest period of his life for sure.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been very public about how dark that was.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, this is why I have great sympathy</p>
<p>for the entrepreneurs of the world,</p>
<p>like the suffering and the pain.</p>
<p>And when he talks about the suffering and the pain</p>
<p>that all of these founders have felt,</p>
<p>and then we were throwing rocks at them</p>
<p>or criticizing them as they try to change the world</p>
<p>and save humanity, and in Tesla&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>I mean, they weren&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t like delivering pizza.</p>
<p>I mean, they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Like this was a big, heady mission</p>
<p>to literally save the environment, the planet, humanity.</p>
<p>And the way they shorted that stock and they attacked him,</p>
<p>it was always perplexing to me why any human being</p>
<p>who is standing on God&rsquo;s green earth</p>
<p>would want to throw rocks at the guy</p>
<p>who is trying to stem the dam of global warming</p>
<p>that is about to engulf all of us.</p>
<p>How dare they throw rocks at that guy?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people you could throw rocks at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s making the Juul vaporizer,</p>
<p>throw rocks at that scumbag, no offense.</p>
<p>But like whoever&rsquo;s making the Juul things</p>
<p>and is, you know, selling pina colada flavor</p>
<p>to 12 year olds, like throw rocks at them.</p>
<p>Somebody is doing something, you know, abhorrent,</p>
<p>but not E, I mean, and yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, that car is, you know, up the road here,</p>
<p>sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my garage.</p>
<p>And then the Roadster number 16 is in the garage next to it.</p>
<p>And every day I walk by the two of them</p>
<p>and I get a warm feeling in my heart</p>
<p>because I know he did it.</p>
<p>Against all odds, against all odds, he pulled it off.</p>
<p>And it was that moment, that month in that 2000,</p>
<p>I think it was probably December, January,</p>
<p>December of 2008, I think.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just 12 years ago</p>
<p>when you think about 13 years ago, it was dark.</p>
<p>I mean, it was dark.</p>
<p>And they almost had the same thing happen,</p>
<p>you know, in the Model 3 production</p>
<p>in June of two years, three years ago.</p>
<p>And I remember him just trying to get the Model 3</p>
<p>out the door and the company almost crashed then.</p>
<p>Most of these companies have, you know,</p>
<p>these kinds of moments.</p>
<p>And I think friendship is you get what you give,</p>
<p>you get what you give.</p>
<p>And if you are there for people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel so good about having done that.</p>
<p>And then the reciprocation effect,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;d probably know very well,</p>
<p>is so great in the world that anytime you&rsquo;re kind to people,</p>
<p>you build this incredible bond.</p>
<p>And then what are we at the end of the day, Lex,</p>
<p>besides a series of memories with the people we love?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a series of memories and moments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just moments.</p>
<p>You ever see Blade Runner?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>Do you remember what Rucker Harris says at the end,</p>
<p>all of these memories gone, like tears in the rain?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s our existence.</p>
<p>It just all goes away at some point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just these drops of rain.</p>
<p>Each of those memories,</p>
<p>just like one snowflake or one drop of rain,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all lost at some point, but they&rsquo;re here now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have to be there for each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I feel like what I do</p>
<p>is so important in this world.</p>
<p>And I get such great meaning out of it.</p>
<p>Just being a friend, just having these conversations.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing on your podcast,</p>
<p>just talking to intelligent people</p>
<p>and spreading the word and the gospel</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re saying and amplifying it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inspiring so many people.</p>
<p>Every podcast, you get 500,000 people,</p>
<p>a million people watch these videos.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some kid in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>or some little girl in Afghanistan</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna stumble upon this on YouTube,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna change the world in the next century.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just about America.</p>
<p>Our story&rsquo;s almost over, right?</p>
<p>We were the story of the last two or 300 years.</p>
<p>I hope it keeps going.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s all these other places in the world,</p>
<p>Sao Paulo and Africa,</p>
<p>where people now have access to these videos.</p>
<p>And somebody will hear this video and go,</p>
<p>Elon did it.</p>
<p>Oh, and that guy Jason was his friend.</p>
<p>And, oh, and Lex does those interviews with him.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I could do it too.</p>
<p>Your little magical moment of love</p>
<p>amidst the suffering with Elon</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve talked about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have these ripple effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think about in decades to come.</p>
<p>And new entrepreneurs being born,</p>
<p>new, more love being put out there,</p>
<p>and more support through these rough times</p>
<p>when people are trying to create new things.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing, that&rsquo;s a beautiful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you think of friendship in this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply grateful that you&rsquo;re loyal.</p>
<p>Every time you invest.</p>
<p>In the way you are.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>it costs you nothing to make this investment either.</p>
<p>The amount of time it takes to be bitter or angry,</p>
<p>sitting at home, to be disappointed,</p>
<p>you could just channel that same amount of energy</p>
<p>into being loyal, loving, kind, and there for people.</p>
<p>It just only takes the intention, right?</p>
<p>The water is gonna, those emotions are gonna flow, right?</p>
<p>Like Sam would always tell me</p>
<p>when I was struggling in my life and I talked to him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say, you know, Jason,</p>
<p>your brain is spewing all these ideas.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re standing, sitting by a river,</p>
<p>and the river is all your ideas.</p>
<p>You are not a slave to any one of these ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just whipping by</p>
<p>like each of those little waves in the river.</p>
<p>You can pick one of those ideas out</p>
<p>and look at it and examine it,</p>
<p>and either keep it,</p>
<p>or throw it back in the river and let it go.</p>
<p>And I was like, wow, Sam, that was like,</p>
<p>of my entire friendship with Sam Harris,</p>
<p>that was like the one moment where I was just like,</p>
<p>oh my God, all my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about all these thoughts in my head,</p>
<p>insecurities, you know, imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t go to MIT, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the smartest guy,</p>
<p>but somehow I made a career writing little 50K checks</p>
<p>and now, you know, $3 million checks,</p>
<p>but whatever, you know, little checks</p>
<p>and being a journalist and doing this little podcast,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ended up to something.</p>
<p>And I kind of, I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 50 and I&rsquo;m kind of proud of what I did.</p>
<p>And I wake up every morning after I retired,</p>
<p>I say, I kind of like what I do.</p>
<p>I kind of like having the conversation</p>
<p>and writing the check and then being on somebody&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>And I got offered to be in these giant mega funds</p>
<p>and they said, Jason, you&rsquo;re in it,</p>
<p>you invest in 60 companies a year,</p>
<p>you know, 500K at a time,</p>
<p>you put $30 million a year to work, come work with us,</p>
<p>write one $50 million check</p>
<p>and then you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella</p>
<p>and not work.</p>
<p>But why are you doing all this work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, the $50 million check</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s like a formality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like being an ATM,</p>
<p>like the companies are already huge by that time.</p>
<p>I really want to meet the two people with the idea.</p>
<p>I want to meet them in year one.</p>
<p>I want to meet them on day zero.</p>
<p>I want to be the guy who wrote the first,</p>
<p>second or third check.</p>
<p>I want a guy who wrote the 3000th check, the last check.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking boring.</p>
<p>And make that basic human connection</p>
<p>and also be with them through the rough times,</p>
<p>be with them with that first,</p>
<p>I mean, the first early successes,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a beautiful.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>When a founder and that team get product market fit</p>
<p>and you just know it&rsquo;s going to work,</p>
<p>oh man, Lex, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>when Comm would email me and they&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>we added, you know, the company&rsquo;s been growing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not going to go out of business,</p>
<p>but we added some sleep stuff</p>
<p>and then we added this other function</p>
<p>and we have a streak now and we grew 10X</p>
<p>in the last, you know, three months.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>You know, I was like, ah, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a nice feeling when you,</p>
<p>well, because so many of them die.</p>
<p>We talked about that J curve early.</p>
<p>Imagine it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all these baby turtles going out to the ocean</p>
<p>and the seagulls are ripping them to shreds</p>
<p>and then the sharks are eating them.</p>
<p>But then like a couple of the turtles make it</p>
<p>and they become wise old 100 year old turtles, you know?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yep, I remember when you catched</p>
<p>and like all of your brothers and sisters</p>
<p>were ripped to shreds by the seagulls</p>
<p>and you made it into the water.</p>
<p>And then you made it out to the deep water.</p>
<p>Pretty great feeling.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better way to end it.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>The talk of the cruelty of life,</p>
<p>that suffering that is life</p>
<p>and the love amidst the suffering.</p>
<p>Jason, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for a long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most special people in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>And maybe you&rsquo;ll also call me in one of the rough times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many.</p>
<p>There will be, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one expression, nobody gets there alone.</p>
<p>Nobody gets there alone.</p>
<p>And anybody who thinks that they got there alone</p>
<p>is delusional and kidding themselves.</p>
<p>And they will at some point wake up and realize,</p>
<p>oh shit, there were a lot of people helped me get here.</p>
<p>I need to write a couple of gratitude letters.</p>
<p>I got a gratitude letter the other day</p>
<p>from a friend of mine who I helped.</p>
<p>And I was one of the,</p>
<p>you know about these gratitude letters people are writing?</p>
<p>It turns out Martin Seligman in, was it Authentic Happiness?</p>
<p>Anyway, the guy who really studied happiness and joy,</p>
<p>turns out one of the greatest amplifiers of joy in your life</p>
<p>is to thank somebody for doing something for you.</p>
<p>And somebody who I had helped just wrote me a letter</p>
<p>and I got in Christmas</p>
<p>and I had the stack of Christmas cards</p>
<p>and I hadn&rsquo;t opened them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the second week of January</p>
<p>and I was just getting to like the last stack</p>
<p>and I open it up and I almost missed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly heartwarming letter</p>
<p>about how meaningful like certain things I had done</p>
<p>to help along the way</p>
<p>and how he&rsquo;d always appreciated my counsel.</p>
<p>And I was just like, well, this happened 25 years ago</p>
<p>and you wrote this letter now.</p>
<p>And it just hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>I was just like, wow, you know, if you&rsquo;re hearing this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably 10 people</p>
<p>who are really instrumental in your lives, in your lives.</p>
<p>Go ahead and call them on the phone,</p>
<p>write them an email or even better,</p>
<p>just write a letter and send it to them</p>
<p>and just tell them you&rsquo;re thankful.</p>
<p>And let me tell you something,</p>
<p>the amplification of joy in your life will go a hundred X,</p>
<p>a hundred X when you tell somebody you love them</p>
<p>and that you really appreciate them</p>
<p>and that what they did for you was magical.</p>
<p>So just, and you can look it up, gratitude.</p>
<p>Gratitude is like one of these incredible forces.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for being on the pod.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful you wasted all this time with me.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
