    <p>The following is a conversation with Hikaru Nakamura,</p>
<p>a chess super grandmaster.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest chess players in the world,</p>
<p>including currently being ranked world number one</p>
<p>in blitz chess.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also one of the most popular chess streamers</p>
<p>on Twitch and YouTube,</p>
<p>which you should definitely check out.</p>
<p>His channel&rsquo;s name on both is GM Hikaru.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Mizzen and Main for style,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>NetSuite for business management software,</p>
<p>and SimpliSafe for home security.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I tried to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Mizzen and Main,</p>
<p>the maker of comfortable, stylish dress shirts</p>
<p>and other menswear, and the maker of a brand name</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for some reason really fun to say.</p>
<p>Mizzen and Main.</p>
<p>Mizzen and Main.</p>
<p>With a plus between the Mizzen and the Main.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of fancy, sexy, comfortable dress shirts,</p>
<p>but I just have their black dress shirt,</p>
<p>which I guess is all those things,</p>
<p>comfortable and sexy and stylish, at least in my eyes.</p>
<p>To me, the simplicity, the minimalism</p>
<p>of a black dress shirt is just perfect.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not wearing a suit and tie</p>
<p>and I wanna go for a dress shirt,</p>
<p>whether with jeans or anything else,</p>
<p>I always go with Mizzen and Main.</p>
<p>I just love the way it fits the body and so on,</p>
<p>sort of from the shoulders to the waist.</p>
<p>In fact, I wonder who designs those mannequins</p>
<p>in stores on which they hang the clothes.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s an art to that,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a certain way to design a mannequin</p>
<p>in order to bring out the best from a shirt.</p>
<p>Like, do you want it to be skinny?</p>
<p>Do you want it to be muscular?</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something actually I learned about</p>
<p>when they were designing test dummies for crashing cars,</p>
<p>to test the safety of cars,</p>
<p>that you should be doing all kinds of different dummies</p>
<p>to represent different shapes and sizes and so on,</p>
<p>age groups of the population.</p>
<p>Anyway, at least for my body,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about all the other bodies out there,</p>
<p>but for my body, Mizzen and Main fits perfect.</p>
<p>I really love the way it feels.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get a special discount.</p>
<p>Just go to MizzenandMain.com and use promo code Lex.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data</p>
<p>that comes from my own body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had a bunch of conversations</p>
<p>about biology recently,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s humbling and inspiring to think</p>
<p>of the hierarchy of computation</p>
<p>that is happening inside the human body,</p>
<p>just from the basic cell, and the parts of the cell.</p>
<p>Just looking at RNA alone, and RNA and DNA,</p>
<p>from the information to the information processing</p>
<p>and the computation that happens there,</p>
<p>the translation mechanism that happens inside the cell</p>
<p>to the way the energy flows.</p>
<p>The whole thing is fueled in such complicated ways,</p>
<p>and all of that comes from the sun.</p>
<p>Man, human biology is a truly marvelous creation.</p>
<p>All of biology is a marvelous creation,</p>
<p>and it really, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>especially the resilience and the efficiency</p>
<p>of energy use is just incredible.</p>
<p>So anyway, you wanna measure</p>
<p>that particular biological machinery of yours.</p>
<p>If you wanna make lifestyle decisions,</p>
<p>for that, you should use Insight Tracker</p>
<p>and get special savings for a limited time,</p>
<p>and you go to insighttracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by NetSuite,</p>
<p>an all-in-one cloud business management system.</p>
<p>It manages financials, human resources, inventory,</p>
<p>e-commerce, and many business-related details,</p>
<p>all of which I am completely behind on,</p>
<p>personally, because I am in charge of it in my life,</p>
<p>and totally mismanaging, or rather not mismanaging,</p>
<p>but procrastinating, like perhaps some of us,</p>
<p>maybe a lot of us are doing,</p>
<p>everything from the finances on the tax organization side,</p>
<p>everything is always done last minute,</p>
<p>and then just managing things in my life,</p>
<p>people I work with, so I guess that&rsquo;s human resources,</p>
<p>and just managing all the small and the big details.</p>
<p>If you can use good tools for that kind of thing,</p>
<p>you should, if you can hire help</p>
<p>for that kind of thing, you should,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so tricky, because it&rsquo;s so difficult</p>
<p>to find the right tools and the right people</p>
<p>to surround yourself with.</p>
<p>NetSuite is one such tool</p>
<p>that you should definitely integrate if you&rsquo;re a business.</p>
<p>Go to netsuite.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to access their one-of-a-kind financing program.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by SimpliSafe,</p>
<p>a home security company designed</p>
<p>to be simple and effective.</p>
<p>30-minute setup, and you can customize it to your needs.</p>
<p>It was super easy to set up for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first layer of physical security in my life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many layers of physical security,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many layers of cybersecurity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many layers of psychological security,</p>
<p>although, to be honest, the psychological one,</p>
<p>that, because I make myself vulnerable to the world,</p>
<p>it does not have enough layers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure I want those layers.</p>
<p>I want to be easily hurt by the opinions of others.</p>
<p>I think that means you&rsquo;re open and you&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>But as long as I can protect the physical</p>
<p>and the cyber, the digital security, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe is a great general solution for most people.</p>
<p>I actually had a conversation,</p>
<p>and will have several conversations,</p>
<p>with cybersecurity experts on the defense side</p>
<p>and on the former hacker side.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s such a fascinating space of skills</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s shrouded in mystery and darkness,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clearly becoming a bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and bigger problem as the years and decades go on.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Sukaru Nakamura.</p>
<p>You and Magnus played a private game,</p>
<p>40 games of Blitz in 2010 in Moscow at a hotel.</p>
<p>This sounds and just feels legendary.</p>
<p>Final score was 24.5 to 15.5 from Magnus.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you find out the score?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually curious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was publicly said</p>
<p>or it was very briefly said,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t ever mentioned in a serious way, so.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a deep dive based on a few links</p>
<p>that started at a subreddit,</p>
<p>which is how all great journeys start.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is kind of a crazy story.</p>
<p>This was not pre-planned at all.</p>
<p>I remember this quite well.</p>
<p>I went out to dinner that final night</p>
<p>with someone who was actually very hype</p>
<p>within the Internet Chess Club at that time.</p>
<p>I went out for a nice dinner.</p>
<p>I think I had like a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>Maybe it was wine, beer, I don&rsquo;t know what it was.</p>
<p>And I think towards the end of the dinner,</p>
<p>somehow they got word of this</p>
<p>and they relayed the information to me</p>
<p>that Magnus wanted to play a private match.</p>
<p>Now, I agreed to play this match.</p>
<p>Probably I should not have.</p>
<p>And actually, it has nothing to do</p>
<p>with like the state of having been out,</p>
<p>had a few drinks, anything of that nature.</p>
<p>But the reason that I probably should not</p>
<p>have agreed to play this match</p>
<p>and why I very oftentimes reference it</p>
<p>as one of the biggest mistakes</p>
<p>in terms of competitive chess that I made</p>
<p>is specifically because it gave Magnus</p>
<p>a chance to understand my style of chess.</p>
<p>And at the time, I actually had pretty good results</p>
<p>against Magnus.</p>
<p>I think maybe he was up one or two games,</p>
<p>but there were many games where I had been pressing</p>
<p>close to winning against him prior to that match.</p>
<p>And so when I went and played that match,</p>
<p>there were a few things that happened.</p>
<p>First of all, Magnus really started to understand my style</p>
<p>because we played all sorts of different openings.</p>
<p>And so I think he understood that at times</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t so great in the opening.</p>
<p>And there were many openings where I would play</p>
<p>slightly dubious variations as opposed to the main lines.</p>
<p>And then secondly, from my standpoint,</p>
<p>the problem that I realized</p>
<p>is since we were playing with an increment,</p>
<p>there were many games where I was close to winning</p>
<p>and he would defend end games amazingly well.</p>
<p>He would defend what are technically drawn end games,</p>
<p>but where I would have like an extra pawn,</p>
<p>it would be like rook and bishop versus rook and knight.</p>
<p>Say I have four pawns, he has three pawns,</p>
<p>end games of this nature.</p>
<p>Now, if you aren&rsquo;t super into chess,</p>
<p>you might not understand what I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>If you are, you will.</p>
<p>But there are end games where one side</p>
<p>might have extra material, an extra pawn,</p>
<p>say extra two pawns, but theoretically it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly-</p>
<p>Can you give an example of the set of pieces?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about five, six, seven pieces,</p>
<p>like this kind of thing?</p>
<p>So, okay, like a very basic one would be rook and four pawns</p>
<p>against rook and three pawns.</p>
<p>So that would be nine total pieces on the board,</p>
<p>four pawns on one side, three pawns on the other side,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all on the same side of the board.</p>
<p>Now, this is a technical draw.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been known for probably, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>70 years roughly, give or take,</p>
<p>that this is a theoretical draw.</p>
<p>No matter the position of the pawns?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all the pawns are on one side of the board.</p>
<p>So like-</p>
<p>But like where they are?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s just say they&rsquo;re four pawns right here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just four pawns.</p>
<p>And black has three pawns.</p>
<p>So your pawns are on H6, G6, and F6.</p>
<p>And there are no other pawns on the board,</p>
<p>something like this.</p>
<p>And you both have rooks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>So no matter what the next 50 moves of the game are,</p>
<p>we know that it&rsquo;s a drawn endgame with perfect play.</p>
<p>And so it was things like this</p>
<p>where Magnus actually saved,</p>
<p>I wanna say like five or six of these.</p>
<p>And I remember it quite well</p>
<p>because I think the score was very, very close</p>
<p>up until probably the last 10 games of the match.</p>
<p>And then at the end, he started winning in spades.</p>
<p>But there were a lot of situations</p>
<p>where he was up like one game</p>
<p>or maybe two games in the match,</p>
<p>and I had some endgame like this,</p>
<p>and I was not able to win the endgame.</p>
<p>And so for me, after that match,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even so much that I lost the match</p>
<p>or the margin I lost by,</p>
<p>but it was the fact that I realized</p>
<p>how hard it was to beat him</p>
<p>even once you got the advantage.</p>
<p>And I think for Magnus,</p>
<p>he learned that my weakness was openings.</p>
<p>I remember, because I actually,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the game itself,</p>
<p>but there was a game we played in Sicilian Nidorf.</p>
<p>And he played this variation with Bishop G5</p>
<p>on move number six.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can insert a graphic later, I can show you.</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>Sicilian is a type of opening.</p>
<p>Sicilian&rsquo;s the opening, Nidorf is the variation.</p>
<p>It was played by Bobby Fischer,</p>
<p>the former world champion,</p>
<p>Garry Kasparov as well.</p>
<p>And so we played all sorts of different openings</p>
<p>because of course it&rsquo;s not a serious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a serious match,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not serious where it&rsquo;s gonna count for the ranking.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to fill out</p>
<p>where your opponent is strong versus weak.</p>
<p>And so there was one game,</p>
<p>I remember this very clearly.</p>
<p>He played the Bishop G5 variation in the Nidorf.</p>
<p>And I think I played E5 or I played Knight Bd7 in E5,</p>
<p>which is dubious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best response.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one example</p>
<p>where I was playing things that were a little bit dubious,</p>
<p>and I was not playing the absolute main line</p>
<p>with 20 moves of theory.</p>
<p>So I was trying to get outside of theory.</p>
<p>And I think Magnus learned from that</p>
<p>that even though it appeared</p>
<p>that I was very well prepared in these openings,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite at that level.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you have a different interpretation</p>
<p>of you going outside of the main line,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to experiment, take risks,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re chaotic,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually a strength, not a weakness?</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re sitting in a hotel room</p>
<p>late at night, this is past midnight,</p>
<p>playing chess.</p>
<p>I mean, why do you interpret that that&rsquo;s your weakness?</p>
<p>Because Magnus, going forward,</p>
<p>was able to figure out the lines</p>
<p>where you have to be super precise.</p>
<p>You cannot deviate at all.</p>
<p>And I got punished out of the opening in many games.</p>
<p>So it was like, it wasn&rsquo;t about the Nidorf,</p>
<p>the opening or the variation specifically,</p>
<p>but he knew what my repertoire was,</p>
<p>and he would pick lines</p>
<p>where I had to play the absolute best lines</p>
<p>in order to equalize, or I would be much worse.</p>
<p>And he was very effective at doing that.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s pretty legendary</p>
<p>that the two of you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the best chess players in the world</p>
<p>throughout the whole period, still today,</p>
<p>that you just sat down in a hotel room</p>
<p>and played a ton of chess.</p>
<p>Like, what was that like?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a, there is a little,</p>
<p>here, there is a little video of it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like epic, right?</p>
<p>How did this video exist, by the way?</p>
<p>I think there was one journalist, Macaulay Peterson,</p>
<p>who was able to film parts of it.</p>
<p>So it was in a room.</p>
<p>It was me and Magnus.</p>
<p>I think Henrik was there.</p>
<p>I think Macaulay was there, and that was it.</p>
<p>People can go on YouTube and watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Chess Digital Strategies, Macaulay Peterson channel.</p>
<p>For people who are just listening to this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dimly lit room with a yellow light</p>
<p>emerging out of the darkness of the two faces of</p>
<p>Macaulay, I mean, and the deep focus here.</p>
<p>And what time is this?</p>
<p>This is probably like one in the morning.</p>
<p>This was, I believe, the day after the final,</p>
<p>this was the day that the final round occurred</p>
<p>and the closing ceremony, so we&rsquo;re playing afterwards.</p>
<p>I mean, are you able to appreciate the epicness of this?</p>
<p>Many of my favorite memories are actually similar to this.</p>
<p>Another memory that I really have,</p>
<p>that I recall very fondly, was after the US Championship.</p>
<p>It was called the 2005 US Chess Championship.</p>
<p>It was held at the end of 2004 in,</p>
<p>I believe it was in La Jolla in San Diego.</p>
<p>I won that event, and after that event,</p>
<p>I was playing Blitz probably for like four or five hours</p>
<p>in the lobby of the hotel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same kind of situation where you&rsquo;re just playing</p>
<p>for the love of the game as opposed to anything else.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays, I think both for Magnus and myself,</p>
<p>just playing a dimly lit room like this</p>
<p>would almost certainly not happen.</p>
<p>There would probably have to be certain stakes</p>
<p>involved for us to play, but if you go back in time,</p>
<p>these are the sorts of memories and moments</p>
<p>that would happen all the time.</p>
<p>So is there a part of you that doesn&rsquo;t regret</p>
<p>that this happened?</p>
<p>I think it comes back to my general philosophy.</p>
<p>I feel like everything happens for a reason,</p>
<p>and so because I have that, that&rsquo;s one of my core beliefs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really look back on it as mistakes.</p>
<p>I feel like everything has happened,</p>
<p>and things have transpired the way they have for a reason.</p>
<p>If I look at it in terms of potentially</p>
<p>world championship aspirations,</p>
<p>I think certainly it was a big mistake</p>
<p>because from a competitive standpoint,</p>
<p>Magnus figured out what my weaknesses were at the time,</p>
<p>and he exploited it for many, many years.</p>
<p>In fact, I think if you look at the match</p>
<p>I played against him in the Meltwater Tournament</p>
<p>at the, I think that was in June, or no, it was later.</p>
<p>It was like September of 2020.</p>
<p>We played this epic match.</p>
<p>It was the finals of the tour,</p>
<p>and it went all the way to the seventh match.</p>
<p>Magnus won in Armageddon,</p>
<p>and in that match, my openings were much better.</p>
<p>I was able to match him in the openings.</p>
<p>I was not worse out of the opening in most of the games,</p>
<p>and that made a huge difference,</p>
<p>but for many years, he was able to exploit my openings,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the score,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not the only reason,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of the reasons the score</p>
<p>is so lopsided the way it is.</p>
<p>Is there any of those games that you mentioned,</p>
<p>the seven games that are interesting to look at,</p>
<p>to analyze, ideas that you remember</p>
<p>that are interesting to you?</p>
<p>I mean, the whole, it was actually,</p>
<p>so to set it up, and this probably will come into play</p>
<p>in terms of world championship format,</p>
<p>it was seven matches of four games,</p>
<p>so we played a four-game match,</p>
<p>and after four games, say I&rsquo;m up 2 1‚ÅÑ2, 1 1‚ÅÑ2,</p>
<p>I win match number one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you have to win four matches of four games.</p>
<p>Do you remember how you won?</p>
<p>There were a couple of Berlin games in the sixth match,</p>
<p>I believe, in the seventh match as well,</p>
<p>where Magnus actually made some mistakes,</p>
<p>and I won some critical games.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to explain some basics here.</p>
<p>So Berlin&rsquo;s the type of opening, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>The Ruy Lopez, or the Spanish opening,</p>
<p>it actually existed all the way back in the 60s,</p>
<p>but it really became popular in 2001, I believe it was,</p>
<p>when Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik</p>
<p>played their world championship match.</p>
<p>Kasparov had been the world champion for a very long time,</p>
<p>I think it was close, I think it was about 15,</p>
<p>15 years roughly, maybe a little bit more than that,</p>
<p>and he lost the match</p>
<p>because when Garry had the white pieces,</p>
<p>Kasparov was not able to effectively get an advantage.</p>
<p>A lot of those games were very quick draws,</p>
<p>and in chess, you want to put pressure on your opponent</p>
<p>when you have the white pieces,</p>
<p>so Kasparov was not able to do anything</p>
<p>with the white pieces,</p>
<p>and Kramnik was able to beat him</p>
<p>when the colors were reversed.</p>
<p>Kramnik won a game in the Grunfeld,</p>
<p>he won a game in one of the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit,</p>
<p>declined slash Nimzo variations as well,</p>
<p>and that was the reason</p>
<p>Garry Kasparov lost the world championship title,</p>
<p>was because of this variation.</p>
<p>Can you teach me the Berlin opening?</p>
<p>Absolutely, so the opening starts,</p>
<p>let me just move this microphone up a little bit,</p>
<p>it starts with E4, and then it goes E5,</p>
<p>Knight F3, Knight C6,</p>
<p>yeah, Bishop B5, and now Knight to F6.</p>
<p>And at which point is this the standard,</p>
<p>like, this is the Berlin standard?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the Berlin,</p>
<p>this is the starting position of the Berlin defense,</p>
<p>and white has many, many options here.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because I did work with Garry at a certain point,</p>
<p>and I remember I had access to his database,</p>
<p>and he had something like 220 files on the Berlin defense,</p>
<p>because what happened is,</p>
<p>is Garry&rsquo;s somebody who, the way that he learned chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very much like, there are certain openings</p>
<p>that are okay, there are other openings that are not okay.</p>
<p>So this was considered dubious at the time.</p>
<p>And so Garry basically decided to go into this endgame</p>
<p>with castles, Knight takes pawn.</p>
<p>Why is the castling an endgame?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll show you, Knight takes pawn.</p>
<p>All these moves are very, very forced.</p>
<p>You got pawn to D4.</p>
<p>What does it mean, they&rsquo;re very forced?</p>
<p>That means, like, those are the optimal things</p>
<p>that you should be doing?</p>
<p>Exactly, these moves are, I think they&rsquo;re almost,</p>
<p>at least for black, they&rsquo;re absolutely forced,</p>
<p>or else you end up in trouble.</p>
<p>You said Knight takes D4?</p>
<p>Knight to D6.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>So this attacks the bishop on B5.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>White takes.</p>
<p>Black takes back with the pawn in front of the queen.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Pawn takes pawn.</p>
<p>Knight to F5.</p>
<p>And then it goes, queen takes queen.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>King takes queen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you get this position</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re in an endgame.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>You just ruined all the normal conventions, I guess.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for Kramnik it was quite brilliant,</p>
<p>because Gary, what he was known for</p>
<p>was opening preparation and getting the advantage.</p>
<p>He was a very tactical, very aggressive player,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing an endgame right from the start.</p>
<p>Now, Gary basically thought that this was better for white,</p>
<p>and he tried to prove it, and he was unable to prove it.</p>
<p>I think up until, maybe it was game nine or game 11.</p>
<p>Actually, maybe I have the order wrong,</p>
<p>because I think he was white in the even number games.</p>
<p>Basically, he spent four or five games</p>
<p>with the white pieces trying to win this endgame,</p>
<p>and he was not able to win.</p>
<p>In fact, he didn&rsquo;t even come close to proving an advantage,</p>
<p>so he kept wasting the white pieces in that match,</p>
<p>and Kramnik basically took advantage.</p>
<p>When he had the white pieces and Gary had the black pieces,</p>
<p>he was able to win some games in very nice style,</p>
<p>and that was the difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of brilliant.</p>
<p>So he had, this is a new problem presented in that match,</p>
<p>and Gary&rsquo;s gut says-</p>
<p>White is better.</p>
<p>White is better, and so in white,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to push with this position,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna not change anything from match to match.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to find a way that this is better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that kind of stubbornness,</p>
<p>and what do you think about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way of chess, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a mistake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way you should do it.</p>
<p>If your gut says this position is better,</p>
<p>you should capitalize, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an old school way of thinking in chess,</p>
<p>because before computers, basically it was up to humans.</p>
<p>Your intuition, your calculation process</p>
<p>really determined whether a position is better,</p>
<p>and so in Gary&rsquo;s time, if openings were dubious,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dubious, it means somebody is better,</p>
<p>but as we&rsquo;ve learned with computers now,</p>
<p>even small advantages, generally that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,</p>
<p>and a position is defendable where you won&rsquo;t lose the game</p>
<p>if you play optimal moves,</p>
<p>even if the advantage is like half a pawn, for example,</p>
<p>like 0.50, with optimal play,</p>
<p>a computer will still prove that that position,</p>
<p>you can hold it and not lose the game,</p>
<p>and so for Gary, he learned it where like,</p>
<p>if an opening&rsquo;s not right, he knows it&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>He has to prove it.</p>
<p>Now finally, towards the end of the match,</p>
<p>he tried to switch, but it was already way too late,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t have time to win with the white pieces.</p>
<p>He did come close in one of the later games,</p>
<p>but he spent the whole match trying to prove</p>
<p>that this Berlin defense is not playable.</p>
<p>So this position, the computer would say</p>
<p>that black is better.</p>
<p>It would say that white&rsquo;s very slightly better</p>
<p>because black has moved the king.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re unable to castle the king,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of open in the center of the board.</p>
<p>Oh, so wait, so Stockfish or Danjin</p>
<p>would agree with Gary&rsquo;s intuition?</p>
<p>Yes, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>when you go like five moves deeper</p>
<p>in any number of the sequences,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna go to 0.00.</p>
<p>Which means draw.</p>
<p>Yes, correct.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a bad thing because white should be winning.</p>
<p>Well, you wanna put pressure on your opponent</p>
<p>when you have the white pieces in any tournament, any match.</p>
<p>Got it, so if the engine says 0-0,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re not doing a good job of playing white.</p>
<p>Correct, you should be putting pressure.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna win.</p>
<p>There are gonna be a lot of draws</p>
<p>because the game of chess has drawish tendencies,</p>
<p>but you wanna try.</p>
<p>Normally, the general approach these days</p>
<p>because of computers is you try to put pressure</p>
<p>on your opponent when you&rsquo;re white.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re black, you try to be solid, make a draw.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the general approach.</p>
<p>Now, when Gary was actually at his peak,</p>
<p>it was quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Gary was trying to win games with the black pieces as well</p>
<p>by playing openings like the Sicilian Night Orf.</p>
<p>But with modern technology,</p>
<p>and I did a podcast recently where I also spoke about this,</p>
<p>computers are so good and players can memorize so many lines</p>
<p>that nowadays trying to take risks with the black pieces,</p>
<p>it almost always backfires.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re very lucky, you might make the draw,</p>
<p>but you never get the winning chances.</p>
<p>So from a risk-reward standpoint,</p>
<p>you have to play almost perfectly just to make the draw,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re never gonna have any winning chances.</p>
<p>Where in the old days, generally you might lose the games,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have chances to win as well.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s very much one-sided.</p>
<p>So a lot of players try to be very solid.</p>
<p>This is, by the way, the C Squared podcast?</p>
<p>Correct, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is an amazing podcast.</p>
<p>So shout out to those guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that they started a thing</p>
<p>that seems to be a good thing.</p>
<p>And I hope they keep going with this good thing.</p>
<p>That was a great interview that I did with you.</p>
<p>In that podcast, I talked about the Sicilian Eidorf.</p>
<p>Very aggressive opening.</p>
<p>The problem is white is the one who has the choices.</p>
<p>After the first five to six moves,</p>
<p>white has the choice of what do you wanna do.</p>
<p>Can you show me that opening?</p>
<p>Sure, so it&rsquo;s, for example, that would be E4.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just set it up, E4.</p>
<p>C5.</p>
<p>And now we get knight to F3, pawn to D6.</p>
<p>Pawn to D4, trade.</p>
<p>Knight to F6.</p>
<p>Knight to F6.</p>
<p>And now pawn to A6.</p>
<p>So this is an Eidorf.</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer really popularized it</p>
<p>in his run up to becoming the world champion.</p>
<p>Gary played it for probably the last 15 to 20 years</p>
<p>of his career.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very solid opening defense.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a, for people listening,</p>
<p>on the white side, there&rsquo;s a couple of knights out.</p>
<p>So black has many options.</p>
<p>Black can play for B5 here to develop the bishop to B7.</p>
<p>Because the pawn on A6 guards the pawn on B5.</p>
<p>You can also play other setups, like potentially G6</p>
<p>and putting the bishop on G7.</p>
<p>Okay, so you can play the bishop on G7.</p>
<p>You can play the bishop on G7.</p>
<p>Putting the bishop on G7.</p>
<p>Okay, so bringing, doing different things</p>
<p>and bringing out the-</p>
<p>You can also push the pawn to E5</p>
<p>or push the pawn to E6.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there are many different setups</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very, very flexible.</p>
<p>But white is the one who has the choice here</p>
<p>in terms of what to play.</p>
<p>And there are many moves.</p>
<p>There is this move that I mentioned before,</p>
<p>bishop to G5, which Magnus played against me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also bishop to E3, bishop to C4.</p>
<p>And now there are also moves like H3, H4, Rook G1.</p>
<p>Even moves like A3 and A4.</p>
<p>So there basically are nine or 10 moves</p>
<p>that white can play here.</p>
<p>But the move that white plays sort of dictates</p>
<p>the direction of the game.</p>
<p>And you have to be extremely precise if you&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>So if white plays something like bishop G5,</p>
<p>this is very sharp and aggressive.</p>
<p>But you can also play something like bishop to E3,</p>
<p>pawn to E5, and something like knight to F3 here.</p>
<p>And it goes in a positional direction.</p>
<p>So again, this is very advanced.</p>
<p>These are very advanced sort of setups.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m explaining is not at a basic level.</p>
<p>But white is the one who chooses the type of game.</p>
<p>Is it very aggressive, very sharp,</p>
<p>or both sides of chances?</p>
<p>Is it something very positional,</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re probably okay,</p>
<p>but you have to play the best moves in order to equalize,</p>
<p>or you can end up worse.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re always responding</p>
<p>as black in this situation.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So how different are all those different variations?</p>
<p>So like with the bishop, with the different,</p>
<p>you said you bring out the bishop to this position,</p>
<p>to this position, or to that position.</p>
<p>Like how are those fundamentally different variations?</p>
<p>Like I just wonder from a AI computational perspective,</p>
<p>like a single step.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll make it even simpler here.</p>
<p>If you put the knight here, it&rsquo;s very positional.</p>
<p>If you put the knight on this square, it&rsquo;s very aggressive.</p>
<p>Because normally white is going to push this pawn</p>
<p>from F2 to either F3 or F4,</p>
<p>and potentially a pawn to G4 later.</p>
<p>So even here, based on where you go,</p>
<p>it changes whether it&rsquo;s a positional game</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a very tactical.</p>
<p>Just those little, and those are the choices</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly making.</p>
<p>Am I going to be standard and basic and positional,</p>
<p>or am I going to be aggressive and take risks?</p>
<p>And I can actually give you another example.</p>
<p>So psychology plays a big role.</p>
<p>And in the candidates tournament,</p>
<p>which I played in June of this past year in Madrid, Spain,</p>
<p>I actually, I had the white piece against Ali Reza Faruja,</p>
<p>who is a rising junior, originally from Iran,</p>
<p>representing France.</p>
<p>And I knew that he wanted very aggressive games.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t normally play the Sicilian Eidorff,</p>
<p>and he chose to play it in this one tournament.</p>
<p>So I knew that he wanted these very sharp positions</p>
<p>where he can lose, but he can also win.</p>
<p>And so when I played him,</p>
<p>I intentionally played this variation</p>
<p>because I knew that he was going to be unhappy.</p>
<p>He wanted these sharp, exciting games.</p>
<p>And here I am playing something very boring</p>
<p>where if he plays it correctly, it&rsquo;s going to be a draw,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not going to be happy.</p>
<p>And so he actually did something dubious</p>
<p>because he wanted to create tension.</p>
<p>He wanted to create chaos.</p>
<p>So you knew by being boring, you would frustrate him,</p>
<p>and then he would make mistakes.</p>
<p>Exactly, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So that played a big role.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate troll</p>
<p>at the highest level of chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, you mentioned psychology,</p>
<p>and then taking us back to the Magnus,</p>
<p>even in 2010, the Magnus games.</p>
<p>Reddit said that you&rsquo;ve spoken about losing to Magnus</p>
<p>being a hit on your confidence.</p>
<p>Is there some truth to that?</p>
<p>So is there some aspect about that 2010 match</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just about Magnus figuring stuff out,</p>
<p>but just a hit on confidence?</p>
<p>Like how important is confidence at that level</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re both young and like firing out all cylinders?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just a problem with me.</p>
<p>This is the problem everybody has when they play</p>
<p>against Magnus, because what happens is,</p>
<p>is on a broader level, when you play against somebody,</p>
<p>no matter who you&rsquo;re playing against,</p>
<p>but when they&rsquo;re somehow able to save positions</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re much worse, almost in miraculous ways,</p>
<p>the way that Magnus has done against everybody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done it against me, done it against Aronian</p>
<p>many times, done it against Kramnik, just about everybody.</p>
<p>When someone&rsquo;s able to save games,</p>
<p>it really starts to affect you</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And the more and more times that happens,</p>
<p>it starts adding up and it just affects you</p>
<p>in a way that it&rsquo;s very, very hard to overcome.</p>
<p>And I think every top player has that issue</p>
<p>where if they&rsquo;ve played against Magnus</p>
<p>more than like five times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve seen things happen in the game</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t happen against anybody else.</p>
<p>And then psychologically,</p>
<p>it becomes harder and harder to overcome it,</p>
<p>which is why I think a lot of the junior players,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have this long history and it does affect them.</p>
<p>As far as myself directly,</p>
<p>certainly after that match though,</p>
<p>it was not the same playing against Magnus</p>
<p>because I viewed him completely differently too.</p>
<p>After all those games where he was saving these end games,</p>
<p>I started thinking like, this guy is superhuman,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really have those thoughts</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing competitively.</p>
<p>But in the back of your mind, it&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>And I think every top player has that issue.</p>
<p>Is there a way to overcome that?</p>
<p>Because you have to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll necessarily do better</p>
<p>against Magnus going forward,</p>
<p>but I felt that when I started playing against him</p>
<p>more than just a game here or there in classical chess.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, I played in these online tournaments,</p>
<p>seemed like every month.</p>
<p>I came very close.</p>
<p>I beat him in one event.</p>
<p>I think I lost in two others, and then the tour final.</p>
<p>But when I was playing against him more and more,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t feel superhuman.</p>
<p>It felt like as I&rsquo;m playing more and more</p>
<p>and learning about his style, that I was doing better.</p>
<p>So I think for me, the weird thing is</p>
<p>that I just wasn&rsquo;t playing against him that many games.</p>
<p>But when I start playing against like 20, 30 games</p>
<p>during the course of a year,</p>
<p>I actually started feeling more confident</p>
<p>because I feel like I can compete.</p>
<p>Whereas when I was only playing him like three</p>
<p>or four times in classical chess</p>
<p>in the previous couple of years, I wasn&rsquo;t doing great.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t have those glimpses of,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have those moments where you feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going to be able to win against him.</p>
<p>But when you start playing 20, 30 games</p>
<p>and you get these opportunities,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t convert,</p>
<p>you feel like you have the chances.</p>
<p>When you play three or four games</p>
<p>you might lose one, draw three,</p>
<p>you never have those opportunities.</p>
<p>And so you feel very negative about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>When you were able to beat him</p>
<p>or not necessarily win the game,</p>
<p>but win positionally something, what was the reason?</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the matchup between the two of you,</p>
<p>what were the holes that you were able to find?</p>
<p>I mean, the answer I think is actually quite simple.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all psychological, actually,</p>
<p>more than anything else.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was doing anything differently,</p>
<p>but I was also not making the mistakes</p>
<p>that I was making before.</p>
<p>So I think it was more psychological than anything else.</p>
<p>On your part versus his part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird because when you think about chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a mental game.</p>
<p>But we all are capable of beating Magnus, all of us,</p>
<p>but we all have very, very bad scores against him.</p>
<p>And I think people underestimate</p>
<p>how much of a role that plays.</p>
<p>And for me, when I played him in these online events</p>
<p>in 2020 specifically,</p>
<p>I felt like there was really nothing to lose,</p>
<p>which also ties into everything else that happened</p>
<p>during the pandemic as well.</p>
<p>But I just felt like there was nothing to lose.</p>
<p>And I felt like I was playing very freely, unlike before.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to say that Magnus isn&rsquo;t a better player</p>
<p>that somehow I expect to beat him,</p>
<p>but I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t making the same mistakes</p>
<p>that I was making in the previous years.</p>
<p>If we dig into the psychological preparation,</p>
<p>is there something to your mental preparation that you do</p>
<p>that makes you successful?</p>
<p>Like what are the lessons over all these years</p>
<p>that you learned?</p>
<p>What works, what doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Do you drink a bunch of whiskey the night before?</p>
<p>Is there some small hacks or major ones</p>
<p>about how you approach the game?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard sort of in a way</p>
<p>because I feel like I&rsquo;m two different people.</p>
<p>I was one person up until the pandemic</p>
<p>as a professional chess player solely</p>
<p>where I earned all my income.</p>
<p>Everything was derived from that.</p>
<p>And from the pandemic on, I&rsquo;m sort of a different person</p>
<p>because that is not where I&rsquo;m making my income from.</p>
<p>And so the whole psychological profile that I had before</p>
<p>is completely different from now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this joke about the, I literally don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>phrase that I&rsquo;ve used.</p>
<p>And in a sense, what that means is not that I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m competitive, I want to do well.</p>
<p>But if I lose a game or I don&rsquo;t do well in a tournament,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the end of the world in the same kind of way</p>
<p>that I felt it was before.</p>
<p>Because that pressure of needing to always perform</p>
<p>was very, very high.</p>
<p>And so I think before the pandemic,</p>
<p>what I would try to do more than anything</p>
<p>is just not think about the previous game</p>
<p>for the most part.</p>
<p>Like say I had a bad game,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go out for a walk that evening, just clear my mind.</p>
<p>These sorts of things, now they aren&rsquo;t really hacks per se,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s trying essentially to have short-term memory loss.</p>
<p>So I literally don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a meme, it&rsquo;s a philosophy.</p>
<p>In a sense, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically that, yes, I do want to perform well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give it my all,</p>
<p>but if I lose a game, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>That should be the title of your autobiography.</p>
<p>And it should be, I know you&rsquo;re probably mortal,</p>
<p>but if you do happen to die,</p>
<p>that should also be in your tombstone.</p>
<p>Charles Bukowski has Don&rsquo;t Try in his tombstone.</p>
<p>Which I think emphasizes a similar concept,</p>
<p>but slightly different, more in the artistic domain,</p>
<p>which is, well, a lot of people</p>
<p>have different interpretations of that statement,</p>
<p>but I think it means don&rsquo;t take things too seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I agree with that completely.</p>
<p>I think that if you look at my career prior to the pandemic,</p>
<p>I put huge amounts of pressure on myself</p>
<p>because I really wanted to be as good as I could be,</p>
<p>but it was the way I was earning a living.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s very difficult about chess</p>
<p>is that only the top 20, maybe 30 players in the world</p>
<p>make a living from the game.</p>
<p>Now, you make a very good living.</p>
<p>No way am I diminishing chess,</p>
<p>but the problem with it is it&rsquo;s not secure at all.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t get invitations</p>
<p>to the absolute top tournaments,</p>
<p>which have prize funds from anywhere from maybe 100,000</p>
<p>up to potentially half a million dollars,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get those invitations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very hard to earn a living.</p>
<p>You can go from earning maybe 200,000, $300,000 a year</p>
<p>to earning like 50,000.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very unstable.</p>
<p>And I think for myself,</p>
<p>I really put a lot of pressure on myself</p>
<p>and in a way that it affected me and not in a good way.</p>
<p>So in part, it was also financial pressure.</p>
<p>So like once you&rsquo;re able to make money elsewhere,</p>
<p>it makes you more free to take risks,</p>
<p>to play the pure game of chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It makes, it made me, it took all that pressure off</p>
<p>and I kind of, I&rsquo;m just trying to play as well as I can.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really worry.</p>
<p>Like if I lose a game, it&rsquo;s not the end all be all.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s just like psychological stuff</p>
<p>that I should have tried to sort out before.</p>
<p>I mean, I did at some period of time,</p>
<p>like do certain things along those lines,</p>
<p>but I just, yeah, I became free.</p>
<p>And I think it definitely, it was not about the chess.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of those things that&rsquo;s also very hard</p>
<p>because when I look at myself</p>
<p>and when I had these periods</p>
<p>where it seemed like I played better or improved,</p>
<p>one of these periods was in 2008,</p>
<p>where I basically, I dropped out of college.</p>
<p>I was about 2,650 Elo,</p>
<p>so I was roughly top 100 in the world.</p>
<p>And for the first probably half part of 2008,</p>
<p>I played very little, almost not all.</p>
<p>I went up to Vancouver.</p>
<p>I was living on my own for the first time</p>
<p>and I was not studying that much.</p>
<p>And then after that period, I started playing</p>
<p>and I actually improved very quickly</p>
<p>and I broke 2,700 shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>So it had nothing to do with chess.</p>
<p>When you moved to Vancouver and weren&rsquo;t doing much,</p>
<p>what were you doing exactly?</p>
<p>Oh, I was enjoying nature.</p>
<p>I was going outside, hiking mountains,</p>
<p>like going and kayaking,</p>
<p>all these things that I was not,</p>
<p>that I had not done for many years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I asked, because I was imagining something else.</p>
<p>I was imagining you like in a dark room,</p>
<p>drinking and playing video games.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting break.</p>
<p>So dropping out of college and then giving,</p>
<p>taking a break and then giving everything to chess</p>
<p>in terms of preparation and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe actually, if we can rewind back to the beginning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said about yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not a naturally talented chess player.</p>
<p>Your brother was, but that&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>because what would you say was the reason</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to break through</p>
<p>and become one of the best chess players in the world,</p>
<p>having been not a naturally talented chess player?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that this applies to actually chess</p>
<p>or any number of sort of basic games,</p>
<p>actually, for that matter,</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m not naturally talented,</p>
<p>but if I don&rsquo;t get something,</p>
<p>I try to figure out why don&rsquo;t I get it?</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Over and over and over again.</p>
<p>And I mean, there are many games like this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this funny game on the phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just use it as an example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a game called Geometry Dash.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not like, I&rsquo;m not world-class or anything at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a silly little game on the phone that you play.</p>
<p>You just tap and it goes up and down.</p>
<p>People will probably know what that is.</p>
<p>But like I said, I played that for maybe like an hour or so.</p>
<p>I just randomly play this for one hour</p>
<p>and I was terrible at it.</p>
<p>And I kind of forgot about it for a week.</p>
<p>And then I came back, I saw it on my phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Like, why am I not good at this game?</p>
<p>So I spent like probably like a hundred hours</p>
<p>over the following month,</p>
<p>just playing it nonstop over and over and over again</p>
<p>to get better at it.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not like world-class or anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty good at the game.</p>
<p>And so with chess, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when I started out, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why am I not good?</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>And I basically refused to accept</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t be good at the game.</p>
<p>And so, at the start, I actually,</p>
<p>I played for a couple of months.</p>
<p>I did very poorly.</p>
<p>And then my parents stopped me</p>
<p>from playing for about six months.</p>
<p>They just said, no, you&rsquo;re not playing.</p>
<p>Your brother&rsquo;s quite good.</p>
<p>And my brother was one of the top ranked players</p>
<p>in his age group in the United States.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not playing.</p>
<p>Then after about six months,</p>
<p>they relented and they let me play.</p>
<p>And the first term back, I actually, it was four games.</p>
<p>I was playing against other kids</p>
<p>and I won the first three games.</p>
<p>So it was really good.</p>
<p>And then I lost the form of checkmate in the fourth game,</p>
<p>which is, of course, quite ironic.</p>
<p>How did you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess this is, how old were you at this time?</p>
<p>I would have been about eight years old, seven or eight.</p>
<p>So an eight year old future top ranked chess player has,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s great to know that somebody</p>
<p>has lost to that checkmate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to lose to that checkmate.</p>
<p>I remember that game quite well, yeah.</p>
<p>Was it, I mean, at that time,</p>
<p>did you know that that checkmate exists?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I probably knew it existed,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t, I was just playing.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a completely different world than now.</p>
<p>If a kid goes on their computer,</p>
<p>they can immediately figure out</p>
<p>what are the basic checkmates, all these different things.</p>
<p>At the time that didn&rsquo;t really exist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to find it in a book.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is just a basic blunder.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s like I came back, it was a very good start.</p>
<p>And then I lose like this, but I stuck with it.</p>
<p>I improved very, very quickly thereafter.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was very straightforward.</p>
<p>What was the secret to that fast improvement?</p>
<p>So you said like this very first important step,</p>
<p>which is saying like, what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Like I have to figure out what I&rsquo;m doing wrong,</p>
<p>but then you actually have to take the step</p>
<p>of figuring out what you&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was just, I played as much as I could.</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t like I was consciously thinking about it.</p>
<p>As an eight-year-old, you&rsquo;re not really thinking</p>
<p>about those sorts of things or the big picture.</p>
<p>So I just basically kept playing as much as I could,</p>
<p>whether it was online, whether it was against my brother,</p>
<p>reading these chess books as much as I could.</p>
<p>I just devoured as much information as I could.</p>
<p>So you were studying chess books?</p>
<p>You were studying chess books?</p>
<p>I was, I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t studying them</p>
<p>cover to cover, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you just study certain diagrams,</p>
<p>certain positions.</p>
<p>So openings and stuff like that, you were?</p>
<p>Mostly tactics, actually.</p>
<p>Openings were not, other than top-level chess,</p>
<p>openings were not a thing, probably.</p>
<p>I wanna say for players below maybe master level</p>
<p>in a serious way until maybe like the early 2000s.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know chess,</p>
<p>what kind of tactical ideas are interesting</p>
<p>and basic to understand that once you understand,</p>
<p>you take early leaps in improvement?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s things like forks, for example,</p>
<p>where you attack two pieces at the same time,</p>
<p>discovered attacks like checkmates,</p>
<p>and again, winning like a queen or other material.</p>
<p>Those are probably two most important ones.</p>
<p>Batteries, or batteries and pins, things of that nature.</p>
<p>How many, how rich is the world of,</p>
<p>and by the way, discovered attacks</p>
<p>are when you move a piece.</p>
<p>And you put a king in check to win like a rook,</p>
<p>for example, or other material.</p>
<p>And forking pieces is when you&rsquo;re attacking two pieces,</p>
<p>so obviously the other person can&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>two pieces at a time,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna have to lose one of them.</p>
<p>Okay, so how big is the world, the universe of forks</p>
<p>and discovered attacks?</p>
<p>You know, I myself know, so there&rsquo;s like knights attacking</p>
<p>attacking like, what is it?</p>
<p>There are forks, knight attacking like a queen and a rook,</p>
<p>for example, or like a pawn attacking a queen and a rook,</p>
<p>or like a rook and a bishop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s innumerable.</p>
<p>There, I mean, but I will say that I think that with chess,</p>
<p>the more of these patterns you see,</p>
<p>the quicker you catch them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you improve, I think, the most,</p>
<p>is by learning these basic tactical themes</p>
<p>at the beginner levels.</p>
<p>Are you, when you&rsquo;re discovering those patterns,</p>
<p>are you looking at the chessboard,</p>
<p>or are you looking at some like higher dimensional</p>
<p>representation of the relative position of the pieces?</p>
<p>So basically something that&rsquo;s disjoint of the particular</p>
<p>absolute position of the piece,</p>
<p>but like you&rsquo;re seeing patterns like this kind of pattern,</p>
<p>but elsewhere on the board.</p>
<p>Like are you thinking in patterns</p>
<p>or in like absolute positions of the pieces?</p>
<p>Both, I think that at the higher levels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always thinking about like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about the patterns</p>
<p>on one side of the board specifically,</p>
<p>but then also what happens is you play more and more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a very strong player,</p>
<p>you will be able to remember say pawn structures</p>
<p>where the pawns are on certain squares</p>
<p>from games that you&rsquo;ve played like 15, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>even potentially.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is more subconscious</p>
<p>than actively thinking about it</p>
<p>and like figuring it out like that.</p>
<p>The only thing for me that I definitely</p>
<p>am doing very frequently when I play</p>
<p>is trying to look at my pieces.</p>
<p>Are they placed on the optimal squares?</p>
<p>Are there better squares?</p>
<p>And then once I get past that, like using the basic logic,</p>
<p>I start to think about, okay, what pure calculations,</p>
<p>like what are the moves that make a lot of sense</p>
<p>and start calculating direct moves.</p>
<p>But one of the most basic things that I think</p>
<p>that I do that a lot of people actually should do</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t do is looking at the piece placement</p>
<p>and trying to figure out what pieces look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on good squares versus bad squares.</p>
<p>So am I, for each piece asking the question,</p>
<p>am I in my happy place?</p>
<p>Am I in my like optimally happy place?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>If we look at this position on the board right now,</p>
<p>this is a good example.</p>
<p>Who is not in their happy place on the board right now?</p>
<p>I think both sides are actually pretty happy right now.</p>
<p>But the thing is, if you&rsquo;re playing with a black piece,</p>
<p>what is a move that sticks out to you</p>
<p>to like follow basic principles?</p>
<p>Basic principles probably bring out the bishop.</p>
<p>And then castle the king.</p>
<p>And castle the king.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you should do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to play the position.</p>
<p>Now, once you do that though-</p>
<p>By the way, I have a vibrating device inside me right now.</p>
<p>So I knew that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So my rating is 3,400,</p>
<p>which is what I believe Stockfish is.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s higher.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 3,800 actually.</p>
<p>Is it 3,800?</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using an earlier version of Stockfish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry, you were saying-</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s very basic.</p>
<p>But then if you move the bishop out and you castle the king,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just say bishop B7.</p>
<p>Play this, you castle.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you&rsquo;ve done everything</p>
<p>with the pieces on the king side.</p>
<p>So what would be the next set of,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next way to try and develop the pieces?</p>
<p>So everything here is pretty strong,</p>
<p>except maybe this pawn?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, but think about the pieces.</p>
<p>So by pieces, I mean everything except the pawns.</p>
<p>Except the pawns, okay.</p>
<p>Probably either bishop or knight on the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that is correct.</p>
<p>You want to bring out the bishop and the knight.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you go bishop E6.</p>
<p>Bishop E6, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll castle.</p>
<p>Now you can move the knight to either square.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat irrelevant, but just move the knight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just play it.</p>
<p>Knight to C6.</p>
<p>What was your random move?</p>
<p>Bringing the bishop out?</p>
<p>I just moved my rook to the center.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s your unhappy place right now?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me move the queen</p>
<p>to just follow some basic principles.</p>
<p>Okay, because I want to bring my rooks</p>
<p>to the center of the board.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So like in this position,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve pretty much developed all your pieces.</p>
<p>There are only two pieces</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t brought into the game.</p>
<p>The queen and the rook.</p>
<p>You consider it to be in the game because of this?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s in the game,</p>
<p>but there isn&rsquo;t really a great square</p>
<p>for that rook right now.</p>
<p>But in this position,</p>
<p>you would probably move your rook to C8,</p>
<p>and then the middle game begins after that.</p>
<p>Got it, so here.</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;ve gotten your piece</p>
<p>to all the optimal squares,</p>
<p>and now you have to look for a specific plan,</p>
<p>but you have gotten these pieces developed</p>
<p>out of the opening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very basic thing</p>
<p>that I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>is what are the optimal placements for the pieces?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re constantly thinking about the pieces</p>
<p>that are not in their optimal placement</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re doing all the other kind of tactics</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a basic thing that people can follow.</p>
<p>Actually doing pure calculations,</p>
<p>like moving five or 10 moves in your head,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>
<p>But trying to use basic logic</p>
<p>to figure out what pieces are on squares</p>
<p>that look correct is something anybody can do.</p>
<p>What about looking at the other person&rsquo;s pieces</p>
<p>and thinking about the optimal placement of them?</p>
<p>If you see a bunch of pieces</p>
<p>not in their optimal placement for the opponent,</p>
<p>what does that tell you?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a higher level concept, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give a beginner example.</p>
<p>That is something that I do think about as well.</p>
<p>I try to think about my opponent&rsquo;s pieces.</p>
<p>That is basic logic.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people these days,</p>
<p>at the upper levels of chess,</p>
<p>they look at the game as something of pure calculation,</p>
<p>and you lose that human element.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to just calculate</p>
<p>all these different sequences of moves,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t think about the basics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens</p>
<p>with the next generation of kids who become very strong,</p>
<p>because that is really how they approach the game.</p>
<p>They learn with computers.</p>
<p>Whereas I learned with computers at a certain point,</p>
<p>but I did not start off with computers from the get-go.</p>
<p>So that human element still exists in my game.</p>
<p>Actually, Magnus, I think, has said this too,</p>
<p>where he did not use a computer, I think,</p>
<p>until he was maybe 11 years old, something around there.</p>
<p>So we have that human element to our game</p>
<p>that I think the newer generation won&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t gonna be better than us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be a completely different approach.</p>
<p>What do you mean by human element?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basic logic versus raw calculation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like anybody now will use a computer</p>
<p>from the time they start the game.</p>
<p>And you use a computer, you look at the evaluations</p>
<p>after the game to see how you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t really ever have those moments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just you and your opponent.</p>
<p>One thing that was great in the old days</p>
<p>before computers simply became too strong</p>
<p>is that you would actually do analysis</p>
<p>with your opponent after the game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very much two humans analyzing a game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you and your opponent, two peers,</p>
<p>and you come up with these human ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not automatically run back to your room,</p>
<p>look with a computer, and oh, I should&rsquo;ve played this move,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like winning the game.</p>
<p>So that is kind of something that no longer exists</p>
<p>in the game of chess because, as I said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to analyze with your opponent</p>
<p>after the game.</p>
<p>Are there ideas that the engine tells you</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t reverse engineer with logic</p>
<p>why that makes sense?</p>
<p>Can you start to just memorize it that&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>Yes, so in the opening, for sure,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain positions where moves are playable.</p>
<p>And I can even give you an example,</p>
<p>actually, in this knight or if we can just</p>
<p>set the position up a few moves earlier.</p>
<p>Yeah, knight over on B8, bishop on C8,</p>
<p>and just move the king back to the center,</p>
<p>bishop back to F8, and pawn to E7.</p>
<p>So the pawn in front of the king</p>
<p>can just push it back two squares.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a move here that nowadays humans will play,</p>
<p>which is this move, pawn to H4.</p>
<p>And this is a move that 20 years ago,</p>
<p>if someone showed this move to Kasparov,</p>
<p>he would just laugh at them.</p>
<p>No matter who you were, he would basically say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an idiot, what is this move?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pushing a pawn on the edge of the board.</p>
<p>It does nothing.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s playable,</p>
<p>but even if you were to ask me or any other top grandmaster</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s playable or why it&rsquo;s a move that makes sense,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say why it makes sense</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We just know that it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>because the computer says it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine or is it good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fine.</p>
<p>It probably, like everything else,</p>
<p>is equal with perfect play,</p>
<p>but it definitely, if you&rsquo;re not careful with black,</p>
<p>you can be worse, for sure.</p>
<p>But if you ask me, I can&rsquo;t say why it&rsquo;s a good move.</p>
<p>I can say, okay, maybe I&rsquo;m gonna expand on the king side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll push this pawn here and push the pawn forward.</p>
<p>Maybe I can put the bishop on G5,</p>
<p>and in some situations, the pawn guard&rsquo;s a bishop,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t give an actual good explanation</p>
<p>for why it&rsquo;s a move that makes sense</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that young people today,</p>
<p>kids these days, would probably do that move</p>
<p>much more nonchalantly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that a lot more</p>
<p>because they know it&rsquo;s safe, at least.</p>
<p>Right, because they know the computer says it&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but I grew up without computers,</p>
<p>and so to me, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re pushing a pawn on the edge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opening phase.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do things like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it looks ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have worked with computers long enough</p>
<p>that I know, like I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I know that computers are,</p>
<p>computers prove that everything is fine,</p>
<p>but still, to me, it does feel wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think as computers get better,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll also get better at explaining,</p>
<p>which they currently don&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>at basically being able to do,</p>
<p>so first of all, simple language generation,</p>
<p>so a set of chess moves to language conversion,</p>
<p>explaining to us dumb humans</p>
<p>of why this is an interesting tactical idea.</p>
<p>They currently don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to figure that out yourself.</p>
<p>Like, why, what&rsquo;s the deep wisdom</p>
<p>in this particular pawn coming out in this kind of way?</p>
<p>Let me ask you a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Do you think chess will ever get solved</p>
<p>from the opening position</p>
<p>to where we&rsquo;ll know the optimal, optimal level of play?</p>
<p>I highly doubt it.</p>
<p>Without major advances in quantum computing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic</p>
<p>to expect chess to be hard solved.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t think that will happen,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It could happen 20, 30 years, maybe,</p>
<p>but I think in the near future, it&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>
<p>Well, then let&rsquo;s go up with a pothead follow-up question.</p>
<p>Suppose it does get solved.</p>
<p>What opening do you think will be the optimal?</p>
<p>Well, everything will be a draw, for sure,</p>
<p>after move one. For sure.</p>
<p>After move one, yes.</p>
<p>For sure. Absolutely.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely sure of that?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Why are you so sure?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sure because when you look at the computer games</p>
<p>and you see these decisive results,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the openings are set, generally.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t, for move one, they play set openings.</p>
<p>Like, you might play the knight</p>
<p>or you might play the Berlin defense.</p>
<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s set openings,</p>
<p>as opposed to computers being able to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>I just believe, in general,</p>
<p>in the openings that are symmetrical,</p>
<p>like E4, E5, D4, D5, the computers will draw,</p>
<p>and I think the optimal opening,</p>
<p>I think E4, E5, Knight F3, Knight F6,</p>
<p>is probably a guaranteed draw.</p>
<p>If there is perfect, if we have perfect information</p>
<p>and we know that chess is solved,</p>
<p>E4, E5, Knight F3, Knight F6,</p>
<p>the Russian or the Petrov defense,</p>
<p>that will be the optimal strategy.</p>
<p>See, so that&rsquo;s symmetrical play</p>
<p>is going to lead to a draw,</p>
<p>but what if you can constantly, as White,</p>
<p>maintain asymmetry,</p>
<p>constantly keep the opponent off balance?</p>
<p>So yes, E4, then you&rsquo;re always doing this symmetry,</p>
<p>but what if chess inherently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the mathematics of the game</p>
<p>that allows for that thin line that you walk</p>
<p>that maintains to the end game, the asymmetry,</p>
<p>constantly, that there&rsquo;s no move</p>
<p>that can bring back the balance of the game.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that exists?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it does.</p>
<p>So basically I&rsquo;m saying E4, E5, I think is a draw.</p>
<p>I think D4, D5 is a draw.</p>
<p>C4, C5, I think basically it&rsquo;s symmetry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>All of it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re saying if it&rsquo;s solved,</p>
<p>most openings will be a draw.</p>
<p>Yes, I think E4, D4, C4, Knight F3,</p>
<p>for sure will be a draw.</p>
<p>Other openings, I&rsquo;m not sure about,</p>
<p>but those first four possible starting moves,</p>
<p>I think chess is a draw.</p>
<p>Knight F3, what&rsquo;s the response to Knight F3?</p>
<p>Probably Knight F6 again.</p>
<p>Or to make it simple,</p>
<p>if I play Knight F3 on move one,</p>
<p>black here can also play D5 on move one.</p>
<p>And normally at some point,</p>
<p>white&rsquo;s gonna end up playing D4.</p>
<p>So the order of-</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably gonna lead back,</p>
<p>yeah, all roads kind of lead back there as well.</p>
<p>There probably are other ways which,</p>
<p>where there is play,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the symmetry is what&rsquo;s gonna lead to like a forced,</p>
<p>forced equality or a draw in the game of chess.</p>
<p>So Demis Hassabis is the CEO of DeepMind.</p>
<p>DeepMind helped create or created AlphaZero.</p>
<p>He says that he&rsquo;s also a chess player</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a fan of chess.</p>
<p>And he says the reason,</p>
<p>his hypothesis is that the reason chess is interesting</p>
<p>as a game is the creative, quote unquote,</p>
<p>between the bishop and the knight.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s so many different dynamics</p>
<p>that are created by those two pieces.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s truth to that?</p>
<p>I mean, some of that is just poetry,</p>
<p>but is there truth to that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s definitely true</p>
<p>when you look at the imbalances</p>
<p>that are not like crazy attacking positions.</p>
<p>Like one thing that Bobby Fischer was really,</p>
<p>really good at when he was the world champion</p>
<p>is playing end games with a bishop versus a knight.</p>
<p>Now, traditionally we think of the knight</p>
<p>being better than the bishop, even today in end games.</p>
<p>But Fischer proved that there are a lot of end games</p>
<p>where a bishop is better than a knight.</p>
<p>So I do agree with that statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the imbalances between like bishops and knights</p>
<p>in many positions, you never really know.</p>
<p>Like there are many positions where a knight</p>
<p>is better than a bishop or knight and bishop</p>
<p>are better than two bishops or like,</p>
<p>it is all the, generally it is the imbalances though,</p>
<p>between the bishops and the knights</p>
<p>or combinations of the two pieces</p>
<p>that lead to the most interesting positions.</p>
<p>So I agree with that.</p>
<p>Interesting positions.</p>
<p>What about fun?</p>
<p>Is there like aspects that you find fun</p>
<p>within the game itself?</p>
<p>Not all the stuff around it,</p>
<p>but just the purity of the game.</p>
<p>I think for me these days,</p>
<p>when I see some of these moves that computer suggests</p>
<p>after a game that I play and I just go, wow,</p>
<p>that is the beauty for me.</p>
<p>Because these are not moves that I would ever consider.</p>
<p>And when I then see the move and then like,</p>
<p>I might make a couple of moves to try and understand why,</p>
<p>that is the beauty to me,</p>
<p>is seeing all these things that just like 10 years ago,</p>
<p>I never would have even seen.</p>
<p>Because computers weren&rsquo;t at the level they&rsquo;re at today.</p>
<p>And so the depth and creativity of what they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not like in our language,</p>
<p>but in the evaluation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I find a lot of beauty.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So like the computer is a source of creative fulfillment</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I think also it&rsquo;s very humbling as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when you spend your whole life playing a game</p>
<p>and you get pretty good,</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re pretty good at it.</p>
<p>But even like, even for Magnus,</p>
<p>I think when we look at it and you see like these things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve spent 20, 30 years playing this game,</p>
<p>and it just, it doesn&rsquo;t click.</p>
<p>And then you see it, it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it really is beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re known for being a very aggressive player.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your approach to being willing to take big risks</p>
<p>at the chessboard?</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>I was a very aggressive player,</p>
<p>probably until I got to about this 2,700 Elo.</p>
<p>And then it kind of, my style changed a little bit.</p>
<p>I think what it is, is I like to play attacking chess.</p>
<p>I loved playing openings like the King&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>the Sicilian Eidorff as well,</p>
<p>when I was a little bit younger.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, why not try to fight with both colors?</p>
<p>Try to fight in every game and win if you can.</p>
<p>Try as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things is, as you get better and better,</p>
<p>players are also better and better prepared.</p>
<p>So you have diminishing returns</p>
<p>when you play these very aggressive openings</p>
<p>like the King&rsquo;s Indian or even the Dutch,</p>
<p>which I played for a while.</p>
<p>You can only, it only takes you so far.</p>
<p>And then at a point, people figure out</p>
<p>what, how to respond to those choices.</p>
<p>So I still do play these openings.</p>
<p>For example, I played a tournament in St. Louis</p>
<p>about three weeks ago</p>
<p>and I played a great King&rsquo;s Indian game,</p>
<p>which I won against Jeffrey Zhang, an American junior player.</p>
<p>So I still do play it here and there.</p>
<p>But when you start playing it every game,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point at which when you lose these games,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t, it becomes too much.</p>
<p>And I spoke about this in the C Squared podcast</p>
<p>where I played the Eidorff.</p>
<p>And then I played Fabiano Caruana,</p>
<p>a very strong American player as well.</p>
<p>And he just blew me off the board</p>
<p>in like four straight games.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, enough, enough of this.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t keep doing it.</p>
<p>Because, do you think he prepared for that opening then?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because you see what have,</p>
<p>what has my opponent been playing recently?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s their ideas?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to prepare for those ideas</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been playing with.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah, that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>And also you have to be very self-critical</p>
<p>because for Fabiano,</p>
<p>the Eidorff was the one opening he did very poorly against,</p>
<p>but he worked really hard</p>
<p>and he came up with a lot of different ideas</p>
<p>and he solved that weakness.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also known of having a bit of an ego.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of ego in chess?</p>
<p>Is it helpful or does it get in the way?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a fine line.</p>
<p>I think you have to be very confident</p>
<p>in order to get to the top.</p>
<p>I know some players are very expressive like myself,</p>
<p>like Kasparov and others.</p>
<p>There are other people like Anand who don&rsquo;t express it,</p>
<p>but then there was a book</p>
<p>that I think was released fairly recently</p>
<p>where he basically said like he was really angry in his room</p>
<p>when he was banging walls or doing something with chairs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact story,</p>
<p>but he was able to, in public,</p>
<p>he kept it very buttoned up,</p>
<p>but then in private, he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think you have to have that edge.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that edge</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get upset when you lose games</p>
<p>because you will lose games along the way,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s impossible to get anywhere near the top.</p>
<p>So I think every top player has that ego</p>
<p>or extreme confidence that is necessary.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that, you&rsquo;ll never, I think,</p>
<p>get to the top, probably in almost any field, frankly.</p>
<p>Do you have to believe you&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>to have the capacity to be the best in the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you have to have that.</p>
<p>I think, for me, it wasn&rsquo;t really ever about</p>
<p>thinking I&rsquo;m the best in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about going into that game.</p>
<p>That game, whoever I&rsquo;m playing,</p>
<p>I believe that I can beat them</p>
<p>or I know that I&rsquo;m gonna beat them</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m better than them.</p>
<p>For me, it was always about that,</p>
<p>whenever I&rsquo;m in that moment in the game,</p>
<p>just knowing that I can do that.</p>
<p>I think that is also another thing</p>
<p>that when you start playing more and more</p>
<p>in these top tournaments,</p>
<p>you kind of lose that sometimes</p>
<p>because the positions,</p>
<p>you have the same opening strategies.</p>
<p>You end up with positions that are very drawish</p>
<p>where you reach end games, things of this nature,</p>
<p>and so it can also make you very jaded as well</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve been up there for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Were there times you were an asshole to someone</p>
<p>and you regret it at the chessboard or beyond?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think-</p>
<p>Asking internet questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is definitely true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna pretend it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I was very angry</p>
<p>when I would lose games on the internet.</p>
<p>Many of these stories are specifically</p>
<p>from the internet, of course,</p>
<p>and I think I look back on it,</p>
<p>and of course, I wish that I had been able</p>
<p>to channel the anger differently.</p>
<p>Basically, I think the simple gist of it is</p>
<p>I would play Blitz games online, and when I lost,</p>
<p>I would get angry at my opponents</p>
<p>instead of getting angry at myself,</p>
<p>which, of course, it&rsquo;s silly</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re playing the game.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to win.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t they try to beat you?</p>
<p>I think, for me, I&rsquo;m not happy about that</p>
<p>when I was a young teenager,</p>
<p>getting so angry over these online games</p>
<p>and insulting a lot of people along the way.</p>
<p>But maybe that paved the way to your streaming career.</p>
<p>I think, for me, I feel like having</p>
<p>that me-against-the-world attitude, though,</p>
<p>it really fueled me when I was younger,</p>
<p>feeling like it was me against the world,</p>
<p>everyone hating me or me hating the world.</p>
<p>That was very important.</p>
<p>I was able to channel that anger</p>
<p>in a way that really helped me improve.</p>
<p>So do I regret it?</p>
<p>On the one hand, yes.</p>
<p>Of course, I think you don&rsquo;t wanna be like that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, where I&rsquo;ve gotten as good as I am,</p>
<p>if it was different, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>So, mix.</p>
<p>Well, then I&rsquo;ll ask you to empathize with somebody else</p>
<p>who currently has a me-against-the-world attitude</p>
<p>and is helping him, which is Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>For several reasons,</p>
<p>he has a me-against-the-world kind of attitude.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, there&rsquo;s been a chess controversy</p>
<p>about cheating and so on that you&rsquo;ve covered.</p>
<p>People should subscribe to your channel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hilarious, entertaining, brilliant,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fun to learn from you.</p>
<p>Do you think, as we stand now,</p>
<p>Hans ever cheated in over-the-board chess,</p>
<p>as things stand now at the beginning of October?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a very tough question for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, when people refer to evidence</p>
<p>in regards to whether Hans cheated over-the-board,</p>
<p>there is not, and I don&rsquo;t think there ever will be,</p>
<p>quote-unquote, hard evidence.</p>
<p>The only thing that would ever constitute that</p>
<p>is if he&rsquo;s caught in the act.</p>
<p>Literally, he&rsquo;s caught using a phone with an earpiece,</p>
<p>whatever it might be.</p>
<p>That is the only way that there would ever be hard evidence.</p>
<p>So, as it stands right now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>How much of it is legitimate or not remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I know people have questioned the statistics.</p>
<p>Some people think it&rsquo;s very convincing.</p>
<p>Some people think it&rsquo;s complete nonsense.</p>
<p>I think that right now, I&rsquo;m very undecided,</p>
<p>but I do feel that within the next three to six months,</p>
<p>assuming Hans is able to play over-the-board</p>
<p>in more and more tournaments,</p>
<p>the stats will make it very clear,</p>
<p>one way or the other, based on our results,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s legitimate or not.</p>
<p>I think, for me, I would say that regardless</p>
<p>of whether I believe he cheated or not,</p>
<p>he is playing at probably at least 2,650, no matter what.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether he cheated or not,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already at that level, which is very, very high.</p>
<p>So, I think the stats will bear it out</p>
<p>in the next probably, I said three to six months,</p>
<p>probably I would say next six to 12 months,</p>
<p>whether something happened, but I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you find compelling or interesting</p>
<p>the kind of analysis where you compare</p>
<p>the correlation between engines and humans</p>
<p>to try to determine if cheating was done in part?</p>
<p>So, initially, I thought that</p>
<p>that was actually quite legitimate,</p>
<p>but as I found out much more recently,</p>
<p>anybody can basically upload this data.</p>
<p>So, that whole theory,</p>
<p>while it seemed very convincing at the time,</p>
<p>it simply isn&rsquo;t any statistical evidence in my opinion now.</p>
<p>But there are games from some of those tournaments</p>
<p>that definitely, considering where his rating was,</p>
<p>look very suspicious in 2020, I would say.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s not the role of myself to decide</p>
<p>or Chess.com, that&rsquo;s obviously gonna be up to FIDE,</p>
<p>whether they think that&rsquo;s compelling evidence or not.</p>
<p>I think, for me, what I would say</p>
<p>from an intuitive standpoint is that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in this world for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen most of the juniors</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ve risen through the ranks,</p>
<p>Magnus and many others,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always been something about them</p>
<p>that has stood out to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been like a brilliant game</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve played against someone who&rsquo;s much higher rated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just seen it from all of those players.</p>
<p>I never really saw that with Hans Niemann,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very difficult for me to sort of,</p>
<p>with my own two eyes, being in this chess world so long,</p>
<p>see things a certain way,</p>
<p>and then something that&rsquo;s never happened before</p>
<p>is happening, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it is still possible.</p>
<p>It is completely possible that Hans,</p>
<p>something clicked at a certain age and he started improving</p>
<p>in spite of the fact that the statistics look weird</p>
<p>in terms of his rating improvement.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I sort of,</p>
<p>I think that in six to 12 months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably be able to say one way or the other</p>
<p>with very certain confidence,</p>
<p>like whether he should be there or not.</p>
<p>Speaking of statistics, I should ask,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about this, are you a data scientist?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>No, of course I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing, you see all these stats</p>
<p>are thrown out there and you try to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s being said, but it&rsquo;s also very scary</p>
<p>because when you see these things that look very legitimate</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re disproven,</p>
<p>or people say you&rsquo;re cherry picking the dates</p>
<p>and all these other things,</p>
<p>it almost feels like you can come to any conclusion</p>
<p>that you want to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think this is such a serious issue</p>
<p>for the world of chess because going forward,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t take it seriously now,</p>
<p>I think at some point there is the potential</p>
<p>for a much, much larger scandal.</p>
<p>Do you agree that, like what Magnus I think said,</p>
<p>that it is an existential threat to chess,</p>
<p>like this is a very serious problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only going to get bigger</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically, from a spectator perspective,</p>
<p>from a competitor perspective,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not sure that you can trust any of the results.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s for sure true.</p>
<p>When I think back to the last five to 10 years,</p>
<p>there are plenty of top level tournaments that I played in</p>
<p>where there was no security at all.</p>
<p>You would just go into the auditorium and play your games</p>
<p>and that was that.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s a big issue.</p>
<p>I think it has been a big issue,</p>
<p>but the reason it&rsquo;s only coming to light now</p>
<p>is because it features a very strong junior player</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very close to the world&rsquo;s elite.</p>
<p>There have been many cheating scandals before.</p>
<p>There was this French player, Sebastian Feller.</p>
<p>There was this player, Igor Rouses from Latvia.</p>
<p>There was this, I think it was from Belarus,</p>
<p>or maybe I have that wrong, maybe it was Bulgaria,</p>
<p>Borislav Ivanov as well.</p>
<p>Those are three big cheating scandals,</p>
<p>but they were not at the absolute top levels of chess,</p>
<p>which I think is why it never became the huge news story</p>
<p>that this is, or it wasn&rsquo;t viewed in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I think organizers were perhaps</p>
<p>a little bit too lax in terms of security.</p>
<p>So you said 2,650.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Hans is in fact</p>
<p>a kind of Bobby Fischer level of genius,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s capable at times of genius at the chessboard?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>100%, that is absolutely possible.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why I think for everybody in the situation,</p>
<p>we wanna see what happens in the next six to 12 months,</p>
<p>because I think it will be very clear.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s very interesting to me</p>
<p>because there are other stats from that 72-page report</p>
<p>that chess.com compiled, which in essence,</p>
<p>say certain other junior players basically have peaked,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not likely to improve further.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also gonna be very interesting</p>
<p>when you look at those, I think it was like 50 pages</p>
<p>of graphs, because there are graphs that say</p>
<p>some of the other junior players are done.</p>
<p>So when we look forward in a year or two,</p>
<p>if those players don&rsquo;t improve,</p>
<p>it will also say something about their methods as well</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve used to sort of compile this data.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder what those junior players do</p>
<p>if they look at that data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a point where you should look at yourself</p>
<p>practically, what is the actual empirical data</p>
<p>over the past year of how much I&rsquo;ve improved</p>
<p>at a particular thing?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s one thing to kind of tell yourself</p>
<p>that these are the ways I need to improve,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another to actually look at the data</p>
<p>and face the reality of it.</p>
<p>Right, I think also that could have a psychological effect.</p>
<p>That is the other thing that makes</p>
<p>the whole Han situation so tough,</p>
<p>because if you think that he&rsquo;s cheated</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re unsure about what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>that is another psychological factor</p>
<p>whenever you play against him.</p>
<p>In his favor or against him?</p>
<p>Definitely in his favor, because, for example,</p>
<p>if I go online and play against the computer,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say I go play against Sawfish tomorrow,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna play a very certain type of opening strategy,</p>
<p>try to keep the board closed and maybe hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>Now, computers have gotten so good</p>
<p>that generally even that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have a chance even with such strategies,</p>
<p>but you play differently than you normally would.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re playing a game against him</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a move that looks really weird,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem logical at all,</p>
<p>that can also start to affect you</p>
<p>where you immediately make a mistake</p>
<p>or you start questioning yourself,</p>
<p>you start thinking, well, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Is there something unbecoming?</p>
<p>Like, you start worrying about what is happening.</p>
<p>And so it definitely is, it&rsquo;s a very tough situation.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Magnus&rsquo; decision to forfeit the match,</p>
<p>his most recent match with Hans?</p>
<p>Oh, tough question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, in my heart of hearts,</p>
<p>I feel like there had to be a better way to handle it</p>
<p>than what Magnus did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sort of being in this world</p>
<p>of top grandmasters,</p>
<p>having heard these rumors for two years,</p>
<p>I think that the fact that it was blown off</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t treated seriously,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there was a better option.</p>
<p>So in my heart of hearts,</p>
<p>I feel like there had to be a better way to handle it,</p>
<p>but in practicality, like in the practical world,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think he might&rsquo;ve made the only decision</p>
<p>where it became a big issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess I would have loved to see</p>
<p>just where 100% it&rsquo;s certain that there&rsquo;s no cheating</p>
<p>involved, that they play a bunch of games.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there was actually an article</p>
<p>that was released today by Ken Rogoff,</p>
<p>who is a grandmaster at Chess,</p>
<p>where he wrote this article in the Boston Globe,</p>
<p>and he essentially said that,</p>
<p>like have Hans and Magnus play a match</p>
<p>and see what his score is,</p>
<p>because statistically, if it&rsquo;s above a certain percentage,</p>
<p>that means he&rsquo;s legitimate,</p>
<p>because of course you have security.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s below, that might mean,</p>
<p>that probably means that he&rsquo;s not at the level that he&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a real way</p>
<p>to settle it necessarily,</p>
<p>because also for Magnus,</p>
<p>to ask him to play against someone who&rsquo;s cheated,</p>
<p>I think for him, he just,</p>
<p>he would never entertain the idea,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why am I going to play against someone who cheated?</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>And you know, the one other thing I would say on the topic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important to note is,</p>
<p>this sort of came from left field for most people</p>
<p>who are in the general public or very casual chess players,</p>
<p>but this is not something that wasn&rsquo;t known,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even on the radar.</p>
<p>I think this has not been said before,</p>
<p>but there was one of these things where they talk about</p>
<p>how Hans has, he&rsquo;s played better during a period of time</p>
<p>when games were broadcast versus not broadcast.</p>
<p>I actually heard this rumor two years ago,</p>
<p>during one of the terms he&rsquo;s playing specifically.</p>
<p>So that is the thing,</p>
<p>is that this has been out there for a very long time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>because you do believe that Magnus</p>
<p>could have handled it better,</p>
<p>but if it was two years of these rumors</p>
<p>and nothing was done about it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s broadcast, it&rsquo;s easier to cheat,</p>
<p>because you can have,</p>
<p>it removes one of the challenges of cheating,</p>
<p>which is the one-way communication</p>
<p>from the board to the engine.</p>
<p>Here, the engine can just watch the broadcast,</p>
<p>and then all you have to do is send signals right back.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;ve woken up to this fact.</p>
<p>I actually programmed,</p>
<p>so setting all the silly sex toys aside,</p>
<p>I have a bunch of these devices.</p>
<p>This is the size of a coin,</p>
<p>and it has a high-resolution vibration that you can send.</p>
<p>So you can just have this in your pocket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically what your smartphone has,</p>
<p>ability to vibrate.</p>
<p>You can do programmatic communication through anything.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is the easiest.</p>
<p>So this made me wonder like,</p>
<p>wait a minute, how often does this happen?</p>
<p>Like at every level of play.</p>
<p>And you said this only became a huge concern</p>
<p>at the highest level of play,</p>
<p>but then how much cheating is going on</p>
<p>at like the middle level of play,</p>
<p>especially when more money is involved.</p>
<p>So in the game of poker, when like,</p>
<p>it really made me think like the future</p>
<p>will have devices like this much easier to,</p>
<p>like you will engineer smaller and smaller and smaller</p>
<p>devices that have onboard compute that like,</p>
<p>like this is the future.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, it makes me,</p>
<p>I think probably with all kinds of cybersecurity,</p>
<p>that means the defense will just have to get,</p>
<p>start to get better.</p>
<p>Even with chess, it seems like the security is very clumsy.</p>
<p>Just looking at the scanning of the recent tournament.</p>
<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll see is that a lot of people are talking</p>
<p>about whether Hans is a cheater or not.</p>
<p>The one thing that almost nobody is doing</p>
<p>is actually like trying to show how it can be done.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s basically avoiding that.</p>
<p>I think the single biggest reason for that</p>
<p>is simply because it can be done very easily</p>
<p>at like a weekend tournament.</p>
<p>If you play a weekend tournament</p>
<p>where the top prize is a hundred dollars</p>
<p>and the players are maybe mass level,</p>
<p>somebody could already do this.</p>
<p>Because even in St. Louis now where they have the security,</p>
<p>my understanding is the non-linear junction device</p>
<p>they bought costs about $11,000.</p>
<p>And organizers, if you have a weekend tournament</p>
<p>at the local club, you don&rsquo;t have $11,000 to spend</p>
<p>on such a device.</p>
<p>And so that is why a lot of people have been talking about it</p>
<p>but I think it is very, very serious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it is good even if,</p>
<p>aside from Hans even, it is a very important question</p>
<p>or debate to be having at the present moment.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s good to talk about it, right?</p>
<p>To make it so that the defenses will really step up.</p>
<p>I think you could do pretty cheap,</p>
<p>like the security pretty cheaply.</p>
<p>But you have to take it seriously.</p>
<p>Right, right, of course.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna end up being on FIDE</p>
<p>more than anyone else to try and do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think asking the organizers to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like FIDE, they are the governing body.</p>
<p>It will be on them at the end of the day to figure it out.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting to see what happens</p>
<p>in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Will you play Hans if the opportunity arises?</p>
<p>Well, right now that&rsquo;s not in the near future for me.</p>
<p>I think fortunately.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, because there&rsquo;s maybe only one tournament</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m playing in that he could be playing in potentially</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not even set to be happening</p>
<p>at the end of the year.</p>
<p>There might be like a World Blitz</p>
<p>and Rapid Chess Championship.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m gonna have to make that decision</p>
<p>for at least another six months.</p>
<p>What about a challenge match?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of, you&rsquo;re the most famous</p>
<p>super grandmaster in terms of online.</p>
<p>So it makes sense in terms of chess is going through</p>
<p>a kind of like a serious controversy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like the drama or something like this.</p>
<p>This is in part an existential threat to the game</p>
<p>in terms of how the public perceives the game.</p>
<p>So if the story that lingers from this</p>
<p>is chess is full of cheaters,</p>
<p>like you never know who is cheating or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good for the game.</p>
<p>So it makes sense for a high profile person</p>
<p>to go head to head.</p>
<p>How do you think you&rsquo;d do against Hans?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I would probably beat him</p>
<p>in Blitz and Rapid.</p>
<p>Classical is a whole different question altogether.</p>
<p>I think in Blitz and Rapid I would.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing actually that was very telling</p>
<p>in both the report and also Hans&rsquo; interview</p>
<p>for all the other stuff that was said</p>
<p>is the one thing he did say and seemed very adamant about</p>
<p>was the fact that he had never cheated against me.</p>
<p>Which, so that was the one thing he did say</p>
<p>that at least according to the report was truthful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something possibly down the road to consider.</p>
<p>But I do want to see what happens</p>
<p>with everything else first,</p>
<p>with FIDE and whatever they choose to do</p>
<p>in regards to Hans and Magnus.</p>
<p>And then see where the smoke stands.</p>
<p>But I think also one other thing</p>
<p>that is potentially very dangerous</p>
<p>about the whole situation is that I&rsquo;m not convinced</p>
<p>that FIDE actually has the ultimate say in this</p>
<p>in that the top players,</p>
<p>if they feel that he has cheated over the board,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a report that says he has,</p>
<p>that Hans has not cheated,</p>
<p>top players can still decide not to play him</p>
<p>and sort of override whatever</p>
<p>ultimate decision FIDE comes to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s very unclear.</p>
<p>You know, this term, the U.S. Championship,</p>
<p>Hans qualified, he&rsquo;s playing the tournament.</p>
<p>But beyond this, there are no terms</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s automatically qualified to.</p>
<p>And so it also is on the top players</p>
<p>to sort of have to reach some conclusion</p>
<p>on their own separate defeating.</p>
<p>So to flip that, is there some part of you</p>
<p>that regrets that the chess community</p>
<p>and you included implied that Hans cheated early on?</p>
<p>And I think without having evidence,</p>
<p>and that kind of thing, as we learn now, can stick, right?</p>
<p>And it kind of divided the chess community in part,</p>
<p>but like, I mean, I guess I do want to empathize.</p>
<p>From your position, can you empathize with Hans</p>
<p>that his reputation is essentially in part</p>
<p>or in whole destroyed at this point?</p>
<p>Yes, I absolutely can.</p>
<p>Again, I think it comes down to the specifics</p>
<p>of how it was handled.</p>
<p>Now, as far as I go, I was covering the news</p>
<p>and this is what makes it so difficult for me</p>
<p>versus say some of the other content creators</p>
<p>is that I do in a sense have that inside knowledge.</p>
<p>You know, again, this is probably,</p>
<p>this is also not really public knowledge,</p>
<p>but when I went to St. Louis</p>
<p>to play this Rapid and Blitz tournament</p>
<p>before the Sinkfield Cup happened,</p>
<p>where Magnus and Hans were playing,</p>
<p>there were people who told me very specifically</p>
<p>that they thought he was cheating.</p>
<p>Other players in the event,</p>
<p>they even gave me like actual theories</p>
<p>about like things in his shoes, things of this nature.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in a very awkward spot there as well,</p>
<p>because I know why, I mean, I was like 99% sure</p>
<p>why Magnus dropped out.</p>
<p>It would have come out regardless though.</p>
<p>It would have come out no matter what,</p>
<p>because Magnus was not going to back down</p>
<p>on his stance about Hans</p>
<p>and others would have brought it up anyways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>I think if you want to look for blame,</p>
<p>I think probably it would be on chess.com ultimately,</p>
<p>because they were the ones who probably</p>
<p>could have nipped all this in the bud</p>
<p>at a much earlier stage</p>
<p>and it wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to where it got to.</p>
<p>Because they could have released the online cheating</p>
<p>and that would have&hellip;</p>
<p>I think, yeah, I think they could have released that.</p>
<p>I think also they could have probably not let him play</p>
<p>after it happened the second time as well,</p>
<p>because it seems like it happened like,</p>
<p>I think it was at least like four or five different times.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked very, very closely at that,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t just an isolated incident.</p>
<p>And so I think if there is blame for that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely on chess.com,</p>
<p>which should stop people from thinking</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in some way influenced by&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, are you biased because&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you supported in part by chess.com?</p>
<p>Yes, I am, I am.</p>
<p>So does that affect your bias?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite independent of them.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s interesting to note</p>
<p>is that a lot of people are under the assumption</p>
<p>that when I do like broadcasts of tournaments</p>
<p>or things of this nature,</p>
<p>that chess.com is actively helping me.</p>
<p>They are not helping me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent contractor.</p>
<p>And so my opinions are my own.</p>
<p>And there are no lists given to me about like cheaters,</p>
<p>anything of this nature.</p>
<p>That has always been completely separate.</p>
<p>Do they have compromising video of you</p>
<p>that forces you to, if you don&rsquo;t follow the main narrative</p>
<p>that they will release that video publicly?</p>
<p>No, they definitely don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think when I look at it all,</p>
<p>I feel like if people are looking for someone to blame,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually Magnus at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on chess.com very squarely</p>
<p>for not handling it sooner.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay with like Magnus being silent</p>
<p>for long periods of time?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know why Magnus is still silent</p>
<p>because my read of the situation</p>
<p>was that there was some sort of NDA</p>
<p>or there was some information that chess.com had</p>
<p>that they could not release.</p>
<p>And so my read of it was Magnus was essentially saying</p>
<p>the same thing chess.com said,</p>
<p>where like I can&rsquo;t say anything about it</p>
<p>because of whatever or whatnot.</p>
<p>But then chess.com releases what I perceive to be</p>
<p>the stuff that they could not talk about anyway.</p>
<p>And Magnus still isn&rsquo;t saying anything.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>why Magnus has not said anything further on that.</p>
<p>There could be legal implications</p>
<p>of accusing somebody of cheating over the board.</p>
<p>That could be like lawsuits</p>
<p>that he just doesn&rsquo;t want the headaches.</p>
<p>He just wants to focus on the game</p>
<p>and have fun playing the game</p>
<p>and not get bogged down into lawyers</p>
<p>and all that kind of bullshit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>But Magnus could also take the other route</p>
<p>and just say, well, he cheated online in a hundred games.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not gonna play against a cheater.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very easy to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s factual, it&rsquo;s proven.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t have to go</p>
<p>into the speculation of over the board.</p>
<p>So I find it a little bit odd</p>
<p>that Magnus hasn&rsquo;t said anything further.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s also kind of peculiar</p>
<p>because Magnus&rsquo; reputation is also kind of in tatters</p>
<p>in a sense.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people are not happy with him</p>
<p>for what he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>But still he goes and plays this tournament</p>
<p>in this European Club Cup tournament</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just gaining like 10 points</p>
<p>as though nothing has happened.</p>
<p>So I mean, I don&rsquo;t really know where Magnus&rsquo; head is at</p>
<p>because like if I was in that situation</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s coming after me</p>
<p>for making such an accusation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way I would be able to play chess</p>
<p>anywhere near the level that Magnus is playing at.</p>
<p>So the whole situation is, yeah, it&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder where his mind is at</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s able to play at that level.</p>
<p>Before I forget, let me ask you a technical question</p>
<p>about cheating at your level.</p>
<p>Not your level, but at a very high Grandmaster level.</p>
<p>How much information do you need?</p>
<p>This is a technical question.</p>
<p>So for me, in terms of Morse code</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>I would need the full information.</p>
<p>So I would need probably, in order to make a move,</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s think about a very simple representation.</p>
<p>I would need two squares.</p>
<p>The first to designate which piece</p>
<p>and the second where the piece is moving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the easiest.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the smallest amount of information</p>
<p>you need to help you?</p>
<p>Basically like a buzz in a critical position.</p>
<p>That would be good.</p>
<p>And what would the buzz say?</p>
<p>It basically would be something like</p>
<p>one buzz means the position is great</p>
<p>and two buzzes means the position is completely equal</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s nothing special in the position.</p>
<p>Oh, so just to know that it&rsquo;s great will tell you what?</p>
<p>It will tell me with my intuition.</p>
<p>There are many times I play Blitz online,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something along the lines of,</p>
<p>I can feel like there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I feel like there has to be a good move</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m probably winning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>And most of the time, I&rsquo;m actually right about it.</p>
<p>Like after the game, when I look with the computer,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s like, oh, I should have played this move</p>
<p>and it would have given me a big advantage</p>
<p>or I would have outright won the game.</p>
<p>So if I just know whether there&rsquo;s something there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s worth it to calculate here.</p>
<p>Yes, and I can follow that intuition probably to,</p>
<p>because what normally is gonna happen in such a situation</p>
<p>is there probably are two moves or three moves max</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna consider in a really critical position.</p>
<p>Like if I feel like there&rsquo;s something there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re two to three moves.</p>
<p>So if I know something is there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to figure it out</p>
<p>if I know that the position is very good.</p>
<p>Okay, one buzz for a good position.</p>
<p>For the current position, not for the next position.</p>
<p>So I just need to know.</p>
<p>I just need to know whether there&rsquo;s something really good,</p>
<p>the position&rsquo;s really good,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just like an equal position or it&rsquo;s just normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I need to know.</p>
<p>So the current position, not even future moves,</p>
<p>just the current position, there is a lot of promise here.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, what about the reverse, like something&rsquo;s bad?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying if I&rsquo;m in trouble in a game</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in the same situation.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m in trouble in a game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a little bit more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably like I would say two to three times</p>
<p>where I would need to know.</p>
<p>The source of the trouble.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would need to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would need to know is there one move that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s more than one move.</p>
<p>Again, how you extrapolate that.</p>
<p>Well, wouldn&rsquo;t it be useful to know the information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re now in a position where the other person</p>
<p>could create a lot of trouble for you?</p>
<p>So find that, like it&rsquo;s out there, find it.</p>
<p>Like if you look at Magnus&rsquo; games,</p>
<p>there are a lot of situations where the position is equal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s equal with one move, but only one move.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t find that one move, you&rsquo;re significantly worse.</p>
<p>A lot of times that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So if I can somehow know that there&rsquo;s only one move</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m okay, I could figure it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s one move is significantly better</p>
<p>than the rest.</p>
<p>I mean, I could give you like a perfect example</p>
<p>as I played a game in the Canada&rsquo;s tournament last round</p>
<p>against Ding Liren from China.</p>
<p>And there were many times where it was completely fine</p>
<p>for me, but it started drifting.</p>
<p>I started making some mistakes and I was worse,</p>
<p>but there was one last moment where I think I had one move</p>
<p>where I would have been able to draw the game quite easily.</p>
<p>And every other move I was significantly worse.</p>
<p>And I did not find that move and I lost the game.</p>
<p>But if I had known.</p>
<p>It would have been nice to have a buzz right then.</p>
<p>Yes, I would have known.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the greatest player of all time?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked in from different angles on this.</p>
<p>Magnus Carlsen, Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer,</p>
<p>many others.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for each?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for you?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I can&rsquo;t make the case for me.</p>
<p>Be serious.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of people who want that kind of like</p>
<p>me to give off some kind of ego like that, but no.</p>
<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m nowhere near the conversation.</p>
<p>I actually, on that note, I would say also,</p>
<p>I know people wanted to know if I&rsquo;m the greatest player</p>
<p>to never have played for the world championship</p>
<p>or to have not got not become world champion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m actually anywhere near the top</p>
<p>of that conversation.</p>
<p>I actually think Levon Aronian tops that conversation</p>
<p>by a big margin simply because he was number two</p>
<p>in the world for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And he never even got to the match.</p>
<p>So as far as world champions and who&rsquo;s the GOAT,</p>
<p>I think Magnus is the GOAT simply because he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>the best chess by a bigger margin.</p>
<p>He has the highest ELO of all time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, chess is a game where, you know,</p>
<p>you build upon the giants of the past.</p>
<p>We learn from them.</p>
<p>And so you can definitely make the case for Gary as well.</p>
<p>I mean, he was the number one player in the world</p>
<p>for 20 plus years.</p>
<p>Lot of opening strategies he came up with</p>
<p>and people still play them today.</p>
<p>Bobby, I&rsquo;m not so sure you can really make that case</p>
<p>because he shot up really quickly,</p>
<p>but he was the world champion for a very short window</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>And then he quit the game as soon as he became</p>
<p>world champion.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really feel like you can put Fisher</p>
<p>in that conversation simply because he didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that longevity at all.</p>
<p>He was up there for a couple of years.</p>
<p>So I would say it&rsquo;s probably Magnus,</p>
<p>but I understand people can also say Gary&rsquo;s the best player</p>
<p>ever, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But I think if Magnus is number one for probably another,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say another three to four years,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any debate at all.</p>
<p>Can you break down what makes him so good?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about different angles of this.</p>
<p>And then I would also try to get the same from you</p>
<p>because we talked about early Hikaru.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d like to talk about that fuller,</p>
<p>but first Magnus, what makes Magnus so good?</p>
<p>What are the various aspects of his game</p>
<p>that make him so good?</p>
<p>I think for Magnus, he just,</p>
<p>you know that in the end games, if you get there,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s not going to blunder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you reach an end game,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not going to make a mistake.</p>
<p>He obviously plays great openings</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just really no defined weakness that he has.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no weakness that I can think of very specifically.</p>
<p>Many, there are many times where players actually</p>
<p>out-prepare him in the opening phase,</p>
<p>but as soon as they&rsquo;re on their own</p>
<p>and they have to think,</p>
<p>very oftentimes they&rsquo;ll make mistakes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just no weakness for Magnus, really no weakness.</p>
<p>Unlike say Kasparov, like Kasparov on the other hand,</p>
<p>there are very clear weaknesses in his game,</p>
<p>like Kramnik exploited them.</p>
<p>First of all, very, I don&rsquo;t want to say like,</p>
<p>ego is the right word, but like very stubborn,</p>
<p>believing that his openings were infallible,</p>
<p>that he could just win, he could just prove an advantage</p>
<p>and win the game out of the opening,</p>
<p>like against Kramnik when he ultimately lost.</p>
<p>Also generally not a great defender either,</p>
<p>very strong tactically,</p>
<p>but if he was in positions that were defensive,</p>
<p>he would make mistakes and lose in end games,</p>
<p>like he did in one of those games</p>
<p>in the World Championship against Kramnik.</p>
<p>So there were very clear defined weaknesses</p>
<p>in Kasparov&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>Whereas like Magnus, they&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>there are no clearly defined weaknesses.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t like being attacked.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the one thing.</p>
<p>He likes king safety and he doesn&rsquo;t like being attacked,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not something that you can easily do.</p>
<p>Whereas say, if someone&rsquo;s very tactical</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not as strong positionally,</p>
<p>that is something you can def,</p>
<p>that will happen quite frequently in games.</p>
<p>You can steer games a certain way,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll always get there,</p>
<p>but that is something tangible.</p>
<p>Whereas king safety, that&rsquo;s not something tangible at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very hard to attack someone based on,</p>
<p>unless they play certain style of openings.</p>
<p>Do you think Garry Kasparov reflecting</p>
<p>in your comment would agree?</p>
<p>Like, what is it about his relationship with Kramnik</p>
<p>that was so challenging?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s because Kramnik understood him.</p>
<p>Actually, one thing that&rsquo;s funny speaking of Kasparov</p>
<p>is that I think it got under his skin.</p>
<p>Like when I worked with him,</p>
<p>Kramnik actually played a certain style,</p>
<p>very like, very aggressive,</p>
<p>very sort of risky opening play</p>
<p>during the time when I was working with Garry.</p>
<p>And I know that it annoyed Garry because he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t Kramnik play like this against me?</p>
<p>Because I think Garry felt if Kramnik did that against him,</p>
<p>he would have just blown him off the board</p>
<p>and had many great victories.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s Kramnik understood Garry.</p>
<p>They had worked together, I think, during the late 90s.</p>
<p>I think Garry actually was very useful or very helpful</p>
<p>in terms of Kramnik getting a spot</p>
<p>on one of the Russian Chess Olympiad teams in the mid 90s.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just Kramnik understood him very well</p>
<p>and Garry just could not, he couldn&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>And I think also another thing,</p>
<p>coming back to the psychological part,</p>
<p>is that Kramnik actually beat Kasparov in many games</p>
<p>in the King&rsquo;s Indian Defense.</p>
<p>Kasparov played the King&rsquo;s Indian Defense for many years</p>
<p>and then he started losing like four or five games</p>
<p>in a row in it to Kramnik,</p>
<p>very similar to what I mentioned</p>
<p>about the Sicilian Night Orphan Fabiano.</p>
<p>And Garry gave it up.</p>
<p>He started switching to playing the Grunfeld Defense.</p>
<p>And so I think that also instilled</p>
<p>some psychological fear as well,</p>
<p>because Garry was, he was the boss.</p>
<p>In openings, no one could compare to him.</p>
<p>What makes you so good?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>of Fikaro Nakamura?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think probably my biggest strength</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m a universal player.</p>
<p>I can play pretty much any opening strategy.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think it&rsquo;s mainly</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t really make many blunders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make blunders unless I&rsquo;m under</p>
<p>a lot of pressure generally.</p>
<p>So that, I mean, I know I&rsquo;m oversimplifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as simple as that.</p>
<p>Does this apply to Blitz as well?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s much more applicable to Blitz in particular</p>
<p>because my intuition is very good.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m making less blunders</p>
<p>with limited time on the clock,</p>
<p>my opponents actually make a lot more blunders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s much more pronounced</p>
<p>in Blitz than it is in classical chess,</p>
<p>because in Blitz, when you&rsquo;re down to like 10 seconds</p>
<p>in the game, both players have 10 seconds,</p>
<p>my intuition is just better than theirs.</p>
<p>I mean, Magnus, maybe not so clear,</p>
<p>but if you look at other players,</p>
<p>say Fabiano Caruana, a very strong player,</p>
<p>when he gets down to 10 seconds or in these situations,</p>
<p>he almost always makes a blunder, almost always.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just more precise.</p>
<p>I make less blunders.</p>
<p>And that really, the effect is much more dramatic in Blitz.</p>
<p>What do you think that intuition is?</p>
<p>Like, sorry for the kind of almost philosophical question.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that calculation?</p>
<p>Or is it some kind of weird memory recall?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Like being able to do that short line prediction.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just playing so many games online</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some kind of subconscious feel that I have.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re that low on time, you can&rsquo;t calculate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you have to look,</p>
<p>you just have to figure out what&rsquo;s the move</p>
<p>you want to play as, no calculation, and just go with it.</p>
<p>And I think just playing so many games probably,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ve played over 300,000 games online.</p>
<p>And I think just playing all those games, it&rsquo;s a feel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no tangible way that I can&rsquo;t put that</p>
<p>really into words, it&rsquo;s just a feel.</p>
<p>What do you, and we should say that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I think, currently the number one ranked Blitz player</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>You have been for a while, you&rsquo;re unquestionably</p>
<p>one of the great, so classical, rapid, and Blitz,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the best people for many years in the world.</p>
<p>Okay, but you&rsquo;re currently number one in Blitz.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to kind of, for you to dig in</p>
<p>to the secret to your success in Blitz.</p>
<p>Is it, as you&rsquo;re saying, that intuition,</p>
<p>being able to, when the time is short,</p>
<p>to not make blunders, and then to make</p>
<p>a close to optimal move?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s generally that I&rsquo;m able to keep the games going</p>
<p>no matter what, until we&rsquo;re low on time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always able to do that.</p>
<p>Like if we play a game with three minutes,</p>
<p>like there are games I will just win very quickly,</p>
<p>but a lot of games between top players,</p>
<p>players have to think, you have to use time,</p>
<p>and in those final critical stages, I just don&rsquo;t blunder.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t blunder, really, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the only difference,</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s very, very strong,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of like, who is the better brain,</p>
<p>who is the better CPU, for lack of a better way</p>
<p>of putting it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who makes the split-second decisions the best?</p>
<p>And I do think that I&rsquo;m extremely good at that</p>
<p>in a way that almost nobody else is.</p>
<p>That really is the only difference,</p>
<p>is that the split-second decisions,</p>
<p>because you can get a worse position,</p>
<p>but again, if you keep the game going,</p>
<p>players have to use the time when you get down</p>
<p>to those final 10, 15 seconds.</p>
<p>I almost always end up winning in those situations.</p>
<p>What are you visualizing, like in those,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing the fast, fast calculations,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, you look at a move and you see,</p>
<p>like when it&rsquo;s like five seconds or 10 seconds,</p>
<p>you play a move and you just make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a blunder.</p>
<p>You just look, make sure it&rsquo;s not a blunder,</p>
<p>and you just go with it.</p>
<p>And the first part, though, is the feel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I see this move and it looks right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s right, I can&rsquo;t put that into words,</p>
<p>but it looks like the right move,</p>
<p>and then I look for like a split second,</p>
<p>see as long as it&rsquo;s not some kind of blunder,</p>
<p>and you just play that move.</p>
<p>Is there a bit of a tunnel vision?</p>
<p>Are you able to understand the positions</p>
<p>of all the other pieces on the board,</p>
<p>or are you just focusing it</p>
<p>on a very specific interaction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this move feels right, and so I play it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at that stage of the game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, as long as it&rsquo;s not a blunder,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just that feel.</p>
<p>There is no way for me to put that into words.</p>
<p>And that feel, like empirically,</p>
<p>does result in low probability of blunder for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t blunder.</p>
<p>Even though there could be,</p>
<p>like, you don&rsquo;t forget a random piece that was,</p>
<p>like, very, very, I mean, it does happen, of course,</p>
<p>but very rarely, and I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it on stream many times.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just, you go with the move</p>
<p>that for whatever reason, like, it just,</p>
<p>intuitively, whether it&rsquo;s from playing</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of games on the internet,</p>
<p>or just that experience, like,</p>
<p>you just intuitively can feel like the move is right, and.</p>
<p>So over those 300,000 games played over the board,</p>
<p>online, all kinds of variations,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a game that stands out to you</p>
<p>as particularly one you&rsquo;re proud of,</p>
<p>or maybe what&rsquo;s the Hikaru Immortal game,</p>
<p>or a strong candidate for that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there are two games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a game that I won against Boris Gelfand in 2010,</p>
<p>where I offered a queen sack,</p>
<p>I think, on five consecutive moves.</p>
<p>Sack is sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sacrifice the queen, yeah, so.</p>
<p>Coming through with the lingo.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take me to that game?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s one sequence in the late middle game</p>
<p>where, it&rsquo;s funny, because I actually,</p>
<p>I think I, because I remember,</p>
<p>I tried to show this game to Peter, actually, Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>and I confused the move order in the late middle game,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to do that again.</p>
<p>2010?</p>
<p>Yeah, 2010, it was, yeah.</p>
<p>What kind of opening is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the King&rsquo;s Indian Defense.</p>
<p>So, the knights are out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with the bringing the knight back?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s black and white?</p>
<p>I have the black pieces, and you want to push the pawn.</p>
<p>The, make room for the pawn.</p>
<p>Yeah, normally in the King&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>you try to, it&rsquo;s sort of like storming with the pawns</p>
<p>on the king side where the white king is.</p>
<p>So you see now, I push,</p>
<p>and I start pushing all my pawns forward.</p>
<p>Are you happy with this position,</p>
<p>with all the pawns in diagonal like this,</p>
<p>with the knights behind it?</p>
<p>This looks pretty.</p>
<p>This is, this is, this is,</p>
<p>nowadays, this is very well-known.</p>
<p>But at the time, I, the reason that I was aware of this</p>
<p>is because I had played a tournament, I think, in Montreal.</p>
<p>I think it was Montreal, like the year, the summer before,</p>
<p>and one of my friends had actually played this variation</p>
<p>with the black pieces, so I was aware of it,</p>
<p>and it seemed very dangerous, but I,</p>
<p>From the black perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very hard for white to play.</p>
<p>Yeah, very hard for white to play.</p>
<p>It felt, feels like you&rsquo;re getting attacked.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re king, you see the black pawns</p>
<p>are coming down towards the king,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard for white to play.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very hard for white to play.</p>
<p>The black pawns are coming down towards the king,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard to defend.</p>
<p>And also, a lot of players don&rsquo;t like being attacked.</p>
<p>Generally, you try to avoid positions</p>
<p>where your king is under fire,</p>
<p>which comes back to what I said about Magnus, as well.</p>
<p>Like, he doesn&rsquo;t like it when his king is under fire,</p>
<p>and so, therefore, you can&rsquo;t always get that.</p>
<p>But you see, white had to play along</p>
<p>to get to this point, as well.</p>
<p>If white didn&rsquo;t want something this,</p>
<p>this double-edged and this complicated,</p>
<p>he could have avoided it.</p>
<p>So is the, is the black bishop also a threat?</p>
<p>Are you, like,</p>
<p>yes, the light-square bishop in the king&rsquo;s Indian</p>
<p>is vital to any attacking possibilities.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re always, like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to lose that bishop if you can help it.</p>
<p>Got it, and so, the, he&rsquo;s bringing out the knights.</p>
<p>Is there a particular moment that&rsquo;s interesting to you here?</p>
<p>So the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, so keep going?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, so I play rook F7.</p>
<p>This is all, all standard.</p>
<p>The rooks come out.</p>
<p>So I take, take.</p>
<p>Now, this is actually, this is an exception to the rule.</p>
<p>Normally, the king&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to break this pawn chain from the,</p>
<p>these are the four pawns in a row,</p>
<p>the connect four.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you break it?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s an exception where you can do that.</p>
<p>There almost are no variations</p>
<p>in the king&rsquo;s Indian where you do that.</p>
<p>You almost always retreat the bishop</p>
<p>to guard the pawn, the bishop to F8.</p>
<p>You break the pawn chain</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an exception to the rule</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not actually worried about the,</p>
<p>about white being able to push the pawn to D6 here.</p>
<p>It was probably the best game I ever played.</p>
<p>So it keeps going.</p>
<p>A5, G4.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Now, now, now the diagonal&rsquo;s there again.</p>
<p>That, that&rsquo;s, that looks threatening.</p>
<p>Right, like white basically is trying to guard the king.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to retreat this bishop from C5 to G1,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ll see in a second.</p>
<p>Actually, not quite yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, he goes, now he goes here.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s trying to guard his king</p>
<p>with the bishop on G1,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m able to keep attacking here in the next.</p>
<p>Is there any case to be made for you to take the pawn here?</p>
<p>No, that would actually be a mistake.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very high level,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a mistake</p>
<p>because white will actually not recapture the pawn.</p>
<p>And, and I, yeah, this is very high level.</p>
<p>Oh, so the pawn is.</p>
<p>The pawn like ends up in front of the king.</p>
<p>Yeah, it stops white from being,</p>
<p>the white king from being attacked basically.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So your pawn is stopping their king from being attacked.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So yeah, so it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So the pressure continues from you.</p>
<p>Right, and then I sack.</p>
<p>Is that, is that, wait, wait.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sack?</p>
<p>Oh, the.</p>
<p>Knight takes pawn, yeah.</p>
<p>Is this, what are the strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>of you throwing the knight into the abyss?</p>
<p>Well, basically I&rsquo;m gonna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m destroying the protection in front of the white king,</p>
<p>the white pawn&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And willing to take risks by placing.</p>
<p>I basically want to open up the king and try to checkmate.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t checkmate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna lose the game here</p>
<p>in the center of the board.</p>
<p>So yeah, and now there&rsquo;s some very nice moves</p>
<p>after pawn takes pawn.</p>
<p>I take this because now white takes the queen.</p>
<p>I push the pawn forward and it&rsquo;s checkmate.</p>
<p>So give me a second.</p>
<p>So your knight is taking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing pieces left and right.</p>
<p>Right, but.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re pushing the pawn forward, check.</p>
<p>He takes the pawn.</p>
<p>The rook, check.</p>
<p>So just check, check nonstop.</p>
<p>Yeah, now same thing though.</p>
<p>I keep going for this checkmate with a pawn or a bishop pawn</p>
<p>on the square in front of the king.</p>
<p>You see the queen is still hanging.</p>
<p>In fact, I actually sacked the queen again.</p>
<p>He never took the queen.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t take the queen</p>
<p>because it would be checkmate.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So constantly, and that&rsquo;s what you mean by sacrifice.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t actually, but it was.</p>
<p>Yeah, he couldn&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>He would have gotten checkmated.</p>
<p>But anyway, the smoke clears and I&rsquo;m up material here</p>
<p>and I win this game.</p>
<p>So this is the game that I would say is my favorite game.</p>
<p>Why did it stand out?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s beautiful, but just the fact that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mainly that I was able to offer the queen sacrifice</p>
<p>so many moves in a row,</p>
<p>you almost never have that opportunity.</p>
<p>And actually, normally the games you&rsquo;re going to consider</p>
<p>your best involve sacrifices.</p>
<p>And if you can sacrifice the queen,</p>
<p>that makes it very memorable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this constant theme of this one checkmate idea.</p>
<p>How often do you play with the sacrifice of a major piece?</p>
<p>Like how often do you find yourself in that position?</p>
<p>Pretty rare because players tend to avoid</p>
<p>these sorts of situations.</p>
<p>Players don&rsquo;t like games that can go either way.</p>
<p>Like both players have to sort of cooperate.</p>
<p>You have to want that kind of game</p>
<p>in order for that situation to arise.</p>
<p>And a lot of games at the top,</p>
<p>neither player wants to go into that situation</p>
<p>for the most part.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really have those opportunities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Stockfish loves those opportunities.</p>
<p>The sacrifices.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one thing also</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting to learn more and more</p>
<p>is that Stockfish and the other programs,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care about pawns.</p>
<p>You can sacrifice one pawn, two pawns, three pawns</p>
<p>in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>if the rest of your pieces are very active.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we kind of knew on a basic level</p>
<p>about the initiative is what we call it in chess,</p>
<p>where like you&rsquo;ll give up material,</p>
<p>but your pieces are very well placed.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t realize just how important that is.</p>
<p>And computers will do that all the time now.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>And even actually like they&rsquo;re in this variant Fisher Random</p>
<p>is another variant where you arrange a piece</p>
<p>on the back row.</p>
<p>They will gladly sack rooks for bishops or for knights</p>
<p>all the time, all the time.</p>
<p>What do you take from that?</p>
<p>Material imbalance or the material you give up</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as having this attack</p>
<p>or having this piece on certain squares.</p>
<p>Well, as long as you can hold on to the attack.</p>
<p>Right, and computers can.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also very tricky</p>
<p>because when we as humans sometimes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll look at an opening variation</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see something like this</p>
<p>and you want to do it in a game.</p>
<p>But the problem is we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re supposed to follow it up afterwards.</p>
<p>And so if you do that</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know how to follow up afterwards,</p>
<p>very oftentimes we&rsquo;ll make mistakes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to look at it in a human way.</p>
<p>And then of course, you end up losing in the longterm</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve given up too much material.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very double-edged sword.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s dramatic</p>
<p>and why people love those kinds of sacrifices</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re putting it all on the line.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the other game?</p>
<p>It was a game also with a queen sacrifice.</p>
<p>It was a game against this Polish player,</p>
<p>Michael Krasinkow.</p>
<p>It was played in Barcelona in 2007, I believe it was.</p>
<p>I also, I sacrificed a queen for one pawn</p>
<p>to just bring the king out into the middle of the board.</p>
<p>You actually sacrificed it?</p>
<p>Yes, I did sacrifice.</p>
<p>I took a pawn.</p>
<p>Do you want to go through that game?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re again black.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, this game you can just skip forward</p>
<p>to about like the 20th move roughly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the opening?</p>
<p>This is, I think it&rsquo;s like a Catalan.</p>
<p>It says Neo-Catalan.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s basically a Catalan opening,</p>
<p>generally very slow.</p>
<p>Neo-Catalan declined?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and now here I sack the queen for the pawn.</p>
<p>Or no, sorry, I take the knight first.</p>
<p>Sorry, knight c6, keep going.</p>
<p>So, by the way, the pawn structure here is a mess,</p>
<p>or is missing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I take the knight.</p>
<p>You take the knight with a rook.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the discovery?</p>
<p>My queen&rsquo;s under attack now.</p>
<p>So when he takes the knight,</p>
<p>the rook on b1 is attacking my queen.</p>
<p>Got it, so they just got it?</p>
<p>Now, yeah.</p>
<p>You throw your queen into the middle, check the king.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one pawn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a queen for a pawn.</p>
<p>For a pawn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the king takes your queen.</p>
<p>What was the thinking here?</p>
<p>You crazy madman.</p>
<p>King has to go up the board,</p>
<p>and the king is very vulnerable.</p>
<p>In this position, see,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to keep checking here then.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bishop checks, king, rook checks, knight checks.</p>
<p>Did you see all of this ahead of time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, not all of it,</p>
<p>but I figured there had to be some way</p>
<p>to win here with the king.</p>
<p>Too many attacking pieces on your end that could duel.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just basically the king,</p>
<p>the only piece that can sort of guard the king</p>
<p>is the queen on d1.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only piece.</p>
<p>If I can just keep checking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be able to win here.</p>
<p>So it goes there, and now I think I played,</p>
<p>yeah, I played this move.</p>
<p>Ooh, no check.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m threatening to move the rook over one square</p>
<p>and make a checkmate.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And then the rook, what was that?</p>
<p>The rook takes your knight,</p>
<p>and then you take it right back with a check.</p>
<p>Now I still want to scoot the rook over</p>
<p>to check on the h6 square, the dark square.</p>
<p>I think, did he resign here or did he make a move?</p>
<p>Oh, he resigned, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he did resign here.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I just moved the rook over</p>
<p>to that dark square in front of the pawn,</p>
<p>and that would be checkmate.</p>
<p>Dark square in front of the pawn over here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s h6, yeah.</p>
<p>Because now the bishop covers the light square.</p>
<p>Is there something he can do to mess with it?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way to stop a checkmate.</p>
<p>Nothing with the queen.</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;s gonna lose the queen.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s just actually a forced checkmate</p>
<p>here on a couple of moves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way to stop it.</p>
<p>Even if he loses his queens.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a forced checkmate.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And so like that, you can&rsquo;t purely calculate,</p>
<p>but you can have some intuition.</p>
<p>Also, I think what it is is in such situations,</p>
<p>you know that there is at least a draw.</p>
<p>I could always just check him with my rook</p>
<p>if I wanted to, to make a draw.</p>
<p>So that also gives me some margin where if I calculate,</p>
<p>after I play the move and I calculate,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work out, I can still make the draw.</p>
<p>Are you, I mean, for fun,</p>
<p>do you do the sacrifices of this sort?</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s not the serious competitive online events</p>
<p>or over the board?</p>
<p>I do actually do this quite frequently</p>
<p>and I wish there were more opportunities,</p>
<p>but top level chess, it&rsquo;s become harder and harder</p>
<p>because due to computers,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s very, very well prepared in the opening.</p>
<p>They know the first like 15 to 20 move sequences</p>
<p>in no matter what you do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, the room for creativity is less and less,</p>
<p>which makes it, which means you have less,</p>
<p>less of those types of games.</p>
<p>I think you played Levy Gotham Chess without a queen.</p>
<p>Without a queen?</p>
<p>Was that a thing?</p>
<p>I think that was a bullet game.</p>
<p>Yeah, the one minute game.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>Is that an actual thing that you can pull off?</p>
<p>Like would you be like Levy or?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I&rsquo;ll be like Levy.</p>
<p>In bullet, maybe I can win like 50%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably be 50%.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s bullet?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the timing?</p>
<p>One minute for the whole game.</p>
<p>One minute for the whole game.</p>
<p>Okay, what about, I mean, how much do you miss the queen</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gone against the international master?</p>
<p>You know, in a bullet game, like I said,</p>
<p>maybe in bullet, I can maybe score 50%</p>
<p>in a blitz game or anything slower, maybe 10%.</p>
<p>Maybe one out of 10, I can win maybe.</p>
<p>One out of 10.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the topic of Goat, let me ask about Paul Morphy.</p>
<p>How good was he?</p>
<p>Reddit asked me to ask you about this</p>
<p>and why is he a tragic figure in chess?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Paul Morphy was the best player in the world</p>
<p>by a bigger margin probably than anyone else</p>
<p>in recent modern history.</p>
<p>He was, I would say roughly, using today&rsquo;s rating,</p>
<p>he was around like 2,400 in my opinion.</p>
<p>And the other best players were maybe around 2000</p>
<p>or 2,100 at best.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the best player by a bigger margin.</p>
<p>Fisher, for example, I think he was about 170-ish points</p>
<p>better than Boris Spassky,</p>
<p>but Morphy was 300 plus at least.</p>
<p>Now by modern standards,</p>
<p>he would probably be a very strong IM,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t saying a whole lot,</p>
<p>but at the time no one was even close.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think you can put him in that category</p>
<p>of like best ever simply</p>
<p>because he was not the best player</p>
<p>for a long enough period of time.</p>
<p>As far as why it&rsquo;s tragic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very tragic because he essentially quit chess.</p>
<p>There was no competition for him.</p>
<p>If you think about like Magnus</p>
<p>talking about the world championship</p>
<p>and feeling like it&rsquo;s not competitive enough,</p>
<p>for Morphy there was no one who could even beat him</p>
<p>probably in individual games.</p>
<p>So he ended up quitting chess.</p>
<p>I think he was sort of like a lawyer kind of,</p>
<p>but he spent probably the last 15,</p>
<p>I think last 15, 20 years of his life just doing nothing.</p>
<p>Now I have actually seen his grave in New Orleans.</p>
<p>I have been to where he lived.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s now Brennan&rsquo;s if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very tragic that there was no one</p>
<p>who was competitive with him at the time.</p>
<p>As far as best ever,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can say he&rsquo;s the GOAT,</p>
<p>but I still think he&rsquo;s in the top 10</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re using a criteria of players</p>
<p>who are better than their peers by a big, big margin.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the world championship</p>
<p>and what do you think about Magnus stepping down?</p>
<p>Do you still see it as the height of chess?</p>
<p>I still think that there is merit</p>
<p>in having the world championship the way it is.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game is always evolving.</p>
<p>And one of the things that has changed a lot in recent times</p>
<p>is you now have a lot more blitz tournaments</p>
<p>and also rapid tournaments.</p>
<p>In the past, classical chess was the golden standard.</p>
<p>That was the only thing that mattered.</p>
<p>But in the last probably 10 years,</p>
<p>slowly but surely there probably are as many rapid</p>
<p>slash blitz tournaments as there are</p>
<p>classical tournaments now.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not quite 50-50,</p>
<p>but at the top level at least,</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s getting very close to 50-50.</p>
<p>And in terms of the world championship,</p>
<p>I feel that the biggest issue is you have too many draws.</p>
<p>The games can be exciting,</p>
<p>but the games inevitably end in a draw.</p>
<p>And the single biggest reason is because players have</p>
<p>about six months or more to prepare for the match.</p>
<p>So for example, the Canada&rsquo;s tournament,</p>
<p>which I just played, it was in June and July.</p>
<p>It ended, I think, around July 5th.</p>
<p>The world championship match will probably be</p>
<p>in February of March.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know, nine months.</p>
<p>And when players have that much time to prepare,</p>
<p>they are not going to have any weaknesses</p>
<p>in the opening phase of the game.</p>
<p>And so both players are likely going to be very solid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a lot of draws.</p>
<p>And in many cases, it might come down to tie breaks.</p>
<p>Magnus, in fact, in two of the matches,</p>
<p>both against Karjakin and against Karuana,</p>
<p>he had to win in rapid tie breaks.</p>
<p>So I think for Magnus,</p>
<p>he just doesn&rsquo;t feel like the format is right.</p>
<p>I think he feels that there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too long, too many draws.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t get to play creative or exciting chess.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think he pushed so hard</p>
<p>for a change in the format.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right change would be,</p>
<p>but I do think that the format</p>
<p>is becoming a little bit antiquated</p>
<p>with all these classical games.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to change the format,</p>
<p>the one suggestion that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>and I think is probably still valid,</p>
<p>is that the match should be held</p>
<p>maybe one month after the Canada&rsquo;s tournament</p>
<p>to determine the challenger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s held one month after that event.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the only way to keep the format as it is,</p>
<p>where I think both players have time to prepare,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not something crazy.</p>
<p>Because when you compare the candidates</p>
<p>to other classical tournaments,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say, let&rsquo;s just say St. Louis.</p>
<p>I played there recently.</p>
<p>There was the, I played the Rapideon Blitz,</p>
<p>but there was the Sinkfield Cup.</p>
<p>This was, I think, like September 10th,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Point is, players probably came in</p>
<p>and had a week or two to prepare for that tournament.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s the US Championship.</p>
<p>Players have a little bit of time to prepare.</p>
<p>You play the event.</p>
<p>Normally, players don&rsquo;t have these long breaks</p>
<p>where they can prepare for very long periods of time.</p>
<p>So they are very well prepared,</p>
<p>but you still have a lot of exciting games</p>
<p>because that window of preparation is so much smaller.</p>
<p>But you had, you&rsquo;re pretty close,</p>
<p>given how things rolled out,</p>
<p>to having the opportunity to compete</p>
<p>for the World Championship.</p>
<p>Hence the Copia meme,</p>
<p>which I still don&rsquo;t quite understand.</p>
<p>Are you and Magnus friends, enemies, frenemies?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the status of the relationship?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think with all the rivalries in chess,</p>
<p>everybody tries to hype it up</p>
<p>like everyone hates each other.</p>
<p>But the thing is, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>yes, we&rsquo;re very competitive.</p>
<p>We want to beat each other,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s myself or Magnus or other top players.</p>
<p>But we also realize that it&rsquo;s a very small world.</p>
<p>Like a lot of us are able to make a living</p>
<p>playing the game as professionals.</p>
<p>And as I alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>the top 20 to 30 players can make a living.</p>
<p>So even though we&rsquo;re competitive against each other,</p>
<p>we want to beat each other.</p>
<p>There is a certain level of respect that we have,</p>
<p>and there is a sort of brotherhood, I would say.</p>
<p>So all of us are, I would say, frenemies.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the simplest way of putting it.</p>
<p>What do you love most about Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>as a human being?</p>
<p>As a human being?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very similar, actually,</p>
<p>to use a comparison to tennis and Roger Federer,</p>
<p>in that it feels like with Magnus,</p>
<p>everything comes very easily.</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve seen the situation with Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>Somehow it&rsquo;s rolled right off his back,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s playing amazing chess in his latest event.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really how easy he seems to make it look.</p>
<p>And I know, because tennis is a sport that I&rsquo;ve played a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed it very closely.</p>
<p>I remember hearing Andy Roddick say this about Federer,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, somehow he handles it all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pressure, he makes it look easy,</p>
<p>and how does he do all of that?</p>
<p>And I feel the same way about Magnus,</p>
<p>where it seems too easy.</p>
<p>Because I know for myself, when I&rsquo;m playing these games,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stress, the pressure.</p>
<p>And for Magnus, you don&rsquo;t ever see that.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s probably there, but we don&rsquo;t witness it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I would say, is just how easy it is.</p>
<p>It was sad to see Federer retire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Just greatness.</p>
<p>You know, when Lionel Messi will retire, it&rsquo;ll also be sad.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s certain people that are just singular</p>
<p>in the history of a sport.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s gonna be another Messi.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s gonna be another Federer.</p>
<p>Yeah, not for a long time, probably.</p>
<p>Is he greatest ever, would you say?</p>
<p>Is he up there?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely up there.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up as more of an Nadal fan,</p>
<p>just because actually, I felt like Nadal,</p>
<p>it never looked easy.</p>
<p>It was the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Like for Nadal, it feels like he&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s running after every ball, he&rsquo;s exerting himself.</p>
<p>It looked really, really hard.</p>
<p>And for me, since nothing really came easily</p>
<p>for me in chess, I can relate to that more.</p>
<p>But at the same time, especially when Federer</p>
<p>started losing more and he seems more human,</p>
<p>I started really liking him more as well.</p>
<p>But I think Federer, he changed the game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s the greatest ever,</p>
<p>but the game changed forever because of him.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s certain people,</p>
<p>just a lasting impact, Sampras, Agassi, everybody.</p>
<p>Okay, who wins in a chess boxing match</p>
<p>between you and Magnus?</p>
<p>Probably Magnus, just because he&rsquo;s taller than me,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Oh, so reach?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taller, he has more reach, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think he would win.</p>
<p>Question from Reddit, in what sport do you think</p>
<p>you can beat Magnus 10 out of 10 times?</p>
<p>I think I could beat Magnus 10 out of 10 times in tennis.</p>
<p>I mean, I took lessons for eight years.</p>
<p>I try to go out and hit two or three times every week.</p>
<p>I think I could beat him in tennis, 10 out of 10.</p>
<p>Backhand, forehand, what&rsquo;s your style of tennis play?</p>
<p>I wish I was taller,</p>
<p>because I really like trying to come into the net.</p>
<p>I like volleying a lot.</p>
<p>But I am no Rob Laver.</p>
<p>Rob Laver was very short, but he was able to make it work</p>
<p>like 50, 60 years ago.</p>
<p>I really like volleying, but I&rsquo;m a little bit too short.</p>
<p>So I kind of have to stay back.</p>
<p>And I mean, I normally hit, I try to hit hard forehands,</p>
<p>and I try to slice or two-hand backhand.</p>
<p>You mentioned Magnus and Kariakin.</p>
<p>And I just wonder if you have ideas or thoughts</p>
<p>about the fact that he was originally a qualifier</p>
<p>for the Candidates Tournament and was disqualified</p>
<p>by FIDE for breaching his code of ethics</p>
<p>related to his support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh, does that ever seep into the games</p>
<p>that you play over the board, the geopolitics,</p>
<p>the actual military conflict of it all?</p>
<p>Do you feel the pressure of that?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s battles between nations.</p>
<p>Nepal is Russian, there&rsquo;s America, there&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>every nation is in some profound way</p>
<p>represented on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Right, I&rsquo;ve never really felt that.</p>
<p>I think actually for me, it&rsquo;s very eye-opening</p>
<p>to realize how difficult it is</p>
<p>for a lot of the Russian chess players right now</p>
<p>to play because of the situation,</p>
<p>even Nepo for that matter.</p>
<p>I remember when we were in St. Louis,</p>
<p>he essentially has to bring cash</p>
<p>because obviously Russia&rsquo;s cut off from SWIFT,</p>
<p>no credit cards work.</p>
<p>So if these Russians don&rsquo;t have cash, they can&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of them have fled the country</p>
<p>just to try and keep their chess career going.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very, very, very tough situation for them,</p>
<p>obviously for the Ukrainians who are suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really bad.</p>
<p>Do you know if Nepo, has he talked,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen, has he talked about the politics,</p>
<p>the geopolitics of it all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he really has.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like most players</p>
<p>try to avoid talking about it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in St. Louis,</p>
<p>there was another Russian player, Peter Savidler,</p>
<p>and I basically asked him, he was like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me started because I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>So I think most of them are probably</p>
<p>on the other side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re probably supportive</p>
<p>of what is going on right now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very, very, very difficult situation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t really feel like that manifests itself</p>
<p>in actual tensions when I play against the Russian players.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe when I was younger playing certain events,</p>
<p>the one country that I felt like maybe it actually,</p>
<p>I felt some tension, I really wanted to go out of my way</p>
<p>to win against was against the Chinese, perhaps.</p>
<p>That is maybe the one time I felt something</p>
<p>along those lines.</p>
<p>But generally, I feel like we treat the players</p>
<p>as individuals, it&rsquo;s not about the country they represent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the philosophical of chess.</p>
<p>What do you find most beautiful about the game of chess?</p>
<p>Looking back over your whole career.</p>
<p>I think looking back, it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both over the board and also just like the memories</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>I think for me, the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to travel</p>
<p>because of chess to meet so many people</p>
<p>who are playing this great game</p>
<p>from all different nationalities,</p>
<p>all different backgrounds is probably the thing</p>
<p>that I really like the most.</p>
<p>Chess is one of the, maybe the only thing I can think</p>
<p>of where you can have people, different backgrounds,</p>
<p>different ages.</p>
<p>Honestly, you can have someone who&rsquo;s a billionaire</p>
<p>talking to someone who&rsquo;s like a nine-year-old kid</p>
<p>from the inner city.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re talking about the game of chess,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the same level.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that is really applicable</p>
<p>to anything else in this world.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have that level of respect</p>
<p>that is communicated through a game.</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s probably the single most beautiful thing</p>
<p>about sort of chess and the chess world itself</p>
<p>is that you have that.</p>
<p>In terms of the game itself, the creativity,</p>
<p>the possibility of different positions,</p>
<p>learning something new even after I&rsquo;ve played the game</p>
<p>for 30 years, it&rsquo;s very inspiring to me</p>
<p>knowing that I&rsquo;ve spent all this time,</p>
<p>there still are new things that I can learn.</p>
<p>Those are probably two biggest, biggest things</p>
<p>that I would refer to.</p>
<p>Are there memories, big or small,</p>
<p>like weird, surprising anecdotes from all those years</p>
<p>of going to all the different places that stand out to you?</p>
<p>Some of the darker times, weirder times,</p>
<p>like weird places you&rsquo;ve played, weird people you played,</p>
<p>weird people you hung out with,</p>
<p>anything that jumps to memory?</p>
<p>No, I think this is probably a little bit</p>
<p>more like political,</p>
<p>but I think one of the things that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>is whenever you go and play these tournaments,</p>
<p>you have a certain impression of what a country is like</p>
<p>or what the people are like.</p>
<p>Probably the best example for me was in 2004,</p>
<p>or actually, no, sorry, it was 2003, I think it was.</p>
<p>I played in the FIDE World Cup,</p>
<p>and it was held in Tripoli, the capital of Libya</p>
<p>at the time when Gaddafi was still running the country.</p>
<p>You hear a lot of these things,</p>
<p>but then when you go there</p>
<p>and you see the people are so friendly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very eye-opening.</p>
<p>You look at it without just believing things.</p>
<p>You go to these places, you see how things truly are,</p>
<p>and generally, I find that it&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>than how the media will portray it.</p>
<p>One of my great regrets is, as someone who loves history,</p>
<p>not going to see Magnus Lepto,</p>
<p>which were the greatest ruins,</p>
<p>I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times,</p>
<p>and of course, no longer exists,</p>
<p>so I really do regret that.</p>
<p>I think another thing that&rsquo;s very unique about chess</p>
<p>is that all of us, even when we compete as children,</p>
<p>there are a lot of people like Nepo and others</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve known for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people</p>
<p>who no longer play chess competitively,</p>
<p>but inevitably, you end up talking to these people</p>
<p>many years down the road,</p>
<p>and so you never truly lose touch with the game</p>
<p>or the people that you grew up playing it with,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many of these people</p>
<p>that I connected with in the last couple of years</p>
<p>who I knew when I was a kid,</p>
<p>and then they went off, did something else,</p>
<p>but you still end up talking to them</p>
<p>and being able to share these old memories.</p>
<p>So you said you&rsquo;re a bit of a student,</p>
<p>a fan of history, even ancient history.</p>
<p>Are there cultures, periods of time,</p>
<p>people from human history that you draw wisdom from</p>
<p>about human nature that you&rsquo;re particularly drawn to?</p>
<p>A lot, I mean, I probably study,</p>
<p>mostly it would be ancient Roman history</p>
<p>or pre-Roman empire, and of course, ancient Persia</p>
<p>is another subject that I&rsquo;ve studied a lot on.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I would say, I mean,</p>
<p>it depends, you&rsquo;re talking military generals,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking philosophers, I mean, there&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>So yeah, so both, right?</p>
<p>So philosophers is how people thought about the world.</p>
<p>Of course, military has to do with</p>
<p>how people sort of conquered lands.</p>
<p>Both are interesting because, in part,</p>
<p>it seems so far away from what we are today,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool to see that people were kind of the same</p>
<p>in their ability to invent amazing things,</p>
<p>and maybe the same and different</p>
<p>in their willingness to go to war.</p>
<p>So I think, I mean, one of my favorite books</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve read in the last couple of years</p>
<p>is The Histories by Herodotus.</p>
<p>I mean, basically considered the father of history.</p>
<p>And I mean, I really love reading about these things</p>
<p>like Thermopylae or Marathon, these great ancient battles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s like a specific quote</p>
<p>or wording or something like that that I can come up with,</p>
<p>but that is one of my favorite,</p>
<p>favorite books on history by far.</p>
<p>So those books were written a long time ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like 400, I think it was like 400 BC</p>
<p>was when that was written.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like reading that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>Does it seem ancient?</p>
<p>It does seem ancient.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s sort of, I feel like for myself,</p>
<p>one of the things I really like doing</p>
<p>is getting away from technology</p>
<p>when I have the opportunity,</p>
<p>trying to disconnect these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And so when I read books like that,</p>
<p>besides just having a general interest,</p>
<p>it sort of reminds me, like, there is really a life</p>
<p>without all this stuff, or there was at least at some point.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s something that I can kind of relate to.</p>
<p>Like, humanity flourishes without all the stuff we take,</p>
<p>we think is fundamental to our current culture.</p>
<p>Like, all that we find beautiful about humanity</p>
<p>can still exist without any of the technology.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good reminder,</p>
<p>given the contrast, of course, is beautiful,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in the midst of the technology with streaming.</p>
<p>Like, to me, streaming somehow feels,</p>
<p>because of how many,</p>
<p>how large of a percentage of young people</p>
<p>are interested, like, consumes streams,</p>
<p>it feels to represent, like, the future.</p>
<p>Because so many people kind of develop their mind</p>
<p>by watching Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, that&rsquo;s definitely true.</p>
<p>For, like, for myself,</p>
<p>I remember when I was a little bit younger,</p>
<p>I was like 17, 18 around then,</p>
<p>I would actually try one day a week on the weekend</p>
<p>to try not to look at, like, my computer or my phone.</p>
<p>Now, phones weren&rsquo;t where they are today, obviously,</p>
<p>but I was able to do that pretty easily.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Like, when I try to go one day,</p>
<p>recently I tried to do that,</p>
<p>like, I actually just pulled some books out of my garage</p>
<p>and I started reading,</p>
<p>and it was a very foreign concept.</p>
<p>So, I do read a lot, but it&rsquo;s always on an iPad, so.</p>
<p>Or a Kindle, yeah, both of those, actually.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s very, very weird.</p>
<p>But I do try, when I can, to get away from it all.</p>
<p>I mean, another thing, like I said,</p>
<p>I really like going out into nature</p>
<p>when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in Colorado, for example,</p>
<p>hiking some of the 14ers,</p>
<p>that is one of those life goals that I have,</p>
<p>to go and get to the top of every single one of them.</p>
<p>So, I try to disconnect when I can,</p>
<p>but of course, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>So, whether it&rsquo;s disconnecting or not,</p>
<p>can you take me through a perfect day</p>
<p>in the life of Fikar and Nakamura</p>
<p>on a day of a big chess match?</p>
<p>Well, actually, multiple days, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take one where it&rsquo;s a big chess match</p>
<p>and one that&rsquo;s just like your representative average day.</p>
<p>A perfect chess day, although I cannot do this,</p>
<p>it would start like the night before.</p>
<p>I would get like nine hours of sleep,</p>
<p>like a consistent nine hours,</p>
<p>like say 12 a.m. to 9 a.m., for example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say the round starts at like two o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>and then nine to, say, 12 o&rsquo;clock, I do preparation,</p>
<p>and then 12 to one, I go eat lunch,</p>
<p>and at one to two, I just nap, or I walk,</p>
<p>or I do something completely unrelated to it.</p>
<p>That would be the perfect day.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing everything except the preparation,</p>
<p>are you thinking about chess at all,</p>
<p>or are you trying not to think about chess?</p>
<p>Trying not to think about chess, definitely not.</p>
<p>And what do you do?</p>
<p>Is there any tricks to that?</p>
<p>Well, I find that if I go outside,</p>
<p>I just try to hear the birds, or I try to listen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those meditation kind of things.</p>
<p>They always say when you meditate,</p>
<p>you try to hear yourself breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you close your eyes,</p>
<p>try to hear yourself breathing, just focus on that.</p>
<p>So I do try to do things like that</p>
<p>from time to time as well.</p>
<p>So in terms of getting nine hours of sleep,</p>
<p>does that come difficult to you?</p>
<p>That almost never happens.</p>
<p>I mean, there have been a couple times</p>
<p>where it has happened, like in Norway specifically,</p>
<p>but generally, it just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sleep well during chess tournaments.</p>
<p>I wish I did, but.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about a perfect day.</p>
<p>So sleep is really important.</p>
<p>What about diet and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>they try to keep it light before the round.</p>
<p>Actually, I remember hearing this story</p>
<p>from Peter Savidler some years back, a Russian GM,</p>
<p>and he said that Kasparov would go and eat</p>
<p>like a big steak right before the game</p>
<p>and he would be completely fine.</p>
<p>But I think for most players, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>You try to eat some snacks, maybe some nuts,</p>
<p>a few bars, things of this nature,</p>
<p>or maybe just maybe fish,</p>
<p>something very light for lunch before the game,</p>
<p>and then you probably eat a lot after the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally what you try to do.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any specific diet</p>
<p>that makes a huge difference,</p>
<p>but everyone is different, of course.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re actually at the board</p>
<p>on that perfect day, how do you maintain focus</p>
<p>for so many hours of classical chess?</p>
<p>Like, you know what, like minute to minute,</p>
<p>second to second, how are you able to maintain focus?</p>
<p>Is there tricks to that?</p>
<p>How difficult is that?</p>
<p>I think it really depends on the type of the game</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s a game that&rsquo;s very, very calm</p>
<p>and very slow where not a lot happens at the start,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier because you&rsquo;re not having</p>
<p>to be super focused.</p>
<p>Like, your mind can drift and whatnot,</p>
<p>and then at the critical moment,</p>
<p>you have to sort of zone in.</p>
<p>So those are the easiest ones.</p>
<p>I think generally when games are very complicated</p>
<p>from the start, what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to not let your mind wander at all.</p>
<p>Because when games are complicated like that,</p>
<p>one of the things that I&rsquo;ve never been very good at</p>
<p>is my mind does wander, and you&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m always worrying about the next move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, is this a blunder?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>What am I going to do?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying, I think, very much to block out the noise.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually the hardest thing,</p>
<p>is also because I can say this,</p>
<p>when I played Magnus before,</p>
<p>there have been times when I&rsquo;ve gotten winning positions</p>
<p>against him, and in that moment</p>
<p>when I had the winning position,</p>
<p>very oftentimes my mind wanders.</p>
<p>Like, okay, you&rsquo;re about to win this game,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, okay, what happens after the game?</p>
<p>You win this game, gain the rating points,</p>
<p>all these different things,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t actually won the game yet.</p>
<p>And I think for a lot of players,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hardest thing is when you get</p>
<p>a winning position, your mind does drift.</p>
<p>It drifts to what happens after you&rsquo;ve won the game,</p>
<p>or what the outcome is.</p>
<p>So drifting into the future,</p>
<p>and you should stay in the moment.</p>
<p>You really should hold on.</p>
<p>And also, what is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably getting excited about the win.</p>
<p>What is it about that that makes you worse at playing?</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Like, getting-</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s nervous,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re too excited, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re waiting for it to end.</p>
<p>You expect it to end.</p>
<p>And then your opponent keeps defending,</p>
<p>and you can make mistakes.</p>
<p>What about the flip side of that,</p>
<p>where you start getting frustrated?</p>
<p>Like, how do you try to recover from that kind of thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>I think for myself, I just try.</p>
<p>I try to basically focus on it every single move.</p>
<p>I just try, again, you try to block out the noise,</p>
<p>no matter which direction it&rsquo;s going in.</p>
<p>So I try as best I can.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I&rsquo;m very poor at it.</p>
<p>Like, I just don&rsquo;t do a good job</p>
<p>blocking out the noise at all.</p>
<p>But I think generally I try to think,</p>
<p>okay, just make this next move.</p>
<p>Make your opponent have to find the best moves.</p>
<p>And just keep the game going no matter what.</p>
<p>Just keep it going.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s a long day of classical chess?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty brutal.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be something like,</p>
<p>okay, so the game starts at two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done all this other stuff.</p>
<p>The game probably goes from like two to seven, for example,</p>
<p>or maybe two to eight, five, six hours.</p>
<p>Probably you eat dinner for an hour or so.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll go clear my head for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And then immediately it&rsquo;s right back to studying</p>
<p>for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Are you reviewing previous games or are you already?</p>
<p>Generally, you&rsquo;re just moving on to the next game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And trying to, no matter what happened,</p>
<p>put that behind you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Win or lose or draw.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why there&rsquo;s another question</p>
<p>a lot of people wonder,</p>
<p>which is why don&rsquo;t I play more of these classical tournaments?</p>
<p>And sort of, it gets back to the, you know,</p>
<p>the literally don&rsquo;t care sort of stuff.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m going to play in tournaments,</p>
<p>I want to be able to give it my best shot.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t feel that I can, I&rsquo;m not going to play.</p>
<p>Which is why, like, I play here and there,</p>
<p>but I do balance my schedule very carefully</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not just going to go and play a tournament</p>
<p>simply because.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t feel that I can put in the work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Also because I&rsquo;m taking away a spot from somebody else</p>
<p>who probably will be putting in the work,</p>
<p>who will want to compete in that event.</p>
<p>And so when I look at the candidates,</p>
<p>or a lot of people say, well, why is he playing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, qualified,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not going to take it seriously.</p>
<p>But I did give it everything I had in that tournament.</p>
<p>And I always will as much as I can.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t do that, then I&rsquo;m just not going to play.</p>
<p>So what about a perfect day in the life of a car</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not doing it?</p>
<p>Oh, a perfect day.</p>
<p>A perfect day would be something along the lines of,</p>
<p>I get up very early, like three, four o&rsquo;clock in the morning,</p>
<p>drive an hour away and go climb mountains.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the perfect day.</p>
<p>Out of the mountains.</p>
<p>Oh, do you mean a normal non?</p>
<p>Yeah, a perfectly productive normal day.</p>
<p>Oh, perfectly productive.</p>
<p>Okay, so perfectly productive would be along the lines</p>
<p>of I wake up at like 7.30, eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Probably I watch either Bloomberg or CNBC</p>
<p>for 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>And then watch the markets for maybe an hour or two,</p>
<p>look at certain things that are going on.</p>
<p>Do you really care about investing?</p>
<p>I do follow it quite closely, yeah.</p>
<p>I follow the markets very closely,</p>
<p>closer than I should, but yes.</p>
<p>For personal reasons, do you comment on it?</p>
<p>Like for personal investing reasons</p>
<p>or for like philosophical understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of everything.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, obviously I&rsquo;m interested in investing.</p>
<p>I have been for many, many years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done investing trading for at least a decade now.</p>
<p>So like I am very interested on that level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also quite interested as well,</p>
<p>because when you see the policy that&rsquo;s being dictated,</p>
<p>like you look in the last six months specifically,</p>
<p>you see the Fed policy around things like interest rates,</p>
<p>unemployment, things of this nature.</p>
<p>It is something that interests me also,</p>
<p>because I do invest in real estate</p>
<p>aside from the stock market.</p>
<p>So therefore I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye</p>
<p>on these sorts of things and always looking.</p>
<p>And as a better example, like I&rsquo;m looking for trends.</p>
<p>So if we go back to, I think it was 20,</p>
<p>I could have the year wrong.</p>
<p>It was 2015 or 2016.</p>
<p>There was a pattern that I found that on the Fed minutes</p>
<p>that came out, you know, I believe two to 15,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on the Wednesday of every,</p>
<p>third Wednesday of every month,</p>
<p>that gold would actually, the gold ETFs and ETNs</p>
<p>would actually go up every single Wednesday of the month</p>
<p>that the minutes came out.</p>
<p>So I would follow things like that.</p>
<p>Now, of course I wasn&rsquo;t like trading huge volume,</p>
<p>but I found a trend there.</p>
<p>Of course it stopped working at a certain point,</p>
<p>but those are the sorts of things that,</p>
<p>they just interest me.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m doing to make a living,</p>
<p>trying to spot those trends,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always been something that has fascinated me.</p>
<p>One Reddit said that you shorted Tesla some time ago.</p>
<p>Do you regret doing so?</p>
<p>Well, when I did those plays,</p>
<p>that was only those small amounts of money.</p>
<p>And that was only via puts.</p>
<p>That was where I would buy puts or put spreads on it.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t something where I straight shorting.</p>
<p>I would never actually do that because it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not worth the risk.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to ever be in a situation</p>
<p>where I have to think about those sorts of things.</p>
<p>And I think a better example is,</p>
<p>there was a period in 2016 actually,</p>
<p>shortly before the candidates,</p>
<p>when I actually was in oil.</p>
<p>I had a long position in oil.</p>
<p>And this is when oil completely crashed.</p>
<p>It went very, I don&rsquo;t think it went below,</p>
<p>did it go below 30 even?</p>
<p>It went very low.</p>
<p>And of course the Saudis were not cutting,</p>
<p>they were not, I think they were,</p>
<p>were they cutting or not cutting production?</p>
<p>But anyway, there was a period in 2016</p>
<p>where I had a big long position in one of the 3X oil ETFs.</p>
<p>And it kept going down day after day after day.</p>
<p>And then of course, right near the bottom,</p>
<p>I finally couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>I took a loss.</p>
<p>And that really sort of,</p>
<p>it was very difficult dealing with that,</p>
<p>the stress, everyday looking, seeing those losses.</p>
<p>And after that, I kind of decided</p>
<p>I would never put myself in such a situation again.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t do shorting.</p>
<p>And then separately, I think I posted a reply</p>
<p>to this comment, but in 2021, as Tesla started going up,</p>
<p>I actually started selling puts.</p>
<p>And I did quite well off of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of play both sides,</p>
<p>never become hard set with your conviction.</p>
<p>Like where you refuse, like this is just like,</p>
<p>it has to go down or like it has to go up.</p>
<p>Just you have to be willing to adapt.</p>
<p>Do you think shorting should be legal?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s ethical?</p>
<p>Like to me, I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know much about investing,</p>
<p>but I feel like it feels wrong.</p>
<p>Now I know if something is overinflated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for there to be an opposing force</p>
<p>to like balance it or something like that.</p>
<p>But it just feels like</p>
<p>in our current modern internet world,</p>
<p>I think Tesla, I vaguely saw somewhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the most shorted stock like ever.</p>
<p>And so that incentivizes a lot of the publication</p>
<p>of misinformation about it.</p>
<p>It just feels like the incentives are wrong,</p>
<p>not when we look at the markets,</p>
<p>but at the future of human civilization perspective.</p>
<p>It just feels like shorting is somehow wrong,</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;m misunderstanding</p>
<p>the broader picture of markets.</p>
<p>Well, I actually try not to do that.</p>
<p>Like I almost only take long positions specifically</p>
<p>because I feel like you&rsquo;re betting</p>
<p>like on the world collapsing.</p>
<p>I just, I feel like morally, I don&rsquo;t want to be in that,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to have that viewpoint.</p>
<p>I think, you know, that sort of is another thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been very lucky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of famous people.</p>
<p>And the one thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed is like</p>
<p>a lot of the people who are the most successful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who are very optimistic.</p>
<p>No matter what is happening day to day,</p>
<p>they remain very optimistic</p>
<p>about the future of where things are going.</p>
<p>So I try not to end up in that situation.</p>
<p>I think as far as like shorting specifically,</p>
<p>the real danger to me is that anybody can now invest.</p>
<p>And I feel like actually some of these apps like Robinhood,</p>
<p>they go out of their way to try and make it seem</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s this fun game.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen people where you place a trade</p>
<p>and it like, it gives you like these stickers</p>
<p>or these pop-ups like of confetti.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, wait a second, what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>with the whole game?</p>
<p>Like people are sort of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going after the wrong thing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think shorting like will be banned,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous that everybody has access</p>
<p>to being able to do things like that.</p>
<p>So according to Reddit on the topic of Tesla,</p>
<p>you have trouble admitting when you make a mistake.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s generally not true.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that-</p>
<p>Wait, Reddit is not 100% accurate and truthful</p>
<p>in its representation of a character?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>No, I think the thing that I&rsquo;ve learned is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously very good at chess,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a genius in everything else.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s another thing actually</p>
<p>that I really, really admire about Magnus</p>
<p>is that he is the world champion, he&rsquo;s the best player,</p>
<p>but he does not automatically believe</p>
<p>that that translates to every area of life.</p>
<p>I feel like with some other world champions,</p>
<p>they think that they&rsquo;re great no matter what they do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not like intentionally trying to be like rude,</p>
<p>but I do feel like there&rsquo;s certain people who feel like that</p>
<p>like anything they say is right and they are the authority.</p>
<p>When in reality, like we are the authorities</p>
<p>when it comes to chess,</p>
<p>like we know chess the best, we are the experts,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re geniuses in everything else.</p>
<p>That said, I think you said somewhere,</p>
<p>could have been on the C Squared podcast,</p>
<p>that I forget if it&rsquo;s chess or streaming</p>
<p>that taught you to generalize to various,</p>
<p>like you feel like you&rsquo;re able to do other things now.</p>
<p>Was that streaming?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s specifically streaming,</p>
<p>but I think streaming has taught me a lot</p>
<p>about sort of life and also how to run a business honestly.</p>
<p>Like I have read a lot of business books</p>
<p>and one of the things with streaming</p>
<p>is that when you start out, it&rsquo;s like this very small thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you, maybe you have a couple of people</p>
<p>who help you along the way,</p>
<p>but as it becomes bigger and bigger, if there&rsquo;s a boom,</p>
<p>you suddenly start having to hire employees,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically running this business.</p>
<p>And like for me, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about that</p>
<p>because there was this book that I read some years back,</p>
<p>I think it was by Mary Buffett, it was on Warren Buffett</p>
<p>and how like he tries to be hands-off,</p>
<p>like when he buys these companies, it&rsquo;s hands-off,</p>
<p>management stays the same, you don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>I actually, I try to do things kind of the same way</p>
<p>where like I try to be hands-off,</p>
<p>there are a couple of people around me,</p>
<p>I leave a lot of the general day-to-day decisions</p>
<p>up to them and then like things that are really important,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;m involved in, but I try to do things like that.</p>
<p>So streaming is, you learn a lot along the way</p>
<p>and I think now having done that,</p>
<p>there probably are several other potential careers</p>
<p>that I could have if I really wanted to.</p>
<p>Almost about that generalizing terms</p>
<p>is what it takes to build a business from the ground up.</p>
<p>From the process of becoming a successful streamer,</p>
<p>you have learned what it takes to start from the ground up</p>
<p>with a single person and to build a business</p>
<p>as multiple people and a successful.</p>
<p>What do you attribute your success as a streamer to?</p>
<p>I mean, many things.</p>
<p>I think being a very strong chess player</p>
<p>and having had a following was incredibly important</p>
<p>at the start.</p>
<p>I think anybody, whether it&rsquo;s chess or whatever field,</p>
<p>if you have that following to begin with from your career</p>
<p>or whatever activity or video game you do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already a big step up</p>
<p>if you have that to begin with.</p>
<p>So that definitely played a big role.</p>
<p>I think more than that though, for me, it&rsquo;s about the fans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about hearing from people how they feel.</p>
<p>I mean, there are trolls obviously,</p>
<p>but the positive messages you hear</p>
<p>when you hear about people who are struggling in life,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s say, I&rsquo;ve heard people talk</p>
<p>about having cancer,</p>
<p>you hear about someone going through a divorce</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just trying to make it through day to day.</p>
<p>When you hear about things like that,</p>
<p>I think it really puts it all into perspective</p>
<p>about what it all means at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And so for me, it really is the fans</p>
<p>that they give me that motivation.</p>
<p>They are the reason I do it.</p>
<p>And when I meet some of these fans in person,</p>
<p>like I have at a couple of events,</p>
<p>like just talking to them, hearing their story,</p>
<p>just knowing that I can bring them some joy is,</p>
<p>again, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s why are you doing it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>If I can bring people joy,</p>
<p>you know, if it&rsquo;s someone working in a factory all day,</p>
<p>if I bring them joy through my chest, that means a lot.</p>
<p>You know, if it&rsquo;s a kid, for example,</p>
<p>if I can inspire them to take up chess in a more serious way</p>
<p>or even honestly, if they just learn from chess,</p>
<p>certain skills like critical thinking,</p>
<p>and that leads to them becoming like a great scientist</p>
<p>or something down the road,</p>
<p>that is what I&rsquo;m ultimately hoping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I hope will come out of it.</p>
<p>I mean, what gave you strength to have to turn on?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much you stream, but it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>So day after day after day,</p>
<p>to be able to put that content out there,</p>
<p>is there some, can you comment on the challenge of that</p>
<p>and maybe the low points,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re able to overcome that?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t feel the lows.</p>
<p>And I think the main reason I don&rsquo;t feel the lows</p>
<p>is because at the end of the day, I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate,</p>
<p>even as a chess player, very, very fortunate,</p>
<p>travel the world, meet people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived a great life.</p>
<p>So for me to see myself as a streamer doing so well</p>
<p>and bringing joy to people,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m in a position,</p>
<p>maybe this is wrong to say this,</p>
<p>because mental health is very important.</p>
<p>But for myself, I feel like I&rsquo;m very lucky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have any right to complain.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really feel those lows in the same way.</p>
<p>There are times when there are certain things like Reddit</p>
<p>or otherwise that will get on my nerves a little bit,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m able to realize that I&rsquo;m so fortunate.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t generally struggle with the lows that much.</p>
<p>Speaking of Reddit and trolls,</p>
<p>Reddit asked me to ask you to tell me the story of Chess Bay,</p>
<p>the Reddit moderator who pitted you against Eric Hansen,</p>
<p>also known as Chess Bro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying things I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about Eric Hansen.</p>
<p>I guess Eric is another grandmaster.</p>
<p>You guys had some drama and tension between each other.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll also ask you to tell me what you like best</p>
<p>about Eric Hansen as a human being.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>The whole streamers and the whole boom of chess,</p>
<p>there are certain people, certain entities</p>
<p>that are very, very important to what happened.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people</p>
<p>in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Myself, Botez, the Chess Bros, Levy as well.</p>
<p>We were all kind of in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>But just having the personalities alone is not enough.</p>
<p>You need people who push things.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of things</p>
<p>that have been said about Chess Bay, about what she did.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>the way that I view it is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to agree with what she did,</p>
<p>the manner in which she did things,</p>
<p>but it pushed the directory</p>
<p>and chess on Twitch forward in a way</p>
<p>that would not have been possible</p>
<p>with anybody else at the time.</p>
<p>Chess.com, for example, they were not directly pushing it.</p>
<p>So you needed someone who was pushing it.</p>
<p>And that, so to me, when I look at the whole boom,</p>
<p>actually, of what happened on Twitch,</p>
<p>in many ways, I think she&rsquo;s just as responsible as I was,</p>
<p>Levy was, Botez was, and the Bros were.</p>
<p>All of us were extremely fortunate</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t have someone pushing it forward,</p>
<p>and Chess.com was not really that involved at the time,</p>
<p>it never would have gotten to where it was.</p>
<p>So you can sort of look at it and say,</p>
<p>okay, you don&rsquo;t agree with what happened,</p>
<p>but you needed someone like that</p>
<p>who was gonna push, push really hard</p>
<p>to get Chess to where it is today.</p>
<p>Can you comment on what happened</p>
<p>for people who have no clue what you were talking about?</p>
<p>Is that not useful?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s specifically useful to get into it.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of layers.</p>
<p>People felt there were things like abuses of power,</p>
<p>things of that nature.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things that were said.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna be super negative</p>
<p>about what happened specifically,</p>
<p>but one thing people will note</p>
<p>is that prior to what did happen in April of 20,</p>
<p>I think that was 2021 now,</p>
<p>there were a lot more collaborations.</p>
<p>The chess world was much more together as a whole.</p>
<p>A lot of streamers did things together.</p>
<p>After what happened in April,</p>
<p>there was a big sort of separation.</p>
<p>A lot of streamers went off in their own directions</p>
<p>because of what happened.</p>
<p>So that is, I mean, that&rsquo;s not the whole story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to it, of course,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that.</p>
<p>If I can just comment on the few times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tuned into the streaming world,</p>
<p>I do hate to see the silos that were created.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&rsquo;ve been a fan</p>
<p>and now a good friend of Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>you call it collaborations,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically everybody&rsquo;s supporting each other,</p>
<p>gets excited for each other, promotes each other,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not that competitive feeling.</p>
<p>With streamers, sometimes I&rsquo;ve just noticed</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a natural siloing effect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe because drama is somehow good</p>
<p>for views and clicks and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is, but I hate to see it</p>
<p>because I love seeing kind of friendship</p>
<p>and collaboration and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think this also goes, again,</p>
<p>try not to be super negative,</p>
<p>but this also goes to the chess world as a whole.</p>
<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve been in this chess world</p>
<p>for a very long time, not talking about online,</p>
<p>but just the chess world itself,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of booms and busts.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t late 90s, it was in the mid 90s.</p>
<p>There was a period of time when Intel and IBM</p>
<p>and all these tech companies were very big on chess.</p>
<p>There was this PCA Grand Prix World Championship</p>
<p>held in New York.</p>
<p>I think there was the Deep Blue stuff later on</p>
<p>in the late 90s with Garry Kasparov,</p>
<p>and you had a lot of interest at the time,</p>
<p>and then it sort of went up in flames</p>
<p>for a couple different reasons.</p>
<p>Also in the late 2000s or maybe mid 2000s,</p>
<p>there was a group in Seattle that was very big on chess.</p>
<p>They hosted the US Championship, all these different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a lot of booms and busts.</p>
<p>Of course, if you go way back,</p>
<p>there was the Fisher boom as well,</p>
<p>but inevitably what leads to these busts?</p>
<p>And the thing that leads to it is at the end of the day,</p>
<p>people in the chess world have this natural tendency</p>
<p>to want to not work together.</p>
<p>You wanna hang on to whatever piece</p>
<p>of the chess world you have,</p>
<p>as opposed to thinking about it from the standpoint</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s good for one is good for all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that now that I&rsquo;m in this situation,</p>
<p>having seen these booms and busts,</p>
<p>I remember when I was younger,</p>
<p>I would very oftentimes think,</p>
<p>why is it that chess isn&rsquo;t bigger?</p>
<p>Why do we struggle so much to grow the game?</p>
<p>And I think we see the reason.</p>
<p>So now when I&rsquo;m in this position,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very tough,</p>
<p>because I know what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>You try to learn from the past,</p>
<p>but it still feels very hard to break out from that.</p>
<p>It feels very tough.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also difficult,</p>
<p>because another thing that people kind of misunderstand</p>
<p>is from time to time, I&rsquo;ll talk about myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually talk about Levy and incomes</p>
<p>or how well we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And the main reason I talk about this</p>
<p>is that I want it to inspire FIDE,</p>
<p>the governing bodies,</p>
<p>and others feel like, wow,</p>
<p>these people, they&rsquo;re having such success.</p>
<p>Surely we can do something different.</p>
<p>We can change things.</p>
<p>And somehow it has not happened,</p>
<p>which is in a way very, very disheartening to me,</p>
<p>because I wanna see more interest in chess.</p>
<p>So you wanna see more sponsors,</p>
<p>more of the general public getting excited by the game.</p>
<p>So it is one of those things that&rsquo;s very, very difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you wanna see innovation</p>
<p>on the parts of everybody,</p>
<p>but also the organizations like FIDE and chess.com,</p>
<p>how to inspire a large number of people,</p>
<p>which is what streamers are doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly innovating, I guess,</p>
<p>of how to reach a very large audience.</p>
<p>Before we forget, just to put a little love out there.</p>
<p>Oh, you wanted me to ask about Eric?</p>
<p>It was about Eric.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, a little love out there.</p>
<p>What do you like best about Eric Hansen as a human being?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s mainly he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s very charismatic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very charismatic.</p>
<p>He knows the brand that he has,</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t pretend to fake it.</p>
<p>He knows what his brand is, and he owns it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, just for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s a grandmaster.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very strong grandmaster.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a strong grandmaster,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a creator.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the earliest major</p>
<p>chess content creators on Twitch.</p>
<p>Like educational stuff, too?</p>
<p>A mix.</p>
<p>A mix of educational, a mix of high level,</p>
<p>a mix of everything, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>What historical chess figure do you think</p>
<p>would have the best streams?</p>
<p>Historical chess figure.</p>
<p>I would say probably Mikhail Tal.</p>
<p>He was the former world champion.</p>
<p>Now he lived a very, very exciting life,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it that.</p>
<p>He was somebody who drank.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from Latvia.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s called the Magician from Riga.</p>
<p>So he drank a lot, he smoked a lot,</p>
<p>a lot of other stuff as well.</p>
<p>Oh, like sex, drugs, and rock and roll?</p>
<p>Kind of, yeah.</p>
<p>I think if you look at, actually,</p>
<p>not even just top grandmasters,</p>
<p>or not even world champions, but top grandmasters,</p>
<p>he probably had the most interesting life by far, by far.</p>
<p>And even as an example of how much he loved chess</p>
<p>and what a character he was,</p>
<p>I think when he was dying in like 19,</p>
<p>I think it was 1989 or maybe it was 91,</p>
<p>when he was dying, he actually left the hospital</p>
<p>to go play a Blitz tournament in Moscow,</p>
<p>and he actually beat Garry Kasparov</p>
<p>in that Blitz tournament in one of the games.</p>
<p>At what age?</p>
<p>Probably like late 50s, mid 50s, late 50s.</p>
<p>I mean, he drank too much, so he died young.</p>
<p>But yeah, he left the hospital in Moscow</p>
<p>and went to play a Blitz tournament, he beat Kasparov.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, just to push back,</p>
<p>I think we all die too young,</p>
<p>and some of the most impactful people,</p>
<p>like Churchill, did quite a bit of drinking and smoking,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So you can still do brilliant things,</p>
<p>even if you partake in the old whisking, drugs,</p>
<p>and rock and roll and women.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just about streaming though,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this quote that I love,</p>
<p>which is the Steve Jobs quote,</p>
<p>which is you can never connect the dots looking forward,</p>
<p>you can only connect them looking backwards.</p>
<p>And when I look at how I got into streaming,</p>
<p>there were all these things that happened along the way</p>
<p>that were so beneficial.</p>
<p>So first thing would be that when I was young,</p>
<p>I was growing up, I played a lot of Blitz chess</p>
<p>on the Internet Chess Club.</p>
<p>It was one of the predecessors to chess.com.</p>
<p>And there was no cameras or audio or these things,</p>
<p>but one thing that people did was you could commit,</p>
<p>you would write comments about your games</p>
<p>and things of this nature.</p>
<p>And so I was doing something very similar</p>
<p>where instead of talking, I was writing and chatting</p>
<p>during some of the games that I was playing.</p>
<p>So that was something that I was doing</p>
<p>that was very, very beneficial.</p>
<p>Without that, I don&rsquo;t think that I would have been able</p>
<p>to have the success that I&rsquo;ve had streaming.</p>
<p>I think it would have taken much longer to get used to it</p>
<p>and feel comfortable with it,</p>
<p>but I already had that built-in advantage.</p>
<p>Additionally, when I was younger, up until,</p>
<p>I think I was 10 or 11, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly,</p>
<p>I did not actually have a TV.</p>
<p>Well, I had a TV, but I didn&rsquo;t have cable.</p>
<p>So I did not watch TV growing up.</p>
<p>So I listened to the radio a lot.</p>
<p>I listened to a lot of baseball games</p>
<p>in New York Yankees specifically.</p>
<p>And so I think by listening to those games,</p>
<p>like I sort of, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of announcers.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>where you learn from what you see kind of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re growing up, they&rsquo;re examples.</p>
<p>And so I think that was very, very beneficial.</p>
<p>And then a third thing in terms of like having some flares,</p>
<p>when I was growing up and I was homeschooled,</p>
<p>probably about 14, 15, there was this great courses.</p>
<p>I think they still do some of these great courses.</p>
<p>And there was this, I don&rsquo;t remember who the guy was,</p>
<p>but he was a professor.</p>
<p>And so I watched some of these DVDs of his lectures.</p>
<p>And he would always dress up as someone,</p>
<p>it was like middle ages.</p>
<p>So he would dress up and he was sort of like an orator</p>
<p>and he would explain like, you know,</p>
<p>what happened in the 13, 1400s in this sort of style.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also something that obviously</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something that I can consciously like internalize,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s something as well</p>
<p>that from having watched those courses</p>
<p>and seeing that style of oration really helped me a lot</p>
<p>as a streamer too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, all those little experiences contribute to life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely something I think about</p>
<p>is I took a pretty nonlinear path to life.</p>
<p>And I think they somehow get integrated into the picture.</p>
<p>But I do connect to your idea that you being good at chess</p>
<p>was a part, was an important part of your success</p>
<p>is streaming.</p>
<p>I think like, that&rsquo;s really good advice for people</p>
<p>to be good, like in order to be a creator</p>
<p>or a podcast or create videos,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff or stream.</p>
<p>I feel like it enriches you if you pursue</p>
<p>with your whole heart, something else outside of that.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t have to be obviously</p>
<p>at your level of chess,</p>
<p>but just you have to be developed</p>
<p>in a passionate pursuit of something outside of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to know what that passion kind of,</p>
<p>what it is, I think for sure.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re only doing streaming,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something, first of all,</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s going to empty you over time.</p>
<p>For some reason, I&rsquo;ve seen some of the lows</p>
<p>that people hit if they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this other passion pursuit outside of streaming.</p>
<p>But also, it&rsquo;ll just make you a better creator,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>I think, again, with podcasting, this applies,</p>
<p>like with Rogan, I think it&rsquo;s just would not,</p>
<p>the reason his podcast is very good</p>
<p>is because all of his passion is put into being a comedian</p>
<p>and being a fight commentator.</p>
<p>Like, the podcast is a side hobby.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I feel about it, too.</p>
<p>So your main passion is outside of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I think it puts everything in its proper context.</p>
<p>And also, it allows you to mentally escape</p>
<p>into that place that you find deeply fulfilling.</p>
<p>You mentioned, like offline,</p>
<p>you told me that you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>you found it interesting that I said</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m renting this particular place,</p>
<p>and I always rent because of the sense of freedom it gives.</p>
<p>I mean, I tend to actually try to be a minimalist</p>
<p>for the most part when it comes to things like clothes</p>
<p>or owning cars, for example, or watches.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t own a lot of these material things.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really interest me.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, the one thing is,</p>
<p>and this might actually play a role</p>
<p>in a lot of the hiccups why I didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to maybe being closer to world champion,</p>
<p>is that one of the things from the time</p>
<p>that I was very young is I didn&rsquo;t grow up</p>
<p>from a wealthy background.</p>
<p>I had a single mother for the first six years of my life.</p>
<p>She worked as an elementary teacher</p>
<p>to support my brother and myself.</p>
<p>So I saw a lot of these sort of lows in life early on.</p>
<p>Now, even once she remarried,</p>
<p>all the money that my stepfather made was,</p>
<p>not all of it, but a lot of it was directed</p>
<p>towards my mom and I traveling</p>
<p>to tournaments internationally or even in the US.</p>
<p>So seeing some of these struggles,</p>
<p>once I actually made it as a chess player,</p>
<p>and this goes back to investing as well,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s kind of like you want</p>
<p>to be secure at a certain point.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always looked at that,</p>
<p>how do you get to that point at the end of the day?</p>
<p>And again, like I said, with my experiences,</p>
<p>seeing, actually even now, my stepfather,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s 72 years old, still teaches chess all the time,</p>
<p>probably works harder than I do, actually.</p>
<p>And so I see things like that,</p>
<p>and that really interested me,</p>
<p>how do you get from point A to point B?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in large part what led to it.</p>
<p>That being said, obviously, when you start owning things</p>
<p>like properties, houses, or condos and whatnot,</p>
<p>there are headaches that come along</p>
<p>with getting some of these bills in the mail,</p>
<p>or you see HOA about a tenant</p>
<p>not parking their car illegally,</p>
<p>$50 that you have to pay in fees, these sorts of things.</p>
<p>It is kind of a pain, but I try,</p>
<p>I mean, I try to reduce the number of things</p>
<p>that can really bother me in life,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really the only thing that I let,</p>
<p>not let, but it&rsquo;s one of those things,</p>
<p>the only things that kind of ties me down in a way,</p>
<p>and I still feel pretty free, though,</p>
<p>for the most part, despite owning.</p>
<p>But you mentioned security,</p>
<p>so that meaning like security stability,</p>
<p>that kind of thing? Stability, yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing you chase, you value.</p>
<p>When it comes to chess, as I said,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a pro player, you can do very well,</p>
<p>make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m talking pre-tax,</p>
<p>but if you do poorly in one year, that income dries up,</p>
<p>and there is a chance you&rsquo;ll never get back there.</p>
<p>So I feel like for much of my career,</p>
<p>that was always on my mind,</p>
<p>and maybe that held me back to some degree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know those sort of thoughts about things like that</p>
<p>as opposed to purely being focused only on chess,</p>
<p>like worrying about the results,</p>
<p>worrying about the prizes, things like this.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve held me back,</p>
<p>but that was always something that was on my mind.</p>
<p>For me, I really worked hard to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m philosophically, intellectually, spiritually,</p>
<p>in every way, I&rsquo;m okay with having nothing,</p>
<p>as close to nothing as you can get.</p>
<p>And the reason I want that is so that I have the freedom</p>
<p>to not crave stability, or rather have stability,</p>
<p>because my bar for stability is so low.</p>
<p>And that gives me the freedom to take big risks.</p>
<p>And I thought that for me,</p>
<p>I felt like the way I could really help the world</p>
<p>is by optimizing the positive I can do,</p>
<p>and for that, you have to take big risks.</p>
<p>And big risks really does mean</p>
<p>potentially losing everything.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like startups, you mean like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, startups in every aspect,</p>
<p>meaning pivoting career paths completely</p>
<p>when everybody else is telling you not to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, because when I think about streaming,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a startup,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not investing money</p>
<p>where I can lose everything if it&rsquo;s not successful.</p>
<p>But it was also a big risk for me doing that,</p>
<p>because at the time,</p>
<p>I was a professional player doing very well.</p>
<p>When I started in October 2018,</p>
<p>I was still top 10 in the world doing very well.</p>
<p>2019 was actually a very bad year for me.</p>
<p>I started playing much worse.</p>
<p>And towards the end of 2019,</p>
<p>I intended to take a six-month break.</p>
<p>Last time I played was November 2019 in India.</p>
<p>And then I was going to take a break</p>
<p>until the US Championship in April of 2020.</p>
<p>So I did, in a sense, actually take a risk</p>
<p>because I was potentially risking my career</p>
<p>by spending this extra time that I had streaming.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the risk where financially I can lose everything,</p>
<p>but it actually was a bit of a risk</p>
<p>now that I think about it in a sense.</p>
<p>Because if I lose my career as a player,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no guarantee that streaming</p>
<p>is going to be anything substantial.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think it was a risk at the time?</p>
<p>I think at the time, I just&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I thought it was just something fun</p>
<p>to spend my time on.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t somehow&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I figured that after a six-month break,</p>
<p>I would come back and play better chess, kind of.</p>
<p>But as far as streaming,</p>
<p>I never thought of it as being something</p>
<p>that would be a career or something viable.</p>
<p>I just thought it&rsquo;s something fun to do.</p>
<p>Maybe it gives fans some access to me.</p>
<p>It broadens the platform.</p>
<p>More people hear about me.</p>
<p>And that was about it, really.</p>
<p>I did not ever expect it to become what it did.</p>
<p>You said growing up with a single mother</p>
<p>and just giving your whole life to chess at a certain point.</p>
<p>Has there been through that low points,</p>
<p>maybe times when you felt lonely,</p>
<p>isolated, maybe even depressed?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Chess is very difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p>You can have friends,</p>
<p>people you compete against who are friends,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very singular pursuit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you.</p>
<p>And your results dictate everything.</p>
<p>So there have been many moments throughout my life</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve struggled.</p>
<p>I think probably the biggest time when that happened</p>
<p>would have been about 2005 into 2006,</p>
<p>where I stopped playing chess and I went to college.</p>
<p>And that was mainly because I had gotten to a level</p>
<p>where I was top 100 in the world,</p>
<p>but I stagnated for that year, about 2005, 2006.</p>
<p>And so I decided to go to college</p>
<p>primarily because I had stagnated.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was going anywhere.</p>
<p>And then also kind of being on your own,</p>
<p>just having a few friends here or there in the chess world,</p>
<p>you kind of, you wonder what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And especially because I was homeschooled as well,</p>
<p>like that further added to kind of wanting</p>
<p>to be around other people.</p>
<p>It really played a very big role</p>
<p>in my decision to go to college.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, as I realized,</p>
<p>college kind of was a big disappointment</p>
<p>because the strongest or the biggest strength</p>
<p>of playing chess is that you mingle with people</p>
<p>from all different backgrounds, all different ages.</p>
<p>And when I went to college, the whole notion</p>
<p>of basically people who are juniors and seniors</p>
<p>being more important or more equal than others</p>
<p>to do the animal farm line,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re in that situation,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really jive with my childhood</p>
<p>and growing up in the world of chess.</p>
<p>And that is one of the biggest reasons</p>
<p>that I actually came back to chess</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like this world of where certain people</p>
<p>are more important and things are different.</p>
<p>I just could not really relate to that.</p>
<p>And that was one of the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>It really was.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the only reason.</p>
<p>The other reason though,</p>
<p>was that towards the end of my first semester,</p>
<p>I played a tournament after not studying.</p>
<p>Actually, when I was in college,</p>
<p>when I wasn&rsquo;t actually studying for class,</p>
<p>I was mainly on poker stars playing poker all night long.</p>
<p>So towards the end of that semester,</p>
<p>I actually went to play a tournament in Philadelphia</p>
<p>because I was going to college nearby.</p>
<p>And with very little preparation,</p>
<p>I won that tournament against other strong grandmasters.</p>
<p>And that kind of made me think,</p>
<p>well, okay, if I&rsquo;m ever going to take a chance,</p>
<p>it has to be now.</p>
<p>If I stay in college for four years,</p>
<p>probably get a major in political science,</p>
<p>do something in the political arena.</p>
<p>And then I felt like I&rsquo;m going to probably look back</p>
<p>like five, 10 years from now and wonder, what if?</p>
<p>What if I had played chess?</p>
<p>How far could I have gone?</p>
<p>And if I had taken those four years,</p>
<p>there would have been no opportunity</p>
<p>for me to reach my full potential</p>
<p>or even see how far I go.</p>
<p>So therefore, that was also a big, big reason.</p>
<p>So another what if question,</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t play chess, you mentioned political,</p>
<p>what other possible successful trajectory might have you had?</p>
<p>That depends on what point, really,</p>
<p>if when you ask that question.</p>
<p>I think if we&rsquo;re talking about the time of college,</p>
<p>probably I would have done something in political science,</p>
<p>maybe law, being a lobbyist or something terrible</p>
<p>like that, honestly.</p>
<p>If I was a little bit younger,</p>
<p>I really, I loved ancient history, archeology,</p>
<p>and also languages as well.</p>
<p>So probably something along those lines.</p>
<p>And if we talk more recently, something in finance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what exactly, but something in finance.</p>
<p>What do you think, when we talk again, 30 years,</p>
<p>what do you think you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>30 years.</p>
<p>I honestly want to believe that I&rsquo;m just sitting</p>
<p>in a beach house in Malibu, just relaxing.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So you and I are in a yacht for some reason.</p>
<p>Why we&rsquo;re in a yacht?</p>
<p>You paid for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your yacht.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to own a yacht.</p>
<p>No, okay, all right, fine.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like the amount of money you waste</p>
<p>on docking fees, the gas, no way, no way.</p>
<p>I guess I was trying to construct an example.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being super rich for some reason.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that.</p>
<p>Actually, no, I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>That actually does not appeal to me at all.</p>
<p>I think another great thing about chess</p>
<p>is that within the chess world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very prominent and famous,</p>
<p>but I can go out to the supermarket</p>
<p>and nobody recognized me.</p>
<p>And so I am famous, but I&rsquo;m not famous at the same time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actually want to be like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in a situation</p>
<p>where everyone recognizes me or I&rsquo;m super famous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, that to me sounds like a very miserable life.</p>
<p>I do not want TMZ chasing me down the street.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re famous in a community you love</p>
<p>and so whenever you plug into that community,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like there&rsquo;s a deep connection there.</p>
<p>You can always escape when you need a break.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people</p>
<p>about career, about life?</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re in high school, maybe they&rsquo;re in college.</p>
<p>Maybe they want to achieve the heights</p>
<p>that you have achieved in chess.</p>
<p>They want to do that for something they care about.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think the main thing is follow your heart,</p>
<p>follow your passion.</p>
<p>One thing we didn&rsquo;t touch on this,</p>
<p>like both my parents, my mom was a musician.</p>
<p>She was very good.</p>
<p>I think she was like maybe Allstate in California</p>
<p>when she was growing up on the violin.</p>
<p>But she still was nowhere near good enough</p>
<p>to get into Juilliard or the top music schools</p>
<p>and pursue that as a career.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of starving musicians</p>
<p>who never are able to quite make it.</p>
<p>So like when I see my mom and what happened</p>
<p>with her passion, the fact she wasn&rsquo;t able to make it,</p>
<p>or then my stepfather, who we haven&rsquo;t talked about.</p>
<p>My stepfather actually, he&rsquo;s of Sri Lankan descent.</p>
<p>He comes from a family of lawyers.</p>
<p>His father was a lawyer, his uncle was a lawyer</p>
<p>for the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a family of lawyers.</p>
<p>And my stepfather, he went to England to study law.</p>
<p>He went to Southampton.</p>
<p>I think it was University of Southampton.</p>
<p>And at some point he was going and playing</p>
<p>these tournaments on the weekend,</p>
<p>playing at the school club, all these things.</p>
<p>And his parents actually, they took away his chess board.</p>
<p>They took away his chess books.</p>
<p>They took everything away and told him</p>
<p>he was going to become a lawyer.</p>
<p>He could not play chess.</p>
<p>So when I look at my upbringing,</p>
<p>I feel very lucky that my parents,</p>
<p>having had these experiences,</p>
<p>they were so supportive of everything I did.</p>
<p>And I think that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you have to pursue your passion</p>
<p>to whatever end that might be.</p>
<p>You might pursue it, you might fail,</p>
<p>but I do think you have to pursue it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to have tried and failed</p>
<p>than have not tried at all.</p>
<p>So I really do believe that&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>is that you do that.</p>
<p>And where it takes you, who knows,</p>
<p>but the experiences I feel are much more important</p>
<p>than the what-ifs and possibly missing out on living life.</p>
<p>So even if it&rsquo;s everybody around you</p>
<p>and your own judgment says that this is not going</p>
<p>to be financially viable long-term, still pursue.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, at some point</p>
<p>you have to make those tough decisions, but absolutely.</p>
<p>I feel like too many people follow the standard route.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re supposed to go to college,</p>
<p>get that degree, be $200,000 in debt,</p>
<p>these sorts of things.</p>
<p>But then at the end of the day, are you really living?</p>
<p>Are you pursuing what you want to pursue?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what society tells us,</p>
<p>that the route you&rsquo;re supposed to go.</p>
<p>So I think you just have to pursue it.</p>
<p>Of course, at a certain point, if you&rsquo;re not making it,</p>
<p>you have to make hard decisions.</p>
<p>But I think that in life, the only thing really,</p>
<p>time and sort of experiences,</p>
<p>those are the only things</p>
<p>that you really can&rsquo;t put a price on.</p>
<p>Yeah, and really pursue it.</p>
<p>Even like streaming, I&rsquo;ll see people like,</p>
<p>or YouTube or that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a world in many ways foreign to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s levels to this game</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s a way to really pursue it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a way to half-ass it.</p>
<p>And I guess the point is not to half-ass it.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t just keep it a hobby, make it a full-time.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your passion, go all out.</p>
<p>So sometimes people can think that these things they love</p>
<p>is just a hobby, like music or something like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way to do it seriously, to go all out, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably my general advice,</p>
<p>is whatever it is, you pursue it.</p>
<p>Because even with chess, when I dropped out of college,</p>
<p>there was no guarantee that I was gonna make it</p>
<p>as a professional player.</p>
<p>There was no guarantee.</p>
<p>But I took that chance and very fortunately for me,</p>
<p>it worked out.</p>
<p>Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck</p>
<p>or a hundred duck-sized horses?</p>
<p>Probably a horse-sized duck.</p>
<p>Just one enemy is better than having to keep an eye</p>
<p>on a hundred.</p>
<p>Is this the stress or what, the anxiety?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, why don&rsquo;t you like a hundred?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re tiny.</p>
<p>Tiny?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Duck-sized horses.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re gonna attack you or not,</p>
<p>but I feel like having one enemy seeing</p>
<p>the clear objective, I would always, I prefer that.</p>
<p>If you could be someone else for a day, alive or dead,</p>
<p>who would you be?</p>
<p>Who would I wanna be for a day?</p>
<p>If I had to pick someone, actually,</p>
<p>I would probably pick Elon.</p>
<p>How many years ago is now?</p>
<p>When the rockets were blowing up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very interested to see those processes</p>
<p>of how they went through that</p>
<p>and they got out on the other side.</p>
<p>Because I feel like most of the time</p>
<p>when you hear about the startups,</p>
<p>like, okay, you look at Amazon.</p>
<p>You have the big investment to start.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t feel like there were those super, super lows</p>
<p>for the Amazons of the world.</p>
<p>Maybe not when the three rockets blew up,</p>
<p>but maybe when that, was it the fourth or fifth one?</p>
<p>Actually succeeded.</p>
<p>But somewhere in that timeframe.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is probably one of the lowest lows</p>
<p>that are publicly I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>Those are the moments that make us.</p>
<p>If everyone on earth disappeared</p>
<p>through a horrible atrocity and it was just you left,</p>
<p>what would your days look like?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>Just dead bodies and more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a movie like this, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many movies like this.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I could, I would probably just,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s like no life,</p>
<p>no plants, none of this stuff?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s life, just not in humans.</p>
<p>Not in human life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like goats and stuff.</p>
<p>Is it, what was the, I remember reading a,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s slightly different,</p>
<p>but there was a sci-fi book I read many years ago.</p>
<p>I think it was Rendezvous with Rama,</p>
<p>where I think there were people</p>
<p>that were just going all over the land in this cylinder.</p>
<p>And so I think for me, I would just explore.</p>
<p>I would just walk, bicycle, maybe plant some trees,</p>
<p>things of this nature.</p>
<p>I wonder how that would change your experience of nature,</p>
<p>knowing that it truly is,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of the magical things with nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling that it&rsquo;s just you out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love going hiking,</p>
<p>because obviously you get the exercise,</p>
<p>but honestly, it&rsquo;s a reminder of how small we really are.</p>
<p>And here you would realize,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an extra humbling effect</p>
<p>of you really are alone out here.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I probably spent a lot of time just thinking about,</p>
<p>thinking about everything too.</p>
<p>Do you hate losing in chess, or do you love winning?</p>
<p>Do I hate losing, or do I love winning?</p>
<p>I think I love, I love winning.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe because I&rsquo;m doing so many different things,</p>
<p>like losing doesn&rsquo;t have the same effect on me</p>
<p>that it once did.</p>
<p>So I think now I definitely love winning more,</p>
<p>but I think when I was younger, I hated losing</p>
<p>much more than I liked winning.</p>
<p>What comforts you on bad days?</p>
<p>I think similar to what gives me the motivation</p>
<p>for streaming is the fact that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>no matter how bad things appear or seem,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve never been at a better time in human history.</p>
<p>People have things much better off now than any other time.</p>
<p>So I find it hard to really have pity, or not have pity,</p>
<p>but like feel really bad.</p>
<p>I just use those sorts of things as like the way</p>
<p>to get over it, it&rsquo;s just knowing how lucky I am.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>Let me ask Hikaru about love.</p>
<p>Love is, I mean, I think it can be the greatest thing</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I think when things fall apart,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been through this quite a few times, actually.</p>
<p>Some really real highs, some really real lows as well.</p>
<p>I think love is, it can inspire you to do things</p>
<p>that you never thought were possible.</p>
<p>And without it, though, I think life is very empty.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably the most important thing</p>
<p>to have in life in one way or another.</p>
<p>Which is extra sad if you were the last person</p>
<p>left on Earth.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, again, also in terms of chess,</p>
<p>I think that it can be, as far as chess goes,</p>
<p>like or any competition, it can be the greatest thing</p>
<p>in the world, it can also be the worst thing in the world</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in love.</p>
<p>A lot of chess players, for many, it does not help them.</p>
<p>It actually makes them play much worse chess.</p>
<p>Because you kind of, you don&rsquo;t have that energy</p>
<p>or that drive in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very mixed for chess.</p>
<p>As far as me personally, though, I think, you know,</p>
<p>I would say what I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to have loved and lost</p>
<p>than to have never loved at all.</p>
<p>And I definitely have been through that.</p>
<p>I thought you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I thought you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It turns out you care sometimes, a little bit,</p>
<p>a tiny bit, a very, very, very tiny bit, Hikaru.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an amazing person, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an honor that you would talk with me today.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>Thank you, it was good being here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Hikaru Nakamura.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from David Bronstein.</p>
<p>It is my style to take my opponent and myself</p>
<p>onto unknown grounds.</p>
<p>A game of chess is not an examination of knowledge.</p>
<p>It is a battle of nerves.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
