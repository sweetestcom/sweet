    <p>you&rsquo;re seeing now the fresh summer collection of Laura Piana. This, Jason, is the thin summer</p>
<p>gilet. Okay, really beautiful cashmere. It&rsquo;s called like the King&rsquo;s cashmere or something.</p>
<p>And then this is called a lovely yellow boating sweater. Anyways, I took sacks to my tailor and I</p>
<p>took them to Laura Piana. And then at some point, I just fucking lost them. And then I haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>them since. You took them to your tailor and to Laura Piana. And to Laura Piana, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, great that the show remains accessible to the every man and woman.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sacks. Fuck yeah.</p>
<p>Look at you two, it&rsquo;s like twins. Oh my God, it&rsquo;s so perfect.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankans do. Oh my God. Did you guys have an announcement today?</p>
<p>Third announcement. Good to see everybody&rsquo;s focused on what matters. Okay, everybody,</p>
<p>welcome to All In episode 86, end of the world, except for these two douchebags.</p>
<p>We thought it&rsquo;d be really funny to find the exact same outfit at Laura Piana.</p>
<p>I feel fully styled. What a great look.</p>
<p>You guys look so good. It&rsquo;s like dumb and dumber in Italy.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, welcome to episode 86 of the All In podcast. We&rsquo;re not dead yet,</p>
<p>still publishing with us from Italy, the rain man and the dictator in matching outfits. Gentlemen,</p>
<p>how is Italy? It&rsquo;s fantastic. And also with us, the sultan of science himself,</p>
<p>David Friedberg from an undisclosed conference somewhere, which we can&rsquo;t talk about. How you</p>
<p>doing buddy? I&rsquo;m off the record this week. Off the record this week and a little hung over,</p>
<p>it seems. Yeah. You need a cup of coffee? Are you drinking a little scotch last night? Late night.</p>
<p>I went scotch and beer and it was a late night. All right, everybody, we got a lot of news to</p>
<p>get through. Let&rsquo;s just parse through some of the data because data has been coming in and the</p>
<p>minutes from the June Fed are out. The key quote, significant risk that elevated inflation could</p>
<p>become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Fed. So they went from transient</p>
<p>to now fearing entrenched. Jobs have slipped a little bit. This is something we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about. But just to give some context here, we&rsquo;re still a historic number of job openings. We</p>
<p>peaked in March 11.9 million. In May, we we dropped down to 11.3. And 11 million for six straight</p>
<p>months. It&rsquo;s just extraordinary. If you look at this Fred chart, it&rsquo;s just astounding to think</p>
<p>that this many jobs are available to for one in the United States, there are two jobs available</p>
<p>for every one person who needs a job. And this, they&rsquo;re just absolutely stunning. If you look at</p>
<p>the what do you think this is a precursor to dropping down dramatically in the white collar</p>
<p>sector is what the data is showing. What are major wage or major wage inflation? I mean,</p>
<p>yeah, that work clearly has to be done. And if you lay people off,</p>
<p>the number of unemployment, unemployed will go up. But at the end of the day, the thing that we</p>
<p>know here is we have a structural unemployment problem, as you said, two openings for every</p>
<p>person, which means those openings aren&rsquo;t paying enough for people to leave the sidelines and get</p>
<p>on the field. Yeah, or, or they&rsquo;ve been incentivized to, to be on the sidelines. Exactly. So these job</p>
<p>openings might actually be indicative of the opposite of what the Fed is telling us, right?</p>
<p>The Fed wants us to believe that they can just keep jacking up rates, and then we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to go into recession, because we have all these open job wrecks. But what if we should see the</p>
<p>labor market is really two separate markets, they&rsquo;re sort of white collar professionals.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing all of these tech companies that were involved in slam on the brakes</p>
<p>really quickly right now. So we&rsquo;re going to see greater unemployment there.</p>
<p>And then on the blue collar side, you have this issue of record low labor participation.</p>
<p>And so you still have inflation there, because they can&rsquo;t fill all the jobs,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these like warped incentives around that.</p>
<p>There are to just put a number on it sacks, we&rsquo;re 10% off the peak in terms of participation.</p>
<p>And if those folks would participate, it would really fill a lot of these jobs</p>
<p>that would increase the production of goods and services that might take some of the pressure</p>
<p>off inflation, and it would also increase monetary velocity, right sacks, people would</p>
<p>spend the money they make, which then get us out of this mess, possibly,</p>
<p>I think part of the problem with the Fed&rsquo;s approach here is that it&rsquo;s assuming that if</p>
<p>they just keep jacking up rates that will that will reduce demand, and that will stop or slow</p>
<p>down inflation. And there&rsquo;s some truth to that. However, I don&rsquo;t think this inflation is purely a</p>
<p>problem of excess demand. I think there&rsquo;s also a supply problem, meaning that not enough goods</p>
<p>and services are being produced. And the commodities, the inputs that we need to the</p>
<p>production of goods and services, those prices are increased there, they&rsquo;ve been inflated.</p>
<p>And that started well before the Ukraine war. But I think the Ukraine war has now exacerbated</p>
<p>this problem with respect to energy and food. If you had seven minutes for your over under</p>
<p>for sacks to mention Ukraine, you took the under you I&rsquo;m just mentioning as as a</p>
<p>exacerbator. I think that&rsquo;s actually really good framing that it&rsquo;s an exacerbator.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t start with this.</p>
<p>Yeah. So if you look at the quits, let me just give you the quits number,</p>
<p>because this is really interesting. These are people who are actually quitting jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still at a record high. So this concept of the Great Resignation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still having over 4 million people quit their jobs every month.</p>
<p>Free pandemic quits averaged under 3 million a month. And if you look at that chart,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just staggering to think that in an economy that&rsquo;s going down, people are still quitting.</p>
<p>Now, what is that indicative of? It&rsquo;s indicative of people believing that they can get another job,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t quit your job, if you don&rsquo;t think you can get another one,</p>
<p>or you have some savings available, you want to YOLO, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>you know, spend a little free time going on vacation,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a new economy emerging, right? I mean, one of the cases to be made is that</p>
<p>the pandemic and the stimulus that followed created a staggering short shift in the types</p>
<p>of jobs and the types of businesses that people, you know, use to make money. And,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of people were able to shift to work from home. And when you shift to work</p>
<p>from home, you have more flexibility and freedom to choose other jobs that you can now do from home.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t want to work in restaurants, they don&rsquo;t want to work in fast food.</p>
<p>And if they can find another job, a gig like or services like or on demand type job,</p>
<p>where they can have more freedom and flexibility and more earnings in their life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll make that choice. And this happened so quickly, because of the shutdown, the lockdowns,</p>
<p>and then the stimulus, the trillion dollars or $2 trillion that poured in,</p>
<p>it created all these new opportunities and all these new incentives for new types of work. And</p>
<p>the fact is, the old economy, the old businesses, all the fast food restaurants, and the coffee</p>
<p>shops, they&rsquo;re sitting with half employment, and they can&rsquo;t fill the jobs because that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, that that used to be a job that there was demand for, it&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>you know, and I think that by the way, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know if that necessarily reverts in the</p>
<p>near term, because I do think that there&rsquo;s been a substantial, almost permanent change in some</p>
<p>of these sectors of the economy, not necessarily all some will revert, but it leaves big gaps in</p>
<p>parts of the economy. And maybe fast food restaurants are not going to be as cheap as</p>
<p>they used to be. Because in order to get people to work there, you got to charge more. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other parts of the economy like services and selling stuff on Etsy and whatnot that are</p>
<p>working for people. Let me just put a number on that and then hand it off to you, sex to just put</p>
<p>a number on that. The jobs that fell the most white collar off 325,000 and manufacturing 208,000</p>
<p>the jobs that are increasing the most hospitality and retail. So exactly to your point, people feel</p>
<p>more options. This whole thing was accelerated during the pandemic sex. Well, the question I</p>
<p>want to ask free burgers, do you actually think that these new options of work from home and</p>
<p>remote work have actually made the economy more productive? It seems to me that obviously</p>
<p>employees if you give them the no freedom over the decision of their trade off between work and</p>
<p>leisure and let&rsquo;s make the economy more expensive. How so? If you take a big step back to the day</p>
<p>before the lockdowns started, we had a normal functioning an economy that was growing by call</p>
<p>it 2% a year. And the minute that we enforce these lockdowns, I actually think what we did was</p>
<p>we started a supply side recession. It&rsquo;s what sack said earlier. So what does that mean? Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say you&rsquo;re a factory and you make wheels, okay, just make something really simple. You</p>
<p>were growing at 2% a year, everything seemed hunky dory, you had employees, it was fine,</p>
<p>you used to sell your products, make 10 15% profits, everything was fine. And then the day</p>
<p>after the government said you need to shut your factory down, because we can&rsquo;t have people</p>
<p>spending too much time close together, because we need to get a handle on this pandemic.</p>
<p>Okay, so you shut it down. And then for the next 12 or 18 months, what happens that stuff sits idle,</p>
<p>these people that used to work for you get two and a half trillion dollars put into their bank</p>
<p>accounts, they spend their time doing other things. And then all of a sudden, people say,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s time to start the factory up again, people want to buy wheels. And now all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you find that because everything all around the world was shut down, there&rsquo;s no rubber</p>
<p>to make the wheels, there&rsquo;s no steel to make the axle, there&rsquo;s no people to put them all together.</p>
<p>And so what happens? Well, prices go up, because again, you gave everybody else two and a half</p>
<p>trillion dollars. So they&rsquo;re like, Well, I used to pay $1 for your wheel, I&rsquo;m willing to pay you $2.</p>
<p>Now, just make the wheel, give it to me before you give it to somebody else. So that is like</p>
<p>the classic definition of a supply side recession. There&rsquo;s another piece to that, too. And sorry,</p>
<p>just to finish the point. And the Fed basically confirmed this in the minutes that they just</p>
<p>released today, Jason, can you just read the quote that you had in the in the notes?</p>
<p>Well, the one up top a significant risk that elevated inflation should become entrenched if</p>
<p>the public begins to question the resolve their resolve. I think the point is that, you know,</p>
<p>we were kind of in a supply side recession. And now, by raising rates to some crazy amount,</p>
<p>the end of which we&rsquo;re still not sure about, may actually then trigger the demand destruction to</p>
<p>have a demand side recession. And so I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve lived in a modern</p>
<p>point in time, where both things have been true. Right? There&rsquo;s been a principle of macro economics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re everybody&rsquo;s always kind of debating, is this a supply side issue? Is it a demand side</p>
<p>issue? We know that in COVID, it was a supply side issue, we took all the supply out of the market.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re trying to figure out when we exhaust, you know, all of the money we&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>people, and we destroy demand and take the incentives for demand to go away, right, consumer</p>
<p>confidence is now starting to turn. What happens then? Well, we&rsquo;re going to figure that out in the</p>
<p>next six or nine months. But the thing is, you have both that are true. It&rsquo;s not as if the supply</p>
<p>side of the economy has been fixed. It&rsquo;s not as if everybody is running at 100% capacity. It&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>if all the supply chain issues have been worked out. Yep. So I don&rsquo;t know, I just think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very complicated situation. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a perfect pivot, pivot. And just to build on that, Chamath,</p>
<p>the downstream effects, we always talk about the second order impact, because people are not going</p>
<p>to work anymore. downtown areas are dying. So office space, commercial real estate sacks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that so you can comment on what&rsquo;s happening. And then restaurants and commuting</p>
<p>and all the stuff that was happening downtown, San Francisco&rsquo;s downtown, let Maryland and breed</p>
<p>had a press conference. And she&rsquo;s been tweeting, hey, we have to revitalize. You know, Soma in</p>
<p>San Francisco, that&rsquo;s never going to happen. That&rsquo;s off the table. It&rsquo;s like Biden tweeting,</p>
<p>we got to drop gas prices. Yeah, I mean, we have complete incompetence, but we&rsquo;ll get to politics.</p>
<p>sacks, don&rsquo;t worry, we got plenty of politics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s your flop, gentlemen.</p>
<p>But on San Francisco real estate, I read an amazing statistic today from like one of the</p>
<p>major brokers. They they said that by the end of the year, they&rsquo;re expecting 30 million square</p>
<p>feet of office vacancy 30 million in San Francisco by the end of the year.</p>
<p>San Francisco is tiny, by the way,</p>
<p>because of sub leases and, and then tenants rolling off. So the first thing I did is I tried</p>
<p>to Google what&rsquo;s the total square footage in San Francisco. And I think it&rsquo;s about 75 million</p>
<p>of office space. Oh, my 40% vacancy by the end of the year. I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>40%.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, San Francisco is fairly unique and a bit of an outlier in the circumstance,</p>
<p>because so much of it was, you know, tech heavy, and so much of it went remote. Yeah.</p>
<p>And the city, and it all got crime. But like, generally, that&rsquo;s not the case. I mean, you know,</p>
<p>New York is apparently still pretty stable, right? And Miami&rsquo;s obviously doing well, LA Austin,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the piece of it that people aren&rsquo;t really thinking about, which is,</p>
<p>the only reason it&rsquo;s stable is because tenants sign up for long term leases.</p>
<p>And this is why it turns out that we work with a pretty bad business model is because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re if all your leases are month to month, and you hit a recession,</p>
<p>your revenue gets whammied. This is why landlords like long term leases with creditworthy tenants,</p>
<p>they signed seven years, 10 years and so on letters of credit, right?</p>
<p>Putting your dad means though, is that as these tenants start to roll their leases roll over the</p>
<p>next few years, they don&rsquo;t need as much space because they&rsquo;ve either gotten remote, or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like hybrid now. And so they&rsquo;re thinking of their office less as a headquarters, which everyone</p>
<p>needs to go to, and more as like a co working space, their employees occasionally go to,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re all reducing their footprints. This is why San Francisco keeps increasing its vacancy</p>
<p>is that as more and more of these leases roll, there&rsquo;s just no need, they don&rsquo;t need as much</p>
<p>space. So they&rsquo;re also downsizing. Now, here&rsquo;s the problem. Here&rsquo;s the problem is that these</p>
<p>buildings have debt on them, right? And that debt has was called a debt service coverage ratio,</p>
<p>DSCR. And basically, you become a you as a building owner, become in default on your</p>
<p>debt covenants. If your revenue from the building drops below a certain number,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the problem, all these new leases that get signed to the extent there are any,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be at a fraction of what the old leases were, because this vacancy</p>
<p>is going to create a massively low market clearing price.</p>
<p>Am I right to understand that they&rsquo;re not allowed to sign those leases because they&rsquo;re under it?</p>
<p>So can the landlord take it as better than nothing? Or do they are not allowed to take it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s just that the market clearing prices can be so much lower than their old leases</p>
<p>that when they then look at the revenue from the building, and by the way, that building is gonna</p>
<p>have a lot of vacancy on it. Now, they&rsquo;re just not gonna be able to hit their their debt service</p>
<p>coverage ratio. So they will be in default. What that means is, I don&rsquo;t understand how in a place</p>
<p>like downtown San Francisco, half the buildings don&rsquo;t end up getting owned by the banks. Well,</p>
<p>the banks don&rsquo;t want to own all these buildings. So there&rsquo;s gonna be a fire sale. But I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who the buyers are going to be. I mean, they just have to convert it, right? I mean, that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that they got to convert these to residential because we have a housing crisis still.</p>
<p>That takes years and years. That takes years and years. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a repositioning play.</p>
<p>First, you need the cooperation of the city government, which isn&rsquo;t gonna happen. Then you</p>
<p>need developers to come in and have the capital to basically make all those changes. Again,</p>
<p>it takes a long time. But think about the systemic risk from that, right? If you know</p>
<p>that a huge chunk of the real estate in the commercial real estate in downtown San Francisco,</p>
<p>which used to be blue chip, I mean, the most blue chip, right? Who are those financial institutions</p>
<p>who own those assets? Because they are now toxic assets. And they will be revealed to be toxic</p>
<p>assets as soon as the leases roll. Well, and then there are debt funds and banks as well, right?</p>
<p>And so what are the cascading effects when those shoes start to drop?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. And so just to put a finer point also on the jobs, and that was our flop.</p>
<p>Net international migration has just plummeted. We&rsquo;re well under a million folks coming into</p>
<p>the country. So the obvious solution to our employment issues is to recruit people from</p>
<p>other countries. But let&rsquo;s go to the turn card. Yeah, there it is. We have just stopped letting</p>
<p>people Trump just absolutely closed the borders, as you can see, 2016. Biden also is in favor of</p>
<p>closing the borders. It&rsquo;s also sentiment. It&rsquo;s like, you know, America is not the shining</p>
<p>people still light on the hill. It used to be not in the same way.</p>
<p>And there are easily have three or 4 million people coming into the country if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have 3 million people have come in just under Biden and illegal migration.</p>
<p>Does that chart count illegal migration? No, this is legal. This is legal. Okay,</p>
<p>well, so just make sure you count that. Because we&rsquo;ve basically had a border policy.</p>
<p>Yeah. If we didn&rsquo;t allow those workers in what would happen? Okay, let&rsquo;s go to the turn card</p>
<p>consumer confidence conference boards consumer confidence index in June fell to 98.7 from</p>
<p>103.2 in May. expectation was 100. So it&rsquo;s under the expectation, the expectation index. So when</p>
<p>you look at consumer confidence, there&rsquo;s to your confidence in the present situation, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>blue on the chart. And then there&rsquo;s your expectations of the future. And what you see is</p>
<p>a huge divergence, they&rsquo;re starting to happen, people are starting to look towards the future</p>
<p>as negative, but they feel pretty good about today. And so, gentlemen, what do you think of</p>
<p>this chart? It seems to me like this is sort of akin to what sacks was relaying about that founder</p>
<p>at the CO2 conference, which is like, you know, he thinks everybody else is gonna, you know,</p>
<p>roll up their sleeves and buckle down, but he has no intention of doing it. I think people</p>
<p>are roughly the same way. And I think their behavior is, well, you know, if things are</p>
<p>going to get hard, I&rsquo;ll deal with it in the future. But right now, I have money in my pocket.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you look at airlines, and how many people are trying to travel, if you just look</p>
<p>at like the cost of a hotel room, if you look at what&rsquo;s happening this summer, it does not seem</p>
<p>like people are slowing down or tapping the brakes in any way. Yeah, I get concerned about</p>
<p>credit, because it&rsquo;s not coming from wage gains, you know, the increased cost is there,</p>
<p>the increased income, it&rsquo;s not. And, you know, we&rsquo;re seeing continued month after month increases</p>
<p>in consumer credit balances. And that I think, you know, this was the point I made a few episodes</p>
<p>ago was I don&rsquo;t think people are going to slow down how they&rsquo;re living and how they&rsquo;re spending.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what there&rsquo;s an inertia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I just think after two years of a lockdown, I do think that people are</p>
<p>anxious to reestablish some amount of normalcy. And this is really the first summer where</p>
<p>everybody writ large, can be out and do the things that they were planning.</p>
<p>Last year was a little bit of a head fake. And look, you have two years of pent up plans of,</p>
<p>you know, wedding anniversaries, and weddings and all of this stuff that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so I think people are really spending money.</p>
<p>And if you look at it, you know, the consumer is holding up amazingly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be some combination of jobs, home prices, and this inflation.</p>
<p>But this is why I there has not been a downtick in demand. I don&rsquo;t know why everybody thinks</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s been a downtick in demand. There was an article today numbers yet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not showing up in the numbers yet.</p>
<p>No, I think it is anecdotal and guess very subtle. Okay, sure. It is there is a subtle</p>
<p>I actually disagree with you guys. I actually think that the economy is pivoting on a dime here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s starting to show up subtly in the numbers. Here&rsquo;s some other data points,</p>
<p>consumer sentiment, biggest drop in consumer sentiment in 40 years, that was in the last</p>
<p>month, right track, wrong track polling, only 10% of the country thinks we&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>
<p>If you pull people and ask, are we in a recession, something like close to 60% of the country</p>
<p>already thinks we&rsquo;re in a recession. There&rsquo;s a slight political tint to that more Republicans</p>
<p>than Democrats think we&rsquo;re in a recession. However, even roughly half of Democrats</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re in a recession. So I think those are all feelings, not behavior,</p>
<p>though, sex, we&rsquo;re looking at the data, not the sentiment.</p>
<p>I think the behavior will catch up with the sentiment. I think the behavior,</p>
<p>I think the behavior is pivoting. It&rsquo;s just that I think you have to dig beneath the</p>
<p>surface. And you have to look at things like retail, sales, things like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, David, if you look back on all the number of times consumer sentiment is dipped,</p>
<p>that the correlation to spending patterns is so uniformly predictive, as we think,</p>
<p>I mean, I think that there are, there&rsquo;s a slight positive correlation, I remember,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like, you know, 0.75, 0.81. It&rsquo;s not that. So there&rsquo;s this weird</p>
<p>preference falsification that happens when you get asked, what do you think is going to happen</p>
<p>versus what do you do? And I think a lot of consumers, that&rsquo;s why they have, you know,</p>
<p>we know the data in America, like less than a month of savings, or whatever those numbers are,</p>
<p>despite all of the sentiment analysis and all of this stuff, you would think that there&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>behavior change. But mostly people kind of just live in the moment. And you know, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>partly because they don&rsquo;t have the structural support to save or other things. But the reality</p>
<p>is that most folks, from what they say to what they behave, there is a gap.</p>
<p>Yeah. And to your point, sax, this is starting to catch up, we&rsquo;re seeing a slight downtick,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go to real estate next. But if you look, I found I was doing some research on gasoline,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s obviously where people are getting hit the most. The average household is now</p>
<p>spending 5000 a year on gasoline. That&rsquo;s almost double last year. So this is going to have an</p>
<p>impact is going to catch up. But there&rsquo;s so many jobs available. And there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>unemployed, I think it&rsquo;s manageable. So to your point, your mouth, it feels like consumers can</p>
<p>manage even this great headwind. Let me just put a point to it. I think the average</p>
<p>per capita income in the US about $38,000 a year that works out to about 17 bucks and 50 cents an</p>
<p>hour, roughly. Think about a person with that level of earnings. The average household in the</p>
<p>US has historically, you know, spent about a third on housing, about 13% on food, and about</p>
<p>16% on you know, their car and their gas, and they only have about 12% leftover for savings.</p>
<p>So you know, if that 13% on food has jumped by 30%, the 16% that they&rsquo;re spending on gas has</p>
<p>jumped by 40%, or 50%. And even if housing prices take up a little bit, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>your savings are gone. And you&rsquo;re actually not saying it&rsquo;s actually doubled freeberg. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doubled, I guess. So yeah, by the way, it&rsquo;s worse than you say, no, it&rsquo;s worse than you say,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using a per capita number. Yeah, yeah. And so what, but I think what I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to highlight is that there is a distribution, there is a group of the United States, a small</p>
<p>percentage of minority that have earned good income and are having their 50th anniversary,</p>
<p>like to mop is talking about taking their travel, and that shows up in the numbers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s outside spending happening with a segment of the economy. And what Saks is saying, I think</p>
<p>is right as well, which is that the majority of Americans are facing this really critical budget</p>
<p>crisis, where their personal spending levels are now exceeding their income levels. And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>critical need for credit, and for personal debt and spending to go down. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to drive significant risk in the next couple of months and quarters and years is that the majority</p>
<p>it looks some of the numbers will look good, because there&rsquo;s a segment of the economy that</p>
<p>is overspending. But the majority of the economy is as Saks is saying, probably turning on a dime.</p>
<p>And I think both things can be true. Yeah, let me let me maybe tie a couple of these things</p>
<p>together. Because I tend to agree with you. Like I think that we have been in a supply side recession,</p>
<p>that is what has caused inflation, we have to go through a process of taking all the excess money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been put in out. And when you do that, we will destroy demand. And then that&rsquo;ll trigger</p>
<p>demand side recession, because people will asset values, and we will destroy asset values. So</p>
<p>that process asset values went real quick. Yeah, that will happen second.</p>
<p>So the balance sheets of that segment of the population that is overspending right now,</p>
<p>once their balance sheets really take the hit may take a hard look at what their savings are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to cut spending. Right? Yeah. So the point is, I think we&rsquo;re still firmly in</p>
<p>that first phase. And I and I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But the reason why I think</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re still in the first part of this process is because people, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>still have a lot of savings because of all the stimulus checks, there is still a lot of money.</p>
<p>So what, how will we know maybe is the better point, when all of that excess savings has been,</p>
<p>you know, torn away from these people because of high prices, I suspect it&rsquo;s when Jason&rsquo;s first</p>
<p>chart starts to close, right? So when people are, you know, go, they&rsquo;re more motivated to reenter</p>
<p>the workforce, I think that&rsquo;s a signal. Freeberg, your signal is another one, which is when credit</p>
<p>delinquencies really start to spike. It&rsquo;s because people then, you know, tapped out their savings,</p>
<p>then they tap their credit cards, and then all of a sudden, they become delinquent.</p>
<p>When all of those things happen, you&rsquo;re probably now at a point where that first phase of the</p>
<p>supply side issues are largely done. And now you get to the demand destruction. But all of those</p>
<p>roads, unfortunately, lead to the same conclusion, which is like, you know, equities get really</p>
<p>under pressure, there is no scenario where there&rsquo;s a bid to equities, why would you buy something</p>
<p>that has lower earnings in the future? Or why would you buy something that has a lower discount</p>
<p>rate for profits in the future? In this case, both are true. All right, let&rsquo;s get to that.</p>
<p>Because the piece we haven&rsquo;t got to, so here&rsquo;s the river card is housing, because people&rsquo;s homes are</p>
<p>the majority of their wealth here in the United States. And that I think will be the true indicator</p>
<p>trim off to your point, labor participation, certainly one, but when this hits housing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;re going to know we&rsquo;re in the end game. The mortgage rate just hit 5.3%.</p>
<p>Why do you say housing is the end game?</p>
<p>Well, I think we haven&rsquo;t seen the collapse of housing prices yet. We&rsquo;re in a housing shortage.</p>
<p>And historically, mortgages are still at, you know, the 30 year average. So let me just give</p>
<p>you the statistics here. The mortgage rate is 5.3%. If you look at this chart from our childhood on</p>
<p>our parents in the 80s, we&rsquo;re paying 15 1670 17 17% for their mortgages were well below the 50</p>
<p>year average even with the rate hikes. And so the 50 year average for mortgages, the 30 year mortgage</p>
<p>is 7.77. So we&rsquo;re at 5.3 well below that. But well, this has been a very quick turnaround from</p>
<p>two and a half percent mortgages all the way up to 5.3%. Home sales have started to show weakness.</p>
<p>So to Sax&rsquo;s point, this is starting to show up in the numbers. But ever so much, we&rsquo;re down 6%,</p>
<p>almost 7% year over year and 3.5% month over month, but we&rsquo;re holding up historically. So</p>
<p>for the last 10 years, we&rsquo;ve been selling over 5 million homes a month with the exception of the</p>
<p>pandemic shutdown. And that&rsquo;s this next chart you&rsquo;re going to see here. And this is a really</p>
<p>amazing chart I found, which is existing home sales versus a 30 year fixed rate mortgage in</p>
<p>our childhoods in the 80s. We&rsquo;re selling two or 3 million homes a year. As you see the rates,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the orange line come down massively from 17%. And then under 10% housing starts to flip</p>
<p>people start flipping houses more and more often. But we&rsquo;re still at that 5 million that numbers got</p>
<p>to drop down to probably four, and then we would actually have some capitulation feedback from the</p>
<p>panel. I mean, look, there&rsquo;s an old saying that a recession is when your neighbor loses his job</p>
<p>and a depression is when you lose your job. And the reality is we haven&rsquo;t had the big job losses</p>
<p>yet. It&rsquo;s starting, we can start to see it in the number of open recs are getting closed. And then</p>
<p>there were those job loss numbers that just came out, which were a little higher than expected.</p>
<p>So the job losses are starting. But so far, it&rsquo;s really been the step prior to that, which is</p>
<p>people are seeing their 401ks get destroyed, stock markets down. They&rsquo;re seeing their wages</p>
<p>get destroyed by inflation, food and gas prices being much higher. So there&rsquo;s a really good reason</p>
<p>why people are so, sentiment is so negative out there. People feel poorer than they were before.</p>
<p>And this could get worse, like you&rsquo;re saying, Jason, with their nest egg in their homes getting</p>
<p>hit. I agree. That&rsquo;s the next shoe to drop, just like the commercial real estate is the next shoe</p>
<p>to drop. But I think the really big question over the next six months is what sort of job losses do</p>
<p>we see? Because that really is going to be the big determinant of of how hard this recession hits.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you. And it&rsquo;s it doesn&rsquo;t look like if we if we&rsquo;re losing 300,000 jobs a month,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take a long time for us to even get to one for one jobs. And so this is very weird.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think I think you&rsquo;re right. But I think we&rsquo;re not even close to that. I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see where all of a sudden there are these writ large mass layoffs. For example, I would believe</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying if if the headline in the Wall Street Journal said Walmart lays off 10,000 people,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening. In fact, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. Walmart&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>you know, we seem to have record demand, we&rsquo;re raising prices, and every supplier will have to</p>
<p>pay a gas tax and a supplier tax and deal with it. So I just think that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be right in the end. I just think we&rsquo;re way too early in this process to get to that place where</p>
<p>we did. We&rsquo;re debating this. I don&rsquo;t see search about Are you on board with the the Ackman trade?</p>
<p>Basically, you know, Ackman basically came out that tweets from a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>basically saying that, listen, inflation is still the big problem, not recession,</p>
<p>the economy is humming along. There&rsquo;s plenty of jobs. And we&rsquo;re gonna have a persistent problem</p>
<p>with inflation. I think he&rsquo;s kind of right and kind of wrong. I think that you can have inflation</p>
<p>and a recession at the same time. This is what my point is, I think we have been in</p>
<p>a supply side recession, meaning the day of the pandemic, it&rsquo;s not as if demand stopped,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if you and I, David didn&rsquo;t want to go out or use DoorDash or take an Uber,</p>
<p>or watch a movie in a movie theater, we were not allowed, right. And so we found other ways in in</p>
<p>order to fulfill our demand. That&rsquo;s why Shopify, you know, did so well on behalf of the merchants</p>
<p>that they served. That&rsquo;s why Robin Hood did so well. That&rsquo;s why fortnight did so well, right,</p>
<p>we found other places to spend money. But what went away was a supply. And those incentives</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t come back. And they&rsquo;re still not back. That&rsquo;s why prices keep going up.</p>
<p>This is the problem is the definition of a recession, right? Chamath?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the problem is that most people don&rsquo;t understand that you can have a supply side</p>
<p>recession and a demand side recession. They just manifest in different ways. So well, I think I</p>
<p>think like, I guess Ackman is roughly right, in some ways, he&rsquo;s roughly not so right. And some</p>
<p>others, I think that we have an issue where we are going to transfer the supply side issues that</p>
<p>are driving inflation to average everyday consumers and their ability to buy things.</p>
<p>I still think that the average everyday consumers desire to buy things is what it was from before.</p>
<p>And on the margin is probably higher. I do think at some point, it will start to change</p>
<p>when prices get high enough. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve reached that point of equilibrium yet.</p>
<p>And the reason is because companies like the Walmarts of the world who see this demand</p>
<p>on literally a real time basis, knows better than anybody else when and how much they can</p>
<p>raise prices downstream into their supply chain. So when you see something like this in the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal, I would just encourage us all to say, they must see that demand is the same or</p>
<p>better. And so they&rsquo;re going to now push those price increases down to everybody else, because</p>
<p>now Walmart says, here&rsquo;s an opportunity for me to defend my earnings power. And this is why I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in this first inning of this. So I don&rsquo;t know whether Ackman is right or wrong. But I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the early phases of a two phase recession. And I don&rsquo;t know what that looks like, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never lived through one of those. And I think in many ways, it&rsquo;s the combination of the two.</p>
<p>And it was it was largely because of government failure, government failure, and how we reacted</p>
<p>to the pandemic. In hindsight, sacks was right all along. We overreacted by shutting everything</p>
<p>down, we probably could have kept some supply online, by understanding masking early on.</p>
<p>And then second, we exacerbated with failed government policy, because we gave everybody</p>
<p>trillions and trillions of dollars. And we entered the capital markets and perverted it with another</p>
<p>seven or 8 trillion more. And by the way, stay that has consequences. Well, the consequences are</p>
<p>still talking about giving stimulus. Yeah, now in order to help people deal with so we are not we</p>
<p>are not learning, I can you can&rsquo;t pour fire. So if I eat on the fire, if I had to basically put what</p>
<p>we are all saying into a neat little bow, I would say there needs to be a multi phased economic</p>
<p>correction, one that corrects the supply that we took out of the market during the pandemic,</p>
<p>one that corrects for all the excess money, and then one that corrects for demand. That&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of stuff we have to do. So the more misguided government policy we have, the farther away from</p>
<p>finding that equilibrium point, we&rsquo;re going to be the longer it&rsquo;s going to take, the more damage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be. So sacks, the Fed is obviously, it&rsquo;s pretty much consensus, they&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>another point 7575 basis points later this month, could be 50 basis points, who knows, there seems</p>
<p>to be a couple of people saying that that might happen. If that does happen, and it feels like</p>
<p>inflation is starting to top out, do you think inflation? You know, starts to turn? Or do you</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re still going to see prices go up? Because it does feel like it was starting to</p>
<p>bounce along the ceiling? Where do you what do you think is going to happen if the point 75</p>
<p>happens? You&rsquo;re seeing the market rally today in the last few days, especially gross stocks,</p>
<p>because of this idea that the Fed is tackling inflation, they&rsquo;re raising rates, and the market</p>
<p>is looking out six months and seeing the possibility of recession. And they believe</p>
<p>that is going to bring down demand and bring down prices. And it could be what I just described,</p>
<p>would be a soft landing, I just am skeptical, there&rsquo;s gonna be a soft landing, because of what</p>
<p>saying, which is this is a multi part problem. And until we fix the supply side, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that merely reducing demand is going to get us out of this. I really agree with you. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>production problem. It&rsquo;s a demand problem. And it&rsquo;s also as we just talked about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>an employment problem, because the businesses that need to grow that need to generate revenue</p>
<p>cannot get the businesses that are dependent on people to do service jobs cannot get those jobs</p>
<p>filled. And so they cannot grow their revenue cannot make their profits. And there&rsquo;s a trickling</p>
<p>effect in the economy of that, you know, what we talked about that kind of job shift, that job</p>
<p>market shift that&rsquo;s happened. So all three, and so all three are just this like dislocation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened. Totally right. And it&rsquo;s unclear, you know, someone very smart, I was talking to yesterday,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a former member of an administration said, we just there&rsquo;s literally no way to predict,</p>
<p>but we just don&rsquo;t because you think about the complexity of throwing three rocks in a pond,</p>
<p>how do those three rocks interact? And how do the ripples interact is really what we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>predict. And it&rsquo;s very hard to do. I mean, if you translate this into the markets for one second,</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;ve done since November of 21. And Nick, you should play this clip because,</p>
<p>you know, not to say, you know, we didn&rsquo;t see this coming. But we really did, you know,</p>
<p>we pointed to, you know, one of our friends and a person, somebody else that we kind of know,</p>
<p>Bezos and Elon, and we said, when the two smartest capital allocators in the world,</p>
<p>start divesting, they clearly understand and see things that the rest of us should pay attention</p>
<p>to and to ignore it seems reckless or the clip. And we&rsquo;ll be back in 30 seconds after the clip.</p>
<p>The two most important founders of our generation, the two smartest people who have really</p>
<p>consistently won Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have collectively sold more than $11 billion of their</p>
<p>holdings this year alone. And if you can&rsquo;t take all of that and decide for yourself what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>for you and your family, you&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice. I think it&rsquo;s important for me to</p>
<p>never sort of like be forced to tell folks whether I&rsquo;m buying or selling, although I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>willing to do it in moments where I think it&rsquo;s important. But I think it&rsquo;s really important to</p>
<p>understand the context. And so I think like these folks that like think derisively about</p>
<p>individuals who are managing risk, I think it&rsquo;s really naive. And I think it&rsquo;s, it creates a lot</p>
<p>of missed opportunity for them as well. If the smartest people in the world are now selling</p>
<p>their core holdings that they told you they would never sell, and you are not reconsidering your</p>
<p>position on things, you&rsquo;re either much smarter than them, or you&rsquo;re being really, really reckless.</p>
<p>That was November, you know, and at that moment, I started a bunch of things in process,</p>
<p>which we can talk about at the end, but I also sold a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>You sold the warrior&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>I started a process at that point, and I sold a piece in December, and then I just sold the</p>
<p>last piece this week. But then, you know, I sold a big piece of SoFi in that moment.</p>
<p>But the point was more the following, which is since that clip to today, what we&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>through is a massive re rating of the discount factor of these companies, assuming nothing else</p>
<p>changes, right, that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve done, we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve not questioned whether earnings can change,</p>
<p>you know, all we said is, Okay, well, now we&rsquo;re going to take the discount rate up,</p>
<p>which means the value of this company is less than it used to be. That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve done through</p>
<p>all of this wealth destruction that&rsquo;s happened since November. But now the second shoe has to</p>
<p>drop, which is if you believe that after this supply side issues are resolved, when you go</p>
<p>through a demand destruction phase, the earnings of these companies are in real trouble. And Jason,</p>
<p>you posted something I think about the social media companies and</p>
<p>going to get hit, right. So one of the first things to go in a recession is advertising,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to belt tighten at a company, where can you do it? Well, you lay off employees,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t get out of your leases, as we talked about in real estate, but you can cut your</p>
<p>spending on marketing. And so right now they it&rsquo;s looking pretty bleak for Facebook because of the</p>
<p>headwinds they have. So the earnings could drop, which means and by the way, the earnings ratio</p>
<p>could be totally talked about. These are not real, right? Well, we talked about that. We talked about</p>
<p>that over the last few weeks, which is every time the market rallied, oddly, Facebook would be</p>
<p>stagnant or trade off. And we know when I called people on Wall Street, what they said was because,</p>
<p>you know, we think this is the company that has the most pressure on earnings. I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true or not. But they took every opportunity and rallies to trim their position in Facebook.</p>
<p>Now, if that&rsquo;s true, you have to remind yourself that is one of the 10 best companies in the entire</p>
<p>world. And so if you&rsquo;re going to go and question the earnings power of one of the 10 best companies</p>
<p>in the world, you may want to consider the earnings power of every other company that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not Facebook, there are some unique things to the Facebook story, they are facing a unique disruptive</p>
<p>moment with Apple ankling their ability to target users supposedly Google might follow suit with</p>
<p>that, which would be super anti competitive and also the surging tick tock, taking market share</p>
<p>for them. There&rsquo;s some good news in energy, which will then dovetail into politics and into this</p>
<p>farming situation. Friedberg Turkish government claims it just discovered almost 700 million</p>
<p>metric tons of rare earth minerals. It&rsquo;s 15 times China&rsquo;s reserve if this is true. You guys probably</p>
<p>know we use about 150,000 metric tons a year right now that&rsquo;s going to double by 2030. This</p>
<p>is something like 4000 years at the current demand. And this would put them far beyond anybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Chamath you&rsquo;ve got investments in this space. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been tracking this news</p>
<p>thoughts on another massive discovery of rare earths. What did you guys just have dinner,</p>
<p>dinner or surf? What do you guys know? Nat&rsquo;s the best she brought she brought us to show me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an incredible restaurant here in Milan called DeSantis, which makes the best paninis</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever tasted. Is this a harbinger of the future DeSantis? What can be more perfect than</p>
<p>that? Oh, the DeSantis panini. Here you go. This is the Oracle sacked with a subliminal influence.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Oh, good. This is what&rsquo;s gonna get us out of this situation. DeSantis.</p>
<p>All right, come off just quickly on the rare earths. If this is actually true.</p>
<p>What would this do? And have you been tracking the situation? Because it does seem there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some truth to it. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s important to just take a step back and kind of look at this</p>
<p>thing with not like complete skepticism, but just a little skepticism. It&rsquo;s not surprising that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s additional deposits all around the world. Meaning we&rsquo;ve always said rare earths are not</p>
<p>particularly that rare. It&rsquo;s just the question is, you know, which of the 17 rare earth elements</p>
<p>at what grade meaning at what percent concentration does it exist? And then really</p>
<p>importantly, at what cost to extract it economically? Yeah, right. So meaning there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a ton of underdeveloped rare earth assets in Canada, the US, Africa, Australia, Brazil,</p>
<p>Brazil, they&rsquo;re just under under developed, because when you put all of these factors together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tough. So the government release says they&rsquo;re going to process like 570,000 tons of ore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll produce around 10,000 kilotons per year of rare earths. That implies sort of a 1.75 to 2%</p>
<p>grade, it&rsquo;s fine. So there&rsquo;s just a lot more work, I would just sort of say it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>directionally great, a lot more work needs to be done. And more importantly, they need to release</p>
<p>enough of this detail. So folks like us and others can actually diligence it to tell you</p>
<p>more accurately, but the press release was exciting. Freeberg, this reminds me a little</p>
<p>bit of the peak oil head fake we had, you know, 15 years ago, everybody basically said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to find more oil. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left of oil. And then Norway is like, yeah,</p>
<p>we just found more oil than existed previously, and it&rsquo;s been pulled out. And the whole concept</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s going to run out of oil is now gone. So freeberg, what is happening in science,</p>
<p>that we just can&rsquo;t predict what resources are available,</p>
<p>we know very little about what&rsquo;s inside the below the certain depth of the crust of the earth. So</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s some estimates, but we&rsquo;re always surprised. And we know very little about</p>
<p>the distribution of those elements in the crust of the earth and below the crust of the earth.</p>
<p>You know, mining&rsquo;s an incredible industry, I don&rsquo;t know, the state of the art in engineering</p>
<p>and mining very well. But, you know, from a pure geophysics point of view, by some estimates,</p>
<p>we have 10 billion years of energy reserves below the crust of the earth that we can access in the</p>
<p>form of nuclear reserves, geothermal power. And that&rsquo;s excluding, you know, some of the,</p>
<p>you know, the potential of some of these elements and what they can do</p>
<p>in building a more sustainable energy economy. Why is people so pessimistic when we keep</p>
<p>surprising ourselves with more resources? Anyone wants a great book? None of you guys were at the</p>
<p>dinner that I did a few weeks ago, where we had Steven Pinker come for dinner. Yeah, read his</p>
<p>book enlightenment now. I could watch one of his videos on YouTube where he&rsquo;s got like all 60</p>
<p>slides. And he highlights like, you know, humans have a tendency to focus on the risks and the</p>
<p>concerns and the downsides. And we miss the incredible optimism that is apparent as we</p>
<p>actually look at the data of what&rsquo;s happening with our species and what we&rsquo;re doing on our planet.</p>
<p>We have every reason to be optimistic. You know, we have fewer wars than we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Murder rate per capita is lowest than it ever been. longevity is increasing, health is increasing,</p>
<p>per capita, everything&rsquo;s increasing. And I think that the same is true in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, scientific breakthroughs, discovery and engineering our way</p>
<p>to a more sustainable energy and food future. This is one of the great things about having you</p>
<p>as a friend, Friedberg is your relentless optimism and your actual cool, calm, collective lack of</p>
<p>anxiety. In other amazing news, the EU Parliament has flipped again, credit Thurmberg is completely</p>
<p>tilted. We talked about the virtue signaling EU Parliament, you know, and Germany turning off</p>
<p>their nuclear power plants and just securing the bag for Putin, the EU Parliament flipped,</p>
<p>and they are now saying these virtue signaling knuckleheads, they came to the census, and now</p>
<p>they believe nuclear is green. Also green, according to the EU Parliament, is natural gas.</p>
<p>So this to me feels like the beginning of the end for Putin and Saudi Arabia. If you look at</p>
<p>the US becoming a net exporter of energy, it&rsquo;s quite possible the EU could become that as well,</p>
<p>if they actually, and this is a big F if they actually, you know, start building nuclear,</p>
<p>it could be the beginning of the end of what some people are calling the woke green movement.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly over this realization, that to transition to the next car to the beyond the</p>
<p>carbon economy is going to require continuing to invest in and support the carbon economy</p>
<p>until those alternative solutions emerge, and to have dual track investing. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing around the world in the United States in Europe now. And Europe has always been</p>
<p>farther way farther left than the United States in taking this point of view. And I think now this</p>
<p>this has been a wake up call for everyone. And all it took was just a little bit of $6 gasoline</p>
<p>and for people to personally suffer for them to change their virtue signaling nonsense.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is this is markets at work. Yeah, this is educating the public,</p>
<p>would you rather be beholden to Putin, they pivoted because we&rsquo;d rather have nukes,</p>
<p>they pivoted from banning energy production to banning food production.</p>
<p>She talked about the Netherlands, we&rsquo;re about to get there. We&rsquo;re about to get well.</p>
<p>So on the energy side, I did a in the group chat, just a little breakdown on the math,</p>
<p>I think it may be interesting for people to understand. But today, globally around the world,</p>
<p>every single country in the world that is involved in the oil business,</p>
<p>is able to produce exactly 1 million more barrels per day than we need. So let&rsquo;s assume that we,</p>
<p>you know, need 100 million barrels of oil a day as a as a as a world to continue to do everything</p>
<p>we want to do. We produce 101 million. So we&rsquo;re right on the knife&rsquo;s edge. By August,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go through a capacity increase in OPEC plus, which is, you know, OPEC plus Russia,</p>
<p>etc. Saudi Arabia is going to go from 10 million barrels a day to 11 million barrels,</p>
<p>so not a huge increase. Russia has is is thought to be able to cut production if they feel pressure</p>
<p>up to 5 million barrels a day without having any impact to their economy. So JP Morgan,</p>
<p>I think and Credit Suisse, they did this sensitivity analysis. And here&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>found. They found that if Russia were to cut 3 million barrels of oil, so we would go from being</p>
<p>oversupplied by 1 million to undersupplied by two, the price of oil would go to about $180 a barrel.</p>
<p>If they cut 5 million, so the threshold at which their economy doesn&rsquo;t really get that impacted,</p>
<p>the price of oil could go as high as $380 a barrel. While you would say, okay, well,</p>
<p>we just need to pump more oil from other places. And this is the problem in all of these rules</p>
<p>that have existed for so long. The capacity doesn&rsquo;t exist, right? We were destroying supply.</p>
<p>Governments all around the world were making it very difficult to generate the supply of nuclear</p>
<p>to generate the supply of oil and to generate the supply of nat gas. So Saudi Arabia says we</p>
<p>can get to 12 million. Well, guess what, they can only start the work in 2024. They&rsquo;ll be done in</p>
<ol start="2027">
<li>Yeah. So to your point, all of a sudden, we realized, wait, we needed these bridge fuels</li>
</ol>
<p>all along. Yeah, how do we allow all of this supply destruction to happen? And now we need</p>
<p>to unwind it, it&rsquo;s going to be a very complicated process. And if any of these things happen,</p>
<p>if Russia decides to play hardball against Europe or America, we better hope that it&rsquo;s a mild winter</p>
<p>because very quickly, you can go from plus 1 million barrels to minus two in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Yeah. And America started and the last point on this Saudi Arabia, you&rsquo;d say, okay, well,</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is going to go from 10 to 11. So that&rsquo;s good. They have been at 11 million for</p>
<p>some total of eight weeks in their entire lifetime. If we look at this, I mean, Americans</p>
<p>also buying 20 to 25 mile per gallon cars, that&rsquo;s got to end to and so personal responsibility</p>
<p>is part of this. The really interesting thing is China already has this plan. Their nuclear</p>
<p>strategy with the belt and road initiative is to put 30 nuclear reactors in countries outside of</p>
<p>China that they&rsquo;re trying to have influence in. And they&rsquo;re building 30 nukes right now they got</p>
<p>150 planned. So China&rsquo;s just ultimately savvy and thinking big here about energy independence,</p>
<p>and we need to follow them. Other big anybody have anything else on the energy situation?</p>
<p>Before we go to the farming situation? Let&rsquo;s get to the farming situation.</p>
<p>Okay, so Dutch farmers are in revolt. After a new proposed law to cut emissions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Dutch lawmakers voted on proposals to slash emissions of pollutants</p>
<p>like nitrogen oxide and ammonia. They&rsquo;re targeting a 50% cut nationwide by 2030.</p>
<p>Livestock produces these emissions. So the plan will likely force Dutch farmers to cut their</p>
<p>livestock herds or stop working altogether. Farmers protested. They put their tractors</p>
<p>outside buildings, they dump fertilizer. 40,000 farmers gathered last week in the</p>
<p>Central Netherlands agricultural heartland to protest these plans.</p>
<p>And it started shooting at them.</p>
<p>These tractors were doing some pretty gnarly things and stopping traffic and</p>
<p>and there were shots were fired.</p>
<p>Were they? No. Wait, the government there were shots. The protesters were unarmed.</p>
<p>As far as they were unarmed, but supposedly they were doing some</p>
<p>dangerous maneuvers.</p>
<p>Were they honking their horns? Is that why?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. I think they were using it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK for the police to shoot working class protesters if they&rsquo;re honking their horns.</p>
<p>I think they were threatening the safety of&hellip; This is the other side of the story, Saks.</p>
<p>Listen, neither of us were there, but according to the sources,</p>
<p>they were using the tractors to threaten the police, like physical bodily harm.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they unloaded. We don&rsquo;t know all the details. It&rsquo;ll come out, but&hellip;</p>
<p>That sounds proportionate.</p>
<p>I mean, if you had a tractor coming at you to kill you and you&rsquo;re a police officer,</p>
<p>I think it is proportionate to unload.</p>
<p>OK, so let&rsquo;s talk about the science of it. Science. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Wait, is it like the scene in Austin Powers where there&rsquo;s a steamroller coming towards Austin?</p>
<p>I was just thinking about that.</p>
<p>Exactly. I was just thinking about that.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s like, oh, they&rsquo;re using the tractor as a weapon. It&rsquo;s like, really?</p>
<p>Just, I&rsquo;m, I was, you were not there. I was not there. I&rsquo;m just telling you what was reported.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reporting what&rsquo;s reported. And nobody knows if those reports are true.</p>
<p>So I think, look, I think it&rsquo;s worth just highlighting because this is a really important,</p>
<p>this is the first time we&rsquo;ve seen government action of this scale and the resulting kind of</p>
<p>rebound effect on something that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Humans use roughly between two and 6% of our energy on Earth every year to make ammonia.</p>
<p>Ammonia is the primary fertilizer we use to fertilize our crops around the world.</p>
<p>And if not for the invention of the Haber-Bosch process,</p>
<p>which you can read about in the book, The Alchemy of Air,</p>
<p>and the creation of ammonia as a synthetic fertilizer,</p>
<p>humans would all have starved in the mid 20th century. It&rsquo;s an incredible technology breakthrough.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve learned over the years, however, is that when ammonia sits on the ground</p>
<p>for too long, it volatilizes and it basically binds with oxygen and turns into nitrous oxide</p>
<p>and goes into the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide is 300 times more potent as a greenhouse gas</p>
<p>than CO2. It lasts longer, and it absorbs more heat. So there has long been concern about the</p>
<p>overuse of fertilizer and the overproduction of ammonia that just sits on the ground for too long</p>
<p>that ultimately creates this incredible greenhouse gas effect.</p>
<p>And so there has been talk in the United States under the Obama administration under multiple</p>
<p>EPAs. There was a Supreme Court ruling a few weeks ago that started to touch on whether or</p>
<p>not the EPA has regulatory authority here to actually regulate the use of ammonia.</p>
<p>Farmers generally put a lot of ammonia on the ground because they get higher yields out of</p>
<p>their crop. The problem is if that ammonia sits there for too long, it turns into a greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>And so regulating ammonia and regulating this nitrous oxide emission has been,</p>
<p>you know, at the forefront of green, the green movement at the forefront of climate change as</p>
<p>one of the ways to manage and reduce the effects of global warming from human industry. And now,</p>
<p>you know, the Dutch government has come out and started to do some of this regulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit off because it comes from cows. And we&rsquo;re seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Chamath Freebrook, can we finally admit that it&rsquo;s the vegans fault now?</p>
<p>Well, at this point, actually, you know,</p>
<p>is that a yes? No, no, the ammonia production in the Netherlands is from I mean, it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>the Netherlands. Just so you guys know, the Netherlands is the world is the world&rsquo;s third</p>
<p>largest dairy exporter. They export $3 billion a year of dairy of milk to the rest of the world</p>
<p>to other countries. And so they have all these cows that are like densely packed and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>peeing everywhere. And that P is ammonia. And it&rsquo;s causing all of this problems. The other</p>
<p>problem with ammonia. So if you guys look at the United States, corn farmers farm in the Midwest,</p>
<p>when it rains, the ammonia on their fields goes into the streams goes into the Mississippi River</p>
<p>and goes into the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, there is a massive hypoxic zone,</p>
<p>there are no fish, they&rsquo;re all dead. Because when ammonia ends up in the water, it kills life.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this green algae and no fish and everything dies. And so that&rsquo;s what the Dutch are</p>
<p>trying to regulate. And the EU generally has been trying to regulate is the removal of excess</p>
<p>ammonia in ag production and in right, but I again, I still hear though, that if if we ate</p>
<p>less vegetables, this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Not correct. Not correct. Most of the production of</p>
<p>ammonia is used to make animal feed, which is used to feed animals to make beef, which is a</p>
<p>terrible decision. You could feed it olives, as we know, olives taste delicious, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the issue here that is the issue here that the regulators hit the brakes too hard on</p>
<p>these farmers, and they should have maybe had a more gradual landing for them is it&rsquo;s been talked</p>
<p>about for a long time. And in the US, there&rsquo;s just no way a law is going to pass because the US Senate</p>
<p>is controlled primarily by rural states, which are ag heavy. So you see a lot of you don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>a lot of bills that hurt farmers get passed in the United States. Because the Senate is controlled by</p>
<p>farmers that are elected, sorry, senators that are elected by farmer by big farming communities</p>
<p>and farming states. And so, you know, it&rsquo;s been hard to get a regulation like this past,</p>
<p>where folks have tried to and talked about doing it around the world, however, in a place like the</p>
<p>Netherlands and the EU, or as I mentioned before, they&rsquo;re far more progressive, and have this very</p>
<p>kind of green hat on, they&rsquo;re starting to take this sort of climate change action, as they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling it, and that climate change action, you know, does have the ramifications of destroying,</p>
<p>by the way, one of the things they said, is we expect, and this will destroy the livelihoods of</p>
<p>many dairy farmers in the Netherlands. That was horrible. By the way, look, all kidding aside,</p>
<p>they said that directly, by the way, and the dairy farmers are like, F you, you&rsquo;re not destroying our</p>
<p>business for climate change. I have a specific question, though, which is has there not been</p>
<p>some efforts to engineer how these plants themselves absorb nitrogen? That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Come on, I have three businesses. That&rsquo;s totally right. Technology is going to solve this problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super optimistic on that. There are microbes that are being used to coat seed. Those microbes</p>
<p>can pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere directly. So you don&rsquo;t need ammonia. You use far less</p>
<p>ammonia. There&rsquo;s a couple companies that are doing this really effectively. They&rsquo;re growing like</p>
<p>crazy. They&rsquo;re doing really well. There are other projects. And there&rsquo;s very simple solutions. My</p>
<p>last company, we had a product called nitrogen advisor, where we basically told farmers instead</p>
<p>of dumping all the fertilizer at the start of the season, you pace it out. So the fertilizer doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sit there and volatilize. There&rsquo;s all these solutions that technology allows from software</p>
<p>to bioengineering to these microbial solutions. And so we&rsquo;re definitely, I think going to resolve this.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, these governments are in a frenzy to solve the climate change problem. And you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to start to pass these laws that really hurt the livelihoods of, you know, ag</p>
<p>producers. How do you guys think something like this happens? Because typically, you would expect</p>
<p>when a government is about to pass something like this. There&rsquo;s sort of like a pretty fulsome review</p>
<p>and all sides are brought together. And there&rsquo;s working groups and all of this stuff. And at some</p>
<p>point, you would talk to some scientists at other points, you would talk to economists. At other</p>
<p>points, you talk to the people who&rsquo;d be directly affected like the farmers. Is it that the virtue</p>
<p>signaling around sustainability and climate change is just so high, that people just turn off their</p>
<p>brains? Or like what is actually happening here? I think what&rsquo;s going on is you got a bunch of</p>
<p>technocratic bureaucrats in Brussels, who don&rsquo;t know anything about farming, or these people who</p>
<p>live in the Netherlands, who&rsquo;ve been doing this for generations. And they sit there in Brussels,</p>
<p>and they make up these completely arbitrary guidelines and requirements. 50% by 2030,</p>
<p>those are suspiciously round numbers, okay. And then some other, you know, authoritarian technocrat</p>
<p>in the Netherlands then says, well, we got to implement this and they pass some crazy law.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t even think about the impact on these farmers. Why? Because they&rsquo;re deplorables.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s complete class bias. It&rsquo;s just like the Canadian truckers. They don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>these people. They don&rsquo;t factor into their equation. They don&rsquo;t know how they live. And so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here. And so you&rsquo;ve got this global elite of technocrats who are willing to use</p>
<p>authoritarian tactics. They&rsquo;re appropriating their farms are taking them away. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>in arms. See the rest of it, which you&rsquo;re not saying it&rsquo;s not just technocrats. It&rsquo;s the actual</p>
<p>global elite writ large, have wrapped themselves around the sustainability blanket. And they</p>
<p>believe that that word justifies all kinds of bad, unscientific, innumerate policies.</p>
<p>Right. And by the way, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve just woken up on energy, right? They had just banned energy</p>
<p>production in Europe, they realize, oh, wait a second, this is making us dependent on Russian</p>
<p>authoritarians. Well, what is the other big export of Ukraine? It&rsquo;s food. So they got smart on energy.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re about to repeat their same dumb mistake of basically prohibiting this area where</p>
<p>they have an enormous natural advantage, which is food production. So, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they just keep making the same mistake over and over again. And by the way, let me ask you a</p>
<p>question, by the way, yeah, look, I&rsquo;m not going to question you on the science free bird. But here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would say is, I think there&rsquo;s a tendency on the part of these technocrats to think that</p>
<p>the science is a lot more bulletproof than it actually is. That is certainly what we saw with</p>
<p>COVID is we had these same sort of global elitists, these technocrats who claim to be</p>
<p>health experts, they made up all these lockdown rules that we talked about the beginning of the</p>
<p>show. No, this isn&rsquo;t speculative, but I will agree with you. They&rsquo;re willing to use heavy</p>
<p>handed authoritarian tactics. And I just don&rsquo;t believe that the science of this, especially this</p>
<p>50% by 2030, why is that the guideline who can prove that those are the exact right numbers,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re willing to use any tactics necessary to implement their crazy rules?</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question, sex, let&rsquo;s assume that there&rsquo;s a technology transition possible,</p>
<p>that there are solutions that could be used, I highlighted a few of them,</p>
<p>they just cost money, they require some investment. And, you know, creating this</p>
<p>distortion in the market by saying you can&rsquo;t release 50% of the ammonia that you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>releasing forces a technological shift that otherwise would have taken longer in the market.</p>
<p>Do you agree that there may be a scenario here whereby, you know, governments can and should</p>
<p>intervene? And I&rsquo;m not making the case personally, I&rsquo;m just trying to, you know, highlight for you</p>
<p>that I think this is where folks are coming from. There are alternative ways to make the dairy,</p>
<p>there are alternative ways to feed the cows. There are, you know, well, here&rsquo;s where I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going with that, which could make sense, which is okay, you&rsquo;re saying there is a pollution</p>
<p>externality here being created by the farmers. Well, exactly to basically internalize the</p>
<p>externality, we need to capture the cost of that. So what you could do is gradually introduce some</p>
<p>sort of permit system, you know, or tradable permit system, right, where that would incentivize the</p>
<p>creation of these technologies that you&rsquo;re talking about, you want to do it gradually,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t destroy the livelihoods of these farmers who&rsquo;ve been doing it for generations. So</p>
<p>that would probably be the approach you&rsquo;d want to take.</p>
<p>I agree. By the way, I think that I think that is what is going to happen around the world</p>
<p>is that that sort of cap and trade or taxation system is going to get slowly rolled out.</p>
<p>For a lot of these externality costs in production and industry and agriculture,</p>
<p>particularly, because there are technological alternatives, and it will incentivize the</p>
<p>switch to those alternatives, because the alternatives will cost less than the taxes</p>
<p>sacks, based on what you&rsquo;re saying is one of the problems here that these technocrats,</p>
<p>these professional politicians, they don&rsquo;t actually have great strategic, thoughtful,</p>
<p>you know, real world experience to do planning, you know, looking at Germany, their inability to see</p>
<p>the writing on the wall of what building a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and shutting</p>
<p>down nukes would do. It just seems like over and over, they&rsquo;re just really bad strategic thinkers.</p>
<p>Combined with this, I think you&rsquo;re wrong. No, Jason, they are influenced by these cultural</p>
<p>elites who they want to group think it&rsquo;s a lot of groups. Yeah, behind the group think is a class</p>
<p>bias, right? They only associate with other members of the professional class who have,</p>
<p>you know, basically graduate degrees. They don&rsquo;t even interact with these farmers, just like the</p>
<p>legislators making COVID rules, the health experts never interact with Canadian truckers. So,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge amount of class prejudice, saying that these people just don&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>we can force them to obey our rules. And if they don&rsquo;t like it, we&rsquo;ll confiscate</p>
<p>their farms. And by the way, the rest of you, you&rsquo;re gonna have to learn to eat bugs,</p>
<p>or tofu, or tempeh, or recycled excrement, or whatever. How was the DeSantis? What was your</p>
<p>DeSantis? Was the DeSantis prosciutto? What did you have on there? Was it some mozzarella?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful roast beef. Beautiful roast beef by DeSantis.</p>
<p>Brought to you by DeSantis. It&rsquo;s gonna become a meme after this episode. I had prosciutto cotto.</p>
<p>Is the best market campaign ever. He&rsquo;s a lock for president.</p>
<p>Jake, I had prosciutto cotto with brie, white truffle cream and lemon.</p>
<p>Did you have the white truffle on it? That&rsquo;s like a plus, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Bro, this is eight euros. No, it&rsquo;s like eight euros.</p>
<p>Eight euros? Bring some back. Wait, I want to say something about this.</p>
<p>I hope the Democrats embrace this agenda wholeheartedly, because if we get all the</p>
<p>voters who want to eat roast beef, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s a super majority in this country.</p>
<p>The way to solve this, Freeberg, is with the right economic incentives. There&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>why the Dutch government had to go and basically put thousands of farmers out of business. Instead,</p>
<p>what they could have done is actually created the tax incentive that allowed farmers to adopt</p>
<p>some of these bleeding edge technologies when they were probably too expensive</p>
<p>to make it economically equivalent. I mean, by the way, that is not a newfangled idea.</p>
<p>This is not genius talk here. So the reason why they don&rsquo;t do the obvious simple thing</p>
<p>is class bias. It is exactly what David said. It is the influence of people who look down on</p>
<p>these people. Yeah. Okay. And who believe that they are more virtuous because of their desire</p>
<p>to defend climate change. There&rsquo;s also a pragmatic piece of this. This reminds me of the coal debates</p>
<p>we had. There are 62,000 coal miners in this country. Like, this is a small number of people</p>
<p>who were impacted, we could just, you know, basically give them severance or a soft landing</p>
<p>instead of the, you know, this crazy or, or let them continue to do their job and egress off</p>
<p>naturally, the economic free market will manage it will manage it on its own. And instead, what</p>
<p>you could do is actually green light nuclear subsidize some of these more adventurous ways</p>
<p>in which you can extract and refine LNG. But my point is, this is where it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a real head</p>
<p>scratcher why politicians don&rsquo;t do this. And I think the only thing that I can come up with is</p>
<p>that they are overly influenced by these cultural elites with their perspectives, I agree that do</p>
<p>judge very harshly what they believe to be right and what they believe to be wrong.</p>
<p>Can we take a victory lap here in the United States that were energy independent, and that</p>
<p>were food independent? Can we take that victory? How much longer Jason? No, well, I think we now</p>
<p>need to think instead of just being independent, I think our mission should be surplus Jason,</p>
<p>our president, you know, cancel the Keystone Pipeline. He canceled a bunch of exploration</p>
<p>permits in the Gulf. You know, again, it&rsquo;s we are one bad winter away from all of a sudden being in</p>
<p>the same situation as everybody else. So it&rsquo;s not as one bad. We&rsquo;re not one freeberg. Where are we</p>
<p>in terms of our independence? Jake, we are the number one ag exporter in the world. And by the</p>
<p>way, under a different under a different president, just a couple of years ago, we were the number</p>
<p>one energy exporter in the world. The fact that we take a food and energy, we have the greatest</p>
<p>natural resources. And we should be developing that we should be moving. But no sex. My point</p>
<p>is, what if the United States took a philosophy of not just being an independent, but being even</p>
<p>like a stronger surplus to the point of like, you know, the market? We are, we&rsquo;re working it out,</p>
<p>the market&rsquo;s working it out. And we&rsquo;re taking, you know, we&rsquo;re, we just need to feel like we</p>
<p>could do better. It feels like we do. I mean, the issue with nuclear power, as you know,</p>
<p>is the regulatory cost. So you know, it&rsquo;s $10 billion in 30 years to get it. Let&rsquo;s move to</p>
<p>the lightning round. No, I just want to show you guys the Monmouth poll, which I think is worth</p>
<p>highlighting. Okay, we didn&rsquo;t talk about it. But the Monmouth poll that was published a few days</p>
<p>ago, which is the June 2022 poll, the number one concern that America, the number one thing</p>
<p>Americans are concerned about, Nick, you could put the chart, the table in the in the show notes,</p>
<p>33% care about inflation 2015% care about gas prices, 9% care about the economy 6% care about</p>
<p>everyday bills and groceries. You know, you add that up. That&rsquo;s the vast majority of what people</p>
<p>are concerned about. And all the way down at the bottom of the table is climate change at 1%.</p>
<p>Absolutely. So I think it just speaks to the point about, you know, there there is,</p>
<p>and by the way, I&rsquo;m not advocating that this is the right position. But I will say that there</p>
<p>is a huge distinction or discrepancy between what the average American is worried about.</p>
<p>And you know, where political leaders are trying to carry us forward. I&rsquo;m not sure what the right</p>
<p>answer is. But there&rsquo;s definitely a disconnect. And I think it&rsquo;s being played out in this</p>
<p>Netherlands situation right now. One point for you on that as well. Nick, I put this article in the</p>
<p>in the chat, but the top ESG fund manager in Europe of the of 2022, they released their</p>
<p>results, and the guy was up like almost 16%. And he disclosed what he owns. And it turns out that</p>
<p>he owns Conoco, Valero, and Exxon. And according to the ESG rules that these folks have passed,</p>
<p>this qualifies as an ESG fund because he doesn&rsquo;t own weapons, porn and oil sands.</p>
<p>But it allows all these people to walk around thinking that their investments are tied up in</p>
<p>things that are actually clean. So it&rsquo;s not true. So the point is that there are there are</p>
<p>these structural lies that have been baked into the system, that they are supported by very shoddy</p>
<p>accounting or rules or science. And if we&rsquo;re really going to fix this problem, I think you</p>
<p>have to go and inspect these things and call them out. But like all of this ESG investing,</p>
<p>which perpetuates, by the way, perhaps, you know why these governments just have no clue what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on, sit on top of all of these lies. There&rsquo;s nothing ESG about Conoco and Exxon per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous. Let&rsquo;s just call it for what it is. This guy&rsquo;s a good fund manager. It&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good fund manager. He did well in a period where everybody else was down. Let&rsquo;s just celebrate that</p>
<p>and not tell all these had a good marketing spin for a while. So you know, but it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>marketing. It allows people to believe that there&rsquo;s a solution that is being affected. That</p>
<p>is not true. That&rsquo;s the part about it. That is super nefarious. Yeah. Okay. Listen, we move</p>
<p>science up because science got a short shrift last week. What is a lightning round? What is that?</p>
<p>I just wanted to things that were small that weren&rsquo;t like full segments. I my concept here</p>
<p>was to just put things at the end of the show that we missed. But what I did this time was</p>
<p>give you a shout out. You&rsquo;re doing a great job moderating today, by the way. Thank you put a</p>
<p>couple extra hours. And by the way, I think Freeberg made a really interesting point a</p>
<p>minute ago about me being a great moderator. No, not that. Okay. About the about the polling,</p>
<p>the mammoth polling, where if you look at what voters care about, and what the elites,</p>
<p>and the elected politicians care about, there&rsquo;s a huge divergence. That&rsquo;s clearly what happened</p>
<p>in Holland, right? You got these Dutch farmers, their livelihoods are being taken away by people</p>
<p>in Brussels who don&rsquo;t even understand what they do. I mean, people want to make a living.</p>
<p>Yeah. But but this is why you&rsquo;re seeing populist nationalist uprisings in all these countries is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a crowd of people who go to Davos and make policy and they&rsquo;re completely disconnected.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely disconnected from the real concern. Look at Bojo electorate.</p>
<p>Bojo just got booted today. Why? Ultimately, at the root causes he was throwing COVID parties</p>
<p>when he was telling the same thing that everybody nailed Gavin Newsom for this guy just got booted</p>
<p>out as Prime Minister better than everybody. They&rsquo;re hypocrites, and they&rsquo;re incompetent</p>
<p>at their jobs. Let&rsquo;s call it what it is. The association is you try and do what you</p>
<p>believe to be best for everyone. But it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s best for you. You know,</p>
<p>and I think that that&rsquo;s the point like climate, fixing climate change, stopping COVID. I got to</p>
<p>do X, Y and Z for everyone, but I still want to fly in a private jet and I still want to go to a</p>
<p>COVID party, you know, to a dinner party. Exactly. A super spreader. This is why I think Biden is</p>
<p>very unpopular. I mean, look, he&rsquo;s hold on, hold on, let me see. Okay, so we&rsquo;re gonna tee up.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me just explain it. It&rsquo;s a lot easier if I do that. Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on. Here comes the alley oop. I don&rsquo;t need the alley oop. Let me do two sentences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two sentences. I have a good joke. Just let me do it. All right. So all of the Friedberg</p>
<p>stands were breaking my chops that Chamath was cackling and laughing during a science</p>
<p>segment and we rushed him. So I moved science up. So to the Friedberg stands, please stand down.</p>
<p>Now we go to Biden derangement syndrome segment. At the end of the show,</p>
<p>Joe Biden&rsquo;s cognitive decline is becoming the topic. Sachs, have at it.</p>
<p>Well, listen, if if you call this Biden derangement syndrome, 62% of the country has</p>
<p>Biden derangement syndrome because we all did for Trump. Biden&rsquo;s poll numbers are down to something</p>
<p>like 38%. It&rsquo;s historic low for this point in time of a presidency. But look, what the point</p>
<p>I was trying to make was I think that Biden&rsquo;s problems flow from this dynamic we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about, which is he campaigned as Scranton Joe. He was a working class hero who is going to give</p>
<p>us a return to normalcy. And what has he done? He&rsquo;s basically implemented every wacky idea of</p>
<p>the progressive left. He basically is representing that part of the party that is completely</p>
<p>disconnected from the ordinary desires of the working class. And what are people concerned</p>
<p>about right now? Food and energy prices. What is Biden concerned? Well, first of all, he&rsquo;s blaming</p>
<p>it on mom and pop gas stations. Even even Jeff Bezos had to that tweet was insane.</p>
<p>Yeah. So just to keep the tweet, my message is Biden&rsquo;s tweet, my message to the companies running</p>
<p>gas stations and selling and setting prices at the pump is simple. This is a time of war and</p>
<p>global peril. Bring down the price price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying for the product and do it now. And then almost all small business franchises, which is</p>
<p>absurd. And that&rsquo;s just not how the economy works. Do you think that they look at a Chevron</p>
<p>and think it&rsquo;s owned by Chevron? Are they cannot be who&rsquo;s tweeting for some some millennial,</p>
<p>some millennial with a couple of master&rsquo;s degrees? Oh, and 400,000 of debt is rage tweeting from</p>
<p>the White House to make him look incompetent. I mean, I am forever thankful for Joe Biden to</p>
<p>getting Trump out before he took a third or fourth. It would take an eight second Google</p>
<p>search to know that less than 10% of the gas stations in America are owned by these corporates.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s base us as quick. These are mom and pop businesses. This is insanity.</p>
<p>A lot of immigrants, a lot of South Asians. This is why it&rsquo;s very sensitive to me.</p>
<p>These gas stations, they are mom and pop owned. A lot of them are owned by immigrants. And this</p>
<p>is their small, very expensive, the American dream. And Biden comes along and he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing too well. I mean, these people, their profit margins, like 2%, 2%, 2%, nothing.</p>
<p>My buddy&rsquo;s family, by the way, owns a bunch of gas stations in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And he told me they make no money on gas. They make all their money selling cigarettes and soda.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the whole business. It&rsquo;s a way to get people into a convenience store.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my thought. I think I&rsquo;m going to state it right here. Bezos is going to run for president</p>
<p>in 2024. This is why he retired. What? This is why he&rsquo;s giving money away. I will bet anything</p>
<p>against them. Okay. He doesn&rsquo;t need the headache. 15 to one. Okay. Well, he&rsquo;s playing legacy games.</p>
<p>No. Why else would he become a shit poster on Twitter? Ouch. Inflation is far too. That wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even a shit post. Well, anyway, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he doesn&rsquo;t have to run a company anymore.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Bezos after dark. That wasn&rsquo;t even a shit post. That was kind of like he was outraged by</p>
<p>the financial illiteracy, the sheer stupidity. And, you know, what is what is the lack of</p>
<p>economic understanding to take on the president? There&rsquo;s no upside there. He&rsquo;s not starting a</p>
<p>fight. Check out. It&rsquo;s just calling out something that on its face, that tweet.</p>
<p>It was not written by Joe Biden. So let&rsquo;s not pin the blame on him.</p>
<p>But that office and that strategy is clearly broken because it is run by someone at a minimum</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s enumerate, and who&rsquo;s clearly financially illiterate, who doesn&rsquo;t know how to Google</p>
<p>anything. Because that&rsquo;s the only way you could write something that insipid Biden should fire</p>
<p>whoever it is that wrote that 100% Biden is looking for scapegoats. Okay, his popularity</p>
<p>is at historic lows that the right track wrong track numbers are at historic lows. He&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>for anyone to blame. And he&rsquo;s been going through a whole sequence. And the Putin price hike wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working. He couldn&rsquo;t even say it right. So now they&rsquo;re looking for anyone else. Remember,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren did something similar when they had food inflation, they started blaming the meat,</p>
<p>the meatpacking industry or whatever. Look, this is not how these industries work. But they are</p>
<p>looking for someone to blame for their own mismanagement of the economy. And Biden baked</p>
<p>this cake last year. We&rsquo;ve discussed this before. He canceled energy independence, his first day in</p>
<p>office. And then moreover, look on this Ukraine situation, if you knew you were going to take</p>
<p>this tough with Putin approach, Jason, I know you support Okay, but if you knew a proxy war was</p>
<p>coming, or you&rsquo;re willing to let one happen, you would want to basically create an energy glut,</p>
<p>not an energy shortage, you&rsquo;d want to basically maximize the amount of American production,</p>
<p>and you would not want to alienate the Saudis. So what is Biden doing now? He&rsquo;s going over Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia had in hand totally humiliating to beg for forgiveness for last year ostracizing them</p>
<p>and calling them pariahs. So no, hold on a second, they had no grand strategy.</p>
<p>If they wanted to pursue a tough on Russia strategy, they should have maximized energy</p>
<p>production. Instead, they didn&rsquo;t even think about it. They didn&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>Strategically, we&rsquo;ve got energy inflation.</p>
<p>I agree with you there. It also I will say is notable. I think the democrats are actually now</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re quietly pushing the Joe Biden cognitive decline so that they can put it they</p>
<p>can feel that what do you mean quietly? How do you allow a governor, a sitting governor to run</p>
<p>ads in a different state against the presumed Republican nominee unless it&rsquo;s ordained?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying the cognitive decline thing. I think they&rsquo;re not going to come out and say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is happening surreptitiously.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the tweet from Bezos, just so people hear it. Ouch, inflation is far too</p>
<p>important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this. It&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>straight ahead misdirection, or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics.</p>
<p>This is a very strong statement. And the point I was trying to make before</p>
<p>is, why would Bezos? Why would Bezos at this time? Why would he take on the administration?</p>
<p>I would think it&rsquo;s important for Biden to take control of his communication strategy and to</p>
<p>reclaim more of the center going into the midterms. I think a lot of this content, the naming the</p>
<p>shaming the blaming tends to be more of the playbook from the far progressive left. And I</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s probably too many people that have infiltrated the White House from those ranks.</p>
<p>And I think he needs to close ranks a little bit more. And so I don&rsquo;t think he wrote this,</p>
<p>okay. And I don&rsquo;t think he would have wrote it if he was given a chance. So it&rsquo;s clearly something</p>
<p>is breaking between what is being discussed as a team and then what is being executed on the ground.</p>
<p>sex.</p>
<p>Look, Biden&rsquo;s staff, the wrong claims been with him for years, they reflect his desires. I think</p>
<p>this is classic Biden. If you look at his career in the Senate, he is a grandstander. He always</p>
<p>liked to basically scapegoat and demonize. This is a playbook. He may not have written the tweet,</p>
<p>but he certainly endorsed it. And he&rsquo;s given speeches now where he&rsquo;s calling out this scapegoat</p>
<p>and that scapegoat for basically the energy prices, which are totally his fault. He could</p>
<p>have had a better strategy around this.</p>
<p>DeSantis versus Bezos, you heard it first.</p>
<p>On the Bezos thing, hold on a second. Jason, you&rsquo;re not taking into account,</p>
<p>this is actually the second time that Bezos has tweeted about inflation.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t taken that into account, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. That was back in May. He called out the administration. So it&rsquo;s on this particular issue,</p>
<p>I think he feels strongly about this issue. And I think he&rsquo;s looking at what the administration</p>
<p>is doing and just saying, this is a level of political stupidity and financial illiteracy</p>
<p>that I just cannot stand. And by the way, who is Jeff Bezos? Bezos is a very liberal guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an outspoken critic of Trump and he owns a very liberal media house at the Washington Post.</p>
<p>So I think this is a reflection that Biden has even lost the Jeff Bezos of the world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s trying to spend it as a good thing as if we don&rsquo;t need these billionaires. But</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re losing Jeff Bezos, you&rsquo;re losing a lot of people in the center, probably the entire</p>
<p>I would follow the breadcrumbs. He bought the Washington Post, he bought the largest house in</p>
<p>DC. And now he&rsquo;s taking on the administration. I think it&rsquo;s a clear path that he wants to run.</p>
<p>You can, you can, you can mention me on Twitter if you disagree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you a funny story to end. After after the sale of the Warriors completed,</p>
<p>and I tweeted this thing out. It was really beautiful. Dray sent a beautiful text to me.</p>
<p>So did David Lee. And then I got one text message from Phil Hellmuth saying,</p>
<p>I dispute how much credit you&rsquo;ve given me. I expected more.</p>
<p>Wow. So seven seconds to fill again, it only took seven seconds. And then he called</p>
<p>and then he called I showed I showed sacks the text, right? It&rsquo;s an unbelievable text, right?</p>
<p>sacks can sacks can testify to it. And then he lost his mind again. He lost his mind. He said,</p>
<p>basically, like, you know, he took the credit that I gave him want to throw it at the window. He</p>
<p>thought I really tried to fuck him over. And then he said, I&rsquo;m going to block you for a week,</p>
<p>but then change his mind. Just tell him you&rsquo;ll buy him into the to the big game</p>
<p>or something. And he&rsquo;ll be fine. No, he didn&rsquo;t. He just wanted more credit,</p>
<p>more credit. Tell him you&rsquo;ll stake him. Because he did. He did introduce you to the</p>
<p>Is it true that he introduced that Phil Hellmuth introduced you to the deal? Yes or no?</p>
<p>He introduced me to Joe Lakem. Got it. So if not for Phil, you probably would not have made that</p>
<p>trade. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s unclear. Maybe they know they had bankers and I was you know, I was</p>
<p>using Allen and company. So I mean, do you? And there&rsquo;s not a lot of people running around in</p>
<p>that moment trying to write a 10% you because he deserve any credit for you buying your stake in</p>
<p>the Warriors. In fact, and I thought I gave him an appropriate amount of credit. Yeah,</p>
<p>Chamath tweet stormed it was like, it was Phil Peter Thiel and like one other Oh, and then</p>
<p>makeup makeup. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s like better company he couldn&rsquo;t find himself in. It&rsquo;s the best he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been. Except when he was with Michael Jordan and Jay Z. But other than that, this was the best</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s ever done. I mean, you know, when I get Did you see he made it to the second? When I get</p>
<p>my fourth ring, I&rsquo;m going to take a picture like Michael with the four rings. But but Chamath,</p>
<p>in the interest of peace, maybe you should just think Phil right now. Oh, I have a great idea</p>
<p>to tell Phil Friedberg. Look at Friedberg&rsquo;s laughing. He&rsquo;s the only one that got that</p>
<p>joke. Did you get that job? I was wondering if I should tell you to cut it or not. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good. Here&rsquo;s a great one. You know how I think it&rsquo;s a funny joke. You know how Phil</p>
<p>gives his bracelets away? As like a recognition. You don&rsquo;t have to do this. But pretend that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving since you have four rings that you wanted to thank the other three besties on the</p>
<p>show and that you&rsquo;re keeping one ring for yourself. Oh my god. Giving us the other three rings. Oh my</p>
<p>god. Thank you for all the support. We&rsquo;ve given you all the support for the Warriors. Yeah. For</p>
<p>the Warriors that we gave you and all the counsel we gave you over the years. This will put him on</p>
<p>he should have gotten one of the four rings. It&rsquo;s the greatest April Fool&rsquo;s joke. Actually,</p>
<p>that reminds me. Phil&rsquo;s next ring is going to me. So I can&rsquo;t say anything critical. Yeah,</p>
<p>bracelets. The next bracelet&rsquo;s going to me. So I can&rsquo;t say anything critical. You know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do? You&rsquo;re going to take that bracelet? Whatever I said that would be critical. I</p>
<p>guarantee you Saks takes the bracelet and loses it in the first three days and never wears it</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t care. Right in the garbage. Doesn&rsquo;t care. Never talks about it again. All right,</p>
<p>everybody. We&rsquo;re back. The team is playing professional crisp ball again. Point God is back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you on episode 87. We&rsquo;re going to make it to 100. I feel like we can make it to 100. Yes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to make it. The vibe is back. The vibe. I love you guys. It&rsquo;s a show in the text,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s great here. I gotta say, I love I love hanging. I love hanging out with Saksiput</p>
<p>like live in physical. He&rsquo;s a fucking little he&rsquo;s very you just want to take him. I love him. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good live. He&rsquo;s good. He&rsquo;s great. He&rsquo;s really he&rsquo;s so good live. He&rsquo;s really good. He&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>really good contract. He&rsquo;s an asshole. Last time I hung out live with him, he had an IV hooked up</p>
<p>and he was recovering from the night before. Saks on an IV. He&rsquo;s basically on an IV now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how bad it&rsquo;s gotten for him. Saks, you look terrible. Can you please get some sun and</p>
<p>just maybe eat one less sandwich? He&rsquo;s losing weight. He looks good. I had two. No, but you</p>
<p>could afford to. You&rsquo;re in great shape. I mean, Saks, maybe half a DeSantis. Maybe you should have</p>
<p>a half a DeSantis. I think I&rsquo;m going to put you on a half DeSantis. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time</p>
<p>on the All-In-One. Love you guys. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Saks.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>The Dasher will meet me at Glens.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet or the beat. Wet or the beat.</p>
<p>Wet or the beat.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
