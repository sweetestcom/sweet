awesome</p><p>okay so we&rsquo;ll just wait a minute for</p><p>everyone to log on</p><p>cool so people are just rolling in here</p><p>and as we&rsquo;re waiting another minute or</p><p>so I just want to ask you a question um</p><p>how many of you have like tell me about</p><p>your sleep problem is that is that it do</p><p>you have a sleep problem number one</p><p>number two visit is it severe isn&rsquo;t it</p><p>mild if you can just let me know that</p><p>would be great just because this is all</p><p>about sleep today we&rsquo;re going to talk</p><p>about tonight I&rsquo;m going to see si get</p><p>some feedback from you guys</p><p>Linda works in a sleep lab well lets you</p><p>see some interesting things so some</p><p>people wake up every every few hours</p><p>let&rsquo;s see mild I have sleep apnea mild</p><p>wake up to the night CPAP every two</p><p>hours trouble falling asleep wake up</p><p>for how to get back sleep-deprived Wow</p><p>well you&rsquo;re in for a treat tonight</p><p>because we&rsquo;re going to actually see if</p><p>we can help you with that um restless</p><p>yeah I&rsquo;m just making notes here we&rsquo;re</p><p>talking about restless leg syndrome wake</p><p>up every three hours Wow 23 years of</p><p>chronic insomnia okay can&rsquo;t turn off my</p><p>brain okay so I got the picture alright</p><p>so welcome to the webinar we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>talk about how to lose more weight while</p><p>you sleep and it&rsquo;s true it is true you</p><p>can lose way more weight when you&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping in fact when you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping</p><p>forget about losing weight it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going to happen now let&rsquo;s go ahead and</p><p>get into the slides let me just kind of</p><p>click this right here and I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>try to find my slide there we go okay</p><p>some I did this webinar someone told me</p><p>how to expand this thing to make it</p><p>bigger um I&rsquo;m going to try to do that</p><p>this time they said that press this</p><p>thing right here so I don&rsquo;t know if this</p><p>works but on on your side but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s to the entire screen on my side so</p><p>maybe it does work I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;m</p><p>just going to keep going so we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to talk about you know weight loss but</p><p>like sleep is the number one barrier to</p><p>weight loss if I&rsquo;m going to evaluate</p><p>anyone in my clinic the first thing we</p><p>have to fix is the sleep because nothing</p><p>else will work if that sleep is not good</p><p>and a lot of things it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p><p>because your lip it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing nothing when you&rsquo;re laying there</p><p>all night but you&rsquo;re actually a lot of</p><p>things are happening in your body</p><p>especially with fat burning in fact you</p><p>burn most the fat at night not during</p><p>the day and so you know I see people</p><p>that are working out so hard they&rsquo;re</p><p>going to the gym they&rsquo;re trying to count</p><p>their calories but their sleep sucks and</p><p>they&rsquo;re not losing weight I just had</p><p>another lady um yesterday in the clinic</p><p>she only loose loses weight when she</p><p>sleeps so she has a really good night</p><p>sleep let&rsquo;s say she sleeps like eight</p><p>eight and a half hours she&rsquo;ll probably</p><p>was close to a pound of fat and I&rsquo;m like</p><p>that is just amazing so sleep is like</p><p>the real key thing and so I wanted to</p><p>designate like a whole hour tonight just</p><p>to really thoroughly cover this topic of</p><p>sleep so we can handle it and it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to make your weight loss a lot easier</p><p>okay so let me just kind of go through</p><p>here so check this out each night you</p><p>have these what&rsquo;s called a circadian</p><p>rhythm and there&rsquo;s a certain wave of</p><p>hormones that come up and down and up</p><p>and down starting from about ten thirty</p><p>and going all the way to about eight</p><p>o&rsquo;clock and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s typically</p><p>about four to five different sleep waves</p><p>and if you catch them</p><p>time you can ride the wave and get a</p><p>good sleep hopefully but if you actually</p><p>go to bed like past 12 you miss the</p><p>first wave and then now you have to wait</p><p>until these hormones kick in to push you</p><p>down into the in the deeper sleep when</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have this mechanism working</p><p>you pretty much just you&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s</p><p>nothing that pushes you into that deeper</p><p>sleep so let me just show you something</p><p>right here we come back here so what</p><p>happens is that there is something in</p><p>your body that pushes you into a deep</p><p>sleep it&rsquo;s not like like passive it&rsquo;s an</p><p>active push down wave in your body that</p><p>actually is keeping you calm in a deep</p><p>sleep and you actually go through four</p><p>different levels of sleep and I want to</p><p>cover that right now but I wanted to</p><p>kind of just explain that it&rsquo;s not</p><p>passive it&rsquo;s an active thing so the</p><p>growth hormone which is basically a</p><p>hormone that is released from your liver</p><p>and it it causes the most of the fat</p><p>burning it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful</p><p>fat burning hormones out there you have</p><p>like six of them this is the most</p><p>powerful and there&rsquo;s two things that</p><p>trigger growth hormone number one high</p><p>quality sleep actually it&rsquo;s three things</p><p>intense exercise and three protein small</p><p>amounts of protein three rock through</p><p>the day will stimulate growth from one</p><p>so growth hormone spikes between 12</p><p>midnight and 2:00 and 8:00 in the</p><p>morning and this is when the fat burning</p><p>hormone actually kicks in the most at</p><p>first two hours now that&rsquo;s where you</p><p>burn most of the fat so check this out</p><p>if you you&rsquo;re going along during the day</p><p>and then all of a sudden you go to bed</p><p>maybe like a 10:30 that&rsquo;s the ideal</p><p>scene is to go to bed at 10:30 and then</p><p>try to be sleeping at 11:00 that&rsquo;s what</p><p>I do and you&rsquo;re supposed to go on the</p><p>sleep here and the eye</p><p>no you&rsquo;re not sleeping now we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to show you why but this is this is what</p><p>normal is and if you can do that you&rsquo;ll</p><p>actually be very successful now the</p><p>question is how many hours you need you</p><p>need um five six seven eight</p><p>you actually need between seven and a</p><p>half and eight and a half hours to</p><p>really burn enough fat if you&rsquo;re if the</p><p>depth of sleep is not there that means</p><p>that you&rsquo;re going to need a little bit</p><p>more sleep okay because we need that</p><p>recharging effect now check this out</p><p>these are waves of sleep and there&rsquo;s</p><p>four 90-minute cycles you know some</p><p>people there&rsquo;s five some people there&rsquo;s</p><p>three but most people have a four cycle</p><p>wave waves right here and so you have</p><p>this light sleep which is called REM</p><p>rapid eye movement REM sleep is a very</p><p>active sleep it&rsquo;s not a deep sleep it&rsquo;s</p><p>where you dream and you could remember</p><p>your dreams and it&rsquo;s vivid I had a dream</p><p>the other night I was going told my wife</p><p>I was kind of weird it was like right</p><p>before I woke up had this dream that I</p><p>was going off the road and I kind of</p><p>didn&rsquo;t overcompensate I just kind of</p><p>eased it back up on the road and</p><p>prevented us from going off a cliff so</p><p>of course that woke me up right away</p><p>that was REM sleep</p><p>now if we look down here this is called</p><p>the Delta down here and the Delta wave</p><p>sleep is the rejuvenating sleep this is</p><p>where you want to achieve this lower</p><p>level fat-burning sleep it&rsquo;s when you</p><p>wake up and you feel refreshed in the</p><p>morning that&rsquo;s what we want okay so</p><p>that&rsquo;s the goal um check this out</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of studies that show the</p><p>relationship between sleep and fat</p><p>burning and in the pretty credible</p><p>studies and so I&rsquo;m going to send</p><p>everyone these slides as well and I&rsquo;m</p><p>also going to create notes on these</p><p>slides and I will send you those as well</p><p>and a link if you&rsquo;d like after we&rsquo;re</p><p>done here but the point is that there</p><p>was a</p><p>let me just kind of pull out of here</p><p>there&rsquo;s this company that I work with um</p><p>that I see here I just want to see</p><p>there&rsquo;s some questions here</p><p>can&rsquo;t see slide slides aren&rsquo;t moving</p><p>stuck on growth hormones yeah there must</p><p>be a delay okay so no graph showing all</p><p>right that&rsquo;s fine all right as we go</p><p>through this keep letting me know if</p><p>this slides work okay because I can I</p><p>don&rsquo;t really need the slides but it</p><p>would be nice to show you some visuals</p><p>okay so there was this company it was in</p><p>Washington state and it was drug company</p><p>and they were talking to another company</p><p>that I work with that built my</p><p>assessment to look at the stress and</p><p>recovery inside the body it&rsquo;s a little</p><p>tool and said they wanted to get a hold</p><p>of this to do some research and in this</p><p>in the company ask well why do you want</p><p>to do this research and it was mainly</p><p>because they found a drug that induces a</p><p>delta-wave sleep and they found some</p><p>interesting incidental findings when</p><p>they do that</p><p>they found that people lose a tremendous</p><p>amount of weight when they take that</p><p>drug but it&rsquo;s really the sleep but</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of side effects so I mean</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on with</p><p>sleep now with people trying to create</p><p>different drugs to put you in sleep we</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do that we want to create</p><p>natural sleep</p><p>let&rsquo;s see chaos is you&rsquo;re talking about</p><p>the waves of sleep you just mentioned</p><p>down down here and data but LMC growth</p><p>hormone well um there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m just going</p><p>to show you there&rsquo;s four waves of sleep</p><p>right here and you have a very</p><p>superficial sleep and you have a deep</p><p>sleep and the deep sleep is where you</p><p>burn the most the fat and the</p><p>superficial sleep is when you get REM</p><p>sleep it&rsquo;s very active you have dreams</p><p>when you&rsquo;re in the Delta you may dream</p><p>but you don&rsquo;t remember your dreams so</p><p>that&rsquo;s a</p><p>all you need to know not that maybe I</p><p>could just pull it up one more time let</p><p>me just see I can do that I think I know</p><p>why I think I know why that happened let</p><p>me just let me see right here because I</p><p>have to click a button so can you see</p><p>this slide now the cycles tell if you</p><p>can see it the problem is there&rsquo;s a</p><p>little delay so it&rsquo;s hard to quickly ask</p><p>you a question ok good so I think you</p><p>can see it alright cool so I think the</p><p>problem is that I have to click this</p><p>little button and share with everyone</p><p>but now you can see what I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about so I won&rsquo;t be able to blow it up</p><p>but you could really see the different</p><p>slides now</p><p>the other thing I wanted to mention is</p><p>that I mean sleep doesn&rsquo;t just block</p><p>your fat burning&rsquo; it does some serious</p><p>damage or a lack of sleep I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t just block your fat burning it</p><p>increases your appetite it actually</p><p>destroys your metabolism it increases</p><p>stress it increases the loss of muscle</p><p>tone ok so increases muscle loss muscle</p><p>tone loss you can type it in it and</p><p>causes fatigue of course we know that it</p><p>affects your mood and cause depression</p><p>in fact I would be curious to find</p><p>someone who is depressed that is also</p><p>not fatigue I mean it&rsquo;s also fatigued at</p><p>the same time because if you actually</p><p>improve the sleep on a depressed person</p><p>and increase your energy the odds of</p><p>them being depressed are go down are</p><p>very very low because they just they can</p><p>pull out of it a lot of depression is</p><p>really chronic fatigue syndrome so they</p><p>just can&rsquo;t differentiate depression from</p><p>body fatigue so that&rsquo;s right I actually</p><p>try to improve the energy so it also</p><p>increases the risk of blood sugar</p><p>problems and diabetes increases heart</p><p>attacks there&rsquo;s this guy in India he was</p><p>a business person and he would he was an</p><p>exercise guy he would go out there and</p><p>work out a hard core trying to be</p><p>healthy you</p><p>at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning he only</p><p>got five hours of sleep well he dropped</p><p>out of a heart attack because the</p><p>increased risk of heart attack</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re pushing your your</p><p>heart and you&rsquo;re exercising hardcore and</p><p>you&rsquo;re not sleeping a very bad idea it</p><p>lowers the immune system it decreases</p><p>your lifespan other than that it&rsquo;s</p><p>perfectly fine</p><p>I&rsquo;m being sarcastic okay so most the</p><p>people are saying I could see the slides</p><p>some people say I can&rsquo;t see this last no</p><p>problem I tell you what when we&rsquo;re done</p><p>here I will send you the slides okay um</p><p>all right so so the point is that sleep</p><p>can really destroy almost every part of</p><p>your body so um let me just go ahead and</p><p>click this right here now just as a side</p><p>note I want to just wait till everyone</p><p>got on here I finally got my my new app</p><p>done and hopefully you can see this can</p><p>you see my new app um it&rsquo;s a dr. Berg</p><p>app and it&rsquo;s been weeks and weeks and</p><p>weeks and weeks so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s completely</p><p>dead now and I have it on an iPhone and</p><p>I have it on a Android so if you have</p><p>those smartphones go ahead and download</p><p>it it&rsquo;s for free and I put on there all</p><p>of my videos and I took the voiceovers</p><p>or the audios on all the videos and I</p><p>uploaded those too so you can check that</p><p>out um so and what I would really really</p><p>really really appreciate is if you guys</p><p>can write a review when you download it</p><p>that would be very appreciative um but</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just show you if I could just show</p><p>you my little iPhone right here see how</p><p>this works here</p><p>okay so this is the app you can&rsquo;t even</p><p>see it right so we got videos and I</p><p>think the lights reflecting it too weird</p><p>there we go yeah we just click this</p><p>right here and then you can watch all my</p><p>videos in one place so every week I&rsquo;m</p><p>uploading more and more videos I have</p><p>about six hundred additional videos I</p><p>did not upload because I don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>upload them um all of a sudden so I&rsquo;ll</p><p>be uploading like one a day because I</p><p>just been creating a lot of videos so it</p><p>has the video audio and then it also has</p><p>this really cool thing documents so you</p><p>can download so you want to press open</p><p>if you press open</p><p>that&rsquo;s the download and then you could</p><p>zoom it in and check it out so I put all</p><p>my documents there so you can check that</p><p>out and then you go back to the app it</p><p>has updates audio its audio video and</p><p>documents so and then you can click if</p><p>you want to see new updates if you click</p><p>new updates it looks like there&rsquo;s like</p><p>two of everything that&rsquo;s not a bug what</p><p>that is that is um video and audio</p><p>release so they are the same they look</p><p>the same because they&rsquo;re just an audio</p><p>of the video so you can check that out</p><p>and that&rsquo;s cool so definitely give me a</p><p>review on that and also if you see</p><p>anything that you&rsquo;d like me to improve</p><p>in that app just send me an email</p><p>because we&rsquo;re always looking for ways to</p><p>kind of tweak it make it better</p><p>so that would be great I just have a</p><p>quick question here and CKY says can you</p><p>answer a question about ketogenic diet</p><p>and nighttime weight loss sure what is</p><p>the question</p><p>maybe you want to know um if you would</p><p>do that diet will that help you lose</p><p>weight yeah if you combine the key the</p><p>ketogenic diet with weight with more</p><p>sleep that&rsquo;s a deadly powerful</p><p>combination</p><p>in fact the only thing you have to make</p><p>and that is adjust your fats because</p><p>some people will show fat burning in the</p><p>urine but the problem is that they don&rsquo;t</p><p>um they&rsquo;re not burning their own fat</p><p>they&rsquo;re burning the fat that they&rsquo;re</p><p>eating so they have to adjust the</p><p>dietary fats and not have too many but</p><p>other people can get a get away with</p><p>more eating more fat if you feel a</p><p>lethargic or you feel tired um what that</p><p>means is that you need vitamin b5 okay</p><p>you can be vitamins so someone sort of</p><p>patty scissors you&rsquo;re AB for iPhone or</p><p>Android it both regardless if you have</p><p>an Android iPhone it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;ll work on</p><p>both um please create an app for Windows</p><p>Phone oh that&rsquo;s interesting that&rsquo;s an</p><p>idea I&rsquo;ll have to do that I will have to</p><p>do that I will do that for sure okay let</p><p>me go back to these slides alright let</p><p>me just go here alright so check this</p><p>out there is a clock up in your brain</p><p>and it&rsquo;s a pacemaker and it&rsquo;s</p><p>synchronized to the dark and light</p><p>cycles and exercise does influences it</p><p>as well and the name of this clock it&rsquo;s</p><p>a real big word is called super Chai&rsquo;s</p><p>mechanical I don&rsquo;t worry about</p><p>memorizing that but it&rsquo;s right in it&rsquo;s</p><p>very close to the hypothalamus right in</p><p>the mid part of the brain when this</p><p>clock has a pre-programmed system that</p><p>basically allows you to go to sleep and</p><p>wake up and it&rsquo;s not a tiny mechanism</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty cool so the reason I&rsquo;m</p><p>bringing that up is because a lot of you</p><p>sit in an office all day you don&rsquo;t get</p><p>outside and this whole lighting thing</p><p>a situation so I do want to talk about</p><p>that the certain forms of light are good</p><p>for you and certain forms of life is are</p><p>very bad for you</p><p>fluorescent lighting iridescent light is</p><p>not good full spectrum lighting is the</p><p>best so that&rsquo;s what I want to cover</p><p>right now I&rsquo;m going to show you a</p><p>picture of what I have in my office</p><p>and at home let me see if I can find it</p><p>well it&rsquo;s a slide a little bit later I&rsquo;m</p><p>not going to jump into that but if you</p><p>went to the Home Depot or you went to I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know you went to any store that</p><p>sells light bulbs or even amazon.com and</p><p>order some full spectrum lighting you</p><p>should put that on a little lamp around</p><p>your computer because right now there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lamp or right button my computer that</p><p>has full spectrum light if I didn&rsquo;t have</p><p>that I would create a lot of strain in</p><p>my my computer my eyes and so it does</p><p>affect the sleep pattern so so the goal</p><p>is to get some light during the day out</p><p>some natural sunlight outside you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard in the winter but you need to</p><p>get out there because if you&rsquo;re in a</p><p>building all day long and you drive home</p><p>it&rsquo;s dark and you try to go to sleep</p><p>that is going to start to screw up your</p><p>sleep cycles right there because you</p><p>because what happens is we have the</p><p>situation where darkness triggers the</p><p>hormones that help you go to sleep light</p><p>inhibits those hormones okay so you have</p><p>that whole stimulus enriched in an</p><p>hibbott ending factor of the light and</p><p>dark cycle so we really need to figure</p><p>that out and I think the best way is to</p><p>get a simple inexpensive light bulb</p><p>maybe by your office or in your house</p><p>that you can have that you know shining</p><p>on a little bit on your face or in your</p><p>eyes actually really the key is the I</p><p>don&rsquo;t like shine the light inside your</p><p>eyeball but you can just put it so some</p><p>of the light goes into your eye because</p><p>that&rsquo;s the trigger is the retina the</p><p>retina is an extension of your brain so</p><p>your eyes are an extension of your brain</p><p>so</p><p>goes right in now look at how complex</p><p>this circuitry is in your brain and I</p><p>actually went through this and I just</p><p>kind of design this chart by taking a</p><p>lot of references and things just to</p><p>wrap my wits around it because there are</p><p>so many different electrical circuit</p><p>boards in your brain that are</p><p>controlling the sleep cycles and then go</p><p>down are affected by the liver and the</p><p>adrenal gland and the bladder and these</p><p>other parts of the brain but I don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to confuse you with that so I just</p><p>wanted to show you the complexity that</p><p>goes on and then when we get into the</p><p>last part I&rsquo;m going to show you how we</p><p>can influence some of these circuits</p><p>because it&rsquo;s really just a circuit now</p><p>as we do this webinar I want to kind of</p><p>bounce back in forth to your questions</p><p>so Michelle says what kind of bulb was</p><p>that you want to get a full spectrum</p><p>light full spectrum lighting light bulb</p><p>or whatever I have them in kind of these</p><p>some longer bulbs and I have smaller</p><p>bulbs so Julie talks about I never</p><p>remember my dreams that is a B vitamin</p><p>deficiency Deborah let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s see a</p><p>question says I have a problem with my</p><p>body feeling very heavy if I go to the</p><p>bathroom at night is the bead deficiency</p><p>are you just talking about your whole</p><p>body being heavy</p><p>um yeah I try to clarify that I&rsquo;m not</p><p>sure what you mean by that can hormones</p><p>work during a nap absolutely there&rsquo;s</p><p>nothing wrong with taking naps in fact</p><p>if you&rsquo;re not sleeping during the night</p><p>time it&rsquo;s best if you take a nap because</p><p>you can tend to recover some of that</p><p>sleep why if I&rsquo;m sleeping around seven</p><p>hours and really good I&rsquo;m not losing</p><p>weight oh okay</p><p>well here&rsquo;s the thing sleep is this one</p><p>factor there are many many other factors</p><p>that effect weight loss so just because</p><p>you&rsquo;re sleeping does not mean you can</p><p>eat what you want it doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p><p>can&rsquo;t exercise but if you&rsquo;re eating good</p><p>and you have the right eating plan and</p><p>you&rsquo;re exercising everything is really</p><p>cool and your body is really healthy</p><p>then you just plug in the sleep but</p><p>there&rsquo;s always a reason why you can&rsquo;t</p><p>lose weight sleep is one of the biggest</p><p>things so Dell says what about with hot</p><p>flashes well that&rsquo;s the next thing I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to talk about hot flashes so we</p><p>wanted to kind of dissect the reason why</p><p>you can&rsquo;t sleep and it could be hot</p><p>flashes it could be your bladder</p><p>digestion pain let&rsquo;s just take from the</p><p>top hot flashes your adrenal glands are</p><p>the backup organ to the ovaries so</p><p>during menopause at fifty fifty two the</p><p>adrenal glands on top your top of the</p><p>kidneys they back up the ovaries during</p><p>menopause if those adrenals are weak</p><p>going in the menopause what&rsquo;s going to</p><p>happen is that all those problems with</p><p>your period and having bloating and</p><p>cramping are going to manifest in a</p><p>different way as hot flashes because</p><p>those women may get hot flashes they</p><p>usually had bad cycle cycles before</p><p>menopause so what does that mean with</p><p>hot flashes it&rsquo;s actually a estrogen</p><p>deficiency and it&rsquo;s a progesterone</p><p>imbalance it&rsquo;s really a low progesterone</p><p>but the best thing that I do is I use</p><p>that product ovary support right here</p><p>this this is a product a lot of women</p><p>have it&rsquo;s mainly for menstrual cycle</p><p>problems but I use it for hot flashes</p><p>because it handles if there&rsquo;s too much</p><p>estrogen or not enough estrogen and you</p><p>take three before bed and that should</p><p>handle your hot flashes it just has</p><p>remedies in there to help balance your</p><p>estrogen naturally but it doesn&rsquo;t have</p><p>estrogen in it because that you don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to take estrogen but hot flashes</p><p>will will be one source of and I&rsquo;m not</p><p>sleeping and that that&rsquo;s what we need to</p><p>fix because the cause of sleeping</p><p>problems is different from certain</p><p>people okay so since right here</p><p>my friend recently had a uterine</p><p>ablation will this cause problems</p><p>estrogen it creates a trauma and uterus</p><p>and it could create problems with</p><p>sleeping why can I sleep more than four</p><p>hours even without having hot flashes</p><p>well we&rsquo;ll get to the other reasons</p><p>shortly</p><p>oh yeah Sean says you use ovary support</p><p>no I don&rsquo;t use I do not use ovary</p><p>support</p><p>I actually recommend it for women that</p><p>have flashes however I&rsquo;ve had men have</p><p>hot flashes so I haven&rsquo;t recommend that</p><p>product though um what about night</p><p>sweats well that&rsquo;s the same thing as hot</p><p>flash as far as the remedy a</p><p>hysterectomy can this be a problem yes</p><p>because that forces the adrenals to have</p><p>to do like back up that organ absolutely</p><p>so yeah that is a situation when should</p><p>you take B vitamins before with or after</p><p>eating food the B vitamins typically you</p><p>want to take them more in the early part</p><p>of the day but um not always some people</p><p>when they take them can&rsquo;t sleep other</p><p>people can sleep better so I would test</p><p>it out at certain parts of the day but</p><p>really it doesn&rsquo;t matter with food or</p><p>without food or a certain part of a but</p><p>I like to have a little bit more in</p><p>morning because the vitamins can</p><p>increase energy and you don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>have that red fritter bed all right so</p><p>let me get back to the slides here all</p><p>right so we talked about hot flashes no</p><p>your bladder let&rsquo;s say your bladder wait</p><p>wakes up does anyone have any bladder</p><p>issues like you&rsquo;re urinating through the</p><p>night but at least once if you do</p><p>there&rsquo;s several reasons for that there&rsquo;s</p><p>really there&rsquo;s like four reasons one</p><p>would be maybe there&rsquo;s a fibroid and</p><p>fibroids are caused from excessive</p><p>estrogen so you would want to fix the</p><p>excess estrogen and that&rsquo;s an ovary</p><p>problems Wow so yeah everyone&rsquo;s actually</p><p>getting up her a lot all right so we get</p><p>fibroids it can cause it if someone has</p><p>fibroids one of the</p><p>best thing to do to shrink that is to</p><p>consume cruciferous vegetables you could</p><p>also the other thing that will help</p><p>shrink fibroids is doing a keep</p><p>ketogenic diet because when you eat</p><p>carbs</p><p>it does make think things grow like</p><p>tumors and cysts and so if you cut out</p><p>that all the sugars that will help</p><p>shrink the fibroid because insulin makes</p><p>things grow so does estrogen now also</p><p>enlarged prostate will also cause you&rsquo;d</p><p>this comes from high testosterone so</p><p>there&rsquo;s any men listening in and you</p><p>have that the best thing to do for high</p><p>testosterone is to support the liver</p><p>with cruciferous a lot of cruciferous</p><p>vegetables that&rsquo;s the best thing I know</p><p>to actually balance the testosterone</p><p>because testosterone works with the</p><p>liver okay then menopause when women</p><p>have a problem with their bladder during</p><p>menopause it usually comes from a</p><p>decrease of estrogen so again the</p><p>ovaries support formula would help to</p><p>balance that now on occasion the person</p><p>is so depleted from estrogen I don&rsquo;t</p><p>recommend this routinely but only after</p><p>you tried everything else I would</p><p>recommend some organic non-gmo soy milk</p><p>because that will give you a little</p><p>estrogen to help you but I don&rsquo;t like to</p><p>do that but a small amount here and</p><p>there would be totally fine okay so let</p><p>me just I&rsquo;m going to pause here and</p><p>answer some questions I was told my</p><p>problem is cortisol wake me up well I&rsquo;m</p><p>getting to that shortly</p><p>I have thyroid symptoms and I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>eating kale shakes for several months</p><p>which doubt should have follow</p><p>Kito or a moderate car plan well if</p><p>you&rsquo;re a thyroid type I would pretty</p><p>much do a combination of things because</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing the kale shakes you want</p><p>to make sure you take some seek help</p><p>because you want to actually have more</p><p>iodine but usually thyroid is secondary</p><p>to the high estrogen or low gall bladder</p><p>I would suggest going to my youtube</p><p>channel and look</p><p>up those videos I have actually now just</p><p>go ahead and get my download my app and</p><p>you can check out all the videos on the</p><p>thyroid and I talked about the cause of</p><p>that let&rsquo;s see taurine yeah Torian is</p><p>good amino acid I&rsquo;ve tried it with a</p><p>number of adrenal cases it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d seen</p><p>mixed results sometimes it works</p><p>sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t someone wants to</p><p>know examples of vegetables well number</p><p>one the type of vegetables that you guys</p><p>need would be especially with the</p><p>cruciferous would be the kale of course</p><p>the broccoli that cabbage red cabbage is</p><p>really good I like arugula you can also</p><p>use bok choy any of the mustard greens</p><p>with chard those are some serious</p><p>cruciferous vegetables that will</p><p>actually help anti-cancer and also help</p><p>you know shrink a fibroid all right um</p><p>is soy okay for hypothyroidism well</p><p>again I&rsquo;m only recommending the soy if</p><p>you have some serious hot flashes and</p><p>you&rsquo;ve done everything and nothing&rsquo;s</p><p>work but I don&rsquo;t recommend silly if you</p><p>have a hypothyroid because the destra</p><p>gene will slow your thyroid down more</p><p>someone Claudia had a cervical cancer</p><p>and my uterus moved in to get my ovaries</p><p>radiated so now we know your adrenals</p><p>are working at over time and that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to put a lot of stress on</p><p>everything else so we&rsquo;re going to get to</p><p>the adrenal glands the last thing</p><p>okay now digestion let&rsquo;s talk about that</p><p>your digestive system has a whole bunch</p><p>of nerves in them you have actually more</p><p>dudgeon your digestive system than you</p><p>do in your spinal column so all those</p><p>nerves can go right up to the brain</p><p>and create a lot of problems with neck</p><p>muscle tension in your neck very active</p><p>brain so if you&rsquo;re getting bloating and</p><p>going the bed with a bloating stomach</p><p>that will easily cause you to stay up</p><p>all night so with some slight minor</p><p>tweaks with your digestive system and</p><p>this is a very important point I&rsquo;m just</p><p>going to make a note because if you have</p><p>any digestive problems and you&rsquo;re going</p><p>trying to sleep you want to clean that</p><p>up</p><p>you know and it could be that you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating foods that you&rsquo;re bloating that</p><p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be eating like even the</p><p>cabbage or the broccoli or the cow if</p><p>you blow with that then steam it or eat</p><p>some other vegetables but you don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to bloat and go to bed because that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to prevent sleeping if your</p><p>stomach is really working good you&rsquo;ll</p><p>sleep a lot better because you have less</p><p>tension in your neck because all the</p><p>stomach stuff refers up to your neck and</p><p>the other thing is that you want to make</p><p>sure that you don&rsquo;t eat right before bed</p><p>so you&rsquo;re all bloated especially fatty</p><p>foods if you&rsquo;re doing the ketosis diet</p><p>and it&rsquo;s a lot of fat and protein you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do that late in the</p><p>evening because it&rsquo;s going to sit in</p><p>your stomach so it&rsquo;s very important to</p><p>go to bed</p><p>maybe with just like not necessarily</p><p>hunger but so you&rsquo;re not you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>too much food in your stomach okay so</p><p>that would actually help you Mary says I</p><p>awakened with charley horses in my legs</p><p>and gee well that is a calcium</p><p>deficiency so you need calcium magnesium</p><p>before bed um I was taking adrenal</p><p>supplements but I was super tired all</p><p>the time what is the best time to take</p><p>them well it really depends on what</p><p>supplements you have I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>recommend my adrenal fatigue formula in</p><p>a little bit if you want something for</p><p>sleep that works really good and in the</p><p>adrenal de if you want something add</p><p>more energy during the day but it really</p><p>because there&rsquo;s some adrenal stuff that</p><p>that&rsquo;s good for just general boosting</p><p>you and there&rsquo;s other ones that calm you</p><p>down is drinking for 4 ounces let&rsquo;s say</p><p>for 8 ounce glasses of kale shake in the</p><p>morning too much uh no not necessarily</p><p>um especially if you&rsquo;re not putting too</p><p>much fruit in it I think you&rsquo;ll be fine</p><p>with that that camel is some really good</p><p>stuff just make sure you put some drink</p><p>some lemon juice somewhere in the day so</p><p>you can rig make sure you don&rsquo;t get any</p><p>stones any suggestion grinding your</p><p>teeth at night that&rsquo;s a B vitamin</p><p>deficiency and also someone says I&rsquo;m</p><p>hungry when I wake up</p><p>um if that&rsquo;s a problem then maybe have a</p><p>little bit more food at dinner but I I</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that too much do</p><p>you know about santa process elements</p><p>yes I know a lot about Santa process</p><p>supplements that use them for 20 years</p><p>that I&rsquo;ve been to the farm six times</p><p>I studied royally so I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m very</p><p>knowledgeable about that would a banana</p><p>be good right before that no because</p><p>it&rsquo;s a carb you don&rsquo;t want to do carsick</p><p>or beg what you want to do is you want</p><p>to do maybe some celery listen a little</p><p>bit of peanut butter maybe a little bit</p><p>of nut maybe some hummus with some like</p><p>celery celery something like that but</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to do too much right</p><p>before bed</p><p>good questions by the way all right so</p><p>we talked about digestion now we want to</p><p>talk about pain now if you have pain in</p><p>your back whatever then you&rsquo;re not going</p><p>to able to sleep so we want to fix the</p><p>pain so you&rsquo;d want to get that handled I</p><p>just did a seminar on how to get rid of</p><p>pain a lot of people flew out and came</p><p>to the seminar and a lot of people got</p><p>the program so if you wanted some help</p><p>with that you can get that</p><p>do-it-yourself version even if you have</p><p>low back pain or knee pain or whatever</p><p>and also I have a lot of videos on pain</p><p>you can check it out on my actually on</p><p>your new app okay now I&rsquo;m going to talk</p><p>about heart your heart a tired heart</p><p>will keep you up at night as well and</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about high blood pressure</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about high pulse rate so a</p><p>lot of people when they go to sleep that</p><p>blood pressure try to sleep with a a</p><p>blood pressure like 150 over a hundred</p><p>you it&rsquo;s like too much pressure going on</p><p>the body so the simple remedy for high</p><p>blood pressure is vitamin k2 in d3 and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll show you that another slide that it</p><p>works like a charm</p><p>it actually strips off the calcium that</p><p>builds up in arteries and it will bring</p><p>your pressure right down but a high</p><p>pulse rate is a patan</p><p>see em deficiency okay so I think you</p><p>probably know this most of you because</p><p>I&rsquo;ve covered this so many times but you</p><p>need about seven to ten cups of</p><p>vegetable per day to get your greens</p><p>okay so you need seven to seven to ten</p><p>cups and that would be like seven to ten</p><p>ounces so these baby lettuce leaf packs</p><p>in the in the grocery store they come in</p><p>these little packs so just read a label</p><p>how many ounces it is it could be 18</p><p>ounces and eat half of that so you can</p><p>do the vegetables you can do you can</p><p>blend your vegetables with kale you can</p><p>also eat other vegetables you want to</p><p>have a variety and so I&rsquo;m always eating</p><p>combining a little red cabbage with kale</p><p>and arugula I love arugula and I&rsquo;ll do</p><p>spinach and I&rsquo;ll do this so you want to</p><p>mix it up but that vegetable will</p><p>increase potassium in your pulse rate</p><p>will come down a normal pulse rate is</p><p>like 70 but it gives people that it&rsquo;s</p><p>like it&rsquo;s over 100 so Claudius&rsquo;s</p><p>sometimes I wake up with a pounding</p><p>heart that&rsquo;s a low potassium so you need</p><p>more potassium in your diet um will</p><p>calcium magnesium help with achy legs no</p><p>there&rsquo;s something else for the rest of</p><p>leg and that would be vitamin b1 so so</p><p>it&rsquo;s the B vitamins okay but make sure</p><p>you don&rsquo;t get a synthetic vitamin that</p><p>will not work okay let me just pull this</p><p>up right here okay</p><p>now we talked about the heart now we</p><p>talked about so let&rsquo;s talk about sleep</p><p>apnea</p><p>alright sleep apnea sleep apnea is not</p><p>not a sleep problem it&rsquo;s a breathing</p><p>problem where the oxygen goes lower</p><p>because it&rsquo;s an obstructive thing but</p><p>check this out there&rsquo;s a nerve there is</p><p>a nerve that comes out of your brain</p><p>stem comes right of the brainstem it</p><p>goes to the back of the sinuses and that</p><p>nerve becomes atrophied it actually it</p><p>loses its tone when you have high levels</p><p>of cortisol adrenal stress and all the</p><p>back of the sinuses in the throat will</p><p>can actually become really lacks and</p><p>kind of hang out and create like a flat</p><p>there and obstruct your air so sleep</p><p>apnea is really an adrenal problem okay</p><p>so in other words we come back back to</p><p>the Drina so now we covered all the</p><p>other things now we&rsquo;re going to talk</p><p>about a dream because that&rsquo;s the number</p><p>one cause of sleep problems and I wanted</p><p>to cover that the last part of the</p><p>seminar because so many people have</p><p>stress Michelle asked a what about</p><p>meditation helping sleep Michelle I want</p><p>to talk about meditation I think you</p><p>should do the opposite of meditation to</p><p>sleep and so instead of like fixating on</p><p>something or focusing on something even</p><p>with your eyes closed or whatever I like</p><p>to extrovert myself before bed I like to</p><p>go for a walk in the evening and look at</p><p>things and get my attention going out</p><p>versus reflecting internally because all</p><p>day long I&rsquo;m focusing on things I have</p><p>to reverse the flow and get out of my</p><p>head so like getting your sleep you know</p><p>what happens is that people have a</p><p>problem with their attention there their</p><p>attention is fixated on a certain thing</p><p>and they can&rsquo;t unfix ate it and just</p><p>turn it off like that so what they</p><p>should do is get involved in some</p><p>activity that you can control your</p><p>attention on</p><p>thing else that&rsquo;s not involving your</p><p>work your problems just pushing your</p><p>attention to something else because what</p><p>happens you go for a walk and you&rsquo;re</p><p>looking at the tree but you&rsquo;re thinking</p><p>about work then you&rsquo;re at work you&rsquo;re</p><p>thinking about the tree so we want to</p><p>control the attention by going out there</p><p>and looking at things and just observing</p><p>things and getting attention for about</p><p>an hour that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s like a</p><p>thing you have to practice over and over</p><p>again but that&rsquo;s very very important</p><p>it&rsquo;s not bad to use a CPAP machine if</p><p>you need it as a transition but the</p><p>alien mask is not very comfortable so we</p><p>want to get it to the point we don&rsquo;t</p><p>need that and there&rsquo;s an acupressure</p><p>tool boom I have this this is it right</p><p>here the acupressure tool most of you</p><p>have it but this goes right in the back</p><p>of the neck on a couch or tall back</p><p>chair and you can set this thing right</p><p>for the second bone in the neck and I</p><p>have a a book that goes with it that</p><p>shows you how to do the sinus points and</p><p>this will open up your sinuses now why</p><p>because all the nerves that go to your</p><p>sinuses to the brainstem are right in</p><p>that area so you&rsquo;re actually steaming in</p><p>your nervous system in fact there&rsquo;s even</p><p>a very bad treatment that they&rsquo;re going</p><p>to launch and you&rsquo;re going to see a lot</p><p>more of this unfortunately in the future</p><p>they&rsquo;re using it&rsquo;s called Vegas</p><p>stimulation they&rsquo;re actually using</p><p>electric electricity implants in your</p><p>arm your nervous system specially the</p><p>nerves back there for all sorts of</p><p>conditions one for sleeping one for</p><p>sinuses four for sleep apnea I think</p><p>this is very bad because they&rsquo;re going</p><p>to put chips they can put right now they</p><p>actually have a in Harlem New York they</p><p>opened up the biggest brain center you</p><p>can see in Marik&rsquo;s</p><p>they&rsquo;re going to have a lot of children</p><p>come in there and study their brains I&rsquo;m</p><p>nervous about that because they know</p><p>they&rsquo;re having this little chip that</p><p>they can insert into the brain and then</p><p>they can monitor different things and</p><p>create stimulation of the brain with</p><p>electricity which is I can just see what</p><p>is going this is like really bad you</p><p>know like anything with a chip that they</p><p>can control electricity in your brain is</p><p>bad is folic acid equivalent to b1 now</p><p>folic acid is a different B vitamin it&rsquo;s</p><p>one of the B vitamins but it creates</p><p>different effects okay and we&rsquo;ll get</p><p>into the B vitamins okay so now I want</p><p>to talk about this adrenal adrenal gland</p><p>right adrenal gland sits on the kidney</p><p>um it&rsquo;s a tiny little gland and it can</p><p>create a lot of misery for you so let me</p><p>just kind of talk about the oh here just</p><p>to the side now that heart blood</p><p>pressure vitamin d3 k2 I have some in my</p><p>website if you wanted to get mine but</p><p>it&rsquo;s I would take one to one ratio take</p><p>like three of each in the morning for</p><p>blood pressure works pretty good</p><p>again I&rsquo;m not telling you it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>cure your blood pressure but just work</p><p>with your doctor but it&rsquo;s the remedy</p><p>that I&rsquo;ve seen gos success with okay</p><p>adrenal fatigue let&rsquo;s talk about that</p><p>can you guys see my slides are you</p><p>tracking with me here I can&rsquo;t see slides</p><p>yeah Lorraine says do you mean a</p><p>conventional medicine a yes</p><p>conventional medicine Elect yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>almost like certain companies are</p><p>shifting okay you can see myself certain</p><p>companies are shifting from certain</p><p>drugs into electrotherapy and I just</p><p>don&rsquo;t like it I do not like it at all</p><p>because I just I think you know shock</p><p>therapy is very bad and I don&rsquo;t like any</p><p>stimulation I mean even hospitals now</p><p>are doing this procedure they&rsquo;re putting</p><p>these electrical things and brains like</p><p>like a hundred a week in different</p><p>hospitals so I don&rsquo;t know where this is</p><p>going but it&rsquo;s not good okay so now</p><p>check this out there are some this might</p><p>be shocking to you but there are some</p><p>people that are addicted to caffeine</p><p>coffee I know it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s hard to</p><p>believe that but um they need coffee to</p><p>wake up so caffeine alright so if you</p><p>need coffee to wake up chances are your</p><p>adrenals are pretty pretty tired now if</p><p>you are addicted to coffee maybe you</p><p>could just have one cup in the morning</p><p>and have it like a small cup public that</p><p>and just make sure that when you put</p><p>don&rsquo;t drink coffee in the evening or at</p><p>lunch only in the morning and then also</p><p>make sure that you don&rsquo;t put um sugar in</p><p>your coffee put xylitol in your coffee</p><p>and not honey</p><p>xylitol also if you want to put cream</p><p>put organic cream don&rsquo;t put that like</p><p>other cream it&rsquo;s not good so one of the</p><p>symptoms of adrenal fatigue is need for</p><p>caffeine in the morning and I had a</p><p>artist draw these by the way I think</p><p>they&rsquo;re pretty cool um thinking thinking</p><p>thinking how many of you do a lot of</p><p>thinking and you can&rsquo;t seem to turn it</p><p>off sometimes</p><p>does anyone have that problem go ahead</p><p>and let me know but here&rsquo;s what happens</p><p>with the adrenal um you&rsquo;re analyzing</p><p>everything and what happens is because</p><p>the adrenal has to do with survival well</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s doing a lot of thinking dude</p><p>renal clam is a survival gland and so if</p><p>you can think about what happens when</p><p>the adrenal gland kicks in the adrenal</p><p>gland adapts to stress and sort of</p><p>threatened survival states so an adrenal</p><p>gland gets burnt out it&rsquo;s way to</p><p>compensate is to activate all the things</p><p>that are like like your mind active mind</p><p>and your mind tends to solve problems so</p><p>you&rsquo;re solving problems like very very</p><p>fast</p><p>and that&rsquo;s all you do is solve problems</p><p>so your attention gets fixated on a</p><p>problem on plan a and then Plan B and</p><p>this isn&rsquo;t work Plan B and that&rsquo;s all it</p><p>does all day long it can&rsquo;t just extract</p><p>and not think about anything else and</p><p>it&rsquo;s all about fixing things and making</p><p>things better and then the tolerance for</p><p>anyone that is the opposite of that is</p><p>very low so insane people you can&rsquo;t</p><p>tolerate insane people slow people</p><p>incompetent people people that make</p><p>mistakes you don&rsquo;t have patience for</p><p>those people you might have a great day</p><p>but that one little problem just stuck</p><p>to you and that&rsquo;s adrenal okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to affect your sleep because if</p><p>you&rsquo;re sleeping and you&rsquo;re analyzing</p><p>everything on the planet why beef right</p><p>before bed then it&rsquo;s just like a party</p><p>in your brain right you just can&rsquo;t turn</p><p>it off I want to see if anyone has that</p><p>problem oh yeah Doris is a human felt or</p><p>Michelle says that you&rsquo;ve been following</p><p>me no haven&rsquo;t based on the symptoms you</p><p>described your videos identify myself as</p><p>so most adrenal fatigue yeah that&rsquo;s a</p><p>very very common um someone needs coffee</p><p>of dry drivers you can&rsquo;t stand them yeah</p><p>I hear you okay yeah</p><p>so we have this thing called racing</p><p>thoughts that is an overactive adrenal</p><p>and you know what happens is this all</p><p>stress accumulates and I want to</p><p>describe the stress and I&rsquo;m not talking</p><p>about physical stress and talked about</p><p>mental stress I&rsquo;m talking about threat</p><p>of loss bad things happen to people all</p><p>the time</p><p>in the wrong place you know and someone</p><p>loves you or you have a loss of loved</p><p>one financial disasters threaten a job</p><p>loss relationship stresses relative</p><p>stresses goals are achieved unhappy in</p><p>your job like all that stuff just kind</p><p>of builds on a person so you have to</p><p>actively extract</p><p>get from the body we&rsquo;re going to show</p><p>you some techniques but it is possible</p><p>to do that because all that stuff weighs</p><p>on the adrenal and in our society when</p><p>you actually on you get up in the</p><p>morning you&rsquo;re on your cell phone you&rsquo;re</p><p>on a computer and I don&rsquo;t really use my</p><p>cell phone very much because I am very</p><p>sensitive to magnetic fields I can feel</p><p>them and so I actually bought a magnetic</p><p>field monitor so I can check things and</p><p>I want to show you how this works so</p><p>okay now watch this is my cell phone see</p><p>how that goes up there so I don&rsquo;t want</p><p>this thing on my my head</p><p>so this basically the thing about</p><p>magnetic fields is that it alters it</p><p>alters the the adrenals and also the</p><p>brain it can affect you because now my</p><p>computer all my computer stuff is about</p><p>three feet over this way on the bottom</p><p>and I have my filing cabinet right down</p><p>here between me and the computer so how</p><p>that before I was feel like I was being</p><p>fried but what you can do is you can get</p><p>a quart an extension that goes into your</p><p>ear with a little mic right here not a</p><p>bluetooth just an earphone that you can</p><p>talk and you can listen that way you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have to have this right in your</p><p>head right here this stuff you talk on</p><p>the phone all day it&rsquo;s going to affect</p><p>your sleep okay you&rsquo;re on the computer</p><p>all day it&rsquo;s going to affect your sleep</p><p>you need a light a full-spectrum light</p><p>by your computers to offset some of that</p><p>that that light that&rsquo;s coming off the</p><p>computer which is not full-spectrum it&rsquo;s</p><p>pretty bad so I went through my office</p><p>and I&rsquo;m just like finding everything</p><p>like it&rsquo;s all around me these electric</p><p>power cables and when you when you&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping make sure you don&rsquo;t have any</p><p>electrical devices by your head now keep</p><p>them away and then maybe you want to</p><p>sleep in a tent in your backyard</p><p>this really does affect</p><p>yeah my husband says it&rsquo;s like me in</p><p>jackboots in a single lightbulb over his</p><p>head okay have you tried changing</p><p>yourself sitting at the computer</p><p>capacity yeah so basically we want to</p><p>undo some of the adrenal damage kind of</p><p>because see some people can&rsquo;t sleep yet</p><p>during the day they&rsquo;re so tired but they</p><p>can&rsquo;t sleep that was my problem that was</p><p>my problem with 20s I was exhausted but</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t say there was nights i didn&rsquo;t</p><p>sleep one minute i dark circles i would</p><p>lay there and i&rsquo;m like twelve one two</p><p>three it was torture</p><p>it was torture so I know what that feels</p><p>like and it was terrible</p><p>okay so let me get back to the slides</p><p>here okay this is a this is a picture of</p><p>you thinking about your son&rsquo;s bad grades</p><p>the dishes um cleaning your inbox at</p><p>work right look familiar</p><p>Tyra can&rsquo;t sleep so you get on your</p><p>computer in the middle of the night bad</p><p>idea you should read a book I&rsquo;m</p><p>fortunate these computers are really</p><p>kind of kind of wiring our bodies in our</p><p>nervous system because we&rsquo;re staring at</p><p>just this this thing about two feet away</p><p>from us and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a picture you&rsquo;re</p><p>looking at pictures and these pictures</p><p>are stuck there even when you go to</p><p>sleep and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you you</p><p>need to get out and walk and get outside</p><p>um maybe you&rsquo;re here&rsquo;s another symptom</p><p>of adrenal low endurance like you just</p><p>don&rsquo;t have the stamina you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>the endurance um loss of strength you</p><p>climb up stairs and you&rsquo;re out of breath</p><p>your legs are heavier</p><p>craving salty chips that&rsquo;s an adrenal</p><p>symptom right so there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>nutritional things that you can do one</p><p>is potassium but I like to get that from</p><p>the food lots of vegetables magnesium</p><p>you get it from the food same thing a</p><p>lot of vegetables magnesium will help</p><p>the heart a lot especially for blood</p><p>pressure the B vitamins are essential b1</p><p>b3 b5 this one&rsquo;s a really important one</p><p>for the adrenal and b6 b5 and b6 are</p><p>kind of like that cofactors in a lot of</p><p>hormones and neurotransmitters that help</p><p>you sleep so those are really those are</p><p>burned up during stress and then of</p><p>course vitamin C because vitamin C</p><p>basically makes you beat the adrenal so</p><p>it helps the the production of adrenal</p><p>hormones and most of the vitamin C in</p><p>your body is stored in the adrenal and</p><p>so stress can deplete vitamin C best</p><p>vitamin C you can consume would be in</p><p>bell peppers and green beans believe it</p><p>or not so here we go exercise right go</p><p>for the best for sleep is long walks I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking like an hour just getting space</p><p>not listening to music just getting to a</p><p>park looking at stuff the problem is</p><p>it&rsquo;s getting darker and we can&rsquo;t do that</p><p>right now so yes I do exercise in the</p><p>dark on my bike with lights but it is a</p><p>problem unfortunately so you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>probably have to take a little vitamin D</p><p>vitamin k2 because it&rsquo;s getting dark but</p><p>you want to maybe spend a little time</p><p>maybe at your lunch for a walk to get</p><p>outside and you see me in this left</p><p>slide I&rsquo;m looking at things you need</p><p>space that is what we need when you</p><p>exercise you you stress your body and</p><p>then you recover with sleep you don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to spike your pulse rate too much</p><p>you wanna a low stress long duration</p><p>type of exercise where you&rsquo;re calm and</p><p>you&rsquo;re feeling good and you there&rsquo;s no</p><p>stress that would be the best thing get</p><p>out there and go walk and and get space</p><p>um the other thing is that how many of</p><p>you work</p><p>athletes in your former life when you&rsquo;re</p><p>growing up or let&rsquo;s say high school or</p><p>college how many were like very athletic</p><p>and as you&rsquo;re typing I&rsquo;m going to answer</p><p>some questions is it okay to walk in the</p><p>morning for dinner</p><p>totally fine now if you have pain with</p><p>your back Jane you can&rsquo;t walk far I</p><p>suggest you go to my website and get</p><p>that pain program that I have that you</p><p>can do it yourself and help help with</p><p>pain and I do a lot of demonstrations</p><p>with that so we can get rid of your pain</p><p>um yeah so there&rsquo;s some people that were</p><p>athletic some people were not well the</p><p>point that I&rsquo;m making with the athletes</p><p>is if you go through your like early</p><p>time and you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve done some intense</p><p>workouts we like even myself college</p><p>wrestling pushing myself and then I</p><p>stopped working out for ten years my</p><p>mitochondria are so big so I can</p><p>generate a lot of energy if I go to work</p><p>and go to bed at night</p><p>there&rsquo;s too much energy in my body so I</p><p>physically every single day have to</p><p>extract this energy by working out and</p><p>so I&rsquo;m doing all sorts yeah Tracy was in</p><p>the reserves 20s yeah I was five years</p><p>in Army Reserves Fort Jackson South</p><p>Carolina but what happens is that I have</p><p>to physically workout now to extract</p><p>energy so every day I ride my bike I run</p><p>I do all sorts of things my backyard I&rsquo;m</p><p>lifting these logs right now they&rsquo;re</p><p>very heavy across the lawn and I&rsquo;m</p><p>cutting cutting wood so for me that&rsquo;s</p><p>the best thing for my body because I can</p><p>and I&rsquo;m also doing those ropes where you</p><p>actually go back and forth on the tree</p><p>I&rsquo;ll actually did do a video on that</p><p>that&rsquo;s a really good workout um now</p><p>Lindsey says for the last several years</p><p>she hasn&rsquo;t had no motivation to exercise</p><p>to workout and I&rsquo;m only 31 years old</p><p>yeah well I think what you have to do</p><p>Lindsey is really work on your sleep and</p><p>and your BA and your foods in nutrition</p><p>first okay so you can generate the</p><p>energy to be able to work out okay</p><p>because I don&rsquo;t recommend working out</p><p>unless you have the energy but I do want</p><p>you to walk you can always walk ok so so</p><p>in other words if you an athlete you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to physically exercise</p><p>every day more intensely to get the</p><p>energy out maybe you might need to keep</p><p>your pulse rate low if you can&rsquo;t if</p><p>you&rsquo;re not recovering um but that&rsquo;s</p><p>basically what you have to do now the</p><p>other thing I want to mention</p><p>yeah chopping wood is I mean I can for</p><p>me my body was designed to chop wood I</p><p>can do that all day I just love it my</p><p>body loves that chopping wood so as my</p><p>wife she likes me chopping wood</p><p>um ok so the other point I want to make</p><p>with sleeping is some people have a</p><p>breathing problem they&rsquo;re not breathing</p><p>that well they&rsquo;re like air hunger there</p><p>sighing frequently and that could be</p><p>because two reasons one that is more of</p><p>an acidosis type thing because when</p><p>you&rsquo;re on a ketosis diet you&rsquo;re burning</p><p>fat your pH will become more acidic and</p><p>I just did a video on that of people too</p><p>alkaline but you can be more acidic too</p><p>and the breathing what you do is if you</p><p>if you take calcium magnesium just one</p><p>on an empty stomach or before bed that</p><p>will help your breathing if that&rsquo;s what</p><p>it is</p><p>okay other reasons why you can&rsquo;t breathe</p><p>our vitamin C deficiency is severe</p><p>vitamin C deficiency where you have</p><p>bleeding gums to Beca beer or spider</p><p>veins so you want to consume a food base</p><p>vitamin C for that ok so that&rsquo;s just</p><p>some tips on that let me just kind of go</p><p>right here Oh</p><p>is a picture of the full spectrum light</p><p>you can get it ordered on Amazon or just</p><p>get it it&rsquo;s called natural light balance</p><p>like I would get one for your office and</p><p>then for you you know just to cutting so</p><p>you can get some of this light in your</p><p>face so if you don&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t go</p><p>outside you can least get a dose of this</p><p>stuff okay so let&rsquo;s talk about stress</p><p>extraction there is an acupressure</p><p>technique many of you have been on my</p><p>other webinars you&rsquo;ve seen me talk about</p><p>acupressure you know it&rsquo;s so funny</p><p>though if anyone thinks acupressure is</p><p>weird</p><p>it is not weird how else are you going</p><p>to extract your body stress you have to</p><p>physically manually pull it out and we</p><p>deal with acupressure acupressure is not</p><p>weird like versus what&rsquo;s weird to me is</p><p>taking a pill taking a drug but</p><p>acupressure is I&rsquo;m not talking about</p><p>like traditional acupressure I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about the acupressure that that I</p><p>developed because I basically work on</p><p>the different stress points okay but</p><p>those points you can create some serious</p><p>improvement very fast by extracting</p><p>stress now the point that I want to talk</p><p>about is right in the brainstem back</p><p>here you see that point back there and</p><p>it&rsquo;s called the look locus coeruleus in</p><p>there appendicular</p><p>now what the heck does that mean those</p><p>are two little centers that control the</p><p>sleep and awake patterns of your body so</p><p>you take you see this try this is a</p><p>tripod you got the thin one you got the</p><p>wide one and the medium you did for</p><p>different people I&rsquo;m going to take the</p><p>wide one I&rsquo;m going to stick it on these</p><p>points right back here about the</p><p>brainstem and I&rsquo;m going to sit back and</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to kick up my feet and I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to just lay here for about two</p><p>minutes and I do this every night before</p><p>I go to sleep I do this acupressure tool</p><p>and I&rsquo;m going to hit those points for</p><p>about two minutes and I&rsquo;m just going to</p><p>let go unconscious because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p><p>it stimulates natural you don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>put electric things in your in your head</p><p>you can just do it manually and it</p><p>relaxes the tension in the back of the</p><p>neck and the whole spine relaxes you can</p><p>sleep really good so that&rsquo;s one point</p><p>this</p><p>other points I&rsquo;m going to show you too</p><p>you know you can take your thumbs</p><p>impress those points it&rsquo;s more difficult</p><p>like this but you can sort of do it if</p><p>your if your shoulders are okay I use a</p><p>salt I use my couch actually and then</p><p>I&rsquo;ll go in my bedroom and I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll do</p><p>these points right here okay now these</p><p>points are the adrenal points I&rsquo;ll start</p><p>with my right side and I&rsquo;ll work out</p><p>this point and then I&rsquo;ll work out this</p><p>point and I&rsquo;ll work at this point and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll slowly work up this side and then</p><p>I&rsquo;ll slowly work up this side and I&rsquo;ll</p><p>find pockets of tension that I&rsquo;ll work</p><p>out and and then I&rsquo;ll do my mid-back so</p><p>there&rsquo;s several things that you can do</p><p>to help extract the stress from the</p><p>adrenals and I&rsquo;ll show you the book that</p><p>I have on it and I&rsquo;ll show you where you</p><p>can get the device in a minute but the</p><p>point is that these are the adrenal</p><p>points and all of you should do these</p><p>points every night if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping so you can actually but I</p><p>actually do it on myself but I&rsquo;m doing</p><p>on someone else there too okay I just</p><p>have to touch on this this is really</p><p>cool</p><p>I want you to type in um if you&rsquo;ve ever</p><p>had an injury to your head skull injury</p><p>so type in if you&rsquo;ve ever had a head</p><p>injury where your head hits the cement</p><p>or even unconscious or your head hits</p><p>something because I&rsquo;ll tell you one</p><p>thing um if you had an old head injury</p><p>that could be the reason why you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping and why is that</p><p>I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of people</p><p>that I&rsquo;ve run across where I&rsquo;m doing all</p><p>the normal things and all of a sudden I</p><p>hit the skull points</p><p>I&rsquo;ll do the acupressure and skull points</p><p>and boom they go right to sleep so let</p><p>me show you something you got these</p><p>sutures that come through here and right</p><p>through in here</p><p>and you can actually press down down</p><p>into these sutures and start really</p><p>working these points with your thumb you</p><p>can have someone do it too and that&rsquo;ll</p><p>give you a lot of relief in your skull</p><p>but the key is this if you hit your head</p><p>let&rsquo;s say on this side then you want to</p><p>press into the injury or you can press</p><p>on the opposite side right here if you</p><p>hit your head right here you want to</p><p>press down into the injury if you hit</p><p>your head back here you want to press</p><p>down an injury or the opposite side</p><p>don&rsquo;t press where you hit your head</p><p>press on the opposite side when that</p><p>your skull is really relaxed and you can</p><p>actually you can even use this thing</p><p>right here you can kind of come into the</p><p>same gently press forward and work on</p><p>the sutures it basically opens the whole</p><p>skull and your head just feels so</p><p>comfortable so it&rsquo;s something that oh</p><p>well all of you have had concussions oh</p><p>my gosh full of ladder yeah so I think</p><p>some of you are going to need more</p><p>advanced work and I have them a lot of</p><p>you listening what came flew out who did</p><p>came to my seminar I did it&rsquo;s a</p><p>four-hour seminar I have it all recorded</p><p>it&rsquo;s on my website you can you have to</p><p>purchase it but it&rsquo;s a course that you</p><p>can take on acupressure I teach you</p><p>everything I teach you all the adrenal</p><p>points all the advanced adrenal points</p><p>I&rsquo;m showing you some superficial things</p><p>right now and if you if you if you have</p><p>a serious problem you need to get that</p><p>and that will help you and it&rsquo;s um I</p><p>condensed I took out all the silent</p><p>period so it&rsquo;s actually only three hours</p><p>but it&rsquo;s some pretty powerful stuff</p><p>because I actually give you all the</p><p>techniques in that and you go send the</p><p>shopping cart all the way down on the</p><p>left hand side dr. Burke advanced</p><p>acupressure okay so now next thing when</p><p>I get into is let me find this thing</p><p>here oh this is a</p><p>here I did a seminar this is recently</p><p>and I&rsquo;ll send you the slides you can</p><p>click click this later but we are able</p><p>to demonstrate these techniques and</p><p>everywhere in the room it was amazing</p><p>and you&rsquo;ll see that before and afters</p><p>and then I had everyone practiced it so</p><p>they loved it</p><p>now I&rsquo;m going to talk about supplement</p><p>support um and then this is a this is</p><p>called the stress kit there&rsquo;s an adrenal</p><p>formula there&rsquo;s a night formula and a</p><p>lot of you that are listening already</p><p>have these products but I&rsquo;m just going</p><p>to show you if you don&rsquo;t this is the</p><p>tool you can get up that link and it</p><p>comes with this one and this one right</p><p>here now this one you take one before</p><p>bed if you have a real seriously</p><p>problems you take two this has all the</p><p>food for the adrenal to actually help</p><p>calm the adrenal down helps the recovery</p><p>helps the neurotransmitters it has every</p><p>single nutrient to support the</p><p>precursors to the neurotransmitters it</p><p>does not have melatonin I didn&rsquo;t want</p><p>that in there because that messes up the</p><p>gland that&rsquo;s a hormone this has</p><p>glandular extract for the adrenal and</p><p>the pituitary so it&rsquo;s pretty serious</p><p>adrenal stuff and then and also you</p><p>might want to take one maybe two before</p><p>bed and you will be sleeping better</p><p>sometimes if you if you have a bad</p><p>problem and you need like let&rsquo;s say you</p><p>wake up at 4:00 you can take one more</p><p>and then really go to sleep now this one</p><p>this one&rsquo;s during the day and you take 3</p><p>to 6 so this handles like stress it has</p><p>all of the natural B vitamins there&rsquo;s no</p><p>synthetics but and it comes from</p><p>nutritional yeast but not the type of</p><p>yeast that gives you a yeast infection a</p><p>lot of times people when they get</p><p>nutritional yeast the end up with a</p><p>yeast thing like an overgrowth this one</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have that version ok so it&rsquo;s</p><p>pretty pretty awesome it has to be 5</p><p>would be 3 to be 6 to be 1 so this is</p><p>really good in combination with this for</p><p>sleep and stress okay so you&rsquo;ll feel</p><p>calm and your tolerance for incompetent</p><p>people will go way way up so all three</p><p>of those</p><p>and then the book if you don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>book and you have my device already just</p><p>call us we&rsquo;ll send you one and you can</p><p>also get the download too but we send</p><p>this out and it goes through all the</p><p>stress points right here so that is what</p><p>what you want to do so um let me just</p><p>pull this up again yeah so basically for</p><p>those of you that don&rsquo;t have this you</p><p>need to get this because this will</p><p>handle the adrenals from two different</p><p>angles from a nutritional angle and from</p><p>a stress angle you&rsquo;ll learn a technique</p><p>to pull stress out and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the</p><p>most popular kit and it&rsquo;ll roto-rooter</p><p>any type of adrenal issues that you have</p><p>nutritionally this is just the formula</p><p>right here all the different things it</p><p>has in it GABA um for toe root root</p><p>which is amazing it has a food base</p><p>vitamin-c complex anterior pituitary not</p><p>the posterior the answer to help that</p><p>whole pathway so it&rsquo;s some serious</p><p>nutrition for the adrenal and then the</p><p>day formula has a combination of a lot</p><p>of different types of potassium minerals</p><p>as well as calcium magnesium and</p><p>nutritional herbal things for the stress</p><p>from the adrenal so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what</p><p>that has in it let me just come back</p><p>here let me just pull up something for</p><p>you see here</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to find this thing here okay</p><p>yeah third is okay so yeah so basically</p><p>that&rsquo;s the stress kit for those of you</p><p>they&rsquo;re asking how can I get those</p><p>products go ahead and get that if you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have that end we&rsquo;ll ship it out</p><p>like tomorrow and you start taking it in</p><p>the meantime use an end of a brush for</p><p>your adrenals</p><p>and start working on them don&rsquo;t use a</p><p>knife like that you know you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>hurt yourself because someone has some</p><p>questions how late in the day should I</p><p>take the adrenal day formula you can</p><p>take that one</p><p>all the way up until dinnertime is not a</p><p>problem um let&rsquo;s see here okay so let&rsquo;s</p><p>see here oh yeah is it suitable for</p><p>vegetarians absolutely now the gland the</p><p>adrenal day formula has in it vegetarian</p><p>products but the adrenal night formula</p><p>does have some glandular extracts but I</p><p>have a lot of vegetarians that consumer</p><p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have hormones it&rsquo;s</p><p>organic and it basically it really helps</p><p>them sleep because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a little</p><p>bit difficult to take something without</p><p>those glandulars and have it really work</p><p>well because you don&rsquo;t want to take one</p><p>glandulars with hormones too um let&rsquo;s</p><p>see here would it be safe to take if you</p><p>add cortisol for drain for yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>basically designed to lower and balance</p><p>cortisol so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s for people that</p><p>have high cortisol levels do the adrenal</p><p>supplements have any side effects like</p><p>skin darkening no no no because it</p><p>improves the adrenal what causes the</p><p>skin darkening is um low cortisol like</p><p>really excessively low cortisol that&rsquo;s</p><p>Addison&rsquo;s disease</p><p>this just balances it to a normal level</p><p>um Mary since I take the adrenal d-day</p><p>formula it&rsquo;s amazing how much calmer I</p><p>feel when I take it yeah it&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>and plus the quality of the bees in</p><p>there are so good I mean it just helps</p><p>with all the the different chemical</p><p>reactions that occur because when you go</p><p>through stress you deplete your bees so</p><p>it really helps with a lot of different</p><p>things for health and sleeping um</p><p>someone said the screen has not moved in</p><p>last 15 minutes well I&rsquo;ll send you the</p><p>link because it is working another other</p><p>people can see it on the supplements</p><p>gluten-free and non-gmo of course they</p><p>are I am very much against GMO and</p><p>gluten so yes melatonin is that bad well</p><p>yeah because it&rsquo;s a hormone it does work</p><p>but the problem is when any time you</p><p>think about this melatonin is stimulated</p><p>by darkness melatonin stimulates and</p><p>converts to serotonin which goes through</p><p>this whole cascade of sleep patterns</p><p>when you take melatonin directly it</p><p>causes the pineal gland not to have to</p><p>work anymore making you dependent on the</p><p>melatonin so now the pineal gland starts</p><p>to shrink more and more and more and</p><p>more to the point where it dries up and</p><p>you don&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore and</p><p>you need one more melatonin to achieve</p><p>that so it kind of it throws off it&rsquo;s</p><p>not the best thing to take in the world</p><p>I mean you can take it on a short-term</p><p>basis but I don&rsquo;t like it very good</p><p>questions how truly</p><p>operation date well these are on some of</p><p>them have expiration dates some of them</p><p>I have the manufacturing date and</p><p>they&rsquo;re good for three years after the</p><p>manufacturing date but they&rsquo;re actually</p><p>good for you the longer because I I&rsquo;ve</p><p>taken some of mine for a long time and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll like I won&rsquo;t take them and I&rsquo;ll</p><p>take them they still work but you know I</p><p>mean it&rsquo;s good for at least three years</p><p>um you said three to six a day on the</p><p>adrenal day oh okay so you want to take</p><p>if you if you want to see a dramatic</p><p>results do 2 to 2 with meals ok as the</p><p>maintenance do one one one but this will</p><p>create some calmness I mean I saw this</p><p>husband and wife and the wife was very</p><p>stressed out so I told husband I said</p><p>give her one of these before shillings</p><p>and then put her in the back seat she&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna want to take a nap because she</p><p>just she was so high-strung so it just</p><p>calmed right down and he came back and</p><p>he Isis how did she do she goes would be</p><p>you&rsquo;re right she just like wanted to</p><p>take a nap she felt so calm but it&rsquo;s not</p><p>necessarily for fatigue it will calm the</p><p>Drina &rsquo;ls and you&rsquo;ll feel more relaxed</p><p>so you can sleep that night um are the B</p><p>vitamins methylated well guess what</p><p>they&rsquo;re naturally method ated because</p><p>they&rsquo;re all from nutritional yeast but</p><p>they&rsquo;re they don&rsquo;t have the part that</p><p>creates the yeast overgrowth so yes</p><p>they&rsquo;re natural they&rsquo;re not made</p><p>synthetically you don&rsquo;t want to consume</p><p>synthetic B vitamins and it&rsquo;s hard to</p><p>find natural beauty items so yes these</p><p>are the real deal and that&rsquo;s why I</p><p>wanted to create something with natural</p><p>developments how much time taking the</p><p>formula can I see the sleeping proof it</p><p>should work the first time you take it</p><p>ok this one I like to take a half hour</p><p>to an hour before I go to bed so I can</p><p>wind down</p><p>but you don&rsquo;t need more than two okay</p><p>and then you do the acupressure on</p><p>yourself as well there are seven places</p><p>when you do the acupressure you do the</p><p>next point you do the adrenals you do</p><p>there&rsquo;s other points that you would use</p><p>and then you can take it where you go</p><p>but a lot of people love this thing and</p><p>it just helps them sleep I I created</p><p>this for myself because I had a sleeping</p><p>problem and and I said I wanted to be</p><p>able to treat myself so that was pretty</p><p>cool and I also give you a link to show</p><p>you what to do to get rid of old</p><p>injuries of your head Addison&rsquo;s disease</p><p>is a low adrenal and the remedies for</p><p>high adrenal and Load renal are the same</p><p>so you do the same protocol for high low</p><p>because it&rsquo;s still a stress case can I</p><p>give my adrenal day to my</p><p>seventeen-year-old absolutely yeah</p><p>there&rsquo;s not really an age limit</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s there is magnesium and</p><p>calcium in the adrenal support but you</p><p>can always take extra not a problem the</p><p>only thing I&rsquo;m against is taking too</p><p>much calcium and calcium carbonate</p><p>that&rsquo;s limestone do not take calcium</p><p>carbonate ever that&rsquo;s very bad what</p><p>about using 5-htp 5-htp is a precursor</p><p>to l-tryptophan which turns into</p><p>tryptophan which is turns in the</p><p>serotonin it&rsquo;s the whole pathway I like</p><p>that I like health tryptophan I like</p><p>5-hydroxytryptophan the ingredients in</p><p>here work a lot better but sometimes I</p><p>might use both if I want to create a</p><p>even a bigger effect like let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m</p><p>flying across the country and I had to</p><p>ask I need to go to bed a certain time</p><p>I&rsquo;ll take this in l-tryptophan five</p><p>hydroxy 5-htp basically will will work</p><p>but I like l-tryptophan a little bit</p><p>better if I&rsquo;m going to be traveling</p><p>because it&rsquo;s stronger because 5-htp</p><p>turns into l-tryptophan</p><p>really says I had one of those bulbs and</p><p>it made a huge difference well that is</p><p>awesome I love it and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t forget</p><p>as you actually improve things don&rsquo;t</p><p>forget to take a nap - because it&rsquo;s okay</p><p>to take naps to try to recover this the</p><p>B vitamins in folic acid what are the B</p><p>vitamins</p><p>well folic acid is one of the B vitamins</p><p>and folic acid is in the adrenal de</p><p>formula as well uh will the adrenal</p><p>day-and-night work if I work out nights</p><p>absolutely it will work what about</p><p>taking out tryptophan with adrenal night</p><p>yeah yeah you can take that now that</p><p>would enhance enhance the sleep effect</p><p>really this is how much longer is the</p><p>web webinar going to be not very much</p><p>longer</p><p>I&rsquo;m just going to answer a couple more</p><p>questions because I plan on doing one</p><p>hour and it went over again when you</p><p>think about valerian root valerian root</p><p>makes me feel kind of tired you know</p><p>when I wake up groggy I need to eat</p><p>something with adrenal formula because</p><p>my heartburn yeah you probably need to</p><p>eat something with that not a problem</p><p>but if you eat the problem with</p><p>l-tryptophan if you eat protein with it</p><p>it won&rsquo;t work so you have to not eat</p><p>protein without tryptophan that&rsquo;s an</p><p>amino acid it won&rsquo;t go in just a little</p><p>side them so why not take glandulars</p><p>with hormones like melatonin because</p><p>it&rsquo;s going to inactivate your own gland</p><p>any time you take a hormone your glands</p><p>don&rsquo;t have to work anymore</p><p>so that&rsquo;s the problem so I want to thank</p><p>you guys for coming on my webinar I hope</p><p>you
