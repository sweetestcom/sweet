    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking about the science of heat,</p>
<p>and more specifically, the science of heating, the verb,</p>
<p>meaning how our body heats up</p>
<p>from both the outside and the inside.</p>
<p>Heat is a remarkable stimulus,</p>
<p>meaning when we are in a hot environment,</p>
<p>it has a profound effect on our biology.</p>
<p>And heating up from the outside,</p>
<p>or as you&rsquo;ll soon learn, from the inside,</p>
<p>has a profound effect on many different aspects</p>
<p>of our health, including our metabolism,</p>
<p>both in the immediate and long-term,</p>
<p>our cognition, meaning our ability to think</p>
<p>more or less clearly,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re immediately thinking</p>
<p>that heating up makes you less capable of thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Heat applied properly as a stimulus</p>
<p>can engage certain neurochemical systems</p>
<p>in your brain and body</p>
<p>that can allow your brain to function far better.</p>
<p>We will talk about those data today.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about the science of heat and heating,</p>
<p>both in terms of their mechanisms,</p>
<p>and as I know many of you are interested in,</p>
<p>the tools related to the use of heat,</p>
<p>things like sauna, how often to do sauna,</p>
<p>how long to be in the sauna,</p>
<p>how hot to be in the sauna</p>
<p>for particular goals and outcomes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about the very exciting new science</p>
<p>around local heating,</p>
<p>that is the use of heat applied to specific areas</p>
<p>of the body in order to heal or improve tissues</p>
<p>at that location that you are heating,</p>
<p>as well as your biology and health overall.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to talk about</p>
<p>one very recently published paper</p>
<p>that came out in the journal Cell.</p>
<p>Cell is one of the three apex journals,</p>
<p>meaning three of the most competitive,</p>
<p>most rigorous scientific journals.</p>
<p>Those are Nature, Science, and Cell.</p>
<p>This particular paper was published in Cell,</p>
<p>and I will go into it in more detail later,</p>
<p>but basically what this paper shows</p>
<p>is that by locally heating up skin and fat,</p>
<p>you can change the identity of certain fat cells</p>
<p>at that location and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We have three kinds of fat,</p>
<p>white fat, beige fat, and brown fat.</p>
<p>And as you will learn more about soon,</p>
<p>white fat is not very metabolically active.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a fuel reserve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we typically think of as blubbery fat.</p>
<p>Beige fat and brown fat are rich in mitochondria,</p>
<p>and those mitochondria provide a sort of furnace</p>
<p>or heating mechanism for your entire body</p>
<p>and increase your metabolism and the burning of white fat.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>having more beige fat and brown fat is a good thing.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the proper application</p>
<p>of heat to specific areas of your body</p>
<p>can increase the conversion of white fat to beige fat.</p>
<p>In other words, turn an innocuous fuel source</p>
<p>into a metabolically active tissue</p>
<p>that can help you burn off more white fat.</p>
<p>I think many people are going to be interested</p>
<p>in this paper and the tools that emerge from this paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating set of findings</p>
<p>that actually emerged from my understanding</p>
<p>of the biology of burn and people who receive intense burns.</p>
<p>And that is not what I&rsquo;m going to recommend to you</p>
<p>as a tool, of course,</p>
<p>but understanding a little bit</p>
<p>about how burns impact our biology and health</p>
<p>has allowed these pioneering researchers</p>
<p>to develop new tools to combat obesity</p>
<p>and metabolic disorders,</p>
<p>and that you can apply for basic things like fat loss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>Our motivation for partnering with Momentous</p>
<p>is to provide people one location where they can go</p>
<p>to access the highest quality supplements</p>
<p>in the specific dosages that are best supported</p>
<p>by the scientific research and that are discussed</p>
<p>during various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will see those formulations.</p>
<p>I should mention that we are going to add more formulations</p>
<p>in the months to come,</p>
<p>and you will see specific suggestions</p>
<p>about how best to take those supplements,</p>
<p>meaning what dosages and times of day,</p>
<p>and in fact, how to combine those supplements</p>
<p>with specific behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that have been discussed on the podcast</p>
<p>and are science supported in order to derive</p>
<p>the maximum benefit from those supplements.</p>
<p>And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn</p>
<p>that Momentous ships not just within the United States,</p>
<p>but also internationally.</p>
<p>So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>you will find what we firmly believe</p>
<p>to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages</p>
<p>and the best protocols for taking those supplements</p>
<p>along with the ideal behavioral protocols</p>
<p>to combine with those supplement formulations.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about heat.</p>
<p>More specifically, let&rsquo;s talk about the biology</p>
<p>of heat and heating and the health benefits</p>
<p>and tools related to heat and heating.</p>
<p>The first question that we have to answer</p>
<p>is how do we heat up?</p>
<p>And the answer to that question is we heat up two ways.</p>
<p>We heat up from the outside,</p>
<p>meaning the things that we come into contact with,</p>
<p>the clothing that we put on our body,</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s heat in the room</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s cold outside or cold in a room,</p>
<p>and we heat up from the inside.</p>
<p>Our body has the capacity to generate more heat</p>
<p>or to cool down, meaning to turn off the heating process,</p>
<p>and it can do that in ways</p>
<p>that match the external environment.</p>
<p>The simplest way to think about this</p>
<p>is that we actually have two body temperatures.</p>
<p>People will say, oh, what&rsquo;s body temperature, 98.6.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not true.</p>
<p>Body temperature varies between individuals.</p>
<p>It varies across time of day within individuals.</p>
<p>And at every point across your entire lifespan,</p>
<p>you have two distinct temperatures.</p>
<p>One is the temperature on your skin,</p>
<p>what scientists call your shell,</p>
<p>and the temperature of your core, your viscera,</p>
<p>meaning your organs, your nervous system,</p>
<p>and your spinal cord.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, the temperature of your core</p>
<p>is always higher than the temperature at your surface.</p>
<p>So the important thing to know</p>
<p>is that you have a temperature at your shell</p>
<p>and a temperature at your core.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t need to know exactly</p>
<p>what those temperatures are in most cases,</p>
<p>but it is vitally important to understand</p>
<p>that you have those two temperatures</p>
<p>and that your brain is constantly sending out signals</p>
<p>to your body as to whether or not it should heat up</p>
<p>or cool down depending on the temperature of the shell,</p>
<p>which makes total sense.</p>
<p>This is a lot like a thermostat in a room,</p>
<p>which is essentially paying attention</p>
<p>to how cold or hot it is,</p>
<p>and then sending signals to the heating or cooling system</p>
<p>to either heat up the environment</p>
<p>or cool down the environment</p>
<p>depending on the temperature in that environment.</p>
<p>Your brain has neurons that send signals</p>
<p>to other cells in your body</p>
<p>and deploy the release of chemicals in your brain and body</p>
<p>to heat you up when you are too cold</p>
<p>and to cool you down when you are too hot.</p>
<p>So, if you can understand</p>
<p>that you have two body temperatures,</p>
<p>one at your shell, the surface,</p>
<p>and one at your core, inside,</p>
<p>and that your body and brain</p>
<p>are always trying to balance those two temperatures</p>
<p>in the appropriate way,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re halfway there</p>
<p>to understanding the biology</p>
<p>of thermal regulation and heating,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be a lot further along</p>
<p>in understanding how specific tools can be used</p>
<p>to improve metabolism or improve cognition, for instance.</p>
<p>In fact, later you will learn</p>
<p>that one way that you can heat up</p>
<p>is by cooling down the surface of your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If I were to throw a cold towel,</p>
<p>ice cold towel onto your torso right now and ask you,</p>
<p>well, how do you feel?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, oh, that&rsquo;s cold, that&rsquo;s chilly.</p>
<p>However, because your brain is acting</p>
<p>like a bit of a thermostat as the surface,</p>
<p>the shell of your body felt cool,</p>
<p>it would make sense that that thermostat</p>
<p>would activate biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that would heat up your core.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I were to put you</p>
<p>into a very hot environment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, oh, wow, it&rsquo;s really, really warm in here,</p>
<p>but your brain and your body would go through</p>
<p>a lot of effort to activate mechanisms to cool you down.</p>
<p>So anytime we&rsquo;re talking about heat,</p>
<p>meaning deliberate heat exposure, things like sauna,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to understand not just the stimulus,</p>
<p>how hot something is, how long you&rsquo;re in a sauna, et cetera,</p>
<p>but the effect that has on your shell and on your core.</p>
<p>If you can understand that,</p>
<p>you can design protocols that are literally perfect</p>
<p>for your goals.</p>
<p>And as a final point about this,</p>
<p>if you want to develop the best tools,</p>
<p>leveraging heat for your biology and health and performance,</p>
<p>you want to understand heat as a process,</p>
<p>as a verb, as heating, not just heat,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the temperature that you are at</p>
<p>before you encounter the heat stimulus,</p>
<p>before you get in the sauna, for instance,</p>
<p>during the heat stimulus, so while you&rsquo;re in the sauna,</p>
<p>and then afterward.</p>
<p>Everything in biology is a process.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>there is a specific sauna protocol that can allow you,</p>
<p>can allow anybody, in fact,</p>
<p>to increase the amount of growth hormone</p>
<p>released into their brain and body 16 fold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, 16 fold.</p>
<p>However, it involves shifting from a hot environment</p>
<p>to a cool environment, to a hot environment,</p>
<p>to a cool environment over and over and over again,</p>
<p>over a very short period of time,</p>
<p>because it engages a switch, a process that compounds,</p>
<p>it builds on itself to increase growth hormone</p>
<p>further and further.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were to just get into a sauna</p>
<p>for a very long period of time and crank up the temperature</p>
<p>to match the exact temperature that was used in that study,</p>
<p>you would not experience those increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>It really is the transition between hot</p>
<p>and cool temperatures that engage the process</p>
<p>of heating and reheating over and over again.</p>
<p>So today you&rsquo;re going to learn about the use of sauna.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn about the use</p>
<p>of other heat related tools for health and optimization,</p>
<p>not just for growth hormone,</p>
<p>but also metabolic health for controlling cortisol,</p>
<p>even to impact mental health in positive ways.</p>
<p>And in order to do that,</p>
<p>you need to understand a little bit about the mechanisms</p>
<p>of how you heat up and how you cool down,</p>
<p>where the cells and circuits are in the brain and body,</p>
<p>how those cells and circuits work.</p>
<p>I promise to make the description of that,</p>
<p>which follows very clear,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology.</p>
<p>And once you have that in hand,</p>
<p>along with the understanding you now have</p>
<p>about the fact that you got a shell and a core,</p>
<p>and you need to think about both the shell and the core,</p>
<p>well, then you will be in the best possible position</p>
<p>to use sauna or hot tub or other tools,</p>
<p>even just a hot shower as a powerful stimulus</p>
<p>to optimize your biology.</p>
<p>Now, the science of heat and heating and cold and cooling,</p>
<p>for that matter, goes back well over a hundred years.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s kind of amusing to me that nowadays</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of renewed interest</p>
<p>in the use of heat and cold</p>
<p>and the science of heat and cold,</p>
<p>because this was the first topic</p>
<p>that I studied as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>And in fact, I did my graduate thesis on thermal regulation.</p>
<p>And at the time,</p>
<p>thermal regulation wasn&rsquo;t really considered</p>
<p>one of the hot topics in neuroscience.</p>
<p>People were more focused on things like memory</p>
<p>and consciousness.</p>
<p>And of course, those topics are still a vital interest</p>
<p>to many people in many laboratories.</p>
<p>But thermal regulation was considered more,</p>
<p>you know, a thing for the physiologists.</p>
<p>Nowadays, not just on social media,</p>
<p>not just in the landscape of biohackers and athletes,</p>
<p>but in the landscape of mental health,</p>
<p>and frankly, in the general ethos</p>
<p>around health optimization,</p>
<p>people are really interested in heat and cold.</p>
<p>And the reason they&rsquo;re so interested in heat and cold</p>
<p>is that a lot of the science has been done</p>
<p>both in animal models and mice and in humans,</p>
<p>and translates immediately to protocols</p>
<p>that anyone can use.</p>
<p>Now, a brief warning now, and another brief warning later,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re talking about heating up your body,</p>
<p>you need to be very cautious,</p>
<p>because unlike cooling down,</p>
<p>where you have a fairly broad range of cold temperatures</p>
<p>that you can go into before it&rsquo;s damaging to tissue,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t get to heat up the brain and body very much</p>
<p>before you start getting into the realm of neuron damage.</p>
<p>And neurons in the central nervous system,</p>
<p>the brain and spinal cord, once they&rsquo;re damaged,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>So hyperthermia is a serious thing to avoid.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll talk about ways to rapidly protect</p>
<p>against hyperthermia.</p>
<p>But I do want to give everybody a cautionary note upfront.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re pregnant, nursing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very sensitive to hot environments,</p>
<p>you want to stay out of saunas and things of that sort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are exceptions to that.</p>
<p>You definitely have to talk to your doctor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to violate that rule.</p>
<p>And for everybody, you want to approach any kind of tool</p>
<p>related to heating very cautiously.</p>
<p>You always have the opportunity</p>
<p>to increase the temperature later.</p>
<p>So proceed with caution, be smart about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect me.</p>
<p>I say that also to protect you.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about what are the circuits</p>
<p>for heating up?</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>Many of you have probably experienced a fever.</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>What happens when you go into a cold environment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re shivering, but you put on a coat</p>
<p>and then you feel warmer?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really going on there?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a very basic circuit,</p>
<p>meaning neurons that exist in the skin, in the brain,</p>
<p>and in the body that communicate with one another</p>
<p>that allow you to heat up if you need to</p>
<p>and cool down if you need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to throw a little bit of nomenclature,</p>
<p>a few new words at you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to memorize these words except for one.</p>
<p>Actually, you need to memorize one acronym,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the POA.</p>
<p>If you remember POA,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be home free for the rest of the episode.</p>
<p>But I know that there are some aficionados out there</p>
<p>and people interested in getting</p>
<p>a little bit deeper mechanism.</p>
<p>And I do think it&rsquo;s important to understand this circuit</p>
<p>because once you understand this circuit</p>
<p>and the way it&rsquo;s structured,</p>
<p>then you are going to be in a great position</p>
<p>to use the tools related to heating.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this circuit is structured.</p>
<p>You have this shell, which is basically skin,</p>
<p>and within the skin, you have neurons, nerve cells.</p>
<p>Those nerve cells have channels or receptors on them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called trip channels.</p>
<p>There are some other ones as well,</p>
<p>which basically sense changes in heat.</p>
<p>So if I were to put a hot object on your hand or your arm,</p>
<p>or for instance, if I were to put a hot object</p>
<p>on your hand or arm and then remove that hot object,</p>
<p>those neurons would respond to that.</p>
<p>They would send electrical signals into your spinal cord.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the next station of the circuit resides.</p>
<p>In your spinal cord, you&rsquo;ve got a little cluster of neurons</p>
<p>that exists at the top part of your spinal cord</p>
<p>called the dorsal horn.</p>
<p>The name again, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And those neurons specifically relay heat information</p>
<p>up to another area of your brain.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where we get into some fancy names.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lateral parabrachial area.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know lateral parabrachial area,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a relay station.</p>
<p>The lateral parabrachial area sends electrical signals</p>
<p>to the POA.</p>
<p>And I would like you to know POA.</p>
<p>The POA stands for preoptic area.</p>
<p>Neurons in the preoptic area basically reside</p>
<p>over the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>These are neurons within the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And neurons in the preoptic area have the ability</p>
<p>to send signals out to the rest of your brain and body</p>
<p>to get you to heat up and actually to change your behavior</p>
<p>so that you heat up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If neurons in the preoptic area receive an electrical signal</p>
<p>through the circuit I just described,</p>
<p>that goes from skin to dorsal horn of the spinal cord</p>
<p>to lateral parabrachial,</p>
<p>they will start sending signals out to the organs</p>
<p>of your body and the tissues of your body</p>
<p>to get those organs and tissues to do things.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, your POA, your preoptic area</p>
<p>will actually change the way</p>
<p>that you think and feel immediately.</p>
<p>For instance, if something warm contacts your skin</p>
<p>or something very hot contacts your skin,</p>
<p>the preoptic area will send signals</p>
<p>out to the endothelial cells,</p>
<p>the blood vessels, both of the brain and body</p>
<p>that get them to dilate, right?</p>
<p>To essentially increase their volume</p>
<p>and their surface area in order to cast off heat.</p>
<p>You will also start sweating.</p>
<p>That sweating response is initiated not by the hot day</p>
<p>or the hot sun, but by the preoptic area neurons</p>
<p>that send signals out to what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the periphery of your body.</p>
<p>And other chemicals are released,</p>
<p>things like acetylcholine that get you to sweat.</p>
<p>And if you happen to be shivering,</p>
<p>neurons in the preoptic area will make sure</p>
<p>that you stop shivering.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the feeling</p>
<p>of being somewhat lethargic</p>
<p>or spreading out your limbs on a hot day.</p>
<p>Well, that is the result of neurons in your preoptic area</p>
<p>impacting your musculature to get you</p>
<p>to increase your surface area</p>
<p>so you can sweat off or release more heat.</p>
<p>So there are all these different mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we dump heat.</p>
<p>Some of those are purely physiological.</p>
<p>Below our conscious control, things like sweating,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t just make yourself sweat on demand.</p>
<p>Maybe you can through a set of stressful thoughts,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t just make yourself sweat.</p>
<p>That is autonomic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s below your conscious control.</p>
<p>Things like vasodilation,</p>
<p>the dilation of your veins in particular</p>
<p>and capillaries in particular, these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And of course, there are these behavioral</p>
<p>somewhat voluntary aspects of dumping heat.</p>
<p>And the lethargy, the kind of tiredness that we feel</p>
<p>on a really hot day, that&rsquo;s also controlled</p>
<p>by this circuit that I just described.</p>
<p>In fact, I just got back from a visit to a very warm place</p>
<p>and it was remarkable to me</p>
<p>how lethargic I felt in the afternoons.</p>
<p>I just felt like a total slug.</p>
<p>I just could not move or rally to do anything</p>
<p>except if I waited until the evening,</p>
<p>even though it was later in the day,</p>
<p>even though I hadn&rsquo;t napped,</p>
<p>as the temperature in my environment cooled off,</p>
<p>as my body temperature cooled off,</p>
<p>I felt like I had more energy.</p>
<p>I was actually waking up</p>
<p>even though I had been awake for longer.</p>
<p>So the relationship between temperature and lethargy</p>
<p>is a very intimate one.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re warm enough, we feel active</p>
<p>and like we want to move around.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re too warm, we feel like we need to stay put</p>
<p>and spread out our limbs and dump heat.</p>
<p>And that brings me to a quick and kind of fun point</p>
<p>about how we dump heat versus how other animals dump heat.</p>
<p>Many of you know, of course, that we dump heat by sweating.</p>
<p>Other mechanisms as well, some of which I described,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s our main way of dumping heat.</p>
<p>Other animals like dogs don&rsquo;t have the capacity to sweat,</p>
<p>at least not very much.</p>
<p>So they pant, right, in order to dump heat.</p>
<p>And still other animals like rodents,</p>
<p>when they get too hot, they spit on their paws</p>
<p>and they rub that spit on the surface of their body,</p>
<p>which might sound kind of gross</p>
<p>and probably will get you to think twice</p>
<p>before petting any of those animals</p>
<p>or holding any of those animals again,</p>
<p>unless that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>Now, one other key thing to understand</p>
<p>about this circuit related to heat</p>
<p>is that the preoptic area</p>
<p>also can send electrical signals to the amygdala,</p>
<p>a brain area that is often talked about</p>
<p>in the context of fear,</p>
<p>but is really just a brain area</p>
<p>that can activate your sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is part of your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and is the one associated with fight or flight</p>
<p>or with the stress response,</p>
<p>or even just the excited response, right?</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is also what gets activated</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re really excited about something.</p>
<p>The preoptic area has the opportunity</p>
<p>to trigger the activation of the amygdala.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t do it every time, but it can.</p>
<p>And it tends to do that</p>
<p>when you are suddenly in an environment</p>
<p>that feels too hot,</p>
<p>that you feel is risky levels of hot.</p>
<p>If you ever have gotten into a sauna</p>
<p>that was very, very hot, maybe 210 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>you sit there for a minute,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that your heart rate increases</p>
<p>and there are reasons for that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the health benefits</p>
<p>of that in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You may not feel like your skin is going to burn up,</p>
<p>but you often will feel the impulse to get out,</p>
<p>especially if you stay in there for a little while.</p>
<p>That impulse is the consequence of this preoptic area</p>
<p>communicating with your amygdala saying,</p>
<p>hey, this environment is really hot</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to cool down and it&rsquo;s not really working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dumping heat,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not able to adjust the core of my body temperature</p>
<p>in ways that are going to protect my neurons.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a signal</p>
<p>that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t stay</p>
<p>in that environment too long.</p>
<p>Now, later we&rsquo;ll talk about the advantage</p>
<p>of pushing yourself a little bit</p>
<p>through some of these very hot environments</p>
<p>provided you can do it safely.</p>
<p>But the impulse to get yourself out</p>
<p>of a very hot environment</p>
<p>is the consequence of the POA</p>
<p>communicating with your amygdala.</p>
<p>And the amygdala then in turn activating</p>
<p>your adrenal glands, which sit right above your kidneys,</p>
<p>the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>and this feeling of agitation like you want to move.</p>
<p>Usually you want to move out</p>
<p>of whatever hot environment you happen to be in.</p>
<p>So now you know the circuit.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>It goes from skin to spinal cord,</p>
<p>one brain area to another brain area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key one in this discussion,</p>
<p>which is the POA, the preoptic area.</p>
<p>And the preoptic area can kick off</p>
<p>a bunch of autonomic subconscious responses to heat,</p>
<p>which make us attempt to get cooler,</p>
<p>things like sweating, vasodilation, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it can kick off behavioral responses,</p>
<p>spreading out our limbs</p>
<p>in an attempt to dump even more heat, feeling lethargic.</p>
<p>So a lack of desire to run and move.</p>
<p>And it also has the opportunity to kick off a mild</p>
<p>or maybe not so mild panic response</p>
<p>to get us out of that hot environment.</p>
<p>If you can conceptualize that circuit,</p>
<p>or if you can even just understand what I just said,</p>
<p>even at a top contour level,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a great position</p>
<p>to understand the rest of the information</p>
<p>and the tools that follow.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about the use</p>
<p>of deliberate heat exposure, including sauna,</p>
<p>but other tools as well,</p>
<p>as a way to understand how heat and heating</p>
<p>changes our biology.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to learn some mechanism</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to learn some tools.</p>
<p>But first I&rsquo;d like to just emphasize</p>
<p>that the use of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>can be a very powerful way to improve health and longevity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful study on this</p>
<p>that was published in 2018</p>
<p>that includes a lot of data from a lot of participants</p>
<p>in a lot of different conditions.</p>
<p>For instance, people that only did sauna once</p>
<p>versus two to three times a week</p>
<p>versus four to seven times a week and so on,</p>
<p>and compares all those.</p>
<p>The title of the study is</p>
<p>sauna bathing is associated</p>
<p>with reduced cardiovascular mortality</p>
<p>and improves risk prediction in men and women,</p>
<p>a prospective cohort study.</p>
<p>This is one of several papers that clearly demonstrate</p>
<p>that regular use of sauna</p>
<p>or other forms of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>can reduce mortality to cardiovascular events,</p>
<p>but also to other events,</p>
<p>things like stroke and other things</p>
<p>that basically can kill us.</p>
<p>What I like so much about this and the related studies,</p>
<p>and yes, I will provide a link to these in the show notes,</p>
<p>is that they involve a lot of participants.</p>
<p>So for instance, in this particular paper,</p>
<p>which was published in BMC Medicine,</p>
<p>they looked at a sample of 1,688 participants</p>
<p>who had a mean age of 63,</p>
<p>but there was a range of ages around 63,</p>
<p>and of whom 51.4% were women, the rest were men.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty nicely varied study</p>
<p>in terms of the populations that they looked at.</p>
<p>And basically what they found was</p>
<p>the more often that people do sauna,</p>
<p>the better their health is,</p>
<p>and the lower the likelihood they will die</p>
<p>from some sort of cardiovascular event.</p>
<p>Now, what do we mean by sauna?</p>
<p>We need to define some of the parameters around sauna,</p>
<p>and I promise to provide you some alternative ways</p>
<p>to access some of the health benefits</p>
<p>that were observed in this and related studies</p>
<p>without the need to have a sauna,</p>
<p>because I do realize that a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to sauna.</p>
<p>First off, the temperature ranges that were used</p>
<p>in this study and pretty much all the studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to talk about, unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>are between 80 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>and 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So somewhere in that range.</p>
<p>How hot should you make the sauna</p>
<p>or the environment that you get into</p>
<p>should you decide to use these tools?</p>
<p>Well, that will depend on your tolerance for heat,</p>
<p>how heat adapted you are.</p>
<p>Yes, some people are better at sweating than others,</p>
<p>and over time, we all get better at sweating,</p>
<p>meaning if you go into the sauna more frequently,</p>
<p>you become a better sweater.</p>
<p>Not a sweater you wear, but the verb, sweater.</p>
<p>You get better at sweating,</p>
<p>at dumping heat through the loss of water.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to depend.</p>
<p>I recommend starting on the lower end</p>
<p>of the temperature scale.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s too hot for you,</p>
<p>that you even lower the temperature further.</p>
<p>Now, how long were people exposing themselves</p>
<p>to these hot environments?</p>
<p>Anywhere from five to 20 minutes per session.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>very brief periods of just five minutes of heat exposure</p>
<p>can be a powerful stimulus</p>
<p>if the heat exposure is significantly great enough for you.</p>
<p>20 minutes can also be beneficial,</p>
<p>but 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>is the general range that this and most studies use.</p>
<p>In this particular study,</p>
<p>they compared the effects of people that did sauna</p>
<p>once a week, two or three times per week,</p>
<p>or four to seven times per week.</p>
<p>And what they saw was really remarkable.</p>
<p>What they observed was that people who went into the sauna</p>
<p>two or three times per week</p>
<p>were 27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event</p>
<p>than people that went into the sauna just once a week.</p>
<p>Again, at the temperature levels</p>
<p>and the duration that I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine,</p>
<p>the duration and the temperature levels were related.</p>
<p>So if people went into very hot environments</p>
<p>that were really uncomfortable for them,</p>
<p>maybe they only went in for five minutes.</p>
<p>Whereas if they were more comfortable and heat adapted</p>
<p>in a given environment or their tolerance for heat</p>
<p>was just simply higher for whatever reason,</p>
<p>well, then they tended to stay in longer.</p>
<p>We can take a sort of average of this five</p>
<p>to 20 minute range.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re mainly going to talk about exposures</p>
<p>between 10 and 20 minutes at temperatures between,</p>
<p>again, 80 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>176 degrees Fahrenheit or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So these data point to the fact that going in the sauna</p>
<p>two or three times per week is really beneficial</p>
<p>and can lower mortality to cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>And in fact, the benefits were even greater</p>
<p>for people that were going into the sauna</p>
<p>four to seven times per week.</p>
<p>Those people were 50% less likely to die</p>
<p>of a cardiovascular event compared to people</p>
<p>that went into the sauna just once a week.</p>
<p>So these are really impressive</p>
<p>and frankly encouraging studies.</p>
<p>Certainly they caught my eye and encouraged me</p>
<p>to start using deliberate heat exposure on a regular basis.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly nice about this study</p>
<p>and the related study that, again,</p>
<p>is linked in the show notes,</p>
<p>is that they looked at a number</p>
<p>of potentially confounding variables,</p>
<p>things like whether or not people smoked,</p>
<p>things like whether or not people were overweight,</p>
<p>whether or not they tended to exercise or not exercise,</p>
<p>and they were able to separate out those variables.</p>
<p>So the percentages that I described earlier,</p>
<p>27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event</p>
<p>for those that went in the sauna two to three times a week</p>
<p>and 50% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event</p>
<p>for those that went into the sauna four times per week</p>
<p>as compared to just once a week.</p>
<p>Those effects really do seem to be the consequence</p>
<p>of the sauna exposure and not some other effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s correlated with sauna exposure,</p>
<p>like going to the gym where people are working out</p>
<p>seven times a week and then also happen</p>
<p>to get into the sauna.</p>
<p>Or quitting smoking right about the same time</p>
<p>they adopt a sauna protocol, these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And now there have been additional analyses</p>
<p>of the use of sauna for improving health,</p>
<p>or I should say for offsetting mortality,</p>
<p>that have found that it&rsquo;s not just reductions</p>
<p>in cardiovascular events, but so-called all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>This is kind of medical geek speak.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying how likely are you or somebody to die</p>
<p>from a cardiovascular event, but maybe also</p>
<p>from some other event, some other health-related event,</p>
<p>like cancer or something of that sort.</p>
<p>And in every case, regular exposure to sauna,</p>
<p>starting at about two or three times per week,</p>
<p>all the way up to seven times per week, greatly improves,</p>
<p>meaning statistically significant improvements</p>
<p>in longevity in the sense that people are less likely</p>
<p>to die of cardiovascular events and other things</p>
<p>that kill us.</p>
<p>So I, and many other people who are interested</p>
<p>not just in our own health, but in educating</p>
<p>about health-related tools to the general public,</p>
<p>find this really exciting.</p>
<p>But knowing what we know about how heat impacts our biology,</p>
<p>it probably shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us</p>
<p>that this sauna type exposure or deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>has these incredible effects.</p>
<p>So before we get into the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>of how heat can have all these impressive health effects,</p>
<p>I want to just talk about the use of sauna as a tool</p>
<p>and emphasize that you don&rsquo;t have to use a sauna</p>
<p>in order to get these benefits.</p>
<p>It is simply a matter of making sure that your shell</p>
<p>and your core heat up properly a bit,</p>
<p>not too much, not too little, but that you heat those up.</p>
<p>And no, you do not need to carry a thermometer around</p>
<p>or place a thermometer into your core.</p>
<p>You know, in laboratory studies and in humans,</p>
<p>if you really want to know someone&rsquo;s core temperature,</p>
<p>basically you try and put the thermoprobe</p>
<p>as close to the core as you can.</p>
<p>So typically that&rsquo;s done rectally or a mouth thermometer,</p>
<p>or even up the nose.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do any of that, all right?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a laboratory study.</p>
<p>There are ways to create a hot environment</p>
<p>such that you heat up your shell and your core safely</p>
<p>without having to measure your core temperature all along.</p>
<p>If you want to do that, be my guest,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to provide a protocol.</p>
<p>So the question is, how are you heating up your environment?</p>
<p>And I realized that there are dry saunas,</p>
<p>there are steam saunas, there are infrared saunas,</p>
<p>there are hot tubs,</p>
<p>and there are simply rooms that you crank up the heat, okay?</p>
<p>There are also ways in which you can increase your shell</p>
<p>and your core temperature by moving around a lot</p>
<p>and doing that, wearing a lot of clothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special</p>
<p>about any one of these approaches or protocols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so happens that sauna</p>
<p>is one of the more convenient ways to do this.</p>
<p>And certainly for the studies that I&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>not just the ones I referenced before,</p>
<p>but all the studies that I researched</p>
<p>looking at this episode,</p>
<p>it makes sense why they would use sauna</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very hard, for instance,</p>
<p>to create conditions where if you have five people</p>
<p>go out jogging, wearing heavy sweaters and hats,</p>
<p>wool hats on the middle of summer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to set up those conditions</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s controlled for everybody.</p>
<p>Whereas it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward to have a sauna</p>
<p>where you have one or several people</p>
<p>just get into that one uniformly hot environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much easier study to run.</p>
<p>So just to be clear, the temperature range is important.</p>
<p>You want to get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Now, you know the conversion to Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>You could, however, immerse yourself in a hot tub</p>
<p>or hot water bath up to your neck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way to approach it.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have access to either of those,</p>
<p>you could also put on a hoodie or a wool hat and a hoodie,</p>
<p>or you could do like the wrestlers do.</p>
<p>And you could actually buy one of these plastic suits.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally called plastics that wrestlers</p>
<p>or other athletes that wish to drop water weight will wear</p>
<p>and then go jogging in that.</p>
<p>All of those will increase your shell</p>
<p>and your core body temperature, right?</p>
<p>Especially if you do it on a hot day,</p>
<p>but of course be careful, hydrate and don&rsquo;t overheat.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t become excessively hyperthermic</p>
<p>because you can get heat stroke and you can potentially die.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to use sauna,</p>
<p>often I get the question, how hot should the sauna be?</p>
<p>Well, now you know.</p>
<p>How long should you be in there?</p>
<p>Five to 20 minutes per session.</p>
<p>Although I will talk in a minute</p>
<p>about ways to optimize hormone output,</p>
<p>in particular growth hormone output</p>
<p>by doing four very brief sessions.</p>
<p>So maybe not a continuous session.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>And of course you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>wet sauna, dry sauna?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Use what you prefer.</p>
<p>Many people ask me, well, what about infrared sauna?</p>
<p>We have an entire episode all about the use of light</p>
<p>and low level light therapy, including infrared light.</p>
<p>It does have certain benefits for skin</p>
<p>and other organs and tissues of the body if used properly.</p>
<p>My understanding, or at least my assessment</p>
<p>of most infrared saunas out there</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t get hot enough.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get up to that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius range.</p>
<p>Some do, most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what you end up with is a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got a red light,</p>
<p>low level light therapy stimulus,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a sauna that&rsquo;s not quite hot enough.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of ideas and claims</p>
<p>about how they work together</p>
<p>in order to get you improved benefits.</p>
<p>I personally am of the stance,</p>
<p>based on the literature that I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>that you want to get into those ranges</p>
<p>of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius before you start,</p>
<p>considering whether or not you&rsquo;re also going to include</p>
<p>red light therapies, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing special about red light sauna.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the temperature of the sauna</p>
<p>that you happen to get into.</p>
<p>So which tool, right?</p>
<p>Which sauna, which stimulus?</p>
<p>Do you run in wearing plastics and a hoodie and a wool hat?</p>
<p>Do you get into a sauna?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to depend a lot on your circumstances,</p>
<p>your budget, and what you have access to on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This is a lot like our discussion about the use of cold.</p>
<p>Most of the studies have looked at immersion in cold water</p>
<p>up to the neck, because that&rsquo;s a very controlled situation</p>
<p>that you can do in a laboratory.</p>
<p>They have not explored cold showers as much.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just less data</p>
<p>or walking around in a cold environment.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about those data</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;ll soon learn, when you talk about cold,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually talking about heating as well.</p>
<p>So what kind of mechanisms are activated</p>
<p>in your brain and body that allow</p>
<p>for the various health benefits of sauna</p>
<p>or other forms of deliberate heating?</p>
<p>Well, we talked about reduced risk</p>
<p>of cardiovascular event-related mortality</p>
<p>and all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon learn, there are also tremendous benefits</p>
<p>in terms of increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>reductions in cortisol, et cetera.</p>
<p>I will detail those.</p>
<p>So what happens when you get into a hot environment?</p>
<p>What are the mechanisms that allow</p>
<p>for the various health effects of that?</p>
<p>Well, your shell, your skin senses that,</p>
<p>and through the circuit that I described earlier,</p>
<p>activates neurons in the POA, the preoptic area,</p>
<p>which in turn activates mechanisms</p>
<p>in your autonomic nervous system like vasodilation.</p>
<p>So blood flow increases, plasma volume</p>
<p>of your blood increases, and stroke volume.</p>
<p>The volume of blood that is mobilized</p>
<p>with each beat of your heart also increases.</p>
<p>And your heart rate increases</p>
<p>to anywhere between 100 to 150 beats per minute.</p>
<p>That general constellation of effects</p>
<p>looks a lot like cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>And in fact, for all intents and purposes,</p>
<p>it really is cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>except that there isn&rsquo;t the mobilization</p>
<p>and the loading of joints and limbs</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And of course, there are additional benefits</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise that relate</p>
<p>to impact on the ground,</p>
<p>improvements in bone density, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But basically your heart starts beating,</p>
<p>more blood starts circulating,</p>
<p>your vasculature changes shape literally</p>
<p>to accommodate those increases</p>
<p>in heart rate and blood volume.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re basically getting a cardiovascular workout</p>
<p>in that hot environment, even if you&rsquo;re just sitting down.</p>
<p>Another set of positive effects related</p>
<p>to being in these hot environments are hormone effects.</p>
<p>Shifts in the output of hormones,</p>
<p>both from your adrenals and possibly</p>
<p>from the testes and ovaries,</p>
<p>and even within the brain.</p>
<p>One of the more striking examples of that comes</p>
<p>from a study that was published in 2021.</p>
<p>The title of the study is endocrine effects</p>
<p>of repeated hot thermal stress</p>
<p>and cold water immersion in young adult men.</p>
<p>And indeed the study was in this case, just done on men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just briefly describe the protocol they use.</p>
<p>They had these men attend four sauna sessions</p>
<p>of 12 minutes each.</p>
<p>So again, well within that range</p>
<p>of five to 20 minutes, 12 minutes.</p>
<p>The temperature of those saunas was 90 to 91 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just quickly do the calculation.</p>
<p>Admittedly, not in my head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 194 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And they did that four times.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they had a six minute cool down break</p>
<p>during which they did get into some cool water</p>
<p>or cold water of about 10 degrees,</p>
<p>which is 10 degrees Celsius is 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And then they measured hormones</p>
<p>at various times throughout this study</p>
<p>before, during, and after.</p>
<p>They looked at testosterone.</p>
<p>They looked at DHEA, which is in the androgen pathway.</p>
<p>They looked at prolactin and they looked at cortisol.</p>
<p>The significant effects of the protocol</p>
<p>that I just described were on cortisol,</p>
<p>a so-called stress hormone.</p>
<p>So-called because when we are very stressed</p>
<p>for long periods of time,</p>
<p>cortisol levels tend to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>But I should point out that a increase in cortisol each day</p>
<p>right about the time of waking</p>
<p>and specifically right about the time of waking</p>
<p>is actually beneficial for our alertness and our energy.</p>
<p>So having some increase in cortisol every 24 hours</p>
<p>is a good thing provided it happens early in the day.</p>
<p>Late day increases in cortisol</p>
<p>are associated with depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown by studies at Stanford and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The major effect of this study</p>
<p>is a significant decrease in cortisol output</p>
<p>in these subjects.</p>
<p>I think this is really interesting and important</p>
<p>because many people suffer from acute,</p>
<p>meaning immediate and long-term stress</p>
<p>and are looking for ways to control their stress.</p>
<p>Controlling your cortisol is tricky.</p>
<p>In the episode on stress,</p>
<p>I talked about supplements such as ashwagandha</p>
<p>that can be used to limit cortisol,</p>
<p>but you have to be careful not to use ashwagandha</p>
<p>for extended periods of time,</p>
<p>meaning for longer than two weeks</p>
<p>because you can get into other issues.</p>
<p>I talk about breathwork protocols</p>
<p>that can allow you to clamp</p>
<p>or reduce the stress response in real time.</p>
<p>Again, see that episode for those,</p>
<p>but many people are overworked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re overstressed.</p>
<p>For one reason or another,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re subjected to many, too many stressors</p>
<p>or their level of stress resilience isn&rsquo;t high enough</p>
<p>to keep their cortisol levels clamped at a healthy level.</p>
<p>So the protocol I described of 12 minute exposures</p>
<p>to 90 degree environment, that&rsquo;s again, 90 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>followed by a six minute cool down break</p>
<p>in cool water, 50 degrees or so, that&rsquo;s pretty cold.</p>
<p>I can imagine that you could also just take a cool shower</p>
<p>or a cold shower afterwards.</p>
<p>That had a very significant effect on lowering cortisol.</p>
<p>So there you have a tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a completely zero cost tool</p>
<p>because you need to heat the water</p>
<p>and you need to have access to hot and cold water,</p>
<p>at least hot and cold contrast of some sort,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly minimal cost for most people,</p>
<p>especially if you start getting creative</p>
<p>about maybe taking a 12 minute jog,</p>
<p>wearing a lot of clothing.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s hot out, then getting into a cool shower,</p>
<p>you might not get the same extreme</p>
<p>or significant reduction in cortisol</p>
<p>that was observed here with these very specific protocols,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s likely that you would get a similar result overall.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned they did look at these other hormones</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just tell you that they did not see</p>
<p>significant shifts in testosterone, prolactin, DHEA,</p>
<p>et cetera, using this protocol.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon see, there are other sauna protocols</p>
<p>that can impact those other hormones.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re seeking to use sauna to reduce stress,</p>
<p>I think this is a very interesting</p>
<p>and potentially useful research backed protocol.</p>
<p>And again, we will provide a link to the paper</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to read more about the data.</p>
<p>So that is one set of biological effects on cortisol</p>
<p>and the related protocol.</p>
<p>What about some of the other benefits of sauna?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about those,</p>
<p>but I want to talk about those in the context</p>
<p>of the underlying mechanisms,</p>
<p>because if you understand those underlying mechanisms,</p>
<p>you can really tailor your sauna protocols</p>
<p>for your particular needs.</p>
<p>One of the more dramatic and important effects</p>
<p>of going into a hot environment for some period of time</p>
<p>is the activation of so-called heat shock proteins or HSPs.</p>
<p>Heat shock proteins are a protective mechanism</p>
<p>in your brain and body to rescue proteins</p>
<p>that would otherwise misfold.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, most of you are familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that if you have protein in the kitchen,</p>
<p>like a steak or a piece of chicken or a piece of fish,</p>
<p>and you heat it up, it changes its texture, right?</p>
<p>Raw meat is different than cooked meat,</p>
<p>to be quite blunt about it.</p>
<p>Heat changes the quality of proteins,</p>
<p>not just in terms of how they taste,</p>
<p>but the way in which they are configured.</p>
<p>It changes it right down at the molecular level.</p>
<p>When your body goes through changes in temperature each day,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about those changes,</p>
<p>but in response to hot environments or cold environments,</p>
<p>heat shock proteins are deployed to go and rescue</p>
<p>and prevent the changes in proteins</p>
<p>that would be detrimental to your health.</p>
<p>So at least in the short term,</p>
<p>activating heat shock proteins is a good thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want heat shock proteins to be activated</p>
<p>for long periods of time,</p>
<p>because that gets to be problematic for other reasons.</p>
<p>But these heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>of which there are many varieties,</p>
<p>basically have the job of traveling in your brain and body</p>
<p>and making sure that cells that contain proteins</p>
<p>that are misfolding because they got heated up too much,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t misfold.</p>
<p>And they also serve a protective mechanism,</p>
<p>making sure that proteins within the cells</p>
<p>of your brain and body don&rsquo;t fold in the wrong ways.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m describing this in very general terms,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s well-established in animal models and in humans</p>
<p>that sauna exposure of the sort that I described earlier</p>
<p>activates these heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting studies that were carried out</p>
<p>in animal models that really nicely mechanistically support</p>
<p>the role of heat shock proteins</p>
<p>in some of the benefits of deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>Some of these studies were done in flies,</p>
<p>some of meaning Drosophila fruit flies,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a great model organism</p>
<p>because you can delete genes or add genes easily.</p>
<p>Other studies have been done in mice.</p>
<p>And now there are also studies being carried out in humans.</p>
<p>And I will talk about those.</p>
<p>One of the more dramatic examples that&rsquo;s always touted</p>
<p>in this field of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>as it relates to longevity is that if they expose</p>
<p>these flies, these fruit flies to 70 minutes</p>
<p>of a heat stimulus that obviously didn&rsquo;t kill them,</p>
<p>but activated heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>it could extend their life by 15%</p>
<p>in a heat shock dependent way.</p>
<p>Meaning if they made flies that didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>these heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>well then they didn&rsquo;t see this extension in life.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons to use model organisms.</p>
<p>This is not an experiment that you could do in people.</p>
<p>However, there have been interesting studies done</p>
<p>in humans examining some of the downstream molecular</p>
<p>pathways of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>that point to the mechanisms by which</p>
<p>deliberate heat exposure can help protect</p>
<p>against different forms of mortality,</p>
<p>improve health overall, and possibly,</p>
<p>and I want to highlight possibly, possibly extend life.</p>
<p>One such mechanism involves a genetic program</p>
<p>involving a molecule called FOXO3.</p>
<p>FOXO3 is a very interesting molecule</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s involved in DNA repair pathways.</p>
<p>DNA repair is part of the process of remaining healthy.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d all like to think that we&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>and based on the genes we have,</p>
<p>we are healthy, healthy, healthy,</p>
<p>then eventually we age and then we die.</p>
<p>But from the time we&rsquo;re born until the time we die,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a constant repair of our proteins and our cells</p>
<p>in a modification of the genes that are being expressed.</p>
<p>You know, puberty being the most dramatic example, right?</p>
<p>You see a kid before puberty and after puberty,</p>
<p>looks like a different kid, sounds like a different kid,</p>
<p>thinks like a different kid.</p>
<p>In fact, basically is a different human being, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the hormones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that hormones themselves have the capacity</p>
<p>to turn on and turn off certain genes,</p>
<p>literally converting certain tissues and cells</p>
<p>in the brain and body to do entirely different things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the sprouting of new aspects</p>
<p>of our biology, it&rsquo;s literally the conversion</p>
<p>of different brain centers from one function to another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s puberty, and we&rsquo;ll do a whole episode about puberty.</p>
<p>We actually did an episode on sexual development</p>
<p>that talks a little bit about those mechanisms.</p>
<p>But the point is that throughout our entire lifespan,</p>
<p>genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off.</p>
<p>Genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off,</p>
<p>and DNA, the stuff of genes, gets damaged in that process.</p>
<p>FOXO3 sits upstream in a pathway related to DNA repair,</p>
<p>and again, clearing of these senescent cells.</p>
<p>Sauna exposure, in particular sauna exposure,</p>
<p>two to three times, or ideally four to seven times per week</p>
<p>in that 80 to 100 degree Celsius range</p>
<p>has been shown to upregulate levels of FOXO3.</p>
<p>FOXO3 in turn upregulates pathways related to DNA repair</p>
<p>and clearing out of these senescent or dead cells,</p>
<p>which is known to be important for various aspects</p>
<p>of maintaining cognition and other aspects</p>
<p>of maintaining health.</p>
<p>So these are the likely biological mechanisms</p>
<p>for the improvements in lifespan,</p>
<p>or rather I should say,</p>
<p>these are the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that apparently offset some of the cardiovascular risk</p>
<p>and other forms of mortality that were described earlier.</p>
<p>One especially interesting thing about FOXO3,</p>
<p>there are individuals out there</p>
<p>that have either additional copies of FOXO3</p>
<p>or who have versions of FOXO3 that are hyperactive,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>Those people tend to be 2.7 times more likely</p>
<p>to live to 100 years of age or longer.</p>
<p>So these are people that were just naturally</p>
<p>and fortunately for them endowed with more FOXO3,</p>
<p>more clearance of senescent cells,</p>
<p>more DNA repair, et cetera.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have one of these health promoting FOXO3 mutations.</p>
<p>Remember mutations can be beneficial</p>
<p>or they can be detrimental.</p>
<p>If your goal is to live longer is a beneficial mutation.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t have these FOXO3 mutations</p>
<p>that allow you to be a centenarian</p>
<p>at 2.7 times higher likelihood than other people,</p>
<p>deliberate heat exposure is one way</p>
<p>that you can increase FOXO3 activity.</p>
<p>At this point in time,</p>
<p>meaning when looking at the research out there,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t clear what the optimal sauna protocol</p>
<p>is going to be specifically to increase FOXO3.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably because there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>There is no sauna protocol designed specifically</p>
<p>to reduce cortisol or specifically to increase FOXO3</p>
<p>or specifically to activate heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>Any deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>is likely to impact all of those mechanisms.</p>
<p>Again, I encourage you to use this guide</p>
<p>of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>as your kind of bookends for what you can tolerate</p>
<p>and where you want to start</p>
<p>and eventually transition to</p>
<p>in terms of deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>And I would encourage you</p>
<p>to use that five to 20 minutes per session</p>
<p>for the sauna as your rough guide</p>
<p>of how long to remain in the sauna.</p>
<p>Now, there was a study published just this last year</p>
<p>that was mainly focused on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>I detailed this quite extensively in the episode on cold.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful work of Susanna Soberg.</p>
<p>And that study looked at deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>but also sauna exposure.</p>
<p>And that study found that 57,</p>
<p>yes, 57 minutes per week of sauna exposure</p>
<p>in conjunction with 11 minutes per week</p>
<p>total of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>was the threshold for getting improvements in metabolism</p>
<p>and increases in brown fat,</p>
<p>this very active fat tissue</p>
<p>that improves mitochondrial function and thermogenesis,</p>
<p>meaning heating of the body.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about brown fat later.</p>
<p>Why do I mention this?</p>
<p>Well, for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in increasing metabolism,</p>
<p>it does seem to be most beneficial</p>
<p>to do that 11 minutes per week of cold exposure.</p>
<p>Again, divide it up across two or more sessions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not 11 minutes all at once, but shorter sessions.</p>
<p>And to get 57 minutes minimum per week of sauna exposure,</p>
<p>again, in the temperature ranges</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about here.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not 57 minutes in the sauna all at once.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 57 minutes total per week as the minimum threshold.</p>
<p>So you might divide that into three sessions of 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t think 57 is the magic number.</p>
<p>It could be 60, it could be 64, it probably could be 55.</p>
<p>Remember your biological systems</p>
<p>are not counting things off minute by minute,</p>
<p>second by second, at least not in most cases.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in improving metabolism, check out the episode on cold</p>
<p>or just take the Soberg protocol, as I call it,</p>
<p>which is 11 minutes total per week</p>
<p>of uncomfortably cold, but safe cold exposure.</p>
<p>So uncomfortably cold means you really, really want to get</p>
<p>out of the shower or the ice bath or whatever environment,</p>
<p>but you can stay in.</p>
<p>11 minutes total per week divided across a couple sessions.</p>
<p>And then 57 minutes per week or so</p>
<p>of deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>Again, uncomfortably hot, but safe to stay in,</p>
<p>probably divided up across three or more sessions.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about the use of sauna</p>
<p>to decrease cortisol.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the use of sauna</p>
<p>to increase heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the use of sauna to increase FOXO3.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about the use of sauna</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>Growth hormone is a hormone that we all naturally secrete</p>
<p>from our pituitary,</p>
<p>which also resides near the roof of our mouth.</p>
<p>The signal for the pituitary to release growth hormone</p>
<p>arrives from neurons that exist in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So growth hormone releasing hormones, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>stimulate the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>from the anterior pituitary gland</p>
<p>into the general circulation.</p>
<p>And then growth hormone impacts metabolism</p>
<p>and growth of cells and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>It is responsible for tissue repair as well.</p>
<p>And the growth spurt that everyone experiences</p>
<p>during puberty is the consequence of growth hormone.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe is a study</p>
<p>that found dramatic, really dramatic, I should say,</p>
<p>increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>But I also want to emphasize</p>
<p>that these increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>were not of the sort that are observed in puberty</p>
<p>or in infants becoming adolescents</p>
<p>or adolescents growing into teenagers.</p>
<p>Those levels of growth hormone that are associated</p>
<p>with those massive transformations, excuse me,</p>
<p>of body morphology of shape are far greater</p>
<p>than the sorts that I&rsquo;m talking about here.</p>
<p>And yet, as all of us age,</p>
<p>when we go from adolescence to our teenage years</p>
<p>and then into young adulthood,</p>
<p>but then starting in our early thirties or so,</p>
<p>the amount of growth hormone that we secrete</p>
<p>is greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Normally we would release growth hormone every night</p>
<p>after we go to sleep,</p>
<p>in particular in the early part of the night</p>
<p>when our sleep is comprised mostly of slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>As we age, less growth hormone is released</p>
<p>during that slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>There are various things that can promote</p>
<p>the release of growth hormone,</p>
<p>and we will talk about some of those other things</p>
<p>in a moment.</p>
<p>Things like low blood sugar, turns out,</p>
<p>is a stimulus for growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean hypoglycemia of the sort</p>
<p>that makes you dizzy and want to pass out, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I mean, not having high levels of glucose and insulin</p>
<p>in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many people are drawn</p>
<p>to intermittent fasting or even prolonged fasting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the reported increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch on those briefly,</p>
<p>but if you want to learn more about those</p>
<p>and what their real impact is</p>
<p>and the extent of growth hormone,</p>
<p>check out the episode I did on fasting.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Certain forms of exercise have also been shown</p>
<p>to stimulate growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And in a few moments,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how exercise and fasting can be combined</p>
<p>or how heat can be combined with exercise</p>
<p>or certain patterns of food intake</p>
<p>to further increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>But before I do that,</p>
<p>I want to review some of the data</p>
<p>and one study in particular</p>
<p>that discovered certain forms of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>using sauna can stimulate very large increases</p>
<p>in growth hormone output,</p>
<p>which for people in their 30s, 40s and beyond</p>
<p>could be very useful and may also be useful</p>
<p>for people who are just trying to stimulate</p>
<p>the release of more growth hormone</p>
<p>in order to, for instance, recover from exercise</p>
<p>or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth</p>
<p>or repair of a particular injury.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>endocrine effects of repeated sauna bathing.</p>
<p>And this is a paper that was published in 1986,</p>
<p>which is some years ago,</p>
<p>but nonetheless serves as a basis</p>
<p>for a lot of other studies that followed.</p>
<p>So let me describe what they did in this study.</p>
<p>They used an 80 degree Celsius environment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 176 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And they had subjects do this sauna for 30 minutes,</p>
<p>four times per day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s two hours total in one day,</p>
<p>30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool-down rest,</p>
<p>30 minutes in the sauna again, cool-down rest,</p>
<p>a third and a fourth time, okay?</p>
<p>So two hours total in this 80 degree Celsius environment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>but what they observed was really quite significant.</p>
<p>So they had subjects do this protocol</p>
<p>and I should mention they had both male</p>
<p>and female subjects in this study.</p>
<p>And the entire study lasted a week.</p>
<p>They did this two hours of sauna exposure on day one,</p>
<p>day three and day seven of that week.</p>
<p>And they measured a lot of different hormones,</p>
<p>cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>thyroid hormone itself,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>which are hormones that essentially drive the production</p>
<p>of other hormones.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t get into that too deeply,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;d like to learn about FSH,</p>
<p>follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>please see the episode on optimizing testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>They looked at prolactin and they looked at growth hormone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just cut to the chase and tell you</p>
<p>the effects on growth hormone.</p>
<p>In subjects that did this two hour a day,</p>
<p>80 degree Celsius protocol,</p>
<p>experienced 16 fold increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>So they measured growth hormone before the sauna</p>
<p>and after the sauna and growth hormone levels went up</p>
<p>16 fold, which is obviously an enormous</p>
<p>and it turns out statistically significant effect.</p>
<p>Now, one important caveat here.</p>
<p>Remember earlier when I talked about people who did sauna</p>
<p>once a week versus two to three times a week</p>
<p>versus four to seven times a week.</p>
<p>And the more often people did sauna,</p>
<p>the less likely they were to die of cardiovascular events</p>
<p>or other things of that sort.</p>
<p>Well, in this case,</p>
<p>the effects of sauna exposure on growth hormone</p>
<p>actually went down</p>
<p>the more often that people did this deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>So, as I mentioned, they did this two hour a day</p>
<p>divided into 30 minute sessions protocol on day one,</p>
<p>day three and day seven of a week.</p>
<p>And what they found was on day one,</p>
<p>there was a 16 fold increase in growth hormone.</p>
<p>On day three, however,</p>
<p>there was still a significant effect on growth hormone</p>
<p>as compared to before sauna,</p>
<p>but that effect was basically cut by two thirds.</p>
<p>So now instead of getting a 16 fold increase,</p>
<p>it was more like a three or four fold increase,</p>
<p>which is still a huge increase,</p>
<p>but not as great as the increase observed on day one.</p>
<p>And then on day seven,</p>
<p>there tended to be a two, maybe a three fold increase,</p>
<p>but not as great as the one observed on day one.</p>
<p>What does this mean and why does this happen?</p>
<p>Well, the reason this happens is because heat,</p>
<p>just like cold is a shock or a stressor to the system.</p>
<p>In the context of cold,</p>
<p>if you get into a very cold ice bath, for instance,</p>
<p>a five degree ice bath, even for 20 seconds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s known to increase norepinephrine 200%.</p>
<p>It can double the amount of norepinephrine</p>
<p>that you suddenly release into your brain and body,</p>
<p>which actually can have some positive effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about those in a little bit.</p>
<p>But if you were to do that every day,</p>
<p>you would become cold adapted.</p>
<p>This circuit that compares the shell and core of your body</p>
<p>would adjust in ways that it could either predict</p>
<p>that cold stimulus or more likely</p>
<p>to create some thermogenic mechanisms</p>
<p>in preparation for that cold exposure.</p>
<p>This is why, for instance,</p>
<p>people that use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to try and increase lipolysis, the burning of fat,</p>
<p>oftentimes will get results for a while,</p>
<p>but then if they&rsquo;re doing it a lot, a lot,</p>
<p>they stop getting those effects.</p>
<p>I talk a lot about avoiding cold adaptation</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal in the episode on cold.</p>
<p>But similar mechanisms are at play here.</p>
<p>So we have to imagine that when these subjects</p>
<p>got into the sauna on day one,</p>
<p>whatever pathways went from measurement of temperature</p>
<p>at the shell to changes in temperature at the core</p>
<p>led to these big increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>which is basically a way of just describing the result</p>
<p>I already told you before.</p>
<p>But the fact that that result diminished over time</p>
<p>either means that the circuit was not as efficient</p>
<p>in communicating that shift in temperature</p>
<p>or that that shift in temperature was of less impact</p>
<p>because the downstream effectors</p>
<p>were not engaged to the same extent</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t as much of a shock.</p>
<p>And I think the latter explanation is far more likely.</p>
<p>This is very much akin to weight training</p>
<p>or cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>where if you run up a hill very fast, for instance,</p>
<p>and your lungs are burning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re heaving and breathing hard on the first day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very painful thing.</p>
<p>But if you do it every day or every other day,</p>
<p>provide you allow yourself to recover,</p>
<p>pretty soon you&rsquo;re running up that hill</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not breathing as hard.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much burning in your muscles,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Your body adapts.</p>
<p>So one of the key things to understand</p>
<p>about the use of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re going to use it</p>
<p>in order to try and trigger massive increases</p>
<p>in growth hormone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need to be careful about not doing it</p>
<p>more than let&rsquo;s say once a week.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m extrapolating from this study.</p>
<p>Maybe once every 10 days would be even better.</p>
<p>But if you start getting heat adapted,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely that you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>these massive increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mean to be discouraging</p>
<p>of using deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>to access growth hormone increases.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s your specific goal or your main goal,</p>
<p>then I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to say</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to do deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>at least not of the sort that I described here,</p>
<p>more than once a week,</p>
<p>or maybe even once every 10 days.</p>
<p>And that you would want to time that</p>
<p>to other events in your life,</p>
<p>maybe hard workouts,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re trying to push through a fat loss barrier,</p>
<p>or simply in order to access growth hormone at peak levels,</p>
<p>maybe three times per month or four times per month.</p>
<p>If you start doing deliberate heat exposure more often,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll still get increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>but they are not going to be nearly as large</p>
<p>as the increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to experience</p>
<p>if you shock your system with deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>An important way to frame this</p>
<p>is actually in the context of cold.</p>
<p>And while you might say,</p>
<p>wait, this is an episode on heat and heating, not cold,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t have a conversation about heat and heating</p>
<p>without talking about cold,</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>if you cool the outside of your body, the shell,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually heating up your body.</p>
<p>In fact, the circuits that control heating of the body</p>
<p>and that control cooling of the body,</p>
<p>for instance, the activation of things like shiver</p>
<p>or fat loss in response to cold and shiver,</p>
<p>those are also controlled by the preoptic area</p>
<p>of the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So we can take a step back and start to think about</p>
<p>what it would take to design the optimal protocol</p>
<p>for deliberate heat exposure by looking at cold.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been beautiful studies showing that</p>
<p>if people get into a very cold body of water,</p>
<p>four degrees Celsius for 20 seconds,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that will cause a 200 to 300% increase in norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is also called noradrenaline</p>
<p>and norepinephrine and other so-called catecholamines</p>
<p>like dopamine increase dramatically</p>
<p>in this very brief cold water exposure.</p>
<p>And those increases in norepinephrine and dopamine</p>
<p>are known to have long lasting effects</p>
<p>that generally to improvements in mood, focus and alertness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty significant.</p>
<p>However, they aren&rsquo;t significant enough</p>
<p>to increase metabolism to a very high degree.</p>
<p>Whereas other studies have shown that if people go outside</p>
<p>in 16 degrees Celsius weather with a proper amount,</p>
<p>but a fairly minimum amount of clothing,</p>
<p>you can experience even greater increases in norepinephrine.</p>
<p>But the time that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>in order to experience those increases is six hours</p>
<p>at for instance, 16 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>So if you have six hours a day to be out there in the cold,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re going to turn the air conditioning on</p>
<p>in an environment, make it very, very cold, fine.</p>
<p>But basically what I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>is that you can sort of bookend</p>
<p>the parameters that you can use.</p>
<p>You can use a very brief exposure to cold or to heat</p>
<p>in order to stimulate heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>growth hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or you can use longer exposure</p>
<p>in less intense versions of heat and cold.</p>
<p>You really have to find what&rsquo;s going to work for you</p>
<p>and what you can do safely.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re confused about where to start,</p>
<p>please use the parameters that I described earlier.</p>
<p>First of all, check with your doctor as always,</p>
<p>make sure that you&rsquo;re somebody who can do deliberate cold</p>
<p>or heat exposure safely.</p>
<p>But that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>I keep repeating over and over</p>
<p>because I know somebody is going to ask</p>
<p>even though I repeat it over and over, which is fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to keep saying it</p>
<p>and to respond if someone asks again.</p>
<p>Well, those parameters are going to kind of bookend</p>
<p>what you should do in terms of the intensity</p>
<p>of the heat stimulus.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>Well, we heard earlier, five to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Why not start with five and then ramp it up to 10 or 15?</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re feeling really bold</p>
<p>and you really want to crank out growth hormone,</p>
<p>well, then you could do that 30 minute,</p>
<p>four times in one day stimulus every once in a while.</p>
<p>So you have to really figure out</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re using heat exposure for.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why when people say,</p>
<p>is it better to get in a wet sauna or dry sauna?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the optimal temperature?</p>
<p>Is it better to take a hot shower or a hot bath</p>
<p>or a hot tub?</p>
<p>To be completely honest,</p>
<p>it depends on what you&rsquo;re going to be able to do regularly,</p>
<p>whether or not you want to do it regularly</p>
<p>and what your specific goals are.</p>
<p>So the purpose of this episode is really to arm you</p>
<p>with the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>and to arm you with the general parameters</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to access the results</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re seeking.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I personally use a protocol</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been using a protocol for a long time</p>
<p>that involves trying,</p>
<p>meaning I accomplish this most weeks, not all,</p>
<p>trying to get into a sauna</p>
<p>for three 20 minute sessions every week.</p>
<p>I use a dry sauna, so it&rsquo;s not a steam room.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have access to it,</p>
<p>I might take a hot bath or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>I just stick to doing the sauna three times a week.</p>
<p>And I generally will do that either after a workout,</p>
<p>either a cardiovascular workout or a weight workout,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll do it later in the evening.</p>
<p>Why later in the evening?</p>
<p>Well, it has to do with the circadian shifts in temperature</p>
<p>that we all experience.</p>
<p>Talked a lot about this in the circadian episodes</p>
<p>and the episodes related to sleep,</p>
<p>but in a nutshell, here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Every early morning,</p>
<p>about two hours before your typical wake up time,</p>
<p>your body temperature is at its all time lowest, okay?</p>
<p>We call that your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Right about waking, your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>In fact, an increase in body temperature</p>
<p>is part of the reason you wake up at all,</p>
<p>unless of course you&rsquo;re setting an alarm.</p>
<p>Increases in body temperature</p>
<p>are going to be one of the major things</p>
<p>that wakes up your brain and body.</p>
<p>Body temperature will tend to continue</p>
<p>to increase through the morning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get that increase in cortisol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy increase in cortisol.</p>
<p>Body temperature will increase into the afternoon,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll start to drop in the later afternoon.</p>
<p>This general contour can be shifted</p>
<p>by whether or not you exercise,</p>
<p>how often you eat,</p>
<p>because of the so-called thermogenic effects of food.</p>
<p>That is every time you eat,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a slight increase in body temperature and metabolism,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really that significant</p>
<p>to throw off this general contour and rhythm.</p>
<p>But toward the afternoon, around four or five o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>most days, depending on time of year,</p>
<p>your body temperature will peak,</p>
<p>and then it will start to drop.</p>
<p>And as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m referring to your core body temperature,</p>
<p>not your shell body temperature,</p>
<p>you will start to get sleepy</p>
<p>and to transition into sleep</p>
<p>and to maintain sleep throughout the night,</p>
<p>your body temperature will remain low</p>
<p>until you hit that temperature minimum,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll start to come up again.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>What that means is that when you decide to do sauna</p>
<p>or cold exposure for that matter,</p>
<p>is going to be important.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>if you were to make the surface of your body cold,</p>
<p>at least in the immediate period after that,</p>
<p>your body temperature will increase.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are challenged in getting to sleep,</p>
<p>and are still working on your sleep,</p>
<p>remember sleep is the foundation</p>
<p>of all mental and physical health and optimal performance.</p>
<p>You should try to get really quality sleep</p>
<p>of sufficient duration, at least 80% of nights.</p>
<p>That should be an ongoing goal throughout your lifespan</p>
<p>for a huge number of reasons.</p>
<p>Watch the master sleep episode</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to hear more of those reasons</p>
<p>and the mechanisms to make sure that you do that.</p>
<p>But in any event,</p>
<p>cold exposure late in the evening</p>
<p>will start to increase your body temperature again,</p>
<p>and that can make it hard for some people to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re very, very tired</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve been working hard or training hard</p>
<p>or both throughout the day,</p>
<p>might not throw off your sleep so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through bouts where I&rsquo;m just so, so busy</p>
<p>from morning till night,</p>
<p>that the only time I can get into the ice bath</p>
<p>or the cold shower is late in the evening,</p>
<p>and I have no trouble sleeping after that.</p>
<p>However, if you have trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>I would recommend doing the cold exposure early in the day</p>
<p>to match that natural heating,</p>
<p>that natural increase in body temperature</p>
<p>that occurs across the 24-hour so-called circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you&rsquo;re going to use deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be wise to do that later in the day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be wise to do it later in the day</p>
<p>because when you get into a warm environment,</p>
<p>sure, the surface of your body, the shell heats up,</p>
<p>the core of your body heats up,</p>
<p>but then it also activates cooling mechanisms</p>
<p>through the preoptic area.</p>
<p>And when you get out of that hot environment,</p>
<p>sauna or otherwise, your body will continue to cool down.</p>
<p>And so many people find that if they do sauna</p>
<p>in the later half of the day, or even just before sleep,</p>
<p>and then take a warmish shower afterwards,</p>
<p>then they find it easier to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And that makes sense</p>
<p>because their body temperature is dropping.</p>
<p>And in fact, if your goal is to really promote</p>
<p>the maximum amount of growth hormone release,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also going to be the best time of day to do it,</p>
<p>especially if you haven&rsquo;t eaten</p>
<p>in the two hours before sleep, okay?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re really going for growth hormone release,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really trying to optimize sleep,</p>
<p>and the two things are actually linked</p>
<p>because of the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>that happens from the pituitary in the early nights sleep,</p>
<p>well, then you would be wise to do your sauna</p>
<p>maybe once or maybe twice a week in the evening</p>
<p>or at nighttime, then taking a warm or cool shower</p>
<p>just briefly, just enough to kind of rinse off</p>
<p>all the sweat from the sauna,</p>
<p>and then get ready for sleep.</p>
<p>And to do that, not necessarily fasted,</p>
<p>but to try and keep your levels of glucose and insulin</p>
<p>somewhat low in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>The reason I say that is that having elevated blood glucose</p>
<p>and or insulin tends to blunt</p>
<p>or reduce growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true for any number of different stimuli,</p>
<p>including exercise and including sauna.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a really nice study on this</p>
<p>that I can point you to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a study that was published in the journal Stress,</p>
<p>literally, that&rsquo;s the name of the journal.</p>
<p>I love it when journals have these names</p>
<p>like pain or stress.</p>
<p>I find that somewhat amusing for reasons</p>
<p>that escape me, but nonetheless amuse me.</p>
<p>The title of this study is growth hormone response</p>
<p>to different consecutive stress stimuli in healthy men.</p>
<p>Is there any difference?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to go into all the details of the study</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty extensive and complicated,</p>
<p>but basically what they did is that they had people do sauna</p>
<p>and then gave them a drug or a condition of having low,</p>
<p>not dangerously low, but low blood sugar,</p>
<p>or they had them in a condition</p>
<p>where they had low blood sugar and then did sauna,</p>
<p>or they had them do an exercise protocol</p>
<p>that led them to increase growth hormone</p>
<p>and then had them do low blood sugar,</p>
<p>basically mixing and matching the various stimuli</p>
<p>that could increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>And what they found was very straightforward.</p>
<p>What they found was that doing sauna once</p>
<p>and then waiting some period of time,</p>
<p>and then later that day doing sauna again,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t see the same increase</p>
<p>in growth hormone both times.</p>
<p>First, they got a big increase in growth hormone</p>
<p>and then less if they did sauna again.</p>
<p>If they had people do exercise and then sauna,</p>
<p>what they found was exercise could stimulate growth hormone,</p>
<p>but then following it with sauna</p>
<p>did not allow you to get twice as much growth hormone.</p>
<p>In general, anytime you release growth hormone,</p>
<p>you reduce the likelihood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to release growth hormone again</p>
<p>later that day.</p>
<p>And this partially explains that earlier study</p>
<p>where if people did this growth hormone</p>
<p>promoting protocol on day one,</p>
<p>but then on day three,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t see quite as big an effect,</p>
<p>and on day seven, they didn&rsquo;t see quite as big effect.</p>
<p>All it basically boils down to</p>
<p>is that if you really want to crank out the most amount</p>
<p>of growth hormone in response to sauna,</p>
<p>do it fasted or at least not having ingested any food</p>
<p>in the two or three hours before.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be deep into a fast.</p>
<p>And the whole notion of what breaks a fast</p>
<p>is kind of an interesting conversation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s contextual, right?</p>
<p>Will a sip of coffee break your fast?</p>
<p>Well, maybe, probably not.</p>
<p>Will one grain of sugar break your fast?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Will an entire candy bar break your fast?</p>
<p>Yes, it has to do with where your blood glucose is</p>
<p>when you ingest that particular food item,</p>
<p>not so much what that food item is per se.</p>
<p>But the bottom line here is if you want to crank out</p>
<p>the most amount of growth hormone,</p>
<p>wait a couple of hours after eating</p>
<p>before getting into the sauna,</p>
<p>or maybe do it before dinner and then prepare dinner,</p>
<p>do the sauna before dinner, that is,</p>
<p>then prepare dinner, then eat dinner,</p>
<p>and then make sure that you wait a few hours</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to arrange your schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>I know most people can&rsquo;t arrange their schedule perfectly</p>
<p>just to get growth hormone increases,</p>
<p>nor do I think people should approach</p>
<p>health protocols that way.</p>
<p>I think for 90% of people, 90% of the time,</p>
<p>just getting into the sauna once or twice</p>
<p>or three times a week is going to be beneficial</p>
<p>for the number of reasons that I described earlier.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to obsess too much</p>
<p>about the exact conditions you need</p>
<p>in order to get the greatest effect</p>
<p>out of that sauna treatment.</p>
<p>These are just some additional tweaks</p>
<p>related to food intake and low-level hypoglycemia</p>
<p>and exercise that if you wanted to leverage, you could.</p>
<p>So if decreases in body temperature</p>
<p>tend to aid the transition to sleep</p>
<p>and getting out of a hot sauna</p>
<p>tends to promote decreases in body temperature,</p>
<p>it makes sense why you would want to put</p>
<p>your sauna exposure or other deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>in the second half of your day</p>
<p>and maybe even right before sleep.</p>
<p>Now, regardless of what time of day you do sauna</p>
<p>or how frequently you do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to hydrate after going in the sauna.</p>
<p>When you go in the sauna, you lose water,</p>
<p>and when you lose water, you need to replace it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, you need water for all your cells,</p>
<p>but you also need electrolytes.</p>
<p>So make sure that you&rsquo;re replacing the water</p>
<p>that you lose in the sauna.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no exact formula of how much water to drink</p>
<p>and whether or not you need electrolytes</p>
<p>in that water or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on how much you sweat,</p>
<p>meaning how heat adapted you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on how much salt</p>
<p>you tend to excrete in your sweat,</p>
<p>huge amount of variation.</p>
<p>But in general, one way to approach this</p>
<p>would be to make sure that you drink</p>
<p>at least 16 ounces of water for every 10 minutes</p>
<p>that you happen to be in the sauna.</p>
<p>You could do that before and during and after,</p>
<p>you could do it during and after, or you could do it after.</p>
<p>Now, there are other reasons to do deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with cardiovascular effects,</p>
<p>nothing to do with growth hormone or anything of that sort,</p>
<p>but rather have to do with improvements</p>
<p>in mood and mental health.</p>
<p>In fact, the data related to sauna</p>
<p>and other forms of deliberate heat exposure improving mood</p>
<p>are very impressive, both at the mechanistic level</p>
<p>and in terms of the long-term consequences</p>
<p>that people experience.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to ask,</p>
<p>how is it that deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>can improve our mood and wellbeing?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that it improves mood and wellbeing,</p>
<p>but it also improves our capacity to feel good</p>
<p>in response to things that would ordinarily</p>
<p>make us feel somewhat good.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a situation where you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>walking around grinning ear to ear</p>
<p>in response to nothing at all,</p>
<p>simply because you went in a sauna.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is the up-regulation of pathways,</p>
<p>meaning chemical pathways in your brain and body</p>
<p>that allow you to experience pleasure in all its fullness.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this whole deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>sauna mood thing works.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard of endorphins.</p>
<p>Endorphins are a category of molecules</p>
<p>that are made naturally in your brain and body,</p>
<p>and that are released in response</p>
<p>to different forms of stressors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, in response to stressors.</p>
<p>So if ever you&rsquo;ve gone out on a long run,</p>
<p>and at some point in that run,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re aching and your joints hurt,</p>
<p>or maybe you have shin splints and you push through that,</p>
<p>part of the reason that you experience</p>
<p>a lack of pain at some point, usually,</p>
<p>or you experience a euphoria during or after that exercise</p>
<p>is the exercise-induced effects on endorphin release,</p>
<p>or rather to be more specific,</p>
<p>I should say the exercise-induced consequences</p>
<p>on the stress system,</p>
<p>which in turn trigger the release of endorphin.</p>
<p>In other words, when we experience short-term</p>
<p>or acute stress, the endorphin system is activated.</p>
<p>Now, the endorphin system is not just about feeling good,</p>
<p>believe it or not, it&rsquo;s also about feeling bad.</p>
<p>And there are two general categories of endorphins.</p>
<p>The first are the ones that you normally hear about,</p>
<p>endorphins, things that bind, for instance,</p>
<p>to receptors like the mu opioid receptor.</p>
<p>Opioids are not just prescribed compounds</p>
<p>or unfortunately drugs of abuse, which they are, right?</p>
<p>We have this opioid crisis in the United States</p>
<p>and elsewhere, which is a very serious and tragic thing,</p>
<p>but we make endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>We make endorphins that naturally act as pain relievers</p>
<p>and that make us feel mildly euphoric.</p>
<p>We also make endorphins such as dynorphin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s D-Y-N-O-R-P-H-I-N, dynorphin,</p>
<p>that actually make us feel worse in response to stressors.</p>
<p>When we get into a hot sauna</p>
<p>or a hot environment of any kind,</p>
<p>dynorphins are liberated in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And I should mention that dynorphins are made</p>
<p>by many neurons in many different areas of the brain.</p>
<p>So you might think, well, why would I want that?</p>
<p>Why would I want to release dynorphin into my brain and body?</p>
<p>Well, first of all,</p>
<p>when you get into an uncomfortably hot situation,</p>
<p>uncomfortably hot scenario,</p>
<p>oh gosh, this is sounding terrible,</p>
<p>in a deliberately hot environment</p>
<p>that you are using to try and trigger some sort of biological</p>
<p>or psychological benefit, I should say,</p>
<p>the discomfort that you feel,</p>
<p>the desire to get out of that environment</p>
<p>is in part the consequence of the release of dynorphin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the consequence of the activation</p>
<p>of that sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember, the preoptic area can communicate</p>
<p>with the amygdala and trigger that kind of fight</p>
<p>or flight mode, I want to get out of the sauna,</p>
<p>this is really, really hot.</p>
<p>But dynorphin is also liberated</p>
<p>from a certain number of neurons.</p>
<p>Dynorphin binds to what&rsquo;s called the kappa receptor.</p>
<p>The kappa receptor binds dynorphin</p>
<p>and triggers pathways in the brain and body</p>
<p>that lead to agitation, to stress,</p>
<p>and believe it or not, to a general sense of pain.</p>
<p>This is why you want to get out of the hot sauna.</p>
<p>And remember, if it&rsquo;s unsafe levels of hot,</p>
<p>then you should get out of that sauna</p>
<p>or other hot environment.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re working in a range</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re exposing yourself to a range of heat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortable but safe to be in,</p>
<p>dynorphin will be liberated from these neurons,</p>
<p>bind to the kappa receptor.</p>
<p>And as a downstream consequence of that,</p>
<p>there will be an increase in the receptors</p>
<p>that bind the other endorphins,</p>
<p>the endorphins that make you feel soothed,</p>
<p>that make you feel happy,</p>
<p>and that make you feel mild euphoria.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ve been a number of studies showing</p>
<p>that initially deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>by sauna or otherwise causes the release of dynorphin.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that every time we get into a hot environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortable or a cold environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortable, dynorphin is likely released</p>
<p>and binding to the kappa receptor.</p>
<p>But over time, that binding of dynorphin</p>
<p>to the kappa receptor leads to downstream changes</p>
<p>in the way that the feel-good endorphins,</p>
<p>things like endorphin binding to the mu-opioid receptor,</p>
<p>and there are still other feel-good endorphins, so to speak.</p>
<p>That system becomes much more efficient</p>
<p>such that people feel an elevation</p>
<p>in their baseline level of mood.</p>
<p>And when a good or happy event comes along,</p>
<p>they feel a heightened level of happiness or joy or awe</p>
<p>or improved mood in response to that.</p>
<p>This is not unlike the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>on the dopamine receptor that I&rsquo;ve described previously.</p>
<p>And for those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar with it,</p>
<p>many of you drink caffeine and love it.</p>
<p>Part of the reason you love it is because of the release</p>
<p>of certain neurochemicals like norepinephrine, et cetera,</p>
<p>the energy that it gives you, maybe the taste,</p>
<p>I would hope as well.</p>
<p>But caffeine ingestion also causes increases</p>
<p>in dopamine receptor concentration and efficacy.</p>
<p>In other words, it allows the receptors for dopamine</p>
<p>to work better so that for a given amount</p>
<p>of dopamine release,</p>
<p>you experience more pleasure and motivation.</p>
<p>This is a similar mechanism,</p>
<p>but within the endorphin pathway.</p>
<p>So what does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that a little bit of discomfort</p>
<p>as a consequence of deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>while in the short term doesn&rsquo;t feel good by definition,</p>
<p>it is activating pathways that are allowing</p>
<p>the feel good molecules and neural circuitries</p>
<p>that exist in your brain and body</p>
<p>to increase their efficiency,</p>
<p>placing you in a better position to be joyful</p>
<p>in response to the events of life.</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;m very excited about the data</p>
<p>on deliberate heat exposure and improvements</p>
<p>in the chemical systems that underlie good mood.</p>
<p>And just to underscore this further,</p>
<p>the dynorphin system is not unique to heat induced stress.</p>
<p>In fact, there are beautiful studies and reviews out there</p>
<p>about the role of dynorphin in stress and depression,</p>
<p>in stress and alcoholism, just as a brief aside.</p>
<p>And in the future,</p>
<p>we will do a whole episode on alcohol and alcoholism.</p>
<p>But it turns out that chronic alcohol use and alcoholism</p>
<p>causes changes in dopamine receptors</p>
<p>that make it very difficult for people to achieve pleasure</p>
<p>through things other than alcohol and even alcohol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the really diabolical nature of addiction,</p>
<p>which is the thing that initially brings pleasure,</p>
<p>eventually is just required</p>
<p>to maintain baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked before and Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>when she was a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>talked about the pleasure plane balance</p>
<p>that exists within the dopamine system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautifully described in her book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, by the way,</p>
<p>excellent book I recommend to all people, addicts or not.</p>
<p>Well, in that context of pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear what the pleasure molecule is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a molecule more related to motivation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>The pain molecule, however, appears to be dynorphin.</p>
<p>And the fact that dynorphin is dysregulated</p>
<p>in stress and depression and alcoholism,</p>
<p>and the relationship between dynorphin and dopamine</p>
<p>is something that we should all take very seriously.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I&rsquo;m very excited about the fact</p>
<p>that deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>can leverage the dynorphin system</p>
<p>in a short term in an acute way</p>
<p>that allows mood to improve after the sauna exposure.</p>
<p>So for those of you that don&rsquo;t like heat exposure,</p>
<p>keep in mind that a lot of the observed positive effects</p>
<p>on our biology relate to metabolism,</p>
<p>cardiovascular function, but also mental health.</p>
<p>And along those lines, there&rsquo;s a wonderful study,</p>
<p>again, published in 2018.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, I guess 2018 was a big year</p>
<p>for deliberate heat exposure studies.</p>
<p>The title of this study is</p>
<p>Sauna Bathing and Risk of Psychotic Disorders.</p>
<p>And this was a prospective cohort study.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting study</p>
<p>that explored the relationship between mental health,</p>
<p>so people suffering from various forms of psychoses,</p>
<p>schizophrenia and other forms of psychoses,</p>
<p>and use of sauna.</p>
<p>So essentially what this study did</p>
<p>is they looked at a very large number of subjects,</p>
<p>more than 2000 subjects</p>
<p>who had no history of psychotic disorders.</p>
<p>They were classified into three groups</p>
<p>based on their frequency of sauna use,</p>
<p>either once a week, two to three times per week,</p>
<p>or four to seven times per week.</p>
<p>This should call to mind that earlier study</p>
<p>on all risk mortality and cardiovascular event risk.</p>
<p>And then they explored the hazard ratio</p>
<p>for psychosis specifically,</p>
<p>meaning how likely it was</p>
<p>that people would develop psychotic symptoms</p>
<p>or full-blown psychotic illness</p>
<p>according to their frequency of sauna session.</p>
<p>So again, this isn&rsquo;t causal, this is correlative.</p>
<p>And according to the data in this study,</p>
<p>what they concluded is that there was a strong</p>
<p>and inverse independent association</p>
<p>between frequent sauna bathing</p>
<p>and the future risk of psychotic disorders</p>
<p>in this population.</p>
<p>Now, this does not mean</p>
<p>that going into a sauna seven times per week</p>
<p>is going to prevent people</p>
<p>from becoming schizophrenic necessarily,</p>
<p>or from having a psychotic episode necessarily.</p>
<p>And of course, frequent sauna use</p>
<p>will be related to other health promoting activities.</p>
<p>But in this study, as in the previous study,</p>
<p>they went to great lengths</p>
<p>in order to try and limit</p>
<p>those so-called confounding variables.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is just one study.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s correlative, not causal,</p>
<p>but based on the large number of subjects they included,</p>
<p>plus the rigor of the statistical analysis,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to see a general picture</p>
<p>that using the sorts of sauna protocols</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve described throughout this episode, right?</p>
<p>Five to 20 minutes or so,</p>
<p>done one to seven times per week</p>
<p>is associated with a general improvement</p>
<p>in cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>a general improvement in mental health.</p>
<p>And it really points to the fact that,</p>
<p>yes, sauna done acutely for three or four times a day,</p>
<p>30 minutes each session, separated by cooling,</p>
<p>maybe getting into a cold bath.</p>
<p>Sure, that can potently increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>but done on a more regular basis can reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>improve heart health, improve mental health.</p>
<p>And for that reason,</p>
<p>and the fact that for most people,</p>
<p>it is conceivable to come up with a way</p>
<p>that you could get into deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>for a minimum of cost, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a hot bath,</p>
<p>or if you had to resort to bundling up</p>
<p>and going for a jog, this sort of thing,</p>
<p>or if you have access to it, a sauna of some sort,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really talking about a stimulus</p>
<p>to initiate a large number of different biological cascades</p>
<p>that wick out to improve multiple aspects</p>
<p>of brain and body health.</p>
<p>So up until now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about whole body heating.</p>
<p>So for instance, putting your whole body into the sauna,</p>
<p>which of course is what most people do,</p>
<p>or getting into a hot tub or hot bath up to your neck,</p>
<p>or in the cases where we were talking</p>
<p>about deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>as a means to increase core body temperature and metabolism,</p>
<p>getting into an ice bath or cold water</p>
<p>of some sort up to your neck or into a cold shower, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about deliberately heating</p>
<p>or cooling specific parts of the body,</p>
<p>meaning certain surface areas of your body</p>
<p>as a means to get effects on those particular areas,</p>
<p>as well as at the whole body level.</p>
<p>Numerous times throughout this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the dangers of overheating.</p>
<p>So what should you do if you think you</p>
<p>or someone else is hyperthermic, is too hot?</p>
<p>Well, if you understand just a little bit</p>
<p>about the cooling and heating systems of your shell and core,</p>
<p>there are some terrific tools that you can use</p>
<p>in order to cool off your core quickly.</p>
<p>And remember, the core consists of the nervous system,</p>
<p>the spinal cord, and the viscera,</p>
<p>which are really the organs you&rsquo;re trying to protect.</p>
<p>So being able to cool off the core of your body quickly</p>
<p>can be very beneficial,</p>
<p>and in some cases could even save your life.</p>
<p>There is a way to more quickly heat or cool the body,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s through specific elements of your shell,</p>
<p>meaning particular skin surfaces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked extensively about this in the episode on cold.</p>
<p>It was also covered in the episode with my guest,</p>
<p>Dr. Craig Heller from the biology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>It relates to the so-called glabrous skin surfaces</p>
<p>on the upper half of our face, palms of our hands,</p>
<p>and the bottoms of our feet.</p>
<p>And for those of you that heard this before,</p>
<p>I encourage you to continue to listen nonetheless,</p>
<p>because today I&rsquo;m going to talk about specifically</p>
<p>how to heat the body or cool the body</p>
<p>through these glabrous skin surfaces.</p>
<p>Very briefly, the mechanism is as follows.</p>
<p>The palms of our hands, the bottoms of our feet,</p>
<p>and the upper half of our face</p>
<p>overlies specific types of vasculature,</p>
<p>meaning specific types of veins and arteries</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have capillaries between them.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, heat and cold can move very quickly</p>
<p>from the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>and the upper half of our face</p>
<p>and change our core body temperature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a name for these particular vascular structures.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called AVAs or arteriovenous asthmosis.</p>
<p>Basically veins and arteries interacting directly</p>
<p>without capillaries in between,</p>
<p>which allows cooling of blood or heating of blood</p>
<p>much more quickly than is possible</p>
<p>by applying colder heat elsewhere on the body</p>
<p>where capillaries intervene between veins and arteries.</p>
<p>These AVAs, arteriovenous asthmosis,</p>
<p>can be leveraged to cool off</p>
<p>your core body temperature very quickly.</p>
<p>The key thing is to get the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>the bottoms of your feet,</p>
<p>and the upper half of your face</p>
<p>in contact with a cold surface or fluid</p>
<p>that is cold enough to cool the blood</p>
<p>and the core of your body,</p>
<p>but not so cold that it constricts the veins</p>
<p>just below the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>bottoms of your feet, or the upper half of your face.</p>
<p>So not placing ice packs necessarily,</p>
<p>but maybe placing cool towels on the bottoms of feet,</p>
<p>the palms of the hands, and the upper half of the face,</p>
<p>and as they warm up,</p>
<p>replacing those with other cool towels.</p>
<p>The exact temperature will depend</p>
<p>on how hot you happen to be.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>without knowing your particular circumstances.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more</p>
<p>about how to cool off your core very quickly</p>
<p>and some of the details</p>
<p>and some of the technologies</p>
<p>that are being developed to do that,</p>
<p>please see the episode I did with Craig Heller</p>
<p>or the episode on cold.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to go to those episodes,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a good procedure that you could use.</p>
<p>You could grab, for instance,</p>
<p>a package of frozen broccoli or frozen blueberries.</p>
<p>If someone is really, really warm,</p>
<p>make sure they take off their shoes and socks,</p>
<p>get their feet on top of those.</p>
<p>Ideally, you get some into their hands as well.</p>
<p>Get some cool compresses and get them onto people&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>You could, of course,</p>
<p>also put a cool compress on the back of the neck,</p>
<p>on the top of the head.</p>
<p>That would be an especially good idea</p>
<p>if someone were hyperthermic</p>
<p>because of the way that cooling of the brain occurs</p>
<p>under conditions of hyperthermia.</p>
<p>But the key point here is that just putting cold compresses</p>
<p>or cold materials onto somebody&rsquo;s torso</p>
<p>is not going to be as efficient</p>
<p>as cooling those glabrous skin surfaces,</p>
<p>the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands</p>
<p>and the upper half of their face.</p>
<p>Similarly, or I suppose to be more accurate,</p>
<p>I should say conversely,</p>
<p>there are times when it is desirable</p>
<p>to heat the core of the body.</p>
<p>And once again, just simply throwing a hot towel</p>
<p>over somebody is not going to be the most efficient way.</p>
<p>If someone is hypothermic, they&rsquo;re too cold,</p>
<p>it is not a problem to cover them with a blanket,</p>
<p>but ideally what you do is you use some warm object</p>
<p>or warm fluid to warm the bottoms of their feet,</p>
<p>their hands and the upper half of their face.</p>
<p>Of course, not so warm that you burn those skin surfaces.</p>
<p>This has actually been examined</p>
<p>in studies from the Heller lab.</p>
<p>Turns out that for instance,</p>
<p>to get people out of anesthesia,</p>
<p>it is beneficial to warm their core body temperature.</p>
<p>And of course there is fever,</p>
<p>which you should know is an adaptive response.</p>
<p>While fever is uncomfortable,</p>
<p>and in fact often involves a mismatch</p>
<p>between our perception of our shell</p>
<p>and a perception of our core temperature.</p>
<p>In other words, there are times</p>
<p>when our body temperature is really high, we have a fever,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;re shivering, we&rsquo;re cold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because under conditions of fever,</p>
<p>the immune system liberates certain molecules</p>
<p>that impact and in some ways intentionally disrupt</p>
<p>the preoptic area, the POA,</p>
<p>and the way it normally functions,</p>
<p>so that it can override peripheral signals</p>
<p>and simply try and heat the body</p>
<p>and kill whatever pathogen has infected the body.</p>
<p>So for those of you that think about fever</p>
<p>as always a bad thing, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we don&rsquo;t want our core body temperature</p>
<p>to go so high that tissues of the brain and body are damaged.</p>
<p>This is one reason why if a fever ever goes above 103,</p>
<p>you need to start getting a little bit worried, 104.</p>
<p>There are times when you need to call an ambulance</p>
<p>or go to a hospital.</p>
<p>You really need to employ cooling methods</p>
<p>of the sort that I talked about before</p>
<p>to prevent hyperthermia.</p>
<p>Of course, safe ranges for body temperature vary</p>
<p>between infants and adults.</p>
<p>So you can look those up online,</p>
<p>depending on the person&rsquo;s age,</p>
<p>what is a safe range, what is not.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that if you are taking compounds,</p>
<p>pills to reduce your fever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually short-circuiting the protective mechanism</p>
<p>for burning up the pathogen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because most pathogens, bacteria and viruses,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t survive well at high temperatures.</p>
<p>In fact, in laboratories,</p>
<p>if we want to preserve a virus for use,</p>
<p>we put it into a freezer.</p>
<p>If we want to kill a virus, we heat inoculate it.</p>
<p>So in many ways, fever is your natural form</p>
<p>of heat inoculation designed to kill pathogens</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>Now last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>I want to refer to the study that I described</p>
<p>at the very beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>involving what&rsquo;s called local hyperthermia</p>
<p>in order to trigger a number of biological processes</p>
<p>in fat tissue, in order to convert white fat to beige fat,</p>
<p>which is the metabolically active form of fat.</p>
<p>Many of you, or at least some of you,</p>
<p>should be familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase brown fat stores,</p>
<p>these mitochondrial dense fat stores</p>
<p>that can in turn allow a person to feel more comfortable</p>
<p>in cold temperatures, water or otherwise,</p>
<p>and increase core metabolism.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the episode on cold,</p>
<p>but very briefly, the general protocol,</p>
<p>again, is to get 11 minutes total per week</p>
<p>of uncomfortable yet safe, deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>either through ice bath, cold shower,</p>
<p>cold immersion up to the neck,</p>
<p>or some other form of cold exposure.</p>
<p>That triggers increases in brown fat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been beautifully shown by Dr. Susanna Soberg.</p>
<p>And that increase in brown fat</p>
<p>in turn increases core metabolism</p>
<p>and one&rsquo;s ability to feel comfortable in cold temperatures.</p>
<p>This was a study done in humans,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s now ample evidence from animal models</p>
<p>to support that this is a general phenomenon</p>
<p>that I think most people could use and benefit from.</p>
<p>Local hyperthermia is a distinctly different phenomenon.</p>
<p>It involves heating a particular surface of the body</p>
<p>as a way to convert the white fat at that location</p>
<p>to beige fat, which in turn leads</p>
<p>to more systemic increases in thermogenesis</p>
<p>and increases in metabolism,</p>
<p>and believe it or not, in fat loss.</p>
<p>Now, the study that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is a very recent study that was published again</p>
<p>in this terrific apex journal, Cell, Cell Press Journal.</p>
<p>And again, one of the three top journals,</p>
<p>Nature Science and Cell are the three top journals.</p>
<p>Top because they&rsquo;re the most competitive,</p>
<p>but also generally, not always,</p>
<p>but generally the most stringent</p>
<p>in terms of the review process.</p>
<p>Papers that make it into these three journals</p>
<p>generally are very, very high quality.</p>
<p>And certainly enough people see them</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re not of high quality,</p>
<p>they get shot down pretty quickly</p>
<p>in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Whereas papers in other journals</p>
<p>can sometimes last a long time</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;re ever replicated, et cetera.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Local Hyperthermia Therapy Induces Browning of White Fat</p>
<p>and Treats Obesity.</p>
<p>This was a study that was performed on mice</p>
<p>and humans in the same study.</p>
<p>What the study involved was heating</p>
<p>of a local patch of skin to 41 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>which is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>but not damaging the skin, okay?</p>
<p>So the methods of heating did not involve</p>
<p>placing something on the skin that would damage it.</p>
<p>In fact, in the study on the mice,</p>
<p>they use this kind of clever molecular chicanery</p>
<p>in order to do it.</p>
<p>And in humans, they used a thermocouple</p>
<p>that would allow them to heat the skin up just locally,</p>
<p>in particular locations on the body</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>They refer to this process as LHT or local heat therapy.</p>
<p>The reason they did this is worth considering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long been known from clinical data,</p>
<p>and in fact, from a bit of research data</p>
<p>that people that experience burn on a small,</p>
<p>or unfortunately in some circumstances,</p>
<p>a significant portion of their body,</p>
<p>experience overall decreases in body fat</p>
<p>and increases in metabolism that can last many years.</p>
<p>Now, of course, is not reasonable,</p>
<p>nor would one ever want to induce burn</p>
<p>in order to induce fat loss.</p>
<p>But the observed increases in metabolism and fat loss</p>
<p>in response to skin surface burn couldn&rsquo;t be explained</p>
<p>by reductions in activity related to the burn, for instance.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are molecular pathways</p>
<p>related to something called UCP1,</p>
<p>which is uncoupling protein one.</p>
<p>I talked about this also in the cold episode,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t worry if you didn&rsquo;t see that episode,</p>
<p>or if you choose not to.</p>
<p>UCP1 has the ability to increase mitochondrial function</p>
<p>in ways that increase core body temperature overall,</p>
<p>in particular in beige and brown fat,</p>
<p>which are these fat cells that exist</p>
<p>generally along our spine,</p>
<p>and in particular in the upper part of our back</p>
<p>and around our neck and clavicles.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re responsible for acting as a sort of a candle,</p>
<p>or I should say the fuel or the fat of a candle</p>
<p>that can be burned up to manufacture heat in the body.</p>
<p>So if you normally think about fat</p>
<p>and you think about blubbery fat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about white fat,</p>
<p>which again is just a storage site.</p>
<p>Beige fat and brown fat exist at just a few locations,</p>
<p>mainly internally around our spinal cord and our clavicles.</p>
<p>And those fat stores are responsible</p>
<p>for generating heat in our body.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very metabolically active form of fat.</p>
<p>Small children have a lot of brown fat and beige fat,</p>
<p>in particular because very young children</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t shiver.</p>
<p>A number of you probably didn&rsquo;t know that,</p>
<p>but very young children can&rsquo;t shiver.</p>
<p>So they need some way to generate heat</p>
<p>in order to make sure that they stay alive</p>
<p>if they were ever to get cold.</p>
<p>This is also probably the reason why</p>
<p>little kids can run around on a cold day outside</p>
<p>without their shirt on,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even seem to notice</p>
<p>whereas adults are freezing cold.</p>
<p>As we get older,</p>
<p>the amount of beige and brown fat</p>
<p>tends to either reduce or shrink or disappear entirely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still debated, which happens.</p>
<p>But we know that white fat can be converted</p>
<p>to this more metabolically active form of beige fat</p>
<p>by deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>according to the protocol I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And now it seems based on this new study,</p>
<p>that local heating of skin tissue can also induce UCP-1</p>
<p>and the effects of UCP-1 on increasing mitochondria.</p>
<p>And in fact, that local hyperthermia 41 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>that is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>can actually induce the conversion of white fat to beige fat.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And I can already predict the way</p>
<p>this is probably going to go in the kind of wellness</p>
<p>and biohacking and longevity communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that pretty soon they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>people putting heating pads on different fat pads</p>
<p>of theirs on their body,</p>
<p>trying to reduce or at least convert the white fat</p>
<p>into beige fat.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe that&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>There have not been many controlled studies of this yet.</p>
<p>This is the first, at least to my knowledge</p>
<p>of such studies looking at this in non-burn conditions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the data are mechanistically</p>
<p>even more interesting than this whole business about UCP-1.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Local hyperthermia using the protocol</p>
<p>that I described before,</p>
<p>resulted in the increase of a promoter,</p>
<p>which is essentially a mechanism by which certain genes</p>
<p>regulate their activity.</p>
<p>This is a DNA binding of something called HSF-1.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go too deep into the mechanism here</p>
<p>or the nomenclature,</p>
<p>but HSF stands for heat shock factor one.</p>
<p>And HSF-1 binding to a particular location in the genome</p>
<p>allowed for a different molecule with a very long name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell it to you for fun,</p>
<p>but you can just let the numbers and letters stream by.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>HNRNPA2B1 shortened to A2B1,</p>
<p>which frankly is not that short to begin with.</p>
<p>A2B1 is still a name that should be meaningless</p>
<p>to most everybody, but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>A2B1 is directly involved in glucose and lipid metabolism</p>
<p>and regulates the genes that control glucose</p>
<p>and lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>So here we have a situation where local heating of skin</p>
<p>converted a metabolically sluggish or inactive cell type,</p>
<p>the white fat cell into the metabolically charging,</p>
<p>so to speak, beige fat cell,</p>
<p>which in turn led to systemic,</p>
<p>meaning body-wide increases in metabolism</p>
<p>through two mechanism.</p>
<p>One mechanism is this increase in UCP1,</p>
<p>which for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>UCP1 causes shifts in the way that potential energy</p>
<p>is pushed from the protons through the mitochondria,</p>
<p>basically more mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>which means more ATP,</p>
<p>which means cells are more active,</p>
<p>AKA increased metabolism,</p>
<p>and increases in things like heat shock factor one</p>
<p>and A2B1, which are involved in lipid</p>
<p>and glucose metabolism and regulation.</p>
<p>So I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>This study does not say that spot reduction is possible</p>
<p>with local heating of tissue.</p>
<p>I just can see it now that once this paper gets out</p>
<p>into the press, people are going to say,</p>
<p>oh, heating up a certain patch of skin is going to burn fat</p>
<p>or convert fat to some other cell type at that location.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s not the way it works.</p>
<p>They did observe increases in beige fat cells</p>
<p>at certain locations in the body,</p>
<p>but those increases in beige fat occurred</p>
<p>where beige fat cells always reside,</p>
<p>around the spine, the upper neck, the clavicles, and so on.</p>
<p>This is exciting because it provides</p>
<p>yet another potential mechanism</p>
<p>in addition to deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to increase beige fat,</p>
<p>meaning the metabolically active form of fat cell.</p>
<p>It also nicely provides a mechanism</p>
<p>or at least a potential mechanism</p>
<p>for the observation that burn</p>
<p>either small patch of skin being burned,</p>
<p>or again, sadly, large patches of skin being burned,</p>
<p>leading to these very extreme</p>
<p>and very long lasting increases</p>
<p>in body fat loss and metabolism.</p>
<p>What, if anything, should you do with this information?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I want to very much caution people</p>
<p>about putting anything so hot</p>
<p>that it can damage the surface of your skin onto your skin.</p>
<p>That would be a terrible idea.</p>
<p>However, I do predict a time not too far from now</p>
<p>where people will start to explore</p>
<p>the use of local skin heating</p>
<p>as a means to increase the conversion</p>
<p>of white to beige fat,</p>
<p>and in turn for beige fat stores</p>
<p>to increase metabolism overall</p>
<p>and maybe even improve glucose metabolism and thermogenesis.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like more details about this study,</p>
<p>we will provide a link to it in the show notes caption.</p>
<p>I should mention that the study,</p>
<p>at least the portion of the study</p>
<p>that was focused on humans</p>
<p>involved roughly equal numbers of males and females.</p>
<p>The subjects followed their normal daily schedule,</p>
<p>including time and composition of meals, they say,</p>
<p>rest and active hours, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The local hypothermia therapy was done in the following way.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing from their methods section.</p>
<p>The subjects were seated in upright posture.</p>
<p>They were wearing a standard test robe</p>
<p>with the head and neck and shoulders unclothed</p>
<p>and one meter away from a thermal imaging camera,</p>
<p>which could basically measure the temperature</p>
<p>at their skin surface to make sure</p>
<p>that it remained constant across subjects and yet safe.</p>
<p>The supraclavicular fat deposits,</p>
<p>meaning the upper shoulders and upper back area</p>
<p>were exposed to this thermal source,</p>
<p>again, 41 degrees for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so it was 41 degrees for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And their core temperatures and skin temperatures</p>
<p>were monitored before and after</p>
<p>this local hypothermic therapy.</p>
<p>The subjects were exposed</p>
<p>to this local hypothermia therapy three days per week,</p>
<p>separated by day, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
<p>So they had weekends off for five weeks total</p>
<p>after which their data were collected.</p>
<p>And the study has a number</p>
<p>of other really interesting features</p>
<p>that are sure to lead to increased understanding</p>
<p>of both mechanism and new protocols,</p>
<p>such as analysis of the genes and proteins</p>
<p>that are activated downstream</p>
<p>of this local hypothermia therapy.</p>
<p>I find these data incredibly interesting,</p>
<p>in part because of the ways</p>
<p>that local hypothermia therapy</p>
<p>mimics deliberate cold exposure therapy.</p>
<p>Same downstream mechanisms,</p>
<p>UCP-1 and some of the other pathways are involved.</p>
<p>And all of that points to a somewhat new,</p>
<p>but certainly an important concept.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard of hormesis,</p>
<p>which is the subjecting of oneself or others, I suppose,</p>
<p>to enough stress to induce an adaptation of some kind.</p>
<p>So hormesis is the reason why</p>
<p>if you get into cold water repeatedly,</p>
<p>at first it&rsquo;s very painful psychologically</p>
<p>and over time you get used to it.</p>
<p>You never get completely used to it,</p>
<p>but you get more used to it.</p>
<p>Hormesis is also used to describe the adaptation</p>
<p>to cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>or to the hard rep sets of resistance training</p>
<p>and the growth of muscles or the strengthening of muscles</p>
<p>or the improvement in cardiovascular function</p>
<p>to endurance exercise and so forth.</p>
<p>Hormesis is a somewhat common term nowadays.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard it, now you&rsquo;ve heard it.</p>
<p>In this paper, they describe what is called mitohormesis,</p>
<p>which is in essence,</p>
<p>the fact that any number of different stressful stimuli,</p>
<p>provided they activate UCP1</p>
<p>and some of these other pathways that I just described,</p>
<p>like HSF1, can induce changes in the mitochondria</p>
<p>that lead to increases in metabolism.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us that cold and heat</p>
<p>can both lead to increases in metabolism</p>
<p>and conversion of white fat to beige fat.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us because both pathways are stress.</p>
<p>Local hyperthermia is stress.</p>
<p>Burn certainly is stress.</p>
<p>Sauna is a form of stress.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure is a form of stress.</p>
<p>Exercise is a form of stress.</p>
<p>And the adaptation to those stressors is not infinite.</p>
<p>All of those protocols, any protocol for that matter,</p>
<p>is going to be effective because it&rsquo;s going to converge</p>
<p>on an existing internal biological mechanism.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no unique mechanism for each protocol.</p>
<p>Each protocol that I&rsquo;ve talked about today,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s five minutes or 20 minutes</p>
<p>or four times in a day or three times per week</p>
<p>or seven times per week,</p>
<p>is tickling or pushing or stomping, if you will,</p>
<p>on a given pathway and really activating it</p>
<p>to a mild or to severe degree.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do today is to illustrate</p>
<p>the general mechanisms by which heat in particular</p>
<p>can activate certain biological pathways</p>
<p>so that you can devise protocols</p>
<p>that are going to be optimal for you and your needs.</p>
<p>So just to briefly recap,</p>
<p>if you want to get the greatest growth hormone increases,</p>
<p>do sauna or other deliberate heat exposure fairly seldom,</p>
<p>probably no more than once per week, maybe even less,</p>
<p>and do it a lot that day.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you break it up into multiple sessions.</p>
<p>In the study I described earlier,</p>
<p>they did four sessions, 30 minutes each,</p>
<p>but that was just once a week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the cardiovascular benefits</p>
<p>and the potential longevity benefits of sauna,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s clear that doing it three to four,</p>
<p>maybe even seven times per week</p>
<p>is going to be more beneficial</p>
<p>than doing it just one or three times per week.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that for those of you interested</p>
<p>in the general health effects of sauna,</p>
<p>about an hour per week broken up into three sessions</p>
<p>makes the most sense based on my read of the data.</p>
<p>And again, that range of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>is going to be your guide.</p>
<p>And in terms of the mental health benefits,</p>
<p>it seems that getting a little bit uncomfortable</p>
<p>in that heat environment, sauna or otherwise,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>is going to be the best way to access</p>
<p>those mental health effects</p>
<p>by way of increasing dynorphin,</p>
<p>which as you recall,</p>
<p>will then increase the ability of endorphin</p>
<p>to have its positive effects on mood</p>
<p>after you get out of the sauna</p>
<p>or other deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>And in terms of timing,</p>
<p>after a workout of any kind,</p>
<p>morning or afternoon,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not doing it after a workout,</p>
<p>certainly in the later part of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be most beneficial as it relates to sleep.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s a caveat there,</p>
<p>which I will mention again,</p>
<p>which is that for those of you</p>
<p>that have no trouble sleeping because you&rsquo;re exhausted</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just one of these phenomenal sleepers,</p>
<p>well then do it any time of day or night.</p>
<p>But for most people doing it later in the day</p>
<p>is going to be more beneficial</p>
<p>because of the post sauna cooling effect</p>
<p>and the relationship between cooling by a degree or more</p>
<p>as a way to enter sleep.</p>
