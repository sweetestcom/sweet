    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Robert Proctor,</p>
<p>historian at Stanford University,</p>
<p>specializing in 20th century science, technology,</p>
<p>and medicine, especially the history</p>
<p>of the most controversial aspects of those fields.</p>
<p>Please allow me to say a few words</p>
<p>about science and the nature of truth.</p>
<p>The word science is often used as an ideal</p>
<p>for a methodology that can help us escape the limitation</p>
<p>of any one human mind in the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>The underlying idea here is that individual humans</p>
<p>are too easily corrupted by bias, emotion,</p>
<p>personal experience, and the usual human craving</p>
<p>for meaning, money, power, and fame.</p>
<p>And the hope is that the tools of science</p>
<p>can help us overcome these limitations</p>
<p>in striving for deeper and deeper understanding</p>
<p>of objective reality, from physics to chemistry,</p>
<p>biology, genetics, and even psychology,</p>
<p>cognitive science, and neuroscience.</p>
<p>But history shows that these tools of science</p>
<p>are not devoid of human flaws,</p>
<p>of influence from human institutions,</p>
<p>of manipulation from people in power.</p>
<p>As we talk about in this conversation with Robert Proctor,</p>
<p>in the 1930s and 40s, there was the Nazi science</p>
<p>and there was communist science,</p>
<p>and each had fundamentally different ideas</p>
<p>about, for example, genetics and biology of disease.</p>
<p>This history also shows that scientists can be corrupted</p>
<p>slowly or quickly by fear, fame, money,</p>
<p>or just the ideological narratives of a charismatic leader</p>
<p>that convinces each scientist and the scientific community</p>
<p>that their work matters for the greater cause of humanity,</p>
<p>even if that cause involves the genetic purification</p>
<p>of a people, the extermination of a cancer,</p>
<p>and the unrestricted experimentation</p>
<p>on the bodies of living beings who do not have a voice,</p>
<p>whose suffering will never be heard.</p>
<p>All of this for the greater good.</p>
<p>In some periods of human history,</p>
<p>science was deeply influenced by the ideology</p>
<p>of governments and individuals.</p>
<p>In some, less so.</p>
<p>The hard truth is that we can&rsquo;t know for sure</p>
<p>about which of the two periods we&rsquo;re living through today.</p>
<p>So let us not too quickly dismiss the voices</p>
<p>of experts and non-experts alike</p>
<p>that ask the simple question of,</p>
<p>wait, are we doing the right thing here?</p>
<p>Are we helping or hurting?</p>
<p>Are we adding suffering to the world</p>
<p>or are we alleviating it?</p>
<p>Most such voices are nothing more than martyrs</p>
<p>seeking fame, not truth, and they will be proven wrong.</p>
<p>But some may help prevent future atrocities</p>
<p>and suffering at a global scale.</p>
<p>Let us then move forward with humility</p>
<p>so that history will remember this period</p>
<p>as one of human flourishing</p>
<p>and where science lived up to its highest ideal.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>First is Theragun, the device I use</p>
<p>for post-workout muscle recovery.</p>
<p>Second is BetterHelp, an online therapy service.</p>
<p>Third is Indeed, a hiring website.</p>
<p>Fourth is Grammarly, a service I use</p>
<p>to check spelling, grammar, and readability.</p>
<p>And fifth is Eight Sleep,</p>
<p>a self-cooling mattress cover I sleep on.</p>
<p>So the choice is health, wealth, or linguistic eloquence.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Theragun,</p>
<p>a handheld percussive therapy device</p>
<p>that I use after a workout for muscle recovery.</p>
<p>The kind of workout I&rsquo;ve been doing recently,</p>
<p>I just ran 15 miles today, so I&rsquo;m getting the miles up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, unfortunately, do that every single day.</p>
<p>The body&rsquo;s still not quite there.</p>
<p>I do a run every other day,</p>
<p>or sometimes if I&rsquo;m super lazy, and I am super lazy,</p>
<p>I do a run and then rest for two days.</p>
<p>And what I mean by rest is I instead do pushups and pull-ups.</p>
<p>And for whatever hurts, just some basic recovery,</p>
<p>I use Theragun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly quiet, easy to use,</p>
<p>comes with a great app that guides you</p>
<p>through everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Try it for 30 days at therabody.com slash lex.</p>
<p>Theragun Gen 4 has an OLED screen,</p>
<p>personalized Theragun app,</p>
<p>and is both quiet and powerful, starting at $199.</p>
<p>Go to therabody.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also sponsored by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P, help.</p>
<p>They figure out what you need</p>
<p>and match you with a licensed professional therapist</p>
<p>in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>I just mentioned running.</p>
<p>That is where I go to face my demons,</p>
<p>to face my own thoughts,</p>
<p>to face the memories, the darker memories,</p>
<p>the memories I haven&rsquo;t quite dealt with</p>
<p>or have been able to make sense of.</p>
<p>Or for some reason, they bother me when they shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I need to understand why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what therapy is about.</p>
<p>So for me, thinking through a third-person perspective,</p>
<p>reflection on my own mind,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I do when I run,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I do when I meditate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I do when I have conversations in a podcast,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I think is what makes talk therapy powerful.</p>
<p>So go with BetterHelp</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s like, all right, okay,</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll have to shut off for many hours,</p>
<p>but a nap for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And then when you wake up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the world is new again.</p>

<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Robert Proctor.</p>
<p>What is the story of science and scientists</p>
<p>during the rise, rule, and fall of the Third Reich?</p>
<p>Well, we tend to think of science</p>
<p>as always on the side of liberty,</p>
<p>as always on the side of enlightenment,</p>
<p>as always on the side of enlarging human possibility.</p>
<p>And here we have this phenomenon in the 1930s</p>
<p>of really the world&rsquo;s leading scientific power,</p>
<p>the Third Reich,</p>
<p>which collectively had won a big chunk</p>
<p>of all the Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>Suddenly they go fascist, they go Nazi with Hitler.</p>
<p>And instead of being primarily a source of resistance,</p>
<p>science in many respects actually is a full collaborator</p>
<p>in the most horrific forms of Nazi genocide, Nazi exclusion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a relatively untold story</p>
<p>in the sense that when we think of science</p>
<p>in the Third Reich, we think of Joseph Mengele</p>
<p>injecting dye into the eyes of twins,</p>
<p>or we think of horrific human experiments,</p>
<p>and those are real.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the story of a huge scientific apparatus,</p>
<p>a bureaucracy, you could almost say,</p>
<p>participating in every phase</p>
<p>of the campaigns of Nazi destruction.</p>
<p>And what I looked at in particular in,</p>
<p>actually in my first book,</p>
<p>was how physicians in particular,</p>
<p>but also biomedical science,</p>
<p>was collaborating with the regime</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s wrong to think of the Nazi regime</p>
<p>as anti-science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anti a particular type of science.</p>
<p>In particular, it was radically against</p>
<p>what they called Jewish science, communist science.</p>
<p>Certain types of science they did not like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole nature-nurture dispute in that period,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re firmly on the side of nature,</p>
<p>which interestingly gives rise to a very different</p>
<p>type of science in the Soviet Union, by the way.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is more on the nurture side?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is on the side of the nurture side</p>
<p>in the dimension of genetics,</p>
<p>and this is sort of an untold story.</p>
<p>I was actually gonna write a book about it</p>
<p>until I was barred from access to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been different times in my life</p>
<p>where I was a Russianist.</p>
<p>A Russianist, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna have to talk about that.</p>
<p>I got excluded from fulfilling that dream,</p>
<p>but one of the things I was gonna look at</p>
<p>when I got a Fulbright in the 1980s</p>
<p>was to go over and look at the anti-Nazi genetics</p>
<p>and anthropology of the Soviets,</p>
<p>and how a lot of their Lysenko-ist Lamarckism</p>
<p>was actually anti-Nazi anti-genetics</p>
<p>on the nurture side of nature,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really an untold story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable story,</p>
<p>because it sounds like we might wanna make heroes</p>
<p>out of the twisting of science in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, there are these interesting complexities,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s amazing about Nazi science</p>
<p>is how there was this collaboration,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about a culture</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re inventing things like electron microscopy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing all kinds of studies in anthropology,</p>
<p>so a lot of that&rsquo;s an untold story.</p>
<p>So what was the connection</p>
<p>between the ideology and the science,</p>
<p>if you can just link on it longer?</p>
<p>Well, we tend to think of science and ideology</p>
<p>as completely separate</p>
<p>when I think the reality is they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>If you look at why the Mayans in the 7th and 8th century AD</p>
<p>had the world&rsquo;s most accurate calendar,</p>
<p>accurate to within 17 seconds per year,</p>
<p>that was all part of a ritual practice</p>
<p>to celebrate the rise of Kukulkan,</p>
<p>the rise of Venus with what&rsquo;s called the heliacal rising,</p>
<p>namely the rising of Venus before the rising of the sun,</p>
<p>at which moment Venus is destroyed</p>
<p>by the light of the sun.</p>
<p>Well, they developed this elaborate calendrical astronomy</p>
<p>which required detailed observation,</p>
<p>detailed chronicling of the movement of the heavens,</p>
<p>in particular the planets,</p>
<p>for the purpose of celebrating this cycle of renewal</p>
<p>that they thought was sacred and holy and magical.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s the ideology, where&rsquo;s the science?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the sort of instrumentation, the calendrics,</p>
<p>the measurement, all in the service of this magical moment,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s true of a lot of science.</p>
<p>I had a friend years ago who was Mennonite</p>
<p>and wanted to study solar cells</p>
<p>and to improve silicon chips</p>
<p>to make more efficient solar energy.</p>
<p>There was no money for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, when Ronald Reagan took office,</p>
<p>the budgets for solar and alternative energy</p>
<p>were essentially zeroed out,</p>
<p>and Reagan takes off the solar panels</p>
<p>off of the roof of the White House.</p>
<p>So my friend ends up working on hardening silicon chips</p>
<p>against nuclear war.</p>
<p>So he becomes part of the nuclear war</p>
<p>protection defense apparatus,</p>
<p>even though he wanted to work on alternative energy,</p>
<p>doing very similar work with silicon chips,</p>
<p>but in a different framework.</p>
<p>And so the practices of science often gets pushed into</p>
<p>and is woven into ideological practices,</p>
<p>sort of in the same way that you get beautiful</p>
<p>medieval cathedrals built in service of Catholicism.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s in the mind of an individual scientist?</p>
<p>So this process of ideology polluting science,</p>
<p>or is it science empowering ideology?</p>
<p>So almost like if we can zoom in and zoom out effortlessly</p>
<p>into the individual mind of a scientist,</p>
<p>then back to the whole scientific community.</p>
<p>Do scientists think about nuclear war,</p>
<p>about the atrocities committed by the Nazis</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re helping on the minute details</p>
<p>of the scientific process?</p>
<p>I think sometimes they do and sometimes they don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>You think of the chemists working to develop the cyanide</p>
<p>that will be used to kill Jews in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>What are they thinking?</p>
<p>You can imagine a whole range of thoughts,</p>
<p>maybe they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Maybe they do.</p>
<p>Maybe they know a little bit, but not a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t wanna know.</p>
<p>Maybe they have ways of lying to themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe they are the one person who agreed to do it</p>
<p>and 99 refused.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard, if not impossible,</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s in the soul of anyone.</p>
<p>But when you have enormous power directing the motion</p>
<p>and the currents or the ocean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hard to find people willing to fill that in,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re narrow technocrats,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re just doing their job,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re just building the widget.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of scientific training</p>
<p>is in widget building and that leads to the possibility</p>
<p>that they can become easily instrumentalized</p>
<p>in a particular action,</p>
<p>which is maybe horrific or glorious.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that science is,</p>
<p>as we say, what scientists do.</p>
<p>And that can include a lot of things,</p>
<p>it can exclude a lot of things.</p>
<p>The word science itself is interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s cognate.</p>
<p>It actually comes originally</p>
<p>from the Proto-Indo-European skein,</p>
<p>meaning to cut or divide.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s cognate with scissors, schism, skin.</p>
<p>Skin is that which divides you from the world.</p>
<p>Shit or scat is that which has been divided from you</p>
<p>into the world.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this cognate between science and shit</p>
<p>or science and cutting,</p>
<p>with the whole idea being that you&rsquo;re dividing into parts,</p>
<p>classifying, it&rsquo;s the taxonomic impulse.</p>
<p>And to know is to know where something belongs,</p>
<p>to divide it into its parts and put it in its proper place.</p>
<p>And that taxonomic impulse can be very static.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the things that Darwin had to overcome</p>
<p>in recognizing evolution, that the taxonomies are in motion.</p>
<p>But it also can lead to a kind of myopia</p>
<p>that my job is done when I&rsquo;ve classified something.</p>
<p>Is this bird an X, a Y, or a Z?</p>
<p>And that again can be, it can be ideological</p>
<p>or it cannot be, but scientists are humans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fitting in with a world, with a world practice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s limiting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of inevitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be, if not impossible, out of the world</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re walking in.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>because I think ideologies also have an impulse</p>
<p>towards forming taxonomies.</p>
<p>So just being at MIT, I&rsquo;ve gotten to learn</p>
<p>about this character named Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who this was</p>
<p>until all the news broke out and so on.</p>
<p>And I started to wonder how did all these people at MIT</p>
<p>that I admire would hang out with this person?</p>
<p>Just lightly, just have conversations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean any of the bigger things,</p>
<p>but even just basic conversations.</p>
<p>And I think this has to do,</p>
<p>you said scientists are widget builders and taxonomizers.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s power in somebody like the Nazi regime</p>
<p>or like a Jeffrey Epstein just being excited</p>
<p>about your widgets and making you feel</p>
<p>like the widget serves a greater purpose in the world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>sometimes people say scientists want to make money</p>
<p>or they have a big kind of ideological drive behind it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just nice when the widgets</p>
<p>you like building anyway,</p>
<p>somehow somebody convinces you, some charismatic person,</p>
<p>that this widget actually has a grander purpose.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t almost think about the negative</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>just the fact that it&rsquo;s grand is already super exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the story of Werner von Braun</p>
<p>and the fascination with rockets</p>
<p>and this will enlarge something in the world.</p>
<p>And here he is, he&rsquo;s an SS officer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s working around slave labor.</p>
<p>And then, but his rocket then gets compressed</p>
<p>into the Western world or the American world</p>
<p>and basically launches us to the moon</p>
<p>and we forget about how the sausage was made originally.</p>
<p>Well, can you talk about him a little bit more</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s such a fascinating character?</p>
<p>Because he, so he was a Nazi, but he was also an American</p>
<p>and it had such a grand impact on both.</p>
<p>And like there&rsquo;s this uncomfortable fact</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s one of the central figures</p>
<p>that gave birth to the American space exploration efforts.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s an interesting figure,</p>
<p>fascinated in a kind of a tunnel vision way with spaceflight.</p>
<p>He makes these beautiful rockets</p>
<p>already beginning in the 20s, early 30s.</p>
<p>Ends up for a while at Penamunda using slave labor</p>
<p>to build V2 engines and so forth like that.</p>
<p>I remember going to Penamunda</p>
<p>where people have actually tracked the flights</p>
<p>of aborted V2 rockets</p>
<p>and found some of these beautiful, beautiful old engines.</p>
<p>Just the most like works of art.</p>
<p>These engines used to rain terror on the British.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because in that same spot,</p>
<p>I was hunting for amber, Baltic amber</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a stone collector.</p>
<p>And among the amber collectors there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a famous story of the Penamunda burn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called because they find yellow phosphorous,</p>
<p>they think is amber, they put it in their pocket</p>
<p>and then it dries out and then explodes</p>
<p>and creates this big burn on their legs.</p>
<p>But the whole Nazi regime is full of things like that,</p>
<p>is full of these scholars who get twisted into a mindset.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also important to realize</p>
<p>that people didn&rsquo;t often see what was coming.</p>
<p>And we look back and we say, how could you X, Y, or Z?</p>
<p>But before the Holocaust, there&rsquo;s not the Holocaust.</p>
<p>There are versions of it, but things get on a new meaning,</p>
<p>gain a new meaning in light of subsequent events.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entire propaganda machine</p>
<p>that makes it easier for you</p>
<p>to hold the narrative in your head.</p>
<p>Even if you kind of intuitively know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really wrong here,</p>
<p>because of the propaganda you can kind of convince yourself</p>
<p>to be able to sleep at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, and we have to remember</p>
<p>that Goebbels&rsquo; office was not the office of propaganda.</p>
<p>It was the office of popular enlightenment and propaganda.</p>
<p>So enlightenment was part of his vision.</p>
<p>Just the new era of enlightenment from his perspective.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be the new age,</p>
<p>the new era of enlightenment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like the kind of myth</p>
<p>of Hitler&rsquo;s failed artist.</p>
<p>You know, his art is not that bad.</p>
<p>You know, there are a lot of artists who are worse.</p>
<p>And I had a very interesting conversation once</p>
<p>with my college roommate who became a librarian at Harvard.</p>
<p>And at Harvard, he met an old, old librarian,</p>
<p>a German woman who had met Hitler as a kid</p>
<p>when she was like eight years old.</p>
<p>Her dad was like a Gauleiter for the Nuremberg area.</p>
<p>And she said that for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>Hitler goes out onto the balcony with her</p>
<p>and has this conversation alone</p>
<p>with this eight-year-old girl.</p>
<p>And she said he was charming and funny.</p>
<p>And then he said he loved kids.</p>
<p>And she said he was the most charming sort of person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the history, too,</p>
<p>that we tend to forget when we make a scarecrow image</p>
<p>of this rabid, raging fanatic.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s more to it than that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really, really important to think about</p>
<p>when we make a scarecrow</p>
<p>because that gives you actionable,</p>
<p>like it forces you to introspect</p>
<p>about people in your own life or leaders in your life today,</p>
<p>ones you admire.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re charismatic, they&rsquo;re friendly, they love kids,</p>
<p>they talk about enlightenment.</p>
<p>You have to kind of think, all right,</p>
<p>am I being duped on certain things?</p>
<p>You have to kind of have a,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the problem with Jerry Epstein</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t seem to talk about.</p>
<p>I never met the guy,</p>
<p>but just given the people he talked to whom I know,</p>
<p>it feels like he must have been charismatic.</p>
<p>Like people think about like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s because of the women, it&rsquo;s because of the money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, the people I know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to be influenced.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it has to be how you are in the room</p>
<p>and make, it&rsquo;s exactly like you said, the enlightenment.</p>
<p>I think that excites the scientists.</p>
<p>Of course, as a charismatic person,</p>
<p>you have to know what to pick in terms of what excites you,</p>
<p>but that is also the fascinating thing to me about Hitler</p>
<p>is all of these meetings, even like with Chamberlain,</p>
<p>inside rooms, whether he was screaming</p>
<p>or whatever he was saying,</p>
<p>it seems like he was very convincing.</p>
<p>There must have been passion in his eyes.</p>
<p>There must have been charisma that one-on-one</p>
<p>in a quiet conversation, he was convincing.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a famous story about Goebbels</p>
<p>who would do a party trick where for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>for 15 minutes, he would rouse the crowd to communism,</p>
<p>workers of the world unite.</p>
<p>Then for 15 minutes, he would rouse the world to capitalism</p>
<p>and individualism, and then for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>he would rouse the world to Nazism,</p>
<p>and apparently, he was quite convincing</p>
<p>in each of those performances.</p>
<p>Well, all those ideologies are pretty powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, they, and I think it&rsquo;s not even the reason</p>
<p>that matters as much as the power of the dream,</p>
<p>of the vision, of the enlightenment.</p>
<p>I mean, the vision of communism is fascinatingly powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like workers unite, the common people stand together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll overthrow the powerful, the greedy,</p>
<p>and yet share the outcomes of our hard work.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s kind of like the story</p>
<p>of two-thirds of the things that Marx calls for</p>
<p>in the Communist Manifesto are already just part</p>
<p>of the liberal state, and so the parts we remember</p>
<p>or forget about an ideology are very revealing.</p>
<p>If we can just linger on this a little bit longer,</p>
<p>what have you learned from this period of the 1930s</p>
<p>about the scientific process?</p>
<p>So one of the labels you can put on your work,</p>
<p>and you as a scholar, as a philosopher of science,</p>
<p>and you also talk about Nazi Germany</p>
<p>as a singular moment in time, or like a rebirth</p>
<p>of the integration between ideology and science.</p>
<p>So like in terms of valueless science,</p>
<p>I think is the term.</p>
<p>Value-free science.</p>
<p>Value-free science that you use.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like Nazi Germany</p>
<p>is an important moment in history.</p>
<p>I mean, it probably goes up and down.</p>
<p>So what difficult truths have you learned</p>
<p>about the scientific process, and what hopeful things</p>
<p>have you learned about the scientific process?</p>
<p>Well, I guess the saddening thing</p>
<p>is how easily people can become part of a machine.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s power, people can be found to follow it.</p>
<p>One of the things I work on is big tobacco,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably come to that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing to me how easily people</p>
<p>are willing to work for big tobacco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me how many scientists and physicians</p>
<p>were willing to work for the Nazi regime</p>
<p>for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>Partly because a lot of them really thought</p>
<p>they were doing the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>They thought they were cleaning the world of filth.</p>
<p>I mean, if you really thought Jews are a parasitic race,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you get rid of them?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an ontology, there&rsquo;s a theory of the world</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re building on.</p>
<p>And interestingly, one that was also present</p>
<p>in the United States, and one of the things</p>
<p>I did find out in my earliest research</p>
<p>was that the Nazis had looked lovingly and enviously</p>
<p>over at the United States in terms of racial segregation,</p>
<p>racial separation, and saw themselves</p>
<p>in a kind of competition to become</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s racial leader as the most purified racial form.</p>
<p>And that this required this kind of cleansing process.</p>
<p>And the cleansing meant getting rid</p>
<p>of the physically handicapped.</p>
<p>It meant getting rid of racial inferiors,</p>
<p>as they imagined them.</p>
<p>It meant getting rid of cancer-causing chemicals</p>
<p>in the air, and in our food, and our water.</p>
<p>These were all of a piece.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous illustration that Richard Dahl</p>
<p>talks about, the great cancer theorist</p>
<p>of studying in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s shown a lecture where cancer cells</p>
<p>are shown as Jews, and x-rays are shown as stormtroopers,</p>
<p>and these stormtroopers are killing the cancer cells</p>
<p>who are also Jews.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s this metaphorical work</p>
<p>of cleaning, extermination, sanitation.</p>
<p>Purification of a sort.</p>
<p>Purification.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a kind of purity quest,</p>
<p>and you see that at multiple levels.</p>
<p>And so, you see how easy it is for people</p>
<p>to fall into that, given a particular theory.</p>
<p>And again, coming back to that earlier sort of point</p>
<p>about the scarecrow, which I think is very important,</p>
<p>if we imagine that nothing like this went on</p>
<p>here in the United States, that would be a big mistake.</p>
<p>The Nazis are looking to save the Redwoods League,</p>
<p>to the Aryan supremacists, to the Ku Klux Klan,</p>
<p>to the separation of blacks and whites.</p>
<p>Blacks were not allowed to join</p>
<p>the American Medical Association until after World War II.</p>
<p>So, you have racial segregation.</p>
<p>You have massive sterilization in the United States,</p>
<p>way before the Nazis.</p>
<p>One of the first things the Nazis do</p>
<p>from a racial hygiene point of view</p>
<p>is start sterilizing what they called the mentally ill</p>
<p>and the physically handicapped.</p>
<p>Well, that had been going on since around World War I</p>
<p>in the United States, and even earlier</p>
<p>in certain states in the form of castration of prisoners</p>
<p>in order to prevent their demon seed</p>
<p>from being propagated further into the race.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a kind of a racial international</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on, and that part of the story</p>
<p>also needs to be told.</p>
<p>And scientists were able to carry those ideas</p>
<p>in their mind from your work?</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the things going on</p>
<p>with all the renaming of buildings now,</p>
<p>is scientists who were eugenicists</p>
<p>are now getting their names pulled off of buildings.</p>
<p>My personal view is that it has to be done</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis, but in general,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s usually better to add on rather than subtract.</p>
<p>In other words, to add history rather than erase history</p>
<p>or pretend as if history had never existed.</p>
<p>Let me give you a specific example of that.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful and diabolical</p>
<p>university presidents in the Nazi period</p>
<p>was a guy named Karl Ostel, A-S-T-E-L,</p>
<p>and he was a rabid Nazi, high up in the leadership.</p>
<p>And in his portrait at the University of Vienna,</p>
<p>there he is in full SS uniform,</p>
<p>that painting was taken down.</p>
<p>Now, what I would have done is left the painting</p>
<p>and put a, you know, add a plaque.</p>
<p>But to pretend as if that never happened</p>
<p>or to erase history in that way,</p>
<p>I think is a big, big mistake.</p>
<p>Can I linger on that point?</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t gotten through it yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been trying to get to the Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>And, you know, throughout its history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been taken down and up.</p>
<p>It actually was taken down from Amazon for a while recently.</p>
<p>What can you say about keeping that stuff up?</p>
<p>So the reason it was taken down from Amazon,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that will read that and the hate in their heart will grow.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not using it for educational purposes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put a plaque on the Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ruining Mein Kampf then.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t, I mean, Amazon can&rsquo;t do a warning</p>
<p>saying like-</p>
<p>Or an expurgated version of Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>Take out the word Jew, you know?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That would solve everything.</p>
<p>So it still just stands on its own.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not well-written,</p>
<p>so you can maybe convince yourself that it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not well-written.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like this inspiring book of ideology</p>
<p>that could easily convince.</p>
<p>But can you still man the argument</p>
<p>that Mein Kampf should be banned?</p>
<p>And can you still man the argument</p>
<p>that it should be not banned?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it should be banned.</p>
<p>I think, if anything, that might make it forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>Now, this might be different when we come to statues</p>
<p>on the public square.</p>
<p>After World War II, the statues of Hitler,</p>
<p>there must have been thousands of them, were taken down.</p>
<p>Now, I think even the most rabid opponents</p>
<p>of cancel culture would not say there was something wrong</p>
<p>with taking down the statues of Hitler</p>
<p>that were in every office building, every post office.</p>
<p>So I think a lot depends on the placement</p>
<p>and the purpose of icons, of statues,</p>
<p>of texts, I don&rsquo;t see the harm</p>
<p>in being able to buy Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so out of this world by now.</p>
<p>Just the language and, if anything,</p>
<p>there probably is more good done</p>
<p>by people being shocked at how dumb it is</p>
<p>than the evil that might be done by someone reading it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine people being really gripped by that now,</p>
<p>partly just because it&rsquo;s kind of outdated and crazy talk.</p>
<p>So in that case, I would not be in favor of that.</p>
<p>When it comes to monuments or other types of things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a judgment call in each case.</p>
<p>I think it has to be probably voted on,</p>
<p>but it also, I think, in many of these cases,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an add-on view would fix a lot of the problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll jump around a little bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to medicine and war on cancer.</p>
<p>Let me just add one thing on that.</p>
<p>Recently, the name of MacMillan,</p>
<p>who works on the charge of the electron</p>
<p>in the early part of the 20th century,</p>
<p>his name was taken off of a building at Caltech.</p>
<p>Well, to take his name off, what do you really do?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a central aspect of his actual work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not why he was put on the name</p>
<p>of that building at Caltech.</p>
<p>And also, the memory is lost and the lesson is lost.</p>
<p>When you could have kept the MacMillan name</p>
<p>on the building and added a plaque,</p>
<p>this guy was a racist or this guy was a eugenicist</p>
<p>or something to make a teaching moment</p>
<p>instead of just a forgetting moment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me take a small tangent</p>
<p>and ask you about censorship</p>
<p>and this particular period we&rsquo;re living through.</p>
<p>So my friend Joe Rogan has a podcast.</p>
<p>He hosts a few folks on there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re folks of differing opinions.</p>
<p>And as we speak, there&rsquo;s kind of a battle going on</p>
<p>over whether Joe Rogan should be on Spotify</p>
<p>and allowed to spread scientific misinformation.</p>
<p>In particular, there&rsquo;s a guy named Robert Malone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking about, that&rsquo;s making a case against,</p>
<p>at least against the COVID vaccine and so on.</p>
<p>So outside of the specifics of this person,</p>
<p>in this battle of scientific ideas</p>
<p>that are sometimes tied up with ideology</p>
<p>in our modern world, what do you think is the role?</p>
<p>Like who gets to censor, decide what is misinformation</p>
<p>or information?</p>
<p>Should we let ideas fly in the scientific realm?</p>
<p>So scientific ideas,</p>
<p>or should we try to get it under control?</p>
<p>Like which way, obviously all approaches</p>
<p>will go wrong in some ways,</p>
<p>which is more likely to go wrong?</p>
<p>One where you try to get a hold of like,</p>
<p>all right, this is a viral thing</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t fit with scientific consensus.</p>
<p>So we should probably try to quiet it down a little bit,</p>
<p>or do you let it all just fly and let the ideas battle?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff</p>
<p>in the context of history?</p>
<p>Well, that used to be a million dollar question.</p>
<p>Of course, now it&rsquo;s a multi-billion dollar question.</p>
<p>Not trillion, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about powerful internet platforms</p>
<p>becoming essentially publishers.</p>
<p>And publishers can&rsquo;t say whatever they want.</p>
<p>There are limits.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t yell fire in a crowded theater.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a kind of social responsibility that is there.</p>
<p>And I know some of these,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a lot about this topic,</p>
<p>but I know some of the large platforms</p>
<p>do have dedicated offices</p>
<p>to trying to rein in misinformation</p>
<p>as you would expect any publisher to do.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just let anything fly in Time Magazine</p>
<p>or the New York Times either.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of codes of ethics and legal obligations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a fan of the efforts,</p>
<p>or I think some of the large internet platforms</p>
<p>should be congratulated at least for trying</p>
<p>to make an effort to rein in misinformation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be difficult,</p>
<p>and mistakes are gonna be made,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t be a let everything fly kind of situation.</p>
<p>But when I watch, unfortunately,</p>
<p>the pressure these platforms feel</p>
<p>to identify and to censor misinformation,</p>
<p>that pressure is ideological in nature currently.</p>
<p>So if you just objectively look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain political lean</p>
<p>to people that are pressing</p>
<p>on the censorship of the misinformation,</p>
<p>which makes me very uncomfortable</p>
<p>because now there&rsquo;s an ideology</p>
<p>to labeling something as misinformation</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of having a value,</p>
<p>less evaluation of what is true or not.</p>
<p>And you also have to acknowledge that it says something,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a very large number of people</p>
<p>that, for example, follow Robert Malone or follow people.</p>
<p>I mean, what does that say about society?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deeper lesson in there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just about blocking misinformation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distrust in science and institutions,</p>
<p>distrust in leaders.</p>
<p>It feels like you have to fix that.</p>
<p>And then censorship of misinformation</p>
<p>is not going to be fixing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only going to throw gasoline on the fire.</p>
<p>You gotta put out the fire.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s certainly possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think people are distrustful</p>
<p>of certain institutions and not others, right?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of distrust is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist,</p>
<p>but I do know there have been a lot of conspiracies</p>
<p>and that people work behind scenes</p>
<p>to do powerful bad things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what needs to be exposed.</p>
<p>The other thing I worry about,</p>
<p>which is relevant to your question,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s a billion or trillion dollar question,</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re, I think, in a world of kind of flattening</p>
<p>where all news or all information or all data</p>
<p>is kind of equal in some way.</p>
<p>And so you get the Twitterverse going</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s peer-reviewed</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s been supported by evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a kind of outburst.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to contrast it with, say, 100 years ago.</p>
<p>I mean, what would a crazy person</p>
<p>or a flat earther or anything,</p>
<p>what venue would they have?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe they could go to a church or someplace.</p>
<p>I mean, so now we have these empowering engines,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new historically</p>
<p>is that basically anyone can have a blog</p>
<p>or a Twitter feed and that is new.</p>
<p>And so that is, you can think of it also</p>
<p>as a kind of clutter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of a radical democracy in a way,</p>
<p>though kind of one of the weaknesses of democracy</p>
<p>is if everyone has an equal voice</p>
<p>and if everyone has equal power.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, of course, a flip side to that</p>
<p>where everyone has equal power.</p>
<p>It forces the people who are quote-unquote experts</p>
<p>to be better at communication.</p>
<p>I think people like scientists are just upset</p>
<p>that they have to do better work at communicating now.</p>
<p>They used to be lazy and you could just say,</p>
<p>I have a PhD, therefore everyone listen to me.</p>
<p>Now they have to actually convince people.</p>
<p>You have to convince people that the Earth is round.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say the Earth is round, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You have to show, you have to make,</p>
<p>I mean, not the Earth is round part,</p>
<p>but things like that.</p>
<p>You have to actually be a great communicator,</p>
<p>do great lectures, do documentaries and so on</p>
<p>to battle those ideas.</p>
<p>And then also to defend the sort of,</p>
<p>the people labeled as crazy.</p>
<p>In Nazi Germany, if you were protesting against</p>
<p>some of the uses of science, of medicine</p>
<p>to commit atrocities, you would also be labeled crazy.</p>
<p>And so those voices are important.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so many good points there</p>
<p>on the scientists becoming good communicators.</p>
<p>The history of scientists becoming bad communicators</p>
<p>has a history.</p>
<p>And the last original contribution to science</p>
<p>written entirely in the form of a poem</p>
<p>is Buffon&rsquo;s Loves of the Plants.</p>
<p>And following that in the 18th century,</p>
<p>you get the uglification of science,</p>
<p>the deliberate uglification of science</p>
<p>with the idea being that if you are clear</p>
<p>and if you speak beautifully, if you write beautifully,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hiding something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re covering over the truth with flowers</p>
<p>and decorations and scents and pleasant odors.</p>
<p>And so you get this scientific paper format,</p>
<p>introduction, discussion, methods, results, conclusions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of policed in this inhumane,</p>
<p>non-humanistic kind of rhetorical way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>And so you get that combined with just the rise</p>
<p>of the research lab and the ever narrower widget builders,</p>
<p>the cogs in the machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that people might not trust</p>
<p>certain aspects of that.</p>
<p>That combined with the dirty laundry history</p>
<p>of a lot of science that you did have,</p>
<p>the requirement at Auschwitz that people be,</p>
<p>that physicians supervise the killings,</p>
<p>the horrors of Tuskegee and all kinds of other things,</p>
<p>or even something like the atom bomb,</p>
<p>which is arguably more neutral at least,</p>
<p>but nonetheless horrific.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not surprising that a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t trust science and a lot of science</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s science and then there&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long history of dirty, bad science</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t solve just by saying</p>
<p>we should have trusted it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just stay on COVID for a brief moment</p>
<p>and talk about a particular leader</p>
<p>that I think about is Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about whether to talk to him or not.</p>
<p>I have my own feelings about Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>By the way, I admire basically everybody</p>
<p>and I admire scientists a lot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about him that bothers me.</p>
<p>I think because I&rsquo;m always bothered by ego</p>
<p>and lack of humility, and I sense that.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m very wrong on this,</p>
<p>but so he has said that he represents science.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve taken him full context,</p>
<p>I understand the point he&rsquo;s making,</p>
<p>which is when people attack,</p>
<p>attack him, they think of him as representing science,</p>
<p>things like that, but there&rsquo;s ego in that.</p>
<p>And what do you think motivates and informs his decisions?</p>
<p>Is it politics or science?</p>
<p>And the broader question I have,</p>
<p>what does it take to be a great scientific leader</p>
<p>in difficult times?</p>
<p>Like these, and maybe you could say</p>
<p>Nazi Germany was similar.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s obviously, like Anthony Fauci,</p>
<p>just like scientific leaders during Nazi Germany</p>
<p>could have made a difference, it feels like,</p>
<p>positive and negative.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lot at stake.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot at stake in terms of scientific leadership.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve asked about 17 questions,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something worthwhile answering in that.</p>
<p>Well, Fauci, I think, is doing as good a job as he can.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a, you can&rsquo;t turn on the television</p>
<p>without seeing him.</p>
<p>But no, that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the goal of the job?</p>
<p>That means he appears a lot, but there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>he does not come off as somebody with authenticity.</p>
<p>Like I admire so many science communicators,</p>
<p>about 10x, 100x more than him,</p>
<p>including his boss, Francis Collins,</p>
<p>who have I recently lost respect for,</p>
<p>given some of the emails that leaked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ego in those emails.</p>
<p>And it upsets me, because like,</p>
<p>I hope all that stuff comes out</p>
<p>and wakes young scientists up to don&rsquo;t be a douchebag.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t be humble.</p>
<p>Be honest, be authentic, be real, put yourself out there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t play the PR game, don&rsquo;t play politics.</p>
<p>Just get excited about the widget building that you love.</p>
<p>Communicate that and think about</p>
<p>the difficult ethical questions there</p>
<p>and communicate them, be transparent.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think like the public, don&rsquo;t talk down to the public.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think the public is too dumb to understand</p>
<p>the complexities involved.</p>
<p>Because the moment you start to think that,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like 30, what do you think happens</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re 40 and 50?</p>
<p>The slippery slope of that, the ego builds.</p>
<p>Like, this taste for the public opinion builds.</p>
<p>And then you get into the leadership position</p>
<p>at the time you&rsquo;re 60 and 70,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re just a dick.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a bad communicator to the very public.</p>
<p>So I think this is something that just builds over time,</p>
<p>is the skill to communicate, to be honest, to be real,</p>
<p>to constantly humble yourself,</p>
<p>to surround yourself with people that humble you.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m bothered by it</p>
<p>because I feel like science is under attack.</p>
<p>People distrust science more and more and more.</p>
<p>And it is perhaps unfair to put places</p>
<p>like Anthony Fauci to blame for that.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>Leaders take care of the responsibility.</p>
<p>So in you saying that he&rsquo;s doing the best job he can,</p>
<p>I would say he&rsquo;s doing a reasonable job,</p>
<p>but not the best job he can.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I don&rsquo;t know what his capabilities are</p>
<p>on that one or the other.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Like, you can imagine how history sees great leaders</p>
<p>that unite on which history turns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a great leader because there&rsquo;s a huge division.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in leadership position</p>
<p>that can heal the division.</p>
<p>You can think of tech leaders.</p>
<p>They can heal the division because of the platform.</p>
<p>They can speak out with eloquence.</p>
<p>You can think of political leaders, presidents,</p>
<p>that can speak out and heal the division.</p>
<p>You can think of scientific leaders like Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>They can heal division.</p>
<p>None of these are doing a good job right now.</p>
<p>And which is, you know, leadership is hard,</p>
<p>which is why when great leaders come along,</p>
<p>history remembers them.</p>
<p>So I just want to point out the emperor has no clothes</p>
<p>when the leaders are like, eh, kind of mediocre.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because it feels like, I guess,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it to a question about Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>What is the heroic action for a scientist in Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>Like, to stand, to see what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re under this cloud of ideology.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s an almost impossible task in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Maybe the heroic task would have been</p>
<p>before Hitler was essentially elected</p>
<p>and the Reichstag is burned.</p>
<p>So in the 30s, because it&rsquo;s building,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s building what the other alternatives are,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s events in World War I</p>
<p>that could have made Nazism less inevitable.</p>
<p>You know, maybe it&rsquo;s going back to the British Empire,</p>
<p>which had a giant empire</p>
<p>and Germany wanted a big empire too, right?</p>
<p>And that part of the history of World War I</p>
<p>is often forgotten.</p>
<p>So, you know, the heroic act is to stand up</p>
<p>and tell the truth and fight against evil.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Of course you get, oh, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but of course you get-</p>
<p>Well, just to have some courage, you know?</p>
<p>But I also, so I personally don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>have complete respect of people</p>
<p>who stand up and have courage,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not often effective.</p>
<p>What I have the most respect for is long-term courage,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>Because like, you know, if you&rsquo;re just an activist</p>
<p>and you speak out, this is wrong,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna be effective</p>
<p>because everybody around you is saying,</p>
<p>nah, it&rsquo;s like, we like our widgets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you have to somehow like steer this Titanic ship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I guess you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>the easiest way to steer is to do it earlier.</p>
<p>Well, everyone has different skills.</p>
<p>You know, Musk is building electric cars</p>
<p>and other people are trying to, you know,</p>
<p>build solar and wind.</p>
<p>And there are all kinds of problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna solve, right?</p>
<p>People are building better vaccines, you know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thousand ways to do good in the world</p>
<p>and a thousand ways to do bad in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, part of the problem in science</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t look enough</p>
<p>at what I call the causes of causes.</p>
<p>So cigarettes cause cancer, but what causes cigarettes?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the deeper, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So obesity causes heart disease, but what causes obesity?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just gluttony and sloth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the decision to pump up the sugar industry</p>
<p>and to allow soda in school.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a big fan of what I call loop closing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all worried about climate change</p>
<p>and reducing our carbon footprint,</p>
<p>but what about the hidden causes, the unprobed causes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a project now with Londa Schiebinger</p>
<p>on looking at how voluntary family planning</p>
<p>could actually have a big role</p>
<p>in reducing carbon footprint throughout the world.</p>
<p>And these literatures are never joined or rarely joined</p>
<p>that we have this huge carbon emissions problem,</p>
<p>but we also have too many people on the planet.</p>
<p>And the cause of that is because too few women and men</p>
<p>have access to birth control.</p>
<p>And if you join those realms open,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be new possibilities.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like looking at the flip side of fascism</p>
<p>and the kind of things, the discoveries they made</p>
<p>that have been ignored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>is finding some of the gaping holes,</p>
<p>the ideological gaps that have been ignored</p>
<p>because of ideology, left or right, by the way,</p>
<p>both of which involve blinders.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s all kinds of blinders that we live in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of ideology is what don&rsquo;t we even see?</p>
<p>And that would prevent us from seeing</p>
<p>some deep objective scientific truth.</p>
<p>Right, some truth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually, just to mention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people, including Elon,</p>
<p>who are saying there&rsquo;s not too many people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough people, right?</p>
<p>That if you just look at the birth rates.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like some of this is actually</p>
<p>very difficult to figure out</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s these narratives.</p>
<p>You mentioned tobacco, obesity with sugar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been narratives throughout the history.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, there&rsquo;s certain topics</p>
<p>on which it&rsquo;s easy to almost become apathetic</p>
<p>because you just see in history</p>
<p>how narratives take hold and fade away.</p>
<p>People were really sure that tobacco</p>
<p>is not at all a problem, and then it fades,</p>
<p>and then they figure it out,</p>
<p>and then other things come along.</p>
<p>What other things came along now?</p>
<p>Well, you asked about ideology,</p>
<p>and one of the things I always ask students before class,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m teaching agnotology</p>
<p>or world history of sciences,</p>
<p>what makes fish move?</p>
<p>And 90% of Americans will say</p>
<p>some version of muscles, fins, neurons,</p>
<p>when the reality is, at least in saltwater,</p>
<p>fish don&rsquo;t swim places, they&rsquo;re moved by currents.</p>
<p>Fish are moved by currents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes fish move.</p>
<p>This is not even counting the rotation of the earth</p>
<p>on its axis or the rotation of the earth around the sun</p>
<p>or the rotation of the solar system around the galaxy.</p>
<p>Ignore all that.</p>
<p>Even on earth, fish arrive up in Alaska.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t swim there, they come by currents.</p>
<p>And this is known to people</p>
<p>who understand the ecology of fish.</p>
<p>But we, as sort of individualistic Americans,</p>
<p>think that-</p>
<p>The fish pulled itself up by its bootstraps.</p>
<p>Pulled itself up by its bootstraps, right?</p>
<p>And whatever gumption and courage made his own world.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of something like cigarettes,</p>
<p>for example, hitting a village like an epidemic,</p>
<p>hitting the village like cholera or pneumonia</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big ideology we have of personal choice.</p>
<p>A great example of that is in the tobacco world</p>
<p>where people always, there&rsquo;s a whole field called cessation.</p>
<p>That always means cessation of consumption,</p>
<p>never cessation of production.</p>
<p>All blame is put on the individual smoker</p>
<p>instead of looking at how they get smoked.</p>
<p>And looking at that bigger picture,</p>
<p>I think, is part of the story.</p>
<p>So a few years ago you wrote that</p>
<p>the cigarette is the deadliest object</p>
<p>in the history of human civilization.</p>
<p>Cigarettes kill about six million people every year,</p>
<p>a number that will grow before it shrinks.</p>
<p>Smoking in the 20th century killed 100 million people.</p>
<p>And a billion could perish in our century</p>
<p>unless we reverse the course.</p>
<p>Can you explain this idea that it&rsquo;s the deadliest object</p>
<p>in the history of human civilization?</p>
<p>Maybe just also talk about big tobacco</p>
<p>and your efforts there.</p>
<p>Well, cigarettes have killed more than any other object,</p>
<p>than all the world of iron, all the world of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Nuclear bombs have only killed a few hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>Cigarettes have killed hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>And every year kill about as many as COVID.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of neck and neck.</p>
<p>But if you took the last five years, there&rsquo;s no contest.</p>
<p>Cigarettes have killed far more</p>
<p>and are far more preventable.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re in a world, this bizarro world,</p>
<p>where every night there&rsquo;s a COVID report</p>
<p>and cigarettes would never be mentioned.</p>
<p>Cigarettes would no more likely to be mentioned</p>
<p>than if we were talking about chewing gum on a sidewalk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be no more likely to be in a presidential debate</p>
<p>than, you know, sneezing in the wrong place.</p>
<p>So we live in this world where most things are invisible.</p>
<p>You know, we are, the eyes are in the front of the head.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s behind us.</p>
<p>We have a fovea, which means not only</p>
<p>do we only see what&rsquo;s in front of us,</p>
<p>we see in a very narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re predators.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the eternal watchfulness of prey.</p>
<p>We have a zeroed targeted focus.</p>
<p>And that leads to a kind of myopia or a tunnel vision</p>
<p>and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Then when you get something like</p>
<p>a very powerful tobacco industry,</p>
<p>which is a multi, multi-billion dollar industry,</p>
<p>which still spends many billions of dollars</p>
<p>advertising every year,</p>
<p>but nonetheless manages to make themselves invisible.</p>
<p>You have this powerful agent</p>
<p>that is producing this engine of death that is invisible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been reduced to the fish that move themselves.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s not really a tobacco industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just people who smoke,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a personal choice,</p>
<p>like what food we&rsquo;re gonna have for dinner tonight.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s erased from the policy world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And creating that sense of invisibility</p>
<p>to failure to understand the causes of causes</p>
<p>is what allows the epidemic to continue,</p>
<p>but also not even to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the invisibility created?</p>
<p>Is it natural?</p>
<p>Is it just human nature that ideas just fade</p>
<p>from our attention?</p>
<p>Or is it malevolent, still going on kind of</p>
<p>action by the tobacco companies to keep this invisible?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still going on.</p>
<p>Even when you see an ad against cigarettes on television,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dramatically curtailed</p>
<p>because the law that made those even possible</p>
<p>required that there&rsquo;s an anti-villainy clause.</p>
<p>The industry can&rsquo;t be made even visible in those ads.</p>
<p>In some, they get away with it,</p>
<p>but the industry operates through very powerful agents,</p>
<p>powerful senators.</p>
<p>They used to count 3 1‚ÅÑ4 of the members of Congress</p>
<p>as grade-A contacts.</p>
<p>They had most of the senators in their pocket,</p>
<p>a lot of the senators.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll play both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>Basically, tobacco is Democratic,</p>
<p>Democratic Party until basically the 70s</p>
<p>and Ronald Reagan,</p>
<p>then it shifts over to becoming Republican.</p>
<p>They create bodies like the Tea Party.</p>
<p>They merge with big oil, the Koch brothers,</p>
<p>in the 1980s and 90s to form the Tea Party</p>
<p>and a whole series of fronts</p>
<p>which fight against all regulation and all taxation</p>
<p>in order to prevent gas taxes and cigarette taxes</p>
<p>which are bonded in the convenience store and Walmart.</p>
<p>Most cigarettes are actually sold in places like Walmart</p>
<p>and pharmacies and 7-Elevens, things like that.</p>
<p>And through that locus,</p>
<p>then you have gasoline and tobacco</p>
<p>sort of in this micro-architectural collaboration.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s multiple, multiple means</p>
<p>that they use.</p>
<p>Plus, a lot of their targeting is hyper-specific.</p>
<p>They use the internet very effectively.</p>
<p>They use email that are customer targeting.</p>
<p>What goes to the mind of a big tobacco executive?</p>
<p>This is connecting to our previous conversations</p>
<p>of scientists and so on.</p>
<p>I always wonder about that.</p>
<p>I talked to Pfizer CEO, for example,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a deep question with the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>with, I guess, any CEO, but Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Would you, it&rsquo;s like, if you can come up with a cure</p>
<p>that gets rid of the problem that&rsquo;s in the Big Pharma,</p>
<p>would you want to?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of money</p>
<p>once the cure fixes the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to, like, there&rsquo;s so many incentives to make money.</p>
<p>Can you think clearly and make the right decisions?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe most people are good,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like this Steve Jobs idea,</p>
<p>just like, do the right thing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll make money in the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, long-term, you&rsquo;ll make a lot of money</p>
<p>if you do the right action,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always going to be problems you can fix.</p>
<p>You can always pivot the company to focus on other things,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re doing the best innovation,</p>
<p>the best science, the best development,</p>
<p>and the production and deployment and stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to win.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another view where you might,</p>
<p>that kind of idea of making money pollutes you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the widget building.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting when you can release a product</p>
<p>that makes a lot of money,</p>
<p>and you start enjoying the charts</p>
<p>that say the money&rsquo;s going up,</p>
<p>and you stop thinking about,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the wrong choice for human civilization.</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons I was made</p>
<p>a courtesy appointment in pulmonary medicine at Stanford</p>
<p>was they recognized I was doing more to save lives</p>
<p>by trying to stop big tobacco</p>
<p>than they were by yanking out this lung, that lung,</p>
<p>you know, on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Cause of causes.</p>
<p>The cause of causes, which we can keep returning to.</p>
<p>Your question about how do people live with themselves</p>
<p>is a crucial one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve thought about a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one you think about with, in any context of horror,</p>
<p>how do people live with themselves?</p>
<p>How do they get up in the morning?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of incentives.</p>
<p>One thing that you have to keep in mind</p>
<p>is that whoever becomes CEO of a big tobacco company,</p>
<p>they have already made decisions along the way,</p>
<p>and they are the remnant of a whole series</p>
<p>of aspiring people who wanna climb the ladder of success</p>
<p>who maybe would refuse.</p>
<p>You know, something like this.</p>
<p>But those don&rsquo;t survive the journey.</p>
<p>Those survive the journey who can make it through,</p>
<p>and I think they have a mixture of ideologies.</p>
<p>One, they&rsquo;ll say, well, if I didn&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>someone else would.</p>
<p>This is kind of the pour the cyclone B</p>
<p>down the chimney into Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Well, if I didn&rsquo;t do it, someone else would,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s really the difference</p>
<p>between me doing it and someone else?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one view.</p>
<p>Another one is the tobacco industry, I think,</p>
<p>really doesn&rsquo;t like their customers,</p>
<p>except for the fact that they like their money.</p>
<p>When you look at their documents,</p>
<p>they talk about targeting against young adults</p>
<p>or against women or against homosexuals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole project Reynolds has called Project Scum,</p>
<p>which is Project Subculture Urban Markets</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re targeting homeless</p>
<p>and homosexuals in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So what kind of business model</p>
<p>regards their customers as scum</p>
<p>or talks about them as one famous Reynolds executives,</p>
<p>you know, we don&rsquo;t smoke this stuff.</p>
<p>We reserve that for the poor, the black, and the stupid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a direct quote from one of the Winston models.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a company culture that sees the customers</p>
<p>almost like as the enemy or worthless.</p>
<p>Losers.</p>
<p>You know, so you have these executives,</p>
<p>you know, if we don&rsquo;t do it, someone else will.</p>
<p>If people are dumb enough to buy our product,</p>
<p>let them buy it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a personal choice.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re libertarians.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re just, as you said, seduced by the money,</p>
<p>and the money is enormous.</p>
<p>The money is enormous, and these tobacco executives</p>
<p>make tens of millions of dollars per year</p>
<p>just in their salaries.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a whole series of logics.</p>
<p>At some point, some of the companies</p>
<p>have become food producers.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 90s, Philip Morris,</p>
<p>which makes Marlboro,</p>
<p>was the largest food producer in the United States.</p>
<p>And so they could say, well, we&rsquo;re producing many products,</p>
<p>many addictive, desirable products.</p>
<p>I think one project I&rsquo;m working on now, actually,</p>
<p>is looking at how the industry maintains morale</p>
<p>in their own workforce.</p>
<p>And they create a kind of parallel world</p>
<p>of prizes and rewards and,</p>
<p>tobacco queens and tobacco princesses</p>
<p>and tobacco sports teams and tobacco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this whole separate world, a world within a world.</p>
<p>And we all live in bubbles of a sort.</p>
<p>And so there is this kind of tobacco world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re with us or you&rsquo;re against us.</p>
<p>And I even found evidence that the tobacco industry</p>
<p>lies to its own employees.</p>
<p>So they censored their own employee information</p>
<p>so that everyone would be on board that,</p>
<p>well, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t really cause cancer.</p>
<p>The evidence is all statistics.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t trust mice experiments because mice are not men.</p>
<p>They hire the guy, Daryl Huff,</p>
<p>who wrote How to Lie with Statistics,</p>
<p>the best-selling statistics book</p>
<p>in the history of the world.</p>
<p>They paid him to write a book called</p>
<p>How to Lie About Smoking with Statistics.</p>
<p>Now, that was never published</p>
<p>when sort of word of some other dirty tricks got out.</p>
<p>So one way they&rsquo;re able to gain legitimacy,</p>
<p>gain normalcy, these are supporters of the arts.</p>
<p>There are universities named for tobacco executives.</p>
<p>We have Duke University.</p>
<p>We have the George Weissman School, I think,</p>
<p>is of Arts and Sciences at CUNY.</p>
<p>And there are prizes.</p>
<p>Philip Morris essentially created women&rsquo;s tennis</p>
<p>as a spectator sport.</p>
<p>Billie Jean King joins the board of directors</p>
<p>of Philip Morris.</p>
<p>She signs coupons, the two-to-one coupons,</p>
<p>for buying Virginia Slim cigarettes.</p>
<p>So the industry is able to acquire this talent</p>
<p>and then through a kind of an application of causality</p>
<p>purely into the individual smoker.</p>
<p>If you smoke, you did it to yourself.</p>
<p>And so in a sense, we have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the same argument</p>
<p>Exxon is making now with carbon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, we just make the gas.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t burn the gas.</p>
<p>So really, we&rsquo;re not the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whoever drove here in a car that burned gas.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>Who is liable?</p>
<p>Who is responsible for, is the manufacturer just immune</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a legal product</p>
<p>and people make the foolish decision to smoke?</p>
<p>Or does the addiction play a role in the liability?</p>
<p>So these are all really interesting legal questions</p>
<p>and philosophical questions.</p>
<p>Where do you attribute the success in the fight</p>
<p>against big tobacco?</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s been a lot of progress made.</p>
<p>Maybe two questions.</p>
<p>One is that, and two, how much more is to be done?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s been, in my view, not that much progress.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry basically won the war</p>
<p>against cigarettes.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the broader assumption</p>
<p>inside and outside the industry would be,</p>
<p>was that if tobacco, if cigarettes are ever shown</p>
<p>as causing cancer, obviously, they&rsquo;ll be banned.</p>
<p>The famous slogan in the 50s was if spinach</p>
<p>were ever shown to cause one-tenth the harm of cigarettes,</p>
<p>it would be banned overnight.</p>
<p>Flash forward 50 years, we still have 300,</p>
<p>we still have 200-some billion cigarettes smoked</p>
<p>in the United States every year.</p>
<p>Globally, we still have about six trillion cigarettes</p>
<p>smoked every year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 350 million miles of cigarettes smoked every year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough to make a continuous chain of cigarettes</p>
<p>from the earth to the sun and back,</p>
<p>with enough left over for several round trips to Mars.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s much fewer than before.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, so culturally speaking,</p>
<p>I grew up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Everybody smoked, everybody smoked.</p>
<p>Well, by everybody, you mean about half.</p>
<p>Well, by everybody, I mean culturally.</p>
<p>So what does it feel like when everybody smokes, right?</p>
<p>What percentage is that?</p>
<p>Right now, in the United States,</p>
<p>it feels like nobody smokes.</p>
<p>Feel, I&rsquo;m talking about culturally.</p>
<p>Do you see famous actors and actresses?</p>
<p>Do you see movies?</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t watch a Hollywood movie</p>
<p>without seeing pretty much continuous smoking.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Peaky Blinders.</p>
<p>Look at any of the modern series.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s pretty much a nonstop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, there has been a change.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The purest metric in the United States</p>
<p>is number of cigarettes smoked per year.</p>
<p>And that peaks in 1981 at 640 billion cigarettes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s declined now to the level it was in 1940,</p>
<p>which is about 240 billion cigarettes.</p>
<p>Now, globally, the number has increased.</p>
<p>But the perception, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Even in the United States, the numbers,</p>
<p>the decrease is not as significant as I thought it is</p>
<p>because just in my own experience with people,</p>
<p>people speak negatively about smoking.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, for one thing, smokers do.</p>
<p>I mean, smokers hate the fact they smoke.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So this is the interesting observation I&rsquo;m speaking to</p>
<p>is even the smokers are talking negatively about smoking,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still smoking.</p>
<p>So even though I&rsquo;m seeing this shift</p>
<p>where smoking is no longer the cool thing,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like when I was growing up</p>
<p>and I smoked for a time,</p>
<p>it was like a way to bond with strangers,</p>
<p>to talk bullshit with friends.</p>
<p>Share a moment.</p>
<p>Share a moment together.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because we need to find other ways to share moments.</p>
<p>But you know, you almost smoke from a stranger.</p>
<p>I mean, that was seen as a good thing.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>Did you ever smoke?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>For how many years?</p>
<p>Two years.</p>
<p>So what happened is I was a musician, I was in a band.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>And no, there is a bonding aspect to it,</p>
<p>and I think I stopped smoking</p>
<p>when they banned smoking inside bars.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Which was, I mean, that was,</p>
<p>I mean, looking back now,</p>
<p>it seems it&rsquo;s such a powerful move.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you can speak to that</p>
<p>because that-</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>That was one of the moments that woke me up.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Like that was a big shift for me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not just like,</p>
<p>it forced me to rethink the effect that smoking has on me,</p>
<p>and also to think,</p>
<p>can I actually live a life without smoking?</p>
<p>Can I, you know, some people have that,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t gone through that process yet,</p>
<p>but some people have that with drinking.</p>
<p>Can I have fun without drinking?</p>
<p>I think the answer to that is yes, but I&rsquo;m still drinking.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big shift.</p>
<p>For example, if they ban drinking at certain places,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of negative things</p>
<p>to say about alcohol.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m older than you,</p>
<p>and I remember when mother,</p>
<p>and I think you weren&rsquo;t even in this country then,</p>
<p>but there was something called</p>
<p>Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</p>
<p>And if you look at movies from the 50s, 60s, even 70s,</p>
<p>being drunk was just kind of a funny thing.</p>
<p>And you would drive drunk,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big deal, really?</p>
<p>And Mothers Against Drunk Driving</p>
<p>really denormalized drinking and driving,</p>
<p>much like seatbelts.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, you know, there were no seatbelts.</p>
<p>You just lie in the back of the car,</p>
<p>and you drove out west with your parents,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d lie flat, and it was wonderful.</p>
<p>Seatbelts come along,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s pretty normalized that you buckle up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty normalized that you don&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>And so the moment you identify</p>
<p>is absolutely crucially important.</p>
<p>A lot of it started in California,</p>
<p>where there were bans on cigarettes.</p>
<p>Some of it actually started in the computer industry,</p>
<p>because some of the early bugs</p>
<p>that were found on tapes in the 70s were caused by smoke.</p>
<p>And some of the earliest indoor smoking bans</p>
<p>were actually in computer rooms,</p>
<p>which were supposed to be clean enough</p>
<p>that the tapes wouldn&rsquo;t spin</p>
<p>and get caught by some snag of soot.</p>
<p>And the workers started saying,</p>
<p>wait a minute, if the smoke can hurt the tapes,</p>
<p>can it hurt my lungs as well?</p>
<p>And so some of these early laws,</p>
<p>already in the late 70s, early 80s,</p>
<p>pushing it out was a huge struggle.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry marshaled an army of experts</p>
<p>to say that secondhand smoke</p>
<p>is an entirely different kind of smoke.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p>They eventually lost that battle.</p>
<p>And now we have so-called smoke-free laws,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t smoke in most workplaces,</p>
<p>in most restaurants.</p>
<p>And that denormalization has been crucial,</p>
<p>because remember Aristotle says,</p>
<p>tell me who you walk with, and I&rsquo;ll tell you who you are.</p>
<p>And if your friends are smoking,</p>
<p>if your friends are doing whatever, it makes it easier.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry has been a genius</p>
<p>at manipulating and really creating</p>
<p>the material culture of the modern world.</p>
<p>If your shirt has a pocket, that&rsquo;s to fit cigarettes, right?</p>
<p>If your car has a plug-in,</p>
<p>every car that I used to have had a cigarette lighter.</p>
<p>It had an ashtray.</p>
<p>Every plane that I flew when I was a kid,</p>
<p>when I was younger anyway,</p>
<p>there was smoking on it originally.</p>
<p>And then there were ashtrays.</p>
<p>And even today, every plane by law</p>
<p>has to have ashtrays in the bathrooms,</p>
<p>because people still smoke in the planes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a special technique they have</p>
<p>where they go in and light up your cigarette</p>
<p>and put your mouth right down in the middle of the toilet</p>
<p>and then flush it right at that same moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a good big puff.</p>
<p>Take a good big puff and flush it.</p>
<p>And to prevent people from bringing down the plane</p>
<p>by putting the cigarette out in the trash,</p>
<p>every plane must have ashtrays.</p>
<p>So that tells you something about the power of addiction,</p>
<p>the power of normalcy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s related to your question of this crucial moment.</p>
<p>If you can no longer smoke in a bar,</p>
<p>if you can no longer smoke.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s different from drinking.</p>
<p>Most people who smoke wish they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most people who drink, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Most people who drink, they don&rsquo;t wish.</p>
<p>There are some addicts, you know, 5%, we say.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about 70, 80, 90% of people</p>
<p>who smoke cigarettes regularly wish they did not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually where I learned about</p>
<p>the idea that we could get rid of cigarettes entirely</p>
<p>was just from talking to ordinary smokers.</p>
<p>Those are the people who are willing to say,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s get cigarettes all together</p>
<p>and get rid of them all together</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a recreational drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different from alcohol.</p>
<p>And the genius of the tobacco industry</p>
<p>is to turn basic, to trivialize addiction</p>
<p>into just something we all like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s addictive, I like it.</p>
<p>And also to say that basically smoking is like drinking,</p>
<p>which in fact it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Alcohol tends to be a recreational drug</p>
<p>and cigarettes are more like heroin.</p>
<p>So how do we get that 200 billion down closer to zero?</p>
<p>Well, the good news, and I know you like good news,</p>
<p>and I do too, is that every year</p>
<p>we have about 8 billion fewer cigarettes smoked</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going in the right direction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to solve this.</p>
<p>Not every problem you can solve in the world.</p>
<p>This is a very solvable problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enormous problem.</p>
<p>Arguably as big as COVID in certain respects.</p>
<p>Much more invisible than COVID,</p>
<p>but very solvable and actually will be solved</p>
<p>probably because of climate change</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to need to find ways</p>
<p>to reduce carbon footprints across the board.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be a kind of cultural revolution</p>
<p>of sorts once we have a category six hurricane</p>
<p>and hundreds of thousands of people start dying</p>
<p>from the storms that are coming.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll be, it&rsquo;s like that metaphor</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s a sci-fi film from 1950</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to get back to earth from the moon</p>
<p>and they have to jettison their toolbox</p>
<p>and their ladder and this and this and this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of, I think, the world we&rsquo;re going to be in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to jettison a lot of things</p>
<p>and cigarettes will be one of the things we can get rid of.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come back to Nazi Germany for a time.</p>
<p>You also wrote the book titled The Nazi War on Cancer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What is the main storyline and thesis of this book?</p>
<p>Well, I had been researching Nazi medicine.</p>
<p>I went over to Germany.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I got a Fulbright.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to go to Russia.</p>
<p>Went to Germany partly because my girlfriend</p>
<p>was going there, Londa Schiebinger.</p>
<p>And I was quick with the language.</p>
<p>And my old landlady was born in 1900</p>
<p>and I was renting a room, a tiny room in Berlin.</p>
<p>And she told me, she&rsquo;d been a nurse in World War I</p>
<p>and told me how sad it was that all the mentally ill</p>
<p>had died in that war and that how the same thing</p>
<p>happened in World War II.</p>
<p>And she told me about how sad it was</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d never gotten married</p>
<p>because there were no German men around after World War I.</p>
<p>But I also started taking classes in Germany.</p>
<p>And at that time there were still</p>
<p>a few old Nazi professors, just about to retire.</p>
<p>You know, very, very old.</p>
<p>And I remember there was one guy who would talk about</p>
<p>the impact on ovaries of women exposed to stress</p>
<p>and how this would damage their ovaries</p>
<p>and that this was like people who had been told</p>
<p>they were about to be executed.</p>
<p>And they would do a before and an after on these ovaries.</p>
<p>One of these horrific experiments.</p>
<p>This was a physician in Berlin.</p>
<p>And so I got involved in it with a group of people</p>
<p>and really as a kind of intellectual garlic</p>
<p>for living in Berlin, and this is in 1980, 81,</p>
<p>I started reading medical journals from the Nazi period.</p>
<p>And even the librarians didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I remember the Preussische Staatsbibliothek</p>
<p>in downtown Berlin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, why do you wanna, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to be reading these old Nazi journals.</p>
<p>These are just medical journals,</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of journals.</p>
<p>And I just read them and read them and read them</p>
<p>and looking for details.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find like a veterinary medicine journal</p>
<p>that would have a joking section where they&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>oh, we found a cow with a swastika on his forehead,</p>
<p>a natural black swastika.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that funny, you know?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;d find stories about tobacco.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find stories about abortion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find stories about excluding Jewish medicine</p>
<p>or Jews from medicine or who&rsquo;s been promoted,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been demoted, who&rsquo;s been Nazified.</p>
<p>I discovered there was an entire Nazi Physicians League</p>
<p>that was just the top Nazi,</p>
<p>the most Nazi of the physicians.</p>
<p>I discovered that physicians joined the Nazi party</p>
<p>in a higher proportion than any other profession,</p>
<p>that they joined the SS in a higher proportion</p>
<p>than any other profession.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense?</p>
<p>Because the Nazi regime is a kind of sanitary utopia.</p>
<p>It was to create this purified world</p>
<p>that would control the mind and fertility.</p>
<p>So gynecologists and psychiatrists were the top.</p>
<p>They were the most Nazified</p>
<p>of the various medical professions.</p>
<p>Control the body through sterilization, abortion,</p>
<p>control the mind through psychiatry.</p>
<p>They killed a lot of the mentally ill.</p>
<p>And you can read their professional journals.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure these had ever been read since.</p>
<p>I also went to East Germany,</p>
<p>because remember, this is way before the wall fell.</p>
<p>And they had a very special collection of taboo literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of your point about, should Mein Kampf be read?</p>
<p>Well, of course, East Germany, nowhere close, right?</p>
<p>And so, but not only that,</p>
<p>Time Magazine couldn&rsquo;t be read and Newsweek couldn&rsquo;t be read.</p>
<p>And this file, this chamber</p>
<p>that the foreign scholars were allowed to look through</p>
<p>had all of the old Nazi literature</p>
<p>and Nazi scientific literature,</p>
<p>and Time Magazine and Newsweek</p>
<p>and a whole pornography section as well.</p>
<p>So all of the taboo topics.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m researching, in the West,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m researching these topics</p>
<p>the librarians didn&rsquo;t even want me to look at.</p>
<p>In the East, I was sort of going over there.</p>
<p>I would hitchhike over there and overstay my welcome.</p>
<p>Things like that.</p>
<p>But in any event, I noticed that there was this kind of taboo</p>
<p>of talking about the big eugenics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already been, as a kind of a radical graduate student</p>
<p>at Harvard working with all the Marxist biologists there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d already had a critique of eugenics</p>
<p>and women being excluded from science</p>
<p>and South African apartheid was a big deal</p>
<p>and Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s blacks have lower IQs.</p>
<p>And so there was a whole nest of controversial hot topics</p>
<p>around sociobiology, around race and IQ,</p>
<p>around women and scholarship and so forth.</p>
<p>But we weren&rsquo;t looking at Nazi medicine.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;ll look at the big eugenics,</p>
<p>not just this smaller stuff.</p>
<p>Only 50,000 people are sterilized</p>
<p>in California but there were huge numbers</p>
<p>sterilized in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>So the more I looked into that,</p>
<p>I realized there was a book there</p>
<p>but I had also started noticing this other weird stuff.</p>
<p>Why were they anti-tobacco?</p>
<p>Why did they recognize, why were the Nazis</p>
<p>the first to recognize asbestos as causing mesothelioma?</p>
<p>Why did they try to ban food dyes?</p>
<p>Why are they the first culture in the world</p>
<p>to encourage women to do breast self-exams?</p>
<p>I told my mom this and she told me that in the 50s,</p>
<p>women weren&rsquo;t even supposed to touch their breasts in Texas.</p>
<p>And here in Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got these mandatory breast self-exams</p>
<p>way before this was done in the United States.</p>
<p>You had the first laws banning the X-raying</p>
<p>of pregnant women.</p>
<p>Already in the early 1930s,</p>
<p>it was standard medical practice.</p>
<p>They recognized that this could harm the fetus,</p>
<p>harm the race, way before radiation was recognized</p>
<p>as a hazard in England or America.</p>
<p>I had started noticing these things</p>
<p>and I have an eye for oddities.</p>
<p>I like the weird, the contradictory,</p>
<p>that which doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>And I remember finding a German magazine,</p>
<p>a newspaper actually from 1919</p>
<p>that talked about a holocaust of six million Jews</p>
<p>using that language.</p>
<p>How could this be?</p>
<p>And I researched it.</p>
<p>I thought it wasn&rsquo;t even real</p>
<p>and so I went and actually got the original newspaper</p>
<p>and there it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those oddities of life that just happens.</p>
<p>Just weird stuff happens, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the source of conspiracy theories, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So weird stuff happens,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an inkling that that couldn&rsquo;t have been written</p>
<p>in another time in history,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s much less likely that little coincidence</p>
<p>to have happened in another.</p>
<p>So it has some kind of resonance with something</p>
<p>that captures something deep to the culture.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m interested in probing.</p>
<p>I mean, history is about seeing the universal</p>
<p>through the particular in a way.</p>
<p>So you look for the weird particular</p>
<p>and then pull at that string</p>
<p>to see if there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>Is it that weird?</p>
<p>I did a project I never published</p>
<p>on what I call pseudo-swastikas,</p>
<p>which is a lot of companies in Nazi Germany</p>
<p>made logos that look pretty much like a swastika.</p>
<p>You start looking at them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re disturbingly like a swastika</p>
<p>and I call those pseudo-swastikas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the many things I&rsquo;ve filed away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a great project just to write it.</p>
<p>How did this kind of visual iconography&hellip;</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t supposed to do that.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t supposed to sell your bathroom cream</p>
<p>with a swastika on it.</p>
<p>So they would do these little things</p>
<p>that look pretty much like a swastika.</p>
<p>Or I would look at humor.</p>
<p>What are they laughing at?</p>
<p>What are they smiling at?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know Germans had humor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good discovery.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, even Hitler had a sense of humor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one speech he gives, which is actually pretty funny,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s ridiculing all the 29 tiny political parties.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s this party.</p>
<p>And that party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of funny.</p>
<p>So we do have this, again, this scarecrow image</p>
<p>even of Hitler and his personality and this and that.</p>
<p>But I started noticing that there was this stuff</p>
<p>that looks kind of modern.</p>
<p>Hitler being a vegetarian and trying to limit alcohol</p>
<p>and this and that.</p>
<p>And then I got a call, but I&rsquo;d sort of filed it away,</p>
<p>and then I got a call from the Holocaust Museum.</p>
<p>Would I like to be the first senior scholar in residence</p>
<p>at the Holocaust Museum?</p>
<p>I said, well, I wasn&rsquo;t really working on Nazi stuff</p>
<p>that much anymore, but I did have this idea</p>
<p>maybe looking at how it could be that the Nazis</p>
<p>had the world&rsquo;s most aggressive anti-cancer campaign,</p>
<p>which is kind of like an amazing fact.</p>
<p>And I said, it&rsquo;s not exactly about the Holocaust.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s about the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what was Nazism that it was so seductive</p>
<p>that it could become so powerful</p>
<p>that something like the Holocaust could be possible.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, that sounds great.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want.</p>
<p>And so I went down to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>and helped them build a little bit</p>
<p>some of the racial hygiene exhibits,</p>
<p>some of the push and to show the sort of</p>
<p>the medical aspect of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>And so I ended up writing this book</p>
<p>on the Nazi war on cancer, which talks about</p>
<p>how right before Hitler&rsquo;s about to invade Poland,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking late into the night about how to cure cancer.</p>
<p>So for Nazis, racial hygiene encompasses</p>
<p>like way more than we might think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like purifying in all ways.</p>
<p>And one of the-</p>
<p>Purifying, and it&rsquo;s also much more normal</p>
<p>and more familiar.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like regular, in regular discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the famous line that if Nazism</p>
<p>ever comes to Britain, it&rsquo;ll be wearing a bowler hat.</p>
<p>And we create an image of Nazism,</p>
<p>which is this fantasy image.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re human beings making these decisions.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s tied to things like removing cancer,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying they kind of,</p>
<p>the effort of purification walks alongside</p>
<p>with this effort of fighting cancer.</p>
<p>And then the final, the difficult truth here</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation,</p>
<p>leading scientific innovation on fighting cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bunch of blind robots following orders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a period of massive innovation.</p>
<p>I mean, they declared the soybeans</p>
<p>to be the official bean of the Third Reich</p>
<p>because they realized how useful soy could be</p>
<p>in protein for the people.</p>
<p>They built a whole car out of soybeans.</p>
<p>They pushed for a whole grain bread,</p>
<p>calling white bread a French revolutionary</p>
<p>capitalist product.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right about whole grain bread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than, you know, so-</p>
<p>Allegedly, so far.</p>
<p>So far, that&rsquo;s what we think.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discover eventually that bread</p>
<p>is the thing that&rsquo;s killing us.</p>
<p>Well, by the way, I&rsquo;m eating mostly meat,</p>
<p>so mostly carnivore, and that&rsquo;s been a discovery for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what, like, I&rsquo;m not making</p>
<p>a general statement about the population,</p>
<p>but me personally, how I feel.</p>
<p>I like, I&rsquo;ve discovered fasting,</p>
<p>so I often, like on days like this,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s pretty stressful, I&rsquo;ll eat once a day</p>
<p>and only meat, or mostly meat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s amazing to me</p>
<p>from a scientific discovery perspective</p>
<p>that that makes me feel way better.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no scientific support</p>
<p>why it might make you feel, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The point is, I&rsquo;ve done the experiments</p>
<p>on the N of one, and it just makes me feel better.</p>
<p>Well, I think fasting is way undervalued.</p>
<p>I mean, where do we get the idea</p>
<p>you need three meals a day?</p>
<p>I have a friend at Harvard, and he&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>seven or eight days periodically without food.</p>
<p>He drinks water, but he considers it</p>
<p>a kind of purification, and you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a world where it&rsquo;s too easy to get food, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a world, I mean, most animals</p>
<p>are living in a sense on the brink of starvation,</p>
<p>but we have technologies and social conditions</p>
<p>that allow, it&rsquo;s way too easy to find</p>
<p>a piece of cake or a donut,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not something we evolved with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about purification</p>
<p>in a negative context, but you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s appealing ways of minimalism,</p>
<p>of removing things from your life,</p>
<p>of seeking, especially for me being like OCD</p>
<p>and a scientist, I do like this simplification</p>
<p>of things, of this taxonomy of things.</p>
<p>I just recently, storage got hacked</p>
<p>by ransomware for these storage devices</p>
<p>called QNAP NAS, and you know,</p>
<p>50 terabytes of data locked up,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s lost, but you know,</p>
<p>it was, at first it was a gut punch,</p>
<p>and it really hurts, and a bunch of stuff is gone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also freeing, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a, my favorite New Yorker cartoon</p>
<p>is where the guy&rsquo;s about to die.</p>
<p>As I say, he&rsquo;s 90 years old, he&rsquo;s got tubes in his nose.</p>
<p>His very last words are, I wish I&rsquo;d bought more crap.</p>
<p>Yep, and that&rsquo;s now, in this amazing world,</p>
<p>applies to digital world, too.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t need to store everything,</p>
<p>you just live in the moment and live for the people</p>
<p>that you love.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one of my fears of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>is losing your password.</p>
<p>I know a friend, his son, you know,</p>
<p>mined I don&rsquo;t know how many dozens of Bitcoins</p>
<p>and lost his password, you know,</p>
<p>and so what can he do?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole, I think, Silicon Valley episode</p>
<p>about something like that, where the three-comma club,</p>
<p>you know, asshole billionaire is trying to find</p>
<p>his old laptop with the password on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the kind of dread people feel</p>
<p>in the modern age, losing your Bitcoin password.</p>
<p>Or for me, it&rsquo;d be like last-pass password.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious, we&rsquo;re funny, funny creatures.</p>
<p>What else can we say outside of cancer</p>
<p>about medicine, about engineering?</p>
<p>Lessons about medicine, lessons about engineering,</p>
<p>and lessons about sort of applied science in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>So before we leave the subject,</p>
<p>is there some truths that resonate with you still</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s applicable for today?</p>
<p>Well, you know, historians celebrate contingency,</p>
<p>or at least recognize contingency,</p>
<p>and we always say things didn&rsquo;t have to turn out</p>
<p>the way they did.</p>
<p>There were, you can&rsquo;t always, you know,</p>
<p>foresee what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And there were definitely missteps,</p>
<p>and the potency of that ideology</p>
<p>was such that it trapped a lot of people,</p>
<p>and I guess by the time it becomes</p>
<p>essentially a wartime operation,</p>
<p>that becomes very, very dangerous,</p>
<p>whatever the ideology is.</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s blended with warfare, that&rsquo;s catastrophic.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s ignored,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in things that are ignored,</p>
<p>and one of the things that we ignore now</p>
<p>on something even like the climate catastrophe</p>
<p>is the role of the military.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of carbon emissions</p>
<p>from military operations.</p>
<p>Again, just part of the loop we&rsquo;re not closing.</p>
<p>Well, military is really interesting</p>
<p>because, you know, I&rsquo;m a AI person, robots,</p>
<p>and most of my work when I was a PhD student</p>
<p>was DARPA and DoD funded.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably true for a lot of science</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funded, especially engineering</p>
<p>is funded by the military.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I really want to be careful drawing parallels</p>
<p>between Nazi Germany and anything else.</p>
<p>But, you know, there is a sense in which,</p>
<p>I remember when I was a,</p>
<p>it hit me when one of the people close to me</p>
<p>when I was a PhD, one of the faculty,</p>
<p>she refused to take funding from DoD, from DARPA.</p>
<p>That was interesting to me.</p>
<p>I thought, but what&rsquo;s the, I mean, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re not taking a stand against the war.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t want to take money</p>
<p>from tangentially associated military kind of efforts.</p>
<p>And that little stand, I mean, that had an impact on me.</p>
<p>At least it woke me up to,</p>
<p>like, this is something we should be</p>
<p>very, very careful with.</p>
<p>For me, artificial intelligence is,</p>
<p>you know, much of the DARPA research</p>
<p>on autonomous vehicles and all kinds of robotics, drones,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s pure research.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest discoveries,</p>
<p>like, I didn&rsquo;t think of it as military.</p>
<p>I thought of it as engineering and science.</p>
<p>But then, when the drums of war start beating,</p>
<p>like, say, in some future time,</p>
<p>all of that machine is already there to turn it into,</p>
<p>now, Lex is walking around and working on autonomous drones</p>
<p>that are going to, you know, swarm China,</p>
<p>or swarms whoever, some terrorist part of the world.</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>all my widgets are being used for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been waking up more and more to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been something released called, like,</p>
<p>the AI Report, Eric Schmidt was one of the co-authors of it,</p>
<p>which is essentially saying that,</p>
<p>because China&rsquo;s developing autonomous weapon systems,</p>
<p>the US should not ban autonomous weapon systems,</p>
<p>it should also be doing it.</p>
<p>So, basically, put AI into our weapons of war.</p>
<p>And that escalation, that race, is terrifying,</p>
<p>just like all the things you mentioned.</p>
<p>But that particular one, for me, is close,</p>
<p>because now, too closely are the ideas of AI and war</p>
<p>are being linked.</p>
<p>Very much, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things I think that is rarely taught</p>
<p>in universities is, what would you not do for money?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, in a basic class on machine learning,</p>
<p>or even statistics, or history,</p>
<p>what would you not do for money?</p>
<p>What should you not do for money?</p>
<p>I have a lot of my own colleagues who work for big tobacco,</p>
<p>you know, carrying water for them in court.</p>
<p>A huge, essentially a mercenary army of historians,</p>
<p>a vast, undiagnosed, you know,</p>
<p>essentially a hidden, invisible army.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t put it on their CVs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going on the same thing</p>
<p>with a lot of the technical fields.</p>
<p>What wouldn&rsquo;t you do for money?</p>
<p>At Stanford, there used to be secret PhDs,</p>
<p>secret research projects.</p>
<p>That was kicked off campus in 1971</p>
<p>with the whole 60s radicalism.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, individual professors still work</p>
<p>for all kinds of military operations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re setting up a new school of sustainability at Stanford,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be pretty much in bed with big oil as well.</p>
<p>Big oil is gonna be funding a lot of that.</p>
<p>You know, what kind of influence?</p>
<p>If they have a seat at the table,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re giving money, if their gifts,</p>
<p>if their names are on certain projects,</p>
<p>what influence is that gonna have?</p>
<p>This is what really bothered me.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t often have, they don&rsquo;t have integrity</p>
<p>in the way that I hoped they would.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I learned in academia.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people, for money, you know,</p>
<p>if I give you a million dollars to murder somebody,</p>
<p>I think most people would not.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>A billion dollars, that number starts decreasing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still pretty, I think we would be happy</p>
<p>with direct murder not being done for money.</p>
<p>But like subtle stuff, just pressures.</p>
<p>And it could be with like, let me buy you a drink,</p>
<p>and just, you know, laugh about stuff, become friends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a subtle pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very upset with how many people would just unknowingly</p>
<p>like tell themselves a story, ah, what&rsquo;s the harm?</p>
<p>And I see that with, for example, me personally at MIT,</p>
<p>a lot of people I admire, a lot of people I still admire,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m friends of mine.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, in doing autonomous vehicle research,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s car companies that fund that research.</p>
<p>And the car companies say, no, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to influence anything.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s like, you do, it&rsquo;s wide open.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want.</p>
<p>But the fact is, you know, they give millions of dollars.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m disappointed that actually a lot of scientists</p>
<p>in that context are still afraid,</p>
<p>even though legally it says they cannot,</p>
<p>the car company cannot at all influence your research.</p>
<p>They still start leaning slowly towards the ideas</p>
<p>that that company espouses.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a harmless, perhaps, topic versus big tobacco.</p>
<p>But I would argue it has harm on innovation.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it skews innovation.</p>
<p>What happened at Stanford was</p>
<p>Philip Morris and the other big tobacco companies,</p>
<p>they had a massive denial campaign to deny</p>
<p>that exposure to someone else&rsquo;s smoke could kill you.</p>
<p>When in fact it can.</p>
<p>It kills tens of thousands of Americans every year still.</p>
<p>They set up an entire conspiracy body</p>
<p>called the Center for Indoor Air Research</p>
<p>and funded hundreds of scientists to basically say,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s all genetic.</p>
<p>If you get cancer, well, you had it coming</p>
<p>because of your genes, your ancestry,</p>
<p>your hormones, whatever.</p>
<p>Well, that was broken apart through what was called</p>
<p>the Master Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p>But it was rejuvenated and reinvigorated</p>
<p>by something called the Philip Morris</p>
<p>External Research Program,</p>
<p>which continued with the same fax lines and executives,</p>
<p>funding universities like Stanford,</p>
<p>millions and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>And when I came to Stanford,</p>
<p>there were millions and millions of dollars</p>
<p>being given to medical professors by Philip Morris</p>
<p>as part of the Philip Morris External Research Program.</p>
<p>Well, what were they researching?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re researching genetics, they&rsquo;re researching diet,</p>
<p>anything but cigarettes causing cancer</p>
<p>and giving the non, giving the friendly research,</p>
<p>as Philip Morris often called it, of bigger voice.</p>
<p>They got money, they got jobs, you know.</p>
<p>It amplified that as a research tradition.</p>
<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s nothing natural in a university</p>
<p>about how many professors there are</p>
<p>of human origins versus AI.</p>
<p>This is all a political decision</p>
<p>at a very non-democratic institution.</p>
<p>Universities are less democratic than the Vatican.</p>
<p>At least the Pope is elected.</p>
<p>Who elects a president of a university</p>
<p>or a dean, for that matter?</p>
<p>And so what happened was I helped launch a campaign</p>
<p>to get Philip Morris off campus.</p>
<p>And people started coming out of the woodwork,</p>
<p>like, well, does this mean I shouldn&rsquo;t be working</p>
<p>for the CIA?</p>
<p>Does this mean I shouldn&rsquo;t be working for big oil?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what, you work for big oil?</p>
<p>And our faculty voted against</p>
<p>pushing Philip Morris off campus.</p>
<p>But Philip Morris got bad press from it.</p>
<p>And so they voluntarily withdrew the entire program.</p>
<p>So it was kind of a lesson in that you can lose a battle</p>
<p>but win a war if you&rsquo;re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And so by standing up, even though our own faculty</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t back us in kicking Philip Morris</p>
<p>out of the medical school,</p>
<p>Philip Morris did a cost-benefit analysis,</p>
<p>found, well, probably really not worth the kudos</p>
<p>we get for embracing Stanford.</p>
<p>So it can have an influence.</p>
<p>And in this case, the influence was simply by rewarding,</p>
<p>giving voice to the people who were blaming cholesterol</p>
<p>rather than cigarettes.</p>
<p>And of course, we know that historically,</p>
<p>the tobacco industry created a lot of these theories,</p>
<p>these alternative theories of what causes heart disease,</p>
<p>that stress causes heart disease, that salt,</p>
<p>or that anything but cigarettes.</p>
<p>They funded that research to basically skew</p>
<p>the whole research in their direction.</p>
<p>You edited a book titled Agnotology.</p>
<p>This is an interesting term.</p>
<p>So you mentioned it earlier,</p>
<p>The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance,</p>
<p>where you explore the topic of ignorance,</p>
<p>or the authors explore the topic of ignorance</p>
<p>in different applications and different contexts.</p>
<p>So let me ask the ridiculous, big philosophical question.</p>
<p>What is the nature of human ignorance?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing to say is that it&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Einstein quote or stupidity or something,</p>
<p>I forget what it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the point is that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably trillions of planets in the universe,</p>
<p>and we know one, you know a tiny piece of one.</p>
<p>But not only that, who are the we?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all born.</p>
<p>You know, we started as single-celled organisms, right?</p>
<p>As some sperm and some egg get together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly ignorant, and then we&rsquo;re ignorant.</p>
<p>Each one of us, there&rsquo;s an ontogeny of knowledge,</p>
<p>you say, but an ontogeny of ignorance as well.</p>
<p>We grow up, we have to learn.</p>
<p>But almost everything that has been known</p>
<p>has been forgotten.</p>
<p>If you think about the names of ordinary people,</p>
<p>and names of Neanderthal, did they even have names?</p>
<p>Most of the history of the world has been forgotten.</p>
<p>We have a few shreds, a few traces that we try.</p>
<p>History is a kind of resurrection projects,</p>
<p>a kind of archeological project and a genealogical project</p>
<p>where we look back and we find traces,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very biased.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in empires</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t even know anything about, you know?</p>
<p>And there are whole empires that are gone</p>
<p>if things don&rsquo;t leave a written trace.</p>
<p>You know, we know something about Mayan cosmology</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve got some of their stelae</p>
<p>and a few of their codices, four codices,</p>
<p>but we know the dozens that were burned by Diego de Londa,</p>
<p>the inquisitorial Spanish friar</p>
<p>who thought these were just heresies and so burned.</p>
<p>So that knowledge is all lost.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a lot of deep wisdom</p>
<p>about reality that is lost forever?</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>Well, it is sad, but the human condition is sad.</p>
<p>I mean, but then if we can study ignorance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also a positive thing.</p>
<p>Agnotology, the study of ignorance,</p>
<p>the study of the cultural production of ignorance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really-</p>
<p>Cultural production, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Cultural production of ignorance?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, you can-</p>
<p>So ignorance is not just a manifestation</p>
<p>of what it means to be human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also forced back onto you through the culture?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the missing piece</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t pay enough attention to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a natural vacuum we explore,</p>
<p>like some empty cave, it&rsquo;s there are factories of ignorance.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry,</p>
<p>when they built their propaganda engines</p>
<p>to deny that cigarettes cause cancer,</p>
<p>they measured exactly how much ignorance could be created</p>
<p>by watching one of their videos.</p>
<p>They would show that watching one of their propaganda videos</p>
<p>in the 1970s produced a 17% increase</p>
<p>in the people not willing to say</p>
<p>that cigarettes cause cancer.</p>
<p>So this is, I call it agnometrics.</p>
<p>They actually measured the success of their propaganda,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure this has been done in marketing</p>
<p>and in other fields as well.</p>
<p>That framing of it somehow is terrifying</p>
<p>because it seems like a very effective way</p>
<p>to be scientific about how to sort of</p>
<p>create doubt in the mind.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s diabolical,</p>
<p>and luckily we have some of the tobacco industry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>own internal documents, the ones that were not destroyed.</p>
<p>We actually know, we have some traces</p>
<p>as to which ones were destroyed,</p>
<p>and we know that the most sensitive were destroyed.</p>
<p>And we know that some of the ones that were sequestered</p>
<p>by whistleblowers or by disgruntled spouses or whatever,</p>
<p>that those contain the real gems and the truth.</p>
<p>And one of the ones that was leaked already in 1981</p>
<p>was the doubt is our product memo</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t just make cigarettes, we make two products.</p>
<p>We make doubt and we make cigarettes.</p>
<p>We make cigarettes, but we can only keep selling cigarettes</p>
<p>so long as we can keep selling ignorance.</p>
<p>And that then becomes a template of sorts</p>
<p>for climate denial and for all kinds of other denial engines</p>
<p>that are produced by the 1500 trade associations</p>
<p>in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>So this is something new in the research enterprise</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>After World War II, you have this enormous trust</p>
<p>in science, trust in research.</p>
<p>So what could be more effective than big tobacco saying,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;re supporting research.</p>
<p>We wanna get at the truth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re funding hundreds of millions of dollars of research,</p>
<p>which is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>What they didn&rsquo;t say was it was all an effort</p>
<p>to distract from the truth that cigarettes cause cancer</p>
<p>and a million other diseases, too.</p>
<p>Blindness, amputation, all kinds of other diseases.</p>
<p>All of that was hidden, covered up</p>
<p>through a distraction process.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon declares war on cancer in 1971.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the War on Cancer.</p>
<p>Cigarettes were excluded,</p>
<p>even though cigarettes cause a third of all cancers,</p>
<p>all cancer deaths.</p>
<p>Cigarettes were excluded because the tobacco industry</p>
<p>successfully argued that cigarettes cause cancer</p>
<p>is not a scientific fact, but a political opinion.</p>
<p>Much like the argument that guns don&rsquo;t cause death,</p>
<p>pulling the trigger causes death, or shooters, or whatever.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s all about breaking down</p>
<p>the chain of causation into pieces</p>
<p>that serve your interests.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that cigarettes cause cancer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe the smokey them at most,</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re even denying that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact you have lungs that cause cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blaming the victim,</p>
<p>and they had a thousand ways to blame the victim.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some legitimacy to this line of argument,</p>
<p>which is why it stakes, which is figuring out</p>
<p>what is the causation of things is hard to figure out.</p>
<p>A lot of the politics of science have to do</p>
<p>with which parts of the causal chain</p>
<p>do you view as real or not real.</p>
<p>When we say that carbon causes climate change,</p>
<p>well, what causes carbon?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Exxon causing carbon,</p>
<p>is it the person driving the car causing it,</p>
<p>or is it the Republican Party causing that,</p>
<p>or is it the Tea Party causing that,</p>
<p>or is it big tobacco and big oil</p>
<p>controlling the Republican Party, or is it what?</p>
<p>Is it the Jews controlling the weather,</p>
<p>which is where the conspiracy theories come in,</p>
<p>or the lizards, and whatever sticks.</p>
<p>You try it out, and if you&rsquo;re a tobacco company,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to actually literally be scientific about it</p>
<p>and try different options.</p>
<p>The genius of the tobacco conspiracy,</p>
<p>the tobacco denial campaign,</p>
<p>which is born on December 14th, 1953,</p>
<p>we know on an hour-by-hour basis how it worked,</p>
<p>is to create an alliance between solid research,</p>
<p>or as they called it, impassionate, dispassionate research,</p>
<p>and to tar all of their opponents as fanatical,</p>
<p>emotional, hysterical, political.</p>
<p>You mentioned Marxism at Harvard</p>
<p>a couple decades ago or something like that.</p>
<p>So 30 years ago, you wrote the value-free science book,</p>
<p>Purity and Power in Modern Knowledge,</p>
<p>which is interesting that you kind of,</p>
<p>what you were describing then</p>
<p>seems to be a concern for people now still.</p>
<p>So you were, I think, referencing more Nazi Germany</p>
<p>and how social scientists would attack or defend Marxism,</p>
<p>feminism, and other social movements using science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, you know, depending on who you talk to,</p>
<p>I just spent a day with Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some arguments that science is not being leveraged</p>
<p>in some part of the university, which bothers me,</p>
<p>because most of the university,</p>
<p>at least like MIT, is doing engineering and not,</p>
<p>ideology doesn&rsquo;t seep in yet,</p>
<p>but the concern they have is ideology seeps in eventually,</p>
<p>if you let it in at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ask all that, do you have some modern concerns</p>
<p>about the seeping in of ideology into academic research</p>
<p>in these social movements for or against Marxism,</p>
<p>for or against, you know, well, nobody&rsquo;s for racism,</p>
<p>but, you know, on the topic, like anti-racism,</p>
<p>all those kinds of critical race theory things,</p>
<p>and then also on the feminism and gender studies</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, these have always been in the university.</p>
<p>When people have been most adamant in saying</p>
<p>that science is a neutral, value-free enterprise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s times like the 1950s when there weren&rsquo;t blacks</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t even women in universities,</p>
<p>so what I discovered was that value neutrality</p>
<p>or this ideology of that we are value-free,</p>
<p>it really arose as a defensive shield</p>
<p>to prevent greater inclusion,</p>
<p>to prevent, you know, questioning</p>
<p>of the priorities of science, the practice of science,</p>
<p>the nature of science.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re in a period now, I think,</p>
<p>of a kind of inclusive revolution</p>
<p>where people are realizing, well, we can&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>you know, universities that look too much like a certain way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably gonna be, in that omelet making,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s gonna be a few eggs that get broken,</p>
<p>and I think people may exaggerate the extent</p>
<p>to which that&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s definitely real.</p>
<p>So like cancer culture, all those kinds of things, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely real,</p>
<p>but in a way, it&rsquo;s also a distraction</p>
<p>from looking at big power in a university.</p>
<p>If big oil is going to control, or at least influence,</p>
<p>the direction of the sustainability school at Stanford,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that a bigger issue than whether we have,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t say certain words on campus?</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s some very interesting</p>
<p>and complex aspects to this,</p>
<p>and the idea that certain words should not be said,</p>
<p>or that certain people should not be invited.</p>
<p>An invitation to a university is always political.</p>
<p>I mean, who do you invite, who do you not invite?</p>
<p>Much as an admissions process is,</p>
<p>if a student is admitted to Stanford,</p>
<p>what that really means is 96% of the applicants</p>
<p>did not get in, they were rejected,</p>
<p>they were canceled from a Stanford.</p>
<p>4% are admitted, they call it an admissions committee,</p>
<p>they should call it a rejection committee.</p>
<p>When we hire someone in my department at Stanford,</p>
<p>we get 300 applications, and maybe we accept one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hiring committee, it&rsquo;s a non-hiring committee.</p>
<p>That sounds like toxic cancel culture,</p>
<p>all these rejections.</p>
<p>Everybody should be accepted.</p>
<p>In that sense, it&rsquo;s the essence of meritocracy,</p>
<p>is that selection is involved in any hiring decision,</p>
<p>in any, because in a way,</p>
<p>when you were hired into a university,</p>
<p>you were hired to control the means of production,</p>
<p>at least part of it.</p>
<p>And this part of the politics of it</p>
<p>is invisible to the undergraduates,</p>
<p>because they are consumers,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re free as a consumer to eat whatever you want.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not free to own the means of production</p>
<p>to say what&rsquo;s on the menu.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the power is.</p>
<p>You have to ask the question,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the power in the university?</p>
<p>I think that at MIT,</p>
<p>the entire administration should get fired regularly,</p>
<p>and more power put in the hands of faculty and students.</p>
<p>There is an overgrowth that happens,</p>
<p>that it feels like administrators</p>
<p>are more easily influenced by big tobacco than faculty.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s me being sort of romantic</p>
<p>about the idea of faculty,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re in the battle doing the research,</p>
<p>I feel like, well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it feels like the administration</p>
<p>helps you delude yourself longer.</p>
<p>So it prevents you from waking up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no, it&rsquo;s okay to take this fine.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey Epstein, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And oh, okay, so he went to prison.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep it a little bit secret, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Just keep taking the money.</p>
<p>And I feel like that comes from the administration</p>
<p>more than the faculty.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s certainly a cult of celebrity,</p>
<p>a cult of money.</p>
<p>Donors have the, remember in the whole scandal</p>
<p>about the side door entrance in universities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always been the front door and the back door,</p>
<p>where the back door is the rich donors,</p>
<p>the kids of the rich donors,</p>
<p>the legacy kids that you still get.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of ways universities get corrupted.</p>
<p>They get corrupted through money,</p>
<p>they get corrupted through influence,</p>
<p>and that should be recognized.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re jumping around a little bit,</p>
<p>but I read you also do work on human origins.</p>
<p>So we mentioned this earlier.</p>
<p>Let me ask another big philosophical question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s human?</p>
<p>What makes us human?</p>
<p>What is human?</p>
<p>And where did that humanness come from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the question we need to problematize,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what I call the Gandhi question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, Gandhi&rsquo;s asked,</p>
<p>what do you think of Western civilization?</p>
<p>And he says, it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>And so when did humans evolve?</p>
<p>Well, not yet.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t talk about when did,</p>
<p>we talk about the rise of modern humanity.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happened in the last 50 or 60 years or so,</p>
<p>which I think is a good thing intellectually,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve smeared out humanness</p>
<p>to mean many different things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just tool use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just upright posture.</p>
<p>Upright posture goes back at least 5 million years.</p>
<p>Tool use goes back at least 2 1‚ÅÑ2 million years,</p>
<p>stone tool years.</p>
<p>But since wasps and chimpanzees use tools,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gotta be even older.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually one of the things I&rsquo;m interested is,</p>
<p>how have different notions of what is human</p>
<p>influenced our theories of human origins?</p>
<p>And in particular, there&rsquo;s sort of the problem</p>
<p>of what I call like sodomy in the uncanny valley,</p>
<p>which is, how long ago would you be willing</p>
<p>to date someone, say, someone that existed,</p>
<p>say, 5 million years ago, 10 million years ago,</p>
<p>3 million years ago?</p>
<p>In other words, when is it?</p>
<p>A date or one night stands?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s strong.</p>
<p>Either one, either one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, be the mother of your children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of commitment, but yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>because after World War II, as a result of Nazism,</p>
<p>no one wanted to be the one to say</p>
<p>that this particular fossil we&rsquo;ve just found</p>
<p>was anything less than fully human.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a projection of humanness</p>
<p>arbitrarily back into the past.</p>
<p>So that even these little monkey-like creatures,</p>
<p>ramipithecines, ramipithecus,</p>
<p>were being declared to have folkways and mores</p>
<p>and language, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>No one wanted to say that Neanderthals</p>
<p>were anything less than fully human.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>At what point are they us?</p>
<p>I mean, human origins is very much an identity quest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when did we become us?</p>
<p>Which sort of begs the question, what are we?</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>And how much of that is the hardware evolution question</p>
<p>versus the software?</p>
<p>Like, what the actual development of society,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you argue that we became human with agriculture?</p>
<p>I mean, can&rsquo;t you argue that we became human</p>
<p>with the Industrial Revolution?</p>
<p>Well, certainly by then, they are us.</p>
<p>But agriculture is only 12,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a blink in the eye, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, prior to the 19th century,</p>
<p>most scholars thought that the pyramids</p>
<p>were at the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Essentially, they were closer to the beginning of time</p>
<p>than they are to us.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a blink in the eye.</p>
<p>We use the metaphor of a meter.</p>
<p>The Earth is five billion, so that&rsquo;s a meter.</p>
<p>The natural history of upright humans is five million.</p>
<p>So that would be like one millimeter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be the thickness of the white of your fingernail.</p>
<p>And then the pyramids are 5,000,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a thousandth of a millimeter, a micron.</p>
<p>Which is the amount taken off</p>
<p>when you brush your fingers on your jacket.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a natural history of humanity,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the history of our constituents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all stardust, because all of our complex atoms</p>
<p>began in supernovas many billions of years ago.</p>
<p>But upright posture, five million.</p>
<p>Agriculture, only a few thousand years ago.</p>
<p>We cultivate dogs a couple hundred thousand years ago,</p>
<p>so those are Paleolithic instruments.</p>
<p>Cats are Neolithic instruments,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re used to kill vermin.</p>
<p>Dogs are used to hunt with us.</p>
<p>But there is what you say, this co-evolution.</p>
<p>Our social aspect and our physical aspect.</p>
<p>Even the fact that we have whites of the eyes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only animal with whites of the eyes.</p>
<p>And the whites of the eyes tell intent.</p>
<p>They tell direction, they tell interest.</p>
<p>They know if you look at something,</p>
<p>I can tell what you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lateral resolution.</p>
<p>I can tell what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s recent.</p>
<p>And the people who do reconstruction for museums,</p>
<p>they want to create what I call an ethnographic identity</p>
<p>with the viewer, and so they fantasize</p>
<p>about all these other early hominids,</p>
<p>non-human, pre-human hominids, if that&rsquo;s a word,</p>
<p>as having eyes like us, but they probably didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they were probably not self-aware.</p>
<p>At least the early ones can&rsquo;t have been self-aware</p>
<p>the way we are, insofar as we are.</p>
<p>They may not have spoke.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in, basically,</p>
<p>when did we become what we think is human?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that when we start burying the dead</p>
<p>and making jewelry, and when we, in a sense,</p>
<p>invent fantasy, when we invent deception,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s human, that&rsquo;s fully human.</p>
<p>We become human by thinking there&rsquo;s a world</p>
<p>that really is not.</p>
<p>I mean, that feels like we&rsquo;re starting to operate</p>
<p>in the space of ideas more and more.</p>
<p>So to have deception, to have imagination,</p>
<p>you start to be able to have ideas and share them.</p>
<p>And it feels like the sharing is the thing</p>
<p>that really develops the ideas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not you come up with ideas.</p>
<p>And we become able to sort of understand</p>
<p>what each other is thinking.</p>
<p>Some animals can do this to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Dogs have a certain empathy, but it&rsquo;s limited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly limited.</p>
<p>But you could probably argue that the dogs</p>
<p>got that from the humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, humans and dogs have co-evolved,</p>
<p>have definitely co-evolved,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s over 100,000 years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working together there.</p>
<p>But all our hands have evolved with tools.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m trying to figure out now</p>
<p>the original purpose of Acheulean hand axes,</p>
<p>the first beautiful tool made by humans,</p>
<p>which were made unchanged for-</p>
<p>What kind of axes is this?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called Acheulean hand axes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re these beautiful teardrop-shaped objects</p>
<p>that go back 1.5 million years.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your thought about its possible purposes?</p>
<p>Well, the most important thing, I think-</p>
<p>To murder?</p>
<p>Is that-</p>
<p>A jealous husband comes home?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s astonishing is that no one knows</p>
<p>what they were used for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they may have been maps.</p>
<p>They may have been weapons.</p>
<p>They may have been chopping devices.</p>
<p>They may have been sexual displays.</p>
<p>Oh, like ornaments to display something</p>
<p>versus actual practical-</p>
<p>Like the peacock&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>Something to attract a mate.</p>
<p>No one really knows.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is how in becoming ignorant of those,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a form of knowledge.</p>
<p>In other words, a lot of-</p>
<p>This is one reason I&rsquo;m interested in ignorance,</p>
<p>is that really, to understand something,</p>
<p>and especially to teach something,</p>
<p>you have to know what people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to remember what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to not know something once you know it.</p>
<p>Very hard, very hard to do.</p>
<p>But you sort of have to do that</p>
<p>to recreate that moment you can teach.</p>
<p>Well, one nice thing I like about the internet</p>
<p>is you can look at old tweets of yours</p>
<p>and to be like, okay, for some reason it brings to mind,</p>
<p>like, okay, that&rsquo;s where my mind was.</p>
<p>Another interesting exercise is Google search history.</p>
<p>So I think for everybody, you can look up your own history</p>
<p>of what you searched for.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so cool to go back to 2008 or something like that.</p>
<p>Like, oh, okay, I remember where your mind was.</p>
<p>And immediately, actually, it&rsquo;s a nice way to restore</p>
<p>at least an inkling of the ignorance you had,</p>
<p>or have a peek into the ignorance you had about the world.</p>
<p>And also to discover the things you&rsquo;ve forgotten,</p>
<p>the new ignorance you have now.</p>
<p>You say, oh, right, right.</p>
<p>I was really concerned about this and that.</p>
<p>I do think that, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both sad and illuminating to think about</p>
<p>that most of what we&rsquo;ve known,</p>
<p>even like the deep wisdom,</p>
<p>is forgotten as a human civilization.</p>
<p>But, you know, we create it new all the time as well, so.</p>
<p>Right, hopefully forgetting is a feature and not just a bug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those mice that can&rsquo;t forget, they go insane.</p>
<p>If you imagine all of your memories as present,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a recipe for insanity.</p>
<p>You have to forget to learn, right?</p>
<p>Learning is unlearning.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why I drink now.</p>
<p>And then write some blues songs</p>
<p>about forgetting a broken heart.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned Amber and Stone Collection.</p>
<p>I just have to ask, does that connect to human origins</p>
<p>or just a personal love?</p>
<p>What is it about Stone Collecting that attracts you?</p>
<p>Well, scholars tend to be text-oriented.</p>
<p>I tend to think books are overrated.</p>
<p>We evolved without books.</p>
<p>You know, I walk for a couple of hours</p>
<p>in the forest every day.</p>
<p>I gather mushrooms and all kinds of things,</p>
<p>just located pieces of the 1953 Resolution airplane crash</p>
<p>outside of Half Moon Bay just a couple days ago.</p>
<p>I like finding things.</p>
<p>Have you ever found pieces of a crashed UFO?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Not yet, okay.</p>
<p>All right, let me know, please, if you do.</p>
<p>But of course we have extraterrestrial other stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, we have, I collect meteorites, so I&rsquo;m into that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m interested in stone, stone quality.</p>
<p>I grew up in Southern Texas and grew up surrounded</p>
<p>by people who would hunt for stone and gather stone</p>
<p>and cut stone.</p>
<p>I cut stone as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lapidary.</p>
<p>And so I have this interest in the physical qualities</p>
<p>of objects, sometimes called material culture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m interested to know how different cultures</p>
<p>have manipulated stuff, worked stuff, stone, wood,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>And also the fantasies people project into it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing a book on all the different ways</p>
<p>different cultures have found different images in stone,</p>
<p>like Roshak tests.</p>
<p>And so in India, they love agates with Hindu temples</p>
<p>in them and altars.</p>
<p>And in America, they like, you know,</p>
<p>three crosses on the mount.</p>
<p>And if you can find a stone with the word Allah in it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beloved in Yemen or Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long history of people projecting fantasy</p>
<p>into stone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m using that as a kind of a metaphor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also looking at the rise of hobbies</p>
<p>and amateur stonework and how a lot of our gemologic</p>
<p>techniques were actually invented by amateurs,</p>
<p>which means just lovers, as opposed to professionals.</p>
<p>The amateur is the lover.</p>
<p>And hobbies, I don&rsquo;t know if you know,</p>
<p>but the word hobby comes from a hobbled horse.</p>
<p>And so you would hobble a horse to keep it from running.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hobbling it with a stick or a string.</p>
<p>And then kids would ride a hobbled horse for play,</p>
<p>a horse on a stick.</p>
<p>And riding a hobbled horse becomes riding a hobby horse.</p>
<p>And then that becomes a hobby.</p>
<p>And so hobbies become this so-called job you can&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>in the Great Depression in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And then they explode.</p>
<p>And so when I was a kid, people would collect coins</p>
<p>or stamps or fossils or this or that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in that collecting passion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting, the development of hobbies,</p>
<p>because it feels like the future of human civilization</p>
<p>will be very hobby-driven.</p>
<p>Some of the, I often now,</p>
<p>because of this particular little thing I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>with the podcast, I get to interact with photographers</p>
<p>and videographers, and I&rsquo;m disappointed to find</p>
<p>how many professionals are not very good</p>
<p>and how many hobbyists are very good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost-</p>
<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re amateurs, they&rsquo;re the lovers.</p>
<p>I mean, you can think, that&rsquo;s what that means.</p>
<p>From Amur, you&rsquo;re an amateur if you&rsquo;re a lover of the thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not in it for the money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in it because you&rsquo;re obsessed.</p>
<p>But sort of as the GDP, as our freedom grows</p>
<p>to sort of financially to be able to have a hobby,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;ll be more lovers,</p>
<p>more amateurs in the world,</p>
<p>and not just for the artistic pursuits,</p>
<p>but like science, technology development,</p>
<p>building all kinds of technologies,</p>
<p>almost like as a hobby.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have much more freedom to figure out</p>
<p>what is the thing you love doing.</p>
<p>And actually, over time, you won&rsquo;t even notice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll start making money.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>And yeah, it does kind of, I mean,</p>
<p>when did that originate?</p>
<p>Just the collection, the widespread-</p>
<p>It goes through different stages.</p>
<p>People have always gathered the odd thing</p>
<p>to make something else.</p>
<p>But you also get this tradition</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called curiosity cabinets,</p>
<p>especially in the Renaissance,</p>
<p>which replaced the kind of treasure chambers</p>
<p>of the ancient sultans or kings or whatever.</p>
<p>And you get these curiosity cabinets</p>
<p>that were often linked with magical practices,</p>
<p>alchemical practices.</p>
<p>People would gather bezoars, or they would gather,</p>
<p>they would have an alligator hanging from the ceiling,</p>
<p>or they would have a rare shrunken head or whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the rise of natural history,</p>
<p>the idea that you taxonomize the world,</p>
<p>you classify the world, you look for the rare object,</p>
<p>the rarity.</p>
<p>And rarity still is a kind of virtue,</p>
<p>like the recent news about trying</p>
<p>to figure out ball lightning.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, ball lightning was the big question.</p>
<p>Does it exist, does it not exist?</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s new evidence of how it actually might.</p>
<p>Wait, what, really?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new evidence?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s new evidence.</p>
<p>When I grew up with that, my dad, when I was young,</p>
<p>told me, I asked him, like, how do I win a Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>He said, invent a time machine</p>
<p>or figure out how ball lightning works.</p>
<p>And so I got really excited.</p>
<p>I was like, damn it, I&rsquo;m gonna figure out</p>
<p>how this ball lightning works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting from a history of science</p>
<p>point of view because it&rsquo;s so rare</p>
<p>that in a way it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t replicate it, you can&rsquo;t make it,</p>
<p>does it really exist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like Libyan glass.</p>
<p>Another thing I collect is Libyan glass,</p>
<p>which is a tektite, which falls</p>
<p>as a result of a meteorite.</p>
<p>A meteorite hits the Earth, blasts Earth up into space,</p>
<p>it falls back down as a glass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a tektite.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a rare form of it called Libyan glass,</p>
<p>which fell probably around 20 million years ago</p>
<p>and now works out of the Sahara every now and then.</p>
<p>It was the most valuable stone of antiquity.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of Tutankhamen&rsquo;s breastplate</p>
<p>is made of this beautiful yellow gemstone Libyan glass.</p>
<p>So rarity is something that the hobbyists</p>
<p>have always liked to cherish.</p>
<p>The rarity, and science has a kind of often aversion,</p>
<p>is a kind of a love-hate relationship</p>
<p>with rarity and novelty.</p>
<p>Science is often trying to pursue novelty</p>
<p>to make discoveries.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t replicate it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like what does it really exist?</p>
<p>Which is why UFOs and aliens and all those kinds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a general aversion to that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a one-time event.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad because there&rsquo;s, just like you said,</p>
<p>singular events or rare events</p>
<p>are somehow really inspiring to us.</p>
<p>And so you kind of have to balance that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a scientific process,</p>
<p>but you also have to, it&rsquo;s the thing you find</p>
<p>with the weird, the peculiar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, huh, what is that?</p>
<p>Even the universe itself.</p>
<p>It could be that the universe begins</p>
<p>and then will end, say in a cold death, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be a one-off thing.</p>
<p>Or it could be one of an infinite many cycles.</p>
<p>And maybe all of the laws of nature</p>
<p>are recreated anew with each cycle.</p>
<p>Or maybe what we&rsquo;re assuming about the Big Bang,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some element of falsity.</p>
<p>Maybe the speed of light is not constant,</p>
<p>but changes over time.</p>
<p>That would throw into question all kinds of theories</p>
<p>about dark matter and dark energy,</p>
<p>and even the age of the universe.</p>
<p>And to me, there&rsquo;s very likely trillions</p>
<p>of conversations going on like this on other planets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In different.</p>
<p>Yeah, no doubt.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Different kinds of drugs, different communication styles,</p>
<p>different timescales at which life form is,</p>
<p>or what life looks like, or how life behaves,</p>
<p>or what life is.</p>
<p>And all those things, every time you think about this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more and more humbling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this whole fog of ignorance.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, what drives me crazy</p>
<p>is wondering about the beautiful gemstones</p>
<p>on other planets.</p>
<p>I call them exo-aggots.</p>
<p>They must be unbelievable features and forms</p>
<p>which are unimaginable to us.</p>
<p>Because one thing we do know is that nature is very creative.</p>
<p>I mean, we are the product of nature,</p>
<p>and we seem to be fairly creative.</p>
<p>And so imagine what else nature has created.</p>
<p>But even that&rsquo;s unknown.</p>
<p>How common is life in the universe?</p>
<p>Is it common, or is it rare?</p>
<p>We only have a sample size of one.</p>
<p>It could be quite common, or it could be even unique.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I tend to believe it&rsquo;s everywhere,</p>
<p>except for the fact that we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how to define what life is.</p>
<p>Like, what is everywhere exactly that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>anywhere in the universe an organism</p>
<p>with two legs and two arms, with two eyes,</p>
<p>and mostly hairless, walking around at this time scale.</p>
<p>But there could be very different kind of other things.</p>
<p>It was interesting, there&rsquo;s some people,</p>
<p>this is not a common belief,</p>
<p>but a friend now named Lee Cronin,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a chemist and biologist,</p>
<p>and he believes that if we ran evolution</p>
<p>over and over and over and over on Earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get very different.</p>
<p>Not just, you wouldn&rsquo;t just get different organisms,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get very different biology.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite possible, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a weird thing.</p>
<p>I mean, most people kind of assume,</p>
<p>well, it kind of, you know, it fits to the environment,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get similar things,</p>
<p>maybe not humans and so on,</p>
<p>but to get very different biology,</p>
<p>like starting from the bacteria to the, you know, just how.</p>
<p>Well, the idea that it would be DNA-based</p>
<p>on some other planet, that seems to me</p>
<p>like saying they&rsquo;re speaking Swahili on some other planet.</p>
<p>I mean, the odds of that particular architecture,</p>
<p>I think, are infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the coolest stone you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</p>
<p>Oh my God, there&rsquo;s so many.</p>
<p>And what defines, is it rarity, is it just raw beauty?</p>
<p>What captivates your excitement?</p>
<p>I like a storied stone.</p>
<p>I have a very beautiful Fairburn agate,</p>
<p>which has multiple layers,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something I call agate paralysis,</p>
<p>because to polish it, you have to go through the layers,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;re destroying the layers.</p>
<p>And maybe what should be done</p>
<p>is it should be like a movie,</p>
<p>where you film the entire process of cutting and polishing</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not dead.</p>
<p>In other words, what was the diamond when it started rough?</p>
<p>The rough diamond is gone,</p>
<p>but if you could sort of do a filmic version</p>
<p>of a cutting process so that the stone would exist</p>
<p>from a pre-polished to a polished state,</p>
<p>all as a kind of NFT or something.</p>
<p>That should be an NFT, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So the other thing I fantasize about</p>
<p>is how pattern recognition technology</p>
<p>will probably in the future allow us</p>
<p>to discover all kinds of amazing stones,</p>
<p>including, for example, fossil skulls,</p>
<p>fossil skulls of humans.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s kind of a chance process</p>
<p>that you discover a skull in East Africa,</p>
<p>but why not have a drone moving constantly,</p>
<p>scanning for pattern recognition of human skull,</p>
<p>human teeth, very slowly.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>Just on the surface, you mean?</p>
<p>Just above the surface, just 10 feet above the surface,</p>
<p>20 feet above the surface.</p>
<p>No, no, no, sorry.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;ll be able to find skulls on the surface?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, in the middle of a place that no one has looked.</p>
<p>These areas are vast, right?</p>
<p>So it could be found on the surface,</p>
<p>then move to the next layer,</p>
<p>then find it under the surface as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s LIDAR, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finding jungle cities under the Amazon</p>
<p>that people didn&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something out there</p>
<p>that would just blow your mind?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, no doubt.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>And how much of it is a little bit underground, right?</p>
<p>Or how much of it is in the ocean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, here, right here, we are in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>We know that much of the Native American civilization here</p>
<p>was under the bay because 6,000 years ago,</p>
<p>the bay was dry.</p>
<p>It was a river, not a bay.</p>
<p>And so all of those, whatever material,</p>
<p>culture, archeological traces existed there</p>
<p>are now at least preserved under the water.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re just beginning to touch the-</p>
<p>Could be treasure, too.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, like you said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll lose the wisdom or we&rsquo;ll lose the knowledge,</p>
<p>but I mean, if there&rsquo;s the pyramids, right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the great wonders of the world,</p>
<p>there might be other wonders that are completely lost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just something&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I mean, one of the stones, you asked about stones I like.</p>
<p>I like stones, for example,</p>
<p>every now and then, dinosaurs would eat rocks</p>
<p>as gizzard stones, and then you find them</p>
<p>in their guts, in their bones.</p>
<p>Well, every now and then,</p>
<p>they would eat a piece of petrified wood.</p>
<p>So the idea that something was a tree,</p>
<p>and then stone, and then swallowed by a dinosaur,</p>
<p>and ground up in the gizzard, and polished,</p>
<p>and then left in a, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I like things that have been through dramatic-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s, okay,</p>
<p>the really fascinating thing,</p>
<p>why seeing Allah or crosses in the stone</p>
<p>is it feels like the stone has wisdom</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been through so many generations of humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bigger.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seen it all.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s also the intellectual question</p>
<p>of intelligent design.</p>
<p>In other words, when people say intelligent design,</p>
<p>mostly it&rsquo;s bogus,</p>
<p>but there are several interesting examples</p>
<p>of actual intelligent design,</p>
<p>meaning when is a stone the product of artifice</p>
<p>and when is it a geofact produced by nature?</p>
<p>And that was an important discovery in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The zone of percussion, it&rsquo;s called, the percussion zone.</p>
<p>Or how do you know that a signal from out of space</p>
<p>is an intelligent signal?</p>
<p>And as opposed to hydrogen doing something</p>
<p>or some natural thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the genuine problem of intelligent design.</p>
<p>How do you know if it&rsquo;s pi, maybe if it&rsquo;s E,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s some pattern,</p>
<p>how do you know that that&rsquo;s an intelligent signal?</p>
<p>How do you know that an artifact in the ground</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll see in the clouds a face?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called pareidolia.</p>
<p>We have a kind of a built-in ability to see faces</p>
<p>where they really aren&rsquo;t there, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why kids like clowns.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved that so babies evolve it</p>
<p>to recognize their parents and so forth.</p>
<p>But when is it a projection</p>
<p>and when is it really in the stone?</p>
<p>And that was a big question with the rise of fossils.</p>
<p>If you find a curly thing, is that life or is it non-life?</p>
<p>People have made this mistake before.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find a rock on the moon or Mars.</p>
<p>They say, oh, this is a face or whatever.</p>
<p>Well, no, that&rsquo;s just projection, that&rsquo;s pareidolia.</p>
<p>I guess throughout science you have this problem of signal.</p>
<p>Just because something is beautiful</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it was, I mean, that&rsquo;s not a good signal</p>
<p>to determine if it&rsquo;s intelligent design</p>
<p>or natural evolution or natural design.</p>
<p>Just because you see a stone that just,</p>
<p>the pattern is incredible.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s a fossil is one question,</p>
<p>namely the remnants of an organism.</p>
<p>And how do you know if it was manipulated by a human?</p>
<p>This is a big problem in trying to figure out</p>
<p>the oldest art.</p>
<p>If you find scratchings on a bone, is that a tally?</p>
<p>Is it someone marking her menstrual period?</p>
<p>Is it phases of the moon?</p>
<p>Or is it trampling by an antelope?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s called the science of taphonomy</p>
<p>to discern when a marking on a bone or a stone</p>
<p>is in a sense an artifact or a geofact</p>
<p>or an antelope effect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an intellectually challenging question.</p>
<p>And people wanna fantasize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find a stone that looks like a carving</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 300,000 years old.</p>
<p>Generally, I think those are just odd stones.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t find the explosion of carved stone</p>
<p>until around 60,000 years ago, 50, 60,000 years ago.</p>
<p>There seems to be something that paleoanthropologists</p>
<p>call the creative explosion or the big bang of the mind</p>
<p>that produces a kind of ability to see in the distance,</p>
<p>to identify a shape in an object,</p>
<p>to create a shape in an object that you don&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>The Neanderthals don&rsquo;t seem to have ever done</p>
<p>what we would call art.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting phenomenon, you know?</p>
<p>But it requires that you have some understanding</p>
<p>when is something art and when is it just,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s a rock that looks like a face.</p>
<p>Or some, not necessarily understanding,</p>
<p>but a conception that&rsquo;s mutually agreed upon</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>because maybe Neanderthals, maybe fish,</p>
<p>have a conception of art that just.</p>
<p>And this also gets back to your question</p>
<p>about professional bias and ideology,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a huge reward for finding the oldest art.</p>
<p>If everyone says it&rsquo;s 50,000 years ago</p>
<p>and you find one that&rsquo;s 300,000 years ago,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge discovery.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bias.</p>
<p>And this has been one of the things that&rsquo;s led</p>
<p>to probably the overproliferation</p>
<p>of different species of hominids,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no academic reward</p>
<p>for finding yet another example of someone else&rsquo;s species.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a huge reward if you can find a Lex Friedmanite,</p>
<p>you can name it after yourself or whatever, new fossil.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge professional reward</p>
<p>to be the first at something.</p>
<p>And so those types of professional rewards</p>
<p>also influence science and what kind of science gets done.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m always suspicious of,</p>
<p>and as we should all be when you can kind of intuit</p>
<p>a financial and otherwise motivation.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s actually often in the modern age</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m suspicious of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the logic doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I personally actually just enjoy conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to Flat Earthers</p>
<p>discuss stuff recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of exciting for some reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, because I consider like,</p>
<p>what if it&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to discover together,</p>
<p>like think through first principles,</p>
<p>like what does the world look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the childlike discovery of a new idea.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m skeptical of a lot of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>is when I see how popular you can get</p>
<p>propagating those conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>how quickly you can form a large movement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, hmm.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s such thin evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if Loch Ness exists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just one?</p>
<p>I mean, how does the reproduction work on that?</p>
<p>How do you talk about an animal</p>
<p>that has only one in a population?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t, some of the things don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>No, but see, this is the logic side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even go that far.</p>
<p>The fact is, if you say there&rsquo;s a Loch Ness monster,</p>
<p>I just see how quickly the idea spreads in popularity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people are hungry to discover something new,</p>
<p>just like you mentioned with the hominids.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very suspicious of where there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a strange hunger for ideas,</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re less likely to be objective</p>
<p>and rigorous in considering the validity of that idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to the logic,</p>
<p>because actually, flat Earth is pretty logical.</p>
<p>Yeah, very logical.</p>
<p>Logic is not the problem.</p>
<p>Right, but it spreads really quickly.</p>
<p>And once again, with conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>I think it represents,</p>
<p>you have to think about the cause of causes,</p>
<p>or cause of cause of causes, like you talked about,</p>
<p>which is like, it represents some deeper fragmenting</p>
<p>of the common humanity,</p>
<p>who have the trust in the big community that is science</p>
<p>and the big community that is government,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why things like ball lightning are cool,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, the scientist denied it, but here it is.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And that ultimately ends up being-</p>
<p>Everyone said I was insane, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, you said there&rsquo;s some breakthroughs?</p>
<p>I need to look it up, it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, check it out, it&rsquo;s pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some new theories</p>
<p>of how it actually might work.</p>
<p>Because I think, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously several ways to prove that.</p>
<p>Like, one of them is to recreate it in the lab,</p>
<p>which is probably very, very difficult.</p>
<p>Just because we&rsquo;re on the topic of rocks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard about this interstellar rock</p>
<p>that flew through our, called the Mua Mua.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the cigar-shaped one.</p>
<p>The cigar-shaped one.</p>
<p>As a fan of rocks, what do you think about that one?</p>
<p>Well, I think that generally,</p>
<p>I mean, when the people were speculating</p>
<p>it might be a spaceship, I thought, come on,</p>
<p>rocks do all kinds of crazy things.</p>
<p>They do a lot more than you realize.</p>
<p>They can do unbelievably cool things.</p>
<p>There are parts of the desert there in Utah</p>
<p>where rocks move and create these long tracks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, now we know it&rsquo;s from liquefaction</p>
<p>and wind and various other things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still unbelievably cool.</p>
<p>Rocks can do almost anything.</p>
<p>And so, just the fact that one comes from</p>
<p>outside the solar system</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be a spaceship.</p>
<p>So, but nonetheless, I thought it was awesome.</p>
<p>I thought it was really, really cool</p>
<p>and I sort of wish it would happen more often.</p>
<p>I kind of hope it&rsquo;s trash from another alien civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fantastic.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>if humans are all a lesson,</p>
<p>that we produce like more trash</p>
<p>than we do intelligent signal.</p>
<p>So, the first thing to reach other civilizations</p>
<p>I feel like would be our trash, our pollution,</p>
<p>before the intelligent signal reaches them.</p>
<p>You mentioned this interesting term, Russianist.</p>
<p>The things we do for love.</p>
<p>For some reason, you went to Germany.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, you said you&rsquo;re pretty eloquent with German.</p>
<p>I learned German, yeah.</p>
<p>Did you ever learn Russian a little bit?</p>
<p>I did learn Russian.</p>
<p>Yeah, I studied actually Russian as an undergraduate</p>
<p>at Indiana University for several years.</p>
<p>And then I wanted to do a Russian,</p>
<p>I wanted to do Russian and Chinese as a graduate student</p>
<p>because I thought this is kind of the future.</p>
<p>And Harvard said, no, it has to be French and German.</p>
<p>And so, I essentially gave up on my Russian and Chinese.</p>
<p>And the other part of that story is nonetheless,</p>
<p>I wanted to do something with Russian.</p>
<p>I wanted to study how much the Lamarckian ideology</p>
<p>and biology in Russia at the time</p>
<p>that led to their distrust of genetics under Stalin</p>
<p>had to do with the fact that genetics</p>
<p>was being pushed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>And we tend to see those literatures in isolation.</p>
<p>Nazis were racist, the Russians were environmentalists</p>
<p>biased by Lamarckian theories of heredity</p>
<p>and rejected that part of Darwin.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re right next to each other at the very same time,</p>
<p>there must be a connection.</p>
<p>And so, I started reading into this</p>
<p>and I actually got a Fulbright to go write a book on this</p>
<p>and canceled all my classes.</p>
<p>I was teaching at the New School</p>
<p>for Social Research at the time.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t get a visa into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I was just barred admission for doing this project,</p>
<p>looking at how Stalinist science</p>
<p>had this anti-Nazi aspect which we&rsquo;ve overlooked.</p>
<p>Which year was this?</p>
<p>This was when the Soviet Union was still together.</p>
<p>Yes, that was in the late 1980s, but before.</p>
<p>Gorbachev was in power, but it wasn&rsquo;t before 89.</p>
<p>But still then, there was a careful attention to.</p>
<p>Well, you never know how careful it was</p>
<p>or built to the cracks.</p>
<p>You never know when something fails.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t always know why it failed.</p>
<p>But I was very disappointed</p>
<p>and it sort of ended that project.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have access to the archives on it.</p>
<p>I could have obviously done it later, but you know.</p>
<p>So, there was that curiosity initially,</p>
<p>but then you focused on the Nazi side of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean the other thing was</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out where to go</p>
<p>for a Fulbright on a different year.</p>
<p>And I wanted to go to China.</p>
<p>And turns out you could only go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really want to go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>And it was one in 50 odds of going to Taiwan,</p>
<p>but it was one in three of going to Germany.</p>
<p>And so I ended up going to Germany.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any particular interest</p>
<p>in Germany at that time.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>So I wrote one book in German, actually.</p>
<p>I wrote two books on Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>And otherwise I might have been doing the same thing</p>
<p>in Russian or Chinese.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are.</p>
<p>In other words, history chooses us</p>
<p>as much as we choose history, right?</p>
<p>And those are really powerful cultures, right?</p>
<p>Maybe can you comment on the German</p>
<p>and the Russian and the Chinese,</p>
<p>how much language,</p>
<p>when you were reading those medical journals,</p>
<p>how much are you able to understand?</p>
<p>How important is it to understand language deeply</p>
<p>in order to understand the culture?</p>
<p>Did you struggle?</p>
<p>And the opposite of that,</p>
<p>did you find the beauty of the moment,</p>
<p>like richly understand the moment</p>
<p>because you had a hold of the language?</p>
<p>Well, in the Russian or Chinese case, no.</p>
<p>I never got that far with it.</p>
<p>I knew enough, I could read some Russian</p>
<p>and I could tell there were anthropologists</p>
<p>who were anti-Nazi and therefore anti-genetics.</p>
<p>And they saw genetics as essentially Nazi.</p>
<p>And that was enough for me.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s something there,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have enough time.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go and actually research it.</p>
<p>In the German case, you never fully know a language.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t fully know English.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always more to learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always learning new.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the word done last year, D-U-N.</p>
<p>I mean, some kind of brown color.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always finding new words.</p>
<p>The words are near infinite as well, right?</p>
<p>And new combinations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve coined several words too in my life.</p>
<p>But it did help understanding the humor,</p>
<p>understanding the romance,</p>
<p>and mainly just plowing through</p>
<p>all of these medical journals,</p>
<p>one after another after another.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a voyeuristic aspect</p>
<p>to looking into this lost world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reading texts by people who have died long ago.</p>
<p>And direct, it&rsquo;s not like reading books by famous people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like real people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real people and they make mistakes.</p>
<p>And fascinating little stories.</p>
<p>I was looking at how the Nazi tobacco industry</p>
<p>had their own denial campaign,</p>
<p>which was pro-Nazi and pro-tobacco,</p>
<p>even though the Nazi regime was anti-tobacco.</p>
<p>And they developed a lot of these rhetorical tricks</p>
<p>that were later used by the Americans.</p>
<p>Like, oh, you can&rsquo;t trust that evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s merely statistical.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t trust the animal experiments</p>
<p>because all it proves is that mice should not smoke.</p>
<p>But I noticed, just in passing,</p>
<p>these remarkable stories, little hints.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a report from a Japanese military man</p>
<p>in one of these tobacco journals,</p>
<p>tobacco industry journals in the Nazi period.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re talking about this brotherhood</p>
<p>of all men through cigarettes.</p>
<p>And the tragedy that the Chinese and the Japanese,</p>
<p>who were fighting each other,</p>
<p>in a way wanted nothing more than to smoke together.</p>
<p>And the Chinese would sneak up to the Japanese forts</p>
<p>to try to find a Japanese cigarette</p>
<p>that had been thrown away and they&rsquo;d be glowing.</p>
<p>And the Japanese knew this.</p>
<p>And they would throw their cigarettes out,</p>
<p>the Chinese would come,</p>
<p>and then the Japanese would kill these Chinese.</p>
<p>And then this guy is poetically lamenting the fact</p>
<p>that even though all they want is a smoke,</p>
<p>they nonetheless end up in the crosshairs and in death.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just weird, and I&rsquo;m reading this,</p>
<p>translated from the Japanese into German</p>
<p>in a Nazi tobacco industry newspaper.</p>
<p>I mean, the layers of weirdness</p>
<p>are really fascinating and touching, but.</p>
<p>And those very kind of brotherhood stories</p>
<p>actually resonated later.</p>
<p>Because I mean, that&rsquo;s how I feel about cigarettes.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite moments in early life</p>
<p>is about people connecting over a cigarette.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And that, you know, that works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, those narratives.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the movies, right?</p>
<p>The movies, it&rsquo;s called Meet Cute.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry, when they put cigarettes into a movie,</p>
<p>they put it in right at the moment where boy meets girl.</p>
<p>Let me ask you just, in all the research you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>with Nazi Germany, just for me,</p>
<p>from a conversational perspective,</p>
<p>I was listening to a bunch of Holocaust survivors recently</p>
<p>just on YouTube, listening to interviews.</p>
<p>Also listening to Nazi SS soldiers,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re still alive, or were recently.</p>
<p>Some of them, especially the ones</p>
<p>that deny many aspects of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re still, still, it&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>Anyway, in your research,</p>
<p>are there interesting people to talk to?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still alive?</p>
<p>Or are they mostly, that part of history</p>
<p>is no longer living, is in the books?</p>
<p>It is mostly no longer living.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason in the 1980s</p>
<p>when I started working on Nazi science,</p>
<p>I really did interview quite a few people,</p>
<p>and elderly people, people who had sort of slipped</p>
<p>through the cracks, you know,</p>
<p>maybe even should have been prosecuted.</p>
<p>So few people got prosecuted.</p>
<p>But these were people who had racial theories,</p>
<p>who published on these topics, and they were guarded.</p>
<p>But these were the lives they lived.</p>
<p>And you know, mainly they wanted people</p>
<p>not to be talking too much about this.</p>
<p>So it gets sealed off, and walled off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why reading the medical literature itself</p>
<p>was so much more valuable.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no self-censorship, it&rsquo;s just there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some censorship,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what they said is what they said,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s immense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s immense and largely unread.</p>
<p>As I said, there are hundreds and hundreds</p>
<p>of Nazi medical journals,</p>
<p>and people had not been reading those</p>
<p>before I really started looking at them.</p>
<p>Given that you studied these really difficult parts</p>
<p>of human history and human nature with big tobacco,</p>
<p>and just these mechanisms of manipulation,</p>
<p>what gives you hope about the future?</p>
<p>Oh, all kinds of things give me hope.</p>
<p>The forest gives me hope.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia gives me hope.</p>
<p>Space exploration gives me hope.</p>
<p>All kinds of things give me hope.</p>
<p>I had this insight the other day.</p>
<p>I walked through all of these giant redwoods,</p>
<p>which were almost all cut.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very far from here,</p>
<p>just half an hour straight west of where we are now.</p>
<p>You end up in redwood country.</p>
<p>And I had this idea that they&rsquo;re growing back now,</p>
<p>and every year they add how many cubic miles of wood,</p>
<p>if you count California as a whole.</p>
<p>But not only that, the roots are all old growth,</p>
<p>if you think about it.</p>
<p>These are re-sprouting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not from seeds.</p>
<p>These are re-sprouting,</p>
<p>so they have this tremendous resource underground</p>
<p>that even the loggers couldn&rsquo;t kill, right?</p>
<p>And so from these stumps,</p>
<p>you get what are called fairy rings,</p>
<p>which are like five trees coming in a ring around it,</p>
<p>each one competing to be the successor.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve seen this story before,</p>
<p>and they know to re-sprout.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is a very hopeful thing,</p>
<p>is that the roots are old growth,</p>
<p>and hopefully in 100, 200, 300 years,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t peak until around 1,000 years from now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get these restoration</p>
<p>of all of this magnificent old growth.</p>
<p>But so many other things give me hope.</p>
<p>We have to have hope,</p>
<p>and I think that if the world is infinite,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s infinitely many ways for it to become fixed.</p>
<p>I mean, we have some problems that need to be fixed,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re fixable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really beautifully put.</p>
<p>That is a really hopeful idea</p>
<p>that nature, that life, even human civilization</p>
<p>is resilient to all the mistakes we make.</p>
<p>So the roots are there.</p>
<p>So it outlives us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s patient with our adolescent fuck-ups.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re a thin layer on the crust.</p>
<p>And eventually the Earth will be swallowed by the sun,</p>
<p>and humans will have long gone extinct by then.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s all kinds of grounds for hope.</p>
<p>So us being a thin layer of crust,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of this layer?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of human existence?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Well, I think it depends who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking to a raccoon, it might be one thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking to an old growth tree,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making sure you&rsquo;re straight up, upright,</p>
<p>and not on a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Or a fish.</p>
<p>Yeah, a fish.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;re trying to avoid the hook, right?</p>
<p>No fish ever, when they take the bait,</p>
<p>no fish in the world has ever said, I hope I get hooked.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the problems with tobacco,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s all this bait and people get hooked.</p>
<p>But the fish don&rsquo;t have heads.</p>
<p>We have heads.</p>
<p>One of the great innovations in the history of humanity,</p>
<p>going back way pre-human, is the invention of the head,</p>
<p>the mobile head that turns and sees.</p>
<p>You know, and the fish didn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>You know, they didn&rsquo;t have hands.</p>
<p>The octopus have cool stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about the head.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, the octopus,</p>
<p>basically they&rsquo;ve got brains in their fingers.</p>
<p>And maybe brains is not even that good of an invention</p>
<p>in the long arc of history.</p>
<p>Because the fish maybe got it right.</p>
<p>Stay in the ocean.</p>
<p>Well, of course, we evolved from fish, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we moved on.</p>
<p>Is there a why to this?</p>
<p>Or is it just the way, it&rsquo;s like the current.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like these pockets of interesting complexity</p>
<p>pops up, like Allah showing up on a rock.</p>
<p>This is what human civilization is.</p>
<p>This weird little thing that showed up on a rock.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll disappear.</p>
<p>Well, we are probably the most remarkable creation</p>
<p>that nature has ever belched forward.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably the only one,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t count the KT meteorite</p>
<p>that almost destroyed the Earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only ones that really have the capacity</p>
<p>to destroy the Earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the meteorite</p>
<p>that wiped out everything bigger than four feet long.</p>
<p>You know, the Mount Everest size meteorite</p>
<p>that hit the Earth 66 million years ago</p>
<p>and destroyed most species in the water and on land.</p>
<p>There could have been some smart folks around then, too.</p>
<p>Well, actually, one thing I like to think about</p>
<p>is that 232.3 million years ago</p>
<p>and 232.4 million years ago, that&rsquo;s 100,000 years.</p>
<p>That tiniest of a sliver,</p>
<p>maybe a millimeter in most parts of the Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough time for a species of dinosaur</p>
<p>to become intelligent, build a civilization,</p>
<p>and go extinct with no traces.</p>
<p>And maybe that happened.</p>
<p>Our ignorance can fully engulf the fact that that happened.</p>
<p>Oh, the beautiful self-importance of us humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget that multiple intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>could have lived on Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible and gone extinct.</p>
<p>Or even life may have evolved more than once.</p>
<p>Not only that, but proto-life may still exist</p>
<p>and we are not even looking for it.</p>
<p>You know, some type of clay that became life</p>
<p>may still exist and people&hellip;</p>
<p>One thing I like to think about is always</p>
<p>what is the before time that is now?</p>
<p>I remember lecturing about this right before COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, what is the our world now</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll say, what was it like to be then before?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the world we live in.</p>
<p>We live in a before time for something</p>
<p>we really can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>Probably physical, you know.</p>
<p>Appendages.</p>
<p>And being in person, being able to touch each other</p>
<p>or wanting to touch each other</p>
<p>versus being in the digital world, right?</p>
<p>This whole idea of the metaverse</p>
<p>and more and more moving into a digital space.</p>
<p>What was it like being born before most of your life</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t on the computer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty damn good for the record,</p>
<p>but maybe I don&rsquo;t know the alternative.</p>
<p>Robert, this is a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking us through some dark periods</p>
<p>of human history, but I think they contain</p>
<p>a lot of lessons for today.</p>
<p>That science is often inextricably connected</p>
<p>to our values, to our ethics, to our politics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something we have to contend with.</p>
<p>So your work is really important</p>
<p>and thank you for shining a light on it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Robert Proctor.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
