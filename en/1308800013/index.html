    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>About a year before we got involved with Darlene&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>her family worked with a private investigator, Patrick Zirpoli,</p>
<p>who goes by Zip to those who know him.</p>
<p>Zip spent his career with the Pennsylvania State Police.</p>
<p>He retired in 2015 as a corporal and the unit supervisor</p>
<p>of the Criminal Investigation Assessment Unit.</p>
<p>One of his specialties is cold case homicide investigations,</p>
<p>and after retirement, he&rsquo;s gone on to consult in cold cases.</p>
<p>Zip had the opportunity to review Darlene&rsquo;s case file,</p>
<p>and he honed in on a particular person of interest.</p>
<p>He cannot be ruled out as a suspect.</p>
<p>When you look at means, motive, and method, and opportunity,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy who stands up above everyone else.</p>
<p>This is Episode 12, P.I.&rsquo;s Best Lead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not using the real name of Zip&rsquo;s P.O.I. for legal reasons,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to call him Daryl Lemon.</p>
<p>Daryl first came on the radar for police back in January 1985</p>
<p>via a tip from a woman named Darlene.</p>
<p>Daryl first came on the radar for police back in January 1985</p>
<p>via a tip from a woman named Dolores who worked at Young Door.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same manufacturing company in Plymouth where Ron Hulse worked.</p>
<p>Dolores told police that during the summer of 1984,</p>
<p>Daryl had been in Argus under quote-unquote peculiar circumstances,</p>
<p>and he had been staying at a home on 15 B Road</p>
<p>just northeast of the Hulse home.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been staying with them for a couple of months</p>
<p>before taking off in either October or November</p>
<p>and then moving to Arizona.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much follow-up on this tip,</p>
<p>just a note that I can find about Daryl having brown hair,</p>
<p>not blonde like the suspect,</p>
<p>so maybe that&rsquo;s how they determined that this tip</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t warrant any further action.</p>
<p>But almost a year later in December 1985,</p>
<p>Marshall County dispatchers got a call saying that</p>
<p>a detective needed to contact Ron Hulse ASAP.</p>
<p>Sergeant Yocolette called Ron right away</p>
<p>and Ron said that he had just gotten a call from his brother Randy</p>
<p>who had gotten a call from another woman</p>
<p>saying that she had information about Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Now the woman said that she knew a man who was in a motorcycle gang</p>
<p>and that he killed Darlene.</p>
<p>The woman told Randy that she was afraid to report this</p>
<p>the information directly to law enforcement</p>
<p>because she was scared of the gang.</p>
<p>The woman said that she even knew where the murder weapon</p>
<p>or the suspect car could be found.</p>
<p>So at this point, we&rsquo;re talking almost a year and a half</p>
<p>after Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>This was a pretty exciting potential lead at the time</p>
<p>when all other leads had dried up.</p>
<p>But it was born out of a confusing game of telephone.</p>
<p>By the time it got to police,</p>
<p>it was like four sources removed.</p>
<p>Now Ron&rsquo;s brother Randy knew the name of the woman who called him</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t want to share her name because she was scared</p>
<p>but also because she claimed she wasn&rsquo;t the direct informant</p>
<p>because she had actually heard this information from a friend of hers.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re like five people removed.</p>
<p>So Sergeant Yocolette contacted Randy Hulse directly</p>
<p>to cut out at least one middle person.</p>
<p>And Randy had enough information to get them going.</p>
<p>He told them that the guy everyone is talking about</p>
<p>is a man named Daryl Lemon.</p>
<p>And the people that he was staying with,</p>
<p>the ones who started this chain of information,</p>
<p>were Larry and Bonnie Berger.</p>
<p>Maybe because the case had stalled out</p>
<p>or maybe because of how the information reached Sergeant Yocolette,</p>
<p>this time there was documented follow-up</p>
<p>of him sitting down with the Bergers.</p>
<p>Larry Berger told Sergeant Yocolette that, yes,</p>
<p>his former friend Daryl Lemon had been a house guest of theirs</p>
<p>in Argus during the summer of 1984,</p>
<p>specifically from July to early October.</p>
<p>Larry described Daryl as slim, tall, with blue eyes and brown hair.</p>
<p>When Sergeant Yocolette asked Larry and his wife</p>
<p>if they could recall what Daryl was up to on August 17th, 1984,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t account for all of his movements that day</p>
<p>because Larry said that he&rsquo;d been at work until the evening</p>
<p>and Bonnie had been running errands in the critical window of time</p>
<p>when Darlene was attacked.</p>
<p>Specifically, Bonnie Berger said that she went to Rochester</p>
<p>around 9 that morning to shop and then she got back at around 10.30.</p>
<p>But she remembered so clearly, even a year and a half later,</p>
<p>because on her way home she was driving north toward Argus</p>
<p>and she saw all of the police activity on State Road 110.</p>
<p>She said at the time she had been driving their four-door,</p>
<p>light green 1970s Plymouth Satellite,</p>
<p>a car that closely matches the suspect car police had still yet to locate.</p>
<p>Apparently, Daryl had borrowed that car quite a bit</p>
<p>while he was staying with the Bergers.</p>
<p>But Bonnie was certain she was the one that had the green car</p>
<p>the morning of the homicide.</p>
<p>And Bonnie was also certain that Daryl was at their house</p>
<p>when she returned home that morning at 10.30.</p>
<p>Before the interview wrapped up, Sergeant Yokelet asked the Bergers</p>
<p>if they thought Daryl would have been capable of murder.</p>
<p>And they both said yes.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Yokelet was already pretty convinced</p>
<p>Daryl didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with Darlene&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>mostly because Bonnie said that he didn&rsquo;t have the green car that day.</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>Until about a month later, in January 1986,</p>
<p>when Larry Berger called Sergeant Yokelet</p>
<p>and he said he had some more information to provide now.</p>
<p>You see, Larry and Bonnie had since moved to Chicago.</p>
<p>So Sergeant Yokelet and another officer</p>
<p>drove up to interview them immediately.</p>
<p>The Bergers told police that they had known Daryl Lemon for years</p>
<p>because he was originally from Indiana.</p>
<p>They said that Daryl was a member of a motorcycle gang from Arizona</p>
<p>and that in October 1984, Larry had tried to kick Daryl out of their house</p>
<p>because he was trying to manipulate them.</p>
<p>Larry said during that summer,</p>
<p>Daryl was trying to drive a wedge between him and his wife Bonnie,</p>
<p>and he was trying to convince them to move to Arizona with him.</p>
<p>They were all getting high a lot,</p>
<p>and apparently Daryl gained so much control over the couple</p>
<p>that they signed over their bank accounts to him</p>
<p>so he had free access to their money.</p>
<p>Bonnie also came clean about her suspicions</p>
<p>from the day Darlene was abducted.</p>
<p>She said that her story before about going to the store in Rochester</p>
<p>was mostly true, but her timeline was off.</p>
<p>And this time around, her story got a lot more detail.</p>
<p>Bonnie said when she left that morning, Larry was already at work,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s pretty sure Daryl was asleep in his sleeping bag on the floor,</p>
<p>but she can&rsquo;t say for sure.</p>
<p>She said that when she left that morning,</p>
<p>which she puts at around 8 a.m., well before Darlene&rsquo;s attack,</p>
<p>she remembered looking at the Hulse&rsquo;s house when she passed by it.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t say she saw anything,</p>
<p>just makes it a point to say that the house drew her attention</p>
<p>and she looked at it even though it, quote,</p>
<p>had no significance to her at the time, end quote.</p>
<p>On her way back from Rochester in the green car,</p>
<p>Bonnie said she saw the police near the Hulse home,</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t go straight home.</p>
<p>In this version of her story, she says instead,</p>
<p>she went to her mom&rsquo;s realty office in Argus</p>
<p>and told her mom that she was worried Daryl had done something bad.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t get back to her house until 3.30 that afternoon,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when she saw Daryl was there.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where the Burgers story gets really weird.</p>
<p>They told Yocolette that Daryl always carried a Bible with him</p>
<p>and would quote from it,</p>
<p>but they said that he wasn&rsquo;t a church-going guy,</p>
<p>and they said Daryl kept telling Bonnie about a quote-unquote</p>
<p>black market for babies that he had connections to,</p>
<p>and he kept saying that they could sell Larry and Bonnie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blonde-headed blue-eyed children and make a huge profit.</p>
<p>Larry said when Daryl was in Indiana,</p>
<p>he would make a point to dress like a clean-cut businessman</p>
<p>because he was paranoid of police.</p>
<p>Larry said one time after the Hulse murder,</p>
<p>he and Daryl were driving around Southern Marshall County</p>
<p>and Daryl became very nervous when they got close to the intersection</p>
<p>where the Hulse home was.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, they said there was this other weird thing.</p>
<p>During the months that he was staying with them,</p>
<p>Daryl would act weird at night,</p>
<p>and he would ask them to drive him around the back roads,</p>
<p>like no particular destination in mind,</p>
<p>just aimlessly drive off the beaten path for like hours at a time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking 11 p.m. until the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>At one point in October of 1984,</p>
<p>Daryl tried to get Bonnie to leave Larry and move with him to Arizona,</p>
<p>which was the last straw for Larry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he kicked Daryl out.</p>
<p>The Burgers said that before,</p>
<p>they had been scared to reveal all of this information about Daryl</p>
<p>because they were scared of him.</p>
<p>But after thinking about it for a while,</p>
<p>they definitely thought Daryl had been involved in Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>This was a bombshell.</p>
<p>But could they prove it?</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>Though they did say all of his actions after the murder</p>
<p>seemed like that of a guilty man.</p>
<p>Like they said he started growing a mustache and beard after the homicide,</p>
<p>which seemed sus,</p>
<p>and Bonnie said all of a sudden a pair of his pants went missing</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t cycling through their laundry anymore.</p>
<p>Daryl also became violent and even physically hurt their children</p>
<p>a few times after Darlene&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And they said he wouldn&rsquo;t go out during the day, only at night.</p>
<p>Larry said he became so certain that they had a killer living with them</p>
<p>that at one point he even went out and searched behind their house</p>
<p>for the missing fireplace poker.</p>
<p>He and a friend dug up a 55-gallon drum in the woods behind his house</p>
<p>looking for it.</p>
<p>And yeah, same reaction as you.</p>
<p>The cops were like,</p>
<p>hell, did you have a 55-gallon drum buried behind your house?</p>
<p>But Larry said, oh no, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, that&rsquo;s just where we kept marijuana</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t find any weapon anyway.</p>
<p>Before the officers left Chicago,</p>
<p>the Burgers said they also believed that Daryl stole their motorcycle</p>
<p>and they had filed a report with the local police about it.</p>
<p>The Burgers also let them look at their old green car,</p>
<p>which they still had,</p>
<p>but a cursory glance didn&rsquo;t reveal any bloodstains</p>
<p>or anything else suspicious.</p>
<p>So it seems like the police didn&rsquo;t take the vehicle with them</p>
<p>or do any formal testing.</p>
<p>On the ride back to Indiana,</p>
<p>the officers discussed what they&rsquo;d learned about Daryl Lemon from the Burgers</p>
<p>and they agreed that the couple didn&rsquo;t seem trustworthy.</p>
<p>It seemed like Bonnie was still hiding something from them</p>
<p>and to them it was more likely that the Burgers just wanted revenge on Daryl</p>
<p>for possibly stealing their motorcycle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the Daryl Lemon leads seemed to stop.</p>
<p>And if Daryl was involved in trafficking children,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t his motive to go to the Holst home have been the girls rather than Darlene?</p>
<p>From the record searches we conducted,</p>
<p>Daryl also doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any type of criminal history</p>
<p>outside of some drug-related crimes.</p>
<p>But Zip wasn&rsquo;t put off by the same things we were.</p>
<p>He told us this guy had all the behavioral characteristics of a murder suspect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let him explain.</p>
<p>After looking at everything, looking at the motive of the crime,</p>
<p>how the crime was committed, his post-crime behavior,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy that you have to deal with before you can move forward.</p>
<p>Either it&rsquo;s him or it&rsquo;s not him, but they have to make that decision.</p>
<p>Before the incident occurs, he&rsquo;s doing a lot of strange things.</p>
<p>Like, I always look for those people who are roaming around at night.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s having the people he&rsquo;s living with drive him around at night.</p>
<p>He acts very suspicious there.</p>
<p>Plus he has access to a vehicle that is almost described exactly as the vehicle that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting when you read the report,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different people who are saying he has that vehicle that day of the incident occurring.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some confusion to that, but I think he has a lot of control,</p>
<p>again, power and control and being manipulative,</p>
<p>over the people that he&rsquo;s living with, over these burglars.</p>
<p>Zip thinks Daryl could have wanted to cruise the backroads at night</p>
<p>to stake out houses in different areas.</p>
<p>You know, with someone from the area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your wandering psychopath who just is wandering through the area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone from the area.</p>
<p>And like I always tell people, like when you, again, bigger picture here,</p>
<p>whoever did this knew the area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they knew where to then, here&rsquo;s a remote and place the dumper body.</p>
<p>And what to me is very interesting is that the female burglar makes a comment</p>
<p>that she drove past the Hulse residence the morning of this happening</p>
<p>with the vehicle that matches the description of the vehicle that was in the driveway.</p>
<p>Well, why are you putting yourself there?</p>
<p>Why are you even making that comment?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to a third party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even to the police.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>And then, you know, his kind of manipulative power and control behavior fits the crime scene.</p>
<p>It fits the person who committed the crime.</p>
<p>And then afterwards, that&rsquo;s even amplified even more,</p>
<p>where he starts taking more control over the burglars</p>
<p>and more control, like, of their finances.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s having them ship stuff to Arizona because he wants them to come down here and live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reported that he changes his appearance,</p>
<p>which is a big piece of this that, you know, why all of a sudden change your appearance?</p>
<p>And, you know, and after this crime is committed again,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s another red flag that you see there.</p>
<p>Zip also thinks that even though robbery wasn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a motive,</p>
<p>and even though Ron said nothing was taken from the house,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear by the suspects police did have early on that police&rsquo;s theory was a robbery gone wrong.</p>
<p>And Zip really believed that if they wouldn&rsquo;t have chased that motive from the get-go,</p>
<p>that this could have been solved a long time ago.</p>
<p>This is not a multiple-person crime.</p>
<p>Like, if two people did this, like one drove and one went in there and did this,</p>
<p>this would have been solved because one of them would have talked.</p>
<p>You know, this is that one-person crime.</p>
<p>And I think the problem is they missed the motive from the beginning.</p>
<p>They missed the lie from the beginning.</p>
<p>And when you miss that, it leads you in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re trying to play catch-up so many years later to,</p>
<p>and again, you know, people are deceased now.</p>
<p>Time is, you know, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, you know, you&rsquo;re never going to get that back again.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s try to figure out how to solve the case, you know,</p>
<p>using new technology that we have today.</p>
<p>Zip&rsquo;s theory of motive actually fits what most people agree on today,</p>
<p>that the crime was sexually motivated, but it didn&rsquo;t go as planned.</p>
<p>The consensus now is that Darlene&rsquo;s murder wasn&rsquo;t premeditated.</p>
<p>If the killer would speak, he&rsquo;d probably tell you she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to die.</p>
<p>Do you think that the person who killed Darlene went on to commit other violent crimes?</p>
<p>Because of why he did it, it might not be violent homicide.</p>
<p>It could be, you know, domestic violence being abusive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that power and control piece.</p>
<p>I think the homicide came out of anger, because he couldn&rsquo;t control the victim.</p>
<p>And he tried to control her, but he went too far and killed her.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to have some of those power and control behaviors</p>
<p>and power and control crimes might not be homicide.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know, if, like a lot of people,</p>
<p>like this is how we get our serial killers and sexual sadists,</p>
<p>who get excited from that homicide.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s a person who&rsquo;s like, I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen,</p>
<p>he might never see anything of it again, you know.</p>
<p>And in this case, I think it was just trying to control her.</p>
<p>And he ended up hitting her, not realizing that he killed her</p>
<p>until he gets her to where her body&rsquo;s dumped.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>And just kind of dumps her and goes on from there.</p>
<p>We tried reaching Daryl for comment.</p>
<p>We found a few numbers for him in Arizona,</p>
<p>and we messaged him on Facebook, but never heard back.</p>
<p>We also tried a dozen different numbers,</p>
<p>trying to track down Larry and Bonnie.</p>
<p>Most of them were disconnected,</p>
<p>or we were told that we had the wrong number.</p>
<p>A few of them went to voicemail, so we left messages.</p>
<p>Now, we didn&rsquo;t get any calls back,</p>
<p>but one of the numbers did text us back, saying,</p>
<p>I am in no relation to Larry Berger,</p>
<p>but after doing some research,</p>
<p>I learned that Mr. Berger had unfortunately passed</p>
<p>on the 17th of May, 2022.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking,</p>
<p>what case are you working on?</p>
<p>Emily dodged that question about the case</p>
<p>and just asked if they knew that their number</p>
<p>was on several different websites</p>
<p>as being associated with Larry Berger.</p>
<p>But whoever was on the other end</p>
<p>just said that they didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and that was the end of that conversation.</p>
<p>Now, there is an obit for A. Larry Berger from May, 2022,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just one sentence,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t help us confirm if it&rsquo;s the same guy.</p>
<p>Bonnie, on the other hand, she has a new last name now,</p>
<p>and we found four numbers for her,</p>
<p>but they were all dead ends.</p>
<p>So, Bonnie, if you&rsquo;re listening, call us back.</p>
<p>When we asked Prosecutor Nelson Shipman about Darrell Lemon,</p>
<p>he said that it made him uncomfortable</p>
<p>talking about him in case he&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>and it made him uncomfortable talking about him</p>
<p>in case he&rsquo;s innocent.</p>
<p>We asked him if he was ever interviewed by police</p>
<p>in the Hulls case,</p>
<p>and he gave a weird answer.</p>
<p>I think one of them was,</p>
<p>but nothing came of it.</p>
<p>One of them?</p>
<p>Nelson wouldn&rsquo;t go into more detail</p>
<p>about what he meant by one of them.</p>
<p>Did he mean Larry and Darrell?</p>
<p>Someone else connected to Darrell?</p>
<p>From the context of the rest of our conversation,</p>
<p>the best we can piece together</p>
<p>is that he maybe meant a family member of Darrell&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t give a name.</p>
<p>And then he moved on, making mention of how close</p>
<p>Darrell&rsquo;s family lived to Darlene,</p>
<p>which, again, made us scratch our heads</p>
<p>because Darrell Lemon didn&rsquo;t live anywhere near Darlene.</p>
<p>He was staying with the Burgers, who lived nearby,</p>
<p>but the location of where Nelson was pointing to</p>
<p>was in the opposite direction of where the Burgers lived.</p>
<p>Specifically, Nelson was pointing to a property</p>
<p>west of Darlene&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>It was that same property that he had pointed out</p>
<p>to Emily on their ride-along</p>
<p>the very first time they met,</p>
<p>that same property with the lure</p>
<p>of the buried bus in the yard,</p>
<p>the bus where Nelson said he had dreams</p>
<p>about finding the fireplace poker.</p>
<p>Now, we knew about the buried 55-gallon drum</p>
<p>behind the Burgers&rsquo; place,</p>
<p>but surely that&rsquo;s not what everyone is confusing with a bus.</p>
<p>Nothing was adding up.</p>
<p>So, to try and make sense of all of it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting down with Nelson</p>
<p>in his conference room back in November,</p>
<p>and so we bring up Darrell again.</p>
<p>And Nelson says something about him being dead.</p>
<p>And we knew Darrell was still alive and living in Arizona,</p>
<p>so we pressed, and Nelson walks over to this whiteboard,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s this huge piece of white paper</p>
<p>covering something up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s behind the paper up there?</p>
<p>Can you peek behind the paper?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nelson takes off his mic, lifts up the paper,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something that looks like a family tree,</p>
<p>maybe with some photos and initials</p>
<p>written in little boxes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s like, yeah, Darrell died,</p>
<p>and then he puts the paper back down.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some kind of connection?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Any idea.</p>
<p>You know, I despise that expression.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>You have some idea.</p>
<p>Well, as far as this goes, not really.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lot harder to research</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t have much of a criminal history.</p>
<p>He has a little bit, but there&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>It seems like most of it was after.</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>If there is a connection,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s brought it together</p>
<p>to even, you know, even go to the next sentence</p>
<p>about, oh, yeah, there&rsquo;s something to look at here.</p>
<p>We tried to get Nelson to let us take a closer look</p>
<p>under the paper on the whiteboard before we left,</p>
<p>but another meeting was about to start in the conference room</p>
<p>and we were being told to leave.</p>
<p>But I just couldn&rsquo;t let it go.</p>
<p>I was certain from the little bit I&rsquo;d seen</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t Daryl Lemon&rsquo;s family on that board.</p>
<p>And I was right.</p>
<p>Some Internet sleuthing using the names and initials</p>
<p>that I was able to see led me to a completely different family,</p>
<p>one that I&rsquo;ll call the Parsons.</p>
<p>So between that meeting and meeting back up with Emily for lunch,</p>
<p>I am frantically looking up what I can about this family,</p>
<p>specifically these four brothers who grew up in Arcus</p>
<p>and would have been in their 20s at the time of Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And listen, you guys, I was literally shaking,</p>
<p>99% from excitement for what I was finding</p>
<p>and 1% because I thought Emily might kill me when I tell her,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ve been working on this for a year</p>
<p>and everything was going in kind of one direction,</p>
<p>but we got to pivot.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s as deep in as I am</p>
<p>and she was just as excited about this new possibility</p>
<p>because for us, it&rsquo;s not about proving a theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about finding the truth.</p>
<p>And speaking of truth,</p>
<p>Emily and I were left with one giant question after we debriefed.</p>
<p>Had Nelson been lying to us?</p>
<p>I mean, the more innocent explanation is that maybe he&rsquo;s confused.</p>
<p>A few of the sons in the Parsons family</p>
<p>have the same names as members of the Lemon family,</p>
<p>so maybe that was the mix-up.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s more than an innocent mix-up</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t just one slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t confuse the names once in passing.</p>
<p>We had talked over and over about the Lemons.</p>
<p>And again, that very first meeting Emily had with Nelson</p>
<p>where he offered to give her a ride-along around town,</p>
<p>it was him who pointed out what he said was the Lemon property.</p>
<p>So was the guy in charge really that turned around</p>
<p>or was he intentionally trying to throw us off?</p>
<p>At that point, I was kind of done taking his word for things.</p>
<p>So I had Emily look up the property records</p>
<p>for this mythical bus property in Nelson&rsquo;s infamous triangle.</p>
<p>And sure enough, the buried bus property that Nelson was pointing to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Parsons.</p>
<p>When we started digging into this new lead,</p>
<p>we found more than just a buried bus.</p>
<p>We track Nelson down again for an explanation</p>
<p>and investigate brand-new people next in Episode 13,</p>
<p>Untangling Misinformation.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
