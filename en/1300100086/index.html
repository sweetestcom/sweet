<p>whatever bitches sold out anyway holla</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called winning</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just starting to feel the edible</p>
<p>right about kicking in now are you tommy creep</p>
<p>creep it&rsquo;s creeping on up</p>
<p>from behind yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nervous feeling the</p>
<p>first time you ever do the breast trip on the plane</p>
<p>or a cookie or whatever what</p>
<p>you know the one time that the</p>
<p>first time that i dosed you up</p>
<p>where were we headed to dude we were headed to tampa</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to tampa</p>
<p>and i i you&rsquo;re like yeah</p>
<p>you like it you take</p>
<p>a little bit</p>
<p>and i was gripping onto the</p>
<p>to the fucking armrest</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>all the fucked up things i&rsquo;ve done in my life</p>
<p>and i was just like</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m just a bad bad person</p>
<p>i was ready to cry</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real psychic</p>
<p>cleaning you know it really does open up your</p>
<p>your psychic closet</p>
<p>and just start pulling shit out and dusting it off</p>
<p>you know a real good</p>
<p>pot brownie you know i was listening to</p>
<p>terrence mckenna talk</p>
<p>about eating pot that you know a lot of the</p>
<p>early hindu texts you know</p>
<p>dealt with eating marijuana and that</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>like for a lot of them like that was like a really</p>
<p>psychedelic experience like</p>
<p>just as psychedelic as mushrooms you just gotta eat it</p>
<p>you gotta eat a lot of it yeah you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize man if you don&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;re not used to it</p>
<p>eating marijuana we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this on</p>
<p>the podcast a hundred times but for people who</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard this</p>
<p>it creates a totally different</p>
<p>chemical when you eat it called 11 hydroxy metabolite</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s processed by your liver</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s four to five times more psychoactive than</p>
<p>thc it&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>stronger drug so</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s perfect for a plane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s like look you&rsquo;re vulnerable</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the seat</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going anywhere</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>space you&rsquo;re 30 000 feet above the</p>
<p>earth you know</p>
<p>if something goes</p>
<p>wrong you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>so you feel that vulnerability too</p>
<p>and then when you get hit with that pot</p>
<p>edible oh goodness especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>expecting it</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a surprise it&rsquo;s a new ride man</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>oh this will just be like any other time</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>that shit straight up grabs you by the</p>
<p>chest and is like i&rsquo;m fucking here</p>
<p>it scares you</p>
<p>i was terrified i think</p>
<p>i wanna like i really was</p>
<p>freaking out but when it was over i was i actually did</p>
<p>think like that was a good thing</p>
<p>just happened yes</p>
<p>i always feel like that</p>
<p>after the hardest</p>
<p>craziest strangest trips</p>
<p>where i get the most scared and i feel</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all shitty</p>
<p>about my life</p>
<p>or about things i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve done when i was like 13</p>
<p>my god damn it the old</p>
<p>stuff yeah why am i</p>
<p>still dwelling on this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not doing that anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the drawer</p>
<p>somewhere in there</p>
<p>yeah you gotta</p>
<p>clean it out but</p>
<p>these experiences</p>
<p>these plane</p>
<p>you know anytime you eat pot really</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to do it on a</p>
<p>plane i mean pot</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>where you are</p>
<p>if you eat a really</p>
<p>strong brownie</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll really like</p>
<p>expose you to your vulnerabilities</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel all fleshy</p>
<p>and you feel like real soft and easy to break</p>
<p>yes you know extremely fragile</p>
<p>yeah yeah like shaken fragile</p>
<p>like you just saw a fire or something</p>
<p>and there was animals inside and you&rsquo;re traumatized</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so fucked up in amsterdam they stopped selling</p>
<p>brownies and cookies and shit at</p>
<p>the coffee shops</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know too</p>
<p>many people get fucked up and they can&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>they stopped</p>
<p>making mushrooms legally or two unfortunately</p>
<p>but pot and</p>
<p>brownies are just as</p>
<p>bad man you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of like somebody</p>
<p>calling you out on your shit</p>
<p>for something that you did do like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect them to call</p>
<p>you out on yeah and then you know like how that feels</p>
<p>when that when that&rsquo;s happened to me</p>
<p>you feel that in your core</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s kind of an</p>
<p>awful feeling</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>after the awful feeling comes relief</p>
<p>yes we were like well now it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>yeah the thing that i was</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>right at least</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s cleansing</p>
<p>it is like cleansing</p>
<p>yeah well you know i mean people have this ability to</p>
<p>block out certain parts of</p>
<p>their behavior and personality</p>
<p>and yeah that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>idiots you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we love calling people we were just making fun of</p>
<p>steve harvey</p>
<p>on the way up here and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so full of shit</p>
<p>and not just full of shit but</p>
<p>hilariously stupid</p>
<p>like some of the shit that he says is just so dumb</p>
<p>that i save his tweets</p>
<p>and we were just reading them</p>
<p>and then we watched</p>
<p>katt williams</p>
<p>dissect him</p>
<p>katt williams</p>
<p>did a show with</p>
<p>them and just</p>
<p>just destroyed him</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>well what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny about that is</p>
<p>cause you know</p>
<p>steve harvey</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t check himself</p>
<p>steve harvey really</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker he really</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s amazing he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>messiah yeah</p>
<p>i see him he goes on religious channels and i</p>
<p>watch i watch those</p>
<p>videos of him</p>
<p>on like the</p>
<p>televangelist</p>
<p>or the trinity broadcast network that&rsquo;s what is tbn</p>
<p>he actually did a comedy special for</p>
<p>tbn that&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s got to be the best ever</p>
<p>you need god</p>
<p>in your life you ain&rsquo;t got god in the love you are</p>
<p>silly person</p>
<p>really gonna be moving</p>
<p>in so many ways how much</p>
<p>would you love to give</p>
<p>steve harvey a big fat pot</p>
<p>brownie and just</p>
<p>watch him cry</p>
<p>that would be the most amazing thing yeah</p>
<p>incredible yeah i</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>he was he was on the trinity broadcast network talking</p>
<p>about people who don&rsquo;t believe in god</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t believe in god you&rsquo;re silly</p>
<p>i ain&rsquo;t got nothing</p>
<p>to say to you you silly</p>
<p>great bed yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i feel about</p>
<p>everything that steve harvey says on stage</p>
<p>none of it&rsquo;s actually even a joke like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>special that i saw</p>
<p>i saw it on like tv like i</p>
<p>think it was about a year ago</p>
<p>or he would just</p>
<p>he would just recap news stories</p>
<p>and that was the bit</p>
<p>like he was just reading headlines you know like</p>
<p>like the lady driving</p>
<p>across texas wearing her diaper</p>
<p>he just said</p>
<p>do you believe this woman</p>
<p>drove across texas in a diaper</p>
<p>and then shook his head like hell no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole bit and then like that</p>
<p>the audience</p>
<p>would fall out of their seat and he was like</p>
<p>on the next door then i read a</p>
<p>story about a man like what the fuck happened with</p>
<p>when i first saw him i</p>
<p>first saw him</p>
<p>in nineteen ninety four when i was doing the</p>
<p>montreal comedy festival</p>
<p>and he was as well</p>
<p>and he went on</p>
<p>stage and i was like this guy</p>
<p>should be paying richard</p>
<p>prior 50 of</p>
<p>everything he makes</p>
<p>cause he was like doing a</p>
<p>prior impression on</p>
<p>stage he was</p>
<p>doing richard</p>
<p>prior on stage</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t they know what</p>
<p>first of all he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>black they&rsquo;re canadian they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be nice</p>
<p>yeah you know but</p>
<p>but i was watching</p>
<p>and i was like wow i was like this guy like a fucking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a like</p>
<p>sort of like</p>
<p>not a cover band but like</p>
<p>a guy doing an ac dc</p>
<p>impression that singing his own songs you know</p>
<p>that a lot so i</p>
<p>think in every</p>
<p>generation right you see</p>
<p>yes somebody doing you see a few</p>
<p>hotels you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the early guys</p>
<p>i did that a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>where i had to</p>
<p>catch myself when i was</p>
<p>starting out</p>
<p>when i was an open mic or i caught myself on stage</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll never i was</p>
<p>sounding exactly like richard jenny</p>
<p>i was doing is rhythm</p>
<p>his cadence and i was a richard jenny fan</p>
<p>so it kind of made</p>
<p>sense but i was like wow like this is</p>
<p>gross like i&rsquo;m hearing myself</p>
<p>sounding just like it</p>
<p>you know when people say it to you too but</p>
<p>they no nobody</p>
<p>said it to me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard people said to me sam kennison when i was</p>
<p>starting out to</p>
<p>which i definitely was</p>
<p>influenced by him too</p>
<p>but you know when i</p>
<p>first saw bill hicks</p>
<p>he was like doing sam kennison</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where i was like</p>
<p>uncomfortable with it</p>
<p>like doing the</p>
<p>noises that sam makes and talking like sam really</p>
<p>yeah well he was really</p>
<p>influenced by kennison as well</p>
<p>and kennison was fucking huge at the time</p>
<p>and hicks was</p>
<p>really just</p>
<p>starting to be</p>
<p>known in the comedy</p>
<p>world and he</p>
<p>never really got huge</p>
<p>in mainstream in america</p>
<p>even to this day you say bill hickson</p>
<p>you know only</p>
<p>the cool insiders know</p>
<p>who really who he is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like saying bill cosby or something no</p>
<p>but back then he was really really unknown</p>
<p>and i went to see him at the comedy connection</p>
<p>and it was a really</p>
<p>small crowd and you know he was</p>
<p>yeah it was doing</p>
<p>kennison man</p>
<p>i mean for real parts of his act were like you know</p>
<p>that it was doing that</p>
<p>that the like the</p>
<p>demon he&rsquo;s a demon</p>
<p>like i was yeah</p>
<p>yeah i was like sam it was like doing sam</p>
<p>you know but that&rsquo;s normal you know</p>
<p>comics are influenced by</p>
<p>other comics i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken guys on the road with me too</p>
<p>and saw them</p>
<p>starting to talk like me and</p>
<p>sound like me</p>
<p>which is real weird yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s normal man it&rsquo;s normal you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see somebody crushing</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll sort of imitate the</p>
<p>crushing you know</p>
<p>like mensia did that with me that was one of the</p>
<p>first things like</p>
<p>mensia never really</p>
<p>stole any of my jokes</p>
<p>cause he knew</p>
<p>i would fucking</p>
<p>slap him and</p>
<p>but he used to</p>
<p>steal them on</p>
<p>the road i used to hear stories on the road</p>
<p>about him stealing but he never</p>
<p>stole anything in</p>
<p>front of me in town</p>
<p>but what he did</p>
<p>start doing is delivering jokes like me and</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>sounding like me like</p>
<p>his cadence is</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>this motherfucker is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that was the only time it ever bothered me</p>
<p>you know other times i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen people do it and i was like wow it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>compliment you know someone</p>
<p>sounds like me you know</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s normal you know because comedy is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>weird thing to</p>
<p>learn anyway it&rsquo;s like and it&rsquo;s like your</p>
<p>speech and your cadence on</p>
<p>stage is kind of affected it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting on</p>
<p>a different sort of a</p>
<p>pattern of talking</p>
<p>so that you</p>
<p>could get your comedy across better</p>
<p>and then when you see someone who does it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really effective yeah you you automatically sort</p>
<p>of like internalize that you know i used to totally</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>first started who i</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say that i</p>
<p>sounded like and you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna think i&rsquo;m joking</p>
<p>ralphie may no chris rock</p>
<p>really yeah but i&rsquo;m not not to the point</p>
<p>where you say chris rock</p>
<p>you start imagining</p>
<p>the voice and</p>
<p>everything like</p>
<p>when i wouldn&rsquo;t do that but</p>
<p>i essentially</p>
<p>cause i was so obsessed with him</p>
<p>when i was like before i</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up this time</p>
<p>motherfucker talking over my podcast</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about your fucking service</p>
<p>where you flying</p>
<p>oh we love one</p>
<p>excuse me sir</p>
<p>you you you fucking</p>
<p>mumble mouth</p>
<p>motherfucker can&rsquo;t even barely understand this guy</p>
<p>magic&rsquo;s guys tell you something important oh</p>
<p>like that this isn&rsquo;t going well yeah excuse me</p>
<p>shut up shut your</p>
<p>shut your stupid hole</p>
<p>this whole system sucks the sound system sucks</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a mumbling prick anyway</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just i don&rsquo;t want to ruin this chris rock</p>
<p>story so i&rsquo;m just yapping over this till this</p>
<p>motor mouth motherfucker shuts his</p>
<p>pie hole here we go all right we&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>so but anyways i you know like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound like him but i didn&rsquo;t sound the voice but</p>
<p>i started to like</p>
<p>i would pace</p>
<p>how he paced really and i would i would crowd</p>
<p>now you didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>cause i mean this is i&rsquo;m talking like</p>
<p>first two years in</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like going what year</p>
<p>was this this would have been</p>
<p>two thousand and two and two thousand and three</p>
<p>and so he&rsquo;s massive right i mean</p>
<p>still is but you know at that point like</p>
<p>i started watching him</p>
<p>basically i</p>
<p>knew he was when i was a kid because he was on snl</p>
<p>but when that</p>
<p>bring the pain</p>
<p>came out in like ninety five or ninety six</p>
<p>i was in i think that&rsquo;s when it came out</p>
<p>that i was in high</p>
<p>school and i was like this that for me was amazing</p>
<p>that was amazing that special</p>
<p>grant like the guy was just he</p>
<p>blew my mind so</p>
<p>then bigger and</p>
<p>blacker came out when i was in college he was it</p>
<p>you shut the fuck up oh god</p>
<p>sorry folks</p>
<p>this is when you get podcasts on a plane</p>
<p>this is what you get it&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>so you know that it&rsquo;s authentic</p>
<p>because we could be pretending we</p>
<p>could be in my office right now</p>
<p>but you hear the</p>
<p>sound in the background that could just be a fan</p>
<p>we should do a</p>
<p>fake plane yes</p>
<p>we can do the airplane</p>
<p>sound app where it just makes a noise</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do announcements like this</p>
<p>is there an airplane sound app yeah</p>
<p>there is yeah yeah i have</p>
<p>i have a noise app so you can play it while you&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>phone call to pretend that you&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>plane call yes wow</p>
<p>why do you why</p>
<p>would you have it what is it for the noise that</p>
<p>so like if you want like if you hate to</p>
<p>sleep in silence you want</p>
<p>white noise</p>
<p>or radio airplane there&rsquo;s airplane noise yeah</p>
<p>wow so you can sleep on airplanes some people</p>
<p>sleep i guess people just like the noise of it yeah</p>
<p>all right so um two thousand two two thousand three</p>
<p>so you are your</p>
<p>you paste like him he was your favorite comedian</p>
<p>yes he was definitely my favorite comedian</p>
<p>cause i i loved like</p>
<p>i mean i love that he was</p>
<p>saying like breaking shit down i love that that element</p>
<p>of of comedy</p>
<p>yeah and i love the way he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s basically like with this is</p>
<p>basically this and this</p>
<p>like he does that so well takes a</p>
<p>semi complicated</p>
<p>thing and he just simplifies it you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good at that</p>
<p>and he was also just fucking hilarious</p>
<p>that would you piss my pants on</p>
<p>those specials</p>
<p>so but i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t consciously then go on stage and go</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do chris rock</p>
<p>but i was so influenced by him because he was like</p>
<p>comment that i was watching all the time</p>
<p>that i like i get that</p>
<p>with what you mean like if somebody were to hang out</p>
<p>all the time how they</p>
<p>could start</p>
<p>cause then i</p>
<p>would then i</p>
<p>would start to</p>
<p>like i would crouch on</p>
<p>punch lines you know he&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>that like he always he crouches</p>
<p>when he hits</p>
<p>punch lines yeah i</p>
<p>would start to do that and</p>
<p>people would</p>
<p>point out to me they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>do you know that like</p>
<p>when you hit</p>
<p>punch lines you&rsquo;re crouching if your</p>
<p>shoulders are raising or you&rsquo;re crouching down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i first went</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s chris rock</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>chris rock and then people</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>your fucking cadence is kind of urban</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be like what</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like you have an</p>
<p>urban cadence when you when you like</p>
<p>urban yeah that&rsquo;s what kind of</p>
<p>city become</p>
<p>synonymous with</p>
<p>black people yeah</p>
<p>i know right</p>
<p>weird like it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird euphemism to not appear racist</p>
<p>so this oh he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>urban and you know what it makes you sound like</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you saying that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make you</p>
<p>sound racist it makes you</p>
<p>sound like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never fucking even seen a</p>
<p>black person</p>
<p>like like urban</p>
<p>because you say like</p>
<p>this person</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t talk even if like</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>super politically correct</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that most people</p>
<p>who have like regular jobs like you have to like really</p>
<p>next to me yeah all</p>
<p>these fucks next to us</p>
<p>poor pricks</p>
<p>these poor pricks i fly with</p>
<p>these poor pricks all the time</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>whole urban thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a that is a</p>
<p>weird it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird sentiment</p>
<p>when i was in</p>
<p>georgia we were doing a show in georgia</p>
<p>thank you hot</p>
<p>towel bitches that&rsquo;s how we roll</p>
<p>his a podcast</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing sorry</p>
<p>she was like hot</p>
<p>towel bitches what the hell is he talking about</p>
<p>apologize the race racing podcast</p>
<p>show rugged experience</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been number one on itunes before</p>
<p>her eyes lit</p>
<p>up like he was saying</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not supposed to be up here</p>
<p>i always feel like i&rsquo;m not supposed to be up here</p>
<p>as much money</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;ve made and</p>
<p>much successive i have on tape tv i always feel</p>
<p>completely illegitimate</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;m at first</p>
<p>class i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>expecting someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out here</p>
<p>yank me out and</p>
<p>stick me in the back</p>
<p>every time i get a limo</p>
<p>looks like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>what prize did they win</p>
<p>neither one of us have shaved in weeks</p>
<p>you know yeah i know it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny but</p>
<p>all these poor fucks</p>
<p>ties and those slippery bottom shoes</p>
<p>that guy can&rsquo;t run faster than anybody</p>
<p>my two year old daughter</p>
<p>could run faster than him in those stupid shoes</p>
<p>slippery ass fucking stupid shoes</p>
<p>back to urban</p>
<p>we were in atlanta</p>
<p>and then this racist white lady was telling us</p>
<p>where to go and where not to go and i like hey we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go get something to eat where should we go</p>
<p>she was like well you don&rsquo;t want to go to this place</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got a lot of the elements wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re a combination of different things</p>
<p>earth wind and fire bitches</p>
<p>she said the elements</p>
<p>and we were like whoa</p>
<p>we made a repeat it we like other people come over</p>
<p>yeah cause it was so ridiculous</p>
<p>you know the l o n</p>
<p>shirt yeah that was actually so</p>
<p>fuck it sounds so much</p>
<p>worse than just dropping the fucking</p>
<p>yeah to be like you know elements it&rsquo;s like ouch dude</p>
<p>elements those elements</p>
<p>like i never heard that one before that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a unique one elements</p>
<p>literally sounds like disease to me</p>
<p>like you know what i mean like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially calling them a fucking disease</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really funny because all</p>
<p>human beings are capable of</p>
<p>speaking english and all</p>
<p>human beings are capable of</p>
<p>you know pretty much doing</p>
<p>an individual base is doing pretty much any job in the</p>
<p>world i mean there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>black surgeons and chinese comedians</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>chinese basketball players and irish</p>
<p>boxes i mean anybody can pretty much do anything right</p>
<p>but so because of that</p>
<p>whenever you categorize people or generalize</p>
<p>you become racist</p>
<p>instead of scientific</p>
<p>shut up up there come on</p>
<p>god damn it</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re selling shit</p>
<p>nobody wants to buy your</p>
<p>stupid sky mall bullshit</p>
<p>what is the percentage of people that buy</p>
<p>things off sky mall</p>
<p>is it even one it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be no can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>but anyway what i was saying is any</p>
<p>observations that you make</p>
<p>about people there all of a sudden it&rsquo;s racist</p>
<p>if you say like hey</p>
<p>black people seem to like to go to jail yeah yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a racist</p>
<p>but then if</p>
<p>you look at it and say well we&rsquo;ll get the numbers of</p>
<p>black people that are in jail</p>
<p>you know well what is that well it&rsquo;s economic</p>
<p>oh okay all</p>
<p>right well let&rsquo;s get poor</p>
<p>white people</p>
<p>yeah well well it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>economic because it seems like a big disparity you know</p>
<p>or you know it</p>
<p>could be anything</p>
<p>it could be saying the chinese people have little dicks</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s whip</p>
<p>out all the chinese dicks and whip them out</p>
<p>right next to the african dicks</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not racist</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not racist</p>
<p>but in anything that you say that</p>
<p>might hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings becomes</p>
<p>racist you know</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna accept it or deal with her think</p>
<p>about it it becomes</p>
<p>racist yeah and i hate also that um</p>
<p>i always have a</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>the word racist</p>
<p>and how people use it to mean racial</p>
<p>right just because you make it</p>
<p>up you can make an observation right</p>
<p>about a race it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>racist but people</p>
<p>right like racist</p>
<p>has a prejudice</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re prejudging you have to have to make at some</p>
<p>point at least the</p>
<p>the suggestion</p>
<p>the idea behind that somebody is inferior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s what it is to be</p>
<p>racist is to believe that</p>
<p>run race your race or</p>
<p>whichever race you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is superior right</p>
<p>so even if you say like man</p>
<p>i think i think chinese people</p>
<p>smell like cotton</p>
<p>candy or whatever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not racist</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re just totally</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying a race well</p>
<p>i said this on twitter once i said</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up with</p>
<p>black dudes that like to talk on</p>
<p>speakerphone when no one&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>because i see it all the time</p>
<p>and i saw it ironically at rosco&rsquo;s chicken and waffles</p>
<p>in la yeah the very</p>
<p>black establishment but</p>
<p>if you never been to la</p>
<p>quite goddamn delicious</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know what who invented the combination</p>
<p>of chicken and waffles but god damn it&rsquo;s a winner</p>
<p>so i put that up</p>
<p>um you know why what is it about</p>
<p>some black i even</p>
<p>wrote some black guys</p>
<p>that like to</p>
<p>talk on speakerphone</p>
<p>while no one&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>and all these</p>
<p>people immediately jumped on me and like that&rsquo;s a bit</p>
<p>racist don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>racist much</p>
<p>oh look joe rogan&rsquo;s a dick oh showing your true</p>
<p>colors i was like whoa</p>
<p>whoa i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with talking on</p>
<p>speakerphone</p>
<p>nothing there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with talking to someone on</p>
<p>speakerphone</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m simply asking</p>
<p>why do a lot of</p>
<p>black guys like</p>
<p>to do it when there&rsquo;s no one no one&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone with them</p>
<p>i mean no one&rsquo;s next to them like</p>
<p>like right now if you and i were talking to a</p>
<p>third party</p>
<p>we would have it on</p>
<p>speaker phone and that would make</p>
<p>sense because you</p>
<p>know that way we</p>
<p>could both hear</p>
<p>this is just a guy by himself talking on</p>
<p>speakerphone loud like i don&rsquo;t know know what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about like those commercials</p>
<p>where you at remember</p>
<p>those commercials for</p>
<p>boost mobile</p>
<p>dudes were on</p>
<p>speakerphone</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>where you at</p>
<p>where you at they&rsquo;re holding the</p>
<p>phone away from</p>
<p>their face and they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why that appealed to</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>i think it was all</p>
<p>about i think it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s like a performance</p>
<p>and i think i feel like a lot of</p>
<p>black culture</p>
<p>like black men</p>
<p>like to put like it&rsquo;s a performance a lot of times for</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s around so it was right</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s a way to get attention</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a way to get attention but you</p>
<p>sound like a big fat</p>
<p>racist we think</p>
<p>about that well you know i&rsquo;ve just been around</p>
<p>black people i</p>
<p>think i know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m being totally honest right now</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with saying that like</p>
<p>certain cultures like to do</p>
<p>things most most people in that</p>
<p>and whatever race will admit to the</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s fucking a</p>
<p>stupid thing that you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>well there was plenty of people that agreed with me</p>
<p>and even black guys had agreed with</p>
<p>me but there was a lot that got upset</p>
<p>but those are people</p>
<p>that are either like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being dishonest</p>
<p>where they hate something else in</p>
<p>their life so they&rsquo;re just attacking you</p>
<p>like some people are just over sensitive when they make</p>
<p>shit up it&rsquo;s also that they feel like they have the</p>
<p>right to get</p>
<p>angry at you it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>to point out that you&rsquo;re being a dick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a chance to have some power</p>
<p>in a conversation in their life</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re usually not in</p>
<p>power we had to call you on your bullshit</p>
<p>and to be self righteous</p>
<p>and to be indignant</p>
<p>to be upset</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing that people</p>
<p>have that where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even a rational</p>
<p>thing you can make fun of italians all day long</p>
<p>and guess what i&rsquo;ll fucking be there</p>
<p>right with you</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re goofy</p>
<p>my relatives are</p>
<p>goofy fucks there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people that i grew up with that are</p>
<p>goofy fucks</p>
<p>you know italians are some of the</p>
<p>showiest silliest</p>
<p>most ego driven people i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>upset when you talk</p>
<p>about them doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt my feelings i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>yeah i know like you know</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t racist but</p>
<p>mexican people</p>
<p>do taste like tacos</p>
<p>like if you take a bite out of a mexican</p>
<p>it tastes like tacos</p>
<p>okay that is the pot</p>
<p>cookie kicking in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the edible fella</p>
<p>no but i i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about really any</p>
<p>white person</p>
<p>stereotype dude i don&rsquo;t care</p>

<p>about you speak fluent spanish i do</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty weird coming out of your mouth</p>
<p>it is sounds</p>
<p>weird because you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>good at it like i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>you have conversations with people i was like tommy</p>
<p>might be a fucking cia</p>
<p>agent or something here man this is</p>
<p>crazy you should see anybody that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brown that i&rsquo;m talking to when i</p>
<p>speak spanish</p>
<p>their eyes always</p>
<p>light up like they were</p>
<p>ready to talk</p>
<p>some shit around you</p>
<p>absolutely people</p>
<p>that are latin</p>
<p>are are more</p>
<p>blown away by a</p>
<p>white person</p>
<p>speaking spanish than you</p>
<p>would ever imagine</p>
<p>really oh fuck yeah man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start speaking spanish and they&rsquo;ll just be like</p>
<p>what in the fuck</p>
<p>like where did you come from</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from mars yeah</p>
<p>really well eventually everyone&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>speaking spanish</p>
<p>right yeah dude</p>
<p>it helps a lot actually</p>
<p>i think i thought it</p>
<p>would it&rsquo;s gonna take over</p>
<p>english eventually is the main language of the world</p>
<p>it just seems like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breeding so much</p>
<p>so like inevitable</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s almost you know</p>
<p>so how do you stop it</p>
<p>are you been paying attention to all the shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down in mexico</p>
<p>the drug violence and</p>
<p>stuff oh yeah it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad now it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>worse and worse and</p>
<p>worse it&rsquo;s just constantly accelerating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually one of the few times where like</p>
<p>i usually pretty much read news</p>
<p>um without a lot of of an emotional response like i i</p>
<p>kind of have a pretty high tolerance for just</p>
<p>bad news like i&rsquo;m kind of a news junkie you know so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really ever feel</p>
<p>that emotional</p>
<p>i feel like i just kind of just take it all in</p>
<p>and the in the violence in the stories from mexico</p>
<p>actually took it from</p>
<p>like wow fascinating fascinating to</p>
<p>kind of terrifying</p>
<p>in a way you know i mean like</p>
<p>not really like i feel like</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s gonna break into my house</p>
<p>but like where the stories became terrifying</p>
<p>like like in a</p>
<p>movie where you&rsquo;re like whoa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>scary that that just happened yeah i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lucky you know that you were born here is really</p>
<p>just a roll of the dice you had no saying that yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other level where like</p>
<p>you know a kid</p>
<p>patty&rsquo;s here to see us hi patty</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s for the</p>
<p>internet it gets on the internet it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>radio show it&rsquo;s on the internet</p>
<p>and we do versions</p>
<p>where we do them on a plane</p>
<p>cause we usually do it in a studio</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s like a radio show</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of people will listen to this believe it or not</p>

<p>there you go</p>
<p>so what were we just talking about</p>
<p>mexico mexico</p>
<p>stories are scary like there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like a guy will get like</p>
<p>elected you know and</p>
<p>those he&rsquo;ll just make one he won&rsquo;t even make</p>
<p>a challenging comment he was like you know</p>
<p>we hope things get safer around here like</p>
<p>dead that night family dead did you hear</p>
<p>about the couple that were in</p>
<p>texas they were on a lake the lake that borders mexico</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the mexican side of the lake and these</p>
<p>gang members criminals whatever they were</p>
<p>shot their husband shot her husband she escaped</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to investigate and you know find out who did it so they</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an investigator from mexico immediately they kill him</p>
<p>immediately he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>so because it&rsquo;s a high profile</p>
<p>case they thought she was a suspect at some point</p>
<p>but just got to be horrible for her</p>
<p>it was their</p>
<p>honeymoon i believe</p>
<p>was it i think so</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t fuck around in mexico jack</p>
<p>they killed like a</p>
<p>whole school bus full of kids</p>
<p>you know they went to on a</p>
<p>school bus and killed a</p>
<p>bunch of kids and out of school</p>
<p>when was this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the past year</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve decapitated people left notes like</p>
<p>stabbed in the people oh yeah</p>
<p>did you see the one it was one recently</p>
<p>where they chop this guy up</p>
<p>and the really funny part about it was</p>
<p>they showed all of his body parts</p>
<p>except in his hand he had his penis</p>
<p>and they blurred out the penis</p>
<p>he showed everything else really oh yeah</p>
<p>was the most ridiculous blurring ever</p>
<p>was like what are you saving people thank you</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>you know fighting over control of the illegal drug</p>
<p>turf and what people don&rsquo;t know is that</p>
<p>are they may not know both pull it yeah</p>
<p>what people may not know is that</p>
<p>this didn&rsquo;t exist just a little while ago ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>i went on a vacation to cancun</p>
<p>in like two thousand and five</p>
<p>and you never</p>
<p>heard about drug violence back then you</p>
<p>never heard a peep about it</p>
<p>and hear nothing</p>
<p>about it didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>i mean it existed</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure but i mean it wasn&rsquo;t a part of mainstream</p>
<p>media in the news talking</p>
<p>about it now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s be like</p>
<p>people were only scared of columbia</p>
<p>like that with me but it makes</p>
<p>sense because the cartel</p>
<p>was in its heyday</p>
<p>in the eighties and nineties</p>
<p>and now power</p>
<p>shifts move the</p>
<p>money has moved to mexico</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be more violence</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>money yeah there was that</p>
<p>shift kind of</p>
<p>the violence</p>
<p>went with it</p>
<p>i watched an episode of the anthony bourdain</p>
<p>show no reservations</p>
<p>you ever see that show oh yeah i love that show</p>
<p>great if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a chef</p>
<p>and he travels all around the</p>
<p>world eating</p>
<p>their food and talking to</p>
<p>their chefs some</p>
<p>really good show and he&rsquo;s an interesting guy yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a real dude like he</p>
<p>no i hate watching a</p>
<p>travel show with eleven</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s everything is</p>
<p>great like he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like this kind of fucking suck yeah you like oh cool</p>
<p>yeah bullshit</p>
<p>yeah no he&rsquo;s straight up</p>
<p>about it but anyway he was in columbia</p>
<p>i think it was in medellin</p>
<p>and you know it was talking</p>
<p>about how maybe was bogota africa</p>
<p>but it was talking about how</p>
<p>great it was</p>
<p>yeah like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>crime has gone down</p>
<p>the cartels have all been</p>
<p>squashed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like you can you can hang out there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not dangerous anymore</p>
<p>yeah i mean you</p>
<p>would hope that that</p>
<p>could happen in mexico but</p>
<p>part of the problem</p>
<p>mexico is that it&rsquo;s connected to the united states</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why everybody here oh</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s an infinite supply</p>
<p>of customers</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re selling drugs infinite supply</p>
<p>customers and</p>
<p>the problem is</p>
<p>that the united</p>
<p>states wants mexico to keep drugs legal</p>
<p>illegal rather yeah</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t let them legalize it it was a big issue</p>
<p>and so they recently</p>
<p>decriminalized pretty much</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>you know this is like</p>
<p>really done under the</p>
<p>radar like mushrooms acid marijuana</p>
<p>everything is decriminalized in mexico</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you can sell it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you can have</p>
<p>large portions of it</p>
<p>where it looks like you&rsquo;re selling it but</p>
<p>you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a guy who gets caught with some coke</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>against the law why</p>
<p>would they do see</p>
<p>that just speaks to like the hypocrisy of</p>
<p>the people in charge there because if</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s such a problem and they</p>
<p>wanna come like fight it</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the reason why there&rsquo;s violence</p>
<p>then why would you decrimp like why would</p>
<p>it be okay to decriminalize</p>
<p>well they do</p>
<p>that to tie up resources because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna go after the</p>
<p>individual users</p>
<p>they only go</p>
<p>after the cartels</p>
<p>and they did it because the resources were</p>
<p>completely they</p>
<p>just you know</p>
<p>they had no people to allocate towards</p>
<p>the cartels they had to</p>
<p>focus on the important part</p>
<p>the important part is the people that are selling</p>
<p>money and committing violence</p>
<p>are selling rather drugs making a lot of</p>
<p>money and committing violence that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free up yes people</p>
<p>free up resources and</p>
<p>because they wanted to do in the</p>
<p>first place they wanted it to be</p>
<p>legal but the united</p>
<p>states wouldn&rsquo;t let them</p>
<p>united states</p>
<p>would not let mexico make drugs legal</p>
<p>you know they wanted to make it</p>
<p>legal so that</p>
<p>you know i mean look we all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tough</p>
<p>touchy subject with people</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like hey what</p>
<p>about the children</p>
<p>well guess what i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>babies drinking</p>
<p>whiskey either</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>whiskey&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>legal and it didn&rsquo;t used to be at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>whiskey was illegal just like heroin is today</p>
<p>and it was a big</p>
<p>thing and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>organized crime came into</p>
<p>power in this country that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the mom came from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where al capone came from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the fucking kennedys came from</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they got their</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>moonshine baby</p>
<p>whiskey mills you know</p>
<p>there were people were doing that and making illegal</p>
<p>drinking illegal booze and making a fuckload of</p>
<p>money and the rise of organized</p>
<p>crime came about because of that</p>
<p>but somehow in this fucking</p>
<p>stupid country we</p>
<p>never learned we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn that the really obvious lesson</p>
<p>you know hillary clinton</p>
<p>gave an interview recently</p>
<p>what she was talking about</p>
<p>they were talking</p>
<p>about mexico and they were talking about</p>
<p>legalized drugs</p>
<p>legalizing them</p>
<p>if that would solve the</p>
<p>issue she goes you can&rsquo;t do that they&rsquo;re just too much</p>
<p>money involved</p>
<p>yeah like what does that even mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stupid ignorant</p>
<p>short sided way of looking at it</p>
<p>oh there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>money involved so you can&rsquo;t make it legal</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>is one person when we really get down to it to</p>
<p>tell another person what they can and can&rsquo;t buy or sell</p>
<p>especially when you dealing with like</p>
<p>heroin or when you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with pot or dealing with anything that just grows here</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>should all be decriminalized</p>
<p>yeah absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely yeah</p>
<p>you know if meth</p>
<p>if if all drugs were</p>
<p>legal meth included</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think more people</p>
<p>would be doing meth</p>
<p>the people that are doing meth are</p>
<p>idiots in the first place well yeah</p>
<p>there would be</p>
<p>more people</p>
<p>dying of it but that</p>
<p>would also educate the intelligent people</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t want to be like that guy that died of it</p>
<p>you know will some people be sacrificed because of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s possible you know i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want it to be my children or my friends or my</p>
<p>friends children but neither</p>
<p>would you but</p>
<p>that just means you have to be more diligent in how you</p>
<p>raise your kids and how</p>
<p>aware you are</p>
<p>you know people say i don&rsquo;t have the time for that well</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really saying is you don&rsquo;t have the time for kids</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s part of being a fucking parent man</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>anybody that i know to be doing heroin</p>
<p>or coke or math or anything like that but</p>
<p>as long as you can go to a</p>
<p>cvs drugstore and buy enough whiskey</p>
<p>to drink yourself to</p>
<p>death easily anybody</p>
<p>could do that yeah you</p>
<p>could what what</p>
<p>is the difference between that and math i&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>guess i never thought of it like making the hard work</p>
<p>more hardcore</p>
<p>stuff legalize</p>
<p>always assume that keeping that</p>
<p>stuff illegal was a good thing</p>
<p>but maybe the same people that are doing it when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illegal would</p>
<p>just you know they&rsquo;d be the same people doing it legal</p>
<p>i would not</p>
<p>argue don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong like i</p>
<p>would not argue</p>
<p>about meth being</p>
<p>illegal or heroin</p>
<p>being illegal yeah like i have no problem with that</p>
<p>like if you want to keep it illegal</p>
<p>absolutely but</p>
<p>really when it boils down to</p>
<p>is that what i&rsquo;m saying is that the</p>
<p>stuff that i like like mushrooms and marijuana and all</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>those are just</p>
<p>as illegal if not more illegal and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely ridiculous that is ridiculous</p>
<p>because actually in some</p>
<p>maybe in california</p>
<p>they have like a higher</p>
<p>like no they have</p>
<p>no it can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>california one of the</p>
<p>states has it</p>
<p>where marijuana is criminally</p>
<p>the same level felony</p>
<p>that like heroin is</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s more illegal than heroin</p>
<p>or is that but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more illegal than cocaine to because it&rsquo;s matter</p>
<p>uses that&rsquo;s federally</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s insane yeah more illegal that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>that directly has to be tied</p>
<p>to the money behind of course because you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>yeah powered</p>
<p>and because there&rsquo;s pharmaceutical uses for opiates</p>
<p>where you could sell opiates</p>
<p>you know which is</p>
<p>essentially synthetic heroin like</p>
<p>oxycontins and shit like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s synthetic heroin yeah</p>
<p>you know so because there&rsquo;s medical uses for it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a schedule to</p>
<p>whereas marijuana is schedule one you know</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s completely ridiculous and it</p>
<p>it flies in the face of</p>
<p>logic and and it makes you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being insulted your intelligence is being insulted</p>
<p>you know i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that anybody</p>
<p>should be able to tell anybody else what to do</p>
<p>but you know if you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about keeping like heroin out of your community</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>should make it</p>
<p>like illegal in a town or illegal in a state</p>
<p>absolutely i&rsquo;m down for that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m totally down for</p>
<p>the community stepping in and protecting people from</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>can be demonstrated as being dangerous or deadly</p>
<p>but when you get to like pot and mushrooms like</p>
<p>who the fuck are you to tell people what to and to not</p>
<p>you know what they</p>
<p>kind of can&rsquo;t do no that really is more than anything</p>
<p>like a huge waste</p>
<p>of resources</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>could be better</p>
<p>spent as far as time and</p>
<p>crazy amounts of money</p>
<p>be freed up</p>
<p>for you know for making</p>
<p>for decriminalizing</p>
<p>marijuana mushrooms</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s just such even</p>
<p>worse than that it creates a</p>
<p>whole industry behind keeping it illegal</p>
<p>yeah from private prisons to cops</p>
<p>more money to dea</p>
<p>agents i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s been argued</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t make marijuana illegals because you</p>
<p>would lose all these jobs</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>legal rather</p>
<p>because you would</p>
<p>lose all these jobs</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>completely fucking silly like</p>
<p>just because</p>
<p>you get your job is cutting off puppies heads</p>
<p>and i like well we can&rsquo;t make puppies head cutting off</p>
<p>illegal because i will lose all these jobs</p>
<p>these guys are out there</p>
<p>chopping off puppies heads like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dumb way of looking at it man</p>
<p>it is but we have big government in this country man</p>
<p>and people like whenever they talk</p>
<p>about creating</p>
<p>new jobs and there&rsquo;s programs to create new jobs</p>
<p>i hear that</p>
<p>but i also hear all right</p>
<p>all the fuck you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the government bigger</p>
<p>by creating new jobs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just making the government larger and</p>
<p>and and and</p>
<p>more intertwined in our</p>
<p>life it&rsquo;s not necessarily like governing or helping or</p>
<p>you know using my tax dollars to the best advantage</p>
<p>who just creating</p>
<p>more jobs by making</p>
<p>things you know</p>
<p>what you have to fill out</p>
<p>paperwork for certain</p>
<p>things or you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the more government</p>
<p>you have the more fucking problems you have</p>
<p>and the more you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t downsize it</p>
<p>more you know you have a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>lobbying to keep</p>
<p>things illegal</p>
<p>that have been demonstrated as being</p>
<p>not dangerous or bad at all</p>
<p>and they just do it because they want to keep the jobs</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>about money man</p>
<p>money drives</p>
<p>everything money</p>
<p>money has an</p>
<p>effect on every single law</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing that is</p>
<p>you know completely easy and</p>
<p>legal it&rsquo;s worth a lot of money</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have some type of</p>
<p>either law attached to it or backend being kicked</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also in a good way too</p>
<p>bad work good i mean</p>
<p>money drives</p>
<p>movies you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spend 500 million dollars on a</p>
<p>movie like avatar</p>
<p>unless you know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to sell</p>
<p>and they knew that that</p>
<p>movie was gonna be a goddamn</p>
<p>blockbuster so money</p>
<p>drives it and</p>
<p>guess what you and i get to see it and go holy shit</p>
<p>this is fucking awesome fucking amazing yeah i mean</p>
<p>money drives cars like</p>
<p>you wanna buy a porsche</p>
<p>listen porsches you know</p>
<p>take away all the</p>
<p>stereotypes of midlife crisis cars and all that good</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s a fucking amazingly engineered</p>
<p>piece of machinery</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only one way to make that it cost a fuckload of</p>
<p>money and you have to</p>
<p>spend a lot of</p>
<p>money and time</p>
<p>developing and creating these</p>
<p>things and then you have to make sure that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be someone who&rsquo;s got a shitload of money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to</p>
<p>step in and buy</p>
<p>these things sure</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>money drives</p>
<p>things in a good way and in a bad way</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>my problem is not with</p>
<p>money moving</p>
<p>things my problem is with government</p>
<p>i just think we have an</p>
<p>enormous amount of government in this country that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely totally unnecessary</p>
<p>and we just</p>
<p>have it there because it creates jobs and because</p>
<p>you know a lot of</p>
<p>especially democrats love that shit they love to create</p>
<p>and make the</p>
<p>government bigger although the government grew</p>
<p>in you know the the bush administration from</p>
<p>the clinton administration just because of all this</p>
<p>you know keep america safe shit that was going on</p>
<p>oh that that had to create so many thousands my</p>
<p>career man yeah</p>
<p>absolutely nine eleven made everybody a lot of money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>it is insane</p>
<p>remember when they were doing the code orange</p>
<p>over that shit code red code orange code yellow</p>
<p>they recently gave that up</p>
<p>and they just did</p>
<p>right yeah too bad</p>
<p>i used to love</p>
<p>the early days of it</p>
<p>going to usa today</p>
<p>was heightened alert yes</p>
<p>so we were always at heightened alert yes</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people out there so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know how hard this government works</p>
<p>cause all our military and all our</p>
<p>secret service and all our cia</p>
<p>they are stopping terrorist attacks</p>
<p>every day of the week</p>
<p>you just sit your little comfortable</p>
<p>house and feel real good</p>
<p>why warriors</p>
<p>out there protect you from evil</p>
<p>and may or may not be true</p>
<p>i mean i know that they do a</p>
<p>great job and people are busting</p>
<p>their ass every day yes but you know what else they do</p>
<p>they also set</p>
<p>young dummies up</p>
<p>and give them fake bombs and then arrest them</p>
<p>like they did to that guy in dallas</p>
<p>remember that i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>gonna do it in</p>
<p>these from dallas and he was</p>
<p>gonna do it in colorado</p>
<p>i think it was in denver</p>
<p>i forget i forget what the</p>
<p>state was but</p>
<p>this kid was a fucking</p>
<p>idiot and he was</p>
<p>spouting off</p>
<p>about how he wanted to get back in america and he was</p>
<p>a part of some</p>
<p>radical muslim</p>
<p>group and they</p>
<p>they fucking contacted this guy the fbi got in with him</p>
<p>hooked him up gave him a bomb</p>
<p>and the bomb was fake then they arrested his ass</p>
<p>holy shit yeah man</p>
<p>they do shit like that they get you</p>
<p>to do things and then once you do it then they jack you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well part of me likes it though</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah i liked it they&rsquo;re out there exposing</p>
<p>those retards</p>
<p>yeah go get that dummy</p>
<p>give him a fake bomb then put him in a fucking jail</p>
<p>because if he was willing to pull the</p>
<p>trigger on that fake bomb i don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s coerced</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t care if you</p>
<p>you know you made it</p>
<p>sound a lot better than it really is to him you made it</p>
<p>sound wonderful</p>
<p>but you that guy that fucking</p>
<p>dummy was willing to do that kill him</p>
<p>lock him in jail toss him away</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that easily</p>
<p>influence of a mind</p>
<p>yeah doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be free either way</p>
<p>yeah there was another guy recently i believe it was</p>
<p>in seattle seattle or portland somewhere in the pacific</p>
<p>northwest another guy same</p>
<p>thing they totally set his ass up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up and lock them up</p>

<p>close he just did a shitty job</p>
<p>constructing his truck bomb</p>
<p>but if that thing went off</p>
<p>you know that fucking thing was gonna kill</p>

<p>or thousand you know it</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>mean i don&rsquo;t know how much</p>
<p>power is detonated by one of those truck bombs</p>
<p>but this dummy just didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t have the right</p>
<p>system set up to detonate it</p>
<p>but he was willing</p>
<p>to do it man there are people out there that are</p>
<p>fucking dumb as</p>
<p>shit and will it do it how</p>
<p>about like those somali pirates dude</p>

<p>worst place to live</p>
<p>where doing that shit</p>
<p>fucking let&rsquo;s go kidnap people on a boat</p>
<p>is a better option</p>
<p>well do you know how it all happened</p>
<p>the somali pirates used to be called they</p>
<p>initially started calling themselves</p>
<p>the volunteer</p>
<p>coast guard of somalia</p>
<p>and they started kidnapping european ships</p>
<p>because european</p>
<p>ships were dumping</p>
<p>things in their</p>
<p>water and it was killing all</p>
<p>their fish and they</p>
<p>had that was</p>
<p>their income</p>
<p>they were their fishermen</p>
<p>so they got upset at</p>
<p>these companies</p>
<p>dumping all this</p>
<p>toxic waste into</p>
<p>their waters</p>
<p>so they kidnapped one</p>
<p>and they held</p>
<p>them up for ransom they got like a million bucks</p>
<p>and then they were like</p>
<p>fuck fishing</p>
<p>and then they went</p>
<p>crazy and just</p>
<p>started making it</p>
<p>their number one thing now</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p>miles away from somalia and jacking people</p>

<p>bunch on the congo and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird how</p>
<p>crazy it is there</p>

<p>lawless place</p>

<p>that that&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s just shows you like how</p>
<p>lucky you are to not be born there</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s that many people that like</p>
<p>for through nothing no choice or decision</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just where you live your life</p>
<p>in fucking somalia</p>
<p>yeah no kidding man we&rsquo;re like shit</p>
<p>like this you&rsquo;re you live in a war zone</p>
<p>from the diet from the day you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>yeah pretty ridiculous</p>
<p>totally ridiculous and then like</p>
<p>that somebody else just happens to be born</p>
<p>in bel air and that&rsquo;s their existence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what they do</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>yeah just lucky</p>
<p>come on seven or</p>
<p>you did something super awesome in another life</p>
<p>yeah you know we&rsquo;re super shitty yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah you ever wonder about that man yeah</p>
<p>you know like what what made you born</p>
<p>and were you born ohio so we were born yes is that yeah</p>
<p>what did you do in the past life</p>
<p>would you believe in reincarnation</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>thought about it i don&rsquo;t know if i actually</p>
<p>really buy into that concept but i do</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>i do think sometimes like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m feeling really shitty</p>
<p>about myself i&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>what the fuck did i do to be</p>
<p>so lucky you know</p>
<p>right like to have</p>
<p>a good life</p>
<p>right like what</p>
<p>why why am i</p>
<p>looking someone&rsquo;s life is so fucking terrible yeah</p>
<p>i have no answer</p>
<p>for that i don&rsquo;t you know i don&rsquo;t know if there is one</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s one either i was</p>
<p>thought about</p>
<p>reincarnation that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly to believe</p>
<p>or disbelieve it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>silly to believe it but</p>
<p>i can see that but why not mean look</p>
<p>just the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive and that you</p>
<p>you know whatever it is that</p>
<p>carries your personality in it</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know whether it&rsquo;s a soul or consciousness or</p>
<p>you know what it whatever you are</p>
<p>just that it exists</p>
<p>alone in this</p>
<p>state in this body</p>
<p>is fucking weird enough man</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>travel from this life to the next one why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know a soul</p>
<p>leave this dimension and</p>
<p>enter into a new physical body maybe even</p>
<p>a totally new dimension</p>
<p>i mean maybe</p>
<p>maybe our thing</p>
<p>about reincarnation is off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not reincarnation like</p>
<p>you live one life in this</p>
<p>earth and then you come</p>
<p>back and you&rsquo;re born as a baby you live another life</p>
<p>no you might die and</p>
<p>enter into some unrecognizable new sort of a fucking</p>
<p>frequency of life</p>
<p>something completely different in the next</p>
<p>stage i mean that</p>
<p>could be what</p>
<p>evolution or what rather</p>
<p>reincarnation really is</p>
<p>is that your soul evolves</p>
<p>as your physical being and your universe</p>
<p>evolves and it</p>
<p>moves and changes from one</p>
<p>thing into the next or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just dead</p>
<p>this could be all bullshit</p>
<p>could be all just</p>
<p>tricks your</p>
<p>brains trying to play on you</p>
<p>yeah i think</p>
<p>believing or disbelieving any of those</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to consider all the possibilities but</p>
<p>believing or disbelieving</p>
<p>very very little difference between that and religion</p>
<p>oh yeah absolutely very little i mean</p>
<p>so i always think</p>
<p>hearing the different</p>
<p>theories from each religion is interesting</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t have a problem with people is different</p>
<p>believes what</p>
<p>might happen</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t feel one way that like no dude this is</p>
<p>definitely what happens right i</p>
<p>understand how anybody actually goes</p>
<p>yeah then here&rsquo;s what happens after that</p>
<p>you talk to a guy and then you get a</p>
<p>glass of milk</p>
<p>and then you go like really do you know</p>
<p>all the fucking details of what happens</p>
<p>seriously well all you have to</p>
<p>do is pretend that you know that and talk confidently</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have a cult</p>
<p>yes that simple</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s amazing thing</p>
<p>about people</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re so fucking insecure and confused</p>
<p>that all someone has to do is come</p>
<p>along and speak</p>
<p>confidently</p>
<p>and we listen</p>
<p>absolutely they can see the most</p>
<p>ridiculous shit ever</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be at</p>
<p>least a few</p>
<p>people that will be into what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>yeah believing</p>
<p>in anything believing in anything that you can&rsquo;t prove</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re choosing</p>
<p>a box that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put your thoughts in</p>
<p>and once you do that man</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s outside that box</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve discredited you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>left it out of the realm of possibility</p>
<p>and that becomes a real problem with thinking</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re basing something on</p>
<p>a thought process in</p>
<p>a pattern of behavior that is</p>
<p>from a long time ago when people knew almost nothing</p>
<p>about science</p>
<p>almost nothing</p>
<p>about the nature of reality</p>
<p>i mean even though we don&rsquo;t know that much</p>
<p>about it now i mean</p>
<p>we know way more</p>
<p>about it they knew</p>
<p>three thousand years ago when they were writing the</p>
<p>bible you know when you</p>
<p>when you read the shit that does exist in the bible</p>
<p>all the shit about women being</p>
<p>second class citizens and condoning slavery and</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why would you believe anything from it why</p>
<p>how come you can cherry</p>
<p>pick from the nonsense you have to pick and choose</p>
<p>but either pick and choose or</p>
<p>you blanket embrace it</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>right or you</p>
<p>blanket rejected but</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>blanket accept it</p>
<p>yeah always</p>
<p>sound insane there&rsquo;s no such</p>
<p>thing as somebody who across the board</p>
<p>loves it and goes</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a rational person</p>
<p>you have to pick them shoes</p>
<p>yeah otherwise it&rsquo;s too crazy</p>
<p>will you ever religious at any</p>
<p>point in your life totally</p>
<p>yeah when well</p>
<p>growing i just raised in</p>
<p>like catholic</p>
<p>household so it wasn&rsquo;t like super</p>
<p>strict but like it was just kind of intensified</p>
<p>and so it just means you&rsquo;re just raised</p>
<p>like this is the way it is</p>
<p>you know pray a lot</p>
<p>when did you</p>
<p>start to think it was horseshit</p>
<p>actually i was really affected by a lot by the scandal</p>
<p>when when the that that kind of put me off which one</p>
<p>like when the initial</p>
<p>huge rush of</p>
<p>all the pedophilia charges</p>
<p>against the catholic church came</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always been select but like when that big rush</p>
<p>of them where it was like no this is a massive problem</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>fucked me up and</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to not start having doubts about like</p>
<p>people that i was raised</p>
<p>how old we when this happen you think</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>stories but i i wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t till i was a</p>
<p>teenager i was like</p>
<p>i know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s great people</p>
<p>in the catholic church but i know</p>
<p>great great amazing people sure there&rsquo;s great moonies</p>
<p>was great scientologist</p>
<p>yeah but i like but we&rsquo;re like like the people are</p>
<p>truly what it is to be good</p>
<p>like i know priests</p>
<p>that are just like</p>
<p>amazing human beings but</p>
<p>uh when you</p>
<p>think about the magnitude of one organization</p>
<p>that was essentially like running an operation that was</p>
<p>that was designed</p>
<p>to give people opportunities to to have</p>
<p>fuck a chance to fuck kids</p>
<p>is what it is really</p>
<p>that is really traumatizing to</p>
<p>what i thought</p>
<p>of the church before that happened</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like a hard</p>
<p>thing to even say</p>
<p>because it feels like such a betrayal</p>
<p>like of what</p>
<p>you were raised to believe was just something that is</p>
<p>so good yeah that the</p>
<p>thing that is</p>
<p>so good and beautiful it&rsquo;s supposed to be so wonderful</p>
<p>is harboring</p>
<p>essentially the</p>
<p>worst type of criminal</p>
<p>you know i mean it seems like there&rsquo;s so much harboring</p>
<p>too that it really must be on purpose and it must be</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many pedophiles</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s literally how they run</p>
<p>things and how</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want people</p>
<p>to get caught because they don&rsquo;t want to get caught</p>
<p>i mean and then you know</p>
<p>they probably</p>
<p>pulled the guy who got caught aside and go</p>
<p>silly bitch you know why</p>
<p>you trying to convince kids to suck your dick there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plenty kids will suck your dick you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>force them down you don&rsquo;t have to rape them</p>
<p>i still struggle</p>
<p>today with the fact of like</p>
<p>wanting to believe</p>
<p>that the the</p>
<p>church is what is perfect and good in the world</p>
<p>like cause that was such a big part of how i was raised</p>
<p>to facing the reality</p>
<p>of what it has become</p>
<p>wow it still bugs you it</p>
<p>still bothers me yeah wow</p>
<p>well because it</p>
<p>essentially is like being like</p>
<p>especially being betrayed by like a best friend</p>
<p>right right family member</p>
<p>yeah family it&rsquo;s like but it&rsquo;s like a horrible betrayal</p>
<p>yeah where like something you can&rsquo;t even fathom</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it feels like to me like even though i wasn&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>super religious</p>
<p>it was that they ruined</p>
<p>the place that i thought was the safe</p>
<p>haven in the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>the amazing</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>no one prosecutes them</p>
<p>and internationally</p>
<p>these guys could</p>
<p>travel back and forth and no one</p>
<p>treats them as sex criminals</p>
<p>like ratzinger</p>
<p>the current pope</p>
<p>that guy has actively</p>
<p>sought to shield</p>
<p>child molesters from prosecution</p>
<p>it is hundred percent provable</p>
<p>when he was the whatever the fuck he was the</p>
<p>grand pooba</p>
<p>in arizona i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>for new mexico i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the fuck he was but he was</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>papers and documents</p>
<p>showing that he&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>guys around and trying not to get them prosecuted</p>
<p>and they would just</p>
<p>pluck a pedophile</p>
<p>preacher out</p>
<p>and put him in a new</p>
<p>place where they can fuck his</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the absolute for me</p>
<p>and the way i feel it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst crime that a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>could do it&rsquo;s one of them</p>
<p>is something to children like</p>
<p>to hurt children is yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such the most horrifying</p>
<p>thing you ruin someone&rsquo;s life forever</p>
<p>and like that they were a</p>
<p>an organization that</p>
<p>basically was like</p>
<p>it was like it was like a hiring service for that</p>
<p>yeah it was like do you want to do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they became</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no sort of like a</p>
<p>scientology they</p>
<p>they say with</p>
<p>celebrities that they protect the celebrity</p>
<p>and they do</p>
<p>their pr and they</p>
<p>create like a public</p>
<p>persona for them and actively cultivated and work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of the reasons why they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been accused of having</p>
<p>a bunch of gay celebrities and you</p>
<p>know setting them</p>
<p>up and making it look like they&rsquo;re straight and then</p>
<p>aggressively going</p>
<p>after anybody who questions it yeah yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p>basically this</p>
<p>is what the catholic church did they&rsquo;re pedophiles</p>
<p>and this the</p>
<p>thing is that it&rsquo;s not just the</p>
<p>idea the crime</p>
<p>the act of the physical</p>
<p>crime that was being committed but</p>
<p>the level of corruption</p>
<p>makes it that much worse</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>scary is that no one&rsquo;s done anything</p>
<p>about it i mean</p>
<p>besides individual preachers</p>
<p>and priests getting caught and arrested</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s done anything</p>
<p>about it on a big</p>
<p>level like no one&rsquo;s ever like</p>
<p>audited the catholic church&rsquo;s records</p>
<p>and said listen we need to find out what you have and</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done and</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start arresting some of you fucking freaks</p>
<p>like when ratzinger</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s been proven that the current pope</p>
<p>shielded child molesters why</p>
<p>is he allowed to</p>
<p>travel to america why isn&rsquo;t he arrested</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they pull him aside</p>
<p>i mean it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense he&rsquo;s a fucking criminal that&rsquo;s criminal behavior</p>
<p>if that guy was working for</p>
<p>donut world</p>
<p>you know and all of his</p>
<p>managers were bone in kids in the</p>
<p>bathrooms at</p>
<p>donut world</p>
<p>and then it was shown</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>shielding his</p>
<p>managers from</p>
<p>you know from</p>
<p>from being prosecuted that he</p>
<p>would go to jail he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be making donuts anymore</p>
<p>he definitely</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>travel from country to country</p>
<p>better have</p>
<p>donuts no richard dawkins</p>
<p>it was rick dawkins are hitchins</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t forget it</p>
<p>might have been christopher hitchens</p>
<p>they were you know</p>
<p>campaigning to have him arrested for</p>
<p>for fucking</p>
<p>crimes against humanity</p>
<p>campaigning to have him arrested for for</p>
<p>pedophilia you know for what the fuck he&rsquo;s doing but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>thing you can do meanwhile they just fucking fly around</p>
<p>and you know i mean he travels</p>
<p>all over the</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video of him</p>
<p>being entertained by these</p>
<p>shirtless male acrobats</p>
<p>it is one of the</p>
<p>creepiest gayest things</p>
<p>you see it was incredible the</p>
<p>pope and the gayest looking manscaped</p>
<p>waxed eyebrows dyed hair</p>
<p>weird gay looking guys</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>their acrobatic bullshit in</p>
<p>front of him and he&rsquo;s clapping with his</p>
<p>withered old finger fucking kid hands</p>
<p>they all look they&rsquo;re all like gymnasts</p>
<p>they have on like the</p>
<p>weird gymnast</p>
<p>pants and their</p>
<p>shirtless tights</p>
<p>yeah and they have and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shirtless with like just like wrist tape</p>
<p>and after like</p>
<p>every moment they</p>
<p>would kind of pose</p>
<p>look like they were kind of flex like they were</p>
<p>saying i feel</p>
<p>and they would kind of like look at a mirror and</p>
<p>smile at them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the fucking</p>
<p>you feel violated</p>
<p>because like it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re looking at you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like a team of</p>
<p>of weird uh</p>
<p>gay aggravation is coming at you like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to do something</p>
<p>to you it&rsquo;s creepy as shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so creepy it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how much he looks like that bad guy from star wars</p>
<p>the old guy</p>
<p>have you ever seen the</p>
<p>comparisons online the</p>
<p>photos no it&rsquo;s hilarious dude</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>him with his</p>
<p>goofy ass robe on</p>
<p>that is one of the</p>
<p>weirdest things that nobody mocks the outfit</p>
<p>i know with this</p>
<p>stupid fucking fish head hat</p>
<p>like whatever that</p>
<p>thing is looks like a fish with its mouth open</p>
<p>yeah why don&rsquo;t you why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just a point</p>
<p>where tradition just</p>
<p>becomes you know what that&rsquo;s too old of a tradition</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s switch it up</p>
<p>yeah all their bishop outfits</p>
<p>their car they</p>
<p>should just</p>
<p>change it to like</p>
<p>starter jackets</p>
<p>they just go to like a later era</p>
<p>but all have the same</p>
<p>thing like we all</p>
<p>run starter jackets</p>
<p>starter jackets from like the 1920s red sox</p>
<p>yeah fucking</p>
<p>vatican style</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious with a big v on the back</p>
<p>v for vatican just do that for the next</p>
<p>eight hundred years and then they will adopt</p>
<p>a new thing</p>
<p>right if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>connected to god does it matter what you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>you know i mean that does that mean that seems to be</p>
<p>completely silly yeah</p>
<p>like why would you have to wear a</p>
<p>stupid outfit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve always goofed on monks</p>
<p>like no they don&rsquo;t have it together</p>
<p>if you have it together why</p>
<p>would you be wearing that goddamn bathrobe</p>
<p>everywhere that&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>ridiculous shit ever yeah</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you&rsquo;re not wearing that</p>
<p>are your beliefs gone or something no</p>
<p>you can wear whatever you want</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s silly to</p>
<p>think that like just because you have the add on</p>
<p>well i also</p>
<p>think i think</p>
<p>people have a big difficulty in being</p>
<p>trapped by certain</p>
<p>things in life</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>material possessions or relationships or whatever but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you</p>
<p>should be a monk and avoid</p>
<p>everything because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t handle it because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing out on some of the most amazing parts of life</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>sexual relationship</p>
<p>with someone you don&rsquo;t have children</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re committed to a life of abstinence</p>
<p>and you think you got your shit together that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>stupid that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing a workaround for the shit</p>
<p>about being a</p>
<p>human that you can&rsquo;t manage and handle</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t handle material possessions you can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>competition you can&rsquo;t handle sexual</p>
<p>behavior you can&rsquo;t handle relationships</p>
<p>so what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you gonna</p>
<p>dress like a fucking pop tart and live in a in a</p>
<p>house with a</p>
<p>bunch of other weirdos</p>
<p>you know yeah i mean</p>
<p>but some of</p>
<p>them are like i feel like there are a few people</p>
<p>that are made to just have</p>
<p>almost like</p>
<p>lives of just</p>
<p>ultimate like</p>
<p>eternal goodness like yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>super good people and</p>
<p>i think some of them go to that yes but i do feel like</p>
<p>a lot of people use um</p>
<p>any lifestyle choice that is extreme</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to escape something</p>
<p>yes i think there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>to escape to</p>
<p>i think some are just on a</p>
<p>search summer are</p>
<p>searching for</p>
<p>you know the answers and they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>you know separate themselves from some of the</p>
<p>worldly vices that have controlled them and</p>
<p>made their their life a mess</p>
<p>you know i i kind of see that</p>
<p>but i just see for so many of them it just seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>silly way to fucking live you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re missing out on all the fun man</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re missing out on joy</p>
<p>do you have to</p>
<p>you know do you have to miss out on the fun</p>
<p>does it have to be that way you know</p>
<p>i have a friend that became a monk</p>
<p>really yeah a real live monk man</p>
<p>moved to a monastery and</p>
<p>everything my friend joe diggs</p>
<p>joe diggs was a taekwondo guy that i used to train with</p>
<p>and this is back when i was a young kid</p>
<p>and he used to get</p>
<p>real nervous</p>
<p>about fighting</p>
<p>about fighting in tournaments and real nervous</p>
<p>about sparring days</p>
<p>you know sparring is fucking dangerous man you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re throwing kicks at each</p>
<p>other and guys get knocked out all the time</p>
<p>we would we would always have guys would always get</p>
<p>knocked out in class it would happen all the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary you know your friends</p>
<p>would get kicked in the head right in</p>
<p>front of you and dropped</p>
<p>so he had a lot of anxiety</p>
<p>about sparring</p>
<p>and what he decided to do was um</p>
<p>start meditating</p>
<p>so he really got into transcendental</p>
<p>meditation and different types of</p>
<p>meditation and started studying buddhism and</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>started going to</p>
<p>a monastery</p>
<p>to learn meditation and</p>
<p>he decided to give up his life and join the monastery</p>
<p>did he give up</p>
<p>everything give up his material possessions</p>
<p>he had certain</p>
<p>tasks that he was supposed to do at the monastery</p>
<p>like cleaning and and</p>
<p>and different</p>
<p>things that he had to do</p>
<p>and he was given a zen</p>
<p>cone to try to</p>
<p>meditate on</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>sound of one hand clapping</p>
<p>you know one of</p>
<p>those type of things</p>
<p>you know what those are</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like a riddle that you really can&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>yeah you know and it was something like a</p>
<p>a cow says moo</p>
<p>or something like that was like really</p>
<p>something like</p>
<p>completely bizarre like i remember him</p>
<p>telling me what</p>
<p>this question was that he was supposed to contemplate</p>
<p>until he achieved enlightenment</p>
<p>i was like wow this is the</p>
<p>weirdest thing ever</p>
<p>but this was a guy that genuinely</p>
<p>like embraced the idea of</p>
<p>giving up his material life and really</p>
<p>really studying</p>
<p>the mind and disciplining himself and exploring</p>
<p>his his internal consciousness</p>
<p>you know he really he was a guy that was</p>
<p>probably like in his late thirties when this</p>
<p>this happened</p>
<p>to him and he was a little disillusioned by</p>
<p>life out there</p>
<p>in the workplace and and what he was doing</p>
<p>and so this is like</p>
<p>a real opportunity</p>
<p>for him to not live like everybody else</p>
<p>so he went into it man</p>
<p>he went right into it is he happy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know because i</p>
<p>never stayed</p>
<p>close with him</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just a guy that</p>
<p>i knew from back then and i you know we went out to</p>
<p>lunch a couple times</p>
<p>after he became a monk and</p>
<p>and he was only eating vegetables</p>
<p>you know he had</p>
<p>you know become</p>
<p>completely vegetarian</p>
<p>and he was saying</p>
<p>that he liked it didn&rsquo;t like the no sex part</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like that yeah</p>
<p>that was kind of</p>
<p>freaky to him</p>
<p>you know but he kind of</p>
<p>understood that</p>
<p>your relationships can get in the way of your</p>
<p>meditation and your work</p>
<p>you meditate</p>
<p>eight hours a day man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really incredible</p>
<p>yeah how weird huh yeah</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s such an extreme</p>
<p>thing to do oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as extreme as going</p>
<p>the opposite direction i mean like</p>
<p>we let everything just</p>
<p>go to shit and you live like a fucking lunatic and yeah</p>
<p>parting all the time</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s an extreme yeah</p>
<p>so is meditating</p>
<p>eight hours that&rsquo;s extreme</p>
<p>thing to do yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean i know people do it</p>
<p>they claim to be</p>
<p>happy but it just seems like it&rsquo;s so out of</p>
<p>balance i always feel like they don&rsquo;t have good friends</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re missing out on all the fun</p>
<p>stuff right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>would you want to</p>
<p>i mean i guess do whatever the fuck that makes you</p>
<p>happy and everyone&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own makeup and everyone&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own structure</p>
<p>you know that you know they</p>
<p>appreciate different</p>
<p>things i get all that</p>
<p>but i just feel like</p>
<p>should be having fun</p>
<p>man this life is fun</p>
<p>if you have a</p>
<p>bunch of cool</p>
<p>friends and you go do fun shit you can have a</p>
<p>great goddamn time and</p>
<p>the laughter and the heightened</p>
<p>experience is like</p>
<p>something to be</p>
<p>enjoyed you know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things that are enjoyable</p>
<p>about this life</p>
<p>and i think</p>

<p>alienated from</p>
<p>those things by work</p>
<p>and by obligation by</p>
<p>debt by you</p>
<p>know all these</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re forced to do that they don&rsquo;t like to do</p>
<p>and they forget that</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have this if you just like</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m not trying to rub this in but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be living the life of a comedian</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>traveling from one</p>
<p>place to the next</p>
<p>where you meet a</p>

<p>post production for a long time on shows just</p>
<p>you know scheduling stuff and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fucking it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being in that that nine to five mode</p>
<p>was depressing</p>
<p>it is it was a horrible thing</p>
<p>i just hated the hierarchy that all of it</p>
<p>fucking really most people&rsquo;s reality</p>
<p>horrible i avoided so much of it i had</p>
<p>some nine to five gigs but most of it was construction</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t really nine to</p>
<p>five it was you know</p>
<p>seven or three or something like that and</p>
<p>most of it was</p>
<p>you know part time stuff</p>
<p>or not part time but you know temporary</p>
<p>where i do it for a couple</p>
<p>months and i quit and go do something else</p>
<p>because i could i just couldn&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>i did my best</p>
<p>to try to you know</p>
<p>figure out a</p>
<p>way to make a living outside of that so i was</p>
<p>doing like i was delivering newspapers in the morning</p>
<p>because that was only a few</p>
<p>hours every morning it was</p>
<p>seven days a week</p>
<p>but it was only a few</p>
<p>hours except on</p>
<p>sunday was a big day</p>
<p>but i was like okay well i can make some</p>
<p>money this way and then let me add some little</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>the daytime i</p>
<p>started driving cars in the daytime</p>
<p>doing limo driving that was only like a few days a week</p>
<p>so i was like well this is good so now i&rsquo;m sort</p>
<p>of working full time i&rsquo;m really working for at 40 hours</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not all in the same</p>
<p>place so it&rsquo;s not driving me nuts yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>doing anything</p>
<p>where i had constantly have to be around a boss</p>
<p>or constantly have to be in an office</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>i was delivering newspapers i was in my car</p>
<p>and when i was</p>
<p>driving limos you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>picking people up the airports all kinds of different</p>
<p>folks you&rsquo;re interacting with it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it was way better than you know being</p>
<p>stuck in an office i</p>
<p>think if i couldn&rsquo;t do this and i had to get a real job</p>
<p>again i would actually do construction i did</p>
<p>a construction</p>
<p>when i was in high</p>
<p>school would you really</p>
<p>i hate the office that much where</p>
<p>i actually feel like</p>
<p>instruction is some shit is</p>
<p>really more rewarding work really</p>
<p>i it was the hardest</p>
<p>stuff it was in the summers</p>
<p>florida and i was in high school</p>
<p>but at the end of the day</p>
<p>i felt better</p>
<p>about myself and was happier than</p>
<p>any office job that i had</p>
<p>wow i would rather be</p>
<p>sweating and sore</p>
<p>being in the office wow</p>
<p>yeah i did a lot of gigs</p>
<p>when i was a kid when i was in high school</p>
<p>my dad was an architect growing up and so</p>
<p>he got me jobs</p>
<p>on construction sites doing a lot of</p>
<p>laboring did some</p>
<p>you know like some summers</p>
<p>i would do laboring and then i did like some carpentry</p>
<p>apprenticeship</p>
<p>stuff we did was an architect yeah yeah</p>
<p>so i was always</p>
<p>around construction sites i did a lot of them but</p>
<p>the hardest one i ever had i was working with my friend</p>
<p>jimmy he got me this job on the crew that he worked on</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>it was a small</p>
<p>crew a family owned crew and they made you work hard</p>
<p>it was a look</p>
<p>if you working in a big</p>
<p>group of you know</p>
<p>twenty thirty guys</p>
<p>and people slack off a little</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you and two other guys</p>
<p>and the boss</p>
<p>like man you got a fucking work man and all summer long</p>
<p>we built a wheelchair ramp at a</p>
<p>nights of columbus hall and</p>
<p>and somewhere in massachusetts</p>
<p>and i had to</p>
<p>carry bags of cement</p>
<p>and pressure</p>
<p>treated lumber all day</p>
<p>that was the day</p>
<p>it was fucking brutal</p>
<p>you know cements like</p>
<p>fifty pounds</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>carrying fifty</p>
<p>pound bag cement</p>
<p>and these big</p>
<p>giant pressure</p>
<p>treated lumbers</p>
<p>and you would get</p>
<p>those pressure</p>
<p>treated lumber splinters</p>
<p>where it says</p>
<p>toxic fucking</p>
<p>shit that they use to make this wood</p>
<p>like so it doesn&rsquo;t ever rot</p>
<p>like pressure</p>
<p>treated lumber you can make decks out of it you</p>
<p>could make you can have anything that&rsquo;s exposed you</p>
<p>could rain on it all day it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna go away</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>saturated with</p>
<p>toxic fucking</p>
<p>oil or whatever the hell they use to make it pressure</p>
<p>treated and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heavy as shit</p>
<p>and we just</p>
<p>carrying that</p>
<p>stuff around all day for a</p>
<p>whole summer that&rsquo;s fucking that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great though it was</p>
<p>great for me it was a very important week uh summer</p>
<p>i think i think i did it for a few weeks</p>
<p>it was only like</p>
<p>maybe two or</p>
<p>three weeks i don&rsquo;t really remember</p>
<p>but i remember that it was so brutally hard</p>
<p>and it was so</p>
<p>ridiculously like taxing</p>
<p>at the end of the day i</p>
<p>would go work out</p>
<p>i would go to the gym and try to hit the bag</p>
<p>i had nothing and i was</p>
<p>still fighting at the time too</p>
<p>so i knew i couldn&rsquo;t compete while</p>
<p>i had this job there was no way i couldn&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>i would i was so</p>
<p>tired i would go and i was</p>
<p>stupid back then so i didn&rsquo;t hydrate myself correctly</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t drink enough</p>
<p>water and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take care of my</p>
<p>nutrition i</p>
<p>would eat like you</p>
<p>know ham sandwiches and shit and you know no vitamins</p>
<p>and you know you do that for a long enough and</p>
<p>your body just gets taxed it&rsquo;s not good for you yeah</p>
<p>but it taught me a huge lesson</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think anybody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been through a job like that</p>
<p>where you are</p>
<p>spent at the end of</p>
<p>every day can&rsquo;t wait for friday saturday</p>
<p>flies by sunday</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re clinging</p>
<p>onto it like a kitten hanging on a curtain</p>
<p>next thing you know</p>
<p>monday morning</p>
<p>six thirty that</p>
<p>alarm clock goes off man and it really</p>
<p>should go off at six</p>
<p>cause you gotta be there at</p>
<p>seven so you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna be like five minutes late</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t been through that and then</p>
<p>gotten that measly fucking</p>
<p>check at the end of the week for that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like whoa</p>
<p>this is what all my time and effort is</p>
<p>worth like the</p>
<p>system the way it&rsquo;s set up</p>
<p>today for people who work</p>
<p>like what you have to do to work</p>
<p>to get a living out of</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense your life is</p>
<p>worth way more than that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why i was</p>
<p>thinking even though i was</p>
<p>broke i was</p>
<p>thinking my life is</p>
<p>worth more than 500</p>
<p>for the whole week</p>
<p>because i can&rsquo;t even spend this</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m goddamn exhausted i mean i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna spend it on bills and you know</p>
<p>lights and electricity</p>
<p>and fucking gas and all that shit but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>enjoy it is what i</p>
<p>should say it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>giant weight on you and</p>
<p>some people man that weight stays on them till they die</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t done that</p>
<p>are not as good at</p>
<p>human beings too</p>
<p>it makes you a better</p>
<p>human being yes</p>
<p>you have had that</p>
<p>experience like to</p>
<p>one time had to do</p>
<p>hard physical</p>
<p>shit yes make a living makes you a better person</p>
<p>i think it makes you humble i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to get cocky if you had a bunch of</p>
<p>success but</p>
<p>no matter what</p>
<p>success i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever had in my life i remember delivering newspapers</p>
<p>i remember getting up at</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning on</p>
<p>sunday morning sometimes i</p>
<p>just stayed up saturday night</p>
<p>because it was so</p>
<p>ridiculous i just</p>
<p>drank a bunch of</p>
<p>coffee and then just went down there and waited for the</p>
<p>papers to come in</p>
<p>because i had to you know</p>
<p>carry these big bundles and newspapers all day and</p>
<p>stack them and toss them out i would</p>
<p>regularly go till 9 10 in the morning sometimes noon</p>
<p>if the paper was extra big</p>
<p>like sometimes they have a</p>
<p>bunch of inserts yet and you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>carry them all in one load</p>
<p>so i would go out</p>
<p>i would do fifty</p>
<p>houses and they</p>
<p>would come back and do</p>
<p>another fit and i keep doing it over and over and over</p>
<p>again was fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>i bought a van for it and filled up this shitty van the</p>
<p>whole back of it filled it up with newspapers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll never forget that man</p>
<p>worship the hardest</p>
<p>should be to do that summer</p>
<p>were dig ditches</p>
<p>and put tile down</p>
<p>on like twenty one</p>
<p>bedroom units</p>
<p>in the in the summer</p>
<p>in florida who</p>
<p>no ac so you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>on the ground laying tile</p>
<p>and the grout</p>
<p>and then you know it</p>
<p>would take out and you</p>
<p>would just cook in</p>
<p>these one bedroom</p>
<p>no air conditioned units</p>
<p>baking them</p>
<p>and then the dig in the ditch</p>
<p>you would dig ditches for this guy</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>would come by</p>
<p>and be like you can&rsquo;t have ditches in florida</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna flood man</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no such</p>
<p>thing as a ditch</p>
<p>he would just be like you just keep digging them dishes</p>
<p>man like he</p>
<p>would just make</p>
<p>big ditches that like</p>
<p>they were never</p>
<p>gonna be used like they</p>
<p>would have to be</p>
<p>flooded what yeah</p>
<p>it was just like the craziest thing and</p>
<p>man it would take</p>
<p>everything out of you</p>
<p>it was almost</p>
<p>like we were just digging him for his amusement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy it</p>
<p>would kill you man it would kill you with</p>
<p>these things and it would</p>
<p>and lay the tile</p>
<p>man i have so much</p>
<p>that job made me appreciate</p>
<p>every time for the rest of my life</p>
<p>when i walk in a room and i see tile</p>
<p>i think of that every single time i see</p>
<p>i just think of being on these</p>
<p>laying tile</p>
<p>scrape and grout</p>
<p>scrape and grout</p>
<p>in a room that&rsquo;s a hundred and thirty degrees</p>
<p>is dripping</p>
<p>sweat wow that&rsquo;s crazy because i never think of that</p>
<p>yeah every time</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gone to a bathroom i just said well there&rsquo;s some tile</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny i didn&rsquo;t have that connection</p>
<p>one of the few</p>
<p>things i didn&rsquo;t do but i did do</p>
<p>i installed</p>
<p>in installation</p>
<p>insulation in attics</p>
<p>in the summertime in boston</p>
<p>it was goddamn brutal work because</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re up in the attic and you&rsquo;re installing this</p>
<p>insulation and the</p>
<p>insulation is that foam</p>
<p>or that rather</p>
<p>fiberglass pink stuff</p>
<p>and it gets in your pores man it gets in your</p>
<p>mouth it gets in your skin it gets in your eyes</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re laying</p>
<p>it down and you have like a mask on a mask on your face</p>
<p>but it still gets in your eyes</p>
<p>and it gets in your skin</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t wash it out</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re washing it but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still itchy</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d be sitting around</p>
<p>on the couch</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;d done</p>
<p>work and you&rsquo;re out of the shower and you&rsquo;re still like</p>
<p>tingling and itchy and scratchy and</p>
<p>and by the way</p>
<p>you know that shit</p>
<p>sure some particles</p>
<p>get past your mask and get in your fucking</p>
<p>mouth a hundred percent they get in your in your</p>
<p>stomach you have like a physical reaction when you see</p>
<p>insulation no but i remember</p>
<p>you know i look at it and i go out there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i know what that</p>
<p>stuff&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i know somebody got to go through some shit</p>
<p>i did that a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>at a bunch of the gigs you know</p>
<p>cause there was</p>
<p>you know those gigs were</p>
<p>labor jobs and that&rsquo;s what you do you roll that</p>
<p>insulation you be a mindless</p>
<p>moron and roll that</p>
<p>insulation out</p>
<p>so you have to</p>
<p>carry these bundles</p>
<p>up the stairs into the attic</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re like you know it&rsquo;s leaning</p>
<p>against your neck and your face</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing it up there and then</p>
<p>popping open the top of it and unrolling it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hot as fuck and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweating and</p>
<p>there was a guy that i worked with</p>
<p>it was one gig that i got my friend</p>
<p>leroy got me this gig him and his friend</p>
<p>henry had this</p>
<p>they had their own construction company and they were</p>
<p>renovating these terrible buildings in dorchester</p>
<p>dorchester&rsquo;s a real shit neighborhood in boston</p>
<p>and there was this one guy that i worked with</p>
<p>that had a mountain dew bottle</p>
<p>a big two liter mountain dew bottle</p>
<p>filled with beer</p>
<p>and he would just drink it all day he was just hammer</p>
<p>all the time and shaking his hands were always shaking</p>
<p>and the guy just</p>
<p>judge was just drunk all day and they would laugh</p>
<p>about it like that this guy&rsquo;s always drunk</p>
<p>like they knew what he did</p>
<p>and he lived in this house while we were renovating it</p>
<p>he had like i mean it was</p>
<p>the place was like</p>
<p>all exposed walls and</p>
<p>wires hanging everywhere and</p>
<p>staircases and no electricity except</p>
<p>one jury rigged room that he had on the third</p>
<p>floor where he was living</p>
<p>and he had a bed set up there and</p>
<p>you know and the guy</p>
<p>would just be up there just getting fucked up trying to</p>
<p>hide from life</p>
<p>drinking this big fucking</p>
<p>piss warm bottle of of</p>
<p>you know old english</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just giving up all the way it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>oh just you want it just to be over at that point</p>
<p>to me it was fascinating</p>
<p>though i always wanted to be around him as much as i</p>
<p>could i tried to</p>
<p>to be around him all the time</p>
<p>just so just</p>
<p>as a character just try to pay attention to him</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so odd</p>
<p>you know when i was</p>
<p>this is at the time i was eighteen or nineteen</p>
<p>and i remember i was just</p>
<p>thinking how</p>
<p>how does one become this guy this was</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s child</p>
<p>this was some a boy at one</p>
<p>point in time this is how he developed this is here</p>
<p>here he is a</p>
<p>thirty plus year old man and how</p>
<p>old he was but</p>
<p>just hammered</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you when</p>
<p>you see someone you meet somebody that you go</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all they&rsquo;re fucked up like that you go</p>
<p>well everything</p>
<p>definitely wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a okay in that</p>
<p>house bro you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>end up like that if if</p>
<p>things were totally normal at home</p>
<p>i kind of believe that when i meet people that are</p>
<p>fucked up that yet that there was some</p>
<p>serious trauma or at</p>
<p>least perceived from</p>
<p>there has to be</p>
<p>and you know then there&rsquo;s also the genetic</p>
<p>stuff as far as like addiction</p>
<p>you know because some people are much more prone</p>
<p>physically to being addicted to</p>
<p>things yeah i don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about i don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>but i do have a mental addiction issue</p>
<p>i have a severe mental addiction</p>
<p>issue with everything</p>
<p>i can get addicted to anything</p>
<p>i can get addicted to anything that&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a game or a sport or</p>
<p>a martial art</p>
<p>when i start getting into</p>
<p>things i become obsessed</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>completely obsessed</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>started playing pool</p>
<p>eight ten hours a day</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>started doing martial arts</p>
<p>i would train</p>
<p>in taekwondo</p>
<p>three four hours a day but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>could get in</p>
<p>i literally couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>train anymore because my body wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow me to i</p>
<p>would be exhausted</p>
<p>when i started playing</p>
<p>video games same</p>
<p>thing eight ten</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>i just get obsessed</p>
<p>of all the ones you</p>
<p>mentioned i do remember the one that involves sitting</p>
<p>video games yeah</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s some of the most</p>
<p>addictive things</p>
<p>no thank you</p>
<p>powerful they</p>
<p>offer cookies she comes over with an apron</p>
<p>like your mom amazing</p>
<p>but it could be</p>
<p>pussy too pussy&rsquo;s just as easy to get addicted to</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s been many times in my life</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>trying to you know</p>
<p>juggle as many</p>
<p>chicks as possible</p>
<p>thinking what the fuck am i doing like this isn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even want to do this</p>
<p>this is like</p>
<p>an obsession it&rsquo;s just i&rsquo;m being compelled to do this</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m on this</p>
<p>weird path you know this</p>
<p>weird path is</p>
<p>you know trying to get laid</p>
<p>you know and i have friends that</p>
<p>still do that you know i have friends that just</p>
<p>become obsessed</p>
<p>with pussy to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t even have a good time because all they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about is trying to get laid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>mean i&rsquo;m like you can&rsquo;t be this horny</p>
<p>like powerful</p>
<p>thing man we&rsquo;ve all done</p>
<p>stupid shit to get laid yeah</p>
<p>yeah and once they become</p>
<p>successful at it</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like all of a</p>
<p>sudden like oh okay i&rsquo;ve got this</p>
<p>thing wired</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking everybody it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like they&rsquo;re making up for all the lost time</p>
<p>where they were trying</p>
<p>where it was</p>
<p>the guys that i know that became</p>
<p>successful later in life</p>
<p>and girls found them</p>
<p>attractive later in life</p>
<p>those are the guys that are the most sick with it</p>
<p>yeah yeah for sure</p>
<p>guys who got laid when they were younger</p>
<p>they seem to be over it</p>
<p>they could relax</p>
<p>or some of them can</p>
<p>right now but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super common addiction to men you know</p>
<p>especially if</p>
<p>it took a really long like a really long time</p>
<p>yeah you know some guys</p>
<p>really are like</p>
<p>a lot of people out there probably didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>start getting laid</p>
<p>the thirties and</p>
<p>stuff yeah we</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more rare</p>
<p>right than it is and</p>
<p>that guy realizes</p>
<p>this is what i was missing out on yeah</p>
<p>he wants to make</p>
<p>that he wants to make up for that forever yeah you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s easy to become the addiction forever</p>
<p>see the only</p>
<p>difference though the addictions that we just talked</p>
<p>about all of them</p>
<p>are fun as fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>i get addicted to</p>
<p>things that are fun</p>
<p>i got martial</p>
<p>arts it&rsquo;s fun man</p>
<p>being able to</p>
<p>perform you know martial arts being able to</p>
<p>kick somebody in the head or</p>
<p>choke somebody</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some wild</p>
<p>fucking bruce lee</p>
<p>movie shit man to actually be able to do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fun man</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is not fun when you</p>
<p>first start</p>
<p>cause you get mauled a lot</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>keeps me from even fucking trying yeah but that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>it keeps people out it&rsquo;s hard to do i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to get involved that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so fun when you</p>
<p>first learn how to do it well now</p>
<p>what they have a lot</p>
<p>of now that they didn&rsquo;t have then was beginner classes</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>was a beginner there was this one kid that i used to</p>
<p>spar with and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very good that this happened to me because</p>
<p>it made me really</p>
<p>appreciate jiu jitsu</p>
<p>this is one</p>
<p>brazilian kid who used to</p>
<p>choke the fucking</p>
<p>shit out of me this guy stopped</p>
<p>manhand on me</p>
<p>every time we</p>
<p>trained he was ruthless too</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t he wasn&rsquo;t nice to me at all because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically like the same age</p>
<p>you know so it was you were both young</p>
<p>men and he was just getting</p>
<p>off on the fact that even though we were the same size</p>
<p>he could just beat my ass</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>man handle me dude</p>
<p>and it made me really appreciate</p>
<p>like how little i knew</p>
<p>about jujitsu</p>
<p>because i was coming from a place</p>
<p>in kickboxing and in</p>
<p>you know doing muay</p>
<p>thai and doing taekwondo</p>
<p>then i was like really confident with my stand up</p>
<p>like i would</p>
<p>stand i would</p>
<p>spar with anybody</p>
<p>i was real confident with what i was able to do</p>
<p>so i felt like i</p>
<p>could handle myself</p>
<p>against someone my size</p>
<p>but then here</p>
<p>this is guy who&rsquo;s my size who&rsquo;s just raping me</p>
<p>just ragdolling me and just</p>
<p>choking the shit out of me and i was like wow</p>
<p>this is this is some</p>
<p>stuff that i need to</p>
<p>learn like it really made me obsessed with jiu jitsu</p>
<p>well that and</p>
<p>yeah that it</p>
<p>definitely helped</p>
<p>that one guy giving me beatings helped</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m one of</p>
<p>those dudes that</p>
<p>i get obsessed with something because</p>
<p>you know something has to</p>
<p>go off inside my head</p>
<p>to make me obsessed</p>
<p>about it and my obsession was</p>
<p>i wanna be able to do to somebody what this guy can</p>
<p>do to me because that&rsquo;s incredible i can&rsquo;t do that now</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>made me feel helpless too because i was like wow</p>
<p>if this guy was</p>
<p>this was like a</p>
<p>street fight</p>
<p>and this guy wanted to beat my ass like man i</p>
<p>would be really helpless</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s which is a terrible feeling</p>
<p>and especially</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alien feeling when your</p>
<p>whole life you&rsquo;ve been a martial arts</p>
<p>expert and now you</p>
<p>realize like oh no you&rsquo;re not this there&rsquo;s a whole new</p>
<p>thing that you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>so i became obsessed with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu that way but</p>
<p>i kept that</p>
<p>under control</p>
<p>mostly because of injuries when i</p>
<p>first started doing it i had a bad meniscus tear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a bucket handle tear</p>
<p>where it would lock out on me</p>
<p>and when it would</p>
<p>it would it</p>
<p>would lock in</p>
<p>place and was like</p>
<p>super painful man</p>
<p>was really bad and it happened like</p>
<p>every couple of weeks</p>
<p>and so that kept me from getting like too obsessed with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu when i</p>
<p>first got into it</p>
<p>but man like pool</p>
<p>the opposite happened i was injured so</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t do taekwondo when i got obsessed with pool</p>
<p>and i started playing and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched these guys play that were really good</p>
<p>and i just remember</p>
<p>thinking how fuck is it possible</p>
<p>to not miss for a whole game</p>
<p>you know what i mean like you got ran out the</p>
<p>whole table and i became obsessed with it</p>
<p>but had to be able</p>
<p>to do that had to be able to had to be able to run out</p>
<p>well it wouldn&rsquo;t be happy</p>
<p>until i figured out how to</p>
<p>how to break and run out</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fun thing</p>
<p>get good at pool</p>
<p>to be able to</p>
<p>break and run out</p>
<p>um it took a couple of years</p>
<p>i think couple</p>
<p>years i know</p>
<p>i think it took probably two years</p>
<p>of me like really playing all the time</p>
<p>before i could consistently</p>
<p>break it around out that takes real discipline</p>
<p>or obsession</p>
<p>obsession yeah</p>
<p>at least that discipline though</p>
<p>yeah the discipline</p>
<p>is really i&rsquo;ve always had a</p>
<p>weird discipline</p>
<p>i have much more discipline</p>
<p>for things now as</p>
<p>a grown man</p>
<p>than i did when i was</p>
<p>young when i was</p>
<p>young i had</p>
<p>very little discipline but i had a lot of obsession</p>
<p>being a father contributed</p>
<p>to that yeah</p>
<p>yeah you feel like you have more responsibilities</p>
<p>also i understand that with discipline</p>
<p>comes reward</p>
<p>you know that you know you</p>
<p>appreciate things</p>
<p>that you do and manifest and create because</p>
<p>you had to work hard to do them</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>force yourself to work when you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to you like well look i didn&rsquo;t want to work</p>
<p>but bam look what happened</p>
<p>because of that i got this now i accomplished that i</p>
<p>wrote that you know there it is it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>truth the proof that</p>
<p>you have to discipline yourself</p>
<p>because when i was young</p>
<p>um like like with</p>
<p>taekwondo and</p>
<p>those things i i was only was only</p>
<p>about obsession</p>
<p>like my discipline</p>
<p>was not good i was not a disciplined</p>
<p>person i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do a bunch of</p>
<p>stuff that wasn&rsquo;t fun</p>
<p>but i was so obsessed with getting better at martial</p>
<p>arts that it was easy to look disciplined</p>
<p>i got you you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>yeah absolutely</p>
<p>but it was all fun to me so it wasn&rsquo;t really discipline</p>
<p>i was obsessed</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>as you get older you</p>
<p>understand the the rewards of discipline</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing to and it&rsquo;s good to also</p>
<p>have a certain</p>
<p>amount of control at all times over your impulses</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t have any of that when i was young</p>
<p>i was very impulsive</p>
<p>it was so wild</p>
<p>motherfucker you know i was barely raised my parents</p>
<p>were barely around when i was a kid</p>
<p>so yeah i grew up doing wild shit and they</p>
<p>never had a fucking clue they didn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>so i was completely impulsive</p>
<p>you know by the time i had</p>
<p>graduated high</p>
<p>school and then was out on my own</p>
<p>living with my friends</p>
<p>you know by</p>
<p>the time yeah</p>
<p>but i was like 20 or something like that when i</p>
<p>first moved out</p>
<p>when i was living with my friends</p>
<p>we were a bunch of</p>
<p>savages i was living with</p>
<p>these other guys that i did taekwondo with</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fucking wild animals that somehow or another had</p>
<p>escaped from the nest and we&rsquo;re trying to really</p>
<p>yeah live like</p>
<p>grown ups we were like pretending to be grown ups</p>
<p>what made you more discipline</p>
<p>like you needed to get</p>
<p>even better results so you&rsquo;re like i need to become</p>
<p>more discipline</p>
<p>that kind of thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of it yeah</p>
<p>about writing</p>
<p>and really nila realized</p>
<p>the discipline really</p>
<p>came into play with my writing</p>
<p>like sometimes i didn&rsquo;t feel like writing</p>
<p>but you have to</p>
<p>write even if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a professional comic man</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>write like my i have friends that are</p>
<p>professional comments don&rsquo;t actually sit down and write</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re selling yourself</p>
<p>short like all</p>
<p>right on stage</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like yeah i do too</p>
<p>but you got a</p>
<p>right you gotta sit down and you got a</p>
<p>right cause if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re gonna have less ideas you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have less</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve considered you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have less topics to explore</p>
<p>you know and i talked to a</p>
<p>buddy who just</p>
<p>writes in the car he</p>
<p>never writes</p>
<p>but he just</p>
<p>drives around his car and comes up with ideas i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s a method too</p>
<p>but you really</p>
<p>should write</p>
<p>because when you actually sit down and</p>
<p>write something whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a pen to a piece of</p>
<p>paper or whether it&rsquo;s writing in</p>
<p>front of a computer</p>
<p>it takes like</p>
<p>the word strategy</p>
<p>well it takes</p>
<p>much longer to</p>
<p>write the word strategy than it does to consider</p>
<p>the concept of strategy</p>
<p>so while you&rsquo;re writing it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting more thought and more consideration into</p>
<p>things you open more doors when you</p>
<p>write it down</p>
<p>for sure sure for sure</p>
<p>and you you know you</p>
<p>you consider</p>
<p>things more deeply and more carefully and you can</p>
<p>go back and edit them and read them and say</p>
<p>hmm do i like</p>
<p>how this came out do i like how i&rsquo;m saying this</p>
<p>maybe i should say it like this or</p>
<p>maybe i should be</p>
<p>clear about that or</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like you have to</p>
<p>write man you have to it&rsquo;s part of your job</p>
<p>and for a long time i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>when i was on newsradio i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write at all</p>
<p>if there was like two years</p>
<p>where i never</p>
<p>wrote a fucking joke</p>
<p>really yeah i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write shit i was on a sitcom</p>
<p>and i was working all day on the sitcom</p>
<p>especially in the beginning it was long ass</p>
<p>hours what are you</p>
<p>still doing</p>
<p>stand up yeah but</p>
<p>i was half assing it</p>
<p>i was going</p>
<p>up and i was doing the material that i did for years</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;d already</p>
<p>written for years and i had very very little new things</p>
<p>every now and then i have like a</p>
<p>new tagline or something that came up within the moment</p>
<p>but it was probably</p>
<p>the most uninspired period of my comedy ever</p>
<p>was between ninety four</p>
<p>and like ninety six ninety seven</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>first got on sitcom on newsradio</p>
<p>what made you</p>
<p>start writing i bombed once in</p>
<p>front of some writers</p>
<p>did not have a good set</p>
<p>of a couple of the writers from</p>
<p>news radio came</p>
<p>and i had always</p>
<p>felt like when i was doing like a sitcom</p>
<p>especially when i was doing news radio</p>
<p>i always felt like a little bit of a fraud</p>
<p>i always felt like you know i mean even though</p>
<p>i was funny and i</p>
<p>would deliver the lines and get big</p>
<p>laughs and everything like that</p>
<p>i still felt like</p>
<p>like how the hell did i get us on</p>
<p>television like this is ridiculous</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on some nbc sitcom like i&rsquo;m just some loser</p>
<p>you know like that i didn&rsquo;t feel like i deserved it</p>
<p>you know i felt very</p>
<p>very much like i was faking being an actor</p>
<p>like i had never had done any acting</p>
<p>classes i took a few</p>
<p>private acting</p>
<p>classes when i</p>
<p>first got my development deal with disney</p>
<p>but that was</p>
<p>because they wanted me to do it they forced me to do it</p>
<p>and it was also</p>
<p>but i already</p>
<p>had the development deal you know it was just</p>
<p>like they wanted me to get some</p>
<p>coaching and</p>
<p>when i did it i did it with this lady</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like this failed actress</p>
<p>was really gross</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just like she was</p>
<p>gross i didn&rsquo;t i didn&rsquo;t like her i didn&rsquo;t she</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>trying to get a job on the show that i was on</p>
<p>trying to get me to hire her</p>
<p>to play my mom</p>
<p>and i was like it was real creepy</p>
<p>so i felt i always felt like</p>
<p>kind of a little bit of a fraud</p>
<p>and then i had</p>
<p>these guys come to see me</p>
<p>and you know they were good writers man</p>
<p>these guys are from fucking harvard</p>
<p>and i was up real late</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>store it was a late</p>
<p>night spot and it was</p>
<p>a lot of people have been up and there</p>
<p>was almost no one in the audience left when i got on</p>
<p>stage it was a very</p>
<p>small crowd</p>
<p>i had very little energy</p>
<p>and i was nervous that they were</p>
<p>watching me and i ate dick</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>after i had this really shitty</p>
<p>set really mediocre set</p>
<p>i remember thinking i was really embarrassed very</p>
<p>disappointed with myself</p>
<p>and like the fuck man i</p>
<p>gotta i gotta get back to work</p>
<p>and i started writing</p>
<p>again and then</p>
<p>a couple years</p>
<p>later i put out my</p>
<p>album my first</p>
<p>album i&rsquo;m gonna be dead someday and it was really good</p>
<p>it was still to this day well listen to that and you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>i would deliver it differently now</p>
<p>i got more skillful with my delivery and my</p>
<p>setups and i</p>
<p>might have reworded</p>
<p>things and i probably would have</p>
<p>done some editing and make some of the jokes tighter</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m still real pleased with it it was a real good</p>
<p>cd and it probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t if</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have that one set that really embarrassed me</p>
<p>that made me go to work</p>
<p>made you humble yeah</p>
<p>yeah well maybe</p>
<p>aware that i was</p>
<p>slacking off it wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>i was like oh i&rsquo;m the best i don&rsquo;t have to work at it</p>
<p>it was really that was just</p>
<p>living off of this sitcom</p>
<p>thing and you know i was having this</p>
<p>success being on</p>
<p>television and i took for</p>
<p>granted what got me to the dance</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>stand up is</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very rare</p>
<p>thing man and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trance that you put that audience in</p>
<p>and you have to</p>
<p>you have to practice that</p>
<p>trance on a regular basis you have to</p>
<p>get into that groove</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re recording this on an iphone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the coolest fucking</p>
<p>thing that you can just do this</p>
<p>cause it sounds pretty good and when</p>
<p>i showed it to tom there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing called</p>
<p>voice memos</p>
<p>and voice memos is what i use to record all my sets</p>
<p>this bitch cock</p>
<p>blocking mine</p>
<p>fucking podcast and</p>
<p>this voice memo</p>
<p>thing i record all my sets on</p>
<p>so i can always listen</p>
<p>like right before i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to go on stage</p>
<p>and then it puts me sort of like deeper into trance</p>
<p>it makes me</p>
<p>more smooth when i go on</p>
<p>stage it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the more you do comedy</p>
<p>the better you are comedy the more you get into that</p>
<p>groove and the more you listen to yourself do comedy</p>
<p>also the better you get into that groove</p>
<p>and by the way how high are you</p>
<p>right now tommy</p>
<p>cause you look like you&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>pull one of</p>
<p>these emergency exit doors open and fucking leave</p>
<p>straight blazed</p>
<p>we started this podcast</p>
<p>about an hour and i&rsquo;ll tell you right now</p>
<p>an hour and 30 something minutes ago how long</p>
<p>yeah yeah we&rsquo;ve been doing this for over an hour</p>
<p>yeah and in that time i&rsquo;ve watched tommy go from sober</p>
<p>and just a little happy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m ripped to gone</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>considering the</p>
<p>first girl he fingered when he&rsquo;s in the seventh grade</p>
<p>how he probably should have called her and</p>
<p>now she has children and she still probably thinks</p>
<p>about him when</p>
<p>some guy fingers her</p>
<p>right what are you thinking</p>
<p>about right now what are you considering</p>
<p>climbing up rainbows right now</p>
<p>looking for pots of gold</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m having all</p>
<p>kinds of shit run through my head yeah like what</p>
<p>takes me a second to</p>
<p>process what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>as much as i</p>
<p>try to check myself on</p>
<p>a regular basis and be real objective with how i behave</p>
<p>and you know and be you know real oh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry to cut you off but</p>
<p>something has hit me but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>all that stuff</p>
<p>about when you are not writing</p>
<p>as much yeah</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m having all that</p>
<p>but as you say i</p>
<p>start to just criticize myself</p>
<p>wow so listening to you</p>
<p>triggered like</p>
<p>like you know you should</p>
<p>write more you</p>
<p>should do more you should</p>

<p>critical of</p>

<p>before i special</p>
<p>from 30 days out to the day i do it</p>
<p>i just write a new blog post every day</p>
<p>so i was in</p>
<p>front of the computer</p>
<p>every day for six</p>
<p>seven hours</p>
<p>eight hours whatever it took</p>
<p>to bang out a blog post i mean occasionally they were</p>
<p>shorter when</p>
<p>life got in the way but i committed to putting one out</p>
<p>every day and i</p>
<p>wrote it i called it day one day two</p>
<p>and then i started naming them</p>
<p>but i wrote some of my best</p>
<p>stuff from that man</p>
<p>the open letter to kellogg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that was a blog that like a million people read</p>
<p>you know i wrote a letter to</p>
<p>kellogg&rsquo;s after they</p>
<p>got rid of michael phelps</p>
<p>after they fired him as a</p>
<p>spokesperson</p>
<p>but i wrote that as an</p>
<p>exercise it was like i had committed myself to writing</p>
<p>every day for 30 days</p>
<p>and when you do that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sometimes i&rsquo;ll sit in</p>
<p>front of my computer for fucking</p>
<p>four five hours</p>
<p>and all i&rsquo;m doing is looking at</p>
<p>videos of dudes getting</p>
<p>their heads cut off</p>
<p>and oh look</p>
<p>at this pool cue that&rsquo;s for sale wow that&rsquo;s really nice</p>
<p>and oh here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>video on a porsche</p>
<p>gt three going around a racetrack</p>
<p>and now here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a documentary on quantum mechanics and you know what</p>
<p>what entanglement really means and</p>
<p>by the end of the</p>
<p>night i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>did i get anything done i was supposed to sit down and</p>
<p>write you know</p>
<p>oh so easy to do that i mean</p>
<p>you should do some research and some looking at</p>
<p>stuff but god damn you got to do a lot of writing too</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>what it is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total flip of that balance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>where you are writing</p>
<p>as much as you were fucking around yeah you fuck around</p>
<p>as much as you used to</p>
<p>write so you just use the fucking around as a break</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think a normal healthy practice</p>
<p>yeah but you got it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the road to justify it too yeah that&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>fucked up is</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m traveling</p>
<p>traveling i&rsquo;m tired</p>
<p>tired&rsquo;s a huge one yeah because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to just be</p>
<p>tired the whole time</p>
<p>well i write a lot on</p>
<p>planes i write some of my best stuff</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m on a plane</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m forced to sit in the seat i can&rsquo;t go anywhere and</p>
<p>before they had wi fi</p>
<p>on the plane</p>
<p>which they do on this flight this flight is wi fi these</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>tempt us with the dark side but we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>avoided them by</p>
<p>being productive and making a goddamn podcast what what</p>
<p>but yeah i mean i</p>
<p>would write some of my best shit because i</p>
<p>would actually</p>
<p>be forced to do it i&rsquo;m just sitting down there</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great thing i love when i</p>
<p>write something too that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>when i was gonna fuck off</p>
<p>you know like it feels better</p>
<p>on the way back to australia i</p>
<p>wrote this great bit</p>
<p>i wrote this great</p>
<p>piece that i&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>right now and</p>
<p>after i got done looking i was like yes</p>
<p>like i just</p>
<p>fucking made that happen i sat down</p>
<p>that releases adrenaline yeah yeah</p>
<p>i felt so satisfied i felt like</p>
<p>i just you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the relationship between i mean it really</p>
<p>ultimately is</p>
<p>i created something that someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna enjoy that&rsquo;s the real charge that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tricking yourself</p>
<p>into making</p>
<p>things that people gonna</p>
<p>enjoy saying</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>gonna think i&rsquo;m the shit you know and then</p>
<p>you know you create this knowing that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna crush in</p>
<p>front of that</p>
<p>audience you know when you deliver that bit</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the motivation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>trickery going on there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>things that are</p>
<p>tugging at yourself</p>
<p>both healthy and unhealthy as to why you create things</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s nothing like when you</p>
<p>wrote something and you can just</p>
<p>you can hear yourself saying it and it just like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ultimate</p>
<p>satisfaction</p>
<p>and it crushes</p>
<p>oh i got this new line man oh</p>
<p>i remember when i wrote it i</p>
<p>wrote it and i looked down at the keyboard i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i got this like this one just came</p>
<p>and then i went up that</p>
<p>night in brea</p>
<p>and did it and it destroyed</p>
<p>it came out of my mouth</p>
<p>absolutely perfect it was one of</p>
<p>those rare lines</p>
<p>where as you</p>
<p>write it you</p>
<p>write it exactly as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say it</p>
<p>most of the</p>
<p>times it&rsquo;s not how the most of times i have concepts</p>
<p>and i write out the concept and i get way too</p>
<p>verbose cause really what i&rsquo;m considering is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just writing i</p>
<p>write in long form like as a blog entry</p>
<p>and then out of the blogs that&rsquo;s when i pick like</p>
<p>little gems that become bits and figure out how to do</p>
<p>them but this one wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that this one was just one an idea that i had</p>
<p>that what was straight up a joke</p>
<p>right out of the gate</p>
<p>and as soon as i said it on</p>
<p>stage it was perfect</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>tweak it i don&rsquo;t need to do a</p>
<p>thing to it</p>
<p>it just destroyed and i was like wow look at that man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just such a satisfying feeling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you acted as an antenna</p>
<p>and the universe</p>
<p>jolted this idea into your</p>
<p>brain and you</p>
<p>wrote it down because that&rsquo;s what you have to</p>
<p>do if you want to be good at it and then you went up on</p>
<p>stage and delivered it</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thousand</p>
<p>people there to see you and they all went fucking</p>
<p>crazy hearing it</p>
<p>ah it&rsquo;s so fun man</p>
<p>i would never want to be</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing i</p>
<p>would rather do</p>
<p>in life than be a comedian</p>
<p>nothing i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never thought for</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done other</p>
<p>things because they offered me money</p>
<p>like fear factor and</p>
<p>even the ufc i mean i love working for the</p>
<p>ufc i never</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look forward to</p>
<p>fights even</p>
<p>fights like</p>
<p>ultimate fighter finales</p>
<p>where a lot of people don&rsquo;t know who the guys are</p>
<p>fighting i know who they are</p>
<p>i look forward to</p>
<p>every one of them i fucking love it man</p>
<p>but if i had to choose</p>
<p>between that and</p>
<p>never doing</p>
<p>stand up again it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even be a choice it&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>i could always watch the</p>
<p>fights i would i</p>
<p>would enjoy the</p>
<p>fights more</p>
<p>if i was watching them</p>
<p>you know if i was</p>
<p>standing at home and stephen bonner was doing it or</p>
<p>kenny florian was doing my job</p>
<p>i would enjoy it more</p>
<p>because first of all</p>
<p>those guys do a</p>
<p>great job and</p>
<p>second of all i just want to watch the</p>
<p>fight i don&rsquo;t want to have to</p>
<p>elaborate and</p>
<p>explain and predict and call what this guy&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>wrong with this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i like i just want to</p>
<p>watch it i like</p>
<p>watching fights</p>
<p>about myself</p>
<p>you know like i</p>
<p>watch like the k one</p>
<p>fights and all</p>
<p>these and yeah at the most</p>
<p>every now and then i go all</p>
<p>look out for your neck</p>
<p>bitch get your neck down get out</p>
<p>you got them</p>
<p>actually more than</p>
<p>other people really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun though</p>
<p>on some nights though when a big</p>
<p>fight especially to have a bunch of buddies over</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun but i like watching regular games</p>
<p>i like watching them alone</p>
<p>you do really</p>
<p>absolutely sometimes people want to talk too much</p>
<p>right or the games going on i mean</p>
<p>it all matters on which sports</p>
<p>or what level of entertainment to you</p>
<p>like the more that you&rsquo;re into the sport</p>
<p>then it becomes just something like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that like you take it too seriously</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the game</p>
<p>or the sport has some</p>
<p>meaning to you yeah</p>
<p>and you really enjoy you got to be into it</p>
<p>you got to be focused on it and people</p>
<p>start talking about fucking bullshit i hate that girls</p>
<p>girls are terrible some guys are fucking</p>
<p>worse than girls</p>
<p>some guys just fucking like</p>
<p>just talking bullshit to you like you know we use</p>
<p>we knock off</p>
<p>like i just want to</p>
<p>watch the goddamn game i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about some</p>
<p>dudes just want to hear themselves talk they do</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uncomfortable they&rsquo;re so uncomfortable with themselves</p>
<p>they have to make you uncomfortable too you know</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>silent you can&rsquo;t do it man</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do it there&rsquo;s always got to be</p>
<p>noise to drown out that internal dialogue</p>
<p>yeah what do you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>those red sox there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gotta be something</p>
<p>and a lot of times it&rsquo;s a guy that wears a</p>
<p>class ring oh no</p>
<p>guys with class rings man they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>formula for</p>
<p>they are ridiculous fucks they are</p>
<p>totally you are a</p>
<p>silly fuck if you wear a class ring</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>whole lot of</p>
<p>generalizations that i almost</p>
<p>emphatically across the</p>
<p>board support</p>
<p>but that is one</p>
<p>tell you what if</p>
<p>if people who wore</p>
<p>class rings</p>
<p>were considered one race</p>
<p>i would be really racist</p>
<p>i would hate</p>
<p>the class ring race more than any</p>
<p>yeah those are the type of guys that</p>
<p>like stayed around the auto shop parking lot of high</p>
<p>school a couple years</p>
<p>after they graduated they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still coming back</p>
<p>big the chest</p>
<p>pounding guys</p>
<p>yeah a lot of</p>
<p>chest pounders who</p>
<p>chug it chug it chug it</p>
<p>those guys who want you to chug a beer</p>
<p>yep more shots</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get a couple more shots over here that</p>
<p>sounds like me</p>
<p>shots bring the party</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a douchey element yeah</p>
<p>you make the choice for the class ring and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re opening yourself fucking out the</p>
<p>door man you&rsquo;re out bundy without the jokes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just in the shoes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a real live out bundy</p>
<p>that is the truth</p>
<p>you know that guy ed o&rsquo;neal</p>
<p>al bundy is a fucking black belt</p>
<p>jiu jitsu shut the fuck up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legit dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really cool guy man is a</p>
<p>super fucking talented actor yeah he&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>weird that he&rsquo;s like type cast is out bundy</p>
<p>yeah but he&rsquo;s made on that new show on</p>
<p>yeah yeah and he did a movie it&rsquo;s been enough years</p>
<p>but for a long time he was stuck as al bundy you know</p>
<p>but he played that that that</p>
<p>that that caricature kind of became a joke</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the best that is</p>
<p>a fucking amazing job show is brilliant</p>
<p>that show is brilliant yeah that was that&rsquo;s an all time</p>
<p>great sitcom</p>
<p>no doubt about it</p>
<p>i talked to him i flew to</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>once we just happened to be on the same flight</p>
<p>just happened to be sitting</p>
<p>right next to each other yeah</p>
<p>and talk to him the</p>
<p>whole flight over</p>
<p>about jujutsu</p>
<p>loves jujutsu</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a fiend</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big guy too</p>
<p>probably strong as fuck really yeah man</p>
<p>al bundy&rsquo;s no joke</p>
<p>and o&rsquo;neal sorry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>if he was calling me joe gorelli i&rsquo;d be upset</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a lot of whole</p>
<p>like celebrities that get on the mat and</p>
<p>spar with just everybody and anybody</p>
<p>you know most guys don&rsquo;t want to be embarrassed</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i took private lessons at</p>
<p>first for like</p>
<p>fuck man like two years</p>
<p>i wasted all this time only taking private lessons</p>
<p>because i didn&rsquo;t know you got a role with a</p>
<p>bunch of different people to really get good</p>
<p>and then i became friends with eddie</p>
<p>i was a blue belt at the time</p>
<p>i really wasn&rsquo;t good at all it was terrible</p>
<p>and then when i</p>
<p>started taking</p>
<p>classes with him he really</p>
<p>emphasized that</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>spar with other people you have to take</p>
<p>classes there&rsquo;s no way to get</p>
<p>good without it</p>
<p>and i realized that as i</p>
<p>started rolling with better people</p>
<p>i started rolling</p>
<p>with different people i had no idea what i was doing</p>
<p>i had a couple moves</p>
<p>and i hadn&rsquo;t faced enough of a variety of attacks</p>
<p>from different people</p>
<p>like you get used to a certain person&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>like say if one guy has a game</p>
<p>where all he does is</p>
<p>shoots pulls</p>
<p>guard on you</p>
<p>and tries to</p>
<p>submit you off his back</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of that</p>
<p>so all you&rsquo;re doing is trying to</p>
<p>stuff the guard all the time</p>
<p>stuff the guard and pass</p>
<p>stuff the guard and pass</p>
<p>whereas there&rsquo;s another guy who always</p>
<p>tries to get on top</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re like alright this</p>
<p>motherfucker&rsquo;s trying to get on top of me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna keep him off i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna hold him off</p>
<p>i know what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna try to do he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna pull</p>
<p>guard he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>get on top of me</p>
<p>and so you get accustomed to that person&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>and you can kind of like settle into</p>
<p>their game boo</p>
<p>you can settle into</p>
<p>their game and</p>
<p>by the way how fast are your goddamn reflexes</p>
<p>i accidentally</p>
<p>brushed into</p>
<p>tommy&rsquo;s starbucks cup</p>
<p>and before it</p>
<p>moved a half an inch</p>
<p>he moved like the flash</p>
<p>and caught it like in midair</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the weed son</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the weed</p>
<p>helping you out</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sober right there if you were sober you probably</p>
<p>had a big puddle in your lap</p>
<p>you might be right</p>
<p>that was fast i do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu high all the time</p>
<p>really oh yeah</p>
<p>do you roll better please</p>
<p>yeah everybody does</p>
<p>the whole class is high half the time</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s class because</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s like real</p>
<p>open about it you know he&rsquo;s always talking</p>
<p>about how he</p>
<p>smokes weed and how it makes him better jiu jitsu</p>
<p>people have a real</p>
<p>wrong interpretation of weed</p>
<p>and what its</p>
<p>effects are</p>
<p>but it really helps</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>really helps pool</p>
<p>really helps pool</p>
<p>i play a ball better</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>what a ball</p>
<p>better means like if you play a game like nine ball</p>
<p>which is a game</p>
<p>where you play in rotation</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>shoot the balls one in order</p>
<p>if a guy&rsquo;s better than you he&rsquo;s a ball better than you</p>
<p>if a guy&rsquo;s a ball better than you that means he</p>
<p>could spot you the</p>
<p>eight ball you</p>
<p>know like he&rsquo;s good enough that he&rsquo;ll get out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll get an</p>
<p>extra ball in what you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one way of looking at</p>
<p>so when i smoke pot i</p>
<p>literally play a ball better</p>
<p>i could give myself that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t smoke pot the eight ball</p>
<p>really yeah i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>and we jujutsu to</p>
<p>i mean i do just to sober all the time</p>
<p>but i do it high all the time too</p>
<p>and i think i&rsquo;m better when i&rsquo;m high</p>
<p>what opens it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about anything else but the</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you get so</p>
<p>focused you get so</p>
<p>laser beamed into what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and jiu jitsu is all</p>
<p>about feel and rhythm and</p>
<p>being able to achieve that zen</p>
<p>state and i</p>
<p>think marijuana</p>
<p>allows you to achieve that zen state</p>
<p>in almost everything</p>
<p>better than you can on your own</p>
<p>like for sex</p>
<p>marijuana turns me into like</p>
<p>literally like i don&rsquo;t say like an animal</p>
<p>yeah fucker like an animal</p>
<p>but i feel like i don&rsquo;t have a language an animal</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m just primal</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m way more like</p>
<p>way hornier</p>
<p>feels way better when i&rsquo;m high</p>
<p>you know to me it like it really</p>
<p>brings me to that the zen</p>
<p>state of fucking</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>think it does that with comedy</p>
<p>i think it does that with everybody</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>a direction that i choose to go in my mind</p>
<p>while utilizing it it gives you that primal focus</p>
<p>yeah absolutely</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re able to focus more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed it&rsquo;s here for our</p>
<p>evolution that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s here for it&rsquo;s here to get you better at</p>
<p>things it seems</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>the real effect of marijuana isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even from smoking smoking is something they figured out</p>
<p>later on in life</p>
<p>in order to get it into your</p>
<p>bloodstream really quickly</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>smoke it you miss out on a lot of the</p>
<p>stuff that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>right now cause we ate it</p>
<p>this is how a</p>
<p>human supposed to take in marijuana supposed to eat it</p>
<p>when you eat it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>psychedelic drug</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>aging of evolution</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>psychedelic yeah</p>
<p>yeah listen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the end of the podcast</p>
