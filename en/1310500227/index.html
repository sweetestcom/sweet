    <p>The following is a conversation with Travis Stevens,</p>
<p>2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo</p>
<p>and one of the greatest American Judo ever.</p>
<p>But his story is inspiring,</p>
<p>not because of that Olympic medal,</p>
<p>but because of the decades of injury, hardship,</p>
<p>incredible battles against the best in the world,</p>
<p>wrapping up in close heartbreaking losses</p>
<p>at the 2008 and 2012 games,</p>
<p>all of which eventually led to that very silver medal</p>
<p>in 2016.</p>
<p>As we talk about in the podcast,</p>
<p>Travis is also someone who&rsquo;s largely responsible</p>
<p>for me getting into Judo,</p>
<p>for which I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>He also happens to be now my Judo coach and mentor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll release a video of Travis and I</p>
<p>doing some Judo in a few days.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say a few words</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve written down about the Olympic games</p>
<p>and the International Olympics Committee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m visiting family as the T shirt,</p>
<p>but I had to pull away to write and to say these words</p>
<p>because this very video was taken down by YouTube</p>
<p>as per the request of the IOC.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s serious when a Russian takes time away</p>
<p>from family, food and drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m heartbroken to see continued incompetence,</p>
<p>greed and corruption on the part of the IOC</p>
<p>in failing to do as the Olympic charter states,</p>
<p>to quote, ensure the fullest coverage</p>
<p>and the widest possible audience in the world</p>
<p>for the Olympic games, end quote.</p>
<p>I want to give you two facts.</p>
<p>First, they do not make most of the videos of the games</p>
<p>available for replay anywhere that is accessible,</p>
<p>searchable and discoverable,</p>
<p>whether funded by ads or by subscriptions.</p>
<p>For example, on YouTube or their own service,</p>
<p>it is not available anywhere.</p>
<p>Second, in the most absurd violation of the Olympic charter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve uploaded all of the videos of the 2012, 2016</p>
<p>and the 2020 slash 21 Olympics to YouTube.</p>
<p>And they set all of these videos to private.</p>
<p>This results in a situation like my four hour conversation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re watching now with Travis Stevens</p>
<p>being taken down due to us including a few seconds</p>
<p>of a small video overlay of Travis&rsquo;s epic match</p>
<p>against Ole Bischoff in 2012.</p>
<p>This is done automatically as per the request of the IOC.</p>
<p>I have the video due to having screen recorded it from 2012.</p>
<p>Here you have Travis Stevens, an Olympic silver medalist,</p>
<p>someone who spent his entire life overcoming injuries,</p>
<p>losses, hard weight cuts, periods of no financial</p>
<p>or psychological support culminating</p>
<p>in the biggest heartbreak of his career in this one match.</p>
<p>And this match is available nowhere online,</p>
<p>not for free, not for $1 million.</p>
<p>Our showing short clips of it results in the IOC</p>
<p>taking it down, not demonetizing it,</p>
<p>taking it down, blocking it.</p>
<p>The IOC silences this amazing story of Travis Stevens</p>
<p>of heartbreak that eventually led to triumph.</p>
<p>And there are thousands of stories like it,</p>
<p>stories that are supposed to inspire the world.</p>
<p>To me and to billions of others,</p>
<p>the Olympic games give a chance to celebrate</p>
<p>and to be inspired by the greatest stories</p>
<p>of human flourishing in the face of hardship</p>
<p>and incredibly long odds or dominance</p>
<p>in the pursuit of perfection</p>
<p>at levels previously thought to be impossible.</p>
<p>The Olympic games inspire kids like me to dream</p>
<p>and to work hard to achieve in our own lives</p>
<p>the same moments of magic and greatness,</p>
<p>small or big, that the Olympic games reveal.</p>
<p>I believe the members of the IOC are good people,</p>
<p>but people who forgot the dream,</p>
<p>the fire that was sparked and burned in their hearts</p>
<p>when they first saw the Olympics as kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve allowed the gradual corruption</p>
<p>of their own human spirit</p>
<p>and thereby have robbed the world of this very fire,</p>
<p>the fire of the Olympic torch,</p>
<p>the fire that ought to burn in the eyes and hearts of kids</p>
<p>watching the Olympics today,</p>
<p>daring to dream, daring to be great.</p>
<p>Please, please do better.</p>
<p>The world needs you, the world needs the Olympic games.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>Judo is a martial arts, a sport,</p>
<p>a set of techniques, ideas, and philosophies.</p>
<p>Can we start by maybe you giving a big picture overview</p>
<p>of what is Judo to somebody who&rsquo;s like outside</p>
<p>the whole spectrum of grappling sports?</p>
<p>Yeah, Judo was originated in Japan</p>
<p>that was used as a police tactic for self defense</p>
<p>and subduing people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the art of being able to throw somebody to the ground</p>
<p>and hold and control the situation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty much evolved since then though.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s as you include like the sport aspect of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grown to be something more and more dynamic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of gotten away from that.</p>
<p>So the basics is people wear something called a gi,</p>
<p>which I think nicely mimics like outdoor clothing,</p>
<p>like a jacket and they start on the feet</p>
<p>and they get to grip each other</p>
<p>and the scoring works by the more badass the throw is,</p>
<p>the more points you get,</p>
<p>and if you throw the person big and hard on their back,</p>
<p>you win the match and it&rsquo;s over and that&rsquo;s called an Ippon.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is equivalent to a knockout.</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s no knockdowns in Judo.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t count those.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They gotta hit their back and they gotta hit it with force.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge incentive for the big throws.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also the drama of somebody catching you off guard</p>
<p>with a surprise big throw and it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s two ways of losing really.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the, I saw this coming, right?</p>
<p>Like you just, you see it, but you can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>And those ones tend to be the ones you can live with.</p>
<p>The ones that are like really hard to live with</p>
<p>are the ones you never saw coming, right?</p>
<p>Cause that just shows that that person</p>
<p>has really outclassed you.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s like a set of, a small set of throws.</p>
<p>Maybe we can go through them that are like,</p>
<p>you saw it coming, but you couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the set of throws</p>
<p>that are more like surprises.</p>
<p>So first of all, the counters,</p>
<p>or if you fake one thing and go the other way,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a surprise and it&rsquo;s like, oh shit.</p>
<p>You off balance the person because they think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going one way and then you go the other way.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this, oh shit moment.</p>
<p>All of a sudden your back is just slammed on the ground.</p>
<p>One of the ones, I mean, you&rsquo;re good at many throws,</p>
<p>but one of them is a, that I think reveals</p>
<p>the beauty of judo is the foot sweep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the off balance and the timing</p>
<p>that if you catch them right, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I had the same feeling when I went skydiving,</p>
<p>like all of a sudden the ground is not under you anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you just, you go weightlessness</p>
<p>for like a split second and you realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost like all control of your limbs.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like zero gravity, right?</p>
<p>Like you just, you can&rsquo;t turn, you can&rsquo;t rotate,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do much of anything.</p>
<p>And then before you know it, you&rsquo;ve hit the floor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool feeling when you get thrown</p>
<p>because you hope to do the same thing to another person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you just hit the ground hard</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, you didn&rsquo;t see it coming.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a big throw that got loaded up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all of a sudden the surprise.</p>
<p>And then like this, like feeling your back just slams</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like the air is up.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the worst is when you get hit twice</p>
<p>with one throw, right?</p>
<p>Because sometimes like the guy throwing you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t expect you to leave either.</p>
<p>So you hit and then that guy comes down</p>
<p>like a second and a half later and it&rsquo;s like, boom, boom.</p>
<p>And then the wind is just gone from you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are the worst.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the disappointment.</p>
<p>Like then the intellectual, the cognitive part comes in</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, oh shit, I just lost.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have like a connection to why, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;ve just,</p>
<p>like you didn&rsquo;t literally get a concussion.</p>
<p>Like you understand and remember everything,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t figure out how this just happened, right?</p>
<p>Those are the tough ones to deal with.</p>
<p>Actually, have you had moments like that</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t understand how it happened?</p>
<p>You have to watch footage to understand what happened?</p>
<p>Even when you watch it, you&rsquo;re just like, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Like, why wasn&rsquo;t I in a position to stop this?</p>
<p>It makes zero sense.</p>
<p>Conceptually, when you watch it, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I understand how to play defense.</p>
<p>I understand, it looks like I&rsquo;m in a defensive position,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, I still got thrown.</p>
<p>Yeah, you were talking about, what is it, a 2008 match.</p>
<p>You have a non traditional gripping style.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that accurate to say?</p>
<p>And then you were going against another right handed player</p>
<p>and then there was some kind of fake that he did</p>
<p>and then he caught you.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can you describe the throw he caught you with?</p>
<p>He caught me with a drop sale,</p>
<p>but he kind of like, we were engaged.</p>
<p>We were looking at each other</p>
<p>and we were kind of at like a stalemate, right?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t really advance, I couldn&rsquo;t really advance.</p>
<p>And he kind of just let his gaze like wander off</p>
<p>to the right, like he was looking at something.</p>
<p>And then I kind of like, what&rsquo;s over there?</p>
<p>And then I got thrown and it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>So first of all, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Seio&rsquo;s Seinagi drop means when you drop to your knees</p>
<p>and Seinagi is one of the fundamental throws of Judo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a handful, but does that actually ever work?</p>
<p>I always wondered that about like boxing or Judo.</p>
<p>Does the head movement of the person work?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re still like kind of dogs at heart.</p>
<p>If you look somewhere with a dog,</p>
<p>the dog is going to look that direction as well.</p>
<p>Does that actually work ever?</p>
<p>It does, but on a greater sense,</p>
<p>what you try to do is not necessarily get</p>
<p>like a physical reaction of a look,</p>
<p>but a lull of security where like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve almost like relaxed for that split second</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve lured them into like a sense of comfort.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when you can strike.</p>
<p>So you have this, speaking of Seinagi,</p>
<p>you have this gigantic standing Seinagi.</p>
<p>And you have a specific grip.</p>
<p>One of our challenges is there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that listen to the audio version of this.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have to try to describe some of this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best to try to describe with words,</p>
<p>but you have, you grip with your left hand</p>
<p>on the lapel of the jacket or like that area.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s kind of a lean into the person.</p>
<p>And I suppose, is there a feeling of a lull there</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to get to where you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re both calmly dancing</p>
<p>before you turn your hips and go in for the throw?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually trying to create a sense of weightlessness</p>
<p>for my lead leg, which would be my right leg.</p>
<p>And a sense of resistance from my partner.</p>
<p>So aren&rsquo;t you both kind of leaning into each other?</p>
<p>And it creates like an A frame.</p>
<p>But when the A frame is held together at the top half,</p>
<p>which would be my left hand and their right hand</p>
<p>posted on each other&rsquo;s chest,</p>
<p>it means our legs are free to move</p>
<p>and our hips are free to move.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not gonna feel your leg move.</p>
<p>Because of the weightlessness.</p>
<p>And is there a feeling like, for them,</p>
<p>is there a feeling like nothing bad can happen here?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all relaxed, everything&rsquo;s fine?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re standing off at a funny angle</p>
<p>and before they know it, I&rsquo;ve spun</p>
<p>and my back is on their chest and they can&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How did you first develop that throw?</p>
<p>So for people, it&rsquo;s called Ippon Seinagi,</p>
<p>which means your right hand goes under their armpit area.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a vice that connects you to them.</p>
<p>And then they go on for the ride.</p>
<p>The interesting thing with the standing one</p>
<p>is as opposed to drop Seinagi version,</p>
<p>the drop Seinagi, you kind of drop under them.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s a vice,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like pulled under and like over.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With the standing one, I suppose there&rsquo;s some similar physics,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re kind of loading them onto your hip.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re in the air while you&rsquo;re standing still.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lifting them above where they started.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get the really big air.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If obviously, if everything is right.</p>
<p>So how did you first develop that?</p>
<p>How did you first?</p>
<p>I first learned just learning like the very basics</p>
<p>of the throw, you know, foot placement,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then, you know, like anything, the basics are nice,</p>
<p>but once you get good at the basics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to stop,</p>
<p>but it gives you a good like fundamental platform</p>
<p>to learn off of and to expand off of.</p>
<p>And then I expanded when I first started watching Koga,</p>
<p>the new wind, right?</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;s the one that first like introduced</p>
<p>that split hip style Seinagi that I do.</p>
<p>Once I learned that one,</p>
<p>I built about eight different variations of Seio</p>
<p>off that one start position.</p>
<p>That way I could, regardless of your defense,</p>
<p>I had an answer for a throw.</p>
<p>So why that one though?</p>
<p>Why, can you describe love to me, Travis Stevens?</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you fall in love with that throw in particular?</p>
<p>It was really a sense of, you know,</p>
<p>one of my shortcomings as a kid, like,</p>
<p>I hate leg day in the gym.</p>
<p>I hate it with a passion.</p>
<p>I, if you asked me to do a squat, I&rsquo;ll get it done,</p>
<p>but I will bitch and moan every step of the way.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>I remember one time I was at the gym with my trainer</p>
<p>and he goes, okay, we&rsquo;re going to do front squats.</p>
<p>And I want you to put 225 on the bar.</p>
<p>And I was like, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And he was like, what do you mean you can&rsquo;t do that?</p>
<p>And I go, I physically, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And he was like, are you serious?</p>
<p>And I go, yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, he didn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p>We put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out.</p>
<p>And then he was like, okay, let&rsquo;s go down to 185.</p>
<p>And I was like, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I just, that&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>You probably could, strength wise, you just refuse.</p>
<p>I just mentally, I cannot wrap my head around like,</p>
<p>this ain&rsquo;t happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing it.</p>
<p>So I ended up with like 95 pounds on the bar.</p>
<p>I got you at a front squat, no problem.</p>
<p>By the way, body weight squats are rough too, psychologically.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just, when it comes to my legs,</p>
<p>like I want no part of like leg pressing,</p>
<p>single leg squats, split squat,</p>
<p>any of that, I want no part of it.</p>
<p>So you think like the more traditional variants</p>
<p>of Sanagi require you to have that leg strength,</p>
<p>that mass.</p>
<p>Like when you watch Japanese Judo players,</p>
<p>like their thighs and their hips, they&rsquo;re thick.</p>
<p>They got a lot of power there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re almost like always dropping a little bit</p>
<p>into a squat position.</p>
<p>For mine, never.</p>
<p>No, no, no, not you, sorry.</p>
<p>For the traditional ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so the split hip,</p>
<p>the split hip actually allows me to keep my legs straight.</p>
<p>And the farther I split my legs,</p>
<p>the lower my center of gravity goes.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t need my legs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way you were thinking about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, the interesting thing about it</p>
<p>is because, you know, as I mentioned to you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to Judo after first watching you</p>
<p>in the Olympics and then watching Koga as well.</p>
<p>And so you start imitating the people you foresee</p>
<p>and then you take it to Judo coaches</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>And happens all the time.</p>
<p>It drives me nuts, drives me nuts.</p>
<p>I was in Poland one time teaching a camp</p>
<p>and I had two coaches anti coaching,</p>
<p>telling their kids not to do Seio the way I do it</p>
<p>because it never works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>How do you have the fortitude and the guts</p>
<p>to just go on with a throw that&rsquo;s not traditional,</p>
<p>a variant that&rsquo;s not traditional?</p>
<p>If you think about it, you know,</p>
<p>from a very basic like root of it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a philosophy and a mentality of Judo</p>
<p>of how the throws work, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mechanical structure there of like,</p>
<p>this makes sense.</p>
<p>If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>As long as we follow those core principles.</p>
<p>So in the early days, even then,</p>
<p>you were able to think on your own.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern</p>
<p>for my foot placement based on my opponent&rsquo;s height.</p>
<p>Because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you</p>
<p>is you need your center of gravity below yours.</p>
<p>Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet</p>
<p>because the shorter you are, the bigger the split</p>
<p>because the lower I need to get.</p>
<p>The taller you are, the less of a split I need.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say</p>
<p>about fundamental principles of Judo?</p>
<p>Is there, over all that time,</p>
<p>not over 20 years that you&rsquo;ve been doing Judo,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not approaching 30, is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a couple years away, but it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>Is there some like principles that have emerged?</p>
<p>Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity</p>
<p>below theirs.</p>
<p>Is there other kind of, both on the gripping side,</p>
<p>the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some that have withstood like time,</p>
<p>like you have to be able to get below</p>
<p>their center of gravity</p>
<p>because you have to be able to rotate them</p>
<p>around their center of gravity.</p>
<p>And then the other one is,</p>
<p>that was always a principle when I was growing up</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t change until later on in my career was,</p>
<p>you have to be able to pull.</p>
<p>You need to be able to pull to get them off balance.</p>
<p>But when you think about that statement as a whole,</p>
<p>it ended with, they have to be off balance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to pull to get you off balance.</p>
<p>I just need you off balance.</p>
<p>And when you think about it that way,</p>
<p>it allows you to open up the doors to,</p>
<p>what do I need to do to get you off balance?</p>
<p>I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake,</p>
<p>and you could put yourself in your own off balance state.</p>
<p>When you think about people who wrestle,</p>
<p>if I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;re off balance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pull, there&rsquo;s no push, there&rsquo;s no nothing.</p>
<p>I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity</p>
<p>in the door open for an attack.</p>
<p>And that off balance could be very subtle?</p>
<p>Could be very subtle.</p>
<p>And the better you get and the more skills you get,</p>
<p>the less subtle it is.</p>
<p>So we should also mention that there is something called</p>
<p>forward throws, where you throw the person,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna fly facing forward,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna fly forward.</p>
<p>And then a backward throw, they&rsquo;re gonna fly back.</p>
<p>Yep, and then there&rsquo;s lateral,</p>
<p>they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost.</p>
<p>Okay, so the forward throws,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is Seinagi, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of different variants,</p>
<p>Ippon, Marote, Seinagi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s drop and there&rsquo;s standing versions of them.</p>
<p>And that all, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a way to summarize it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like as clean as getting your center of gravity</p>
<p>under theirs as it gets.</p>
<p>And then the rest is just gripping variations.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s all gripping variations</p>
<p>on all of these throws, but.</p>
<p>And then there is, in terms of forward throws,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the other big one in competition is Uchimata,</p>
<p>which is, I don&rsquo;t know, we can try to explain that one.</p>
<p>But it ends up being where one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re standing on just one of your feet,</p>
<p>and the other one is up in the air.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you would put in that same category,</p>
<p>Harai Goshi, like those kinds of throws</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of a little bit single footed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s two footed techniques</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s single footed, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, Goshi, where it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing a mix</p>
<p>between the Uchimata and the Seinagi.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hug.</p>
<p>You hug a person and then you turn your hips around</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re now hugging facing the same direction.</p>
<p>When it comes to forward throw,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, regardless of the name of the throw</p>
<p>or the gripping variation that you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>the whole principle is how do I get this person</p>
<p>to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?</p>
<p>The more of a forward roll I can get, the bigger the score.</p>
<p>If I get like a quarter of a turn</p>
<p>where like you land on your side</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t go over your back, it&rsquo;s a half score.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they all require me to get you</p>
<p>to do that forward rolling action.</p>
<p>So just if we think of one person,</p>
<p>if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll</p>
<p>and their back nicely rolls over the ground,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do the exact same thing</p>
<p>with you connected to them.</p>
<p>Well, and if it&rsquo;s nice and it&rsquo;s smooth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not a full score.</p>
<p>It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So if you think of a drop, say Nagi,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no direct impact, it&rsquo;s only a half score.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They want the force.</p>
<p>The force, the violence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then in terms of backward throws, the traditional ones,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff where you trip them from outside their body,</p>
<p>like Osoto gari.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg</p>
<p>and you trip them, but your hook goes outside of their legs.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the trips from inside their body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a one foot is called kuchi gari</p>
<p>and then the other is ochi gari, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The most important thing is outside and inside.</p>
<p>Inside and then there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how you throw them sideways</p>
<p>except foot sweeps.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the foot sweeps</p>
<p>where you can sweep one of their legs from out of them</p>
<p>or both their legs at the same time.</p>
<p>And like we&rsquo;re talking about this kind of is</p>
<p>when timed perfectly, it&rsquo;s effortless for everybody involved</p>
<p>and the ending, like you said, is big, dramatic and violent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there other kind of, oh yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sacrifice techniques.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of them.</p>
<p>And that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically you, the attacker fall onto your back,</p>
<p>sticking your legs somewhere onto their body,</p>
<p>which is like this fulcrum over which they fly</p>
<p>and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned.</p>
<p>You basically sacrifice your back to the mat</p>
<p>in order to throw them into that circular pattern.</p>
<p>So they hit their back.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use a foot,</p>
<p>sometimes we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so we should probably say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay for you to go onto your back</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re clearly demonstrating control</p>
<p>over the other person&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go to your back in the same direction</p>
<p>that your opponent is trying to put you to your back.</p>
<p>You have to go the other way</p>
<p>or you have to initiate you going to your own back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like clearly.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all the counters</p>
<p>which almost kind of have a whole group of their own,</p>
<p>even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques,</p>
<p>it seems like they&rsquo;re their own whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they follow the same principles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just most counters.</p>
<p>Like if you wanted to counter Ennuchi Mata, for example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to throw me in a somersault</p>
<p>over my right shoulder.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would counter you</p>
<p>by throwing you over your left shoulder.</p>
<p>It goes in the opposite shoulder direction,</p>
<p>but in the same somersault idea.</p>
<p>And there used to be, I already at this point,</p>
<p>forget the years, but it might be before the 2012 Olympics</p>
<p>where they banned, you used to be allowed to grab legs</p>
<p>in the same way you do in wrestling.</p>
<p>So you have basically all the techniques</p>
<p>you would have in wrestling available to you</p>
<p>if you would like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that some of the techniques in wrestling</p>
<p>are not that effective</p>
<p>for getting your opponent to their back.</p>
<p>Wrestlers wanna take the other person down</p>
<p>in any way possible and have control.</p>
<p>Judo wants to take you down, like we said,</p>
<p>in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to be to the back.</p>
<p>A lot of wrestling takedowns happen</p>
<p>because they get behind them and then they parterre out.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but Judo banned all touching of the legs,</p>
<p>which is a very dramatic change at the sport.</p>
<p>But after 2012.</p>
<p>After, it was after 2012?</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games</p>
<p>and everything was free.</p>
<p>In 2012, we could only touch the legs</p>
<p>as a defensive action or in response to an attack.</p>
<p>So I could try to throw you with a normal throw</p>
<p>and then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there had to be a secondary technique.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t, like, didn&rsquo;t they disqualify</p>
<p>on a first offense?</p>
<p>First offense was a direct disqualification,</p>
<p>which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian</p>
<p>who won in 16.</p>
<p>She was DQed and I think the quarters.</p>
<p>And it was like, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was blatant</p>
<p>as much as I don&rsquo;t think the act changed the outcome</p>
<p>of the match had they not disqualified her.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not that dramatic.</p>
<p>And by the way, you say 57, that refers to weight divisions</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in kilograms and kilograms is the measure</p>
<p>of weight that the rest of the world uses</p>
<p>and the United States does not.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s, we should say the divisions for guys,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the 70, I don&rsquo;t know if the lower level,</p>
<p>60.</p>
<p>60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight,</p>
<p>which has no ceiling.</p>
<p>No ceiling, as we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important distinction.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is an important distinction.</p>
<p>And you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>All, you never did 73.</p>
<p>I never did 73.</p>
<p>Well, you had to cut big for 81 anyway,</p>
<p>especially towards the end of my career, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I overly grew into the division.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m trying to remember, is it about 180 pounds?</p>
<p>178.6, I think.</p>
<p>And you have to weigh in with the gear.</p>
<p>No, nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to wear anything</p>
<p>except for your underwear, weigh in.</p>
<p>Confusing digits, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s which is very nice.</p>
<p>Okay, so we, would you say we covered</p>
<p>most of the throws or no?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the forward and the backward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the sacrifice throws and the counters.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the leg grabs.</p>
<p>And we should say for the leg grabs that were effective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the big pickups</p>
<p>where you just kind of pick them up</p>
<p>and try to figure out once they&rsquo;re in the air</p>
<p>what the heck to do with their body</p>
<p>to get them to the ground.</p>
<p>You just kind of figure it out as you go.</p>
<p>I think the really nice one</p>
<p>that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy go</p>
<p>is I guess what&rsquo;s called a fireman&rsquo;s carry,</p>
<p>which is, it does lead to judo like beautiful throws.</p>
<p>And the fact that that was gone is,</p>
<p>that one I missed a little bit,</p>
<p>but then a bunch of people I guess came up with the variance</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t need to grab the leg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not as effective as being able to grab it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also on the side of the fence</p>
<p>having competed in all three.</p>
<p>It was definitely better for the sport</p>
<p>to remove it as a whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably good to cover sort of</p>
<p>the whole spectrum of rules of judo</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s groundwork.</p>
<p>So you do all this stuff on the feet</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to murder each other</p>
<p>with a giant throw.</p>
<p>But then if the throw doesn&rsquo;t succeed,</p>
<p>you go to the ground and you stay in the ground</p>
<p>for some amount of time, like short amount of time.</p>
<p>You have to move quickly, you have to be attacking.</p>
<p>And two of the ways you can win</p>
<p>is similar to people who do jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is you can submit them, chokes, arm breaks,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, no footlocks.</p>
<p>And you can also pin them,</p>
<p>which is get around their legs.</p>
<p>And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling.</p>
<p>You have to actually get around their legs</p>
<p>and pin them in what in jiu jitsu is called</p>
<p>side control mount, all kinds of ways</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t involve their legs.</p>
<p>And then you pin them for like whatever,</p>
<p>20 seconds, 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah, 20 seconds now.</p>
<p>I think the distinction is their back</p>
<p>has to be facing the mat.</p>
<p>You have to be past their legs</p>
<p>and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily be on top,</p>
<p>but it has to be on the same plane.</p>
<p>And all of this is, I think different sports</p>
<p>have different versions of this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like an approximation</p>
<p>of what dominance looks like.</p>
<p>So pin and wrestling is dominating your opponent.</p>
<p>Presumably if you were in a street fight,</p>
<p>that position allows you to then do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Obviously submissions is dominance</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re breaking their arm or choking them to unconscious.</p>
<p>And then obviously the throw,</p>
<p>which is not often talked about,</p>
<p>but like if you talk about a street fight situation,</p>
<p>a throw is like the best way to murder somebody.</p>
<p>Like this could end anyone&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying actually.</p>
<p>So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance.</p>
<p>So going back to set of principles,</p>
<p>you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs,</p>
<p>which I think applies for type of like the forward</p>
<p>say Nagi throws, is there other stuff?</p>
<p>Oh, so you mentioned off balance.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s the off balance one</p>
<p>where you can either pull to get an off balance</p>
<p>or you can give way to the force,</p>
<p>which can also lead to an off balance.</p>
<p>You can amplify somebody&rsquo;s force to,</p>
<p>so for example, if you push me,</p>
<p>you expect a certain reaction that you&rsquo;re ready for.</p>
<p>But if you push me and I pull you,</p>
<p>now you didn&rsquo;t expect that much force coming out of you.</p>
<p>Therefore you&rsquo;re off balance.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s distinctly recognizable about Judo</p>
<p>is like when done at the highest level,</p>
<p>like it seems effortless when the big throw happens.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there is no other sport like it in the combat sports</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like when the timing is right,</p>
<p>everything just is perfect.</p>
<p>I think you get that out of my mate</p>
<p>and boxing sometimes when this is a perfect strike,</p>
<p>just like, but it&rsquo;s not just like a hard hit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like with Conor McGregor and Aldo,</p>
<p>for example, when you just catch him just right.</p>
<p>Just right.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t look like you hit him that hard,</p>
<p>but you hit him just right.</p>
<p>And then you get to see this all the time in Judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And so the beginning part of that</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s a jacket,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also this whole thing that you&rsquo;re a master of,</p>
<p>which is like, which is gripping.</p>
<p>So is there something you could say about,</p>
<p>are there some fundamental principles of gripping</p>
<p>that you can speak to?</p>
<p>Like what the hell is gripping?</p>
<p>Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent</p>
<p>in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive</p>
<p>and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a distinction because I can hold you</p>
<p>in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive,</p>
<p>but if you can take a purely defensive grip</p>
<p>and then I can&rsquo;t be offensive, we are no longer gripping.</p>
<p>We are holding each other.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so like that would be the act of being able to grip</p>
<p>is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you,</p>
<p>and I can play both offense and defense at the same time</p>
<p>where you can only play defense.</p>
<p>So Donaher talks about like Jiu Jitsu that way,</p>
<p>and not that way,</p>
<p>but maybe you can see if there&rsquo;s a distinction.</p>
<p>So you have a set of weapons.</p>
<p>The other person has a set of weapons.</p>
<p>You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons</p>
<p>and shut down the set of weapons that they have.</p>
<p>Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?</p>
<p>I do if we wanna include body positioning</p>
<p>with our gripping.</p>
<p>Because I can give you any grip you want</p>
<p>and you still can&rsquo;t throw me.</p>
<p>Because I can put myself in a position</p>
<p>that nullifies your ability to use those grips</p>
<p>in a successful way.</p>
<p>And those, would you say the hips are critical to that</p>
<p>or is it everything?</p>
<p>Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position,</p>
<p>the angle of your foot.</p>
<p>Yeah, where you lean.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>And so, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of places you can grip.</p>
<p>Obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a bunch of places you can grip</p>
<p>that are interesting.</p>
<p>So you can grip on the collar,</p>
<p>you can grip on the sleeves,</p>
<p>you can grip like the elbow joint.</p>
<p>And then you could do those bad ass,</p>
<p>like Eastern European, Georgian, over the back.</p>
<p>Over the back, over the opposite sides of the heads.</p>
<p>The Koreans that grab on one side</p>
<p>around the head with their hands together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really nice about just those,</p>
<p>I mean, especially George just keeps throwing that hand.</p>
<p>Just over the person and just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually gripping a belt or anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gripping just the entirety of like,</p>
<p>as opposed to being all nice</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna grab this part of the jacket,</p>
<p>this part of the jacket.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like taking the whole fucking jacket</p>
<p>and just launching somebody.</p>
<p>For those people that can&rsquo;t picture judo,</p>
<p>think about it in like,</p>
<p>if you understood like what a boxing match looks like,</p>
<p>and you thought about that as like traditional gripping,</p>
<p>when you throw like a Russian grip over the back,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more like a hockey fight.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just grabbing you and we&rsquo;re just gonna,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be throwing punches left and right.</p>
<p>Cause when we have that grip,</p>
<p>somebody has to get thrown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, we don&rsquo;t walk around with this grip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s go time once somebody throws it.</p>
<p>To me, as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two styles of Olympic level judo.</p>
<p>One is where you&rsquo;re trying not to get thrown.</p>
<p>And the other is where you&rsquo;re trying to throw.</p>
<p>More specifically, when you&rsquo;re trying not to get thrown,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like the strategy that you&rsquo;re using gripping</p>
<p>to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being very clever and strategic and all that,</p>
<p>maybe using conditioning.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people who just like step in the pocket</p>
<p>and they almost don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re getting thrown</p>
<p>cause they have the confidence</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna throw first.</p>
<p>And those, like there&rsquo;s a clear distinction</p>
<p>between the people that do one or the other.</p>
<p>And I think both can be done extremely successfully</p>
<p>at the highest level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, obviously you admire the people</p>
<p>that step in the pocket.</p>
<p>And I think when you look at the people</p>
<p>who do judo the best,</p>
<p>like if we wanna talk about like the top 10%</p>
<p>of the people who would compete at the games,</p>
<p>they do both.</p>
<p>And they do both really well, but they favor one.</p>
<p>Because if you look at a player like</p>
<p>Lutepe Tilliani of Georgia, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy that stands in the pocket.</p>
<p>But we can find numerous occasions</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s hustled some people</p>
<p>for like a short period of time</p>
<p>to get out of scenarios, to elongate the match,</p>
<p>to make somebody tired.</p>
<p>So you want both sides of the coin,</p>
<p>but you better pick the one that 80% of your strategy</p>
<p>is gonna be built around.</p>
<p>Sorry for the romantic question,</p>
<p>but I talked to Dan Gable</p>
<p>and he always looked to the Russians</p>
<p>as the artists in wrestling.</p>
<p>And he always wanted to be an artist.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s known for being that sort of guts,</p>
<p>aggression, mental toughness guy,</p>
<p>but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know when you just watch you,</p>
<p>because it looks like you&rsquo;re aggressive</p>
<p>and you got the guts and the mental toughness,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also obviously a mastery of technique.</p>
<p>Which would you lean towards in terms of</p>
<p>what accounts for your success</p>
<p>and just the way you approach judo?</p>
<p>Is it the guts, the aggression, the mental toughness,</p>
<p>or is it the mastery of technique, the artistry?</p>
<p>Mine would be my aggressiveness</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna pick those two areas.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a third area in there</p>
<p>that I would put myself in where I&rsquo;m more of a strategist.</p>
<p>I look at all of my opponents</p>
<p>and all I ever see is their faults.</p>
<p>And the way I do judo is built around their faults.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, I put myself in scenarios</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t even know how I&rsquo;m gonna win.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve done in those scenarios is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made it very difficult for you to win.</p>
<p>And then I figure out the rest as I go.</p>
<p>Like how do you study an opponent?</p>
<p>Are there bins you can put them in?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lefty and a righty or this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>How many bins are there in judo in your mind</p>
<p>that you put your opponents in?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s probably about 20.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like certain players who you could put</p>
<p>in a category of like, they&rsquo;re only good</p>
<p>for the first two thirds of the match.</p>
<p>After that, they turn into a different player</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re either falling into a sense of panic</p>
<p>or uncertainty.</p>
<p>And you can, if you were to take a video clip</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s say Church&rsquo;s Philly, right?</p>
<p>They got Georgia and I beat in the Olympic semi.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s somebody that would beat you</p>
<p>in the first three minutes.</p>
<p>And if you clipped out all of his matches</p>
<p>and you only watched the first three minutes</p>
<p>of every match, you would see one style.</p>
<p>If you found all the matches where he got taken</p>
<p>into the last minute and he wasn&rsquo;t winning by a major score,</p>
<p>you would see a completely different fighter.</p>
<p>And so going into like my Olympic semi,</p>
<p>I put him into that category of like,</p>
<p>I wanna get to this guy, cause this guy is beautiful.</p>
<p>The trick is, how do you get there?</p>
<p>How do you get there?</p>
<p>And by the way, we&rsquo;re talking about the 2016 Olympics</p>
<p>where you won the silver medal.</p>
<p>You were part of three different Olympics.</p>
<p>But the cardio aspect of it,</p>
<p>have you faced exhaustion often in your matches</p>
<p>where you have to go deep and go like past?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s not from the judo side of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from like, I did a very bad job of making weight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the weight cut.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always the weight cut.</p>
<p>And I think people really struggle with that.</p>
<p>They blame cardio and training and everything else.</p>
<p>But when it really comes down to it,</p>
<p>like we train for an hour and a half, two hours,</p>
<p>twice a day.</p>
<p>How are you tired after five minutes?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right, it becomes into a mental struggle,</p>
<p>your anxiety, your stress, your lack of belief in yourself.</p>
<p>Or in my case, sometimes it&rsquo;s poor nutrition.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had one too many McDonald&rsquo;s meals.</p>
<p>It just, it happens.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about weight cutting real quick.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen weight cutting break</p>
<p>some of the toughest fighters, wrestlers, grapplers ever.</p>
<p>Like burnout break,</p>
<p>like where it makes you wanna quit the sport.</p>
<p>So this is what people don&rsquo;t often talk about,</p>
<p>but mentally it&rsquo;s one of the hardest things,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re doing it kind of wrong.</p>
<p>Because it becomes a mental war.</p>
<p>So you competed, like you said,</p>
<p>your whole career at 81 kilograms.</p>
<p>You walked around at?</p>
<p>88, 89.</p>
<p>So about 15 pounds, sometimes 20 pounds over that.</p>
<p>Give or take.</p>
<p>And so what was your process like mentally and physically?</p>
<p>First of all, maybe you can comment on</p>
<p>when the weigh ins are relative to the matches.</p>
<p>And then what was your process like leading</p>
<p>like a week ahead, a day ahead,</p>
<p>an hour ahead, minutes ahead of the weigh in?</p>
<p>Man, everyone varies tremendously</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not like most sports</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re dropped off in foreign countries</p>
<p>with who knows what, right?</p>
<p>Some places have saunas, some places have treadmills.</p>
<p>I went to a place one time in China</p>
<p>in the middle of winter where the roads were frozen with ice</p>
<p>and we had to use our hotel rooms</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t sweat outside</p>
<p>because it was too cold.</p>
<p>And every one of my Olympics,</p>
<p>the weight cut was different just given my mass.</p>
<p>When I went to 2008,</p>
<p>I was probably like 82, 83 kilos walking around.</p>
<p>So weight cutting wasn&rsquo;t a thing for me.</p>
<p>In London, we actually weighed in the morning of.</p>
<p>So weigh ins were at like 6 a.m.</p>
<p>And the Olympics were always beneficial to me</p>
<p>because they actually don&rsquo;t start until like 10 or 11.</p>
<p>So you actually were able to recover.</p>
<p>Where on the circuit you would weigh in at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>and the competition started at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I was cutting weight at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>And most of it for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>but maybe you can also correct me,</p>
<p>most of it, you&rsquo;re really just getting the water</p>
<p>out of your system.</p>
<p>It was water cut.</p>
<p>At that point, yeah.</p>
<p>Like 24 hours before even, like.</p>
<p>So are you?</p>
<p>Like an hour before.</p>
<p>But yeah, but like leading up to it.</p>
<p>And have you eaten the day before?</p>
<p>Do you try to minimize the amount of food in your system?</p>
<p>My weight cutting process was a little bit different</p>
<p>than most people because I like to eat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the type of person that believes</p>
<p>your athletic career is determined by your nutrition.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>I think some sports are built that way.</p>
<p>But when it comes to combat sports,</p>
<p>like, you know, your ability to knock somebody out</p>
<p>has nothing to do with whether you had a cheeseburger</p>
<p>or a salad.</p>
<p>My ability to throw you is not determined by that.</p>
<p>I may be able to perform better</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve eaten a certain way,</p>
<p>but not enough to justify an entire diet change.</p>
<p>Your body is built and my body is built</p>
<p>to operate with certain things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had in my system for years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m with you,</p>
<p>but I also believe that there&rsquo;s a mental aspect.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re surrounded by people</p>
<p>that tell you diet matters,</p>
<p>then if your diet is off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna believe you&rsquo;re going to be off</p>
<p>because the people around you tell you</p>
<p>your diet should be good.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same, I&rsquo;ve had an argument with Matthew Walker,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a sleep scientist about sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if you believe sleep is essential,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essential to get eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>every single night perfectly,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to be very stressed when you don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And then I think it will negatively affect,</p>
<p>the stress will negatively affect your longevity</p>
<p>and all kinds of aspects of your life.</p>
<p>If you actually just learn to truly listen to your body,</p>
<p>become a scientist of your own body with sleep and food,</p>
<p>it might end up that it will be the eight hours a night</p>
<p>or whatever, but it might be something else</p>
<p>and probably diet error.</p>
<p>I remember when I was meeting</p>
<p>with the USOC nutritionist after London,</p>
<p>it was probably around 2014, I think.</p>
<p>And when we had our team meeting</p>
<p>at the beginning of the year and I was talking to him,</p>
<p>he was talking about the nutrition plans</p>
<p>that he could put us on.</p>
<p>And I was like, time out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done the USOC thing, like I&rsquo;ve done the couscous,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done the lemon in my water.</p>
<p>I go, I&rsquo;m full of shit.</p>
<p>The couscous?</p>
<p>The couscous? Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Like there was just,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s like a cookie cutter plan, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, look, here&rsquo;s what I want you to do.</p>
<p>I go, I&rsquo;ll listen to you,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to walk into the 711</p>
<p>across the street from the USOC.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t buy it in that 711, it&rsquo;s not on my plan.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I go, because I go to places where</p>
<p>the only thing I can eat is Pringles and a Snickers bar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve flown to Azerbaijan,</p>
<p>stayed in a hotel where the restaurant is closed.</p>
<p>USA Judo hasn&rsquo;t paid for the meal plan.</p>
<p>And the only thing that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>is the thing across the street.</p>
<p>So you were eating Pringles.</p>
<p>Before fighting a Grand Slam event,</p>
<p>while cutting 20 pounds.</p>
<p>And a Snickers bar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just, the visual of that, that&rsquo;s some like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some Rocky shit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Give me a nutrition plan.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m not paying my own way</p>
<p>to travel with 14 days of food.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s one of the magic of your whole career</p>
<p>and also Judo.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, of course,</p>
<p>you want athletes to be super rich</p>
<p>and super well funded from an athlete perspective</p>
<p>and the sport to be popular and managed</p>
<p>in an ultra competent way.</p>
<p>But as a fan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not reality.</p>
<p>But as a fan, it&rsquo;s fun to watch somebody like you</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s exceptionally driven,</p>
<p>has to suffer in all these different interesting ways.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only suffering if you expect the other side.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect it.</p>
<p>I accept it for what it is,</p>
<p>which is why I write off nutrition for athletes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Cause it can be done without it.</p>
<p>As long as, you know, to what you said before,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t believe you need it.</p>
<p>Some people believe they need it.</p>
<p>The mind, getting your mind right</p>
<p>is the most important thing.</p>
<p>You know what I believe I need?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>A Snickers bar when I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>I want a little bit of sugar.</p>
<p>It makes me feel better.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>So you,</p>
<p>what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just love the visual of you eating a Snickers bar</p>
<p>before a grand slam.</p>
<p>But that became part of my nutrition plan.</p>
<p>When the USOC guy wrote my nutrition plan,</p>
<p>I was eating a burrito bowl with brown rice,</p>
<p>white meat chicken, black beans, guacamole, cheese,</p>
<p>two chocolate chip cookies and a Diet Coke.</p>
<p>This is like Chipotle or?</p>
<p>It was Beloco, but same concept.</p>
<p>Same concept with two chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Cause I needed the sugar.</p>
<p>I was,</p>
<p>I was 88 kilos when I stepped on the scale</p>
<p>at 6.3% body fat.</p>
<p>Now I got to make 81.</p>
<p>Six, what?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the USOC was like,</p>
<p>Hey, you know, you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t fight 81 anymore.</p>
<p>You have to fight nineties.</p>
<p>And I go, I&rsquo;m already into the quad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not changing.</p>
<p>I go, build me a plan where I can do this.</p>
<p>And now we have to have an acceptable weight cut.</p>
<p>Like it just, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the IJF.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just change the fact that it takes two years</p>
<p>to qualify.</p>
<p>I know where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>I know what I have to go through</p>
<p>and I accept the consequences.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>All right, so what was the process?</p>
<p>I mean, can you, can you speak to,</p>
<p>so you, you wake up early in the morning,</p>
<p>the day of the weigh ins, a few hours before.</p>
<p>Technically my weight cut never started</p>
<p>until I got off a plane and to a hotel.</p>
<p>And how many hours?</p>
<p>Three days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a three day cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a three day cut.</p>
<p>Mentally you&rsquo;re thinking of it that way.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re still eating.</p>
<p>I eat every day.</p>
<p>And then like, what do you load up on water?</p>
<p>Maybe as you start and then the water stops.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>So you, I mean, it&rsquo;s a slow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually like sweating all three days.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s like torture to sleep.</p>
<p>Part of the process.</p>
<p>Are you able to sleep?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re dehydrated, further and further dehydrated</p>
<p>with six, 7% body fat, trying to lose 10 pounds.</p>
<p>I even developed a way to drink water out of a bottle</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t drink anything,</p>
<p>but I feel like I have swishing it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, no.</p>
<p>So like, I take like a bottle of water</p>
<p>and like, if we were to like, to draw a line on it,</p>
<p>I would tip it and I would go like this.</p>
<p>I would go.</p>
<p>And you would draw that line,</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;ve drank now water for 20 seconds or whatever</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>And I feel, I get the fix.</p>
<p>Brain told me I got there.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing, man.</p>
<p>You just, your mind&rsquo;s a very powerful tool.</p>
<p>And the problem a lot of people have is</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t accept the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>They bitch about the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>I just.</p>
<p>First of all, you could always quit, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So like, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Never missed weight.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Never missed weight.</p>
<p>You can perform poorly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t miss weight.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss weight.</p>
<p>Because you can always win</p>
<p>regardless of how bad the weight cut is.</p>
<p>You can never win if you miss weight.</p>
<p>But your brain is also really good.</p>
<p>Maybe not your brain,</p>
<p>but I know my brain,</p>
<p>I think most people&rsquo;s brains are good at generating,</p>
<p>the more desperate things become,</p>
<p>the better at generating excuses.</p>
<p>So what were you doing with your mind</p>
<p>that resulted in you never missing weight?</p>
<p>The plan.</p>
<p>So like I said, like my weight cut would never start</p>
<p>until I got to the hotel</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t check my weight the morning of,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t check my weight when I got there.</p>
<p>I just, while I&rsquo;m traveling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing things at like a minimal level,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m never not giving myself something I&rsquo;m craving.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m thirsty, I&rsquo;m drinking a Diet Coke.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m hungry, I&rsquo;m buying a Snickers bar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying a sandwich.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>And I accept the consequences when I get there.</p>
<p>And then when I get there,</p>
<p>if I step on the scale and it says 88 kilos,</p>
<p>I instantaneously know exactly</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s gonna take to be 81.</p>
<p>And then you just follow like a robot,</p>
<p>follow a very specific process.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then, I mean,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a lot of seconds in three days,</p>
<p>seconds and minutes and you just.</p>
<p>I just know exactly what it takes from my body.</p>
<p>I know exactly what a one hour gym workout</p>
<p>wearing a sauna suit is gonna take.</p>
<p>I know exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna lose on day one.</p>
<p>And I know exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna lose on day three,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not the same.</p>
<p>So I can instantly look at a hotel,</p>
<p>decide is there a bathroom, sauna, gym,</p>
<p>temperature of the gym, access to the gym and when it is,</p>
<p>access to the judo mats, my training partners,</p>
<p>the roads versus streetlights, the weather outside.</p>
<p>I can take a look at that environment and say,</p>
<p>this is my weight, this is weigh ins.</p>
<p>And instantaneously in my head,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a plan to make weight.</p>
<p>And you have a sense of how much sweat adds up to 10 pounds.</p>
<p>How much sweat plus time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I make sure in my plan,</p>
<p>all of my meals and how much water I need in between</p>
<p>is allocated to still make weight.</p>
<p>Cause you have to eat or drink during that time.</p>
<p>Are you incorporating like mental exhaustion into this?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you like meditate or something?</p>
<p>What did the thoughts come, especially three days.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about four hours of suffering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>This has broken some of the toughest people in the world.</p>
<p>The hardest weight cut I ever had.</p>
<p>Hardest one.</p>
<p>I fought Pan Am games in 2015 in Edmonton, Canada</p>
<p>on a Wednesday and I won.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve made weight on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I fought on Wednesday where I had to weigh in</p>
<p>5% of my weight class, so 84 kilos.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I was 84 kilos.</p>
<p>I got on a plane on that Wednesday night</p>
<p>and landed Friday morning in Sochi.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve traveled now.</p>
<p>I got on the scale, all my bags got lost, everything.</p>
<p>So somehow I flew from there to here, no bags.</p>
<p>And I threw all of my stuff in my bag.</p>
<p>I wore sandals, one pair of pants and a T shirt</p>
<p>on the plane because I was like, I&rsquo;m just tired.</p>
<p>I just fought.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to carry it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>What are the odds that I get there and my bags are gone?</p>
<p>Yeah, very low.</p>
<p>Very low.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I get all the way to Sochi.</p>
<p>I check into the hotel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one sauna.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You have to reserve it and you&rsquo;re only allowed</p>
<p>to reserve it for an X period of time.</p>
<p>Guess in a small tangent, when you phoned out,</p>
<p>your bags are gone.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ll often think about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like people that are helping you, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a person at the airport who goes.</p>
<p>Yep, oops.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>And then the person at the hotel who tells you</p>
<p>that you have to reserve the sauna and looks at you like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, they don&rsquo;t care that you&rsquo;ve been suffering.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even understand why you need it.</p>
<p>Yeah, like why?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, oh, this, like this little kid reserved it</p>
<p>for five hours or something to block it off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Is there a frustration that gets in there?</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>You just accept reality.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even hinder on like the things you can&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Because the second you get frustrated,</p>
<p>the second you think you can change it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll harp on it.</p>
<p>And that breaks most men.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That like little thing in the back of their mind thinking,</p>
<p>oh, like what if?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no what if.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only right here right now.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just quickly come up with a solution</p>
<p>to fix the problem.</p>
<p>By the way, as another small tangent,</p>
<p>all the greatest people I&rsquo;ve interacted with</p>
<p>at the highest level think like that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t linger on the, it&rsquo;s like the next thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because like, if you want to do something great,</p>
<p>hard stuff is going to keep happening to you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to let that affect you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not ever going to do the great thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating actually.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the one skill you have to learn.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is great at this.</p>
<p>Constantly dealing with emergencies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, this happened.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next step?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Accept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Every problem has a solution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t solve it, it&rsquo;s not my problem.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So what, so how&rsquo;d you figure it out?</p>
<p>In sandals?</p>
<p>Get this, I get to the hotel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I check in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know about the sauna yet.</p>
<p>I go, I need to find a clothing store.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of Russia.</p>
<p>I open up Google Maps and I&rsquo;m like, sports store.</p>
<p>I find an Adidas sports store</p>
<p>in the middle of Sochi, Russia, right?</p>
<p>I spend like $500 on like average sweats.</p>
<p>No plastics, no nothing, and no running shoes</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the temperature outside?</p>
<p>Is it cold?</p>
<p>It was kind of like springish.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t cold, but it wasn&rsquo;t hot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you still need a lot of layers preferably.</p>
<p>You would need a lot of layers just to cut</p>
<p>the amount of weight I&rsquo;m about to tell you I have to cut</p>
<p>because after I bought that stuff that next morning,</p>
<p>and mind you, it&rsquo;s a Friday, it&rsquo;s a Friday morning.</p>
<p>I go to the venue where we have the mats open to train</p>
<p>and I step on the scale.</p>
<p>And then Sagan Batar of Mongolia goes,</p>
<p>oh, pretty good, you&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>And I go, no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I stepped on the scale at almost 94 kilos.</p>
<p>And I looked at him and I was like, I&rsquo;m 81.</p>
<p>And he went, good luck.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For the next weight class above.</p>
<p>Is this on a Saturday or Sunday?</p>
<p>Friday morning.</p>
<p>No, no, no, sorry.</p>
<p>Friday morning, the competition is when?</p>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>I weigh in Sunday.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, holy crap.</p>
<p>I throw on all my layers and there&rsquo;s one other person</p>
<p>with me there, Kalita, who was my girlfriend at the time,</p>
<p>now my wife, we start doing judo.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m like, this will be the easiest way to knock off</p>
<p>like three or four kilos.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>I have no gi and I&rsquo;m working out with a female.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get overly physical to really get my muscles</p>
<p>going to really break that sweat</p>
<p>because she has to compete in a day or two.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not a training partner.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just use this person.</p>
<p>I stepped on the scale.</p>
<p>I was 91 kilos.</p>
<p>So I went, well, I was a nice den, but like,</p>
<p>yeah, I go, that&rsquo;s not going to fly.</p>
<p>So sure enough, the clothes are now ruined.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t help me lose any extra weight.</p>
<p>So I go back to the hotel and I start reserving the sauna.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to lose that much weight</p>
<p>in a sauna by yourself?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder on many levels,</p>
<p>but one of them is just mental.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting in heat.</p>
<p>Heat, and you&rsquo;re not doing anything.</p>
<p>Like if there had been a bike or like the sauna</p>
<p>was big enough to use a jump rope</p>
<p>or you could do some sort of activity,</p>
<p>but you just sit and you stew and you&rsquo;re there mentally.</p>
<p>At one point during the weight cut,</p>
<p>I actually had my mouth on the bottom part of the door</p>
<p>where there was a little gap and my legs up on the benches</p>
<p>and Kalita holding the door so that it didn&rsquo;t open</p>
<p>so I couldn&rsquo;t open it so that I could lean against</p>
<p>that thing and have fresh air.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, I was struggling.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about, I mean, how many hours is that?</p>
<p>Hours.</p>
<p>And then the thing is,</p>
<p>is because you have to reserve the sauna.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even take like a 30 minute break</p>
<p>because the sauna is not going to be mine in an hour,</p>
<p>which means you have to use the sauna and the heat</p>
<p>for that allotted time period.</p>
<p>And I hate saunas.</p>
<p>That is always my last resort.</p>
<p>I would use a bath.</p>
<p>I will train.</p>
<p>I will run.</p>
<p>I will jump rope.</p>
<p>Sauna is like, oh, let me do that for 10 minutes</p>
<p>after all of my gym workouts,</p>
<p>just to keep the sweat going while I stretch and cool down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never like the, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do five, 10 minute sessions</p>
<p>because I need to lose two kilos.</p>
<p>That is never the plan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, so I&rsquo;ve done plenty of sauna for weight cuts</p>
<p>to know I can&rsquo;t even imagine what you went through.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the seconds slow down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to achieve immortality is like</p>
<p>the time slows down to like a stop</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re left alone with your thoughts.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Just like you said, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than sitting in that kind of heat</p>
<p>for 10, 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you walk out and you&rsquo;re not even sweating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than that.</p>
<p>And if you like, and maybe if you weigh yourself,</p>
<p>which you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll break you.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t lost anything.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And I was weighing myself every time</p>
<p>because I only get breaks</p>
<p>when I was hitting weight allotments.</p>
<p>And so if I could lose 0.3 in 10 minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give myself a break, but I had to hit certain numbers</p>
<p>because I only have the sauna for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>And I remember one time I went downstairs</p>
<p>to get my key to the sauna</p>
<p>and the Japanese team had reserved it and took it from me</p>
<p>because the guy didn&rsquo;t put my name on the list</p>
<p>when I called down to get the sauna.</p>
<p>So I lost an entire session that I had to get made up</p>
<p>towards the later part of the day</p>
<p>because I still have no running shoes.</p>
<p>And then sure enough, my bags show up 30 minutes</p>
<p>after weigh ins.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the universe just kind of giving you</p>
<p>a little wink there.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I think like, because so few people do this weight cut</p>
<p>at this high of a level, people don&rsquo;t often realize</p>
<p>because people get a sense of how hard it is</p>
<p>to run 200 miles in the desert.</p>
<p>Like they, cause they go outside here in Texas,</p>
<p>you can run five miles.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But like the weight cut is really,</p>
<p>I, can you, so you just, like, how did you do it?</p>
<p>Just fucking not refusing to.</p>
<p>You have to make weight.</p>
<p>You have to make weight and you just, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I am astounded when I hear like UFC fighters like miss weight.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like when Jaden Cox missed weight at the Olympic trials,</p>
<p>I was like, at least his was understandable</p>
<p>because he missed the actual weigh ins.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t like not on weight.</p>
<p>But when UFC fighters like miss weight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how did that happen?</p>
<p>You clearly like gave up a long time ago.</p>
<p>There were times where I was like, well, I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been times where I&rsquo;ve been in a sauna suit</p>
<p>wrestling with a training partner who&rsquo;s probably 60 kilos</p>
<p>who fought earlier that day to lose point three.</p>
<p>Did lose point three.</p>
<p>Like, are you considering your mortality in this moment?</p>
<p>Like, aren&rsquo;t you thinking you&rsquo;re going to die?</p>
<p>Because like, it&rsquo;s severe dehydration.</p>
<p>You could damage your body.</p>
<p>Are you thinking about any of this or is it just, man.</p>
<p>OK, yes.</p>
<p>But see, I&rsquo;m on the other level too where like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in Belgium, right?</p>
<p>Belgium, there used to be a B level tournament.</p>
<p>And the tournament used to go on.</p>
<p>And because I was always on the heavier side,</p>
<p>like 81s fights on the second day, which is the heavyweight day,</p>
<p>weigh ins were always at like, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>2 p.m. the day before for that tournament.</p>
<p>Well, there was a sauna at the tournament.</p>
<p>I remember like being in the sauna and like, oh, I&rsquo;m 80.9 kilos.</p>
<p>Weigh ins aren&rsquo;t for three hours.</p>
<p>Fuck it, I&rsquo;m going to have lunch.</p>
<p>Because I mentally understand that what I eat right now</p>
<p>is going to fuel me for tomorrow.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to skip it.</p>
<p>I have the time to put it into my system and still lose it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a computer program.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running through the process.</p>
<p>I get it, but like that all relies on your ability to be.</p>
<p>To get it back off.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but also just like go through this process,</p>
<p>which is painful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those monks who meditate while sitting in a fire</p>
<p>kind of thing or something, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Is there other people that are critical to this</p>
<p>or is this all internal to you?</p>
<p>Are there people that?</p>
<p>Everybody has their own way of doing it.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t cut that much.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t weight cut at all, right?</p>
<p>They would rather have been like 83 kilos fighting 90</p>
<p>than, you know, be 83 kilos fighting 81.</p>
<p>So why did you never move up to 90?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Is it from your deep understanding of your own judo</p>
<p>and like the judo opponents you would face at 90 and 81?</p>
<p>Cause 81 is probably the hardest,</p>
<p>if not the second hardest division in the history of judo</p>
<p>compared to 73 and 81.</p>
<p>You know, when I was a kid, like I always wanted to be</p>
<p>like the middleweight Olympic champion,</p>
<p>like the 81 kilo Olympic champion.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I made a decision</p>
<p>when I was trying to make weight for 73,</p>
<p>I was like, I was cutting weight for 73</p>
<p>like I was cutting weight at the end of my career, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;m just gonna bag it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna accept the fact</p>
<p>that I may not make a junior world team,</p>
<p>I may not make this team, but I&rsquo;ll grow into the division</p>
<p>so when I&rsquo;m a senior player, like I&rsquo;m ready to go</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll naturally be stronger.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an understanding of like a growth process</p>
<p>when you move up a weight class.</p>
<p>Most people can&rsquo;t just, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna fight 90s</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna win because I wanted 81.</p>
<p>The style of judo is different, how you move is different,</p>
<p>how they do things is different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a learning curve that goes into it.</p>
<p>And because the weight cut didn&rsquo;t really happen</p>
<p>until I was getting ready for Rio,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t about to have my last Olympic games</p>
<p>be at a different weight class</p>
<p>that I may or may not be able to grow into.</p>
<p>I mean, this is an awesome story of you kind of decided</p>
<p>that this will be your life&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>in terms of judo competitor is like the 81 division.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw it that way,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re talking about three Olympics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this story of, I would say tragedy and triumph</p>
<p>of just wars and 81 kilograms with the usual cast</p>
<p>of characters of the top five in the world kind of thing.</p>
<p>So you just became a scholar of that,</p>
<p>let your body grow into it and then let your body outgrow it</p>
<p>and still suffer through it to keep it in the 81 kilograms.</p>
<p>You never competed at like at the highest levels at 90.</p>
<p>I entered one tournament at 90 kilos.</p>
<p>And that was because before Rio from the end of 2014,</p>
<p>all the way up until Rio&rsquo;s, every time I fought,</p>
<p>I got hurt every time there was no time where I made weight</p>
<p>and got injured because my body weight was so high.</p>
<p>My body fat was so low that by the time I dehydrated enough</p>
<p>to get down there and you take the physicality of judo</p>
<p>and throw that into the mix, something broke every time.</p>
<p>It was like nature of the beast.</p>
<p>So the plan was before Rio,</p>
<p>we made an agreement with USA judo</p>
<p>that Travis, you&rsquo;re gonna fight 90 kilos,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna weigh in at 90 kilos.</p>
<p>Like, hey, there&rsquo;s no like, you get to be 94 kilos</p>
<p>and cut to 90s, there&rsquo;s like a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna step on the scale at 84 kilos,</p>
<p>like a little bit of a weight cut, but not a full one,</p>
<p>just so that you feel like you get into like the tournament.</p>
<p>Because when I, around 2012,</p>
<p>when I was talking with the USOC nutritionist,</p>
<p>I actually got my weight down so much</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t really need to cut weight.</p>
<p>The problem is, is I wasn&rsquo;t cutting weight,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was competing.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Right, you have to go through like that mental process.</p>
<p>And I never really reworked that,</p>
<p>it was easier to just cut the weight and be ready to go.</p>
<p>But when I entered into the 90 kilo division,</p>
<p>I was rushed to the hospital the night after</p>
<p>because my body broke out in hives, like full body.</p>
<p>They said it was stress induced.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>So a month before the games, I was hospitalized and hungry</p>
<p>and filled with steroids to get the hives to drop.</p>
<p>And every couple days, my body, when I got back home,</p>
<p>I would end up in the hospital</p>
<p>because my whole body would break out again.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s like deviating from the process</p>
<p>that you so like perfectly crafted already.</p>
<p>Or it was stress from my mind thinking,</p>
<p>like even though it&rsquo;s not top of mind,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a portion of me that like the Olympics</p>
<p>is coming around and it could be my last, that like my body</p>
<p>just reacted to something chemically.</p>
<p>So I was breaking out in hives.</p>
<p>I actually bought like a 600 euro Hugo boss suit</p>
<p>because when I was in the Netherlands training at the time,</p>
<p>I thought I had bed bugs</p>
<p>because I was getting bit everywhere.</p>
<p>Then I thought there was something in the detergent</p>
<p>at the local thing, so I threw away all my clothes.</p>
<p>Like I was paying for showers</p>
<p>because I was trying to get the detergent off my body</p>
<p>and buying new clothes at the airport.</p>
<p>Trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>Trying to figure it out and just go, yeah,</p>
<p>accepting the situation.</p>
<p>I mean, but the level of stress is exceptionally high here.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the other side?</p>
<p>People are gonna love this.</p>
<p>But you have a long history of persevering through injuries,</p>
<p>through insane amounts of injuries.</p>
<p>My ability to tolerate pain</p>
<p>is probably more than most people.</p>
<p>But see, injuries aren&rsquo;t just pain, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s also mental, like psychological.</p>
<p>Like again, like the weight cut,</p>
<p>it can make a lot of people quit.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can you tell your history of injuries?</p>
<p>What are the biggest injuries,</p>
<p>the toughest injuries in your career?</p>
<p>Starting from what, your early teens?</p>
<p>My early teens, I actually got out of sports</p>
<p>from 11 to, I wanna say like 15 years old, 16 years old,</p>
<p>because a kid shot a double leg through my kneecap</p>
<p>and I partially tore all the ligaments in my knee,</p>
<p>cartilage, meniscus, the whole nine yards.</p>
<p>And I had to learn how to walk again.</p>
<p>I spent two years in a leg brace, crutches,</p>
<p>hobbling around the school yard.</p>
<p>That one was a challenge to come back from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken most of my ribs.</p>
<p>I won nationals with nine broken ribs.</p>
<p>I was actually getting Novocaine shots into my chest</p>
<p>to avoid feeling the pain</p>
<p>and then wrapping them to try to</p>
<p>make sure I didn&rsquo;t pop alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken my collarbone.</p>
<p>I have five herniated disc in my neck.</p>
<p>I fractured my back twice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken my tailbone.</p>
<p>I tore my SI joints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve torn my right hamstring twice, my left one once.</p>
<p>Broken my ankles a few times.</p>
<p>I spun it once in a 360 that had dev surgery.</p>
<p>Fingers, toes, elbows, shoulders.</p>
<p>So all of these are, first of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a tough dude, man.</p>
<p>So each of those have a story behind them.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking about the collarbone or the ankles</p>
<p>or the back, the neck,</p>
<p>is there interesting stories here</p>
<p>that are behind these injuries?</p>
<p>Hard training, hard competing, jiu jitsu, judo.</p>
<p>So ground stuff like sparring in the dojo</p>
<p>or like drilling or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If you were to sort of break it down,</p>
<p>your understanding of the landscape</p>
<p>of injuries you went through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had one in jiu jitsu, ever.</p>
<p>I mean, I might&rsquo;ve like torn a fingernail</p>
<p>or like gotten key burned,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never been like seriously injured.</p>
<p>I know when Ponza straight ankle locked me at Copa Podio,</p>
<p>that hurt, but I wasn&rsquo;t injured.</p>
<p>Like it felt sore, but if I had to run, I could run.</p>
<p>I can now understand probably exactly</p>
<p>what the injuries came from then.</p>
<p>You very quickly excelled at jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>You achieved another level in judo.</p>
<p>And I think that means the intensity</p>
<p>with which you approached judo.</p>
<p>To achieve that world class level</p>
<p>probably is the source of the injuries.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the mentality of how I approached judo</p>
<p>versus jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu to me is like a game that like we would play.</p>
<p>Like if you wanted to like grab a basketball</p>
<p>and like go play a game of one on one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like jiu jitsu to me.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t take the sport in its entirety seriously.</p>
<p>Cause I feel like the community of jiu jitsu</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>
<p>So just for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just to set some context,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a black belt in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve beaten a lot of world class jiu jitsu people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done very well at the highest levels of competition.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily say I&rsquo;ve beaten them</p>
<p>as much as I&rsquo;ve trained with them.</p>
<p>And they understand whoever it is</p>
<p>that through training with me,</p>
<p>that like, I&rsquo;m not just a judo guy.</p>
<p>Like I know how to do jiu jitsu, right?</p>
<p>And if any one of them were to come to me and like say,</p>
<p>hey, I wanna feel what it feels like to do judo with me.</p>
<p>They would quickly understand</p>
<p>that like the way I approach one</p>
<p>is very different than the way I approach the other.</p>
<p>Like we probably wouldn&rsquo;t be friends</p>
<p>if they did judo with me versus if they did jiu jitsu with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious asking for a friend</p>
<p>because mostly because I&rsquo;ll do a little judo with you today.</p>
<p>So you clearly, cause you&rsquo;re a great instructor and teacher,</p>
<p>you have a mode where you can demonstrate a technique.</p>
<p>Do you know how to like spar where you&rsquo;re going like 50%?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put like a percentage to it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never in all of my jiu jitsu ever gone 100%.</p>
<p>In jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I had a conversation with Salo one time</p>
<p>where we were talking about like jiu jitsu and training.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, if I got his arm, I would just break it.</p>
<p>And he was like, but what if he tapped?</p>
<p>I go, that&rsquo;s not my responsibility.</p>
<p>If he taps and the ref doesn&rsquo;t say anything,</p>
<p>you just break it.</p>
<p>You just keep going.</p>
<p>He goes, but the tap means it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And I said, no, the ref tells me when it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I go, I never give you the opportunity to tap.</p>
<p>Cause if you have the opportunity to tap,</p>
<p>that means you had the opportunity to think about</p>
<p>how to get out, make a decision that you can&rsquo;t, then tap.</p>
<p>I clearly operated too slowly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s either broken or I don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a terrifying person to go against in Judo.</p>
<p>Like on the ground, like everything you did, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made you a really fun person to watch.</p>
<p>Cause you really went to war with these people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you know what it&rsquo;s like to go a hundred percent in Judo.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Cause I know what it&rsquo;s like to train with somebody</p>
<p>under the mentality of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do everything I want to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to do nothing you want to do.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to accept that.</p>
<p>Do you ever train in Judo where you let people get stuff?</p>
<p>Of course, all the time.</p>
<p>Now, or like.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Even when you&rsquo;re sort of building up the four years,</p>
<p>building up to the Olympics,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s smaller guys that are throwing you in the gym</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No, I never said that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That never came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I said, I let people do stuff.</p>
<p>I never said smaller people throw me.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean you let them get a grip,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;ll position yourself on such a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>The number one skillset that Judo is going to teach you</p>
<p>is the ability to give people false hope.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Cause I can let.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the video</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to shoot later today.</p>
<p>Like I can let you take a grip.</p>
<p>I can let you think that there&rsquo;s opportunity,</p>
<p>but what you don&rsquo;t understand is</p>
<p>by the position and angle that I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually false hope.</p>
<p>Like, as long as you don&rsquo;t know that it is,</p>
<p>then now I&rsquo;m free to operate and do what I want.</p>
<p>See, I competed in Judo against black belts</p>
<p>where I would go in and it looks like</p>
<p>I could should be able to throw them.</p>
<p>And then you just hit a wall.</p>
<p>And then I also saw you destroy those black belts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s levels to this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the cliche thing of there&rsquo;s black belts</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s black belts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re unique in this.</p>
<p>There may be a couple other Jidoka in America,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really like unique.</p>
<p>I then get to see people that really</p>
<p>I felt like were 10X better than me.</p>
<p>It just feels like that sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that madness and it said it&rsquo;d be truly</p>
<p>might only be just a little better,</p>
<p>but I saw you destroy them.</p>
<p>And it was like, holy shit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing in Judo, right?</p>
<p>Where, you know, imagine like you as like just an adult,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And I hope people can like conceptualize this</p>
<p>when they hear this,</p>
<p>but imagine like you&rsquo;re a full grown adult,</p>
<p>even male, female, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a little kid in front of you,</p>
<p>like call him five or six years old and he&rsquo;s acting out.</p>
<p>Like, do you think you have the physical capability</p>
<p>of with one hand grabbing that person or that kid</p>
<p>and making sure that they freeze?</p>
<p>Like they feel like they&rsquo;re nervous</p>
<p>and like they can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>When you fight a good Judo player, when they grab you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it feels like as an adult.</p>
<p>And even I&rsquo;ve felt that from like certain players in Japan,</p>
<p>like when they get a grip,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve now lost the function of this one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good way to put it.</p>
<p>I think I could potentially beat some of the people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve went against, but certain groups they took,</p>
<p>it made me feel powerless.</p>
<p>I was like, I didn&rsquo;t know this was possible.</p>
<p>That kind of power was possible.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t even know where it originates from.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re like, how does one person&rsquo;s hand do this</p>
<p>where I can&rsquo;t use my whole arm?</p>
<p>Or like, I can&rsquo;t pick up my right foot</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s holding onto my right sleeve.</p>
<p>It was kind of on a basic animalistic sense,</p>
<p>kind of terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>part of this is like ego,</p>
<p>but you realize that there&rsquo;s a food chain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not at the top of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the humbling process,</p>
<p>I think of martial arts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think everybody,</p>
<p>like a lot of people think they&rsquo;re much higher</p>
<p>in the food chain than they are.</p>
<p>Than they really are.</p>
<p>And then when you realize,</p>
<p>this is why it&rsquo;s a really healthy process for people</p>
<p>that are not even competing in the Olympics</p>
<p>to practice martial arts.</p>
<p>Cause you realize, okay,</p>
<p>that like putting yourself more accurately</p>
<p>in the food chain is really good way</p>
<p>to sort of place yourself in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It humbles you to the reality, the harshness of the world.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like when people look at like survival</p>
<p>in the wilderness, it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;d probably be dying in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Same thing with like judo and martial arts.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it&rsquo;s really not that hard,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do yet.</p>
<p>And so when you find out that first time</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s devastating to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but those that like stick through it and like start to learn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very powerful, like feeling that now,</p>
<p>like you can take care of yourself.</p>
<p>And I think I want to talk to you a few times before</p>
<p>you talked about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, like the top three, the top five in the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you put them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re another like level above.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a whole nother tier, yeah.</p>
<p>And the fact that you&rsquo;re, I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so exciting to me probably</p>
<p>because I just felt all the levels here</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen you and others at that height destroy those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the exponential levels to this game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible that you&rsquo;re, didn&rsquo;t quit,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t doubt yourself and just persevered</p>
<p>through three Olympics to get to that highest,</p>
<p>always fighting at that like very highest of levels,</p>
<p>but just like, you know, from the top 10 to the top five,</p>
<p>like really breaking in through that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What would you say it took to get to that highest of levels?</p>
<p>Like if you, when you look back to all the weight cuts,</p>
<p>to just the insane amount of injuries, believe it or not,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think I was there until 2013.</p>
<p>I thought I was recognized as one of the best</p>
<p>because I was able to fight for Oppensburg,</p>
<p>which was the professional Bundesliga team for Germany,</p>
<p>which is one of the top clubs in all of Europe.</p>
<p>When they asked me to, I felt like Europe had like accepted</p>
<p>me as like, oh, I&rsquo;m a top level judo player,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that when I signed on</p>
<p>to compete for them, that the division or the world</p>
<p>of judo saw me as a top level judo player, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mental shift that happens along that point.</p>
<p>And for me, my mental shift really came into play</p>
<p>in December of 2015 before Rio.</p>
<p>That was like, when I lost in Japan,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I realized like the world respects my abilities</p>
<p>and they compete against them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t compete against me as a person.</p>
<p>They compete against the idea or the persona</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been able to establish over the years</p>
<p>of competing in the division.</p>
<p>Wow, so you&rsquo;re the, they probably have a nickname for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the system of ideas and thought that they study.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re studying me as a conceptual whole,</p>
<p>not me as the human.</p>
<p>Is your style relatively unique in the 81 kilogram division?</p>
<p>It was relatively unique for Kayla, I and Jimmy</p>
<p>up until 2016.</p>
<p>Now since 2016, you can see a lot of what we used to do</p>
<p>throughout most of Europe and even Asia.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re starting to see some of those techniques</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t see before starting to get implemented.</p>
<p>Because when I was gearing up for 2015,</p>
<p>I had such a slew of injuries that entire calendar year</p>
<p>that I never should have made it to Rio.</p>
<p>I should have called it quits at the end of 2015</p>
<p>because I suffered that major concussion in February.</p>
<p>I stepped on a mat in May for the first time.</p>
<p>I lost five straight tournaments.</p>
<p>I left the national team, went to Japan, won Pan Am games,</p>
<p>got a bacterial infection at the Worlds,</p>
<p>almost had my leg cut off, tore my SI joint later</p>
<p>on that year, and then took fifth in Japan.</p>
<p>And when you look at like the calendar year as a whole,</p>
<p>like the world should have treated me like I was washed up.</p>
<p>Like this guy hasn&rsquo;t been training,</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t been doing anything, but I took fifth in Japan.</p>
<p>Now, how does a guy that hasn&rsquo;t trained all year</p>
<p>take fifth at one of the hardest tournaments in the world</p>
<p>on two weeks of training?</p>
<p>Because they were fighting the guy I used to be,</p>
<p>not the guy I was at the tournament,</p>
<p>which means they were competing under the idea of like,</p>
<p>what is he really capable of?</p>
<p>Not what have I brought to the table today?</p>
<p>And that just gave you the confidence.</p>
<p>And that told me that like, well, if I can take fifth</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m this bad at judo right now,</p>
<p>wait until I&rsquo;m healthy and I&rsquo;m back in shape,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re not gonna know what hit them.</p>
<p>One of the essential components of being the number one</p>
<p>in the world or up in that place is that confidence,</p>
<p>the self belief.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world believing it.</p>
<p>You can have all the confidence in the world,</p>
<p>but if the rest of the room doesn&rsquo;t buy it, it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s certain people, right?</p>
<p>Oh, Tyson, Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>They all understand he could not train</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still scared, right?</p>
<p>Like he doesn&rsquo;t have to work out that hard anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several judo, you know this way better,</p>
<p>but from a spectator perspective,</p>
<p>like Ilias Iliadis is like that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s portrayed over the years.</p>
<p>Why is everyone so scared of that guy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>People were scared of you too.</p>
<p>People just gave a certain level of respect to my skillset</p>
<p>and whether I had a bad weight cut</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t have a bad weight cut</p>
<p>or not trained for the last three months,</p>
<p>which never happened, I&rsquo;m just saying,</p>
<p>they were gonna fight the persona.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an important distinction</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at the top five</p>
<p>because everybody coming up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re training against the persona, not who you are.</p>
<p>Even I did that at a younger age.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I would always go to people&rsquo;s hometowns</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t care about the persona.</p>
<p>I wanna know what you do day in and day out.</p>
<p>When I couldn&rsquo;t beat a Russian,</p>
<p>I told Jimmy, send me to Russia.</p>
<p>I need to understand and see it with my own eyes</p>
<p>what they do, outperform,</p>
<p>so that I can believe that I can beat them.</p>
<p>Can I ask you on this, a small tangent.</p>
<p>Dagestan has produced some incredible wrestlers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the story with judo is,</p>
<p>where the source of greatness in Russia is for judo,</p>
<p>but what do you make of Dagestan?</p>
<p>Why, what is it in the culture of there or Russia broadly</p>
<p>that produces greatness?</p>
<p>Specifically in the combat sports.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, yeah, specifically in the combat sports,</p>
<p>sorry, but I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna draw a distinction</p>
<p>between wrestling and judo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost curious,</p>
<p>do you understand the differences there in the culture?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a combat sport to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still in that same like realm</p>
<p>of they&rsquo;re taking young kids and that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>So Khabib speaks very highly of judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, Khabib, Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t get it,</p>
<p>but like judo is like one of the premier sports</p>
<p>in the world, but we just don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just popularity, so definitely popularity,</p>
<p>but also like this respect.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain thing,</p>
<p>which is why I really value judo internationally.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get this in the United States,</p>
<p>but internationally there&rsquo;s an understanding,</p>
<p>like later in life,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a scientist meeting a businessman,</p>
<p>when you both have done judo,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this like nod of respect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few sports like that.</p>
<p>Basketball doesn&rsquo;t have any,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know almost any sport like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Wrestling has that in the US, but it&rsquo;s the US only.</p>
<p>The rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few, like you could see that in like Iran</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll respect wrestling in that kind of way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>But judo on like a global scale</p>
<p>is probably that only one,</p>
<p>due to its like physicality and the hardships</p>
<p>that you have to go through to reach that upper level.</p>
<p>So why do you think Dagestan,</p>
<p>why do you think Khabib is as good as he is?</p>
<p>Is this just the raw genetics of the human</p>
<p>or is there something about the system?</p>
<p>The system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all has to do with the system.</p>
<p>So they grow up around fighting in all forms.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also, I mean, their technique is exceptionally good.</p>
<p>Because they grow up in it.</p>
<p>They grow up in it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand anything else.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you with the weight cutting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a big dramatic thing for them to fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is just part of life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t wanna say bred into it,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;ve done it for,</p>
<p>I wanna say like 90% of your life</p>
<p>by the time like Khabib probably has,</p>
<p>right from the time he could crawl,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably even grappling in some fashion thereof, right?</p>
<p>When you, as grapplers,</p>
<p>like you can look at a wrestler and having never seen</p>
<p>this person before and go, you wrestled.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s probably wrestled since he was like six.</p>
<p>So the way he carries himself,</p>
<p>the way his body is built,</p>
<p>the way he grew into it was framed around wrestling, right?</p>
<p>So the people in that culture are framed</p>
<p>around fighting and grappling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>First of all, philosophically, psychologically,</p>
<p>but also just like the way you move your body.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That means like when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>the people you admire move their body</p>
<p>in a certain kind of way.</p>
<p>And then genetically, it just, as they keep doing that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna get better and better every generation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna keep improving</p>
<p>because they just keep building into that system</p>
<p>of turning them out.</p>
<p>And part of it, there&rsquo;s like cultural stuff where,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such an interesting approach to wrestling.</p>
<p>I really wanna travel to Dagestan and just talk to them</p>
<p>because I happen to be able to speak Russian.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s less value</p>
<p>for this kind of materialistic success</p>
<p>that I think sometimes can get in the way of greatness,</p>
<p>it seems like.</p>
<p>It makes coaching more difficult.</p>
<p>It makes like following orders as an athlete more difficult.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We struggle with that in USA judo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause you want more money,</p>
<p>but then more money, if not applied correctly,</p>
<p>can corrupt the system.</p>
<p>Somehow it can split people up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s same thing with the prestige</p>
<p>around certain medals over others</p>
<p>because athletes start chasing fame instead of development.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, I mean, the Setia brothers</p>
<p>are famous for this, like ignoring fame,</p>
<p>ignoring all of this, like focus on the art itself.</p>
<p>Not even, so it&rsquo;s not even the medals,</p>
<p>exactly like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>just the purity of like when you&rsquo;re in it</p>
<p>and let everybody else figure out their stupid medals</p>
<p>and money and all that.</p>
<p>Cause it comes.</p>
<p>It comes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a result.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t appreciate it,</p>
<p>but you know that it comes if you focus on the art.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distinction when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about your athletic career or really any endeavor, right?</p>
<p>The problem with goal setting is nobody teaches the athletes</p>
<p>or the people how to transition</p>
<p>from the goal to reality, right?</p>
<p>So when you look at my career as a whole,</p>
<p>like when I was getting ready for 2008,</p>
<p>I actually forgot to train for it.</p>
<p>I was so happy at such a young age</p>
<p>that I became an Olympian that that in and of itself</p>
<p>was a goal that I thought had to be admired,</p>
<p>had to be celebrated that, you know,</p>
<p>the games are right around the corner.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really come down off that high.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the local optimum of just winning the trials.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge thing.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re just focusing on the accomplishment,</p>
<p>not the.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But at some point, right, when I went into London,</p>
<p>I actually went into London going with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna prove I&rsquo;m the best in the world</p>
<p>cause I believe I&rsquo;m the best in the world.</p>
<p>And I believe it from like the bottom of my soul</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m winning this.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re almost like trying to tell the universe,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m accomplishing this thing because it&rsquo;s a goal.</p>
<p>But when I went into Rio,</p>
<p>I just accepted the fact that I was winning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a goal.</p>
<p>Like this is happening.</p>
<p>You visualize it.</p>
<p>But I felt it.</p>
<p>You felt it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like this is no longer a goal anymore.</p>
<p>Like I anticipated, like this is happening.</p>
<p>I can see this coming down the path</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m anticipating that the games is happening</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an anticipation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a distinct distinction there</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>Okay, so for people who are just watching the video of this,</p>
<p>there should be an overlay of Young Travis.</p>
<p>This is, you still had to make 81.</p>
<p>Is this still a tough cut here?</p>
<p>No, this one was relatively easy.</p>
<p>This is going all the way back to 2008.</p>
<p>So this is the summer before the games.</p>
<p>This probably happened in June, I would say.</p>
<p>So this is the Olympic trials.</p>
<p>So in the United States,</p>
<p>you have to, I mean, similar to like wrestling,</p>
<p>you have to win the trials to qualify</p>
<p>for that particular division</p>
<p>to represent the United States.</p>
<p>So this is, you said June before an August Olympics?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So here, I just wanted to show this match</p>
<p>because what was, there&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>I think you do a pin,</p>
<p>you do some nice ground work in the other one.</p>
<p>But in this one.</p>
<p>Fighting a teammate.</p>
<p>Former teammate.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s an old school double leg.</p>
<p>I forgot about that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird to see.</p>
<p>So there, the Travis&rsquo;s opponent,</p>
<p>and Travis is setting up here</p>
<p>that Sayonagi posting his left arm and getting it done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big, that&rsquo;s a big throw.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have too many of those big throws on video.</p>
<p>Cause like you often on video,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going against the best people in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to get like that much air.</p>
<p>And a lot of times the ones that we do see</p>
<p>and the part that a lot of people don&rsquo;t experience</p>
<p>is a lot of those times</p>
<p>where I threw people with that throw,</p>
<p>it was in training camps.</p>
<p>So by the time I got to the competition with these guys,</p>
<p>they were playing a hundred percent defense</p>
<p>to never let me do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you do this here.</p>
<p>Are you kind of pulling him down?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m trying to get him to come up.</p>
<p>But are you pulling him down to get to fake him out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing anything with my left hand.</p>
<p>So here the opponent is.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m doing right now is his head is like in my chest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pressing him to get his head to lift with my chest.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pressing his hand down so I can use my chest</p>
<p>to like pinch my scaps and roll his head up</p>
<p>so that he wants to pick it up.</p>
<p>And then he, I mean, doesn&rsquo;t he know what&rsquo;s coming here?</p>
<p>Oh no, he might not.</p>
<p>Oh no, he knew, he was a former teammate.</p>
<p>He knew exactly what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>And that was a really big step with your right foot.</p>
<p>It covers about four feet in distance.</p>
<p>And your left catches up in like perfect position.</p>
<p>Yeah, you back it up a little bit.</p>
<p>Keep going, keep going.</p>
<p>Right there, this is like an important distinction</p>
<p>between mine and everybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is because I split his hip,</p>
<p>I actually, once I&rsquo;m able to split,</p>
<p>I no longer need his center of gravity below mine.</p>
<p>Right, and when you say split,</p>
<p>you mean you put your foot in between.</p>
<p>I do that split, that four foot split.</p>
<p>And then when I get my feet back together,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;m under his center of gravity</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my chest is right around his sternum height</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there, I mean, how does he get,</p>
<p>for people just listening to this,</p>
<p>Travis Steps does a big, huge step, gets.</p>
<p>Like my hip is probably right around his nipple</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s sprawled back so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So like, so you&rsquo;re, how does the physics of this work?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re violating the principle of your center of mass</p>
<p>being under, oh, I guess somehow it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but he has nowhere to go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s screwed.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the kicker is the way mine works is</p>
<p>in order for him to play an effective defense,</p>
<p>he needs to have his feet firmly planted on the ground</p>
<p>with friction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Otherwise he can&rsquo;t press into me to stop it.</p>
<p>So when I get him to sprawl back, when I split his legs,</p>
<p>he effectively loses that contact with the floor.</p>
<p>Even though his feet are on the floor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not in a position where he can drive from them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So therefore when I flip, he flips.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a natural like flailing here.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not falling forward.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re falling forward.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just attached to you.</p>
<p>So like you can keep him up there</p>
<p>and then like legs would be just flailing.</p>
<p>Yep, one of my golden rules when I&rsquo;m training</p>
<p>and I get really tired, one of the like mantras</p>
<p>I would always tell myself is I&rsquo;m gonna put my back</p>
<p>on your chest and then I&rsquo;m gonna put my back on the floor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be underneath me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good principle to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>And it, regardless of like all the chaos</p>
<p>and how quickly things are happening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something I can just dumb everything down to</p>
<p>and focus on.</p>
<p>Regardless of the gripping situation, the footwork,</p>
<p>all of that, get my back to your chest</p>
<p>and then put my back on the floor.</p>
<p>So this step of getting your back to their chest,</p>
<p>like for people who are sort of more,</p>
<p>like for example, for people like me,</p>
<p>who are just like amateur Judo people,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to prevent this turn</p>
<p>from happening, the gripping and just everything.</p>
<p>How difficult is it at the highest level</p>
<p>to get into this position?</p>
<p>I mean, you make it look effortless often,</p>
<p>but like to get to the position where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from facing them to your back is to them.</p>
<p>Is that like strategy?</p>
<p>Is that timing?</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>Timing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s timing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like anything, like if I wanted to punch you</p>
<p>in the face, like how hard is it to really do that</p>
<p>if you know you can just play defense and block it?</p>
<p>The trick is to get them to play defense</p>
<p>to something that never happened.</p>
<p>And then you go through like another way.</p>
<p>And then you just go through what would technically</p>
<p>be your first plan if you planned on them playing defense.</p>
<p>So I set the stage from the very beginning for this to work.</p>
<p>So then this, you&rsquo;re celebrating here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge sort of, once a big accomplishments,</p>
<p>big relief to qualify for the Olympics.</p>
<p>And then you go into the Olympics</p>
<p>and this is where I first saw Judo.</p>
<p>And I kind of thought of them as the same</p>
<p>as Judo and Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>And I was really impressed by your performance</p>
<p>in that Olympics.</p>
<p>The footage nowhere to be found these days,</p>
<p>but at that time I think you could still,</p>
<p>you could watch it live on NBC Olympics</p>
<p>or somewhere like that.</p>
<p>And I remember watching several of your matches.</p>
<p>One of them was the match against Ole Bischoff, the German.</p>
<p>And I remember being, it&rsquo;d be nice</p>
<p>if you can talk to that match because I don&rsquo;t remember it.</p>
<p>All I remember is being frustrated.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>By him not letting you play Judo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So obviously you faced him again four years later</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of frustration there as well.</p>
<p>But I remember being extra frustrated in 2008.</p>
<p>What was that match like?</p>
<p>So he might&rsquo;ve been number one in the world at the time</p>
<p>or up there?</p>
<p>He was up there for sure, especially going into 2008.</p>
<p>He was really high up there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And did he win gold at that Olympics?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because he silvered in London.</p>
<p>It was the same Olympic final both in 2008 and London.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re facing him there.</p>
<p>Were you intimidated?</p>
<p>What was the strategy?</p>
<p>Can you talk to that match?</p>
<p>Because it kind of sets the stage for the rematch in 2012.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was somebody that I had trained with in the past.</p>
<p>And for some reason, when it comes to him and I,</p>
<p>when we train together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of a physical altercation</p>
<p>than a Judo training session.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the coaches have had to break us up a few times.</p>
<p>Or you guys get almost angry too?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>It always goes farther than it should.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>We say hello to each other.</p>
<p>But for some reason, when we train together,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about him and me that just oil and water.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Could it be also the gripping?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a great gripping strategist.</p>
<p>Does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips</p>
<p>and then you get pissed off and then you frustrate him?</p>
<p>And then he gets pissed off</p>
<p>and then before you know it, somebody&rsquo;s kicked somebody</p>
<p>or punched somebody in the mouth or done something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so one of the only evidences we have online</p>
<p>of you fighting him is your foot in his groin area</p>
<p>is the only thing we have from that Olympics.</p>
<p>From 2008.</p>
<p>From 2008, yeah.</p>
<p>And to answer everybody&rsquo;s question, yes, it was deliberate.</p>
<p>Now you can say this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, I remember there being a lot of frustration.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually going for a lot of stuff</p>
<p>like sacrifice throws.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>for the highest scoring epons,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just trying to shake things up,</p>
<p>if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Yeah, because when he, I was so young then that,</p>
<p>and he was in his prime really at that time, right?</p>
<p>He must&rsquo;ve been 24, 25, 26,</p>
<p>world medalist, European champion at the time.</p>
<p>And when he would grab me,</p>
<p>I had that sense of feeling stuck.</p>
<p>Like I was strong enough if I used all my strength</p>
<p>to not let him do anything,</p>
<p>but then you can&rsquo;t be offensive</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re using all your strength</p>
<p>to hold onto the situation.</p>
<p>So I was getting really aggravated</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t generate any offense</p>
<p>with every time I felt like I gained an advantage</p>
<p>in the gripping scenario,</p>
<p>he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like,</p>
<p>well, now I&rsquo;ve got to go address this thing,</p>
<p>give up what I gained and I have to go back.</p>
<p>And if I were to think about watching the match now,</p>
<p>it probably looked like a lot of flailing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just trying to generate enough</p>
<p>to not get a penalty,</p>
<p>but also not enough to where he could counter it.</p>
<p>Did you think you could beat him</p>
<p>like when you were walking into the match?</p>
<p>Until I gripped him for the first time,</p>
<p>like, cause I had trained with him before,</p>
<p>he felt stronger and more in shape</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;ve ever felt him that day.</p>
<p>At that Olympics, which begs a whole nother question.</p>
<p>But I remember when he grabbed me for that first time,</p>
<p>I went, this is different.</p>
<p>And there was a sense of panic at the time</p>
<p>cause I was like, holy crap, where did this come from?</p>
<p>This is not the guy that I&rsquo;ve trained with that I expected.</p>
<p>Cause it was a definite like level change</p>
<p>in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina.</p>
<p>Like looking back at that, can you explain that?</p>
<p>Is it just you being more, less confident</p>
<p>because it was the Olympics?</p>
<p>It was, is there some kind of routine that he followed</p>
<p>to like really level up in intensity</p>
<p>for this particular event?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that he only gets to like his prime</p>
<p>for like really big events.</p>
<p>Like he doesn&rsquo;t train like year round like I would train,</p>
<p>but when it comes to like the games,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t do social media, he doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>he lives, breathes, eats his training for the games,</p>
<p>which could institute that level.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Is there a, like Dan Gable famously said,</p>
<p>like the one loss he had in college,</p>
<p>he was doing a lot of media and stuff.</p>
<p>Back then there was no social media.</p>
<p>That was a huge mistake for him.</p>
<p>Do you do social media, do you do like?</p>
<p>At that, at this point?</p>
<p>Well, at that time it was like AOL.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what&rsquo;s 2008?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even have a Facebook page, a MySpace,</p>
<p>nothing at this point.</p>
<p>I got my first Facebook page from the USOC in 2012.</p>
<p>When I went through the media thing,</p>
<p>the lady was like, you have to have it.</p>
<p>I go, I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like people.</p>
<p>I want to deal with the people.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>You know, like the social part of the social media.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have to bring this up because,</p>
<p>and then you went on to face Tiago Camilo.</p>
<p>You lost that match, but he went on to win bronze.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also an interesting one, but we can skip ahead.</p>
<p>I just remember being really impressed</p>
<p>both by your groundwork.</p>
<p>That was a match I should have won.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I should have won that.</p>
<p>I was, if you don&rsquo;t know judo,</p>
<p>you would visually watch that and be like, I&rsquo;m winning.</p>
<p>But he was technically winning on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>So it is what it is.</p>
<p>But the point that he got that solidified his win,</p>
<p>yes, it was a point back in those days.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t say anything, but like my shoulder</p>
<p>nicked the ground.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah. A lot of the stories of your Olympic career</p>
<p>is like from a fan perspective,</p>
<p>it seems like you should have won</p>
<p>or you very close to could have won.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of frustration in you</p>
<p>and your game being like shut down in certain ways.</p>
<p>But like the thing that immediately grabbed me in 2008</p>
<p>was how much, something about the way you approached judo,</p>
<p>how much you wanted to win.</p>
<p>Cause I was young then.</p>
<p>I was, when I was at this time of my career,</p>
<p>I was out to like win.</p>
<p>Like there was no like, I&rsquo;m going to grab you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to throw you.</p>
<p>And if not, you&rsquo;re going to go through a battle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to make sure you earned it.</p>
<p>It so happened that you competing in 2008,</p>
<p>I was, I became a fan of yours at that moment.</p>
<p>And since then, I kind of knew about judo.</p>
<p>My university had a judo club</p>
<p>and I kind of knew about jujitsu from mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>And obviously I wrestled for many years before</p>
<p>and I love wrestling,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about you competing that made me,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s no other way to say it,</p>
<p>but it like changed the direction of my life.</p>
<p>Cause it forced me to say, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start judo and jujitsu.</p>
<p>And first of all, for that, I&rsquo;m really grateful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fascinating to think,</p>
<p>because this kid who&rsquo;s 22 years old,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one that you&rsquo;ve influenced,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve changed the direction of my life.</p>
<p>And there could be huge number of others like that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the power of you as an individual</p>
<p>at the, on the Olympic stage.</p>
<p>You ever think about the pressure of that?</p>
<p>Did you, did you think as a 22 year old,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people,</p>
<p>like I know I&rsquo;m not the only one who changed.</p>
<p>I just happened to have like a microphone recently.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, is that, it&rsquo;s fascinating to think about, right?</p>
<p>Like you, perhaps you didn&rsquo;t think about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just a judo match,</p>
<p>but you like, you influenced hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>if not millions.</p>
<p>Is that interesting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not something that really hit me</p>
<p>until 2012 when I lost,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when like,</p>
<p>I would say like the world felt bad for me at that point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you knew that like people were watching</p>
<p>and people were inspired by the loss</p>
<p>because of how much went into that match.</p>
<p>Because, you know, the 99% of us who watched it</p>
<p>thought I won, except for the 1% of the people</p>
<p>who were considered judges at that day in the event.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s the, the win or lose,</p>
<p>that, that was a really inspiring match.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when it, that&rsquo;s when it dinged that like,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t watch something</p>
<p>and really get inspired by like the person and the act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, it&rsquo;s an accumulative thing.</p>
<p>But for a lot of people, like when they watch</p>
<p>how much goes into it,</p>
<p>and then when I broke down on the match,</p>
<p>like the amount of suffering that happens</p>
<p>when you lose a match like that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, really coming back and winning in Rio,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trend of people who were inspired</p>
<p>that knew about London.</p>
<p>And then when they found out I won in Rio,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when like people like in droves felt like</p>
<p>they could overcome their own personal obstacles</p>
<p>to still achieve something</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve witnessed somebody who&rsquo;s fallen</p>
<p>and gotten back up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not something that you think about like on the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you look back and you go, oh, cause and effect.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can comment on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to realize and live up to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s like young people that come up to me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m starting to realize like certain words I say</p>
<p>will have a long lasting impact on them.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Cause you say it as like, you don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t just, the whim.</p>
<p>Some of them might come back 30 years later</p>
<p>and a word I said was the reason they quit a thing</p>
<p>and started the new thing that led them</p>
<p>to become their true self, like to find success,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff like.</p>
<p>On the flip side though, some people based on the actions</p>
<p>that we do today, even with this cast</p>
<p>will alter the course of their lives forever.</p>
<p>I had a guy one time, was it after London?</p>
<p>It must&rsquo;ve been after London.</p>
<p>He actually found me on Instagram,</p>
<p>wrote me what seemed to be like a dissertation on Instagram</p>
<p>about how much I disrespected him</p>
<p>14 years earlier because I didn&rsquo;t step on a podium</p>
<p>to take a picture after winning a tournament</p>
<p>where he bronzed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself, like at the time,</p>
<p>like having dinner with my family</p>
<p>because I had to leave the next morning</p>
<p>was more important to me as a person,</p>
<p>not thinking about who you potentially will become</p>
<p>and the actions of whatever you do today,</p>
<p>if you do become quote unquote famous</p>
<p>or somebody in a spotlight,</p>
<p>that that could come back to bite you.</p>
<p>To me, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super motivating,</p>
<p>like not to be a lesser version of myself ever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just be on top of your game, whatever that game is,</p>
<p>be on top of your game when you interacting with people</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re just in your own private life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the exactly same person privately</p>
<p>as I am publicly and like making sure I&rsquo;m on point.</p>
<p>I see like just hanging out with Joe Rogan a lot.</p>
<p>I see how he&rsquo;s, first of all, the exact same person.</p>
<p>And second, he like walks around</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like a huge number of fans</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll just take pictures and like, it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very cognizant of like certain words he says,</p>
<p>especially young people, like they&rsquo;re going to take that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be a memory for them</p>
<p>for a couple of years that might be influential</p>
<p>for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s a cool responsibility,</p>
<p>not to fuck it up.</p>
<p>But anyway, I bring all that up to just say, thank you.</p>
<p>So even if you like were frustrated</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t win a medal,</p>
<p>at least you influenced one silly Russian kid</p>
<p>to get into the martial arts.</p>
<p>And what happens when you get into martial arts,</p>
<p>it alters the direction of your life.</p>
<p>Mine for the better.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go to London 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic judo battles of all time rematch.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve reached the semifinals once again</p>
<p>to face the German, Ole Bischoff.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we step through that match a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, by all means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only ever watched the entire thing one time</p>
<p>just because, fucking.</p>
<p>So for context, for the listener,</p>
<p>Travis, first of all, you don&rsquo;t like losing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fair to say.</p>
<p>You know, the hard part with this match</p>
<p>is because I went into this Olympics thinking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fucking win the Olympics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best in the world.</p>
<p>I never in my right mind thought,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m gonna win a medal.</p>
<p>Like that never crossed my mind.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I would have rather him just fucking beat me.</p>
<p>Because then I lost.</p>
<p>So here the referees, as many people thought,</p>
<p>robbed you of a victory,</p>
<p>but it was also a really close battle.</p>
<p>Again, with many of the elements of frustration as 2008</p>
<p>in terms of strategically and gripping wise.</p>
<p>And it was just a fascinating battle that went to overtime.</p>
<p>So can you set the context?</p>
<p>So what did the bracket look like?</p>
<p>Who were the players here?</p>
<p>Who did you beat leading up to this match?</p>
<p>As you walk onto the mat, what happened the hours before?</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re standing there.</p>
<p>How bad is it when two people are standing like this?</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>That fucking guy, man.</p>
<p>But this bracket was really interesting</p>
<p>if you look at like the backstory of 81 kilos,</p>
<p>like leading up to the Olympics, right?</p>
<p>Because at this point in time,</p>
<p>I was inside the top 10 at all times,</p>
<p>eight, seven, five, four, sixes.</p>
<p>I fell out of there sometimes due to injuries,</p>
<p>but I always climbed back in.</p>
<p>There was another guy from Azerbaijan</p>
<p>that was the Olympic champion at 73 kilos in 2008.</p>
<p>And the entire division got rocked by match one</p>
<p>because his first match was with Antoine Valus Fortier</p>
<p>of Canada.</p>
<p>And everybody who saw the draw come out was like,</p>
<p>the Azerbaijanis gonna win it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the former Olympic champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty much won most of the major events,</p>
<p>including at 90 kilos, because he just had smooth judo.</p>
<p>And match one rolls around, match two rolls around.</p>
<p>Antoine&rsquo;s in the shoot and he&rsquo;s looking around</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, the Azerbaijanis not here.</p>
<p>Well, where is he?</p>
<p>No joke, he runs into the venue a match before,</p>
<p>throws his gi on and runs onto the Olympic platform.</p>
<p>Loses to the Canadian</p>
<p>in like a three minute golden score battle.</p>
<p>So do you think he warmed up?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t, he ran.</p>
<p>He literally ran into the venue,</p>
<p>threw his gi on and ran out, did no judo.</p>
<p>And there you see Antoine losing in the quarters.</p>
<p>So how good was Antoine?</p>
<p>At this point in time, this is,</p>
<p>I believe his first international medal</p>
<p>was the Olympic games.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever meddled in Paris.</p>
<p>He went into this bracket unranked,</p>
<p>beating the ranked guy first round because he,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he missed the bus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he was off his cycle and planned on losing</p>
<p>cause he didn&rsquo;t want to test positive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of like questionable things out there</p>
<p>that could have potentially caused him to,</p>
<p>run onto the Olympic platform for match one.</p>
<p>But it catapulted Antoine into like a belief</p>
<p>that like, I beat the seated guy, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>And that was like a turning point in the Canadian&rsquo;s career</p>
<p>just as a whole, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that everybody has a defining moment.</p>
<p>Like mine was when I beat Bischoff in Dusseldorf</p>
<p>at the grand prix for Germany after 2008, right?</p>
<p>I beat the Olympic champion in, on his home soil</p>
<p>to go win the entire tournament.</p>
<p>So we all have like those moments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just when it happens at the games,</p>
<p>it throws the bracket like into a tailspin.</p>
<p>Cause typically you&rsquo;d know like who&rsquo;s going to beat who,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And when you look at my quarter final against the Brazilian,</p>
<p>what most people don&rsquo;t know is I was,</p>
<p>I was so thankful I had that match.</p>
<p>Most people would never in a million years be like,</p>
<p>I want to fight the world number one at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to do.</p>
<p>I want to be the eighth seed fighting the world number one</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m going to win.</p>
<p>I was pissed off at him.</p>
<p>I was so angry because we,</p>
<p>we were at the Pan Am&rsquo;s I think the year before</p>
<p>and there was a team tournament and I wanted to fight him.</p>
<p>I had lost the quarters to a Cuban, I think.</p>
<p>In like the first gripping exchange,</p>
<p>he threw me with a drop sale out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I was pissed.</p>
<p>So I wanted my hands on the Brazilian and the team match.</p>
<p>Well, the Brazilian team is warming up.</p>
<p>So I walk up to him, no joke.</p>
<p>I walked up to him and I go, you&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>And he goes, not today.</p>
<p>And I went, are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>I warmed up.</p>
<p>I taped up that you&rsquo;re the only fucking guy I want to fight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to fucking sit in the stands</p>
<p>and read a goddamn book.</p>
<p>I was so angry.</p>
<p>I carried that anger cause I never fought him until this day.</p>
<p>I was fucking pissed.</p>
<p>I was ready to beat him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, I forgot he was the world number one.</p>
<p>Cause I remember being really excited at that match.</p>
<p>How did you beat him?</p>
<p>I threw him with two hands on the same side, collar,</p>
<p>like drop sale.</p>
<p>I cross gripped, I yanked him behind me and I threw him.</p>
<p>Epon?</p>
<p>Wazari.</p>
<p>And then the match ended 30 seconds later.</p>
<p>I was pumped.</p>
<p>So fucking angry.</p>
<p>I thought, okay, if I&rsquo;m remembering correctly,</p>
<p>I thought, okay, this guy might actually win gold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made, for me as a spectator,</p>
<p>remembering now the next match that much more like painful.</p>
<p>And then the fans of judo that really followed the sport,</p>
<p>the stats, when you look at the games and my draws,</p>
<p>I had the worst possible draw</p>
<p>as you ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>At both London and Rio, I fought the world number one</p>
<p>to get to the final or into the semis or past the semis.</p>
<p>And everybody I fought in the draw</p>
<p>either beat me the last time we fought</p>
<p>or I had never fought before.</p>
<p>So I always held a loss going onto the mat</p>
<p>at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you feel about that, by the way?</p>
<p>Like what were your feelings</p>
<p>about facing the Brazilian first?</p>
<p>I was so excited.</p>
<p>Well, that was match three.</p>
<p>In London, I fought the Slovenian guy first round</p>
<p>who beat me.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d he beat me?</p>
<p>Was it the Worlds?</p>
<p>Might&rsquo;ve been the Worlds.</p>
<p>And then, Church&rsquo;s Ville, I fought in the second round</p>
<p>who threw me for Wazari in Japan.</p>
<p>And then, Leandro, who I don&rsquo;t think I ever fought,</p>
<p>who was world number one.</p>
<p>That avoided fighting me at the team tournament.</p>
<p>But I mean, every single Olympics you&rsquo;ve fought</p>
<p>and you really stepped up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only tournament I&rsquo;ve ever prepped for.</p>
<p>Mentally and physically and just the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We never trained through this tournament</p>
<p>like we did for the others.</p>
<p>Or I would go into it injured.</p>
<p>All right, well, let&rsquo;s talk about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re standing there next to the German.</p>
<p>He looked always smaller than you,</p>
<p>but you said like strong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what are you feeling now, Jimmy Pedro behind you?</p>
<p>I was fucking ready to take his head off.</p>
<p>Did you have an idea of what you&rsquo;re gonna do?</p>
<p>Did you try to, do you&rsquo;re thinking of winning by Ypon?</p>
<p>Were you thinking like going for big throws,</p>
<p>or take him in deep waters, outgrip him?</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>We were about to have a battle</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t gonna throw him until he broke mentally.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That was, there was no like,</p>
<p>oh, this is gonna be a clean throw.</p>
<p>That was never, that was never the thought process.</p>
<p>So here, you know there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of gripping.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing a shit ton of gripping.</p>
<p>And right here, he throws it, bang, close fisted.</p>
<p>You got a lot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>You seem calm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pissed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pissed.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t look serious, you just look like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the ref like,</p>
<p>cause he keeps telling me to get up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I have blood running down my face.</p>
<p>I go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here, there&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>See, and he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, go fix it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s on your eyebrow somewhere?</p>
<p>Yeah, he split it just underneath it.</p>
<p>So you split your eyebrow.</p>
<p>And so in judo, they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re allergic to blood,</p>
<p>probably for a good reason.</p>
<p>But they, so now you have to try to figure out</p>
<p>how to tape that up.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Which already sets up one of the most bad ass</p>
<p>looks in judo history.</p>
<p>First 15 seconds, busted my eye open.</p>
<p>Was that getting in the way of your eyesight at all or no?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Damn, he looks good at gripping.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to get a grip on that guy?</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m struggling just to get my hand in the collar</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t even blocking it.</p>
<p>Is he being cagey?</p>
<p>Remember like, is he interested in offense?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very cagey, you know, methodical player.</p>
<p>Like he, he never opens himself up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>You grabbed the leg as part of a combination.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And people have told me that he&rsquo;s actually very good</p>
<p>at throwing people.</p>
<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, but he just doesn&rsquo;t show it at these.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Cause he, he doesn&rsquo;t care how he wins.</p>
<p>He cares that he wins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which makes him very difficult to beat.</p>
<p>Cause he knows when you&rsquo;ve strategized to do that,</p>
<p>where you look at the rule set and you develop a plan</p>
<p>to get through the matches,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve really got to figure out a way</p>
<p>to get that person off that game plan.</p>
<p>You know, whether you get ahead by a penalty or something.</p>
<p>Right there.</p>
<p>Like, he wouldn&rsquo;t give me the sleeve,</p>
<p>so I grabbed all of his fingers.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>In which I open like, like this way or?</p>
<p>I grabbed them the other way and I started lifting them.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I start, nice.</p>
<p>Oh, like perfect.</p>
<p>Reverse play and mercy.</p>
<p>Like this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, this is great.</p>
<p>Cause he wouldn&rsquo;t give me the sleeve</p>
<p>and I needed an attack.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, okay, I can&rsquo;t hold onto this forever</p>
<p>cause that judge is going to see it.</p>
<p>So let me just do a quick throw here</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m using the fingers in the mercy grip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I just sit out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then he goes to get up and I go to get on top</p>
<p>and right here.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>That elbow.</p>
<p>You get him?</p>
<p>Oh, you got him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it looks like I elbow him.</p>
<p>Did you do it kind of?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At the time, I never knew this happened</p>
<p>until after I watched this like three or four years later.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t even know, I didn&rsquo;t even feel it.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s legitimately angry here.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s angry.</p>
<p>And of course you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>Why would you move?</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>This moment right there is gold.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not watching this on video, you&rsquo;re missing out.</p>
<p>You never get this in judo.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s ever happened.</p>
<p>That little face off.</p>
<p>Especially on a stage like this.</p>
<p>The reference.</p>
<p>And then he brings us in to like talk to us</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, hey, we&rsquo;re good, right?</p>
<p>Like, you guys aren&rsquo;t about to do</p>
<p>what I think you&rsquo;re about to do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, hey, shake hands again.</p>
<p>Cause the first time we did it, that wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>Well, you gotta do it again.</p>
<p>The heartbreaking part about this</p>
<p>and why the IJF switched it to an unlimited golden score.</p>
<p>Because we fought five minutes</p>
<p>through the entire normal part of the match.</p>
<p>And then we did the entire overtime period of three minutes.</p>
<p>Not one penalty was given.</p>
<p>No gripping infractions, no false attacks,</p>
<p>like no stallings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Nobody was really backing up.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I mean, he was, you know.</p>
<p>So what was Jimmy telling you here?</p>
<p>Or was he talking to you at all?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not allowed to talk during medical things</p>
<p>and my nose is now broken.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also, oh, the nose is broken.</p>
<p>From what?</p>
<p>I caught an elbow from him.</p>
<p>Glad his face is clean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And right here, I was pissed.</p>
<p>I was so angry at the medic</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s fumbling around and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>my whole plan is to break the German mentally.</p>
<p>You gotta hurry up with the tape, man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s supposed to be tired.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not supposed to be resting.</p>
<p>Is Jimmy yelling here?</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, not here, not here, but during the match.</p>
<p>And you can see I just take it from him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, give it to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it myself.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>How scared is the medic?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, this guy&rsquo;s gonna kill me.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t even tear the tape.</p>
<p>Look how nervous he is.</p>
<p>We made fun of him for this so much throughout the years.</p>
<p>Still do to this day.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, you look great getting geared up.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t really see, don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Was there some outcome in your mind</p>
<p>that you could possibly beat him on the ground</p>
<p>with a submission or a pin?</p>
<p>You knew you were gonna have to throw him.</p>
<p>I knew I was gonna have to.</p>
<p>If I was gonna throw him or armbar him</p>
<p>or pin him, whatever the case may be,</p>
<p>it was gonna be his mental like, I&rsquo;m just tired of this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s too cagey of a player.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s too experienced.</p>
<p>He has to mentally make that choice to give that inch.</p>
<p>And then you just have to be ready to take it.</p>
<p>So I was just waiting for it.</p>
<p>And so now this is four minutes in, one minute left.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, is that in your game plan two potentials</p>
<p>like sumi gaeshi, like the sacrifice throws to him?</p>
<p>Cause the whole point of that technique</p>
<p>and the sacrifice throws wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because I thought I was gonna throw him,</p>
<p>but it disrupts the pattern enough</p>
<p>to like get him to make a potential mistake.</p>
<p>Like see, he should have gotten Ashido there.</p>
<p>Hands in the face.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s just part of judo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He poked me in the elbow.</p>
<p>This is a rough match.</p>
<p>Does he act at all or no?</p>
<p>Like, was he acting frustrated or anything like that?</p>
<p>It was all like, he&rsquo;s like acting for the ref.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, oh, that, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going in hard, nonstop,</p>
<p>like angry, aggressive, feeling cardio here at all.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t get tired during this.</p>
<p>And then just always pressing for.</p>
<p>Time runs out.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re into golden score.</p>
<p>12 minutes and 38 seconds later.</p>
<p>Yeah, you think about every judo exchange, right?</p>
<p>Every time we grip up, every time we attack,</p>
<p>sometimes it can take longer to get back to the line</p>
<p>than the entire exchange.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have,</p>
<p>the longer the time stretches.</p>
<p>Then here, the six seconds left in golden score,</p>
<p>your tape is now yellow and red</p>
<p>with sweat and blood, literally, and time is out.</p>
<p>Now, what are you thinking here?</p>
<p>Do you think you won the match?</p>
<p>I thought I won the match a minute ago.</p>
<p>I remember thinking to myself,</p>
<p>like if this goes to the flags, I won.</p>
<p>No doubt in my mind.</p>
<p>Because I felt like the whole time,</p>
<p>like I was going to him, right?</p>
<p>He was never coming at me.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way it felt.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s the way it felt body language wise,</p>
<p>just the intensity, how fast you&rsquo;re moving towards him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly going for throws.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to rewind that,</p>
<p>we can talk about the whole,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a part of this clip.</p>
<p>So wait a minute, they all went blue.</p>
<p>They all did.</p>
<p>So in judo, there&rsquo;s three referees,</p>
<p>two on the side, one in the center,</p>
<p>and they all vote on who won.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s pause it right there.</p>
<p>Now, the way this is supposed to work,</p>
<p>they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count,</p>
<p>and then on three, they all raise it together.</p>
<p>Now, as a little pretext to this entire match,</p>
<p>up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games</p>
<p>has ever been a split decision.</p>
<p>Meaning out of three people,</p>
<p>not one of them voted against the other group members.</p>
<p>So they were all unified blue or all unified white.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Which is statistically difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they had a referee meeting and said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better for the Olympics.</p>
<p>To never have a split.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the question becomes,</p>
<p>if you would click that frame by frame, right?</p>
<p>So right now we have all the refs with their flags out</p>
<p>and then click that.</p>
<p>So the middle guy starts.</p>
<p>He is all the way up.</p>
<p>All the way up.</p>
<p>The other side judges haven&rsquo;t moved.</p>
<p>We now have one side ref all the way up.</p>
<p>Then we have a third side ref all the way up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a time point</p>
<p>when the middle guy has the flag all the way up.</p>
<p>If not 80, 90% of the way there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then the other one does.</p>
<p>And then the third one goes.</p>
<p>So now the question becomes who really,</p>
<p>like did the outside refs really have an opinion?</p>
<p>Or were they told to wait for the center one to start</p>
<p>and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, honestly, it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that they had this meeting.</p>
<p>This is the problem with the Olympics.</p>
<p>They sometimes, it&rsquo;s also the problem in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>with communism.</p>
<p>They think the committee knows what&rsquo;s good for the people</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So they decide universally</p>
<p>as opposed to letting the magic of the Olympics</p>
<p>be what it is.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, in this case,</p>
<p>the center ref decided blue.</p>
<p>Like what do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s just a shitty call?</p>
<p>Or like?</p>
<p>He has the right to pick.</p>
<p>But the problem is the other two I don&rsquo;t think did.</p>
<p>And so when you do this frame by frame again,</p>
<p>I can see from my own perspective two of the refs.</p>
<p>And I see them both blue.</p>
<p>So when you fast forward that a little bit</p>
<p>to get to all the flags, I see the two go blue.</p>
<p>And I go, I look over and I look at the other guy</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>All three?</p>
<p>I fought for eight minutes and I can&rsquo;t even get a vote.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even get a penalty.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even get a vote.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I broke.</p>
<p>I like, oh, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, he looked shocked.</p>
<p>And here you&rsquo;re on your knees.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re crying.</p>
<p>Literally crying.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s the end.</p>
<p>That was such an amazing match.</p>
<p>It was such a war.</p>
<p>I mean, both people can&rsquo;t believe what happened.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, and like, honestly,</p>
<p>I wish we had the rules that we do today,</p>
<p>as far as the unlimited golden score,</p>
<p>because I would have loved to have seen</p>
<p>what would have happened.</p>
<p>What was Jimmy saying here to you?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there&rsquo;s nothing to say.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was kind of apologizing for the way</p>
<p>the scores went.</p>
<p>Cause he knows how badly you want it.</p>
<p>He saw the match.</p>
<p>And he felt I deserved to win it.</p>
<p>Based on like, you know, what happened.</p>
<p>But he probably with all his experience</p>
<p>knows that this is what the Olympics are about.</p>
<p>The refs sometimes.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the magic of it, man.</p>
<p>Well, and at the same time we&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the Olympic semi final</p>
<p>in a sport that&rsquo;s dominated by certain continents.</p>
<p>And when you look at the three refs on the mat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all European.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling me there couldn&rsquo;t have been one Pan Am,</p>
<p>one African, one Oceana, you know, different.</p>
<p>Like, why&rsquo;d they all have to be European?</p>
<p>But to be fair, it&rsquo;s back to your sauna story.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve dealt with this stuff before.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve won over this stuff before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, like, I was broken for life.</p>
<p>And you thought you won here, that was.</p>
<p>And when I hindered on that for a year and a half,</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t even stand, I was done.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a slow motion replay</p>
<p>on this when I watched it.</p>
<p>Hey, he&rsquo;s all excited, that fucking guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s all happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relief.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hi guys.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Look at those teeth.</p>
<p>My teeth are red.</p>
<p>Slow motion replay of the flag being raised,</p>
<p>the heart being broken, Travis just bending over.</p>
<p>Right here, watch.</p>
<p>Watch his reaction.</p>
<p>Like, he, like, you could see his mouth, like,</p>
<p>open in awe, like, really?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s looking at two refs just like I am.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t celebrate until he looked at the third one</p>
<p>and said, oh, all three.</p>
<p>So you think he knew he lost?</p>
<p>I think in his head, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he really believed he was winning.</p>
<p>He did enough to win, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because when his mouth dropped, like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, hey, all three.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not really the reaction you would give.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that was,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the greatest matches I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s painful for you,</p>
<p>but that pain, first of all, sets the stage for 2016.</p>
<p>But even without that,</p>
<p>I think it was just a beautiful story at the Olympics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve still did incredible job at that Olympics.</p>
<p>You stood toe to toe.</p>
<p>I think in hindsight, having lost that match</p>
<p>did more for me and more for the sport.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>As a whole, me losing that match.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, stories aren&rsquo;t about winning.</p>
<p>Stories are about the fighting.</p>
<p>So, and that made one hell of a story.</p>
<p>But it also has to do with, you know,</p>
<p>you know, treachery is probably not the right word to use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the wrong word entirely to use.</p>
<p>But because of the conflict in the match</p>
<p>and because of how the refs handled the match there</p>
<p>at the end, it created controversy</p>
<p>that was spoken about for months on world media, right?</p>
<p>I remember articles being written about the Olympics</p>
<p>and, you know, the refing and how it was corrupt</p>
<p>and that match was one of them.</p>
<p>There was another one in fencing</p>
<p>where like something happened with the timer</p>
<p>where one of the fencers, I guess what happens in fencing,</p>
<p>the timer resets up a second if it&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>So the fencer got one second played out,</p>
<p>I think like 27 or 28 times and then one on like 30.</p>
<p>So like there was like clock fixing for fencing.</p>
<p>There was this match that I think just got publicity,</p>
<p>good or bad.</p>
<p>Publicity is publicity for judo.</p>
<p>And then you came back to, I mean,</p>
<p>this is the hard thing after this heartbreak</p>
<p>to step up and continue fighting, right?</p>
<p>I really, really struggled.</p>
<p>Like unbelievably struggled from 2012 to like 2014.</p>
<p>I almost quit numerous times.</p>
<p>I was so angry.</p>
<p>I mean, at one point I got so mad at the IGF</p>
<p>feeling like they were fucking me every step of the way.</p>
<p>I threw a water bottle at a referee after a match.</p>
<p>I cussed out a referee one time on a mat.</p>
<p>I got suspended from the sport</p>
<p>because I was just so angry at that point in time.</p>
<p>And IGF is the International Judo Federation</p>
<p>and are they the people that supply the referees</p>
<p>basically like the certification?</p>
<p>They kind of run the sport on a global scale.</p>
<p>So you sent a few emails 2014, 15, basically quitting.</p>
<p>One of them said I&rsquo;m mentally and physically broken.</p>
<p>Another said, well, the subject line, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>The weight cuts didn&rsquo;t break you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So if this broke you,</p>
<p>you were really going through a hard time.</p>
<p>I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna like dumb it down a little bit</p>
<p>and get some wins under our belt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to a world cup,</p>
<p>which is like three stages down or four stages down</p>
<p>from like the Olympic games.</p>
<p>Like this should be like a cake walk.</p>
<p>Like making the final of a world cup</p>
<p>should be a walk in the park.</p>
<p>I show up.</p>
<p>I barely beat a 16 year old kid, barely.</p>
<p>Then I got smoked in the second round.</p>
<p>I got thrown three times.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m fucking done.</p>
<p>They changed all the fucking rules.</p>
<p>They fucked me out of the Olympics.</p>
<p>Like, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>And it was at that moment when I wrote the email</p>
<p>where I remember sitting at a bar,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink by the way,</p>
<p>but I was sitting at a bar at the hotel sending this email</p>
<p>and I got a response back from Jimmy and he goes,</p>
<p>well, just stay for the training camp,</p>
<p>go to Germany and then whatever happens,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk when you get home.</p>
<p>I was like, fuck that, fuck these people, fuck the rules.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking care anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna do judo the way I wanna do judo.</p>
<p>If I fucking get shit out, fuck them.</p>
<p>That was my response.</p>
<p>Can you become an Olympic champion?</p>
<p>Can you become an Olympic medalist?</p>
<p>With that kind of thinking, you think or no?</p>
<p>Was that, that&rsquo;s counterproductive?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, just checking because maybe that&rsquo;s also liberating.</p>
<p>The expectation was no longer</p>
<p>that Travis is gonna win this tournament.</p>
<p>The expectation was Travis is gonna come home</p>
<p>and be fucking pissed off</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>how to manage a pissed off person that&rsquo;s trying to quit</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be quitting.</p>
<p>And did people still believe</p>
<p>that you can be a medalist again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like who believed that?</p>
<p>Jimmy believed it, the team managers believed it,</p>
<p>some of my teammates still believed it,</p>
<p>my training partners still did,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the ones that are cutting the weight,</p>
<p>flying around, feeling like all of your Judo</p>
<p>is now null and void, right?</p>
<p>Because at this point, they took away leg grabs entirely.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t break a grip with two hands, right?</p>
<p>The meta of Judo has changed again, right?</p>
<p>So I got fucked out of it.</p>
<p>They took away how I did Judo again</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s just got more difficult.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m sitting in the hotel and I&rsquo;m sending this email,</p>
<p>I remember being at the training camp,</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t even fucking care what the rules are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking throw people,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care if I&rsquo;m cheating,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, I&rsquo;ll just play stupid, right?</p>
<p>So I just started going back and doing Judo</p>
<p>without the leg grabs,</p>
<p>but with all the same gripping that I was doing beforehand.</p>
<p>And then when I got to Germany,</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t fucking care.</p>
<p>I was like, if I gotta cheat to win,</p>
<p>then I gotta fucking cheat to win.</p>
<p>If I get sheeted out, then I get sheeted out</p>
<p>and I won Germany.</p>
<p>Which event in Germany?</p>
<p>The German Grand Prix, which was a week</p>
<p>after losing the World Cup.</p>
<p>Because I was trying to do Judo around the new rule set.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t just trying to do Judo, right?</p>
<p>Because when you get to the highest level,</p>
<p>your game tends to morph around</p>
<p>what can you can or cannot get away with.</p>
<p>I was more focused on trying to figure out</p>
<p>what I can and can&rsquo;t get away with</p>
<p>and I stopped actively doing Judo.</p>
<p>Once I said, fuck whatever the rule changes are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna keep doing Judo</p>
<p>the way I know how to do Judo</p>
<p>and if I get a penalty, then so be it.</p>
<p>And so that win, that started the road back.</p>
<p>The road back, yeah.</p>
<p>Cause now it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t care if you penalize me or not</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna throw that guy anyways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna beat him anyways.</p>
<p>And if I get a Shido for doing something wrong,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll just stop doing that one thing</p>
<p>and just keep doing all the other things</p>
<p>that they told me I probably shouldn&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not calling me on it</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna keep doing it.</p>
<p>Well, you found yourself at the 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>Was that ever a doubt, by the way,</p>
<p>after this, after 2014 in Germany?</p>
<p>I had a lot of doubt after the concussion in 2015.</p>
<p>I remember when I first came back</p>
<p>after four months of nothingness</p>
<p>that even trying to train,</p>
<p>the room would start to tilt the world on me.</p>
<p>And then when I finally got over that</p>
<p>and I could start doing things again,</p>
<p>I stepped on the mat for the Pan Ams</p>
<p>and I was like, drowning&rsquo;s not the right word</p>
<p>but everything was being done in such a slow motion.</p>
<p>I had sandbags everywhere that I just couldn&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>Like mental fog.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember fighting the Brazilian</p>
<p>in the semifinal of Pan Ams.</p>
<p>I was halfway through this match</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like, eyes roll up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking wing it.</p>
<p>And I just fucking winged it</p>
<p>and I got countered and thrown free pwn</p>
<p>and I was like, I don&rsquo;t even know what to do.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t even think clearly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I was like, I may not come back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have control over how to come back from this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just your mind</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not operating correctly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I can like,</p>
<p>oh, my right hand&rsquo;s not working because it&rsquo;s fractured.</p>
<p>Let me figure out a way I can not use that.</p>
<p>Like when your mind&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the one thing you need.</p>
<p>Like you gotta have it.</p>
<p>So I can work through anything else.</p>
<p>I needed that though.</p>
<p>And so how did you come back from that time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I wrote another email and I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking off team USA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fucking, I&rsquo;m all done with USA judo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with the tour.</p>
<p>I was like, I quit.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna go do my own thing.</p>
<p>They were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t quit now.</p>
<p>Olympics is in like a year.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s talk about this again</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ve tried to quit</p>
<p>in like two years.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So then we sit down in Jimmy&rsquo;s office and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>whoa, whoa, whoa, you can&rsquo;t quit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kick yourself if you don&rsquo;t go to Rio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you right now, don&rsquo;t do that to yourself.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out a way of like doing this.</p>
<p>And I was like, because when we trained before,</p>
<p>we did it as a unit, right?</p>
<p>We all went to the same tournaments.</p>
<p>We all went to the same training camps.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you guys are treating me</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m the same player I used to be.</p>
<p>I go, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not operating</p>
<p>at the level you think I&rsquo;m operating at.</p>
<p>I go, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And he goes, well, what do you wanna do?</p>
<p>And I go, I&rsquo;ll tell you what Jimmy,</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m being serious because my answer</p>
<p>is something you&rsquo;d never would have expected.</p>
<p>I go, why don&rsquo;t you just send me to Japan for three weeks?</p>
<p>And he was like, really?</p>
<p>I hated Japan.</p>
<p>I refused to go there up until this point.</p>
<p>But I was like, I have to get to a point</p>
<p>where I can get so tired and get through it</p>
<p>that like my Judo will come back</p>
<p>and my body will learn again.</p>
<p>And when you say Japan, you mean the Kodokan,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s Tokai, is that the highest level of Judo?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the top colleges in the world, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so you can go with the best people in the world.</p>
<p>You can go to war with them.</p>
<p>Top level, like strong players.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of very strong players.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of middle class players</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of volume of rounds.</p>
<p>So you value all of it, the middle class too, like the.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re tired, like you can&rsquo;t just train</p>
<p>in areas where you&rsquo;re battling for every inch.</p>
<p>At some point you have to be successful, right?</p>
<p>So you still under duress and under strain</p>
<p>and through exhaustion,</p>
<p>you still have to have the ability to score.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re training with the best people</p>
<p>in the world all the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not always gonna be able to score.</p>
<p>So you still need those B level players</p>
<p>in order to really develop again.</p>
<p>What is it like, if you can comment briefly</p>
<p>on the training in Japan,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it like to go into a different place?</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t speak the language that well.</p>
<p>Like, is there an isolation aspect to it?</p>
<p>Is it like purely about judo now?</p>
<p>I really want it to be isolated.</p>
<p>No training partners, no coaches.</p>
<p>I want it to get back to my roots</p>
<p>and just learn how to fight again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna figure out how to beat the German.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna figure out how I can develop a new entry</p>
<p>into my sale against, you know, whoever it may be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You just wanna fight hard.</p>
<p>You just wanna fight.</p>
<p>Let me get back to fighting.</p>
<p>Let me get back to like the root of who I am.</p>
<p>What were those sessions like?</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Five minute rounds?</p>
<p>Like what, how many?</p>
<p>Six minute rounds, 30 minute breaks,</p>
<p>14 rounds a session.</p>
<p>Sorry, what&rsquo;s the 30 minute break?</p>
<p>30 second break.</p>
<p>Sorry, what?</p>
<p>14?</p>
<p>14 rounds.</p>
<p>Every day?</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>Like five days a week</p>
<p>and then 11 or 12 rounds on Saturday.</p>
<p>Plus weightlifting, plus running.</p>
<p>So those are hard rounds.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it feel like to go through that?</p>
<p>So you have a bunch of just a sea of black belts, Japan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re hunting you a little bit.</p>
<p>Depending on who you are.</p>
<p>I was hunted a little bit.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t really struggle because of who I am.</p>
<p>Them as college athletes,</p>
<p>they wanna show to their coaches</p>
<p>and their higher players,</p>
<p>like, oh look, I can throw the world number whoever.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just a guy who shows up,</p>
<p>like them beating you doesn&rsquo;t provide any value</p>
<p>or raise their status.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re status raising.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I was actually like in a situation</p>
<p>where nobody was watching me</p>
<p>and I was free to just battle at my own will.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which is what it was about for me.</p>
<p>And you just push yourself.</p>
<p>Because I knew how to do that.</p>
<p>I know how to push myself.</p>
<p>Are you, when you&rsquo;re doing these 14 rounds,</p>
<p>is every single one a standalone thing for you?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not trying to pace yourself?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Each one is to as much exhaustion as I can get.</p>
<p>But then there must be ones where like it&rsquo;s like round nine</p>
<p>where you got nothing left.</p>
<p>Better figure out how to score.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you gotta do.</p>
<p>You gotta survive and you gotta score.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your memories of that, of those three weeks?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like, what stands out to you?</p>
<p>It seems like,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s the place where you found the silver medal.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the place most people don&rsquo;t want to be.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s comfortable.</p>
<p>I would rather,</p>
<p>I would rather find out who I am and what I&rsquo;m made of</p>
<p>and find those, those end points.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t find them,</p>
<p>then that means everybody else has given up before me.</p>
<p>Were there a few people that just kinda,</p>
<p>you returned to battle over and over in those times</p>
<p>and then it was just.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>No social media.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>None of that, it&rsquo;s just like two men.</p>
<p>You lock yourself in your room,</p>
<p>you come back, you&rsquo;ve thought about it</p>
<p>and you come back with a game plan for that day.</p>
<p>Against some players here or there</p>
<p>and I would, I would develop a hit list.</p>
<p>Like I would be like,</p>
<p>oh, that motherfucker grabbed me at like 13</p>
<p>and I watched him sit fucking four rounds</p>
<p>and then come try to kick the shit out of me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fucking grab that guy early</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna beat the shit out of him.</p>
<p>And you just develop that list.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some epic battles in that room, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it look like?</p>
<p>Like how crowded is it?</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just like, yeah.</p>
<p>Just sea of people.</p>
<p>Sea of people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>are you doing groundwork at all?</p>
<p>Just throws.</p>
<p>No transitions, no nothing.</p>
<p>But if I get pissed off and like you keep dropping</p>
<p>or like not letting me do what I wanna do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll rip a choke right across your face.</p>
<p>Just to let you know that like,</p>
<p>and if I wanted to.</p>
<p>You have a really nice style of just like</p>
<p>respectfully bullying the shit out of people.</p>
<p>Cause some people call me a bully</p>
<p>and I have to remind them that like</p>
<p>a bully enjoys like beating up the weak.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I wanna beat the person that fights back.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun for me if you don&rsquo;t fight back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest people I&rsquo;ve seen like do this,</p>
<p>they basically,</p>
<p>you have this in the Iowa wrestling rooms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll push each other into the wall.</p>
<p>Like they get, there&rsquo;s like anger,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s ultimately underneath it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a deep respect.</p>
<p>I was training with Colton Brown one time</p>
<p>and I went to San Jose State</p>
<p>cause I was in California for something.</p>
<p>And he kept like,</p>
<p>he kept circling to the edge.</p>
<p>They had like a cupboard that had like,</p>
<p>when you opened it,</p>
<p>it had like all the tape and like medical supplies.</p>
<p>I was like, we&rsquo;ll fucking put you right through that.</p>
<p>And he kind of giggled.</p>
<p>And then he went by that edge</p>
<p>and I fucking ran him right through it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, to me, that&rsquo;s an ultimate sign of respect</p>
<p>that both you and Colton will remember well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still friends.</p>
<p>We still talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I told him I was gonna do it.</p>
<p>He knew I meant it too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He did it anyways.</p>
<p>That just tested me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Listen, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and that same attitude was,</p>
<p>that was in Japan just day after day after day after day.</p>
<p>14 rounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t sit out rounds?</p>
<p>And I did it all with a broken hand.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>How did you do it with a broken hand?</p>
<p>You show up every day.</p>
<p>You show up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which one, left or right?</p>
<p>My right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So you can then focus on gripping with your left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a way.</p>
<p>But that means you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t have to grip with your right sometimes.</p>
<p>I would palm it with my thumb just like hanging out</p>
<p>like this, just like this.</p>
<p>So you can do something.</p>
<p>So you can do like a Goshi,</p>
<p>cause you have a,</p>
<p>cause I,</p>
<p>what were your main throws?</p>
<p>It was Seinagi.</p>
<p>Koshiguruma.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sumi.</p>
<p>Uchimata.</p>
<p>But you have this big like a Goshi type of thing.</p>
<p>Like a.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not from like around the waist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from over the shoulder.</p>
<p>Over the shoulder.</p>
<p>And I can do it with just the one hand.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, which one hand?</p>
<p>The right one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need the sleeve hand.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need the sleeve hand,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t do it with the broken hand.</p>
<p>I could.</p>
<p>Cause I can just put my hand in the gi</p>
<p>so it can&rsquo;t come off.</p>
<p>And then you just,</p>
<p>cause what happened was three days</p>
<p>before I was leaving for Japan,</p>
<p>a guy, my hand was rested like this on a mat</p>
<p>and the guy, boom, took my whole thumb off</p>
<p>and tore all the tendons in the palm.</p>
<p>So when I went to the doctor, he was like,</p>
<p>you know, do we have to put a cast on it?</p>
<p>And I go, I&rsquo;m leaving in three days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not putting a cast on it.</p>
<p>And I go, this is what I want you to do.</p>
<p>Just like this, I said,</p>
<p>I want you to build a cast that holds it,</p>
<p>that Velcros around so that when I&rsquo;m not training,</p>
<p>I can wear it.</p>
<p>But then when I&rsquo;m training,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it off and then I&rsquo;ll put the tape on it.</p>
<p>And then whatever happens, happens.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, happens.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s Epic.</p>
<p>And that led you to the 2016 Olympics in Rio.</p>
<p>Well, that led me to winning Pan Am Gold</p>
<p>when I got back from Japan</p>
<p>and then almost getting my leg cut off in 2015.</p>
<p>That was like, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe a month or two later.</p>
<p>I was hospitalized for seven days.</p>
<p>The leg being cut off for what?</p>
<p>I had three different types of bacterial infections</p>
<p>in my right leg, a whole leg swelled.</p>
<p>And it was in my blood, skin and in my bone,</p>
<p>in my right leg.</p>
<p>So I got stuck at MGH in a hospital for seven days</p>
<p>until they figured out what the bacteria source was.</p>
<p>Where was the source of the infection?</p>
<p>Is it in the knee?</p>
<p>In the knee?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so obviously there&rsquo;s a danger of like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s life threatening.</p>
<p>Yep, so when I went into the emergency room,</p>
<p>when I got back from the Worlds,</p>
<p>the lady was like, hey, you need to call,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna call because you may lose your leg tonight.</p>
<p>And then they put me in the hospital.</p>
<p>What do you think of this whole time?</p>
<p>Are you still thinking about Olympics?</p>
<p>They put me into the room like four hours later,</p>
<p>the doctor came in.</p>
<p>I was at MGH in Boston and he was like,</p>
<p>you have a serious infection in your leg.</p>
<p>I go, he&rsquo;s like, we have to keep you hospitalized</p>
<p>until we can figure out what it is.</p>
<p>And I was like, buddy,</p>
<p>I have the Olympic games in less than a year.</p>
<p>I go, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what it is.</p>
<p>I go, just fucking take it out</p>
<p>and let me get on with my day.</p>
<p>He goes, we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I go, you told me it&rsquo;s infected,</p>
<p>just cut away that part of the tissue,</p>
<p>drain it, do whatever you gotta do</p>
<p>and then send me on my way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>He said, until we figure out what it is,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t figure out how to stop it from growing</p>
<p>or how far it spread.</p>
<p>So it took them seven days to figure out what it was.</p>
<p>Then once they figured out what it was,</p>
<p>I went in for surgery to remove it.</p>
<p>Then I spent, I think it was eight weeks</p>
<p>in home care with a PICC line.</p>
<p>And then I came back from that.</p>
<p>On the first week and a half of judo,</p>
<p>I tore my SI joint trying to throw a guy.</p>
<p>And then I came back from that about a month later</p>
<p>and then fifth at the Connell Cup.</p>
<p>And then the games six months later.</p>
<p>How quickly do doctors understand who they&rsquo;re dealing with?</p>
<p>Like, is that difficult for you to explain</p>
<p>who Travis Stevens is when you go to visit a doctor?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they understand, you know,</p>
<p>their role is to get me to do my job</p>
<p>to the best of their ability as a doctor.</p>
<p>Meaning, it&rsquo;s gonna be less than what they want.</p>
<p>And they struggle conceptually with like,</p>
<p>but the textbook tells me this.</p>
<p>And I go, but I&rsquo;m not a textbook, right?</p>
<p>Like when you go to physical therapy,</p>
<p>the first thing they do is they pull out that binder</p>
<p>that says day one, we do this exercise.</p>
<p>I go, but I have my own goals.</p>
<p>Your job is to help me meet my goal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work a plan to do that</p>
<p>or I gotta go find somebody else.</p>
<p>Did the doctors in general,</p>
<p>people outside of your close knit group step up?</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t, I found somebody else.</p>
<p>And typically I could find a person</p>
<p>who knew the right person.</p>
<p>I always wonder with people like,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m constantly surrounded by,</p>
<p>one of the biggest problems in my life has been,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people in my life who love me very much,</p>
<p>but who want me to the equivalent of that situation.</p>
<p>You know, definitely don&rsquo;t go to the Olympics</p>
<p>and definitely like,</p>
<p>it seems like the world is full of people</p>
<p>that want you to be average and happy, which is great,</p>
<p>which is fine.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps that&rsquo;s the way it should be.</p>
<p>Like, you know, my parents, people close to you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what love, how love manifests itself often in people.</p>
<p>But then like, I think the ultimate manifestation of love</p>
<p>is understanding who this person is.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a madman who&rsquo;s driven towards a particular thing.</p>
<p>And the best thing for you to do is not to say,</p>
<p>like rest is to say, work harder.</p>
<p>Like fuck your infection.</p>
<p>You should be training.</p>
<p>Have you ever met anybody as crazy as you</p>
<p>that can help you?</p>
<p>Most of us who get to this point get there</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all a little unstable.</p>
<p>Even my wife, Galita, right?</p>
<p>Like when she was getting ready for 2016,</p>
<p>or when she was getting ready for 2020,</p>
<p>because she moved to Boston to be a coach,</p>
<p>she had a neck problem, right?</p>
<p>And at some point in time, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really important?</p>
<p>Day to day life or judo?</p>
<p>And believe it or not, the doctor in Canada was like,</p>
<p>I am never under any circumstances</p>
<p>doing an MRI of your neck again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she told her.</p>
<p>She goes, if you have me do an MRI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing judo again.</p>
<p>So just know if you hurt your neck and it requires an MRI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done with judo forever.</p>
<p>So decide if you wanna do judo or not.</p>
<p>That was a conversation we actually had to have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cool thing for a doctor to say.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends how bad ass they sound when they say it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tough conversation.</p>
<p>Judo one, what&rsquo;s this with your wife?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that relationship like?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re both a little crazy.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>In a good sense, or from my perspective, in a good sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just, we understand that when you set a goal</p>
<p>to do something, you&rsquo;re not signing on for the good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re signing on for the bad.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people understand that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a Valentine&rsquo;s Day card from Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>You have to accept everything negative</p>
<p>that could possibly happen.</p>
<p>And until you do, you&rsquo;re never gonna make it.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll always sell yourself short.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never go far enough.</p>
<p>And if you sign up for the whole thing,</p>
<p>then the negative is just like, oh, great.</p>
<p>I expected that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re experiencing the negative,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also experiencing the negative.</p>
<p>And if you overcome it,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ll get knocked out for it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Maybe they won&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>Maybe they won&rsquo;t train through it.</p>
<p>Right, when I had my five herniated disc</p>
<p>and I was in a neck brace,</p>
<p>I was still in the gym at seven a.m.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Doing whatever it is I could do</p>
<p>because my job is to be at the gym.</p>
<p>David Goggins, I don&rsquo;t know if you know the guy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gone, he&rsquo;s damaged lots of parts of his body,</p>
<p>like you, trying to achieve things.</p>
<p>So, unlike you, his achievements are like,</p>
<p>your achievements come with the medal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just running in the darkness in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>by himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, it&rsquo;s the same probably as with you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to be introspective about it,</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s just battling his own inner demons</p>
<p>and working through those</p>
<p>and is breaking his body doing so.</p>
<p>Are you cognizant of the trade off of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re damaging your body</p>
<p>to get to these levels of achievements,</p>
<p>of this level of excellence, of this level of greatness?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that depends</p>
<p>on what you consider damage really</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really see that I have damaged my body.</p>
<p>If anything, I think I&rsquo;ve strengthened it.</p>
<p>My body can go through more than yours can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s is weaker?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the Thai boxers, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen their shins,</p>
<p>they gotta break it a few times.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just nature of the beast.</p>
<p>You just had to break a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>to find where the weak points are</p>
<p>and then made them stronger.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Or strengthen the areas around it</p>
<p>to strengthen it by the sheer relation to it.</p>
<p>But the problem is you may not be able to do judo</p>
<p>for until you&rsquo;re 70.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>I may not be able to do judo to the level I used to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but I can still do judo.</p>
<p>You can still do judo.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people struggle with,</p>
<p>they wanna keep doing it</p>
<p>like they used to be able to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to do judo like I used to,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re seeing here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that guy anymore.</p>
<p>I accept that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even try to be that guy anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a completely different player today than I am</p>
<p>when I was winning Olympic medals.</p>
<p>And so I guess when you&rsquo;re looking at my journey</p>
<p>and the trade off is I never sacrificed anything.</p>
<p>The people around me sacrificed for me.</p>
<p>And I never had a downturn after the Olympics</p>
<p>because I never identified as an Olympian.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of Olympians suffer from depression</p>
<p>afterwards.</p>
<p>Because they identify as it.</p>
<p>Now they don&rsquo;t have who they are.</p>
<p>Where was your personal moment of greatness?</p>
<p>Like, or do you not experience life that way?</p>
<p>Where you were truly proud to be yourself?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Every day I wake up.</p>
<p>You wake up and you&rsquo;re not proud of who you are,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve really gotta seek out some help.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, first of all, okay, I&rsquo;ll do that</p>
<p>because I definitely am not proud of who I am.</p>
<p>I just wonder if you didn&rsquo;t identify with the Olympics,</p>
<p>was there times, maybe in the training room,</p>
<p>maybe in Japan, where you just kinda felt like,</p>
<p>I get more of an emotional, I guess, trigger, right?</p>
<p>Where like, I feel proud of what I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve set to a task and I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>So almost any task.</p>
<p>And the more challenging the task, the more reward.</p>
<p>You fought a lot of amazing battles in 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>So you got, you beat the, let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>the world number four in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a replay.</p>
<p>Every single Olympics, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>all the people.</p>
<p>I got terrible draws.</p>
<p>Terrible draws.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re facing,</p>
<p>this is where I was like watching this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, he&rsquo;s screwed.</p>
<p>You faced the world number one, the Georgian, in the.</p>
<p>By the way, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he beat me five times to my beating him once,</p>
<p>and the one time I beat him was in London.</p>
<p>And all other times he beat me, he beat me biathlon.</p>
<p>And not by like a little throw,</p>
<p>like he threw me on my head.</p>
<p>At one point we were in Georgia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fighting him in the final.</p>
<p>I go to my teammate and I go, guess what?</p>
<p>Make sure you watch this fight.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s getting thrown free pwn.</p>
<p>This match ain&rsquo;t, this ain&rsquo;t match going to distance.</p>
<p>And about a minute in,</p>
<p>I tried to take his head off with a big Koshiguruma,</p>
<p>which is like a head and arm.</p>
<p>He caught me and then threw me on my head</p>
<p>and ended the match.</p>
<p>So first of all, we&rsquo;re watching the video of you,</p>
<p>again, standing next to the guy</p>
<p>leading up to your semifinal match.</p>
<p>So here, if you win this, you&rsquo;re guaranteed a medal.</p>
<p>But the chances of you winning, from my fan perspective,</p>
<p>I was like, God damn it.</p>
<p>You and the rest of the world, except for me.</p>
<p>Except for you.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to yourself here.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>My name is Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Olympic champion.</p>
<p>I will not be denied.</p>
<p>The George is probably like,</p>
<p>what the hell is this guy saying?</p>
<p>What is he talking to himself?</p>
<p>So he was probably ultra confident.</p>
<p>Yeah, had to be.</p>
<p>The difference is,</p>
<p>is I understood the last five times he beat me.</p>
<p>I was purposely trying to throw him, not beat him.</p>
<p>I wanted to find out if I could.</p>
<p>Turns out I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t need to throw him to beat him.</p>
<p>I need to know how to not lose.</p>
<p>But you were still going for stuff here.</p>
<p>But all of my attacks drag him to the ground.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never standing on my feet.</p>
<p>Which is a complete, which is a distinction</p>
<p>that we talked about at the very beginning, right?</p>
<p>You have throws where you&rsquo;re standing</p>
<p>and throws where you&rsquo;re dropping.</p>
<p>Every time I try to throw him standing,</p>
<p>he throws me free pony.</p>
<p>He picks me up and he throws me on my head, literally.</p>
<p>So what I did is I just needed to get to that last</p>
<p>one minute mark, which is what he does mentally</p>
<p>in his own Judo, where he changes into a panic</p>
<p>and just tries to do things that are uncharacteristic.</p>
<p>So you knew he&rsquo;s gonna start panicking here</p>
<p>as the match draws to a close</p>
<p>and you both have a Shido, a penalty.</p>
<p>Did we pass the point where I went for broke</p>
<p>and I broke my rule?</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>I went for a crazy foot sweep, like Ippon switch thing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even remember what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not used that often.</p>
<p>And he actually landed on top of me</p>
<p>and some people wanted it to be called Ippon.</p>
<p>But he had actually let go of the gi</p>
<p>and was looking for the mat.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t have any control.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t award him a point.</p>
<p>Yeah, and here we go.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re getting down into the,</p>
<p>see like he&rsquo;s getting frustrated.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I love it. Perfect.</p>
<p>Second penalty, no big deal.</p>
<p>We just got to get to the one minute mark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we got to do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no panic here for you.</p>
<p>Nope, I&rsquo;m right where I need to be and look it.</p>
<p>Now, if you go back into this match,</p>
<p>I would love for somebody to go back</p>
<p>and see how many times he did a drop right Ippon Seinagi.</p>
<p>Probably never.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why is he doing it now?</p>
<p>Cause he panics and he changes his Judo</p>
<p>at that one minute mark.</p>
<p>Look how much I kept that grip.</p>
<p>Yeah, you kept, you have that grip this whole time.</p>
<p>You have your left hand.</p>
<p>Walking him down.</p>
<p>He, you keep the grip as he&rsquo;s throwing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which, were you thinking choke as he drops or no?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of natural instinct.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we drilled it.</p>
<p>I spent two years drilling this transition.</p>
<p>And then very, so for people that don&rsquo;t do Judo, Jujitsu,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like really nice.</p>
<p>You keep, everything is nicely controlled</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re keeping that Gi under his chin.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really tight control.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very, like you&rsquo;re, I guess it&rsquo;s drilling,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re cognizant of the position of your wrist</p>
<p>the whole time.</p>
<p>And you can tell based on like just years of doing it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s under or it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You can just feel the difference.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably, even if you wanted to stop that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult because your whole time, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s under, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stop.</p>
<p>For people who practice Jujitsu, don&rsquo;t practice Judo,</p>
<p>one of the very annoying things about Judo</p>
<p>is in order to do Gi chokes,</p>
<p>they have to be under the chin.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Even though the kind of intense chokes you do</p>
<p>work just fine over the chin, but.</p>
<p>And the kicker here and why we practice this choke</p>
<p>was because when you go back and watch</p>
<p>all of the other matches, he always does this tripod</p>
<p>when I try to do arm locks,</p>
<p>which is typically what I would do.</p>
<p>And when I do that, he ends up sliding out</p>
<p>and I end up falling off.</p>
<p>So you step up here with the choke,</p>
<p>he does a tripod where he sticks his button to the air</p>
<p>and you, dude, what&rsquo;s the name of this choke?</p>
<p>Bone arrow.</p>
<p>No, but, okay, but I mean, when you do from like,</p>
<p>from that position, is there a way,</p>
<p>this entry into the bone arrow, I guess,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We refer to Judo as a British strangle,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in that turtle position</p>
<p>and you do that rolling motion.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>And here, when you go into that,</p>
<p>you can fall off of him, like you said,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going for an arm bar,</p>
<p>but here, literally, because you have it under the chin</p>
<p>really well, there&rsquo;s just a nice control.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve already planned on it being on his chin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve hooked the arm, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already starting to go straight.</p>
<p>Probably this choke in the early stages,</p>
<p>like a few frames before, feels like it,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re safe, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like the head will slip out or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s why my left knee is up by his shoulder,</p>
<p>to keep that pressure down so that he can&rsquo;t posture it up.</p>
<p>When did you know you have this?</p>
<p>Oh, it works right here.</p>
<p>I actually panicked right about here.</p>
<p>Was maybe his head could come out?</p>
<p>My hand, I tore the muscle in my palm</p>
<p>because I was pulling so hard that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>he may not tap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, is my hand just going to give out beforehand?</p>
<p>And there he is.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re right on this edge, right?</p>
<p>So like, if we roll a little bit outside</p>
<p>and I still don&rsquo;t have it, like that ref could stop it.</p>
<p>And then I felt him tapping and.</p>
<p>Oh, that, he&rsquo;s heartbroken.</p>
<p>I felt.</p>
<p>Surprised.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>The relief.</p>
<p>Olympic final.</p>
<p>And he knew, he knew he lost an Olympic medal right there</p>
<p>because he already knew</p>
<p>that the Japanese guy was going to be his bronze,</p>
<p>that he never beats.</p>
<p>See the, but also he probably in his head</p>
<p>was confident that he would be in the final.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And so like this, he almost is surprised.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to happen this way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the second time it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you became an Olympic medalist.</p>
<p>Man, that must be a great feeling.</p>
<p>That must be a great feeling right here.</p>
<p>Just like all the years of injuries, all of it.</p>
<p>As fans that watch this too, it&rsquo;s like, holy shit.</p>
<p>He actually did it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a packed stadium too.</p>
<p>Not one empty seat.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>So maybe what were you thinking here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just focus on the next match.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It took me maybe like a minute or so to like decompress</p>
<p>and then like get back to like my normal state</p>
<p>for the final.</p>
<p>So the final is against the,</p>
<p>the Russian here.</p>
<p>What can you say about your mindset?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Same thing.</p>
<p>Travel Stevens, Olympic champion.</p>
<p>I will not be denied because I had felt like in London</p>
<p>and throughout the years, I felt like I kept getting robbed.</p>
<p>So I made sure in my mantra to add that little bit</p>
<p>at the end to reassure myself that like,</p>
<p>they are not gonna control the outcome of today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna control the outcome.</p>
<p>What did you know about the Russian?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>And I honestly, I thought I had won the Olympics right now.</p>
<p>And I still do think that today.</p>
<p>Just like mentally when you think about it,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve won like, yeah, he threw me,</p>
<p>but it was like a one in a million chance</p>
<p>that that worked for him.</p>
<p>Like, come on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you feel lucky to be in the final.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you deserve to be champion.</p>
<p>Again, remember, I&rsquo;m anticipating the goal.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m past that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a confidence in the way you&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>and the way you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I have his sleeve.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not breaking it.</p>
<p>Like still walking him down, still going forward.</p>
<p>Like I knew exactly how I was gonna beat him.</p>
<p>And I developed a plan because when I was getting ready</p>
<p>for Rio, we brought in a lot of the top Japanese players</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t invited to the camp for the national team</p>
<p>to Boston.</p>
<p>So I had four people, three of them were</p>
<p>on the national team.</p>
<p>One of them had won the universities in Japan,</p>
<p>all at 81 kilos.</p>
<p>I only got thrown once during camp for a month.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Like I was ready.</p>
<p>I just, I fucking slipped.</p>
<p>Where does it happen?</p>
<p>Right when he threw me.</p>
<p>So if you let this play out really quick,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point right here where I&rsquo;m gonna come around</p>
<p>his back and I&rsquo;m kinda gonna just yoko sutemi,</p>
<p>which means like a lateral drop.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna bring him down to the floor,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t a throw right here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of like a takedown, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get him to the ground</p>
<p>cause I wanna burn him.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t do any waza.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna keep burning him.</p>
<p>And you can see that like I get really close here.</p>
<p>He just went a little too far to his side</p>
<p>during this exchange.</p>
<p>And like he&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ah, he.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very wiry for an 81 kg player.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much like muscle on him.</p>
<p>But he uses his length and his leverage very well.</p>
<p>And you can see like I&rsquo;m really burning the clock here.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m owning these exchanges</p>
<p>more than I&rsquo;m owning the tachi waza ones,</p>
<p>the ones in our feet.</p>
<p>So you weren&rsquo;t trying to necessarily like submit him here</p>
<p>or like really hard or like pin him.</p>
<p>You were trying to break him a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being overly physical.</p>
<p>And to a lot of the BJJ people who are watching this,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re like, oh, well I would have done this.</p>
<p>I would have done that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to think like if that referee</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s reffing the judo side of it</p>
<p>looks at it for a couple of seconds and is like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not really moving.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll stop it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, you understand judo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s called ne waza groundwork.</p>
<p>Like what you, cause you&rsquo;re really showing it to the ref.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have to show movement and progression.</p>
<p>That hurt the forehead.</p>
<p>Like see, I threw that hand in there kind of hard,</p>
<p>ripping it across his face just because.</p>
<p>I got to tell you there&rsquo;s a calm.</p>
<p>Well, no, he does look a little broken,</p>
<p>but the Russians have like this calmness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty good at.</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t forget they&rsquo;ve competed like this for long time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all he knows.</p>
<p>And this is where I lose it.</p>
<p>See how my knee hit the ground.</p>
<p>My knee wasn&rsquo;t supposed to touch the ground.</p>
<p>I was supposed to sit to my hip to bring him down.</p>
<p>Something happened where my knee touched</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t happen in the first one.</p>
<p>It just happened there.</p>
<p>So like that, we never should have been in that predicament.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things where</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at sports</p>
<p>for anybody who&rsquo;s trying to improve,</p>
<p>you have to, when you&rsquo;re trying to improve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really got to ignore the ends of the spectrums.</p>
<p>The oopsies and the they got lucky.</p>
<p>And you only focus on the middle.</p>
<p>Like the technique I was doing was perfectly sound.</p>
<p>It just happened that the one oopsie happened on the stage</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t have happened on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no amount of drilling</p>
<p>that will ever like prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sports.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sports, especially the Olympics,</p>
<p>especially Judo when it&rsquo;s like one.</p>
<p>You got one mistake.</p>
<p>Oopsie can just be your.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You know, it really requires</p>
<p>and you have to wrap your head around the idea of like,</p>
<p>if you want the ability to beat these people</p>
<p>and throw these people,</p>
<p>like you got to be willing to get thrown yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like this isn&rsquo;t boxing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no like, I&rsquo;m going to stand in a place</p>
<p>where he can&rsquo;t hit me and I can hit him.</p>
<p>Because we have the gi and because they can grab it,</p>
<p>they have just as much ability to throw you as you them.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;d you feel here?</p>
<p>How long was the duration of you feeling upset</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t get the gold versus.</p>
<p>Never felt it.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t beat me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s an important distinction</p>
<p>because when I&rsquo;m training and when I&rsquo;m competing,</p>
<p>like I understand that I take risks</p>
<p>and I accept those consequences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I take them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a consequence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not him being the better judo player</p>
<p>that dominated a match and I didn&rsquo;t have an answer</p>
<p>and then he threw me.</p>
<p>Then I would be a little upset.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re tired and somebody&rsquo;s coming at you</p>
<p>and like, you can&rsquo;t do anything about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a shitty feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t this.</p>
<p>Like I accept losing when it&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p>Well, that was a hell of a story, man.</p>
<p>So from 2008, 2012, just the sheer number of injuries,</p>
<p>the weight cuts, all of that, the wanting to quit,</p>
<p>the doubts, I&rsquo;m sure you did not get,</p>
<p>like the fans probably started disappearing</p>
<p>somewhere between the second and the third Olympics.</p>
<p>Like the support from.</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>Judo within the United States and just everybody, you know.</p>
<p>The USOC tried to cut all my funding in 2015 and said,</p>
<p>nah, you&rsquo;re too old.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So through all of that, to win the medal,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the Olympics is about.</p>
<p>Is there some, like when you look back,</p>
<p>does that seem like another person?</p>
<p>Is this like another lifetime ago?</p>
<p>Or like, that&rsquo;s a hell of an accomplishment.</p>
<p>How do you feel about the whole thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting kind of predicament</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like those cookie cutter answers</p>
<p>about how proud you are and how grateful you are,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not who you are.</p>
<p>So that skillset and that mentality that,</p>
<p>you know, it took to accomplish that, that&rsquo;s who you are.</p>
<p>And so this was just a stepping stone in who I am.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the past to me.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no shrine in my house</p>
<p>that has like an Olympic medal in it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even remember the last time I looked at it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like the, all the stories,</p>
<p>the skills along the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like you right now sitting here is the shrine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The who you become along the journey</p>
<p>is really what the prize is, right?</p>
<p>Like when you think about any of them,</p>
<p>most of the people that, you know,</p>
<p>go through that depression after the games,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because that is their shrine.</p>
<p>Like that is who they&rsquo;ve identified as.</p>
<p>That is who they&rsquo;ve told the world, the community,</p>
<p>their friends, their family, that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve identified.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve identified as the person who perseveres,</p>
<p>overcomes and accepts challenges.</p>
<p>So like I, all those things are just like, you know,</p>
<p>putting a suitcase off to the side</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m onto the next great chapter thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s both sad and cool that very few people</p>
<p>in the world get to experience what it&rsquo;s like to be you.</p>
<p>I mean, this level of having gone through that journey.</p>
<p>Everyone has the opportunity to.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done a few difficult things in my life,</p>
<p>but I gotta tell you, weight cuts and sauna.</p>
<p>And I would tell people right now who are listening,</p>
<p>like, don&rsquo;t go through that.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of wrestlers, a lot of young judo players,</p>
<p>a lot of young, like just combat sports people</p>
<p>where weight classes are a thing,</p>
<p>they almost take a sense of pride.</p>
<p>Like when I hear them talking about like,</p>
<p>oh, how much weight do you have to cut?</p>
<p>If you have to cut a pound more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve accomplished more, like you&rsquo;re tougher.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no trophies for that.</p>
<p>You, whatever the reason, had a job to do</p>
<p>and you got it done and that is truly inspiring,</p>
<p>no matter how hard.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a big deep lesson to learn from that.</p>
<p>Then you start getting to the specifics</p>
<p>of whether you should weight cut or not.</p>
<p>But if we don&rsquo;t, then most of the great things we have</p>
<p>in this world, we wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>The reason we have many of the great things</p>
<p>is because people did that weight cut.</p>
<p>The equivalent of the weight cut</p>
<p>for whatever the discipline, man.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between having to do it</p>
<p>because you have to and you get through it,</p>
<p>then setting yourself up to do that</p>
<p>because you think it&rsquo;s the cool thing</p>
<p>or the thing you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing</p>
<p>in order to be successful.</p>
<p>There are plenty of like two time Olympic medalist.</p>
<p>I probably could have been a two time Olympic medalist</p>
<p>had I not cut that much weight.</p>
<p>I probably would have multiple world medals</p>
<p>had I not cut that much weight</p>
<p>because my body wouldn&rsquo;t have been that broken.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the other side of it.</p>
<p>So just when you&rsquo;re looking at it,</p>
<p>like I just hear it in like young kids,</p>
<p>even some of my own, like when you hear them talk</p>
<p>about like where their weight&rsquo;s at,</p>
<p>they almost take a sense of pride</p>
<p>on how much they have to lose</p>
<p>because they hear stories like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s not the takeaway.</p>
<p>I did it because I had to.</p>
<p>I was put in a situation where like,</p>
<p>I may not have gone to this game</p>
<p>had I moved up to 90 kilos</p>
<p>because I wouldn&rsquo;t have had time to grow into the division.</p>
<p>And then you get the job done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s a very important difference.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also with sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people talk to me about.</p>
<p>There should not be any glorification of not sleeping.</p>
<p>There should not be a glorification of cutting weight.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s on the way to your,</p>
<p>whatever is that fire inside you</p>
<p>that you know needs to get done, like the job at hand,</p>
<p>if you need to sacrifice in some of those ways,</p>
<p>you get the job done.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the weight cut is an interesting one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I mean, you could speak to this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different sports</p>
<p>in which the weight is more important than others.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different levels to this game.</p>
<p>I think at the level you operated in,</p>
<p>that was probably essential.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s huge games changed completely</p>
<p>from 81 kg to 90 kg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge weight jump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, first of all, it&rsquo;s weight, but then the strategy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so much changes the height</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>The physical, like people don&rsquo;t understand it,</p>
<p>but the physical size of a 90 kilo judo player</p>
<p>versus the physical size of an 81 kilo judo player,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like putting a human in a human.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s enough space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like, you could stand next to your friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s 180 pounds and you could be 160</p>
<p>and you guys could look identical.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It is different when both the 90 kilo,</p>
<p>100 kilo and 81 kilo both have 6% body fat</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cutting into the class.</p>
<p>And it always feels like there&rsquo;s more variety at 90 kilo</p>
<p>because some of them are lanky and tall.</p>
<p>Yeah, some are short and stocky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 81 is more uniform, which I,</p>
<p>but then the flip side of that is the,</p>
<p>this is what I like in jiu jitsu, again,</p>
<p>amateur competing against bigger guys.</p>
<p>Like I love that more.</p>
<p>I like cutting weight just so I&rsquo;m slim.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s when I feel the best</p>
<p>with the same thing that you mentioned.</p>
<p>But like, I love going against 200, 220 that.</p>
<p>Because in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>the weight doesn&rsquo;t get amplified in the sport.</p>
<p>Like the weight is just the weight, right?</p>
<p>If you can leg press 220 and you can bench 220,</p>
<p>then yeah, you can train with a guy who&rsquo;s 220.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p>And I mean, there is a truth that,</p>
<p>lightweights and middleweights in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and the same is true for judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a lot more of them.</p>
<p>That means if you wanna be,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just competing at a higher level.</p>
<p>So like, there&rsquo;s much more variety of games.</p>
<p>The level is much higher.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking on a bigger challenge,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re like, have a weight advantage.</p>
<p>So those are all decisions you have to kind of make.</p>
<p>And certainly in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>people that are weight cutting are silly.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the natural beginner thing to do</p>
<p>is to feel the way the nervousness</p>
<p>about competition expresses itself</p>
<p>is through the desire to be as light as possible,</p>
<p>which is the totally wrong desire to have.</p>
<p>Right, like when you look at me now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably like 230, right?</p>
<p>But I probably have the strength</p>
<p>of a 70 kilo judo player, right?</p>
<p>The weight doesn&rsquo;t really do much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you have the same thing with wrestling.</p>
<p>The skinny guys, the skinny you</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking at there,</p>
<p>just the amount of power in that person is fascinating.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t look like,</p>
<p>you have some muscle, but it doesn&rsquo;t look,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve felt the power of some of those people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way I can describe it is like scary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh shit, again, it&rsquo;s the food chain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the natural feeling</p>
<p>when you go with some judo people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense about this recent Olympics?</p>
<p>What stands out to you as,</p>
<p>so like Teddy Rene who was on a big run for a long time,</p>
<p>many consider him to be one of the greatest judo players</p>
<p>of all time, two time Olympic gold medalist</p>
<p>and two time Olympic bronze medalist of four Olympics.</p>
<p>Not counting like team stuff,</p>
<p>just doing individual and then like 10 time world champ.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure how they&rsquo;re gonna catalog</p>
<p>that team event.</p>
<p>Like are they all technically Olympic champions</p>
<p>or is France an Olympic champion?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re all technically Olympic champions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna ignore that.</p>
<p>Is that how they&rsquo;re gonna classify it now?</p>
<p>According, oh, sorry, according to Wikipedia,</p>
<p>like according to the internet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, according to IGF or whatever.</p>
<p>Because some of those players never won a match.</p>
<p>They just filled a spot.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s even a starker example.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>You know, they lost in the individual</p>
<p>and then they also lost in the team.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because in the case of Teddy,</p>
<p>he was important to the win against Japan in this Olympics.</p>
<p>So like in the team event.</p>
<p>So like, I feel like you should put that in the equation</p>
<p>to say who won gold, right?</p>
<p>It does feel like he won gold in the team</p>
<p>because he carried the team.</p>
<p>Well, you have like Nomura at 60 kilos from Japan,</p>
<p>three time Olympic gold medalist, no team event.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you gonna weigh Teddy&rsquo;s team event?</p>
<p>No, no, we&rsquo;re not arguing this, of course.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just wondering how like the IGF,</p>
<p>like when you look at a player stat,</p>
<p>is it gonna be like team gold medal for the Olympics</p>
<p>versus like their own personal gold medal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in sports, we have to be brutally honest.</p>
<p>And I think, hopefully this doesn&rsquo;t piss off people.</p>
<p>I hope it does.</p>
<p>But judo is an individual sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly just that one athlete,</p>
<p>maybe the athlete and coach, right?</p>
<p>If you look at the big, big picture,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no team in judo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of combat sports.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the honesty of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the brutality of losing to another human being</p>
<p>in a combat sport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so damn embarrassing when you get slammed</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no team</p>
<p>to like carry some of that responsibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all on you and you suck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you lost.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that weight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like magical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like soccer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like basketball.</p>
<p>Yeah, I couldn&rsquo;t play team sports</p>
<p>because if one of my teammates</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t doing their job correctly,</p>
<p>I would go play their position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it better than you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that, you know,</p>
<p>some of the greatest leaders of teams also do that.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan is like that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like with your actions,</p>
<p>you raised the level for everybody.</p>
<p>Like excellence is expected</p>
<p>and therefore everybody needs to step up.</p>
<p>So some of the greatest, I would say,</p>
<p>team leaders are individualists at heart.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So Teddy, I think 10 time world champion,</p>
<p>non team, regular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big number,</p>
<p>but I think he has some like open weight categories in there.</p>
<p>Open weight, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, you can count those, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same division twice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>One day after another.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I wanna count that, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t usually put heavyweights in judo</p>
<p>as like the greatest of all time,</p>
<p>because the level of competition is lower.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But anyway, he did lose in this match</p>
<p>to a young Russian, Tamerlan Bashev.</p>
<p>Match also not on the internet.</p>
<p>Thank you Olympics.</p>
<p>I am definitely going to go on some rants on the internet.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>As a fan of Olympics,</p>
<p>I feel like this definitely needs to change moving forward.</p>
<p>Like every single major Olympic event,</p>
<p>I also like random sports like weightlifting,</p>
<p>even though I don&rsquo;t do Olympic weightlifting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun just to watch.</p>
<p>Fun to watch such high level of excellence.</p>
<p>And the fact that we can&rsquo;t just fricking watch the full,</p>
<p>like each nicely categorized event is really heartbreaking</p>
<p>in judo, in Olympic weightlifting,</p>
<p>in track and gymnastics, all of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, so Teddy lost.</p>
<p>I mean, does that stand out to you?</p>
<p>If you were to like recap the things</p>
<p>that you remember from this Olympics.</p>
<p>I picked him losing already.</p>
<p>Like in my predictions.</p>
<p>Lose which, where?</p>
<p>That match or just in general somewhere?</p>
<p>In the final.</p>
<p>In the final, you thought.</p>
<p>Yeah, final or was it semi?</p>
<p>When I looked at his draw</p>
<p>because he decided not to compete throughout the quad</p>
<p>and do like the bare minimum to go,</p>
<p>because of his age,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think he would have enough energy</p>
<p>to battle his way through the draw that he had.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He felt earlier than I thought,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not the young athletic person he used to be.</p>
<p>And when they changed the rules to judo,</p>
<p>they allowed people to take people</p>
<p>into really, really deep waters,</p>
<p>which you saw at this Olympics,</p>
<p>which did it ruin the sport or did it not?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but it was definitely difficult to watch.</p>
<p>Would you put him at the greatest of all time</p>
<p>or asked another way,</p>
<p>like who do you think is the greatest judo player</p>
<p>of all time?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely not the greatest judo player,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s definitely the best competitor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference in judo player and competitor?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ability to like do the act of judo</p>
<p>of like throwing, pinning, arm locking</p>
<p>versus can you win a judo match?</p>
<p>Right, like when you look at somebody like Nomura</p>
<p>who like threw everyone he fought,</p>
<p>threw three Olympics, multiple world championships,</p>
<p>multiple things, like that&rsquo;s a pure judo player.</p>
<p>In the essence of judo,</p>
<p>he can throw, pin or arm lock</p>
<p>just about anybody he steps on the mat with during his time.</p>
<p>Teddy tended to, when you look at his judo,</p>
<p>because of his size,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s just because he&rsquo;s in the heavyweight category,</p>
<p>he was so much bigger, so much stronger,</p>
<p>people just couldn&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>And you would see really good judo players just break.</p>
<p>Like they could hang in there for a little bit,</p>
<p>but eventually his size, like you can&rsquo;t control that weight.</p>
<p>Weight moves weight.</p>
<p>And when you have to use all your strength</p>
<p>to keep him upright and off of you,</p>
<p>your muscles just give out</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have somebody of that stature</p>
<p>and that skill to train with, to train those muscles.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking more like those 73, 81, 90 kg people</p>
<p>that just stand in the pocket and just give everything.</p>
<p>Like what comes to my mind is like a Koga.</p>
<p>Koga.</p>
<p>You know, a Nomura who&rsquo;s a 60 kilo guy,</p>
<p>but again, like his dynamics</p>
<p>and how long he was dominant for, like it just.</p>
<p>Do you put value to like epic throws,</p>
<p>like singular moments of greatness?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s against a noteworthy player</p>
<p>in a noteworthy position.</p>
<p>There are a lot of highlights of people</p>
<p>that are good judo players,</p>
<p>but their highlights are of, you know,</p>
<p>scrubs on the IJF circuit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, great, the Japanese guy threw the guy</p>
<p>from, you know, Senegal free poem.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>We kind of expected that.</p>
<p>You took the world number one</p>
<p>against the 330th person in the world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you think was gonna happen?</p>
<p>Like when I see those highlights like thrown around</p>
<p>like social media, I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not a highlight.</p>
<p>They might as well have just been at the dojo</p>
<p>like practice and throws.</p>
<p>If you look at the like top 10 list for judo,</p>
<p>Kano always comes up, you know, as.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not somebody that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>his results are there,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really know how he got there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me to like, I can&rsquo;t see his judo.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Kano, by the way, is the founder of judo</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>who are considered to be the founder of judo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The sport evolves.</p>
<p>The players that are like,</p>
<p>if you took champions from the past</p>
<p>and you fought them against the players of today,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>And that goes with anything, right?</p>
<p>So every time you think of like,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the best of all time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably somebody within a generation</p>
<p>or two of today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m gonna pick my top three, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>top three, and I would go generationally speaking,</p>
<p>I would pick Ono for today,</p>
<p>probably Iliadis for like my timeframe,</p>
<p>like the, from a developmental standpoint.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d probably go Koga.</p>
<p>And then before Koga, I&rsquo;d probably go Nomura.</p>
<p>As like the person of that generation</p>
<p>that people like,</p>
<p>as a whole in judo respected.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, in the case of,</p>
<p>I wonder if people feared Koga.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re, that little guy&rsquo;s gonna get under you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna go for a ride.</p>
<p>You know, he was 78 kilos</p>
<p>when he took second at the All Japan&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is an open weight class.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like he,</p>
<p>he could throw down with anybody any weight class.</p>
<p>He still went.</p>
<p>He was one of the early people</p>
<p>that planted the seed of judo,</p>
<p>love of judo in you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when I looked at him,</p>
<p>like that was how like I wanted my judo to be portrayed.</p>
<p>That style.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then Iliadis, Iliadis, you just like,</p>
<p>I mean, you have a similar attitude as him.</p>
<p>So you just like the way he carries it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we get along.</p>
<p>You guys hang out.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d love to see that conversation.</p>
<p>I remember when we were talking about like his coaching,</p>
<p>I was like, why didn&rsquo;t you take this team?</p>
<p>Or like, why&rsquo;d you pick this team?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t work with those people.</p>
<p>Like those people are weak for children.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t know how to train hard.</p>
<p>I love that guy.</p>
<p>What about Ono?</p>
<p>Cause he was competing in this Olympics.</p>
<p>He got gold in this Olympics, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He lost in the team tournament though.</p>
<p>I think he just didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He just really wanted to throw that guy.</p>
<p>He like throws everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, he represents the thing you&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>
<p>I signed up to the judo fanatics, best of Ono.</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out to you about him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s especially you find beautiful,</p>
<p>like, or powerful about his technique?</p>
<p>His adaptability to the situations</p>
<p>and understanding of like what needs to happen</p>
<p>in order to throw these people.</p>
<p>I specifically watched a match with his</p>
<p>and I was going to do a breakdown video on it because.</p>
<p>Is there a match, do you remember what it is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s him versus Garvey of Hungary.</p>
<p>Is he good at gripping?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re watching the match against Hungary.</p>
<p>So at the one minute, so right here, coming up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s freakishly strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had the ability to train with him.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Obviously he looks super skinny.</p>
<p>But when you see him without his gi jacket on,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s a jacked dude,</p>
<p>which is uncharacteristic of a Japanese player</p>
<p>from back in the day, in a way changed all that.</p>
<p>He was like, we&rsquo;re going to get physical</p>
<p>to compete with the Europeans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another one of the greats, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t get mentioned enough.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a righty here, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And this is where he started setting it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can see he was standing</p>
<p>in like a left handed stance and then he changes.</p>
<p>So he grips almost like a double sleeve,</p>
<p>not a double sleeve.</p>
<p>He holds the tricep.</p>
<p>The tricep.</p>
<p>And the front sleeve standing like a lefty.</p>
<p>And no body grip.</p>
<p>Just tricep and sleeve.</p>
<p>And that was like the biggest whip</p>
<p>and twist of a nutrimata I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t actually lift him off the floor.</p>
<p>And if you look at it in like slow motion almost,</p>
<p>yeah, let&rsquo;s, yeah, there we go.</p>
<p>The Hungarian player was like 100% defense</p>
<p>and he still did this, right?</p>
<p>So right here, like press pause.</p>
<p>This is like an identifier if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to like learn judo and figure out how to set it up.</p>
<p>Because knowing how to get to the point right before</p>
<p>you pull the trigger is probably the most important.</p>
<p>So when we watch this play out,</p>
<p>what Ono&rsquo;s gonna do is he&rsquo;s gonna pivot</p>
<p>off his right leg right here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna back step with his left</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna pull Ungarvi&rsquo;s front leg</p>
<p>all the way forward into what we would call</p>
<p>like a neutral square stance.</p>
<p>So he plants hard.</p>
<p>And look at Ono.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s an interesting pull with the,</p>
<p>oh no, it&rsquo;s not a tricep.</p>
<p>He almost like, it starts with the tricep</p>
<p>and he like collects the gear or something like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still above the elbow</p>
<p>because you can see the bend, right?</p>
<p>And right here, see how he never put,</p>
<p>back it up a little bit.</p>
<p>This is kind of like one of those things,</p>
<p>yeah, pause it right there.</p>
<p>So when he puts his right foot down,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pulling so hard with his back</p>
<p>that when Ono goes to put his left foot down,</p>
<p>it never touches the mat.</p>
<p>But by putting his left foot back,</p>
<p>it actually pulls Ungarvi&rsquo;s foot forward.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s able to speed up his throw</p>
<p>by just continuing that motion back,</p>
<p>which what was supposed to have been a step</p>
<p>turned out to just, in the middle of the action,</p>
<p>he makes a split second decision</p>
<p>before putting the foot down to just continue.</p>
<p>Cause he recognizes that feel in his hands.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, it never, it&rsquo;s a swing.</p>
<p>Like he never touches the ground with his left foot.</p>
<p>It never started as like a big swing to a back step.</p>
<p>He changed his mind partway through.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s right there, he wants to take a step.</p>
<p>And then he goes, nope, he&rsquo;s bringing that foot forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to go for it.</p>
<p>Wait, is he full?</p>
<p>Full air.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Boom, boom.</p>
<p>And look at, if you go a few more steps forward right there,</p>
<p>his hip is the same height as Ungarvi shoulder.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s leaning so far into the throw</p>
<p>with his body weight.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s allowing that tricep grip to rotate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to draw Ungarvi forward.</p>
<p>And now when you pause it right here,</p>
<p>you think about the sheer physics</p>
<p>to like get your body into this position.</p>
<p>Jimmy and I were so like,</p>
<p>when we saw this for the first time,</p>
<p>we tried to just stand like that and we couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>His left foot is pointing straight ahead.</p>
<p>His chest is perpendicular to that foot</p>
<p>or parallel with it, right?</p>
<p>And his head is by his foot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that only possible in the midst of a throw?</p>
<p>Do you think he works on making like?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s done this particular throw,</p>
<p>not this style of it, but Uchi Mata so much</p>
<p>that his body has adapted to be able to do this.</p>
<p>So when people are trying to learn</p>
<p>and like break down videos,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t understand like the power he has</p>
<p>and what we call end range motion.</p>
<p>Yeah, look at that.</p>
<p>So like look at the full range of motion he takes, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>His left foot swings all the way around</p>
<p>and the torso starts like at three oclock</p>
<p>and it goes all the way around</p>
<p>like almost back to the three oclock.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, like what?</p>
<p>And he never lifts his leg above his hip.</p>
<p>And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, look at that.</p>
<p>Stayed on his feet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he doing?</p>
<p>Is that a matter of pride or just?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just habit.</p>
<p>The way the forces work, like he can just stay up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful throws I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much wrong with it, but it worked.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>Because when you think about,</p>
<p>remember what we talked about the very beginning,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s got to get his center of gravity under his.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one of the top players in the world</p>
<p>throwing another top player in the world</p>
<p>with his hip at that guy&rsquo;s shoulder height</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still working, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like he switched a lot of those details</p>
<p>of the throw in the middle.</p>
<p>In the middle.</p>
<p>And that only is, that means he&rsquo;s probably what,</p>
<p>like a hundred thousand times that throw has happened.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I saw you were into chess recently.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like me, a bit of a beginner in chess.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part of launching the website Effective Chess.</p>
<p>So I got to ask, maybe it&rsquo;s a personal question,</p>
<p>but do you have advice to yourself</p>
<p>and to other beginners in exploring chess</p>
<p>of how to one, have fun and two, to start getting good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see like Olympic caliber athlete</p>
<p>take on a difficult task with a beginner&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s that process like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of just learning new things in general.</p>
<p>Right, like when I left Judo,</p>
<p>like I took a job as marketing for Fuji Sports</p>
<p>and I was getting frustrated with designers.</p>
<p>So I learned Photoshop.</p>
<p>I also got angry with the photographer.</p>
<p>So now I take all the photos too,</p>
<p>just because I don&rsquo;t mind learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent my entire Judo career learning all the time,</p>
<p>like adding new techniques,</p>
<p>finding new ways, practicing, developing.</p>
<p>And so when it comes to chess,</p>
<p>I treat it just like I do anything else.</p>
<p>I just stick to one plan</p>
<p>and I learn all the ins and outs of that one plan.</p>
<p>And then I develop another plan, right?</p>
<p>Like I might practice like a London opening, for example,</p>
<p>and just, I don&rsquo;t even care if I win or lose.</p>
<p>I just wanna figure out how I&rsquo;m gonna lose</p>
<p>and then figure out how I&rsquo;m gonna win.</p>
<p>And once I know that position is now done,</p>
<p>then I start with another position.</p>
<p>And then once I figured out how I&rsquo;m gonna lose</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;m gonna win,</p>
<p>the next thing I do is I don&rsquo;t go to a third.</p>
<p>I figure out the bridge between the two.</p>
<p>Like at what point during my openings</p>
<p>can I transition back into this opening?</p>
<p>Right, so like you have like some basic openings</p>
<p>and you wanna see how they go wrong,</p>
<p>how they go right, all the different ways.</p>
<p>And then that starts to solidify a higher level concept</p>
<p>of that particular opening</p>
<p>and you start to stitch together the concepts.</p>
<p>The concepts together,</p>
<p>cause being able to go from one to another</p>
<p>and then back and forth is part of the reasons</p>
<p>why like I was successful at judo</p>
<p>is just because everything I do,</p>
<p>at some point it touches that spider web</p>
<p>of like being able to get from one area to another.</p>
<p>We refer to it as like a toolbox, right?</p>
<p>You need more tools in your toolbox.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re always grabbing the wrong tool</p>
<p>for that job, then you&rsquo;re just not gonna have success.</p>
<p>I actually forgot to ask,</p>
<p>you mentioned a few greatest chess players of all time</p>
<p>and I noticed you didn&rsquo;t mention Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about his judo.</p>
<p>Do you by chance know much about his judo?</p>
<p>What do you think about a president of a major nation</p>
<p>being a judo black belt?</p>
<p>And I think from what I&rsquo;ve seen, pretty good at it.</p>
<p>I think it shows, you know, if he actually got it,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s go with that premise of like he earned it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That just shows like a level of like physical persistence</p>
<p>and mental fortitude to be able to like,</p>
<p>you know, take those beatings</p>
<p>and just keep showing up until you&rsquo;ve overcome</p>
<p>and can now give those beatings.</p>
<p>As you know, in Japan and Russia, you get it by just like,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young, it&rsquo;s easier to get a black belt</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like, just go through a bunch of beatings</p>
<p>for like 10 years in your teenage years.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also from it springs like a camaraderie.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a definitely a brotherhood and sisterhood</p>
<p>in terms of judo to where you&rsquo;re connected forever</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>For many people, it&rsquo;s their childhood connection.</p>
<p>You sort of leave judo, you know,</p>
<p>in your twenties and your thirties, but that&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>And the same is true with wrestling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to see him pay respect to that,</p>
<p>like by going with the Russian national judo team.</p>
<p>And I think he did, obviously they have to get thrown,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But just, you can tell,</p>
<p>and you probably could tell even better,</p>
<p>but you can tell when a person moves in a way</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, okay, you&rsquo;ve had like 10 years</p>
<p>of beatings and you can tell the way they pull,</p>
<p>the way they move.</p>
<p>But I also like, in contrast to the US national team,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t even think there&rsquo;s a national team for US, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Pedro Judo center, right?</p>
<p>That there is some, it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a camaraderie like that</p>
<p>amongst the highest level Olympic caliber athletes in Russia.</p>
<p>I suppose Japan might have similar kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then you can have the system of people together</p>
<p>and then you can have a strong coaching staff,</p>
<p>not just like a coach, but a coaching staff.</p>
<p>And then you can have the nation backing that staff.</p>
<p>I mean, and then the result is like,</p>
<p>you have some incredible level of judo emerge.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk much about Jimmy.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a critical part of your just,</p>
<p>like of your perseverance through all the,</p>
<p>all that you had to go through.</p>
<p>What did you learn from Jimmy?</p>
<p>What are some impacts that he had on your life,</p>
<p>both on the mat and off the mat?</p>
<p>If we had to like put it down to like a very simple thing,</p>
<p>he taught me how to win, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily like the technical side of judo.</p>
<p>Like we went over gripping, we went over this,</p>
<p>we adapted that.</p>
<p>But the real strength to Jimmy was like,</p>
<p>he knows how to win.</p>
<p>And most people think,</p>
<p>well, if I get really good at this technique,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to throw people with it, not win.</p>
<p>That is not how the world of sports works, right?</p>
<p>Like I remember in one of my YouTube videos,</p>
<p>I was doing a breakdown of a match from the Cuba Grand Prix</p>
<p>where I was fighting a Mongolian guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kicking the shit at me, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie.</p>
<p>Four minutes in, like he just throwing me like left</p>
<p>and right, he was so fast.</p>
<p>I felt like I just couldn&rsquo;t get to him.</p>
<p>In the last 30 seconds, he changed.</p>
<p>He started protecting his lead instead of continuing</p>
<p>the fight the way the entire match was going in his favor.</p>
<p>He made a mental shift and when he made that mental shift,</p>
<p>I beat him.</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t know how to win the fight.</p>
<p>He can win exchanges, but he can&rsquo;t win the fight.</p>
<p>So the last thing you wanna do is have to win</p>
<p>every exchange in a match.</p>
<p>You wanna know how to kick it into sixth gear.</p>
<p>Like when to step off the gas,</p>
<p>when to focus on gripping,</p>
<p>when to attack, how often to attack,</p>
<p>all those things like.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve had those conversations with Jimmy like,</p>
<p>this is not like how to stop trying to win every exchange,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And instead.</p>
<p>Because I was a brawler before.</p>
<p>I was like, if I threw you once, I&rsquo;m throwing you again.</p>
<p>And sometimes you get caught.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already winning.</p>
<p>What about like the mental side of the game,</p>
<p>the preparation, all those things?</p>
<p>One of the biggest things Jimmy brought to the forefront</p>
<p>when it came to like the mental side</p>
<p>was the visualization, right?</p>
<p>And when I started visualizing myself winning,</p>
<p>I started seeing more success.</p>
<p>But once I started seeing more success,</p>
<p>with the visualization also came self doubt.</p>
<p>Because as I&rsquo;m starting to picture myself like,</p>
<p>I would picture myself before fighting Church&rsquo;s village,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna throw him with Koshiguruma and I can see it.</p>
<p>And if I stand in the shoot for too long,</p>
<p>you start to like, but what if he counters?</p>
<p>Then you go, well, if he counters with this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna counter with that.</p>
<p>But you already let that doubt in.</p>
<p>And then you start playing this like five step scenario,</p>
<p>but you still come out on top.</p>
<p>But all that doubt has like seeped into your mind, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still winning in your mind,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also doubting yourself in your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, once you let that doubt seep in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s destructive.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so I remember I was at the World Championships.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what year it was, but I was ready.</p>
<p>Like I was healthy, I was ready to go.</p>
<p>And we all thought like,</p>
<p>this is the year Travis wins the Worlds.</p>
<p>I go out there in the first round,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the shoot for like 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Like the match went into golden score,</p>
<p>then the next match went into golden score,</p>
<p>then the fucking next match went into golden score.</p>
<p>Then the referee came and told me,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t wear your gi.</p>
<p>Then Big Jim goes, why can&rsquo;t he wear his gi?</p>
<p>Any gi that has his name on it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna let him wear.</p>
<p>He has to wear a different gi.</p>
<p>So then I go, fuck you, I&rsquo;m leaving.</p>
<p>And I walked out there and I fought.</p>
<p>I lost in golden score because I did a kochi</p>
<p>and they called it a false attack.</p>
<p>And I went, great, I&rsquo;m out of the fucking Worlds.</p>
<p>But when I was in the shoot,</p>
<p>I struggled because I started allowing the like</p>
<p>Hungarian guy that I was gonna face to do things to me</p>
<p>that I would have to play defense to and then counter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, great, but now I&rsquo;m doubting my own ability.</p>
<p>So I went to a sports psychologist</p>
<p>and the big game changer for me was,</p>
<p>I focused more on the emotional, physical response</p>
<p>that happens in matches rather than the actual quote unquote</p>
<p>like Instagram picture that would have happened.</p>
<p>So when I was getting ready for 2016,</p>
<p>you think about like,</p>
<p>how do you feel like standing in the shoot?</p>
<p>Like, what does your body feel like?</p>
<p>Is your heart racing?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your breath?</p>
<p>Is your mouth dry?</p>
<p>And then you think about like, okay,</p>
<p>the ref just started the match.</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>Like, how, what&rsquo;s the atmosphere like?</p>
<p>How do you emotionally respond to these things?</p>
<p>More so than me trying to beat a specific judo player,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, the ref just gave you a penalty at a minute 30.</p>
<p>Like, how do you feel?</p>
<p>And then you start thinking about the physical responses.</p>
<p>And when you do that really well,</p>
<p>you can actually get the pins and needles</p>
<p>and your body will start to sweat</p>
<p>and your heart will start to race as if you&rsquo;re in it.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not about the technique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the physical.</p>
<p>Like, what does it feel like to have your fingers ripped</p>
<p>out of a gi in the first exchange?</p>
<p>Now my hands can feel that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And then on a cellular level,</p>
<p>like I fought the Olympic games so many times</p>
<p>to the point where like, it is no longer a goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an anticipation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So down to the experience of the grip break,</p>
<p>that just the sweat, the, the heart beating, the, yeah.</p>
<p>What does it feel to have your head smashed into a mat</p>
<p>and driven across the mat with a mat burn?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then getting back up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And getting back up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like with a bit of a burn, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The actual sensation on the skin.</p>
<p>The actual sensation of what it takes to fight a judo match.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a strategy, like,</p>
<p>but the actual sensations, the full experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Cause then your body&rsquo;s going to fight hundreds of matches</p>
<p>without the physical damage.</p>
<p>And you could probably get really far with that.</p>
<p>And not also in just judo, but basically anything.</p>
<p>You can simulate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you learn how to simulate well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived a very, a hell of a life.</p>
<p>Is there a device you can give to young people?</p>
<p>Sort of a high school, college,</p>
<p>thinking about their career, thinking about life,</p>
<p>how to live one they&rsquo;re proud of?</p>
<p>I think the number one thing I can tell people is,</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;ve lived my life is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really got to like,</p>
<p>forget everybody in your life right now.</p>
<p>Your mother, your father, your grandparents,</p>
<p>your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whoever it is,</p>
<p>and really decide like, what is going to make you happy?</p>
<p>At some point in my career,</p>
<p>the act of pushing my body to the limit</p>
<p>made me happier than winning a grand slam medal.</p>
<p>Pushing my body to the limit</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make me happier than winning an Olympic medal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balance there.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people struggle with living their life</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re happy and they make other people happy</p>
<p>or take in their feelings into the considerations</p>
<p>of what they need to do in their life.</p>
<p>And I think if they can cut those strings sooner,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll allow you to get over it quicker</p>
<p>and get to a happier place sooner.</p>
<p>And then as long as you&rsquo;re focusing</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s making you happy,</p>
<p>the things you do that make you happy</p>
<p>will attract other people who do those things</p>
<p>that will in turn build stronger, better relationships.</p>
<p>And then you will also realize the best form of yourself</p>
<p>and inspire many others.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve inspired me to, for whatever the hell I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>at least to do a slightly better job</p>
<p>than I otherwise would have by doing martial arts,</p>
<p>by taking that journey,</p>
<p>and I think becoming a better person because of it.</p>
<p>So Travis, I have been, I continue to be</p>
<p>one of your biggest fans.</p>
<p>I love your whole career in the way you pursued happiness.</p>
<p>I love what you and Jimmy have done.</p>
<p>I love the sport of judo as represented by you.</p>
<p>So I deeply appreciate what you&rsquo;ve done, man.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m honored that you would spend your time with me today.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking, man.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>with Travis Stevens.</p>
