Hello and welcome back.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you join us.
I&amp;rsquo;m really excited for today and the news we have to share with you.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to think that this is our third major event

In the midst of enormous challenges this year,
our teams have remained focused,
and they haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped innovating.
We&amp;rsquo;re on an unbelievable pace of new product releases,'>

<p>[pop music playing]</p>
<p>Hello and welcome back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to have you join us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited for today and the news we have to share with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to think that this is our third major event</p>
<p>in just the past two months.</p>
<p>In the midst of enormous challenges this year,</p>
<p>our teams have remained focused,</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t stopped innovating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on an unbelievable pace of new product releases,</p>
<p>delivering more new products this fall than ever before,</p>
<p>starting with upgrades to our powerful operating systems</p>
<p>as well as our other remarkable products.</p>
<p>The incredibly capable and affordable Apple Watch SE</p>
<p>and Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>putting the future of health on your wrist.</p>
<p>An entirely new fitness experience with Apple Fitness+.</p>
<p>A convenient way to subscribe to Apple services with Apple One.</p>
<p>The new and more powerful eighth-generation iPad</p>
<p>and the stunning and versatile new iPad Air.</p>
<p>The amazingly capable and compact HomePod mini.</p>
<p>And we began a new era for iPhone with iPhone 12.</p>
<p>And for people who want the most out of their iPhone, iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited</p>
<p>iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will begin shipping this Friday.</p>
<p>But there is just one more thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to talk about the Mac.</p>
<p>We love the Mac. It&rsquo;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the tool that we use to build our phenomenal lineup of products.</p>
<p>Our users love it too.</p>
<p>Today the Mac is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>It continues to lead the industry in customer satisfaction</p>
<p>as it has for over a decade.</p>
<p>And more customers than ever are choosing the Mac.</p>
<p>In fact, the Mac business grew by nearly 30% last quarter,</p>
<p>and the Mac is having its best year ever.</p>
<p>And the Mac continues to attract new users.</p>
<p>Today, over 50% of buyers are new to the Mac,</p>
<p>which is simply amazing.</p>
<p>And all around the world,</p>
<p>people use the Mac to do remarkable things.</p>
<p>Like the Mac itself, they challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>They take chances. They create.</p>
<p>They innovate.</p>
<p>They use the Mac to help change the world,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d like to celebrate them.</p>
<p>[woman] There&rsquo;s a certain kind of person&hellip;</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t take no for an answer.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t walk in quietly.</p>
<p>They parade in.</p>
<p>Trailblazing.</p>
<p>Eyebrow-raising.</p>
<p>Status quo-breaking.</p>
<p>Grazing greatness,</p>
<p>braving hatred,</p>
<p>and taking up space.</p>
<p>Never got a seat at the table, so they can&rsquo;t sit and behave.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d rather defy the rules and amaze.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain kind of person who doesn&rsquo;t wait for greatness.</p>
<p>They make it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see how people use the Mac to do such amazing things.</p>
<p>The Mac has always been about innovation and bold change.</p>
<p>In June, we announced that the Mac is taking another huge leap forward</p>
<p>by transitioning to Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And we promised that the first Mac with Apple Silicon</p>
<p>would arrive by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Well, that day is here.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s John.</p>
<p>We love the Mac, and our teams have been working tirelessly</p>
<p>to deliver the best lineup of notebooks and desktops that we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Well, now it&rsquo;s time for the Mac to take a gigantic leap forward.</p>
<p>To do this, we needed to develop a new set of advanced technologies.</p>
<p>So for the past several years, we&rsquo;ve had our teams working</p>
<p>with the singular purpose of defining and building</p>
<p>the next generation of Mac.</p>
<p>And at the core of this effort is the silicon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been making Apple Silicon for more than a decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the heart of iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And now we want to bring it to the Mac.</p>
<p>So the Mac can take a huge leap forward with the incredible performance,</p>
<p>custom technologies and industry-leading power efficiency</p>
<p>of Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve said, we&rsquo;re developing a family of chips.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to transition the Mac line to these new chips</p>
<p>over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Well, today, we are incredibly excited</p>
<p>to announce our first step in this transition,</p>
<p>with our first chip designed specifically for the Mac.</p>
<p>And we call it&hellip; M1.</p>
<p>M1 has been optimized for our most popular, low-power systems</p>
<p>where small size and power efficiency are critically important.</p>
<p>It is a stunningly capable chip,</p>
<p>and it ushers in a whole new era for the Mac.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get started by spending a few minutes</p>
<p>on a deep dive into this new chip with Johny.</p>
<p>M1 is a breakthrough chip for the Mac.</p>
<p>Our approach with M1 was to deliver industry-leading performance and features,</p>
<p>while relentlessly focusing on power efficiency.</p>
<p>As a result, M1 delivers a giant leap in performance per watt,</p>
<p>and every Mac with M1 will be transformed</p>
<p>into a completely different class of product.</p>
<p>M1 is the first system on chip, or SoC, for the Mac.</p>
<p>Let me show you what that means.</p>
<p>Until now, a Mac needed multiple chips to deliver all of its features.</p>
<p>It had chips for the processor, I/O, security and memory.</p>
<p>Now with M1, these technologies are combined into a single SoC,</p>
<p>delivering a whole new level of integration for more simplicity,</p>
<p>efficiency and amazing performance.</p>
<p>M1 also features our unified memory architecture, or UMA.</p>
<p>M1 unifies its high-bandwidth, low-latency memory</p>
<p>into a single pool within a custom package.</p>
<p>As a result, all of the technologies in the SoC can access the same data</p>
<p>without copying it between multiple pools of memory.</p>
<p>This dramatically improves performance and power efficiency.</p>
<p>M1 is the first personal computer chip</p>
<p>built using the industry-leading 5-nanometer process technology.</p>
<p>With incredibly small transistors measured at an atomic scale,</p>
<p>M1 is remarkably complex.</p>
<p>It packs the largest number of transistors we&rsquo;ve ever put into a single chip.</p>
<p>M1 has a massive 16 billion transistors.</p>
<p>And we use all of these transistors</p>
<p>to give M1 amazing performance and leading-edge technologies.</p>
<p>And our goal is to make each of these technologies best in class.</p>
<p>The incredible performance of M1 starts with the CPU,</p>
<p>which features two types of cores: high-performance and high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Each performance core is designed to run a single task, or thread,</p>
<p>as efficiently as possible while maximizing performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been advancing it year after year.</p>
<p>And now with the huge improvements in M1, when it comes to low-power silicon,</p>
<p>our high-performance core is the world&rsquo;s fastest CPU core.</p>
<p>And M1 has four of these incredibly fast, high-performance cores.</p>
<p>So multi-threaded workloads take a huge leap in performance as well.</p>
<p>To handle lighter workloads more efficiently,</p>
<p>M1 brings high-efficiency cores to the Mac.</p>
<p>They use a tenth of the power,</p>
<p>while still delivering outstanding performance.</p>
<p>These E cores are the most efficient place to run lightweight tasks,</p>
<p>and allow the performance cores to be used for the most demanding workloads.</p>
<p>And M1 has four of these efficiency cores,</p>
<p>which on their own, deliver similar performance</p>
<p>as the current-generation, dual-core MacBook Air</p>
<p>at much lower power.</p>
<p>And finally, M1 has our latest performance controller</p>
<p>that determines in real time where code runs,</p>
<p>for maximum performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>Altogether, the 8-core CPU in M1 is by far</p>
<p>the highest-performance CPU we&rsquo;ve ever created.</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>it delivers this performance at the lowest possible power.</p>
<p>In fact, the M1 CPU leads the industry</p>
<p>by delivering the world&rsquo;s best CPU performance per watt.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>Here is the CPU performance and power usage</p>
<p>of the very latest PC laptop chip.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s M1.</p>
<p>M1 delivers significantly higher performance at every power level.</p>
<p>And at just 10 watts, the thermal envelope of a MacBook Air,</p>
<p>you can see that M1 delivers up to two times the CPU performance</p>
<p>of the PC chip.</p>
<p>And M1 can deliver the peak performance of the PC chip</p>
<p>while using just a quarter of the power.</p>
<p>This is a big deal.</p>
<p>What you are seeing here with M1 is extremely rare.</p>
<p>When you look back at the single-threaded performance</p>
<p>of low-power silicon in the Mac,</p>
<p>gains in performance per watt have been very small from one chip to the next.</p>
<p>But when we look at M1,</p>
<p>we see a massive three times improvement in performance per watt.</p>
<p>This is unheard of.</p>
<p>Now what about graphics?</p>
<p>We design GPUs that deliver the maximum graphics performance</p>
<p>in the thermal envelope of each of our products.</p>
<p>This results in a balanced system with a GPU that complements</p>
<p>the incredible performance of our CPU complex.</p>
<p>Typically, PCs can&rsquo;t achieve this balance with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>To get great graphics performance, they have to use a discrete chip</p>
<p>which consumes a lot of power.</p>
<p>M1 is different.</p>
<p>With its integrated graphics, we get the best of both worlds:</p>
<p>incredible performance and low power.</p>
<p>The GPU in M1 benefits from years of thorough analysis of Mac applications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most advanced graphics processor we&rsquo;ve ever created.</p>
<p>And with up to eight of these GPU cores,</p>
<p>M1 is capable of executing nearly 25,000 threads at a time.</p>
<p>From teraflops to texture bandwidth to fill rate,</p>
<p>along with its incredible efficiency,</p>
<p>M1&rsquo;s GPU is in a class of its own.</p>
<p>Here is the graphics performance and power usage</p>
<p>of that same PC laptop chip.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s M1.</p>
<p>M1 delivers significantly higher performance at every power level,</p>
<p>with M1 delivering up to two times more graphics performance than the PC chip.</p>
<p>And again, M1 can deliver the peak performance of the PC chip</p>
<p>while using just one-third of the power.</p>
<p>When it comes to personal computers,</p>
<p>M1 has the world&rsquo;s fastest integrated graphics.</p>
<p>Now, Apple Silicon is more than just a fast CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>We pack our chips with powerful custom technologies.</p>
<p>M1 features our most advanced Neural Engine.</p>
<p>With a 16-core design,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s capable of executing a massive 11 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>The entire M1 chip is designed to excel at machine learning,</p>
<p>and tasks like video analysis, voice recognition and image processing</p>
<p>will have a level of performance never seen before on the Mac.</p>
<p>Finally, M1 integrates our latest-generation Secure Enclave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s faster than ever and brings best-in-class security to the Mac.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s M1, our first SoC designed for the Mac.</p>
<p>With its 8-core CPU featuring the world&rsquo;s fastest CPU core,</p>
<p>along with an 8-core GPU that delivers the world&rsquo;s fastest integrated graphics,</p>
<p>M1 leads the industry in performance per watt.</p>
<p>And it has leading-edge technologies like the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>Thunderbolt and USB 4, a faster Secure Enclave,</p>
<p>our latest ISP and more.</p>
<p>With its unique combination of remarkable performance,</p>
<p>powerful features and incredible efficiency,</p>
<p>M1 is by far the best chip we&rsquo;ve ever created.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re absolutely thrilled to bring it to the Mac.</p>
<p>Now back to John.</p>
<p>It is so incredibly exciting to think about the Macs we can build</p>
<p>with the performance and capability of M1.</p>
<p>The Mac has never had a chip upgrade this profound.</p>
<p>But the silicon is only part of the story.</p>
<p>For all Apple products, it&rsquo;s the tight integration of our hardware and software</p>
<p>that makes the user experience so amazing.</p>
<p>To deepen this integration on the Mac,</p>
<p>we use Mac-specific software workloads to optimize the architecture of M1.</p>
<p>And in the same way iOS and iPadOS are built to maximize our A-series chips,</p>
<p>macOS Big Sur has been built to maximize M1.</p>
<p>To hear how it unlocks entirely new experiences and capabilities,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s turn it over to Craig.</p>
<p>For the first time ever,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to design macOS for our own silicon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited about what this means for the platform.</p>
<p>Our latest release, macOS Big Sur, is absolutely incredible on M1.</p>
<p>Big Sur introduces a bold new design,</p>
<p>powerful updates for apps like Safari and Messages,</p>
<p>and the latest improvements to our industry-leading privacy features.</p>
<p>And by designing the whole system together, hardware and software,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to make the things you love about your Mac even better.</p>
<p>Your Mac now instantly wakes from sleep, just like the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Let me show you. But first, let&rsquo;s set the mood.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Playing Your Game, Baby&rdquo; by Barry White playing]</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>And with M1, things you do every day,</p>
<p>like launching apps, are nearly instantaneous.</p>
<p>And Safari, which is already the world&rsquo;s fastest browser,</p>
<p>really shines on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now one and a half times speedier at running JavaScript,</p>
<p>and almost two times more responsive.</p>
<p>The whole system is distinctly snappy, and system animations are buttery smooth.</p>
<p>The sheer speed of M1,</p>
<p>together with macOS technologies like Metal,</p>
<p>deliver a huge boost to the most demanding apps.</p>
<p>So you can render 3D animations or edit RAW video footage with ease.</p>
<p>Now, part of the secret behind this breakthrough performance</p>
<p>is M1&rsquo;s unified memory architecture.</p>
<p>We built macOS on Apple Silicon to use the same data formats</p>
<p>for things like video decode, GPU and display,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no need for expensive copying or translation.</p>
<p>And macOS gives apps access to more graphics memory than ever,</p>
<p>unlocking breakthrough performance</p>
<p>for tasks ranging from color grading 6K video</p>
<p>to playing graphically-intensive games</p>
<p>or performing real-time machine learning inference.</p>
<p>Big Sur also features advanced power management,</p>
<p>which intelligently allocates tasks</p>
<p>between M1&rsquo;s performance and efficiency cores,</p>
<p>automatically optimizing for lightweight tasks, like reading a note,</p>
<p>or performance-intensive tasks, like playing a game.</p>
<p>So your Mac gives you quiet performance and even better battery life.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, M1 represents a major leap forward.</p>
<p>For years on iOS, we&rsquo;ve worked to continuously advance</p>
<p>the state of the art for computer security.</p>
<p>And with M1, we&rsquo;re bringing this architecture to the Mac.</p>
<p>This includes not only hardware-verified secure boot</p>
<p>and automatic high-performance encryption for all your files,</p>
<p>but also new security protections</p>
<p>built deep into the code execution architecture of M1,</p>
<p>giving you the most advanced security of any personal computer.</p>
<p>MacOS Big Sur is engineered, down to its core,</p>
<p>to fully take advantage of all the capability and power of M1.</p>
<p>And it does this all while maintaining everything you love about macOS.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ve optimized all of our apps for M1,</p>
<p>from every app that comes with macOS</p>
<p>to every other app made by Apple.</p>
<p>Apps like Pages, Numbers and Keynote,</p>
<p>and GarageBand and iMovie,</p>
<p>are showing us how great performance can be with M1.</p>
<p>For example, with Logic Pro,</p>
<p>you can run up to three times more instruments and effect plug-ins.</p>
<p>And Final Cut Pro can fly through tasks</p>
<p>like rendering a complex timeline up to six times faster.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait for you to unleash your creativity.</p>
<p>Now, macOS Big Sur has incredible technologies</p>
<p>that enable you to run a greater range of apps than ever before.</p>
<p>First are Universal apps.</p>
<p>Simply put, Universal apps are the fastest,</p>
<p>most powerful apps you can get.</p>
<p>Universal apps include a native binary version built for Apple Silicon</p>
<p>as well as a native version for Intel processors.</p>
<p>The two come together into a single app</p>
<p>that you can download from the App Store or from the web,</p>
<p>meaning that one app can run on all of your Macs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hearing a lot of excitement from developers</p>
<p>as they get ready to launch their Universal apps.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>Omni Group is bringing Universal versions of all of their great Mac apps.</p>
<p>And Adobe is bringing Universal versions of their apps,</p>
<p>starting with Lightroom next month,</p>
<p>and other flagship apps, including Photoshop, early next year.</p>
<p>For existing apps that haven&rsquo;t yet upgraded to Universal,</p>
<p>Big Sur includes an amazing new technology: Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>On M1 systems, Rosetta seamlessly runs apps built for Intel-based Macs.</p>
<p>So even without an app update,</p>
<p>you can keep working on that Fusion 360 project</p>
<p>and get to the next level in your favorite game.</p>
<p>Thanks to Metal and M1,</p>
<p>some of the most graphically-demanding apps</p>
<p>actually perform better under Rosetta</p>
<p>than they did running natively on previous Macs with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>The transition to M1 is also great for developers.</p>
<p>M1 scales up the architecture</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re already accustomed to on iPhone and iPad,</p>
<p>so they can optimize their code across the whole family.</p>
<p>And these new Macs can do something that no Mac has ever done before.</p>
<p>For the first time ever,</p>
<p>you can run your favorite iPhone and iPad apps directly on your Mac.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have more games to play, more content to watch</p>
<p>and more apps for everything you want to do.</p>
<p>Altogether,</p>
<p>you get access to the biggest collection of apps ever for the Mac.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to get better</p>
<p>as developers continue to build new apps for M1.</p>
<p>Here are some of them in action.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>-Hi. -Oh, hey. There you are.</p>
<p>-Hello, world. -[voices] Hello, world.</p>
<p>I work for a company called Panic.</p>
<p>-Cinema 4D. -Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been at Adobe for over 20 years.</p>
<p>At Panic, we make Mac software.</p>
<p>A coding app for kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;mmhmm&rdquo; helps people be less boring on video.</p>
<p>When we first heard about Apple Silicon on Mac&hellip;</p>
<p>[Cook] We&rsquo;re announcing that the Mac is transitioning&hellip;</p>
<p>to our own Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>It blew my mind.</p>
<p>-One word was&hellip; -Amazing.</p>
<p>We were just waiting for this specific moment.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the desktop?</p>
<p>A device that we all think we know so well.</p>
<p>We got the first developer units as soon as they were announced.</p>
<p>This was the easiest transition that we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Getting our apps ready for Apple Silicon on Mac literally took us a day.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to do anything to port to them.</p>
<p>-Hit the &ldquo;run&rdquo; button. -Took me 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Here we are. We got this. We got this. We got this.</p>
<p>-[echoing] Boom! -Wow!</p>
<p>You immediately notice that it&rsquo;s incredibly fast.</p>
<p>We can move much faster.</p>
<p>[Bryan] There are some operations which are really quite remarkable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Select object.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve seen that operation up to eight times faster.</p>
<p>[Michael] We can travel the entire world of the Forgotten Realms</p>
<p>without any kind of texture popping.</p>
<p>-It was rendering&hellip; -Two times faster.</p>
<p>Three times faster.</p>
<p>-Four times. -Eight times.</p>
<p>-Ten times. -Much, much faster.</p>
<p>[speaking German]</p>
<p>People are going to be blown away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some dark magic at work, and I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>It just feels super smooth.</p>
<p>Super smooth.</p>
<p>[thuds]</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use any of that.</p>
<p>-For us, it&rsquo;s always about&hellip; -The power.</p>
<p>The more powerful the computer is, the more we can have fun in our apps.</p>
<p>For example, using Core ML to automatically detect hand position.</p>
<p>[man] Edit 8K RAW footage.</p>
<p>[man 2] Hundreds of thousands of layers.</p>
<p>[woman] Millions of objects.</p>
<p>[Michael] Almost limitless interactivity.</p>
<p>[man 3] Rotate. Zoom.</p>
<p>[Ash] We can keep zooming in. Keep zooming in some more.</p>
<p>At this point, we&rsquo;re 100 million percent zoomed in.</p>
<p>The future that I dream of&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me look into the crystal ball.</p>
<p>[man 4] A seamless workflow from your phone or your iPad to your Mac.</p>
<p>[man 5] Pushing the limits on each and every surface.</p>
<p>You open that giant file, and, boom, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>[man 6] See the infiniteness in what you can create.</p>
<p>[man 7] It&rsquo;s a different level of what we thought was gonna be possible.</p>
<p>We are in the future right now.</p>
<p>This is gonna be huge.</p>
<p>What can&rsquo;t we do with Apple Silicon on Mac?</p>
<p>[woman 2] Um&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a super good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see developers take advantage</p>
<p>of the incredible performance and features of M1 and Big Sur.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see them reimagine what apps can do.</p>
<p>Over to you, John.</p>
<p>The combination of M1 and macOS Big Sur is super exciting.</p>
<p>It truly takes the Mac to a whole new level.</p>
<p>So now we have all the technologies we need for the next generation of Mac.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time to introduce the first Mac with M1,</p>
<p>a product where the power efficiency of M1 changes everything.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>This is the new MacBook Air with M1.</p>
<p>The day the first MacBook Air was pulled out of that manila envelope,</p>
<p>it defined the category of thin and light notebooks.</p>
<p>And our users have been loving it ever since.</p>
<p>Now with the groundbreaking efficiency of M1,</p>
<p>the new MacBook Air will completely redefine</p>
<p>what a thin and light notebook can do.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Laura.</p>
<p>MacBook Air is the most popular Mac.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s best-selling 13-inch notebook.</p>
<p>Users love its stunning Retina display,</p>
<p>great everyday performance and incredible portability,</p>
<p>all in a sleek, wedge-shaped design.</p>
<p>These days, users are working more from home,</p>
<p>learning remotely and using the Air to stay connected,</p>
<p>making performance and battery life extremely important.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re thrilled that M1, our first chip for the Mac,</p>
<p>enables MacBook Air to do things that were previously impossible</p>
<p>on such a thin and light notebook.</p>
<p>With eight incredibly powerful cores,</p>
<p>the CPU soars to a whole new level of performance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up to three and a half times faster than the previous generation.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re editing family photos</p>
<p>or exporting a video for the web with iMovie,</p>
<p>the new Air blazes right through it.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re working in Lightroom, you can manage huge RAW libraries</p>
<p>at unheard-of speeds,</p>
<p>turning your Air into a mobile photo studio.</p>
<p>And with the world&rsquo;s fastest integrated graphics</p>
<p>that feature up to eight cores,</p>
<p>Air delivers up to five times faster graphics performance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest leap ever for MacBook Air.</p>
<p>So when it comes to gaming,</p>
<p>you can play immersive, graphically-intensive titles</p>
<p>at significantly higher frame rates.</p>
<p>And for the first time, you can edit multiple streams</p>
<p>of full-quality 4K ProRes video without dropping a frame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mind-blowing for such a thin and light notebook.</p>
<p>And when you compare MacBook Air</p>
<p>to the best-selling Windows laptop in its class,</p>
<p>the new Air is up to three times faster.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even more amazing is that with M1,</p>
<p>MacBook Air is faster than 98% of PC laptops sold in the last year.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about that Neural Engine.</p>
<p>With 16 cores, machine learning workloads</p>
<p>are up to an astonishing nine times faster than the previous Air.</p>
<p>So apps like Final Cut Pro that use ML-based features</p>
<p>such as Smart Conform to intelligently frame a clip</p>
<p>can do so in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>And even storage gets a performance boost,</p>
<p>with SSDs that are up to two times faster,</p>
<p>thanks to the M1 storage controller and latest flash technology.</p>
<p>So tasks like previewing massive, high-res images</p>
<p>or importing large files are super quick.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also remarkable</p>
<p>is that with the industry-leading efficiency of the M1 chip,</p>
<p>combined with the power management in macOS Big Sur,</p>
<p>the new Air delivers all this performance without a fan.</p>
<p>So no matter how intense the task, MacBook Air is completely silent.</p>
<p>And that same incredible efficiency also delivers extraordinary battery life,</p>
<p>with up to 15 hours of wireless web browsing</p>
<p>and up to an amazing 18 hours of video playback.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s six hours longer than before.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re video conferencing, which can rapidly drain the battery,</p>
<p>you can go up to twice as long on a single charge.</p>
<p>This is the longest battery life ever in a MacBook Air.</p>
<p>And as users connect with friends, family and coworkers remotely,</p>
<p>we know camera image quality matters even more.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited that with M1,</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s latest Image Signal Processor comes to the Mac.</p>
<p>This ISP delivers better noise reduction and greater dynamic range</p>
<p>for sharper images and more detail in shadows and highlights,</p>
<p>as well as improved auto white balance combined with ML-enhanced face detection,</p>
<p>so you look more natural on your FaceTime calls.</p>
<p>In fact, everything looks stunning on the 13-inch Retina display,</p>
<p>which now supports P3 wide color</p>
<p>for even more vibrant, true-to-life images.</p>
<p>And with the Secure Enclave in M1, combined with Big Sur,</p>
<p>Air delivers best-in-class security with features like Touch ID,</p>
<p>which make it easy to unlock your Mac</p>
<p>and make secure online purchases using Apple Pay</p>
<p>with just the touch of your finger.</p>
<p>And finally, all these powerful features with a completely new level of performance</p>
<p>are delivered in a sleek, wedge-shaped design.</p>
<p>With M1 and Big Sur, we&rsquo;ve taken the MacBook Air</p>
<p>and transformed it into something far beyond any other thin and light notebook.</p>
<p>And even with this gigantic increase in performance,</p>
<p>along with its new features, the Air still starts at just $999.</p>
<p>And for education, it starts at just $899,</p>
<p>delivering way more value than ever before.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new MacBook Air.</p>
<p>With M1, it has jaw-dropping performance,</p>
<p>three and a half times faster CPU, five times faster GPU,</p>
<p>all in a silent, fan-less design.</p>
<p>It also has a more vibrant Retina display,</p>
<p>improved camera quality and incredible battery life:</p>
<p>up to 18 hours, the longest ever in a MacBook Air.</p>
<p>So once again, MacBook Air completely redefines</p>
<p>what a thin and light notebook can do.</p>
<p>Back to you, John.</p>
<p>This new MacBook Air is amazing.</p>
<p>So think about what we&rsquo;ve done here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken our most popular notebook and, with M1, given it more performance</p>
<p>than 98% of PC laptops sold in the last year,</p>
<p>a huge increase in battery life,</p>
<p>and at the same time, we pulled out the fan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just nuts.</p>
<p>With that unbelievable combination of performance and portability,</p>
<p>it is by far the best MacBook Air we&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all, because today we&rsquo;re bringing M1 to another beloved Mac.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>This is the new Mac mini.</p>
<p>The tremendous level of integration offered</p>
<p>by the system-on-a-chip design of M1</p>
<p>allows us to pack a remarkable amount of performance and capability</p>
<p>into its compact design.</p>
<p>To tell you more about it, here&rsquo;s Julie.</p>
<p>Mac mini delivers the Mac desktop experience</p>
<p>in an incredibly small form factor.</p>
<p>Our users love its outstanding performance,</p>
<p>array of connectivity and signature design.</p>
<p>And most of all, they love its versatility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll find Mac minis everywhere, from home offices to home theaters,</p>
<p>studios to render farms.</p>
<p>Today, M1 comes to Mac mini,</p>
<p>bringing a seismic shift in what an ultracompact desktop can do.</p>
<p>With the 8-core CPU in M1,</p>
<p>Mac mini delivers up to three times faster CPU performance</p>
<p>than the previous quad-core version.</p>
<p>This is a monumental leap in CPU performance for Mac mini.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a developer compiling a million lines in Xcode,</p>
<p>or a musician using Logic Pro to take music production to a whole new level,</p>
<p>performance never skips a beat.</p>
<p>And the 8-core GPU gives the mini</p>
<p>a gigantic sixfold increase in graphics performance.</p>
<p>This enables you to do things you wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamed of before on the Mac mini,</p>
<p>like designing a graphics-intensive game in Unity.</p>
<p>Or when the work is done, cranking up the graphic settings</p>
<p>while playing a great game like Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III.</p>
<p>The mini has an outrageous amount of performance in such a compact design.</p>
<p>In fact, if you compare Mac mini to the top-selling PC desktop in its price range,</p>
<p>the mini is just one-tenth the size,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s up to five times faster.</p>
<p>Mac mini just blows the competition away.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more!</p>
<p>With M1 bringing the Neural Engine to Mac mini,</p>
<p>machine learning workloads take a quantum leap forward</p>
<p>with up to 15 times faster ML performance than the previous generation.</p>
<p>This means the new Mac mini</p>
<p>will supercharge innovative features that are powered by ML,</p>
<p>like magically increasing the resolution of a photo in Pixelmator Pro,</p>
<p>giving it more sharpness and detail.</p>
<p>It also makes Mac mini a great machine for developers, scientists and engineers</p>
<p>utilizing deep learning technologies like TensorFlow or Create ML,</p>
<p>which are now accelerated by M1.</p>
<p>And with the Mac mini&rsquo;s advanced thermal design,</p>
<p>M1 is unleashed,</p>
<p>easily sustaining its breakthrough performance</p>
<p>while the mini stays cool and quiet.</p>
<p>When it comes to connectivity, there&rsquo;s an array of I/O,</p>
<p>including two USB-C ports that now support both Thunderbolt and USB 4</p>
<p>to connect a wide range of peripherals,</p>
<p>including the Pro Display XDR at a full 6K resolution.</p>
<p>With the M1 chip and Big Sur,</p>
<p>our most versatile Mac packs a staggering amount of performance</p>
<p>and incredible new features.</p>
<p>And even with all of its power and capability,</p>
<p>Mac mini now starts at just $699.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s $100 lower than the previous generation.</p>
<p>No other desktop combines such breathtaking performance</p>
<p>with such an affordable price.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the mighty new Mac mini.</p>
<p>Powered by the M1 chip, it takes an enormous jump in performance,</p>
<p>with a three times faster CPU, six times faster GPU</p>
<p>and the Neural Engine that boosts ML performance up to 15 times.</p>
<p>The new Mac mini is a phenomenal desktop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s far more versatile and far more capable than ever.</p>
<p>Now back to John.</p>
<p>This really is the most incredible Mac mini we&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration and phenomenal graphics capabilities of M1,</p>
<p>this new mini will enable high-performance,</p>
<p>general-purpose computing</p>
<p>in a way that was never before possible in such a compact design.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been a Mac mini like it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re still not done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen how the efficiency and integration of M1</p>
<p>yields incredible capability and performance</p>
<p>in the MacBook Air and Mac mini.</p>
<p>That performance is so good that it&rsquo;s also an excellent choice</p>
<p>for another one of our most popular Macs.</p>
<p>The perfect Mac for many creative pros.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the new 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>With M1, our most popular and affordable MacBook Pro</p>
<p>dramatically changes your expectations of what a compact pro notebook can do.</p>
<p>And to tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Shruti.</p>
<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro is the best-selling notebook in its class,</p>
<p>and it appeals to an incredibly wide range of users.</p>
<p>Students rely on it to get them through college.</p>
<p>And pros use it to channel their creativity</p>
<p>and produce awe-inspiring work.</p>
<p>Users love it because it delivers powerful performance and has a gorgeous display,</p>
<p>all in a sleek and portable three-pound design.</p>
<p>And with M1, the 13-inch MacBook Pro</p>
<p>becomes way more powerful and way more pro.</p>
<p>The 8-core CPU delivers up to 2.8 times faster performance.</p>
<p>This is game-changing for developers using Xcode,</p>
<p>who can now build their apps nearly three times faster than before,</p>
<p>and for photographers using Photoshop,</p>
<p>who can apply filters and effects to high-res photos faster than ever.</p>
<p>When it comes to graphics,</p>
<p>the 8-core GPU is up to a whopping five times faster.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re using Shapr3D to design a new product</p>
<p>or constructing an immersive new world in Cinema 4D,</p>
<p>the new MacBook Pro handles it all with ease.</p>
<p>And when compared to the best-selling Windows laptop in its class,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to three times faster.</p>
<p>In fact, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro can do things</p>
<p>that no other compact, three-pound pro notebook can do,</p>
<p>like play back 8K ProRes footage in full quality in DaVinci Resolve</p>
<p>without dropping a single frame.</p>
<p>And when it comes to machine learning, performance is spectacular.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>ML is up to 11 times faster than the previous generation,</p>
<p>which means for on-device ML tasks that use the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>the 13-inch MacBook Pro is the world&rsquo;s fastest compact pro notebook.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro also features an active cooling system.</p>
<p>This allows it to sustain its remarkable pro performance</p>
<p>when ripping through intensive tasks like video transcode in Compressor.</p>
<p>And even with all this unbelievable compute power,</p>
<p>the battery life is simply amazing.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efficiency of M1 running Big Sur,</p>
<p>the new MacBook Pro delivers up to an incredible 17 hours</p>
<p>for wireless web browsing</p>
<p>and up to 20 hours for video playback.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 10 more hours than before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the longest battery life ever in a Mac.</p>
<p>And with this combination of performance and awesome battery life,</p>
<p>the productivity of our pro users goes through the roof.</p>
<p>For instance, software developers can compile four times as much code</p>
<p>on a single charge.</p>
<p>The new Pro also has studio-quality mics with an improved signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re on a FaceTime call or recording a vocal track,</p>
<p>audio will be super clean.</p>
<p>And it benefits from the M1&rsquo;s advanced camera ISP.</p>
<p>So when users are connecting with coworkers on video calls,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have sharper video with less grain</p>
<p>and better contrast and detail in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>With Big Sur and the Secure Enclave,</p>
<p>you get best-in-class security features like Activation Lock,</p>
<p>which helps protect your Mac if it&rsquo;s ever lost or stolen.</p>
<p>And finally, with its two Thunderbolt ports with USB 4 support,</p>
<p>the new Pro connects to more peripherals than ever,</p>
<p>including the Pro Display XDR at full 6K resolution.</p>
<p>All these mind-blowing leaps in performance,</p>
<p>new features and amazing battery life</p>
<p>still fit in the same incredibly portable three-pound design.</p>
<p>With Big Sur and the M1 chip at the heart of the 13-inch MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>it shatters the limits of what a compact pro notebook can do.</p>
<p>And with all this performance and new capabilities,</p>
<p>the new Pro is still just $1299.</p>
<p>And just $1199 for education.</p>
<p>An incredible value for both students and pros alike.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>With M1, our most popular MacBook Pro gets a tremendous boost</p>
<p>in CPU, graphics and ML performance.</p>
<p>And along with its studio-quality mics and improved camera performance,</p>
<p>it has the best battery life ever in a Mac.</p>
<p>This is more than a massive upgrade.</p>
<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro is the ultimate expression of what the M1 chip can do.</p>
<p>Now back to John.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled about the new Mac mini,</p>
<p>MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the first of a new generation of Mac.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same Mac experience you know and love,</p>
<p>yet faster and better in so many ways.</p>
<p>These systems offer up to three and a half times faster CPU performance</p>
<p>and up to six times faster GPU performance,</p>
<p>which is the largest generational improvement we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>They bring many of the best features from iPad and iPhone,</p>
<p>like instant wake, long battery life,</p>
<p>incredible ML acceleration that&rsquo;s up to 15 times faster,</p>
<p>and industry-leading security to the Mac.</p>
<p>And by building upon a common architecture,</p>
<p>these new Macs can now tap into the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>and most vibrant software ecosystem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also proud that these products have been carefully designed</p>
<p>to support our net-zero carbon goal.</p>
<p>The cleanest energy is the energy you never use.</p>
<p>And thanks to the efficiency of M1,</p>
<p>energy consumption is reduced by up to 60%</p>
<p>when these products are in active use.</p>
<p>So while there is always more to do,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thrilled with the progress we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>It is so exciting to be able to reinvent</p>
<p>three of our most popular and affordable Macs.</p>
<p>And to make things even more exciting,</p>
<p>you can order the new MacBook Air, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro starting today.</p>
<p>And they will all be available next week.</p>
<p>And macOS Big Sur will be available this Thursday.</p>
<p>These new systems with M1 join the rest of our Mac product line,</p>
<p>including some phenomenal products that we&rsquo;ve introduced over the last year.</p>
<p>This is by far the strongest Mac lineup that we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>The transition to Apple Silicon</p>
<p>is going to have a profound impact on the Mac.</p>
<p>It will bring performance and capabilities that have never been possible before.</p>
<p>Now, this journey will take a couple of years to complete,</p>
<p>and we have a long way to go, but we&rsquo;re off to one heck of a start.</p>
<p>We are so proud of this new family of products,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to see what our users are going to do with them.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn it back to Tim, but before I do,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a short film we made to celebrate these new Macs.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>-[chimes] -Ooh.</p>
<p>The chime is back?</p>
<p>I love the&hellip; [imitates chime] &hellip;sound.</p>
<p>-This chip. -I see &ldquo;Apple M1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s the Apple chip! -That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just gonna get right into it.</p>
<p>It opens like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super responsive.</p>
<p>Wow. Really fast.</p>
<p>It feels very playful.</p>
<p>-Click, click, click. -It&rsquo;s got eight cores in it,</p>
<p>in this tiny thing.</p>
<p>Not even warm. It&rsquo;s probably cooler than my own hands.</p>
<p>The battery is more time than I generally spend awake in a day.</p>
<p>No noise. It&rsquo;s absolutely silent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p>[man] What&rsquo;s really satisfying is when you&rsquo;re sitting with someone,</p>
<p>and they go, &ldquo;I want it to be like&hellip;&rdquo; and you go, &ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the faster you can make that happen for them,</p>
<p>that, to me, is like wizardry.</p>
<p>There is a magic that happens here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about letting me create faster than my hand can move.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this on a MacBook Air now, which means it&rsquo;s more accessible.</p>
<p>I can get used to this. [laughs]</p>
<p>[gasps] Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. So fast!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>This truly is a huge day for the Mac and a huge day for Apple.</p>
<p>Advancements of this magnitude only come from making bold changes.</p>
<p>The M1 chip is by far</p>
<p>the most powerful chip that we have ever created.</p>
<p>It makes these Macs dramatically faster,</p>
<p>provides all-new capabilities with extraordinary battery life</p>
<p>and enables the Mac to run more software than ever.</p>
<p>This is exactly why we are transitioning the Mac to Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>At Apple,</p>
<p>our mission is to create products that play a meaningful role in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>2020 has been a year unlike any other in so many ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inspired by the strength, resilience and creativity</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen displayed by people all around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also extremely proud of our teams</p>
<p>and the work they&rsquo;ve done to deliver such incredible products</p>
<p>during these challenging times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing what you will do with these products.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also looking forward to 2021</p>
<p>and bringing even more amazing experiences to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us, stay safe, stay well,</p>
<p>and have a great day.</p>
<p>[pop music playing]</p>
<p>Uh&hellip; [stammers]</p>
<p>Stop! Hang on. Wait. One more thing.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m a PC.</p>
<p>Is there time for questions? Good, &lsquo;cause I have one.</p>
<p>Why? Why?</p>
<p>Why make all these advancements? What&rsquo;s the point? Right?</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re so quiet now.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m a machine. I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
<p>[imitates mechanical whirring] That&rsquo;s my fan.</p>
<p>Longer battery life? Plug it in.</p>
<p>Where are you going? Just plug it in.</p>
<p>Fast? I&rsquo;m fast. I&rsquo;m still fast. Check it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got it.</p>
<p>PC. Still got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been there. I always will be.</p>
<p>Fast.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My battery&rsquo;s drained. I gotta go plug in.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Whoo! Outlet!</p>
