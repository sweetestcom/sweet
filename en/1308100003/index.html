Oh, do I need to get my glasses?
Did you put on panties?

I don&amp;rsquo;t want the vagine all over the podcast.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already got my armpit.
Fix me, Nelly.
That is a very loaded request, yes.'>

    <p>There you are.</p>
<p>Oh, do I need to get my glasses?</p>
<p>Did you put on panties?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like National Commando Day.</p>
<p>Every day is National Commando Day for me, except with this dress on.</p>
<p>So what made you want to wear panties today?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your vagine on?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the vagine all over the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already got my armpit.</p>
<p>Fix me, Nelly.</p>
<p>That is a very loaded request, yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with your boobs?</p>
<p>I feel like&hellip;</p>
<p>Does that better?</p>
<p>In that, they kind of look like they were&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>I mean, you just kind of got big boobs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed younger people are not getting boob jobs at the rate our generation did.</p>
<p>The big boob thing is out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>What happened to your fingers?</p>
<p>Is that from pickleball?</p>
<p>Did you whack it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>An unfortunate thing happened where Josh and I were walking Cha Cha and Tubby, and</p>
<p>they took off running, and Tubby ran right under my legs, and my legs went straight up</p>
<p>in the air, and I face-planted.</p>
<p>Like you knocked your head on it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On concrete.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you got road rash on your fingers?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I had road rash.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a huge, huge tumble.</p>
<p>God, I wish I would have seen that.</p>
<p>I would have been so happy.</p>
<p>We got to do the introduction to the podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just have to let everybody in on something that happened yesterday.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a podcast prep meeting, and Pumps, as all of you fucking know her as,</p>
<p>Pumps, she told me and the producers that she wants to de-identify as Pumps.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say de-identify.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>You said that you didn&rsquo;t want to say, hi, I&rsquo;m Pumps.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It, everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer, and this is Angela Dawn.</p>
<p>And my co-host, formerly known as Pumps.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with casseroles.</p>
<p>You gave me shit about the watermelon.</p>
<p>You come up with casserole?</p>
<p>I mean, you have no moral high ground on that.</p>
<p>How many casseroles have you eaten in the last six months?</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with over explainers.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I mean, we have long, long since talked about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this new, like, convenience store by my house, and on the thing it says $3 gas.</p>
<p>So I go up, and I notice on the pump thing, it&rsquo;s like $3.17.</p>
<p>So I go in, and I&rsquo;m like, hey, what&rsquo;s the deal with the price being $3 on the sign,</p>
<p>and then at the pump, it&rsquo;s not that same?</p>
<p>So this woman, probably teenager, comes over and starts explaining to me about fuel injection</p>
<p>and all this shit.</p>
<p>Then the manager comes over, and then they start fighting over who&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, time out.</p>
<p>All I want to know, it says $3 on the sign.</p>
<p>At the pump, it doesn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Why do you have to have an auto mechanic engineering degree to get gas these days?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;ll go out and check it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>So then the whole way to the pump, he walks with me explaining, like, fuel injection and</p>
<p>all that shit I don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>Then we get to the pump, and he goes, oh, the cheaper gas is with the blue handle.</p>
<p>The outside pumps don&rsquo;t have the blue handle.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of my life, I&rsquo;ll never get back.</p>
<p>Walk in, where&rsquo;s the $3 gas?</p>
<p>Go to the blue handle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m furious for the whole day, because I&rsquo;m like, why the fuck are you explaining</p>
<p>fuel injection?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the dumbest person that ever got gas.</p>
<p>I think you have some ownership in this.</p>
<p>When you go ask that question to the people that work at the gas station, that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>kind of what you&rsquo;re bound to get.</p>
<p>So I have on my office door here a sign that says, in red, bold, cap locks, stop.</p>
<p>Do not enter unless you have an appointment with Jennifer Welch Designs.</p>
<p>My problem is, at least five to six times a day, I have people that walk in that door,</p>
<p>they read that sign, walk in, my suite is suite two, and they&rsquo;ll walk in and say, where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>suite four?</p>
<p>I would do that.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>Of course you would.</p>
<p>Of course you would.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just flop right in.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even slow me down even a tiny bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not alone, because people do it all the time.</p>
<p>This woman walks in the other day, and she&rsquo;s like, the dogs are going bananas.</p>
<p>She read the sign.</p>
<p>I watched her read it.</p>
<p>Despite reading it twice, she opens it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m, you know, all ears.</p>
<p>Why are you here?</p>
<p>Because I look at the calendar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no appointment.</p>
<p>And it says, do not come in unless you have an appointment.</p>
<p>So I know that this person is a problem right out of the gates, right?</p>
<p>So she says, where&rsquo;s suite four?</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She gets argumentative with me.</p>
<p>She goes, you don&rsquo;t know where suite four is?</p>
<p>And I go, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She was like, you don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where suite four is?</p>
<p>She was arguing about it.</p>
<p>She was mad at me that I didn&rsquo;t know where her meeting was.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;s acting like I&rsquo;m the asshole because I don&rsquo;t know where suite four is.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about months of built-up anger, right?</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s mad.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s bickering with me.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know where suite four is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So she goes, turns around and stomps out.</p>
<p>And then I said, just as loud as I possibly could, you fucking bitch.</p>
<p>No, you did not.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that might&rsquo;ve been a little overkill?</p>
<p>A hundred percent it was overkill.</p>
<p>I was completely out of my mind.</p>
<p>About five seconds later, I&rsquo;m like, I cannot believe I just did that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That was really bad.</p>
<p>It felt so good.</p>
<p>You know how people just like, you know, you see crazy people doing crazy shit and you</p>
<p>think, God, you know, can you just, can I just be crazy once?</p>
<p>Can I just do crazy shit one day?</p>
<p>And I did.</p>
<p>And you liked it?</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>I really cannot believe you screamed fucking bitch.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>That is some serious rage.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I mean, I was out of my mind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know that woman was like, that fucking bitch.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you something.</p>
<p>She was aggressive about my not knowing where sweet four is.</p>
<p>Arguing with you about it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s literally acting like that we are positioned there to guide her to where her</p>
<p>appointment is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So number one, she was arrogant.</p>
<p>She was a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>She poked the bear.</p>
<p>And if she comes back in, I will double down.</p>
<p>So I have to tell you what today&rsquo;s topic is something that I&rsquo;m so excited about.</p>
<p>So I think it was last week or the week before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Instagram, right?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, people are like posting like these really sweet, you know, multi-photo</p>
<p>layered posts that it&rsquo;s National Son&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Several things are going through my mind as I&rsquo;m seeing these.</p>
<p>Why do we have a National Son&rsquo;s Day?</p>
<p>The least of which being, oh, that is such an adorable post and this is so cute.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>When did this happen?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I&rsquo;m on the internet and it&rsquo;s National Son&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>And as you know, I have two sons.</p>
<p>This comes out of left field.</p>
<p>I have no idea that this is a thing.</p>
<p>And so then finally, I just see everybody.</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>My sons are so great.</p>
<p>My sons are my life.</p>
<p>First and foremost, everybody feels the same way about their sons.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So finally, I mean, I&rsquo;m seeing it.</p>
<p>And then I think, God, I don&rsquo;t want Dylan Roman to think I&rsquo;m an asshole because you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>Peer pressure.</p>
<p>So I post on my story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the only asshole on Instagram that doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge her son.</p>
<p>So happy son&rsquo;s day, Dylan and Roman.</p>
<p>My question is, when did all of this happen?</p>
<p>National Daughter&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>National Son&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>National Donut Day.</p>
<p>National Take Your Wife to Dinner Day.</p>
<p>But the peer pressure is real.</p>
<p>Like if your kids are on Instagram, see everybody else going on and on and on about their kids</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t post, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the asshole parent.</p>
<p>No doubt about it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And even probably more so than Roman and Dylan, because I don&rsquo;t think they would care as much,</p>
<p>but like your friends that know you have two kids that would be like, oh, what&rsquo;s the deal</p>
<p>with Jennifer and her kids?</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t post.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like do people do that though?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s social media&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to blanketly throw it out there.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have social media.</p>
<p>Nobody would give a shit what day it was.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What I want to know is who decided this?</p>
<p>Who decided it?</p>
<p>Is there a committee?</p>
<p>Is there any oversight?</p>
<p>Or can I just get on Instagram today, right now, and say it&rsquo;s national de-identify with</p>
<p>your iconic nickname day?</p>
<p>Who decided this?</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>His name is Marlo Anderson, and he is the man responsible for the national holiday calendar.</p>
<p>On your birthday, for example, guess what national day it is?</p>
<p>Well, I also know it&rsquo;s Michael Jordan&rsquo;s birthday, so national basketball day.</p>
<p>That would make sense.</p>
<p>That would make sense.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s national cabbage day.</p>
<p>So Jen Morton, our illustrious producer, her birthday&rsquo;s May 9th, and her national holiday</p>
<p>is national sock memorial day.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why do you have a memorial for a sock?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because you lose a sock.</p>
<p>Oftentimes socks are born in pairs, and then you lose a sock, and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re grieving that lost sock, and it&rsquo;s a national day memorial.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but these are questions for Marlo.</p>
<p>And I have to be serious because that really just sounds kind of stupid.</p>
<p>Be fucking nice to our guest.</p>
<p>Okay, I can be nice.</p>
<p>Be nice to the guest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so nice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Nilly, June 12th, national jerky day.</p>
<p>Like beef jerky?</p>
<p>Do we need a day for jerky?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need a day.</p>
<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t need a fucking day for any of this shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I mean, August 7th is actually a month, and it is national dog month.</p>
<p>At the Welch residence, it&rsquo;s dog year, after year, after year, after year.</p>
<p>A lot of people think their dogs are human, like you do.</p>
<p>National lima bean respect day.</p>
<p>See, that just minimizes the whole day process.</p>
<p>That makes me want to boycott every day.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a lima bean farmer.</p>
<p>How many lima bean farmers are there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to find out.</p>
<p>Where do they even&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>I go on.</p>
<p>National rat catcher&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Rat catcher like the band from the 80s or like the little furry?</p>
<p>Who thinks of this shit?</p>
<p>This guy thinks of it?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>National listen to your cat day.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>August 8th, national sneak some zucchini into your neighbor&rsquo;s porch day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now I understand.</p>
<p>I mean, and then there&rsquo;s a national pirate day, where you dress up like a pirate.</p>
<p>Can you make some pirate booty?</p>
<p>What do pirates say, Pops?</p>
<p>Ahoy.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or arrr.</p>
<p>Welcome to the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>So let me introduce this Pumps is Marlo Anderson.</p>
<p>Marlo, I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>This is Angie, but we call her Pumps and Marlo, we understand that you are the man responsible</p>
<p>for the national holiday calendar.</p>
<p>I guess I have been given that honor.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve noticed, you know, cause I&rsquo;m on Instagram that suddenly over the last few years, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>like, for example, last week or the week before I&rsquo;m on and everybody&rsquo;s like, I love my sons</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s pictures of their sons and they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s national Sunday.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, am I an asshole that I didn&rsquo;t prepare anything for national</p>
<p>son&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>As the days went on and the posts build up, finally, I posted my story like, hey, everybody,</p>
<p>this brand new holiday national son&rsquo;s day, I didn&rsquo;t want to be the only asshole that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t post about my sons.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;re curious about how did these new holidays start?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I know it seems like it&rsquo;s new, just like what you said, Jennifer, that you start</p>
<p>feeling like a jerk because you didn&rsquo;t, you didn&rsquo;t do something to yourself because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen somebody else post it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>A lot of other people feel the same way.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, it starts to trend.</p>
<p>And if you were to go in and just do a search right now on the hashtag national daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>day, I&rsquo;m guaranteeing you that there are posts from today, even though that was a month ago.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s your son or daughter or your mom or your dad or your grandparents, whatever</p>
<p>it is, your pet that, that you got that little guilt thing going on that you should do something</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>Are you the, the overseer of these new national holidays?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m the founder of national day calendar.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I started a blog about 10 years ago and at that time there were probably about 30</p>
<p>of these that were somewhat popular.</p>
<p>I started to dig into the history of where they came from and I started to post every</p>
<p>day about other national days that were declared in the past from, you know, Congress back</p>
<p>in 1796 or a president in 1842 and started to write about these.</p>
<p>And then the media started to follow that and then they started to trend.</p>
<p>We actually, I dug up about 1200 national days over the course, since the beginning</p>
<p>of our country and then started to write about them and their histories and that type of</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve all become prominent since then.</p>
<p>And then since then we&rsquo;ve probably added about another 300 to the calendar.</p>
<p>Is there, what is today?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s national no bra day.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;s something you can get behind.</p>
<p>She takes her bra off on airplanes.</p>
<p>This is like serendipity.</p>
<p>I swear to God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>She loves not wearing a bra.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you take your bra off?</p>
<p>The second dragons I have enough trouble with without the cameras.</p>
<p>No, I cannot believe it&rsquo;s no bra day.</p>
<p>I was, we were on a flight a few years ago to Mexico and I look over and she is sitting</p>
<p>next to this poor woman and Angie takes her bra off.</p>
<p>And as she&rsquo;s flinging it across, she slaps this woman in the face who&rsquo;s wearing a mask</p>
<p>pre COVID.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s clearly a germaphobe, slaps her in the face.</p>
<p>And I thought, God, that poor woman is sitting next to this train wreck of a friend of mine,</p>
<p>but it is national no bra day.</p>
<p>And then is today a double dipper day where we have two national holidays?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Yorkshire pudding day.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also the Navy&rsquo;s birthday as well.</p>
<p>Oh, the Navy&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who made that, that decision for those to be national days?</p>
<p>So the history of national days, how they came to be is as varied as the days themselves.</p>
<p>A ton of them came from Congress and presidents and they were lobbied by whatever.</p>
<p>And I always pick on bittersweet chocolate covered almond day, which I think is hilarious</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t even have chocolate covered almond day, but we have bittersweet chocolate</p>
<p>covered almond day.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Most of these national days were just one-offs.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t supposed to continue on and on and on.</p>
<p>And then so this crazy guy from North Dakota in 2013 starts writing about him again, hence</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they come back to life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the story about how they were just for one time.</p>
<p>And then they come back again because of a blog I started to write, got picked up by</p>
<p>the media.</p>
<p>And then social media just takes over from that point.</p>
<p>So I have an idea for a national holiday.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to tell you what it is.</p>
<p>And then I want you to tell me and our listeners how we can make this a national holiday.</p>
<p>Is everybody ready?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so anxious to hear this.</p>
<p>National.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>National.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with national holidays.</p>
<p>How do we make that happen?</p>
<p>How would we do that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the first, by the way.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Dang it.</p>
<p>Not original.</p>
<p>But, but you could be the one who gets, who, you know, gets an organization behind this</p>
<p>to make it happen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So do I have, you mentioned lobbyists.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually like in Washington, there&rsquo;s lobbyists lobbying for these national days.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Congress and the president got out of this a long time ago.</p>
<p>We always think that those types of things are clever, you know, like having Pi Day on</p>
<p>March 14th and things like that.</p>
<p>So you get Pi Day.</p>
<p>I get Pi Day 3.14.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I want to know how the lima bean lobby got on their national lima bean respect day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that great?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d that happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that, Marlo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>I mean, how many people wrote it?</p>
<p>You have no respect for lima beans, obviously.</p>
<p>I do not respect lima beans.</p>
<p>Somebody does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Do you respect lima beans?</p>
<p>Well, I respect cabbage more, actually.</p>
<p>What about this one?</p>
<p>National Rat Catchers Day.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>So that goes back.</p>
<p>Marlo, what is going on?</p>
<p>How does this happen, Marlo?</p>
<p>I love that you dug these up.</p>
<p>This is so funny.</p>
<p>But that goes back to the Pied Piper.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That makes more sense.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a festival yet, I believe in Ireland, where there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>that dress up and they actually lead these make-believe rats out of town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a crazy thing and still goes on to this day.</p>
<p>And this is the thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about what you dislike, because we get people all the time that don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>a particular national day and we&rsquo;ll pick on lima beans.</p>
<p>Why in the world are you celebrating lima beans?</p>
<p>But I guarantee you when it&rsquo;s National Puppy Day, they&rsquo;re all over it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the things that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the things you do like.</p>
<p>And just have gratitude with the fact that some of these national days are things that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>Like lima beans.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like lima beans.</p>
<p>But I do like that.</p>
<p>Going for the positive.</p>
<p>When I think of lima beans, I think of passion.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hot, sweaty passion.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about some more.</p>
<p>So August 8th is National Sneak Some Zucchini Into Your Neighbor&rsquo;s Porch Day.</p>
<p>I think that is such a great holiday.</p>
<p>It is so popular.</p>
<p>Tell me why, Marlo.</p>
<p>Why is it so popular?</p>
<p>I need to know what this is about.</p>
<p>You know what zucchini is?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you ever grown it before?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>You know, you could grow zucchini anywhere and it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>One plant will sometimes give you 40 zucchinis and people, this is what happens.</p>
<p>People plant a couple of these things thinking they&rsquo;re going to get a couple, three zucchinis</p>
<p>and the next thing you know, it takes over the yard and you have 40 of these.</p>
<p>So this is a prank to give them away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a prank to give them away.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s another obscure one?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is one that I oppose with everything in me.</p>
<p>National Bring Your Teddy Bear to Work Day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of bring your dog to work.</p>
<p>Marlo, I have a lot of kindness in me, but also exist a cynical black heart.</p>
<p>And so that cynicism and that black heart of mine, me thinking about grown adults walking</p>
<p>into their offices with a teddy bear makes me want to scream at them, I have had it.</p>
<p>I do bring two living French bulldogs to work with me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you really shouldn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re living creatures.</p>
<p>Well, I know, but bringing them to work every day.</p>
<p>It hurts their feelings if they stay home alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m self-employed.</p>
<p>I get to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free country.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying in general.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of weird, too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s weird to bring your dog to work.</p>
<p>But you can admit that maybe it&rsquo;s weird to some people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not weird to you.</p>
<p>To people that hate dogs like yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;re off topic.</p>
<p>So sorry.</p>
<p>Back to the bring your teddy bear.</p>
<p>Oh, this is more fun.</p>
<p>You two keep going at it.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I mean, how many people do we think take their teddy bear to work?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Do we know?</p>
<p>Do we have any research?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure we can get it done in one day, though.</p>
<p>Like National Girlfriend&rsquo;s Day, we&rsquo;ll see a million people pop on our website.</p>
<p>Is that a?</p>
<p>Where on Bittersweet Chocolate-Covered Almond Day, we might get eight.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Bittersweet Chocolate-Covered Almond Day.</p>
<p>I need to just retire that day somehow or another.</p>
<p>I like it that there&rsquo;s one day that you&rsquo;ve had it with them, Marlo.</p>
<p>That even you, the expert of the national holidays, there is one that just really grinds</p>
<p>your gears.</p>
<p>I just, that is the one.</p>
<p>And everybody always gives me grief about it, too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not so much that I have a disdain towards Bittersweet Chocolate-Covered Almonds.</p>
<p>I just find it ironic that we do not have a Chocolate-Covered Almond Day.</p>
<p>This thing is so specific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about equality to you.</p>
<p>It is about equality.</p>
<p>This is an equality issue, right?</p>
<p>Why does the bittersweet get it and not milk chocolate, dark chocolate?</p>
<p>All the chocolates should have this, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one that I can get behind.</p>
<p>You are so great.</p>
<p>December 31st, Make Up Your Mind Day.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>Gotta shit or get off the pot.</p>
<p>Shit or get off the pot.</p>
<p>Get your shit together.</p>
<p>Pull yourself up by the bootstraps and make up your mind.</p>
<p>So if we went into lobby for a day, how would we do that?</p>
<p>So we have a process on our website.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a form that you fill out.</p>
<p>We get about 30,000 requests a year for new national days.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a committee that goes through them and a handful will get selected every</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What condition is your refrigerator in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in pretty good shape on the refrigerator.</p>
<p>What about you, Marlo?</p>
<p>Do you clean out your refrigerator on National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day, Marlo?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>At work.</p>
<p>On that day?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Do you have snacks in your office, Marlo?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>You should come to our office.</p>
<p>I should.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about her right here.</p>
<p>Not one snack.</p>
<p>Not a cracker.</p>
<p>Not a cracker, crackers.</p>
<p>Not one snack.</p>
<p>The only office in America without a snack.</p>
<p>Tell us about your snacks.</p>
<p>What do you have?</p>
<p>What you have to understand, you just have to come here because when it&rsquo;s National Strawberry</p>
<p>Shortcake Day, guess what we&rsquo;re having?</p>
<p>Oh, strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>Strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I bet it&rsquo;s a fun place to work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in North Dakota.</p>
<p>We are in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like Fargo?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re actually in a small town called Mandan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just right across the river from Bismarck.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the population of Mandan?</p>
<p>About 20,000 people.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re able to do this from there.</p>
<p>Shout out to North Dakota.</p>
<p>I think it really surprises people.</p>
<p>We have 15 million people that get my image every day through an email.</p>
<p>And then I also do, you know, we have a radio show and we have a TV news drop-in that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on 75 million households now, I think, or some crazy.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty significant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cool job.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to say, I would love to be on the committee.</p>
<p>I would probably be the skunk at the garden party on the committee.</p>
<p>You have to say no, like over 29,000 times a year.</p>
<p>Not a problem.</p>
<p>Not a problem at all.</p>
<p>So you only have to say yes, like, you know, 10 or 15 of 30,000 applications.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That could be problematic.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think you would fit in perfectly.</p>
<p>I do too, Marlo.</p>
<p>For this job.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>You know what I would do?</p>
<p>I would do some housekeeping, like lima beans, the chocolate, the bittersweet chocolate that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so butthurt about.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Out.</p>
<p>Hit the bricks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>How would you retire these days?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m looking for advice here.</p>
<p>I would just say the committee has met and we have decided not to renew your holiday.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>You are, you are the committee and you are the oversight as well, right?</p>
<p>So you can say you&rsquo;re a holiday or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That is awesome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the head bitch in charge.</p>
<p>He is the HBIC.</p>
<p>And I just think you say we have decided not to review your holiday, Lima Bean Respect</p>
<p>Day.</p>
<p>What if they gave him $100,000, though, I would renew it.</p>
<p>100% renew it immediately.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If they give you a big fat donation, then you keep it.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, $100,000.</p>
<p>And guess what you feel towards lima beans?</p>
<p>Oh, love lima beans.</p>
<p>Passion.</p>
<p>Passion.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;d be so good.</p>
<p>Respect.</p>
<p>Respect.</p>
<p>You two are hilarious.</p>
<p>$29,000.</p>
<p>You can be bought off is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Easily.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can easily be bribed.</p>
<p>If I was on the committee, I would kind of let it be known, like, she&rsquo;s the bitch.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the hard one.</p>
<p>But she does take bribes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She loves five star travel.</p>
<p>Since there is no oversight committee to this thing, I mean, it&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I actually envy this whole thing because it has a lot of power on social media these days.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s the biggest trending topic of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have a reach most days of over a billion people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just mind boggling when you think about it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I want you to know that we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to submit my national holiday that I&rsquo;ve had it with National Holidays Day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to submit it and then if there is a committee, I would like to argue my case</p>
<p>in front of the committee.</p>
<p>Part of being in the committee is you don&rsquo;t have to listen to people argue.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the oversight.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So he can just tell you to fuck right off.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, I love it.</p>
<p>The power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Power has not gone to your head at all, I will say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the perfect person to be in charge of it.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>I think you are the great ambassador for National Holidays.</p>
<p>Because we were kind of making fun of it, but I&rsquo;m in now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It really is about what you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you can just say screw it to the rest of them.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>You know, there are many days that I don&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t really appreciate on the calendar,</p>
<p>but a lot of times are just the messenger as well.</p>
<p>But I celebrate what I like to celebrate.</p>
<p>And usually there&rsquo;s something every day on the calendar that I can do that with.</p>
<p>And I would rather live a life of celebration than one that&rsquo;s angry, mad at the world, whatever.</p>
<p>You know, I know, Jennifer, that&rsquo;s really contrary to what you believe.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Touche, Marlo.</p>
<p>Touche.</p>
<p>I love the fact that you&rsquo;re laughing now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>No, I, you know, I agree with you that the celebration, I do like I agree with all of</p>
<p>that intellectually.</p>
<p>I have just found that the older I get, I&rsquo;ve just gotten horribly cynical about everything</p>
<p>and really irritated.</p>
<p>So much so that we&rsquo;ve started this podcast called I&rsquo;ve had it, you know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really curious, and Thompson, Jennifer, what what have you had it with with National</p>
<p>Days?</p>
<p>What what triggered you to reach out to me to have this conversation?</p>
<p>Ever since I&rsquo;ve been born, I&rsquo;ve known October, you have Halloween coming February, Valentine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Day coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m prepared.</p>
<p>I know these days, I know them consciously, subconsciously, even by the weather, you can</p>
<p>kind of tell, oh, it&rsquo;s getting kind of chilly about Halloween&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden, I&rsquo;m on the internet, and everybody&rsquo;s prepared with these, you know,</p>
<p>heart pouring National Son&rsquo;s Day, and it just comes out of left field and just slaps you</p>
<p>right in the face.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re the asshole on Instagram, that isn&rsquo;t celebrating your very own children</p>
<p>while all these power moms are out there with PowerPoint presentations, making people like</p>
<p>me, and especially her look like total piece of shit moms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what triggered the entire thing.</p>
<p>But I will say, I&rsquo;ve done an about face after interviewing you because the whole organization</p>
<p>and how y&rsquo;all do this, I think it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>And I like you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m envious of your job.</p>
<p>Now, I wish I had your job.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You see the bags under my eyes right now, right?</p>
<p>But but I have to admit, I have the greatest gig in the world.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And you can do it in your underwear if you want.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously not right now.</p>
<p>Sometimes, actually, my underwear on right now.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Pump&rsquo;s put on underwear today as well.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special day.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no broad day.</p>
<p>Good day, all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good day all around.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>Well, Marla, we cannot thank you enough for enlightening us and our audience about this</p>
<p>mystery because I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people know your story or where this came from.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s such a pleasant surprise that the way this is done and that any listener</p>
<p>out there, if there&rsquo;s a day you want, what is your website they can go to to submit their</p>
<p>own request for a national day?</p>
<p>Just the name of our organization, National Day Calendar dot com.</p>
<p>National Day.</p>
<p>National Day Calendar dot com.</p>
<p>You too, listener, can go out and have a day if if it passes Marla&rsquo;s committee.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m jockeying to be a member of.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to be picked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to get picked either.</p>
<p>But Marla, thank you so, so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, Marla.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming off your vacation.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>And happy.</p>
<p>I was on vacation.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I actually was working.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fun when you&rsquo;re working.</p>
<p>I actually started filming a new piece for the History Channel.</p>
<p>Oh, excellent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be a new series coming out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part of history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, before we leave, I just want to make sure I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t wish you</p>
<p>a happy National No Bra Day, Marla.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Go No Brars.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bye, Marla.</p>
<p>Bye, Marla.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Now I kind of feel bad that we were giving him shit before we met him because, as with</p>
<p>all things, once you meet the person, you find out you really like him.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so positive attitude.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have a cynical podcast called I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>So we can bitch about casseroles.</p>
<p>You can bitch about casseroles.</p>
<p>Audience, what we want you to do is go to our Instagram at I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>And please submit the date and what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to start our own national I&rsquo;ve Had It with whatever it is.</p>
<p>We could have our own committee.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We could be the committee.</p>
<p>We can be Marlo.</p>
<p>We can.</p>
<p>But just a little bit more cynical.</p>
<p>And open to bribery.</p>
<p>Which he is not.</p>
<p>A hundred percent open to bribery.</p>
<p>We might give you two days with a bribe.</p>
<p>If somebody called and said, I want you to have a, you know, national kiss a pig day.</p>
<p>Kiss a pig day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, that didn&rsquo;t pass committee.</p>
<p>And they say, here&rsquo;s $500.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, guess what?</p>
<p>Find me a pig.</p>
<p>June 4th.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Audience, thank you so much for tuning in today.</p>
<p>National No Bra Day.</p>
<p>And we wish you and your loved ones happy No Bra Day.</p>
<p>Happy free the nip, liberate the tit.</p>
<p>Do it all.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
