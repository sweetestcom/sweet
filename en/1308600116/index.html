    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode marks the first in a series</p>
<p>with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology</p>
<p>at Cal State University, Fullerton,</p>
<p>and one of the foremost world experts</p>
<p>on the science and application of methods</p>
<p>to increase strength, speed, endurance,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness,</p>
<p>exercise, and sports performance.</p>
<p>Across the six-episode series,</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise,</p>
<p>working with everything from professional athletes</p>
<p>to recreational exercisers,</p>
<p>and teaches us the mechanisms, logic,</p>
<p>and specific protocols for how to achieve</p>
<p>any of the number of different exercise adaptations</p>
<p>that I mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>ranging from strength to endurance,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, and everything in between.</p>
<p>We get really far into details,</p>
<p>but at all times, paying attention</p>
<p>to the macroscopic issues,</p>
<p>that is, how to create a program for endurance,</p>
<p>or strength, or hypertrophy, or speed,</p>
<p>or one that combines all of those.</p>
<p>We also talk about supplementation and nutrition</p>
<p>and how to maximize recovery</p>
<p>for each of the different types of exercise adaptations.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness,</p>
<p>and more generally, how to think about fitness</p>
<p>so that we can best achieve our fitness, exercise,</p>
<p>and performance goals.</p>
<p>Dr. Professor Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>super excited to have you here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such an immense treasure trove of information</p>
<p>on physical training and optimizing</p>
<p>for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, however,</p>
<p>so many people have different levels of fitness.</p>
<p>Some people are professional athletes, of course,</p>
<p>but most people are not.</p>
<p>Many people exercise regularly.</p>
<p>Some people are trying to do that more.</p>
<p>Some people are doing too much of that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re overtraining, they&rsquo;re not recovering enough.</p>
<p>If we were to take a step back</p>
<p>and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we?</p>
<p>With the word fit, of course,</p>
<p>being a very broad encompassing word,</p>
<p>you know, it could encompass endurance,</p>
<p>certainly it does, strength,</p>
<p>the ability to run fast, even if for short distances.</p>
<p>It might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy,</p>
<p>trying to balance one&rsquo;s musculature,</p>
<p>to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, et cetera.</p>
<p>How should I, or anyone else for that matter,</p>
<p>think about their level of fitness?</p>
<p>You know, I know my resting heart rate,</p>
<p>but what do I do in terms of really assessing</p>
<p>whether or not I&rsquo;m as fit as I could be and should be,</p>
<p>both for sake of health and performance?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m asking you the question, not as an athlete,</p>
<p>but as somebody who&rsquo;s been pretty consistent</p>
<p>as an exerciser, but if we were to throw our arms</p>
<p>around this question of how do we assess our fitness,</p>
<p>what would be sort of the different levels of assessment</p>
<p>that we should think about and do?</p>
<p>When it comes to exercise,</p>
<p>people generally have two major goals in mind.</p>
<p>Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance,</p>
<p>right, this is, I wanna be big or I wanna not be too big</p>
<p>or I wanna be lean, something, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what that goal is,</p>
<p>but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody.</p>
<p>They wanna look a certain way or not look a certain way.</p>
<p>The other one is functionality.</p>
<p>So I wanna be able to perform a certain way.</p>
<p>Now, again, that definition differs per person.</p>
<p>So I wanna be better at strength.</p>
<p>I wanna be better at mobility.</p>
<p>I wanna be able to have energy throughout the day,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sort of appeal to aesthetic</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some sort of appeal to functionality.</p>
<p>So within both of those categories,</p>
<p>we want to be in a position where we can understand</p>
<p>where do I need to go with my exercise training</p>
<p>so that I can be as fit and as healthy</p>
<p>and achieve these goals that I want now,</p>
<p>as well as be in a position where I can maintain them</p>
<p>for a long period of time.</p>
<p>So this blends both immediate goals.</p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re just interested in squatting a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re interested in running a 5K time the best you want.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It blends that with the ability,</p>
<p>the desire to have a long wellness span,</p>
<p>to be fit throughout life,</p>
<p>to achieve all those things for as long as possible.</p>
<p>So then the question kind of comes back to saying,</p>
<p>how do I know which area I need to focus on the most</p>
<p>and why am I not achieving these goals</p>
<p>or how can I get there more effectively?</p>
<p>And if we look at the big picture,</p>
<p>we have to understand that there are several major components</p>
<p>to physical fitness that are going to be required</p>
<p>in all of these categories.</p>
<p>And to achieve that, there are a handful of components</p>
<p>that have to happen to be able to hit those goals.</p>
<p>Now there are infinite methods.</p>
<p>So the saying we actually use here a lot is,</p>
<p>the methods are many, but the concepts are few.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d love to do today is,</p>
<p>over the course of our discussion,</p>
<p>is hit exactly what those concepts are</p>
<p>and then cover a whole bunch of different methods.</p>
<p>And we could do that for hours,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll cover a number of them for various goals.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience</p>
<p>and not into exercise science</p>
<p>is because of this thing, neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to adapt.</p>
<p>But the more time I spend with you</p>
<p>and the more I learn from you,</p>
<p>I realized that many, if not all of the organ systems</p>
<p>of our body have this incredible ability to adapt.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re talking about physical exercise,</p>
<p>there are incredible adaptations</p>
<p>that of course involve the nervous system,</p>
<p>but also involve muscle and connective tissue</p>
<p>and so many other cell types and tissues.</p>
<p>That said, when we talk about fitness,</p>
<p>what are the major types of adaptations</p>
<p>that underlie this thing that we call fitness?</p>
<p>And later, I know we&rsquo;re gonna get into</p>
<p>how different forms of exercise</p>
<p>can trigger different types of adaptations,</p>
<p>but what are the major adaptations</p>
<p>that one can create in their body using exercise?</p>
<p>There are many reasons why one should exercise,</p>
<p>and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats,</p>
<p>but the physiological adaptations</p>
<p>can be bucketed really into nine areas.</p>
<p>So the very first one is what I call skill or technique.</p>
<p>So just learning to move better, more efficiently,</p>
<p>with a specific position and timing and sequence</p>
<p>or whatever that is.</p>
<p>This could be running more effectively.</p>
<p>This could be practicing a skill</p>
<p>like shooting a ball or an implement,</p>
<p>swinging a golf club, anything like that.</p>
<p>I call that skill development.</p>
<p>The second one is speed.</p>
<p>This is simply moving at a higher velocity</p>
<p>or with a better rate of acceleration.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very similar to the next one, which is power,</p>
<p>and power is speed multiplied by force.</p>
<p>The next one then, of course, on top of that</p>
<p>is force or strength.</p>
<p>Those are really synonymous terms, right?</p>
<p>How effectively can you move something?</p>
<p>Now, this is often confused, strength rather,</p>
<p>as muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the maximum thing you can move</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the maximum amount of force</p>
<p>you can produce one time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how many repetitions in a row you can do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually another one of our adaptations</p>
<p>called muscular endurance, all right?</p>
<p>So that is typically under the order of like,</p>
<p>say five to 25, maybe 50 repetitions.</p>
<p>Think of a classic, how many pushups can you do in a row?</p>
<p>How many sit-ups can you do in a minute?</p>
<p>Like things like that are muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance tends to be localized.</p>
<p>So this is specific to just say your triceps</p>
<p>and your deltoids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s strength, number four.</p>
<p>Number five is muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And this is the first time now we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>an appearance rather than a functional outcome.</p>
<p>So, you know, moving better, moving faster,</p>
<p>moving heavier are indicators of how well you can move.</p>
<p>This is the first one that&rsquo;s just simply</p>
<p>how big is your muscle</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s muscle hypertrophy or muscle size.</p>
<p>After that is muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So this is how many repetitions</p>
<p>you can typically do of a movement.</p>
<p>So think of how many pushups in a row you can do,</p>
<p>how many sit-ups in a minute you can do,</p>
<p>things that are typically in like five to 50 repetition</p>
<p>sort of range.</p>
<p>And it is often, or it is almost always local muscle.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is it is a pushup test</p>
<p>is really how many reps that your triceps</p>
<p>and pecs and deltoids can do.</p>
<p>It is not a cardiovascular endurance.</p>
<p>It is not a global physiological endurance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s specific to typically one</p>
<p>or a few muscle groups at a time.</p>
<p>This is why you have to do multiple tests</p>
<p>for sort of every group there.</p>
<p>After that, now we&rsquo;ve moved into number seven,</p>
<p>which is what I call anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re actually looking at</p>
<p>rather than a single movement or muscle group,</p>
<p>it is a total physiological limitation.</p>
<p>So it is the maximum amount of work you can do</p>
<p>in say 30 to 45 seconds,</p>
<p>maybe even up to 120 seconds of all-out work.</p>
<p>Think of your classic interval type of stuff here.</p>
<p>So how much work can you do at a maximum rate</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna enter tremendous amounts</p>
<p>of global fatigue?</p>
<p>The next past that is maximal aerobic capacity.</p>
<p>And this is probably something like</p>
<p>in the eight to 15 minute range</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to reach probably both</p>
<p>a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO2 max,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk a lot more about what that is later.</p>
<p>So that is different from the previous one</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t reach this in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>It simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position</p>
<p>to where your VO2 max is actually going</p>
<p>to be sufficiently challenged or an indicator there.</p>
<p>And then the last one, number nine</p>
<p>is what I call long duration.</p>
<p>And this is just your ability to sustain submaximal work</p>
<p>for a long period of time with no breaks,</p>
<p>no reduction whatsoever.</p>
<p>This is often called steady state training</p>
<p>or a lot of people just think of this</p>
<p>when they think of quote unquote cardio,</p>
<p>but your ability to continue movement</p>
<p>without any breaks or change or drop</p>
<p>is the last and final adaptation.</p>
<p>And for long distance steady state,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it exceeds 15 minutes</p>
<p>because the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>What sort of rate time ranges are we talking about</p>
<p>in terms of this long duration?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually wonderful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be anything past 15 minutes.</p>
<p>So really, if you look at a kind of a minimal number there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generally 20 minutes of what we&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>but anything past that would still be limited</p>
<p>by your long duration endurance.</p>
<p>So your ability to sustain work over time.</p>
<p>Okay, so given that there are nine</p>
<p>different major adaptations that can be induced</p>
<p>with exercise of specific types,</p>
<p>is there any one global test or assessment</p>
<p>that people can take or do that allows them</p>
<p>to determine what level of ability of fitness</p>
<p>they have in each and every one</p>
<p>of these nine different categories?</p>
<p>There are probably dozens or more tests</p>
<p>that you can do for each one of those nine categories.</p>
<p>And what I would actually like to do</p>
<p>is walk you through my favorites for each</p>
<p>and giving you both the scientific gold standards.</p>
<p>So if you had the ability, unlimited resources,</p>
<p>what should you go do?</p>
<p>As well as some that are equipment free,</p>
<p>that are cost-free,</p>
<p>things that anyone can do across the world.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I want to walk you through</p>
<p>what those numbers should be,</p>
<p>how do you identify if you&rsquo;re really poor in something</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re great, and then if you aren&rsquo;t as good,</p>
<p>maybe in a category and you want to get better at it,</p>
<p>exactly what to do in terms of protocols</p>
<p>for how to achieve optimal results in each of those steps.</p>
<p>So I noticed in your list</p>
<p>of the nine different adaptations to exercise</p>
<p>that you did not mention fat loss</p>
<p>or health promoting benefits,</p>
<p>which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise.</p>
<p>Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those?</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s because those things</p>
<p>are actually not specific training styles.</p>
<p>They are byproducts of these nine.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is if you understand</p>
<p>how fat loss occurs, which we can certainly talk about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll realize some of these nine protocols</p>
<p>are effective for fat loss and some are not.</p>
<p>General health is the same thing.</p>
<p>When we understand what it actually means to be healthy</p>
<p>from a physiological perspective,</p>
<p>then the rationale for what to train for</p>
<p>is going to determine itself.</p>
<p>So what I mean is looking at things like</p>
<p>in order to be healthy,</p>
<p>you have to have sufficient strength,</p>
<p>you have to have cardiovascular fitness,</p>
<p>you have to have sufficient muscle and et cetera.</p>
<p>Therefore, training for one&rsquo;s health</p>
<p>is determined by those restrictions.</p>
<p>So for you, Andrew,</p>
<p>you may need to do more strength training to be healthy.</p>
<p>Where me, because I&rsquo;m strong already,</p>
<p>way stronger than you,</p>
<p>I may not need to do as much strength training.</p>
<p>So our quote unquote health-based protocols</p>
<p>are based on our current status or limitations</p>
<p>in physical fitness among these nine areas.</p>
<p>So what I would like to do today</p>
<p>is to cover a brief history of exercise science.</p>
<p>And the reason is it&rsquo;s going to explain a lot</p>
<p>about why people are not getting the goals</p>
<p>in their exercise programs that they want,</p>
<p>as well as give you very specific direction</p>
<p>about what to do instead.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to hear all the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing incorrectly</p>
<p>and to have you help me remedy that.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Galpin&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.</p>
<p>And this is of course important because we realized</p>
<p>that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners</p>
<p>reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements</p>
<p>mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>in particular supplements for hormone health,</p>
<p>for sleep optimization, for focus,</p>
<p>as well as a number of other things,</p>
<p>including exercise recovery,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that contains the exact ratios of the electrolytes,</p>
<p>sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>to optimize cellular functioning</p>
<p>for mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Most people realize that hydration is key.</p>
<p>We need to ingest enough fluids</p>
<p>in order to feel our best and perform our best.</p>
<p>But what most people do not realize</p>
<p>is that the proper functioning of our cells</p>
<p>and nerve cells, neurons in particular,</p>
<p>requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>be present in the correct ratios.</p>
<p>Now, of course, people with prehypertension</p>
<p>and hypertension need to be careful</p>
<p>about their sodium intake.</p>
<p>But what a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you&rsquo;re following a very clean diet,</p>
<p>that is not a lot of processed foods,</p>
<p>which of course is a good thing,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re not getting enough sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium</p>
<p>to optimize mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for about the last eight months,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping about the same amount,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sleeping far deeper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now getting the proper ratios</p>
<p>of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,</p>
<p>and slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>and waking up feeling far more recovered</p>
<p>mentally and physically.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism for all that</p>
<p>is very straightforward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere</p>
<p>about the critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in terms of core body temperature,</p>
<p>and waking up involves a one to three degree increase</p>
<p>in core body temperature.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep mattress covers,</p>
<p>you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment</p>
<p>to be one temperature at the start of the night,</p>
<p>a different temperature the middle of the night,</p>
<p>and a different temperature as you approach morning,</p>
<p>each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep</p>
<p>and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.</p>

<p>Before we get into how the history of exercise science</p>
<p>informs the mistakes that we are all making</p>
<p>and how to remedy those mistakes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to whether or not</p>
<p>you have any favorite one or two studies</p>
<p>that point to a sort of naturally occurring example</p>
<p>of how people can become very fit in one area</p>
<p>and not another.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m familiar with seeing endurance athletes</p>
<p>that apparently have terrific endurance,</p>
<p>but at least to my eye,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look like they are particularly strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also familiar with seeing individuals</p>
<p>that are very, very strong, particularly on social media,</p>
<p>but that don&rsquo;t look like they could walk up</p>
<p>a flight of stairs, much less run a mile.</p>
<p>Do you have any examples of studies</p>
<p>in or outside the laboratory</p>
<p>that point to that in a concrete way?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to have to discuss here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll answer it really clear.</p>
<p>If you look across the literature,</p>
<p>and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s.</p>
<p>In fact, it actually goes back to previous to that,</p>
<p>to the Harvard Fatigue Lab, 1927 to 1947 area.</p>
<p>People actually were advocating at that point</p>
<p>a combination of strength training and endurance.</p>
<p>In the 1920s.</p>
<p>Way back then.</p>
<p>In fact, it actually goes prior to that in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s scientific evidence back then.</p>
<p>It became more well-developed</p>
<p>in the mid 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>In fact, there was the initial stages</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the exercises medicine movement,</p>
<p>which is the movement now,</p>
<p>but the initial stages of that</p>
<p>actually root back to the 1950s.</p>
<p>I could actually go into that whole discussion</p>
<p>and the story of how that all came about,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the health is wealth mantra</p>
<p>that came from the 1950s,</p>
<p>from the scientific community then.</p>
<p>All those data points are going to suggest</p>
<p>you need a combination of some sort of broad strength</p>
<p>training and broad endurance.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a specific goal five months from now,</p>
<p>you want to compete in a race</p>
<p>or hit a certain physique thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine to focus on one area of training.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&rsquo;re an athlete, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>But if you want to maximize health</p>
<p>and overall functionality throughout time,</p>
<p>it needs to be a combination.</p>
<p>And to really, really highlight this,</p>
<p>I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>So I did this at the Karolinska Institute,</p>
<p>which you probably are aware of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the founding places</p>
<p>of all of exercise physiology.</p>
<p>Generally it started there.</p>
<p>It was called something different back then,</p>
<p>but really our entire field came out of Stockholm</p>
<p>and the Karolinska Institute.</p>
<p>And we worked with a whole bunch of cross-country skiers</p>
<p>that were in their 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>And so they were competitive skiers in the 1940s and 50s,</p>
<p>and they had been skiing competitively</p>
<p>for that entire duration.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing.</p>
<p>So these are 80 to 90 year olds living alone and healthy.</p>
<p>And we compared them to a group of individuals</p>
<p>here in America who are the same age,</p>
<p>but were not exercising.</p>
<p>And what we wanted to do is to see and kind of look at</p>
<p>what are these lifelong endurance individuals?</p>
<p>What do they look like?</p>
<p>When we brought them into the lab,</p>
<p>which is by the way, amazing,</p>
<p>to do a VO2 max test on a 92 year old,</p>
<p>especially in a language that they don&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in a, you can imagine you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>in the hospital, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re running people through, this is a cycling test.</p>
<p>And so for a VO2 max test, you have a mask on your face,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hooked up to a metabolic cart,</p>
<p>so we can collect all the gases</p>
<p>that are coming out of your mouth.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re chanting these people on,</p>
<p>and basically every minute,</p>
<p>the workload gets harder and harder and harder</p>
<p>until you can&rsquo;t complete it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing this in a cardiology center,</p>
<p>and the cardiologists are usually waiting</p>
<p>for their heart rate to get like slightly elevated</p>
<p>and they stop them because they&rsquo;re 85, 86 years old.</p>
<p>And not only are we not stopping them,</p>
<p>but we are screaming in their ears,</p>
<p>just like, go, go, go.</p>
<p>And Swedish or English?</p>
<p>In English, right?</p>
<p>And then the translator,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of translation</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s screaming at your face, like, go, go, go.</p>
<p>So we ran them through a whole bunch of VO2 max tests</p>
<p>and we did the same thing for those folks back</p>
<p>here in America.</p>
<p>And what was incredibly clear from that study</p>
<p>was the VO2 max, you can think about these numbers</p>
<p>and this is what&rsquo;s called relative.</p>
<p>So in the relative terms</p>
<p>are milliliters per kilogram per minute.</p>
<p>And so a standard number is about 18</p>
<p>is what we call the line of independence.</p>
<p>So if your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters</p>
<p>per kilogram per minute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for you to live by yourself.</p>
<p>So your fitness is so low,</p>
<p>you probably are going to need to have somebody living</p>
<p>with you or you&rsquo;ll need to be in some sort</p>
<p>of assisted living home.</p>
<p>So if you are in like VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not below that line of independence,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re on that threshold.</p>
<p>And so what we found was our folks here in America,</p>
<p>the group average was right around that number.</p>
<p>So they were living at home by definition,</p>
<p>we picked them to be people living by themselves</p>
<p>in their eighties and not in a living room,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t have any bandwidth.</p>
<p>So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up</p>
<p>where they lost a little bit of fitness,</p>
<p>they were gonna drop below that line</p>
<p>and would probably have to go to some sort</p>
<p>of assisted living situation.</p>
<p>The folks in Stockholm, the cross-country skiers,</p>
<p>the group average was most closer to like 35 to 38</p>
<p>milliliters per kilogram per minute.</p>
<p>Now that number is about the VO2 max you would find</p>
<p>for a normal college male.</p>
<p>And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90,</p>
<p>if the, you know, the joke, if a saber tooth tiger ran</p>
<p>in the room or whatever, and it chased it down</p>
<p>and we all had to run to see who didn&rsquo;t get eaten alive,</p>
<p>the college men would probably have gotten eaten</p>
<p>before the 90 year olds.</p>
<p>And in one case we had a 92 year old individual</p>
<p>and I think his VO2 max was 38,</p>
<p>which was in our estimation, a world record,</p>
<p>the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90.</p>
<p>May I ask, what is the typical resting heart rate</p>
<p>for somebody very fit like these older Swedish</p>
<p>cross-country skiers?</p>
<p>If somebody has this, let&rsquo;s say their number</p>
<p>is 35 milliliters per kilogram in this VO2 max test,</p>
<p>but since most of us don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to that kind of equipment,</p>
<p>but that we can measure our pulse rate.</p>
<p>What was a typical resting heart rate,</p>
<p>resting pulse rate?</p>
<p>Sub 60.</p>
<p>Sub 60.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, typically that&rsquo;s a good number to go off</p>
<p>of for anybody, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Anytime I see somebody above that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start asking questions.</p>
<p>Certainly above, you know, you&rsquo;ll see in the literature,</p>
<p>people will say 60 to 80 is normal.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t agree with that at all.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re up, if you&rsquo;re resting heart rate</p>
<p>is 75 beats per minute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s either something going on or you&rsquo;re not fit.</p>
<p>How much cross-country skiing were they doing on average</p>
<p>in the previous, let&rsquo;s say, if we take</p>
<p>the previous 20 years,</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;d been long-time cross-country skiers,</p>
<p>divide that by 20 years.</p>
<p>On average, are these people cross-country skiing</p>
<p>five hours a day, two hours a day, an hour a day?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been many years,</p>
<p>but they were not doing it every single day</p>
<p>and the volume would not have shocked you.</p>
<p>It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there.</p>
<p>Now, obviously these people were, again, world champions</p>
<p>and Olympic gold medalists in the 1940s and 50s.</p>
<p>So they were elite.</p>
<p>They just continued consistently over time.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a shocking amount of physical fitness.</p>
<p>They also didn&rsquo;t go out of their way to train hard.</p>
<p>They were busy chopping wood.</p>
<p>They were busy doing a number of other things.</p>
<p>And then they just happened to do some of these races</p>
<p>and ski a long way.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a crazy amount to where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s great, but I could never hit that number.</p>
<p>It was something much more reasonable.</p>
<p>So is the takeaway to be consistent</p>
<p>about getting cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>and we can define what consistent means</p>
<p>in terms of days per week a little bit later.</p>
<p>And I know we will.</p>
<p>What are some other examples?</p>
<p>I love these examples from the real world.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the downside though.</p>
<p>So I only told you about their VO2 max.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t tell you about</p>
<p>is their leg strength and functionality.</p>
<p>And that part was no more superior</p>
<p>than it was their counterparts who were not exercisers.</p>
<p>So what that showed really, really clearly</p>
<p>and many other studies have been done since then</p>
<p>that look at the classical,</p>
<p>what we call lifelong endurance exercisers.</p>
<p>You will see in general, their VO2 max,</p>
<p>their cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>their resting heart rate, their blood pressure.</p>
<p>It will be markedly healthier</p>
<p>than folks who don&rsquo;t exercise.</p>
<p>It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise</p>
<p>is very important for chronic disease management.</p>
<p>No doubt about it.</p>
<p>However, it is not sufficient for overall global health</p>
<p>because it does almost nothing for leg strength</p>
<p>for any other marker of health</p>
<p>which we can talk about what are the things</p>
<p>that are actually going to predict mortality</p>
<p>more verbatim than most.</p>
<p>So that was a big smashing indication</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, hey, this is great.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re leaving things on the table</p>
<p>for your overall health.</p>
<p>Now one could argue they&rsquo;re 80</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re doing pretty well,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t doing as well in these areas.</p>
<p>And so a study we did later actually as a follow-up</p>
<p>was looking at monozygous twins.</p>
<p>So this is actually interesting being a scientist.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of one of my graduate students</p>
<p>who had been in my lab for probably three or four years.</p>
<p>And she was in our single fiber physiology lab.</p>
<p>And you imagine she&rsquo;s isolating individual muscle fibers</p>
<p>from an athlete one by one with the tweezer.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s going to do several thousand individual cells.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re down there for hours</p>
<p>and things happen down there.</p>
<p>You kind of lose your mind.</p>
<p>And she was just kind of going on one day</p>
<p>with one of my colleagues just talking.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, my uncle,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really, really fit and something or other.</p>
<p>And then, oh yeah, he&rsquo;s a twin.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh, is he a monozygous?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, monozygous are identical twins.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is interesting.</p>
<p>So you basically have, what I&rsquo;m setting up here</p>
<p>is this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment.</p>
<p>Monozygous identical twins mean</p>
<p>they have the exact same DNA.</p>
<p>So an egg was fertilized, split,</p>
<p>and then two humans grew out of that</p>
<p>with the exact same DNA.</p>
<p>And so now we can start answering the question,</p>
<p>well, yeah, okay,</p>
<p>what about maybe these cross-country skiers?</p>
<p>Maybe they were just genetic freaks.</p>
<p>Maybe it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some people have,</p>
<p>well, genetics are always a component to it, but how much?</p>
<p>Well, now we have a scenario lining up</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>you have monozygous twins.</p>
<p>So we have a replica of a human being, exact same DNA.</p>
<p>The only differences that we would see</p>
<p>in their physiology now</p>
<p>would be due to lifestyle circumstances.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So monozygous twin, dad and uncle, right?</p>
<p>Great, do they exercise?</p>
<p>Well, one of them does.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lifelong endurance exercise,</p>
<p>runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman, all these things.</p>
<p>What about the other one?</p>
<p>Nope, he doesn&rsquo;t exercise at all.</p>
<p>And at that point, like I wanted to kill my graduate student</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;ve been in my lab for three years</p>
<p>or more probably,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve never told me that in your household</p>
<p>is the perfect scientific experiment</p>
<p>for exercise you could ever create.</p>
<p>And like Jesus, the look on her face</p>
<p>when my colleague and I were staring at her,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just like, oh my God.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, call them right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming in the lab and fly them in from Chicago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what we have to do, like we&rsquo;re getting them in.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to actually going back to the model</p>
<p>that was first developed by the Harvard Fatigue Lab.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s interesting about that community</p>
<p>is they started off with the concept</p>
<p>of trying to examine human performance</p>
<p>through a holistic lens.</p>
<p>And so it was the antithesis of looking at</p>
<p>either organ by organ.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to only look at the cardiovascular system</p>
<p>or only going to look at skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at this entire picture.</p>
<p>And so that model we wanted to carry through</p>
<p>when these twins and I said, all right,</p>
<p>I want to bring them in the lab,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not just going to look at one system.</p>
<p>I want to do everything.</p>
<p>So we took stool samples, we took blood,</p>
<p>we did vertical jump tests, we did maximum strength tests,</p>
<p>we did MRIs of muscle mass, we did VO2 max tests,</p>
<p>we did efficiency stuff, we did genetic testing,</p>
<p>we did an IQ test, we did psychological battery.</p>
<p>We wanted to look at everything to figure out</p>
<p>of these things, what differ between the twins</p>
<p>and if so, the second key question there is by how much?</p>
<p>So can I improve my VO2 max?</p>
<p>Sure, everyone knows that, but how much?</p>
<p>Can it change by 5%, 80%?</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;s the number?</p>
<p>And so putting some quantification on this</p>
<p>was very important.</p>
<p>And so again, we had another example</p>
<p>of a classic endurance only training paradigm</p>
<p>compared to a non X.</p>
<p>So this is a person who&rsquo;s, I think he&rsquo;s a truck driver</p>
<p>by vocation, which is, I think he actually drove</p>
<p>for a potato chip company, which was even funnier.</p>
<p>The endurance actually was great</p>
<p>because like any endurance people,</p>
<p>he had physical books of all of his training mileage</p>
<p>for the last 35 years.</p>
<p>And we just went through them</p>
<p>and we calculated the total amount of miles he ran,</p>
<p>his averages, his heart rates per time.</p>
<p>We had this unbelievable thing, like what races he was in,</p>
<p>he had the documentation, it was just totally nuts, right?</p>
<p>Like something that endurance people</p>
<p>are like shaking their head right now going,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I got that too.</p>
<p>And everyone else is saying-</p>
<p>These folks are pretty nerdy.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re super nerdy, right?</p>
<p>So it was great because now we could validate</p>
<p>as close as one could to actually how much you ran</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So they had about a 35 year discord.</p>
<p>They both exercised up through high school, about 18,</p>
<p>they stopped doing it.</p>
<p>And by the time they brought them in the lab,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in their mid fifties.</p>
<p>So it was about 35 years of difference.</p>
<p>And when we ran them through the testing,</p>
<p>if you look at the measures that were similar</p>
<p>to the Sweden study, it was almost identical.</p>
<p>The exercising twin was significantly better</p>
<p>at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate,</p>
<p>blood pressure, VO2 max.</p>
<p>Any of those markers as predicted were much better.</p>
<p>What was very interesting though,</p>
<p>was the things that were in the middle.</p>
<p>First of all, their total amount of muscle mass</p>
<p>was almost identical, like to the gram</p>
<p>within the margin of error of a DEXA scan</p>
<p>could possibly ever be.</p>
<p>The non-exerciser though, was a little bit fatter.</p>
<p>So the difference in actual body weight</p>
<p>was explained almost entirely by body fat</p>
<p>or non-lean tissue really, same sort of deal.</p>
<p>So, okay, like no one&rsquo;s surprised there</p>
<p>that the exerciser was a little bit leaner,</p>
<p>even though it didn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>the total amount of muscle mass at all.</p>
<p>When we looked at some of the more functional tests</p>
<p>and we looked at things like muscle quality.</p>
<p>So this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound.</p>
<p>You can kind of think about this as</p>
<p>how much fat is inside the tissue,</p>
<p>which is sometimes an advantage for endurance athlete</p>
<p>to have a little bit more</p>
<p>of what are called intramuscular triglycerides</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a fuel directly in the tissue.</p>
<p>But in general, the exercise or the muscle quality</p>
<p>was not in favor of the exerciser.</p>
<p>If you looked at the performance testing</p>
<p>and if you looked at strength,</p>
<p>it favored the non-exerciser.</p>
<p>And so now again, we have the same finding we saw</p>
<p>in our Sweden study, but in identical twins.</p>
<p>And so it really, really highlighted the fact that</p>
<p>if you want to move forward with optimal health,</p>
<p>simply picking one silo is not gonna get you there.</p>
<p>One silo meaning just running, just cycling.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise</p>
<p>could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition?</p>
<p>Not that that&rsquo;s a vital thing to be able to do,</p>
<p>but just in terms of measuring strength,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s our isometric strength.</p>
<p>Was the non-exercising twin stronger,</p>
<p>at least as strong as their exercising?</p>
<p>Yes, particularly in grip strength.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And any of the measures like the vertical jump,</p>
<p>leg extension power, and a number of things,</p>
<p>they often favored the non-exerciser,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re still a little bit of a chicken and egg.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if necessarily the endurance training reduced</p>
<p>that other twins strength,</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t even really matter per se.</p>
<p>I think the highlight of it is,</p>
<p>can you change some of these metrics of the Ultimax?</p>
<p>Yeah, not even close.</p>
<p>These things are very responsive</p>
<p>regardless of your genetics.</p>
<p>Your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly.</p>
<p>Even the non-exerciser was a pretty healthy guy.</p>
<p>So they were in a good spot.</p>
<p>In mid fifties, doesn&rsquo;t exercise,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really pay attention to his diet at all.</p>
<p>And he was in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>However, if you wanna actually move progress</p>
<p>and move for high functionality,</p>
<p>you have to do something besides just run, right?</p>
<p>Just distance run.</p>
<p>Now I could say the same thing for strength training.</p>
<p>That alone,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna make this seem</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m saying endurance exercises, it worked.</p>
<p>In both case, in both these studies,</p>
<p>those folks were much better off in metrics</p>
<p>that are incredibly important to mortality.</p>
<p>How long you&rsquo;re going to live, VO2 max, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not gonna get there in terms of strength.</p>
<p>We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well,</p>
<p>which is very interesting.</p>
<p>So what I mean is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s generally two types of muscle fibers,</p>
<p>fast twitch and slow twitch.</p>
<p>And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging</p>
<p>is a selective reduction in fast twitch fibers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s difficult to activate them</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing high force activities.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna activate slow twitch fibers</p>
<p>doing almost any activity of daily living.</p>
<p>And so they stay around.</p>
<p>Fast twitch fibers,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing something of high force</p>
<p>are going not be used</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna be kept around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem because when you look at things</p>
<p>like the need for leg strength through aging,</p>
<p>the ability to catch yourself from a fall,</p>
<p>these things are incredibly important.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have fast twitch fibers,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the speed</p>
<p>to get your foot out in front of you on time</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have the eccentric strength</p>
<p>to stop the fall from happening.</p>
<p>And so if you look across again, the aging literature,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very clear about the importance</p>
<p>of maintaining strength and fast twitch fibers over time.</p>
<p>So we know that this is an important distinction</p>
<p>here overall.</p>
<p>And people will often talk about,</p>
<p>okay, how much of that is genetically determined?</p>
<p>Can I change my fiber type?</p>
<p>And the answer there is resoundingly yes.</p>
<p>And can I change it with exercise?</p>
<p>And the answer is absolutely you can.</p>
<p>And then the next question is how much?</p>
<p>So now again, we&rsquo;re gonna see an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>In general, without going too far down an area</p>
<p>that maybe we can save for later,</p>
<p>each one of your muscles in your body</p>
<p>has a different percentage of fast twitch and slow twitch.</p>
<p>For example, your calf.</p>
<p>If you look at your soleus,</p>
<p>which is kind of the smaller one that goes in the back,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generally mostly slow twitch.</p>
<p>Typically 80% or so slow twitch.</p>
<p>The gastroc, which is the other one right next to it.</p>
<p>So if you were to point your toe next to your face</p>
<p>and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle,</p>
<p>pops out, that&rsquo;s your gastroc.</p>
<p>That is almost the inverse.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s generally 80% fast twitch, maybe 20% slow twitch.</p>
<p>Generally anything antipostural or postural rather,</p>
<p>anti-gravity, spinal erectors,</p>
<p>things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day</p>
<p>are going to be slow twitch.</p>
<p>And things like your hamstrings,</p>
<p>which are for explosion are going to be fast twitch.</p>
<p>Well, we biopsied the quad in these individuals.</p>
<p>And in that muscle, it&rsquo;s generally about 50-50,</p>
<p>fast twitch, slow twitch, as a really broad number.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that we found</p>
<p>was in the non-exerciser,</p>
<p>it was almost textbook what you would predict.</p>
<p>It was about 50% or so slow twitch,</p>
<p>a little bit of percentage of fast twitch,</p>
<p>and then about 20% of what are these called hybrid fibers,</p>
<p>which are a hallmark of that activity.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>In the exerciser, it was about 95% slow twitch.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s extremely clear.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t know if maybe their set point</p>
<p>was a little bit higher towards that</p>
<p>and the non-exerciser devolved down to his place</p>
<p>or the other one, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going from 40% slow twitch in one case</p>
<p>to 95% slow twitch in another case.</p>
<p>It shows you that the limits of physiological adaptation</p>
<p>are darn near boundless given enough exposure.</p>
<p>And in this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training</p>
<p>and his muscle morphology was completely different</p>
<p>than his identical twin with the exact same DNA.</p>
<p>Those are two beautiful examples</p>
<p>of people doing endurance work for a number of years</p>
<p>and what that gives them in terms of benefits</p>
<p>and functionality.</p>
<p>Has the opposite experiment been done or observed</p>
<p>where somebody just weight lifted</p>
<p>or just sprinted for a number of years?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a identical twin control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little-</p>
<p>I wish we had a third twin.</p>
<p>Too much to ask for, right?</p>
<p>Triplets.</p>
<p>Okay, so triplets out there,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re exercising in different ways</p>
<p>or people who have triplets,</p>
<p>maybe you assign one kid to be a runner,</p>
<p>one kid to be a weightlifter</p>
<p>and the other one to be sedentary.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do experiments like that.</p>
<p>But the expectation, as I understand it,</p>
<p>would be that the person that sprints</p>
<p>or that does heavy squats, explosive work,</p>
<p>would then have more fast-tritch muscle fibers in their quad</p>
<p>and their non-exercising counterpart would have fewer.</p>
<p>That would make sense.</p>
<p>But what happens if you assess the endurance level</p>
<p>in somebody who&rsquo;s just done strength training</p>
<p>or just sprinted?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we don&rsquo;t have those data specifically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually just starting to have studies come out</p>
<p>on lifelong strength trainers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a very good reason for this,</p>
<p>which is a whole story we can get into.</p>
<p>But the quick answer is,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a lot of people who&rsquo;ve been lifting weights</p>
<p>for 30 plus years.</p>
<p>We have a whole swath of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been doing endurance training for that long.</p>
<p>Is that because fewer people have been weight training</p>
<p>or are the weight trainers all dead?</p>
<p>You got to go back to the 1953, 1954.</p>
<p>You had two major things happen</p>
<p>that changed the entire course of exercise physiology</p>
<p>and exercise science</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way we do the exercise as we know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the history of our field.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions</p>
<p>of what exercise can and can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>As an example, questions like momentum.</p>
<p>Should I use momentum or that&rsquo;s cheating, right?</p>
<p>Or it doesn&rsquo;t work, it compromises my results.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually totally untrue.</p>
<p>There are excellent reasons when you should use momentum</p>
<p>when you lift.</p>
<p>There are reasons when you should not.</p>
<p>It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast</p>
<p>with the exercise repetition,</p>
<p>sometimes very slow and controlled is better.</p>
<p>Any question I get, in fact, I&rsquo;m very infamous</p>
<p>for always responding with, it depends.</p>
<p>The reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re training for speed or power</p>
<p>or muscular endurance,</p>
<p>the answer to some of these very common question differs.</p>
<p>What people fail to realize</p>
<p>is they think they&rsquo;re asking the right question</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t understand this history,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s being planted in your brain subconsciously</p>
<p>is driving that question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessarily the right one.</p>
<p>So if we walk through that a little bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see what that field has led you,</p>
<p>why you think certain things matter</p>
<p>when they actually don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or maybe your assumptions are incorrect,</p>
<p>and then exactly what to do about them.</p>

<p>So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister</p>
<p>breaking the four minute mile, so sub four minute file.</p>
<p>And then you also had Sir Edmund Hillary</p>
<p>and then his Sherpa Norgay summit Everest</p>
<p>in the same basically two year span.</p>
<p>That exact same year after that was a formation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the American College of Sports Medicine.</p>
<p>Now that is still around today.</p>
<p>It is a preeminent group for this exercise as medicine.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in things like exercise</p>
<p>for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment,</p>
<p>for things like that, it&rsquo;s not really sports medicine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more for clinical exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the place to go,</p>
<p>American College of Sports Medicine.</p>
<p>So we have this launching of both a ton of people</p>
<p>wanting to start doing endurance exercise</p>
<p>and start swimming and cycling and running.</p>
<p>And then you have a launch of people</p>
<p>coming off of the back of the Harvard Fatigue Lab.</p>
<p>So the Fatigue Lab actually shut down in 1947.</p>
<p>So you have these people interested in physical fitness,</p>
<p>but nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Well, all those people left the Harvard Fatigue Lab</p>
<p>and started their own labs and other places.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve launched the careers of people like Dave Kostal</p>
<p>and John Halasi</p>
<p>and some of these very famous exercise physiologists.</p>
<p>And they start building laboratories.</p>
<p>And we start for the first time ever</p>
<p>studying the science of exercise.</p>
<p>So years go by and these people happen.</p>
<p>The 1960s and 1970s is what we call the runner&rsquo;s boom.</p>
<p>So people start, if you in fact,</p>
<p>if you look at the numbers of people</p>
<p>who are doing marathons,</p>
<p>it explodes through these two decades spans, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like the, we could do these endurance feats.</p>
<p>Notice both those feats were endurance, right?</p>
<p>Running short-term as well as going over there.</p>
<p>No one has thought anything about strength training.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>In the late 1880s, there was a very famous physician</p>
<p>George Winship, I think was his name,</p>
<p>who was a big proponent of strength training.</p>
<p>Well, he died in like in the age of 50 something</p>
<p>of a heart attack.</p>
<p>And that terrified people of strength training for 70 years</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, whoa, that stuff will kill you.</p>
<p>Because he was a doctor.</p>
<p>He was running around the country,</p>
<p>doing these exhibitions and reporting it.</p>
<p>And then he died.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like Atkins.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Dying.</p>
<p>Some people say he died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Other people said he fell through the ice</p>
<p>into cold water that&rsquo;s debated.</p>
<p>But the fact that a heavy proponent</p>
<p>of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly,</p>
<p>not good for business.</p>
<p>So now the little storm is brewing.</p>
<p>1940s, and I&rsquo;m going back a little bit,</p>
<p>but bear with me for a second.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Peter Karpovich</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a scientist out of Springfield,</p>
<p>like the Decorative Physical Education, PE.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a legendary place, Springfield College.</p>
<p>And he is anti-strength training</p>
<p>for a lot of the same reasons.</p>
<p>And his entire career talked about no to this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one that launched these ideas</p>
<p>that strength training will make you lose flexibility.</p>
<p>It will be bad for kids.</p>
<p>Like all of these things that we know now</p>
<p>are clearly not true.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a proponent of these things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a show that happened at Springfield College</p>
<p>and a guy named Bob York.</p>
<p>And if you York barbell, that&rsquo;s still around today,</p>
<p>is going around the country</p>
<p>and putting on these exhibitions.</p>
<p>They come to Springfield</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of like a new aged social media thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like the students know what&rsquo;s about to happen</p>
<p>because Karpovich shows up to this event</p>
<p>and everyone knows he hates strength training</p>
<p>and everyone is like waiting for it to end</p>
<p>just to see what he&rsquo;s going to say.</p>
<p>So this whole exhibition goes on</p>
<p>and these people are doing,</p>
<p>now you got to remember back in the time,</p>
<p>like bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting,</p>
<p>strength, strong man, it&rsquo;s like all the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no differentiation yet.</p>
<p>And it finishes and Karpovich stands up</p>
<p>and like the crowd goes silent.</p>
<p>And he just asks one question</p>
<p>and he just points to one of the guys and says,</p>
<p>scratch your back.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s just assuming and waiting for the guy</p>
<p>to be like, ah,</p>
<p>and not be able to put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>And I think he pointed to John Gimmick,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like a famous bodybuilder</p>
<p>and he reached back and scratched his back, no problem.</p>
<p>And then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells,</p>
<p>I think they were 50 pound dumbbells</p>
<p>and do a backflip, standing backflip</p>
<p>with both in each hand.</p>
<p>They start doing the splits on stage</p>
<p>and they start going,</p>
<p>performing all kinds of physical function tests</p>
<p>and Karpovich is stunned.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, holy shit, he has nothing to say.</p>
<p>He leaves there and his whole life has changed.</p>
<p>All these things he was claiming</p>
<p>were shown in his face to be false.</p>
<p>He does a 180 on his career.</p>
<p>He starts running study after study on strength training</p>
<p>and starts finding immediately,</p>
<p>there are no detriments to strength training</p>
<p>in terms of like global health, right?</p>
<p>Of course you can do it wrong and things like that.</p>
<p>And in fact, here comes a whole bunch of benefits.</p>
<p>And so through the 1950s,</p>
<p>while this thing&rsquo;s going on with the endurance folks,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s still strength training</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no record to see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no American College of Sports Medicine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no societies, there&rsquo;s no science.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, Karpovich is just hammering</p>
<p>study after study after study,</p>
<p>showing you it&rsquo;s safe, it&rsquo;s safe, it&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t picked up yet.</p>
<p>And then everything changed in 1977.</p>
<p>Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>He came out with the trifold.</p>
<p>He hits you with Pumping Iron,</p>
<p>which I know you know that movie, right?</p>
<p>Pumping Iron?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting movie,</p>
<p>even for those not interested in bodybuilding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting movie</p>
<p>because it really gives a window into not just him,</p>
<p>but the way in which weight training started to show up</p>
<p>as a regular practice.</p>
<p>When I was growing up,</p>
<p>the only people who weight trained</p>
<p>were people preparing for football,</p>
<p>bodybuilders who basically didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>in the town where I grew up.</p>
<p>And the only people who did yoga</p>
<p>were like yogis doing Bikram.</p>
<p>But now you drive through any major American city</p>
<p>or European city and there&rsquo;s yoga studios,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gyms with free weights.</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible,</p>
<p>I think, for initiating that shift.</p>
<p>Yep, think about it.</p>
<p>He hit us with Pumping Iron, Conan,</p>
<p>and then the Terminator,</p>
<p>almost in back-to-back, like very close within years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this whole cascade of the 70s</p>
<p>of people running, cycling, and swimming.</p>
<p>Now science is starting to come out</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not dangerous</p>
<p>and maybe actually some benefit, and then boom.</p>
<p>Not only is it not bad for you,</p>
<p>it can make you into a real-world superhero.</p>
<p>I mean, think about the psychology</p>
<p>of a child growing up watching somebody like Conan.</p>
<p>Think about what Batman looked like</p>
<p>in the 1950s and 60s, right?</p>
<p>And then boom, I can look like that?</p>
<p>Now, not everyone wants to look like Arnold,</p>
<p>but you see the power that can land in people</p>
<p>no one had ever seen or thought</p>
<p>you can make your body transform like that.</p>
<p>You could maybe be born like that,</p>
<p>but no chance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s within the grasp of all of you.</p>
<p>When I was a kid growing up,</p>
<p>one of my favorite books</p>
<p>was the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p>I still have images in my mind of the coldest animal,</p>
<p>the longest lifespan, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger,</p>
<p>and you know what his record was?</p>
<p>It said, perfectly developed man,</p>
<p>which is, as you point out,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t the physique that most people aspire to,</p>
<p>but it really did inspire this shift.</p>
<p>The other thing about resistance training</p>
<p>that I think has a certain allure for some people,</p>
<p>men and women,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s one of the few forms of exercise</p>
<p>that because of the enhanced blood flow</p>
<p>to the muscle that occurs during the training,</p>
<p>the so-called pump,</p>
<p>it gives you a transient but somewhat real window</p>
<p>into what your results will be.</p>
<p>You know, when you run and you&rsquo;re gasping for air,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get this,</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t experiencing what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be faster than you are that day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But when you weight train,</p>
<p>you get an aesthetic picture</p>
<p>into how your functionality and aesthetic will change.</p>
<p>It disappears a few hours later</p>
<p>as the so-called pump subsides,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very interesting form of exercise in that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if you go in to learn a language</p>
<p>and during the process of learning,</p>
<p>for brief moments,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually fluent and then it gets taken away.</p>
<p>It sort of puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you.</p>
<p>This is just me hypothesizing</p>
<p>as to why weight training</p>
<p>might have taken off the way that it did.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s like if you got paid</p>
<p>every hour on the hour when you&rsquo;re working.</p>
<p>And then at the end of the day,</p>
<p>like they take the money back,</p>
<p>but you still like,</p>
<p>as the time clock is going on in your day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking up and you&rsquo;re just seeing</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re watching your bank account grow in real life.</p>
<p>Like you can see why it&rsquo;s so addicting to those folks.</p>
<p>So to finish the story here,</p>
<p>going back to your actual question to answer it,</p>
<p>this is happening in the late 70s, early 80s.</p>
<p>And so now Joe Weider,</p>
<p>all of these gyms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re exploding because people wanna look like that.</p>
<p>Or if they realize they have the chance</p>
<p>to change how they physically look.</p>
<p>That had never been a reality before.</p>
<p>You can get-</p>
<p>Mostly men at that point, I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>
<p>Almost exclusively.</p>
<p>Yet for a large number of reasons,</p>
<p>cultural acceptance, et cetera.</p>
<p>Even with endurance stuff,</p>
<p>you could get fitter and run faster and that&rsquo;s better,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t going to change how you looked</p>
<p>unless you were losing fat.</p>
<p>Now you can change how you look,</p>
<p>which is so incredibly addicting.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a very famous quote.</p>
<p>I think it was actually Joe Weider who said,</p>
<p>show me one man who wants to be strong</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll show you 10 who want to look strong.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s very, very powerful, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole like&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of this history I can go into,</p>
<p>which is sort of explaining to you.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re in the mid 80s</p>
<p>and you have what I call my generation.</p>
<p>So you have my generation who fall in love</p>
<p>with strength training in 1980s and 90s,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s really no scientific field for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really come about yet.</p>
<p>The science of endurance and exercise physiology</p>
<p>is now humming along at a massive rate</p>
<p>because these people came up in the 70s and 80s</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re five, 10, 15 years in their career.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re producing, they&rsquo;re generating graduate students,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting their own labs</p>
<p>and exercise physiology still to this day is 80% endurance,</p>
<p>steady state stuff almost exclusively.</p>
<p>Well, now my generation, you love sports,</p>
<p>you love lifting, you love all these things.</p>
<p>And now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training.</p>
<p>Ooh, that&rsquo;s on TV.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on SportsCenter in the mid 1990s lifting weights.</p>
<p>And we go back actually to the late 1970s.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re a football fan,</p>
<p>but any football fan will recognize</p>
<p>the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1970s and 80s</p>
<p>changed how football is played.</p>
<p>Well, the reason is because they started strength training</p>
<p>and they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Epley</p>
<p>who was the founder of the NSCA.</p>
<p>So the National Strength and Conditioning Association</p>
<p>is formed in the late 1970s as well.</p>
<p>So just like ACSM was developed</p>
<p>a year after those two events happened,</p>
<p>1978, the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NSCA is formed.</p>
<p>And now you have a scientific organization</p>
<p>dedicated to strength and conditioning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got NFL strength conditioning coaches</p>
<p>that are starting to come on board.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got scientists that are starting to come into labs</p>
<p>and strength conditioning becomes a scientific field.</p>
<p>Well, everything swings now from an exercise perspective</p>
<p>into bodybuilding.</p>
<p>And so almost all of the things,</p>
<p>in fact, we were sort of talking before,</p>
<p>I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you.</p>
<p>And I could ask you a whole bunch of questions</p>
<p>about things that you think are absolute standards</p>
<p>or guaranteed about training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never supposed to do that.</p>
<p>For instance, is it okay to train a muscle group</p>
<p>on back-to-back days?</p>
<p>Most people are at home thinking,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re not supposed to train a muscle group.</p>
<p>It needs to recover.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s total nonsense, right?</p>
<p>Other things like body part split training, right?</p>
<p>Training one muscle group per day.</p>
<p>Other things like cardio, endurance training, influencing,</p>
<p>will it ruin my gains from my lift?</p>
<p>All of these things are on at a base of assumptions</p>
<p>that come from bodybuilding.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a fantastic world,</p>
<p>but because everything started in the late 1970s</p>
<p>as bodybuilding in terms of basically strength training</p>
<p>was that.</p>
<p>Weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>They were, but nobody cared.</p>
<p>Again, show me someone who wants to be strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you 10 who want to look strong.</p>
<p>The physique thing just dominated</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not getting out of that yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not all the way out of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to though, because here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>People started to realize,</p>
<p>this bodybuilding thing is fantastic.</p>
<p>I can change my physique.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting better.</p>
<p>But damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, two hours.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna spend that whole time</p>
<p>on one or two body parts,</p>
<p>which means I&rsquo;m gonna have to lift six days a week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna have to do that consistently, right?</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden, boom, two hours on my elbow flexors.</p>
<p>Damn, my elbow&rsquo;s starting to hurt.</p>
<p>And yet my understanding is that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really require two hours a day</p>
<p>of training in order to get benefits,</p>
<p>even just for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Totally, but a lot of the times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to get some amount of time in</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re spending so much isolation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gone away from training movement.</p>
<p>Running is a movement.</p>
<p>Cycling is a movement.</p>
<p>Training my biceps is a muscle or muscle group.</p>
<p>Training my hamstrings are a muscle group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a human movement.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises</p>
<p>from movement-based prescription</p>
<p>to now muscle group-based training.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re isolating muscle groups,</p>
<p>that means a whole chunk of your body</p>
<p>is really not doing much throughout the day.</p>
<p>So what happens if you&rsquo;re doing, say, legs on Monday</p>
<p>and you miss Monday because you&rsquo;re on a flight?</p>
<p>Now your legs have to wait a whole nother week, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the solution to that.</p>
<p>So this starts to become problematic.</p>
<p>People start getting beat up.</p>
<p>People start realizing, I actually don&rsquo;t feel that great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super fit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sweating just walking up the stairs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out of breath.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because all that training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done nothing to improve heart rate,</p>
<p>oxygenation, blood flow.</p>
<p>And so that paradigm swing way too hard</p>
<p>into the exercising, especially lifting weights,</p>
<p>is single joint, often machine, often slow,</p>
<p>often high volume isolation stuff.</p>
<p>And that left a giant opening of people going,</p>
<p>well, wait a minute.</p>
<p>What if you could get in the gym?</p>
<p>I could promise you the same or better results</p>
<p>in under 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And in fact, you&rsquo;ll also feel better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll lose more weight.</p>
<p>And that opened up group exercise classes,</p>
<p>kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type of stuff, circuit training,</p>
<p>because you can come in.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t get so beat up because the volume&rsquo;s lower.</p>
<p>The time is much lower.</p>
<p>You get multiple adaptations at the same time.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>The problem with that though, fast forward 10 years,</p>
<p>is it started burying people</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve now de-emphasized movement quality</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve overemphasized scores, right?</p>
<p>So this is a classic example.</p>
<p>If you go and you watch Pumping Iron,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see, or any bodybuilder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see if they&rsquo;re doing a bicep curl.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even really pay attention to the rep range.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really pay attention to the load.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at their muscle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to figure out,</p>
<p>how do I get that thing to fire?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re squeezing, they&rsquo;re flexing, they&rsquo;re posing.</p>
<p>At the end of every set, they&rsquo;re trying to figure out,</p>
<p>am I getting enough pump?</p>
<p>It is exclusively founded on exercise quality.</p>
<p>The rep range, the numbers, almost irrelevant.</p>
<p>When you go to the other model, exercise technique,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps</p>
<p>or the fastest time, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>High intensity.</p>
<p>This should be CrossFit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve walked past some CrossFit studios.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done two CrossFit classes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna get sued.</p>
<p>So you said it&rsquo;s CrossFit, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I enjoyed them.</p>
<p>I definitely felt like I was working hard.</p>
<p>I observed a lot of people in very close proximity</p>
<p>doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you kick your legs, folks say,</p>
<p>sort of like bucking and kipping type pull-ups.</p>
<p>No, I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t for me for the long-term,</p>
<p>but it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement</p>
<p>in close proximity to other people.</p>
<p>So the hazard to me seemed more about that</p>
<p>than the actual movement.</p>
<p>Well, again, the point I&rsquo;m setting up here is</p>
<p>that was actually a really brilliant solution</p>
<p>for a lot of the problems</p>
<p>the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced.</p>
<p>So it got away from isolation movements</p>
<p>and got people doing big movements,</p>
<p>which are more effective, generally better.</p>
<p>It got people doing things fast and explosive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more athletic.</p>
<p>That is more important for longevity.</p>
<p>It solved a lot of the problems.</p>
<p>Joint health wasn&rsquo;t getting crashed.</p>
<p>The issue they went with is they just pushed the pace</p>
<p>on score rather than quality.</p>
<p>They pushed the pace on how many people</p>
<p>can be in here at the same time.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re doing higher risk movements,</p>
<p>higher intensity, higher fatigue,</p>
<p>and with a total, not that they don&rsquo;t care about technique,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the thing that they&rsquo;re most concerned about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting the number and the thing done.</p>
<p>They solved the time issue though.</p>
<p>You can get tremendous results in three days a week</p>
<p>under 45 minutes each session, et cetera.</p>
<p>Burn people out though, way too much high intensity,</p>
<p>way too often.</p>
<p>And the other problem, safety concerns,</p>
<p>all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff.</p>
<p>Can I interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question</p>
<p>as we go through this arc of the history</p>
<p>of why endurance training predominated</p>
<p>or strength training or bodybuilding type training</p>
<p>or CrossFit type training?</p>
<p>Because I think this is fascinating.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re about to arrive at where we are today</p>
<p>and what the future looks like for people</p>
<p>and what they should focus on and do.</p>
<p>At what point, if any, do you think resistance training</p>
<p>started to become adopted by women?</p>
<p>There was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>There was Linda Hamilton in the Terminator.</p>
<p>There are some impressive physiques,</p>
<p>certainly on female actresses and athletes.</p>
<p>The Williams sisters, very impressive musculature</p>
<p>and physiques, and of course,</p>
<p>their tennis playing speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Has that happened yet?</p>
<p>I mean, what I mean is, do you think,</p>
<p>since you work with both men and women,</p>
<p>do you think that most women understand</p>
<p>that weight training done properly</p>
<p>is going to be extremely beneficial for them,</p>
<p>maybe even especially for them</p>
<p>in terms of offsetting bone density loss</p>
<p>and things of that sort?</p>
<p>Or are we still waiting for the popular stimulus</p>
<p>for getting 80% of young women thinking,</p>
<p>I want to lift weights?</p>
<p>Yeah, hard for me to answer</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a woman, right?</p>
<p>Now I have a daughter, she&rsquo;s four, so we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>What I can say is I&rsquo;ve probably worked with,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many professional athletes in total, a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with them probably 14 professional sports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Cy Young winners, MVPs,</p>
<p>like the whole, all the credentials, right?</p>
<p>I bet 35, 40% of the athletes I&rsquo;ve worked with are female.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked with Olympic gold medalists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with bronze medalists in multiple sports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with the most decorated power lifter</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>In a number of these areas, fighters, world championship,</p>
<p>all these things.</p>
<p>For me, I feel like that burst has already happened.</p>
<p>My students, if you look at my classroom,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the numbers are,</p>
<p>but there is no small number of females</p>
<p>in exercise science and exercise physiology.</p>
<p>If you look at our laboratories,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing you will see.</p>
<p>There are very few female exercise scientists.</p>
<p>There are very few female strength conditioning coaches,</p>
<p>but that number is coming down at an astronomical rate.</p>
<p>You have people that are being hired in every sport.</p>
<p>You pick the NFL, you pick major league baseball.</p>
<p>Every few months, we&rsquo;re hearing first female hired for this,</p>
<p>first female hired for that.</p>
<p>The Yankees, Rachel, Rachel Belkovic is fantastic.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, she&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Yeah, Rachel&rsquo;s been out to my lab.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, she&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s now being hired as the,</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s a hitting coach now, actual sport coach.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna be a GM, right?</p>
<p>This is her goal.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a Terminator.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>And my students that are coming through our program</p>
<p>are getting placed in these roles.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t gotten through yet a lot</p>
<p>in terms of being an actual scientist,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>Sport scientists in the NBA bring hired females</p>
<p>in terms of like big data collection</p>
<p>and sport science and tech we&rsquo;ll cover, you know,</p>
<p>in another discussion.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>whether or not the cultural and social&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to that in the equation.</p>
<p>What I can speak to though is one of the things</p>
<p>I think is most fun coming forward scientifically</p>
<p>is, you know, a number of years ago,</p>
<p>NIH came through with their mandates</p>
<p>of saying it&rsquo;s no longer acceptable</p>
<p>to exclude women from scientific research, right?</p>
<p>Because we just did that for decades.</p>
<p>Well, what happened, just to fill this in,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s worth noting,</p>
<p>is that for many years, studies even on rodents</p>
<p>were mainly carried out on male rodents</p>
<p>because the assumption,</p>
<p>and the assumption turned out to be wrong,</p>
<p>but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 28 days.</p>
<p>They have an estrous cycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s four days, a different type of cycle,</p>
<p>that that would somehow disrupt the data.</p>
<p>It turns out that that&rsquo;s entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s actually required.</p>
<p>When you sit on a grant study panel,</p>
<p>which are the people who evaluate grants,</p>
<p>they ask, they literally say,</p>
<p>did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable?</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re not talking about sex as the verb.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about sex as biological sex.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t say yes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a strong hit against the grant.</p>
<p>And if you say yes, then it checks off that box.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s now required that both male and female rodents</p>
<p>and humans be studied in a given study,</p>
<p>unless the study is specifically geared</p>
<p>toward understanding that it only exists</p>
<p>in one or the other population,</p>
<p>such as menopause, for instance,</p>
<p>menstrual cycle, andropause, for instance.</p>
<p>But this is extremely important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to hear that.</p>
<p>So where I was going to go with that is actually,</p>
<p>so that was step one, which is cool.</p>
<p>You got to include them.</p>
<p>Where we haven&rsquo;t gotten to yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen more and more grant applications</p>
<p>come through for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the funding hasn&rsquo;t hit yet,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s one thing to let women be in the same studies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing though,</p>
<p>to start performing high performance research</p>
<p>specifically for female questions.</p>
<p>That has not happened yet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just like a funding issue, right?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t gotten money yet.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t supporting that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get a lot of financial support for sports science,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t track down the money yet</p>
<p>if someone go, me going,</p>
<p>I want to do a study in female athletes</p>
<p>that answers female athlete questions.</p>
<p>These won&rsquo;t help men.</p>
<p>These are questions specific to the female.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next step, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we got to get to.</p>
<p>So we can say, maybe we should do things differently</p>
<p>around training and recovery,</p>
<p>or we shouldn&rsquo;t, or it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s a handful of,</p>
<p>not lower quality, but like some studies,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love them yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just needs to be a ton of work.</p>
<p>Birth control is a very good example, right?</p>
<p>The information for women at female athletes,</p>
<p>or even just like hard exercises,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be a competitive athlete,</p>
<p>around what is birth control doing?</p>
<p>What types?</p>
<p>How should I manage that?</p>
<p>What conversations should I be having with my doctor?</p>
<p>Almost nothing.</p>
<p>Like women have nothing to go on for high performance stuff.</p>
<p>So what if I&rsquo;m trying to compete in an event or run a race?</p>
<p>How, like all those types of questions should be answered.</p>
<p>Normative value, normative data, performance testing,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just not there on the female.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an area I think,</p>
<p>like if somebody really wanted to make a change,</p>
<p>that the scientists want to do it.</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;ve talked to so many in our field</p>
<p>that would really love to explore it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>Like I said, the coaching side is getting there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeing that they&rsquo;re hiring these people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing it in my students.</p>
<p>You know, my following is not all men.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a very large percentage of females.</p>
<p>And all I do is post about exercise science.</p>
<p>And like, this is all I do.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, this podcast is a very,</p>
<p>we know very clearly the audience is 50% women, 50% men.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Which is great.</p>
<p>So just to jump back on our history discussion</p>
<p>and to finish that point of where we&rsquo;re at now</p>
<p>and where I think we&rsquo;re going to go or should go.</p>
<p>So we walked through the bodybuilding</p>
<p>kind of running everything</p>
<p>and people walking into a gym, anytime they lift weights,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making all of their choices</p>
<p>based on the assumption</p>
<p>that maximizing muscle size is the goal.</p>
<p>And clearly that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>There are other adaptations you may be after.</p>
<p>So we talked about how that had problems.</p>
<p>And then we talked about how some of these other forms</p>
<p>of exercise filled those gaps.</p>
<p>And then what problems those things introduced.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re actually at a point</p>
<p>where that pendulum is kind of slowly shifting</p>
<p>into the middle.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is,</p>
<p>if you want to maximize muscle strength,</p>
<p>we look towards the power lifting community.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize muscle power,</p>
<p>we look to the weightlifting community.</p>
<p>If you want to look for muscular endurance</p>
<p>or well-roundedness,</p>
<p>maybe we look into the CrossFit communities</p>
<p>and some of these obstacle course races</p>
<p>or functionality things.</p>
<p>So what we can do now is generate protocols</p>
<p>that get us the exact adaptations we want</p>
<p>and not ones we don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>Because we can look back at each of these different styles</p>
<p>of training and pick and choose optimal protocols</p>
<p>or combinations for them.</p>
<p>So somebody simply wants to get healthy.</p>
<p>Like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations</p>
<p>and I mentioned health wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because what determines your health</p>
<p>versus what determines my optimal health differs.</p>
<p>So if I need more hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I can look towards bodybuilding concepts.</p>
<p>But if I have enough,</p>
<p>or maybe for personal reasons I decide I have too much</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t want to add any more,</p>
<p>then I can say,</p>
<p>hey, how can I get stronger without getting bigger?</p>
<p>And boom, I look towards power lifting concepts.</p>
<p>How can I get more powerful?</p>
<p>How can I get faster?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, you know, again, want to lose fat.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Or if I want physique changes.</p>
<p>So we have all these different areas we can pick</p>
<p>and choose from that have expertise in specific adaptations</p>
<p>and develop ourselves perfect protocols</p>
<p>based on that information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests</p>
<p>and DNA tests out there, however,</p>
<p>is that you get information back about various levels</p>
<p>of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform</p>
<p>that lets you see what your specific numbers are,</p>
<p>of course,</p>
<p>but also what sorts of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>So with the understanding in mind</p>
<p>as to how we all, myself included,</p>
<p>arrived at such lopsided fitness,</p>
<p>too much endurance, not enough strength,</p>
<p>too much strength, not enough endurance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to imagine</p>
<p>that anyone&rsquo;s perfect in this regard.</p>
<p>Can you walk us through the nine different adaptations</p>
<p>that you mentioned earlier</p>
<p>and give us a way to assess our level of ability</p>
<p>or our level of adaptation in each of those nine?</p>
<p>All right, the very first one we wanna talk about</p>
<p>is movement skill.</p>
<p>Now, set aside sport specific,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna give you an assessment</p>
<p>for optimal golf technique, swing.</p>
<p>This is really about human movement</p>
<p>so that you stay injury free</p>
<p>and you can continue to train for as long as possible.</p>
<p>So what are the minimum requirements?</p>
<p>Now, if you can have access</p>
<p>to a highly qualified physical therapist</p>
<p>or movement specialist, that&rsquo;s the best route, right?</p>
<p>Go to them, have them identify all of your movement patterns,</p>
<p>overhead pressing, squatting, running, all these things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your gold standard.</p>
<p>If you wanna do it yourself though,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a very simple four-step solution.</p>
<p>So the way that I teach this is I go joint by joint.</p>
<p>And so I think of this just as the major ones,</p>
<p>your shoulder, your elbow, your low back,</p>
<p>hip, knee, and ankle, okay?</p>
<p>Now, what you can do is do a representative movement for you.</p>
<p>So if you bench a lot, use the bench.</p>
<p>If you do pull-ups, use the pull-up.</p>
<p>If you squat, do that.</p>
<p>I would recommend doing an upper body press,</p>
<p>an upper body pull, a lower body press, lower body pull.</p>
<p>An example would be a push-up, a pull-up or a bent row,</p>
<p>a squat, and then a deadlift.</p>
<p>That would be a very, very well-rounded approach.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re going to do is do that movement,</p>
<p>and I would record it for yourself,</p>
<p>and record a frontal view and a side view.</p>
<p>Probably do three to 10 repetitions per angle, okay?</p>
<p>Slow and controlled, you don&rsquo;t need any body weight.</p>
<p>What you wanna do is move,</p>
<p>and you wanna look for four key things at every joint,</p>
<p>all right?</p>
<p>So again, imagine I&rsquo;m doing a squat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a squat, and I&rsquo;m gonna focus on just my ankle,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna look for these four things of the ankle,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna go back and watch my knee,</p>
<p>and look for these same four things of the knee,</p>
<p>to the hip, et cetera, all right?</p>
<p>So what are these four things?</p>
<p>Number one is you wanna look for symmetry.</p>
<p>So symmetry is front to back, left to right,</p>
<p>and your right limb and your left limb, all right?</p>
<p>And so what we wanna look for are,</p>
<p>if they aren&rsquo;t moving perfectly, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but you wanna see,</p>
<p>is one moving further ahead than the other one?</p>
<p>Is one turning to the side and one&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>Is one fidgeting and twitching around differently?</p>
<p>So you wanna look just to check,</p>
<p>to see and make sure that they&rsquo;re stable, that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Number two, you wanna look for stability.</p>
<p>So key indicators here are things like,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t control a squat,</p>
<p>a controlled squat where your knees don&rsquo;t start shaking,</p>
<p>that would be an instability issue.</p>
<p>So can you do the movement slow?</p>
<p>Can you pause at the bottom, maybe three seconds,</p>
<p>maybe five seconds or 10?</p>
<p>You should have complete control of that movement</p>
<p>at all of these joints.</p>
<p>Are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up?</p>
<p>Is one elbow closer to your body when you&rsquo;re benching,</p>
<p>and the other one&rsquo;s more flared out?</p>
<p>These are the things I&rsquo;m talking about, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about what angle they should be at or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities.</p>
<p>All right, so again, as you&rsquo;re pushing up,</p>
<p>does one elbow start flipping and twitching</p>
<p>and going all over the place?</p>
<p>The third one is what I call awareness.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of movement technique issues</p>
<p>that are simply people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll watch them squat.</p>
<p>I do this in my classes all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a hundred kids out there squatting</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see some horrible squat technique.</p>
<p>And then when you just tell them,</p>
<p>hey, did you realize your heels are supposed to be</p>
<p>on the ground at all times when you squat?</p>
<p>Like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And they can correct it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually a movement flaw.</p>
<p>It was just simply an awareness.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then I actually didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that that was happening in that position.</p>
<p>So we want all of our joints to be going</p>
<p>through a general full range of motion, which is number four.</p>
<p>So the ankles during like a squat,</p>
<p>your knees should be able to go as far</p>
<p>over your toe as possible while maintaining good position,</p>
<p>your feet flat on the floor,</p>
<p>your three points of contact, your whole foot,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not compromising another joint.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re going to look for, those four things,</p>
<p>symmetry, stability, awareness,</p>
<p>and range of motion through each joint,</p>
<p>through each movement.</p>
<p>It sounds difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not, right?</p>
<p>You can generally kind of clear these things</p>
<p>in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re really going to look for,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of scoring schemes.</p>
<p>You can, you know, test the physical therapist</p>
<p>and sort of you.</p>
<p>I just look for absolutely terrible,</p>
<p>like can&rsquo;t do it at all,</p>
<p>minor flaw or pretty close to good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>So my scoring system is zero, one, three.</p>
<p>Zero is like, you&rsquo;re not going to do this exercise</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re at a very high acute risk.</p>
<p>You might get hurt on rep one tomorrow.</p>
<p>Number one, like a score of one is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a minor flaw here.</p>
<p>We can probably do it,</p>
<p>but we need to be cautious of load and volume.</p>
<p>The other one is maybe it&rsquo;s perfect, maybe it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but go ahead and sort of do it on a reasonable protocol.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s generally what you would need to do</p>
<p>is a cost-free method of identifying</p>
<p>good movement technique</p>
<p>within any of the things that you would do.</p>
<p>What about speed?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think this is one most people should test.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a high-performance athlete,</p>
<p>we can run a 40-yard dash,</p>
<p>or we can do some different things</p>
<p>with a velocity transducer on a barbell.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a weightlifter or something,</p>
<p>for most people, pure speed is really maximum velocity</p>
<p>or acceleration or kind of the two ways we break it down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s generally not that necessary to test.</p>
<p>What about number three, power,</p>
<p>which I believe before you told me was speed times force?</p>
<p>So the reason why I don&rsquo;t worry too much about speed</p>
<p>is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test,</p>
<p>and a power test is easier to do</p>
<p>as well as easier to train for for most people.</p>
<p>So the cost-free version here is a simple broad jump.</p>
<p>So this is stand with normal position,</p>
<p>jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can,</p>
<p>and measure the distance between where you started</p>
<p>and the back of your heel where it lands.</p>
<p>A super basic number to look for there is your height.</p>
<p>So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re five foot five, you should hit five foot five,</p>
<p>six foot five, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna ratchet down a little bit,</p>
<p>about 15% for females.</p>
<p>They just simply don&rsquo;t have the power in general</p>
<p>that men have, and so you&rsquo;re gonna wanna bring that down</p>
<p>a little bit, but it&rsquo;s a very crude number.</p>
<p>If you were to look at like a high-performance NFL player,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re six feet tall, they&rsquo;re gonna be jumping</p>
<p>like nine to 10 to 11 feet.</p>
<p>If you can jump your body height,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not looking for optimization</p>
<p>in this particular test.</p>
<p>What you are looking for, red flags,</p>
<p>if you can jump your body height,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be just fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly straightforward,</p>
<p>and yet I have one question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to</p>
<p>before I jump.</p>
<p>I can swing my arms from back to front as hard</p>
<p>or with as much momentum as I can muster,</p>
<p>and when I land, you said I&rsquo;m gonna take the measure</p>
<p>from where the back of my heels.</p>
<p>You wanna measure the distance you actually covered.</p>
<p>So to clarify, there&rsquo;s no running approach here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no steps into it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna stand at a still.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can swing, bounce as much as you&rsquo;d like to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna projectile off.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna measure the distance</p>
<p>from the tip of your toe.</p>
<p>So basically stand behind the line,</p>
<p>and then the furthest point back where you land.</p>
<p>So basically the worst possible score,</p>
<p>not the best possible,</p>
<p>because your feet won&rsquo;t land symmetrically.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s probably gonna be a little bit farther.</p>
<p>Now, technically, if you fall backwards</p>
<p>and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number,</p>
<p>but in this case, just use the furthest point back</p>
<p>of your back heel and go from there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be trying it tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Now, if you have access to a little bit more technology</p>
<p>or you just really wanna know a better number,</p>
<p>a classic vertical jump is a good starting place.</p>
<p>So you can actually do this in a simple cost-free way.</p>
<p>You can just measure two of your hands, put them together,</p>
<p>so that both of your middle fingers are touching.</p>
<p>Overlap them and put them directly over your head, okay?</p>
<p>And then you kinda wanna reach up as high as you can get,</p>
<p>and you mark that on the wall.</p>
<p>My brother and I used to do this all the time.</p>
<p>We would take a highlighter, the yellow ones,</p>
<p>and color as much as we can on our fingertips,</p>
<p>touch the wall so that the highlighter</p>
<p>would stay in the wall.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d actually go back to my house from my childhood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see these markers all over our house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure your parents were thrilled.</p>
<p>My dad didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Single dad, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like, whatever you guys do whatever you want.</p>
<p>So you wanna measure that.</p>
<p>And then of course, you&rsquo;re gonna jump</p>
<p>with those two hands and touch as high as you can up.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna measure the distance</p>
<p>between your standing reach</p>
<p>and the actual height that you jump there.</p>
<p>Now, the reason you&rsquo;re doing it two-handed, by the way,</p>
<p>is because if you do one-handed,</p>
<p>you can actually reach pretty high</p>
<p>by offsetting your shoulders.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re getting into differences of, you know,</p>
<p>who has more shoulder mobility,</p>
<p>who has the ability to kinda get up there.</p>
<p>A two-foot stand or a two-handed standard approach is there.</p>
<p>Same thing, no running approach here.</p>
<p>You can dip, you can drive, you can do all those things.</p>
<p>You can swing your arms,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna be a two-handed touch</p>
<p>is a general way to do that.</p>
<p>And you wanna look for a number</p>
<p>of something like 24 inches or higher.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re past the age of 50,</p>
<p>that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20.</p>
<p>And again, for females,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be ratcheted down about 15%,</p>
<p>everywhere you wanna go.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a middle-aged female</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re jumping 20 inches,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be looking really nice there.</p>
<p>So now if you can do that on a force plate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p>So these are very, basically scales</p>
<p>that will go out to multiple digits,</p>
<p>sometimes five to nine digits past a zero.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna stand on these things,</p>
<p>you can do the exact same test.</p>
<p>And these are very interesting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll tell you not only how high you jump,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll tell you how much force you put into the ground.</p>
<p>They can also tell you how long it took you.</p>
<p>This is called your rate of force development,</p>
<p>as well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff,</p>
<p>which are important to help you understand</p>
<p>where on the power spectrum you need to be.</p>
<p>So you would do that in addition</p>
<p>to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell.</p>
<p>So a very classic thing to do would be,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re gonna do a squat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna put this device on the barbell</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna measure the speed</p>
<p>which the barbell moves.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna do that at 40% of your one repetition max,</p>
<p>50%, 60%, 70, 80, 90, up to a hundred.</p>
<p>And that allows you to create</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a force velocity curve.</p>
<p>And you can start to see at what point</p>
<p>when you start loading things heavy,</p>
<p>do you start slowing down too much?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll tell you what part of the force velocity curve</p>
<p>that you wanna train to optimize your power.</p>
<p>Why that&rsquo;s important?</p>
<p>A lot of people will do things like,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m training for power, how heavy should I lift?</p>
<p>Well, the general answer people say</p>
<p>is 30% of your one rep max,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually not true at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most optimal for power development,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll discuss more much later,</p>
<p>is depending on where you&rsquo;re flawed</p>
<p>in the force velocity curve.</p>
<p>So if you have access to technology like that,</p>
<p>that can give you a lot more insight and information.</p>
<p>If not, do the broad jump test</p>
<p>or the highlighter on your fingertips</p>
<p>and jump and touch the wall test.</p>
<p>At Andy Yalpin&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Hey, just, you know what, come along.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already, the walls are already messed up.</p>
<p>Just go ahead and come up to Washington and we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>What about strength?</p>
<p>Right, so strength is really important.</p>
<p>You need to measure this in multiple areas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start off with grip strength.</p>
<p>So you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p>You can buy a hand grip dynamometer.</p>
<p>Now these are anywhere between 20 to $100, anywhere.</p>
<p>These actually used to be, like when I was in school,</p>
<p>like hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>And now you can literally buy them</p>
<p>on any website for 25 bucks.</p>
<p>So my last recommendation is technically</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not cost-free.</p>
<p>I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols,</p>
<p>but 25 bucks, I&rsquo;m calling that basically cost-free.</p>
<p>You can bring that in and test that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a little device</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna squeeze and you&rsquo;re gonna do,</p>
<p>and I would do your right hand and your left hand.</p>
<p>You wanna look for asymmetries there,</p>
<p>but you wanna look for something like,</p>
<p>typically those are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna give you a value in kilograms.</p>
<p>And you wanna look for something</p>
<p>like a minimum score here of 40 kilograms.</p>
<p>Ideally, you&rsquo;re up past 60,</p>
<p>would be a really good spot to be in.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that there&rsquo;s no less than 10% variation</p>
<p>between your left and right hand.</p>
<p>Your non-dominant hand actually shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>that much weaker in this test.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll actually see a lot of times</p>
<p>is a non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger</p>
<p>because the dominant hand is more for movement precision,</p>
<p>writing, things like that.</p>
<p>So you want them to be close.</p>
<p>If you are a male and you&rsquo;re under 40 kilograms</p>
<p>on a hand grip dynamometer,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re gonna need to train that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a female, it&rsquo;s not that much lower,</p>
<p>but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re above 55, we can add it to your training,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not worried about leaving it out of your training.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a female, if it&rsquo;s about 50,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my sort of cutoff of where we wanna go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fairly cheap one.</p>
<p>Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang.</p>
<p>So you can hold onto any bar,</p>
<p>ideally one that is thin enough</p>
<p>to where you can wrap your whole hand around it.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna be using a giant fat grip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have a false reading here.</p>
<p>So something like going to the gym</p>
<p>and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack.</p>
<p>And you wanna hang, and this is a simple time test.</p>
<p>So in general, we should be able to hang</p>
<p>for a minimum of 30 seconds is what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>30 to kind of 50 seconds is my like good,</p>
<p>but we could probably get better here.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re cruising above 60 seconds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally pretty happy.</p>
<p>This is actually a good example</p>
<p>of when females tend to be better.</p>
<p>Grip strength in women tends to be strong</p>
<p>and they can hang for quite a long time.</p>
<p>So those standards don&rsquo;t really change that much for women.</p>
<p>Now, if you are exceptionally large,</p>
<p>this thing doesn&rsquo;t scale perfectly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 240 pounds, and even if you&rsquo;re lean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hard to hang and hold 240 pounds.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you&rsquo;re 145 pounds,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re unhealthy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to hang for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not that much weight to carry.</p>
<p>So just rough numbers to start off with.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s grip strength.</p>
<p>What about strength elsewhere in the body?</p>
<p>The primary ones,</p>
<p>you can do an upper body strength test if you would like,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not technically something we do very often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to do a 100 max bench press</p>
<p>or something like that, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The more one I&rsquo;m generally more interested in</p>
<p>is a leg extension test.</p>
<p>And the reason I like this is a back squat is better.</p>
<p>A barbell back squat is, look, that&rsquo;s my jam.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my life, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very technically demanding.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s challenging, you need spotters, you need comfort.</p>
<p>A lot goes into this.</p>
<p>So for the average person,</p>
<p>a leg extension test is fairly standardized.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about technique</p>
<p>and people can just get into it and go.</p>
<p>And so what you wanna look for there</p>
<p>is a couple of standards you wanna hit.</p>
<p>Again, a very simple answer here is body weight.</p>
<p>Can you do a leg extension with your body weight?</p>
<p>One repetition?</p>
<p>One repetition.</p>
<p>I can answer that right now.</p>
<p>Can you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No, I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight,</p>
<p>but I was on the leg extension this morning</p>
<p>and I was a nautilus machine</p>
<p>and I certainly could not leg extension my body weight.</p>
<p>Let me clarify, were you doing a single leg?</p>
<p>So bilateral, you can&rsquo;t leg extension your body weight?</p>
<p>No, but I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight.</p>
<p>Okay, so we maybe have some deficiencies in our quads</p>
<p>that we need to go after.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a pretty good number you wanna be at</p>
<p>if you go up in age past age 40.</p>
<p>Every decade, that can come down about 10%</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll still be in a pretty good slot.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re 50 years old and you&rsquo;re 170 pounds,</p>
<p>if you can do 160, you&rsquo;re in a pretty good sort of spot.</p>
<p>And then you could just again,</p>
<p>take it down about 10% every decade after 40.</p>
<p>But prior to 40, there&rsquo;s really no change in strength,</p>
<p>but certainly somebody in their 40s to 50s</p>
<p>should be able to leg extension their body weight.</p>
<p>Noted.</p>
<p>I look forward to our discussion a bit later</p>
<p>talking about how to build strength.</p>
<p>Any of these strength tests,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to be done to a technical true one rep max.</p>
<p>You can use what are called repetition conversion equation.</p>
<p>So put on a load that you think is kind of close</p>
<p>to your maximum</p>
<p>and just do it for as many reps as you can.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s under five reps total,</p>
<p>you can then actually go online</p>
<p>and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere.</p>
<p>And it will tell you,</p>
<p>okay, you did three repetitions at 200 pounds.</p>
<p>Your one rep max is probably 215, whatever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s estimate equations.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t wanna spend the time</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not truly comfortable,</p>
<p>like absolutely going to your true one rep max,</p>
<p>just get to a number that&rsquo;s fairly close</p>
<p>and do as many as you can and then go online.</p>
<p>Again, one rep max estimator equations are everywhere.</p>
<p>If you get past five repetitions or so,</p>
<p>the accuracy of those equations starts going down.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t put on something and go, I did 12 reps of it</p>
<p>and then try to figure out what your one rep max.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll get close.</p>
<p>You start moving past that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy.</p>
<p>So I wanna make sure</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re doing the leg extension test</p>
<p>or a front squat test,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t technically have to do an absolute one rep max.</p>
<p>If neither of those are an option.</p>
<p>Another one I like a lot here</p>
<p>is simply a front squat or a goblet squat hold.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna hold a weight in front of your chest,</p>
<p>whether a kettlebell is great here, a dumbbell is fine here.</p>
<p>And you wanna hold about half of your body weight,</p>
<p>go all the way to the bottom position</p>
<p>and try to hold that for about 45 seconds.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty good indicator</p>
<p>of number one, your position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load</p>
<p>as well as core strength and low back stability.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different indicator</p>
<p>than say the leg extension test,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really nice one.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t require many moving parts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more difficult than leg extension,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite a bit more functional</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna give you insight</p>
<p>into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps.</p>
<p>So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat</p>
<p>and then returning to a standing position.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t do the return,</p>
<p>I actually, I&rsquo;m not that worried,</p>
<p>but as long as you can hold that good position</p>
<p>without a technical breakdown</p>
<p>in that 45 seconds, that&rsquo;s a really good spot.</p>
<p>As an intro, I want a third of your body weight</p>
<p>for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon.</p>
<p>What about hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Actually, before we get into that,</p>
<p>I wanna jump back really quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to add a couple of caveats</p>
<p>to the strength training stuff.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two that I wanna do.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>these are assuming you are technically proficient.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want you to do any exercise to exhaustion</p>
<p>or to maximum strength</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not comfortable with your technique.</p>
<p>So adjust these accordingly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable with the front squat,</p>
<p>do the leg extension.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not even comfortable with that,</p>
<p>do something different.</p>
<p>So we never want to utilize maximum testing</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gonna come with a consequence</p>
<p>of serious acute injury.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the most important flag.</p>
<p>The second one is your warmup protocol</p>
<p>will have a huge effect on your actual results.</p>
<p>And so whenever you do these tests,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re gonna do a test</p>
<p>and then a test again down the line,</p>
<p>you wanna make sure that that warmup protocol is standardized.</p>
<p>Now, again, the NSCA, and I can give you resources,</p>
<p>has specific guides for exactly what to do</p>
<p>for your warmup protocol prior to one-rep max testing.</p>
<p>So we can go there and you can look that stuff up.</p>
<p>We can add that to show notes or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think when we get into a deeper discussion</p>
<p>about strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and resistance training in general,</p>
<p>if we could touch into the best warmup protocol.</p>
<p>I know I have mine and I&rsquo;m certain</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be suboptimal based on everything.</p>
<p>Based on every conversation we&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>where I learned all the things I&rsquo;m doing incorrectly,</p>
<p>but I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not incorrectly so much as it is like suboptimal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very kind way of telling me it&rsquo;s incorrect.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What about hypertrophy?</p>
<p>So the thing you wanna pay attention to here is</p>
<p>you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s entirely up to you.</p>
<p>There is no rationale.</p>
<p>You can decide what you feel like looks good</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>There is a sufficient amount you need to have</p>
<p>where below that is detrimental to your health,</p>
<p>regardless of your outcomes.</p>
<p>And so the best way to do this is a couple of ways.</p>
<p>Any sort of body composition test can do this.</p>
<p>So whether this is a scan, like a DEXA scan,</p>
<p>which is a gold standard,</p>
<p>or other ways of biological,</p>
<p>bioelectrical impedance or other ways.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a ton of different tests you can get</p>
<p>that are pretty close.</p>
<p>So what you wanna pay attention to</p>
<p>when you get like a DEXA scan is a number called FFMI.</p>
<p>And so that stands for fat-free mass index.</p>
<p>So you can look at, again, any number of online calculators.</p>
<p>These are all standard.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter where you pull them up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about looking it up</p>
<p>and whether or not it&rsquo;s right or not or something.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s gonna actually tell you</p>
<p>if you have sufficient muscle mass.</p>
<p>And so a number you wanna look for in general</p>
<p>is something like if you&rsquo;re a man,</p>
<p>your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a woman, you wanna look for something like 18.</p>
<p>So those are the targets.</p>
<p>If you get past like 24, 25 for a man,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of muscle mass,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re reasonably lean.</p>
<p>Now, if your FFMI is like 24, 25,</p>
<p>but your body fat is like 40%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually just a very, very large individual.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not in a great spot.</p>
<p>So when we say these sort of numbers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the assumption that you&rsquo;re probably sub 30% body fat</p>
<p>for a man and sub 35 for a woman.</p>
<p>So those are the numbers.</p>
<p>There are online calculators.</p>
<p>All you really need to know is your total body weight,</p>
<p>your body fat percentage, and then your height.</p>
<p>You can enter those three numbers</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll tell you your FFMI score</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll correct for an adjusted value.</p>
<p>And then most of those will actually tell you</p>
<p>the grading rubric.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like good, average, bad, et cetera.</p>
<p>But those are the numbers we look at.</p>
<p>If you are as a man, sub 17, as a woman, sub 15,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re in an area of pretty severe</p>
<p>physiological detriment for insufficient muscle.</p>
<p>And some of our later discussions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about why that matters.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not sub 17% body fat.</p>
<p>This is specifically the FFMI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, yeah.</p>
<p>What about muscular endurance?</p>
<p>Is this where you&rsquo;re gonna tell me I need to do wall sits?</p>
<p>So this is really nice.</p>
<p>You can do any number of tests here.</p>
<p>A standard plank is a good testament of muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds?</p>
<p>Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds?</p>
<p>Pretty easy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to do a pushup.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t, that sort of tells you alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually interesting.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do a single pushup,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a muscular endurance issue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually now a strength issue</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a one rep max problem.</p>
<p>So we want to be able to do, again, for a general male,</p>
<p>we should have no problem doing 25 plus</p>
<p>consecutive pushups.</p>
<p>I apologize for interrupting you,</p>
<p>but as long as we&rsquo;re talking about pushups,</p>
<p>you just mentioned form.</p>
<p>Are we talking chest touching the ground,</p>
<p>elbows breaking right angles?</p>
<p>What is a proper pushup according to your laboratory?</p>
<p>Unless you have a very specific reason</p>
<p>to limit range of motion,</p>
<p>I want all my testing done</p>
<p>through a full joint range of motion.</p>
<p>This is different for the person.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s individualized to them.</p>
<p>But in general, for a pushup,</p>
<p>this would be a full complete lock out of the elbows</p>
<p>on the top and a full chest touch</p>
<p>or close to it at the ground.</p>
<p>You can do it different.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>but just keep it standard from your pre-test,</p>
<p>your post-test if you&rsquo;re trying to mark progress.</p>
<p>Okay, but for us,</p>
<p>unless we have a very specific reason,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going full range of motion for all of these tests.</p>
<p>Okay, so 25 pushups for a male is a standard</p>
<p>and even something like 10 is a number we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s kind of minimum categories</p>
<p>for an upper body muscular endurance.</p>
<p>And not to get too down in the weeds,</p>
<p>but I have observed other people,</p>
<p>of course, never myself.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>But observed other people pausing</p>
<p>at maybe at repetition 15,</p>
<p>catching their breath and then continuing,</p>
<p>or you continue like a piston.</p>
<p>That would be a failed test.</p>
<p>So no pauses.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Just up, down, up, down,</p>
<p>and trying to hit at least 10,</p>
<p>but ideally 25 or more.</p>
<p>I learned this lesson in one of our studies</p>
<p>probably nine years ago,</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t clarify that.</p>
<p>And so we actually had an individual.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t being nefarious.</p>
<p>He just figured out if I do a couple,</p>
<p>take a quick break and do a couple,</p>
<p>he like quadrupled his post-test results</p>
<p>from his pre-test result</p>
<p>because he figured out that little hack in there.</p>
<p>So you want to standardize it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m against</p>
<p>or have some sort of strong belief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just trying to keep protocol standardized</p>
<p>which means any break, failed test.</p>
<p>So 10 to 25 push-ups minimum for males.</p>
<p>What about for females?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll clarify.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s sub 10 for a man,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s again in your like very severe red flag problem.</p>
<p>We really, really like to see a number above 25.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re anchoring.</p>
<p>Anything between 10 and 25 is like,</p>
<p>yeah, but not severe.</p>
<p>It means they have work to do.</p>
<p>We have work to do.</p>
<p>And for females?</p>
<p>For a female, you&rsquo;re gonna scale that sort of back.</p>
<p>So a female, the answer could be as little as zero, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna see that.</p>
<p>Can you do a full position?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re in that position,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re generally not going to do a muscular endurance test</p>
<p>from the knees.</p>
<p>We already know the answer is you&rsquo;re zero.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll actually default to another test</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second here.</p>
<p>So for those folks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna scale down a little bit, right?</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;re looking at 15 as that marker</p>
<p>like 25 was for the male</p>
<p>where I want to see above 15.</p>
<p>And if I do, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Anything between five to 15 is a number of like,</p>
<p>okay, if you&rsquo;re sub five,</p>
<p>like we generally have some problems.</p>
<p>And if that is different between one and zero,</p>
<p>then like now zero is a problem.</p>
<p>So we should be able to do that.</p>
<p>So if a female cannot do 10 full pushups?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>10 full pushups is hard for a female depending on size.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say a female can&rsquo;t do five full pushups.</p>
<p>You said rather than go to a knees down version,</p>
<p>what would you do to assess their muscular endurance?</p>
<p>And would you then also encourage them</p>
<p>to work on their strength?</p>
<p>Well, absolutely.</p>
<p>So again, if they can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>they can do anything less than three,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be a strength.</p>
<p>In fact, if you wanna look at muscular endurance in general,</p>
<p>so this is a bit of a off topic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll promise I&rsquo;ll keep it short</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come right back.</p>
<p>When I was a doctoral student,</p>
<p>I had two lab mates.</p>
<p>One of them was a runner female, 120 pounds,</p>
<p>something like that, small.</p>
<p>The other one was a male</p>
<p>and he was basically like a straight bro.</p>
<p>Like he lifts weights,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do any other sort of training,</p>
<p>does like a very classic,</p>
<p>not training program, but kind of training.</p>
<p>And they were sort of bantering back and forth for a while.</p>
<p>And basically she was saying, you&rsquo;re so unfit,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t run at all.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s saying, you&rsquo;re so weak, you can&rsquo;t do a pull-up.</p>
<p>And so they challenged each other to a competition.</p>
<p>They said at the end of the year,</p>
<p>the girl is going to do 26 pull-ups</p>
<p>and the guy had to run a marathon, so 26 miles.</p>
<p>So that was the thing.</p>
<p>And then there was some sort of consequence</p>
<p>for whoever sort of failed it.</p>
<p>So the guy quickly tried to figure out</p>
<p>how the hell am I going to run 26 miles</p>
<p>when I have not run a mile in like many, many, many years.</p>
<p>So he just started running,</p>
<p>you know, three miles, four miles or whatever.</p>
<p>She, well, of course they,</p>
<p>both of them ran immediately to me, right?</p>
<p>And then she was like, how the hell I can&rsquo;t do a pull-up.</p>
<p>And I was like, great.</p>
<p>And I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol.</p>
<p>And she was like, whoa,</p>
<p>I want to go to the assisted pull-up machine</p>
<p>and work on doing like sets of 25</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve got to get my muscular endurance up.</p>
<p>And I tried to explain to her,</p>
<p>your muscular endurance is irrelevant if you can&rsquo;t do one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never going to matter.</p>
<p>She did the muscular endurance protocol,</p>
<p>the entire thing, didn&rsquo;t listen to me.</p>
<p>The end of the year came</p>
<p>and she still produced exactly zero pull-ups.</p>
<p>So point is, if you look at muscular endurance,</p>
<p>where is it strength</p>
<p>and where is it actually muscular endurance?</p>
<p>The general sort of number that you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>is under like 80%, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to tell you,</p>
<p>is this a muscular endurance problem</p>
<p>or is this an absolute strength problem?</p>
<p>Under 80% of the one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>Yep, so what I mean by that is this.</p>
<p>In fact, this actually leads into your question.</p>
<p>The other way to assess muscular endurance</p>
<p>is take the exact strength tests you did</p>
<p>from the talk five minutes ago.</p>
<p>Which one did you do?</p>
<p>Load that to 75%</p>
<p>and then do that for as many repetitions as you can.</p>
<p>And that is a tremendous barometer</p>
<p>of muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So if you were able to do 200 pounds</p>
<p>on your leg extension test,</p>
<p>put 75% on that and do that as many reps as you can.</p>
<p>You want to look for more than eight repetitions.</p>
<p>If you are below eight repetitions,</p>
<p>then we have a muscular endurance problem, right?</p>
<p>If it is higher than that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got 15 or 20,</p>
<p>then we know we have probably some problems</p>
<p>in your peak strength or the test itself.</p>
<p>So that is a good eight to 12 sort of number</p>
<p>is where you want to be looking at for there.</p>
<p>What about anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s more challenging.</p>
<p>You either have to go to a laboratory</p>
<p>and do something like a wind gate test.</p>
<p>So this is a 30 second maximal test</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna see how much work</p>
<p>can you possibly do in that 30 seconds.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of access to a laboratory,</p>
<p>you can do this on any protocol you want.</p>
<p>This could be sprinting.</p>
<p>This can be on like an air bike.</p>
<p>This could be on a rower.</p>
<p>Anything where you can exert maximal effort</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about technical problems.</p>
<p>So I generally don&rsquo;t like to do things</p>
<p>like a kettlebell swing or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many other variables.</p>
<p>You need to be able to go as hard as you possibly can,</p>
<p>knowing you&rsquo;re going to get to a place</p>
<p>of tremendous fatigue.</p>
<p>Now in the lab,</p>
<p>we often use what&rsquo;s called a Bosco protocol.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna stand on a force plate</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do as many vertical jumps</p>
<p>as fast as you can, as high as you can for 60 seconds.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re absolutely destroyed by like second 45.</p>
<p>So we either use that Wingate protocol</p>
<p>or that Bosco protocol.</p>
<p>If you want though, again,</p>
<p>take any of those other places,</p>
<p>30 seconds or so, up to 45 seconds,</p>
<p>up to a minute if you want.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>And you just mark down the distance you cover.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really have standards for these things</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be different.</p>
<p>How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill</p>
<p>is just gonna be so different than sprinting in the field</p>
<p>or on the assault bike or whatever.</p>
<p>So what you really wanna worry about there</p>
<p>is can you complete it?</p>
<p>And then how awful do you feel afterwards?</p>
<p>So what you really wanna think about here</p>
<p>is not those protocols, but this.</p>
<p>You wanna think about,</p>
<p>can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate?</p>
<p>So the number we throw out is 220 minus your age.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re 50 years old, 220 minus 50,</p>
<p>you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate</p>
<p>of around 170 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Now, that number is extremely generic.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get there,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have any indication of your fitness.</p>
<p>If you get higher, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re any more fit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a rough number.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I want you to do.</p>
<p>In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric.</p>
<p>So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate</p>
<p>and then test your heart rate recovery.</p>
<p>And what you should be looking for there</p>
<p>is about a half a beat recovery per second.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna get up to a place</p>
<p>where you reach like absolute terrible exhaustion,</p>
<p>maximum fatigue, test your heart rate,</p>
<p>and then count, have a timer going.</p>
<p>Within 60 seconds,</p>
<p>you should have again at half a beat per second,</p>
<p>you should have a heart rate recovery</p>
<p>of 30 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Within the next minute,</p>
<p>so two minute recovery,</p>
<p>it should be in half that, so 60 beats.</p>
<p>Those are rough numbers to go by.</p>
<p>And your three minute recovery is again, half of that again.</p>
<p>So that is the closest way.</p>
<p>If your heart rate recovery is worse than that,</p>
<p>then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity</p>
<p>or your cardiovascular capacity.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>What about number eight, maximal heart rate?</p>
<p>Because what you just described</p>
<p>sounds a lot like maximal heart rate.</p>
<p>So this is your VO2 max.</p>
<p>So the gold standard here is to actually go into a laboratory</p>
<p>and get this thing done.</p>
<p>So we can actually run a VO2 max test</p>
<p>where you put a mask on,</p>
<p>collect all your gases and run you to there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very specific protocol</p>
<p>for completion of a true maximum test.</p>
<p>And any of the scientists will know that.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to that,</p>
<p>you can do a couple of tests.</p>
<p>One of them is called a 12 minute Cooper&rsquo;s test.</p>
<p>So this is simply time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna run for 12 minutes as far as you can,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna record the distance you covered.</p>
<p>Again, you can go online to any number of calculators,</p>
<p>enter that distance in,</p>
<p>and that will tell you your estimated VO2 max.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a 12 minute sprint?</p>
<p>12 minute sprint.</p>
<p>Maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Keeping a steady pace the whole time or going-</p>
<p>Do whatever you want.</p>
<p>The goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s anywhere between a mile to two plus miles,</p>
<p>depending on how fit you are.</p>
<p>But you just do that Cooper 12 minute test.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I told you.</p>
<p>And so if you remember,</p>
<p>aerobic capacity is eight to 12 sort of minutes</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna see a real true test of that VO2 max.</p>
<p>You simply can&rsquo;t get that in under a few minutes.</p>
<p>So it is a, if you want,</p>
<p>you can do a little gentler version of that.</p>
<p>So there are a number of sub-maximal tests there.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a one mile walk test you can do.</p>
<p>So again, all you&rsquo;re going to do is,</p>
<p>in this case, you have to have some sort of</p>
<p>either a stopwatch or ideally a heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>And all you have to do is,</p>
<p>this is a Rockport one mile sub-maximal test.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna walk a mile, record the time,</p>
<p>record your heart rate at the end,</p>
<p>enter those in, and those will give you,</p>
<p>again, estimates of your VO2 max.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the like, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>Or we have a lot of these in our executive program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, my knee hurts too bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got back pain when I run or whatever.</p>
<p>Can I, okay.</p>
<p>And you do the walk test.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty accurate if you do it correctly.</p>
<p>So technically all you have to actually do</p>
<p>is measure your heart rate on your,</p>
<p>you know, and I can count 60 seconds,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just easier to work</p>
<p>with everyone&rsquo;s watches and stuff now,</p>
<p>just wear a heart rate monitor, plug in those numbers.</p>
<p>And again, those are all standard calculations.</p>
<p>So anywhere you find those,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the source.</p>
<p>So you just enter your stuff in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be running off the same equation.</p>
<p>I like the idea of the 12 minute run.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give it a shot.</p>
<p>See what happens.</p>
<p>For years, we did a one mile version of this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a lot more science</p>
<p>on the 12 minute Cooper test.</p>
<p>So we did that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>And it is not even remotely close to fun.</p>
<p>It sounds like fun for other reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it is.</p>
<p>Fun in the sense that it reveals a lot.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Powerful, potent.</p>
<p>Super.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hiding.</p>
<p>You can hide with a leg extension test.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that bad.</p>
<p>But you cannot feel anything,</p>
<p>but the 12 minute run as far as you can test.</p>
<p>So these are really actually psychiatric diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Of sorts.</p>
<p>Number nine, long duration, steady state exercise.</p>
<p>I think of this as AKA endurance,</p>
<p>but as you mentioned before,</p>
<p>there are other forms of endurance.</p>
<p>So long duration, steady state exercise.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So you really wanna think about this</p>
<p>as not a standard number.</p>
<p>This is you should maintain consistent work output</p>
<p>for over 20 plus minutes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And this one, I want you to just pick something</p>
<p>that it was in your lifestyle.</p>
<p>So is there a loop around your house that you can do?</p>
<p>Is there some protocol that you like to use for?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re simply going to test your ability.</p>
<p>Can you maintain work without stopping?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it needs to be.</p>
<p>Now, ideally, I personally like to throw</p>
<p>a little twist in here,</p>
<p>which is, can you do this with nasal breathing only?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I feel really good.</p>
<p>If you can go 30 straight minutes</p>
<p>without needing to take a break,</p>
<p>walking doesn&rsquo;t really cut it</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re very, very unfit.</p>
<p>In which case, if walking 30 minutes</p>
<p>without a break is a challenge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like there.</p>
<p>But if you can, I want you moving at a non-walking pace.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what zone this is.</p>
<p>Two, three, four, five.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes</p>
<p>of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime.</p>
<p>And again, ideally breathing through your nose only.</p>
<p>I love this list, but it worries me a bit.</p>
<p>Not because any one of these tests</p>
<p>is necessarily that overwhelming,</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;m unclear about how to arrange</p>
<p>performance of these different tests.</p>
<p>For instance, do I separate them?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing one test, like long duration output on one day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing strength on another day.</p>
<p>Those seem pretty obvious to me,</p>
<p>but are there ones that one can combine on different days?</p>
<p>How much time should one give oneself</p>
<p>in between these tests?</p>
<p>And how often should one do an assessment?</p>
<p>Just as we don&rsquo;t want to necessarily</p>
<p>evaluate body weight changes</p>
<p>by getting on the scale three times a day,</p>
<p>maybe once a day at the same time,</p>
<p>each day is more practical.</p>
<p>How often should we be assessing our fitness</p>
<p>for each and every one of these?</p>
<p>Well, the way that I would say this is</p>
<p>you want to pick the one that is the worst</p>
<p>and do that more frequently.</p>
<p>So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test</p>
<p>and you are fantastic,</p>
<p>if you can bench press double your body weight,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to test your bench very often</p>
<p>for the average person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a power lifter,</p>
<p>like maybe once a year or something,</p>
<p>maybe not even that.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t need to get there.</p>
<p>However, if we then test your VO2 max</p>
<p>and in your 12 minutes,</p>
<p>you cover a total of a half a mile,</p>
<p>then like we might want to test that every month, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to let our priorities emphasize</p>
<p>which one we&rsquo;re going to do more often.</p>
<p>I would recommend doing this full battery once a year.</p>
<p>Full battery mean the entire list on one day?</p>
<p>The entire, not on one day, but within a week.</p>
<p>So you could take a week.</p>
<p>Now you could do these technically all in two days.</p>
<p>Three day split here is probably best.</p>
<p>So if you were to just say,</p>
<p>hey, this is like testing week.</p>
<p>I actually love this for beginning of the year</p>
<p>or whenever it is that you sort of change your training.</p>
<p>But I think once a year, just like once a year,</p>
<p>you should probably go to a physician</p>
<p>and get full blood work,</p>
<p>a full heart scan and everything like that.</p>
<p>And then if maybe you had a heart issue,</p>
<p>they would come back and test you more frequently,</p>
<p>whatever the case is, right?</p>
<p>You should probably run through this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be thinking,</p>
<p>yeah, but I don&rsquo;t want to like give up</p>
<p>on my exercise routine that week.</p>
<p>Well, I promise you, you&rsquo;re not going to finish this week</p>
<p>and think I didn&rsquo;t do very much work this week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to feel great.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to have a very nice barometer</p>
<p>of exactly where you need to change</p>
<p>and prioritize your training</p>
<p>for the next quarter or half a year</p>
<p>or wherever you want to go.</p>
<p>If you want to actually do this every six months,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really, we end up actually doing this quite honestly,</p>
<p>like more like every six months as a general test.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good way to do it.</p>
<p>But if minimum, if you&rsquo;re arguing with me,</p>
<p>give me once a year, you want to do this.</p>
<p>So which order to do them in?</p>
<p>The non-fatiguing tests you can do whenever.</p>
<p>So this is the body composition scan,</p>
<p>the FFMI, the body fat composition,</p>
<p>all this stuff can be done wherever.</p>
<p>I generally like to do that though</p>
<p>as your very first activity.</p>
<p>The reason is we know that acute exercise</p>
<p>can heavily influence things</p>
<p>like body composition measurements</p>
<p>because of inflammation, water storage, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easiest to just sort of get that</p>
<p>off of a 48 hour rest.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you don&rsquo;t do any hard exercise</p>
<p>the day before a body composition test</p>
<p>and probably 48 hours before that.</p>
<p>So just start yourself off with that.</p>
<p>Your movement tests can be the same thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to try to do a assessment</p>
<p>of how well you&rsquo;re squatting</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re incredibly sore from your brutal squatting test.</p>
<p>So tend to do those things when you&rsquo;re the most fresh.</p>
<p>Then what you want to do is any skill</p>
<p>or maximum strength or power</p>
<p>goes at the very beginning of the day.</p>
<p>Any fatiguing thing happens at the end.</p>
<p>And so you could easily do this.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m going to do my power test, my broad jump.</p>
<p>Great, you&rsquo;re not gonna be fatigued at all from that.</p>
<p>And on the same day, since I&rsquo;m already pretty warmed up,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m gonna roll right into my leg strength test.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;m really warmed up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do my leg muscular endurance test right there.</p>
<p>So this is a very common strategy we use.</p>
<p>We do our one rep max leg extension,</p>
<p>five minutes, seven minutes, whatever we need to do.</p>
<p>Come back, load it to 75%, do as many reps as you can.</p>
<p>Boom, you could roll right into then your upper body test</p>
<p>or your grip strength test</p>
<p>or anything else that you want to do there.</p>
<p>Is there a little bit of influence?</p>
<p>Yeah, but really for most people, it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>What influence I mean, if you do a leg strength test,</p>
<p>coming back and doing that upper body strength test</p>
<p>afterwards, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p>Give yourself 15, give yourself 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Keep it plenty of time.</p>
<p>So you can knock out your strength testing</p>
<p>and muscular endurance testing all in one day.</p>
<p>That could be, you could do your performance,</p>
<p>your skill diagnostic, your power jump test,</p>
<p>your strength and your muscular endurance</p>
<p>and all that stuff is knocked out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to come back on a separate day</p>
<p>and do your anaerobic test.</p>
<p>This is 30 seconds, maximum endurance, things like that.</p>
<p>You could though, if you wanted,</p>
<p>do that after your long duration tests.</p>
<p>Your long duration test is again,</p>
<p>is just going to function as like a big warmup</p>
<p>or you could flip those things</p>
<p>or you can do them on separate days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to do your VO2 max test</p>
<p>on its own day for the most part,</p>
<p>unless you wanted to do again your movement</p>
<p>or your body composition sort of before those things.</p>
<p>So you really have the ability to kind of mix and match.</p>
<p>Ideally, this most realistically probably takes three days.</p>
<p>If you want to separate them into four or five,</p>
<p>the more separation you do,</p>
<p>the better data you&rsquo;re going to get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of like how pedantic</p>
<p>are you really trying to get here?</p>
<p>And are you willing to lose 5% to then save a whole day?</p>
<p>Then you can do sort of these things in multiple stacks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I would break it up.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m hearing is better to do it than to not do it.</p>
<p>Most definitely.</p>
<p>And be rational.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and do your strength output late in the day</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fatigued.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to combine some of the steady state endurance</p>
<p>and maximal heart rate, fine.</p>
<p>Understand there might be a slight deficit there,</p>
<p>but test it the same way each time.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re really looking for is improvement.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And you could also do the heart rate recovery</p>
<p>under any of the modalities.</p>
<p>So you could do the heart rate recovery</p>
<p>after your VO2 max as well.</p>
<p>So you finish that thing and then just again,</p>
<p>do the same test for up to three minutes.</p>
<p>These are fantastic tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost tempted to say that I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to post my numbers,</p>
<p>but that actually violates the core principle</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re getting at here,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s highly unlikely</p>
<p>that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly there will be individuals that are,</p>
<p>but based on everything we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>specificity of training and how extensively</p>
<p>somebody has been training a certain way</p>
<p>will without question lopside them, if you will,</p>
<p>toward being better in some of these assessments</p>
<p>and less good in others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just simply the way that these adaptations work.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, you don&rsquo;t need to be optimal</p>
<p>in all of these areas to be quote unquote optimal health</p>
<p>from this perspective.</p>
<p>You just want to make sure, again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no severe performance anchors.</p>
<p>This is what we call them, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want any of these severe constraints</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to get limited by that thing.</p>
<p>And so what you want to do is move that up</p>
<p>to just sufficient or concerning, right?</p>
<p>And get it away from that.</p>
<p>If you do that, that thing&rsquo;s not going to catch you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be able to continue to pursue optimization</p>
<p>in any of the one things</p>
<p>that you have a specific passion for,</p>
<p>which is generally what moves people, right?</p>
<p>You train so that you feel better.</p>
<p>You train because you know there are all these benefits</p>
<p>to it and geez, this audience probably</p>
<p>could list hundreds of them,</p>
<p>but you also train because you generally like</p>
<p>to get better at something.</p>
<p>A lot of us like have something.</p>
<p>And so you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re not going,</p>
<p>hey, I know you&rsquo;re good at endurance,</p>
<p>but you really shouldn&rsquo;t train anymore.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that message, not at all.</p>
<p>I want you to love your training.</p>
<p>We just want to make sure that you&rsquo;re not loving</p>
<p>that so much that you&rsquo;re not taking some blinders off</p>
<p>and missing another area, which would actually,</p>
<p>again, you pull that performance anchor,</p>
<p>this whole ship sails faster</p>
<p>with less effort and less friction.</p>
<p>What I love about this is also that as you&rsquo;ve described it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just for athletes</p>
<p>or people that are super into fitness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also for people that just want to be healthy</p>
<p>and want aesthetic changes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>which I think accounts for a really large percentage</p>
<p>of people out there.</p>
<p>So I think what you described is incredibly well-structured,</p>
<p>incredibly clear and incredibly actionable.</p>
<p>So I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious about my willingness to do this.</p>
<p>And at least share those numbers with you.</p>
<p>And I think for most people that are seeking</p>
<p>what you listed off before,</p>
<p>aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that all nine of these are going to be important</p>
<p>in some regard or another.</p>
<p>So before we close out,</p>
<p>I want to go back and finish off the metrics for VO2 max,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t actually think I gave you numbers on that.</p>
<p>So in general, for men,</p>
<p>a minimum number we want to look at here</p>
<p>is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute.</p>
<p>And for women, that&rsquo;d be about 30.</p>
<p>So we can actually push a lot higher on those things.</p>
<p>In reality, I want to see men above 50.</p>
<p>If I could just interrupt you for a second,</p>
<p>when you say 40 milliliters per kilogram,</p>
<p>milliliters of what specifically?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what actually those metrics mean</p>
<p>is the first one, milliliters, is oxygen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s amount of oxygen.</p>
<p>Kilograms is body weight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s how much oxygen can you bring in</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight per minute.</p>
<p>So it is a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration.</p>
<p>In fact, the way that you calculate it</p>
<p>is you multiply your cardiac output</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s called your AVO2 difference.</p>
<p>Your cardiac output is your heart rate</p>
<p>times your stroke volume.</p>
<p>So how much blood you&rsquo;re pumping out per pump</p>
<p>is your stroke volume.</p>
<p>How many times you&rsquo;re pumping or you&rsquo;re beating,</p>
<p>you multiply that by your AVO2 difference.</p>
<p>The AVO2 difference is artery minus vein difference.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the amount of oxygen in your arteries</p>
<p>minus the amount of oxygen in your vein,</p>
<p>which is gonna tell you how much you took up</p>
<p>in your capillaries and your muscles.</p>
<p>So you take those two factors, multiply them together,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s your VO2 max.</p>
<p>You know, as you were describing that,</p>
<p>I imagine you getting to an fMRI machine</p>
<p>and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain</p>
<p>because clearly it&rsquo;s committed to memory very well.</p>
<p>Thank you for that clear description.</p>
<p>Yeah, so to finish those numbers,</p>
<p>I really truly wanna see a man above 50.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even really stoked until I get above 55.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s sort of funny, Dave Kostel,</p>
<p>whose lab I did my PhD in, he was retired by the time,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s again one of these legendary figures</p>
<p>in exercise sociology, started in the 70s.</p>
<p>He would always say there&rsquo;s no human excuse to be below 60,</p>
<p>which I was always like, damn,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s really actually pretty hard to get to.</p>
<p>Was he at 60 or above?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still actually setting world records</p>
<p>like in these last couple of years</p>
<p>and is like all the master&rsquo;s records for swimming</p>
<p>and cycling and stuff.</p>
<p>So he was a super, super fit guy.</p>
<p>So he was always above 60.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably like 50 something now,</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s 80 or whatever.</p>
<p>80 years old.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With a VO2 max of 50.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably really not 50, he&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s probably going to remember that earlier</p>
<p>in the, we talked about how I had the 92 year old</p>
<p>by the VO2 max of 38.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s probably gonna break that record when he gets there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, in fact, I guarantee you</p>
<p>he has that number in his brain.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked to him in 15 years,</p>
<p>but I guarantee you that number is in his brain</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s probably training for it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I love it because it proves that exercise pays off.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few things in life</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a direct relationship</p>
<p>between work and outcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s as Henry Rollins described</p>
<p>in his wonderful essay, if you&rsquo;re familiar with that.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, you&rsquo;re a punk rock guy.</p>
<p>You know, Henry, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I certainly know who he is and I know his work.</p>
<p>An incredible one page paper</p>
<p>sort of something to do with the iron.</p>
<p>And he basically describes that as like,</p>
<p>this is the one thing where it&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>Like it is the most true thing you&rsquo;ll ever do,</p>
<p>which is I love for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a principle of nature.</p>
<p>A hundred percent, yeah.</p>
<p>So with the women, I really want to see the women.</p>
<p>If I want to see men above 55,</p>
<p>I really want to see women above 50 as the target.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be like, you&rsquo;re there, I&rsquo;m pretty good.</p>
<p>So you can do the math on then the middle ground</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s like, okay, but we need to work on it.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look across the literature</p>
<p>at different athletes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see like the really high level</p>
<p>endurance folks.</p>
<p>You know, they may pass 70 or 80.</p>
<p>In fact, there was talk a few years ago</p>
<p>of a guy breaking a hundred.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an 18 or 19 year old,</p>
<p>but I actually don&rsquo;t think it was ever</p>
<p>fully confirmed or repeated,</p>
<p>but certainly you&rsquo;ll see plenty of people like 95</p>
<p>in those extremes.</p>
<p>If you look at other sports like football or basketball,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably going to be in the 55, 65 sort of range.</p>
<p>So if you as an average person are 55,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good marker to be in.</p>
<p>If you get even close to that, you&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I let you down, Dave.</p>
<p>I just love how you&rsquo;re describing this average person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy.</p>
<p>Like if you reach the standard of average, Andrew,</p>
<p>listen, you&rsquo;re giving me prompts all over the place</p>
<p>to try and improve my metrics, whatever they happen to be.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the great values</p>
<p>of getting objective numbers.</p>
<p>Even if they have to be measured</p>
<p>by some of these back of the envelope techniques</p>
<p>that, you know, I guess we always teach people</p>
<p>in the laboratory, right?</p>
<p>That a tool can be not extremely precise,</p>
<p>but as long as it&rsquo;s reliable,</p>
<p>there is still value there.</p>
<p>I mean, of course you&rsquo;d love to have the most precise</p>
<p>and most reliable tool, but if you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then at least go for a reliable tool</p>
<p>and measure for consistency.</p>
<p>Yet for the real world, reliability beats validity</p>
<p>as much as we can.</p>
<p>For a lot of things we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>especially if we&rsquo;re using it as a metric of,</p>
<p>did I get better?</p>
<p>As long as that tool is reliable.</p>
<p>Body composition, just all of these things</p>
<p>have inherent error in them.</p>
<p>Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger,</p>
<p>but as you mentioned, having standardization</p>
<p>within the testing protocol</p>
<p>is gonna allow you to measure progress.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna tell you sort of where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve sort of covered</p>
<p>all these areas of adaptation,</p>
<p>we walked through the history</p>
<p>and we walked through a bunch of the explanations</p>
<p>for why people are maybe not getting the results</p>
<p>that they wanna get through their training.</p>
<p>The way I would like to go</p>
<p>with the rest of our conversations</p>
<p>would be to just go through each of those adaptations</p>
<p>step-by-step and make sure I cover very specific protocols</p>
<p>for if you have run through this testing</p>
<p>and identified an area of weakness.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;ve sort of been lifting a lot</p>
<p>because you like lifting</p>
<p>and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness</p>
<p>or your heart rate recovery</p>
<p>is not where it really should be.</p>
<p>Or the opposite, like we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re doing a lot of that type of work</p>
<p>and your strength isn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>your movement quality is not there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve identified a problem.</p>
<p>How do I specifically solve it?</p>
<p>What are the evidence-based and most effective protocols</p>
<p>that I could put myself in for each one of these categories?</p>
<p>And I think that would give people a lot of take-home value,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna take us some time to cover.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna have to come across</p>
<p>over multiple conversations between you and I.</p>
<p>Great, well, I&rsquo;m looking forward</p>
<p>to each and all of those conversations.</p>
<p>And I want to add just one more metric</p>
<p>to our discussion today,</p>
<p>which is really just my way of saying thank you.</p>
<p>Because if there were a metric</p>
<p>for amount of useful information per sentence spoke,</p>
<p>you would be at the upper level of that metric.</p>
<p>You have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge</p>
<p>in a clear and concise and today listed out format</p>
<p>that is both interesting, grounded in science</p>
<p>and actionable.</p>
<p>So on behalf of everyone listening</p>
<p>and certainly for myself as well,</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate the compliments</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next conversation,</p>
<p>jumping right into speed, strength and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>and what are the evidence-based and best practices</p>
<p>for protocols in those areas.</p>
