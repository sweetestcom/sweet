    <p>Listen up, listener.</p>
<p>We have a special guest in our pre-show today and it is my favorite son, my soulmate, my</p>
<p>companion like none other, Tubbers.</p>
<p>Little Tubbers couldn&rsquo;t be separated from mama.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in my lap and he wanted to be on the podcast today.</p>
<p>And we have received some messages on the social media of people saying, I&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>with not seeing Tubbers.</p>
<p>And so today is their day.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And you know, we also have received some messages on social media claiming that you are the</p>
<p>real star of the podcast.</p>
<p>So in that vein, I&rsquo;m going to let the real star tell us what she&rsquo;s had it with.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is people filming themselves crying and posting it on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m going to cry, I&rsquo;m going to record myself, and then I&rsquo;m going to post it for</p>
<p>sympathy.</p>
<p>I mean, I cannot wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>Are you getting this in your like for you feed?</p>
<p>Like with the mukbang?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it just came up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s TikTok.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, that was the offender.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, why is this happening?</p>
<p>Who would do this?</p>
<p>I mean, of course, they&rsquo;re exponentially younger, like 20s, young, young, maybe even younger</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ve also seen specifically where Emily has sent me somebody that I know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>posted about herself crying.</p>
<p>And I just, I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>Is there no decorum or etiquette?</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s such a, pardon the pun, cry for help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a cry for attention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that is so pathetic.</p>
<p>It is so pathetic, especially when it&rsquo;s like, my boyfriend broke up with me, so now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to record myself crying.</p>
<p>Like bitch, have some pride.</p>
<p>I think people are just doing too many things on the internet.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, the oversharing is out of control.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>There are people that are like crying and they&rsquo;re holding up like pieces of paper and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I just, and then they do another page, found out my mom has breast cancer and</p>
<p>they keep doing the pages when they could just speak, but they do it via, you know,</p>
<p>like- I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>Love Actually, where the guy does it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s adorable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a movie and it&rsquo;s fiction and it never happened, but people are doing this</p>
<p>on the internet, like, you know, to bring awareness to maybe an earthquake or hurricane</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing the cards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>I just completely would not even watch till the end because I&rsquo;m like, if you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>me within the first few seconds, I don&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If I have to go through 47 card changes to find out why you&rsquo;re upset.</p>
<p>I also have seen where it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m feeling really lonely today, if you could give me</p>
<p>a shout out, that&rsquo;d make me feel better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, is that necessary to say you&rsquo;re feeling lonely and ask for random strangers</p>
<p>to say hi?</p>
<p>And does that help?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about when people just randomly post, like, I&rsquo;m going through a lot, pray</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all they tell you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re dying for you to direct message and ask.</p>
<p>Tubby has left the podcast, everybody.</p>
<p>No more tubs in the chair.</p>
<p>When people post something super cryptic, like everybody pray for my sister.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going through a lot.</p>
<p>See, I think that is just, you are dying for somebody to reach out and say, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Like your friends that have your number or people on direct message that you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, the problem with that is, is when I see something like that, that I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>mutual friends, I&rsquo;m clicking on the people that comment on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what happened.</p>
<p>Because you need to know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re putting it out there.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s chicken shit to not just say what it is that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to control and make the attention last longer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they get more attention of, oh my gosh, what&rsquo;s wrong, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And all the comments are the same.</p>
<p>You can do it or I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>Just like stupid shit.</p>
<p>Prayer warriors unite.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like if something&rsquo;s going on, if it&rsquo;s super juicy, that&rsquo;s all the more reason</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to go to the internet, just go ahead and take it over the finish line.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Take it over the finish line.</p>
<p>Please pray for me.</p>
<p>My husband, I just busted my husband with a bunch of cocaine and a prostitute.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for landing the plane and for not being cryptic about this because now</p>
<p>we all know what the fuck is going on and that frees up the rest of my day and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to deep dive into Facebook or Instagram or whatever it is to figure out what the hell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think those kinds of posts are designed to keep people asking what the problem is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a total and complete attention seeking behavior.</p>
<p>It just amazes me how much people feel like they need to share online with other people.</p>
<p>Like crying.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the number one example.</p>
<p>It is too much.</p>
<p>It is too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>I mean, I only cry maybe like once a year.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m dead serious about that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not a crier either.</p>
<p>I just, it takes a lot for me to cry.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;m going to think about when I&rsquo;m crying is filming it.</p>
<p>Getting a phone and filming it, making sure I look cute.</p>
<p>I mean, that is ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bananas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bananas.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with this racket.</p>
<p>And it is a total fucking scam perpetrated on the American public every single day.</p>
<p>And it is breaking news.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, I hate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not breaking if you&rsquo;ve been talking about it for five hours.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s abused.</p>
<p>It is abused.</p>
<p>So much that I&rsquo;m so desensitized from what breaking news actually is.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>And all of the news channels do it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And everything is breaking news.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s breaking news.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing breaking about it because like when I get up in the morning, I would</p>
<p>turn it on.</p>
<p>And then that night I would turn on the news.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still saying breaking news.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve had 12 hours.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>It cannot still be breaking news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get an alert on my phone and it says breaking news and I don&rsquo;t even really look</p>
<p>at it anymore because I know it&rsquo;s a blowhard event.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total blowhard event that is a nothing burger.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I absolutely could not agree more.</p>
<p>I do think that CNN got a bunch of backlash on always having the breaking news and supposedly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re better.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know because I don&rsquo;t watch them anymore.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I only watch the BBC and it&rsquo;s only breaking if it&rsquo;s major.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s breaking if a war starts or it&rsquo;s breaking if somebody dies.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or a presidential election is called.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It is not breaking for a week.</p>
<p>Donald Trump sends a 3 a.m. tweet.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not breaking news.</p>
<p>Like breathing oxygen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, it just was not breaking news.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, I am just up to my eyeballs with the American news system.</p>
<p>So I want to welcome everybody to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>And I am a minor supporting player in this podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>The real star is Angie.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>Why are you acting that way?</p>
<p>That was two comments.</p>
<p>The real star is Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps.</p>
<p>This is I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, a podcast where you can visit twice weekly and get all the</p>
<p>shit off your chest so that when you go back out into the real world, you&rsquo;re nicer and</p>
<p>calmer and ready.</p>
<p>You can get all your bitches out.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And know that you are amongst your people.</p>
<p>This is a dump truck of petty grievances via a mass therapy session.</p>
<p>Because one thing that we oppose fundamentally is the statement, you can find positivity</p>
<p>in everything.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>There are some things that are so insufferable, the only option you have is to get with friends</p>
<p>and bitch about it.</p>
<p>And bitch.</p>
<p>And that is therapeutic.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>I have a story I haven&rsquo;t even told you.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>So I went to a deal at my youngest school.</p>
<p>They had a speaker that was talking about being congenial and high character.</p>
<p>And she starts going into when I go to the grocery store, I always ask the checker how</p>
<p>their day&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>I asked the bagger how their day&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>I chat with the people in front of me and behind me in the grocery line.</p>
<p>And the whole time I&rsquo;m breaking out in high school, please never let me have to go to</p>
<p>the grocery store with her.</p>
<p>This is a classic not taking into account the feelings of the checker, the bagger.</p>
<p>None of them.</p>
<p>And the people in line.</p>
<p>And she thinks, you know what she is?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a bragger, fake do-gooder.</p>
<p>And assuming that everybody wants her to ask them how they are, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that she&rsquo;s doing them a favor by doing so.</p>
<p>This is faux do-gooder shit.</p>
<p>Faux do-gooder.</p>
<p>Faux do-gooder shit.</p>
<p>And she is a problem, a huge problem for every grocery store that she enters.</p>
<p>Like, she&rsquo;s like the person you want to avoid in a grocery store.</p>
<p>The last thing I want somebody to do when I&rsquo;m in line at the checkout counter is to</p>
<p>turn around and chit-chat with me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anything worse.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what would be worse.</p>
<p>I just imagined it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, you&rsquo;re trying to get your groceries checked, and she&rsquo;s yak-mouthing</p>
<p>with the checker about something no one cares about.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re waiting on her to be quote-unquote congenial.</p>
<p>With her fake do-gooder shit.</p>
<p>Fake do-gooder.</p>
<p>I wanted to stand up in the middle of the auditorium and go, bitch, nobody wants to</p>
<p>talk to you.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because I am the beacon of the high road.</p>
<p>I think it is an immediate red flag when somebody tells you what a great fucking person they</p>
<p>are based on their behavior in a grocery store.</p>
<p>You know, like that is an immediate, you know she&rsquo;s fucked up immediately.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe that somebody would think that this person should be a public speaker.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, like let me tell you kids, here&rsquo;s the trick to life.</p>
<p>Be nice to people in grocery stores.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my problem with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a given.</p>
<p>Be nice to everybody.</p>
<p>You should not have to tell people to be nice to people in grocery stores because that should</p>
<p>be your default setting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It should also be your default setting not to start chit-chatting and hold up the line</p>
<p>and do all that nonsense in a grocery store.</p>
<p>You can very kindly look at the checker and say, hey, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re scanning your items.</p>
<p>Scan your card.</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p>
<p>Move on down the road.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Have a great week.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to have a guest and this guest is going to talk to us about pop culture</p>
<p>and all of the fuckery that&rsquo;s going on on Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go ahead and bring out Amanda Hirsch.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hello, Amanda.</p>
<p>We would like to welcome you to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to learn pop culture stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>I loved the concept of your pod.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;ve had it with so much shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minefield of had it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I mean, there is just so much shit that happens when you go out on the internet in public</p>
<p>to an airport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minefield of fuckery that can go down.</p>
<p>We consider this place a holy place where you can come and dump all of this stuff out</p>
<p>in a very therapeutic way so that when you have to go back out into the world again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kinder and lighter and a better person having done this dump truck of petty grievances</p>
<p>with us.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And so does that mean you don&rsquo;t get people who are like, you know, annoying about things</p>
<p>you complain about?</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t tell you that you&rsquo;re, you know, privileged and that you&rsquo;re complaining</p>
<p>about things.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>We get all kinds of stuff like on Tik Tok and everything.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, Amanda.</p>
<p>I was the most hated woman on Tik Tok because I&rsquo;m like women, adult women that baby talk</p>
<p>are ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, huge backlash.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your position on women that baby talk?</p>
<p>Wait to a baby or like to a grown up to an adult, to another adult, not a pet, not a</p>
<p>child or a baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with baby talk with a pet or a baby, but like, I don&rsquo;t think that men and women</p>
<p>need to talk and baby talk.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>And you got real backlash.</p>
<p>No, this is why I need to stay away from Tik Tok.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it&rsquo;s not the place for me.</p>
<p>And I have been, you know, like old people that don&rsquo;t want to like conform to the times</p>
<p>and like stay with their Nokia phones.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m like, Tik Tok is just, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get me.</p>
<p>Like I just signed up like a week ago.</p>
<p>My algorithm still doesn&rsquo;t get me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s showing me women putting on concealer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why does it think that this is what I want to see?</p>
<p>Like, and everyone&rsquo;s like, the algorithm will get you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s not getting me.</p>
<p>So what do I think?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s creepy.</p>
<p>I am not into it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think, you made me think if I baby talk my baby and I don&rsquo;t even think I</p>
<p>baby talk my baby.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s get to what you have had it with.</p>
<p>And I think that you just tapped into it, which is this makeup tutorials, which we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of had it with acronyms too, but I&rsquo;m going to teach you a new one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the GRWM.</p>
<p>Amanda, I&rsquo;m going to let you take it from here.</p>
<p>Teach the old lady what this is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is.</p>
<p>First of all, I feel like this is really a safe space for me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s get ready with me.</p>
<p>It took me forever to even have the motivation and the, you know, to care enough to Google</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Cause at first I was like, groom, like I didn&rsquo;t get what it meant.</p>
<p>And I had a friend came on my podcast.</p>
<p>She said she thought it meant like grown woman, like a acronym for a woman.</p>
<p>So for some reason I was saying about my algorithm and I feel like a lot of these people that</p>
<p>get famous on Tik TOK, part of what they do is just like, so it used to be a makeup tutorial.</p>
<p>It used to be like, okay, this is what I use.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re a fucking idiot and don&rsquo;t know how to apply mascara here, I&rsquo;m showing</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>So that alone, stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The new thing.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s hopping on this trend is like they put the headband.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s either the headband with like little ears to be cute or it&rsquo;s like these clips.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I have them right here.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, these clips.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>These clips.</p>
<p>I had to get them.</p>
<p>See how fucking influenced.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to do with them.</p>
<p>Um, they&rsquo;re supposed to like, just make your hair go away from your face to like put on</p>
<p>makeup or whatever.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s like these people are doing the same thing, but they&rsquo;re talking to you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing shit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like trauma, you know, not about the makeup, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not cool anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s passe to talk about what you&rsquo;re doing and be like, this is my concealer.</p>
<p>This is my, you know, I shout out now it&rsquo;s like, so this guy was, you know, dating and</p>
<p>people are fucking into it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s popping up for me.</p>
<p>Lots of concealer.</p>
<p>I was also influenced.</p>
<p>They all use Koses.</p>
<p>So I bought it.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>You ran out and got them immediately.</p>
<p>I have, it&rsquo;s not like I ran out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I need this because apparently people just wear concealer all day everywhere.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t even know you put on your chin.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my deal with this, Amanda.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get ready with me.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>So the last thing I want to fucking do is an invite Instagram or Tik TOK to get ready</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>My husband brings me coffee every morning and I spend time with my adorable French bulldogs.</p>
<p>I do Wordle.</p>
<p>I do some other puzzles that you end up doing when you hit, you know, 40s, late 40s ish.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, God, I don&rsquo;t want to get out of the bed and get in the shower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like dreading the getting ready part because the fluffing in the bed is so fucking good.</p>
<p>So then I finally go to get ready and then my husband will start talking to me and he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a total metrosexual.</p>
<p>Like he has these serums, the sea salt spray.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totally into it.</p>
<p>He would put any gay man to shame.</p>
<p>Every Paul, he could put him to shame.</p>
<p>He would do, he would be a hundred percent into it.</p>
<p>And he starts staring at me and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m ready for him to leave so I can just get</p>
<p>ready by myself.</p>
<p>The thought of putting a camera on me while I&rsquo;m getting ready, that&rsquo;s no, that&rsquo;s an immediate</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>But secondly, to start airing out shit that nobody cares about.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what bothers me is clearly people do care what these nitwits are saying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeding these stray cats.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeding stray cats.</p>
<p>And you know what happens when you feed a stray cat?</p>
<p>That motherfucker comes back for more food.</p>
<p>Oh, here&rsquo;s another thing about the GRWM.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always in a rush and don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll sit down, they&rsquo;ll put the clips, they&rsquo;ll put the headband, they&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>I have to go to this wedding.</p>
<p>I have five minutes to get ready.</p>
<p>GRWM with me.</p>
<p>I think they say the whole thing.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re like, get ready with me to go to this bat mitzvah.</p>
<p>I have five minutes, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>And I guess the more rushed they are, the better views it gets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always in a rush.</p>
<p>They never have the time.</p>
<p>The reason I gave bat mitzvah as an example, ladies, is because I actually watched a 12</p>
<p>year old get ready for a bat mitzvah.</p>
<p>That is a new personal low, I imagine.</p>
<p>And you know why, though?</p>
<p>On many levels.</p>
<p>But one of the levels is because her routine is much more expansive than my routine.</p>
<p>And her products and everything this fucking 12 year old has with the three minutes she</p>
<p>has left to get ready before her mom drives her to a bat mitzvah, I mean, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting hot.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wild world out there.</p>
<p>I am so grateful that I didn&rsquo;t have that when I was 12, that I was just focusing on which</p>
<p>boys liked me in the class and writing in my journal.</p>
<p>Because what would I have been?</p>
<p>These are monsters.</p>
<p>You know what I think this is?</p>
<p>This is belabored one-hit wonders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this is.</p>
<p>You have a one-hit wonder song and everybody knows it and it&rsquo;s a banger and it can come</p>
<p>out decade after decade and everybody&rsquo;s into it.</p>
<p>Well, this generation, they hit one viral TikTok video or one Instagram and that should</p>
<p>be it.</p>
<p>It should be their one-hit wonder.</p>
<p>But people start feeding those cats, those stray cats, and they keep going back for more</p>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really boring, one-dimensional people.</p>
<p>Because I think putting on makeup is really uninteresting to a degree.</p>
<p>Now if the girl was putting on makeup talking about, oh my God, I did a threesome the other</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>I was so fucked up on cocaine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100%.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I might be way more interested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching the whole makeup video.</p>
<p>I mean, at least if you&rsquo;re going to do the, let me refer to my notes here, the GRWM.</p>
<p>Put some juice with that thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a niche for that though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe there are GRWMs that are like raunchy, you know, that are more raunchy than my bat</p>
<p>mitzvah one.</p>
<p>I have a friend, she&rsquo;s also a podcaster and she says it like it is.</p>
<p>And she said to me, we were talking about this phenomenon.</p>
<p>And she was like, Amanda, I think mediocrity is trending.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>That is a great point.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>It was like, I think people, and she has a whole philosophy, like she wants to write</p>
<p>a thesis.</p>
<p>I think people want to feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>So they watch mediocre people because like, imagine like we&rsquo;re watching like Hollywood</p>
<p>movies.</p>
<p>Like I want it to be, you know, like Julia Roberts, you know, like, but that didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>me feel good about myself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe it makes you feel better to aspire to be someone who ain&rsquo;t that, that amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s attainable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I can be just like the girl that got 500,000 views that put concealer on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then went to the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Those are two goals that I can achieve today.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I can buy concealer.</p>
<p>I can go get coffee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had it with the photographs of the goddamn coffees.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>And every time anybody goes to the coffee shop, they&rsquo;re Instagramming it.</p>
<p>Like I got coffee and I&rsquo;m like, okay, that&rsquo;s just being a person.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just a human that went and got a beverage.</p>
<p>Enough with posting about it.</p>
<p>Because everyone thinks that everyone wants to know their coffee order.</p>
<p>You know what was so great.</p>
<p>And by the way, I want to make it very clear.</p>
<p>I am part of this.</p>
<p>I think people want to know my, I want to make it very clear that I&rsquo;m a giant hypocrite</p>
<p>because so, cause I&rsquo;ll, I can post my coffee and then people will be like, I&rsquo;ll get a few</p>
<p>messages being like, when are you gonna, and then I&rsquo;ll fucking share it, you know, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like, okay guys, I&rsquo;m really into, get this, almond milk lattes.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s groundbreaking, but let me tell you, changed my life.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you love things that change people&rsquo;s lives that don&rsquo;t actually change life.</p>
<p>Like nothing has ever changed my life.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not going to take a probiotic and it&rsquo;s going to change my life.</p>
<p>Like stop telling me change your life.</p>
<p>Cause like nothing has changed my life.</p>
<p>The only thing that changes one&rsquo;s life is a child.</p>
<p>Is a child.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A baby changes everything.</p>
<p>Aside from that, um, can&rsquo;t say that any, that lemon water or fucking anything changed my</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear that it changed yours.</p>
<p>Cause like, what am I doing then?</p>
<p>If nothing changes mine.</p>
<p>So Amanda, I have, I want to play a little game of would you rather.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the first one is, would you rather GRWM and let me refer to my notes again, get, would</p>
<p>you rather get ready with me five days a week, three hours each session on your Instagram</p>
<p>with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>You cannot deadpan it like you do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen your Instagram videos where you deadpan the shit and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, your delivery is excellent.</p>
<p>You have to do it with, so what I&rsquo;m doing first and you then go into personal stories</p>
<p>and you have to be sincere about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Monday through Friday or every Christmas for the rest of your life with your family, post</p>
<p>yourselves in matching Christmas pajamas on the internet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the five.</p>
<p>Get ready with me.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t want to do it for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Every Christmas I posted, um, something making fun of that cause I was just kind of like</p>
<p>who made this up?</p>
<p>Like who was like, this is a thing we do.</p>
<p>And now everyone fucking does it and you have to see everyone&rsquo;s, you know, photo with matching</p>
<p>pajamas.</p>
<p>Um, and, and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>And then there are people that are like, like, you know, the people defending it, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>are you really going to defend it?</p>
<p>Like even if you do it, you can make fun of yourself 100% doing something that is, you</p>
<p>know, the word Chugi isn&rsquo;t really cool anymore.</p>
<p>Do you know what Chugi means?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Chugi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like so basic.</p>
<p>So vanilla.</p>
<p>So whatever.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying I could never be caught in matching pajamas, but I&rsquo;m just saying I</p>
<p>could do not want it as a yearly tradition.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s cute as like a one time maybe thing, but now people do it every year and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, they feel like it&rsquo;s a necessary part of their holiday.</p>
<p>I will tell you I, this year I succumbed because I see pictures, I see people&rsquo;s Christmas cards</p>
<p>with their matching pajamas and I think, oh my gosh, that&rsquo;s so cute.</p>
<p>So I did it this year, but I, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of dorky, especially because my kids are almost all grown.</p>
<p>This is the problem with, with you get sucked in and you feel like the asshole mom that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not doing the matching pajamas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened with me on national Sunday, son.</p>
<p>Like I have a son and everybody&rsquo;s posting their son and I&rsquo;m like, well, goddamn, I better</p>
<p>post a picture of my son.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I totally fell prey to the entire internet racket of the entire thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with, with Christmas and this needs to end.</p>
<p>Our snail mail Christmas cards, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we have them anymore.</p>
<p>Everybody has seen what everybody is doing on the internet for the entire past year.</p>
<p>And so back in the day, like in the late nineties and early two thousands, there wasn&rsquo;t social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>So you really looked forward to seeing the card and the image of the family.</p>
<p>Now you know what everybody looks like.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll hear somebody saying, well, you know, I&rsquo;m not going to post this picture</p>
<p>until after my Christmas card goes out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, sis, I bet everybody&rsquo;s fucking chomping at the bit stocking their</p>
<p>mailbox going fucking bananas waiting for that hot piece of photo to come in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do you really think they&rsquo;ve, they know what you look like.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen your stories.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen you get coffee.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen you do yoga.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen you drop your kids off at school.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen it all.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden they&rsquo;re rolling out.</p>
<p>Look at this new material, our new Christmas card, put a sock in it.</p>
<p>Everybody knows.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst?</p>
<p>Like that?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get it from like you&rsquo;re a lawyer, like people that you work with, love you, but like</p>
<p>needeth me this card.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then what do you do?</p>
<p>Like throw it out.</p>
<p>That also feels like mean I save it.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve struggled with that forever.</p>
<p>I have, I know people that inventory every year&rsquo;s Christmas card, like in a photo album</p>
<p>and they go back through over the years and I&rsquo;m like, I just throw mine away.</p>
<p>Their friends&rsquo; Christmas cards?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Inventorium?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, put them in a photo album, like a normal photo album.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put all the Christmas cards they receive in there for all these years.</p>
<p>So they have like 20 years worth of other people&rsquo;s Christmas cards, which I always feel bad.</p>
<p>Like I need to throw them away.</p>
<p>And then I end up throwing them away.</p>
<p>I throw them away immediately.</p>
<p>Unless the card is about me, I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s like a whole essay about how amazing I am, I&rsquo;m going to save that card in my, in</p>
<p>a box.</p>
<p>And put it on the refrigerator even maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t need like, you know, your story or your well wishes, you know?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another one.</p>
<p>Would you rather do the, get ready with me, five days, enthusiasm, sincerely, no dead</p>
<p>panhamer, Amanda, none of that.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to be into it or go to burning man from start to finish, sleep in the tent,</p>
<p>no electricity.</p>
<p>And you have to, how did you know, how did you know this?</p>
<p>How did you know, cause how did you know I wasn&rsquo;t a burning man gal?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already done two episodes about how we&rsquo;ve had it with burning man.</p>
<p>I, you know, the burning man people are like so pathetically into burning man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s their whole personality.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>I just went to lunch somewhere and the owner of the restaurant came to talk to us and he</p>
<p>was a burning man guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they managed to bring up burning man in everyday conversation.</p>
<p>I was like eating hummus.</p>
<p>And how did burning man come up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But he started talking about it.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I even like made it very obvious.</p>
<p>I was like, I hate it.</p>
<p>Like I would never be caught dead at a burning man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for me.</p>
<p>And it was trying to like convince me, no, you have this kind of camp.</p>
<p>The art, the art, I&rsquo;m like eating the art is going to get me there.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>They want everybody to be converted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like evangelical Christians, you know, where they want everybody to be saved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar with the burners.</p>
<p>They want everybody to go to burning man and they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had it with burning man.</p>
<p>So no, I&rsquo;ve had a t-shirt on our website that says boycott burning man on our, I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>it podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll send you one.</p>
<p>It says boycott burning man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go back to the hummus place with the owner and wear it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on your team.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t a really nice though.</p>
<p>Like I realized that we&rsquo;re negative and we don&rsquo;t like a lot of things, but it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>nice to just know that you&rsquo;ll never be convinced to like something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like I feel so confident that I&rsquo;m never going to want to go skydiving.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really nice to like know that, you know, be like never in my life.</p>
<p>So wow.</p>
<p>Get ready with me or burning man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to fucking get ready with the story.</p>
<p>You know what I would do if I was single and I was on a dating app, that would be one of</p>
<p>my filtering questions.</p>
<p>You know, like are you into burning man?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be at immediate cutoff mark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like swipe left.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re going to play another game.</p>
<p>Kylie is going to read, um, pumps and I are not good at pop culture and we have been deep</p>
<p>diving in your Instagram and you have got this shit on lockdown.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to read a quote and then we&rsquo;re going to guess which celebrity said it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably going to win because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Come here from Sikkim.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they say in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Come here from Sikkim and pop culture, but we&rsquo;re going to try.</p>
<p>Wait, are you in Oklahoma, Oklahoma city?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Oklahoma city, Oklahoma fly over state.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here goes Kylie.</p>
<p>Who said I get to go to lots of overseas places like Canada, Sarah Palin, Christina Aguilera,</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>Britney Spears.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s such a Britney thing to say.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so bad at this game.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;d be a lot better.</p>
<p>Follow me for pop culture.</p>
<p>Follow me for up to date news.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who said, I don&rsquo;t know if this is too much, but I can actually mentally give myself an</p>
<p>orgasm.</p>
<p>Oh fuck.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Oh, Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga can give herself an orgasm.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That would be a trick though, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one final thing I want to talk to you about.</p>
<p>In my deep dive of your Instagram, you did a complete autopsy of Emily in Paris.</p>
<p>What I loved about this, because the whole hypocrisy thing that you say you have, we</p>
<p>have too.</p>
<p>I mean, we totally have that.</p>
<p>We can flip on a dime about certain shit, but you tell your followers how much you dislike</p>
<p>Emily in Paris and then go into detail, which proves that you have seen Emily in Paris all</p>
<p>the way over the finish line.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I think about Emily in Paris.</p>
<p>I watched every bit of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vapid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so unrealistic and I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>
<p>And then when it&rsquo;s over, I feel this like subtle depression because I&rsquo;m never going</p>
<p>to be in my twenties and have that wardrobe, fucking hot men in Paris.</p>
<p>That ship has sailed, completely sailed.</p>
<p>And so I kind of get sad.</p>
<p>But you know what you should feel better about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s one of the things I said, like there wasn&rsquo;t any chemistry between any</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>You know, it was like they weren&rsquo;t even opening their mouth for like a kiss.</p>
<p>It was like, I remember like Emily and Alfie just like, and they&rsquo;re hot and young, open</p>
<p>your mouth a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what I want to see, you know, just a little French kiss in France.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in Paris and like Gabriel, that hot man, couldn&rsquo;t he be like more into women for</p>
<p>a minute?</p>
<p>You have Camille, you have Emily, like just fucking also like make out, make out.</p>
<p>And I just feel like no one was, was passionately making out.</p>
<p>The sexiest one is the French boss.</p>
<p>Love her.</p>
<p>The old, the French woman.</p>
<p>She was the sexiest one.</p>
<p>So if you watched the reel, I think I say there, like, I want to watch Sylvie in Paris.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That would be cool.</p>
<p>Like she is just, she&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s smoking the cigs.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s having the young, uh, hot husband that she&rsquo;s not really her husband, whatever she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>Like she dresses so French and I don&rsquo;t know, Lily Collins kind of gets on my nerves sometimes.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Somebody I follow on Instagram wrote this, Emily, Emily Ferris needs to get Botox.</p>
<p>And like, that was also distracting because like, I&rsquo;m, I, I just got Botox for the first</p>
<p>time, like a few months ago and up until then I was very like, everyone be natural and like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>And blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Some people need it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And sometimes it could be distracting.</p>
<p>Like Emily from Emily in Paris, like that note spoke to me because I think I was focusing</p>
<p>on her forehead the entire season.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Very expressive.</p>
<p>Let me tell you both how bad this is.</p>
<p>So yesterday I went to get Botox and I had let about four and a half months pass.</p>
<p>So I go and the doctor&rsquo;s looking at my forehead and she&rsquo;s like, Oh, there&rsquo;s this new thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this heat treatment thing.</p>
<p>I want to sign you up for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a natural way to produce collagen.</p>
<p>And so I can book you for that like in a month.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to get onto that Botox because you really need it.</p>
<p>And I just died.</p>
<p>But I mean, I mean, it&rsquo;ll start kicking in like tomorrow, the next day, but it takes</p>
<p>longer to kick in nowadays.</p>
<p>I have Botox next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m desperate for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually like, I don&rsquo;t like needles and I get like anxious about like procedures,</p>
<p>but I was like flying.</p>
<p>I was flying.</p>
<p>It was so cool.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>It was like such a positive experience.</p>
<p>So I flipped, like hardcore flipped under that.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also I just don&rsquo;t feel like it like maybe like filler changes you and people go overboard</p>
<p>and look weird.</p>
<p>I do have filler in my lips.</p>
<p>She does.</p>
<p>She is an offender.</p>
<p>She calls me Daffy Pumps.</p>
<p>Well, she swings by the studio because we like to read our hate comments for like Instagram</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hilarious.</p>
<p>And so she swings by.</p>
<p>And the great thing about pumps is her give a fuck meter is broken and has been broken</p>
<p>for years and years.</p>
<p>She could give two shits what anybody thinks.</p>
<p>And her lip is swollen up.</p>
<p>I mean, it is so swollen.</p>
<p>And I go, how are we supposed to do?</p>
<p>She goes, oh, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do it.</p>
<p>Her lips are all, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just read the hate comments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And I am crying laughing because she looks like a duck.</p>
<p>It was fantastic.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Amanda, we thank you so much for joining us on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a podcast.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I love that.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I love how you call them like individually.</p>
<p>Listeners.</p>
<p>We have to bring the listener in.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re like, oh, it&rsquo;s like a tactic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re talking to the one person or one listener.</p>
<p>We have one list.</p>
<p>Your Instagram is going to blow up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have 741,000 and then that when you see that one uptick, that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be the I&rsquo;ve had it hit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Listener.</p>
<p>The listener.</p>
<p>The one listener.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you, Amanda.</p>
<p>Bye guys.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>She is so great.</p>
<p>I love her like default setting of, okay, I totally have had it with this.</p>
<p>Two days later.</p>
<p>I totally did it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is us.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Half the shit that we&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re offenders.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Like we started with the grocery store thing and I can totally see you start yakking with</p>
<p>somebody in front of you in line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been to target with you and you&rsquo;ll start, oh my God, are you buying that</p>
<p>book?</p>
<p>I just read that book.</p>
<p>That book is so good.</p>
<p>I read it in two days on the beach.</p>
<p>You know, we went here.</p>
<p>I probably do do that, but I feel like it&rsquo;s not premeditated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not walking into target thinking I&rsquo;m going to chat up the person behind me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, right.</p>
<p>I am kind of a chatter.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>A little bit chatty.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You are a little chatterbox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got one more quote that I want to give to you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>See if we know it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she could find her own ass with both hands and a flashlight.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was easy.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you who is the originator of that is Linda Martis, my mother.</p>
<p>Linda has got some sayings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She definitely, definitely has some sayings.</p>
<p>The one I wrote down for pumps.</p>
<p>Anybody want to give me a pelvic exam?</p>
<p>When did I say that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the show.</p>
<p>You say that shit all the time.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t remember half the shit I say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know when it&rsquo;s coming out of my mouth that I&rsquo;m saying it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of diarrhea of the mouth sitting over here.</p>
<p>Do you remember this one?</p>
<p>I need to go smoke right now because I don&rsquo;t want to get unaddicted.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So I stand by that when I was a smoker.</p>
<p>Back in the day, pumps and I both smoked.</p>
<p>Our kids were super little.</p>
<p>There was this giant ice storm and she&rsquo;s like, Hey, come over.</p>
<p>And we had these fucking mink coats and I don&rsquo;t know why on earth we had these mink</p>
<p>coats.</p>
<p>No, we were at the club.</p>
<p>No, but this day we wore them during the day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because it was like, it was an ice storm.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why in our thirties we had old lady mink coats, but we fucking had these</p>
<p>brown old lady mink coats that we both had.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so cold outside.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, okay, let&rsquo;s wear the minks.</p>
<p>So we both wear the minks.</p>
<p>We go outside and pumps is like, I&rsquo;m certain I have the flu.</p>
<p>And she has like 102 fever and I&rsquo;m like, are you sure you want to smoke?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s the last thing I want to do right now, but I can&rsquo;t be not addicted</p>
<p>to cigarettes.</p>
<p>I got to push through.</p>
<p>The flu with a cigarette in the mink coats and how dorky were we running around with</p>
<p>the mink coats?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still wear a mink coat, like to a football game.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s cold and snowy, I&rsquo;ll have no shame at all.</p>
<p>I remember we were at some party at the country club.</p>
<p>We went outside in our mink coats and we were lighting up cigs, hiding from everybody.</p>
<p>And you go, well, look at us out here in our mink coats.</p>
<p>We were undercover as proper ladies.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Proper ladies.</p>
<p>Well, listener, please DM us a voice memo to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
