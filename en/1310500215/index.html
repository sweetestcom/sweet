    <p>The following is a conversation with Brian Miorescu, author of The Immortality Key,</p>
<p>The Secret History of the Religion with No Name, a book that reconstructs the forgotten history of</p>
<p>psychedelics in the development of Western civilization. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors, Insight Tracker, GiveWell, NI, Indeed, and Masterclass. Their links</p>
<p>are in the description. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Brian</p>
<p>Miorescu. Who or what do you think God is? How has our conception, maybe put another way,</p>
<p>of God changed throughout history? We&rsquo;re starting with an easy one, Lex.</p>
<p>Yep. So, what is God? Well, God is a thought. God is an idea, but its reference is to that which is</p>
<p>beyond thinking, beyond our ability to even conceive, beyond the categories of being and</p>
<p>nonbeing. So, how do we talk about that? To talk about it is almost to get it wrong, right? So,</p>
<p>Joe Campbell famously said that any God that is not transparent to transcendence is like an</p>
<p>idolatry because it&rsquo;s just a mental construct, and it can&rsquo;t possibly speak to the incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So, we use poetic language. We say the being of beings, the infinite life energy of the universe,</p>
<p>the mystery of transcendence, boundless life, unqualified isness, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite get to</p>
<p>the point. I think that if there&rsquo;s any great insight from mysticism, it&rsquo;s that you and I</p>
<p>participate with God in a very real way, Lex Friedman, here in Austin, Texas, that in the here</p>
<p>and now to touch that eternal principle, another way to refer to God, to touch that eternal principle</p>
<p>within ourselves is to participate with divinity in some way. So, not an external force, but</p>
<p>that divine sense within. So, there&rsquo;s some aspect in which God is a part of us. So, one, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing we can&rsquo;t describe. It represents all of the mystery around us. It&rsquo;s outside our ability to</p>
<p>comprehend, and at the same time, it&rsquo;s somehow the thing that&rsquo;s inside of us also. The ultimate</p>
<p>paradox. Mechthild of Magdeburg, 13th century German mystic, maybe the first German mystic,</p>
<p>says that the day of her spiritual awakening was the day that she saw and knew that she saw God</p>
<p>in all things and all things in God. And so, we can say this, by the way, without apology or</p>
<p>lightweight theology or vapid speculation or even heresy. We can talk about this,</p>
<p>including within the Abrahamic faiths. The mystical core of these faiths all talk about</p>
<p>the encounter of divinity within. That&rsquo;s what I explore in the immortality key, this notion of</p>
<p>techniques, archaic techniques in some cases, of ecstasy, that allow that experience of the</p>
<p>eternal principle to actually rise up in our consciousness when we&rsquo;re still here as flesh and</p>
<p>blood beings. There&rsquo;s some sense in which our conception of God, though, is conjured up by</p>
<p>our own mind. And so, aren&rsquo;t we creating God? Aren&rsquo;t we the gods that are creating the idea of</p>
<p>God? When we talk about God, aren&rsquo;t we playing with ideas that are created by our mind and</p>
<p>thereby we are the creator, not God? This is a very kind of cyclical question, but in some sense,</p>
<p>I mean that if God is the thing that represents the mystery all around us, contrast that with</p>
<p>our conception of God, the way we talk about him, is more a creation of our minds. It&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>mystery. It&rsquo;s our struggle to comprehend the mystery. And therefore, we&rsquo;re creating the God</p>
<p>in terms of the God that we&rsquo;re talking about in this conversation or in general, if that makes any</p>
<p>sense. It makes no sense whatsoever. Great. This is wonderful. But this is the eternal mystery.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so difficult to talk about, and yet it could be the very center of our beings.</p>
<p>The Upanishads speak about us as the creators, about us as gods. It&rsquo;s a very different creation</p>
<p>myth, but the God of the Upanishads in this great verse talks about pouring themselves into</p>
<p>creation. Indeed, I have become this creation, says God. And there&rsquo;s a great line, verily he or</p>
<p>she who knows this becomes in this creation a creator. So, yeah, I mean, just our ability to</p>
<p>engage in mentation, our ability to think about this stuff is partly our divine nature. This is</p>
<p>what the humanists were talking about in the Renaissance, by the way. And that it&rsquo;s not so much</p>
<p>learning, putting dots together, having arguments with each other over learned books. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>process of unlearning, is what some of the mystical traditions talk about. Unlearning all these</p>
<p>thoughts, emotions, traumas, and experiences that have gone into the false construction of our false</p>
<p>self, that behind all these layers, like peeling back the onion, is a part of us that once you can</p>
<p>identify that, begins to look a little bit different. In other words, it&rsquo;s one thing to</p>
<p>foster a relationship with God. It&rsquo;s a very different thing to identify as God. And I mean</p>
<p>that quite literally, without being heretical. You can find this in the mystery traditions.</p>
<p>Can you expand on this? You mean a human being can embody God?</p>
<p>That is textbook incarnational theology that you can find in any Christian mysticism.</p>
<p>But you can find it in the mystical tradition of Islam and Judaism as well. So, Rumi, for example,</p>
<p>the great Sufi mystic talks about, if you could get rid of yourself, just get rid of yourself just</p>
<p>once, the secret of secrets would open to you. That the face of the unknown would appear on the</p>
<p>perception of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day Christian,</p>
<p>of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day contemporary mystic,</p>
<p>talks about, because this stuff does continue, there&rsquo;s a continuity to it.</p>
<p>The poetry here is incredible.</p>
<p>So, well, listen to Rabbi Kushner. He says that the emptying of selfhood</p>
<p>allows the soul to attach to true reality. And in Kabbalism, the true reality is what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the divine nothingness, ayin. And so, I like the adage that atheists and mystics both essentially</p>
<p>believe in nothing, except that the mystics spell it with a capital N, the divine nothing.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll give you Meister Eckhart, another medieval Christian mystic. He says that</p>
<p>if you could not yourself, the same concept, if you could not yourself for just an instant,</p>
<p>indeed, I say less than an instant, you would possess all. So, again, you&rsquo;re seeing the same</p>
<p>thing in Sufism, Kabbalism, Christian mysticism. The way to identify with the divine is to peel</p>
<p>back these layers and attempt to discover pure awareness.</p>
<p>If we look at the universe from a physics perspective, or, you know, I&rsquo;m a computer</p>
<p>science person, so if the universe is a computer, there&rsquo;s some sense that God, the creator of the</p>
<p>universe, or just the computer itself, doesn&rsquo;t know what the heck is going to happen. He just</p>
<p>kind of creates some basic rules and runs the thing. So, there is some element in which you</p>
<p>can conceive of humans or conscious beings or intelligent beings as a tool that the creator</p>
<p>uses to understand himself. Do you think that&rsquo;s a perspective that we could or is useful to take on</p>
<p>God that is basically the universe created humans to understand itself? He doesn&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>the full thing. He needs the human brains to figure out the puzzle. So, that&rsquo;s in contrasting</p>
<p>to the unlearning to getting out of the way that we&rsquo;ve talked about. It&rsquo;s more like, no,</p>
<p>we need the humans to figure out this puzzle. Well, we have no answers to this, which is why</p>
<p>philosophers still have jobs, if they have jobs at all. But, I mean, so the physicists take a look</p>
<p>at this. Have you seen the article that came out, I think it was this month, in the Journal of</p>
<p>Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Robert Lanza, the biocentrism theory, the idea that the universe</p>
<p>comes into being through our observation, right, the whole, the God equation. So, not just in</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, but in general relativity, the idea that we make the universe moment by moment,</p>
<p>which is kind of mind blowing, gets into ideas of simulation. Okay, so that&rsquo;s how the physicists,</p>
<p>at least some of them might look at it. You could also look back to the medieval Christian mystics,</p>
<p>Meister Eckhart, once again, says that the eye with which I see God is the same eye that sees me,</p>
<p>right? So, one sight, one knowledge, one love, another mind blowing concept. But this is why</p>
<p>the arts and poetry and music are so important, because although I love astroparticle physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another to kind of hear this, the same message across time.</p>
<p>Yeah, the simulation thing. I was actually looking this morning at video games, just the statistics</p>
<p>on video games. And I saw that the two top video games in terms of hours played is Fortnite and</p>
<p>World of Warcraft. And I saw that it&rsquo;s 140 billion hours, billion hours have been played of those</p>
<p>games. That&rsquo;s a lot of video games. Yeah, but that&rsquo;s very sophisticated worlds being created,</p>
<p>especially in the World of Warcraft. It&rsquo;s a massive online role playing game. So you have</p>
<p>these characters that are together sort of creating a world, but they in themselves are also</p>
<p>developing, they have all these items, and they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re little humans. Like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complicated societies that are formed, they have goals, they&rsquo;re striving and so on. And it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creating a universe within our universe. And for now, it&rsquo;s a kind of, it&rsquo;s a basic sort</p>
<p>of constraint version of our more richer earth like civilization. But it&rsquo;s conceivable that,</p>
<p>you know, that we are this thing on earth is a kind of video game that somebody else is playing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can see sort of video games upon video games being created.</p>
<p>That, and this is something I think a lot about, not from philosophical perspective, but practically,</p>
<p>how fun does this video game have to be for us to let go of the silly pursuits in this meat space</p>
<p>that we live in and fully just stay in wow, stay in World of Warcraft, stay in the video game for</p>
<p>full time. So I think about that from an engineering perspective. Like is there going to be a time</p>
<p>when this video game is actual real life for us, and then the creatures inside the video game,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be just borrowing our consciousness, sort of to ground themselves will refer to us as the</p>
<p>gods. Right? Like, won&rsquo;t we become the gods? This conversation is not going how I expected.</p>
<p>But I think about this a lot from, you know, because I love video games, and I wonder more</p>
<p>and more of us, especially in COVID times, are living in the digital world. You could think about</p>
<p>Twitter and all those kinds of things. You could think about clubhouse people using just voices to</p>
<p>communicate with little icons, sort of in the digital space, you could see more and more will</p>
<p>be moving in the digital space and let go of this physical space. And then the remnants of the</p>
<p>ancients that created the video games, that nobody centuries from now will even remember,</p>
<p>those will be the gods. And then there&rsquo;ll be gods upon gods being created. This is the kind of stuff</p>
<p>I think about. But is that any at all useful to you to this thought experiment of a simulation?</p>
<p>Basically, the fabric of our reality, how did it come to be? What is running this thing? Is that</p>
<p>useful? Or is it ultimately the project of understanding God, of understanding myth,</p>
<p>is the project that centers on the human, on the human mind, for you?</p>
<p>Hmm. We seem to be at the center of this divine dance, which sounds awfully anthropocentric.</p>
<p>But the ancients thought about this too. I mean, the concept in Sanskrit of lila, that the point</p>
<p>behind existence is this play, right? It&rsquo;s ultimately playful, this divine dance. It gets</p>
<p>awfully complicated in the Gnostic and Neoplatonic schools, these chains of being from God head down</p>
<p>to us, right? Some invisible, right? And we&rsquo;re gonna get into Terence McKenna territory later</p>
<p>on, but we can start now by talking about discarnate entities and archons and aliens</p>
<p>and archetypes. I mean, there is a world where Terence McKenna does meet Plato and Gnosticism</p>
<p>quite kindly, and that&rsquo;s in this invisible college, right? The invisible world with which we seem to</p>
<p>have some kind of symbiosis that has a higher intent, maybe even a purpose or a plan in mind</p>
<p>for us. So, I mean, these ideas come across when you&rsquo;ve had a heroic dose of mushrooms.</p>
<p>They also pop up in the ancient philosophical literature, this idea of archons who, you know,</p>
<p>the puppet masters controlling us flesh and blood beings. It&rsquo;s all a cosmic dance, and there are no</p>
<p>answers to this. First, who are the archons? And second, what is this world where Terence McKenna</p>
<p>meets Plato? Do you mean in the space of ideas, or are we talking about some kind of world that</p>
<p>connects all of consciousness throughout human history? I think through different techniques,</p>
<p>it is, you know, I think a lot about, I think Gordon Wasson is the meeting point of the two.</p>
<p>So, Gordon Wasson, who I do talk about in the book, was this J.P. Morgan banker turned</p>
<p>ethnomycologist, and he&rsquo;s largely credited with the rediscovery of psilocybin containing mushrooms,</p>
<p>which kind of gave rise to the pop psychedelic revolution of the 1960s. He visited Maria Sabina</p>
<p>down in Mexico. In his wake went Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones, and everybody else.</p>
<p>And the way he describes his psilocybin experience is a bit strange because he thinks of</p>
<p>Plato, right? And he says that, you know, whereas our ordinary reality is kind of this imperfect</p>
<p>view of things, Gordon Wasson felt that on mushrooms, he was spying the archetypes.</p>
<p>And he talks about Plato, and he writes about the archetypes in this famous article that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>released in 1957 in Life magazine. And so, a well read individual from the mid 20th century has his</p>
<p>his premier psychedelic experience, and out comes Plato because what he was witnessing was so sharp,</p>
<p>so brilliant, so detailed, in some sense, more real than real, this noetic sense that William</p>
<p>James talks about, that when you confront something more real than real, these discarnate</p>
<p>entities, these images, these visionary motifs, you&rsquo;re tempted to believe that you&rsquo;ve tapped into</p>
<p>the truest nature and the underlying structure of the cosmos. And that&rsquo;s difficult to escape from,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re Plato or Terence McKenna or Gordon Wasson caught in between.</p>
<p>Can we talk about this being in touch with something that is more real than real?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just go straight there to McKenna before we return to the bigger picture.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s talked about the, what is it, self healing machine elves?</p>
<p>Self transforming.</p>
<p>Self transforming machine elves during his DMT travels. And I just talked to Rick Doblin,</p>
<p>who also had different travels to this hyperspace. But they all seem to be traveling on the same</p>
<p>spaceship, just the different locations. And there is a sense in which they seem to be traveling</p>
<p>through whatever, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s through space time or something else,</p>
<p>to meet something that is more real than real. What can you say about this DMT experience,</p>
<p>about Terence McKenna, about the poetry he used, but maybe more specifically about</p>
<p>this place that they seem to all travel to?</p>
<p>So the big question is, is it real? Is it really more real than real? The ancient philosophers</p>
<p>were asking the same question and their means of attempting to answer that was by dying.</p>
<p>And so if you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that to practice it</p>
<p>in the right way is to practice dying and being dead. And many people describe the psychedelic</p>
<p>experience in sort of near death experience terms. And the encountering of all this visual</p>
<p>imagery tends to be something that is often described as more real than real. So how does</p>
<p>Terence talk about this? So I was just listening to the triologues, which folks should look up</p>
<p>somewhere between 1989 and 1990. Terence sits down with his friends, Ralph Abraham and</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake at Esalen. And they&rsquo;re trying to figure out the meaning of these</p>
<p>discarnate entities and these nonhuman intelligences. And Terence develops a taxonomy</p>
<p>for how to analyze this. And he says that number one, they&rsquo;re either semi physical,</p>
<p>but kind of elusive. So think of the Bigfoot or the Yeti or things like this. Beings that exist</p>
<p>somewhere between mythology and zoology, which isn&rsquo;t really appropriate here. So option number</p>
<p>two, he says, is the mental. You&rsquo;re dropping so many good lines. It&rsquo;s so good. I apologize.</p>
<p>Somewhere between mythology and zoology. This is all Terence McKenna. I take no credit for this.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re combining, you&rsquo;re like, Jimi Hendrix only used the blues scale,</p>
<p>but he still created something new in the music he played. Anyway, go ahead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going into Mixolydian right now. So option number two, and this is what Terence calls sort</p>
<p>of the mentalist reductionist approach. And this is pure McKenna poetry. He says that these beings</p>
<p>could be autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily escaped the controlling</p>
<p>power of the ego. So in Jungian senses, these would just be pure projections, the projections</p>
<p>of schizophrenics in some cases. So they&rsquo;re essentially unreal. And the third option,</p>
<p>the most tantalizing, is that they&rsquo;re both nonphysical, but autonomous. In other words,</p>
<p>they actually exist in some kind of real place, in some kind of real space, and that we can have</p>
<p>Congress with them. There is communication. He talks about the whisperings of the demon artificers,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s just possible that our meetings with these beings have coaxed the human species</p>
<p>into self expression in a very real way, that at different times in history, our relationships with</p>
<p>these semi autonomous beings may actually guide the species. Now, this is high speculation,</p>
<p>and Terence and Ralph and Rupert wind up talking about the early modern period and the scientific</p>
<p>enlightenment, and that even someone like Descartes reports a dream in which he came face</p>
<p>to face with an angel who said that the conquest of nature is to be achieved through measure and</p>
<p>number. So even the hard minded materialist like Descartes is confronting these discarnate entities.</p>
<p>John Dee in the 16th century, the high magician of the Elizabethan court,</p>
<p>he reports decades worth of what we would say is extraterrestrial communication,</p>
<p>or interdimensional communication. And you can find instances of this throughout history,</p>
<p>including among the pre Socratics. And Peter Kingsley writes quite a bit about this, but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>save that until your next question. Well, first of all, we don&rsquo;t seem to understand from where</p>
<p>intelligence came from. We don&rsquo;t understand from where life came from on Earth. But that we can</p>
<p>kind of intuit because it&rsquo;s the space of chemistry and biology have good theories about the origins</p>
<p>of life on Earth. But the origins of intelligent life, that is a giant mystery. And there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>sense in which, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you know the movie 2001 Space Odyssey. But it does seem</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s like important throughout human history, throughout life on Earth, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important phase shifts of it feels like something happened, where there&rsquo;s big leaps. It could be</p>
<p>something coincidental, like fire and learning how to cook meat and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it feels like there could be other things. And I think that&rsquo;s at the core of your work is</p>
<p>exploring what those things could be. Is there, is it possible? Talked about Joe Rogan off line.</p>
<p>Is it entirely possible? Is it possible that psychedelics have in fact contributed of being</p>
<p>an important source of those phase shift throughout human history of the intellect, basically steering</p>
<p>the intellectual development and growth of human civilization. It&rsquo;s a hypothesis worth</p>
<p>investigating. How about that? Beautiful. And maybe not psychedelics in and of themselves,</p>
<p>but I think our whole conversation is kind of wrapped up in these non ordinary states of</p>
<p>awareness. We start by talking about God, which is something unordinary and expansive. And I think</p>
<p>that as you trace the intervention of divinity, if that&rsquo;s the case, throughout human history,</p>
<p>you have to bump up against the irrational. And Mursi Eliade, the great scholar of religions and</p>
<p>fellow Romanian said that the history of religions essentially constitutes the point of intersection</p>
<p>between metaphysics and biology. So that we are biological beings who do interact with our planet,</p>
<p>with the natural kingdom. And you would think that as, you know, early archaic ecologists,</p>
<p>we would have figured out what plants work, which fungi don&rsquo;t and developed maybe language around</p>
<p>that. And so this is another one of McKenna&rsquo;s speculative, but very interesting hypotheses,</p>
<p>the stone and ape theory. Is it possible that psychedelics were involved in one of the several</p>
<p>leaps forward? You mentioned the word leap. Jared Diamond talks about the great leap forward 60,000</p>
<p>years ago. The species had been around for a couple hundred thousand years. All of a sudden,</p>
<p>the cave painting appears. All of a sudden there&rsquo;s a phase shift. Did something like that happen</p>
<p>millions of years ago? And I love the way Paul Stamets talks about this. It would be the ingestion</p>
<p>of perhaps psilocybin containing fungi millions and millions of times over millions and millions</p>
<p>of years. So it&rsquo;s not just a one time event that cascades, but it&rsquo;s the accumulation</p>
<p>of psychedelic experience. It&rsquo;s really difficult to test that hypothesis. But I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>with a paleoanthropologist in South Africa, my friend Lee Berger, about ways that we might test</p>
<p>for this. And so Lee, amongst many things, is this national geographic explorer. He&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>paleoanthropologist&rsquo;s paleoanthropologist at the University of Witwatersrand. He&rsquo;s famous,</p>
<p>amongst other things, for the discovery of previously undiscovered hominids like Homo</p>
<p>naledi. And there&rsquo;s an interesting point. So naledi is this archaic hominid, morphologically</p>
<p>archaic, but it dates to about 300,000 years ago, which is very strange. What&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>strange about Homo naledi at the Rising Star cave system there in South Africa is that Lee</p>
<p>believes he&rsquo;s discovered the first bipedal ape deliberately disposing of its dead.</p>
<p>So there is a recognition of self mortality and the practicing of rituals around death. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about burials. And if you have burials, says Lee, in an archaic hominid 300,000 years ago,</p>
<p>maybe you have language. And I mentioned that because Terence McKenna was obsessed</p>
<p>with language in the stoned ape theory, that the ingestion of psilocybin in addition to enhancing</p>
<p>visual acuity, perhaps facilitating sexual arousal, leads to proto language.</p>
<p>Now, isn&rsquo;t it interesting, this could be entirely a coincidence, that the largest sound inventory</p>
<p>of any language is the Khoisan of Botswana and Namibia. They have something like 164 consonants</p>
<p>and 44 vowels. English, by comparison, has about 45. So I don&rsquo;t know what to make of this, but what</p>
<p>you find in that part of the world is very, very complex language. Language that could be an</p>
<p>inheritance, language that could be incredibly archaic, together with this recognition of self</p>
<p>mortality. And when I talk to Lee Berger, we say, when you&rsquo;re looking at universals like that,</p>
<p>language around all human populations, the recognition of self mortality, the contemplation</p>
<p>of death, just maybe you have pharmacology. And so maybe we can go out and test for this</p>
<p>using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, proteomics, technology that doesn&rsquo;t even exist,</p>
<p>but maybe we can actually test the stoned ape theory to figure out once and for all,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any merit there. Can you just linger a little bit on the pharmacology tools?</p>
<p>Like how would it be possible to say something about what was being ingested so, so long ago?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I asked Dr. Berger. So Lee has discovered in the dental calculus of archaic</p>
<p>hominids. Dental calculus. I like this. Evidence of their diet. And you might not believe how old</p>
<p>this was, but in sedeba, Australopithecus sedeba, they found evidence of sedeba&rsquo;s diet going back</p>
<p>two million years. So through things like phytoliths, which are essentially fossilized</p>
<p>plant tissue, they found evidence that sedeba was eating bark and leaves and grasses and fruits and</p>
<p>palm. So no psychedelics to speak of, but it just goes to show that through things like dental</p>
<p>microwear analysis and other techniques that we&rsquo;re still developing, we can actually figure out what</p>
<p>the diet was at the time. I&rsquo;ll fast forward to 50,000 years ago. There was another study out of</p>
<p>El Cidr√≥n Cave in 2012, which found that Neanderthals, again, preceding our species</p>
<p>50,000 years ago, were ingesting yarrow and chamomile, which had been identified as medicinal.</p>
<p>So again, not psychedelic or psychoactive, but we kind of have the beginnings of the technology,</p>
<p>and that was nine years ago, to begin figuring out the ancestral diet of these hominids.</p>
<p>Presumably there could be a way to figure out, it&rsquo;s not just diet, but which have psychoactive</p>
<p>elements to them. So whether you&rsquo;re chewing it, whether you&rsquo;re smoking it, whether, I mean, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, licking it. I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any kind of ways through the dental calculus to figure out</p>
<p>what exact substances were being consumed. Is it possible to figure out whether psychedelic</p>
<p>substances are being consumed by looking at human behavior, like you said, organized burials</p>
<p>or cave paintings? No, but so that&rsquo;s a little bit of a stretch to say, like, where did this</p>
<p>leap come from? But it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s not. So just last fall, as a matter of fact, so that notion</p>
<p>has been out there for a while, the idea that hallucinogens and the ritual consumption of</p>
<p>hallucinogens were somehow related to the great leap forward, were somehow related to the initial</p>
<p>cave painting. Graham Hancock wrote a beautiful book about this called Supernatural, which in</p>
<p>many ways like sent me down this rabbit hole back in 2007. But even at the time when he was writing</p>
<p>that and the year subsequent, it was still kind of seen as a kooky idea. Last fall, interestingly</p>
<p>enough, the first archeochemical data for the ritual consumption of psychedelics associated with</p>
<p>cave art was finally published. It&rsquo;s not that ancient. It&rsquo;s only about 400 or 500 years ago,</p>
<p>but it came from the Pinwheel Cave, a Chumash site in California. And what they found were</p>
<p>datura quids, like these chewed up, you mentioned, how did they ingest it? These chewed up quids,</p>
<p>like these bunches of datura, which contain these very powerful tropane alkaloids and what was</p>
<p>believed to be some kind of Chumash initiation site. So we can say that there is initial</p>
<p>archeochemical data for the consumption of psychedelics and cave art. And so where else</p>
<p>might we find this? Are there a lot of archeochemists in the world? Is this fascinating? Is through</p>
<p>chemistry, through biology, through physics, whatever, like all the disciplines, perhaps one</p>
<p>day computer science, we apply those tools to study not the data of today, but the data of the past.</p>
<p>But are we talking about dozens here? Like how hard is this problem relative to how many people</p>
<p>are taking it on just as a side little tangent? We&rsquo;re probably talking more dozens than hundreds.</p>
<p>I spent many years trying to track down an archeochemist who would talk to me. There were</p>
<p>a couple, Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, and then my friend Andrew Ko at MIT,</p>
<p>which you might know something about. Andrew really, you know, on his own time, on his own</p>
<p>dime, has been gathering the data for this organic residue analysis. He has what&rsquo;s called the Open</p>
<p>Archem Project, which is this online open source repository for this data. But there&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>a center for this. No university has stood up a dedicated center, a team really, which is what you</p>
<p>need of archeochemists looking at this stuff. But I mean, even despite that, there have been some</p>
<p>remarkable discoveries over the past 10, 20 years. It&rsquo;s still a discipline very much in</p>
<p>its infancy. Maybe it&rsquo;s becoming a toddler. But as the technology gets better and cheaper, I hope</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see more and more archeochemists joining the fight.</p>
<p>Yeah. And Andrew is fascinating. His work is fascinating. But also, just because of your work,</p>
<p>I came across and exchanged a few emails with Patrick McGovern, who&rsquo;s basically, what would</p>
<p>you call him? So, he has a center, I guess, that does biomolecular archeology at UPenn.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the author of a bunch of books, one of which is Ancient Brews. So, he&rsquo;s a scholar of beer</p>
<p>and wine and like ancient alcohol, which is fascinating. They influence, even just alcohol,</p>
<p>but he has like alcohol with hallucinogenic properties as well. But as a Russian, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating to think about the influence of alcohol on the development of human civilization</p>
<p>throughout its history. Is there something you can comment on alcohol or in general,</p>
<p>Patrick&rsquo;s work that was informative to you, inspiring, or kind of added to your conception</p>
<p>of human history?</p>
<p>His work was some of the first hard scientific data that I saw for the ritual consumption</p>
<p>of these intoxicants. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever found the hard and fast data for psychedelics.</p>
<p>But what he turned me on to was this idea that alcohol or beer and wine specifically</p>
<p>could have been used as vehicles for the administration of psychedelics. That&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>it all started for me. Just the notion that ancient beer and ancient wine is very, very</p>
<p>different from what we drink today, that typically they were cocktails. They were often fortified</p>
<p>and mixed with different fruits, berries, herbs, plants, maybe even fungi over time,</p>
<p>because this was all in the absence of distilled liquor. There is no hard alcohol, even in</p>
<p>Russia, before maybe the 12th century it was in Europe, maybe a bit earlier. But the concept</p>
<p>of distillation just didn&rsquo;t exist. And so, to pack a punch, rather than just drink a</p>
<p>kind of watered down Budweiser, these people were interested in fortifying these beverages</p>
<p>with whatever they could find in nature. And Pat, to his credit, found some of the initial</p>
<p>data for these, you could say, spiked wines and spiked beers. Not with anything overtly</p>
<p>psychedelic, but just the fact that in the 16th century BC, at grave circle A in Mycenae,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this Minoan ritual cocktail of beer mixed with wine, mixed with mead, is very</p>
<p>interesting. It&rsquo;s even more interesting that you find that across the Aegean, in Gordium,</p>
<p>at King Midas&rsquo;s tomb, right? The same kind of ritual cocktail, which Pat and Sam at the</p>
<p>Dogfish Head Brewery resurrected as the Midas touch. So, I mean, the notion that we can</p>
<p>go back, find this data, resurrect it, in some cases, 2800 years later, I found pretty</p>
<p>exciting 10 years ago. Yeah, bring it back for research. But that&rsquo;s fascinating that</p>
<p>people are playing with these ideas. And we&rsquo;ll return to, we&rsquo;ll return to our</p>
<p>ideas of psychedelic infused wine, which is pretty fascinating. But can we step back and</p>
<p>just kind of look at your work with the book Immortality Key? What is the story that you</p>
<p>tell in this book? I knew we&rsquo;d get there eventually, Lex. It&rsquo;s a nonlinear path. Somehow</p>
<p>we were talking about simulation and the universe is a computer that&rsquo;s creating video games</p>
<p>and WoW and Fortnite. But we got there and we&rsquo;ll return, always, to the insane philosophical.</p>
<p>But your book Immortality Key, what&rsquo;s the story that you tell in this book? Which part</p>
<p>of human history are you studying? Right. So that&rsquo;s the way to phrase it. So it&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s my 12 year search for the hard scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelics</p>
<p>in classical antiquity. So we&rsquo;re talking about amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>And the paleo Christians. So the generations that would give birth to the largest religion</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s ever known. Christianity today was two and a half billion people. The big</p>
<p>question for me is, you know, were psychedelics actually involved? There was a lot written</p>
<p>about this in the sixties, John Marco Allegro. The book that I follow was published in 1978</p>
<p>before I was born. The Road to Eleusis by Gordon Wasson, who we talked about already,</p>
<p>Albert Hofmann, who famously discovers LSD or synthesizes it from ergot, and Carl Ruck,</p>
<p>who is still a professor of classics at Boston University, the only surviving member of that</p>
<p>renegade trio and now 85 years old. So this all predates us. But what was lacking in the 60s,</p>
<p>70s, 80s, 90s, I think was some of this technology and the hard scientific data.</p>
<p>Now, for years and years, I went out to the archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists around</p>
<p>the world and I asked a very basic question. Is there any evidence for psychedelics in classical</p>
<p>antiquity? And the answer would almost invariably come back no. I&rsquo;m talking to, in addition to Pat,</p>
<p>he put me in touch with Hans Peter Sticke in Germany, Tania Valamotti in Greece,</p>
<p>Assunta Florenzano in Italy. I went all over the place asking one question and getting the same</p>
<p>answer back time and again. And so the book is essentially my search for that data and</p>
<p>the eventual uncovering of two what I think are key pieces of data. One data point shows the ritual</p>
<p>use of a psychedelic beer in classical antiquity in Iberia, what today is Spain. And the other</p>
<p>shows what looks like a kind of psychedelic wine just outside Pompeii from the first century AD,</p>
<p>at the right place at the right time when the earliest Christians were showing up in Italy.</p>
<p>Again, these are early steps in the search for evidence in the space. But</p>
<p>speaking of early Christians, what role do you think psychedelic infused wine could have played</p>
<p>in the life of Jesus Christ? I&rsquo;ve been saying recently that, and I hope this doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>obscurantist, but I think it&rsquo;s impossible to understand Jesus and the birth of Christianity</p>
<p>in the absence of ancient Greek. And I&rsquo;ll give you a very specific example of why I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case. You can read the entire New Testament in ancient Greek and not once will you ever find</p>
<p>a reference to alcohol because there was no word in ancient Greek for alcohol. The way the word</p>
<p>sounds alcohol, it&rsquo;s Semitic, it comes from the Arabic. Kehela means to enliven or refresh. It</p>
<p>probably comes from kohl, K O H L, sort of these powdered metallics that were used in alchemical</p>
<p>experiments and cosmetics. So again, that&rsquo;s much later in time when we&rsquo;re using alchemy,</p>
<p>distillation, et cetera. In the first century AD, the power of wine wasn&rsquo;t necessarily tied to</p>
<p>alcohol, fermented grapes, the way we think about wine today. So Pat McGovern found some of that</p>
<p>early organic data for wine being mixed with beer and with mead. But if you look at the literature</p>
<p>from the first century AD, Dioscorides, for example, he writes this massive treatise at the</p>
<p>exact same time the gospels are being written. And Dioscorides in just one of his books talks about</p>
<p>56 detailed recipes for spiking wine with all kinds of things like salvia and hellebore and</p>
<p>frankincense and myrrh, these spice perfumes, but also more dangerous things like henbane</p>
<p>and mandrake, which he says in Greek can be fatal with just one cupful. And in book 474 of his</p>
<p>Materia Medica, he talks about black nightshade producing fantasias u aedais, not unpleasant</p>
<p>visions, what today we would say is psychedelic. So just looking at the literature and the kind of</p>
<p>literature that even most classicists, I didn&rsquo;t really learn it in undergrad, I came across</p>
<p>Dioscorides later, but just a basic look at the literature supports what McGovern has been testing,</p>
<p>which is the fact that wine was routinely mixed with different compounds. It&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>by the way, that language affects our conception of the tools we use to understand the world. So</p>
<p>like you can see wine, you can see psychedelics, if they&rsquo;re not called drugs, you can maybe reframe</p>
<p>how you see them in terms of their role in us thinking about the world, understanding the</p>
<p>world. That&rsquo;s really interesting that language has that power, but what language was used to</p>
<p>understand wine at the time? So we&rsquo;re talking about a Greek speaking world, right? So Jesus</p>
<p>is born and does his public ministry in the Holy Land, but think about the early church,</p>
<p>think about where the church takes root. Paul, the greatest evangelist of the time, writes basically</p>
<p>half the New Testament, he&rsquo;s writing letters in Greek to Greek speakers in places like Corinth</p>
<p>in Greece, or Philippi, a defunct city just north of the island of Thassos, or he&rsquo;s writing to folks</p>
<p>in what today is Turkey, the Colossians, the Galatians, he writes letters to the Romans.</p>
<p>These are Greek speakers in these pockets, these Hellenic pockets all around the ancient</p>
<p>Mediterranean. And for them, again, ignore Dioscorides, ignore Pat McGovern&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>to them to think about wine was to think about a mixed potion. And so the word oinos in ancient</p>
<p>Greek does show up in the New Testament, but there was another word to describe wine,</p>
<p>and it exists for like a thousand years before, during, and after the life of Jesus. The word</p>
<p>used for wine is pharmakon, which obviously gives us the word pharmacy, it means drug.</p>
<p>So in Greek, a Greek speaker would actually use the word drug to refer to wine. Ruth Skodel,</p>
<p>the classicist, talks about this as a ritualistic formula. They understood wine as this compound</p>
<p>beverage, a drug against grief, a medicinal elixir that could either harm or heal, or just maybe a</p>
<p>sacrament to put you in touch with wine gods old and new. Clearly, religion and myth, but religion</p>
<p>very much so has sort of a, much like dreams, has like an imagery component. Like you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>going outside the visual constraints of physical space where you kind of have very specific</p>
<p>conceptions of what things look like, and you kind of use your imagination to stretch beyond</p>
<p>the world as we know it. Things that are trying to get in touch with things that are more real</p>
<p>than real. What role do these tools, do these pharmakons have in trying to stimulate the imagery</p>
<p>of religion? Do you have a sense that they have a critical role here, or is it just a bunch of</p>
<p>different factors that are utilized, a bunch of different tools that are utilized to construct</p>
<p>this imagery? Or is this not even, or is imagery the wrong terminology? Is it more like space of</p>
<p>ideas that&rsquo;s core to religion? No, I think the wine is absolutely essential. And so, if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible to understand paleo Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek, I think it&rsquo;s equally</p>
<p>difficult in the absence of the sacred pharmacopeia or wine itself, right? Just think about wine</p>
<p>at the time. I think that the ancient Greek audience would have heard that in a very different</p>
<p>way from us. And so, they&rsquo;re referring to it maybe as a pharmakon, but the followers of Dionysus,</p>
<p>which precedes Jesus. And in some cases, the story of Jesus is kind of a recapitulation of the</p>
<p>mysteries of Dionysus. But when you think about Dionysus, maybe from your high school mythology,</p>
<p>you think about him as the god of theater, or the god of wine, which is typically what it is,</p>
<p>or the god of ecstasy. Again, Dionysus is not the god of alcohol. There&rsquo;s no concept of fermented</p>
<p>grapes. The power of Dionysus and the ability to commune with Dionysus through his blood.</p>
<p>And before Christianity, the blood of Dionysus is equated to his wine. The sacramental drinking of</p>
<p>the wine was interpreted, and classicists write about this, including Walter Burkert. It was</p>
<p>it was interpreted as consuming the god himself in order to become one with the god. This is where we</p>
<p>get the idea of enthusiasm, because the language matters. Enthusiasm to be filled with the spirit</p>
<p>of the god, so that you became identified with Dionysus and acquired his divine powers.</p>
<p>Now, how does that happen? Again, he&rsquo;s not the god of alcohol. He is the god of wine,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s really the god of madness, and delirium, and frenzy. And his principal followers are women.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the minads. And the way they get in touch with him is through the consumption</p>
<p>of this sacramental wine. Even at the theater of Dionysus, separate from his outdoor churches,</p>
<p>there was a wine served there called drima. And this is the wine that gives birth to Hollywood.</p>
<p>I mean, the ancient Hollywood was there at the theater of Dionysus. This is where</p>
<p>comedy, and tragedy, and poetry, and music come from. But rather than a hot dog and a beer,</p>
<p>what they drink at the theater of Dionysus was this wine called drima, which means</p>
<p>pounded or rubbed. And Professor Ruck talks about maybe it was the drugs</p>
<p>that were rubbed into this theatrical beverage to help the play come alive.</p>
<p>So madness is seen as a positive thing, as like a creative journey. It&rsquo;s not, what is it,</p>
<p>the unlearning, getting out of the way kind of thing. Is that how it&rsquo;s seen? Or is it more like</p>
<p>entertaining escape from life that is suffering? I gotta inject a little modern Dostoevsky into the old.</p>
<p>Existential despair. Maybe it&rsquo;s a bit of that. We can&rsquo;t say that there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recreational drinking happening. The Greeks also had the symposium. And they also were just</p>
<p>getting hammered in some cases. But when it comes to the rites of Dionysus, what you see there is</p>
<p>the creation of these states of awareness in which, again, you identify with the God to become</p>
<p>the God. There&rsquo;s theophagy. There&rsquo;s the consumption of divinity in order to become divinity. Right</p>
<p>back to how we started the conversation, right? So if we stop conceiving of God as something</p>
<p>exterior to us, but that the mystery of being itself is the mystery of your being and the</p>
<p>mystery of my being, that the way to encounter that is through the sacramental theology, that</p>
<p>you drink the actual blood of this Greek God to become that God. And there was a place for this</p>
<p>in ancient Greek society. So drinking the wine and drinking the blood of Dionysus, do you think Jesus</p>
<p>is an actual physical person that existed in history? Or is he an idea</p>
<p>that came to life through the consumption of wine and those kinds of rituals?</p>
<p>So this is where I face my excommunication, depending how I answer this.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re playing with fire and wine.</p>
<p>A good combination, by the way.</p>
<p>So I shy away from that controversy in the book. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to accept Jesus</p>
<p>as a historical personage. We have the multiplicity of sources, although it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>generation after his death. But we have the Eucharist being described in the four gospels.</p>
<p>We have it being described by Paul in 1 Corinthians. But when you read John,</p>
<p>it does read a bit differently than the other gospels. And in my book, I rely a lot on the</p>
<p>scholarship of Dennis McDonald, who writes a fabulous book called The Dionysian Gospel.</p>
<p>And this is, again, why the Greek matters, because once you start to analyze the Greek of John&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gospel, it seems to be a presentation of Jesus very much in the guise of Dionysus. The most</p>
<p>obvious example is the wedding at Cana, right? That only occurs in John&rsquo;s gospel, the famous</p>
<p>transformation of water into wine. Now, again, to any Greek speaker of the first century,</p>
<p>they would have known about the Greek district of Elis on the Peloponnese. And in Elis,</p>
<p>around the epiphany, every January, the priests of Dionysus would deposit these water basins,</p>
<p>empty basins in the temple of Dionysus. They&rsquo;d return the next morning and find them magically</p>
<p>filled with wine. Now, on the island of Andros, it&rsquo;s even more interesting. Around the same</p>
<p>epiphany date, the God&rsquo;s gift day, Dies Theodosia, the wine would emanate from the temple and run</p>
<p>like a river for a week. And you can Google the Bacchanal of the Andrians, a wonderful painting</p>
<p>by Titian, which hangs in the Prado, and you&rsquo;ll see a river of wine behind these people having</p>
<p>a great time. This exists for centuries and centuries before the wedding at Cana and before</p>
<p>Jesus begins his public ministry with what these scholars call the signature miracle of Dionysus.</p>
<p>It would not have been lost on the Greek audience that something very specific is being communicated</p>
<p>here. What&rsquo;s being communicated? That you just might find in early Christianity what you hold</p>
<p>strong to in these mysteries of Dionysus that you may have inherited from your parents, your</p>
<p>grandparents, your great grandparents for centuries. There was a perfectly good religion.</p>
<p>There were perfectly good mystery cults in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.</p>
<p>And here comes this new, untested, illegal cult, illegal, of a dozen or so illiterate</p>
<p>day laborers that go on to convert the empire in a few hundred years. The answer to that</p>
<p>extraordinary growth is not psychedelics, but I do think it&rsquo;s visionary experiences,</p>
<p>and I do think it&rsquo;s this continuity from the pagan world into early Christianity.</p>
<p>So what part, you mentioned this idea that&rsquo;s really interesting with, I think you said Paul</p>
<p>Stamets, of I guess millions of people over millions of years kind of consuming, really</p>
<p>practicing a ritual or a habit of some sort. This idea of rituals is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Again, you mentioned cult. What&rsquo;s the role of ritual consumption of some of these substances</p>
<p>or just ritual practice of anything in the intellectual growth of particular groups of</p>
<p>people or societies? So again, I would say it is the centerpiece of ancient life, not just the</p>
<p>mysteries of Dionysus, which we&rsquo;ve only talked a bit about, but the mysteries of Eleusis were</p>
<p>probably the most famous and longest lasting of these Greek mystery rites. And I mean, just to</p>
<p>put it in simple terms, the best definition for a mystery religion, as the name implies,</p>
<p>is something secret, right? Muo from the Greek means to shut the eyes or to shut the mouth,</p>
<p>to keep quiet about this stuff. We&rsquo;re always teasing details from the archaeological and the</p>
<p>literary record, and we&rsquo;re kind of just grabbing at these secrets. But Eleusis, which survives for</p>
<p>like 2,000 years into the Christian period from about 1500 BC to the fourth century AD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of this centerpiece of Greek life. Cicero, the great Roman statesman, calls what was</p>
<p>happening at Eleusis the most exceptional and divine thing that Athens ever produced. So not</p>
<p>democracy, the arts and sciences, or philosophy, but the vision that was encountered at Eleusis,</p>
<p>perhaps through the ritual consumption of a potent psychedelic over hundreds and hundreds of years,</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands and thousands, if not millions of initiates, pilgrims,</p>
<p>who would walk from Athens to Eleusis to encounter this vision. It seems to have been</p>
<p>not just an important part of Greek life, but the thing that made life livable,</p>
<p>such that as these mysteries are about to be exterminated by the newly Christianized</p>
<p>Roman Empire, there&rsquo;s this passage in the ancient literature that talks about these,</p>
<p>you know, in the absence of these mysteries, life becomes unlivable. Abiotos.</p>
<p>Is there ways you can, I mean, you write about the mysteries of Eleusis, and is there ways you</p>
<p>can convert that into words? Why those are so important to them, more important than any other</p>
<p>invention to them? Why is it such a source of meaning to life? So from what we can reconstruct,</p>
<p>they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles northwest of Athens to confront their mortality. Remember,</p>
<p>we were talking about Homo Naledi, and in South Africa, this recognition of self mortality,</p>
<p>the deliberate disposal of the dead. Plato talks about the real practice of philosophy being the</p>
<p>death and dying process. So in some senses, you went to Eleusis to die and to experience a death</p>
<p>before your death. We talked about this with Terence McKenna as well, on this, how the</p>
<p>psychedelic state seems to share something in common with the near death or out of body experiences</p>
<p>or these ecstatic experiences, whether through wine or beer or otherwise, you went to Eleusis</p>
<p>to die. And it was said that only those who had witnessed this vision, whatever vision was to be</p>
<p>witnessed in Demeter Sanctuary, it essentially vouchsafed you the afterlife, that only those who</p>
<p>went there became immortal. And Cicero says that at that point, you essentially live with more joy</p>
<p>and die with a better hope. Can I ask you a question about this human contention with death,</p>
<p>this confrontation of death that seems to be at the core of things? I don&rsquo;t know how deep to the</p>
<p>core, but it seems to be a central element of the human condition. What do you think about Ernest</p>
<p>Becker and those guys that put death at the, what is it, the warm of the core, which as the main</p>
<p>thing, the main, like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all, being understanding</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re mortal and then confronting the terror of it, the fear of it as the creative, like trying</p>
<p>to escape the fear of death as the creative force of human society. It&rsquo;s like the reason we do</p>
<p>anything is because we&rsquo;re just running away from our death, scared. Do you find some of that to be</p>
<p>true, first of all, as somebody who looks in the mirror, looks at yourself and your own as a human</p>
<p>being, two, just looking at society today, and three, at this whole big spread of human history</p>
<p>and all the cool stuff we&rsquo;ve created, including the mysteries of Eleusis? I wonder what life would</p>
<p>look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality. I wonder how we&rsquo;d interact with one</p>
<p>another if there was relatively little or no fear of death. I really do when it comes to Becker&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work and others. If the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death. It was the</p>
<p>opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the immortality key, by the way, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>psychedelics. When I refer to this key, I&rsquo;m referring to this notion that&rsquo;s preserved in</p>
<p>Greek, anpethanis, prinpethanis, denthapethanis, otanpethanis. If you die before you die, you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>die when you die. For some reason, the ancients prized that experience. And we talked about the</p>
<p>mystics of Sufism and Kabbalism and Christian mysticism, where you have this same self nodding,</p>
<p>this death before death, the divine nothingness, right? For some reason, the mystic saints,</p>
<p>visionaries, and ancient philosophers, they ran to death. And the one message I wanted to try and</p>
<p>communicate with this book is how they viewed life, that it can only be fully experienced,</p>
<p>fully embodied in the wake of a really intense, perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational</p>
<p>encounter with death. So running to death, not running away from death. You talk about Aldous</p>
<p>Huxley and mind changers. So if we look at the history where the ancients were running to death</p>
<p>and maybe using some performance enhancing permacons to run more effectively towards death,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re using tools of modern society, whether they&rsquo;re psychological, sociological,</p>
<p>or in case pharmaceutical to run away from this conception. So what do you see as a hopeful future</p>
<p>for human civilization? If all of these kinds of societies are ice cream flavors,</p>
<p>how do you create the perfect ice cream flavor? What is the future of religious experience,</p>
<p>of psychedelic experience, of intellectual journeys, of facing death, running away from death?</p>
<p>What do you hope that looks like and what kind of ideas should we look to?</p>
<p>My next book will be entitled Performance Enhancing Pharmacon. You get full copyright.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like it. But that&rsquo;s a historical view. What in that book would you suggest</p>
<p>in one of the last chapters about the future of this process?</p>
<p>Well, Huxley has to stop you. He stopped me in my tracks, Aldous Huxley. So in 1958,</p>
<p>he pens this op ed of sorts, and it reads incredibly prescient because I really do think</p>
<p>in many ways as the fog of the war drug is ending and finally lifting that we&rsquo;ve kind of come full</p>
<p>circle back to the late 1950s, which might sound strange. It&rsquo;ll make more sense when you hear what</p>
<p>Huxley said about psychedelics. And so he was looking forward to a revival of religion, which</p>
<p>is why I subtitled the book, The Religion with No Name. And to him, to Huxley, this revival wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come about through televangelistic mass meetings or photogenic clergymen, as he says, but he points</p>
<p>to the biochemical discoveries such as we have today that would allow for large numbers of men</p>
<p>and women to achieve a radical self transcendence and a deeper understanding of the nature of things.</p>
<p>In other words, that this revival of religion, he says, would be a revolution. Alan Watts comes</p>
<p>along and says that there&rsquo;s nothing more dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism.</p>
<p>But I think this is what Huxley was pointing to. And he talks about religion in these terms about</p>
<p>being less about symbols and returning to a sense of experience and intuition. And Huxley says that</p>
<p>he envisions a religion which gives rise to everyday mysticism. And he talks about something</p>
<p>that would undergird everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties, and everyday human</p>
<p>relationships. In other words, religion has to mean something. And these altered states of</p>
<p>awareness that we seem to be able to produce quite easily inside the lab at Hopkins, NYU,</p>
<p>and elsewhere with psilocybin. I think this is kind of part of Huxley&rsquo;s prediction about a time</p>
<p>when we would have legal access, safe access, efficacious access to this material that would</p>
<p>allow for insight in an afternoon. And what do you do when millions of people can become mystics in</p>
<p>an afternoon? So psychedelics, psilocybin might be sort of the practical way of having these kinds of</p>
<p>maybe could be termed religious experiences. And then many people partaking in those experiences</p>
<p>and then like evolving this collective intelligence thing we&rsquo;ve got going on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the practice of religion that we should be striving for as opposed to kind of</p>
<p>operating in the space of ideas, actually practicing it. You mentioned, and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>religion with no name, the use of these tools. Is there a simple way to summarize religion for our</p>
<p>previous discussion about God, basically discovering the God inside? What if I give you a very</p>
<p>complicated definition of religion and then we talk about a more simplified? Let&rsquo;s do it. So</p>
<p>the most complicated we can get on this is the anthropologist Clifford Geertz. But I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth defining our terms when we&rsquo;re talking about God and religion. So religion religio from the</p>
<p>Latin means to bind back. So to bind us back to some meaningful tradition, to bind us back to the</p>
<p>source. Here&rsquo;s a mouthful from Clifford Geertz. Religion, he defines as a set of symbols which</p>
<p>acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations by formulating</p>
<p>conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions in such an aura of</p>
<p>factuality that those moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic, which is complex. What does</p>
<p>that mean? That religion has to make you feel something, these moods and motivations. But it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just do that in the way that sex does that for us or sports or ultimate fighting or the World</p>
<p>Cup or going to a concert. So we get all that emotion in these experiences like that. But that</p>
<p>emotion has to be concomitant to a deep existential insight that answers this question for you in the</p>
<p>morning. I know why I&rsquo;m here. I know why humans are here. I think I know what the meaning of life</p>
<p>is. That&rsquo;s what religion is. And if you find that meaning in science, then that&rsquo;s your religion and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine. But we need to be more honest about that. If your epistemological model is weighing</p>
<p>facts and figures and you think that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here on this planet and you find deep meaning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay. Religion is the thing that makes you feel, right? It has the aura of factuality. It</p>
<p>just makes you feel like you know the point behind existence. In other words, I think it can be</p>
<p>in other words, I think it comes down to experience. Like Joe Campbell was talking about,</p>
<p>like Aldous Huxley mentions about experience and intuition. I think this is how we connect to God.</p>
<p>Make you feel like you understand the world. I mean, so that&rsquo;s kind of bigger than science.</p>
<p>That includes science, but it&rsquo;s bigger. Do you think, what is real? Like do you think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an absolute reality that we&rsquo;re kind of striving towards understanding or is it all just conjured</p>
<p>up in our minds? And that&rsquo;s the whole kind of point. We together create these realities and</p>
<p>play with them and dance to somehow derive meaning from those realities. And it&rsquo;s ultimately not like</p>
<p>like very deeply integrated into what&rsquo;s like into atoms of space time. Another easy question, Lex.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you have to kind of, when you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>emotion and making it concrete into something that feels real, you have to start asking,</p>
<p>like, what is real? It&rsquo;s something that Ben Shapiro has this saying of facts don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about your feelings. I was always uncomfortable with this. I mean, he&rsquo;s just being spiffy or</p>
<p>whatever, but I was always uncomfortable with somehow first that the hubris of thinking that</p>
<p>humans can have, like arrive at absolute truth, which is what I assume he means by facts,</p>
<p>like things that are uncontrovertible. And then somehow deriding feelings, like feelings are not</p>
<p>important. To me, like the whole thing is reality. The facts don&rsquo;t even, like facts is reality,</p>
<p>feelings are reality, like the entirety of human experience is reality. All these</p>
<p>consciousnesses somehow interacting together, making up random crap and together agreeing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all going to wear the same colors, rooting for one football team or the other football team</p>
<p>or countries, all those things, that&rsquo;s real because we&rsquo;ve agreed that it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And in the same way, it gives us meaning in that same way religion is a set of ideas that</p>
<p>gives us meaning, but real, it&rsquo;s really difficult for me as a scientist that finds comfort in the</p>
<p>physical understanding of the universe of physics. I love physics. I love computer science.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like everything is perfectly understandable. And then I look at humans,</p>
<p>humans, they&rsquo;re totally not understandable. It&rsquo;s like a giant mess, but that&rsquo;s part of the beauty.</p>
<p>Like what is love? Like what the hell is love? It&rsquo;s certainly not like a weird hack to convince me</p>
<p>to procreate because it feels something bigger than that. So like taking a purely evolutionary</p>
<p>biologist perspective, it&rsquo;s missing the, it&rsquo;s not missing, it&rsquo;s only capturing a part of the picture.</p>
<p>And so it just keeps making me ask, what is real? Because as a human, it&rsquo;s very human centric.</p>
<p>It does certainly feel like a part, a big part of what is real is all the fake stuff my mind makes up.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, I guess, is there something you could say</p>
<p>from our discussions about the tools of psychedelics, about our discussion about</p>
<p>religion, of what is real, of what is reality?</p>
<p>These are largely unanswerable questions.</p>
<p>But we should nevertheless strive to answer them. That&rsquo;s the whole point of the human experience.</p>
<p>And I think science is one way and religion is another. And I think there&rsquo;s actually a sphere</p>
<p>where they intersect, you know, there&rsquo;s a way for religion to be a big part of the world.</p>
<p>Religion to be observable, testable, repeatable, falsifiable. When I look at the ancient mysteries,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I find. I find people exploring alternate states of consciousness and arriving</p>
<p>at conclusions based on that exploration and deriving deep meaning from that, which yes,</p>
<p>are feelings and emotions and very hard to quantify. But nonetheless, these are the things</p>
<p>that govern our lives. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know a parent who isn&rsquo;t motivated by the love of their</p>
<p>children. Everything I do at 40 years old now is pretty much inspired by my love for my two</p>
<p>daughters. And I can&rsquo;t prove to you that I love them. I can say it, I can show you behavior,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard for me to weigh and measure that. So not everything is so reducible to this</p>
<p>quantifiable reality. And yet, I also love science. And I love the historical process of weighing this</p>
<p>data. I love the chemistry. I love the biology. And for me, I think this was the message of the</p>
<p>ancient Greeks. And I think this is the world in which paleo Christianity was born. I think there</p>
<p>is this meeting ground between science and religion, which allow for the, if not the discovery,</p>
<p>then at least the near identification of the ultimate reality, which is another way to describe</p>
<p>God, right? This being of being is the transcendent mystery. So speaking of God,</p>
<p>you mentioned to me offline, you&rsquo;re wearing the most sophisticated clothing choice of the elite</p>
<p>intellectuals. Like you mentioned, Sam Harris was wearing a hoodie. This is the Sam Harris hoodie.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s starting a trend. He&rsquo;s starting a trend. This is a new religion, you could even say. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a ritual. It&rsquo;s a ritual practice of intellectuals of searching for meaning. So there&rsquo;s quite a</p>
<p>fascinating debate. So he was for a time still known as one of the sort of new age atheists.</p>
<p>So he was kind of trying to explore the role of religion in society and the role of science.</p>
<p>And then on the other side, another kind of powerhouse intellectual is Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>who in sometimes, for my taste, a bit too poetic of ways is exploring the ideas of religion.</p>
<p>And they had these interesting debates that I think will continue about the role of religion</p>
<p>in society. For Jordan, there&rsquo;s all these flaws with religion, but there is a lot of value to be</p>
<p>discovered amidst the rituals, the traditions, the practice, the way we conceive of each other</p>
<p>because of the ideas that religion propagates. And then for Sam, it says that everything about</p>
<p>religion basically gets in the way of us fully realizing our human potential, which is deeply</p>
<p>scientific and rational and sort of like we&rsquo;re surrounded by mystery. Calling that mystery God</p>
<p>is getting in the way of us understanding that mystery. What do you think about this debate</p>
<p>about the role of religion in society?</p>
<p>We should continue having this debate. I talked to Jordan a couple of weeks ago, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Excellent. On his podcast? Public? Excellent.</p>
<p>Yes. It&rsquo;ll be out soon. And so, he and I&hellip;</p>
<p>How did that go, by the way?</p>
<p>It was incredible. Carl Ruck, the professor, joined us, as a matter of fact, for one of his</p>
<p>rare public appearances. We went deep. And Jordan is very well read, obviously, on the psychedelic</p>
<p>literature. He had just had Roland Griffiths from Hopkins on the podcast. And it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>Roland&rsquo;s figures that Jordan and I, again, just like the language of Aldous Huxley, it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>move past the following statistic. Over the past 20 years of the modern study of psilocybin, Roland</p>
<p>will tell you that about three in four of their volunteers walk away from their single dose of</p>
<p>psilocybin, high dose, saying it was among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives,</p>
<p>if not the most meaningful. And Jordan says, what do you do with that? How do we synthesize that?</p>
<p>Here we are quantifying the qualifiable, the unqualifiable. And yet, these compounds have</p>
<p>dramatic effects on people&rsquo;s lives, and they walk away feeling like they&rsquo;re more loving,</p>
<p>more compassionate. The science of all talks about the welling up of cooperation and resource sharing</p>
<p>and kindness and all these strange things from this single chemical intervention, which seems to</p>
<p>reduce us to automata, as if enlightenment can be flipped on like a switch. And yet, there it is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the data. And I don&rsquo;t see how you walk away from that. I mean, I completely understand</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s position. But I think there&rsquo;s a reading of religion, particularly the mystical core</p>
<p>of the big faiths, and especially these ancient mystery cults, which do speak, again, to those</p>
<p>moods and motivations, creating this aura of factuality that these volunteers never walk away</p>
<p>from, permanently transformed, just like the ancient mysteries. And part of that is perhaps</p>
<p>language, that we need to continue to evolve language in how we conceive of these processes.</p>
<p>Maybe religion has a bunch of baggage associated with it that is good to let go of,</p>
<p>or perhaps not. I don&rsquo;t know. This is connected to our previous part of our conversation is the</p>
<p>importance of language in this whole thing. Well, that&rsquo;s how I start my book with one of</p>
<p>these volunteers from the NYU psilocybin experiments, this woman, Dina Dina Baser,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an atheist. And she still describes herself as an atheist. And yet, as one of these three and</p>
<p>four people who walked away from this experiment transformed, she says that her experience of</p>
<p>psilocybin was like being bathed in God&rsquo;s love from an atheist. And I asked her why she uses</p>
<p>the word God, why not the love of the cosmos or the universe or mother nature? And she says,</p>
<p>well, frankly, we don&rsquo;t know about any of this stuff and that God makes sense to me. She&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>an atheist, but it&rsquo;s the way she describes that as kind of like the way your mother&rsquo;s love must</p>
<p>have felt when you were a baby. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a kind of, I like the way Einstein uses God. God</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t play dice. There&rsquo;s a poetry. There&rsquo;s a humility that you don&rsquo;t know what the hell is</p>
<p>going on. There&rsquo;s a humor to it. I&rsquo;m a huge fan, especially like more and more of just kind of</p>
<p>having a big old laugh at the absurdity of this world and this life as represented nicely by memes</p>
<p>on Twitter kind of thing. I mean, there&rsquo;s a sense in which we want to be playing with these words</p>
<p>and not take them so seriously and being a little bit lighthearted and explore. Let me ask you about,</p>
<p>because you mentioned NYU, what I find fascinating is how much amazing research, speaking of science,</p>
<p>right? Studying the effects of psilocybin, studying the effects of various psychedelics, MDMA,</p>
<p>on the human mind right now for helping people. But I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;ll be studies soon at Hopkins</p>
<p>and elsewhere that allow people that are kind of more quote unquote creatives or regular people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a particular demon they&rsquo;re trying to work through, a problem they&rsquo;re trying to work</p>
<p>through, but more like to see what can I find if I utilize psychedelics to explore? Is there something</p>
<p>you could say that is exciting to you, that&rsquo;s promising about the future? What currently is</p>
<p>going on but also the future of psychedelics research at Hopkins and elsewhere? The healthy normals.</p>
<p>I was looking for the right words because healthy doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good term and</p>
<p>normal doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good term because we&rsquo;re all pretty messed up and we&rsquo;re all weird.</p>
<p>Well, those with ontological angst in that case. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be a future DSM qualification.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that things like psilocybin, MDMA are useful for things like anxiety,</p>
<p>depression, end of life distress, PTSD, alcoholism, you name it. And it&rsquo;s largely because of the</p>
<p>clinical research that MDMA and psilocybin will probably be legal in some FDA regulated way in</p>
<p>the next five years. But again, I start the first page of my book with this question, why do</p>
<p>psychedelics work across all these different conditions? And the best that I could find is</p>
<p>is the meaning, right? Tony Bosse at NYU talks about psilocybin, for example, as meaning making</p>
<p>medicine, which is interesting because it puts it somewhere between a therapeutic and again,</p>
<p>this ontological instigator. What is it about psychedelics that creates these mystical</p>
<p>experiences or mystical like experiences? You can call them emotional breakthroughs,</p>
<p>you can call them moments of awe. I do think we get locked up in the language and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>somewhere between science and religion here, including legally. So the FDA is one route to</p>
<p>this. What excites me about psychedelics is the first amendment. What is this going to mean for</p>
<p>religion? The freedom of religion being the first thing that&rsquo;s mentioned in the first amendment</p>
<p>before freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. If America is known for anything, it&rsquo;s a refuge</p>
<p>for religious pioneers. And so we already have the native American church, Brazilian spawn churches</p>
<p>that are using psychedelics. But what would happen if Judaism or Christianity or Islam were to begin</p>
<p>incorporating the very ritual, very sacred and discreet use of psychedelics as part of their</p>
<p>liturgy? So not replacing the Sunday Eucharist in the case of Christianity, but part of the extra</p>
<p>credit dimension of the faith. And then we can, through practice, figure out how essential it is.</p>
<p>It could be a minor thing. It could be a major thing. That&rsquo;s another thing I wanted to kind of</p>
<p>ask you is, I recently, despite the fact that I&rsquo;m eating a huge amount of meat, I&rsquo;m getting fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving it. This is actually, as of two days ago, I started this long road to training for David</p>
<p>Goggins, to training back, to getting back to competing in jiu jitsu. So the fun is over. But</p>
<p>I also partook in fasting and there was a very strong, there&rsquo;s an almost like a hallucinogenic</p>
<p>aspect of fasting, because it was, especially because it was a 72 hour fast versus a more common</p>
<p>fast that I do, which is 24 hours. And a bunch of people talk about throughout history about the</p>
<p>value of fasting in having these kind of visual, these kind of intellectual experiences. Also,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s meditation, Sam Harris with the hoodie. Do you have a sense that those other rituals of</p>
<p>fasting, of meditation, and maybe other things could be as essential or more essential to the</p>
<p>religious experience as psychedelics? Yes, if not, and this is going to sound weird, but maybe not</p>
<p>if more so. I look at psychedelics as a catalyst for spiritual investigation, not as the superficial</p>
<p>means to an end. I think their value is in kind of serving as a Google Maps for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>All right, I like this. Well, so Ram Dass&rsquo;s teacher said that when he was offered psychedelics that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll get you in the room with Jesus, but it won&rsquo;t keep you there. And I think that&rsquo;s all well and</p>
<p>good, but what if you don&rsquo;t know where the house is in the first place? What if you&rsquo;ve never had</p>
<p>a mystical experience? What if religion is anathema to you? What if you hate God? What if all</p>
<p>these words mean nothing to you? And they probably do for many, many people, and it&rsquo;s perfectly</p>
<p>understandable. I think that we&rsquo;ve lost the coordinates to these irrational states, again,</p>
<p>that were prized throughout antiquity and that continue to be prized by the mystical communities,</p>
<p>even in big organized religion, it just doesn&rsquo;t filter out that much. And so psychedelics, in my</p>
<p>mind, help orient our minds, bodies, and souls towards the irrational, right? We talked about</p>
<p>McKenna&rsquo;s invisible world that seems to have this symbiosis with our own and perhaps has this higher</p>
<p>intent for us. You could very well just, you know, take catalog of your dreams, right? And that would</p>
<p>do it too. But psychedelics seem to be particularly fast acting, particularly potent, and very</p>
<p>reliable, especially in the clinical studies. And so I looked at them as biochemical discoveries,</p>
<p>like Huxley did. Maybe it&rsquo;s once in your life or infrequently, right? But maybe that&rsquo;s the beginning</p>
<p>of a genuine introspection and a life well examined, as the ancients always instructed us.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem like in the research, the effectiveness of psychedelics always comes with</p>
<p>the integration, where you use it, just like you said, as a catalyst for thinking through stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be, I don&rsquo;t even know if Google Maps, maybe Google Maps is the right analogy,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t do the driving for you. You still have to do the driving. It just kind of gives you</p>
<p>the directions. So after you come down from the trip, or whatever, you still have to drive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other tools that are kind of interesting. We&rsquo;ve been talking about this at the psychological</p>
<p>level, but there&rsquo;s also a neuroscience perspective of it. If you kind of like go past the skull into</p>
<p>the brain with the neurons firing, there&rsquo;s ideas of brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ideas of brain computer interfaces. First of all, there&rsquo;s a whole field of neuroscience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of zooming in and studying the firing of the brain, the firing of the neurons in the</p>
<p>brain, of how from those neurons emerges all the things that we think that makes us human. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fascinating exploration of the human mind. That&rsquo;s of course where the psychedelics have the chemical,</p>
<p>the biochemical effects on those neurons. There&rsquo;s ideas of brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>which if you look at, especially what Neuralink is doing with this long term vision,</p>
<p>with Elon Musk and Neuralink, they hope to expand, he calls it a wizard hat.</p>
<p>This is back to the humor on the internet thing. The wizard hat that expands the</p>
<p>capabilities, the capacity of the human mind. Do you think there&rsquo;s something there or</p>
<p>is the human mind so infinitely complex that we&rsquo;re quite a long way away from</p>
<p>expanding the capabilities of the human mind through technology versus something like psychedelics?</p>
<p>I wonder how Terence McKenna would answer that question. He looked to shamans as kind of the</p>
<p>scientists, the high magicians of the high archaic past and the far flung future.</p>
<p>You know more about AI than I do, so I&rsquo;m not going to discount it. But</p>
<p>I do think that AI paired with the sacred recovery, the archaeology of consciousness</p>
<p>and these states, these archaic techniques of ecstasy that were practiced across time. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a winning combination. Part of what I do in the book is just I try and lay out the set</p>
<p>and setting. That&rsquo;s often talked about with psychedelics. So maybe psychedelics in the</p>
<p>right AI environment is going to work. I think it&rsquo;d probably work a lot better with that myth</p>
<p>and ritual incorporated. So the reason Eleusis worked for 2000 years and let&rsquo;s assume the</p>
<p>psychedelic hypothesis has some merit to it. But I think the reason it worked is because you were</p>
<p>born into a mythology. You were born into a story about Demeter and Persephone and you waited your</p>
<p>entire life to meet them in the flesh. So you weren&rsquo;t just preparing for a few months. It was</p>
<p>a lifetime of expectation, anticipation, ritual preparation. In fact, some of the early church</p>
<p>fathers made fun of the Greeks for essentially just piquing people&rsquo;s curiosity and revving up</p>
<p>the anticipation, which has something to do with the outcome, by the way. But in other words,</p>
<p>I think we need to create a new mythology around this. I don&rsquo;t think you pop into a laboratory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you pop into a retreat center from one day to the next. I think that in my own case,</p>
<p>I think that in my own case, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been preparing 12 years for psychedelics and I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>preparing, including in today&rsquo;s conversation. I&rsquo;m learning new things and I&rsquo;m willing to explore it</p>
<p>together with the computer interface. But I do think ritual is a gigantic part of this. And even</p>
<p>McKenna would say that. I&rsquo;ll paraphrase him by saying that if you&rsquo;d met someone who didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they were between the years 1995 and 2005, you would describe them as a fairly damaged person.</p>
<p>And yet who among us knows what was happening in Western civilization between 900 and 1300,</p>
<p>let alone 2,500 years ago. So this is in many ways the prophet of the psychedelic renaissance saying</p>
<p>that history has lessons. And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re superficial lessons. I think it cuts to</p>
<p>the very core of how and why Western civilization came to be born. Yeah, but that history can be</p>
<p>loaded into AI systems. And I do love the idea of whether it&rsquo;s to bring computer interfaces or without</p>
<p>intrusive, sort of without direct reading of the neurons and more sort of interactive experience</p>
<p>with the robot that you can have an AI system that steers your psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>That helps you sort of, when you take a heroic dose of psilocybin, for example,</p>
<p>helps steer you, steer your mind, say just the right things. I mean, you could say that kind</p>
<p>of thing with, it&rsquo;s a totally open problem, I would say. You talk about set and setting.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing about Johns Hopkins is you create a comfortable environment,</p>
<p>a safe environment for allowing, then if you take a heroic, like a large dose of psilocybin,</p>
<p>that you could trust that everything would be safe and you can really allow the exploration</p>
<p>of your mind. But then you don&rsquo;t know from a psychotherapy perspective of like during that trip,</p>
<p>what a human should say to steer that trip. Like that&rsquo;s a totally open set of problems.</p>
<p>And in some sense, probably throughout history, those rituals, you figured out what are the</p>
<p>right things to say to each other, how to collaborate. And maybe if you can turn that</p>
<p>into an optimization problem, AI could figure that out much, much quicker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you. So, Eleusis was known for three things, the legomena, the dromena,</p>
<p>the decnumena, the things said, the things done, the things shown. If you can pack that</p>
<p>all into your AI interface, I&rsquo;m in, Lex Friedman. I&rsquo;m going to write a proposal and then try to</p>
<p>get it through the IRB at MIT. I mean, there is a certain sense in which I definitely wanted</p>
<p>to explore psychedelics, I mean, in my personal life, but also more rigorously as a scientist</p>
<p>and to push that forward and especially in the AI space. And it is difficult how to do that dance</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s gray areas of legality and all those kinds of things. And we&rsquo;re dancing around them.</p>
<p>And some of that is language and some of that is what we socially conceive of as drugs or not.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right that perhaps we can reframe it as religious experiences, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating because it feels like there&rsquo;s a bunch of tools before us that were</p>
<p>used by the ancients that we&rsquo;re not utilizing for exploring the human mind, that we very well could</p>
<p>be in a rigorous scientific way, in a safe way. And that&rsquo;s fascinating. There&rsquo;s this interesting</p>
<p>period in the 20th century of LSD use that many of the people doing research on psychedelics now</p>
<p>kind of have their roots in that history. I mentioned that Dr. Rick Doblin, he is one of those people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this interesting story of a bunch of creatives that used LSD or other drugs to help them.</p>
<p>What do you make of the idea of somebody like Ken Kesey who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest</p>
<p>in part under the influence of LSD? What do you make of the use of psychedelics to</p>
<p>maximize the creative potential of the human mind? Is this a crutch or is this actually</p>
<p>an effective tool that we should explore? One person&rsquo;s crutch might be another&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bungee cord. It depends on that mind. Think about Paul McCartney. I mean,</p>
<p>we might not have some of the better Beatles music in the absence of LSD.</p>
<p>And what did Sir Paul say in 1967 when he was asked about his use of LSD? He said that he</p>
<p>recognized the dangers inherent in it, but that he did it with a very specific, very deliberate</p>
<p>purpose in mind. He wanted to find the answer to what life is all about. And I&rsquo;m not sure what Sir</p>
<p>Paul is doing this week, but he&rsquo;s probably not doing LSD. Speaking back to my theory about these</p>
<p>substances being catalyzers of spiritual introspection, it came along at a time in</p>
<p>their life when I think they were ripe for it, especially George Harrison. I highly recommend</p>
<p>the Martin Scorsese documentary about George Harrison. For them, I think it was exactly</p>
<p>the way we ought to investigate it, which is, well, mind expanders. This is what psychedelics</p>
<p>do, right? That which makes manifest the contents of the mind. In the absence of an experience like</p>
<p>that, and it can be in a three day fast, it can be laying down in a cave, it can be in ritual</p>
<p>chanting, it can be in a sun dance, but in the absence of that kind of experience at the right</p>
<p>time in your life, it may otherwise be very difficult to find entrance to that kingdom of</p>
<p>heaven, which I do think is here and now, getting right back to the very beginning. If we are</p>
<p>actually to participate in that eternal principle, how and when? What do you think Nietzsche meant</p>
<p>when he said that God is dead? So, there&rsquo;s a sense that religion is fading from society,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a cranky German that kind of wrote about it. What do you think he meant?</p>
<p>He was a cranky German who knew a lot about Dionysus, by the way, which is why I like him.</p>
<p>So, certainly there&rsquo;s some truth to the mortality of God. I think Gallup put out a study only a</p>
<p>couple of months ago where church membership is now officially in the minority in the United States</p>
<p>at 47%, according to the most recent poll. That number was closer to 70% only 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re living through something, and we&rsquo;re living through the unchurching</p>
<p>of America, and it&rsquo;s the rise of the spiritual but not religious,</p>
<p>the inheritor of all traditions but the slave to none. There&rsquo;s a rise in the unaffiliated,</p>
<p>the nones. I think it was like one third of millennials. It&rsquo;s probably much higher now</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t affiliate with any religion. So, in that sense, God is absolutely dead,</p>
<p>but maybe not the God that we were trying to define at the very beginning. So, Nietzsche</p>
<p>also looked forward to the √úbermensch, which would be a fully realized human being that,</p>
<p>despite the death of God, did not fall into nihilism and amorality, existential despair,</p>
<p>all that great German stuff. And there are some commentators who talk about this eternal</p>
<p>recurrence that just maybe by incorporating some of these techniques, not necessarily doctrine and</p>
<p>dogma, but I would say the techniques of antiquity. And again, Nietzsche writes a lot about the</p>
<p>rationality of Dionysus having its place in society. If anything, these biochemical discoveries,</p>
<p>I think, point us back. They point us back to Dionysus and their responsible incorporation of</p>
<p>the irrational into our otherwise society of rational people and our kazoo history.</p>
<p>I have a sense that there will be kind of, just kind of as you&rsquo;ve implied, that there will be</p>
<p>maybe the God of old is dying and there&rsquo;ll be a rebirth of different kind of God and it&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>keep happening throughout history. I do think there will be a time where AI will be the gods</p>
<p>we look to, the other, the super intelligent, those kinds of things. There&rsquo;s a little bit of an</p>
<p>inkling of religious longing for meaning in the way people conceive of aliens currently.</p>
<p>I mean, I talked to a bunch of people about UFOs, the EPs and aliens. And so to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very interesting for perhaps different reasons, because I&rsquo;m just, I look up to the stars</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredibly humbling to me to think that there&rsquo;s trillions of intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>out there, which to me seems likely, or perhaps not intelligent, perhaps just alien life. And</p>
<p>actually, also that we don&rsquo;t even understand what it means to be intelligent, or do we understand</p>
<p>what it means to be alive? The time scale, the spatial scale, which patterns of atoms can form</p>
<p>in a way that you can call life, it just could be way weirder than we can imagine. And certainly</p>
<p>way different than human life. Anyway, that to me is humbling. And so it&rsquo;s almost like the</p>
<p>simulation, conceiving of the world as simulation, thinking of aliens to me is a useful thought experiment</p>
<p>of like, what would aliens look like if they visited? How would we know? How would we communicate</p>
<p>with them? How would we send signals to them? If they&rsquo;re already here and we don&rsquo;t see them,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s that possible? That seems to me actually likely that we would just be too self centered</p>
<p>and too dumb to see them if they&rsquo;re already here. Anyway, so that&rsquo;s kind of the almost the</p>
<p>pragmatic, the engineering, the physics sense of aliens. But there&rsquo;s also kind of a longing</p>
<p>to connect with other intelligent beings out there, both the fear and the excitement of that,</p>
<p>that has kind of a religious aspect to it that I find fascinating. And in the right context,</p>
<p>when you remove the skepticism of government from that, it&rsquo;s actually a hopeful longing.</p>
<p>Do you see this kind of interest in aliens as at all connected to your study of religion?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the first person to ask me about aliens in eight months. So it looks like I&rsquo;m going on the</p>
<p>record. Let&rsquo;s go. I&rsquo;ll drop some J. Allen Hynek on you. So Hynek involved in Project Blue Book</p>
<p>famously says in 1966, when the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assuming that UFOs have something to do with aliens, but when the long awaited solution comes,</p>
<p>I believe it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science,</p>
<p>but a mighty and unexpected quantum leap. In other words, I do not think that we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>flesh and blood beings in nuts and bolts crafts. I think it&rsquo;s way, way more complicated than that.</p>
<p>And if anything, it takes me back to the ancient world. It takes me back to this invisible college</p>
<p>of beings of apparent higher intent. It takes me to the geniuses and the muses. So the first</p>
<p>document in Western civilization, Homer&rsquo;s epics, they begin by invoking an alien. They invoke a</p>
<p>muse. Tell me O muse about the man. So Homer isn&rsquo;t inventing poetry. He&rsquo;s channeling poetry, epic</p>
<p>poetry from an alien intelligence. Maybe that intelligence has felt a little unrecognized in</p>
<p>recent years. Trying to show up in human recognizable forms. The muse is trying to give</p>
<p>a little hints of its existence. Yeah. I mean, I have a, I&rsquo;ve been saying, I honestly sort of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this, but I think about this, whether alien, like muse is a great example,</p>
<p>whether aliens could be thoughts. Ideas we have are the aliens or consciousness itself</p>
<p>is the methods by which aliens communicate with us. Like I find this very kind of liberating to</p>
<p>expand our conception of what intelligent beings are. You would like Julian Jaynes. Julian Jaynes</p>
<p>writes a great book, the origins of consciousness and the breakdown of the bicameral mind. It&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>theory that the ancient Greek mind was very different from ours. And that when they heard</p>
<p>the muses, they heard, or the gods and goddesses for that matter, they would hear them as voices</p>
<p>in the head and hear it as an internal God figure offering commands, which they couldn&rsquo;t ignore. So</p>
<p>were they walking schizophrenics? It might be one way to talk about it before the breakdown of the</p>
<p>bicameral mind, but it&rsquo;s a provocative theory, largely untestable. But when you&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>ancient Greek and Latin for that matter, you can&rsquo;t read it very long without bumping up against these</p>
<p>discarnate entities. They&rsquo;re everywhere. And they survived. They persist across time, which is even</p>
<p>stranger, not just in the form of all the things my daughters like, like fairies and gnomes and</p>
<p>elves. And McKenna loves this, the sylphs and the boulder grinders and the sprites and the gins and</p>
<p>elementals, every society has them. It seems to be fairly universal. And they largely exist in</p>
<p>folklore, mythology. This is what Jacques Vall√©e writes about so wonderfully. We&rsquo;ve kind of been</p>
<p>sneaking around it, but let me ask you from everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about, how do you</p>
<p>think about consciousness? Is it a fun little trick that the human mind does or is it somehow</p>
<p>fundamental to this whole thing? So this three pound lump of jelly inside our craniums,</p>
<p>that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space, it can contemplate the meaning of infinity,</p>
<p>and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity, that peculiar self</p>
<p>recursive quality that we call self awareness. So this is the hard problem, right? This is the</p>
<p>unknowable, the unknown at least. I don&rsquo;t know. I have no good answer for that.</p>
<p>Did you think it&rsquo;s somehow deeply fundamental to the human experience or is it just a trick? So</p>
<p>you have like, I mean, Sam Harris has really been making me think about this. So, you know,</p>
<p>calling free will an illusion. The interesting thing about Sam is it&rsquo;s not just a philosophical</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a philosophical little chat with him about free will. He really says he experiences</p>
<p>the lack of free will. Like he&rsquo;s able to, you know, large parts of the day to feel like he</p>
<p>has no free will. In that same way, now he thinks that consciousness is not an illusion. It is,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a real thing. But at the same, I&rsquo;m more almost like, I&rsquo;m almost more of like</p>
<p>consciousness seems to be a little bit of an illusion in the sense that like, it feels like</p>
<p>maybe this is a robotics AI perspective, but it feels like in that same way that Sam steps outside</p>
<p>of feeling like he has an agency, feeling like he has a free will, I feel like we should be able to</p>
<p>step outside of having a consciousness. So that, from my perspective, maybe that&rsquo;s a hopeful</p>
<p>perspective for trying to engineer consciousness. But do you think consciousness is like at the core</p>
<p>of this? Or is it just like language? Or almost like a thing we build on top of much deeper human,</p>
<p>the things that makes us human? I don&rsquo;t know. I am attracted to Lanz&rsquo;s notion of biocentrism.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to walk away from the double slit experiment, not wondering</p>
<p>why we seem capable of collapsing that quantum wave function. It&rsquo;s very, very weird, giving rise</p>
<p>to even weirder ideas about superposition and spooky action at a distance and things that MIT</p>
<p>guys know a lot better than me. But it seems to me fundamental. I mean, maybe consciousness is</p>
<p>the fundamental thing. I mean, weirdly, some of these ancient incubatory practices, I talked about</p>
<p>Peter Kingsley before. So he&rsquo;s not a proponent of ancient psychedelic use, but is a proponent of</p>
<p>these ancient rites of incubation that were practiced by Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles,</p>
<p>other Presocratics. And so what were they doing? They were trying to get in touch with consciousness.</p>
<p>They were entering into suspended states of animation in these cave like settings. Pythagoras</p>
<p>had built one in his basement and would lie down motionless, apparently, for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And what I think they were trying to do was tap into and trying to answer this question in their</p>
<p>own, you could call it a scientific way, actually, less religion than science. And what they would</p>
<p>discover or try to discover was a state of awareness that is somehow beyond life and death,</p>
<p>beyond waking and dreaming, where you can be aware of the senses, but also in touch with another</p>
<p>reality at the exact same time, what Kingsley calls sensation. That, I think, is definitely</p>
<p>worth exploring. Well, and the way I hope to explore is by trying to build it. Everybody uses</p>
<p>the tools they have. Well, no, I do also hope psychedelics can help. So how do you build that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious. That&rsquo;s a whole other discussion. There&rsquo;s a lot of things I could say here, but</p>
<p>let me put simply is I believe that you can go a long way towards building consciousness</p>
<p>by trying to fake consciousness. So fake it till you make it. As an engineering approach,</p>
<p>I think will work for consciousness. You seem satisfied with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied with that because I know how deeply unsatisfied others are, but just wait.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what to. So the topic of consciousness is mostly handled by</p>
<p>philosophers currently. And that&rsquo;s great. And their philosophers are wonderful and good at</p>
<p>what they do. I&rsquo;m not a philosopher. I&rsquo;m an engineer. And I think the approach there is</p>
<p>quite different. I think falling in love is different than trying to have a podcast conversation</p>
<p>about what is love. I think the engineering effort is just fundamentally different than</p>
<p>the philosophical effort. And I have a sense that consciousness can be engineered even before it is</p>
<p>understood by the philosophers. So I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of things like that in this world that</p>
<p>could be engineered before they&rsquo;re understood. I think the intelligence is one such thing.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll be able to engineer super intelligent beings before we&rsquo;re able to understand</p>
<p>the human mind. There&rsquo;s a lot of intuition to unpack there of why that is. But</p>
<p>as it stands, that&rsquo;s perhaps my engineering optimism and engineering ethic under which I operate.</p>
<p>Consciousness is easy to build, hard to understand.</p>
<p>Okay. Are there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?</p>
<p>Immortality Key is exceptionally well researched. The amount of books you read is I cannot even</p>
<p>imagine. So is there something in your travels through the land of language that stuck with</p>
<p>you that was especially impactful? I mentioned a couple of them. So I knew nothing about</p>
<p>psychedelics before 2007. And it was in hearing about some of the first psilocybin experiments</p>
<p>at Hopkins. And then shortly thereafter, I went down this rabbit hole. And so the first set of</p>
<p>recommendations all kind of fit in that time period of my life, 2007, 2008. It started with</p>
<p>Jeremy Narby, The Cosmic Serpent, DNA and the Origins of Knowledge. It was a total impulse buy</p>
<p>at the Barnes and Noble on Sixth Avenue in New York and wound up introducing me to Supernatural</p>
<p>by Graham Hancock. That convinced me that there was a long story to psychedelics that</p>
<p>he tried to prove in that book and that we&rsquo;re still trying to prove. I mentioned</p>
<p>the connection between ritual psychedelics and cave art. This is the neuropsychological model</p>
<p>that was first proposed by David Lewis Williams at the University of Waterstrand, the same university</p>
<p>where Lee Berger is, by the way, in South Africa. So these ideas are old. But what Graham did in</p>
<p>that book is just it&rsquo;s well worth your time. It&rsquo;s well worth a few reads actually. Because it was</p>
<p>after that that I discovered Breaking Open the Head by Daniel Pinchback and a lot of other books</p>
<p>that just kind of blew my mind. What is Breaking Open the Head about? So it&rsquo;s Daniel&rsquo;s romp through</p>
<p>contemporary shamanism. And it&rsquo;s his very well told experiences with everything from psilocybin</p>
<p>to iboga being initiated by the Buites. And it was the first time I&rsquo;d read any firsthand accounts,</p>
<p>aside from Jeremy Narby, any firsthand accounts by a New Yorker, by the way, about the potential</p>
<p>for these compounds that I&rsquo;d been ignoring for far too long, obviously. And so that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>started revisiting the Road to Eleusis and looking through the anthropological literature, reading</p>
<p>everything Gordon Wasson had ever written, that Carl Ruck had written. And it sent me down a</p>
<p>pretty weird rabbit hole until I found Peter Kingsley, which is my second recommendation.</p>
<p>So Peter, again, he&rsquo;s not a fan of the psychedelic hypothesis. But what he does is I think expose</p>
<p>the value of the irrational to the ancient Greeks, especially the pre Socratic. Here we are talking</p>
<p>about AI and God and these entangled philosophical questions. The best I can read Kingsley is that</p>
<p>Western civilization is a product of a gift from the goddess Persephone. And this is not a hippie.</p>
<p>This is a pretty gold standard classicist who went on to write a couple of books. One is In</p>
<p>the Dark Places of Wisdom, and the other is Reality. What better way to title your book?</p>
<p>Where he talks about these ancient techniques for exploring the irrational. The same thing Carl Ruck</p>
<p>was talking about. After compiling all this data in the Road to Eleusis, Ruck says that the biggest</p>
<p>challenge is trying to convince his colleagues in the late 1970s that the ancient Greeks,</p>
<p>and indeed some of the most famous and intelligent among them, could enter so fully into irrationality.</p>
<p>Same thing Nietzsche is talking about in his exploration of Dionysus. And so I think</p>
<p>Kingsley just stands apart as one of those books, Reality, that my life was never quite the same</p>
<p>after reading that. We talked about the three pound</p>
<p>jelly that is able to conceive of the entirety of the fabric of reality in the universe</p>
<p>and everything, and also of its own mortality. What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life? Is a three pound jelly able to answer that one?</p>
<p>No, but I can plagiarize Joseph Campbell, which is good enough. Joe Campbell says that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think what we&rsquo;re looking for is a meaning of life. I think what we&rsquo;re looking for is an experience</p>
<p>of being alive so that the experiences we have on the purely physical plane will have resonances</p>
<p>within that are those of our innermost being and reality. You talked about the true reality,</p>
<p>absolute truth. These are all constructs. And I think they&rsquo;re constructs that are made day by day</p>
<p>and acquire this aura of factuality, remembering Clifford Geertz&rsquo;s definition of religion. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all just faking it until we make it. And I think a lot of that has to do with moods and motivations</p>
<p>and feelings and emotions, which is not to discredit facts and figures. But I think that</p>
<p>meaning, meaning making is a very subjective process that is not only difficult to talk about,</p>
<p>but difficult to quantify. And experience is a primary in that versus, so like the actual</p>
<p>subjective experience is primary to the meaning making process versus like some kind of rigorous</p>
<p>analysis of like having an algorithm that runs and computes and then finally spits out 42.</p>
<p>Well, this is how families are created. Tell me more about this. Well, my wife and I fell in love</p>
<p>and made babies. We didn&rsquo;t type up an Excel sheet and figure out the best way to go about this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing all these years. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>Too many Excel sheets. Well, we say falling in love, right? We say fall in love. What does that</p>
<p>mean to fall in love? You are surrendering to an intelligence that is beyond us. You could say a</p>
<p>Godlike intelligence. Richard Rohr, the Franciscan friar I mentioned, in the Universal Christ,</p>
<p>he writes a lot about how the divine for you is often encountered in the other. In fact,</p>
<p>how could it be otherwise? This is bedrock sacramental theology that you find the God in</p>
<p>the things in your life as well you should. That&rsquo;s the proving ground for identifying as God rather</p>
<p>than creating a relationship with God. And so I think that these irrational states play a big role</p>
<p>in that. Irrational. Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it than on the topic of love.</p>
<p>Brian, thank you so much for a brilliant exposition of history and the poetry.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you talking with me today. I love you, Lex. I love you too, Brian.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Muirrescu. And thank you to Inside Tracker,</p>
<p>GiveWell, Ni, Indeed, and Masterclass. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Terrence McKenna about psychedelics.</p>
<p>Part of what psychedelics do is they decondition you from cultural values. This is what makes it</p>
<p>such a political hot potato. Since all culture is a kind of con game, the most dangerous candy</p>
<p>you can hand out is one which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
