    <p>The following is a conversation with Rosalind Picard.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a professor at MIT,</p>
<p>director of the Effective Computing Research Group</p>
<p>at the MIT Media Lab,</p>
<p>and cofounder of two companies, Affectiva and Empatica.</p>
<p>Over two decades ago,</p>
<p>she launched a field of effective computing</p>
<p>with her book of the same name.</p>
<p>This book described the importance of emotion</p>
<p>in artificial and natural intelligence.</p>
<p>The vital role of emotional communication</p>
<p>has to the relationship between people in general</p>
<p>and human robot interaction.</p>
<p>I really enjoy talking with Ros over so many topics,</p>
<p>including emotion, ethics, privacy, wearable computing,</p>
<p>and her recent research in epilepsy,</p>
<p>and even love and meaning.</p>
<p>This conversation is part</p>
<p>of the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Rosalind Picard.</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve coined the term effective computing</p>
<p>and led a lot of research in this area since then.</p>
<p>As I understand, the goal is to make the machine detect</p>
<p>and interpret the emotional state of a human being</p>
<p>and adapt the behavior of the machine</p>
<p>based on the emotional state.</p>
<p>So how is your understanding of the problem space</p>
<p>defined by effective computing changed in the past 24 years?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the scope, the applications, the challenges,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s involved, how has that evolved over the years?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, originally,</p>
<p>when I defined the term affective computing,</p>
<p>it was a bit broader than just recognizing</p>
<p>and responding intelligently to human emotion,</p>
<p>although those are probably the two pieces</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve worked on the hardest.</p>
<p>The original concept also encompassed machines</p>
<p>that would have mechanisms</p>
<p>that functioned like human emotion does inside them.</p>
<p>It would be any computing that relates to arises from</p>
<p>or deliberately influences human emotion.</p>
<p>So the human computer interaction part</p>
<p>is the part that people tend to see,</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m really ticked off at my computer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m scowling at it and I&rsquo;m cursing at it</p>
<p>and it just keeps acting smiling and happy</p>
<p>like that little paperclip used to do,</p>
<p>dancing, winking, that kind of thing</p>
<p>just makes you even more frustrated, right?</p>
<p>And I thought that stupid thing needs to see my affect.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s gonna be intelligent,</p>
<p>which Microsoft researchers had worked really hard on,</p>
<p>it actually had some of the most sophisticated AI</p>
<p>in it at the time,</p>
<p>that thing&rsquo;s gonna actually be smart.</p>
<p>It needs to respond to me and you,</p>
<p>and we can send it very different signals.</p>
<p>So by the way, just a quick interruption,</p>
<p>the Clippy, maybe it&rsquo;s in Word 95, 98,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when it was born,</p>
<p>but many people, do you find yourself with that reference</p>
<p>that people recognize what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>still to this point?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the newest students to these days,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve mentioned it to a lot of audiences,</p>
<p>like how many of you know this Clippy thing?</p>
<p>And still the majority of people seem to know it.</p>
<p>So Clippy kind of looks at maybe natural language processing</p>
<p>where you were typing and tries to help you complete,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember what Clippy was, except annoying.</p>
<p>Yeah, some people actually liked it.</p>
<p>I would hear those stories.</p>
<p>You miss it?</p>
<p>Well, I miss the annoyance.</p>
<p>They felt like there&rsquo;s an element.</p>
<p>Someone was there.</p>
<p>Somebody was there and we were in it together</p>
<p>and they were annoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a puppy that just doesn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>They keep stripping up the couch kind of thing.</p>
<p>And in fact, they could have done it smarter like a puppy.</p>
<p>If they had done, like if when you yelled at it</p>
<p>or cursed at it,</p>
<p>if it had put its little ears back in its tail down</p>
<p>and shrugged off,</p>
<p>probably people would have wanted it back, right?</p>
<p>But instead, when you yelled at it, what did it do?</p>
<p>It smiled, it winked, it danced, right?</p>
<p>If somebody comes to my office and I yell at them,</p>
<p>they start smiling, winking and dancing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I never want to see you again.</p>
<p>So Bill Gates got a standing ovation</p>
<p>when he said it was going away</p>
<p>because people were so ticked.</p>
<p>It was so emotionally unintelligent, right?</p>
<p>It was intelligent about whether you were writing a letter,</p>
<p>what kind of help you needed for that context.</p>
<p>It was completely unintelligent about,</p>
<p>hey, if you&rsquo;re annoying your customer,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t smile in their face when you do it.</p>
<p>So that kind of mismatch was something</p>
<p>the developers just didn&rsquo;t think about.</p>
<p>And intelligence at the time was really all about math</p>
<p>and language and chess and games,</p>
<p>problems that could be pretty well defined.</p>
<p>Social emotional interaction is much more complex</p>
<p>than chess or Go or any of the games</p>
<p>that people are trying to solve.</p>
<p>And in order to understand that required skills</p>
<p>that most people in computer science</p>
<p>actually were lacking personally.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about computer science.</p>
<p>Have things gotten better since the work,</p>
<p>since the message,</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;ve really launched the field</p>
<p>with a lot of research work in this space?</p>
<p>I still find as a person like yourself,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s deeply passionate about human beings</p>
<p>and yet am in computer science,</p>
<p>there still seems to be a lack of,</p>
<p>sorry to say empathy in as computer scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>Or hasn&rsquo;t gotten better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s a lot more variety</p>
<p>among computer scientists these days.</p>
<p>Computer scientists are a much more diverse group today</p>
<p>than they were 25 years ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We need all kinds of people to become computer scientists</p>
<p>so that computer science reflects more what society needs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s brilliance among every personality type.</p>
<p>So it need not be limited to people</p>
<p>who prefer computers to other people.</p>
<p>How hard do you think it is?</p>
<p>Your view of how difficult it is to recognize emotion</p>
<p>or to create a deeply emotionally intelligent interaction.</p>
<p>Has it gotten easier or harder</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve explored it further?</p>
<p>And how far away are we from cracking this?</p>
<p>If you think of the Turing test solving the intelligence,</p>
<p>looking at the Turing test for emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>I think it is as difficult as I thought it was gonna be.</p>
<p>I think my prediction of its difficulty is spot on.</p>
<p>I think the time estimates are always hard</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always a function of society&rsquo;s love</p>
<p>and hate of a particular topic.</p>
<p>If society gets excited and you get thousands of researchers</p>
<p>working on it for a certain application,</p>
<p>that application gets solved really quickly.</p>
<p>The general intelligence,</p>
<p>the computer&rsquo;s complete lack of ability</p>
<p>to have awareness of what it&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s not conscious,</p>
<p>the fact that there&rsquo;s no signs of it becoming conscious,</p>
<p>the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t read between the lines,</p>
<p>those kinds of things that we have to teach it explicitly,</p>
<p>what other people pick up implicitly.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see that changing yet.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t breakthroughs yet that lead us to believe</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gonna go any faster,</p>
<p>which means that it&rsquo;s still gonna be kind of stuck</p>
<p>with a lot of limitations</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s probably only gonna do the right thing</p>
<p>in very limited, narrow, prespecified contexts</p>
<p>where we can prescribe pretty much</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to predict a date</p>
<p>because when people don&rsquo;t work on it, it&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>When everybody works on it, you get a nice piece of it</p>
<p>well solved in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;s a more important issue right now</p>
<p>than the difficulty of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s causing some of us</p>
<p>to put the brakes on a little bit.</p>
<p>Usually we&rsquo;re all just like step on the gas,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go faster.</p>
<p>This is causing us to pull back and put the brakes on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way that some of this technology</p>
<p>is being used in places like China right now.</p>
<p>And that worries me so deeply</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s causing me to pull back myself</p>
<p>on a lot of the things that we could be doing.</p>
<p>And try to get the community to think a little bit more</p>
<p>about, okay, if we&rsquo;re gonna go forward with that,</p>
<p>how can we do it in a way that puts in place safeguards</p>
<p>that protects people?</p>
<p>So the technology we&rsquo;re referring to is</p>
<p>just when a computer senses the human being,</p>
<p>like the human face, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of exciting things there,</p>
<p>like forming a deep connection with the human being.</p>
<p>So what are your worries, how that could go wrong?</p>
<p>Is it in terms of privacy?</p>
<p>Is it in terms of other kinds of more subtle things?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s dig into privacy.</p>
<p>So here in the US, if I&rsquo;m watching a video</p>
<p>of say a political leader,</p>
<p>and in the US we&rsquo;re quite free as we all know</p>
<p>to even criticize the president of the United States, right?</p>
<p>Here that&rsquo;s not a shocking thing.</p>
<p>It happens about every five seconds, right?</p>
<p>But in China, what happens if you criticize</p>
<p>the leader of the government, right?</p>
<p>And so people are very careful not to do that.</p>
<p>However, what happens if you&rsquo;re simply watching a video</p>
<p>and you make a facial expression</p>
<p>that shows a little bit of skepticism, right?</p>
<p>Well, and here we&rsquo;re completely free to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re free to fly off the handle</p>
<p>and say anything we want, usually.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some restrictions</p>
<p>when the athlete does this</p>
<p>as part of the national broadcast.</p>
<p>Maybe the teams get a little unhappy</p>
<p>about picking that forum to do it, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s more a question of judgment.</p>
<p>We have these freedoms,</p>
<p>and in places that don&rsquo;t have those freedoms,</p>
<p>what if our technology can read</p>
<p>your underlying affective state?</p>
<p>What if our technology can read it even noncontact?</p>
<p>What if our technology can read it</p>
<p>without your prior consent?</p>
<p>And here in the US,</p>
<p>in my first company we started, Affectiva,</p>
<p>we have worked super hard to turn away money</p>
<p>and opportunities that try to read people&rsquo;s affect</p>
<p>without their prior informed consent.</p>
<p>And even the software that is licensable,</p>
<p>you have to sign things saying</p>
<p>you will only use it in certain ways,</p>
<p>which essentially is get people&rsquo;s buy in, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this without people agreeing to it.</p>
<p>There are other countries where they&rsquo;re not interested</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s buy in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna use it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna inflict it on you.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>you better not scowl in the direction of any censors.</p>
<p>So one, let me just comment on a small tangent.</p>
<p>Do you know with the idea of adversarial examples</p>
<p>and deep fakes and so on,</p>
<p>what you bring up is actually,</p>
<p>in that one sense, deep fakes provide</p>
<p>a comforting protection that you can no longer really trust</p>
<p>that the video of your face was legitimate.</p>
<p>And therefore you always have an escape clause</p>
<p>if a government is trying,</p>
<p>if a stable, balanced, ethical government</p>
<p>is trying to accuse you of something,</p>
<p>at least you have protection.</p>
<p>You can say it was fake news, as is a popular term now.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the general thinking of it.</p>
<p>We know how to go into the video</p>
<p>and see, for example, your heart rate and respiration</p>
<p>and whether or not they&rsquo;ve been tampered with.</p>
<p>And we also can put like fake heart rate and respiration</p>
<p>in your video now too.</p>
<p>We decided we needed to do that.</p>
<p>After we developed a way to extract it,</p>
<p>we decided we also needed a way to jam it.</p>
<p>And so the fact that we took time to do that other step too,</p>
<p>that was time that I wasn&rsquo;t spending</p>
<p>making the machine more affectively intelligent.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a choice in how we spend our time,</p>
<p>which is now being swayed a little bit less by this goal</p>
<p>and a little bit more like by concern</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in society</p>
<p>and what kind of future do we wanna build.</p>
<p>And as we step back and say,</p>
<p>okay, we don&rsquo;t just build AI to build AI</p>
<p>to make Elon Musk more money</p>
<p>or to make Amazon Jeff Bezos more money.</p>
<p>Good gosh, you know, that&rsquo;s the wrong ethic.</p>
<p>Why are we building it?</p>
<p>What is the point of building AI?</p>
<p>It used to be, it was driven by researchers in academia</p>
<p>to get papers published and to make a career for themselves</p>
<p>and to do something cool, right?</p>
<p>Like, cause maybe it could be done.</p>
<p>Now we realize that this is enabling rich people</p>
<p>to get vastly richer, the poor are,</p>
<p>the divide is even larger.</p>
<p>And is that the kind of future that we want?</p>
<p>Maybe we wanna think about, maybe we wanna rethink AI.</p>
<p>Maybe we wanna rethink the problems in society</p>
<p>that are causing the greatest inequity</p>
<p>and rethink how to build AI</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not about a general intelligence,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about extending the intelligence</p>
<p>and capability of the have nots</p>
<p>so that we close these gaps in society.</p>
<p>Do you hope that kind of stepping on the brake</p>
<p>happens organically?</p>
<p>Because I think still majority of the force behind AI</p>
<p>is the desire to publish papers,</p>
<p>is to make money without thinking about the why.</p>
<p>Do you hope it happens organically?</p>
<p>Is there room for regulation?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, great questions.</p>
<p>I prefer the, you know,</p>
<p>they talk about the carrot versus the stick.</p>
<p>I definitely prefer the carrot to the stick.</p>
<p>And, you know, in our free world,</p>
<p>we, there&rsquo;s only so much stick, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find a way around it.</p>
<p>I generally think less regulation is better.</p>
<p>That said, even though my position is classically carrot,</p>
<p>no stick, no regulation,</p>
<p>I think we do need some regulations in this space.</p>
<p>I do think we need regulations</p>
<p>around protecting people with their data,</p>
<p>that you own your data, not Amazon, not Google.</p>
<p>I would like to see people own their own data.</p>
<p>I would also like to see the regulations</p>
<p>that we have right now around lie detection</p>
<p>being extended to emotion recognition in general,</p>
<p>that right now you can&rsquo;t use a lie detector on an employee</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, on a candidate</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re interviewing them for a job.</p>
<p>I think similarly, we need to put in place protection</p>
<p>around reading people&rsquo;s emotions without their consent</p>
<p>and in certain cases,</p>
<p>like characterizing them for a job and other opportunities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m also, I also think that when we&rsquo;re reading emotion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s predictive around mental health,</p>
<p>that that should, even though it&rsquo;s not medical data,</p>
<p>that that should get the kinds of protections</p>
<p>that our medical data gets.</p>
<p>What most people don&rsquo;t know yet</p>
<p>is right now with your smartphone use,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re wearing a sensor</p>
<p>and you wanna learn about your stress and your sleep</p>
<p>and your physical activity</p>
<p>and how much you&rsquo;re using your phone</p>
<p>and your social interaction,</p>
<p>all of that nonmedical data,</p>
<p>when we put it together with machine learning,</p>
<p>now called AI, even though the founders of AI</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have called it that,</p>
<p>that capability can not only tell that you&rsquo;re calm right now</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re getting a little stressed,</p>
<p>but it can also predict how you&rsquo;re likely to be tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re likely to be sick or healthy,</p>
<p>happy or sad, stressed or calm.</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re tracking data over time.</p>
<p>Especially when we&rsquo;re tracking a week of your data or more.</p>
<p>Do you have an optimism towards,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of people on our phones</p>
<p>are worried about this camera that&rsquo;s looking at us.</p>
<p>For the most part, on balance,</p>
<p>are you optimistic about the benefits</p>
<p>that can be brought from that camera</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking at billions of us?</p>
<p>Or should we be more worried?</p>
<p>I think we should be a little bit more worried</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s looking at us and listening to us.</p>
<p>The device sitting on your countertop in your kitchen,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, you know, Alexa or Google Home or Apple, Siri,</p>
<p>these devices want to listen</p>
<p>while they say ostensibly to help us.</p>
<p>And I think there are great people in these companies</p>
<p>who do want to help people.</p>
<p>Let me not brand them all bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a user of products from all of these companies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m naming all the A companies, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon.</p>
<p>They are awfully big companies, right?</p>
<p>They have incredible power.</p>
<p>And you know, what if China were to buy them, right?</p>
<p>And suddenly all of that data</p>
<p>were not part of free America,</p>
<p>but all of that data were part of somebody</p>
<p>who just wants to take over the world</p>
<p>and you submit to them.</p>
<p>And guess what happens if you so much as smirk the wrong way</p>
<p>when they say something that you don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>Well, they have reeducation camps, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice word for them.</p>
<p>By the way, they have a surplus of organs</p>
<p>for people who have surgery these days.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have an organ donation problem</p>
<p>because they take your blood and they know you&rsquo;re a match.</p>
<p>And the doctors are on record of taking organs</p>
<p>from people who are perfectly healthy and not prisoners.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just simply not the favored ones of the government.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s a pretty freaky evil society.</p>
<p>And we can use the word evil there.</p>
<p>I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I can certainly connect to the worry that you&rsquo;re expressing.</p>
<p>At the same time, probably both you and I</p>
<p>and you very much so,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s an exciting possibility</p>
<p>that you can have a deep connection with a machine.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so.</p>
<p>Those of us, I&rsquo;ve admitted students who say that they,</p>
<p>you know, when you list like,</p>
<p>who do you most wish you could have lunch with</p>
<p>or dinner with, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll write like, I don&rsquo;t like people.</p>
<p>I just like computers.</p>
<p>And one of them said to me once</p>
<p>when I had this party at my house,</p>
<p>I want you to know,</p>
<p>this is my only social event of the year,</p>
<p>my one social event of the year.</p>
<p>Like, okay, now this is a brilliant</p>
<p>machine learning person, right?</p>
<p>And we need that kind of brilliance in machine learning.</p>
<p>And I love that computer science welcomes people</p>
<p>who love people and people who are very awkward</p>
<p>around people.</p>
<p>I love that this is a field that anybody could join.</p>
<p>We need all kinds of people</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to be a social person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to force people who don&rsquo;t like people</p>
<p>to suddenly become social.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>if most of the people building the AIs of the future</p>
<p>are the kind of people who don&rsquo;t like people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a little bit of a problem.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>So let me push back on that.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t you think a large percentage of the world</p>
<p>can, you know, there&rsquo;s loneliness.</p>
<p>There is a huge problem with loneliness that&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a longing for connection.</p>
<p>Do you&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lonely, you&rsquo;re part of a big and growing group.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in it together, I guess.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lonely, join the group.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You talked about some worry,</p>
<p>but do you think there&rsquo;s an exciting possibility</p>
<p>that something like Alexa and these kinds of tools</p>
<p>can alleviate that loneliness</p>
<p>in a way that other humans can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I mean, a great book can kind of alleviate loneliness</p>
<p>because you just get sucked into this amazing story</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t wait to go spend time with that character.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not a human character.</p>
<p>There is a human behind it.</p>
<p>But yeah, it can be an incredibly delightful way</p>
<p>to pass the hours and it can meet needs.</p>
<p>Even, you know, I don&rsquo;t read those trashy romance books,</p>
<p>but somebody does, right?</p>
<p>And what are they getting from this?</p>
<p>Well, probably some of that feeling of being there, right?</p>
<p>Being there in that social moment,</p>
<p>that romantic moment or connecting with somebody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a similar experience</p>
<p>reading some science fiction books, right?</p>
<p>And connecting with the character.</p>
<p>Orson Scott Card, you know, just amazing writing</p>
<p>and Ender&rsquo;s Game and Speaker for the Dead, terrible title.</p>
<p>But those kind of books that pull you into a character</p>
<p>and you feel like you&rsquo;re, you feel very social.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very connected, even though it&rsquo;s not responding to you.</p>
<p>And a computer, of course, can respond to you.</p>
<p>So it can deepen it, right?</p>
<p>You can have a very deep connection,</p>
<p>much more than the movie Her, you know, plays up, right?</p>
<p>Well, much more.</p>
<p>I mean, movie Her is already a pretty deep connection, right?</p>
<p>Well, but it&rsquo;s just a movie, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scripted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, but I mean,</p>
<p>like there can be a real interaction</p>
<p>where the character can learn and you can learn.</p>
<p>You could imagine it not just being you and one character.</p>
<p>You could imagine a group of characters.</p>
<p>You can imagine a group of people and characters,</p>
<p>human and AI connecting,</p>
<p>where maybe a few people can&rsquo;t sort of be friends</p>
<p>with everybody, but the few people</p>
<p>and their AIs can befriend more people.</p>
<p>There can be an extended human intelligence in there</p>
<p>where each human can connect with more people that way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still very limited, but there are just,</p>
<p>what I mean is there are many more possibilities</p>
<p>than what&rsquo;s in that movie.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a tension here.</p>
<p>So one, you expressed a really serious concern</p>
<p>about privacy, about how governments</p>
<p>can misuse the information,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the possibility of this connection.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at Alexa.</p>
<p>So personal assistance.</p>
<p>For the most part, as far as I&rsquo;m aware,</p>
<p>they ignore your emotion.</p>
<p>They ignore even the context or the existence of you,</p>
<p>the intricate, beautiful, complex aspects of who you are,</p>
<p>except maybe aspects of your voice</p>
<p>that help it recognize for speech recognition.</p>
<p>Do you think they should move towards</p>
<p>trying to understand your emotion?</p>
<p>All of these companies are very interested</p>
<p>in understanding human emotion.</p>
<p>They want, more people are telling Siri every day</p>
<p>they want to kill themselves.</p>
<p>Apple wants to know the difference between</p>
<p>if a person is really suicidal versus if a person</p>
<p>is just kind of fooling around with Siri, right?</p>
<p>The words may be the same, the tone of voice</p>
<p>and what surrounds those words is pivotal to understand</p>
<p>if they should respond in a very serious way,</p>
<p>bring help to that person,</p>
<p>or if they should kind of jokingly tease back,</p>
<p>ah, you just want to sell me for something else, right?</p>
<p>Like, how do you respond when somebody says that?</p>
<p>Well, you do want to err on the side of being careful</p>
<p>and taking it seriously.</p>
<p>People want to know if the person is happy or stressed</p>
<p>in part, well, so let me give you an altruistic reason</p>
<p>and a business profit motivated reason.</p>
<p>And there are people in companies that operate</p>
<p>on both principles.</p>
<p>The altruistic people really care about their customers</p>
<p>and really care about helping you feel a little better</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And it would just make those people happy</p>
<p>if they knew that they made your life better.</p>
<p>If you came home stressed and after talking</p>
<p>with their product, you felt better.</p>
<p>There are other people who maybe have studied</p>
<p>the way affect affects decision making</p>
<p>and prices people pay.</p>
<p>And they know, I don&rsquo;t know if I should tell you,</p>
<p>like the work of Jen Lerner on heartstrings and purse strings,</p>
<p>you know, if we manipulate you into a slightly sadder mood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll pay more, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll pay more to change your situation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll pay more for something you don&rsquo;t even need</p>
<p>to make yourself feel better.</p>
<p>So, you know, if they sound a little sad,</p>
<p>maybe I don&rsquo;t want to cheer them up.</p>
<p>Maybe first I want to help them get something,</p>
<p>a little shopping therapy, right?</p>
<p>That helps them.</p>
<p>Which is really difficult for a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s primarily funded on advertisement.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re encouraged to get you to offer you products</p>
<p>or Amazon that&rsquo;s primarily funded</p>
<p>on you buying things from their store.</p>
<p>So I think we should be, you know,</p>
<p>maybe we need regulation in the future</p>
<p>to put a little bit of a wall between these agents</p>
<p>that have access to our emotion</p>
<p>and agents that want to sell us stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe there needs to be a little bit more</p>
<p>of a firewall in between those.</p>
<p>So maybe digging in a little bit</p>
<p>on the interaction with Alexa,</p>
<p>you mentioned, of course, a really serious concern</p>
<p>about like recognizing emotion,</p>
<p>if somebody is speaking of suicide or depression and so on,</p>
<p>but what about the actual interaction itself?</p>
<p>Do you think, so if I, you know,</p>
<p>you mentioned Clippy and being annoying,</p>
<p>what is the objective function we&rsquo;re trying to optimize?</p>
<p>Is it minimize annoyingness or minimize or maximize happiness?</p>
<p>Or if we look at human to human relations,</p>
<p>I think that push and pull, the tension, the dance,</p>
<p>you know, the annoying, the flaws, that&rsquo;s what makes it fun.</p>
<p>So is there a room for, like what is the objective function?</p>
<p>There are times when you want to have a little push and pull,</p>
<p>I think of kids sparring, right?</p>
<p>You know, I see my sons and they,</p>
<p>one of them wants to provoke the other to be upset</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually healthy to learn where your limits are,</p>
<p>to learn how to self regulate.</p>
<p>You can imagine a game where it&rsquo;s trying to make you mad</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to show self control.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re doing a AI human interaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helping build resilience and self control,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s to learn how to not be a bully</p>
<p>or how to turn the other cheek</p>
<p>or how to deal with an abusive person in your life,</p>
<p>then you might need an AI that pushes your buttons, right?</p>
<p>But in general, do you want an AI that pushes your buttons?</p>
<p>Probably depends on your personality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I want one that&rsquo;s respectful,</p>
<p>that is there to serve me</p>
<p>and that is there to extend my ability to do things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for a rival,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a helper.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of AI I&rsquo;d put my money on.</p>
<p>Your sense is for the majority of people in the world,</p>
<p>in order to have a rich experience,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking for as well.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not looking,</p>
<p>if you look at the movie Her, spoiler alert,</p>
<p>I believe the program that the woman in the movie Her</p>
<p>leaves the person for somebody else,</p>
<p>says they don&rsquo;t wanna be dating anymore, right?</p>
<p>Like, do you, your sense is if Alexa said,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;m actually had enough of you for a while,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna shut myself off.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see that as&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re trash, cause I paid for you, right?</p>
<p>You, we&rsquo;ve got to remember,</p>
<p>and this is where this blending human AI</p>
<p>as if we&rsquo;re equals is really deceptive</p>
<p>because AI is something at the end of the day</p>
<p>that my students and I are making in the lab.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re choosing what it&rsquo;s allowed to say,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s allowed to speak, what it&rsquo;s allowed to listen to,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s allowed to act on given the inputs</p>
<p>that we choose to expose it to,</p>
<p>what outputs it&rsquo;s allowed to have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all something made by a human.</p>
<p>And if we wanna make something</p>
<p>that makes our lives miserable, fine.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t invest in it as a business,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s just there for self regulation training.</p>
<p>But I think we need to think about</p>
<p>what kind of future we want.</p>
<p>And actually your question, I really like the,</p>
<p>what is the objective function?</p>
<p>Is it to calm people down?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Is it to always make people happy and calm them down?</p>
<p>Well, there was a book about that, right?</p>
<p>The brave new world, make everybody happy,</p>
<p>take your Soma if you&rsquo;re unhappy, take your happy pill.</p>
<p>And if you refuse to take your happy pill,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;ll threaten you by sending you to Iceland</p>
<p>to live there.</p>
<p>I lived in Iceland three years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great place.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take your Soma, then go to Iceland.</p>
<p>A little TV commercial there.</p>
<p>Now I was a child there for a few years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful place.</p>
<p>So that part of the book never scared me.</p>
<p>But really like, do we want AI to manipulate us</p>
<p>into submission, into making us happy?</p>
<p>Well, if you are a, you know,</p>
<p>like a power obsessed sick dictator individual</p>
<p>who only wants to control other people</p>
<p>to get your jollies in life, then yeah,</p>
<p>you wanna use AI to extend your power and your scale</p>
<p>to force people into submission.</p>
<p>If you believe that the human race is better off</p>
<p>being given freedom and the opportunity</p>
<p>to do things that might surprise you,</p>
<p>then you wanna use AI to extend people&rsquo;s ability to build,</p>
<p>you wanna build AI that extends human intelligence,</p>
<p>that empowers the weak and helps balance the power</p>
<p>between the weak and the strong,</p>
<p>not that gives more power to the strong.</p>
<p>So in this process of empowering people and sensing people,</p>
<p>what is your sense on emotion</p>
<p>in terms of recognizing emotion?</p>
<p>The difference between emotion that is shown</p>
<p>and emotion that is felt.</p>
<p>So yeah, emotion that is expressed on the surface</p>
<p>through your face, your body, and various other things,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s actually going on deep inside</p>
<p>on the biological level, on the neuroscience level,</p>
<p>or some kind of cognitive level.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Whoa, no easy questions here.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s no definitive answer,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>How far can we get by just looking at the face?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very limited when we just look at the face,</p>
<p>but we can get further than most people think we can get.</p>
<p>People think, hey, I have a great poker face,</p>
<p>therefore all you&rsquo;re ever gonna get from me is neutral.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s naive.</p>
<p>We can read with the ordinary camera</p>
<p>on your laptop or on your phone.</p>
<p>We can read from a neutral face if your heart is racing.</p>
<p>We can read from a neutral face</p>
<p>if your breathing is becoming irregular</p>
<p>and showing signs of stress.</p>
<p>We can read under some conditions</p>
<p>that maybe I won&rsquo;t give you details on,</p>
<p>how your heart rate variability power is changing.</p>
<p>That could be a sign of stress,</p>
<p>even when your heart rate is not necessarily accelerating.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, from physio sensors or from the face?</p>
<p>From the color changes that you cannot even see,</p>
<p>but the camera can see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So you can get a lot of signal, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So we get things people can&rsquo;t see using a regular camera.</p>
<p>And from that, we can tell things about your stress.</p>
<p>So if you were just sitting there with a blank face</p>
<p>thinking nobody can read my emotion, well, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s from sort of visual information from the face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like cheating your way</p>
<p>to the physiological state of the body,</p>
<p>by being very clever with what you can do with vision.</p>
<p>With signal processing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>
<p>But if you just look at the stuff we humans can see,</p>
<p>the poker, the smile, the smirks,</p>
<p>the subtle, all the facial actions.</p>
<p>So then you can hide that on your face</p>
<p>for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re just going in for a brief interview</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hiding it, that&rsquo;s pretty easy for most people.</p>
<p>If you are, however, surveilled constantly everywhere you go,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gonna say, gee, you know, Lex used to smile a lot</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m not seeing so many smiles.</p>
<p>And Roz used to laugh a lot</p>
<p>and smile a lot very spontaneously.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m only seeing</p>
<p>these not so spontaneous looking smiles.</p>
<p>And only when she&rsquo;s asked these questions.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s something&rsquo;s changed here.</p>
<p>Probably not getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>We could look at that too.</p>
<p>So now I have to be a little careful too.</p>
<p>When I say we, you think we can&rsquo;t read your emotion</p>
<p>and we can, it&rsquo;s not that binary.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re reading is more some physiological changes</p>
<p>that relate to your activation.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we know everything</p>
<p>about how you feel.</p>
<p>In fact, we still know very little about how you feel.</p>
<p>Your thoughts are still private.</p>
<p>Your nuanced feelings are still completely private.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t read any of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some relief that we can&rsquo;t read that.</p>
<p>Even brain imaging can&rsquo;t read that.</p>
<p>Wearables can&rsquo;t read that.</p>
<p>However, as we read your body state changes</p>
<p>and we know what&rsquo;s going on in your environment</p>
<p>and we look at patterns of those over time,</p>
<p>we can start to make some inferences</p>
<p>about what you might be feeling.</p>
<p>And that is where it&rsquo;s not just the momentary feeling</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more your stance toward things.</p>
<p>And that could actually be a little bit more scary</p>
<p>with certain kinds of governmental control freak people</p>
<p>who want to know more about are you on their team</p>
<p>or are you not?</p>
<p>And getting that information through over time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a lot of signal</p>
<p>by looking at the change over time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done a lot of exciting work</p>
<p>both in computer vision</p>
<p>and physiological sense like wearables.</p>
<p>What do you think is the best modality for,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best window into the emotional soul?</p>
<p>Is it the face?</p>
<p>Is it the voice?</p>
<p>Depends what you want to know.</p>
<p>It depends what you want to know.</p>
<p>Everything is informative.</p>
<p>Everything we do is informative.</p>
<p>So for health and wellbeing and things like that,</p>
<p>do you find the wearable physiotechnical,</p>
<p>measuring physiological signals</p>
<p>is the best for health based stuff?</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m going to answer empirically</p>
<p>with data and studies we&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing studies.</p>
<p>Now these are currently running</p>
<p>with lots of different kinds of people</p>
<p>but where we&rsquo;ve published data</p>
<p>and I can speak publicly to it,</p>
<p>the data are limited right now</p>
<p>to New England college students.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a small group.</p>
<p>Among New England college students,</p>
<p>when they are wearing a wearable</p>
<p>like the empathic embrace here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s measuring skin conductance, movement, temperature.</p>
<p>And when they are using a smartphone</p>
<p>that is collecting their time of day</p>
<p>of when they&rsquo;re texting, who they&rsquo;re texting,</p>
<p>their movement around it, their GPS,</p>
<p>the weather information based upon their location.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s using machine learning</p>
<p>and putting all of that together</p>
<p>and looking not just at right now</p>
<p>but looking at your rhythm of behaviors</p>
<p>over about a week.</p>
<p>When we look at that,</p>
<p>we are very accurate at forecasting tomorrow&rsquo;s stress,</p>
<p>mood and happy, sad mood and health.</p>
<p>And when we look at which pieces of that are most useful,</p>
<p>first of all, if you have all the pieces,</p>
<p>you get the best results.</p>
<p>If you have only the wearable,</p>
<p>you get the next best results.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still better than 80% accurate</p>
<p>at forecasting tomorrow&rsquo;s levels.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that exciting because the wearable stuff</p>
<p>with physiological information,</p>
<p>it feels like it violates privacy less</p>
<p>than the noncontact face based methods.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think what people sometimes don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny in the early days people would say,</p>
<p>oh, wearing something or giving blood is invasive, right?</p>
<p>Whereas a camera is less invasive</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not touching you.</p>
<p>I think on the contrary,</p>
<p>the things that are not touching you are maybe the scariest</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re on or off.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s behind it, right?</p>
<p>A wearable, depending upon what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>to the data on it, if it&rsquo;s just stored locally</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s streaming and what it is being attached to,</p>
<p>in a sense, you have the most control over it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also very easy to just take it off, right?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not sensing me.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with what it&rsquo;s sensing,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m free, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m comfortable with what it&rsquo;s sensing,</p>
<p>then, and I happen to know everything about this one</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s doing with it,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m quite comfortable with it,</p>
<p>then I have control, I&rsquo;m comfortable.</p>
<p>Control is one of the biggest factors for an individual</p>
<p>in reducing their stress.</p>
<p>If I have control over it,</p>
<p>if I know all there is to know about it,</p>
<p>then my stress is a lot lower</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m making an informed choice</p>
<p>about whether to wear it or not,</p>
<p>or when to wear it or not.</p>
<p>I wanna wear it sometimes, maybe not others.</p>
<p>Right, so that control, yeah, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>That control, even if, yeah, the ability to turn it off,</p>
<p>that is a really important thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And we need to, maybe, if there&rsquo;s regulations,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s number one to protect</p>
<p>is people&rsquo;s ability to, it&rsquo;s easy to opt out as to opt in.</p>
<p>Right, so you&rsquo;ve studied a bit of neuroscience as well.</p>
<p>How have looking at our own minds,</p>
<p>sort of the biological stuff or the neurobiological,</p>
<p>the neuroscience to get the signals in our brain,</p>
<p>helped you understand the problem</p>
<p>and the approach of effective computing, so?</p>
<p>Originally, I was a computer architect</p>
<p>and I was building hardware and computer designs</p>
<p>and I wanted to build ones that worked like the brain.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been studying the brain</p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;ve been studying how to build computers.</p>
<p>Have you figured out anything yet?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>You know, they used to think like,</p>
<p>oh, if you remove this chunk of the brain</p>
<p>and you find this function goes away,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s the part of the brain that did it.</p>
<p>And then later they realized</p>
<p>if you remove this other chunk of the brain,</p>
<p>that function comes back and,</p>
<p>oh no, we really don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Brains are so interesting and changing all the time</p>
<p>and able to change in ways</p>
<p>that will probably continue to surprise us.</p>
<p>When we were measuring stress,</p>
<p>you may know the story where we found</p>
<p>an unusual big skin conductance pattern on one wrist</p>
<p>in one of our kids with autism.</p>
<p>And in trying to figure out how on earth</p>
<p>you could be stressed on one wrist and not the other,</p>
<p>like how can you get sweaty on one wrist, right?</p>
<p>When you get stressed</p>
<p>with that sympathetic fight or flight response,</p>
<p>like you kind of should like sweat more</p>
<p>in some places than others,</p>
<p>but not more on one wrist than the other.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>We learned that what had actually happened</p>
<p>was a part of his brain had unusual electrical activity</p>
<p>and that caused an unusually large sweat response</p>
<p>on one wrist and not the other.</p>
<p>And since then we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>that seizures cause this unusual electrical activity.</p>
<p>And depending where the seizure is,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in one place and it&rsquo;s staying there,</p>
<p>you can have a big electrical response</p>
<p>we can pick up with a wearable at one part of the body.</p>
<p>You can also have a seizure</p>
<p>that spreads over the whole brain,</p>
<p>generalized grand mal seizure.</p>
<p>And that response spreads</p>
<p>and we can pick it up pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>As we learned this and then later built Embrace</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now FDA cleared for seizure detection,</p>
<p>we have also built relationships</p>
<p>with some of the most amazing doctors in the world</p>
<p>who not only help people</p>
<p>with unusual brain activity or epilepsy,</p>
<p>but some of them are also surgeons</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going in and they&rsquo;re implanting electrodes,</p>
<p>not just to momentarily read the strange patterns</p>
<p>of brain activity that we&rsquo;d like to see return to normal,</p>
<p>but also to read out continuously what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in some of these deep regions of the brain</p>
<p>during most of life when these patients are not seizing.</p>
<p>Most of the time they&rsquo;re not seizing,</p>
<p>most of the time they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>And so we are now working on mapping</p>
<p>those deep brain regions</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t even usually get with EEG scalp electrodes</p>
<p>because the changes deep inside don&rsquo;t reach the surface.</p>
<p>But interesting when some of those regions</p>
<p>are activated, we see a big skin conductance response.</p>
<p>Who would have thunk it, right?</p>
<p>Like nothing here, but something here.</p>
<p>In fact, right after seizures</p>
<p>that we think are the most dangerous ones</p>
<p>that precede what&rsquo;s called SUDEP,</p>
<p>Sudden Unexpected Death and Epilepsy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a period where the brainwaves go flat</p>
<p>and it looks like the person&rsquo;s brain has stopped,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The activity has gone deep into a region</p>
<p>that can make the cortical activity look flat,</p>
<p>like a quick shutdown signal here.</p>
<p>It can unfortunately cause breathing to stop</p>
<p>if it progresses long enough.</p>
<p>Before that happens, we see a big skin conductance response</p>
<p>in the data that we have.</p>
<p>The longer this flattening, the bigger our response here.</p>
<p>So we have been trying to learn, you know, initially,</p>
<p>like why are we getting a big response here</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s nothing here?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out there&rsquo;s something much deeper.</p>
<p>So we can now go inside the brains</p>
<p>of some of these individuals, fabulous people</p>
<p>who usually aren&rsquo;t seizing,</p>
<p>and get this data and start to map it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the active research that we&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>with top medical partners.</p>
<p>So this wearable sensor that&rsquo;s looking at skin conductance</p>
<p>can capture sort of the ripples of the complexity</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in our brain.</p>
<p>So this little device, you have a hope</p>
<p>that you can start to get the signal</p>
<p>from the interesting things happening in the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve already published the strong correlations</p>
<p>between the size of this response</p>
<p>and the flattening that happens afterwards.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, also in a real SUDEP case</p>
<p>where the patient died because the, well, we don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if somebody was there,</p>
<p>it would have definitely prevented it.</p>
<p>But we know that most SUDEPs happen</p>
<p>when the person&rsquo;s alone.</p>
<p>And in this case, a SUDEP is an acronym, S U D E P.</p>
<p>And it stands for the number two cause</p>
<p>of years of life lost actually</p>
<p>among all neurological disorders.</p>
<p>Stroke is number one, SUDEP is number two,</p>
<p>but most people haven&rsquo;t heard of it.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ll plug my TED talk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the front page of TED right now</p>
<p>that talks about this.</p>
<p>And we hope to change that.</p>
<p>I hope everybody who&rsquo;s heard of SIDS and stroke</p>
<p>will now hear of SUDEP</p>
<p>because we think in most cases it&rsquo;s preventable</p>
<p>if people take their meds and aren&rsquo;t alone</p>
<p>when they have a seizure.</p>
<p>Not guaranteed to be preventable.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions,</p>
<p>but we think most cases probably are.</p>
<p>So you had this embrace now in the version two wristband,</p>
<p>right, for epilepsy management.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s FDA approved?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which is kind of a clear.</p>
<p>FDA cleared, they say.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It essentially means it&rsquo;s approved for marketing.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Just a side note, how difficult is that to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially getting FDA approval</p>
<p>for computer science technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so agonizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder than publishing multiple papers</p>
<p>in top medical journals.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve published peer reviewed</p>
<p>top medical journal neurology, best results,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good enough for the FDA.</p>
<p>Is that system,</p>
<p>so if we look at the peer review of medical journals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s flaws, there&rsquo;s strengths,</p>
<p>is the FDA approval process,</p>
<p>how does it compare to the peer review process?</p>
<p>Does it have the strength?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take peer review over FDA any day.</p>
<p>But is that a good thing?</p>
<p>Is that a good thing for FDA?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, does it stop some amazing technology</p>
<p>from getting through?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>The FDA performs a very important good role</p>
<p>in keeping people safe.</p>
<p>They keep things,</p>
<p>they put you through tons of safety testing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s wonderful and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of the safety testing.</p>
<p>But sometimes they put you through additional testing</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have to explain why they put you through it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re going through it</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very frustrating.</p>
<p>And maybe they have really good reasons</p>
<p>and they just would,</p>
<p>it would do people a service to articulate those reasons.</p>
<p>Be more transparent.</p>
<p>So as part of Empatica, you have sensors.</p>
<p>So what kind of problems can we crack?</p>
<p>What kind of things from seizures to autism</p>
<p>to I think I&rsquo;ve heard you mentioned depression.</p>
<p>What kind of things can we alleviate?</p>
<p>Can we detect?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your hope of what,</p>
<p>how we can make the world a better place</p>
<p>with this wearable tech?</p>
<p>I would really like to see my fellow brilliant researchers</p>
<p>step back and say, what are the really hard problems</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how to solve</p>
<p>that come from people maybe we don&rsquo;t even see</p>
<p>in our normal life because they&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>in the poor places.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stuck on the bus.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even afford the Uber or the Lyft</p>
<p>or the data plan or all these other wonderful things</p>
<p>we have that we keep improving on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s all these folks left behind in the world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re struggling with horrible diseases</p>
<p>with depression, with epilepsy, with diabetes,</p>
<p>with just awful stuff that maybe a little more time</p>
<p>and attention hanging out with them</p>
<p>and learning what are their challenges in life?</p>
<p>What are their needs?</p>
<p>How do we help them have job skills?</p>
<p>How do we help them have a hope and a future</p>
<p>and a chance to have the great life</p>
<p>that so many of us building technology have?</p>
<p>And then how would that reshape the kinds of AI</p>
<p>that we build? How would that reshape the new apps</p>
<p>that we build or the maybe we need to focus</p>
<p>on how to make things more low cost and green</p>
<p>instead of thousand dollar phones?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, why can&rsquo;t we be thinking more</p>
<p>about things that do more with less for these folks?</p>
<p>Quality of life is not related to the cost of your phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that, it&rsquo;s been shown that what about</p>
<p>$75,000 of income and happiness is the same, okay?</p>
<p>However, I can tell you, you get a lot of happiness</p>
<p>from helping other people.</p>
<p>You get a lot more than $75,000 buys.</p>
<p>So how do we connect up the people who have real needs</p>
<p>with the people who have the ability to build the future</p>
<p>and build the kind of future that truly improves the lives</p>
<p>of all the people that are currently being left behind?</p>
<p>So let me return just briefly on a point,</p>
<p>maybe in the movie, Her.</p>
<p>So do you think if we look farther into the future,</p>
<p>you said so much of the benefit from making our technology</p>
<p>more empathetic to us human beings would make them</p>
<p>better tools, empower us, make our lives better.</p>
<p>Well, if we look farther into the future,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll ever create an AI system</p>
<p>that we can fall in love with?</p>
<p>That we can fall in love with and loves us back</p>
<p>on a level that is similar to human to human interaction,</p>
<p>like in the movie Her or beyond?</p>
<p>I think we can simulate it in ways that could,</p>
<p>you know, sustain engagement for a while.</p>
<p>Would it be as good as another person?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, if you&rsquo;re used to like good people.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve just grown up with nothing but abuse</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t stand human beings,</p>
<p>can we do something that helps you there</p>
<p>that gives you something through a machine?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s pretty low bar, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve only encountered pretty awful people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve encountered wonderful, amazing people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re nowhere near building anything like that.</p>
<p>And I would not bet on building it.</p>
<p>I would bet instead on building the kinds of AI</p>
<p>that helps kind of raise all boats,</p>
<p>that helps all people be better people,</p>
<p>helps all people figure out if they&rsquo;re getting sick tomorrow</p>
<p>and helps give them what they need to stay well tomorrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of AI I wanna build</p>
<p>that improves human lives,</p>
<p>not the kind of AI that just walks on The Tonight Show</p>
<p>and people go, wow, look how smart that is.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And then it goes back in a box, you know?</p>
<p>So on that point,</p>
<p>if we continue looking a little bit into the future,</p>
<p>do you think an AI that&rsquo;s empathetic</p>
<p>and does improve our lives</p>
<p>need to have a physical presence, a body?</p>
<p>And even let me cautiously say the C word consciousness</p>
<p>and even fear of mortality.</p>
<p>So some of those human characteristics,</p>
<p>do you think it needs to have those aspects</p>
<p>or can it remain simply a machine learning tool</p>
<p>that learns from data of behavior</p>
<p>that learns to make us,</p>
<p>based on previous patterns, feel better?</p>
<p>Or does it need those elements of consciousness?</p>
<p>It depends on your goals.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re making a movie, it needs a body.</p>
<p>It needs a gorgeous body.</p>
<p>It needs to act like it has consciousness.</p>
<p>It needs to act like it has emotion, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what sells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna get me to show up and enjoy the movie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In real life, does it need all that?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve read Orson Scott Card,</p>
<p>Ender&rsquo;s Game, Speaker of the Dead,</p>
<p>it could just be like a little voice in your earring, right?</p>
<p>And you could have an intimate relationship</p>
<p>and it could get to know you.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a robot.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make this compelling of a movie, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we already think it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>when a guy looks like he&rsquo;s talking to himself on the train,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s earbuds.</p>
<p>So we have these, embodied is more powerful.</p>
<p>Embodied, when you compare interactions</p>
<p>with an embodied robot versus a video of a robot</p>
<p>versus no robot, the robot is more engaging.</p>
<p>The robot gets our attention more.</p>
<p>The robot, when you walk in your house,</p>
<p>is more likely to get you to remember to do the things</p>
<p>that you asked it to do,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of got a physical presence.</p>
<p>You can avoid it if you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>It could see you&rsquo;re avoiding it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of power to being embodied.</p>
<p>There will be embodied AIs.</p>
<p>They have great power and opportunity and potential.</p>
<p>There will also be AIs that aren&rsquo;t embodied,</p>
<p>that just are little software assistants</p>
<p>that help us with different things</p>
<p>that may get to know things about us.</p>
<p>Will they be conscious?</p>
<p>There will be attempts to program them</p>
<p>to make them appear to be conscious.</p>
<p>We can already write programs that make it look like,</p>
<p>oh, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m aware that you&rsquo;re there, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s trivial to say stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to fool people,</p>
<p>but does it actually have conscious experience like we do?</p>
<p>Nobody has a clue how to do that yet.</p>
<p>That seems to be something that is beyond</p>
<p>what any of us knows how to build now.</p>
<p>Will it have to have that?</p>
<p>I think you can get pretty far</p>
<p>with a lot of stuff without it.</p>
<p>But will we accord it rights?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s more a political game</p>
<p>than it is a question of real consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, can you go to jail for turning off Alexa</p>
<p>is the question for an election maybe a few decades from now.</p>
<p>Well, Sophia Robot&rsquo;s already been given rights</p>
<p>as a citizen in Saudi Arabia, right?</p>
<p>Even before women have full rights.</p>
<p>Then the robot was still put back in the box</p>
<p>to be shipped to the next place</p>
<p>where it would get a paid appearance, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s dark and almost comedic, if not absurd.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard you speak about your journey in finding faith.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And how you discovered some wisdoms about life</p>
<p>and beyond from reading the Bible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also heard you say that,</p>
<p>you said scientists too often assume</p>
<p>that nothing exists beyond what can be currently measured.</p>
<p>Yeah, materialism.</p>
<p>Materialism.</p>
<p>And scientism, yeah.</p>
<p>So in some sense, this assumption enables</p>
<p>the near term scientific method,</p>
<p>assuming that we can uncover the mysteries of this world</p>
<p>by the mechanisms of measurement that we currently have.</p>
<p>But we easily forget that we&rsquo;ve made this assumption.</p>
<p>So what do you think we miss out on</p>
<p>by making that assumption?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to limit the scientific method</p>
<p>to things we can measure and reason about and reproduce.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I think we have to recognize</p>
<p>that sometimes we scientists also believe</p>
<p>in things that happen historically.</p>
<p>Like I believe the Holocaust happened.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove events from past history scientifically.</p>
<p>You prove them with historical evidence, right?</p>
<p>With the impact they had on people,</p>
<p>with eyewitness testimony and things like that.</p>
<p>So a good thinker recognizes that science</p>
<p>is one of many ways to get knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been some really bad philosophy</p>
<p>and bad thinking recently, you can call it scientism,</p>
<p>where people say science is the only way to get to truth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, it just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There are other ways that work also.</p>
<p>Like knowledge of love with someone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t prove your love through science, right?</p>
<p>So history, philosophy, love,</p>
<p>a lot of other things in life show us</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more ways to gain knowledge and truth</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to believe there is such a thing,</p>
<p>and I believe there is, than science.</p>
<p>I do, I am a scientist, however.</p>
<p>And in my science, I do limit my science</p>
<p>to the things that the scientific method can do.</p>
<p>But I recognize that it&rsquo;s myopic</p>
<p>to say that that&rsquo;s all there is.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s, just like you listed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the why questions.</p>
<p>And really we know, if we&rsquo;re being honest with ourselves,</p>
<p>the percent of what we really know is basically zero</p>
<p>relative to the full mystery of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Measure theory, a set of measure zero,</p>
<p>if I have a finite amount of knowledge, which I do.</p>
<p>So you said that you believe in truth.</p>
<p>So let me ask that old question.</p>
<p>What do you think this thing is all about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the life on earth?</p>
<p>Life, the universe, and everything?</p>
<p>And everything, what&rsquo;s the meaning?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quote Douglas Adams 42.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite number.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s my street address.</p>
<p>My husband and I guessed the exact same number</p>
<p>for our house, we got to pick it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason we picked 42, yeah.</p>
<p>So is it just 42 or is there,</p>
<p>do you have other words that you can put around it?</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a grand adventure</p>
<p>and I think this life is a part of it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than meets the eye</p>
<p>and the heart and the mind and the soul here.</p>
<p>I think we see but through a glass dimly in this life.</p>
<p>We see only a part of all there is to know.</p>
<p>If people haven&rsquo;t read the Bible, they should,</p>
<p>if they consider themselves educated</p>
<p>and you could read Proverbs</p>
<p>and find tremendous wisdom in there</p>
<p>that cannot be scientifically proven.</p>
<p>But when you read it, there&rsquo;s something in you,</p>
<p>like a musician knows when the instruments played right</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in you that comes alive</p>
<p>and knows that there&rsquo;s a truth there</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like your strings are being plucked by the master</p>
<p>instead of by me, right, playing when I pluck it.</p>
<p>But probably when you play, it sounds spectacular, right?</p>
<p>And when you encounter those truths,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in you that sings</p>
<p>and knows that there is more</p>
<p>than what I can prove mathematically</p>
<p>or program a computer to do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the math is gorgeous.</p>
<p>The computer programming can be brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring, right?</p>
<p>We wanna do more.</p>
<p>None of this squashes my desire to do science</p>
<p>or to get knowledge through science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dissing the science at all.</p>
<p>I grow even more in awe of what the science can do</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m more in awe of all there is we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And really at the heart of science,</p>
<p>you have to have a belief that there&rsquo;s truth,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something greater to be discovered.</p>
<p>And some scientists may not wanna use the faith word,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s faith that drives us to do science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s faith that there is truth,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something to know that we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s worth knowing, that it&rsquo;s worth working hard,</p>
<p>and that there is meaning,</p>
<p>that there is such a thing as meaning,</p>
<p>which by the way, science can&rsquo;t prove either.</p>
<p>We have to kind of start with some assumptions</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s things like truth and meaning.</p>
<p>And these are really questions philosophers own, right?</p>
<p>This is their space,</p>
<p>of philosophers and theologians at some level.</p>
<p>So these are things science,</p>
<p>when people claim that science will tell you all truth,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a name for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own kind of faith.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scientism and it&rsquo;s very myopic.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a much bigger world out there to be explored</p>
<p>in ways that science may not,</p>
<p>at least for now, allow us to explore.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s meaning and purpose and hope</p>
<p>and joy and love and all these awesome things</p>
<p>that make it all worthwhile too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Roz.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thanks Lex, what a pleasure.</p>
<p>Great questions.</p>
