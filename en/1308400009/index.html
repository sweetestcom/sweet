    <p>hello friends if I sound a little weird and a little fucked up it&rsquo;s cuz I am I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sick but the show must go on so this week&rsquo;s episode is gonna be about caring</p>
<p>what other people think of you so everyone says that you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>but I disagree I think you should care what people think of you and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>being a smartass I promise like I&rsquo;m about to get into this but it just seems</p>
<p>like every time we turn around it&rsquo;s like everyone&rsquo;s trying to figure out how to</p>
<p>not give a fuck how to stop caring but I&rsquo;m here to deconstruct why you actually</p>
<p>should care and also why you actually cannot stop caring like you&rsquo;re not able</p>
<p>to not care what people think of you it goes against everything you are as a</p>
<p>human being sorry sorry to burst a little bubble but you will never not care</p>
<p>what people think of you and that&rsquo;s normal it&rsquo;s fine but I&rsquo;m gonna teach you</p>
<p>some things also in this episode of how to make that work in your favor okay</p>
<p>first things first so when I said you can&rsquo;t not care what people think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>truth and I&rsquo;m about to deconstruct that real quick so human beings are</p>
<p>relationally dependent like our species we need each other to survive like you</p>
<p>need closeness with others to survive and your body is hardwired that way</p>
<p>cuz try and fight me bitch try and fight me on it look at a baby if you have a</p>
<p>newborn baby and you put it in the middle of a living room floor and you</p>
<p>just leave it there what&rsquo;s gonna happen to it it&rsquo;s gonna fucking die because it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take care of itself you have to rely on other people to take care of you</p>
<p>you have to rely on other people for your survival so your body doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forget this like when you were a baby your nervous system was hardwired to</p>
<p>need other people because if you don&rsquo;t have other people it means you die your</p>
<p>body doesn&rsquo;t forget that you cannot unwire that we are relationally</p>
<p>dependent as fuck so your body&rsquo;s kind of working against you when it comes to not</p>
<p>caring how people think because when you&rsquo;re growing up if you don&rsquo;t behave</p>
<p>correctly or if you do something wrong to make your parent not like you that</p>
<p>means they can withhold things you need so you&rsquo;re pretty much trained to act</p>
<p>good and right and be a good little boy or be a good little girl so that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking die that&rsquo;s the message your body gets so that alone explains</p>
<p>why you care so much what people think of you you shouldn&rsquo;t beat yourself up</p>
<p>for it you shouldn&rsquo;t get mad at yourself because you do care what people</p>
<p>think have some compassion like loosen the fucking reins a little bit loosen</p>
<p>the leash on yourself and quit getting mad at yourself that you care because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally normal and what&rsquo;s funny is everything is different so what one</p>
<p>parent would see as an acceptable behavior another parent wouldn&rsquo;t if you</p>
<p>look at different cultures it&rsquo;s obvious like certain kids are allowed to do</p>
<p>certain things in one home but if they were in another home that shit would not</p>
<p>fly so everybody&rsquo;s definition of what is good and right is just based off what</p>
<p>got them approval as a child and throughout their life and like their</p>
<p>upbringing so no one really knows what&rsquo;s right and actually wrong everyone&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>of it is skewed and different so there is no one-size-fits-all for this is an</p>
<p>okay thing and this is a not okay thing and that goes for things you can control</p>
<p>like your behavior and your personality and things you can&rsquo;t control like your</p>
<p>physical appearance and your body and attributes it goes both ways for either</p>
<p>of them so one person could judge it good and one person can judge it bad and</p>
<p>neither are wrong it&rsquo;s just subjective to whoever is judging the situation but</p>
<p>yeah your body is hardwired to care what people think because your ego is trying</p>
<p>to keep you alive and it does that by staying close to people so if you have a</p>
<p>certain behavior or a certain thing about you that people have always told</p>
<p>you is bad or wrong you&rsquo;re gonna cut off from that you&rsquo;re gonna stop doing it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stop acting that certain way and if it&rsquo;s something that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control or can&rsquo;t change you&rsquo;re just gonna try and hide it but you never knew</p>
<p>something was wrong about you or bad about you until someone told you it was</p>
<p>because when you come in this fucking earth as a baby you don&rsquo;t know jack shit</p>
<p>you are taught what is acceptable and unacceptable and like I said everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>version of what&rsquo;s acceptable versus unacceptable is due to their own shit</p>
<p>you know what I mean like their own upbringing so no one really knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and I find comfort in that like no one really knows what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on and nothing about you is actually bad or wrong basically your</p>
<p>body works against you because when someone rejects you your fight-or-flight</p>
<p>mode will trigger like your body will have a full-fledged fucking reaction</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a threat so when you wear a risky outfit or you wear something that</p>
<p>could potentially lead you to being rejected you&rsquo;re gonna be anxious you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be nervous that&rsquo;s normal you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking get away from that</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just your body&rsquo;s response to fear so since you can&rsquo;t control that you</p>
<p>do care what people think about you what you can do is use it to your advantage</p>
<p>and use it as a compass and kind of like a guide to the people that you&rsquo;re meant</p>
<p>to be around and also as a way to help you stay away from the people you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>meant to be around like if someone doesn&rsquo;t like me I want to know you know</p>
<p>what I mean I care that they don&rsquo;t like me because how I respond and what I</p>
<p>choose to do that&rsquo;s a good piece of information to have so if I want to go</p>
<p>be friends with someone and I know that they don&rsquo;t like gay people everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allowed to have a preference watch your fucking mouth okay you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>polite and respectful but you&rsquo;re allowed to have a preference if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>gay people that&rsquo;s fine but I&rsquo;m gonna know that and I&rsquo;m gonna care that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like gay people so I&rsquo;m gonna set the fuck away from them or I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>know if we do have any sort of interaction it&rsquo;s gonna be superficial</p>
<p>and I should know not to try and go deeper with it because they&rsquo;re not a</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s like a valid connection for me you need to care about people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>preferences because if my goal is to make a friend that&rsquo;s not the fucking</p>
<p>friend I should go try to make I need to go find people that are okay with gay</p>
<p>people but if I just ignored that and I tried to be friends with this person</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna go well it&rsquo;s gonna bite me in the ass and if I don&rsquo;t take into</p>
<p>consideration people&rsquo;s preferences I&rsquo;m gonna set myself up to get my feelings</p>
<p>hurt so you need to be preventative you need to read the room you need</p>
<p>situational awareness that is basically the big phrase for read the room but</p>
<p>even a situation like that if I try to tell myself oh I don&rsquo;t give a fuck he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like gay people fuck him for what like why am I gonna go get pissed</p>
<p>off and get mad that you don&rsquo;t like what I am who gives a shit you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>have a preference the other great thing about looking at what people think and</p>
<p>how they think will kind of reveal a lot of shit about them because you can see</p>
<p>the way that they think about others the way they think about topics they way</p>
<p>they think about certain situations and that will reveal who they are as a</p>
<p>person and then you can judge that is this a person I want to be around do</p>
<p>they have an open mindset are they accepting are they loving are they</p>
<p>empathetic or are they the opposite because if they&rsquo;re the opposite run for</p>
<p>the hills bitch use this inability to stop caring what people think flip it</p>
<p>and use it to make your life better so if you can&rsquo;t stop caring what people</p>
<p>think use it to your advantage use the way that people think as an interview if</p>
<p>they should be your friend or not or a partner if you&rsquo;re gonna get into a</p>
<p>relationship you need to care what people think and how they think because</p>
<p>it lets you in on how their brain works and the kind of person they are so when</p>
<p>it comes to freaking out over if people like you or not it comes to really not</p>
<p>trusting your own judgment so when someone criticizes you for something or</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like you you make it mean that they&rsquo;re right let&rsquo;s say I want to revamp</p>
<p>my style and I want to try dressing in a new way so I have a new little outfit on</p>
<p>I like the way that I feel in it when I look in the mirror at myself I like it I</p>
<p>think the outfit is cute I&rsquo;m like yeah let&rsquo;s go so when you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>something new you&rsquo;re already gonna be a little like insecure in it it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>first time in it you&rsquo;re not that comfortable so when you&rsquo;re on the way to</p>
<p>go somewhere you&rsquo;re already gonna be a little anxious that&rsquo;s normal and then</p>
<p>when you get there if you&rsquo;re in your new little like getup you&rsquo;re gonna be a</p>
<p>little worried about how people respond to it you&rsquo;re gonna be sensitive to</p>
<p>criticism more than usual when you&rsquo;re uncomfortable and trying something new</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re out and your friend tells you like what the fuck are you wearing</p>
<p>or if they said that they don&rsquo;t like it or they criticize what you&rsquo;re wearing in</p>
<p>any way no shit it&rsquo;s gonna hurt your feelings no shit how I used to be was I</p>
<p>would trust other people&rsquo;s judgments more than my own so if my friend said my</p>
<p>new outfit looked like shit or it looked weird I would immediately get insecure</p>
<p>and be like fuck oh my god I want to go change I want to go take it off and I</p>
<p>wish I didn&rsquo;t fucking do this because right there in that moment when my</p>
<p>friend said that the outfit looked bad I believed it I threw away my opinion of</p>
<p>what I thought about the outfit because when I was at home and I looked in the</p>
<p>mirror I liked the outfit I thought I looked fucking good so when my friend</p>
<p>just said it looked like shit I immediately replaced my opinion with</p>
<p>theirs and I made it the truth and that is why I want to go fucking change so</p>
<p>bad I used to not be able to hold space for other people&rsquo;s opinions I would take</p>
<p>them on and like make them more important than my own so if someone else</p>
<p>said my outfit looked like shit I believed it and something that really</p>
<p>helped me stop doing that is to remind myself that I have fucking eyeballs so</p>
<p>with this example go in the mirror if you like your outfit and you can see</p>
<p>physically that it looks good and you like it then it looks good I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what used to not click in my brain but I did not trust my judgment of myself over</p>
<p>others so if you remind yourself no I looked at myself in the mirror before I</p>
<p>left I liked my outfit I think it looks cute you can stand there in front of</p>
<p>your friend and not give a fuck what they think of your outfit because you</p>
<p>know it looks good you&rsquo;re allowed to have different tastes and different</p>
<p>preferences I hope your friend is not telling you yo you look like fucking</p>
<p>shit I hope they&rsquo;re nicer than that but when you do face criticism for something</p>
<p>that you like don&rsquo;t just immediately throw away your opinion of it stop</p>
<p>yourself and remind yourself no this looks cute I like it you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>like it even if other people don&rsquo;t and honestly the most ill-dressed</p>
<p>motherfuckers are the ones that want to come to you about the way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dressed and I think that shit is funny but you don&rsquo;t have to let that make you</p>
<p>feel less confident you like just remind yourself their opinion of what is</p>
<p>right and wrong and what looks good and what doesn&rsquo;t is theirs that&rsquo;s from their</p>
<p>upbringing from their experiences and their life we don&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>definition of what is cool and what is not cool they&rsquo;re not gonna like what I</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re allowed to be different but remember that you have fucking eyes you</p>
<p>know what looks good and you know what doesn&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t compare to what you see</p>
<p>and what everybody else is doing look at yourself by yourself in the fucking</p>
<p>mirror does it look good or does it not okay if you agree it looks good then</p>
<p>keep that all night when you&rsquo;re in your new outfit or you&rsquo;re in whatever you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wearing remind yourself I look fucking good anytime that insecure voice in the</p>
<p>back your head comes up or the fear of what are people thinking no I look good</p>
<p>it might not be what they&rsquo;re used to but I look good and the same thing goes with</p>
<p>personality just because one person doesn&rsquo;t like something doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>everybody else will hate it because my personality is very in your fucking face</p>
<p>and very like outspoken and I swear a lot I swear a whole bunch because I like</p>
<p>to be casual and comfortable and other people don&rsquo;t like that they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>people with personalities like mine does that mean my personality is bad no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not for them some people were raised in a home where swearing was bad</p>
<p>wherever being relaxed and expressing how you truly feel and what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking was bad so they&rsquo;re gonna look at me like I&rsquo;m bad because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>behave the way that they do I&rsquo;m not a fucking prude in the club standing there</p>
<p>with my drink not moving bitch I&rsquo;m shaking ass I&rsquo;m having fun I&rsquo;m swearing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking shots I&rsquo;m in a great time even if I am by myself having fun by</p>
<p>myself I still don&rsquo;t give a fuck because I know that there&rsquo;s people out there</p>
<p>that appreciate me you know just because they don&rsquo;t I know there are other</p>
<p>people that do like my tick-tock is a reminder for me like I used to be so</p>
<p>fucking insecure so like cripplingly insecure and like to know that people</p>
<p>like me and for you guys that listen to my podcast you have no clue how much it</p>
<p>fucking means to me because my personality has always been received</p>
<p>weird and some people like it and some people fucking hate it there&rsquo;s no in</p>
<p>between you love me or you hate me or you&rsquo;re intimidated but we&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>talk about that but yeah I&rsquo;m the prime example like there are some people that</p>
<p>fucking hate my guts just because I&rsquo;m everything that they were taught was</p>
<p>wrong they can have like I said they can shut the fuck up and have their opinion</p>
<p>but they can have their opinion you know like they&rsquo;re not gonna voice it to me</p>
<p>and expect me to be nice but they&rsquo;re allowed to not like me so the thing that</p>
<p>will really wreck you and what wrecked me for a long fucking time was trying to</p>
<p>control people&rsquo;s perception of me and the way that people looked at me or</p>
<p>thought of me because you can&rsquo;t you cannot control the way that people see</p>
<p>you you can do things to influence it like the way you dress the way you act</p>
<p>the way you walk the shit that you do you can do a bunch of things to</p>
<p>influence it but you can never fully control the way that people perceive you</p>
<p>if someone just doesn&rsquo;t like you sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to</p>
<p>make them like you people don&rsquo;t realize when you try to control how people see</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re gonna lose yourself you&rsquo;re gonna completely fucking you lose</p>
<p>yourself because instead of being who you are and standing in that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be running around going fucking insane no I have to say this no I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say this no I have to do this I have to do that oh my god no I can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna think this of me all you&rsquo;re gonna do is run yourself</p>
<p>fucking stupid and I did it for so long like I had to run myself to a point of</p>
<p>exhaustion and complete frustration where anything I ever did never worked</p>
<p>to get people to like me or to look at me a certain way so now I&rsquo;m at a point</p>
<p>where I got so frustrated I was like fuck it like fuck it fuck you in your</p>
<p>face I&rsquo;m done like I&rsquo;m done with the effort of trying to get people to see me</p>
<p>a certain way if you don&rsquo;t see it you don&rsquo;t see it your loss if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>me okay have fun I tried to fit so many different molds it never worked you can</p>
<p>just tell when someone&rsquo;s trying to fit a certain mold you know like when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to be a certain thing like these people that dress like these tick-tock</p>
<p>people I don&rsquo;t even have to call them like the little tick-tock kids with the</p>
<p>pearl necklaces and the fucking Jordan ones and the shorts and like the baggy</p>
<p>cargo pants and the fucking oversized t-shirt the Bass Pro Shop hat I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why everyone&rsquo;s wearing those fucking hats but you know that typical</p>
<p>style that everybody tries to do that&rsquo;s for people with no identity the people</p>
<p>that follow the trends really heavily are the ones that are kind of trying to</p>
<p>fit the mold or they&rsquo;re lost and they&rsquo;re just a latching on to what is getting</p>
<p>people attention they&rsquo;re latching on to what is like cool and what is getting</p>
<p>people approval you know if you look at someone like me I don&rsquo;t dress like other</p>
<p>people I just like a fuckboy sometimes but I always have my own elements to my</p>
<p>style and I&rsquo;ve tried I have spent so much money trying to dress like other</p>
<p>people I only wear black I have since I was in high school my whole family</p>
<p>usually just we all just do fucking all black all of our cars all black my cat</p>
<p>is black all my clothes everything I own is fucking black that&rsquo;s just how we are</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tried so many times to wear color it makes me so fucking</p>
<p>uncomfortable and I just feel like you can tell it&rsquo;s so forced like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to like fit in and wear color and not look like a scary fucking</p>
<p>Albanian you know I mean like I feel like people can tell so I&rsquo;ve really just</p>
<p>like grabbed myself by the nuts and be like look we&rsquo;re gonna dress how we want</p>
<p>to fucking dress I&rsquo;m gonna dress how I feel comfortable and that&rsquo;s it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care if I look weird to other people this is what I feel comfortable in this</p>
<p>is what I like I&rsquo;m not gonna wear no colored fucking shit because it looks</p>
<p>stupid on me it doesn&rsquo;t fit my personality I got enough personality</p>
<p>okay I need all black to like chill me the fuck out because if I&rsquo;m out in some</p>
<p>colors and I behave the way that I do that&rsquo;s too much it&rsquo;s too fucking much</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m tall please get real like that&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just not me I can&rsquo;t do it and</p>
<p>you have no clue how many times people have tried to change that about me and</p>
<p>make me wear color and make me do all kind of shit like every once in a while</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wear something with some color on it okay but majority of my shit is</p>
<p>always black but my point with that was like trying to fit a mold people can</p>
<p>tell when you&rsquo;re faking it people can tell when you&rsquo;re trying to be something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not and when you&rsquo;re trying to like pretend to like something that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like like these tiktokers the people that dress like this shit and buy</p>
<p>everything off sheen my fucker we see through y&rsquo;all like well I do the aware</p>
<p>ones to see through it you&rsquo;re lost and that&rsquo;s okay we all have to get to a</p>
<p>point where we&rsquo;re fucking lost because I had to get there to find myself you can</p>
<p>never find yourself until you lose yourself so congrats you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>pivotal point where you&rsquo;re gonna completely lose yourself and get so</p>
<p>fucking frustrated that you come back to yourself so I&rsquo;m happy for you it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>suck and it&rsquo;s gonna be very fucking painful but big changes are coming for</p>
<p>everybody that&rsquo;s in that stage but my thing about dressing in black and trying</p>
<p>to wear color it&rsquo;s not for me I don&rsquo;t like it so instead of trying to force</p>
<p>myself to like something that I know I don&rsquo;t like I just allow myself to put my</p>
<p>energy into other shit because if I&rsquo;m just sitting here constantly like</p>
<p>getting fucked up over what I have to wear and trying too hard to look a</p>
<p>certain way and dress a certain way like that&rsquo;s energy I could be spending doing</p>
<p>shit that is more beneficial with my time I don&rsquo;t care if people don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>my all black get up in my fucking Timberlands I don&rsquo;t give a shit I like</p>
<p>it and I have this I don&rsquo;t give a fuck attitude I think because I&rsquo;ve spent so</p>
<p>much of my life isolated with no friends no people around me nothing to do that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not scared to lose people I prefer to be by myself I love my alone time if</p>
<p>I spend too much time around people I start freaking the fuck out cuz I need</p>
<p>to get back to like myself I need to go spend time alone you know but my ability</p>
<p>to just say fuck it I&rsquo;m gonna wear what I want to wear and be who I am is not</p>
<p>something that you can just go to the store and buy it&rsquo;s not something that</p>
<p>you just have or don&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s built like I said I got</p>
<p>to a point that I was so frustrated and overwhelmed and like pissed off that I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do anything right it seemed that I just threw my hands up and said</p>
<p>fuck it I&rsquo;m gonna do what&rsquo;s easier for me and that&rsquo;s be myself and my whole</p>
<p>thing about not being scared to lose people I am like I am so scared of</p>
<p>losing people and abandonment but I&rsquo;ve spent so much time alone like I said</p>
<p>that I have no problem with it like once I get over the sadness of like oh I lost</p>
<p>you once I get over that disappointment I&rsquo;m fine I know how to sit by myself and</p>
<p>I know how to be by myself and have no one but that&rsquo;s also something that is</p>
<p>built and learned and earned that is not something that you just have and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not fucking easy that is one of the hardest things you will ever go through</p>
<p>if you ever have to go through that and if you have been through that I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>because I understand it exactly but isolation is like fucking torture</p>
<p>because like I said we&rsquo;re meant to be around people we&rsquo;re meant to be</p>
<p>connected to people that&rsquo;s just the discomfort that I have the skill of</p>
<p>dealing with now I don&rsquo;t like to deal with it I don&rsquo;t want to fucking be</p>
<p>alone I&rsquo;m so scared to be abandoned like I&rsquo;ll own that shit if I can get my</p>
<p>hands on you I will beat the fuck out of you if you abandon me but I&rsquo;m terrified</p>
<p>of that shit everybody is and being alone it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s comfortable and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy but I can deal with it that&rsquo;s a pain I&rsquo;ve got a tolerance to now I can</p>
<p>deal with that whereas someone who&rsquo;s been surrounded by people their whole</p>
<p>life is gonna be a lot more scared to lose people because they don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to exist without them a lot of people&rsquo;s identities are who they hang out with</p>
<p>and the friend groups that they have and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing but that</p>
<p>definitely will contribute to people being scared to express their true self</p>
<p>because of being a certain way has gotten you accepted your entire life and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just been putting on a show and you know that&rsquo;s not the real you when</p>
<p>you do reveal the real you of course you&rsquo;re scared you don&rsquo;t know if that</p>
<p>version of you is accepted or not you know the facade is that you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>putting on this mask you&rsquo;ve been hiding behind everybody accepts that everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine with that that got you closeness but the real you behind that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scared shitless because you don&rsquo;t know if people will like that one the true</p>
<p>you you haven&rsquo;t showed it to anybody but I do need to talk about the bravery that</p>
<p>it takes to be the real you and there&rsquo;s also a hidden positive that comes from</p>
<p>it because if you keep hiding behind who you really are because you&rsquo;re scared</p>
<p>of what people think that&rsquo;s all your life is ever gonna be the only way to</p>
<p>find people that are gonna accept you for you is to show them the real you</p>
<p>because how are people supposed to know who you are how are people supposed to</p>
<p>be able to accept you if you don&rsquo;t show yourself to them you&rsquo;re never gonna find</p>
<p>the people that you actually will connect with and I will actually love</p>
<p>you deeply for who you truly are if you never put yourself out there and I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of relief that comes with that because like with my</p>
<p>tik-tok I&rsquo;ve got like 90 something thousand people that like me what the</p>
<p>fuck they liked me enough to follow me and if I never took the chance to be</p>
<p>myself I would have never found these 90,000 people do you know how many</p>
<p>people that is I bitch I was lucky if like a hundred people liked me but 90,000</p>
<p>that shit makes me anxious is thinking about it but my point is and I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have found these people I wouldn&rsquo;t have known that I was actually lovable and</p>
<p>likable being the way that I am until I was the way that I am you have to take</p>
<p>the fucking chance of showing yourself to the world to find the people that</p>
<p>truly are meant to be with you and to be around you if you keep playing it safe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only gonna have a mediocre life and I know not everyone can be special</p>
<p>like some people have to be average some people have to live a normal average</p>
<p>fucking life I&rsquo;m not gonna choose to be one of them that don&rsquo;t sit right with me</p>
<p>but if you keep playing it safe you&rsquo;re committing to me an average so have fun</p>
<p>with that I do want to slam this fucking point into everybody&rsquo;s head that</p>
<p>just because someone doesn&rsquo;t approve of something doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s bad it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re wrong it doesn&rsquo;t mean that anything is wrong with</p>
<p>you because just like there is someone that disapproves of it there is someone</p>
<p>that approves of it think about fucking furries like these weirdos that dress up</p>
<p>let me let me stop let me be nice these people these individuals that dress up</p>
<p>in these fucking fur costumes and fuck each other like huh what the fuck y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>got going on but think about it like the first furry or the first person that was</p>
<p>into that didn&rsquo;t know anybody else was into that and then they started finding</p>
<p>each other but the only way to find another furry is to tell people you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>fucking furry you know you&rsquo;re never gonna know that people will accept it</p>
<p>until you share it and there will be because if there is motherfuckers that</p>
<p>are into scat if you don&rsquo;t know what that is that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re having sex</p>
<p>and people shit on each other and they play with shit if there&rsquo;s people that</p>
<p>are accepting of that I don&rsquo;t mean to kink shame but yeah I do that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>weird if there are people that are accepting of playing with each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit while they have sex there is someone that will approve of you and</p>
<p>your new little outfit and there is someone that will approve of you and</p>
<p>your true sexuality and whatever weird little quirky fucking thing that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scared to share people are ready and waiting to accept you you just have to</p>
<p>show them you but just remember that anytime you&rsquo;re scared of being rejected</p>
<p>know that there is people that accept each other and play in their shit</p>
<p>together and there&rsquo;s people that accept each other and fuck as mascots and like</p>
<p>furry costume that should make you feel better but perfect example I&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>here like yo this shit is fucking weird because that&rsquo;s my opinion but what does</p>
<p>that matter to those people they&rsquo;re still gonna do what they want to do and</p>
<p>they should if they like eating each other&rsquo;s shit let them go do it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to be serious and prove my point but this is just a topic that&rsquo;s funny if</p>
<p>they like to do that let them go do that what does my opinion matter what do I</p>
<p>expect like do I expect them to not do what they enjoy doing just because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like it who the fuck am I if you like to go play with each other in fur</p>
<p>costumes go do it like for them to let my opinion of that stop them from doing</p>
<p>what makes them happy that&rsquo;s stupid as long as you don&rsquo;t try to shit on me</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fine if you want to go do it the whole scat thing just don&rsquo;t get it near</p>
<p>me I don&rsquo;t want to see it I don&rsquo;t want to smell it but go do it go have your</p>
<p>fucking fun go live your life go do what makes you happy and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if</p>
<p>people agree with it or not why should that stop you look at the perspective</p>
<p>from the furry for a second if I&rsquo;m someone that likes to go dress up in</p>
<p>these costumes and go have sex with other furries I can sit here and</p>
<p>suppress the urge to want to do it so that other people will like me or I can</p>
<p>fully step into that community and I can go be a fucking furry and I can go find</p>
<p>furry friends and we can have a whole little community I will find people that</p>
<p>accept me fully and I go for it versus just sitting here living a life where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unhappy I don&rsquo;t feel understood by people I&rsquo;m constantly hiding a part of</p>
<p>myself to the people that are around me it&rsquo;s just a toss-up of like what life do</p>
<p>you want to live there was a boy at a club that I was at like a week ago he</p>
<p>was a twink like he was a little he had like longish hair to his shoulders and</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t like to sissy it up where he was like makeup and shit but he had like</p>
<p>a little crop top on he was like doing his little thing and he was having a</p>
<p>fucking blast and if you look at someone like me in the club how I be dressed I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna snap back in a gold chain like a fucking douchebag you don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gay because I make out with my girlfriends too but you would never</p>
<p>assume that I would be like silently rooting for him and I&rsquo;m so happy that he</p>
<p>is being his fucking self on the dance floor like we were dancing like near</p>
<p>each other and I just like kept watching out for him because I&rsquo;m very protective</p>
<p>of people anytime I see a Muslim or a gay guy or anyone that&rsquo;s like small I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>instantly like protective to the max because I&rsquo;ll be damned if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>yell at some fucking woman because she&rsquo;s wearing a hijab I will fuck your</p>
<p>shit up I will put my gun in your mouth and make you suck it like a dick I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>play that shit and like this boy was dancing to doing his thing and I live in</p>
<p>a town that&rsquo;s kind of close to Alabama so there&rsquo;s a lot of hicks there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of asleep motherfuckers and judgmental people and fucking anti-gay people so I</p>
<p>was looking out for this boy like if someone comes up to him I&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>their shit up you know what I mean but my point is you never know who is</p>
<p>silently rooting for you you only ever hear the negative voice in the back of</p>
<p>your head but you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s really proud of you for stepping out in</p>
<p>that weird outfit or being yourself dancing on the dance floor wearing your</p>
<p>crop top but when I was leaving this boy and his little girlfriends were like</p>
<p>walking by so I leaned over and I tell him on a shoulder and I was like yo I</p>
<p>love you and I just kept walking to just let him know like I&rsquo;m proud of you like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m so happy for people when they express their true self but my whole</p>
<p>point behind that was I don&rsquo;t look like someone that would I look like a</p>
<p>judgmental fucking douchebag when I go out you&rsquo;d never know that I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>aware and like with it mentally my last point I want to bring up is remember</p>
<p>when I said if you are wearing your new outfit and you looked at it in the</p>
<p>mirror and you thought it was cute and then your friend said it looked like</p>
<p>shit just please remember that other people&rsquo;s opinions do not discredit yours</p>
<p>like if you went in the mirror and you saw your outfit and you liked it and you</p>
<p>thought it was cute then it&rsquo;s cute just because someone doesn&rsquo;t like it it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re right it does not discredit your fucking vision if you</p>
<p>have eyes you can see that you look cute so if someone says you&rsquo;re ugly you can</p>
<p>like laugh and be like bitch like where because you know what you look like you</p>
<p>can trust your own judgment you can trust what you see with your own</p>
<p>fucking eyes that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for this episode I hope this helped and I</p>
<p>hope you see things from a different perspective now and I hope you give a</p>
<p>little less of a fuck or you feel inspired to be yourself but remember</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get mad at yourself for giving a fuck if you do it&rsquo;s normal your body is</p>
<p>wired that way if you like this episode leave it a 5-star rating whatever you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>listening to it on Spotify Apple podcast whatever it is leave me a little</p>
<p>five stars please but if you&rsquo;re not gonna leave me five stars don&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>fucking shit cuz I don&rsquo;t want no one star ruining my fucking day okay thank</p>
<p>you for listening I love you all be your damn self and I will talk to you next</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
