    <p>Everyone from the current prosecutor to the FBI back in 87 say the same thing.</p>
<p>Look at where her body was found.</p>
<p>Her killer knew the area, knew where he was going to take her.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true, we decided to see what the land would tell us.</p>
<p>So we pulled the deed records for the lot where Darlene was found, and we looked at</p>
<p>parcels around it.</p>
<p>And sure enough, right up the road is McCune Farms, LLC.</p>
<p>We talked in terms of coincidence.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove a case on coincidence, but man, there&rsquo;s a lot of coincidence.</p>
<p>This is Episode 10.</p>
<p>Look at the Deeds.</p>
<p>McCune Farms has changed hands a few times in the last several decades, and there are</p>
<p>different plots around Marshall County that are also listed as McCune Farms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to say which plots were whose back in the 80s, because we know that both</p>
<p>Kenneth&rsquo;s dad and his uncle were farmers, and they all lived close to each other.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s unpack this.</p>
<p>According to property records, the actual land where Darlene&rsquo;s body was found was</p>
<p>owned by this Chicago man named George Piascowi.</p>
<p>And some locals have told us that George leased the land to local farmers or timber buyers,</p>
<p>but we checked with the Marshall County Assessor&rsquo;s Office, and they have no record of who leased</p>
<p>the land in 1984.</p>
<p>They said it was common back then, and actually still is today, for landowners to lease their</p>
<p>properties for agricultural uses via a handshake deal.</p>
<p>So no documents.</p>
<p>The land just north of where Darlene&rsquo;s body was found belonged to Kenneth&rsquo;s uncle, Jim.</p>
<p>Kenneth McCune&rsquo;s uncle, who owned that farm near where the body was found, what did he</p>
<p>have to say in an interview?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Was he interviewed?</p>
<p>I think they might have made contact with him.</p>
<p>You know, even for permission to go on there, I think, but I may be mixing that up.</p>
<p>I know nothing of significance coming from that.</p>
<p>We found an old supplemental report where an officer did, in fact, interview Jim McCune.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It was just a general door knocking, seeing if he&rsquo;d seen anything, or if anything weird</p>
<p>had happened in the area recently.</p>
<p>Nothing about the report stands out, and there&rsquo;s no mention of Darlene&rsquo;s body being</p>
<p>found on his land.</p>
<p>So although the prosecutor seems to be aware of the close proximity now, I&rsquo;m not sure anyone</p>
<p>was back in 1984.</p>
<p>Now, just because Kenneth&rsquo;s family owned the property near where she was found doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean he himself would just inherently be familiar with it.</p>
<p>But if you remember, the court records we got from the 80s detailed McCune&rsquo;s jobs back</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>He worked as a bus driver for the Culver School District, a salesman at a used car dealership,</p>
<p>and as a farmhand at McCune Farms.</p>
<p>On Kenneth&rsquo;s marriage certificate, he listed his job as dairy farmer.</p>
<p>And speaking of jobs, according to various documents from back then, Kenneth worked at</p>
<p>M&amp;M Auto, a used car dealership where he had access to a number of cars.</p>
<p>The question was, were any of them the car?</p>
<p>If police had more thoroughly investigated Pam&rsquo;s case back in 1982, Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>would have already been on their radar for Darlene&rsquo;s abduction in 1984.</p>
<p>And they could have just rolled over to M&amp;M Auto, where he worked, and looked to see if</p>
<p>the car was there.</p>
<p>But now&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way to tell what kind of car he may have had access to?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We were aware that he took a vehicle to Florida.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into that.</p>
<p>Nelson wouldn&rsquo;t talk more about Florida, but he would talk about how, hypothetically,</p>
<p>you could hide a car if you had the right resources.</p>
<p>What little I know about that business is, things are, you know, they would just as soon</p>
<p>sell it, they would just as soon get a used car, clean it up, add a couple hundred bucks</p>
<p>more than they bought it for, and sell it within a couple days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what little I know about that line of work.</p>
<p>And the way they do that is they clean it out, or they sell it wholesale somewhere else</p>
<p>to another used car.</p>
<p>And it was those temporary plates that they tried to trail, but without any luck, paper</p>
<p>plates back in those days.</p>
<p>Police believe that the car had metal Indiana plates on it.</p>
<p>So what I think Nelson was trying to say is if the killer owned a car dealership or worked</p>
<p>at one, he could have taken it there right after, swapped the plates out, cleaned it</p>
<p>out, maybe even painted it and sold it out of state.</p>
<p>Now personally, I think this idea of the car being painted is really interesting, because</p>
<p>one of the consistent descriptions about the green suspect car was how bad the paint job was.</p>
<p>Witnesses who saw the car described it as chalky, bad, not normal, a homemade paint job.</p>
<p>But is there any proof Kenneth Jr. did any of this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There is no proof that he owned a green car, painted one, sold one, none of it.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a report from 1988 where police interviewed a man who bought a car</p>
<p>from Kenneth Jr. in July of 1984.</p>
<p>This man was Kenneth&rsquo;s cousin, and he told police that he traded a white Plymouth Valiant</p>
<p>for Kenneth Jr.&rsquo;s GMC Jimmy.</p>
<p>That GMC was actually the car Kenneth was driving the day he attacked Pam.</p>
<p>The cousin said the Jimmy was two-toned, maroon and gray, but he had since painted</p>
<p>it and it was mostly silver now.</p>
<p>Police took some photos of the Jimmy and got the license plate number.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the end of the report.</p>
<p>So all that tells us is that Kenneth wasn&rsquo;t still driving a GMC Jimmy in August of 1984.</p>
<p>So the ties to the land were interesting.</p>
<p>The access to cars was interesting.</p>
<p>But they were still just more coincidences.</p>
<p>If Kenneth McKeown Jr. was at all tied to Darlene&rsquo;s murder, there was nothing concrete</p>
<p>to prove it.</p>
<p>But we still had questions about him.</p>
<p>So one cold November day, Emily and I went directly to the source to ask our burning</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>Hi, are you Kenneth?</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Emily and this is Ashley.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Emily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying some old cases over in Argonne.</p>
<p>Yeah, you all might as well just leave.</p>
<p>We would love to get your side of the story.</p>
<p>My side of the story is that David Yoglet is a crooked cop.</p>
<p>I gotta tell you guys, we weren&rsquo;t sure how this would go down when we knocked on his</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>We were fully expecting him not to be home or someone else to answer the door, but it</p>
<p>was him.</p>
<p>And despite telling us that we might as well leave, he talked to us for about 20 minutes</p>
<p>through his doorway, us on his porch, him standing inside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of counseling and stuff over the years.</p>
<p>This is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived a really good life since then.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad that somebody like, I don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s still a cop or not, can do that</p>
<p>to people to say stuff that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So are you saying?</p>
<p>With no proof of anything.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, I wouldn&rsquo;t know if there was proof or not, because I wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Kenneth was defensive from the get go.</p>
<p>Before we even said what case we were covering, I tried to clarify thinking maybe he was upset</p>
<p>that we were talking about Pam&rsquo;s case, which he&rsquo;d been tried for and served his time.</p>
<p>So are you talking about the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about another one.</p>
<p>Darlene Hulse?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Most of Kenneth&rsquo;s anger seems to lie with Dave Yocolet, still today.</p>
<p>He basically said he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate being a suspect in Darlene&rsquo;s case because nobody</p>
<p>has ever physically tied him to it.</p>
<p>To have this hanging over me, how would you feel if somebody said, oh, I think you might</p>
<p>You know, because you did stupid shit when you were young.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Dave, I got to be careful with him because he&rsquo;s a little bit loony.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy drug me out of a jail cell years ago and started accusing me of stuff</p>
<p>after I had already been prosecuted for that other deal.</p>
<p>And next thing I know, he&rsquo;s running for sheriff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to solve this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to solve that.</p>
<p>And he has no reason to even ask me any questions about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just none.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it had to do with the location.</p>
<p>Are you recording any of this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You should have told me.</p>
<p>That was the moment we thought he was going to slam the door in our faces.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that I have to deal with it now because I paid my debt to society.</p>
<p>And having something else come up that doesn&rsquo;t have a frickin, it just, it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>Me, of all people, knows better than anybody.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>Well, and if that&rsquo;s the case, I mean, it&rsquo;s, I, I agree that it&rsquo;s like the unfortunate</p>
<p>circumstance of just kind of how similar, how close in proximity.</p>
<p>Well, we were farmers.</p>
<p>I mean, we, we lived in that area.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole Culver, Argus, the whole area.</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s a huge farmer over there.</p>
<p>Uh, proximity?</p>
<p>Hell, I lived there my whole life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s proximity?</p>
<p>Do you know of anyone who would have been familiar with your uncle&rsquo;s farm?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to get to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re not trying to just go with whoever people are pointing the finger at.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with Darlene&rsquo;s daughters and we really want to find out who did this.</p>
<p>Not a clue.</p>
<p>Not a clue.</p>
<p>Other than my uncle and his, his hired hand.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Do you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put anybody else into this situation after all these years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, every time this comes up, I get, I get to spend the next few months just being bummed</p>
<p>out and stressed out and, and, uh, worrying about whether it&rsquo;s going to make my family</p>
<p>sad.</p>
<p>And, you know, I mean, I already did my time for what I did wrong.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you automatically did everything else wrong.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Would you talk to us just sitting down?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ve already, I&rsquo;ve already talked too much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for me to have to talk to anybody about something that has nothing to</p>
<p>do with me.</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you are saying you didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the Darlene Halstead case?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sad that I have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Well, and I hope that not much longer.</p>
<p>I mean, they have DNA now and I think-</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That is awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, they might actually solve it.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Kenneth went back to talking about Dave right after we brought up the DNA.</p>
<p>And he said that Dave has it out for him because he initially lied about breaking into Pam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>I felt terrible about what I did.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in the, the, I, you know, like I said, I got counseling and stuff after I came</p>
<p>home and, and, uh-</p>
<p>That case, why did you go to her house in the first place?</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you.</p>
<p>It was just like that, spur of like that morning, because you had been calling her, right?</p>
<p>And so you just picked her kind of out of-</p>
<p>Yeah, I kind of, we kind of knew, or I kind of knew them.</p>
<p>And, uh, obviously nothing happened other than being stupid enough to break into a house.</p>
<p>And, uh, it just, uh, an addictive personality got me caught up.</p>
<p>Kenneth seemed fine talking about what he did at Pam&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But anytime we steered him back to Darlene, he said not only did he not want to talk about</p>
<p>it, but he didn&rsquo;t even want to hear anything about what&rsquo;s going on with the case.</p>
<p>Do you, have you ever heard any other, like, ideas on who could have been involved with</p>
<p>the other-</p>
<p>No, and I don&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>
<p>And people keep trying to tell me things and I don&rsquo;t want to hear them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>Like who?</p>
<p>Just in general, listening to different things or having people call me and saying this stuff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on, been on a podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to know.</p>
<p>But right before we were about to leave, Kenneth did seem interested in the fact that we mentioned</p>
<p>there might be new DNA in the case.</p>
<p>What the hell takes so long with the DNA?</p>
<p>Which kind of crap&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I think new technology, they&rsquo;ve been able to get some new stuff.</p>
<p>So if they came, would you give them your DNA to just rule you out?</p>
<p>They have it.</p>
<p>They took it from me years ago.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t still have it and they needed a new sample, would you be cool with it?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not going to work with them at all.</p>
<p>They have my DNA.</p>
<p>I went in and into a hospital and all that stuff was taken off of me.</p>
<p>If they were dumb enough not to keep it and not to check it all those years ago, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I have no reason to even associate myself with any of that anymore.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>Just to eliminate yourself and then it would be over?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It makes me sick to my stomach to think about that I was capable of doing the stupid shit</p>
<p>I did when I was young, but it was, my life was different then.</p>
<p>Drugs, alcohol, stupidity, running around like an idiot.</p>
<p>I just wish they&rsquo;d catch whoever it is and be done with it, but I got my doubts after</p>
<p>all these fricking years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to keep blaming people.</p>
<p>You said you really hope they catch who did it.</p>
<p>Please, yes.</p>
<p>Did you ever meet Darlene?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why do you feel like that?</p>
<p>Because of this right here.</p>
<p>Why else?</p>
<p>How many people stopped showing up at your door?</p>
<p>Well, this is the first time somebody&rsquo;s ever showed up at my door.</p>
<p>There was one more question I had burning at the back of my brain, ever since Emily</p>
<p>interviewed Pam, and she said that after Kenneth was arrested, but before he was sentenced</p>
<p>in her case, he showed up at her house and her husband ran him off.</p>
<p>Kenneth&rsquo;s answer to my question surprised me.</p>
<p>So, she was wondering what you were going to say to her, why you came to her house.</p>
<p>When was that?</p>
<p>After.</p>
<p>I was going to apologize to her for being an idiot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry that that ever happened, I really am, and I would love to tell her</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I really would.</p>
<p>I would apologize tomorrow, if I could, but I don&rsquo;t want her to be afraid or offended</p>
<p>or, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, that I would even think about trying to approach anybody,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think that would be fair either, if you know what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I just, I&rsquo;ve screwed her life up, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure she lived on edge for all that time when that shit was going on.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m sad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Kenneth, so I don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;s being sincere or if the apology will</p>
<p>mean anything to Pam all these years later, knowing that it took a podcaster and a reporter</p>
<p>to go track it down.</p>
<p>When we left Kenneth&rsquo;s house, we didn&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing about everything he said is that you can view it any way you want.</p>
<p>If someone had a bias toward believing he was involved in Darlene&rsquo;s murder, then him</p>
<p>not wanting to give his DNA is suspicious.</p>
<p>But if he is presumed innocent, which is how our legal system is supposed to work, you</p>
<p>can understand his frustration.</p>
<p>They took every sample they ever needed, and in Kenneth&rsquo;s own words, if they were dumb</p>
<p>enough to not keep it and not check it all those years ago, that&rsquo;s on them.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>Something I didn&rsquo;t totally get is why he was so unwilling to even discuss Darlene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>Not just with us, but according to him, with anyone.</p>
<p>He said people would try and talk to him about it or tell him things, and he doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to hear them.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a specific part of the behavior profile that the FBI did for Darlene&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>That part of the post-offense behavior section reads, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He would probably have followed the progress of the investigation through the media and</p>
<p>by overhearing others in the community.</p>
<p>However, the offender would not be likely to engage in conversation about the crime.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Like everything else, that might just be a weird coincidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to point a finger at Kenneth.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t want you walking away from this episode or this series thinking he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guilty because there has been nothing to date to prove that he is.</p>
<p>There is only enough circumstantial evidence to warrant him being crossed off the list</p>
<p>through DNA testing, which I don&rsquo;t think is a huge ask.</p>
<p>I could tell Kenneth was scared about what we might say.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t even take Emily&rsquo;s card.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t want to know our names or anything else.</p>
<p>I think he just wanted us and this to go away.</p>
<p>Not for his sake, he said, but for his family&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But, you know, just remember one thing, if you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To drag me through a media thing, and it&rsquo;s not me that you&rsquo;re hurting anymore.</p>
<p>I hurt myself years ago, and it&rsquo;s going to be my family, my wife, that&rsquo;s stuck with me</p>
<p>through all this.</p>
<p>And every time it comes up, it tears open wounds, you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a practicing Catholic for years, and I was fire chief here for 11 years.</p>
<p>This community&rsquo;s accepted me for who I am.</p>
<p>And I worked for the state of Indiana for 27 years, you know, I mean, if I was the one</p>
<p>that was the problem, my DNA would have caught me a long time ago, because they have it.</p>
<p>They do have it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nelson has confirmed they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a shame, because I agree, that DNA should have been kept and tested a long-ass</p>
<p>time ago.</p>
<p>If it was, and it didn&rsquo;t match Kenneth McCune Jr., I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about</p>
<p>him today.</p>
<p>But I am.</p>
<p>Not to ruin this guy&rsquo;s life, but for Darlene.</p>
<p>For Marie and Melissa and Kristen.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nelson seemed as worried as Kenneth about us naming people in our podcast, even</p>
<p>if we were abundantly clear that they have not been charged with anything in relation</p>
<p>to Darlene&rsquo;s homicide.</p>
<p>Nelson kept referencing another case in his county, where a man who&rsquo;d done nothing wrong</p>
<p>was dragged through the mud, and it did ruin his life.</p>
<p>But there was a big difference between that guy and some of the people that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about on this show, including Kenneth.</p>
<p>And I pointed that out to Nelson in one of our meetings when he brought it up again.</p>
<p>The people that we&rsquo;re talking about, every one of them is on our list because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done something heinous in their past.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s different ethically to talk about them?</p>
<p>Because again, you didn&rsquo;t just walk on the wrong street, you tried to rape a woman.</p>
<p>Nelson didn&rsquo;t have much to say to that.</p>
<p>Listen, I hope Kenneth is telling the truth, for his sake and his family&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I hope that he served his time, got counseling, was rehabilitated, and went on to be a good</p>
<p>husband, father, and grandfather who gave back to his community.</p>
<p>But even if that is true, it doesn&rsquo;t erase what happened to Pam.</p>
<p>That will always be there, because unfortunately, there are some choices, even ones made when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re young and dumb, as Kenneth would say, that can&rsquo;t be erased.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s Pam&rsquo;s case that keeps uncovering coincidence after coincidence in Darlene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder, even still.</p>
<p>You see, two weeks after we knocked on Kenneth&rsquo;s door, some more records from Pam&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>came in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d requested dozens of different documents from when Kenneth was tried for the indecent</p>
<p>exposure and for Pam&rsquo;s attack, including witness lists, dockets, testimony, transcripts,</p>
<p>letters, and exhibits.</p>
<p>It was actually a request we placed pretty early on in our reporting, but sometimes things</p>
<p>are slow.</p>
<p>When we finally got it all, it was hundreds of pages of stuff that took forever to go</p>
<p>through.</p>
<p>Emily thumbed through them first, and there was a lot of the same stuff we already knew.</p>
<p>But deep in the exhibits was a gem.</p>
<p>Emily ran to my office and slapped a few pages of paper against the glass door.</p>
<p>It was a medical report.</p>
<p>If you remember from last episode, when Pam&rsquo;s attacker fled, he cut his hand on the way</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Well, once they had a name for Pam&rsquo;s attacker, authorities requested Kenneth&rsquo;s medical records.</p>
<p>They showed that he went to the doctor after Pam&rsquo;s attack and got treatment, but lied</p>
<p>about how he&rsquo;d been injured.</p>
<p>December 28, 1982.</p>
<p>Patient lacerated palm of left hand, getting caught between a metal object and a cow&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hoof.</p>
<p>He is able to move all fingers and does not notice any numbness in the fingers.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t feel as if he has a broken bone.</p>
<p>Laceration 2.5 inches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this was going to be used as an exhibit if Pam&rsquo;s case would have gone</p>
<p>to trial.</p>
<p>After Kenneth took a plea, they didn&rsquo;t need to use them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not that part of the report that was jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what came next.</p>
<p>The medical reports continued into 1984, and there are detailed reports about Kenneth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doctor visits right before and right after Darlene Hulse&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>The first one we found interesting was from roughly two months before the murder.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for the visit was super mundane, I don&rsquo;t want to discuss health information</p>
<p>not relevant to the case, but there was one line that caused Emily to run to my office.</p>
<p>June 11, 1984.</p>
<p>Patient is here, mainly related to stress.</p>
<p>Also having some breathing difficulty and doesn&rsquo;t feel well when he spray paints cars,</p>
<p>which is a new line of business for him.</p>
<p>Emily and I audibly gasped when we read this.</p>
<p>Kenneth was in the business of spray painting cars the summer of Darlene&rsquo;s murder?</p>
<p>We hadn&rsquo;t seen this information mentioned anywhere else, so we&rsquo;re unsure if law enforcement</p>
<p>even knows, or if they know what we found next.</p>
<p>There was another visit in the files from five weeks after Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>September 22, 1984.</p>
<p>Feeling very nervous, under a great deal of stress at times, working 18-hour days.</p>
<p>Normal exam, tender left upper quadrant, probable stress overwork.</p>
<p>Rapid change in lifestyle.</p>
<p>From the medical records included in the court exhibit that spanned from June 1975 to March</p>
<p>1988, there wasn&rsquo;t a single other instance of Kenneth McKeown Jr. visiting his doctor</p>
<p>for nervousness.</p>
<p>So one might wonder what was going on in Kenneth&rsquo;s life back in September 1984 for him to be</p>
<p>feeling very nervous, so nervous that he went to the doctor.</p>
<p>In a psych eval that was also part of our records request, a doctor wrote that when</p>
<p>Kenneth committed crimes, it was when his wife was pregnant.</p>
<p>They wrote, quote,</p>
<p>In 1982, he got in trouble allegedly for indecent exposure.</p>
<p>He and his wife were having their ups and downs.</p>
<p>His wife was pregnant with their second child, and Kenny and his wife were not sexually appealing</p>
<p>to each other at that time.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Well, you want to know what&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>Kenneth&rsquo;s wife was pregnant again in August of 1984.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll recall the FBI profile again, they theorized, quote,</p>
<p>The brutality of the crime scene reflects anger resulting from short- or long-term stressors</p>
<p>in the offender&rsquo;s life experiences.</p>
<p>Our research and experiences reflect that these participating stressors can be the result</p>
<p>of conflict with a significant female in the offender&rsquo;s life, employment pressures, death</p>
<p>of a significant person, etc.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Emily got a hold of employment records from the Culver School District, and those showed</p>
<p>that Kenneth resigned as a bus driver on June 28, 1984, just weeks before Darlene was murdered.</p>
<p>This could mean nothing, but it also could show that around the time of Darlene&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>there were some big changes happening in Kenneth&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>To quote Nelson,</p>
<p>Man, there are a lot of coincidences.</p>
<p>But then, there are also a lot of coincidences when you take a look at another crime committed</p>
<p>by someone else just months before Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So John Paul Clark is the first time this name&rsquo;s been brought up?</p>
<p>I mean, where did you get that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s next in episode 11, Bad Seed.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
