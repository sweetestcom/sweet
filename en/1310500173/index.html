    <p>The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,</p>
<p>his second time in the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most innovative scholars</p>
<p>of martial arts in the modern era.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>Indeed hiring website, Audible audio books,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN and Element electrolyte drink.</p>
<p>Click the sponsor links to get a discount</p>
<p>and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to train with Ryan recently and to both discuss</p>
<p>and try out on the mat his ideas about grappling and fighting.</p>
<p>What struck me is his unapologetic drive</p>
<p>to solve martial arts.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the ambitious vision and effort</p>
<p>of Google&rsquo;s DeepMind to solve intelligence.</p>
<p>In Ryan&rsquo;s case, this isn&rsquo;t some out there</p>
<p>martial arts guru talk.</p>
<p>This is a style of thinking about the game of human chess,</p>
<p>of seeking to define the rules and to engineer ways</p>
<p>from first principles of escaping the constraints</p>
<p>of those rules.</p>
<p>This style of thinking is rare,</p>
<p>but is ultimately the one that leads to the discovery</p>
<p>of new revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe to it anywhere</p>
<p>or connect with me at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ryan Hall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re known as a systems thinker in martial arts,</p>
<p>but you also, I think, are willing to think</p>
<p>outside the rules of the game, outside of the system.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking about strategies</p>
<p>of how to solve the particular problem of an opponent,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s jiu jitsu or in mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your process for doing that,</p>
<p>for figuring out that puzzle?</p>
<p>I would say, I don&rsquo;t know if I have a specific</p>
<p>like A to B to C process for that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I try to do my best to appreciate that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the thinking,</p>
<p>or maybe not all the thinking,</p>
<p>but a lot of great thinking on conflict,</p>
<p>on battle, on war, on martial arts has been done already.</p>
<p>Not that we don&rsquo;t have to do any sort of</p>
<p>background investigation or reassessing of these ideas</p>
<p>or axioms that have come down through things</p>
<p>like the book of five rings or the art of war,</p>
<p>or like von Clausewitz, even anything like that really,</p>
<p>but is trying to understand the lessons of the past</p>
<p>that I think oftentimes we don&rsquo;t take with us problem solving.</p>
<p>We pay lip service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, a victorious fighter, the great fighter,</p>
<p>you know, he knows victory is there,</p>
<p>then he seeks battle.</p>
<p>Everyone else is looking for victory in battle.</p>
<p>Yeah, moving on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m gonna double jab and throw my left hand.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of times our actions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t reflect our stated belief structure.</p>
<p>And I think that oftentimes you can tell</p>
<p>what I believe really,</p>
<p>or what my fundamental operating system is</p>
<p>based on my actions, whether I&rsquo;m aware,</p>
<p>I have an operating system internally,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m aware of it or not,</p>
<p>or certainly whether I&rsquo;m fully aware of it.</p>
<p>So I guess when it comes to strategy,</p>
<p>I try to think about how things interact.</p>
<p>You mentioned systems thinking,</p>
<p>and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist,</p>
<p>but I think that systems have a fundamental strength</p>
<p>and a fundamental weakness.</p>
<p>They work how they work, and that&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re readable.</p>
<p>So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system</p>
<p>of which you&rsquo;re not really read into,</p>
<p>then I think oftentimes I can seem shockingly effective,</p>
<p>particularly if my system preys on certain weaknesses</p>
<p>that maybe you&rsquo;re given to.</p>
<p>But what happens when you&rsquo;ve read the same books that I have?</p>
<p>I think that a lot of times</p>
<p>that makes me deeply predictable.</p>
<p>I think about systems in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>and a lot of times people think that they&rsquo;re doing jiu jitsu</p>
<p>when in reality they are doing an expression of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ll use, there&rsquo;s the Marcelo Garcia system.</p>
<p>There is the current Henzo Gracie system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the old Gracie Baja one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Gracie Academy, classic Gracie jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the art of jiu jitsu, kind of autos approach.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some crossover between a lot of these,</p>
<p>but oftentimes I think when it comes to understanding</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m making decisions</p>
<p>and how my opponent is making decisions,</p>
<p>I have to appreciate whether or not I&rsquo;m an end user</p>
<p>of something, and I&rsquo;ll use my phone as an example.</p>
<p>I was thinking of this the other day,</p>
<p>and as an end user of my phone, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I have no idea what it does.</p>
<p>Like Edward Snowden comes up and goes,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey guys, you realize your phones are listening to you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;&lsquo;Really, what?</p>
<p>All right, I believe you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then of course that comes out,</p>
<p>but to what extent?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>What is my phone capable of?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I can mess with the font though.</p>
<p>I really like blue screens, not purple screens.</p>
<p>So as an end user, I can change some of the bells</p>
<p>and whistles that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with the underlying source code of it all</p>
<p>or how it functions.</p>
<p>The same way in my car, I&rsquo;m an end user of my car.</p>
<p>If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes.</p>
<p>If I push on the gas, it goes.</p>
<p>I know how to fix it when it&rsquo;s out of gas.</p>
<p>I know how to fix it when it&rsquo;s out of oil.</p>
<p>And I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes.</p>
<p>But short of that, or actually beyond that, I have nothing.</p>
<p>So I think that oftentimes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around in jiu jitsu long enough</p>
<p>to encounter a new wave of good grapplers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very interesting sometimes</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re running systems</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re running.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>I trained at Marcelo Garcia&rsquo;s Academy for a long time.</p>
<p>And a big fan of Marcelo&rsquo;s was a student there.</p>
<p>Encountered a lot of the auto style jiu jitsu</p>
<p>a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Been very, very deep into foot locking and leg attacks</p>
<p>and whatnot for a long, long time.</p>
<p>I understand your system better than you do, or I may.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you understand my system better than I do.</p>
<p>That would be a huge issue.</p>
<p>That was something that I encountered a long time ago,</p>
<p>trying to come up in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>where I was trying to utilize systems</p>
<p>that were created by, let&rsquo;s say Hoffa Mendez</p>
<p>or someone else.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m basically trying to do what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not doing as good of a version of it.</p>
<p>So not only am I not doing it well,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m entirely predictable.</p>
<p>And I think that that can be a big issue.</p>
<p>So to come back, I think of systems a lot of times now</p>
<p>in terms of, particularly like end user type of systems,</p>
<p>like an iPhone is a really, really fast way</p>
<p>for me to be able to do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>If you were to take it from me,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t recreate any of that.</p>
<p>So you want to be more the NSA and less the end user.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>That way I&rsquo;m listening to you.</p>
<p>You want to be the NSA of combat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re watching UP.</p>
<p>But basically, I guess what I would come back and say</p>
<p>is if you understand how things interact</p>
<p>on a fundamental level and what type of games exist</p>
<p>and what type of interactions exist,</p>
<p>then you can transcend a lot of the systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a cook versus if I can make certain things</p>
<p>in the kitchen, but I am not a chef.</p>
<p>You could give me a bunch of ingredients</p>
<p>and I could probably cook not well,</p>
<p>but a couple of different things.</p>
<p>But a master chef would be aware of the implications</p>
<p>of all of the things that they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>extra time in the oven, less time in the oven,</p>
<p>putting this flavoring or spice in,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing with various things.</p>
<p>And also they could turn all of these ingredients</p>
<p>into Chinese food.</p>
<p>They could turn all these ingredients into Italian food</p>
<p>and they could turn all these Italian food ingredients</p>
<p>into chicken Parmesan or it could turn into lasagna.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not limited to a specific thing</p>
<p>because they have knowledge of how food interacts,</p>
<p>what it does to create taste,</p>
<p>what it does to create texture.</p>
<p>So to come back, let&rsquo;s take rock, paper, scissors.</p>
<p>Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea</p>
<p>of a couple of different things.</p>
<p>Or actually, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,</p>
<p>can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite dinosaur?</p>
<p>On the same, on three, we&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>T. Rex.</p>
<p>So me too, man, we&rsquo;re gonna be best friends.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, okay, so what&rsquo;s the first question</p>
<p>when you say, hey, let&rsquo;s play rock, paper, scissors?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, is it rock, paper, scissors</p>
<p>or rock, paper, scissors, shoot?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>Because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, oh man, I got lucky and I won.</p>
<p>Imagine I won 100 times in a row.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be luck, it&rsquo;d be luck if I was honestly doing that.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s say, for instance,</p>
<p>I go on rock, paper, scissors and you go on shoot.</p>
<p>Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.</p>
<p>Here comes the rock, right?</p>
<p>If you lose, whose fault is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>This is built on a parody thing</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t get to pick second.</p>
<p>If I get to pick second,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being able to investigate your background</p>
<p>before going to meet you.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, oh, hi.</p>
<p>Oh, I too love the New Jersey, you know,</p>
<p>the New Jersey Nets, which is a statement</p>
<p>that no one in their right mind would ever make</p>
<p>when I was growing up.</p>
<p>So anyway, you&rsquo;d have to have personal knowledge</p>
<p>of somebody.</p>
<p>So anyway, to come back,</p>
<p>if you understand how games are structured,</p>
<p>you can start to realize that there&rsquo;s huge gaps</p>
<p>and huge holes in a lot of the thinking behind all of it.</p>
<p>And if you can create the illusion of choice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play one more if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite ones.</p>
<p>I do this in class all the time.</p>
<p>Have you seen this before?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, may I ask you some questions please?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay, fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s, everybody wins.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So could you please?</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p>Could you please pick three fingers</p>
<p>and tell me what they are?</p>
<p>Your thumb.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Your pinky.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And your middle finger.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So could you please pick two fingers?</p>
<p>Your middle finger and your pinky.</p>
<p>Okay, could you please pick one finger?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go with the middle finger.</p>
<p>Woo hoo.</p>
<p>Okay, could you please pick one finger?</p>
<p>Pinky.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s play again.</p>
<p>Can you pick one finger, please?</p>
<p>Your middle finger.</p>
<p>Okay, can you pick one finger, please?</p>
<p>Your thumb.</p>
<p>Yeah, your pinky.</p>
<p>Okay, now pick two more fingers, please.</p>
<p>Your middle finger and your ring finger.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Could you please pick one more finger?</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I thought that enhanced the illusion of choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the illusion of choice.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m asking the questions,</p>
<p>provided I ask the right questions,</p>
<p>there can be no correct answer.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that, I mean, ultimately,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you wanted, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>like I thought I was guiding you to something I wanted,</p>
<p>it turns out that was the outcome you wanted.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna ask the wrong questions.</p>
<p>I might not get what I wanted, so.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>For people that might be just listening to this,</p>
<p>that no matter what trajectory we took</p>
<p>through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,</p>
<p>it was always ending up with a middle finger,</p>
<p>ironically enough.</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>So, and.</p>
<p>All of us were surprised, and we&rsquo;re both winners.</p>
<p>Yeah, we all, everyone was.</p>
<p>I felt like a winner.</p>
<p>All right, so now I&rsquo;m gonna,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ll ask some different questions, if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>Can you please pick two fingers to put down?</p>
<p>Your middle finger and your pinky.</p>
<p>All right, sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so awkward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the worst finger positions.</p>
<p>Okay, can you please pick, wait a minute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, oh, hold on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what if you picked two other fingers to put down?</p>
<p>Your thumb and your pinky.</p>
<p>Okay, my thumb and my pinky.</p>
<p>Can you please pick two fingers to put down?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Whatever two you like.</p>
<p>Okay, your middle finger and your pointy finger.</p>
<p>Ah, okay, can you pick two fingers to put down?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s index finger.</p>
<p>Index finger.</p>
<p>Why did I call it the pointy finger?</p>
<p>Pointy, it&rsquo;s the pointy one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one we usually point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to point with the ring finger.</p>
<p>Sorry, what?</p>
<p>Two more to put down, please.</p>
<p>The middle finger and the ring finger.</p>
<p>Ah, man.</p>
<p>What if you pick my ring finger and my index finger?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Aha, woohoo, I win.</p>
<p>So even though I&rsquo;m asking the questions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not impossible that I arrive at a good outcome for me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s no longer guaranteed.</p>
<p>I went from a situation where I literally can&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty low probability.</p>
<p>Right, super low probability.</p>
<p>And the second you realize what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>you would never let me win</p>
<p>because the ball&rsquo;s truly in your court.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m fundamentally trying</p>
<p>to put into play almost all the time.</p>
<p>Can I ask the right set of questions?</p>
<p>Can I develop the ability skills wise, understanding wise,</p>
<p>and then discipline wise,</p>
<p>and then have the courage and the constitution</p>
<p>and the discipline necessary,</p>
<p>the patience necessary to ask the proper questions</p>
<p>and wait for the proper answers?</p>
<p>And if I can,</p>
<p>assuming the perfect world, I win, period.</p>
<p>Yeah, so does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, that totally makes sense.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>sort of the more mathematical discipline of game theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called mechanism design.</p>
<p>So game theory is this field where you model</p>
<p>some kind of interaction between human beings.</p>
<p>You could model grappling that way.</p>
<p>You can model nuclear conflict between nations that way.</p>
<p>And you set up a set of rules and incentives</p>
<p>and then use math to predict</p>
<p>what is likely outcome depending over time</p>
<p>based on the interaction given those rules.</p>
<p>Mechanism design is the design of games.</p>
<p>So like the design of systems</p>
<p>that are likely to lead to a certain outcome.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re suggesting is</p>
<p>you want to discover systems whose decision tree,</p>
<p>all the possible things that could happen,</p>
<p>feel like there&rsquo;s choice being made,</p>
<p>but ultimately one of the parties</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any choice</p>
<p>in what the actual final outcome is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making them feel like they&rsquo;re playing a game too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you don&rsquo;t feel trapped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like.</p>
<p>Well, the best traps, you don&rsquo;t look very threatening.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;ll walk over there.</p>
<p>I guess wouldn&rsquo;t that,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s kind of an interesting thing.</p>
<p>If a lion, when does a lion roar?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing when you watch like lions hunting.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t roar when they hunt.</p>
<p>They want to, when they want to move you back,</p>
<p>they do stuff like that.</p>
<p>When they actually want to come and get you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty slinky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like water covered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like furry water.</p>
<p>And I guess like when you keep that in mind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny how, like for us a hobby actually,</p>
<p>a brilliant guy, like one of my MMA coaches</p>
<p>and the head coach at TriStar,</p>
<p>he brought this up one time.</p>
<p>I thought it was a really salient point.</p>
<p>Said, let&rsquo;s say we have a million person bracket.</p>
<p>Impossibly huge.</p>
<p>Like Frank Dukes went in the Kumite level huge bracket.</p>
<p>He claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, that is all of Hong Kong</p>
<p>was in that thing.</p>
<p>And everyone kept their mouth shut.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>But to come back a little improbable, pretty cool.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say for instance, like there&rsquo;s no cheating going on,</p>
<p>no cheating going on and we&rsquo;re flipping coins, right?</p>
<p>Someone is gonna have an unbroken string of victory</p>
<p>through that bracket, which is pretty insane.</p>
<p>How many consecutive like toss ups this person won.</p>
<p>And then at the end of it all,</p>
<p>imagine like aliens show up and we go,</p>
<p>hey, they wanna flip a coin for whether or not Earth,</p>
<p>whether or not Earth gets to continue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, oh, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at this.</p>
<p>That would be tempting as a person to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m a lucky guy.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are.</p>
<p>We could argue that effectively you&rsquo;re incredibly lucky.</p>
<p>But basically is that an actual ability?</p>
<p>Is that like a perk in a video game</p>
<p>or is that just this thing that happened?</p>
<p>So anyway, how many times are someone,</p>
<p>you could go through an entire career,</p>
<p>particularly in a fight sport.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you get 15 knockouts</p>
<p>and 15 toss up scenarios.</p>
<p>Cause you see that happening all the time</p>
<p>in the fight game, a toss up scenario.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re mounted on me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a toss up scenario.</p>
<p>Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios.</p>
<p>A lot of grappling ones,</p>
<p>but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups.</p>
<p>And somebody wins by knockout.</p>
<p>They win five times in a row.</p>
<p>Then they lose a couple of times in a row.</p>
<p>We go, what happened?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, what do you mean what happened?</p>
<p>They were always flipping the coin.</p>
<p>And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re flipping a coin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like heads, heads, heads, heads, tails.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Tails, tails, heads again.</p>
<p>Oh man, I&rsquo;m back on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m flipping good now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I think the vast majority of the time</p>
<p>and then humanity&rsquo;s tendency to see a sign</p>
<p>in almost anything, it starts to present itself.</p>
<p>And then we build a narrative in our mind</p>
<p>to convince ourselves that we&rsquo;re in some sort of control.</p>
<p>When in reality, I was in a marginal situation</p>
<p>at best the whole time.</p>
<p>Yeah, without having much control,</p>
<p>without having a deep understanding of the system.</p>
<p>The same story is told in the stock market.</p>
<p>With many of these distributed human systems,</p>
<p>we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns</p>
<p>without understanding actually the system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generating these patterns.</p>
<p>So if we can see the system, that&rsquo;s incredibly valuable,</p>
<p>but then you go, well,</p>
<p>what system is above all of the systems?</p>
<p>And I guess maybe physics, maybe something like game theory</p>
<p>explains these things with like, I guess what are the,</p>
<p>what aspects of the system can I put my hands on</p>
<p>that I can touch and understand?</p>
<p>And what am I missing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in the world all around me</p>
<p>to continue to lean on Dune that I don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>you talk to a blind person about the world,</p>
<p>about the site and talk to someone that doesn&rsquo;t have everyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, this is delicious, like, is it?</p>
<p>So anyway, you know, again, what senses am I missing</p>
<p>or what understanding am I missing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s preventing me from seeing the dots connect</p>
<p>in the world all around me?</p>
<p>And I think sometimes if we are oftentimes</p>
<p>at least personally, I&rsquo;ve screwed this up a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so nose deep in the trench of trying to understand</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing that I can&rsquo;t take a step back</p>
<p>and realize, you know, that I&rsquo;m in a forest,</p>
<p>not just headbutting a tree.</p>
<p>And I may be doing both, maybe both,</p>
<p>two things should be true at once.</p>
<p>But so I would say when it comes to strategy,</p>
<p>trying to understand that, but then also you go,</p>
<p>well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool,</p>
<p>but how can you actually do that?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say, that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>because if I imagine I say, man,</p>
<p>I should fight like Steven Thompson,</p>
<p>I should fight like Wonderboy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, good idea, go do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, not the guy.</p>
<p>I would fight like Khabib Nurmagomedov if I could.</p>
<p>You know, it seems to work.</p>
<p>So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop,</p>
<p>what if I could take my time developing skills</p>
<p>so that when these strategies become apparent,</p>
<p>they are executable to you.</p>
<p>You actually have the ability to like,</p>
<p>in or to again, to be the person in the arena,</p>
<p>to be the person required,</p>
<p>whereas there&rsquo;s plenty of great ideas</p>
<p>like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea.</p>
<p>Alas, for me, unless there&rsquo;s a small trampoline nearby,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the guy.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less good of an idea.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t developed the ability or I lack the ability.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think a lot of times,</p>
<p>at least when I watch people in fighting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use an example.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so concerned with trying to win early on</p>
<p>rather than develop skills that I&rsquo;m going like,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the best way to fight</p>
<p>with my current set of skills?</p>
<p>And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route,</p>
<p>like you put on the one ring,</p>
<p>take the damage you need to take to hit that guy.</p>
<p>And that was something I realized very early on</p>
<p>in my MMA career was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that good at striking at that time,</p>
<p>not a world class striker now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m way better at striking</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m given any credit for</p>
<p>because it helps people sleep at night, I think.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you&rsquo;re always introduced</p>
<p>as like this master grappler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s nice of them to say that.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not that good at grappling.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even seen that.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>just because people almost go like,</p>
<p>well, Lex, see, you&rsquo;re really good at this,</p>
<p>but you gotta understand, we&rsquo;re equal, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at this other thing.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re really good at what you do</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just mediocre at what I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also possible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s plenty of people that define themselves</p>
<p>as a striker that do that</p>
<p>just because that&rsquo;s for lack of other options.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re really good striker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a grappler.</p>
<p>I was a grappler as a blue belt.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess to come back,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m constantly going,</p>
<p>how can I win with what I&rsquo;ve got right now?</p>
<p>I think oftentimes I never take the time</p>
<p>to develop the skills that I wanna develop</p>
<p>and I also never take the time</p>
<p>to develop the strategies that I wanna develop.</p>
<p>And that has actually been a one big blessing</p>
<p>of fighting someone frequently,</p>
<p>which has been really frustrating</p>
<p>as a result of injuries and time away</p>
<p>and some of those people being hesitant to get in the game.</p>
<p>But it gives you so much time to be out of the trenches</p>
<p>and focus on developing your abilities</p>
<p>so that now it&rsquo;s almost like developing money</p>
<p>like you mentioned the stock market</p>
<p>that you can now put in.</p>
<p>Imagine you told me Bitcoin was a great idea five years ago</p>
<p>and I had eight bucks.</p>
<p>Man, if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea</p>
<p>five years ago and I had 50K,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, oh my God, I&rsquo;d be sleeping in my bed of money</p>
<p>that I would then set on fire later</p>
<p>so they had just to do it.</p>
<p>So due to all the injuries,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been mining Bitcoin all this time</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re a rich man.</p>
<p>Well, no, actually someone told me</p>
<p>I was trying to mine for Bitcoin,</p>
<p>actually like in a cave.</p>
<p>And then I found out recently that it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>mining is like a figure of speech.</p>
<p>You misunderstood. Not like a literal thing that you do.</p>
<p>But I mean, in my defense, I only know what I know.</p>
<p>English language is difficult.</p>
<p>It is, it really is.</p>
<p>Next time talk to me, I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<p>Russian is more, is a rich language.</p>
<p>You should learn, you should learn Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>
<p>I believe you, thank you.</p>
<p>Can you do a whirlwind overview of your career</p>
<p>in MMA leading up to this point</p>
<p>with the injuries and the undefeated record?</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s next since we&rsquo;re on the topic?</p>
<p>I did my first fight as a blue belt</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been training for about a year and a half.</p>
<p>I did nine Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends</p>
<p>or maybe eight Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends</p>
<p>prior to my first fight in April 2006.</p>
<p>I got punched in the face a whole bunch.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it was a professional fight</p>
<p>and found that out like the day beforehand.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>Thanks, coach.</p>
<p>It was in Atlantic City where another place</p>
<p>no one ever goes on purpose.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>I got into three, actually three car accidents</p>
<p>in the preceding 36 hours before the fight.</p>
<p>I had my car totaled.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t driving for any of them.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>It was 2006?</p>
<p>It was 2006, yeah.</p>
<p>You were a blue belt?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been training for about a year and a half.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a blue belt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting, I mean, if you haven&rsquo;t lived,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t gotten punched in the face in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, I would have loved to have it happen</p>
<p>for different reasons.</p>
<p>But yeah, well, what&rsquo;s funny is I remember</p>
<p>getting punched in the face a bunch,</p>
<p>trying to do inverted guard.</p>
<p>I won one round, lost two rounds,</p>
<p>definitely lost the fight.</p>
<p>So you went for inverted, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>You went for inverted guard.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of that fight real quick?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>It was three three minute rounds,</p>
<p>which is not a professional fight length,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t know if professional fight length</p>
<p>would have been any better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more time to get punched.</p>
<p>But I found out partway through,</p>
<p>I was like, I remember walking back to my corner</p>
<p>in the first round, I&rsquo;m like, yeah, this guy can&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, my corner was my friend, Tom,</p>
<p>and then someone else.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I would still encourage you</p>
<p>to stop blocking so many punches with your face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s a good idea, Tom, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I remember I was not allowed to up kick.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, great.</p>
<p>I had no martial arts skills, really at all.</p>
<p>But if I had anything at all, it was jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>It was very, very little jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>But definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking.</p>
<p>I was basically a magnet for punches.</p>
<p>So that was your time, roughnecking out in Atlantic City</p>
<p>as we all do once in a while.</p>
<p>Can we fast forward to when you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>dominating the world as a black belt?</p>
<p>Well, actually, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because I took a little bit of money that they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re paying you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Bukowski stories with Ryan Hall.</p>
<p>Well, then I went to the casino.</p>
<p>I went to whatever, like the Tropicana</p>
<p>that was right there, the casino,</p>
<p>because that was a boardwalk hall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know what, man?</p>
<p>This has been a not great evening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna win it back.</p>
<p>This will be great.</p>
<p>15 minutes later, they had all the money</p>
<p>that I had from the fight was gone.</p>
<p>I just remember walking out of the casino super pissed.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at gambling.</p>
<p>This was not gonna make my night better.</p>
<p>I just thought that there was gonna be</p>
<p>some sort of cosmic balancing,</p>
<p>and maybe it was the cosmic balancing all at once</p>
<p>for things I&rsquo;d done in the past.</p>
<p>Longer term, though, the balancing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all dead in the end, though.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Time will get us all, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so that was the first one,</p>
<p>and that was when I realized I&rsquo;m terrible at MMA,</p>
<p>but I like it.</p>
<p>I should just stop this until I one day</p>
<p>learn how to actually grapple,</p>
<p>much less learn how to fight.</p>
<p>But I remember there was this guy named Dave Kaplan,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the reason my ears are all messed up,</p>
<p>who was on the Ultimate Fighter and got punched in the face</p>
<p>and knocked out by Tom Lawler,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ll always appreciate for doing that.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>Dave or Tom?</p>
<p>I appreciate Tom.</p>
<p>I appreciate Dave, too.</p>
<p>Dave was great.</p>
<p>Dave was just a huge bully,</p>
<p>and used to, not completely unmercifully,</p>
<p>but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of me.</p>
<p>And anyway.</p>
<p>Well, the ears look good, so.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I tell people it&rsquo;s a tumor that I got,</p>
<p>and if they want in on a class action lawsuit with AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>they should send me an email.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re very financially savvy.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>No, I just give the impression.</p>
<p>Dave basically said, hey, don&rsquo;t worry, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna be good at MMA.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never gonna be good at grappling, either,</p>
<p>but even if you are good at grappling,</p>
<p>which, in my opinion, you will never be,</p>
<p>you will never be good at fighting.</p>
<p>And I said, Dave, if I do nothing else in my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep training until I can make you pay for that.</p>
<p>And now that I can make him pay for that really easily,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t train anymore.</p>
<p>But I love Dave.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>He actually won the singing beat.</p>
<p>What an interesting dude.</p>
<p>Super interesting guy.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>Virginia, like, speaks a couple languages.</p>
<p>Super interesting guy.</p>
<p>Like, shockingly good at Jeopardy, too.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m any good, but still shockingly good at Jeopardy.</p>
<p>So anyway, years later, met Faraz Zahabi.</p>
<p>Actually, John Danaher, I met John Danaher,</p>
<p>and he put me in touch with Faraz Zahabi.</p>
<p>I started training at TriStar.</p>
<p>I immediately loved working with Faraz</p>
<p>and learning under Faraz.</p>
<p>Started training at TriStar.</p>
<p>And I did my first real professional MMA fight</p>
<p>as someone that actually does,</p>
<p>had practiced a little bit prior in, I think, August, 2012.</p>
<p>And that was against a guy, he was four and five at the time.</p>
<p>So, you know, had some experience,</p>
<p>good kind of like first go for me, honestly.</p>
<p>And I won that fight by TKO.</p>
<p>And then it was a little bit of a time off.</p>
<p>And then I did another fight against a tough guy</p>
<p>named Magid Hamo.</p>
<p>He was five and two at the time.</p>
<p>I think he was three and I was amateur.</p>
<p>So, you know, a good little bit of fighting experience.</p>
<p>Won that one in the first round of Iron Rear Naked Choke.</p>
<p>And then started to experience difficulty</p>
<p>getting fights at that point.</p>
<p>You know, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Were you continuously introduced</p>
<p>as like the master of grappling, the submission?</p>
<p>At least that was my thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that was the source of the fear for people?</p>
<p>I think so, because, I mean,</p>
<p>I definitely wasn&rsquo;t much at striking at that point.</p>
<p>You know, I definitely am a lot,</p>
<p>I like to think I&rsquo;m pretty hard to hurt,</p>
<p>although I try not to lean on that.</p>
<p>And I played baseball for like 16 years,</p>
<p>so I can hit things pretty hard.</p>
<p>I just wasn&rsquo;t able to, I recognized pretty early on</p>
<p>that I had no idea how to actually hit things hard</p>
<p>without becoming hitable myself.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s kind of the big thing is a lot of times,</p>
<p>like we almost were mentioning before,</p>
<p>if you try to go and get people too early,</p>
<p>you can hit them if they&rsquo;re not that good,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to get hit yourself.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re making, you&rsquo;re basically making a wager.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making a trade of your own life</p>
<p>for the ability to hit them.</p>
<p>When you watch guys like Israel Adesanya,</p>
<p>Floyd Mayweather, Steven Thompson,</p>
<p>Conor McGregor, when he&rsquo;s fighting really well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a trade.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re hitting them and they&rsquo;re hitting you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re hitting you,</p>
<p>but it takes years and years and years and years</p>
<p>to be able to learn how to do that.</p>
<p>Ton Lee is another great example of that.</p>
<p>You know, my closest training partner,</p>
<p>one of my best friends,</p>
<p>and currently now one champion,</p>
<p>one championship in Asia,</p>
<p>the champion of the featherweight,</p>
<p>or I guess lightweight featherweight, 155 over there now.</p>
<p>And he recently defeated Martin Wynn</p>
<p>in a really great fight.</p>
<p>And Ton knocked him out, long time champion.</p>
<p>And Ton doesn&rsquo;t let you hit him.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t let you touch him.</p>
<p>I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Steven and Ton</p>
<p>to go early on in career and go, holy moly,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even, it&rsquo;s not even like,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;ll let me walk over and find you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up</p>
<p>with a hammer and smokes you in the melon</p>
<p>and then disappears into the ether again.</p>
<p>So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking,</p>
<p>how can I attack without being hit?</p>
<p>So every strategy, every idea you have</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>has to do with like that minimizing the returns.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what all good fighting is done.</p>
<p>All poor fighting, you know,</p>
<p>throughout the course of history, most generals,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re, so I read,</p>
<p>or, you know, they did battles by attrition.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, man, I&rsquo;ve got 150 guys.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got 50.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50,</p>
<p>like, that&rsquo;s great for me.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not so great for the 60 guys that died.</p>
<p>You know, I hope it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>So when you realize that not only,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just Kobe Bryant and you&rsquo;re Phil Jackson too,</p>
<p>you got to do everything.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;ve got to run across the beach in Normandy,</p>
<p>so be it.</p>
<p>But that better be, you should have,</p>
<p>we make sure we thought this through and there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s no way we can like, you know,</p>
<p>walk around the side, huh?</p>
<p>Because oftentimes there is,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of times there&rsquo;s a lot of incentives</p>
<p>in professional fighting too,</p>
<p>for people to want to do that.</p>
<p>And we come up with all sorts of,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m trying to be exciting.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>Is that really what you came here to do?</p>
<p>Cause I came here to win.</p>
<p>And I think that anyone that&rsquo;s really successful</p>
<p>came there to win.</p>
<p>And if it ends up being exciting, well, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I hope that people enjoy watching something and that&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a qualitative assessment anyway.</p>
<p>You know, you want to also be able to, you know,</p>
<p>live the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy, you know, I&rsquo;ll use Meldrick Taylor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big boxing fan.</p>
<p>Meldrick Taylor was an excellent fighter,</p>
<p>came this close to a world title and was stopped with like,</p>
<p>he was in a fight that he was winning with seconds remaining,</p>
<p>literally seconds remaining.</p>
<p>And they probably could have just let it go</p>
<p>and he would have been world champion.</p>
<p>And it was brutal.</p>
<p>If you ever watched legendary nights like a HBO boxing show,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely heartbreaking.</p>
<p>And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight</p>
<p>changed him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>And also, you know, don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d never been hit before,</p>
<p>but it was one of those where you go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all fun and games until you can&rsquo;t remember your name</p>
<p>at age 44 years old.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t come here, what did Patton saying?</p>
<p>Nobody wins a war by dying for his country.</p>
<p>You make the other poor bastard die for his.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re shooting for.</p>
<p>And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage</p>
<p>and that not being a big deal,</p>
<p>like you hear that all the time.</p>
<p>So and so can take shots</p>
<p>that would put a lesser fighter down.</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>You know, like, so let me get this straight.</p>
<p>Your ability to absorb damage is a part of you.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that, don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>that is an attribute that&rsquo;s nice to have if you need it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s plenty of people</p>
<p>that actually have really porous defense</p>
<p>that are just very, very difficult to hurt</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating fighter&rsquo;s perspective on the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, the story that is inspiring</p>
<p>and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting</p>
<p>is when you have taken the damage to still rise up</p>
<p>and be able to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s a flip side of a basically</p>
<p>you failing to defend yourself properly, right?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say for, I think it&rsquo;s a triumph,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a triumph of humanity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a triumph, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>To witness such a thing is unbelievable.</p>
<p>But you still go, this is, there is a cost here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to spend some time working with the military</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been like around and read</p>
<p>Medal of Honor citations, they&rsquo;re unbelievable.</p>
<p>Like you read the story and you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;ll floor you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still a cost</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna be paying that cost a long time.</p>
<p>And most of the time the cost was everything.</p>
<p>And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah,</p>
<p>the value here, it&rsquo;s worth everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I defend your family,</p>
<p>defend your country under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>And if that point is extension of your family,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, hey, this is worth it.</p>
<p>To casually throw your life away or throw your health away,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s foolish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing great about that.</p>
<p>And like you said, it&rsquo;s still an amazing thing to see, but.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also amazing to see you not take damage</p>
<p>as the Floyd Mayweather,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the artistry of like not being hit.</p>
<p>And I wonder if maybe that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t resonate with Floyd as much,</p>
<p>is obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place,</p>
<p>a great man for so many different reasons.</p>
<p>Although it was funny to remember</p>
<p>like there were times when he wasn&rsquo;t very popular.</p>
<p>We love him now because of time of context,</p>
<p>time to move away from some of the nonsense</p>
<p>he had to deal with.</p>
<p>But we got to see him struggle.</p>
<p>And also he had unbelievable sacrifice,</p>
<p>both in and out of the ring,</p>
<p>that we all got to witness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never really seen Floyd struggle like that.</p>
<p>And granted, obviously Floyd isn&rsquo;t like a civil rights</p>
<p>figure like Muhammad Ali was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different time, different place,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a different man.</p>
<p>But basically, I wonder if part of the thing</p>
<p>that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest,</p>
<p>in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things</p>
<p>that he did out in the world and the stands that he made,</p>
<p>we saw him struggle in the ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s humanizing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s weird when people respect Khabib,</p>
<p>but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger.</p>
<p>Khabib is amazing.</p>
<p>But I wonder how people feel about him longterm.</p>
<p>Not like they won&rsquo;t think of him as amazing and great.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been a respectable person and champion.</p>
<p>But the time, he hasn&rsquo;t had to fall, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic</p>
<p>about sort of the way he was in the ring,</p>
<p>sort of being able to explain the artistry that he,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like joking as being playful,</p>
<p>but really he was able to describe the flow,</p>
<p>like a butterfly sting like a bee.</p>
<p>Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy</p>
<p>without talking, without crossing that line</p>
<p>into the Floyd Mayweather,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just talking about money and just talking shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Actually Conor McGregor, when he&rsquo;s not talking shit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty good at like talking about the art</p>
<p>of the martial, like the first mug guy.</p>
<p>And I wish Khabib did the same.</p>
<p>Actually from like the Setia brothers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few, there&rsquo;s a culture of like being poetic</p>
<p>about like being scholars and also bards or whatever,</p>
<p>the poets of the game.</p>
<p>And Khabib was more like just simple</p>
<p>and he lets his actions speak, which is great too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool thing in its own way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nice when you can tell stories</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably why Ali was the great.</p>
<p>Catch me up to, you went to three fights,</p>
<p>I think undefeated, BJ Penn,</p>
<p>we talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible accomplishment,</p>
<p>but you fought a lot of really tough guys.</p>
<p>When was your last fight?</p>
<p>And then catch me up with the injuries.</p>
<p>A lot of people kept more and more and more</p>
<p>were unwilling to fight you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s been, that was why I was out for two years</p>
<p>following the Gray Maynard fight between the fighting Gray</p>
<p>and BJ and the Gray Maynard fight</p>
<p>was actually one I&rsquo;m really proud of</p>
<p>because Gray was very tough.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very big, very strong, very experienced.</p>
<p>I had only five fights at the time</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of skills.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get to fight Gray with what I have today.</p>
<p>I had to fight Gray with what I had in December, 2016.</p>
<p>And that, it really took a lot of discipline,</p>
<p>a lot of focus, a lot of challenge,</p>
<p>to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight</p>
<p>and to win in ultimately dominating fashion,</p>
<p>just not in the dominating, obvious sense</p>
<p>that you see when someone runs across</p>
<p>and just does that to somebody,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t on the list for me at that time.</p>
<p>So that was an interesting one,</p>
<p>but the time away again was very frustrating.</p>
<p>That was incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Before that fight?</p>
<p>After that fight, well,</p>
<p>because I beat Artem Lobov</p>
<p>in the final of the Ultimate Fighter</p>
<p>and Artem is another guy that&rsquo;s tough,</p>
<p>a lot of experience and he&rsquo;s a funny guy</p>
<p>and he said some things on the internet,</p>
<p>so he gets a lot of heat for that.</p>
<p>But he just knocked out three of my teammates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he put a couple of people</p>
<p>in a pretty rough shape at the end of that.</p>
<p>So he was doing well and that was a tough fight.</p>
<p>Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now,</p>
<p>it would be not competitive at all.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t competitive at that time,</p>
<p>but it was a compelling phase.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t close, but it was competitive.</p>
<p>So you were improving and growing fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was nice to have time away.</p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d had more time in the ring,</p>
<p>but again, I&rsquo;d only been doing MMA</p>
<p>for three years at that time.</p>
<p>So the improvement from doing what,</p>
<p>the Bitcoin mining was overriding the ring rust.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe in ring rust, if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>
<p>I can understand why people could feel a certain way,</p>
<p>but if anything, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>you just kind of forget what competition&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and you realize like, oh, you feel butterflies</p>
<p>or something like that and you go,</p>
<p>oh my God, this is different versus no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just your body getting ready to perform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>How do you not have ring rust?</p>
<p>I think I try to practice performing no matter what,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s singing karaoke and I&rsquo;m very good,</p>
<p>but like anything, you name it, talking in front of people.</p>
<p>You embrace the butterflies.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost like, I remember my last fight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just staring at the wall and I&rsquo;m like, huh,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m gonna fight in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>I mean, of course we all heard the phrase,</p>
<p>like you can never walk in the same river twice</p>
<p>because even if the river&rsquo;s the same,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a different man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s a really important thing to understand</p>
<p>because at various points in my martial arts career,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought, oh man, how should I feel?</p>
<p>I remember when I used to do well in competition,</p>
<p>I would feel, I would think these thoughts,</p>
<p>listen to this song, think about this.</p>
<p>I would feel a certain way.</p>
<p>And then if you don&rsquo;t feel that way,</p>
<p>I would start to become stressed</p>
<p>because I was self inflicted versus going,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel how you feel.</p>
<p>Your job is to show up with what you have on the day,</p>
<p>do your absolute best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I will never quit.</p>
<p>I can be sure of that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say I can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>
<p>I can definitely be beat.</p>
<p>I could have lost every single fight that I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>but I control my effort and I control my attitude.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I will do my very best,</p>
<p>execute my game plan and the event&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>If I have to, I&rsquo;ll put my hands up and walk dead forward.</p>
<p>If I need to, it&rsquo;s somebody,</p>
<p>we hope that that&rsquo;s not where it goes,</p>
<p>but like again, that humanizing moment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re shooting for like just the inner,</p>
<p>like the inner, you sacrifice the outer</p>
<p>and all you have left is will,</p>
<p>and you hope it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But if it does, you&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>But I guess to come back,</p>
<p>like the extra periods of time in between fights,</p>
<p>I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging.</p>
<p>It was incredibly, it was heartbreaking sometimes</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m honest, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just waiting.</p>
<p>Oh my God, dude.</p>
<p>Is there politics involved?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, like I,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s every single time you step into the ring,</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s guaranteed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you could be hurt.</p>
<p>You could hurt somebody.</p>
<p>You could win.</p>
<p>You could lose, you know, throwing away,</p>
<p>just like I said, throwing away your healthier life cheaply</p>
<p>makes no sense for anyone.</p>
<p>And, you know, having demonstrating some degree of temperance</p>
<p>is not cowardly either.</p>
<p>I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing.</p>
<p>So I guess like I was trying and always being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always open to fighting the absolute best people possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never turning down fights ever.</p>
<p>You know, if some random jabroni decides</p>
<p>that he wants to fight, I&rsquo;m like, go away.</p>
<p>If I wanted to just fight randoms,</p>
<p>I would just start standing on the table at Denny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and start yelling.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it would have, you know,</p>
<p>some people would be willing to indulge me.</p>
<p>But, you know, you want to fight, you know,</p>
<p>meaningful opponents, challenging opponents,</p>
<p>and I know who and where they are.</p>
<p>And sometimes they&rsquo;re so well.</p>
<p>You did fight in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So the Denny&rsquo;s, but you put the Denny&rsquo;s behind you.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ll be honest,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d have stood up after that fight,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was in great shape</p>
<p>to expect to win in the other fights that evening,</p>
<p>but I could have tried it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were some takers in the crowd,</p>
<p>particularly after they watched me fight,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll fight that guy.</p>
<p>So, okay, so when was the last fight that you had?</p>
<p>That was Darren Elkins.</p>
<p>That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight,</p>
<p>which is great because it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I love maybe five really tough, very tough opponent,</p>
<p>very tough guy, super tough dude.</p>
<p>And that was in July, 2019.</p>
<p>And then right when I was about to fight.</p>
<p>So you were ready to fight regularly after that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You were trying to find a fight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we got Ricardo Llamas, so no one else, none of the,</p>
<p>I was ranked in the top 15 at that point.</p>
<p>And then people didn&rsquo;t want to fight.</p>
<p>We were struggling to find an opponent.</p>
<p>Then Ricardo Llamas, a great, you know,</p>
<p>former title challenger, you know, MMA, you know,</p>
<p>really great history in MMA, recently retired,</p>
<p>but we were supposed to fight in,</p>
<p>I think May, March, March, May of 2020.</p>
<p>And then coronavirus happened.</p>
<p>And so that scrapped the whole show, you know, training.</p>
<p>We were just scrambling to try to keep the gym alive</p>
<p>and take care, you know, I have five or six full, five, six,</p>
<p>I think five full time employees that I, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re my responsibility.</p>
<p>I have to, their livelihood is in my hands and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be irresponsible of me to not take that seriously.</p>
<p>So anyway, we were able to navigate through that time.</p>
<p>And then we were able to reschedule the Llamas fight.</p>
<p>And that was in August of last year.</p>
<p>And I got a, a medical like flag, like, oh, hey, you like,</p>
<p>you, you, you have like a medical condition that we need</p>
<p>to look into when I got pulled from the fight.</p>
<p>And I immediately was concerned because of course,</p>
<p>any serious medical condition you want to go, oh man,</p>
<p>well, I guess I would like to look at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it turns out it was a giant false positive.</p>
<p>And, you know, we find that out, you know,</p>
<p>all of five weeks later and you go, you gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re still waiting for a fight,</p>
<p>waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight,</p>
<p>waiting for a fight.</p>
<p>People won&rsquo;t sign up.</p>
<p>Asked for a number of different opponents, basically said,</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m willing to fight anybody that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tough and moving forward.</p>
<p>Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Denny Gay</p>
<p>for, I guess it would have been this, this March.</p>
<p>And then I was training in January,</p>
<p>working on working on some stuff.</p>
<p>I was out training with Raymond Daniels in,</p>
<p>in California, Raymond&rsquo;s amazing, unbelievable,</p>
<p>you know, kickboxing, karate style kickboxer,</p>
<p>fantastic martial artist, great teacher,</p>
<p>great training partner and good friend.</p>
<p>And, you know, just really bad luck, you know,</p>
<p>kind of a fall in the middle of, in the middle of training.</p>
<p>And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>And you go like, man, right at the time where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh man, all right, finally moving forward, you know,</p>
<p>having the opportunity to fight.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s a really tough guy.</p>
<p>You know, you have to fight well</p>
<p>if you want to have a good chance to do well with him.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t fight well, it&rsquo;s going to be a rough night.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s exactly what I signed up for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want with BJ,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we want with Elkins, that was gray.</p>
<p>And then the universe goes, hey man, I hear you,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also this.</p>
<p>So anyway, unfortunately it&rsquo;s healing up</p>
<p>and then hopefully I&rsquo;m trying to,</p>
<p>looking for May, I think.</p>
<p>May this year?</p>
<p>May of this year.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been about five weeks since the injury.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to heal up, you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;ll be okay by then.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t need a big camp at this point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had years of camp.</p>
<p>Not going to curtail my drinking or anything like that.</p>
<p>Obviously, you know, come on, man.</p>
<p>Life is meant to be lived.</p>
<p>And you know, so it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m in good shape.</p>
<p>I always, I&rsquo;m always training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do my best to train around the injury</p>
<p>to the extent that I can right now without, you know,</p>
<p>hurting myself longterm.</p>
<p>So is there a particular opponents you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>Yeah. Anybody, anybody forward?</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I tried to, I asked,</p>
<p>I asked the second that I got hurt,</p>
<p>I sent a message to Dan and I said, hey man,</p>
<p>like I just want you to be the first person to know.</p>
<p>You know, I just was pretty reasonably injured.</p>
<p>We just got an MRI.</p>
<p>Doctor says like, hey man, you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>and you need to take like three weeks off, off.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re going to immediately,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to tear it the whole way.</p>
<p>And this is going to be surgery.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s going to be an additional,</p>
<p>like eight weeks on top of that</p>
<p>to start to rehab it through PT.</p>
<p>And anyway, you know, so I let him know,</p>
<p>hey, if you can push this thing back,</p>
<p>I would love to keep on the car.</p>
<p>I would love to keep the fight.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, I respect you a lot as an opponent.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s been brutal trying</p>
<p>to get anybody to sign on.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re into it, I&rsquo;m still there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he turned that down.</p>
<p>I understand he had other things going on</p>
<p>and he and his wife were expecting a child coming up.</p>
<p>So he needed to, he needed to fight.</p>
<p>And anyway, you know, I guess we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s coming forward.</p>
<p>Is there somebody like super tough</p>
<p>in the featherweight division that you,</p>
<p>you seem to like enjoy the difficult puzzles.</p>
<p>Is there somebody especially difficult</p>
<p>that you would like to fight?</p>
<p>I would like to fight.</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;ll need to win at least one fight before this.</p>
<p>And I look forward to coming back</p>
<p>and giving my best effort to do that.</p>
<p>I want to fight to beat Megumin Sharapov.</p>
<p>I want to fight Yair Rodriguez.</p>
<p>I want to fight Korean Zombie.</p>
<p>And you know, this is complicated, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be fun.</p>
<p>I would love to see that fight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating fight.</p>
<p>That would be fun.</p>
<p>He would be very challenging.</p>
<p>All those guys are very challenging.</p>
<p>And so I look forward to just staying healthy</p>
<p>to the extent that we can coming back</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to fight multiple times this year,</p>
<p>hell or high water.</p>
<p>Hell yes.</p>
<p>Hey, by the way, I completely forgot</p>
<p>because you were talking about the systems</p>
<p>and decision trees and the illusion of choice</p>
<p>made me think of Sam Harris and I forgot to mention it.</p>
<p>So he talks about free will quite a bit</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s an illusion of free will.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the.</p>
<p>Bold claim, Cotton.</p>
<p>That the, you know, maybe the universe</p>
<p>constructed that little game where it makes us feel</p>
<p>like we have a bunch of choices, but we really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really always ending up with a middle finger.</p>
<p>That would be hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you see before you die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a giant middle finger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, fuck.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a free will?</p>
<p>Like we feel like we&rsquo;re making choices.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking, again, what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s a system of martial arts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Hanzo Gracie, there&rsquo;s different schools</p>
<p>and whatever, and then you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>okay, how can I think outside these systems?</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also a system that&rsquo;s our human society</p>
<p>and we feel like there&rsquo;s an actual choice</p>
<p>being made by us individuals.</p>
<p>Do you think that choice is real?</p>
<p>Or is it just an illusion?</p>
<p>Well, okay, that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily equipped to answer this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll do my best.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess I would say to start with,</p>
<p>sure would be interesting if it wasn&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>if the choice wasn&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>would be pretty interesting if it is real.</p>
<p>First off, I would start with facilitative beliefs</p>
<p>versus not facilitative beliefs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, I think the world&rsquo;s out to get me.</p>
<p>True, not true, what next?</p>
<p>Probably not a facilitative belief.</p>
<p>Even if you, imagine you believe there&rsquo;s no free will.</p>
<p>Okay, now what?</p>
<p>Does that justify every single impulse</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to give into?</p>
<p>Or does the belief in free will,</p>
<p>does the belief in my ability to work hard, to focus,</p>
<p>to be disciplined, to improve my position,</p>
<p>improve my situation, whether it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>although I think that at least many of us would argue</p>
<p>that at least whether there&rsquo;s some sort of internal driver</p>
<p>that allows for that.</p>
<p>We live in a material world.</p>
<p>Your actions do affect the world.</p>
<p>I can choose to pick that water up or not.</p>
<p>And anyway, I would say a belief strongly</p>
<p>in the idea of picking facilitative beliefs,</p>
<p>and going, hey, I will adjust,</p>
<p>whether this belief system is right or wrong</p>
<p>on a cosmic level, I&rsquo;m nowhere near smart enough</p>
<p>to understand, but I can say me deciding that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, for instance, I&rsquo;m gonna walk over</p>
<p>to have a conversation with someone in a hotel lobby,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never met them, and I go over,</p>
<p>and I start with, oh, this is gonna be interesting,</p>
<p>and I just walk over there,</p>
<p>versus in my head, I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s this asshole want?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to have two very different conversations.</p>
<p>I could be right that this person&rsquo;s not very polite</p>
<p>or thinks negatively of me right from go,</p>
<p>but I think that that&rsquo;s probably not a facilitative belief.</p>
<p>People talk about, how is that gonna help me</p>
<p>navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?</p>
<p>And I think about that for,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, fighting, it&rsquo;s a good example,</p>
<p>like confidence, plenty of people believe</p>
<p>plenty of things that aren&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>myself included, I&rsquo;m sure, all the time.</p>
<p>And anyway, believing that you can do something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, I think I can win,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you a positive outcome,</p>
<p>but I would say most of us would probably,</p>
<p>most of us would argue that it helps.</p>
<p>Think about depression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s depression if not a negative,</p>
<p>unfacilitative belief that is not always,</p>
<p>that oftentimes is not reflected by reality,</p>
<p>but you project it onto reality,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s understandable if it makes you feel like,</p>
<p>oh, man, this isn&rsquo;t gonna work out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the prospects are going well.</p>
<p>And then if you feel like you can&rsquo;t get out of that loop,</p>
<p>that seems pretty rough.</p>
<p>And I see a lot of things out in society right now</p>
<p>where you go, whether you agree or disagree</p>
<p>with various positions on things, you go,</p>
<p>is that a facilitative belief?</p>
<p>Even if that is true, which is arguable, anything.</p>
<p>So what next, man?</p>
<p>So where does this end?</p>
<p>When is the positive, what&rsquo;s the happy ending here?</p>
<p>And if they go, well, there is no happy ending,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, so now what?</p>
<p>So what do we do here?</p>
<p>And I guess.</p>
<p>So choose the facilitative belief, and in your intuition,</p>
<p>believing that free will is real</p>
<p>is more productive for a successful life.</p>
<p>Absolutely, because otherwise, how am I not,</p>
<p>first off, how can society function if it&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>So how can I blame you or anyone else</p>
<p>or hold anyone responsible for anything</p>
<p>if free will isn&rsquo;t real?</p>
<p>Well, no, that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>But at the surface level, what you&rsquo;re saying is true,</p>
<p>but perhaps if we truly internalize</p>
<p>that free will is an illusion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start to figure out something</p>
<p>that transforms the way we see society.</p>
<p>For example, we are very individual centric,</p>
<p>so believing that free will is real</p>
<p>puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people</p>
<p>when they do something bad.</p>
<p>Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion,</p>
<p>we start to think about the system of humans together</p>
<p>as this mechanism for progress,</p>
<p>as opposed to where individual people</p>
<p>are responsible for their actions, good or bad.</p>
<p>So we remove the value, the weight we assign</p>
<p>to the accomplishments or the violence,</p>
<p>the negative stuff done by individuals,</p>
<p>or more look at the progress of society.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that looks like,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like as opposed to focusing</p>
<p>on the individual ants of an ant colony,</p>
<p>looking at the entirety of the ant colony.</p>
<p>So that, I think it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I would just say that that&rsquo;s a reasonable thing to suggest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a seismic shift, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to say whether that would be better or worse,</p>
<p>but I guess I&rsquo;ll use this as a convenient one for me.</p>
<p>So I remember the last time we spoke,</p>
<p>I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters</p>
<p>in certainly recent history,</p>
<p>probably human history period, Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a big fan of making people live in the world</p>
<p>that they wanna believe in.</p>
<p>Well, if free will doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just about how things move forward,</p>
<p>when are we gonna be high fiving this guy or what?</p>
<p>Because I remember what I said,</p>
<p>and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.</p>
<p>Yeah, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Ryan brought up, or I brought up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally a giant book about Hitler.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Hitler, World War II,</p>
<p>and Stalin recently.</p>
<p>For recently.</p>
<p>Oh man, this has become like a meme.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan with like DMT and me with Hitler.</p>
<p>Can I pick something more positive?</p>
<p>Like cat in the hat or something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But you brought up Hitler as an example</p>
<p>of something particular,</p>
<p>some philosophical discussions we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>And the excellent, eloquent,</p>
<p>and the full of integrity MMA journalist</p>
<p>clipped out something you&rsquo;ve said about Hitler</p>
<p>and said that, I forget what the headlines are,</p>
<p>but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation.</p>
<p>Basically, it was intentionally misunderstanding</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like, I get that they&rsquo;re stupid,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m stupid too.</p>
<p>So I know what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have a lot of sympathy for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, I can&rsquo;t give you a pass on that.</p>
<p>But basically, intentionally misunderstanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But what I find funny is that,</p>
<p>hey, we gotta be careful what we believe.</p>
<p>And again, back to the cancel culture thing</p>
<p>that we discussed last time as well,</p>
<p>where would I like to apologize?</p>
<p>I mean, no, actually something about cancel culture</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been seeing things culturally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I will be damned if I apologize for anything</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t need to apologize for</p>
<p>because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance.</p>
<p>Now, you could say that I&rsquo;m not a historical scholar,</p>
<p>which I would agree immediately.</p>
<p>And also that I oftentimes in eloquently</p>
<p>or inarticulately phrase things, which I&rsquo;ll agree is again.</p>
<p>But ultimately, going, hey, I wanna make you believe,</p>
<p>live in the world that you&rsquo;re suggesting ought to exist.</p>
<p>Okay, so if there&rsquo;s no free will,</p>
<p>how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically</p>
<p>before we start going, hey, this is good</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re experiencing a social reckoning</p>
<p>in our country at the moment,</p>
<p>for good and for other probably, I guess.</p>
<p>And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably not something that would fly.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a fair thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It might not fly from the individual perspective,</p>
<p>but if you zoom out and think,</p>
<p>appreciate society as just like an ant colony</p>
<p>as a beautifully complex system,</p>
<p>like we kinda, from the individual perspective,</p>
<p>we value progress, especially progress of the individual,</p>
<p>but in whole progress of societies.</p>
<p>But if you accept that this is just a complex system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily headed anywhere,</p>
<p>that this is almost like that river is just flowing,</p>
<p>I think that removes the burden of always striving,</p>
<p>of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that if we have no control,</p>
<p>you can like arrive at some kind of other zen state.</p>
<p>Does that sound very human though?</p>
<p>That goes against, I think,</p>
<p>our current human condition as we experience it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve communicated that to each other.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve taught, like through these social forces,</p>
<p>taught each other that our lives matter and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe if we convince ourselves</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just sort of like little things in a stream</p>
<p>and ultimately none of it matters,</p>
<p>there might be some kind of enjoyment</p>
<p>to be discovered through that process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, listen, I&rsquo;m a capitalist, rah, rah, like.</p>
<p>But I guess I think you bring up a really important point.</p>
<p>I guess almost anything like capitalism,</p>
<p>I only get to experience it as I sit here now</p>
<p>and I get to live, I was raised in the United States,</p>
<p>have traveled around the world a little bit,</p>
<p>have had the good fortune of meeting many people</p>
<p>from many different places.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an end user of capitalism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how it got here,</p>
<p>whether it was, I wasn&rsquo;t there at the start of this idea.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there for, hey, how did we come up with this idea?</p>
<p>How did we arrive?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m nowhere near well read enough</p>
<p>to understand any of that really even secondhand.</p>
<p>And I guess recognizing that communism,</p>
<p>Marxism, socialism, anarchism, anything is,</p>
<p>these are all perspectives that all have,</p>
<p>I guess, various strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>But I guess one thing I&rsquo;m always,</p>
<p>I guess I would say the burden,</p>
<p>it seems to me that if you wanna make a change,</p>
<p>the burden of proof is on the person</p>
<p>implying that there needs to be a change.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s nothing there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like if you wanna create a small shift,</p>
<p>a ripple, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but a seismic ripping shift in how we exist</p>
<p>or how we experience the world as human beings.</p>
<p>And you mentioned fighting,</p>
<p>why watching someone undergo,</p>
<p>take abuse on a level in the ring that&rsquo;s just shocking</p>
<p>and then triumph in spite of it is like,</p>
<p>this is unbelievable.</p>
<p>This is part of the magic of combat sports.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s part of the magic,</p>
<p>the other side of the magic</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get talked about sometimes</p>
<p>is that the trajectory of that individual&rsquo;s life later on</p>
<p>is not always great,</p>
<p>or let me rephrase, there&rsquo;s a cost for that.</p>
<p>But if we remember, you mentioned removing the struggle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t personally, the struggle is what makes life life.</p>
<p>And also, I guess, something Faraz has brought up to me</p>
<p>on a number of occasions, and it makes sense to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically humans only understand things</p>
<p>through relative comparison.</p>
<p>I only understand heat because I&rsquo;ve known cold.</p>
<p>I only understand, it&rsquo;s like talking to someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never experienced any sort of hardship</p>
<p>and then their latte isn&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>and then they pitch a fit</p>
<p>versus someone that&rsquo;s gone through</p>
<p>a great deal of challenge, struggle in their life.</p>
<p>They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective.</p>
<p>And anyway, and of course, even as a relative thing</p>
<p>and what I perceive to be even may not be even,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m particularly softer</p>
<p>or something in the other direction without realizing,</p>
<p>because I can only understand what I can understand.</p>
<p>But the idea that we wanna fundamentally alter ourselves</p>
<p>as a species and as people</p>
<p>seems like an incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove,</p>
<p>and also like an incredibly dangerous idea,</p>
<p>because it always comes back to,</p>
<p>well, who&rsquo;s gonna be responsible for this?</p>
<p>Who gets to do the choosing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good idea?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not a good idea?</p>
<p>And I guess that actually brings me kind of to a,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve been encountering recently</p>
<p>in discussions with friends.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s only two types of people</p>
<p>that I encounter at this point.</p>
<p>People with a more or less libertarian tilt</p>
<p>to their thinking and people without it.</p>
<p>And when I say libertarian,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that in the political party sense</p>
<p>or even the belief system.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m like, hey, you do you buddy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my, what you&rsquo;re up to is not my concern</p>
<p>versus what you&rsquo;re up to is my concern.</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;ve always watched,</p>
<p>various points in history, people on this side</p>
<p>or people on that side are more or less,</p>
<p>I guess, problematic, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that in the internet sense,</p>
<p>you know, more of an issue,</p>
<p>but the world is always full of people</p>
<p>that wanna tell you what you need to be doing</p>
<p>as opposed to more or less doing no harm.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s one of the ones,</p>
<p>anytime I&rsquo;m trying to tell other people what to do,</p>
<p>I better hope I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s bizarre to me how many people are so confident</p>
<p>that their side or their position is the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not only right for them,</p>
<p>but right enough that they can enforce it on others.</p>
<p>And that just seems incredibly dangerous to me.</p>
<p>And I guess that comes back to even Sam&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>about, oh, we want to,</p>
<p>trying to spread the idea that free will doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s damaging, but it very well may be.</p>
<p>And plenty of other things could be as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, it goes way over my head</p>
<p>as to the implications of all of these.</p>
<p>And I guess all of us are in evangelist for something,</p>
<p>but I guess it&rsquo;s weird that we&rsquo;ve gotten this far</p>
<p>as a species and now we wanna take like sharp, sharp turns.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve been taking a bunch of sharp turns</p>
<p>throughout history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, you know, that&rsquo;s the way,</p>
<p>you know, okay, humans love power.</p>
<p>And one way to attain power is to say,</p>
<p>everything that you guys are doing is wrong</p>
<p>and I have the right thing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna build up a giant cult of people</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna overthrow.</p>
<p>And indirectly what that results in me is me gaining power.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get all the big revolutions</p>
<p>in human history, saying I&rsquo;m done with the thing</p>
<p>that the powerful are currently doing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna overthrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where probably all the identity politics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening now is people that didn&rsquo;t have power before</p>
<p>are looking to gain power.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where Jordan Peterson criticized identity politics</p>
<p>is people with the right, with the good intentions,</p>
<p>I should say, are in seeking power,</p>
<p>allow power to corrupt them as power always does.</p>
<p>And so they lose track of like the devils</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re fighting by becoming the same kind of devils,</p>
<p>the same kind of evil that they&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just the progress of human history.</p>
<p>But hopefully as these power greedy people</p>
<p>keep attaining power with a progressive mindset,</p>
<p>over time things get better and better as they have been.</p>
<p>Like each iteration?</p>
<p>Each iteration.</p>
<p>A lot of unfairness happens.</p>
<p>A lot of hypocrisy happens.</p>
<p>A lot of people are trampled along the way</p>
<p>by those who mean well.</p>
<p>But over time, like lessons are learned</p>
<p>or like human civilization accumulates lessons</p>
<p>and in part learns lessons of history</p>
<p>and it gets better and better over time,</p>
<p>even though in the short term,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people acting not their best selves.</p>
<p>And you know, that seems to be the progress</p>
<p>of human history.</p>
<p>The idea of internalizing the free will not being real.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re actually making me realize</p>
<p>that that ultimately leads to a kind of.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that go in a nihilistic direction?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s both nihilistic</p>
<p>or if you want to make it a political system,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more like communist type of a system</p>
<p>where like the value of the individual</p>
<p>is completely reduced, removed.</p>
<p>Or another perspective is like the freedom of an individual</p>
<p>is not to be valued or protected.</p>
<p>And so from our current perspective,</p>
<p>the systems that seem to have worked,</p>
<p>the United States works pretty damn well,</p>
<p>despite all the different criticisms.</p>
<p>It seems like freedom of the individual</p>
<p>in all its forms seems to be fundamental</p>
<p>to the success of the United States.</p>
<p>And so we should, it&rsquo;s a, however the hell you put it,</p>
<p>is like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether free will</p>
<p>is or isn&rsquo;t an illusion.</p>
<p>The belief that it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Protects the individual from the group,</p>
<p>which is fundamentally, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that always seems like the big issue of history.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s more of me than there is of you.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, yikes.</p>
<p>And you want to be yourself.</p>
<p>You want to be different.</p>
<p>You want to have a different religion.</p>
<p>You want to be a different skin color.</p>
<p>You want to do this.</p>
<p>All the bad tribal things happen</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s more of me than you.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s always the fundamental</p>
<p>power imbalance though, right?</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing about the libertarian thinking,</p>
<p>I guess I, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Those words are really.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re all charged, I know actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all charged.</p>
<p>I may not scale up, but I mean,</p>
<p>more like on a philosophical underpinning</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, yeah, basically,</p>
<p>hey, you feel free to believe I&rsquo;m a fool.</p>
<p>And I mean, plenty of people do, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>But as long as you don&rsquo;t chase me down the hall</p>
<p>and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the libertarian viewpoint,</p>
<p>which I probably espouse, like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much like freedom of the individual</p>
<p>is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re trying to hurt you.</p>
<p>The thing is you also have to, I believe,</p>
<p>put in the work of empathy of understanding</p>
<p>what others, how, what leaving people</p>
<p>the fuck alone means to others.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that an interesting thing?</p>
<p>If I believe in freedom of the individual</p>
<p>and I take that, like all of these, like you said,</p>
<p>you take them past just their first why question.</p>
<p>You ask why, why, why, why, or how, how, how, how many times.</p>
<p>Should that not extend to respect for you,</p>
<p>respect for your position,</p>
<p>respect for your individual lived experience,</p>
<p>which could be grossly different than mine.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the problem with saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an individual, I&rsquo;m not gonna bother you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like, that&rsquo;s not actionable.</p>
<p>Because to be, to make it actionable,</p>
<p>you have to think the why, why, why, why, why,</p>
<p>you have to do the steps beyond.</p>
<p>You think, what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>That means understanding how even my very existence</p>
<p>like hurts others.</p>
<p>Because you have to understand that like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you&rsquo;re not just sitting alone in a room.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using like public transit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using the police force,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using firefighters, you&rsquo;re using the,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re using a lot of resources</p>
<p>that are publicly shared.</p>
<p>And some of those resources are unfairly distributed.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve agreed that we&rsquo;re gonna pay taxes</p>
<p>and those taxes are gonna go towards</p>
<p>building some kind of infrastructure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s already towards social.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not a real, you&rsquo;re not a real sort of,</p>
<p>I talked to Michael Malice, like anarchist, right?</p>
<p>Saying like basically, full, just leave me the fuck alone</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, that&rsquo;s not the American society</p>
<p>as it stands currently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve agreed that there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>certain social institutions that we pay into.</p>
<p>And some of the sort of discussions about race</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>is about those institutions being institutionally unfair,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s race or gender, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Listen, I have a bunch of criticisms</p>
<p>of the way that conversation carries itself out,</p>
<p>but the thing is, what&rsquo;s valuable is to actually listen</p>
<p>and empathize.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not often talked about</p>
<p>with the leave me the fuck alone mindset</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, it doesn&rsquo;t have that little component</p>
<p>which I think could be fundamental</p>
<p>to the function of a society, which is like social.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the, what is it, the Obama, you didn&rsquo;t build it</p>
<p>or you didn&rsquo;t build it alone or whatever,</p>
<p>however that goes.</p>
<p>But basically we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accomplish anything</p>
<p>as individuals without the help of others.</p>
<p>And to be able to then start to think,</p>
<p>okay, so what is my duty?</p>
<p>What is my responsibility to other human beings</p>
<p>to be respectful, to be loving, to help them</p>
<p>as part of this functioning society?</p>
<p>That starts, that&rsquo;s actually a lot of work</p>
<p>to start to think about that.</p>
<p>Because then I have to like think,</p>
<p>okay, Ryan, what&rsquo;s his life like?</p>
<p>As a business owner during COVID, what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>And then he has, there&rsquo;s employees that run the gym.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that stress like?</p>
<p>Or about the fighting and the injury and so on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>That empathy takes a lot of like compute cycles.</p>
<p>And also a lot of energy, right?</p>
<p>But I have to go through that computation</p>
<p>if I want to be an individual that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p>If I may, I guess like to come back to Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>one of the things he said is service to others</p>
<p>is the rent that you pay for your,</p>
<p>is the price you pay for your rent here on earth.</p>
<p>And now one of the things that I think that I see</p>
<p>as a result of the internet all the time</p>
<p>is people talking about global giant problems,</p>
<p>social problems that are society wide,</p>
<p>that are massive, truly massive.</p>
<p>And frankly, beyond the power of any of us to solve.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly on an individual level.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve discussed things with friends.</p>
<p>Like my father&rsquo;s an environmental attorney,</p>
<p>like has been for a long time</p>
<p>and has been an engineer for a long time.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not, barely know anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m read in a little bit of various things.</p>
<p>But climate change, oh my God,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so concerned about climate change.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do about climate change?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I can do is I can not litter.</p>
<p>I can try to conserve energy where I can.</p>
<p>I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>What can I personally do about some giant social problem</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t start and is out of my control?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I can be decent to the people around me.</p>
<p>I can mention, I can demonstrate empathy</p>
<p>and I can demonstrate consideration</p>
<p>for the people in my circle.</p>
<p>And to the extent that I can the people outside of my circle,</p>
<p>but yelling at the trees over problems</p>
<p>that are borderline cosmic, doesn&rsquo;t seem very productive.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel like I&rsquo;m cool and important</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking about something,</p>
<p>well, hundreds of years from now, the water will rise.</p>
<p>Maybe it will, maybe it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely on my head, I know nothing.</p>
<p>But focusing on the problems that we can actually solve,</p>
<p>it comes back to the same thing.</p>
<p>I want to win a fight.</p>
<p>I would love to win a fight.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control that.</p>
<p>What I can do is I can control each individual step</p>
<p>that I take around the ring</p>
<p>and try to make the next correct move.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look, no, it gets people&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, they get all excited.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m trying to keep my language in check,</p>
<p>but they get all excited thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>problems that are like Superman</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t solve these problems.</p>
<p>Like you could be that powerful</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t make all of the bad things go away,</p>
<p>but you can absolutely change yourself.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the lessons that, you know,</p>
<p>like the good lessons from religion that happened,</p>
<p>the good lessons from the great men and women</p>
<p>throughout history that we&rsquo;re inspired by,</p>
<p>that talk about change starting with within,</p>
<p>and, you know, again,</p>
<p>treating the people around you decently</p>
<p>and treating the people around you decently</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even necessarily mean the golden rule.</p>
<p>Do unto others as you would like them to do to you.</p>
<p>I go, well, maybe what I would like</p>
<p>and what this person would like aren&rsquo;t the same thing.</p>
<p>Well, how am I going to get to the bottom of that?</p>
<p>Cause I could be attempting to be decent to this person.</p>
<p>And by my standards, I am being decent,</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;m missing the mark by theirs.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t possibly, if I just interacted with you,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like someone talking about</p>
<p>some nonsense microaggression.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, so let me get this straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met you before.</p>
<p>You never met me before.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re interpreting some minor comment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve made in the least charitable way possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that you couldn&rsquo;t be annoyed,</p>
<p>but your expectation for that level of consideration</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to be disappointed a lot.</p>
<p>Now, if you, if we&rsquo;re someone that&rsquo;s in your life</p>
<p>on a consistent basis and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey, I really don&rsquo;t appreciate what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>or what you&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>Do you realize that this is how I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>this is how I&rsquo;m perceiving you go, oh man, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>Of course I would hear what you have to say,</p>
<p>but I guess trying to recognize that, you know,</p>
<p>I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general,</p>
<p>but that level of the level of specificity that,</p>
<p>that, that, that requires increases</p>
<p>as it gets closer to you.</p>
<p>And I have, as a person,</p>
<p>I have a very finite amount of resources financially,</p>
<p>intellectually, emotionally, physically.</p>
<p>If I chuck, you know, 0.001% of it</p>
<p>in every single different direction, what am I doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when people are like,</p>
<p>oh, I care deeply about Tibet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why aren&rsquo;t you over there?</p>
<p>Go build a house, man.</p>
<p>Get on a plane, go build a house.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>So really what you want to do is post on Facebook</p>
<p>and, and, and accept high fives</p>
<p>for how much of a good guy you are.</p>
<p>I got an idea.</p>
<p>Go help somebody in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Go be, go play with, go play with some kids.</p>
<p>Go be a friend to someone that doesn&rsquo;t have a friend.</p>
<p>Read a book, try to educate yourself.</p>
<p>And so I guess to, to come back,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all of these problems aren&rsquo;t solvable on a grand scale,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like by attempting to address them</p>
<p>in our personal lives, we do better.</p>
<p>But rather than a giant airing of the grievances</p>
<p>on a, on a consistent basis,</p>
<p>not that that isn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes necessary and valuable,</p>
<p>but after you air your grievances, you go,</p>
<p>hey, how about we, we sort this out?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next step?</p>
<p>And, and I guess, again,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re trying to address it on a giant social level,</p>
<p>it just seems unmanageable to me,</p>
<p>even if you have the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but nevertheless, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot you can do on social networks.</p>
<p>I mean, I enjoy tweeting and consuming Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I apply the exact same principle</p>
<p>that you just said, which is free will and discussion,</p>
<p>which is like, I approach it in a way</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t get stuck in this loop that&rsquo;s counterproductive.</p>
<p>I try to do things that are productive.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s just like you said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, like what kind of things can I do in this world?</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s tweeting or building things,</p>
<p>those are low effort tweeting,</p>
<p>or actually building businesses</p>
<p>or building ideas out as high effort.</p>
<p>What can I do that will actually solve problems?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the way I approach it.</p>
<p>And I do wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to at scale,</p>
<p>encourage each other to approach like social media</p>
<p>and communication with fellow humans in that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How do you think that would be done?</p>
<p>I guess, like to improve the,</p>
<p>improve the quality of discourse, maybe.</p>
<p>Like, or even like you said,</p>
<p>the empathy or the decency of discourse.</p>
<p>I think people should be, you know,</p>
<p>incentivized, encouraged to do that.</p>
<p>I think most of what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we see happening on Twitter and Facebook and so on</p>
<p>has to do with very small,</p>
<p>very powerful implementation details.</p>
<p>It goes down to like, what is the source</p>
<p>of the dopamine rush, the like button,</p>
<p>the sharing mechanisms,</p>
<p>just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>So like a lot, a lot of the stuff we see now</p>
<p>is the result of just initial implementations</p>
<p>of these systems that we didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>So the modernization comes from engagement</p>
<p>and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing.</p>
<p>It was not always obvious.</p>
<p>It was not obvious from the beginning.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a big dopamine rush</p>
<p>from getting more followers and likes and shares.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gotten addicted to this feeling</p>
<p>like how many people are commenting,</p>
<p>how many people are saying, like clicking like and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that dopamine rush.</p>
<p>So we want to say the thing that will get the most likes</p>
<p>and like unmasked in society.</p>
<p>And then the other thing that was expected</p>
<p>is the controversial, the divisive will get the most likes.</p>
<p>So it had to do with the initial mechanisms</p>
<p>of likes and shares resulting in an outcome</p>
<p>that was unpredicted, which is huge amounts of division</p>
<p>irrespective of like any of the basics of human connection</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve actually all come to understand</p>
<p>that society is valuable at the individual level</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re saying, but unmasked what results</p>
<p>is like you throw all that out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all just divisive at scale discourse.</p>
<p>I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth</p>
<p>like incentivizing you to challenge yourself</p>
<p>to grows individual and most importantly</p>
<p>to be happy at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So like incentivize you feeling good</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s long lasting longterm.</p>
<p>I think what makes people actually feel good</p>
<p>is being kind to others longterm.</p>
<p>In the short term what feels good is getting a lot of likes.</p>
<p>And I think those are just different incentives</p>
<p>that if implemented correctly</p>
<p>you can just build social networks</p>
<p>that would do much better.</p>
<p>So do you think it comes from a structural perspective?</p>
<p>I guess at what point does you mention like</p>
<p>you mentioned free will and also you mentioned</p>
<p>feeling good and again working hard.</p>
<p>I know that you have the, I guess the, was it a race or?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the Goggins thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s four by four by 48 challenge</p>
<p>where you run four miles every four hours for two days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a bunch of, the challenge of it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just the running, the running is very tough</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly the sleep deprivation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just training every four hours.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a struggle, right?</p>
<p>But the struggle gives meaning.</p>
<p>And ultimately I guess so how can we,</p>
<p>because you mentioned like you said adjusting things</p>
<p>on like a, I guess like a programming level almost,</p>
<p>based programming level so that the interface</p>
<p>is different for the user.</p>
<p>But at what point does the user have a responsibility</p>
<p>to as a man or a woman or a person</p>
<p>to just behave more decently?</p>
<p>How can we I guess utilize, what can we do?</p>
<p>It seems like our society is so grossly missing</p>
<p>like a Martin Luther King right now,</p>
<p>like the great inspiring characters</p>
<p>throughout American history, throughout world history.</p>
<p>Where are the great leaders?</p>
<p>So leadership is part of it, but that&rsquo;s definitely,</p>
<p>where are the great leaders is a very good question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of a question of our political systems</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re not pushing forward the great leaders.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also just, okay,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some just basic engineering shit</p>
<p>which is when you and I, when you Ryan and I</p>
<p>are in a room alone and we&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re strangers, the incentives</p>
<p>are for us to get along.</p>
<p>Like just when we&rsquo;re together in person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even saying some kind of profound.</p>
<p>But when you remove that.</p>
<p>When we remove that, the implementation</p>
<p>of social networks as they stand right now</p>
<p>in the digital space, a very different set of incentives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more fun to destroy others, to be shitty to others.</p>
<p>And it becomes this endless loop, like you were saying,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ultimately destructive and not productive.</p>
<p>And I think it has to do with just the interfaces</p>
<p>of making it feel good to be nice to others.</p>
<p>Because currently it doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as good</p>
<p>to be nice to others on the internet.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as bad as it does in real life</p>
<p>to be shitty to others on the internet.</p>
<p>So the incentives are just wrong.</p>
<p>I think there is a technology solution to this,</p>
<p>or at least a solution to improve</p>
<p>this communication mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious how.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas,</p>
<p>but this is fascinating because I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to talk to Jack Dorsey quite a bit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the CEO of Twitter.</p>
<p>And he is legitimately has, in this conversation,</p>
<p>he would agree with everything.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a good human being,</p>
<p>and he has a lot of really good ideas how to improve things.</p>
<p>The question when you&rsquo;re a captain of a ship,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a question whether a CEO is even a captain,</p>
<p>how much can you actually steer that ship</p>
<p>once it&rsquo;s gotten large enough?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much momentum, there&rsquo;s so many users,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people who are marketing and PR and lawyers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to change things.</p>
<p>Is it difficult because of the fallout,</p>
<p>or is it difficult because it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>like literally out of this power?</p>
<p>So power is weird when you have a large organization.</p>
<p>This is why the great leaders,</p>
<p>this is what great leaders do,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s presidents or leaders of companies.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, I would argue Musk is that way,</p>
<p>is to walk into a room full of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t want you to create drama.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, man.</p>
<p>When people just kind of want to be nice,</p>
<p>the niceness creates momentum and nobody wants to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the systems thing.</p>
<p>Everybody just behaves in the way</p>
<p>they were previously behaving</p>
<p>in the way they&rsquo;re supposed to behave,</p>
<p>and nobody wants to raise a fuss.</p>
<p>It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve been doing is bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re fired, you&rsquo;re cool.</p>
<p>What is it that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I think you have to create constant revolutions</p>
<p>within a company that&rsquo;s very, very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Structurally and psychologically, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do,</p>
<p>to be able to sort of, yeah,</p>
<p>to constantly challenge the way things have been done</p>
<p>in the past, which is why another way it&rsquo;s often done</p>
<p>is a startup, like a small company,</p>
<p>basically a small company becomes really successful</p>
<p>and then no longer can turn the ship,</p>
<p>so a new startup comes along, a new competitor</p>
<p>that then challenges the big ship,</p>
<p>and then that starts out the winner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like Google came to be,</p>
<p>so Twitter came to be, and Facebook, and so on.</p>
<p>And Apple has, that was the dream of Steve Jobs</p>
<p>is it would succeed for many decades, for like centuries.</p>
<p>That was the idea that you would keep creating revolutions,</p>
<p>and under Steve Jobs, Apple successfully pivoted</p>
<p>a bunch of times, just like reinvented themselves,</p>
<p>which is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Because I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard, at least I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if this is accurate, because I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But in reality, the reason that all of these amazing things</p>
<p>were done was because this person was willing to,</p>
<p>well obviously brilliant, and then also willing</p>
<p>to rattle everyone&rsquo;s cage periodically</p>
<p>and say, hey, what&rsquo;s going on is not what we need</p>
<p>to be doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting thing.</p>
<p>So he would rattle the cage, but he would also,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if those are intricately connected</p>
<p>or always have to be connected,</p>
<p>but he would just be a dick.</p>
<p>So maybe by his standard, I am lazy and worthless.</p>
<p>Well, he would say that to you, right?</p>
<p>Is he being a dick though, if by his standard,</p>
<p>I mean, again, it&rsquo;s like everyone&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>compared to somebody.</p>
<p>You know, I guess.</p>
<p>But, so you apparently are able to take that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just, there&rsquo;s ways to cross the line.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is, okay, the fascinating thing</p>
<p>about being a leader, especially a leader of companies,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a people problem.</p>
<p>So each individual in a room, so as a leader,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only really interacting with a small number</p>
<p>of people because there are leaders</p>
<p>of other smaller groups and so on.</p>
<p>But each of those individuals in the room</p>
<p>have their own different psychology.</p>
<p>Some like to be pushed to the limit.</p>
<p>Some like to be screamed at.</p>
<p>Some are very soft spoken and almost afraid to speak.</p>
<p>And they have to be, you have to hear them out.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a, and those could be all superstars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about like the C students.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the A plus students.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny that, yeah, but the thing to,</p>
<p>the skill to manage all of those people</p>
<p>is completely separate from the skill to innovate something.</p>
<p>I mean, not that they&rsquo;re not connected,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s funny how it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like, you know,</p>
<p>why do we have shitty representatives?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the thing that you do to get elected</p>
<p>has nothing to do with governance.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>But the great leaders have to have both skills.</p>
<p>So like you have to have the boldness of,</p>
<p>if you look at the great presidents through history,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s in a time of crisis is when they step up,</p>
<p>but they basically say, okay, stop this old way</p>
<p>that Congress works of this bickering,</p>
<p>of this like compromise bullshit.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a huge plan that costs billions of dollars</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s age, trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>no extra pork, no extra additions,</p>
<p>just like, here&rsquo;s a clear plan.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to build the best road network</p>
<p>the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to build some huge infrastructure project.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to revolutionize internet.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re going to, for coronavirus,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to build the largest like testing facility</p>
<p>the world has ever seen in terms of the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get everybody tested several times a day,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, huge projects and say,</p>
<p>fuck all this, the details that everybody&rsquo;s bickering about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to give everybody $2,000,</p>
<p>we can give everybody $3,000, like huge projects.</p>
<p>And at the same time, so that&rsquo;s the boldness</p>
<p>and the leadership and saying,</p>
<p>throw out all the bullshit of the past.</p>
<p>And at the same time, be able to get in the room</p>
<p>with the leaders of both parties</p>
<p>or for the powerful individuals</p>
<p>and smooth talk the shit out of them</p>
<p>in the way they need to be smooth talked to.</p>
<p>So like both of those skills,</p>
<p>it seems to be when they&rsquo;re combining one person,</p>
<p>that creates great leaders.</p>
<p>Musk appears to have that, Elon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Steve Jobs, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So the criticism of Steve and a little bit on Elon</p>
<p>is he misses some of the human part,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s impossible to have a really,</p>
<p>you have like Sadia Nadal, who&rsquo;s the CEO of Microsoft,</p>
<p>you have, who&rsquo;s really good on the human side,</p>
<p>really, really good on the human side,</p>
<p>like everybody loves him.</p>
<p>The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible to have both.</p>
<p>You only get so many stat points.</p>
<p>Yeah, you only get, in this RPG of life, yeah.</p>
<p>You got very good at jujitsu very fast.</p>
<p>So you went, I mean, you told the story of Blue Belt</p>
<p>and so on, but you went to Black Belt really quickly</p>
<p>and not just in terms of ranks,</p>
<p>but in terms of just skill level.</p>
<p>I mean, you didn&rsquo;t go to Black Belt nearly as fast</p>
<p>as your skill set developed.</p>
<p>You were like doing extremely well</p>
<p>at a high level of competition.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a good person to ask,</p>
<p>how does one get good at jujitsu?</p>
<p>We talked about solving problems at the elite level,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re a beginner at the martial arts,</p>
<p>how do you get good?</p>
<p>How much training should you do?</p>
<p>The very basic stuff, like how much training,</p>
<p>how much drilling, and then the mental stuff,</p>
<p>like where should your mind be?</p>
<p>How should you approach it from a mental perspective too?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you my perspective on this one.</p>
<p>I guess I would say I feel step one,</p>
<p>I feel lucky to have found a good training situation,</p>
<p>particularly for the time in where I was at.</p>
<p>And I drilled a ton.</p>
<p>I drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled.</p>
<p>And one thing that&rsquo;s really important to understand though,</p>
<p>is that I was able to, in a relatively brief period of years,</p>
<p>go from zero to reasonably good.</p>
<p>But I think I probably crammed more hours</p>
<p>in those small years than most people did training,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in two or three times the length.</p>
<p>So it may masquerade as something else other than it is.</p>
<p>I could say.</p>
<p>So you have to put in the hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around that.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>But what did you put in those hours?</p>
<p>So when you say drilling, can you break that apart</p>
<p>a little bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What does drilling look like?</p>
<p>Is there any recommendations you can put in?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Step one, I would say your choices matter.</p>
<p>I think one of the really important things</p>
<p>that I think we should consider about jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of junk in the system right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like jiu jitsu has exploded in terms of</p>
<p>the number of positions, techniques, strategies,</p>
<p>this, that, rule sets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool on the one hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s probably a just metric shit ton</p>
<p>of suboptimal things that are out there</p>
<p>that are being taught.</p>
<p>Myself included, I&rsquo;ve taught things that are looking back</p>
<p>five years, three years, two years, one year,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, oh, I would not do it like that anymore.</p>
<p>Straight up, sometimes I wouldn&rsquo;t do it like that.</p>
<p>Other times I would literally never do</p>
<p>even that particular movement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the shrimp is a real move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant spiel and seizure to show in person.</p>
<p>But long story short, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that we think of as fundamental</p>
<p>that I think that are really pretty negative.</p>
<p>And also, you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heresy in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The shrimp.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Is like the holy, we all worship the shrimp.</p>
<p>We love the shrimp.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t do jiu jitsu, and you should,</p>
<p>the shrimp is you scoot your butt away from your opponent.</p>
<p>Yeah, in a really, it&rsquo;s like a really athletic</p>
<p>looking position where you look like someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to stick their butt out on Instagram,</p>
<p>and then you push your hands away,</p>
<p>and you expose your face,</p>
<p>and then you lay on your side</p>
<p>because someone told you to do that.</p>
<p>And you look like a, I guess you look like a shrimp.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like that time that someone really credible</p>
<p>told me to drink unleaded gasoline,</p>
<p>and I did it for a while.</p>
<p>And then it got to the point in my life</p>
<p>where the next best, the thing that I needed to do</p>
<p>to really improve my life was stop drinking</p>
<p>unleaded gasoline.</p>
<p>And I would say that there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in there that step one is like it&rsquo;s junk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actual junk.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only will it waste your time,</p>
<p>it will straight up, it will be like an albatross</p>
<p>hanging on you because it affects how you think</p>
<p>about things going forward.</p>
<p>So although it was, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>like the operating assumptions that we work under</p>
<p>have a huge, huge, huge influence.</p>
<p>You mentioned like growing up in the United States</p>
<p>or this being a capitalist society, like woo, all right.</p>
<p>Now, of course I think that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know any different otherwise.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of times people go,</p>
<p>oh, communism is better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any books about it being better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t experienced it much myself either.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t dismiss it outright,</p>
<p>but I guess I would say it&rsquo;s a fundamentally</p>
<p>different operating system underpinning</p>
<p>and all of my choices, all of,</p>
<p>if I honestly believed in that thing,</p>
<p>many of my choices on a moment by moment,</p>
<p>on a day by day, and certainly on a lifetime basis</p>
<p>would be very different.</p>
<p>So I would say that it&rsquo;s tough when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>in the martial arts.</p>
<p>And I mean, all of us are always trying to do</p>
<p>our best to learn.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re young in the martial arts,</p>
<p>you always go, if you&rsquo;re a reasonable guy,</p>
<p>what do they, what do they call it?</p>
<p>Like Dunning, Kruger, Amnesia.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if this is the right one,</p>
<p>but basically you go like, oh, I know what I&rsquo;m doing here.</p>
<p>So I can say that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>But then I read a news story about baseball</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know anything about baseball, sounds credible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s bullshit, but I can&rsquo;t call bullshit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a reasonable person,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t call bullshit on things that you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Even if you suspect it&rsquo;s not right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, well, I&rsquo;ve got to reserve judgment.</p>
<p>You never, ever, ever set aside your need</p>
<p>and also obligation to understand why you were doing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t ask why once, ask why over and over and over</p>
<p>and over about the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I want a shrimp.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To make space.</p>
<p>Why do I want to make space?</p>
<p>To get away from the guy.</p>
<p>Well, why do I want to get away from him?</p>
<p>Well, because he&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Well, why is he dangerous?</p>
<p>And you can oftentimes get down to, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even need to move.</p>
<p>Three quarters of the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually acting in the other person&rsquo;s self interest.</p>
<p>And I guess a lot of times I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this kind of goes beyond what we can demonstrate here.</p>
<p>But I would just say trying to understand</p>
<p>what my base operating assumptions are</p>
<p>and consistently reevaluate them,</p>
<p>which can be fricking exhausting, frankly,</p>
<p>and also constantly confidence destroying.</p>
<p>But you mentioned that I did pretty well</p>
<p>relatively quickly.</p>
<p>I started in 2004 and I was at Abu Dhabi ADCC</p>
<p>for the first time as an alternate in 2007.</p>
<p>I won a match there against a Black Belt world champion.</p>
<p>And the fact, frankly, the fact that I was able</p>
<p>to beat someone like that was neat,</p>
<p>but at the same time says a little bit more</p>
<p>about what jiu jitsu is and some of the issues with it</p>
<p>than it does about how cool I am or was,</p>
<p>because that shouldn&rsquo;t really happen</p>
<p>when you think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, you&rsquo;re a champion at ostensibly</p>
<p>a very high level of the sport.</p>
<p>You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage</p>
<p>and a 35 pound weight advantage, and you just got beat.</p>
<p>Like that should not, I&rsquo;m dead serious,</p>
<p>that should not exist.</p>
<p>If that happens, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Is it that I&rsquo;m doing it right?</p>
<p>Or is it that you&rsquo;re doing it wrong</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enough variance in the way that you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re allowing me to win?</p>
<p>And now I did happen to win that with the 50, 50 heel hook,</p>
<p>which was 50, 50, but basically,</p>
<p>which was one of the early examples of like,</p>
<p>hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs.</p>
<p>And that was something like, we mentioned John Danaher,</p>
<p>mentioned like, you know, myself, Dean Lister,</p>
<p>a lot of the guys from the Henzo Gracie team</p>
<p>that have had amazing success.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gone and done great things.</p>
<p>And you know, Craig Jones in the competitive grappling world,</p>
<p>basically taking advantage of being very, very good</p>
<p>in what they&rsquo;re doing, but also a glaring, glaring,</p>
<p>glaring issue with the operating system of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>which was, you know, a huge vulnerability in the lower body</p>
<p>and not only not attacking it,</p>
<p>but having no idea how one does attack it,</p>
<p>which means you can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how someone will assail you.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess to come back is if in the absence</p>
<p>of knowing what to do, I try to polish what I&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;ve got a knife and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to use them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna sharpen the edge</p>
<p>and polish it and make sure that when I need</p>
<p>to use this dang thing, I&rsquo;ll be able to do it.</p>
<p>Because trying to put together a system</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have an idea of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>a lot of times you end up making suboptimal choices,</p>
<p>but as long as you&rsquo;re consistently reevaluating</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>to do over time, over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and try to seek out the most, the best,</p>
<p>and also most articulate or insightful instructors</p>
<p>or people of various levels, doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>well known or not, that could say, hey, Ryan,</p>
<p>I think you should do this, I think you should do that.</p>
<p>And I think all I&rsquo;ve ever done in martial arts</p>
<p>is try to treat people with respect, honestly,</p>
<p>try to demonstrate appreciation for the many,</p>
<p>many people who have helped me over time</p>
<p>and be the type of person that they wanna train with.</p>
<p>Not the type of, because we&rsquo;ve all trained with people</p>
<p>that make us think about beating the ever loving crap.</p>
<p>I never wanted to be that guy.</p>
<p>And I was basically saying like, if I train</p>
<p>with a black belt when I&rsquo;m a blue belt</p>
<p>and this person enjoys training with me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in my interest.</p>
<p>Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up,</p>
<p>but selfishly, I should, you mentioned being decent</p>
<p>to other people, you wanna incentivize being decent</p>
<p>to other people, right, with a structure</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Selfishly, I&rsquo;m incentivized to be a nice guy,</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;m internally a scumbag,</p>
<p>which I like to think that I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>but basically going like, hey, this guy&rsquo;s way more likely</p>
<p>to help me or this person&rsquo;s way more likely to help me</p>
<p>if I shake their hand, say thank you,</p>
<p>I really appreciate you helping me out.</p>
<p>And that thing that they tap me with four or five times,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask them about it.</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t have to tell me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re under no obligation, but I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>and whether they tell me or don&rsquo;t tell me,</p>
<p>thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, so to summarize, the way you brilliantly described,</p>
<p>I just wanna make sure we&rsquo;re keeping track of this.</p>
<p>I went all over the place.</p>
<p>No, you didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re pretty on point.</p>
<p>But so the first thing is basically, which is difficult,</p>
<p>I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit,</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t trust authority, essentially.</p>
<p>Keep asking why.</p>
<p>Be respectful without trusting authority, right?</p>
<p>Right, which is, and then the second thing</p>
<p>is be the kind of person that others like training with</p>
<p>or like being around, sort of being a good friend.</p>
<p>So so many people just enjoy being around.</p>
<p>So one is completely, which is, yeah, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s attention, which is like completely disrespect</p>
<p>the way that things are done.</p>
<p>So asking why constantly.</p>
<p>One of it is your own flaws and not understanding</p>
<p>the fundamentals of what&rsquo;s being described.</p>
<p>And then once you get good enough,</p>
<p>not understanding, like going against the fact</p>
<p>that the instructor doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And my inability to understand what you&rsquo;re saying, though,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t invalidate it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something like you mentioned,</p>
<p>like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws.</p>
<p>And then also, again, the flaws that any of us have</p>
<p>is the instructor, to your point.</p>
<p>And I guess I can speak to being kind of weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I like to sit in the corner.</p>
<p>But so everyone&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>Some people, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t terribly popular</p>
<p>in high school.</p>
<p>You know, like, I didn&rsquo;t like high school very much.</p>
<p>But anyway, I would, not gonna be rude to people, though.</p>
<p>I was never gonna bully anybody.</p>
<p>If you said hello to me, I&rsquo;d say hello back.</p>
<p>I would hold the door for you if you walked by.</p>
<p>You know, and I would just say, like simple things like that</p>
<p>go a long, long, long way.</p>
<p>And that actually takes us back to our social discussion</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, oh man, how do I become great at jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;ll start by not pissing off this person</p>
<p>who can beat the crap out of me</p>
<p>and not disrespecting the person who is probably</p>
<p>the closest thing to a font of knowledge</p>
<p>at that time for me.</p>
<p>So, and then recognizing that I should do that</p>
<p>for its own virtue because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do</p>
<p>and I should try to treat people decently.</p>
<p>But beyond that, even selfishly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in my interest to do that.</p>
<p>But see, the thing is, this is interesting,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a culture in martial arts,</p>
<p>a culture that I like where the instructor,</p>
<p>legitimately so, carries an aura of authority.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not comfortable to really ask why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, it&rsquo;s a skill to be able to have a discussion</p>
<p>as a white belt or the black belt instructor</p>
<p>of like, why is it done this way?</p>
<p>Like, and saying why again.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s a skill to show that you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>a legitimately curious and passionate and compassionate</p>
<p>student versus like, somebody who&rsquo;s just being</p>
<p>an annoying dick who saw some stuff on YouTube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line between, to walk there.</p>
<p>I just wonder because like, it&rsquo;s the drilling thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, I, for example, like in my,</p>
<p>when I was coming out, there was so much emphasis</p>
<p>placed on like, close guard, for example.</p>
<p>And you might actually teach me now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but to me it was like,</p>
<p>why do I need to master the close guard?</p>
<p>Like, why is the close guard on top or the bottom?</p>
<p>But the bottom really, the fundamental basics of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Who decided that?</p>
<p>My body is not, my body says this is wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this, like I have short legs,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t even matter the length of the legs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about me that just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how leverage here works</p>
<p>for my particular body.</p>
<p>Like, so it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a feel thing too.</p>
<p>Like, it feels like in my basic understanding</p>
<p>of leverage and movement and timing and so on,</p>
<p>it feels like these certain, like butterfly guard,</p>
<p>or even like half, basically every guard except close guard.</p>
<p>I can play, I can dance.</p>
<p>Close guard feels like you&rsquo;re shutting down</p>
<p>like the play that I.</p>
<p>Is that wrong?</p>
<p>Or is that, make sure that&rsquo;s what you want</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s almost like an innate characteristic</p>
<p>of this guard position, but it&rsquo;s not sold that way, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, this is a good guard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey man, here&rsquo;s a bow and arrow versus,</p>
<p>and you know how to use this thing, right?</p>
<p>Like make sure you&rsquo;re far away</p>
<p>and like up on a hill or something.</p>
<p>Cause you can take that bow and arrow,</p>
<p>run up on something and try to use it.</p>
<p>But if nobody told you not to do that</p>
<p>and they told you it was foundational,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very foundational, it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>To everything else too, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s back to the shrimping thing.</p>
<p>How many things are we taught that even if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say itself is not a garbage thing,</p>
<p>might be effectively garbage.</p>
<p>You could give me a Ferrari,</p>
<p>but if I try to make it fly, it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, here&rsquo;s a plane, here&rsquo;s another plane,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another plane, here&rsquo;s another plane, here&rsquo;s a Ferrari.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, it must be a different type of plane.</p>
<p>Like you could be forgiven for leap if we&rsquo;re going there,</p>
<p>you know, like, oh, maybe the wings come out</p>
<p>or you just go fast enough to take a bullet.</p>
<p>You can make these crazy leaps in your mind.</p>
<p>And people are doing that all the time.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t provide the context for me,</p>
<p>or worse yet, you provide improper context,</p>
<p>like how much of a problem is that going to be?</p>
<p>Well, I think the skill of the white belt should be,</p>
<p>just be nice.</p>
<p>But in the complicated human space of when your intention,</p>
<p>at least in the big picture view, is good.</p>
<p>The question is, it&rsquo;s not always when your intention is good,</p>
<p>the actual implementation of it is good.</p>
<p>So you might be just almost,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s much, it&rsquo;s not the case for you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more the case for white belts.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even know, their intention might be good,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know all the lines they&rsquo;re crossing,</p>
<p>all the, so they&rsquo;re not actually able to like interpret</p>
<p>all the ways in which they&rsquo;re being totally insensitive</p>
<p>to the requests of others, like explicit requests of others.</p>
<p>So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener</p>
<p>of those social cues.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like a visitor in a foreign country, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re a representative of people</p>
<p>that look like you, people that talk like you,</p>
<p>people that have your passport,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, man, I&rsquo;m going to go over here.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve got my foot up on my knee.</p>
<p>Well, if I was in certain countries in the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>But can you imagine if someone says,</p>
<p>hey, I really appreciate if you take your foot off,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty rude.</p>
<p>And then I want to tell them, well, not where I&rsquo;m from, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in your house.</p>
<p>I better, again, I might go that direction,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say I could get away with that.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a bully.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t get away with that,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m about to maybe be on the wrong side of something.</p>
<p>But I guess, like you said,</p>
<p>if we have positive intention, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I also have to recognize who I am.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s one thing that I tried to do</p>
<p>and continue to try to do over time.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re, oh man, hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one that&rsquo;s asking for a favor here.</p>
<p>If I spar with Raymond Daniels,</p>
<p>Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t doing him a favor.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get it twisted.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>And this is not like some effected nonsense.</p>
<p>This is serious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, thank you.</p>
<p>If I spar with Steven Thompson,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one being done a favor.</p>
<p>George St. Pierre takes his time to spar with me,</p>
<p>which he has in the past and not even kill me,</p>
<p>which is really, I appreciate that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why I can sit here.</p>
<p>George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off</p>
<p>or see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;m going to do that</p>
<p>and then expect him to just take it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen, he&rsquo;s a gentleman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people get nuts with George</p>
<p>and have him just be like, he&rsquo;s a patient of a saint.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that level of patience,</p>
<p>but I would just say to come back,</p>
<p>figuring out like, hey, so what role am I here?</p>
<p>And that comes back to like,</p>
<p>at least what I see people on the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, no, you don&rsquo;t, Ryan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re some goof.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m some random dude.</p>
<p>Joe, like people want to,</p>
<p>they almost want to like elevate</p>
<p>so that we can somehow be level with peers here.</p>
<p>If I go into Feroz Zahabi&rsquo;s gym,</p>
<p>I am not a peer of Feroz Zahabi.</p>
<p>I am a student of TriStar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guest in the academy.</p>
<p>And if Feroz asked me for something short of him,</p>
<p>like telling me to try to do a triple backflip</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t break my neck,</p>
<p>the answer is yes, sir, I can do a free Feroz.</p>
<p>No, man, in no words.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and hopefully it should come with,</p>
<p>I guess, a level of graciousness,</p>
<p>but I guess that&rsquo;s kind of one of the things</p>
<p>that I see nowadays with how accessible people are.</p>
<p>Cause I grew up, you know, being a big,</p>
<p>huge baseball sports fan of all kinds.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t send Derek Jeter a message</p>
<p>and much less have a possibility of a reply.</p>
<p>And if I do, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>I have people send me messages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice that people send me messages.</p>
<p>Some people, again, and everyone,</p>
<p>not everyone is coming from the same place,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had plenty of things that are like,</p>
<p>yo, dude, I need you to do this for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p>That I have no idea who you are.</p>
<p>And that was how I was addressed.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t need, oh man, you&rsquo;re the greatest one</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s weird and too, cause I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>but just, hey Ryan, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Hey, do you think you could do the following</p>
<p>if you get a second?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, if I get a second, you&rsquo;re dang right I can.</p>
<p>Why not? It&rsquo;s easy to ask.</p>
<p>But it started with some level of politeness.</p>
<p>And I guess like that&rsquo;s maybe being semi Southern,</p>
<p>like I grew up in Virginia.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Yes, ma&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>Like that goes a long way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all different kinds</p>
<p>of implementations of politeness.</p>
<p>I mean, most of the successful people I&rsquo;ve met,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been surprising to me how much of,</p>
<p>you mentioned peers, like I could think of Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>You mentioned Joe Rogan, but Elon Musk,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t, like they almost treat me like I&rsquo;m the superior.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not even, that&rsquo;s the politeness.</p>
<p>Like, you know, that&rsquo;s the approach.</p>
<p>The feeling of it is like, I&rsquo;m the student,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the beginner, I&rsquo;m like approaching the situation.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s almost like a method acting of like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better than me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I approach a lot of interactions.</p>
<p>Like I have something to learn from this,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s like a young.</p>
<p>Do you think that they&rsquo;re ungenuine?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re totally genuine.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that a funny thing?</p>
<p>Like in spite of who they are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incredibly genuine because they respect,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, they respect you obviously</p>
<p>for what you bring to the table.</p>
<p>They also approach.</p>
<p>No, no, they approach everybody like this.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m sure they respect for what you bring to the table.</p>
<p>Beyond that though, they&rsquo;re treating you</p>
<p>with dignity as a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a human being, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And when they could probably get away</p>
<p>with treating most people</p>
<p>without a whole heck of a lot of dignity.</p>
<p>And I guess what does that always say that like, you know,</p>
<p>again, like you can always tell someone of quality</p>
<p>because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing a lot.</p>
<p>Like, I guess I don&rsquo;t mean to like to nitpick,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where it would take issue, I guess a little bit,</p>
<p>or disagree with the next.</p>
<p>Are you gonna criticize with the internet again?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>People on the internet.</p>
<p>Old man yells at clouds.</p>
<p>But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like</p>
<p>the way that people address each other</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so casual now, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great on the one hand, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you go, hey, I just, why can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>am I somehow, am I worried about diminishing myself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the way that I&rsquo;m sure that people talk to like,</p>
<p>talk to women sometimes.</p>
<p>And words, what&rsquo;s up girl?</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s a bitch.</p>
<p>You know, versus like, how am I,</p>
<p>that was supposed to get a good response?</p>
<p>What about that was going to elicit a favorable response?</p>
<p>You know, versus being anything, anything other than just,</p>
<p>you know, man, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And I guess that, does that make any sense?</p>
<p>It makes total sense.</p>
<p>And that Southern thing that you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s an important,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an important part of human communication.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a new back attacks instructional.</p>
<p>First of all, awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Second of all, you drop a lot of fascinating insights</p>
<p>in there, but you quote Galileo out of all people</p>
<p>in saying that you can&rsquo;t teach a man anything.</p>
<p>You can only help him find it within himself.</p>
<p>So we talked about how to start in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>What about if we zoom out even more</p>
<p>and how do you learn how to learn?</p>
<p>How do you optimize the learning process?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that,</p>
<p>but I can tell you what I&rsquo;d like to do.</p>
<p>And I would say like, I can&rsquo;t step one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not, maybe this is a little bit easier for me</p>
<p>cause you know, I&rsquo;ve never had a ton of friends, honestly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, I&rsquo;ve got my close friends</p>
<p>and people that I know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never had tons and tons of people.</p>
<p>So I spent a lot of time, you know, thinking.</p>
<p>And anyway, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t control you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control anybody else.</p>
<p>I, you know, I, all I can,</p>
<p>I want to take my, it&rsquo;s a Marcus Aurelius thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, I guess the trick to life</p>
<p>is figuring out what&rsquo;s in our control and what&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and focusing on things that are in our control, I guess.</p>
<p>And so step one is figuring out both internally</p>
<p>and then also out in the world as it pertains to Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>what is actually in my control and what is not.</p>
<p>Like passing someone&rsquo;s guard is not in your control.</p>
<p>People think it is, it ain&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t just do an activity and be unchecked,</p>
<p>then it ain&rsquo;t in my control entirely.</p>
<p>I can always breathe.</p>
<p>I can always, you know, be calm.</p>
<p>I can always, no matter whether I&rsquo;m concerned</p>
<p>or not concerned, have whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>nerves, you know, I can step forward across the line</p>
<p>and say, I will, I will face the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>That is all entirely, no one can stop me from doing that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s entirely in my control.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I know that every single time</p>
<p>that I walk into the ring,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll walk in and out of there with my head held high</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s, I will fight with everything that I have.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t promise that I&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>I would say I take that same first principles.</p>
<p>You mentioned last time we talked, you know,</p>
<p>with Elon and the importance of that and going,</p>
<p>what are the first principles?</p>
<p>And I guess to come back a lot of times, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the things that people think are the basics</p>
<p>are not the basics.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>If you think you&rsquo;re reasoning for first principles,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually like level six,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually like layers up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making so many,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many baked in assumptions to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna struggle to understand</p>
<p>why anything is actually happening,</p>
<p>internally, externally, you name it.</p>
<p>So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning</p>
<p>is first principles and trying to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, but then also simple things first.</p>
<p>I can control my posture.</p>
<p>I can control my breathing.</p>
<p>No one can stop me from doing that.</p>
<p>I can control where I place my frames.</p>
<p>I can control where I place my limbs.</p>
<p>I can move my feet.</p>
<p>I can develop the ability to do these things</p>
<p>better, of course.</p>
<p>And I do that through practice, through drilling,</p>
<p>through watching people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts</p>
<p>to train with many of my heroes,</p>
<p>to train with many of the people that I looked at.</p>
<p>And I was like, that guy is amazing.</p>
<p>I wanna train with this person, like Stephen Thompson,</p>
<p>Kenny Florian, George St. Pierre, Raymond Daniels,</p>
<p>Farah Zahabi, you know, I mean, like Bruno Frazada,</p>
<p>Marcelo Garcia, you know, all of these guys</p>
<p>that are just unbelievable.</p>
<p>And I go, well, they&rsquo;re moving in a way that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Well, how do I do that?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes you can ask them</p>
<p>and they can tell you directly.</p>
<p>Other times, people, part of the genius of what they do</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s intuitive.</p>
<p>And maybe they don&rsquo;t think and understand</p>
<p>and see the world the same way that I do.</p>
<p>That was something that I experienced with Marcelo.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But in a different way than his,</p>
<p>it just, we see things fundamentally different.</p>
<p>We experience the world differently.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we do.</p>
<p>And again, that taught me a really important lesson</p>
<p>because I was wanting, when I trained there,</p>
<p>to have someone go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this,</p>
<p>and this, and that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, because that&rsquo;s how I understood</p>
<p>martial arts at the time.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t ready to have someone tell me, like, hey,</p>
<p>it feels a little bit like this, and I just kind of do it,</p>
<p>which is kind of what Marcelo would do at the time.</p>
<p>He was less experienced as a teacher,</p>
<p>but that is what he was doing.</p>
<p>I was completely, I couldn&rsquo;t separate in my mind</p>
<p>performance and understanding.</p>
<p>I thought that if I understand, I could do it.</p>
<p>And I would also struggle sometimes</p>
<p>to wonder why I couldn&rsquo;t execute things</p>
<p>that I thought I understood,</p>
<p>and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.</p>
<p>I mean, in like the, like lightning, wind,</p>
<p>like that type of thing where like, it&rsquo;s just so in touch</p>
<p>with what they wanted, with their capabilities.</p>
<p>They could summon their powers at will.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t always do that.</p>
<p>And I guess, so recognizing that there was more than one way</p>
<p>to the top of the mountain, and also I had a lot of science,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of art, or I had some science,</p>
<p>I should say, but I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of art.</p>
<p>Meeting people like Marcelo taught me,</p>
<p>and then Josh Waitzkin, actually brilliant guy,</p>
<p>chess champion, former owner,</p>
<p>maybe owner of Marcelo&rsquo;s Academy, really great friend.</p>
<p>I think he has a book on learning.</p>
<p>He does, yeah, The Art of Learning, actually.</p>
<p>But yeah, he knows a thing or two about it,</p>
<p>but a great guy.</p>
<p>And anyway, he sat me down one time,</p>
<p>and was like, look, man, you&rsquo;re doing this wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing what the, missing the genius,</p>
<p>the brilliance that&rsquo;s right in front of you.</p>
<p>And it took me a long time.</p>
<p>What did he mean exactly?</p>
<p>I was frustrated with my inability</p>
<p>to grasp certain things,</p>
<p>and sometimes the teaching style being different.</p>
<p>Not wrong, just it was, it was tough on me at times.</p>
<p>So you were trying to replicate what Marcelo was saying</p>
<p>as opposed to understanding the fundamentals</p>
<p>from which it was coming.</p>
<p>Right, I couldn&rsquo;t see, I couldn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>where it was coming from.</p>
<p>And also, sometimes I&rsquo;m like, well,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you explain it in the way</p>
<p>that I would want you to explain it?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, why can&rsquo;t I meet him</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s coming from?</p>
<p>So anyway, it was a really important time,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m very, very frustrating if I&rsquo;m honest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m so thankful for that time.</p>
<p>And anyway, you know, I guess.</p>
<p>So always first principles,</p>
<p>trying to understand the basics,</p>
<p>first starting at the place where you can control things,</p>
<p>the very basic elements of what you can work with.</p>
<p>And then when there&rsquo;s other mentors and teachers to.</p>
<p>Meet them where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>To the extent that I can.</p>
<p>Rather than, I&rsquo;m not, like, again, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why are you not talking to me</p>
<p>the way I want you to talk to me?</p>
<p>As opposed to, hey, where are you coming from?</p>
<p>Back to your point.</p>
<p>But I know that&rsquo;s not entirely specific,</p>
<p>but you know, like, if you can focus on that</p>
<p>and back to the whole, you can&rsquo;t teach a man anything.</p>
<p>Marcelo didn&rsquo;t teach me anything,</p>
<p>but he taught me in so doing, like,</p>
<p>and other people like that, to find it within.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I guess something else</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard before is that all learning is self discovery,</p>
<p>but all performance is self expression.</p>
<p>And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master</p>
<p>of letting what&rsquo;s inside out.</p>
<p>He was so consistent in his performances.</p>
<p>And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there</p>
<p>personally, particularly at the end of Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>when I was very, very results oriented.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t, I think my focus was not ideal.</p>
<p>It was definitely not in the place</p>
<p>that I would like it to be.</p>
<p>And whether it would have won more or lost more,</p>
<p>hard to say, but I know that I would have performed better</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d have adjusted that.</p>
<p>And anyway, that recognizing that, again, Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve said it before, Jiu Jitsu studies is a science,</p>
<p>but expressed as an art.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can articulate</p>
<p>what you know how to do.</p>
<p>What matters is if you can do what you know how to do.</p>
<p>It only matters if you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>I guess if you&rsquo;re teaching in a verbal fashion</p>
<p>is whether or not you can articulate it,</p>
<p>but recognizing the difference between learning</p>
<p>on an intellectual level or conceptual level</p>
<p>and being able to translate that into the physical.</p>
<p>And I guess like that&rsquo;s been the thing</p>
<p>that I feel like fortunate over time in my own academy</p>
<p>to be able to kind of fiddle around and learn on my own</p>
<p>and practice with my students.</p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes I struggle</p>
<p>to have great training partners.</p>
<p>Like when I say great training partner,</p>
<p>I mean, other world class people to spar, to roll with,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot more, honestly,</p>
<p>than I ever would have thought</p>
<p>out of being able to practice and learn and fail and try</p>
<p>and succeed on my own without like my own little sandbox,</p>
<p>figuring out how I can take an idea</p>
<p>and then come up with drills and drills to practice it</p>
<p>so that I can actually practice putting it into play.</p>
<p>Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll never see the light of day.</p>
<p>So in that DVD, in that instruction DVD, sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an online instructional DVD.</p>
<p>I keep saying DVD though.</p>
<p>Nobody has DVDs anymore.</p>
<p>Do they not? It&rsquo;s like VHS.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Who has DVDs?</p>
<p>What, like Blu Ray?</p>
<p>I possess some DVDs.</p>
<p>I mean, like I&rsquo;ve never watched them.</p>
<p>What do you use them for?</p>
<p>Like a cup, like a thing you put a drink on?</p>
<p>I mean, in a pinch, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that even called?</p>
<p>Coaster?</p>
<p>Yeah, my matrix coaster.</p>
<p>The matrix coaster, zeros and ones.</p>
<p>Okay, so in that instruction that people should get,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t even know when it came out recently, right?</p>
<p>Like December or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s part one.</p>
<p>It was actually like ended up being like 18 hours long</p>
<p>and I was like, oh my God, we gotta chop it in half.</p>
<p>And when it comes together, the whole thing,</p>
<p>I think I hope people will like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well it&rsquo;s even part one is really good.</p>
<p>Yeah, people on Reddit were really excited</p>
<p>for part two as well.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And you also have a back.</p>
<p>Oh, the old one.</p>
<p>The old one that I, that was really helpful to me</p>
<p>to understand some very basic aspects of control</p>
<p>for the back.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few instructionals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few things I&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it.</p>
<p>It taught me one thing, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you drop a lot of sort of bombs,</p>
<p>you drop a lot of really interesting details</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny that there&rsquo;s only specific things</p>
<p>that really click.</p>
<p>Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s interesting, okay, yeah,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain things that really click.</p>
<p>And I remember when that first instruction</p>
<p>will click with me is like the importance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any more like how you communicated it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve now integrated, it&rsquo;s now mine,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But it was more about you just describing upper body control</p>
<p>and the importance of the upper body control from the back.</p>
<p>And just like the, there&rsquo;s certain grip,</p>
<p>like you did describe different details on the grips</p>
<p>and so on and as I started trying it,</p>
<p>I realized how important upper body control is</p>
<p>versus like me maybe as a blue belt or something</p>
<p>was I thought like you have achieved victory</p>
<p>when you got the two hooks in.</p>
<p>And then I realized like at least for me</p>
<p>that the hooks were not even for my body type,</p>
<p>for my style, for the way I approach things,</p>
<p>they were not even important at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supplemental for the most part, yeah.</p>
<p>So they were there for the points</p>
<p>but I can establish a huge amount of control.</p>
<p>In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about</p>
<p>like illusion of choice, it almost made people panic</p>
<p>a lot more when you were like fighting for it</p>
<p>or establishing that kind of control.</p>
<p>They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>involved even though they should be a lot more panicked.</p>
<p>Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things,</p>
<p>especially that had to do with judo because so much</p>
<p>of judo on the ground is centered around aggressive,</p>
<p>efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds</p>
<p>of clock chokes and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start</p>
<p>to make its way into jiu jitsu coming up</p>
<p>but like the judo style approach to like clock choking,</p>
<p>triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff,</p>
<p>so powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s something about judo that emphasizes</p>
<p>obviously due to the rules, the urgency.</p>
<p>So you only do techniques that go fast.</p>
<p>And then the other thing is, which I guess</p>
<p>jiu jitsu emphasizes too but judo really does,</p>
<p>which is the transition.</p>
<p>So like while the person&rsquo;s flying in the air</p>
<p>is the easiest time.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit,</p>
<p>which is like, why not put in your submissions</p>
<p>or positional control while they&rsquo;re in the air?</p>
<p>If you could, why would you not, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, well, I don&rsquo;t throw well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll learn how to throw and then do it.</p>
<p>And so you should think, I mean, in the transition,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re flying is the easiest time to put in stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you think about chokes,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re throwing, you should be thinking about the choke</p>
<p>and then everything becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p>You ever see Flabio Canto?</p>
<p>Man, Brazilian judoka is just so cool.</p>
<p>Like with stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, but that has to do</p>
<p>with the first starting principle of like,</p>
<p>stop thinking this as a two phase game</p>
<p>of standing and then ground.</p>
<p>Start thinking about like the standing and the,</p>
<p>the standing comes before and the ground comes after,</p>
<p>but everything happens in a transition.</p>
<p>Well, unless you&rsquo;re attacking, what is the art of war?</p>
<p>Like, we all like, everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, the art of war, oh yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And then they immediately throw it away</p>
<p>and then fight like a fricking barbarian.</p>
<p>But, I mean like, I&rsquo;m serious,</p>
<p>but how many people quote stuff and then like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the, what is it, the family guy joke</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not listening to my work,</p>
<p>what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And anyway, basically, like the art of war,</p>
<p>one of the things that&rsquo;s like the only thing</p>
<p>that you can be sure of being successful in attacking</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s undefended.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But you know, in a fight though, they&rsquo;re defended.</p>
<p>Well, are they?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s moments all the time</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m borderline defenseless.</p>
<p>And if you were to attack at that moment,</p>
<p>if you could see it and then seize the moment,</p>
<p>if you were capable of both,</p>
<p>you should not only expect to be successful,</p>
<p>you should be damn sure you&rsquo;re gonna be successful.</p>
<p>And more important than that, you&rsquo;ll be successful.</p>
<p>And even if somehow not, you won&rsquo;t be countered.</p>
<p>And I guess like, that&rsquo;s the trick</p>
<p>of almost all like conflict, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like showing up when the other person&rsquo;s taking a nap.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s so funny, like we take like a protracted war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it takes five years.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lulls and there&rsquo;s a battle this month,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a couple of weeks, another battle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, if you just shrink that down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the microcosm, macrocosm idea.</p>
<p>That same thing, that whole war is taking place</p>
<p>in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s moments of lulls of person effectively</p>
<p>going for a snack, being like in a horror movie,</p>
<p>like, hey guys, I&rsquo;m gonna go get a beer from around the way.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m dead for sure.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>Is there, on this particular instructional,</p>
<p>if you can convert it to words,</p>
<p>you talk about finishing the submission.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting insights</p>
<p>that you find beautiful or profound</p>
<p>about finishing the rear neck and choke</p>
<p>or just finishing the submissions for the back control?</p>
<p>Is there something like, you know,</p>
<p>you talk about the squeeze and the crush</p>
<p>and all these kinds of principles.</p>
<p>Is there something about control</p>
<p>about the process of finishing</p>
<p>that you find especially profound about this position?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The opposite of one profound truth</p>
<p>can be another profound truth.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s, I do a.</p>
<p>Did Jesus say that?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t, I actually was a guy on Tumblr.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was really, really cool.</p>
<p>There was like a tree in the background.</p>
<p>But anyway, but so let&rsquo;s say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use examples.</p>
<p>Like first off, I saw someone finishing a 50, 50 heel hook</p>
<p>in the UFC one promo.</p>
<p>It was like some chubby dude in karate,</p>
<p>like inside heel hook and another dude.</p>
<p>And you go, huh?</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t know they were doing that back then at least.</p>
<p>And whether they were doing it all,</p>
<p>how many times did someone do something and then that works?</p>
<p>And then we go, okay, cool.</p>
<p>Versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time.</p>
<p>So anyway, how long were we all taught</p>
<p>to do the seatbelt the way we all do the seatbelt in jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>Like long time, why?</p>
<p>Works.</p>
<p>In fact, it works so well.</p>
<p>And it was so, it was then the people who used it</p>
<p>were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one.</p>
<p>Good to go.</p>
<p>All right, no more thinking.</p>
<p>And then you go, imagine you were to like the Merkel,</p>
<p>the Merkel flip, all those positions that were showing</p>
<p>in the DVD, which is pretty much,</p>
<p>or whatever the heck it is, the digital VD.</p>
<p>No, not VD, don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Digital video something.</p>
<p>But basically recognizing that doing it on the wrong side</p>
<p>is at least as effective.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that the other side wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>There could be something that&rsquo;s the literal</p>
<p>borderline opposite of that.</p>
<p>And you go, huh, well, that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Like imagine like, I would say almost all of these things,</p>
<p>all the tactics and all the strategies.</p>
<p>So I guess that was something that we came to</p>
<p>like training in the gym like a year ago, maybe,</p>
<p>and then playing with sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh wait, so let me get this straight.</p>
<p>First off, I can use my strong side seatbelt,</p>
<p>my right arm over the shoulder all the time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s really helpful</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a lot better than my left.</p>
<p>I can do both sides of my left,</p>
<p>but if I had to bet my life on being able to finish it,</p>
<p>I would want my right arm over.</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s a tactic or a strategy</p>
<p>evolved from an idea.</p>
<p>Like capitalism&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>Anarchy is an idea, and then it becomes,</p>
<p>well, what does that all mean?</p>
<p>What are the consequences?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fallout of all this, right?</p>
<p>So what if we start with jujitsu,</p>
<p>the idea of the guard, right?</p>
<p>And we go, well, I mean, why do you use the guard?</p>
<p>No other martial art really has developed the guard</p>
<p>in the same way that jujitsu has.</p>
<p>Well, what is the guard?</p>
<p>A guard&rsquo;s a defensive idea where you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>on your back to some extent or another,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using your legs as a wall between you</p>
<p>and the other person, and the other guy represents danger.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>I mean, it clearly works, at least to a certain extent,</p>
<p>but where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up?</p>
<p>Not on the other dude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to put them on things on the floor.</p>
<p>If I want to generate a ton of power,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the first thing I do with my feet?</p>
<p>I anchor them to the floor.</p>
<p>Drive for a punch, you name it.</p>
<p>Move away, jump, dart, you name it.</p>
<p>So does it mean that that&rsquo;s a terrible idea</p>
<p>to be on your back?</p>
<p>No, clearly it works.</p>
<p>And clearly it has function.</p>
<p>But what if the function that we&rsquo;re giving it</p>
<p>and how much focus we&rsquo;re assigning to it</p>
<p>is disproportionate to its effectiveness?</p>
<p>Maybe, what if it&rsquo;s not a good idea?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not a good idea, but what if it wasn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a foundational idea of jujitsu.</p>
<p>And then how much, because no one questions that foundation,</p>
<p>how much innovation is built on top of the idea?</p>
<p>Well, of course I want to be,</p>
<p>my being on my back is in okay position.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re innovating,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re innovating within a closed system</p>
<p>that they think they&rsquo;re innovating in this open space</p>
<p>of, oh my God, it can be anything,</p>
<p>when in reality it can be anything within this little set.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re in a set.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re in a box.</p>
<p>There would be answers that would become</p>
<p>so immediately apparent to you</p>
<p>if you were willing to look outside of that,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll literally never even look over to your left</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t even realize the left exists.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of places in jujitsu,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s back control or generally guards</p>
<p>and all the different positions,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of space,</p>
<p>like a lot to be discovered</p>
<p>by questioning the basic assumptions.</p>
<p>Maybe if you can give examples of like back control,</p>
<p>like, is there something you&rsquo;ve discovered that&rsquo;s like?</p>
<p>Merkle versus seatbelt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Merkle with seatbelt?</p>
<p>Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder,</p>
<p>left arm under the arm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the same side as my choking arm.</p>
<p>Merkle is just, I do the same thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even adjust my hands.</p>
<p>I walk myself over to the left side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the opposite side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a more powerful position.</p>
<p>Yeah, for people listening,</p>
<p>for people who might not know,</p>
<p>jujitsu is a, seatbelt is a control.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about when one person</p>
<p>is on the back of another person,</p>
<p>which is a really dominant position in jujitsu,</p>
<p>seatbelt is a, I guess, widely accepted way</p>
<p>of holding your arm.</p>
<p>Like best practices on those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Best practices, yeah, and it&rsquo;s worked so well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a one arm over, one arm under,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a certain side</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be on when you&rsquo;re on the back.</p>
<p>Everyone teaches, there&rsquo;s a choking arm,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the arm that&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>on a certain side relative to that.</p>
<p>And then Ryan is describing,</p>
<p>questioning these basic assumptions</p>
<p>of which side you&rsquo;re supposed to be on.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s even just like a mid level assumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a first principles assumption,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty close to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting there, but let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>for sake of argument, it goes a lot deeper, maybe.</p>
<p>I think most of the innovation that I see is not innovation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like basically changing the color of a car</p>
<p>or polishing like the window a little bit,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, hey, you made it,</p>
<p>you made it a little bit different,</p>
<p>you made it a little bit better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh man, what if I did the same guard</p>
<p>and then grab the lapel?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not fundamentally changing anything.</p>
<p>I think most of the big seismic shifts</p>
<p>that we see in almost anything come from,</p>
<p>hey, that thing we thought was right was wrong,</p>
<p>rather than not only is it right, it&rsquo;s even righter.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s not wrong, that&rsquo;s not bad,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, oh man, let&rsquo;s say, for instance,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make the triangle better,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say I made the triangle a little bit better</p>
<p>than it was, or than it was taught.</p>
<p>I mean, you can call it innovation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the person that said,</p>
<p>hey, have you guys ever heard of a triangle before</p>
<p>and came up with that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, that is, you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s on the list?</p>
<p>You can do this thing to people?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be like one punch man.</p>
<p>You can walk around and just lay low</p>
<p>every single person you got into a fight with,</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t even occur to them to hit you</p>
<p>with their back hand.</p>
<p>In a world full of jabbers, you throw your back hand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kill people.</p>
<p>So basically.</p>
<p>Well, but by the way, I mean, just to pause on that,</p>
<p>first of all, somebody did invent the triangle probably,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trivial thing once you think.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How many of these giant things that we all go like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we all use that now.</p>
<p>Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks</p>
<p>and rear naked chokes and I don&rsquo;t have those?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on beat, you&rsquo;re borderline, I mean, like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s, we all, every single one of this,</p>
<p>particularly those of us, I mean,</p>
<p>when did you first start training, Lex?</p>
<p>12, 13, well, let&rsquo;s not count wrestling,</p>
<p>but 13 years ago with Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Right on.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say about that time where particularly</p>
<p>it was still like kind of, kind of undergroundy,</p>
<p>you know, and you&rsquo;re like, hey, we all experienced</p>
<p>being like a relative, like a mid level white belt</p>
<p>and being able to easily beat up all our friends</p>
<p>because everyone wrestled other buddies.</p>
<p>And it was one of those ones where like,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have weapons to end the fight.</p>
<p>You have weapons to end the fight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s such a crazy, you know,</p>
<p>asymmetric advantage that if you lose, it&rsquo;s on you now, man.</p>
<p>Like, like you had the, next time it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this rifle and you have nothing.</p>
<p>And I decided to put it on my back and then run over</p>
<p>and try to karate chop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, next time,</p>
<p>just make sure you use the rifle, bud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, I should do that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to,</p>
<p>I mean, everything you&rsquo;re describing is a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fascinating tension between like,</p>
<p>whatever I show people for the first time,</p>
<p>what a triangle is, just like regular people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re discovering is like,</p>
<p>oh, okay, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, MMA has changed that,</p>
<p>but people haven&rsquo;t watched MMA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting move.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense why that would be a choke.</p>
<p>And they kind of quickly accepted that&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>and they accept the basics without questioning,</p>
<p>wait a minute, what&rsquo;s actually being choked?</p>
<p>How is it that a shoulder of a person</p>
<p>can do the choking?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not sure I fully question</p>
<p>the fundamentals of all of that.</p>
<p>Like, what exactly is the blood supply</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being cut off?</p>
<p>Like, what is the anatomy and the physiology</p>
<p>of all of that?</p>
<p>Why does this work?</p>
<p>And if you understood all that,</p>
<p>what else can we do here?</p>
<p>Yeah, what else can we do here?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really important thing.</p>
<p>But if we know, if I&rsquo;m an end user,</p>
<p>which almost everyone is of almost anything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious, where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I think about stuff in my life,</p>
<p>the only things I really think about</p>
<p>are like martial arts and martial arts strategy</p>
<p>and like, I don&rsquo;t know, some other couple,</p>
<p>a couple other things, but not much.</p>
<p>And anything else in my life is borderline unexamined.</p>
<p>And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort</p>
<p>in something, I&rsquo;d like to think that I could figure</p>
<p>at least some things out about it,</p>
<p>but I figured out almost nothing about anything in my life</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t even looked.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an end user, what are you capable of</p>
<p>versus you can literally alter the source code.</p>
<p>You are Neo in the fricking matrix,</p>
<p>if you can alter the code and I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we think, ah, ah, ah, ah,</p>
<p>but imagine you are a world class anything,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not even world class, forget it.</p>
<p>Like a purple belt compared to a white belt</p>
<p>or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones</p>
<p>or Marcelo Garcia, you&rsquo;re gonna beat them up comparably bad.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, that actually is a common thing</p>
<p>where people can&rsquo;t tell the difference between levels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh man, I&rsquo;ve trained</p>
<p>with my black belt instructor,</p>
<p>how much better could so and so be?</p>
<p>Like, so much better you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>wrapping your head around it.</p>
<p>I remember when I first trained with Marcelo Garcia in 2007,</p>
<p>I was a decent purple belt.</p>
<p>And of course he mollywopped me very gently.</p>
<p>And then training with him again in 2008,</p>
<p>I was definitely better.</p>
<p>I won the gi and no gi worlds that you&rsquo;re a purple belt.</p>
<p>So definitely for the record,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely not a jujitsu world champion.</p>
<p>I wanted the purple belt,</p>
<p>but like, that&rsquo;s not the same at winning a black belt</p>
<p>and a tough accomplishment,</p>
<p>but not in the same thing at all.</p>
<p>But anyway, I was definitely better.</p>
<p>He beat me up just the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, 2009, I was a lot better.</p>
<p>Got a medal at ADCC that time, won the trials,</p>
<p>crushed everybody, like no, just submitted everybody</p>
<p>like bop, bop, bop, bop.</p>
<p>Training with Marcelo Garcia, it was worse.</p>
<p>And in 2010, training with Marcelo Garcia, same, same.</p>
<p>So the idea was, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you</p>
<p>the difference and the outcome difference</p>
<p>was the same in all of these rounds.</p>
<p>I was significantly more experienced</p>
<p>and more adept each time that this occurred.</p>
<p>But it was like, how many number of times</p>
<p>did this person submit you or pass your guard in the round?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, probably like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say five each one,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be a brief period of time.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say it was three on one,</p>
<p>six on another, I&rsquo;m like, whatever, it&rsquo;s comparable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s six one and a half dozen.</p>
<p>Would I be able to easily tell the difference?</p>
<p>No, I would just say, I know in concept</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s way better, so much better.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s plenty of other people</p>
<p>that could have beaten me just as bad as Marcelo did</p>
<p>when I was a purple belt or when I was a brown belt.</p>
<p>Then maybe I would watch Marcelo walk through</p>
<p>like their borderline, not there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s neat.</p>
<p>Like if you, that&rsquo;s back to kind of what I was talking about</p>
<p>about certain people beginning to really like peel back</p>
<p>some of what&rsquo;s really special about the martial arts</p>
<p>or any activity I presume is they get to a level</p>
<p>of understanding in depth that they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>with like the almost the reality of that thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m playing by rules that are not rules.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even one of the, to use a matrix analogy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even an agent, which is the best version</p>
<p>of something playing by the rules.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like one of the regular people</p>
<p>or one of the regular people that got out of the matrix.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m cool, but when I fight an agent,</p>
<p>I lose because we&rsquo;re both in the rules,</p>
<p>but they just play them to the bone and I&rsquo;m just here.</p>
<p>Well, and then the agent encounters Neo</p>
<p>and they can do nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s operating outside of what the rules are,</p>
<p>but not really what the rules are,</p>
<p>what they perceive to be the rules are clearly.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess that&rsquo;s kind of my point</p>
<p>about Marcelo or certain other people</p>
<p>that are doing things where you go,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t even seem real.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem real to me</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And I guess if we can get down to base assumptions,</p>
<p>like if we can constantly strip away, strip away,</p>
<p>strip away, let&rsquo;s say we always thought</p>
<p>that turning left was right, was correct.</p>
<p>And it turns out that turning right was correct.</p>
<p>Change your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a, what is it, Socrates said,</p>
<p>the unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
<p>So you just basically have to rigorously</p>
<p>just constantly examine every assumption</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t that give your life meaning</p>
<p>to come back to the struggle,</p>
<p>to come back to free will, to come back to,</p>
<p>what if we could strip all that away?</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>All right, let me just stick the needle in my arm</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean that constant striving</p>
<p>for understanding yet another lower layer</p>
<p>of the simulation we&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s actually deeply fulfilling</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s genetically built in,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about that striving to understand</p>
<p>that seems to be deeply human.</p>
<p>Which is funny, what makes a human,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t talk about the soul anymore, man.</p>
<p>I went to Catholic school as a kid.</p>
<p>Whether you buy into all that stuff or not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, what about the soul of a person,</p>
<p>the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation,</p>
<p>anywhere, the spirit of humanity?</p>
<p>We talk about everything like it&rsquo;s this quantifiable thing</p>
<p>when maybe certain things are, maybe everything is,</p>
<p>but then what happens if there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>that just aren&rsquo;t quantifiable,</p>
<p>that nothing in our understanding can</p>
<p>or will ever explain it?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that that should be our assumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for your assumption that we can explain everything</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel.</p>
<p>But what if there is actually something</p>
<p>that we need challenge for?</p>
<p>And we could be looking in the wrong place</p>
<p>by going, oh, is it in the genes?</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re looking in the wrong place</p>
<p>like I would know anything, I do karate.</p>
<p>But basically, not even well.</p>
<p>But yeah, we do karate, mediocre,</p>
<p>just ask Raymond Daniels or Stephen Thompson.</p>
<p>But I guess to come back, though, you just.</p>
<p>Are you a yellow belt yet, or are you?</p>
<p>Man, I actually, have you ever seen the Seinfeld episode</p>
<p>where Kramer fights the kids?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels school</p>
<p>and the kids won in class in addition to the alleyway.</p>
<p>Oh, they finished it off afterwards.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, when I was on my last legs.</p>
<p>But yeah, I would just, maybe, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s something deeply missing</p>
<p>from public understanding anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the idea that we can figure everything out,</p>
<p>which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some things that we&rsquo;ll never really see</p>
<p>and some things we&rsquo;ll never understand.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something, like you said,</p>
<p>uniquely human about the human experience,</p>
<p>that even if I had the power to change,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna fuck with it, man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna change that thing.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, well, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great</p>
<p>if we just immediately knew the outcome of everything</p>
<p>and you just press this button, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s gonna, what&rsquo;s the point of living life then?</p>
<p>Even if you could do it, it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>Ian, you&rsquo;ve seen Jurassic Park, I&rsquo;ll leave you to be sorry,</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, right?</p>
<p>Life finds a way.</p>
<p>But we were so concerned with whether or not we could,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t stop to think whether or not we should.</p>
<p>Maybe?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s a deeply human thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a really useful thing</p>
<p>to always kind of assume that there&rsquo;s this giant thing</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So you can forever be striving to understand</p>
<p>because that process gives you meaning,</p>
<p>but also keeps making you better.</p>
<p>Like thinking that, actually even just thinking</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t understand everything</p>
<p>will lead you to stop too early.</p>
<p>So like, I think there&rsquo;s something to,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the soul or whether it&rsquo;s like religious stuff,</p>
<p>like assuming that there&rsquo;s this thing</p>
<p>that you cannot possibly understand</p>
<p>is a really good assumption under which to operate</p>
<p>and under which to do this first principles kind of thinking</p>
<p>because you can just keep digging and keep digging,</p>
<p>keep digging even when it seems like you&rsquo;re at the bottom</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re at the bottom or not.</p>
<p>And back to one of our, I guess our other kind of tangents</p>
<p>was that comes back to everyone&rsquo;s a human being.</p>
<p>The smartest human being in the history of humanity</p>
<p>is so hilariously weak, like short lived and not intelligent.</p>
<p>Do it for yourself, bro.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say, no, I&rsquo;m not saying comparison to me.</p>
<p>In comparison to me, everyone is awesome,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t do the goat thing.</p>
<p>But basically, it&rsquo;s just on a cosmic level.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if you were a vampire,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like 900 years old, like how much you would seem,</p>
<p>you would seem like a lowercase G God to people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be like, how could you know so much?</p>
<p>How can you have such a long view perspective?</p>
<p>It would be insane.</p>
<p>So I mean, it seems like we&rsquo;re talking about AI now, right?</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re creating things that are infinitely smarter</p>
<p>than us effectively and live all this time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably gonna do what we tell it to do, right?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.</p>
<p>Do you, by the way, think about AI</p>
<p>and the existential threats?</p>
<p>Like speaking of gods, are you, is this whole</p>
<p>technological world, we talked about social networks</p>
<p>and this increasing power of technology around us,</p>
<p>we ourselves are becoming less human</p>
<p>because we keep relying on technology more and more.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re becoming kinds of cyborgs,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s a future that&rsquo;s quite possible</p>
<p>where the technology becomes smarter</p>
<p>and more powerful than us humans</p>
<p>and starts having a life of its own</p>
<p>in ways that perhaps we don&rsquo;t imagine as human beings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean like two legged robots walking around</p>
<p>and being humans, but smarter.</p>
<p>I mean like an intelligent life that&rsquo;s beyond</p>
<p>and fundamentally different than our human life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infinite, it&rsquo;s a new kind of species,</p>
<p>not even just a new species, we&rsquo;re talking about systems,</p>
<p>but like it lives in the space of information.</p>
<p>It lives in a different time scale</p>
<p>and a different scale of all sorts, spatial scale.</p>
<p>It operate, like we spoke about individuals,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t operate in the sense of a single individual,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not embodied.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a thing that walks around</p>
<p>and it like, it looks at stuff and it consumes the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s able to do much larger scale sensing</p>
<p>of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I can barely even try to,</p>
<p>I can barely even conceive of what that would be like.</p>
<p>Are you scared or are you excited?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t define scared or excited.</p>
<p>I feel like I tend to define them like the same way</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, I guess I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>Kind of like when before karaoke, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually kind of my happy place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much everyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a, everyone else is probably, you know,</p>
<p>heading for the door at that point.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re doing it or leading up to the karaoke session.</p>
<p>Well, it depends whether or not they know it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>If they know it&rsquo;s me, that&rsquo;s before I start.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re like, who&rsquo;s that guy?</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re like halfway through the song,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already throwing their beer.</p>
<p>What categories of song or particular song</p>
<p>are we talking about in terms of like your happy place?</p>
<p>Oh man, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no question because, oh yeah,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have to sing it here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, it&rsquo;s like, remember, can I beat Khabib?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Is he here?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Yeah, then yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, if he&rsquo;s here, is he here?</p>
<p>No, then I, no.</p>
<p>I have a torn, I have torn feelings about Bohemian Rhapsody</p>
<p>because I like the beginning part, the sadness.</p>
<p>I like the solo, the heartbreak.</p>
<p>But the second part, I understand it, but it&rsquo;s so ridiculous.</p>
<p>It gets ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ridiculous.</p>
<p>It ruins it for me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more about flexing on people.</p>
<p>I think if you can actually hit that,</p>
<p>hit that, you know, the falsetto.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not, okay.</p>
<p>So you appreciate not for the musical beauty</p>
<p>and complexity of the song, you just like to flex on people.</p>
<p>Cause like for all, yeah.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the purpose of, of anything</p>
<p>except for just to let everyone know</p>
<p>that you think you&rsquo;re cool.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no better way of doing that than karaoke.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure why I brought up karaoke.</p>
<p>Captive audience.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, about fear and excitement of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know me, I don&rsquo;t know anything about,</p>
<p>I just, basically I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the implications of any of this.</p>
<p>I would just say that like radically altering</p>
<p>what it means to be human in such an unbelievably short</p>
<p>period of time just seems like such a crazy thing.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re, I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>who said this to me recently.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>So this is definitely not my idea, but we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even going, Hey, would you like to opt in everyone?</p>
<p>Everyone is being opted in, you know?</p>
<p>And particularly when you want to talk about</p>
<p>like large scale robotics or large scale AI,</p>
<p>like the world is changing.</p>
<p>People in Senegal are opting in right now</p>
<p>without realizing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even like, and again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to pick on Senegal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just whatever country comes up to mind,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s in the developing world.</p>
<p>But basically, you know,</p>
<p>recognizing that this huge shift is coming,</p>
<p>we have no idea if this is a decent idea.</p>
<p>And also something else I&rsquo;ve always been considered is,</p>
<p>you know, you think about most of the really awful, awful,</p>
<p>awful things that have done in history,</p>
<p>large scale slavery, holly, you name it.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, people say that it came from this motivation</p>
<p>or that motivation.</p>
<p>Maybe it did, maybe it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the issue, at least in my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a historian, power differential.</p>
<p>If you and I can&rsquo;t contest, we don&rsquo;t contend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we fight and you might win or we fight,</p>
<p>even you&rsquo;ll win comfortably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you are so unbelievably powerful compared to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing I can do to stop you.</p>
<p>That seems like a recipe for something</p>
<p>really, really not great happening.</p>
<p>Because if you think about like, you know,</p>
<p>European countries encountering each other,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just speculating,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about history,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say countries that can contend with one another</p>
<p>versus countries that can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say an alien species, an alien race shows up,</p>
<p>you know, right now, we don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I think Stephen Hawking said that,</p>
<p>and it makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>If you can come here, we better hope you&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>Because what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>What are we gonna hope that you invade the water planet</p>
<p>like they did in, you know, what are the,</p>
<p>Lord of the, yeah, War of the Worlds.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to get across is like,</p>
<p>shocking levels of power differential between groups</p>
<p>that makes the world ripe for horrific abuse</p>
<p>in the event that someone decides to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, like you imagine an adult hitting a child,</p>
<p>like hitting, hitting a child,</p>
<p>no one in their right mind would ever go like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s such an, it&rsquo;s so grossly imbalanced.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, this is wrong.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also on the table</p>
<p>only because of the gross imbalance.</p>
<p>So I guess to come back, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>whether we create AI and it&rsquo;s on some crazy level</p>
<p>of its own, or it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m in charge of it,</p>
<p>or I just, it seems like we&rsquo;re creating,</p>
<p>you mentioned like a game theory and nuclear war,</p>
<p>what prevented nuclear war?</p>
<p>I mean, presumably mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>I mean, hopefully also humanity and the humanity</p>
<p>and the reasonable, you know, cooler heads prevailing</p>
<p>and going, hey, I can understand the veil of ignorance.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t go, oh yeah, let me kill those guys</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t, I go, this is wrong, period.</p>
<p>And in concept, this is not an action I should take,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also nice and easy to keep me honest</p>
<p>if I know that I can&rsquo;t get you without being got myself.</p>
<p>But what happens when I can get anyone anything</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m more or less untouchable?</p>
<p>Like that seems to me to be like various times</p>
<p>in colonial history, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And what happened, we know what happened.</p>
<p>But so the possibility of really bad things</p>
<p>are plentiful, the possibilities.</p>
<p>But the possibilities of really positive things</p>
<p>are plentiful.</p>
<p>Like what though?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you though.</p>
<p>So I can give a million examples.</p>
<p>One is just the examples of the parent and the child.</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s a power differential there</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t like a parent hitting their child.</p>
<p>What about not just hitting, like beating?</p>
<p>Beating, yeah, great.</p>
<p>Beating their child.</p>
<p>How often percentage wise do you see that happening?</p>
<p>Even though that power differential,</p>
<p>first of all, other people&rsquo;s kids,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just put this on the table.</p>
<p>I love kids, but other people&rsquo;s kids</p>
<p>can be annoying sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes you gotta deal out some justice, I get it.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t practice, we don&rsquo;t take advantage</p>
<p>of that power differential.</p>
<p>So like there is ethics, there&rsquo;s moralities that emerge</p>
<p>that allow the power differential to be used for good</p>
<p>versus for bad.</p>
<p>So like one of the assumptions with Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>or with if Russia became much more powerful than America</p>
<p>or America much more powerful than Russia in the Cold War,</p>
<p>your assumption that immediately that power differential,</p>
<p>not your assumption, but it would express itself</p>
<p>would express itself in the same way</p>
<p>that it was trying to express itself</p>
<p>when there was a more level competition.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible when the power differential grows,</p>
<p>the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms</p>
<p>that made sense when it was at the same level,</p>
<p>the incentives become very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fun to destroy the ant colony.</p>
<p>You start becoming more the kind of a conservationalist.</p>
<p>One hopes, that&rsquo;s an evolved perspective though, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s evolved or not,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely a possibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear to me that something that&rsquo;s many orders</p>
<p>of magnitude more powerful than us will want to destroy us.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, how did mass slavery occur?</p>
<p>How did, you know, like just big dogs playing with not?</p>
<p>I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities in history</p>
<p>happened when the power differential was not as great</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re talking about with AI potentially.</p>
<p>Is that not somehow worse then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious that things that are way more powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair, okay.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>I guess, how do you restrain it though?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different discussions of how to.</p>
<p>I guess even restrain each other.</p>
<p>Cause let&rsquo;s say I go and decide to strike someone&rsquo;s child,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;d like to think I wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.</p>
<p>And so I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how many people used to get murdered</p>
<p>just in the woods?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I would just presume it&rsquo;s a lot, you know?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think most people are lunatics like that,</p>
<p>but I would just say.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Given though, if you&rsquo;re given to that,</p>
<p>your ability to get away with it was greater in the past</p>
<p>because of chance of detection was less.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>This is what that&rsquo;s called in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>AI safety research called value alignment of ensuring</p>
<p>as you build the systems that become smarter and smarter</p>
<p>and more powerful and powerful,</p>
<p>make sure that their values are aligned with the entities</p>
<p>over which they&rsquo;re becoming powerful with humans.</p>
<p>So if you were to talk to an AI that&rsquo;s becoming smarter,</p>
<p>at first it&rsquo;s dumber than you,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s becoming smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>You have to create mechanisms</p>
<p>where you both value the same things.</p>
<p>I guess one thing I wonder,</p>
<p>so I guess I&rsquo;m probably not like sharp enough to grasp this</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m honest, but I guess like, I wonder like,</p>
<p>I used to do chess programs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it was Deep Blue, Stockfish,</p>
<p>and then like AlphaZero and AlphaZero teaching itself</p>
<p>to beat Stockfish without any help in four hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like it becomes orders of magnitude more intelligence</p>
<p>than us in effectively in instantaneous period.</p>
<p>I guess what I always wondered,</p>
<p>like if you were that much smarter than me,</p>
<p>I feel like your ability to manipulate me</p>
<p>would be pretty significant or at least potentially, no?</p>
<p>But manipulation implies that the incentive is</p>
<p>to overpower everything around you.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s implied incentives.</p>
<p>If your value is to actually, like,</p>
<p>it depends what you want in life.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What you want in your system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that the goal of an AI system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all powerful is to destroy all humans.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that it is either.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>Or even enslave all humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to suggest</p>
<p>is that something adequately powerful,</p>
<p>these actions are on the table.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re on the table and that&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of people are really concerned about it</p>
<p>and are working on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to make the case for AGI</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re watching this, he&rsquo;s the one to kill.</p>
<p>No, actually I was thinking, I was, yeah.</p>
<p>I wash toilets like really well.</p>
<p>No, I mean, that&rsquo;s the main concern</p>
<p>for all the people in the AI state to research.</p>
<p>People talk about AGI is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of disturbing how little people are working</p>
<p>on trying to create mechanisms</p>
<p>that keep AI&rsquo;s values aligned with ours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely unshocking.</p>
<p>Yeah, we humans seem to do only good</p>
<p>when like, you know, you even look at like coronavirus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when, like the water has to be leaking</p>
<p>from the ceiling.</p>
<p>You have to be, there has to be blood everywhere,</p>
<p>fire, just destruction.</p>
<p>We just seem to ignore completely any trouble.</p>
<p>Writing all over the wall.</p>
<p>This is fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure nothing to see here, we&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>But we do all right, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>You figure out even when it becomes a really serious problem,</p>
<p>taking actions last minute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the innovative spirit</p>
<p>that results in a solution last minute,</p>
<p>right before the deadline.</p>
<p>It works out.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how you did school,</p>
<p>probably a lot better than me.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s exactly how I did school.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be more, I was no motivation up</p>
<p>until like the last, if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we have 22 hours to do the entire semesters of work.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s do this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you get like 19 fricking Mountain Dews and then, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why you and I are failures in life</p>
<p>because I just talked to, I mentioned Cal Newport</p>
<p>with his book, Deep Work and so on.</p>
<p>He is of the variety of these creatures</p>
<p>that basically does everything ahead of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>Because he dislikes the, he thinks it&rsquo;s unproductive</p>
<p>to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to be your best performance wise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to do the best work.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t make any, it&rsquo;s completely irrational</p>
<p>to a function based on the deadline.</p>
<p>You should have a system, a process that gets stuff,</p>
<p>a little bit of stuff done every day.</p>
<p>So like you should be, and constantly be systematically</p>
<p>honest with yourself.</p>
<p>If you say, I&rsquo;m going to get this stuff done today</p>
<p>and this week, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>at the end of the week, you have to then reflect</p>
<p>on what you did, what you planned and improve that plan,</p>
<p>update it constantly, update every day, every week,</p>
<p>every quarter, whatever those durations are.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m listening to this and reading his stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, I agree with everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yes, I&rsquo;m clapping.</p>
<p>But like the reality is, and then I go back</p>
<p>and just eat Cheetos and like, don&rsquo;t do shit</p>
<p>until like the last minute.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t meant to be cheesy.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t eat Cheetos, but yes.</p>
<p>But actually, again, not that it&rsquo;s ever going to matter</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so shockingly productive and well thought out</p>
<p>that whatever I&rsquo;ve decided to think about</p>
<p>trying to monkey wrench in there</p>
<p>is definitely going to be able to deal with.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that again, because you&rsquo;re a human being,</p>
<p>not a God, all of your strengths</p>
<p>are you have a corresponding weakness.</p>
<p>The less you practice working under the gun,</p>
<p>the less comfortable you are working under the gun.</p>
<p>The more practice you have working under the gun,</p>
<p>the better you get at it.</p>
<p>The downside is you&rsquo;re always working under the gun.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re less productive or it&rsquo;s like your work quality</p>
<p>maybe drops.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like, hey, I wonder if this,</p>
<p>I wonder if Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart</p>
<p>and I try to say the answer is almost certainly yes,</p>
<p>but you go, well, he hasn&rsquo;t struggled a bunch.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t struggle well.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that he can also work under the gun</p>
<p>really well, he just doesn&rsquo;t like to do it.</p>
<p>But yeah, but it&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I guess, what is it?</p>
<p>The Aristotle, we are what we repeatedly do.</p>
<p>We are all, we&rsquo;re all practicing something all the time.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the question that I have though.</p>
<p>I would love to ask him, it&rsquo;d be really neat</p>
<p>is in certain jobs.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you want to have preparation always,</p>
<p>always, but certain things have like a degree of like</p>
<p>entropy in the system and you go,</p>
<p>I need to practice working under the gun.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s what I need to do</p>
<p>because the fighting, it should be for the most part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really sterile environment.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things,</p>
<p>like fighting in a cage is very sterile</p>
<p>compared to most other things in life, right?</p>
<p>But dangerous, but sterile.</p>
<p>And unless of course, like, you know,</p>
<p>like the other guy, the ref decides to hit you,</p>
<p>which would be hilarious.</p>
<p>But anyway, I guess just going like, okay,</p>
<p>so at what value do you get out of adding a degree of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you could even be planned by someone else,</p>
<p>but junk in the system.</p>
<p>And you just have to work under the gun to make it happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for instance, for like police</p>
<p>or something like that, the situation turns left hard</p>
<p>at some random point in time.</p>
<p>And that could happen to any number of people.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s interesting things that allow</p>
<p>for perfect planning or quasi perfect planning</p>
<p>versus things that are inherently unstable.</p>
<p>And then what are the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the psychological fallout of comfort with that?</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people that are really comfortable</p>
<p>under the gun, let it happen a lot.</p>
<p>For all the good and the bad of that, does that make sense?</p>
<p>No, that totally makes sense.</p>
<p>And it was, I mean, his answer would be</p>
<p>that you have to be honest with yourself</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s valuable for your success</p>
<p>to practice being under the gun.</p>
<p>And then you should schedule that.</p>
<p>Yeah, then he&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>You should plan that, you should systematically.</p>
<p>And then as opposed to doing it half assedly,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, as opposed to letting the environment</p>
<p>choose the randomness, like control the randomness</p>
<p>to where like you optimize it.</p>
<p>I wish it&rsquo;s so efficient, it&rsquo;s shocking</p>
<p>just to hear about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, he&rsquo;s, I mean, the same way you are,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s annoying in the same way,</p>
<p>which is like he drops truth bombs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re probably comparably doing that.</p>
<p>No, he does.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s, so he, his profession requires that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not just like a motivational speaker or whatever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical computer scientist</p>
<p>and he needs the long hours in the day</p>
<p>of doing like serious math.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mostly math proofs.</p>
<p>And for that, you have to sit and think really deeply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really hard work.</p>
<p>Compared to like what most people do,</p>
<p>like even what I, I mean, what I do,</p>
<p>like programming is way easier than rigorous math proofs.</p>
<p>Cause you have to basically have this machine</p>
<p>and you have to, your brain to churn out logic</p>
<p>in a focused way while visualizing a bunch of things</p>
<p>and holding that in your brain</p>
<p>and holding that for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,</p>
<p>hopefully several hours.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not just like doing homework.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing totally novel stuff.</p>
<p>So like stuff that nobody&rsquo;s ever done before.</p>
<p>So you keep running up against the wall</p>
<p>of like, fuck, this is a den.</p>
<p>And oh no, wait, is this a dead end?</p>
<p>And like that whole frustration, that&rsquo;s serious mental work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like incredibly difficult mental work.</p>
<p>So he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But like you said, he&rsquo;s like, this seems like the standard</p>
<p>for the quality of work that he needs is so high</p>
<p>that almost anything less than this level</p>
<p>of systematization and organization would preclude it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So he can&rsquo;t afford the kind of bullshit</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that certainly I do,</p>
<p>which is like last deadline kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Cause you can&rsquo;t do that kind of work last minute</p>
<p>on deadline kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So my question for him in general is like,</p>
<p>and for you and I is like, well,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s these negative patterns that we do</p>
<p>of like doing shit last minute and so on.</p>
<p>Is this just who we are now?</p>
<p>Or are there some?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m really big into a free will.</p>
<p>You know, I was thinking that it&rsquo;s mostly predestination,</p>
<p>at least in this regard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with like communism.</p>
<p>Like, as long as it fits my, whatever is the lazy thing</p>
<p>to do, I&rsquo;ll just not believe in free will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a communism opportunist or that&rsquo;s when that was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an opportunistic communist and capitalist.</p>
<p>I just do whatever, whatever is cool at the time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to examine some fundamental principles</p>
<p>of a particular thing that Joe Rogan brought up to me</p>
<p>several times online and offline.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which is that he thinks that the tie that I wear</p>
<p>is something that makes me vulnerable to attack</p>
<p>that you should be, the reason he doesn&rsquo;t wear a tie</p>
<p>is because he can get choked very easily with a tie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big concern.</p>
<p>Okay, my contention, and by the way,</p>
<p>he wore a suit last time too.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t wear it on the podcast.</p>
<p>He wore it for dinner later.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wore a suit the other day</p>
<p>and I had no socks on.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to wear socks?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you wear a suit?</p>
<p>Did you go to court?</p>
<p>No, no, not in that, no.</p>
<p>Hey, I don&rsquo;t know, I just wanted to play.</p>
<p>I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So my contention is like the jacket,</p>
<p>everything is more dangerous than a tie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where I was going with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where, yeah, it was my first thought too.</p>
<p>Like once the tie becomes an issue, like, yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like everything else is already an issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already an issue, yeah.</p>
<p>Because the tie to me, now without like messing with it now,</p>
<p>is to me has some of the similar problems</p>
<p>that a belt does.</p>
<p>So like, for example, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure you can use the belt as tied.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s some kind of guards</p>
<p>you can probably utilize the belt with,</p>
<p>but the belt, sorry, when it&rsquo;s tied around the waist.</p>
<p>Are you talking about a belt belt or a gi belt?</p>
<p>Sorry, gi belt.</p>
<p>Okay. Sorry.</p>
<p>Gi belt, importantly, gi belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that great of a thing to use in most cases,</p>
<p>I would say, because it slides.</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, you can probably invent a few interesting ways</p>
<p>to use it as leverage, as control and so on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just so many more things around the gi belt</p>
<p>that are better.</p>
<p>And so for me, the tie, what people don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Are we trying to sell a DVD here</p>
<p>and have some widgets and bells and whistles?</p>
<p>Because in that case,</p>
<p>the belt is really important part of what we do.</p>
<p>And I would really encourage you guys to look into it.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re trying to actually like learn something and say,</p>
<p>like you said, we&rsquo;re surrounded by better options.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not obvious to me that the belt,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s actually undiscovered things</p>
<p>about using the belt.</p>
<p>I think people have used like putting a foot</p>
<p>inside the belt somehow, inside the gi belt.</p>
<p>This is a no punches, gi grappling situation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>Sort of fairly contrived, right?</p>
<p>But with punches too, like, is there,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s talk about a street fights with a belt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a jeans belt, like a belt, clothing belt.</p>
<p>Okay, so I get to take it off</p>
<p>and whip them in the face with the buckle?</p>
<p>How serious is this street fight?</p>
<p>Are we talking like that far and open?</p>
<p>No, 100% serious.</p>
<p>Or are we talking like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>No, like death, like one of you has to die.</p>
<p>Oh, yikes, whoa.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, you ever, like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in this situation all the time.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>I had something, I had somebody try to fight me</p>
<p>to Starbucks the other day.</p>
<p>I fight kids, we&rsquo;re talking about power differential.</p>
<p>Yeah, hey.</p>
<p>I just beat up kids all the time.</p>
<p>Just pick the easy W&rsquo;s, you gotta get the easy W&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if you want the hard ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m undefeated.</p>
<p>Come around the playground, watch what happens.</p>
<p>No, like to the death, what is their clothing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful, you know?</p>
<p>From my perspective.</p>
<p>You mean like for your use or their use?</p>
<p>Both, my use, their use.</p>
<p>No, like I like how you wanted to take the belt off</p>
<p>and use the buckle to hit them with.</p>
<p>But first of all, how are you gonna take off the belt?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of effort involved in unclothing.</p>
<p>Well, what I was figuring was when they started</p>
<p>to see me take my pants off in the fight,</p>
<p>they were like, what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making dead eye contact, obviously,</p>
<p>this is going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, nodding.</p>
<p>And then, you know, by the time they realized</p>
<p>you took a belt off until you could whip them with it,</p>
<p>you actually, you&rsquo;re already one, possibly two steps ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, so fine, let&rsquo;s not talk about your own clothing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about their clothing.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll take off their belt and hit them with it.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s much harder to do.</p>
<p>No question, but if you can do it.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m maintaining, I can, no, I just said.</p>
<p>Like, how did it come to this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, but the point is there&rsquo;s alternatives</p>
<p>that are perhaps more effective.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In my perspective, this might be clueless,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost no clothing that&rsquo;s more effective</p>
<p>than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like clothing.</p>
<p>Particularly when you start to add hitting,</p>
<p>like every single time I start grabbing your clothes,</p>
<p>if you start hitting and it&rsquo;s not like nothing could work,</p>
<p>but most of the time you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>why am I not using my arms for something better</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;m doing them right now?</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>in terms of just distance,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a case of different distances,</p>
<p>even like situations where, let&rsquo;s not talk about like,</p>
<p>like a situation where you haven&rsquo;t both yet agreed</p>
<p>that a fight is happening.</p>
<p>Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then.</p>
<p>I mean. Solid clothing?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket</p>
<p>because you can snatch somebody on their face.</p>
<p>Snatch down.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s like, if you, if you took my,</p>
<p>like, you know, like you snap down and judo,</p>
<p>like how easy it is to snap down a beginner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>So I agree with you.</p>
<p>Actually a tie in that sense</p>
<p>might be a really effective way to snap down.</p>
<p>So like the snap down is really powerful</p>
<p>to change the like disorient the situation</p>
<p>and give you a lot of different opportunities</p>
<p>for, you know, taking their back, taking them down.</p>
<p>Doing hilarious stuff,</p>
<p>like snapping them down with a tie into your knee.</p>
<p>And then when they come back up doing this, you&rsquo;re already.</p>
<p>So yeah, in that sense, I agree,</p>
<p>but not as a choking mechanism</p>
<p>because the concern Joe had is choke.</p>
<p>I think you would probably choke me with your tie</p>
<p>more easily than I could choke you with your tie.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Cause like, if you get, you can get,</p>
<p>like you get my back</p>
<p>and you can put it around somebody&rsquo;s neck, you know,</p>
<p>like, like, like, you ever see a diehard?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude</p>
<p>or whatever was,</p>
<p>it was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the,</p>
<p>with the chain and then he ended up getting choked himself</p>
<p>with the chain if I recall this properly.</p>
<p>But anyway, yeah, like, like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>I feel like if I start grabbing your tie,</p>
<p>you have too many other great options.</p>
<p>I mean, I do like the snap down</p>
<p>that you actually made me realize.</p>
<p>No, I think you have a good there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re on the right path with it.</p>
<p>With a snap down?</p>
<p>Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these,</p>
<p>like, you know, like, like you,</p>
<p>like you poke your finger in my chest</p>
<p>and then snap down real quick.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And also, socially speaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a threatening thing to, you know,</p>
<p>to reach for the tie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not particularly like a business setting.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never see it coming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause I was thinking choke,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a really good leverage point</p>
<p>cause like grabbing a jacket,</p>
<p>the jacket will slide if you try to snap down.</p>
<p>You really have to get a hole,</p>
<p>like a really good hold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s around the back of the neck.</p>
<p>But what if it&rsquo;s a clip on?</p>
<p>How much of a jackass would you look like?</p>
<p>You feel like,</p>
<p>and then they just stick you on.</p>
<p>But you ever see the Japanese politician</p>
<p>or I think it was Japan.</p>
<p>The judo throw?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, that guy is so,</p>
<p>he was so calm and cool.</p>
<p>Had like, it was every,</p>
<p>it was beautiful technique.</p>
<p>The level of, actually the throw was even gentle.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was perfect.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Well executed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>More of our politicians just toss the shit out of each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need more Teddy Roosevelts.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I like our politicians like talking about fighting</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s clear that none of them even,</p>
<p>it would ever have been in a fight ever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Somebody was saying Teddy Roosevelt was interesting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>Is he&rsquo;s one of the greatest presidents this country&rsquo;s had.</p>
<p>And he was one of the greatest presidents,</p>
<p>even though he faced no crisis whatsoever.</p>
<p>He literally willed himself.</p>
<p>Like nothing happened during his presidency.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a bad motherfucker who made really great speeches.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he like, this made me realize,</p>
<p>I was just talking to a historian that like,</p>
<p>most of the people who we think are great</p>
<p>need also a good crisis that they&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>that reveal their greatness.</p>
<p>But Muhammad Ali, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s Muhammad Ali, I mean, in sports.</p>
<p>But you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like the circumstances, what is greatness?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you have to, it&rsquo;s not just your capacity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you face, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the quality of opposition, circumstance,</p>
<p>what you overcome.</p>
<p>So I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is Joe Rogan is wrong</p>
<p>about the tie thing.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t want to go so far as saying he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I, you know, the man&rsquo;s not here to defend himself.</p>
<p>Maybe he has some things that I&rsquo;m not understanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to.</p>
<p>No, he has not deeply thought this.</p>
<p>This is my main criticism of Joe.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not deeply thought to this.</p>
<p>And the MMA journalists will be like,</p>
<p>Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong.</p>
<p>And hates ties.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll integrate, hit their back in there somehow.</p>
<p>Nice, nice.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re talking about greatness</p>
<p>and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time.</p>
<p>Can you like reflect back and think</p>
<p>what are some of the hardest, if not the hardest thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever had to do in your life?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I think I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of things.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things not go my way.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been incredibly fortunate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things go my way also.</p>
<p>But leaving, leaving Team Lord Urban in 2008,</p>
<p>which I firmly believe was the right thing to do,</p>
<p>is one of the, that was very difficult at the time.</p>
<p>Not like, not a difficult choice,</p>
<p>but it was because of why I was leaving.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Just psychologically.</p>
<p>First of all, loss in general.</p>
<p>Leaving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Team, family, all kinds.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what the circumstances.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t lose any friends,</p>
<p>but I lost a lot of people I thought were my friends.</p>
<p>And I, I lost training.</p>
<p>I lost, I&rsquo;d also had like a really serious,</p>
<p>my wrist only does that.</p>
<p>So like, I had a really serious wrist surgery,</p>
<p>like that I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to be able</p>
<p>to compete anymore after that.</p>
<p>I just got my brown belt.</p>
<p>That was, it was a tough time,</p>
<p>like psychologically, physically, everything.</p>
<p>But I was very, very motivated to do my best</p>
<p>and to push through it and to,</p>
<p>it was to carry on in a positive direction,</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>A different direction.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Were you lonely?</p>
<p>This is the thing about family,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s an abusive family, leaving is tough.</p>
<p>People are complicated.</p>
<p>And even people that I, that I don&rsquo;t think very well of,</p>
<p>that I think on the whole, I don&rsquo;t think very well of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s unfair to paint them with one brush.</p>
<p>You know, obviously there&rsquo;s greater and lesser examples</p>
<p>of that, like the person we discussed last time,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an infinitely, you know, beyond almost anyone</p>
<p>that we could ever imagine meeting</p>
<p>in our own personal lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bloody elbow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of forgiveness and hate, I mean, do you,</p>
<p>do you have hate in your heart for,</p>
<p>for people in your past?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>For that process?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, there were definitely times</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve been negatively motivated</p>
<p>to prove people wrong or to accomplish things in spite.</p>
<p>And I think that some of that is valuable,</p>
<p>if I be lying, if I felt differently.</p>
<p>I think particularly, I do really well in conflict.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m useless for that.</p>
<p>This is the usual deadline thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m useless, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m useless.</p>
<p>I like the chaos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m useless, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m useless without an antagonist.</p>
<p>I like fighting.</p>
<p>I like competition.</p>
<p>I like being pushed.</p>
<p>I like feeling like if I don&rsquo;t play well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get hurt.</p>
<p>I have no choice but to play well</p>
<p>or play with everything I got at the very least.</p>
<p>And I guess I would say though, is, you know,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve gotten, you know, more time and, you know,</p>
<p>lived a little bit longer, you see, you know,</p>
<p>various situations for, you know, you know,</p>
<p>with increased color, I guess I would say, increased clarity.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are a lot of lessons to be learned,</p>
<p>even from times in history or bad experience that we have.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>can we take those lessons and move forward?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, what I think we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in sometimes socially right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re forgetting important lessons of the past.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Not saying, hey, I don&rsquo;t get why we could be going</p>
<p>in this direction or that, I understand entirely,</p>
<p>but hey, let&rsquo;s not forget the lesson</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have to learn them again</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t really serve anybody.</p>
<p>And anyway, I guess I would say I&rsquo;m thankful</p>
<p>for all of the experiences, difficult and otherwise,</p>
<p>mostly difficult, honestly, most of the times I remember,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for every loss I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>particularly the tough ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for, you know, for all the relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, many people have taught me many things.</p>
<p>They continue to teach me many things,</p>
<p>some of whom are still some of my closest friends,</p>
<p>some of whom are people I really don&rsquo;t get along with at all.</p>
<p>And some of whom are people I think really poorly of.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s not many of that last group.</p>
<p>What I guess I would say is there&rsquo;s been a lot of things</p>
<p>and opportunities to learn and, you know, throughout that.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s not as if I&rsquo;ve never done,</p>
<p>made any mistakes myself.</p>
<p>Now, again, there are magnitude differences I like to think.</p>
<p>And I can definitely say that none of the mistakes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever made have been mistakes of intention.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve screwed up a lot of things in my life,</p>
<p>but I can confidently and easily say</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never had ill intent towards people</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>You sit there and you&rsquo;re like, man,</p>
<p>this is the right thing, this is the right thing.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ve been wrong.</p>
<p>But, you know, you never sit out with malicious intent.</p>
<p>And I think that when I find</p>
<p>that I think people do things differently,</p>
<p>when I do think that there is malicious intent,</p>
<p>I have a difficult time forgiving that.</p>
<p>How does love win over hate, Ryan Hall, in this world?</p>
<p>We talk about social media,</p>
<p>we talk about forgiveness</p>
<p>of some of the more complicated people in your past.</p>
<p>If we scale that to the entire world</p>
<p>before the AI destroys us,</p>
<p>and the human race is lost to history,</p>
<p>how do you think love wins over hate?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to preface this by saying</p>
<p>I tried to make pancakes the other day.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy to comment on this.</p>
<p>So basically, I think most of the times</p>
<p>that I can think of that I&rsquo;ve struggled,</p>
<p>you know, and the times that I&rsquo;ve read about</p>
<p>is being unable to see the humanity in other people.</p>
<p>And also, even in sometimes our enemies</p>
<p>and the people that have done awful things,</p>
<p>and you go, what would allow people to do this,</p>
<p>that, or the other?</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t forgive what they&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>depending upon, you know, some things are forgivable,</p>
<p>some things are less so.</p>
<p>But you wanna understand why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, to our knowledge,</p>
<p>demons don&rsquo;t populate our world.</p>
<p>Neither do like literal angels walking around</p>
<p>being actually perfect.</p>
<p>A lot of times, the things that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I find it deeply amusing watching, you know,</p>
<p>people hoisted by their own batard on Twitter,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s gross and it&rsquo;s really unproductive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually like equal parts amusing and like awful,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not happy that someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being raked over the coals, particularly unjustifiably.</p>
<p>But it is funny when it&rsquo;s the exact same thing</p>
<p>they were raking others over the coals for,</p>
<p>not like a week or two prior,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s happened repeatedly and will continue to happen.</p>
<p>And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, you know,</p>
<p>a prior, you know, like a recognition</p>
<p>of the humanity of others of that all of us make mistakes,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s difficult to understand intention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had arguments with close friends of mine</p>
<p>over text message where both of us ended up super pissed</p>
<p>because we were completely misreading what the tone,</p>
<p>the intention of what the other person was doing.</p>
<p>And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to ascribe the most negative possible,</p>
<p>you know, the least charitable assessment</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s such a dangerous way</p>
<p>to live your life and it&rsquo;s also just a fruitless way</p>
<p>to live your life.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one thing to go, hey, why did you do that?</p>
<p>I was pissed.</p>
<p>Did you, what did you do?</p>
<p>You just, you did that to make yourself feel better,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re damn right I did.</p>
<p>And have I done that plenty of times in my life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would lie if I said that I didn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>why did you, why did you punch that guy in the face?</p>
<p>He was going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop.</p>
<p>And then I gave warning and I put him on his ass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m not sorry.</p>
<p>But then looking back now with years to sit on them,</p>
<p>like, do I understand why I did what I did?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Would I like to respond differently now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would.</p>
<p>You know, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that,</p>
<p>I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean, understandable doesn&rsquo;t mean correct.</p>
<p>Understandable doesn&rsquo;t mean that you go,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You go, I could see someone doing such a thing.</p>
<p>But I guess just trying to understand</p>
<p>and see the humanity in others.</p>
<p>Cause if I can&rsquo;t see the humanity in others,</p>
<p>how can I see it in myself?</p>
<p>And also, you know, how am I meant to interact with everyone?</p>
<p>As you said, whether, you know,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re a society of individuals</p>
<p>for at least for the time being, hopefully,</p>
<p>you know, in perpetuity,</p>
<p>we still come together as a whole.</p>
<p>And watching, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like you said, if I only ask why once,</p>
<p>I start with, stay out of my way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll stay out of yours.</p>
<p>Leave me the fuck alone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, that&rsquo;s fine, Ryan.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s easy for you to say,</p>
<p>living in a society that doesn&rsquo;t actually function like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit cheap.</p>
<p>But if I recognize that that&rsquo;s step one is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hurt you and you don&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p>But then we go, well, but how can I help you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s step two.</p>
<p>And then it goes way beyond that</p>
<p>and a lot further than I&rsquo;ve thought about it.</p>
<p>But I guess what I would just say is,</p>
<p>again, recognition of the humanity in others</p>
<p>and that we all have different strengths,</p>
<p>we all have different weaknesses.</p>
<p>And you can never really be sure</p>
<p>where the other person&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>But if we approach things charitably,</p>
<p>as charitably as we would hope others would approach us,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll do a lot better.</p>
<p>And I guess one thing that I read that I liked</p>
<p>that I thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing</p>
<p>was everyone is a great, you know, jury,</p>
<p>I read there, I&rsquo;m sorry, a great lawyer for themselves</p>
<p>and a judge for others.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a terrible way to live life,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s an understandable one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And then probably flipping that is the right way to live.</p>
<p>Being constantly judgmental of yourself</p>
<p>and a defender of others.</p>
<p>And that results ultimately in an interaction</p>
<p>that deescalates versus escalates.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we can all live in a world like that.</p>
<p>And sometimes you&rsquo;re like, hey man,</p>
<p>people that deserve punishment won&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Like, okay, hey, but what do they say?</p>
<p>Better to have 10 guilty people go free</p>
<p>than wanting this in person, you know, burn.</p>
<p>And ultimately that is, I think that is a better world</p>
<p>than the other way around.</p>
<p>And if all else fails, join the team that builds the AI</p>
<p>that kills all humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have to be on a team,</p>
<p>pick the winning team.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hiring pitch, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good hiring pitch.</p>
<p>You still taking resumes?</p>
<p>You want to be on the team that doesn&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>during the great apocalypse.</p>
<p>Not immediately.</p>
<p>You want to be on the one that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>eventually long suffering and stepped on, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Life is suffering, Ryan Hall.</p>
<p>This was an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed talking to you.</p>
<p>I could probably talk to you for many more hours.</p>
<p>I hope I do as well.</p>
<p>Ryan, I love you, buddy.</p>
<p>This was a great conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Hall</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Frank Herbert in Dune.</p>
<p>I must not fear.</p>
<p>Fear is the mind killer.</p>
<p>Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.</p>
<p>I will face my fear.</p>
<p>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</p>
<p>And when it has gone past,</p>
<p>I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</p>
<p>Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.</p>
<p>Only I will remain.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
