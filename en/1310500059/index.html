    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Sebastian Thrun.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest roboticists, computer scientists, and educators of our time.</p>
<p>He led the development of the autonomous vehicles at Stanford</p>
<p>that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and placed second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge.</p>
<p>He then led the Google self driving car program, which launched the self driving car revolution.</p>
<p>He taught the popular Stanford course on artificial intelligence in 2011,</p>
<p>which was one of the first massive open online courses, or MOOCs as they&rsquo;re commonly called.</p>
<p>That experience led him to co found Udacity, an online education platform.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t taken courses on it yet, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Their self driving car program, for example, is excellent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also the CEO of Kitty Hawk, a company working on building flying cars,</p>
<p>or more technically, EVTOLs, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.</p>
<p>He has launched several revolutions and inspired millions of people.</p>
<p>But also, as many know, he&rsquo;s just a really nice guy.</p>
<p>It was an honor and a pleasure to talk with him.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>follow it on Spotify, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>If you leave a review on Apple Podcast or YouTube or Twitter,</p>
<p>consider mentioning ideas, people, topics you find interesting.</p>
<p>It helps guide the future of this podcast.</p>
<p>But in general, I just love comments with kindness and thoughtfulness in them.</p>
<p>This podcast is a side project for me, as many people know,</p>
<p>but I still put a lot of effort into it.</p>
<p>So the positive words of support from an amazing community, from you, really help.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>I provide timestamps for the start of the conversation that you can skip to,</p>
<p>but it helps if you listen to the ad and support this podcast</p>
<p>by trying out the product or service being advertised.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use code LEGSPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sebastian Thrun.</p>
<p>You mentioned that The Matrix may be your favorite movie.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with a crazy philosophical question.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>And in general, do you find the thought experiment interesting?</p>
<p>Define simulation, I would say.</p>
<p>Maybe we are, maybe we are not,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s completely irrelevant to the way we should act.</p>
<p>Putting aside, for a moment,</p>
<p>the fact that it might not have any impact on how we should act as human beings,</p>
<p>for people studying theoretical physics,</p>
<p>these kinds of questions might be kind of interesting,</p>
<p>looking at the universe as an information processing system.</p>
<p>The universe is an information processing system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge physical, biological, chemical computer, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>But I live here and now.</p>
<p>I care about people, I care about us.</p>
<p>What do you think is trying to compute?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an intention.</p>
<p>I think the world evolves the way it evolves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautiful, it&rsquo;s unpredictable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really, really grateful to be alive.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true human.</p>
<p>Which last time I checked, I was.</p>
<p>Or that, in fact, this whole conversation is just a touring test</p>
<p>to see if indeed you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also said that one of the first programs,</p>
<p>or the first few programs you&rsquo;ve written was a, wait for it, TI57 calculator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s early 80s.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to date calculators or anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s early 80s, correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you were to place yourself back into that time, into the mindset you were in,</p>
<p>could you have predicted the evolution of computing, AI,</p>
<p>the internet technology in the decades that followed?</p>
<p>I was super fascinated by Silicon Valley, which I&rsquo;d seen on television once</p>
<p>and thought, my god, this is so cool.</p>
<p>They build like DRAMs there and CPUs.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>And as a college student a few years later, I decided to really study</p>
<p>intelligence and study human beings.</p>
<p>And found that even back then in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence is what fascinated me the most.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing is that back in the day, the computers are really small.</p>
<p>The brains we could build were not anywhere bigger than a cockroach.</p>
<p>And cockroaches aren&rsquo;t very smart.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t at the scale yet where we are today.</p>
<p>Did you dream at that time to achieve the kind of scale we have today?</p>
<p>Or did that seem possible?</p>
<p>I always wanted to make robots smart.</p>
<p>And I felt it was super cool to build an artificial human.</p>
<p>And the best way to build an artificial human was to build a robot,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of the closest we could do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we aren&rsquo;t there yet.</p>
<p>The robots today are still very brittle.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating to study intelligence from a constructive</p>
<p>perspective when you build something.</p>
<p>To understand you build, what do you think it takes to build an intelligent</p>
<p>system, an intelligent robot?</p>
<p>I think the biggest innovation that we&rsquo;ve seen is machine learning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the idea that the computers can basically teach themselves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say everybody pretty much knows how to walk.</p>
<p>And we learn how to walk in the first year or two of our lives.</p>
<p>But no scientist has ever been able to write down the rules of human gait.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>We have it in our brains somehow.</p>
<p>We can practice it.</p>
<p>We understand it.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t articulate it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t pass it on by language.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is kind of the deficiency of today&rsquo;s computer programming.</p>
<p>When you program a computer, they&rsquo;re so insanely dumb that you have to give them</p>
<p>rules for every contingencies.</p>
<p>Very unlike the way people learn from data and experience,</p>
<p>computers are being instructed.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s so hard to get this instruction set right,</p>
<p>we pay software engineers $200,000 a year.</p>
<p>Now, the most recent innovation, which has been in the make for 30,</p>
<p>40 years, is an idea that computers can find their own rules.</p>
<p>So they can learn from falling down and getting up the same way children can</p>
<p>learn from falling down and getting up.</p>
<p>And that revolution has led to a capability that&rsquo;s completely unmatched.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s computers can watch experts do their jobs, whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a doctor or a lawyer, pick up the regularities, learn those rules,</p>
<p>and then become as good as the best experts.</p>
<p>So the dream of in the 80s of expert systems, for example, had at its core</p>
<p>the idea that humans could boil down their expertise on a sheet of paper,</p>
<p>so to sort of reduce, sort of be able to explain to machines</p>
<p>how to do something explicitly.</p>
<p>So do you think, what&rsquo;s the use of human expertise into this whole picture?</p>
<p>Do you think most of the intelligence will come from machines learning</p>
<p>from experience without human expertise input?</p>
<p>So the question for me is much more how do you express expertise?</p>
<p>You can express expertise by writing a book.</p>
<p>You can express expertise by showing someone what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You can express expertise by applying it by many different ways.</p>
<p>And I think the expert systems was our best attempt in AI</p>
<p>to capture expertise and rules.</p>
<p>But someone sat down and said, here are the rules of human gait.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s when you put your big toe forward and your heel backwards</p>
<p>and you always stop stumbling.</p>
<p>And as we now know, the set of rules, the set of language that we can command</p>
<p>is incredibly limited.</p>
<p>The majority of the human brain doesn&rsquo;t deal with language.</p>
<p>It deals with subconscious, numerical, perceptual things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t even self aware of.</p>
<p>Now, when an AI system watches an expert do their job and practice their job,</p>
<p>it can pick up things that people can&rsquo;t even put into writing,</p>
<p>into books or rules.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the real power is.</p>
<p>We now have AI systems that, for example, look over the shoulders</p>
<p>of highly paid human doctors like dermatologists or radiologists,</p>
<p>and they can somehow pick up those skills that no one can express in words.</p>
<p>So you were a key person in launching three revolutions,</p>
<p>online education, autonomous vehicles, and flying cars or VTOLs.</p>
<p>So high level, and I apologize for all the philosophical questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no apology necessary.</p>
<p>How do you choose what problems to try and solve?</p>
<p>What drives you to make those solutions a reality?</p>
<p>I have two desires in life.</p>
<p>I want to literally make the lives of others better.</p>
<p>Or as we often say, maybe jokingly, make the world a better place.</p>
<p>I actually believe in this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as funny as it sounds.</p>
<p>And second, I want to learn.</p>
<p>I want to get new skills.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in a job I&rsquo;m good at, because if I&rsquo;m in a job</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m good at, the chances for me to learn something interesting</p>
<p>is actually minimized.</p>
<p>So I want to be in a job I&rsquo;m bad at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important to me.</p>
<p>So in a bill, for example, what people often</p>
<p>call flying cars, these are electrical, vertical, takeoff,</p>
<p>and landing vehicles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just no expert in any of this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so much fun to learn on the job what it actually means</p>
<p>to build something like this.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d say the stuff that I&rsquo;ve done lately</p>
<p>after I finished my professorship at Stanford,</p>
<p>they really focused on what has the maximum impact on society.</p>
<p>Transportation is something that has transformed the 21st</p>
<p>or 20th century more than any other invention,</p>
<p>in my opinion, even more than communication.</p>
<p>And cities are different.</p>
<p>Workers are different.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s rights are different because of transportation.</p>
<p>And yet, we still have a very suboptimal transportation</p>
<p>solution where we kill 1.2 or so million people every year</p>
<p>in traffic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the leading cause of death for young people</p>
<p>in many countries, where we are extremely inefficient</p>
<p>resource wise.</p>
<p>Just go to your average neighborhood city</p>
<p>and look at the number of parked cars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a travesty, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Or where we spend endless hours in traffic jams.</p>
<p>And very, very simple innovations,</p>
<p>like a self driving car or what people call a flying car,</p>
<p>could completely change this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I mean, the technology is basically there.</p>
<p>You have to close your eyes not to see it.</p>
<p>So lingering on autonomous vehicles, a fascinating space,</p>
<p>some incredible work you&rsquo;ve done throughout your career there.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with DARPA, I think, the DARPA challenge,</p>
<p>through the desert and then urban to the streets.</p>
<p>I think that inspired an entire generation of roboticists</p>
<p>and obviously sprung this whole excitement</p>
<p>about this particular kind of four wheeled robots</p>
<p>we called autonomous cars, self driving cars.</p>
<p>So you led the development of Stanley, the autonomous car</p>
<p>that won the race to the desert, the DARPA challenge in 2005.</p>
<p>And Junior, the car that finished second</p>
<p>in the DARPA urban challenge, also did incredibly well</p>
<p>in 2007, I think.</p>
<p>What are some painful, inspiring, or enlightening</p>
<p>experiences from that time that stand out to you?</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Painful were all these incredibly complicated,</p>
<p>stupid bugs that had to be found.</p>
<p>We had a phase where Stanley, our car that eventually</p>
<p>won the DARPA grand challenge, would every 30 miles</p>
<p>just commit suicide.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And it ended up to be that in the sinking of two computer</p>
<p>clocks, occasionally a clock went backwards</p>
<p>and that negative time elapsed, screwed up</p>
<p>the entire internal logic.</p>
<p>But it took ages to find this.</p>
<p>There were bugs like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say enlightening is the Stanford team immediately</p>
<p>focused on machine learning and on software,</p>
<p>whereas everybody else seemed to focus on building better hardware.</p>
<p>Our analysis had been a human being with an existing rental</p>
<p>car can perfectly drive the course</p>
<p>but why do I have to build a better rental car?</p>
<p>I just should replace the human being.</p>
<p>And the human being, to me, was a conjunction of three steps.</p>
<p>We had sensors, eyes and ears, mostly eyes.</p>
<p>We had brains in the middle.</p>
<p>And then we had actuators, our hands and our feet.</p>
<p>Now, the actuators are easy to build.</p>
<p>The sensors are actually also easy to build.</p>
<p>What was missing was the brain.</p>
<p>So we had to build a human brain.</p>
<p>And nothing clearer than to me that the human brain</p>
<p>is a learning machine.</p>
<p>So why not just train our robot?</p>
<p>So we would build massive machine learning</p>
<p>into our machine.</p>
<p>And with that, we were able to not just learn</p>
<p>from human drivers.</p>
<p>We had the entire speed control of the vehicle</p>
<p>was copied from human driving.</p>
<p>But also have the robot learn from experience</p>
<p>where it made a mistake and recover from it</p>
<p>and learn from it.</p>
<p>You mentioned the pain point of software and clocks.</p>
<p>Synchronization seems to be a problem that</p>
<p>continues with robotics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky one with drones and so on.</p>
<p>What does it take to build a thing, a system</p>
<p>with so many constraints?</p>
<p>You have a deadline, no time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re unsure about anything really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time that people really even exploring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even sure that anybody can finish</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about the race to the desert</p>
<p>the year before nobody finish.</p>
<p>What does it take to scramble and finish</p>
<p>a product that actually, a system that actually works?</p>
<p>We were very lucky.</p>
<p>We were a really small team.</p>
<p>The core of the team were four people.</p>
<p>It was four because five couldn&rsquo;t comfortably sit</p>
<p>inside a car, but four could.</p>
<p>And I, as a team leader, my job was</p>
<p>to get pizza for everybody and wash the car and stuff</p>
<p>like this and repair the radiator when it broke</p>
<p>and debug the system.</p>
<p>And we were very open minded.</p>
<p>We had no egos involved.</p>
<p>We just wanted to see how far we can get.</p>
<p>What we did really, really well was time management.</p>
<p>We were done with everything a month before the race.</p>
<p>And we froze the entire software a month before the race.</p>
<p>And it turned out, looking at other teams,</p>
<p>every other team complained if they had just one more week,</p>
<p>they would have won.</p>
<p>And we decided we&rsquo;re not going to fall into that mistake.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be early.</p>
<p>And we had an entire month to shake the system.</p>
<p>And we actually found two or three minor bugs</p>
<p>in the last month that we had to fix.</p>
<p>And we were completely prepared when the race occurred.</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all, that&rsquo;s such an incredibly rare</p>
<p>achievement in terms of being able to be done on time</p>
<p>or ahead of time.</p>
<p>What do you, how do you do that in your future work?</p>
<p>What advice do you have in general?</p>
<p>Because it seems to be so rare,</p>
<p>especially in highly innovative projects like this.</p>
<p>People work till the last second.</p>
<p>Well, the nice thing about the DARPA Grand Challenge</p>
<p>is that the problem was incredibly well defined.</p>
<p>We were able for a while to drive</p>
<p>the old DARPA Grand Challenge course,</p>
<p>which had been used the year before.</p>
<p>And then at some reason we were kicked out of the region.</p>
<p>So we had to go to a different desert, the Snorran Desert,</p>
<p>and we were able to drive desert trails</p>
<p>just of the same type.</p>
<p>So there was never any debate about like,</p>
<p>what is actually the problem?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t sit down and say,</p>
<p>hey, should we build a car or a plane?</p>
<p>We had to build a car.</p>
<p>That made it very, very easy.</p>
<p>Then I studied my own life and life of others.</p>
<p>And we realized that the typical mistake that people make</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this kind of crazy bug left</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t found yet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, they regret it.</p>
<p>And that bug would have been trivial to fix.</p>
<p>They just haven&rsquo;t fixed it yet.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to fall into that trap.</p>
<p>So I built a testing team.</p>
<p>We had a testing team that built a testing booklet</p>
<p>of 160 pages of tests we had to go through</p>
<p>just to make sure we shake out the system appropriately.</p>
<p>And the testing team was with us all the time</p>
<p>and dictated to us today, we do railroad crossings.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we do, we practice the start of the event.</p>
<p>And in all of these, we thought,</p>
<p>oh my God, it&rsquo;s long solved trivial.</p>
<p>And then we tested it out.</p>
<p>Oh my God, it doesn&rsquo;t do a railroad crossing.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Oh my God, it mistakes the rails for metal barriers.</p>
<p>We have to fix this.</p>
<p>So it was really a continuous focus</p>
<p>on improving the weakest part of the system.</p>
<p>And as long as you focus on improving</p>
<p>the weakest part of the system,</p>
<p>you eventually build a really great system.</p>
<p>Let me just pause on that, to me as an engineer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just super exciting that you were thinking like that,</p>
<p>especially at that stage as brilliant,</p>
<p>that testing was such a core part of it.</p>
<p>It may be to linger on the point of leadership.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the first times</p>
<p>you were really a leader</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve led many very successful teams since then.</p>
<p>What does it take to be a good leader?</p>
<p>I would say most of all, I just take credit.</p>
<p>I put the work of others, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very convenient turns out</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t do all these things myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer at heart.</p>
<p>So I care about engineering.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the chicken and the egg is,</p>
<p>but as a kid, I loved computers</p>
<p>because you could tell them to do something</p>
<p>and they actually did it.</p>
<p>It was very cool.</p>
<p>And you could like in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>wake up at one in the morning and switch on your computer.</p>
<p>And what he told you to yesterday, it would still do.</p>
<p>That was really cool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that didn&rsquo;t quite work with people.</p>
<p>So you go to people and tell them what to do</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And they hate you for it, or you do it today</p>
<p>and then you go a day later and they stop doing it.</p>
<p>So you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>So then the question really became,</p>
<p>how can you put yourself in the brain of people</p>
<p>as opposed to computers?</p>
<p>And in terms of computers, it&rsquo;s super dumb.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so dumb.</p>
<p>If people were as dumb as computers,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work with them.</p>
<p>But people are smart and people are emotional</p>
<p>and people have pride and people have aspirations.</p>
<p>So how can I connect to that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that most of our leadership just fails</p>
<p>because many, many engineers turn manager</p>
<p>believe they can treat their team just the same way</p>
<p>it can treat your computer.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&rsquo;t work this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really bad.</p>
<p>So how can I connect to people?</p>
<p>And it turns out as a college professor,</p>
<p>the wonderful thing you do all the time</p>
<p>is to empower other people.</p>
<p>Like your job is to make your students look great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the best coach.</p>
<p>And it turns out if you do a fantastic job with making</p>
<p>your students look great, they actually love you</p>
<p>and their parents love you.</p>
<p>And they give you all the credit for stuff you don&rsquo;t deserve.</p>
<p>All my students were smarter than me.</p>
<p>All the great stuff invented at Stanford</p>
<p>was their stuff, not my stuff.</p>
<p>And they give me credit and say, oh, Sebastian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just making them feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>So the question really is, can you take a team of people</p>
<p>and what does it take to make them</p>
<p>to connect to what they actually want in life</p>
<p>and turn this into productive action?</p>
<p>It turns out every human being that I know</p>
<p>has incredibly good intentions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really rarely met a person with bad intentions.</p>
<p>I believe every person wants to contribute.</p>
<p>I think every person I&rsquo;ve met wants to help others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much of an urge we have</p>
<p>not to just help ourselves, but to help others.</p>
<p>So how can we empower people and give them</p>
<p>the right framework that they can accomplish this?</p>
<p>In moments when it works, it&rsquo;s magical.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;d see the confluence of people</p>
<p>being able to make the world a better place</p>
<p>and deriving enormous confidence and pride out of this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when my environment works the best.</p>
<p>These are moments where I can disappear for a month</p>
<p>and come back and things still work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to accomplish.</p>
<p>But when it works, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So I agree with you very much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not often heard that most people in the world</p>
<p>have good intentions.</p>
<p>At the core, their intentions are good</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re good people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful message, it&rsquo;s not often heard.</p>
<p>We make this mistake, and this is a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Alex Werder, talking to us, that we judge ourselves</p>
<p>by our intentions and others by their actions.</p>
<p>And I think that the biggest skill,</p>
<p>I mean, here in Silicon Valley, we follow engineers</p>
<p>who have very little empathy and are kind of befuddled</p>
<p>by why it doesn&rsquo;t work for them.</p>
<p>The biggest skill, I think, that people should acquire</p>
<p>is to put themselves into the position of the other</p>
<p>and listen, and listen to what the other has to say.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be shocked how similar they are to themselves.</p>
<p>And they might even be shocked how their own actions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t reflect their intentions.</p>
<p>I often have conversations with engineers</p>
<p>where I say, look, hey, I love you, you&rsquo;re doing a great job.</p>
<p>And by the way, what you just did has the following effect.</p>
<p>Are you aware of that?</p>
<p>And then people would say, oh my God, not I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because my intention was that.</p>
<p>And I say, yeah, I trust your intention.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a good human being.</p>
<p>But just to help you in the future,</p>
<p>if you keep expressing it that way,</p>
<p>then people will just hate you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had many instances where people say,</p>
<p>oh my God, thank you for telling me this,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t my intention to look like an idiot.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t my intention to help other people.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>Very simple, by the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book, Dale Carnegie, 1936,</p>
<p>how to make friends and how to influence others.</p>
<p>Has the entire Bible, you just read it and you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>and you apply it every day.</p>
<p>And I wish I was good enough to apply it every day.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just simple things, right?</p>
<p>Like be positive, remember people&rsquo;s name, smile,</p>
<p>and eventually have empathy.</p>
<p>Really think that the person that you hate</p>
<p>and you think is an idiot,</p>
<p>is actually just like yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a person who&rsquo;s struggling, who means well,</p>
<p>and who might need help, and guess what, you need help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently spoken with Stephen Schwarzman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you know who that is, but.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>So, and he said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on my list.</p>
<p>On the list.</p>
<p>But he said, sort of to expand on what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>that one of the biggest things you can do</p>
<p>is hear people when they tell you what their problem is</p>
<p>and then help them with that problem.</p>
<p>He says, it&rsquo;s surprising how few people</p>
<p>actually listen to what troubles others.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s right there in front of you</p>
<p>and you can benefit the world the most.</p>
<p>And in fact, yourself and everybody around you</p>
<p>by just hearing the problems and solving them.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my little history of engineering.</p>
<p>That is, while I was engineering with computers,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care at all what the computer&rsquo;s problems were.</p>
<p>I just told them what to do and to do it.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&rsquo;t work this way with people.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work with me.</p>
<p>If you come to me and say, do A, I do the opposite.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s return to the comfortable world of engineering.</p>
<p>And can you tell me in broad strokes in how you see it?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re the core of starting it,</p>
<p>the core of driving it,</p>
<p>the technical evolution of autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>from the first DARPA Grand Challenge</p>
<p>to the incredible success we see with the program</p>
<p>you started with Google self driving car</p>
<p>and Waymo and the entire industry that sprung up</p>
<p>of different kinds of approaches, debates and so on.</p>
<p>Well, the idea of self driving car goes back to the 80s.</p>
<p>There was a team in Germany and another team</p>
<p>at Carnegie Mellon that did some very pioneering work.</p>
<p>But back in the day, I&rsquo;d say the computers were so deficient</p>
<p>that even the best professors and engineers in the world</p>
<p>basically stood no chance.</p>
<p>It then folded into a phase where the US government</p>
<p>spent at least half a billion dollars</p>
<p>that I could count on research projects.</p>
<p>But the way the procurement works,</p>
<p>a successful stack of paper describing lots of stuff</p>
<p>that no one&rsquo;s ever gonna read</p>
<p>was a successful product of a research project.</p>
<p>So we trained our researchers to produce lots of paper.</p>
<p>That all changed with the DARPA Grand Challenge.</p>
<p>And I really gotta credit the ingenious people at DARPA</p>
<p>and the US government and Congress</p>
<p>that took a complete new funding model where they said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not fund effort, let&rsquo;s fund outcomes.</p>
<p>And it sounds very trivial,</p>
<p>but there was no tax code that allowed</p>
<p>the use of congressional tax money for a price.</p>
<p>It was all effort based.</p>
<p>So if you put in a hundred hours in,</p>
<p>you could charge a hundred hours.</p>
<p>If you put in a thousand hours in,</p>
<p>you could build a thousand hours.</p>
<p>By changing the focus instead of making the price,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t pay you for development,</p>
<p>we pay for the accomplishment.</p>
<p>They drew in, they automatically drew out</p>
<p>all these contractors who are used to the drug</p>
<p>of getting money per hour.</p>
<p>And they drew in a whole bunch of new people.</p>
<p>And these people are mostly crazy people.</p>
<p>They were people who had a car and a computer</p>
<p>and they wanted to make a million bucks.</p>
<p>The million bucks was their visual price money,</p>
<p>it was then doubled.</p>
<p>And they felt if I put my computer in my car</p>
<p>and program it, I can be rich.</p>
<p>And that was so awesome.</p>
<p>Like half the teams, there was a team that was surfer dudes</p>
<p>and they had like two surfboards on their vehicle</p>
<p>and brought like these fashion girls, super cute girls,</p>
<p>like twin sisters.</p>
<p>And you could tell these guys were not your common</p>
<p>beltway bandit who gets all these big multimillion</p>
<p>and billion dollar countries from the US government.</p>
<p>And there was a great reset.</p>
<p>Universities moved in.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate at Stanford that I just received tenure</p>
<p>so I couldn&rsquo;t get fired no matter what I do,</p>
<p>otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>And I had enough money to finance this thing</p>
<p>and I was able to attract a lot of money from third parties.</p>
<p>And even car companies moved in.</p>
<p>They kind of moved in very quietly</p>
<p>because they were super scared to be embarrassed</p>
<p>that their car would flip over.</p>
<p>But Ford was there and Volkswagen was there</p>
<p>and a few others and GM was there.</p>
<p>So it kind of reset the entire landscape of people.</p>
<p>And if you look at who&rsquo;s a big name</p>
<p>in self driving cars today,</p>
<p>these were mostly people who participated</p>
<p>in those challenges.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Can you just comment quickly on your sense of lessons learned</p>
<p>from that kind of funding model</p>
<p>and the research that&rsquo;s going on in academia</p>
<p>in terms of producing papers,</p>
<p>is there something to be learned and scaled up bigger,</p>
<p>having these kinds of grand challenges</p>
<p>that could improve outcomes?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big believer in focusing</p>
<p>on kind of an end to end system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really big believer in systems building.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always built systems in my academic career,</p>
<p>even though I do a lot of math and abstract stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all derived from the idea</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s solve a real problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard for me to be an academic</p>
<p>and say, let me solve a component of a problem.</p>
<p>Like with someone there&rsquo;s fields like nonmonetary logic</p>
<p>or AI planning systems where people believe</p>
<p>that a certain style of problem solving</p>
<p>is the ultimate end objective.</p>
<p>And I would always turn it around and say,</p>
<p>hey, what problem would my grandmother care about</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t understand computer technology</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t wanna understand?</p>
<p>And how could I make her love what I do?</p>
<p>Because only then do I have an impact on the world.</p>
<p>I can easily impress my colleagues.</p>
<p>That is much easier,</p>
<p>but impressing my grandmother is very, very hard.</p>
<p>So I would always thought if I can build a self driving car</p>
<p>and my grandmother can use it</p>
<p>even after she loses her driving privileges</p>
<p>or children can use it,</p>
<p>or we save maybe a million lives a year,</p>
<p>that would be very impressive.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s so many problems like these,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a problem with curing cancer,</p>
<p>or whatever it is, live twice as long.</p>
<p>Once a problem is defined,</p>
<p>of course I can&rsquo;t solve it in its entirety.</p>
<p>Like it takes sometimes tens of thousands of people</p>
<p>to find a solution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you can fund an army of 10,000 at Stanford.</p>
<p>So you gotta build a prototype.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build a meaningful prototype.</p>
<p>And the DARPA Grand Challenge was beautiful</p>
<p>because it told me what this prototype had to do.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to think about what it had to do,</p>
<p>I just had to read the rules.</p>
<p>And that was really beautiful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s most beautiful,</p>
<p>you think what academia could aspire to</p>
<p>is to build a prototype that&rsquo;s the systems level,</p>
<p>that solves or gives you an inkling</p>
<p>that this problem could be solved with this prototype.</p>
<p>First of all, I wanna emphasize what academia really is.</p>
<p>And I think people misunderstand it.</p>
<p>First and foremost, academia is a way</p>
<p>to educate young people.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a professor is an educator.</p>
<p>No matter where you are at,</p>
<p>a small suburban college,</p>
<p>or whether you are a Harvard or Stanford professor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the way most people think of themselves</p>
<p>in academia because we have this kind of competition</p>
<p>going on for citations and publication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a measurable thing,</p>
<p>but that is secondary to the primary purpose</p>
<p>of educating people to think.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of research,</p>
<p>most of the great science,</p>
<p>the great research comes out of universities.</p>
<p>You can trace almost everything back,</p>
<p>including Google, to universities.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing really fundamentally broken here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good system.</p>
<p>And I think America has the finest university system</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>We can talk about reach</p>
<p>and how to reach people outside the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different topic,</p>
<p>but the system itself is a good system.</p>
<p>If I had one wish, I would say it&rsquo;d be really great</p>
<p>if there was more debate about</p>
<p>what the great big problems are in society</p>
<p>and focus on those.</p>
<p>And most of them are interdisciplinary.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s very easy to fall</p>
<p>into an interdisciplinary viewpoint</p>
<p>where your problem is dictated</p>
<p>by what your closest colleagues believe the problem is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to break out and say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s an entire new field of problems.</p>
<p>So to give an example,</p>
<p>prior to me working on self driving cars,</p>
<p>I was a roboticist and a machine learning expert.</p>
<p>And I wrote books on robotics,</p>
<p>something called probabilistic robotics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very methods driven kind of viewpoint of the world.</p>
<p>I built robots that acted in museums as tour guides,</p>
<p>that let children around.</p>
<p>It is something that at the time was moderately challenging.</p>
<p>When I started working on cars,</p>
<p>several colleagues told me,</p>
<p>Sebastian, you&rsquo;re destroying your career</p>
<p>because in our field of robotics,</p>
<p>cars are looked like as a gimmick</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not expressive enough.</p>
<p>They can only push the throttle and the brakes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dexterity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no complexity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too simple.</p>
<p>And no one came to me and said,</p>
<p>wow, if you solve that problem,</p>
<p>you can save a million lives, right?</p>
<p>Among all robotic problems that I&rsquo;ve seen in my life,</p>
<p>I would say the self driving car, transportation,</p>
<p>is the one that has the most hope for society.</p>
<p>So how come the robotics community wasn&rsquo;t all over the place?</p>
<p>And it was because we focused on methods and solutions</p>
<p>and not on problems.</p>
<p>Like if you go around today and ask your grandmother,</p>
<p>what bugs you?</p>
<p>What really makes you upset?</p>
<p>I challenge any academic to do this</p>
<p>and then realize how far your research</p>
<p>is probably away from that today.</p>
<p>At the very least, that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>for academics to deliberate on.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s really nice in Silicon Valley is,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is full of smart people outside academia.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the Larry Pages and Mark Zuckerbergs in the world</p>
<p>who are anywhere smarter, smarter</p>
<p>than the best academics I&rsquo;ve met in my life.</p>
<p>And what they do is they are at a different level.</p>
<p>They build the systems,</p>
<p>they build the customer facing systems,</p>
<p>they build things that people can use</p>
<p>without technical education.</p>
<p>And they are inspired by research.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inspired by scientists.</p>
<p>They hire the best PhDs from the best universities</p>
<p>for a reason.</p>
<p>So I think this kind of vertical integration</p>
<p>between the real product, the real impact</p>
<p>and the real thought, the real ideas,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually working surprisingly well in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It did not work as well in other places in this nation.</p>
<p>So when I worked at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>we had the world&rsquo;s finest computer science university,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t those people in Pittsburgh</p>
<p>that would be able to take these</p>
<p>very fine computer science ideas</p>
<p>and turn them into massive, impactful products.</p>
<p>That symbiosis seemed to exist</p>
<p>pretty much only in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and maybe a bit in Boston and Austin.</p>
<p>Yeah, with Stanford, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So if we look a little bit further on</p>
<p>from the DARPA Grand Challenge</p>
<p>and the launch of the Google self driving car,</p>
<p>what do you see as the state,</p>
<p>the challenges of autonomous vehicles as they are now</p>
<p>is actually achieving that huge scale</p>
<p>and having a huge impact on society?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what has been accomplished.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m taking a lot of credit for the work of others.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually very optimistic.</p>
<p>And people have been kind of worrying,</p>
<p>is it too fast? Is it too slow?</p>
<p>Why is it not there yet? And so on.</p>
<p>It is actually quite an interesting, hard problem.</p>
<p>And in that a self driving car,</p>
<p>to build one that manages 90% of the problems</p>
<p>encountered in everyday driving is easy.</p>
<p>We can literally do this over a weekend.</p>
<p>To do 99% might take a month.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s 1% left.</p>
<p>So 1% would mean that you still have a fatal accident</p>
<p>every week, very unacceptable.</p>
<p>So now you work on this 1%</p>
<p>and the 99% of that, the remaining 1%</p>
<p>is actually still relatively easy,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re down to like a hundredth of 1%.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still completely unacceptable in terms of safety.</p>
<p>So the variety of things you encounter are just enormous.</p>
<p>And that gives me enormous respect for human being</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to deal with the couch on the highway,</p>
<p>or the deer in the headlights, or the blown tire</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never been trained for.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden have to handle it</p>
<p>in an emergency situation</p>
<p>and often do very, very successfully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing from that perspective,</p>
<p>how safe driving actually is given how many millions</p>
<p>of miles we drive every year in this country.</p>
<p>We are now at a point where I believe the technology</p>
<p>is there and I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it in Waymo, I&rsquo;ve seen it in Aptiv,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it in Cruise and in a number of companies</p>
<p>and in Voyage where vehicles now driving around</p>
<p>and basically flawlessly are able to drive people around</p>
<p>in limited scenarios.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go to Vegas today</p>
<p>and order a Summon and Lift.</p>
<p>And if you get the right setting of your app,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be picked up by a driverless car.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s still safety drivers in there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a fantastic way to kind of learn</p>
<p>what the limits are of technology today.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still some glitches,</p>
<p>but the glitches have become very, very rare.</p>
<p>I think the next step is gonna be to down cost it,</p>
<p>to harden it, the entrapment, the sensors</p>
<p>are not quite an automotive grade standard yet.</p>
<p>And then to really build the business models,</p>
<p>to really kind of go somewhere and make the business case.</p>
<p>And the business case is hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, oh my God, we have this capability,</p>
<p>people are just gonna buy it.</p>
<p>You have to make it affordable.</p>
<p>You have to find the social acceptance of people.</p>
<p>None of the teams yet has been able to or gutsy enough</p>
<p>to drive around without a person inside the car.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the next magical hurdle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be able to send these vehicles around</p>
<p>completely empty in traffic.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, I wait every day,</p>
<p>wait for the news that Waymo has just done this.</p>
<p>So, interesting you mentioned gutsy.</p>
<p>Let me ask some maybe unanswerable question,</p>
<p>maybe edgy questions.</p>
<p>But in terms of how much risk is required,</p>
<p>some guts in terms of leadership style,</p>
<p>it would be good to contrast approaches.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But if we compare Tesla and Waymo, for example,</p>
<p>Elon Musk and the Waymo team,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s slight differences in approach.</p>
<p>So on the Elon side, there&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word to use,</p>
<p>but aggression in terms of innovation.</p>
<p>And on Waymo side, there&rsquo;s more sort of cautious,</p>
<p>safety focused approach to the problem.</p>
<p>What do you think it takes?</p>
<p>What leadership at which moment is right?</p>
<p>Which approach is right?</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t sit in either of those teams.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m unable to even verify like somebody says correct.</p>
<p>In the end of the day, every innovator in that space</p>
<p>will face a fundamental dilemma.</p>
<p>And I would say you could put aerospace titans</p>
<p>into the same bucket,</p>
<p>which is you have to balance public safety</p>
<p>with your drive to innovate.</p>
<p>And this country in particular in the States</p>
<p>has a hundred plus year history</p>
<p>of doing this very successfully.</p>
<p>Air travel is what a hundred times a safe per mile</p>
<p>than ground travel, than cars.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason for it because people have found ways</p>
<p>to be very methodological about ensuring public safety</p>
<p>while still being able to make progress</p>
<p>on important aspects, for example,</p>
<p>like air and noise and fuel consumption.</p>
<p>So I think that those practices are proven</p>
<p>and they actually work.</p>
<p>We live in a world safer than ever before.</p>
<p>And yes, there will always be the provision</p>
<p>that something goes wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the possibility</p>
<p>that someone makes a mistake</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s an unexpected failure.</p>
<p>We can never guarantee to a hundred percent</p>
<p>absolute safety other than just not doing it.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m very proud of the history of the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve dealt with much more dangerous technology</p>
<p>like nuclear energy and kept that safe too.</p>
<p>We have nuclear weapons and we keep those safe.</p>
<p>So we have methods and procedures</p>
<p>that really balance these two things very, very successfully.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned a lot of great autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>that are taking sort of the level four, level five,</p>
<p>they jump in full autonomy with a safety driver</p>
<p>and take that kind of approach</p>
<p>and also through simulation and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the approach that Tesla Autopilot is doing,</p>
<p>which is kind of incrementally taking a level two vehicle</p>
<p>and using machine learning</p>
<p>and learning from the driving of human beings</p>
<p>and trying to creep up,</p>
<p>trying to incrementally improve the system</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s able to achieve level four autonomy.</p>
<p>So perfect autonomy in certain kind of geographical regions.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on these contrasting approaches?</p>
<p>Well, so first of all, I&rsquo;m a very proud Tesla owner</p>
<p>and I literally use the Autopilot every day</p>
<p>and it literally has kept me safe.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful technology specifically</p>
<p>for highway driving when I&rsquo;m slightly tired</p>
<p>because then it turns me into a much safer driver.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m 100% confident that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>In terms of the right approach,</p>
<p>I think the biggest change I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>since I went to Waymo team is this thing called deep learning.</p>
<p>I think deep learning was not a hot topic</p>
<p>when I started Waymo or Google self driving cars.</p>
<p>It was there, in fact, we started Google Brain</p>
<p>at the same time in Google X.</p>
<p>So I invested in deep learning,</p>
<p>but people didn&rsquo;t talk about it, it wasn&rsquo;t a hot topic.</p>
<p>And now it is, there&rsquo;s a shift of emphasis</p>
<p>from a more geometric perspective</p>
<p>where you use geometric sensors</p>
<p>that give you a full 3D view</p>
<p>when you do a geometric reasoning about,</p>
<p>oh, this box over here might be a car</p>
<p>towards a more human like, oh, let&rsquo;s just learn about it.</p>
<p>This looks like the thing I&rsquo;ve seen 10,000 times before.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s the same thing, machine learning perspective.</p>
<p>And that has really put, I think,</p>
<p>all these approaches on steroids.</p>
<p>At Udacity, we teach a course in self driving cars.</p>
<p>In fact, I think we&rsquo;ve graduated over 20,000 or so people</p>
<p>on self driving car skills.</p>
<p>So every self driving car team in the world</p>
<p>now uses our engineers.</p>
<p>And in this course, the very first homework assignment</p>
<p>is to do lane finding on images.</p>
<p>And lane finding images for layman,</p>
<p>what this means is you put a camera into your car</p>
<p>or you open your eyes and you would know where the lane is.</p>
<p>So you can stay inside the lane with your car.</p>
<p>Humans can do this super easily.</p>
<p>You just look and you know where the lane is,</p>
<p>just intuitively.</p>
<p>For machines, for a long time, it was super hard</p>
<p>because people would write these kind of crazy rules.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s like wine lane markers</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what white really means,</p>
<p>this is not quite white enough.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, oh, it&rsquo;s not white.</p>
<p>Or maybe the sun is shining.</p>
<p>So when the sun shines and this is white</p>
<p>and this is a straight line,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not quite a straight line</p>
<p>because the road is curved.</p>
<p>And do we know that there&rsquo;s really six feet</p>
<p>between lane markings or not or 12 feet, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And now what the students are doing,</p>
<p>they would take machine learning.</p>
<p>So instead of like writing these crazy rules</p>
<p>for the lane marker,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, hey, let&rsquo;s take an hour of driving</p>
<p>and label it and tell the vehicle,</p>
<p>this is actually the lane by hand.</p>
<p>And then these are examples</p>
<p>and have the machine find its own rules,</p>
<p>what lane markings are.</p>
<p>And within 24 hours, now every student</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never done any programming before in this space</p>
<p>can write a perfect lane finder</p>
<p>as good as the best commercial lane finders.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s completely amazing to me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen progress using machine learning</p>
<p>that completely dwarfs anything</p>
<p>that I saw 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just as a side note,</p>
<p>the self driving car nanodegree,</p>
<p>the fact that you launched that many years ago now,</p>
<p>maybe four years ago, three years ago is incredible</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a great example of system level thinking</p>
<p>sort of just taking an entire course</p>
<p>that teaches you how to solve the entire problem.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become super popular</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s become actually incredibly high quality</p>
<p>really with Mercedes and various other companies</p>
<p>in that space.</p>
<p>And we find that engineers from Tesla and Waymo</p>
<p>are taking it today.</p>
<p>The insight was that two things,</p>
<p>one is existing universities will be very slow to move</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re departmentalized</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no department for self driving cars.</p>
<p>So between Mac E and double E and computer science,</p>
<p>getting those folks together</p>
<p>into one room is really, really hard.</p>
<p>And every professor listening here will know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll probably agree to that.</p>
<p>And secondly, even if all the great universities</p>
<p>just did this, which none so far has developed</p>
<p>a curriculum in this field,</p>
<p>it is just a few thousand students that can partake</p>
<p>because all the great universities are super selective.</p>
<p>So how about people in India?</p>
<p>How about people in China or in the Middle East</p>
<p>or Indonesia or Africa?</p>
<p>Why should those be excluded</p>
<p>from the skill of building self driving cars?</p>
<p>Are they any dumber than we are?</p>
<p>Are we any less privileged?</p>
<p>And the answer is we should just give everybody the skill</p>
<p>to build a self driving car.</p>
<p>Because if we do this,</p>
<p>then we have like a thousand self driving car startups.</p>
<p>And if 10% succeed, that&rsquo;s like a hundred,</p>
<p>that means hundred countries now</p>
<p>will have self driving cars and be safer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to imagine impossible to quantify,</p>
<p>but the number, the, you know,</p>
<p>over a period of several decades,</p>
<p>the impact that has like a single course,</p>
<p>like a ripple effect of society.</p>
<p>If you, I just recently talked to Andrew</p>
<p>who was creator of Cosmos show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>how many scientists that show launched.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really, in terms of impact,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a better course</p>
<p>than the self driving car course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s other more specific disciplines</p>
<p>like deep learning and so on that Udacity is also teaching,</p>
<p>but self driving cars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, really interesting course.</p>
<p>And then it came at the right moment.</p>
<p>It came at a time when there were a bunch of Acqui hires.</p>
<p>Acqui hire is a acquisition of a company,</p>
<p>not for its technology or its products or business,</p>
<p>but for its people.</p>
<p>So Acqui hire means maybe that a company of 70 people,</p>
<p>they have no product yet, but they&rsquo;re super smart people</p>
<p>and they pay a certain amount of money.</p>
<p>So I took Acqui hires like GM Cruise and Uber and others,</p>
<p>and did the math and said,</p>
<p>hey, how many people are there and how much money was paid?</p>
<p>And as a lower bound,</p>
<p>I estimated the value of a self driving car engineer</p>
<p>in these acquisitions to be at least $10 million, right?</p>
<p>So think about this, you get yourself a skill</p>
<p>and you team up and build a company</p>
<p>and your worth now is $10 million.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>I mean, what other thing could you do in life</p>
<p>to be worth $10 million within a year?</p>
<p>Yeah, amazing.</p>
<p>But to come back for a moment on to deep learning</p>
<p>and its application in autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on Elon Musk&rsquo;s statement,</p>
<p>provocative statement, perhaps that light air is a crutch.</p>
<p>So this geometric way of thinking about the world</p>
<p>may be holding us back if what we should instead be doing</p>
<p>in this robotic space,</p>
<p>in this particular space of autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>is using camera as a primary sensor</p>
<p>and using computer vision and machine learning</p>
<p>as the primary way to&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, I have two comments.</p>
<p>I think first of all, we all know</p>
<p>that people can drive cars without lighters in their heads</p>
<p>because we only have eyes</p>
<p>and we mostly just use eyes for driving.</p>
<p>Maybe we use some other perception about our bodies,</p>
<p>accelerations, occasionally our ears,</p>
<p>certainly not our noses.</p>
<p>So the existence proof is there,</p>
<p>that eyes must be sufficient.</p>
<p>In fact, we could even drive a car</p>
<p>if someone put a camera out</p>
<p>and then gave us the camera image with no latency,</p>
<p>we would be able to drive a car that way the same way.</p>
<p>So a camera is also sufficient.</p>
<p>Secondly, I really love the idea that in the Western world,</p>
<p>we have many, many different people</p>
<p>trying different hypotheses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an anthill,</p>
<p>like if an anthill tries to forge for food,</p>
<p>you can sit there as two ants</p>
<p>and agree what the perfect path is</p>
<p>and then every single ant marches</p>
<p>for the most likely location of food is,</p>
<p>or you can even just spread out.</p>
<p>And I promise you the spread out solution will be better</p>
<p>because if the discussing philosophical,</p>
<p>intellectual ants get it wrong</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all moving the wrong direction,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to waste a day</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re going to discuss again for another week.</p>
<p>Whereas if all these ants go in a random direction,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to succeed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to come back and claim victory</p>
<p>and get the Nobel prize or whatever the ant equivalent is.</p>
<p>And then they all march in the same direction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great about society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great about the Western society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not plan based, we&rsquo;re not central based.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a Soviet Union style central government</p>
<p>that tells us where to forge.</p>
<p>We just forge.</p>
<p>We started in C Corp.</p>
<p>We get investor money, go out and try it out.</p>
<p>And who knows who&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>In your, when you look at the longterm vision</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>do you see machine learning</p>
<p>as fundamentally being able to solve most of the problems?</p>
<p>So learning from experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say we should be very clear</p>
<p>about what machine learning is and is not.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>What it is today is a technology</p>
<p>that can go through large databases</p>
<p>of repetitive patterns and find those patterns.</p>
<p>So in example, we did a study at Stanford two years ago</p>
<p>where we applied machine learning</p>
<p>to detecting skin cancer in images.</p>
<p>And we harvested or built a data set</p>
<p>of 129,000 skin photo shots</p>
<p>that were all had been biopsied</p>
<p>for what the actual situation was.</p>
<p>And those included melanomas and carcinomas,</p>
<p>also included rashes and other skin conditions, lesions.</p>
<p>And then we had a network find those patterns.</p>
<p>And it was by and large able to then detect skin cancer</p>
<p>with an iPhone as accurately</p>
<p>as the best board certified Stanford level dermatologist.</p>
<p>We proved that.</p>
<p>Now this thing was great in this one thing</p>
<p>and finding skin cancer, but it couldn&rsquo;t drive a car.</p>
<p>So the difference to human intelligence</p>
<p>is we do all these many, many things</p>
<p>and we can often learn from a very small data set</p>
<p>of experiences.</p>
<p>Whereas machines still need very large data sets</p>
<p>and things that will be very repetitive.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s still super impactful</p>
<p>because almost everything we do is repetitive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna really transform human labor</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not this almighty general intelligence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really far away from a system</p>
<p>that will exhibit general intelligence.</p>
<p>To that end, I actually commiserate the naming a little bit</p>
<p>because artificial intelligence, if you believe Hollywood</p>
<p>is immediately mixed into the idea of human suppression</p>
<p>and machine superiority.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re gonna see this in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think human suppression is a good idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it coming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the technology being there.</p>
<p>What I see instead is a very pointed focused</p>
<p>pattern recognition technology that&rsquo;s able to</p>
<p>extract patterns from large data sets.</p>
<p>And in doing so, it can be super impactful.</p>
<p>Super impactful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the impact of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>on human work.</p>
<p>We all know that it takes something like 10,000 hours</p>
<p>to become an expert.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna be a doctor or a lawyer</p>
<p>or even a really good driver,</p>
<p>it takes a certain amount of time to become experts.</p>
<p>Machines now are able and have been shown</p>
<p>to observe people become experts and observe experts</p>
<p>and then extract those rules from experts</p>
<p>in some interesting way.</p>
<p>They could go from law to sales to driving cars</p>
<p>to diagnosing cancer.</p>
<p>And then giving that capability to people who are</p>
<p>completely new in their job.</p>
<p>We now can, and that&rsquo;s been done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been done commercially in many, many instantiations.</p>
<p>So that means we can use machine learning</p>
<p>to make people expert on the very first day of their work.</p>
<p>Like think about the impact.</p>
<p>If your doctor is still in their first 10,000 hours,</p>
<p>you have a doctor who is not quite an expert yet.</p>
<p>Who would not want a doctor who is the world&rsquo;s best expert?</p>
<p>And now we can leverage machines to really eradicate</p>
<p>the error in decision making,</p>
<p>error and lack of expertise for human doctors.</p>
<p>That could save your life.</p>
<p>If we can link on that for a little bit,</p>
<p>in which way do you hope machines in the medical field</p>
<p>could help assist doctors?</p>
<p>You mentioned this sort of accelerating the learning curve</p>
<p>or people, if they start a job or in the first 10,000 hours</p>
<p>can be assisted by machines.</p>
<p>How do you envision that assistance looking?</p>
<p>So we built this app for an iPhone that can detect</p>
<p>and classify and diagnose skin cancer.</p>
<p>And we proved two years ago that it does pretty much</p>
<p>as good or better than the best human doctors.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a story.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a friend of mine, let&rsquo;s call him Ben.</p>
<p>Ben is a very famous venture capitalist.</p>
<p>He goes to his doctor and the doctor looks at a mole</p>
<p>and says, hey, that mole is probably harmless.</p>
<p>And for some very funny reason, he pulls out that phone</p>
<p>with our app.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a collaborator in our study.</p>
<p>And the app says, no, no, no, no, this is a melanoma.</p>
<p>And for background, melanomas are,</p>
<p>and skin cancer is the most common cancer in this country.</p>
<p>Melanomas can go from stage zero to stage four</p>
<p>within less than a year.</p>
<p>Stage zero means you can basically cut it out yourself</p>
<p>with a kitchen knife and be safe.</p>
<p>And stage four means your chances of living</p>
<p>five more years in less than 20%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very serious, serious, serious condition.</p>
<p>So this doctor who took out the iPhone,</p>
<p>looked at the iPhone and was a little bit puzzled.</p>
<p>He said, I mean, but just to be safe,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s cut it out and biopsy it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the technical term for let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>an in depth diagnostics that is more than just looking at it.</p>
<p>And it came back as cancerous, as a melanoma.</p>
<p>And it was then removed.</p>
<p>And my friend, Ben, I was hiking with him</p>
<p>and we were talking about AI.</p>
<p>And I told him I do this work on skin cancer.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, funny.</p>
<p>My doctor just had an iPhone that found my cancer.</p>
<p>So I was like completely intrigued.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know about this.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a person, I mean, this is a real human life, right?</p>
<p>Like who doesn&rsquo;t know somebody</p>
<p>who has been affected by cancer.</p>
<p>Cancer is cause of death number two.</p>
<p>Cancer is this kind of disease that is mean</p>
<p>in the following way.</p>
<p>Most cancers can actually be cured relatively easily</p>
<p>if we catch them early.</p>
<p>And the reason why we don&rsquo;t tend to catch them early</p>
<p>is because they have no symptoms.</p>
<p>Like your very first symptom of a gallbladder cancer</p>
<p>or a pancreas cancer might be a headache.</p>
<p>And when you finally go to your doctor</p>
<p>because of these headaches or your back pain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being imaged, it&rsquo;s usually stage four plus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the time when the occurring chances</p>
<p>might be dropped to a single digit percentage.</p>
<p>So if we could leverage AI to inspect your body</p>
<p>on a regular basis without even a doctor in the room,</p>
<p>maybe when you take a shower or what have you,</p>
<p>I know this sounds creepy,</p>
<p>but then we might be able to save millions</p>
<p>and millions of lives.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned there&rsquo;s a concern that people have</p>
<p>about near term impacts of AI in terms of job loss.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned being able to assist doctors,</p>
<p>being able to assist people in their jobs.</p>
<p>Do you have a worry of people losing their jobs</p>
<p>or the economy being affected by the improvements in AI?</p>
<p>Yeah, anybody concerned about job losses,</p>
<p>please come to Gdacity.com.</p>
<p>We teach contemporary tech skills</p>
<p>and we have a kind of implicit job promise.</p>
<p>We often, when we measure,</p>
<p>we spend way over 50% of our graders in new jobs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very satisfied about it.</p>
<p>And it costs almost nothing,</p>
<p>costs like 1,500 max or something like that.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a cool new program</p>
<p>that you agree with the U.S. government,</p>
<p>guaranteeing that you will help us give scholarships</p>
<p>that educate people in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re working with the U.S. government</p>
<p>on the idea of basically rebuilding the American dream.</p>
<p>So Gdacity has just dedicated 100,000 scholarships</p>
<p>for citizens of America for various levels of courses</p>
<p>that eventually will get you a job.</p>
<p>And those courses are all somewhat related</p>
<p>to the tech sector because the tech sector</p>
<p>is kind of the hottest sector right now.</p>
<p>And they range from interlevel digital marketing</p>
<p>to very advanced self diving car engineering.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing this with the White House</p>
<p>because we think it&rsquo;s bipartisan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue that if you wanna really make America great,</p>
<p>being able to be a part of the solution</p>
<p>and live the American dream requires us to be proactive</p>
<p>about our education and our skillset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way it is today.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always been this way.</p>
<p>And we always had this American dream</p>
<p>to send our kids to college.</p>
<p>And now the American dream has to be</p>
<p>to send ourselves to college.</p>
<p>We can do this very, very, very efficiently</p>
<p>and very, very, we can squeeze in in the evenings</p>
<p>and things to online.</p>
<p>So at all ages.</p>
<p>All ages.</p>
<p>So our learners go from age 11 to age 80.</p>
<p>I just traveled Germany and the guy in the train compartment</p>
<p>next to me was one of my students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Think about impact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve become the educator of choice for now,</p>
<p>I believe officially six countries or five countries.</p>
<p>Most in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia and in Egypt.</p>
<p>In Egypt, we just had a cohort graduate</p>
<p>where we had 1100 high school students</p>
<p>that went through programming skills,</p>
<p>proficient at the level of a computer science undergrad.</p>
<p>And we had a 95% graduation rate,</p>
<p>even though everything&rsquo;s online, it&rsquo;s kind of tough,</p>
<p>but we kind of trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to make this effective.</p>
<p>The vision is very, very simple.</p>
<p>The vision is education ought to be a basic human right.</p>
<p>It cannot be locked up behind ivory tower walls</p>
<p>only for the rich people, for the parents</p>
<p>who might be bribe themselves into the system.</p>
<p>And only for young people and only for people</p>
<p>from the right demographics and the right geography</p>
<p>and possibly even the right race.</p>
<p>It has to be opened up to everybody.</p>
<p>If we are truthful to the human mission,</p>
<p>if we are truthful to our values,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna open up education to everybody in the world.</p>
<p>So Udacity&rsquo;s pledge of 100,000 scholarships,</p>
<p>I think is the biggest pledge of scholarships ever</p>
<p>in terms of numbers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re working, as I said, with the White House</p>
<p>and with very accomplished CEOs like Tim Cook</p>
<p>from Apple and others to really bring education</p>
<p>to everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Not to ask you to pick the favorite of your children,</p>
<p>but at this point.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s Jasper.</p>
<p>I only have one that I know of.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>In this particular moment, what nano degree,</p>
<p>what set of courses are you most excited about at Udacity</p>
<p>or is that too impossible to pick?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been super excited about something</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t launched yet in the building,</p>
<p>which is when we talk to our partner companies,</p>
<p>we have now a very strong footing in the enterprise world.</p>
<p>And also to our students,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of always focused on these hard skills,</p>
<p>like the programming skills or math skills</p>
<p>or building skills or design skills.</p>
<p>And a very common ask is soft skills.</p>
<p>Like how do you behave in your work?</p>
<p>How do you develop empathy?</p>
<p>How do you work on a team?</p>
<p>What are the very basics of management?</p>
<p>How do you do time management?</p>
<p>How do you advance your career</p>
<p>in the context of a broader community?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we haven&rsquo;t done very well</p>
<p>at Udacity and I would say most universities</p>
<p>are doing very poorly as well</p>
<p>because we are so obsessed with individual test scores</p>
<p>and pays a little attention to teamwork in education.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something I see us moving into as a company</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m excited about this.</p>
<p>And I think, look, we can teach people tech skills</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be great.</p>
<p>But if you teach people empathy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna have the same impact.</p>
<p>Maybe harder than self driving cars, but.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think the rules are really simple.</p>
<p>You just have to, you have to want to engage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we literally went in school and in K through 12,</p>
<p>we teach kids like get the highest math score.</p>
<p>And if you are a rational human being,</p>
<p>you might evolve from this education say,</p>
<p>having the best math score and the best English scores</p>
<p>make me the best leader.</p>
<p>And it turns out not to be that case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really wrong because making the,</p>
<p>first of all, in terms of math scores,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to hire somebody</p>
<p>with great math skills.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>You can hire someone with good empathy for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much harder,</p>
<p>but you can always hire someone with great math skills.</p>
<p>But we live in an affluent world</p>
<p>where we constantly deal with other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a nuisance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beauty.</p>
<p>So if we somehow develop that muscle</p>
<p>that we can do that well and empower others</p>
<p>in the workplace, I think we&rsquo;re gonna be super successful.</p>
<p>And I know many fellow robot assistant computer scientists</p>
<p>that I will insist to take this course.</p>
<p>Not to be named here.</p>
<p>Not to be named.</p>
<p>Many, many years ago, 1903,</p>
<p>the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk for the first time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve launched a company of the same name, Kitty Hawk,</p>
<p>with the dream of building flying cars, eVTOLs.</p>
<p>So at the big picture,</p>
<p>what are the big challenges of making this thing</p>
<p>that actually have inspired generations of people</p>
<p>about what the future looks like?</p>
<p>What does it take?</p>
<p>What are the biggest challenges?</p>
<p>So flying cars has always been a dream.</p>
<p>Every boy, every girl wants to fly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go back in our history</p>
<p>of your dreaming of flying.</p>
<p>I think honestly, my single most remembered childhood dream</p>
<p>has been a dream where I was sitting on a pillow</p>
<p>and I could fly.</p>
<p>I was like five years old.</p>
<p>I remember like maybe three dreams of my childhood,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the one I remember most vividly.</p>
<p>And then Peter Thiel famously said,</p>
<p>they promised us flying cars</p>
<p>and they gave us 140 characters pointing as Twitter</p>
<p>at the time, limited message size to 140 characters.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re coming back now to really go</p>
<p>for these super impactful stuff like flying cars</p>
<p>and to be precise, they&rsquo;re not really cars.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have wheels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually much closer to a helicopter</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>They take off vertically and they fly horizontally,</p>
<p>but they have important differences.</p>
<p>One difference is that they are much quieter.</p>
<p>We just released a vehicle called Project Heaviside</p>
<p>that can fly over you as low as a helicopter</p>
<p>and you basically can&rsquo;t hear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 38 decibels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you were inside the library,</p>
<p>you might be able to hear it,</p>
<p>but anywhere outdoors, your ambient noise is higher.</p>
<p>Secondly, they&rsquo;re much more affordable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more affordable than helicopters.</p>
<p>And the reason is helicopters are expensive</p>
<p>for many reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of single point of figures in a helicopter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bolt between the blades</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caused Jesus bolt.</p>
<p>And the reason why it&rsquo;s called Jesus bolt</p>
<p>is that if this bolt breaks, you will die.</p>
<p>There is no second solution in helicopter flight.</p>
<p>Whereas we have these distributed mechanism.</p>
<p>When you go from gasoline to electric,</p>
<p>you can now have many, many, many small motors</p>
<p>as opposed to one big motor.</p>
<p>And that means if you lose one of those motors,</p>
<p>not a big deal.</p>
<p>Heaviside, if it loses a motor, has eight of those.</p>
<p>If it loses one of those eight motors,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s seven left, it can take off just like before</p>
<p>and land just like before.</p>
<p>We are now also moving into a technology</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require a commercial pilot</p>
<p>because in some level,</p>
<p>flight is actually easier than ground transportation</p>
<p>like in self driving cars.</p>
<p>The world is full of like children and bicycles</p>
<p>and other cars and mailboxes and curbs and shrubs</p>
<p>and what have you.</p>
<p>All these things you have to avoid.</p>
<p>When you go above the buildings and tree lines,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do the test right now,</p>
<p>look outside and count the number of things you see flying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be shocked if you could see more than two things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just zero.</p>
<p>In the Bay Area, the most I&rsquo;ve ever seen was six.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s 15 or 20,</p>
<p>but not 10,000.</p>
<p>So the sky is very ample and very empty and very free.</p>
<p>So the vision is, can we build a socially acceptable</p>
<p>mass transit solution for daily transportation</p>
<p>that is affordable?</p>
<p>And we have an existence proof.</p>
<p>Heaviside can fly 100 miles in range</p>
<p>with still 30% electric reserves.</p>
<p>It can fly up to like 180 miles an hour.</p>
<p>We know that that solution at scale</p>
<p>would make your ground transportation</p>
<p>10 times as fast as a car</p>
<p>based on use census or statistics data,</p>
<p>which means you would take your 300 hours of daily,</p>
<p>of yearly commute down to 30 hours</p>
<p>and give you 270 hours back.</p>
<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t want, I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t hate traffic?</p>
<p>Like I hate, give me the person that doesn&rsquo;t hate traffic.</p>
<p>I hate traffic.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m in traffic, I hate it.</p>
<p>And if we could free the world from traffic,</p>
<p>we have technology.</p>
<p>We can free the world from traffic.</p>
<p>We have the technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>We have an existence proof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a technological problem anymore.</p>
<p>Do you think there is a future where tens of thousands,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of thousands of both delivery drones</p>
<p>and flying cars of this kind, EV talls fill the sky?</p>
<p>I absolutely believe this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s obviously the societal acceptance</p>
<p>is a major question.</p>
<p>And of course, safety is.</p>
<p>I believe in safety,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna exceed ground transportation safety</p>
<p>as has happened for aviation already, commercial aviation.</p>
<p>And in terms of acceptance,</p>
<p>I think one of the key things is noise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are focusing relentlessly on noise</p>
<p>and we build perhaps the quietest electric vehicle</p>
<p>ever built.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the sky is it&rsquo;s three dimensional.</p>
<p>So any mathematician will immediately recognize</p>
<p>the difference between 1D of like a regular highway</p>
<p>to 3D of a sky.</p>
<p>But to make it clear for the layman,</p>
<p>say you wanna make 100 vertical lanes</p>
<p>of highway 101 in San Francisco,</p>
<p>because you believe building 100 vertical lanes</p>
<p>is the right solution.</p>
<p>Imagine how much it would cost to stack 100 vertical lanes</p>
<p>physically onto 101.</p>
<p>That would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>That would be consuming the world&rsquo;s GDP for an entire year</p>
<p>just for one highway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazingly expensive.</p>
<p>In the sky, it would just be a recompilation</p>
<p>of a piece of software because all these lanes are virtual.</p>
<p>That means any vehicle that is in conflict</p>
<p>with another vehicle would just go to different altitudes</p>
<p>and then the conflict is gone.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t believe this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly how commercial aviation works.</p>
<p>When you fly from New York to San Francisco,</p>
<p>another plane flies from San Francisco to New York,</p>
<p>they are different altitudes.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t hit each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a solved problem for the jet space</p>
<p>and it will be a solved problem for the urban space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s companies like Google Wing and Amazon</p>
<p>working on very innovative solutions.</p>
<p>How do we have space management?</p>
<p>They use exactly the same principles as we use today</p>
<p>to route today&rsquo;s jets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing hard about this.</p>
<p>Do you envision autonomy being a key part of it</p>
<p>so that the flying vehicles are either semi autonomous</p>
<p>semi autonomous or fully autonomous?</p>
<p>100% autonomous.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want idiots like me flying in the sky,</p>
<p>I promise you.</p>
<p>And if you have 10,000,</p>
<p>watch the movie, The Fifth Element</p>
<p>to get a feel for what will happen if it&rsquo;s not autonomous.</p>
<p>And a centralized, that&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>of a centralized sort of management system</p>
<p>for lanes and so on.</p>
<p>So actually just being able to have</p>
<p>similar as we have in the current commercial aviation,</p>
<p>but scale it up to much, much more vehicles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting optimization problem.</p>
<p>It is very mathematically, very, very straightforward.</p>
<p>Like the gap we leave between jets is gargantuous.</p>
<p>And part of the reason is there isn&rsquo;t that many jets.</p>
<p>So it just feels like a good solution.</p>
<p>Today, when you get vectored by air traffic control,</p>
<p>someone talks to you, right?</p>
<p>So any ATC controller might have up to maybe 20 planes</p>
<p>on the same frequency.</p>
<p>And then they talk to you, you have to talk back.</p>
<p>And it feels right because there isn&rsquo;t more than 20 planes</p>
<p>around anyhow, so you can talk to everybody.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s 20,000 things around,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t talk to everybody anymore.</p>
<p>So we have to do something that&rsquo;s called digital,</p>
<p>like text messaging.</p>
<p>Like we do have solutions.</p>
<p>Like we have what, four or five billion smartphones</p>
<p>in the world now, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>And somehow we solve the scale problem for smartphones.</p>
<p>We know where they all are.</p>
<p>They can talk to somebody and they&rsquo;re very reliable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazingly reliable.</p>
<p>We could use the same system,</p>
<p>the same scale for air traffic control.</p>
<p>So instead of me as a pilot talking to a human being</p>
<p>and in the middle of the conversation</p>
<p>receiving a new frequency, like how ancient is that?</p>
<p>We could digitize this stuff</p>
<p>and digitally transmit the right flight coordinates.</p>
<p>And that solution will automatically scale</p>
<p>to 10,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>We talked about empathy a little bit.</p>
<p>Do you think we will one day build an AI system</p>
<p>that a human being can love</p>
<p>and that loves that human back, like in the movie, Her?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m a pragmatist.</p>
<p>For me, AI is a tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a shovel.</p>
<p>And the ethics of using the shovel are always</p>
<p>with us, the people.</p>
<p>And it has to be this way.</p>
<p>In terms of emotions,</p>
<p>I would hate to come into my kitchen</p>
<p>and see that my refrigerator spoiled all my food,</p>
<p>then have it explained to me</p>
<p>that it fell in love with the dishwasher</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t as nice as the dishwasher.</p>
<p>So as a result, it neglected me.</p>
<p>That would just be a bad experience</p>
<p>and it would be a bad product.</p>
<p>I would probably not recommend this refrigerator</p>
<p>to my friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I draw the line.</p>
<p>I think to me, technology has to be reliable</p>
<p>and has to be predictable.</p>
<p>I want my car to work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fall in love with my car.</p>
<p>I just want it to work.</p>
<p>I want it to compliment me, not to replace me.</p>
<p>I have very unique human properties</p>
<p>and I want the machines to make me,</p>
<p>turn me into a superhuman.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m already a superhuman today,</p>
<p>thanks to the machines that surround me.</p>
<p>And I give you examples.</p>
<p>I can run across the Atlantic</p>
<p>at near the speed of sound at 36,000 feet today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of amazing.</p>
<p>I can, my voice now carries me all the way to Australia</p>
<p>using a smartphone today.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the speed of sound, which would take hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the speed of light.</p>
<p>My voice travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>That makes me superhuman.</p>
<p>I would even argue my flushing toilet makes me superhuman.</p>
<p>Just think of the time before flushing toilets.</p>
<p>And maybe you have a very old person in your family</p>
<p>that you can ask about this</p>
<p>or take a trip to rural India to experience it.</p>
<p>It makes me superhuman.</p>
<p>So to me, what technology does, it compliments me.</p>
<p>It makes me stronger.</p>
<p>Therefore, words like love and compassion</p>
<p>have very little interest in this for machines.</p>
<p>I have interest in people.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think, first of all, beautifully put,</p>
<p>beautifully argued,</p>
<p>but do you think love has use in our tools?</p>
<p>Compassion.</p>
<p>I think love is a beautiful human concept.</p>
<p>And if you think of what love really is,</p>
<p>love is a means to convey safety, to convey trust.</p>
<p>I think trust has a huge need in technology as well,</p>
<p>not just people.</p>
<p>We want to trust our technology the same way,</p>
<p>in a similar way we trust people.</p>
<p>In human interaction, standards have emerged</p>
<p>and feelings, emotions have emerged,</p>
<p>maybe genetically, maybe biologically,</p>
<p>that are able to convey sense of trust, sense of safety,</p>
<p>sense of passion, of love, of dedication</p>
<p>that makes the human fabric.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a big slacker for love.</p>
<p>I want to be loved.</p>
<p>I want to be trusted.</p>
<p>I want to be admired.</p>
<p>All these wonderful things.</p>
<p>And because all of us, we have this beautiful system,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t just blindly copy this to the machines.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>When you look at, say, transportation,</p>
<p>you could have observed that up to the end</p>
<p>of the 19th century, almost all transportation used</p>
<p>any number of legs, from one leg to two legs</p>
<p>to a thousand legs.</p>
<p>And you could have concluded that is the right way</p>
<p>to move about the environment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been made the exception of birds</p>
<p>who use flapping wings.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many people in aviation</p>
<p>that flap wings to their arms and jump from cliffs.</p>
<p>Most of them didn&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>Then the interesting thing is that the technology solutions</p>
<p>are very different.</p>
<p>Like in technology, it&rsquo;s really easy to build a wheel.</p>
<p>In biology, it&rsquo;s super hard to build a wheel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few perpetually rotating things in biology</p>
<p>and they usually run cells and things.</p>
<p>In engineering, we can build wheels.</p>
<p>And those wheels gave rise to cars.</p>
<p>Similar wheels gave rise to aviation.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no thing that flies</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t have something that rotates,</p>
<p>like a jet engine or helicopter blades.</p>
<p>So the solutions have used very different physical laws</p>
<p>than nature, and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So for me to be too much focused on,</p>
<p>oh, this is how nature does it, let&rsquo;s just replicate it.</p>
<p>If you really believed that the solution</p>
<p>to the agricultural evolution was a humanoid robot,</p>
<p>you would still be waiting today.</p>
<p>Again, beautifully put.</p>
<p>You said that you don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Did I say that?</p>
<p>You want me to say that?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taking me seriously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Good, you&rsquo;re right, I don&rsquo;t wanna.</p>
<p>I just made that up.</p>
<p>But you have a humor and a lightness about life</p>
<p>that I think is beautiful and inspiring to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Where does that come from?</p>
<p>The smile, the humor, the lightness</p>
<p>amidst all the chaos of the hard work that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>where does that come from?</p>
<p>I just love my life.</p>
<p>I love the people around me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so glad to be alive.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, what, 52, hard to believe.</p>
<p>People say 52 is a new 51, so now I feel better.</p>
<p>But in looking around the world,</p>
<p>looking around the world, just go back 200, 300 years.</p>
<p>Humanity is, what, 300,000 years old?</p>
<p>But for the first 300,000 years minus the last 100,</p>
<p>our life expectancy would have been</p>
<p>plus or minus 30 years roughly, give or take.</p>
<p>So I would be long dead now.</p>
<p>That makes me just enjoy every single day of my life</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t deserve this.</p>
<p>Why am I born today when so many of my ancestors</p>
<p>died of horrible deaths, like famines, massive wars</p>
<p>that ravaged Europe for the last 1,000 years</p>
<p>mystically disappeared after World War II</p>
<p>when the Americans and the Allies</p>
<p>did something amazing to my country</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t deserve it, the country of Germany.</p>
<p>This is so amazing.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re alive and feel this every day,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just so amazing what we can accomplish,</p>
<p>what we can do.</p>
<p>We live in a world that is so incredibly,</p>
<p>vastly changing every day.</p>
<p>Almost everything that we cherish from your smartphone</p>
<p>to your flushing toilet, to all these basic inventions,</p>
<p>your new clothes you&rsquo;re wearing, your watch, your plane,</p>
<p>penicillin, I don&rsquo;t know, anesthesia for surgery,</p>
<p>penicillin have been invented in the last 150 years.</p>
<p>So in the last 150 years, something magical happened.</p>
<p>And I would trace it back to Gutenberg</p>
<p>and the printing press that has been able</p>
<p>to disseminate information more efficiently than before</p>
<p>that all of a sudden we were able to invent agriculture</p>
<p>and nitrogen fertilization that made agriculture</p>
<p>so much more potent that we didn&rsquo;t have to work</p>
<p>in the farms anymore and we could start reading and writing</p>
<p>and we could become all these wonderful things</p>
<p>we are today, from airline pilot to massage therapist</p>
<p>to software engineer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>Like living in that time is such a blessing.</p>
<p>We should sometimes really think about this, right?</p>
<p>Steven Pinker, who is a very famous author and philosopher</p>
<p>whom I really adore, wrote a great book called</p>
<p>Enlightenment Now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s maybe the one book I would recommend.</p>
<p>And he asks the question,</p>
<p>if there was only a single article written</p>
<p>in the 20th century, it&rsquo;s only one article, what would it be?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most important innovation,</p>
<p>the most important thing that happened?</p>
<p>And he would say this article would credit</p>
<p>a guy named Karl Bosch.</p>
<p>And I challenge anybody, have you ever heard</p>
<p>of the name Karl Foch?</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t, okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Bosch Corporation in Germany,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not associated with Karl Bosch.</p>
<p>So I looked it up.</p>
<p>Karl Bosch invented nitrogen fertilization.</p>
<p>And in doing so, together with an older invention</p>
<p>of irrigation, was able to increase the yields</p>
<p>per agricultural land by a factor of 26.</p>
<p>So a 2,500% increase in fertility of land.</p>
<p>And that, so Steve Pinker argues,</p>
<p>saved over 2 billion lives today.</p>
<p>2 billion people who would be dead</p>
<p>if this man hadn&rsquo;t done what he had done, okay?</p>
<p>Think about that impact and what that means to society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I look at the world.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so amazing to be alive and to be part of this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad I lived after Karl Bosch and not before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end this, Sebastian.</p>
