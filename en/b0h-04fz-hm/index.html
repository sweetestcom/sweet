Burke how are you yes</p><p>my name is no single have a question</p><p>about my wife doesn&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p><p>how how can she grow a new gallbladder</p><p>you know sometimes they have what&rsquo;s</p><p>called a remnant gallbladder but they</p><p>usually don&rsquo;t grow back but there&rsquo;s a</p><p>tube that connects from the liver right</p><p>to the small intestine so as long as she</p><p>you know maintains the the production of</p><p>BIOS you&rsquo;ll be okay but probably be</p><p>helpful to take some purified bile salts</p><p>because you she&rsquo;s always gonna be</p><p>somewhat deficient and then she won&rsquo;t</p><p>get the full digestion of all the fats</p><p>so if she starts noticing that let&rsquo;s say</p><p>at night she can&rsquo;t really see that well</p><p>because the the vitamin A is deficient</p><p>then you know she needs more bile salts</p><p>so yeah usually they don&rsquo;t grow back</p><p>sometimes they do but rarely so yeah</p><p>thank you for answer question yeah we</p><p>already take the ball salt from from</p><p>your supplements actually we use those</p><p>every day so thank you good you&rsquo;re</p><p>welcome thanks for calling thank you</p><p>thank you sir thank you doctor</p><p>sure hey guys this is really cool this</p><p>really does work hello hello how are you</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing well how are you great hey</p><p>this really this is amazing this app is</p><p>awesome I can actually talk to you guys</p><p>so what&rsquo;s your question this is amazing</p><p>okay first of all thank you so much dr.</p><p>Berg my question is I have been doing</p><p>keto off and on I haven&rsquo;t always stayed</p><p>on the wagon but I&rsquo;m on now I started</p><p>experiencing about maybe two three</p><p>months ago tingling in my feet and in my</p><p>left hand kind of where my pinky finger</p><p>is at and i was wondering because i&rsquo;ve</p><p>listened to a lot to the videos but that</p><p>might be a slide of some living</p><p>neuropathy starting i&rsquo;m not diabetic</p><p>have been diagnosed but I was gay people</p><p>I&rsquo;m thinking okay I think my sugar is</p><p>out of control</p><p>and so again I started back on Aikido so</p><p>I was wondering is there something else</p><p>I need to be doing I&rsquo;m strictly</p><p>following but I was wondering do I need</p><p>to possibly get some medical testing</p><p>down well I can give you my</p><p>recommendations but I can&rsquo;t really tell</p><p>you whether to go to the doctor or</p><p>Nakhla the doctor but it sounded me like</p><p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a symptom of something</p><p>called peripheral neuropathy from high</p><p>sugar because the high sugar tends to</p><p>destroy the the little tiny blood</p><p>vessels to the nerve and they show up a</p><p>half and the feet and the hands first is</p><p>kind of a alteration and touching and</p><p>feeling so it&rsquo;s really really a kind of</p><p>a simple thing I would get on keto in I</p><p>up immediately and gets a product called</p><p>benefit Amin</p><p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a type of b1 it&rsquo;s a fat</p><p>soluble that helps to heal the nerves</p><p>it&rsquo;s called bent bow to me okay that&rsquo;s</p><p>one of the best ones that you could do</p><p>you can also do others but I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s like the easiest thing to do and</p><p>that&rsquo;s just starting to turn things</p><p>around but make sure you do the keto and</p><p>iaf very strictly right now because</p><p>that&rsquo;s like a indication that&rsquo;s gone a</p><p>little too far okay</p><p>okay thank you connected down is because</p><p>I do take that it&rsquo;ll be separate the</p><p>nutritional yeast is great but if you</p><p>have problem your opposite you need</p><p>something a little stronger</p><p>this actually penetrates sometimes like</p><p>about 20 times more so it&rsquo;s a little bit</p><p>different but yeah keep taking used as</p><p>well okay thank you so much you&rsquo;re</p><p>welcome</p><p>hello hello hi hi this is great my other</p><p>speaker so I don&rsquo;t this is great awesome</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been ketosis when I</p><p>promised and occasionally I&rsquo;ll do like a</p><p>fad or a feast meal just to work keep</p><p>metabolism kind of on but my main</p><p>question here is adrenal fatigue</p><p>so I&rsquo;ve been going in to see like a</p><p>cranial psychotherapists acupuncture or</p><p>acupressure person and I&rsquo;m continuously</p><p>experiencing adrenal fatigue like and</p><p>and so I put together my own plan last</p><p>night of like removing dark chocolate</p><p>caffeine I may be very sensitive to that</p><p>yeah but any other suggestions before</p><p>tests or anything any other actions to</p><p>take yeah</p><p>do you find it are you sleeping are you</p><p>sleeping well are you is there any</p><p>problem sleeping so the most I sleep</p><p>well like so I had the session yesterday</p><p>and then last night I can feel some kind</p><p>of that adrenal area like like surges of</p><p>something that just kind of wakes me up</p><p>suddenly epinephrine or you know yeah so</p><p>here&rsquo;s what here&rsquo;s a couple things I</p><p>would definitely there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p><p>video to watch it&rsquo;s called this stressed</p><p>webinar and it&rsquo;s one of my videos and I</p><p>go through actual an actual technique to</p><p>kind of extract stress from your body</p><p>and it&rsquo;s that you can even it&rsquo;s a</p><p>do-it-yourself technique I would</p><p>definitely do that but something like</p><p>what you&rsquo;re describing is is more of a</p><p>either you&rsquo;re doing a little too much</p><p>stimulants like caffeine or with</p><p>chocolate there&rsquo;s another chemical that</p><p>will keep you kind of wired I would kind</p><p>of that&rsquo;s like the most obvious thing I</p><p>would eliminate that bring that down and</p><p>I would also make sure that your</p><p>minerals are real high like potassium</p><p>and magnesium whether a lot of</p><p>vegetables or electrolyze just because</p><p>you want to those are calming minerals</p><p>and the nervous system could be kind of</p><p>wound up care and there&rsquo;s so many other</p><p>things you can do as well but that would</p><p>be the most obvious thing and then you</p><p>know the adrenals it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a</p><p>matter of doing long walks and making</p><p>sure you get enough sleep if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping there&rsquo;s nothing that you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to do pill wise to really</p><p>rejuvenate that because the sleep is</p><p>really behind the adrenal issue</p><p>excellent I got my notes taken thank you</p><p>so much doctor</p><p>I appreciate the time and your knowledge</p><p>shown here thank you my pleasure all</p><p>right have a good one</p><p>you too okay cool hello hello I stocked</p><p>burger to give alright hi</p><p>yes sir hi dr. Berger so I was wondering</p><p>if maybe at some point you could get</p><p>some more videos out about synthetic</p><p>vitamins I know you&rsquo;ve done a lot about</p><p>like synthetic vitamin C and how it&rsquo;s</p><p>basically like eating rocks I know how</p><p>they can drive these pathetic vitamins</p><p>for Mike like bacon and sodium like</p><p>calcium carbonate and things like that</p><p>so I was just curious maybe you could do</p><p>like more in-depth on like other</p><p>vitamins like a medic like vitamin D if</p><p>that&rsquo;s the thing sure yeah I will do</p><p>that I will do that because you have two</p><p>sets of items you have the fat soluble</p><p>vitamins and if those are synthetic</p><p>those are way more dangerous than a</p><p>water soluble but you know if you&rsquo;re</p><p>taking synthetic vitamin C you&rsquo;d have to</p><p>take a good amount of it to create some</p><p>imbalances but there are some</p><p>therapeutic benefits of taking short</p><p>term high doses but I personally have</p><p>met people who have taken like over a</p><p>hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C</p><p>over course in a couple days and ended</p><p>up with hemorrhoids and spider veins and</p><p>all sorts of things because the vitamin</p><p>C is I think it&rsquo;s meant to be consumed</p><p>in a complex and nature has provided it</p><p>so yeah I&rsquo;ll do some more videos on that</p><p>and talking about the sources of item is</p><p>most of the vitamins that are sold on</p><p>the market are synthetic and the only</p><p>synthetic vitamin that I would take is</p><p>either if you&rsquo;re doing a short-term</p><p>detox or that been throat you mean</p><p>benfotiamine is synthetic but that&rsquo;s the</p><p>one that doesn&rsquo;t seem to create any side</p><p>effects I&rsquo;ve never seen that just all</p><p>positive things because it&rsquo;s slightly</p><p>different and it&rsquo;s more about maybe a</p><p>four month treatment and then your</p><p>much done sounds cool great yeah video</p><p>thank you hey you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>sure and hey guys I have a new cooking</p><p>channel if you go to my website under</p><p>channels you can check it out we&rsquo;re</p><p>releasing one video every other day so</p><p>check it out</p><p>hello dr. Berg hello oh let me let me</p><p>pause for ya hello hello hi hi yes my</p><p>name my name is Dave and I just want to</p><p>say that since I started following the</p><p>intermittent fasting plan I have I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been a I&rsquo;ve had ulcerative colitis for</p><p>about ten years Wow</p><p>and the last time I had the last time</p><p>that I had my colon checked the doctor</p><p>said it looked like I almost had never</p><p>had ulcerative colitis and I do take you</p><p>Mara I&rsquo;ve been taking Jumeirah shots for</p><p>approximately five or six years now and</p><p>so definitely the humor is like helped</p><p>out for about a couple years I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>doing intermittent fasting</p><p>well like off and on and when he asked</p><p>me like what do you what do you do and I</p><p>said well like I&rsquo;m an intermittent</p><p>faster down yeah I just really enjoy it</p><p>and so he even like talked about the</p><p>possibility of coming off Thank You Mara</p><p>one day and that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s my</p><p>question I told him well I&rsquo;m a notary to</p><p>come off the Humera but that&rsquo;s just</p><p>wondering if there has been some</p><p>research out there on other people with</p><p>you know with like intestinal issues</p><p>that have been totally cleared up from</p><p>intermittent fasting oh my gosh oh my</p><p>gosh absolutely when you do in a minute</p><p>faster and even periodic prolong fasting</p><p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of sorts of genetic</p><p>things that kick kick in that basically</p><p>re growing new intestinal cells and</p><p>you&rsquo;re restoring the lining because</p><p>think about it people are eating like</p><p>this at this constant amount all the</p><p>time</p><p>they never give their system a chance to</p><p>kind of turn off and reset and so it you</p><p>start developing ulcers so it&rsquo;s a great</p><p>way to heal it and honestly I I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think if they don&rsquo;t detect any</p><p>inflammation you might want to</p><p>experiment with your doc to see if you</p><p>could come off and even get better</p><p>because who knows what what is doing</p><p>side-effect wise but we are you taking</p><p>the anti-inflammatories probably one of</p><p>the most common anti-inflammatories that</p><p>people take for autoimmune and</p><p>inflammatory conditions but yeah</p><p>intermittent fasting is just a powerful</p><p>therapy and it&rsquo;s very cheap actually you</p><p>just don&rsquo;t eat yeah it but uh yeah I</p><p>just I just thank you very much okay I</p><p>watched a lot of videos about the</p><p>intermittent fasting</p><p>Papaji and I just to believe in it</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome I have felt the effects</p><p>so I just thank you I&rsquo;ll put putting out</p><p>such scientific research on everybody</p><p>thanks Dave I appreciate very much all</p><p>right I&rsquo;ll talk to you</p><p>hello can you hear me</p><p>hello can you hear me oh yeah hi yes can</p><p>you turn your speaker down a little bit</p><p>on your computer I&rsquo;m ready okay great</p><p>okay so I look at a hospital and I</p><p>recently had that antibody test done and</p><p>it came back negative and I&rsquo;m Korean for</p><p>now taking microbiology class I&rsquo;m</p><p>learning a little bit about this as well</p><p>but I wanted to know if I obviously if</p><p>you&rsquo;re negative used to supposedly</p><p>haven&rsquo;t been exposed</p><p>but we&rsquo;re still finding out more and</p><p>more about this virus is it possible</p><p>that the virus apply dormant and and</p><p>won&rsquo;t be detected by the antibody test</p><p>yeah well here&rsquo;s what happens they check</p><p>the antibodies which just indicates if</p><p>you&rsquo;ve been infected and then your</p><p>immune system generated and created</p><p>antibodies so there&rsquo;s always a chance</p><p>that there could be a false positive but</p><p>let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;re not</p><p>you weren&rsquo;t infected that&rsquo;s all that</p><p>means and that&rsquo;s fine and then now it&rsquo;s</p><p>just a matter if you&rsquo;re in an</p><p>environment that&rsquo;s which is very very</p><p>you&rsquo;re vulnerable to a lot of different</p><p>microbes in your hospital so the best</p><p>thing that I would do if I were you is I</p><p>would you know use type of protective</p><p>things obviously to avoid exposure but</p><p>the big thing is I would take minimally</p><p>twenty thousand I use a vitamin d3 every</p><p>single day because that will increase</p><p>your immune system majorly I would take</p><p>about a hundred milligrams of zinc and I</p><p>would take a good amount of vitamin C</p><p>like a natural good vitamin C like two</p><p>hundred milligrams keep that in your</p><p>body every single day because it&rsquo;s more</p><p>protective keep your yeah make sure that</p><p>your foods that you eat are definitely</p><p>not sweets I would do keto and</p><p>especially in a minute fasting because</p><p>there&rsquo;s</p><p>the people that are our vulnerable have</p><p>all sorts of symptoms of metabolic</p><p>disease we get high blood pressure</p><p>we got obesity we got diabetes all those</p><p>are symptoms of insulin resistance which</p><p>is kind of the common denominator so if</p><p>you were to you know protect yourself</p><p>against the blood sugar issues and take</p><p>those nutrients I think that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>give you the unfair advantage to avoid</p><p>getting this infection and it&rsquo;s all</p><p>about - you&rsquo;re an environment that&rsquo;s</p><p>very very concentrated with potential</p><p>viruses versus like out being outside so</p><p>yes if you if someone for example coughs</p><p>around you and you get a little bit of</p><p>that virus that would actually be better</p><p>than getting a lot of concentration</p><p>because then your body would have a lot</p><p>more mild symptoms and that&rsquo;s really</p><p>what determines if your immune system is</p><p>good what determines no symptoms mild</p><p>symptoms and severe is the amount of</p><p>exposure or viral exposure you get so</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s all about strengthen</p><p>immune system and then at the same time</p><p>preventing too much of that exposure to</p><p>the virus that makes sense perfect it</p><p>makes 100% sense thank you so much dr.</p><p>Berg and I said those pedo thanks to you</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty successful I lost about</p><p>35 pounds Wow every month yes and it&rsquo;s I</p><p>feel so much better you know when I was</p><p>having knee problems and I you know lost</p><p>the weight and I&rsquo;m not having some of</p><p>the issues I were having before the only</p><p>thing is I haven&rsquo;t but I have a high</p><p>blood pressure recently in the past I</p><p>was a year my blood pressure has just</p><p>been like prehypertension and now it&rsquo;s</p><p>like full fledge and this is before I</p><p>started intermittent fasting and Kate&rsquo;s</p><p>been kedo but my parents didn&rsquo;t</p><p>ethically I have a history of high blood</p><p>pressure and my family my mother and</p><p>father both have it so if if their way</p><p>is there something that I can do to I</p><p>drink my apple cider vinegar every day</p><p>are there other things I can implement</p><p>to</p><p>lower my blood pressure there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p><p>two things and by the way anything that</p><p>I say is obviously not meant to replace</p><p>medical care but this is my opinion and</p><p>this is what I would I would try with</p><p>help if your doc I would try a bit</p><p>higher amounts of vitamin D because</p><p>vitamin D is one of the most powerful</p><p>things for hypertension and I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about you know 30,000 IU&rsquo;s a day that&rsquo;s</p><p>not outrageous at all</p><p>so 30,000 I used a day unless you can</p><p>get a lot of Sun but I probably would</p><p>take that and that should start bringing</p><p>it down if it doesn&rsquo;t bring all the way</p><p>down then I would add about a thousand</p><p>milligrams of potassium as a supplement</p><p>in addition to your large big salads</p><p>every day because it&rsquo;s the combination</p><p>of enough potassium and vitamin D that</p><p>will usually bring this thing down so</p><p>try those things and let me know if it</p><p>works okay perfect thank you so much</p><p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>this thing is so amazing hello can you</p><p>hear me hello hi dr. Bert hi thanks for</p><p>answering my call this ugh I&rsquo;m gonna try</p><p>to explain my symptoms to the best of my</p><p>ability I just want to say thank you for</p><p>saving me and my mother&rsquo;s like 42 by the</p><p>way so what&rsquo;s been going on is that uh</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been on keto at the beginning of</p><p>January of 2020 yeah and as of the first</p><p>week of April I&rsquo;ve been having these</p><p>symptoms of whenever I wake up I&rsquo;ll be</p><p>very busy and I&rsquo;ve noticed one of our</p><p>I&rsquo;m just laying down I&rsquo;m very busy</p><p>however if I keep moving my dizziness</p><p>will slowly start to go away and it will</p><p>come and go I&rsquo;m taking all the</p><p>supplements of what you&rsquo;ve recommended</p><p>over the years but I like I&rsquo;m just</p><p>trying to really explain these dizziness</p><p>know that symptom so it feels like it&rsquo;s</p><p>almost in the back of my head as well so</p><p>you know how whenever you can feel your</p><p>own pulse it seems like with every pulse</p><p>in the back of the head it feels like</p><p>it&rsquo;s just like a it&rsquo;s like a headache</p><p>without pain at that night son yeah</p><p>okay so I&rsquo;ve done that yeah so okay so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you might</p><p>want to try number one find a very very</p><p>good chiropractor that does upper</p><p>cervical type work because a lot of</p><p>times they can help that especially if</p><p>it&rsquo;s in the back of the head or the neck</p><p>let&rsquo;s say that does not work and you</p><p>still go get you&rsquo;re still getting this</p><p>and you&rsquo;re doing all the right things</p><p>and you&rsquo;re taking nutrition then it&rsquo;s</p><p>your missing information so you have to</p><p>kind of get more data and so you have to</p><p>get a test and the the problem is what</p><p>type of test would you get or something</p><p>like that you&rsquo;d want to find a</p><p>neurologist that will can evaluate your</p><p>autonomic nervous system so write that</p><p>down autonomic nervous system there&rsquo;s</p><p>certain tests that they can do like on a</p><p>table to put you in different positions</p><p>and see if there&rsquo;s just any type of</p><p>problem with the either the the</p><p>sympathetic or the parasympathetic</p><p>nervous system which is located in the</p><p>back of the neck the Paris attacks</p><p>located there because um right now it&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of a mystery so you could try</p><p>things but if you do a brain scan or MRI</p><p>that&rsquo;s just like I think that&rsquo;s just</p><p>inappropriate it&rsquo;s way too much of a</p><p>expensive test I think the best yeah</p><p>just get your autonomic nervous system</p><p>measured a neurologist can do that to</p><p>find out if there&rsquo;s anything kind of out</p><p>of whack there and then then call me</p><p>back whatever yeah cuz I even watch your</p><p>video and I thought of something as</p><p>silly as uh like oh it&rsquo;s gonna be a</p><p>tumor or something I remember that you</p><p>said like 90% of times it could even be</p><p>in a gallbladder it&rsquo;s a 1% with the you</p><p>know tomb or something as crazy of that</p><p>but yeah the only symptom I truly have</p><p>so yeah so it&rsquo;s kind of it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of a something that let&rsquo;s try to do</p><p>the most obvious thing first that&rsquo;s like</p><p>okay you know I there&rsquo;s some really good</p><p>Karos out there that can help you that</p><p>you&rsquo;d be surprised that I&rsquo;ve had people</p><p>like oh six years of dizziness and then</p><p>you work on them goes away and so try</p><p>stand-up it&rsquo;s a no brainer</p><p>okay actually I cuz I did actually go</p><p>someone yesterday and right after the</p><p>session I was like oh yeah I feel a</p><p>little bit alright feel better</p><p>but then as time went on it kind of like</p><p>retracted back to that single feeling</p><p>okay so uh yeah yeah you might you might</p><p>want to um you might want to just give</p><p>it a little more time because especially</p><p>if it&rsquo;s been going on for a while but</p><p>you know if it doesn&rsquo;t handle within</p><p>several weeks and then you&rsquo;re like okay</p><p>let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s dig deeper into what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on</p><p>absolutely okay thank you dr.

Berg this</p><p>is Hank from Florida thanks for taking</p><p>my call I hate sure what was your</p><p>question I have a question about blood</p><p>pressure my blood pressure is really</p><p>high and I have been doing the keto diet</p><p>for about a year and a half I&rsquo;ve lost</p><p>about 40 pounds but still have real high</p><p>blood pressure I started taking some</p><p>magnesium water and doing the deep</p><p>breathing that I&rsquo;ve read about and that</p><p>has lowered it but I still stay up with</p><p>a 180 185 systolic and a 100 diastolic I</p><p>think you know there&rsquo;s something very</p><p>very powerful that&rsquo;s very very natural</p><p>and it&rsquo;s very very inexpensive in fact</p><p>it&rsquo;s free and it&rsquo;s called the Sun and</p><p>the vitamin D that it can give you if</p><p>you were to if you were to get a good</p><p>amount of Sun or you can take the</p><p>supplement vitamin B and I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about about at least 20 thousand</p><p>international units of vitamin d3</p><p>honestly that should bring the blood</p><p>pressure down very nicely if it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>bring it down a hundred percent then you</p><p>need to add in potassium potassium</p><p>magnesium does help the potassium is a</p><p>little bit more important for blood</p><p>pressure because without potassium it</p><p>stiffens the arteries so if you took a</p><p>thousand milligrams of potassium</p><p>every day with a good huge salad you</p><p>know</p><p>like I&rsquo;m talking a huge one they&rsquo;ll give</p><p>you the other minerals as well that</p><p>would be your best bet to bring blood</p><p>pressure down so try that that&rsquo;s like</p><p>okay there&rsquo;s no go ahead that sounds</p><p>really good I just started on your</p><p>vitamin d3 and k2 that you sell there</p><p>and I haven&rsquo;t been on it really long</p><p>enough to check to see if that&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>work</p><p>take we&rsquo;re taking four and a good source</p><p>of potassium take four of those</p><p>okay take four of those with your first</p><p>meal okay and then potassium I would</p><p>recommend my electrolyte powder that I</p><p>would do the regular electrolyte powder</p><p>I have a sports one but I don&rsquo;t would</p><p>recommend that one unless you&rsquo;re</p><p>sweating a lot so this takes a regular</p><p>potassium and I would take like two</p><p>scoops a day and that will give you your</p><p>potassium plus we value electrolytes III</p><p>think that would help a lot okay I can</p><p>guarantee you that I&rsquo;m not low in</p><p>vitamin d3 because as I stated in</p><p>Florida and I&rsquo;m out in the Sun daily and</p><p>probably three or four hours from the</p><p>weekend playing golf okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>definitely not it then do the potassium</p><p>and then are you doing keto sorta keto</p><p>are you doing it like hardcore strict</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing sort to keto I&rsquo;m still on two</p><p>meals a day yeah and on the weekends I</p><p>will probably have a beer and some</p><p>french fries yeah when I come home and</p><p>check my teeth this is my blood meter</p><p>I&rsquo;m still at 0.5 to 0.7 millimoles try</p><p>and experiment okay just for two weeks</p><p>okay just do it hardcore like for real</p><p>and then just evaluate your blood</p><p>pressure and just to see where it&rsquo;s at I</p><p>think you&rsquo;ll be quite surprised to do it</p><p>for real like parkour because even</p><p>though you&rsquo;re showing ketones we still</p><p>want to have the benefits of not just</p><p>ketones but just the drop in insulin</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna occur without having any of</p><p>that stuff</p><p>sure right right just try it well I will</p><p>Thanks sounds like great advice thank</p><p>you okay you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>thanks for all you do do doc we</p><p>appreciate it my pleasure</p><p>hello hello hi what was your question</p><p>hey how&rsquo;s it going out it&rsquo;s good I</p><p>killed me</p><p>hi this is Idol Dominguez I&rsquo;m calling</p><p>out of Florida Maya situation is that</p><p>I&rsquo;m diabetic time - okay</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been diabetic since 2007 now for</p><p>the past about a year and a half maybe</p><p>two I&rsquo;ve been on a very strict fasting</p><p>and keto diet which has helped a lot</p><p>greatly to the point that I&rsquo;ve been out</p><p>of my medication now the problem is that</p><p>I&rsquo;m still having the Adhan effect when I</p><p>wake up I check my sugar levels and for</p><p>some reason it&rsquo;s between maybe 125 I&rsquo;m</p><p>like maybe 145 am i during the day it</p><p>seems to be fine like between 90&rsquo;s and</p><p>like a hundreds like like no hundreds is</p><p>now the other the other problem is that</p><p>I&rsquo;m you know five nine and about 125</p><p>maybe 130 and I&rsquo;m still having trouble</p><p>gaining weight I ate about maybe 2,000</p><p>maybe 25,000 I mean 2500 calories a day</p><p>okay it is you&rsquo;re stuck in a rock and a</p><p>hard place</p><p>because if you do more aggressive</p><p>fasting you&rsquo;ll probably lose more weight</p><p>so what I think the solution that I</p><p>would do especially in the morning when</p><p>you get up I think that the blood sugars</p><p>are being made by your own liver or it</p><p>could be the cortisol and I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>that is a very serious problem I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s just something you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p><p>do this a little bit longer do it more</p><p>strict and then I want you to try</p><p>something tomorrow morning I want you to</p><p>so as you get up go exercise exercise</p><p>that extra sugar off you&rsquo;re out of your</p><p>body</p><p>burn it up and bring that down right now</p><p>and then also do some things to support</p><p>your liver like milk thistle that would</p><p>be good</p><p>increase cruciferous vegetables and</p><p>choline is a really good one as well for</p><p>the liver because that way your liver</p><p>will be a little bit better and you&rsquo;ll</p><p>produce less sugar so try those things</p><p>and then let me know how it works okay</p><p>okay so walk mean exercise and yes it</p><p>milks this so that&rsquo;s a really good one</p><p>for the liver</p><p>milk thistle th e there so I can&rsquo;t even</p><p>spell it milk thistle oh okay I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think I have a good one thank you thank</p><p>you so much hello hello dr. Berg hi yeah</p><p>hi hi I had a year I had a question I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been doing the fasting and the keto and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten great results from it but</p><p>however I noticed that after its many</p><p>fibers 3 4 days 2 days I can&rsquo;t perform</p><p>at night ok and I want to know what what</p><p>I&rsquo;ve taken the minerals as you have</p><p>instructed on your videos and I&rsquo;m and I</p><p>write in some scientific studies that</p><p>doing the keto causes at one hundred</p><p>thirty percent drop in testosterone I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if that has something to do</p><p>with it that I would I would actually</p><p>read this study yourself and you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna find that that studies not very</p><p>credible but this is what I would do I</p><p>would are you taking any zinc I am</p><p>occasionally I do take think I do take</p><p>magnesium I ordered this super zinc but</p><p>see but I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s been I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s been doing any</p><p>any I noticed that when I do take a</p><p>larger amounts of zinc I end up vomiting</p><p>okay so when I take a very small amount</p><p>to think I&rsquo;m okay yeah you you might you</p><p>might need some of the other minerals</p><p>too so make sure you&rsquo;re taking a a blend</p><p>of trace minerals within the zinc and</p><p>then other the other thing that I would</p><p>do is I would</p><p>don&rsquo;t focus on performance I would focus</p><p>on sleeping get a much deeper sleep you</p><p>can your sleep aids out there you can</p><p>take you can get to bed a little earlier</p><p>you can take another nap you can do</p><p>things that your body sleeping but a</p><p>more quality sleep will then cause more</p><p>recovery and those other hormones will</p><p>come straight I mean like they&rsquo;ll</p><p>improve greatly so I think that&rsquo;s what</p><p>I&rsquo;m do and then also if you&rsquo;re taking</p><p>any type of stimulants like too much</p><p>coffee or too much of this or that that</p><p>will also burn out those receptors for</p><p>testosterone more also yeah and hey when</p><p>you called you did you have to wait were</p><p>you on hold for a while or do you just</p><p>pick that you just call and I I picked</p><p>up no I wasn&rsquo;t home for a while okay</p><p>okay so I just didn&rsquo;t know how it worked</p><p>on the other side but that&rsquo;s pretty cool</p><p>okay so go ahead and try those things</p><p>okay and then let me know how it works</p><p>so pretty much you&rsquo;d so since I&rsquo;m an</p><p>avid coffee drinker I drink large</p><p>amounts of coffee every day think about</p><p>what I should do yeah because this is</p><p>what&rsquo;s happening you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re over</p><p>stimulating your nervous system so so</p><p>now it&rsquo;s like it never has a chance to</p><p>kind of recover so things kind of get</p><p>burnt out hormone wise neurotransmitter</p><p>wise and so you want to cut back to one</p><p>cup in the morning honestly that that</p><p>probably will solve your problem within</p><p>probably a couple weeks yeah what if</p><p>what if I switch to decaf would that</p><p>help it&rsquo;s gonna be better for sure make</p><p>sure it&rsquo;s an organic decaf</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;ll definitely help you or again</p><p>any brand you recommend I don&rsquo;t have any</p><p>brand now</p><p>okay okay dr. Berg thank you resign sir</p><p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>hello oh can you turn down your computer</p><p>no you turn down your computer please</p><p>hello hello dr. Berg so much taking my</p><p>call Kandra yeah listen to the video</p><p>isn&rsquo;t very helpful okay yeah I carry</p><p>perfectly</p><p>yeah who I I have a question the one I</p><p>just talked to a logic afford enabled I</p><p>tested positive for the co-lead I came</p><p>upon a so serious wasn&rsquo;t that severe</p><p>I covered I am impossible I got a new</p><p>infiltrate which I hope it&rsquo;s there i</p><p>determinants about stakes I just when I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s resolving so I&rsquo;m act after 20</p><p>days I went to get tested its efficient</p><p>positive so what is my chances of be</p><p>really infected and or what do I need to</p><p>do to clear this well here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>your immune system is going to start</p><p>making antibodies against the virus and</p><p>so you can then be immune from it but in</p><p>the process of this happening this</p><p>infection you want to let your immune</p><p>system run its course and do everything</p><p>you can to strengthen immune system so</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking about vitamin D with a</p><p>good amount of Sun if you can fresh air</p><p>and as well as zinc like about I would</p><p>do about 50 50 to 75 milligrams of zinc</p><p>every single day and then you want a</p><p>good whole food vitamin C so vitamin D</p><p>zinc and vitamin C and then let your</p><p>immune system runs course you know you</p><p>get plenty of sleep if you have a fever</p><p>don&rsquo;t try to immediately do something to</p><p>get rid of</p><p>fever because what happens the infection</p><p>will go longer because here is their to</p><p>decrease their the reproduction of the</p><p>virus so you want to get your immune</p><p>system just let it run its course and if</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have anything severe that&rsquo;s a</p><p>good thing if you start getting severe</p><p>symptoms of course then you have to get</p><p>evaluated but you kind of want to stay</p><p>out of the hospital because it&rsquo;s so</p><p>infected in that environment and so</p><p>those are some simple things that you</p><p>want to do right now and definitely</p><p>definitely get on keto and fasting</p><p>because the complications of this kovetz</p><p>19 viral thing is that it&rsquo;s a metabolic</p><p>syndrome actually if you have like the</p><p>diabetes blood pressure all these other</p><p>things which is all related to insulin</p><p>problems if you get on keto and if'</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna bulletproof yourself a lot</p><p>more so it&rsquo;s time now to get motivated</p><p>just to get healthy and so you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have all these these pre-existing</p><p>problems which I have no idea if you</p><p>have or or don&rsquo;t have but those are some</p><p>general occasion hypertension well then</p><p>you definitely need the vitamin D and</p><p>you need to potassium lots of potassium</p><p>a lot of D and and then get on the keto</p><p>and if&rsquo; intermittent fasting and</p><p>hopefully that will bring that down but</p><p>you know here&rsquo;s the thing they&rsquo;re</p><p>finding that much larger group of the</p><p>population has been infected or is</p><p>getting infected than previously thought</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about on an order of</p><p>magnitude up to fifty to eighty times</p><p>more of the population and what does</p><p>that mean it means that it&rsquo;s fifty to</p><p>eighty times less dangerous than they</p><p>thought so that&rsquo;s good news</p><p>but until they&rsquo;ve done the testing</p><p>they&rsquo;re not going to know they&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to be able to have that full</p><p>understanding but in certain like in two</p><p>universities in California they did the</p><p>test just recently and they found this</p><p>out so and also we did it in Germany and</p><p>they&rsquo;ve done in several other places in</p><p>the world so</p><p>this is the good news so I think you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna be fine but just let it keep</p><p>watching the videos and then stay tuned</p><p>for my my webinar on the immune system</p><p>which is going to be very good I spent</p><p>probably 300 hours preparing for this</p><p>one webinar that I&rsquo;m going to be doing</p><p>very shortly so stay tuned for that ok</p><p>ok so I&rsquo;ll give up immunity oh yeah oh</p><p>yeah yeah yeah it&rsquo;s a you develop</p><p>anybody&rsquo;s and then guess what and then</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to be reinfected oh</p><p>you&rsquo;ll be bulletproof either yeah I have</p><p>another HS coming up on Monday so I&rsquo;m</p><p>just hoping that from from the from the</p><p>first to Monday the 11th so I&rsquo;m hoping</p><p>that I have like cell communication as</p><p>well yeah what happened you get you&rsquo;ll</p><p>get tested and then let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p><p>positive and then over a period of time</p><p>you&rsquo;ll test negative because the bar the</p><p>immune system will take over and get rid</p><p>of the viruses and then you&rsquo;ll be you&rsquo;ll</p><p>be test positive for the antibodies</p><p>which are little things that are just</p><p>sitting there waiting for the next time</p><p>that that virus comes in your body and</p><p>it&rsquo;s ready for it now because it has</p><p>experience and it knows what to do and</p><p>it can prevent it from getting in</p><p>yourselves so I think you&rsquo;re going to be</p><p>okay thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>okay guys I really appreciate all your</p><p>calls awesome stay tuned I&rsquo;m going to be</p><p>doing more of these I&rsquo;m going to do one</p><p>of these a day</p><p>it&rsquo;s my new little cool gadget I love it</p><p>okay</p><p>have a good one</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
