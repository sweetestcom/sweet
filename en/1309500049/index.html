<p>unless you&rsquo;re not having a good day then I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>sorry my name is Bailey Syrian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi my name is Bailey</p>
<p>Sarian and on Mondays I sit down I talk about true</p>
<p>crime story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in True</p>
<p>Crime and you like makeup I</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m here for you on Mondays</p>
<p>today I am going to be talking about serial</p>
<p>killer today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story is a little</p>
<p>brutal so I do have to add a warning please</p>
<p>warning the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue</p>
<p>and strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion</p>
<p>is advised I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>where to begin</p>
<p>because this man</p>
<p>was all sorts of just</p>
<p>wow wow wow</p>
<p>okay his name</p>
<p>Donald Gaskins</p>
<p>Donald so Donald Gaskins was born in Florence County</p>
<p>South Carolina on</p>
<p>March 13th 1933 now at the time his</p>
<p>mother wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>married when she became pregnant</p>
<p>with Donald</p>
<p>which was hugely frowned upon</p>
<p>you know she just</p>
<p>ignored it as best she</p>
<p>could I guess it was said that his</p>
<p>mother had many different men coming and</p>
<p>going throughout his childhood</p>
<p>Donald would</p>
<p>later say that like a lot of</p>
<p>these men treated</p>
<p>him just like garbage they</p>
<p>would beat him</p>
<p>they would kick him</p>
<p>out of the home tell him not to come back for the night</p>
<p>mind you he&rsquo;s like 5 years old</p>
<p>yeah some would just pick on him for the fun of it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a hobby</p>
<p>for some of</p>
<p>these lovers</p>
<p>now this was</p>
<p>upsetting to or</p>
<p>maybe even just</p>
<p>confusing to Donald because</p>
<p>his mother would</p>
<p>allow it to happen</p>
<p>like she would</p>
<p>do nothing to protect him from</p>
<p>these partners of hers and I</p>
<p>think as a kid you know it&rsquo;s probably more confusing</p>
<p>many of the times donald&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>would take off go</p>
<p>maybe live with the new boyfriend for a little bit</p>
<p>just leaving Donald</p>
<p>behind and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like why what possesses someone to</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s okay but</p>
<p>hear about it way too much you know</p>
<p>anyways so she</p>
<p>would take off she</p>
<p>would leave him at home</p>
<p>sometimes she would just</p>
<p>leave him at home by himself</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;d come back like a week</p>
<p>later and again he was like 05:55 years old</p>
<p>so he had to</p>
<p>learn how to take care of himself</p>
<p>from a very</p>
<p>young age eventually</p>
<p>though donald&rsquo;s mom did settle down and she</p>
<p>would remarry</p>
<p>and it was said that his stepfather</p>
<p>would beat him and his 4/2 siblings on the daily</p>
<p>now growing up Donald was a</p>
<p>small kid well</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that I say that because well all kids are small</p>
<p>but what I mean is that he was tiny in</p>
<p>comparison to</p>
<p>other kids his age</p>
<p>which during</p>
<p>school would lead</p>
<p>to kids making fun of him teasing him so at</p>
<p>school Donald was</p>
<p>given the name Peewee</p>
<p>because of how</p>
<p>small he was</p>
<p>no relation to Peewee</p>
<p>Herman let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>bring him into this okay</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>Donald was called Peewee</p>
<p>pretty much all of his life</p>
<p>I think okay look</p>
<p>cause I was trying to</p>
<p>understand I</p>
<p>think he hated it but then he</p>
<p>just kind of owned it was like yeah I&rsquo;m fucking Peewee</p>
<p>but as a kid it was traumatizing</p>
<p>right just made him</p>
<p>angry you know he</p>
<p>would go home</p>
<p>he had a stepfather that would</p>
<p>beat him up pretty much</p>
<p>every day and then he</p>
<p>would go to school</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would get picked on there kids</p>
<p>would try to</p>
<p>fight him at</p>
<p>school the poor kid he couldn&rsquo;t get a break</p>
<p>and look what happens this</p>
<p>would ultimately lead</p>
<p>to him becoming like the most prolific serial killer in</p>
<p>South Carolina</p>
<p>you proud don&rsquo;t pick on people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fully that but you know</p>
<p>come on anyways so donald&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>picked on and at age 11</p>
<p>Donald was like you know what I&rsquo;m quitting</p>
<p>school quit in</p>
<p>school can&rsquo;t do this anymore</p>
<p>and he got a job working at</p>
<p>a local garage</p>
<p>working on cars at 11</p>
<p>yeah different</p>
<p>times you know you can&rsquo;t do that now but back then</p>
<p>you could walk up</p>
<p>to a place and be like hey I&rsquo;m working here now</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s working at this car garage and</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s working there that&rsquo;s when he meets 2</p>
<p>other boys named</p>
<p>Danny and Marsh</p>
<p>now they were all around the same</p>
<p>age and all of them were out of</p>
<p>school so they teamed up and became</p>
<p>friends and they called themselves the</p>
<p>Trouble Trio</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t just like normal friends who</p>
<p>would hang out and</p>
<p>use their imagination to go on</p>
<p>adventures and</p>
<p>stuff no Nene</p>
<p>the trouble trio over here</p>
<p>they broke into homes they</p>
<p>stole expensive items</p>
<p>they picked up sex workers</p>
<p>mind you they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>12:48 years old</p>
<p>okay sometimes</p>
<p>they even raped little boys in the neighborhood</p>
<p>who tried to befriend the trio</p>
<p>oh we&rsquo;re off to a bad</p>
<p>start as we are</p>
<p>they would then threaten the little boys</p>
<p>so they wouldn&rsquo;t go to the police</p>
<p>saying you know we know</p>
<p>where you live</p>
<p>we will kill you and your</p>
<p>whole family if you say anything</p>
<p>just making sure that</p>
<p>these kids wouldn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>so eventually the trio</p>
<p>broke up because they were caught gang raping Marsh</p>
<p>one of the trio boys</p>
<p>his little sister</p>
<p>yep so that the trio they were doing this</p>
<p>and they get caught I</p>
<p>guess marsh</p>
<p>his father walked in on them like</p>
<p>raping his daughter</p>
<p>and then he just lost it like any of us would</p>
<p>he tied the boys up beat them up pretty badly</p>
<p>until they bled</p>
<p>from my understanding he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like turn them into police or anything</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you guys I really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Danny and Marsh</p>
<p>moved out of the area shortly</p>
<p>after that and then the trio just broke up</p>
<p>Donald though he said that he got a thrill</p>
<p>from all these crimes</p>
<p>and even though the trio was gone he was just</p>
<p>gonna continue to</p>
<p>break into homes on his own</p>
<p>so in 1946 Donald was 13</p>
<p>and he decides that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna break into</p>
<p>a home of this</p>
<p>woman that he has been like</p>
<p>watching he knew like she wasn&rsquo;t home he</p>
<p>breaks into the house</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>woman who lived there</p>
<p>she actually showed up</p>
<p>and she notices</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s in her</p>
<p>house instead of announcing that she was there</p>
<p>she actually like</p>
<p>quietly went and</p>
<p>grabbed an axe yes</p>
<p>yeah get the</p>
<p>axe she got the axe</p>
<p>she started</p>
<p>swinging at him left right</p>
<p>she ended up hitting him with the axe</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enough to like take him out she did hit him</p>
<p>but then he ends up getting the</p>
<p>axe they have some kind of little struggle</p>
<p>he eventually gets the axe</p>
<p>struck her in the head and also in the arm</p>
<p>and then he fleeed the scene</p>
<p>now luckily</p>
<p>she actually</p>
<p>ended up surviving</p>
<p>which led to donald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>arrest and conviction of assault with a deadly weapon</p>
<p>and intent to kill</p>
<p>so Donald ended up being sent to</p>
<p>South Carolina Industrial</p>
<p>School for Boys</p>
<p>until he turned 18</p>
<p>now this was a reform</p>
<p>school it was a</p>
<p>bunch of troubled</p>
<p>teens it just wasn&rsquo;t very good</p>
<p>Donald was almost</p>
<p>immediately attacked and raped due to a</p>
<p>small stature</p>
<p>he spent his time either accepting</p>
<p>protection from the boss boy</p>
<p>in exchange for sex</p>
<p>or attempting</p>
<p>just to escape</p>
<p>it was said that almost immediately</p>
<p>he was gang raped by 20 fellow students</p>
<p>from the school inside</p>
<p>the school it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense like</p>
<p>where is everybody</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>where are the</p>
<p>adults around here</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not here or what guys on a</p>
<p>lunch break</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>probably watching cause</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>now Donald did end up</p>
<p>escaping from the reform school</p>
<p>and he ends up finding a</p>
<p>traveling carnival in the area</p>
<p>so he joins he</p>
<p>asked if he</p>
<p>could like work there and escape from the</p>
<p>school right</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>traveling so he&rsquo;s like this is my one way to get out</p>
<p>so during this time it was said Donald</p>
<p>married a 13 year old girl who was also working</p>
<p>with the carnival</p>
<p>but as time went on</p>
<p>he realized that he</p>
<p>truly couldn&rsquo;t be free</p>
<p>unless he finished out his sentence at the reform</p>
<p>school so Donald decided to do the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>he goes back to the reform</p>
<p>school just to turn himself in so he</p>
<p>could finish his</p>
<p>school slash sentencing</p>
<p>sometimes this is a side note but sometimes I read</p>
<p>these things it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>think of a time when you could just</p>
<p>break out of</p>
<p>this reform school</p>
<p>and join a carnival</p>
<p>like you never hear that now do you know someone</p>
<p>broke out and joined a carnival</p>
<p>no so just as wild such a different time I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna join the carnival</p>
<p>bye so Donald goes back to the reform</p>
<p>school and finishes out his</p>
<p>sentencing I guess and</p>
<p>he was released</p>
<p>on March 13 1951</p>
<p>which was also his 18th birthday</p>
<p>so once he was out</p>
<p>Donald now needed to find a job</p>
<p>he got a job working on a tobacco plantation</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t take long for him to</p>
<p>realize that working a normal job just wasn&rsquo;t for him</p>
<p>he was like damn I miss doing some illegal shit</p>
<p>this time he got involved with insurance fraud</p>
<p>he worked with a partner by collaborating</p>
<p>with local tobacco farmers</p>
<p>to burn down</p>
<p>their barns for a fee</p>
<p>he would burn down the barns</p>
<p>and the farmers</p>
<p>would get compensation from the insurance companies</p>
<p>and Donald would get</p>
<p>some money from that I&rsquo;m not sure how you advertise</p>
<p>this type of business</p>
<p>but he was doing it and he was making some good</p>
<p>money I mean to give him credit at</p>
<p>least this wasn&rsquo;t like hurting anybody</p>
<p>you know I would rather</p>
<p>him be burning down barns than</p>
<p>actually why am I trying to</p>
<p>never mind anyway so all</p>
<p>these barns are burning down</p>
<p>and people are like</p>
<p>you know this is a little</p>
<p>weird barns are burning down</p>
<p>Donald seems to be around when</p>
<p>it happens or like working on the farm when it happens</p>
<p>people are just kind of putting some</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>well on one of the farms that he was working at the</p>
<p>daughter of the farmer</p>
<p>she went up to Donald and was like hey</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing</p>
<p>about these barn fires</p>
<p>everyone thinks it&rsquo;s you man so</p>
<p>this upset Donald</p>
<p>and he grabbed a hammer</p>
<p>which was next to him</p>
<p>and he bashed her head with it</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>splitting her skull</p>
<p>and then he attempted to flee</p>
<p>again luckily</p>
<p>she was okay she</p>
<p>survived and once</p>
<p>again Donald was caught and arrested</p>
<p>and he received a 5 year sentence in prison</p>
<p>for assault with a deadly weapon</p>
<p>and attempted murder</p>
<p>5 years so that</p>
<p>should do it that will</p>
<p>teach him this time Donald goes to real prison</p>
<p>he ended up having the same</p>
<p>experience as he did back in the reform</p>
<p>school many of the inmates took advantage of him</p>
<p>he was still very small</p>
<p>petite yeah</p>
<p>they took advantage of him</p>
<p>they raped him and they threatened his life</p>
<p>over time Donald</p>
<p>started to realize like how the prison worked you know</p>
<p>the only way</p>
<p>to get some respect in there was to become a power man</p>
<p>power men were</p>
<p>the most dangerous</p>
<p>ruthless and most feared inmates</p>
<p>nobody messes with them</p>
<p>and they pretty</p>
<p>much call the shots and they run that prison</p>
<p>so Donald wanted that position</p>
<p>he was tired of being picked on</p>
<p>tired of being raped and abused</p>
<p>and he wanted to take charge he wanted to be respected</p>
<p>and most of all he just wanted to be left alone</p>
<p>so Donald used his noggin</p>
<p>and came up with a plan</p>
<p>his plan was to kill one of the meanest</p>
<p>inmates inside of the prison</p>
<p>so what he does is he befriended this guy</p>
<p>and he built</p>
<p>trust then when the inmate</p>
<p>least expected it Donald cut his</p>
<p>throat killing him Donald was</p>
<p>found guilty of manslaughter</p>
<p>and would spend the next 6</p>
<p>months in solitary confinement but</p>
<p>his plan did work</p>
<p>Donald became</p>
<p>a power man</p>
<p>in the prison</p>
<p>and his fellow inmates respected him</p>
<p>and left him alone</p>
<p>sometimes the</p>
<p>older we get</p>
<p>we start to believe that it&rsquo;s too late to</p>
<p>learn new things</p>

<p>the smartest way to hire</p>
<p>just based off of observation</p>
<p>I mean I don&rsquo;t know I wasn&rsquo;t there but it just</p>
<p>sounded like this was really</p>
<p>stroke in his ego</p>
<p>donald&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>like I killed one of the meanest ones in prison</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my trophy</p>
<p>Donald said</p>
<p>after he did that his prison life</p>
<p>or his prison</p>
<p>experience was more</p>
<p>enjoyable and he didn&rsquo;t mind being there so much</p>
<p>so remember</p>
<p>earlier how I said that Donald got</p>
<p>married to that 13 year old</p>
<p>yeah well they were</p>
<p>still married</p>
<p>okay so yeah</p>
<p>they were still</p>
<p>married and she</p>
<p>would write him letters in prison and</p>
<p>stuff but eventually they got divorced in 1955</p>
<p>so he receives a letter in prison saying that like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s wanting to divorce him</p>
<p>right so he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he gets he&rsquo;s pissed</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>break out of here I</p>
<p>gotta go find her</p>
<p>so he does just that he</p>
<p>breaks out of prison and he</p>
<p>steals a car</p>
<p>and drives down to Florida</p>
<p>little Macgyver over here</p>
<p>I mean now he</p>
<p>drives down to Florida</p>
<p>and while he&rsquo;s there he finds another carnival to join</p>
<p>he ends up becoming involved with a</p>
<p>woman named</p>
<p>Betty Gates</p>
<p>betty&rsquo;s talking to Donald and she&rsquo;s like my brother</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in Tennessee</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in jail</p>
<p>can he help me</p>
<p>cover the bail money</p>
<p>Donald has a bit of a</p>
<p>crush on this</p>
<p>Betty girl so he wants to help her</p>
<p>whoa I&rsquo;m having deja vu</p>
<p>so Donald is willing to help and he gets her the bail</p>
<p>money but also he</p>
<p>drives the 2 of them out in the</p>
<p>stolen car to Tennessee</p>
<p>to get the brother out of jail</p>
<p>so Betty gives Donald a pack of</p>
<p>cigarettes and I</p>
<p>guess inside the pack of</p>
<p>cigarettes were some</p>
<p>razor blades</p>
<p>Donald didn&rsquo;t know this he also has</p>
<p>money on hand he goes to the prison and he drops it off</p>
<p>to give to the brother</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>bailed out but the 2 of them they go back to the</p>
<p>hotel room to wait</p>
<p>so Donald tells</p>
<p>Betty like oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go get some</p>
<p>cigarettes I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>right back and</p>
<p>leaves Betty</p>
<p>alone in the</p>
<p>hotel room now when he comes back</p>
<p>his car was stolen</p>
<p>and Betty was gone</p>
<p>to donald&rsquo;s surprise</p>
<p>this dude wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>betty&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>it was actually her husband who had recently escaped</p>
<p>from prison</p>
<p>with a razor</p>
<p>blade so the police</p>
<p>show up to donald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hotel room they find him because when he</p>
<p>when he went to the prison he had to like</p>
<p>check in so police go they find Donald that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>Donald tells the police</p>
<p>about this woman</p>
<p>Betty and her brother</p>
<p>and then police tell them the</p>
<p>whole situation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not her brother</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s her husband</p>
<p>you were scammed</p>
<p>but also they pull up donald&rsquo;s record</p>
<p>and they realize that he too</p>
<p>was an escaped convict so he was arrested</p>
<p>and sent back</p>
<p>to prison now at this</p>
<p>point he received an</p>
<p>additional 9</p>
<p>months in prison for aiding an escape</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving this man a lot of chances</p>
<p>so Donald gets sent to prison</p>
<p>again he&rsquo;s like darn it</p>
<p>but this time</p>
<p>he meets and becomes friends with the Mafia boss</p>
<p>named Frank Costello</p>
<p>oh the 2 hit it off they become</p>
<p>best friends and</p>
<p>Frank he offers</p>
<p>him some employment</p>
<p>when he gets out if you can hear all that background</p>
<p>noise there&rsquo;s squattily ding dong shit I could do</p>
<p>about it you know</p>
<p>people gotta mow</p>
<p>their lawns</p>
<p>okay so in August of 1961</p>
<p>Donald was released from prison</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing because why the hell is he</p>
<p>released I don&rsquo;t know but he was released from prison</p>
<p>he returns to Florence</p>
<p>South Carolina</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s decided</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s gonna live you know</p>
<p>he likes it there it&rsquo;s home once</p>
<p>again he realizes you know</p>
<p>just the normal working life isn&rsquo;t for me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really good at being a burglar then he decides that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be his job</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s got to be the bad guy</p>
<p>this time though</p>
<p>instead of finding a job with a carnival</p>
<p>he found a job with a</p>
<p>traveling minister</p>
<p>traveling minister</p>
<p>no one will know you know so</p>
<p>he goes up to this minister</p>
<p>like hey I&rsquo;ll be your driver</p>
<p>and your assistant</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>drive you everywhere you just</p>
<p>relax in the back seat</p>
<p>help you out</p>
<p>this minister was like</p>
<p>great that sounds</p>
<p>great I love that you</p>
<p>know teamwork makes the</p>
<p>dream work and they work together</p>
<p>but poor minister</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know okay</p>
<p>but this was an easy way Donald</p>
<p>could travel from town to town</p>
<p>while the group he was working with was preaching</p>
<p>obviously a lot of people are not</p>
<p>going to look at the</p>
<p>traveling minister is</p>
<p>up to no good</p>
<p>it was a good cover</p>
<p>while the minister was like preaching and doing</p>
<p>his godly duties</p>
<p>Donald would be</p>
<p>spending his time just</p>
<p>breaking into homes and</p>
<p>stealing stuff</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t killing at this time he was only stealing</p>
<p>stuff and because</p>
<p>they were constantly on the move it made his</p>
<p>crimes harder to trace</p>
<p>so in 1962 Donald</p>
<p>would get caught</p>
<p>raping a 12 year old girl</p>
<p>and he was arrested for statutory rape</p>
<p>but he was able to get away once again</p>
<p>and escape in a</p>
<p>stolen card in</p>
<p>North Carolina</p>
<p>so Donald steals his car he heads to</p>
<p>North Carolina</p>
<p>okay he gets there</p>
<p>and he ends up meeting a 17 year old girl</p>
<p>who he fell madly in love with</p>
<p>and would end up</p>
<p>marrying her now you know when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>about to marry somebody and you get to know one</p>
<p>another and you&rsquo;re like oh my God I like rainbows and</p>
<p>long walks on the beach and</p>
<p>stuff well eventually</p>
<p>like Donald</p>
<p>would end up</p>
<p>telling his new wife that he was on the run</p>
<p>because he had raped a 12 year old girl and</p>
<p>stole a car</p>
<p>no big deal</p>
<p>of course this was</p>
<p>shocking information to his new wife</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t say anything to Donald at the time</p>
<p>but she went she turned his ass in</p>
<p>which bravo girl</p>
<p>bravo so she turns them in</p>
<p>once again Donald was arrested</p>
<p>and received 6 years in prison</p>
<p>6 years so he</p>
<p>ends up serving his full sentence and he was released</p>
<p>in November of 1968 Donald said that he would get</p>
<p>very dark thoughts and feelings telling him to commit</p>
<p>awful crimes but they were also getting</p>
<p>more and more</p>
<p>worse that&rsquo;s not proper English well I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>think raping</p>
<p>kids is pretty dark if you ask me but now he was like I</p>
<p>wanna murder somebody</p>
<p>is what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking and he felt like he had no control</p>
<p>and the thoughts and</p>
<p>these feelings</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>until he actually committed the</p>
<p>crime in September of 1969</p>
<p>donald&rsquo;s picked up a lady hitchhiker in</p>
<p>North Carolina</p>
<p>and he asked her</p>
<p>if she would be interested in performing</p>
<p>sexual acts</p>
<p>since he gave her a ride</p>
<p>so Donald is asking this hitchhiker like hey</p>
<p>wanna tickle my pickle</p>
<p>apparently she</p>
<p>laughed at him she</p>
<p>laughs in his face</p>
<p>now this this</p>
<p>upset Donald he</p>
<p>started seeing red</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s asking her are you</p>
<p>laughing at me he pulls his car over</p>
<p>he beats her</p>
<p>until she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unconscious he</p>
<p>rapes her he sodomized</p>
<p>and tortured her</p>
<p>he then went to a</p>
<p>swamp nearby</p>
<p>tied a bunch of rocks to her body so she</p>
<p>would sink to the bottom of the swamp</p>
<p>and you know what&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>upsetting all this</p>
<p>could have been prevented</p>
<p>by just keeping his dumbass in prison</p>
<p>but they did it</p>
<p>now sadly this hitchhiker</p>
<p>would be the</p>
<p>first of many</p>
<p>he picked up</p>
<p>while driving around the</p>
<p>coastal highways</p>
<p>so Donald would kill both men and</p>
<p>women purely for pleasure</p>
<p>and on average at</p>
<p>least once every 6 weeks</p>
<p>he said that he got a thrill from it</p>
<p>enjoyed torturing and mutilating his</p>
<p>victims but he</p>
<p>enjoyed it more when the</p>
<p>victims were</p>
<p>alive and knew what he was doing</p>
<p>which is just fucking</p>
<p>awful he had a variety of different methods from</p>
<p>stabbing to suffocation mutilation</p>
<p>and he even</p>
<p>tried eating a victim</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like it though but he</p>
<p>tried it he</p>
<p>wrote a memoir</p>
<p>which is why I keep saying Donald said</p>
<p>I mean he was intense</p>
<p>okay he was like the</p>
<p>worst type scary type</p>
<p>he pick people up no reason</p>
<p>just anyone he saw</p>
<p>he pick them up</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t really have a</p>
<p>specific style</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>police and investigators couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>figure out if this was a serial killer or just a</p>
<p>random killing because</p>
<p>there was no consistency</p>
<p>so in donald&rsquo;s memoir</p>
<p>he claimed to feel the overpowering need</p>
<p>to commit these</p>
<p>crimes by the</p>
<p>10th of each</p>
<p>month most of the murders were people</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t know and considered it weekend fun</p>
<p>but he would go on to kill his 15 year old</p>
<p>niece and her friend</p>
<p>and he called that a serious murder</p>
<p>not just weekend fun</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t really kill a lot</p>
<p>of people that he did know in real life it was always</p>
<p>random but there were</p>
<p>a few times when he killed people that he actually knew</p>
<p>like people owing him</p>
<p>money one guy tried to</p>
<p>blackmail him and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like man</p>
<p>gonna kill you and then people</p>
<p>would seek him out</p>
<p>and hire him</p>
<p>as a hit man to kill</p>
<p>a victim for money</p>
<p>after Donald</p>
<p>would kill a</p>
<p>victim he would</p>
<p>bury them along the</p>
<p>coastal areas of</p>
<p>South Carolina</p>
<p>he would rarely</p>
<p>leave their</p>
<p>bodies out in the open he</p>
<p>would bury them</p>
<p>you get it he</p>
<p>would bury them</p>
<p>a lot of people in the</p>
<p>community or in donald&rsquo;s neighborhood they didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>much of him they just thought he was weird</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s just a weirdo</p>
<p>he had a short temper</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t very friendly</p>
<p>and many of them also just thought</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mentally disturbed and</p>
<p>nothing more like he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t actually do anything to anybody</p>
<p>people would</p>
<p>would avoid Donald</p>
<p>if they saw him as what I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>but then there was like another</p>
<p>group of people at the</p>
<p>other side Donald seemed to have like a good</p>
<p>group of friends</p>
<p>people seemed to really like him and</p>
<p>never saw this evil side come through</p>
<p>very mixed reviews</p>
<p>one of his friends</p>
<p>was a woman</p>
<p>named Doreen</p>
<p>who was his next door neighbor</p>
<p>now Doreen she had a</p>
<p>young daughter</p>
<p>and was also pregnant</p>
<p>carrying her second</p>
<p>child she was heading out of town</p>
<p>one day she was looking for a ride to the bus station</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when donald&rsquo;s offered to give her</p>
<p>a ride now instead of taking her</p>
<p>to the bus station</p>
<p>Donald took her to a secluded</p>
<p>area where he</p>
<p>raped and killed her</p>
<p>and also her</p>
<p>young daughter</p>
<p>he killed them all</p>
<p>after that he</p>
<p>buried them all together in this wooded area</p>
<p>super disturbing I know</p>
<p>so if you didn&rsquo;t hate him already you</p>
<p>should probably</p>
<p>definitely hate him now</p>
<p>Donald just kept killing and by the age of 42</p>
<p>Donald had been killing for over 5 years</p>
<p>usually he worked</p>
<p>alone which he thought</p>
<p>was a good idea because it</p>
<p>would prevent him from being caught</p>
<p>the only person that</p>
<p>could rat himself out was</p>
<p>himself but one day</p>
<p>while he was driving down the highway he saw</p>
<p>a van that was broken down and pulled over there were</p>
<p>3 people who were trying to figure out</p>
<p>what to do with their van</p>
<p>this is before</p>
<p>cell phones and</p>
<p>stuff you know donald&rsquo;s dumbass</p>
<p>he pulls over</p>
<p>he offers them some help</p>
<p>but in turn he ends up killing them all</p>
<p>he kills all 3 of</p>
<p>these victims</p>
<p>buries them in some</p>
<p>wooded area that they were kind of pulled over near</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when Donald realized he needs he needed help moving the</p>
<p>victims van</p>
<p>so he calls up his friend who was an ex</p>
<p>con his name is Walter Neely</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like hey can you come pick up the van</p>
<p>and then take it to uh</p>
<p>your garage to repaint it we</p>
<p>could sell it</p>
<p>hit Walter does that he goes out he picks up the van</p>
<p>he takes it to his garage</p>
<p>paint it and then they sell it so in the coming months</p>
<p>after the van</p>
<p>the van murders</p>
<p>Donalds he went on to kill</p>
<p>about 05:55 more people</p>
<p>then he called up his friend Walter</p>
<p>again to help him</p>
<p>bury the latest</p>
<p>bodies he had he just had too many</p>
<p>bodies he needed help</p>
<p>burying them</p>
<p>so at this time Donald</p>
<p>had his own private cemetery</p>
<p>which was property</p>
<p>that he had owned</p>
<p>so Donald took Walter out to his private cemetery</p>
<p>which was land that he owned in Prospect</p>
<p>South Carolina</p>
<p>and while he&rsquo;s there Walter helped</p>
<p>bury his latest victims</p>
<p>in November of 1975</p>
<p>Walter was arrested</p>
<p>under suspicion of murder</p>
<p>so when police are questioning Walter they&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>you know like were you working with somebody</p>
<p>because if you talk</p>
<p>we can lessen your sentence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Walters like you know what</p>
<p>I do have something</p>
<p>to say and he told police that he witnessed</p>
<p>donald&rsquo;s Gaskins</p>
<p>killing victims that were on</p>
<p>the missing persons list</p>
<p>and he then mentioned that Donald had confided in him</p>
<p>to having killed several people over the last 5 years</p>
<p>you know police are like Walter</p>
<p>hey is there anything else</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>you wanna tell us</p>
<p>walter&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah actually I know</p>
<p>where some of them are buried private</p>
<p>cemetery let me tell you</p>
<p>so walter&rsquo;s just talking talking talking</p>
<p>which is a good thing</p>
<p>but this was the one</p>
<p>thing Donald</p>
<p>did not want to happen why he always worked</p>
<p>alone and it was backfiring on his dumbass</p>
<p>fucking hat</p>
<p>police they go out to donald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment they end up</p>
<p>searching his apartment</p>
<p>and they end up finding</p>
<p>clothing that had been worn by a recent</p>
<p>woman that was</p>
<p>on the missing person&rsquo;s list</p>
<p>oh yes they arrested him</p>
<p>and they took him in</p>
<p>and they ended up telling Donald that they knew</p>
<p>about his little cemetery</p>
<p>somebody had ratted him out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it was</p>
<p>cause he only took one person there Walter</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like hey that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>I thought we were friends Walter</p>
<p>so police say like hey we know</p>
<p>about your private cemetery</p>
<p>if you take us out there</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll offer you a lesser sentence</p>
<p>as if he hasn&rsquo;t had enough chances but Donald</p>
<p>agrees and he ends up taking them out there to show</p>
<p>where all the</p>
<p>bodies were</p>
<p>so Donald takes them out there</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where police discovered</p>
<p>8 victims buried on his property</p>
<p>on April 27th 1976</p>
<p>Donald and Walter were</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>8 counts of murder and on May</p>
<p>24th 1974 a</p>
<p>convicted Donald</p>
<p>of murder and sentenced</p>
<p>him to death</p>
<p>so in attempt to</p>
<p>avoid additional</p>
<p>death sentences</p>
<p>cause he already got one so he&rsquo;s like I want more he</p>
<p>confessed to</p>
<p>7 more murders in 1976</p>
<p>the Supreme Court</p>
<p>ended up ruling that the</p>
<p>death penalty was</p>
<p>unconstitutional</p>
<p>so his death sentence was turned into</p>
<p>7 consecutive life sentences</p>
<p>but then because the</p>
<p>story doesn&rsquo;t end there it just keeps</p>
<p>going forever</p>
<p>let me tell you</p>
<p>the story it never ends</p>
<p>it goes on and on and on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that from it goes on</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter so in 1978 the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>was restored</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>mean anything to Donald and like his sentence it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna change back to</p>
<p>the death sentence that is</p>
<p>until Donald killed again</p>
<p>while incarcerated</p>
<p>he murdered</p>
<p>again Donald was incarcerated in the high security</p>
<p>block at the</p>
<p>South Carolina</p>
<p>Correctional Institution</p>
<p>he decided to kill a fellow</p>
<p>death row inmate</p>
<p>named Rudolph</p>
<p>Tyner now Donald was hired by the son</p>
<p>of rudolph&rsquo;s</p>
<p>victim to kill</p>
<p>Rudolph yes</p>
<p>Donald tried many times to get rid of him</p>
<p>lacing his food with poison</p>
<p>but nothing seemed to be working that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when he decided the only way to get rid of this guy</p>
<p>would be to use some explosives to kill him</p>
<p>a bit of a jump</p>
<p>but okay Donald</p>
<p>so Donald took a</p>
<p>small portable</p>
<p>radio and put explosives</p>
<p>inside of it he gave it to Rudolph</p>
<p>and was like hey you</p>
<p>wanna be friends</p>
<p>so listen to this</p>
<p>radio and like we&rsquo;ll talk to each</p>
<p>other Donald told him hey at like 5 p m</p>
<p>hold the radio up to your ear</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start talking to you</p>
<p>okay in donald&rsquo;s cell he has the</p>
<p>ability to detonate the explosives inside of the radio</p>
<p>5 o&rsquo;clock comes around Rudolph</p>
<p>is like hello</p>
<p>and then kaboom</p>
<p>Rudolph died</p>
<p>now because of this Donald once</p>
<p>again received the</p>
<p>death sentence</p>
<p>Donald knew that he was heading to the electric</p>
<p>chair and he</p>
<p>started confessing</p>
<p>to more and more murders in hopes to just</p>
<p>avoid he didn&rsquo;t wanna die</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like hey I got more information</p>
<p>hey pick me I got more information</p>
<p>he claimed to have committed between</p>
<p>100 to 110 murders the last few</p>
<p>months of his life Donald worked with an author to</p>
<p>write a book called</p>
<p>final Truth</p>
<p>which was published in 1993</p>
<p>where he told his side of the</p>
<p>story so on September 5th 1991</p>
<p>it was donald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>execution day but he didn&rsquo;t want to die on the electric</p>
<p>chair so he</p>
<p>tried to cut his</p>
<p>wrists instead and hopes to just not get the</p>
<p>chair which</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>point of that</p>
<p>would be like why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t he just want the</p>
<p>chair at that</p>
<p>point you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die either way</p>
<p>I just I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whatever so he</p>
<p>tries to he</p>
<p>tries to kill himself</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t work yeah</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>surviving they take him to the</p>
<p>the nurse whatever and they</p>
<p>stitch him up but it kind of backfired on him</p>
<p>which is good because</p>
<p>he ends up getting sent to the electric chair</p>
<p>right they have to put like the bandages and</p>
<p>stuff around his stitches so it must have been painful</p>
<p>sorry Donald</p>
<p>that must have sucked</p>
<p>in instances like this I</p>
<p>truly believe that you</p>
<p>should die the same way that you&rsquo;ve killed</p>
<p>others and I for an eye</p>
<p>yeah anyways</p>
<p>September 6 1991 at like around 1 in the morning</p>
<p>Donald was hooked up to the electric</p>
<p>chair and was removed from this planet</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s unclear how many</p>
<p>victims donald&rsquo;s actually killed</p>
<p>many believe that Donald was just</p>
<p>lying just to</p>
<p>kind of hype himself up make himself a bigger deal</p>
<p>but either way</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say</p>
<p>that Donald was a disturbing disgusting vanilla pudding</p>
<p>piece of shit horrible</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>who definitely deserve the</p>
<p>death sentence</p>
<p>and had way</p>
<p>too many chances to</p>
<p>get out of I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this dude was so</p>
<p>gross when I was reading</p>
<p>about him I don&rsquo;t know of any time of his life</p>
<p>where it just</p>
<p>sounded like oh that must have been nice like he seemed</p>
<p>happy at this time in his life</p>
<p>like it didn&rsquo;t seem like that</p>
<p>existed at all</p>
<p>it seemed like it was</p>
<p>chaos from day one that sucks</p>
<p>you can feel bad for bad people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to it&rsquo;s okay to feel bad for him he had a shitty</p>
<p>life but he also</p>
<p>did some fucked</p>
<p>up shit you know what I&rsquo;m saying like wow</p>
<p>sometimes I just see people who are like why are you</p>
<p>standing up for them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not standing up for them</p>
<p>before I started my murder mystery makeup</p>
<p>videos I was a full believer that some people are</p>
<p>born just evil</p>
<p>but the more and more I do</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>about serial killers especially</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a common theme</p>
<p>shitty upbringing</p>
<p>head trauma</p>
<p>shitty upbringing and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that some people aren&rsquo;t just born bad more</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s because of how like they&rsquo;re upbringing</p>
<p>so be nice to your kids don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bully kids don&rsquo;t fuck em up</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story about Donald Gaskins aka Peewee</p>
<p>he was terrible he was terrible</p>
<p>other than that I hope</p>
<p>you have a wonderful rest of your day make good choices</p>
<p>please be safe out there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys</p>
