fasting can help lower your blood pressure high blood pressure or hypertension usually has no symptoms you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on unless you get your blood pressure tested and if you&amp;rsquo;re getting older it might be a good idea to have a blood pressure cuff around just to assess this there&amp;rsquo;s two types of hypertension you have primary and you have secondary 95% of all hypertension cases are primary okay hypertension and that&amp;rsquo;s related to lifestyle and so if you look this up they&amp;rsquo;re going to mention you know consuming too much salt having obesity smoking drinking alcohol the recommendation is consuming a healthy diet i love it but if you dig further into what they recommend as a healthy diet that&amp;rsquo;s where you get the problem because they&amp;rsquo;re recommending fruits vegetables whole grains they have to stick the whole grains in there less than 30% of your calories being fat and of course they recommend avoiding the saturated fats of course and then they recommend less than 10 percent simple sugar so they&amp;rsquo;re allowing up to 10% of all your calories being simple sugars wow amazing well what does that come out to in teaspoons 12 teaspoons a day because it&amp;rsquo;s 50 grams of sugar that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;re allowing okay that&amp;rsquo;s considered part of a healthy diet now before i see anything else i want to give a disclaimer i&amp;rsquo;m not recommending you coming off your medication without the help of your doctor okay just giving you data to think with so there was a study called the sprint trial study in 2015 where they tested people over 50 years old with high blood pressure and they found that they lived a little bit longer when they took multiple medications for hypertension okay that sounds pretty good but here&amp;rsquo;s the problem with that they found significant risks with this benefit of living longer and that risk is a significant increased risk in kidney disease okay and so if something can help you yet it comes with this other thing that can hurt you it&amp;rsquo;s not the ideal situation from my viewpoint now the other interesting thing about this study is they they didn&amp;rsquo;t use everyone that had high blood pressure they only used a fraction of the people that had high blood pressure and their pool of people that they were using the ones that were the most severe and so if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a severe high blood pressure problem then this data on it helping you live longer would be invalid because they didn&amp;rsquo;t test those people shifting gears there was another study on 174 individuals who did fasting and yes it was medically supervised but there was a 90% success rate of lowering blood pressure into a fairly good range when people did fasting but my question is why well this is why because fasting is the most powerful way to lower insulin and when you have high insulin because you have insulin resistance the arteries become very very stiff and so one of the root causes of hypertension is a blood sugar problem coming and being caused by insulin resistance and high levels of insulin but the high levels of insulin that should normally lower the blood sugars is not working because of the insulin resistance the point is this if you have insulin resistance you&amp;rsquo;re at risk of getting hypertension and this is why people that have the metabolic syndrome syndrome x one part of that is hypertension and the common thread with that condition is high levels of insulin hyperinsulinemia okay that&amp;rsquo;s the medical term but it&amp;rsquo;s basically just insulin resistance all right so what should you do if you have high blood pressure start fasting immediately start doing intermittent fasting that right there might just totally handle it and then you can get with your doctor and uh work together to wean off your medication all right number two add vitamin d vitamin d is a very powerful uh natural remedy for high blood pressure next point is potassium start taking more potassium if you&amp;rsquo;re low in potassium your arteries can get very stiff so potassium makes the arteries very very soft and flexible i put a link down below with other benefits from potassium all right add vitamin k2 why because vitamin k2 helps remove excess calcium from the arteries okay so it&amp;rsquo;s going to make the arteries more pliable elastic because calcium tends to make them more rigid vitamin d and k2 work together this is why one of the remedies for hypertension is calcium channel blockers why are they blocking calcium because the calcium is making things very very stiff and vitamin k2 can help counter that and then add magnesium ideally you should get your magnesium and potassium from leafy greens large amounts of salad but you can also add magnesium to your diet like magnesium orotate is a really good one and watch your blood pressure come down those are all the nutritional things that can help you but if you add fasting and a low carb diet which will also help insulin resistance i think that would be a really good plan to avoid high blood pressure and i just want to mention this point when doing research on this topic it&amp;rsquo;s just amazing how much data that is put out there on the front page of google in fact it&amp;rsquo;s not just on the first page on google it&amp;rsquo;s uh it&amp;rsquo;s on the first five pages of google all the links it&amp;rsquo;s just you get all this data all this information what i try to communicate in the videos all the videos that i do is the important stuff not the trivial stuff so when you&amp;rsquo;re doing research in the area of health problems and many other things you have to dig through all the fluff all the minutia all the trivial stuff to find the gold and so i just want to let you know that i spent a lot of time in focusing on this one point is just giving you the most important stuff and not the trivial all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment"><title>Fasting Lowers Blood Pressure ｜ DrEricBergDC |

blood pressure high blood pressure or hypertension  </p><p>usually has no symptoms you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s 
going on unless you get your blood pressure tested  </p><p>and if you&rsquo;re getting older it might 
be a good idea to have a blood pressure  </p><p>cuff around just to assess this there&rsquo;s two 
types of hypertension you have primary and  </p><p>you have secondary 95% of all hypertension cases 
are primary okay hypertension and that&rsquo;s related  </p><p>to lifestyle and so if you look this up they&rsquo;re 
going to mention you know consuming too much salt  </p><p>having obesity smoking drinking alcohol the 
recommendation is consuming a healthy diet  </p><p>i love it but if you dig further into what they 
recommend as a healthy diet that&rsquo;s where you get  </p><p>the problem because they&rsquo;re recommending 
fruits vegetables whole grains they have  </p><p>to stick the whole grains in there less than 
30% of your calories being fat and of course  </p><p>they recommend avoiding the saturated fats 
of course and then they recommend less than  </p><p>10 percent simple sugar so they&rsquo;re allowing up 
to 10% of all your calories being simple sugars  </p><p>wow amazing well what does that come out to in 
teaspoons 12 teaspoons a day because it&rsquo;s 50 grams  </p><p>of sugar that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re allowing okay 
that&rsquo;s considered part of a healthy diet  </p><p>now before i see anything else i want to give 
a disclaimer i&rsquo;m not recommending you coming  </p><p>off your medication without the help of your 
doctor okay just giving you data to think with  </p><p>so there was a study called the sprint trial 
study in 2015 where they tested people over 50  </p><p>years old with high blood pressure and they found 
that they lived a little bit longer when they took  </p><p>multiple medications for hypertension okay that 
sounds pretty good but here&rsquo;s the problem with  </p><p>that they found significant risks with this 
benefit of living longer and that risk is a  </p><p>significant increased risk in kidney disease okay 
and so if something can help you yet it comes with  </p><p>this other thing that can hurt you it&rsquo;s not the 
ideal situation from my viewpoint now the other  </p><p>interesting thing about this study is they they 
didn&rsquo;t use everyone that had high blood pressure  </p><p>they only used a fraction of the people that had 
high blood pressure and their pool of people that  </p><p>they were using the ones that were the most severe 
and so if you don&rsquo;t have a severe high blood  </p><p>pressure problem then this data on it helping you 
live longer would be invalid because they didn&rsquo;t  </p><p>test those people shifting gears there was another 
study on 174 individuals who did fasting and yes  </p><p>it was medically supervised but there was a 90% 
success rate of lowering blood pressure into a  </p><p>fairly good range when people did fasting but my 
question is why well this is why because fasting  </p><p>is the most powerful way to lower insulin 
and when you have high insulin because you  </p><p>have insulin resistance the arteries become 
very very stiff and so one of the root causes  </p><p>of hypertension is a blood sugar problem coming 
and being caused by insulin resistance and high  </p><p>levels of insulin but the high levels of insulin 
that should normally lower the blood sugars  </p><p>is not working because of the insulin resistance 
the point is this if you have insulin resistance  </p><p>you&rsquo;re at risk of getting hypertension and this 
is why people that have the metabolic syndrome  </p><p>syndrome x one part of that is hypertension 
and the common thread with that condition is  </p><p>high levels of insulin hyperinsulinemia okay 
that&rsquo;s the medical term but it&rsquo;s basically just  </p><p>insulin resistance all right so what should you 
do if you have high blood pressure start fasting  </p><p>immediately start doing intermittent fasting 
that right there might just totally handle it  </p><p>and then you can get with your doctor and uh 
work together to wean off your medication all  </p><p>right number two add vitamin d vitamin d is a very 
powerful uh natural remedy for high blood pressure  </p><p>next point is potassium start taking more 
potassium if you&rsquo;re low in potassium your  </p><p>arteries can get very stiff so potassium makes the 
arteries very very soft and flexible i put a link  </p><p>down below with other benefits from potassium 
all right add vitamin k2 why because vitamin k2  </p><p>helps remove excess calcium from the arteries 
okay so it&rsquo;s going to make the arteries more  </p><p>pliable elastic because calcium tends to make 
them more rigid vitamin d and k2 work together  </p><p>this is why one of the remedies for hypertension 
is calcium channel blockers why are they blocking  </p><p>calcium because the calcium is making things very 
very stiff and vitamin k2 can help counter that  </p><p>and then add magnesium ideally you should get your 
magnesium and potassium from leafy greens large  </p><p>amounts of salad but you can also add magnesium to 
your diet like magnesium orotate is a really good  </p><p>one and watch your blood pressure come down those 
are all the nutritional things that can help you  </p><p>but if you add fasting and a low carb diet which 
will also help insulin resistance i think that  </p><p>would be a really good plan to avoid high blood 
pressure and i just want to mention this point  </p><p>when doing research on this topic it&rsquo;s just 
amazing how much data that is put out there  </p><p>on the front page of google in fact it&rsquo;s not just 
on the first page on google it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s on the  </p><p>first five pages of google all the links it&rsquo;s 
just you get all this data all this information  </p><p>what i try to communicate in the videos all the 
videos that i do is the important stuff not the  </p><p>trivial stuff so when you&rsquo;re doing research in 
the area of health problems and many other things  </p><p>you have to dig through all the fluff all the 
minutia all the trivial stuff to find the gold  </p><p>and so i just want to let you know that i spent 
a lot of time in focusing on this one point is  </p><p>just giving you the most important stuff and 
not the trivial all right thanks for watching  </p><p>hey before you go real quick i have a course 
entitled how to bulletproof your immune system  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and 
here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment</p><p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p><p>what about strengthening your immune system 
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p><p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p><p>by strengthening your own immune system i put 
a link down in the description right down below  </p><p>check it out and get signed up today</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
