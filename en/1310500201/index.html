    <p>The following is a conversation with Jaco Willink, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL, coauthor of Extreme</p>
<p>Ownership, Dichotomy of Leadership, Discipline Equals Freedom, and many other excellent books,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the host of Jaco&rsquo;s podcast. Jaco spent 20 years in the SEAL teams. He was the commander</p>
<p>of SEAL Team 3&rsquo;s Task Unit Bruiser that became the most highly decorated Special Operations unit</p>
<p>of the Iraq War. This conversation was intense and to the point. We agreed to talk again,</p>
<p>probably many times, and what I find very interesting, aside from the talk of leadership,</p>
<p>is the conversation about military tactics of specific battles in history.</p>
<p>I do happen to at times mention that I&rsquo;m Russian. This is what I mean, that I got a bit of that</p>
<p>Russian soul. But of course who I really am is an American. This country gave me the opportunity,</p>
<p>the freedom to become and to be who I am, to stand as an individual. This seemingly</p>
<p>simple freedom to be a sovereign human being in the face of all the beauty and cruelty of life</p>
<p>is why I love this country. Much of life can be unfair, unjust, even tragic. But this is the</p>
<p>country where if I&rsquo;m clever enough or card enough and just get lucky enough I have a chance to dream</p>
<p>big and make my dream a reality. The United States welcomed me, my family, and millions of immigrants</p>
<p>throughout its history so that we can make something meaningful of ourselves. To love,</p>
<p>to dream, to create, to find joy and meaning. It lets me be the weird kid I am who wears a suit,</p>
<p>talks about love, and has a fascination with robots. I know some people these days have an</p>
<p>aversion to pride and love for their country. I don&rsquo;t. I love America. I also love humanity.</p>
<p>I believe these two, patriotism and humanism, are not in conflict, much like loving your family and</p>
<p>loving your country are not in conflict. They are all manifestations of the human spirit,</p>
<p>longing to strive for a better world. I was born a Russian, but I believe I will die an American.</p>
<p>A proud American. Hopefully not too soon, but life is short. I already had one hell of a fun journey,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m ready to go when it&rsquo;s time. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation</p>
<p>with Jaco Willink. Is it tragic or beautiful to you that some of the closest bonds that have formed</p>
<p>between people are through war often. I think it&rsquo;s both, both tragic and beautiful and for the</p>
<p>obvious reasons. What are the obvious reasons? Why is it so obvious? Well, it&rsquo;s tragic because</p>
<p>a lot of people die and it&rsquo;s beautiful because you form bonds with people that are very difficult</p>
<p>to break once you&rsquo;ve been through them. What is it about the trauma of war that makes bonds</p>
<p>difficult to break? Because what you realize when you&rsquo;re in a war is that the people that are next</p>
<p>to you, you rely on them and they&rsquo;re relying on you to survive. And without them, you will not</p>
<p>survive. And when you realize that you need to work together as a team to, to live, that forms</p>
<p>a very strong bond. And there&rsquo;s nothing like that team outside of the realm of war. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that I haven&rsquo;t experienced in my life, but I think the</p>
<p>pressure and the consequences of war, there could be similar situations in survival scenarios,</p>
<p>in various atrocities where people need to work together in order to survive. And I think you</p>
<p>could probably get something that was similar. There&rsquo;s a very particular nature to the kind of</p>
<p>war that World War II was, especially for the Soviet Union, where it didn&rsquo;t just influence</p>
<p>the lives of people. It created culture, the music, the poetry, the literature. It&rsquo;s in the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the way people think. It&rsquo;s in the way people see the world. It&rsquo;s in the way they talk</p>
<p>even still to this day. And of course, I was talking about the directly relationship between</p>
<p>two soldiers, but there&rsquo;s something about the depth of human connection that results from the</p>
<p>almost like reverberations of war. Like generations later, you&rsquo;re still close to other humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a coldness towards other humans like in Russia, but once you open up, it&rsquo;s depth. You</p>
<p>seek depth of connection versus like breadth of a career kind of thinking, how can I make friends</p>
<p>with this? I can move into this direction. What can this person benefit me? Instead, you seek</p>
<p>a depth of human connection and appreciation that brings a lot. And maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing war here,</p>
<p>but it feels like that&rsquo;s inextricably connected to World War II for Russians. Does that resonate</p>
<p>at all? So if you look at military training, what they do is they take people in the military</p>
<p>from the civilian world. They bring them into the military and they put them through bootcamp,</p>
<p>which is the stereotypical thing that you see on TV. You&rsquo;re going to get yelled at.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get screamed at. You&rsquo;re going to get, you&rsquo;re going to get put in the mud and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be made to do hard things together. And what does that do with those</p>
<p>civilians? Well, it gives them a common background. It gives them a common suffering</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been through together and they form some sort of connection, some sort of bond.</p>
<p>Now to make that bond a little bit stronger, after you get done with bootcamp, they send you</p>
<p>to advanced infantry school and you suffer some more together. And when you suffer more together,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re in a smaller group too, because now it&rsquo;s infantry. It&rsquo;s not supply people anymore or</p>
<p>logisticians. It&rsquo;s strictly people that are going to fight. They&rsquo;re infantrymen.</p>
<p>So they go through a school together and now they get a little bit tighter, get done with that. And</p>
<p>maybe you go to an airborne division. So you go to airborne school and now you all</p>
<p>overcome this fear of jumping out of an airplane together and you celebrate surviving that.</p>
<p>Then maybe you get done with that. And now you go at an airborne division. Now you&rsquo;re an even tighter</p>
<p>group because you&rsquo;ve suffered together. What comes next is special forces training or ranger training.</p>
<p>And what they do is they put you in these situations where you&rsquo;re going to suffer together and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to build these bonds because as I said earlier, you have to rely on each other to survive.</p>
<p>And by the way, not everyone does, not everyone makes it through this training. So you sort of</p>
<p>have these memories of people that didn&rsquo;t make it. You share that connection as well.</p>
<p>And you can keep going down this road until you go into combat with a military unit and</p>
<p>military units that go through combat, have an even tighter bond. And the harder the combat that</p>
<p>they go through, the tighter the bond is going to be. So I think when you talk about what the</p>
<p>Soviet Union went through in World War II, there was a shared suffering to survive. And so the</p>
<p>entire nation has that common thread. And that&rsquo;s probably the thing that you sense or feel when you</p>
<p>refer back to the bond that resonates all the way back to World War II.</p>
<p>So in your podcast and your writing, you talk about some of the most fascinating things I listen</p>
<p>to you talk about in terms of military conflict is tactics and sort of the details of combat.</p>
<p>But allow me to stick on World War II for a second. There&rsquo;s a particular aspect to that war,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can speak to it, where twice the number of civilians died than military personnel.</p>
<p>So the Soviet Union, especially. My grandfather was a machine gunner in Ukraine as the Germans were</p>
<p>marching towards Moscow. There&rsquo;s this important push in 1941 where they were trying to get before</p>
<p>the winter to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing, he was trying to get to Moscow. He was trying to</p>
<p>get to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing is he was basically throwing bodies to slow the attack.</p>
<p>And what that meant is everybody understood that your job was, you have this heavy machine guns,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s almost unreasonable to be able to be mobile in any kind of way with them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thrown at the front and you&rsquo;re just nonstop shooting and 95 plus percent of people</p>
<p>are just dead. All the soldiers are just dead. And then you just go back and back and you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to protect as many civilians as you can throughout this whole process, but you don&rsquo;t. And so you have</p>
<p>millions of civilians that die along the way into this march. Is there something you could say about</p>
<p>this complete, perhaps it&rsquo;s naive of me to say, but a war that lacks tactics, that lacks strategy</p>
<p>and is purely about just no consideration of human life and just throwing bodies and bullets</p>
<p>into a mix together where millions die. And that in particular felt much less like conflict</p>
<p>and much more like torture or suffering. It didn&rsquo;t come off as torture only that interestingly</p>
<p>enough, as you probably know, my grandfather, including everybody else, volunteered. They were</p>
<p>proud to do this. They were proud to march to their death for country, for love of country.</p>
<p>But the question on the civilian side, when more civilians die, the military personnel,</p>
<p>what do you make of that? It&rsquo;s awful. It&rsquo;s awful when a soldier dies. It&rsquo;s awful when a civilian</p>
<p>dies. It&rsquo;s awful when 10 civilians or 10 soldiers. And it&rsquo;s even more awful when millions and millions</p>
<p>of soldiers and civilians die. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that the Soviet Union was facing an</p>
<p>existential threat to their existence against the Nazis. So to not fight would be to die as well,</p>
<p>maybe die a death a few years later, maybe die a different way. But</p>
<p>the choice was die now, trying or die later on your knees. And I think the choice was pretty clear.</p>
<p>As far as the tactics go, I mean, there is this is attrition warfare. That&rsquo;s what that is. We are</p>
<p>going to keep, you know, you said throwing bodies at the problem. That&rsquo;s attrition warfare. And the</p>
<p>Soviet Union had a lot of bodies, more than the Germans. And when you fight with attrition warfare,</p>
<p>whoever has more men and material will eventually win. It&rsquo;s an awful, it&rsquo;s an awful way. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what the strategy was. You often talk about leadership.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put the evils of Hitler aside. The boldness of Hitler in making some of the strategic</p>
<p>decisions he did was considered by many military historians quite brilliant, early in the war,</p>
<p>or insane and brilliant. Stalin, on the other hand, I think university is seen as somebody who is</p>
<p>terrible military strategist, especially early in the war. He did not see all the possible</p>
<p>trajectories that the war could take. Is there something you could say about failure of leadership,</p>
<p>Stalin, also the United Kingdom before Churchill, and also FDR on the United States side, who</p>
<p>basically, was trying to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening over over there,</p>
<p>with a perspective of we just want to make, we want to keep America&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>as the primary interest and everything else, let other countries work out their problems.</p>
<p>You know, I think one of the things with Hitler was in the beginning of the war,</p>
<p>he listened to his friends, his family, and he listened to his friends. He listened to</p>
<p>his generals. And therefore, they did pretty well with that. I think as the war went on,</p>
<p>he believed that he was smarter than he was, and made decisions that were bad, that cost him dearly.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, case in point, as everyone knows, going and attacking the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re still fighting a war on the other front is not not a good move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example of yeah, bad leadership, letting your ego get in the way believing that you can do</p>
<p>things that you that are beyond your capabilities. But, you know, as you mentioned in the beginning</p>
<p>with Blitzkrieg, those were really dynamic and bold moves. And they worked. And that what does</p>
<p>that do? That fuels your ego and makes you think that you can win.</p>
<p>Many people consider that war a just war. What do you think makes a just war?</p>
<p>I think you have the Nazis, and the Imperial Japanese trying to impose their will on other</p>
<p>nations and other peoples. And when that happens, I think on a grand scale, people look at that. And</p>
<p>believe it&rsquo;s just to step in and do something about it.</p>
<p>Is there some gray area here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s nothing but gray area.</p>
<p>The United States has been involved in a lot of military conflict since then.</p>
<p>How do you draw the line to the gray area? What, what war should we engage in and not?</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t get a lot of questions about that, but I think it&rsquo;s important that you</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t get into politics much. But what the decision to go to war,</p>
<p>you have to look at the situation that you&rsquo;re going into. And you have to make sure that you have</p>
<p>the will to go to war. And the will to go to war means that you are willing to kill people.</p>
<p>And when I say people, I don&rsquo;t just mean enemy, because in war,</p>
<p>civilians are going to die, women and children are going to die. Every a lot of people are</p>
<p>going to die. And so you and you are going to kill them. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of</p>
<p>smart munitions you have. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how disciplined your soldiers are. When you go into</p>
<p>a war, civilians are going to die and you have to understand that. And the other thing that</p>
<p>you have to understand is that your troops are also going to die. And it seems like sometimes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a little bit naive about the calculation of what that&rsquo;s going to look like.</p>
<p>And maybe we think, well, not that many civilians and maybe not that many of our our personnel are</p>
<p>going to die. And that&rsquo;s where you get into sticky situations. And, you know, another thing when you</p>
<p>were talking about the Soviet Union versus the Nazis, that&rsquo;s total war. That&rsquo;s what that is. And</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t engage in that very often. It&rsquo;s total war. It&rsquo;s we will do absolutely anything to win.</p>
<p>And America doesn&rsquo;t fight like that very often. In fact, the last time we fought like that was</p>
<p>World War Two. We it was total war. We will do whatever it takes to up to and including</p>
<p>the atomic bomb to destroy the enemy. So those are the kind of things you need to think about</p>
<p>before you go to war. And I don&rsquo;t think we think about that very often.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we think about that very often. You know, even the United States, the atomic bomb,</p>
<p>nuclear weapons is an interesting one because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of hesitation on that. There&rsquo;s a lot of critics of that decision as it was happening.</p>
<p>So even America, you could imagine other countries like Germany would not be so hesitant</p>
<p>to use nuclear weapons. It&rsquo;s interesting to think about in deciding military strategy to inject</p>
<p>ethics into it, into morality. It&rsquo;s not just about winning the war, but should we do this</p>
<p>and doing the calculation of human life. Usually those decisions are made by leaders,</p>
<p>not by the soldier that&rsquo;s going to be implementing</p>
<p>that decision. Do you put some responsibility, I should even say blame on the leaders</p>
<p>and not doing that kind of calculation here? You could say that about the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>you could say that about even the war that you were involved with in Iraq.</p>
<p>Is there some criticism here that you could apply to leaders for failing not to consider</p>
<p>that the broader moral questions? Yes.</p>
<p>Natural, like all leaders will make these mistakes or should leaders not make these mistakes?</p>
<p>Leaders are going to make mistakes. It&rsquo;s impossible to know what&rsquo;s going to happen in war,</p>
<p>just like it&rsquo;s impossible to know what&rsquo;s going to happen in life.</p>
<p>You make decisions based on the information that you have at the time and you will make mistakes.</p>
<p>If you fail to admit that you made a mistake, that&rsquo;s where I have a more significant problem</p>
<p>than someone that makes a mistake and says, hey, this is the mistake that I made. This is the</p>
<p>intelligence that I thought we were utilizing and it actually is not what I thought it was going to</p>
<p>be. And here&rsquo;s the new direction that we&rsquo;re going in. We don&rsquo;t have enough of that type of ownership</p>
<p>in leadership globally. Just saying I made a mistake</p>
<p>that resulted in a loss at scale of human life, being able to say that.</p>
<p>Being able to say that. And when you don&rsquo;t say that, you end up with a more loss of human life.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about the loss of human life? How does killing a human being change you?</p>
<p>What does it mean to kill a human being? What does it feel like to kill a human being?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess you&rsquo;d have to look at what circumstances a person&rsquo;s in when this is taking</p>
<p>place. If you&rsquo;ve got someone that&rsquo;s in a, a fit of rage that goes and kills somebody,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re going to come out of it and think, wow, I&rsquo;ve just really messed up.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a, someone that is a sociopath, right? They&rsquo;re not going to feel anything.</p>
<p>And that person deserved to die. And that&rsquo;s why they died. If you&rsquo;ve got a soldier who feels like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to protect their friends, they&rsquo;ll move through that. If you&rsquo;ve got a soldier that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing it because they want some kind of personal glory, they&rsquo;ll probably not feel good about it</p>
<p>later. So I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the psychology of the</p>
<p>individual that&rsquo;s going through it. He said, move through that.</p>
<p>Is there some calculation here that a soldier, when they kill another soldier,</p>
<p>a realization that is just another human being,</p>
<p>I mean, is there some heavy burden to that aspect that it&rsquo;s ultimately just human on human?</p>
<p>I think it depends a lot on the scenario. I know that when I was in Iraq fighting,</p>
<p>we, we talk a lot about the dehumanization of the enemy and it&rsquo;s something that the</p>
<p>governments will do. I mean, governments will do that to each other. I mean, the Japanese dehumanized</p>
<p>the Americans and the Americans dehumanized the Japanese and the Americans dehumanized the Nazis</p>
<p>and the Nazis dehumanized the Americans so that to remove as much of that human on human killing</p>
<p>aspect that you&rsquo;re talking about. And what I would say is that the Japanese</p>
<p>human killing aspect that you&rsquo;re talking about. And what I, what I&rsquo;ve said is that</p>
<p>in, when we were in Iraq, we didn&rsquo;t have to dehumanize the enemy because the,</p>
<p>the enemy dehumanized themselves through their actions, through their behaviors.</p>
<p>When, when we know that they are torturing and raping and murdering the local populace,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been dehumanized. And so as far as looking at them and thinking, oh, this is a,</p>
<p>you know, a human, another human that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s on the level of, you know, my, my uncle or my brother,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t think of them out that way. I thought of them as,</p>
<p>as murdering, raping, evil, subhumans.</p>
<p>Yeah. Rock is different and America&rsquo;s position is different. You&rsquo;re right. That America has not</p>
<p>been involved in a war where it&rsquo;s quite like two humans fighting, like teenage boys fighting</p>
<p>against each other. And you&rsquo;ve got to remember that America</p>
<p>has not been involved in a war where it&rsquo;s quite like two humans fighting, like teenage boys fighting</p>
<p>against each other. And you&rsquo;ve got to remember, I mean, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re seeing these Iraqi kids</p>
<p>that are living under this sadistic, sadistic terror, the Iraqi women that are being raped</p>
<p>and so on the one side we become the, the Iraqi populace is very humanized to us because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to them. We&rsquo;ve got interpreters, we understand we&rsquo;re seeing them day after day,</p>
<p>the same individuals. And so we form a bond with the local populace and yet we see what the</p>
<p>insurgents are doing. And so it&rsquo;s again, not difficult to dehumanize people that behave in</p>
<p>that manner. Yeah. I suppose I&rsquo;m, I worry about the dehumanization at a much larger scale when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the kind of case that you&rsquo;re talking about. Even now, hopefully I&rsquo;m not fear mongering,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sense in which there&rsquo;s the drums of war slowly starting to build with China.</p>
<p>There, in the best case, it would be a cold war of, there&rsquo;s a dehumanization aspect that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with China currently, which is they&rsquo;re the other and they&rsquo;re after stealing all of your</p>
<p>data. There&rsquo;s a cybersecurity, it starts with cybersecurity and it worries me because it</p>
<p>creates the other out of a very large population that may ultimately lead to conflict.</p>
<p>In the worst case, hot conflict that would no longer be the situation you are in in Iraq</p>
<p>and more similar to the Soviet Union conflict with Germany that it&rsquo;s kids and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dehumanized to where you&rsquo;re at scale slaughtering them or at least hurting their quality of life</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s maybe, you know, suffering has many forms. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be through just</p>
<p>a hot war. It could be through starvation, through camps, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And I worry about that. We kind of tend to think that these wars are behind us</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not always so sure that&rsquo;s the case. And at least in the way that, it ultimately starts</p>
<p>with hate and it, again, hopefully I&rsquo;m not being too dramatic, but I see that there&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>brewing of, it starts with dehumanization that turns to hate of the other. You see that with</p>
<p>China, you see it a little bit with Russia and you have an early podcast with between the</p>
<p>where you break down the tactics of the Chechen war versus Russia. It&rsquo;s fascinating. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the kind of conflicts I&rsquo;m referring to. And I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s a, I know you&rsquo;re a bit of</p>
<p>a musician. I love, I love Dire Straits song called Brothers in Arms. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>know that one. And there&rsquo;s a line in it. I think they play it quite often at military funerals,</p>
<p>which I just recently learned, but it&rsquo;s this powerful song that has a line, we&rsquo;re fools to</p>
<p>make war on our brothers in arms. Do you think there&rsquo;s some sense in which at the leadership</p>
<p>level, but just as human beings, we&rsquo;re perhaps foolish and engaging in military conflict</p>
<p>as much as we have, or as fool, a very inappropriate word here.</p>
<p>Well, I think that using the term brothers in arms means the people that are on my side,</p>
<p>right? So it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to start wars with people that are on your side. So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that might just be the way the lyrics are written so that it fit the song or whatever.</p>
<p>I think broadly what you&rsquo;re asking me is, is war foolish? Yeah. And I would say the answer is yes.</p>
<p>And if you can avoid it, you absolutely should. But if there is a bear or a wolf that is trying</p>
<p>to get into your house, is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf? I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the answer. Is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf? I think the answer is pretty</p>
<p>obvious. So when you&rsquo;re threatened or your family are threatened or your way of life is threatened,</p>
<p>then you have to do something to try and defend your family, your way of life. It should be the</p>
<p>last resort. You had a conversation with Jordan Peterson where he asked you a question</p>
<p>in terms of war being the last resort, whether you would like your kids to grow up in peace</p>
<p>in a time of no war. You said yes, but, and so happens Jordan didn&rsquo;t let you finish. Can you,</p>
<p>can you elaborate what follows the but? Well, you, you and I have been talking about the fact that</p>
<p>struggle brings people together and, and brings out the best and, and the worst, brings out the</p>
<p>worst in people. War brings out the worst in people. It also brings out the best in people.</p>
<p>So would you want your kid to go and enter in a wrestling tournament where</p>
<p>you paid all the other kids off and your kid won? Or you enter them in a jujitsu tournament where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a purple belt and you know that everyone that they&rsquo;re going to fight against is a white</p>
<p>belt. And so they get the, they get the big W, they get the win, but they don&rsquo;t really get tested</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really struggle. And if you don&rsquo;t struggle, you don&rsquo;t grow. So that&rsquo;s the, but</p>
<p>right. Um, the, the absolute best times of my life were in combat and the worst times of my life were</p>
<p>in combat. And so even though I wouldn&rsquo;t want any of my children to suffer through the worst of times</p>
<p>at the same time, the but is I would want them to have the opportunity to feel that bond that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re referring to earlier and to see human beings that are willing to sacrifice their</p>
<p>lives for their friends. You mentioned the worst. What are some of the worst aspects of</p>
<p>when you were in Iraq? Well, what are the things that, um, the hardest on you having my guys killed?</p>
<p>Is there, uh, absurd cruelty to it? Was it due to mistakes or natural consequences of, of fighting?</p>
<p>Is there any difference? Is that at the end is just losing? Those are brothers in arms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million different ways to get killed in the war and you can go out on an operation and you</p>
<p>can do everything wrong and you can survive and you can go out in an operation and do everything</p>
<p>perfect and you can get killed. Is there some aspect which makes it worse when there is mistakes</p>
<p>made? Well, yeah, if there&rsquo;s mistakes made, then you&rsquo;re going to sit there and beat yourself up</p>
<p>eternally for mistakes that were made. But to you, the things that hurt is just losing,</p>
<p>losing people close to you. Yes. Are you yourself afraid of death? No.</p>
<p>Are you yourself afraid of death? No. Do you think about it? Does it make sense to you that this</p>
<p>thing ends? Like do you, uh, the Stoics contemplated death. It gives flavor to life.</p>
<p>It makes you appreciate, there&rsquo;s something about finiteness of life that makes it, that makes it</p>
<p>this, uh, Jocko Discipline Go drink, sour apple that I&rsquo;m enjoying is delicious. Makes it taste</p>
<p>better because I&rsquo;m going to die one day. And I think about that a lot. Do you think about it?</p>
<p>Other than I know that it&rsquo;s going to end. I mean, but I don&rsquo;t think about it on a daily basis. I</p>
<p>think about the fact I think about, I know that I&rsquo;m lucky to be here. I know that many people</p>
<p>sacrificed to give me this opportunity to be here. So, but I don&rsquo;t dwell on it.</p>
<p>What about when you were in combat? Nothing. There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s tactics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s strategy, there&rsquo;s the mission. And then your mortality is not part of the calculation.</p>
<p>I think you get to a point where you accept the fact that you can die. Like I, I, you know,</p>
<p>like I said, you can do everything right. You roll out the gate, you hit an ID, a triple stack</p>
<p>subsurface ID and you&rsquo;re dead. You&rsquo;re done. And there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s going to stop that. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen. And I think if you&rsquo;re scared of that or you&rsquo;re thinking about that, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>inhibit your ability to do your job properly. And I think it&rsquo;s also going to drive you crazy.</p>
<p>The thing that I thought about more was that happening to my guys. And that&rsquo;s the gut wrenching</p>
<p>terror that you feel when, when operations happen. Can I ask you about love of country? It&rsquo;s, it</p>
<p>continues to just how much I&rsquo;ve studied Stalin recently in the past few years. It continues to</p>
<p>surprise me, not surprise me. It&rsquo;s just tragic in some kind of way. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly if I could</p>
<p>put words to it, but how many people and still do, but at the time were willing, loved Stalin</p>
<p>and were willing to die for country for the love of country. And I too, maybe because I was born</p>
<p>there and now I am a red blooded American. I love nationalism is a bad word, but I love the love of</p>
<p>country. It gives, it somehow gives a meaning like a brotherhood, like we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>I love that&rsquo;s why I love the Olympics. That&rsquo;s just the, the unity of it. It takes a step out of the</p>
<p>selfish pursuits of any one particular ant and looks at us as a big ant colony and it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s exciting, but at the same time, it seems to get us to do horrible things.</p>
<p>If, if manipulated by charismatic leaders, what do you make of this love of country? Is it a,</p>
<p>is it a bad thing? Is it a thing that gets in the way or is it a good thing?</p>
<p>Well, I think like anything else, if it&rsquo;s balanced correctly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great. And if it goes to some extreme level, then it becomes a negative.</p>
<p>And I think it, I think it&rsquo;s probably sourced in some sort of animalistic tribalism that we all</p>
<p>have to be part of a tribe. And this is a real big tribe that you get to be a part of. And all</p>
<p>you have to do is kind of show up. And so when someone says, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to play hockey</p>
<p>against the Russians, well, we&rsquo;re going to cheer for the American boys.</p>
<p>So my, my area of work is artificial intelligence. It&rsquo;d be interesting to ask your thoughts about</p>
<p>something, which is autonomous weapon systems. US has now officially released the report saying</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re open to, not open, they&rsquo;re engaging in, in adding more and more autonomy and artificial</p>
<p>intelligence into its weapon systems because China is doing it. So there&rsquo;s, these are the first steps</p>
<p>in something that AI folks worry about, which is a race, an AI race in the space of autonomous</p>
<p>weapons that can run away too quickly. Is that something, I don&rsquo;t know if in general,</p>
<p>if you have thoughts about weapon systems that make autonomous decisions</p>
<p>at the small scale of just targeting where to shoot and at the largest scale of military strategy</p>
<p>of just being given a mission of destroy this particular target, this particular, say terrorist</p>
<p>human being, and then figure out what is the right bombing campaign on your own to accomplish</p>
<p>this task that minimizes civilian death. And then just loading that in and letting the AI system</p>
<p>automatically decide that. What are your general thoughts about it? Do you, do you worry about it?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s the positive effects that in the best version of that world, you kill fewer</p>
<p>civilians, you kill, hurt fewer of your own human beings. But at the negative side of that,</p>
<p>you might lose the thing we kind of talked about, which is the basic humanity, even in the individual</p>
<p>soldier of what is right and what is wrong and not making huge mistakes that hurt thousands</p>
<p>or millions of people. I guess what you&rsquo;re asking me is if they could make a machine that could</p>
<p>do more surgical attacks on enemy individuals, would I be for it? Yes, I would be for it.</p>
<p>The problem is if you&rsquo;ve ever used machines of any kind, their initial design may not be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s unintended consequences. There&rsquo;s ways in the machine actually behaves that you realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bugs in this thing. So do we not put protocols in place to prevent something from</p>
<p>going too far outside the boundaries of what we wanted to execute? You do. But the question is,</p>
<p>this is the first time in human history you can create things, machines, toaster, microwave oven,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s smarter than you in this particular task. I mean, it&rsquo;s not yet there. What you&rsquo;re learning a</p>
<p>lot with military strategies, humans are actually really damn smart. It&rsquo;s very hard to improve on a</p>
<p>human. And so most actual drones that are unmanned are still piloted by humans. It&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to do every aspect of war. But it&rsquo;s not out of the realm of possibility that machines will start</p>
<p>doing those things better in certain things, certain more precise targeting of the enemy.</p>
<p>The question is, so what happens when you start to rely on the machine to do some of the task</p>
<p>is you get lazy. You forget what it is like to do that task or more importantly, you lose the</p>
<p>knowledge of the intricacies of that task and you forget the ways it can go wrong. So the protocols</p>
<p>may not be sufficient to constrain the power of the ways that things go wrong, especially when</p>
<p>things are moving really quickly, especially when the ethics of the two sides aren&rsquo;t perfectly</p>
<p>aligned. When people are some certain sides, like on the Chinese side, may be more willing to take</p>
<p>risks for dangerous consequences than others. So what happened on the bioweapon side</p>
<p>is internationally, maybe you can speak to this more, but my sense, what I was told,</p>
<p>there is a sense globally that bioweapons are not going to be used. They&rsquo;re unethical. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sense like we&rsquo;re not going to engage in this. And with AI currently, China and US said, green light,</p>
<p>all go ahead. It&rsquo;s totally ethical. If it can decrease the loss of human life, why not?</p>
<p>And my worry is that it&rsquo;s much easier to design weapons that are effective than design weapons</p>
<p>who have the depth of ethics and morals that humans do, which I think we don&rsquo;t as human</p>
<p>beings don&rsquo;t acknowledge enough that even like the cold calculated killing of others,</p>
<p>like precise, effective execution of a mission still has ethics in it. At every level, you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong. And I don&rsquo;t know if you take that away, you&rsquo;re not going to make</p>
<p>huge mistakes that you regret. Is that something you don&rsquo;t worry about?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really worry about it. But as you design something, like I said, you put protocols in place</p>
<p>and from what I am hearing you say, or trying to hear you say, there&rsquo;s be a point where our</p>
<p>protocols wouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient to stop the machine from doing something that was unethical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of worried that this is something you don&rsquo;t worry about. Because a lot of people I</p>
<p>respect don&rsquo;t worry about it. And I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that. A lot of generals don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about it. A lot of people who know much more about war, like you than me, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>And that worries me.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because you have a vision into the shortfalls of AI. And I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>vision of the shortfalls of AI. I don&rsquo;t know enough about it. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you put</p>
<p>a on off switch somewhere, you put a kill switch on a system. And if it starts going awry, you hit</p>
<p>the kill switch, and that&rsquo;s it. So if you know, when you look at me and say, well, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>possible way to put a kill switch, that would be 100% effective. And here&rsquo;s, you draw those concerns</p>
<p>to me. And we could talk through it and say, okay, well, here&rsquo;s where we should draw the line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, again, for the Soviet Union, Chernobyl meltdown, there was always the ability,</p>
<p>I believe, to have a kill switch. The problem is, the more power you give to the machine,</p>
<p>the more opportunity you give to the human supervising that machine to make a mistake</p>
<p>and not shut off the switch at the right time. So yes, the solution, I mean, you&rsquo;re putting the</p>
<p>responsibility still in the human hands. And I think that&rsquo;s the correct place to put it. There</p>
<p>should be good protocols, good leadership, good execution, competency all around. Your</p>
<p>protocols should consider the basic failures of human nature, the human factor of how things go</p>
<p>wrong. So there should be multiple people supervising the system, all those things. But</p>
<p>I am just very skeptical of greater and greater power in the machine that can create war, that</p>
<p>cannot lead to death. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s why, like I said, and like you just said, you have protocols</p>
<p>in place that are a kill switch. And if you think about the amount of nuclear weapons that we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>on planet Earth for the past however many years, and there&rsquo;s been no rogue element that said,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;m going to shoot this thing. There&rsquo;s been no protocol that took place where</p>
<p>all of a sudden we said, oh no. I mean, there&rsquo;s been escalations, but the protocols worked,</p>
<p>have worked so far. Now, that&rsquo;s a scary thing to think about, that we rely on these protocols to</p>
<p>stop some rogue element out there from launching a missile that could kill millions of people and</p>
<p>trigger a global war. So yeah, the protocols should be strict. Okay. Can I ask a Jack O Wonka</p>
<p>ridiculous question? If human civilization goes extinct, what would be the reason? You mentioned</p>
<p>nuclear war. Do you worry about this? The reason I bring that up, a lot of people in the</p>
<p>AI community worry about artificial general intelligence. So super intelligent AI systems</p>
<p>creating a lot of damage. Autonomous weapon systems is one possibility. A lot of folks</p>
<p>recently, especially with this pandemic, if you want to be terrified, listen, somebody I talked</p>
<p>to recently, Sam Harris, he did a four hour podcast on how bioengineering of viruses is likely</p>
<p>to destroy human civilization. I recommend that highly if you were too optimistic about the</p>
<p>future of the human species. So apparently in the space of bioengineering is becoming easier and</p>
<p>easier and easier to engineer viruses, engineer pathogens. This is the world&rsquo;s most depressing</p>
<p>question. Is there something in particular you worry about? Like that we should be thinking as</p>
<p>a human species about? Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you again with my lack of worry for all these</p>
<p>problems, but I don&rsquo;t worry too much about it. You know what? We&rsquo;ve made it through a bunch of</p>
<p>wickets so far as a species and we&rsquo;ll make it through some more or we won&rsquo;t. And if we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it through some of these wickets and someone decides that what they&rsquo;re going to do over the</p>
<p>weekend is create some crazy virus that spreads and kills everybody. Yeah. You know what? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>usually extremely optimistic about this stuff. I am now I&rsquo;m with you except we won&rsquo;t. Well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a chance we won&rsquo;t, but I have a sense that human, first of all, I believe that</p>
<p>most people have much more capacity for good than evil. All of us are capable of evil, I believe,</p>
<p>but most people are much more capable of doing good and want to do good. And I also believe in</p>
<p>the resiliency of the human species that we&rsquo;re an innovative bunch and we can respond to tragedy,</p>
<p>especially we respond more to tragedy as the scale of tragedy grows and our response is much</p>
<p>better. So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not worried about it, bro. What makes a great man? Let&rsquo;s start at the</p>
<p>individual. What makes a great man? What makes a great woman? What makes a great human being?</p>
<p>Somebody that puts others above themselves. What makes a great leader of humans?</p>
<p>Same thing.</p>
<p>But that sentence does a lot of work. When you&rsquo;re a leader, there&rsquo;s a lot of egos. There&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of tension. There&rsquo;s the human factor. There&rsquo;s people who are timid. There&rsquo;s people who are</p>
<p>assholes. There&rsquo;s people who are incredibly competent, but self obsessed. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s complexities of human nature. How do you get all those people to be the best version of</p>
<p>themselves and to lift up everyone else around them?</p>
<p>Okay. So now that, that question is a little bit different now. So now it&rsquo;s getting into a more</p>
<p>specific question, but at the same time, a more broad question of what elements does it take to</p>
<p>make a good leader? So you&rsquo;re right that different people have different personalities, different</p>
<p>tendencies, different levels of ego. And the, the way that I try and explain this is like a</p>
<p>video game. And I&rsquo;m not even a video game player, but I&rsquo;ve seen this before where video game</p>
<p>characters have various skills, various strengths and weaknesses. So maybe they&rsquo;re strong, but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dumb, or maybe they&rsquo;re strong and smart, but they&rsquo;re slow. They just give them these,</p>
<p>these ratings. And so that&rsquo;s where human beings are. And that&rsquo;s the way leaders are. And you can</p>
<p>have different leaders with different characteristics. And depending on how all those</p>
<p>characteristics match up, you can have somebody that is very introverted, but they&rsquo;re a, but,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still a very good leader because when they do communicate, they do it in a clear,</p>
<p>simple manner that everyone understands. So even though they&rsquo;re a little bit introverted,</p>
<p>people still respect them and listen to them because they communicate in a clear way.</p>
<p>You could have somebody that&rsquo;s extremely charismatic, extremely charismatic and everyone</p>
<p>looks to them, but they&rsquo;re slow in making decisions. And so now we&rsquo;ve got someone that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really make decisions when decisions need to get made. So even though they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>charismatic, they&rsquo;re still not a good leader. So depending on the human being that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about, and you just mentioned earlier that human beings are, you know, more complex than anything</p>
<p>and do a better job at just about everything than a robot. So that&rsquo;s the same thing with</p>
<p>leadership. You&rsquo;ve got all these different characteristics and you, you match them or mix</p>
<p>them together. And depending on where the ratings come out, depending on how that thing does in the</p>
<p>end, can we almost like as a case study, look at a few people in the tech area that I&rsquo;m familiar</p>
<p>with that I know well, we can, the only caveat being that I may have no familiarization with</p>
<p>them whatsoever. You may have to brief me on them. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ll do my best to brief. I&rsquo;ll do my best</p>
<p>to reduce human beings into simple descriptions. And then you can give me insights of why the hell</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re such effective leaders based on my description, not based on your actual deep</p>
<p>knowledge of the human beings. So that caveat of my inability to speak both the English language</p>
<p>and describe humans well. Let&rsquo;s talk about first, Elon Musk. So he&rsquo;s known as being quite</p>
<p>harsh in the sense of, first of all, a very high bar of excellence.</p>
<p>And also willing to what he calls that kind of first principles thinking of asking the,</p>
<p>the questions that hurt, which is why the hell are we doing it this way?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t it be done a lot, but not just better, but a lot better. So, so let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear his whole character. I&rsquo;ll go one at one section at a time. So we&rsquo;ve got a guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s harsh and, and asking the really hard questions. How can that be good? Or why is that</p>
<p>good? Well, first of all, it can be horrible. And there&rsquo;s leaders out there that are harsh and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hated and no one likes them and no one wants to work for them and they never do anything.</p>
<p>So what is it that Elon Musk does that makes, gives him the ability to be harsh? So I was, I was</p>
<p>hearing a description of me when I would give feedback to young seals that had made mistakes</p>
<p>during training operations. And the description was that I, same thing, like this harsh blunt force</p>
<p>trauma and just totally direct sledgehammer of truth that I would hit guys with. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting because I always talk about, you know, building relationships and making sure you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>offending someone. Yeah. So how do these things match up? Well, I can tell you how they match up</p>
<p>when I was being harsh, the guys that I was being harsh with knew without one shred of doubt that</p>
<p>I cared about them more than anything else. And that the reason I was giving them this feedback</p>
<p>is because I wanted them to be able to lead their troops. I wanted them to be able to go</p>
<p>accomplish their mission. And I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t being harsh because it elevated my ego. I wasn&rsquo;t being harsh because I wanted to</p>
<p>denigrate them. I was being, actually being harsh because I wanted them to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p>Because I wanted them to accomplish the mission. So if that&rsquo;s where Elon comes from,</p>
<p>hey, listen, we got to make this happen. This is for the good of the world to do this.</p>
<p>And people know that then it works. I&rsquo;ll bring this point back up with another guy,</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, but let me stay on Elon for a second. The other thing he does, which is interesting,</p>
<p>I see the value of this. It&rsquo;d be great to hear you speak about it. He&rsquo;s unlike many of the other</p>
<p>CEOs, very rich billionaires, involved in leading a lot of people. He puts a lot of time into making</p>
<p>sure he&rsquo;s on the factory floor. He famously sleeps on the, sort of like in the middle of things.</p>
<p>And he puts a lot of effort. He&rsquo;s also very good at it is being a low level engineer. So like,</p>
<p>whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details and he&rsquo;ll talk to the lowest level person</p>
<p>in terms of like, somebody who&rsquo;s like working literally on putting parts together. He wants to</p>
<p>understand what the problem is, what the challenge is. If there&rsquo;s an emergency, he wants to understand</p>
<p>the actual details of the problem, not like delegating it to a manager, but like,</p>
<p>because a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will talk about sort of the power and the importance</p>
<p>of delegation. Here, he wants to know if there&rsquo;s a big problem, he wants to know the exact detail.</p>
<p>He wants to know the exact problem. He wants to, at the fundamental level, understand how to solve</p>
<p>that problem. Whether it has to do with materials, whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing,</p>
<p>the mechanical engineering aspect, like we&rsquo;re talking about engineering. This is a guy who</p>
<p>wears a suit as a CEO, tweets about Dogecoin, but like an actual job, he&rsquo;s low level engineering.</p>
<p>And that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it, like he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s scalable, but that&rsquo;s always been inspiring to me. And I wonder how many people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inspiring to. Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that, of no matter how high your</p>
<p>level of leader is, to be able to do the low level shit. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s a common trait that good</p>
<p>leaders have. And maybe he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know how to do everything, a good leader,</p>
<p>but they go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say, Hey, what is the issue that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with? Or, you know, how can I support you? How can I give you help? And one key point that</p>
<p>you said is, he said, when there&rsquo;s a problem, he gets in there. So there&rsquo;s things happening</p>
<p>at his companies that they&rsquo;re working. And so he doesn&rsquo;t have to die. I&rsquo;m not saying he never does,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t have to spend as much time working on or looking at some subsystem that&rsquo;s functioning</p>
<p>well. He&rsquo;s got a good leader in there that&rsquo;s handling it. And he checks in with that leader.</p>
<p>And the leader says, yeah, it&rsquo;s working perfectly. He says, great. When there&rsquo;s a problem, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he fully understands it. So</p>
<p>that he, when he digs down in the details, and this is important, he&rsquo;s coming from an altitude</p>
<p>where he has a better, bigger perspective, not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective.</p>
<p>So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever, for eight hours and you&rsquo;re staring</p>
<p>at, you know, if you were planning a mission and you were planning it for eight hours,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re staring at the maps and the charts and you&rsquo;re figuring out where all the troops are</p>
<p>going to be located. And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a distant</p>
<p>perspective, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;ll be able to see holes in your plan that you couldn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>because your perspective was too close. So that&rsquo;s good for me to be able to come in from a higher</p>
<p>perspective and have a look at it. But also there&rsquo;s times where I need to get down there and</p>
<p>actually look, you know, if you&rsquo;re looking at a problem and you say, look, I can&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>boss, I can&rsquo;t figure out how to get to this target. And I&rsquo;m looking at it from a distance and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see, I might need to start digging in and looking and saying, Oh, here&rsquo;s a route that we</p>
<p>can take that actually makes sense. Let&rsquo;s try that. So I think it&rsquo;s a good example of someone</p>
<p>going up and down in altitude to look at problems, understanding what&rsquo;s happening with the frontline</p>
<p>troops. And at the same time, being able to go back to the strategic level. And I can, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably this way. The reason that he&rsquo;s successful is because he doesn&rsquo;t get stuck down there.</p>
<p>Yeah. Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do that.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that.</p>
<p>Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, Hey, this is what the function needs to be.</p>
<p>And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it</p>
<p>happen. If he had to actually do that all himself, most likely not possible. So that&rsquo;s what leaders</p>
<p>should be doing. They should go elevate and, and, and then get down in the weeds when they have to,</p>
<p>and then go back up. The sad thing, this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup</p>
<p>is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies. Just like you said, he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering. It&rsquo;s dealing with like,</p>
<p>in this, in the case of the company, life and death, like something that can just completely</p>
<p>damage the production line, right? So he&rsquo;s constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out</p>
<p>fires. And I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something to be said about that psychology of that, of how,</p>
<p>like he, he&rsquo;s spoken himself that he&rsquo;s worried whether his mind can hold up much longer.</p>
<p>So hopefully in the near future, he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some</p>
<p>subordinate leadership that he fully trusts. And most important that he has properly trained</p>
<p>so that they can handle these day to day fires at least 80% of them. So only 20% of the time,</p>
<p>does he actually need to go in and solve a problem. If he&rsquo;s not doing that right now,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s going to end up being a problem anytime. So I work with companies all the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s interesting about this is I go and work with a CEO or with a,</p>
<p>with a C suite of a company. It takes a little while to figure out what&rsquo;s going on. I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>going off of the things that you&rsquo;re telling me almost anecdotally, right? Yes. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say that what you and also, I don&rsquo;t know how familiar you actually are with the inner workings</p>
<p>of his companies, but if we were to assume that what you&rsquo;re saying is accurate, then my advice</p>
<p>would be, Hey, listen, you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort into training up</p>
<p>some subordinate leadership that has the trust, knowledge, and expertise that you will be able</p>
<p>to turn over some of these, some of these details to for two reasons. Number one, so you can let</p>
<p>your brain, you know, you can, you can survive a little longer as he put it, but also all the</p>
<p>time that you spend as a leader, looking down and into your organization is time that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not looking up and out. So when you&rsquo;re not looking up and out, you&rsquo;re not seeing what</p>
<p>the competitors doing. You&rsquo;re not seeing where the market&rsquo;s going. There&rsquo;s problems that,</p>
<p>that, that can come from that. So if right now he&rsquo;s spending too much time looking down and in,</p>
<p>and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don&rsquo;t know if I want to do a startup. When you do a</p>
<p>startup, you&rsquo;re going to be looking down and in for a while. It&rsquo;s going to take a while. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to do all this work yourself. You&rsquo;re not going to have the finances to put</p>
<p>people manpower behind these things. So that&rsquo;s probably he, maybe he&rsquo;s in that mindset a little</p>
<p>bit because he&rsquo;s done so many startups over the years. And so he&rsquo;s in the he&rsquo;s habitually in the</p>
<p>weeds. So my advice would be, all right, let&rsquo;s start looking at formulating some subordinate</p>
<p>leadership that has the, like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can, you can start</p>
<p>to turn over some of these more minute details to them so that you can start looking up and out.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think he&rsquo;s done that more successful in some places than others. The SpaceX, a lot of</p>
<p>people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of SpaceX as, as a very successful</p>
<p>person that runs shit, but in Tesla, not as much. So I wonder if you can comment on something</p>
<p>a lot of people worry about, and this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people</p>
<p>worry about that if Elon disappears, the, the, the innovative spirit, the company is as we know them</p>
<p>today will collapse, will stagnate and will basically fail to do what they&rsquo;ve been doing for</p>
<p>so many years successfully. Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader that if you disappear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the thing still lives on and not just lives on, but thrives.</p>
<p>Yeah. So what we have to do in those situations is we have to establish a strong culture inside</p>
<p>that organization. And if you&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s reasons why this happens, right? If I have</p>
<p>a big ego and I form a company and I love the fact that everyone looks at me and says, Oh,</p>
<p>Jocko made this company and he&rsquo;s the creative force behind this company. And that fuels my ego</p>
<p>and it makes me feel good. And you know, I&rsquo;m working with you, Lex. And every time you come</p>
<p>up with an idea, I say, Lex, you need to stay in your box. Yeah. Right. So I&rsquo;m not creating a culture</p>
<p>that rewards that sort of creativity. And eventually when I die, I won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>have educated my team on how to maintain that creative aspect. So again, hopefully inside</p>
<p>that organization, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s encouraging and growing that culture where creativity is rewarded,</p>
<p>where, where it flourishes, even when he&rsquo;s gone, that&rsquo;s what we have to hope for.</p>
<p>He is, but I also seem to notice that there&rsquo;s not many people like him.</p>
<p>Um, people become complacent too easily. I&rsquo;ve been disappointed by people a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, success makes people soft. With Elon, it seems like success doesn&rsquo;t have any effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the reverse effect. It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next biggest thing, right? He&rsquo;s living that exponential growth,</p>
<p>which I think that&rsquo;s the problem that you have to have somebody who&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>trying to find the 10 X solution, like trying to constantly improve things.</p>
<p>And, uh, restlessly that, I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people,</p>
<p>not just creating the culture, but creating a culture with the right set of people.</p>
<p>Speaking of which Steve Jobs, there&rsquo;s, uh, two things I want to mention there.</p>
<p>One, once again, the harshness, but a very different kind.</p>
<p>And the second is team building. So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elon</p>
<p>in a way, in the following way. And I&rsquo;m having a sense that you will not like this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to defend it is he loses his shit quite a bit. He was famously, at least,</p>
<p>especially early on being very emotional. He was letting passion dominate the discussion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a lot of firings. There would be a lot of mean things said to people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you make of that. How much as a leader,</p>
<p>are you allowed to just lose your shit in your love for the thing you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>And how effective is that?</p>
<p>As a leader, you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that very often.</p>
<p>So you can look back at me and say, well, Jocko, here&rsquo;s the most profitable company that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>existed. And so you&rsquo;re wrong. Well, going back to that multiple multitude of characteristics that</p>
<p>human beings can have. Well, it&rsquo;s the same thing with businesses. It&rsquo;s the same thing with companies.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs was off the charts in some of his traits, his ability to understand design,</p>
<p>his ability to understand human interface with computer systems. So, so far off the charts</p>
<p>that despite his bad temper, emotional behavior, the company still thrived.</p>
<p>That can happen. You can have people that are horrible leaders that develop something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so universally outstanding that you end up with a company that&rsquo;s successful.</p>
<p>The reason, I mean, I get asked that a bunch, people always ask me, because I say, look,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be losing your temper as a leader. Well, what about Steve Jobs? He used to yell and</p>
<p>scream all the time. Great. When people say that to me, I say, oh, okay. Are you as good at design</p>
<p>as Steve Jobs was? Are you as good at marketing as Steve Jobs was? He had a certain amount of skills</p>
<p>that were off the charts. And so he was able to be successful despite the fact that he would lose</p>
<p>his temper, treat people horribly. That&rsquo;s not good. It&rsquo;s not good. And it would have been even</p>
<p>more successful if he wouldn&rsquo;t had those characteristics. Now you might say, well,</p>
<p>he, his anger is what pushed things. Well, let me ask you this. What leader wins the leader</p>
<p>whose team is afraid, who the team who execute, executes the mission because they&rsquo;re afraid of</p>
<p>their leader or executes the task because they&rsquo;re afraid of their leader or the team that loves</p>
<p>their leaders so much that they don&rsquo;t want to let them down. They don&rsquo;t want to let them down.</p>
<p>Or the team that loves their leaders so much that they don&rsquo;t want to let them down. Which team wins?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re implying a confidence that love is more powerful than fear, but I&rsquo;m not so sure. This is</p>
<p>the Machiavelli question. You&rsquo;re saying ultimately it&rsquo;s always better to lead by inspiration and love</p>
<p>than by, by putting the fear into the team. What I&rsquo;m, what I&rsquo;m saying is that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>countless times is me leading through my authority, leading through my rank,</p>
<p>leading through punitive measures is infinitely worse than me and you working together as a team</p>
<p>to win. On the second point of Steve Jobs is he has this idea of philosophy of eight players</p>
<p>where you have a group, like the power and the productivity of a group of what he called eight</p>
<p>players is invaluable. So you want to get a team of people who are the best at what they do.</p>
<p>But the most important aspect to him was that a single quote unquote B player on the team destroys</p>
<p>the entire productivity of the team. Is there something that it brings true to that? So he was,</p>
<p>I guess this could be a temper thing, but vicious about firing and removing the, uh, what he felt</p>
<p>was a toxic B player in a team. So eight players feed off of each other, unless there&rsquo;s one B</p>
<p>player present. It depends on the nature of the B player. Is the player, is the player a B player?</p>
<p>Is the player a B player because he&rsquo;s a little bit lazy? Is he a B player because he doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>good vision? Is he a B player because he&rsquo;s got a big ego and always thinks he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and now creates conflict in the team. So there&rsquo;s a bunch of different B players.</p>
<p>Look, if you&rsquo;re working for me and you&rsquo;re kind of a B player, but guess what? You&rsquo;re a grinder and</p>
<p>you get stuff done. I want you on the team. You might not be the smartest person I have,</p>
<p>but I know that you&rsquo;re committed to the team and I want you on the team. So you&rsquo;re a B player,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s okay. Now, if you&rsquo;re Lex with the giant ego, I&rsquo;d rather have, I&rsquo;d rather have Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite as smart. Cause I got other people that are smart. I got other people that</p>
<p>are smart on the team. Look, you&rsquo;re going to need some smart people on the team, but a team</p>
<p>is made up. It&rsquo;s a team. And so you take these different components of a team. And if you have</p>
<p>complimentary components, you&rsquo;ll end up with a superior team. Then just basing it on the level</p>
<p>of, and what&rsquo;s an A player sometimes in the seal teams, they would get something called the stacked</p>
<p>platoon. And what that would be is someone, you know, some senior person in that platoon would</p>
<p>manipulate and maneuver to get the quote best guys that he could in that platoon. So, you know,</p>
<p>the most experienced guys, the person that had great, great reputations. And sometimes those</p>
<p>platoons would be great. Sometimes they would implode because what you end up with is a bunch of</p>
<p>A players. And now no one wants to follow anyone else. No one wants to agree with anyone else.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to do it my way. Not it&rsquo;s my way, not Lex&rsquo;s way. Lex is stupid. No,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stupid. We end up with problems. So can one person derail a team? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Under good leadership, one person should not derail a team.</p>
<p>This could be a tech thing too. There&rsquo;s some multiplying effect of just pure excellence,</p>
<p>no matter the personalities. I think for Steve Jobs, he doesn&rsquo;t, the ego doesn&rsquo;t matter. None</p>
<p>of that matters. What matters is the quality of the output, the genius of the result.</p>
<p>And that somehow multiplies itself. And the egos actually, like one of the problems with egos</p>
<p>is like, what does ego usually say? It says, I&rsquo;m much better than you. When you have people that</p>
<p>are really good together, it&rsquo;s very hard for the ego to flourish because you&rsquo;re like constantly</p>
<p>being shown that you&rsquo;re not as good and there&rsquo;s a competition. So like, I think to his, his idea was</p>
<p>that like, if you get people that are really good at what they do, it turns out that you&rsquo;re not as</p>
<p>good at what you do. It turns as opposed to you being complacent and not doing much and thinking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better than everyone else and your opinion is better, is you almost getting in that competitive</p>
<p>race. You know that magic that happens when you&rsquo;re at the end of a marathon and you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>head to head, like you&rsquo;re just going full steam with a person that is as good as you. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>place for ego there. Which is great. Which is great. Let&rsquo;s use that example. You and I are racing,</p>
<p>the end of the marathon. We&rsquo;re both highly competitive, highly competitive. We have massive</p>
<p>egos and we both want to win. We both want to win so bad that we, we give everything we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally positive, right? Isn&rsquo;t that totally positive? Now imagine this same thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a race, we&rsquo;re in a marathon, we&rsquo;re in the last hundred meters. It&rsquo;s you against me</p>
<p>and, and our egos are huge and we&rsquo;re pushing to win and you start to pull ahead of me</p>
<p>and my ego is so big and I hate losing so much that I somehow accidentally</p>
<p>push my knee up against your foot on a backstride and throw you onto your face.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what ego, ego is an awesome driver unless you let your ego control you and you let</p>
<p>ego drive your decision making process, in which case it turns into an incredible problem. So</p>
<p>you might have someone that is excellent. You might have someone that&rsquo;s outstanding. You might</p>
<p>have some someone that&rsquo;s tens across the board, but their ego is so big that big that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work with other people. They can&rsquo;t accept anyone else&rsquo;s ideas. They can&rsquo;t compromise on something</p>
<p>because they think their idea is better all the time and that is going to be problematic</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want them on the team. Now as a good leader, guess what I&rsquo;ll do? I&rsquo;ll put them into a</p>
<p>situation where I can utilize their best aspects, but not have their ego destroy the team. So I</p>
<p>might say, Hey Lex, you know what? I actually want you to take lead on this part of the project over</p>
<p>here and since you&rsquo;re so smart and you work so hard, I know you&rsquo;re going to pull ahead of everyone</p>
<p>else. So you grind on that. Once you get that result, give it to me and I&rsquo;m going to disseminate</p>
<p>it to the team. So I, I, I isolate you from wrecking yourself and the rest of the team with</p>
<p>your giant ego. So then, uh, looking at a completely opposite person was this a fascinating</p>
<p>person to me is Sandra Pichai, who&rsquo;s the CEO of Alphabet CEO of Google. I admire the</p>
<p>the, uh, in a romantic sense, the madness that is, uh, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>So to me, the opposite of that is Sandra Pichai, who&rsquo;s, uh, like everybody loves him.</p>
<p>And, uh, he&rsquo;s also a great listener. So he always brings people together. And so he went,</p>
<p>the, the, the energy of that person in the room is like the basic energy. If I were to summarize it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I want to hear all the voices in the room. That&rsquo;s the energy he brings. And, uh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like he doesn&rsquo;t want to impose a final decision. He wants to hear all the voices</p>
<p>and somehow always the decision just falls out. I don&rsquo;t know what to say about that.</p>
<p>What to say about that style of leadership, but it&rsquo;s always surprising to me how</p>
<p>that love brought a lot of people together and still, I mean, some of the greatest things Google</p>
<p>has done over the past several years, uh, could be attributed to that continued innovation,</p>
<p>bringing out the best out of people. There&rsquo;s of course, bureaucracy, which I could criticize</p>
<p>at the end of the day, which always happens with big companies. I would argue actually</p>
<p>the dictatorial style of Steve jobs and, you know, Musk helped fight the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>which is one criticism I would give of being a listener and being kind is sometimes you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cut through the as effectively, but he. He&rsquo;s one of the only people I&rsquo;ve ever heard of</p>
<p>who everybody loves. He&rsquo;s inspirational figure to millions, especially in the, like in India,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a celebrity in the best kind of way. Is there something you could say about that kind</p>
<p>of leadership where you&rsquo;re never the asshole. You&rsquo;re never the dictator. You&rsquo;re always the</p>
<p>listener and, um, the compassionate empathetic glue that brings the team together basically</p>
<p>would love. Yeah. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s great leadership. If you have to choose for Google, uh,</p>
<p>for large companies, is there something to be said about what is more effective?</p>
<p>The dictator, uh, ruling by love or ruling by fear?</p>
<p>First of all, everything&rsquo;s a dichotomy, right? And so to think that all the time, you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>going to be able to just bark orders at people and they&rsquo;re always going to listen to you. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always going to get the best result. That would not be smart to think that every single</p>
<p>time you&rsquo;re going to come to a 100% consensus amongst the troops. And that decision is going</p>
<p>to reveal itself without you nudging it along. That would also be short sighted and naive. So</p>
<p>what you, what a good leader does is they, they, they stay balanced. And as much as they can,</p>
<p>they listen to what the troops have to say. They take that feedback. Maybe they quietly nudge things</p>
<p>and, and I&rsquo;m sure he does that. I&rsquo;m sure he does some nudging that maybe no one even picks up on.</p>
<p>You know, I like to say the best forms of leadership is leadership with minimum force required.</p>
<p>So if I can go into a room as a leader and not say one single thing and the team can come to</p>
<p>the right consensus and move in that direction, that&rsquo;s my preferred method. Maybe I have to give</p>
<p>them a little bit of a nudge, a 10% nudge in one direction. Okay. That&rsquo;s better than me walking in</p>
<p>there and giving them 100% dictatorial direction of exactly what I want to have happen. Now,</p>
<p>occasionally, if we have an emergency situation, people are starting to be frazzled and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not sure which direction to go. Then sometimes as a leader, you have to walk in and say, all right,</p>
<p>everyone here&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going. And people get on board. Why? Because for many years or months or</p>
<p>however long you&rsquo;ve trusted them to come up with a plan. And when you trust, when you, as a leader,</p>
<p>trust your team to come up with a plan, the team starts to trust you and you get leadership capital.</p>
<p>And as you build leadership capital, occasionally you need to cash in some of that leadership</p>
<p>capital. You need to spend some of it. And maybe it is, hey, listen, here&rsquo;s the direction we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going right now. We&rsquo;ll debrief it later, but we got to make a move. And the team who trusts you</p>
<p>says, Roger that boss, we got it. And all of them actually do this</p>
<p>interesting thing. I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinion on it. Sondra certainly does it to a large degree,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s in the process of delegation, trusting a person to do a really difficult thing,</p>
<p>like tossing it up and saying like, I trust you can get this job done</p>
<p>for some, even if your resume does not support that. I&rsquo;m actually kind of amazed that human</p>
<p>beings when they&rsquo;re given the trust to get the job done, they step up very often. That&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of an amazing property of human nature. People often ask me issues about leadership. And I always</p>
<p>say that one of the best tools for teaching leadership and for teaching a bunch of other</p>
<p>lessons is leadership itself. So when it happens all the time, when you elevate someone into a</p>
<p>leadership position, they do step up and they do make things happen. So that&rsquo;s not surprising to me.</p>
<p>You do have to mitigate risks. So saying, Hey, you know, Lex, I know you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been in the military before. I know you have very limited weapons experience,</p>
<p>but I want you to run a target assault on a real mission in whatever country that would not be</p>
<p>good. That would not be a good move on, on my part. Now, if I said, all right, Lex, you know what,</p>
<p>I want you to get some leadership experience. I&rsquo;ve got a training mission and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be using paintball and I&rsquo;m going to put you in charge of it. I got no problem doing that.</p>
<p>Some of that is judging human character is like, there&rsquo;s potential, there&rsquo;s something in this</p>
<p>person that they are, they have enough demons or whatever the hell it requires to have that fuel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll figure it out. They&rsquo;ll hate themselves if they don&rsquo;t. And they&rsquo;ll find the right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll find the tools that find the path to achieve the, whatever the level of perfection</p>
<p>they can. It&rsquo;s been really surprising to me. It&rsquo;s been making me rethink the whole hiring process</p>
<p>because I often now I&rsquo;m thinking and looking, so I&rsquo;m looking for people, both for the startup,</p>
<p>but just for my own life to help. And I almost want to see evidence of excellence,</p>
<p>but maybe you want to just based on just judgment of human character without evidence of excellence,</p>
<p>have people step up. Like Joe Rogan with Jamie, that&rsquo;s a funny side of it. I didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how little Joe knew about Jamie when he hired him. And Jamie stepped up and now runs one of</p>
<p>the most successful podcasts ever. And that&rsquo;s an incredible kind of, and he&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>producers in the world now, not to let it get to his head. And by the way, the funny thing about</p>
<p>him. And one of the best Googlers in the world. One of the best Googlers. The funny thing about</p>
<p>Jamie, this is okay. You might not like this, but what I, what I like, I&rsquo;m constantly exceptionally</p>
<p>self critical to a point of like self hating. Sometimes I deeply appreciate every single moment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alive, but everything I&rsquo;ve ever done, I feel like a shit. And when I talked to Jamie about</p>
<p>everything he&rsquo;s done, he&rsquo;s just in every way he carries himself. He&rsquo;s so self critical. He&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so like worried that it&rsquo;s wrong. It&rsquo;s bad. That anxious energy. I love it. Cause that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you lead to growth and progress. Like you might, like a therapist might say, that&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>good for your like wellbeing. Fuck it. It&rsquo;s good for the what&rsquo;s good for your wellbeing is to create</p>
<p>awesome things. That&rsquo;s ultimately what leads to happiness is to, to create the best thing you can</p>
<p>in your life. And so when I see that in somebody like Jamie or anybody I talked to, when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really self critical, that&rsquo;s a good sign to me. Is that ridiculous? It&rsquo;s not ridiculous at all.</p>
<p>And it goes back, you know, you were, you were the way you were phrasing these questions about what</p>
<p>makes a good person and what makes a good leader, the way you phrase them kind of eliminated the</p>
<p>normal answer that I give the normal answer that I give. You asked me what makes a good leader,</p>
<p>what makes a good person is, is being humble. So when you&rsquo;re going to hire someone for your,</p>
<p>for your startup or whatever company you&rsquo;re creating, that is a key characteristic to look for</p>
<p>is someone that has the humility like, like young Jamie to say, yeah, you know, I, I could have done</p>
<p>this better and here&rsquo;s what I can improve. And here&rsquo;s what I need to work on. When you have</p>
<p>somebody that thinks they know everything out of the gate, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re already got someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be hard to deal with. They&rsquo;re going to be hard to coach. They&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>hard to mentor. When you have somebody that&rsquo;s truly humble, you barely, again, it&rsquo;s minimum</p>
<p>force required because when you say to Jamie after a show, how do you think that went,</p>
<p>he says, well, you know, I did this wrong and I didn&rsquo;t have this set up in time. And</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t barely have to do anything because he&rsquo;s got the humility.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got someone that&rsquo;s a big ego and you say, Hey, how did that show go? He goes,</p>
<p>I went awesome on my end. Now guess what you have to do. Now you have to start applying</p>
<p>force as a leader, which is expending leadership capital, which we don&rsquo;t want to do because we</p>
<p>always try and conserve our leadership capital as much as we possibly can. And when we have to</p>
<p>expend it just to get Jamie to make some improvements, that&rsquo;s bad. So when you go</p>
<p>looking for people, look for people that are humble. Now, does this mean you look for people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have any confidence? No, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying. There&rsquo;s a balance to all these</p>
<p>things. That&rsquo;s the dichotomy of leadership you, but people tend towards and look, I work with</p>
<p>a lot of military troops in the past. Now I work with companies. The reason I talk about</p>
<p>humility all the time is because for someone to be, get into a leadership position in the military,</p>
<p>they have to have confidence. So the tendency is that their confidence is going to outweigh their</p>
<p>humility at some point. Same thing with, with civilian companies. If you get to a point of</p>
<p>leadership inside of a company, you have to have confidence to get there. You don&rsquo;t get to a</p>
<p>position of leadership inside of a company lacking confidence. So the tendency is for</p>
<p>confidence to, to grow a little bit too much. And we have to put that, put that confidence into check.</p>
<p>We have to put that ego into check. Really good leaders. They&rsquo;re confident, but they&rsquo;re humble.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the balance of the dichotomy. Hear that, Jamie, don&rsquo;t get cocky.</p>
<p>On occasion. Rarely you talk about discipline. What does a discipline life look like doing what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to do? What if I want to lay on the couch and eat Cheetos and watch soap operas?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not, that doesn&rsquo;t feel like discipline. Do you think you&rsquo;re supposed to do that?</p>
<p>Well, you know, you could argue from a, a sort of a meaning of life perspective that perhaps</p>
<p>happiness is the most important. And if it makes me happy, perhaps that&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s fulfilling,</p>
<p>of course, eating Cheetos and watching soap operas is fulfilling for nobody whatsoever.</p>
<p>Next question. But there&rsquo;s something about discipline that&rsquo;s more than that. We have to</p>
<p>like the rigor of habit, right? You, you wake up early in the morning, all the time.</p>
<p>What is it Jordan Peterson talks about? Make your bed. One place where you probably agree with</p>
<p>Jordan. People ask me if I make my bed. I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a disagreement with Jordan.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a disagreement with Jordan. There we go. You know, when I was younger, before I was married,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make my bed because I had one sleeping bag on it and I would get out of the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>There was nothing to make. Yeah. Now I&rsquo;m married and I can&rsquo;t make my bed because my wife&rsquo;s in my</p>
<p>bed. So I don&rsquo;t make my bed. Okay. So what in your life, maybe we can talk about the one that&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>publicly facing, which is you wake up at four o clock or around four o clock in the morning.</p>
<p>You post on social media a picture of your watch. It being early, just to remind people that</p>
<p>you are a man of your word. What&rsquo;s that about? What&rsquo;s the philosophy of the four o clock?</p>
<p>What role does that play in a disciplined life for you?</p>
<p>Okay. From that perspective, what role it plays is getting a jump on the day.</p>
<p>And when you wake up early and you get a jump on the day and you&rsquo;ve got your workout done,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a little bit of little bit of work done by the time normal people are getting up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a win. That&rsquo;s a psychological win. And it&rsquo;s not just a psychological win. It&rsquo;s an actual win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an actual win. So that feels great. It doesn&rsquo;t feel great. Maybe when your alarm clock goes off,</p>
<p>but by eight o clock in the morning and you&rsquo;ve already accomplished some of the major tasks</p>
<p>that you have, some of the most painful tasks that you have for the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re off to a great start and it&rsquo;s going to feel great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break this down then. What does then the rest of the day look like? What is the perfect,</p>
<p>productive, disciplined day in the life of Jaco Willink look like?</p>
<p>Wake up, workout.</p>
<p>Wake up when?</p>
<p>4, 4.30.</p>
<p>Workout when?</p>
<p>5, 5 to 6 or 7.</p>
<p>No eating?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And then what does the workout look like?</p>
<p>Depends on the day.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect? We&rsquo;re talking about body weight, lifting, cardio, heavy bag, jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. When I say workout, I mean no jiu jitsu. So jiu jitsu comes later in the day.</p>
<p>So this is just you alone?</p>
<p>This is me alone working out. Yep. And I&rsquo;m going to be doing a wide variety of things.</p>
<p>This is the thing that has the pictures of the aftermath with some sweat at the end. So the goal</p>
<p>is to do whatever the hell results in some sweat. And that takes an hour.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes 12 minutes. Sometimes it takes three hours, depending on what kind of mood I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>You got some demons to work through or is this just work? So you got the David Goggins who clearly</p>
<p>has demons screaming inside of his head that he&rsquo;s trying to work through. Are you just getting the</p>
<p>work done out of the discipline? Or is this, I think Joe is a little bit with David Goggins is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some ego, there&rsquo;s some bullshit that you&rsquo;re trying to get out through some of the exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to kind of humble you is just doing that exercise.</p>
<p>Well, exercise is certainly humbling.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s physical conditioning, right? It&rsquo;s preparing your body so that you can</p>
<p>handle whatever it is you&rsquo;re going to do. Perfect.</p>
<p>What does, what do you do after? Let&rsquo;s talk about food. Hopefully surf. If the waves are good,</p>
<p>surf for how good are the waves? Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re good. This is a perfect day. It&rsquo;s a perfect,</p>
<p>perfect waves. Why do you surf? It&rsquo;s fun. Okay. This is fun. Okay. Man, man and nature.</p>
<p>It was just like, what surfing is the ultimate is the power of the, the infinite power of the ocean</p>
<p>versus a little silly looking man on a board.</p>
<p>You could say it&rsquo;s the infinite power of the ocean versus a silly looking man on a board,</p>
<p>or you could say it&rsquo;s fun because it&rsquo;s Russian and romance. Okay. This is for fun</p>
<p>in the morning. Beautiful. And this is, you&rsquo;re still having eaten.</p>
<p>No. Okay. So when do you eat? I&rsquo;ll usually start grazing around 11 oclock</p>
<p>and grazing. What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the diet that&rsquo;s the, is there a perfect diet or do you graze?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have, I&rsquo;ll eat some nuts, you know, something like that. I usually start grazing. Maybe I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a little piece of meat or something like that. Does work enter any of this? I&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>have a lot of people that want your attention. Yeah. Yeah. No work is work is about to happen.</p>
<p>Cause you know, even if I, if I woke up at four, worked out from five to six surf from six to eight,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m starting to work writing, recording, reading, talking to clients.</p>
<p>Is there parts of the day where you try to find moments to think deeply, to read deeply,</p>
<p>to sort of really focus? Cause this world wants, it&rsquo;s full of distractions, right?</p>
<p>Right. Even talking to, uh, like even work stuff, the emails and all those kinds of things that can,</p>
<p>they can scatter your mind. Is there times you seek to have that focus?</p>
<p>Well, I read a lot of books. And so usually when I read, I&rsquo;ll be reading for a chunk of time,</p>
<p>maybe an hour at a time, maybe a little bit longer. And I might do that twice a day. So</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that counts as what you&rsquo;re describing, but then same thing with writing.</p>
<p>When I, when I&rsquo;m writing something, I mean, I just, that&rsquo;s what I do. I write usually usually</p>
<p>write for about an hour. I can get about a thousand words an hour out of me. So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of what I do. What does the rest of the day look like?</p>
<p>Just a lot of work, but one is the jujitsu. I want to find out about the jujitsu.</p>
<p>So round, round four, 30 or five oclock at night and train. Yep. And, uh, how hard you still, how,</p>
<p>how are you doing body wise? He still is the old man. Does the old man still got it or,</p>
<p>or are you talking to me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be good for viewership and ratings. If I die before the end of the podcast. So</p>
<p>so I, I, I still train with the same guys and I&rsquo;ll train, you know, so I&rsquo;ve been very lucky</p>
<p>when it comes to getting injured and stuff like that. So haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve had some injuries,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re healed. And so, yeah, I train and, uh, food wise, you mentioned grazing</p>
<p>us some, uh, of some nuts, a very light kind of things. Is there a main meal here at night at</p>
<p>night? Yep. High, uh, in protein or is it anything? Yeah. I&rsquo;ll have like a steak and salad. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>usually have for dessert. I have like a protein shake. So is there a thing where at the end of</p>
<p>the, uh, at the end of the day, you will like, you have like a summarize sword and you meditate on,</p>
<p>uh, uh, death and, um, all those kinds of, is, is there some weird ritual you partake in? No.</p>
<p>You just go to bed when I get done with the end of the day, I might read a little bit more.</p>
<p>Read more. Yeah. Because reading makes me tired usually. Um, so I&rsquo;ll read a little bit more.</p>
<p>Is there a key to you that you can speak to that makes for a productive day?</p>
<p>Just the way you approach it mentally. Yeah. Write down what you&rsquo;re supposed to do,</p>
<p>wake up early and start doing it and then get it done. Yeah. I know it&rsquo;s a miraculous trick.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about Jiu Jitsu? By all means.</p>
<p>What have you learned from being a practitioner? You&rsquo;re a black belt.</p>
<p>What have you learned from this journey, uh, of, um, being a martial artist?</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu for me was the connective tissue that started to join my mind together with</p>
<p>all the F different aspects of my life. And so Jiu Jitsu for me was, was really important.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I would be doing anything that I&rsquo;m doing right now if it wasn&rsquo;t for Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s various aspects of my life that were in existence, but I didn&rsquo;t understand how they</p>
<p>were connected until I started training Jiu Jitsu. The primary things are interacting with other</p>
<p>human beings and combat tactics and strategy and Jiu Jitsu. And all those things are connected.</p>
<p>They all follow the same guiding principles. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized those guiding principles</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t do Jiu Jitsu. Can you elaborate? Cause you&rsquo;ve trained for many, many years.</p>
<p>What, um, is it the hardship? Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over,</p>
<p>you know, nonstop, or I don&rsquo;t actually don&rsquo;t know how many times more times than you. Okay.</p>
<p>So good. Is it just the hardship of physical training, like the honesty of the mat in the</p>
<p>sense that like, you know, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work, which, which aspects were the most,</p>
<p>uh, impactful for you? All aspects. So yes, from a humility perspective, when you realize you think</p>
<p>when you think, you know what you&rsquo;re doing, when you think you have certain skills</p>
<p>and you realize that there&rsquo;s always somebody better than you. And you realize that, Hey,</p>
<p>maybe I don&rsquo;t have all the answers all the time. And you bring that to a leadership perspective</p>
<p>and you walk into your platoon and you realize that maybe you don&rsquo;t have all the answers all</p>
<p>the time. And maybe you should listen to what other people have to say. You bring that to a</p>
<p>combat situation and you realize that you think if you sit there and think that you&rsquo;re smarter than</p>
<p>the enemy, you&rsquo;re going to be complacent. You&rsquo;re going to make mistakes. So there&rsquo;s one aspect out</p>
<p>of the gate, as far as, you know, if I, if I&rsquo;m going to try and get your arm, do I attack your</p>
<p>arm? Maybe not directly, unless I&rsquo;m a white belt. Exactly. What do I do? I attack your neck. And</p>
<p>when you reach up to defend your neck, that&rsquo;s when I get your arm. Well, if I&rsquo;m out on the</p>
<p>battlefield and there&rsquo;s an enemy position, should I attack frontal assault into that position?</p>
<p>No, no, I shouldn&rsquo;t. I should put down some covering fire and I should maneuver around to</p>
<p>the flank. It&rsquo;s the same thing. If I&rsquo;m dealing with you and you&rsquo;re my boss and you&rsquo;ve got a giant ego</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve come up with a plan and I don&rsquo;t like your plan, should I walk up to you and say, hey,</p>
<p>Lex, your plan isn&rsquo;t good? No. Or should I say, Hey, Lex, can I ask you some questions about how</p>
<p>you want us to execute this? Cause I want to make sure I understand your vision.</p>
<p>So all these things are connected. Yes.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t have realized that we could sit here and do this forever. We could, we could,</p>
<p>I could tell you these comparisons forever, but this, all this connective tissue, bringing all</p>
<p>these things together, I wouldn&rsquo;t have seen it without, I don&rsquo;t think I would have seen it without</p>
<p>jujitsu. So jujitsu to me had, it had a incredible life impact on me. Not look the physical part. Yes,</p>
<p>absolutely. Does it, does it keep you humble when you know that there&rsquo;s 145 pound individual that</p>
<p>can tap you out when you&rsquo;re 220 pound, 25 year old guy. And there&rsquo;s 135 or 140 pound, you know,</p>
<p>46 year old guy that can make you tap out. That&rsquo;s humbling. And, and what do you do with that? Do</p>
<p>you run away from it or do you continue to pursue it? Same thing with life. Same thing with anything.</p>
<p>So jujitsu is an incredibly powerful, not just physical aspect, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a way to understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of thinking. You&rsquo;ve also competed. Is there something you can speak to the value of</p>
<p>competition? Obviously you&rsquo;ve been through combat, actual military combat is many, many, many, many</p>
<p>orders of magnitude, more high stakes than competition in a, in a silly sport like jujitsu.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still has some of the echoes of the same challenges. Is there something you can</p>
<p>speak to the value of competition for you? Yep. Competition will reveal weaknesses in your game</p>
<p>that you can then go back and train to rectify. So that, that&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s very useful to serve. Yeah. As a testing ground, of course, training can be that</p>
<p>testing ground as well or, or that feedback. Yeah. But as you and I both know, if you and</p>
<p>I train together all the time, you&rsquo;ll know my game. I&rsquo;ll know your game. And even if we have</p>
<p>five other people, we all kind of understand each other&rsquo;s games and you&rsquo;re not doing something to me</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t expect. So when I go and compete, I&rsquo;m good. You&rsquo;re good. You know, this random person</p>
<p>has a game that I&rsquo;ve never seen before. I&rsquo;m, and I may or may not know how to deal with that game.</p>
<p>If I know how to deal with it, great. I get the victory. Maybe I don&rsquo;t learn as much. If I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to deal with their game, I get the loss and I get the win of learning what some</p>
<p>weakness in my game is. So you mentioned offline that your friends and you work with Dean Lister</p>
<p>and Dean Lister is one of the people that inspired John Donoher, who I&rsquo;ve very much been,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to talk to quite a bit recently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think about this. This is not a therapy session, but</p>
<p>or maybe it is turning into one. He&rsquo;s a fascinating person, John Donoher, in terms of</p>
<p>creating almost a science of Jiu Jitsu to a level that I haven&rsquo;t seen before, which is</p>
<p>systems thinking about, like you can think about military combat as tactics in a particular</p>
<p>situation, but then you zoom out and you want to create entire systems of tactics in all situations,</p>
<p>right? He&rsquo;s very kind of wants to keep zooming out and creating giant systems.</p>
<p>And, which I appreciate that, even though the task is probably impossible to do completely,</p>
<p>but there is something that&rsquo;s in terms of competition that</p>
<p>he kindled a fire in me that I want to get back out there. He has a particular thing that did it,</p>
<p>which is very different from my personal journey in Jiu Jitsu, which was to a degree that people</p>
<p>I worked with cared about competition, it was always about winning or doing well,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things. For John, it&rsquo;s about winning, like winning is not even a thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important. What&rsquo;s most important is winning by submission or dominance, right? And not just the</p>
<p>end, it&rsquo;s the entire time competing such that the only thing that matters is that kind of victory.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very different level of competition that&rsquo;s actually liberating in a certain kind of</p>
<p>sense. I remember so much of my competition was about fear of not taking risks. You get up on</p>
<p>points or you hold a strong position, you kind of advance and you get more points. Maybe you chase</p>
<p>the submission, but there&rsquo;s always a fear of risk. And for him, you embrace the risk. You should not</p>
<p>be competing out of fear. Live and die by the sword versus stay in safety. I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to be said here. Well, you said it&rsquo;s novel to you, it&rsquo;s not novel to me. My entire</p>
<p>journey in Jiu Jitsu was only about submission. And as you mentioned, Dean Lister is my coach and my</p>
<p>main training partner for 20 something years. And if you ever watch Dean train or fight, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to do is submit as everyone. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s always done. That&rsquo;s what he always will</p>
<p>do. He, you know, he has the highest, I think he has impact. I know he has the highest submission</p>
<p>victories in ADCC. He, that&rsquo;s what he does. So this is, in fact, as Jiu Jitsu got bigger and</p>
<p>bigger, in fact, as Jiu Jitsu got more popular and we started seeing people competing to win by</p>
<p>points, that was what was novel to me in the beginning. Now it&rsquo;s the standard. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>novel to me. I love the fact that John Donoher and all of his troops go out and they try and</p>
<p>submit people. I think it&rsquo;s awesome. And I think that&rsquo;s what Jiu Jitsu is.</p>
<p>All right. Let&rsquo;s ask for some advice for white belts. There&rsquo;s a lot of white belts who listen to this.</p>
<p>What advice would you give? You&rsquo;ve been in Jiu Jitsu for many years. In terms of</p>
<p>a successful journey through Jiu Jitsu, what advice would you give them? People just starting out.</p>
<p>Just keep training, keep your ego in check. Don&rsquo;t freak out. Try and use the techniques</p>
<p>that you learn and all this stuff. So I&rsquo;m like saying it, you know, notice how I&rsquo;m saying it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, tap out, keep your ego in check.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common sense.</p>
<p>But the thing is everyone says this all the time and white belts still start off by going</p>
<p>completely nuts for at least, you know, three to six months of, I&rsquo;m not going to let this guy tap</p>
<p>me out. And they&rsquo;re going to, and I&rsquo;m going to tap this guy out, not by using technique,</p>
<p>but by just using strength. And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just inhibiting your learning. So as much as you</p>
<p>can, I know, I know you got to get it out of your system. I know you don&rsquo;t want to tap. And I know</p>
<p>you want to tap somebody, but as soon as you get, get that off your chest, then try and, try and</p>
<p>relax and try and learn the techniques. It&rsquo;s perhaps counterintuitive. It never was to me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s counterintuitive that to, to start on the journey of really sort of mastering Jiu Jitsu or</p>
<p>whatever, or improving is you have to relax. And that seems to be a very counterintuitive lesson.</p>
<p>I learned that early on with, that was thanks to the Russian system. I played piano and like music,</p>
<p>basically, actually this is true for basically any sport that includes the human body is like</p>
<p>relaxing is the way you, you start learning stuff. You have to learn, you have to literally,</p>
<p>and most people don&rsquo;t seem to understand this is like, you have to learn what it means for the</p>
<p>human body to relax. Like, I guess you have to have enough knowledge of all the muscles involved</p>
<p>to know what it means to relax those muscles. So for piano, you have to understand what it means</p>
<p>to relax your wrists and your fingers in order to learn how to move them. Like if there&rsquo;s tenseness</p>
<p>in the fingers, you&rsquo;re not going to like, you have to learn how to try hard while relaxed.</p>
<p>The, I guess the beginner, if you don&rsquo;t internalize this lesson, will try hard by</p>
<p>tensing up hard and like trying hard, tensing up more as opposed to relaxing more. And that lesson</p>
<p>cannot be conveyed through words, I guess. I&rsquo;ve had the great fortune of having dictatorial</p>
<p>teachers as they do in Russia for piano and so on, where you get like hit if you don&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>to relax, which is a counterintuitive notion, but it works.</p>
<p>Yeah. This brings me to one of my favorite pieces of coaching advice that I will tell</p>
<p>white belts while they&rsquo;re struggling on the mat. I&rsquo;ll tell them to relax harder.</p>
<p>Okay. That&rsquo;s beautiful. For somebody who studied war, who participated in war,</p>
<p>what do you think is the best martial arts for, let&rsquo;s call it self defense,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it self defense for hand to hand combat outside the constraints of sport.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not one answer. The answer to me is jujitsu, boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai,</p>
<p>judo, Sambo, and on down the list. I definitely start with jujitsu. The reason I start with</p>
<p>jujitsu is because in a self defense situation, if you are a big monster human and you want to</p>
<p>fight me and you square off with me, guess what I&rsquo;m going to do? Run away. Cause I don&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get involved. Even if I see skinny little Lex out on the street and you</p>
<p>start yelling at me and saying, you want to fight me? I don&rsquo;t want to fight you. I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t care if I can beat you or not. What if you stab me? What if you</p>
<p>sue me after I get done throwing you onto the concrete? There&rsquo;s a million bad things that can</p>
<p>happen and almost nothing good. So for self defense, my first self defense is my feet to</p>
<p>get away from you. And if you square off to punch me, I can run away from you. If you square off to</p>
<p>kick me, I can run away from you. If you push me, I can run away from you. So great. I don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to know how to box to run away from you where this all changes is when you grab me. And now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the option to run away anymore. Now I actually have to know how to get away from your</p>
<p>grip. And that&rsquo;s where jujitsu comes into play. So, especially if you get me on the ground,</p>
<p>if you, if you grab me and get me on the ground, now I need to know how to get you off of me and</p>
<p>get up and get away from you so I can run away. So that&rsquo;s why I say start with jujitsu. And, and</p>
<p>from there, boxing, wrestling, judo, Sambo, Muay Thai. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s certain in the</p>
<p>standing position. I mean, I&rsquo;m a judo person as well. And, uh, the judo is very limited in their</p>
<p>understanding of the full grappling spectrum, even though they do all the things on the ground as</p>
<p>well. But, uh, it&rsquo;s so focused on the feet, but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>the thing that judo has as a sport and it&rsquo;s good to practice that, uh, jujitsu doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is, um, not just the, the skill of grappling on the feet, but the skill of explosive aggression</p>
<p>that, uh, sometimes jujitsu is more about in terms of tactics is more about patience. It</p>
<p>depends how you practice it, but because so much is, uh, about control and, uh, technique</p>
<p>that, uh, sometimes you don&rsquo;t get to practice like aggression, explosive aggression. And judo</p>
<p>is so much about, uh, aggression implemented in such a way that the demonstration of power is</p>
<p>effortless, right? That&rsquo;s the beauty of jujitsu. Yeah. And same thing with wrestling. Wrestling</p>
<p>also has a high level of intensity and aggression as well. Yes. Yeah. So that&rsquo;s where, that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>I agree. Judo and wrestling. Absolutely. Awesome. Get some and striking boxing Muay Thai. Yeah. You</p>
<p>know, like the, you should train all these things. Are there books and movies in your life long ago</p>
<p>or recently that had a big impact on you? Uh, yeah, the main one is about face, which is sitting</p>
<p>right here. There you go. This is written by Colonel David Hackworth. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>book that really had a massive impact on me from a leadership perspective. And I ended up,</p>
<p>I talked about it enough that it started kind of coming back and started selling well and</p>
<p>they contacted me and I wrote a forward for it. So that book had a huge impact on me and I still,</p>
<p>when I read it, I still get lessons out of it just about every time. This is the Vietnam war.</p>
<p>And Korea. And Korea. And he got in towards the end of, right at the end of world war II. So he</p>
<p>was kind of raised by the, the soldiers that fought in world war II and then he went to Korea</p>
<p>and then he went to Vietnam. An exceptional warrior, a soldier soldier. If you can give</p>
<p>a little inkling what made him a soldier soldier. So I, he died in 2005 so I never got to meet him.</p>
<p>And I, I had a guy on my podcast who worked for him in Vietnam, a guy named general James</p>
<p>Mukiyama. And luckily his son had reached out to me and said, I think you&rsquo;re talking about my dad</p>
<p>cause I read some passage in there that, that Jim Mukiyama was young cap young captain Jim Mukiyama,</p>
<p>company commander in Vietnam. He said, I think you&rsquo;re talking about my dad. Would you want to</p>
<p>talk to him? And I said, absolutely. Well, here&rsquo;s the thing that I didn&rsquo;t really understand. And</p>
<p>you read one quote, but there&rsquo;s all these quotes in that book that talk about how great Hackworth</p>
<p>was and what an incredible leader he was and how he was the best combat leader anyone had ever seen.</p>
<p>And all these just really complimentary things that are said by a bunch of different people.</p>
<p>And when you read the book, you&rsquo;re reading this guy&rsquo;s account of what he went through.</p>
<p>But I never really knew if that was all true or did he just cherry pick his friends,</p>
<p>quotes about him and cherry pick the stories that he wanted to tell.</p>
<p>And so it was very interesting for me when I met Mukiyama, General Mukiyama, who he became a general</p>
<p>eventually when I met him and we were talking about his life. And I was very curious and I was</p>
<p>a little bit nervous going into this interview because I was thinking maybe my hero, my mentor,</p>
<p>this guy that I&rsquo;ve never met before, maybe he&rsquo;s just an arrogant jerk that talked, talked himself</p>
<p>up in this book. So I&rsquo;m sitting down with, with General Mukiyama and I finally got to the part</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s meeting Hackworth for the first time. And I said, did, you know, did you know who</p>
<p>Hackworth was when he showed up? So he was Mukiyama, Muk, Muk, they call him Muk. Muk was the,</p>
<p>was the, like the adjutant to the, to the general that, that was going to, that, that Hackworth</p>
<p>was going to be working for. So when Hackworth comes into the office, the first person he meets</p>
<p>is this guy, this guy, Captain Mukiyama. And so Hackworth walks in and I said, when Hackworth</p>
<p>walked in, did you know who he was? And Mukiyama says, everybody knew who he was, Mr. Infantry.</p>
<p>And so he ended up explaining that everything that is written in there about Hackworth,</p>
<p>they, they just loved him. They adored him. Up the chain of command,</p>
<p>it turned out a little bit different. And, you know, the title of the book is about face. And</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar, familiar with military drill about faces, when you turn around 180 degrees,</p>
<p>and at the end of the Vietnam war, towards the end of the Vietnam war, he was so disgusted with</p>
<p>the way that the war was being fought. He was so disgusted with the decisions that were being made</p>
<p>by the leadership that he did an interview. He was the first Colonel, first senior officer to</p>
<p>do an interview that spoke out against the war that was happening. And this is while he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>Vietnam, by the way. So he got drummed out of the army, and he was forced to retire. And that was</p>
<p>that. So there&rsquo;s an element of rebelliousness to him. And, you know, when you talk to me about,</p>
<p>are there times when the leaders making the leadership, this absolute senior leadership,</p>
<p>the civilian leadership is doing the wrong things? Yes. And there&rsquo;s times when people speak out</p>
<p>against it. And there&rsquo;s an argument for and against that, too, even even with Hackworth.</p>
<p>You know, did he when you get when you quit your job, or you do something that gets you fired,</p>
<p>which is what he did, you immediately give up all your influence over what&rsquo;s happening. So they get</p>
<p>another, they get another battalion commander to take his place, they get another colonel to step</p>
<p>in and take his place. That&rsquo;s what they do. And now he can&rsquo;t help anymore. And he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and now he can&rsquo;t help anymore. He can&rsquo;t help his troops. But at that point in the war,</p>
<p>he loved his men so much that he was sickened with the situation on the ground. And he,</p>
<p>and he spoke out about it. So that book had a huge impact on me. And like I said, I still,</p>
<p>I still read it all the time. I reread it all the time. And I always take lessons from it.</p>
<p>But let me ask you about love. This is not usually associated with Jaco. But what role does love</p>
<p>in terms of friendship, in terms of family play in a successful life? And life in general?</p>
<p>Again, this is putting other people above yourself.</p>
<p>Do you see that as love? That&rsquo;s ultimately the implementation of love?</p>
<p>I would say yes.</p>
<p>Jaco, I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of yours. You&rsquo;re somebody who inspires me to get up early,</p>
<p>to get shit done, to be disciplined about my life, and to be the best leader I can be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, truly an honor. And thank you for wasting all your too valuable time with me. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what you were thinking, but thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for having me on. I can guarantee I&rsquo;m not as cool as you just made me sound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just out here, like I said, trying to help people out. And I think you&rsquo;re helping a lot of</p>
<p>people out with your podcast. So thanks for having me up here to share some of my experiences.</p>
<p>And hopefully I&rsquo;ll see you on the mat one day.</p>
<p>For sure. Looking forward to it. Could be sooner than you think.</p>
<p>Sounds like a threat. I love it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jaco Willink. And thank you to Linode, Indeed,</p>
<p>SimpliSafe, and Ground News. Check them out in the description to support this podcast. And now,</p>
<p>let me leave you with some words from Jaco Willink.</p>
<p>There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.</p>
<p>There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
