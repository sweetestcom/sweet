    <p>Do you still have those bat wings?</p>
<p>Bat wings?</p>
<p>I thought you told me, like, your vagina, you had those, like, so you still have the</p>
<p>meat flaps.</p>
<p>Okay, do the clapping.</p>
<p>Do the clapping before this takes a sinister turn.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>That sucked.</p>
<p>You always say it sucks.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Why do you have to count before you do it?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s mixing it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just-</p>
<p>Just move you to Hollywood.</p>
<p>You think we&rsquo;re talented, yeah.</p>
<p>Just move you to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Wait, you guys, you look like you&rsquo;re going to a funeral, both of you.</p>
<p>We are going to a funeral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the death of our podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only a few episodes in and we&rsquo;re already mourning and grieving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imminent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s planning a funeral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imminent destruction.</p>
<p>So thank you for pointing that out.</p>
<p>Pumps, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with people that put other people on dating sites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>We would like to welcome you to I&rsquo;ve Had It, a podcast about positivity and petty grievances</p>
<p>and sharing light episode after episode of unmitigated rage over petty bullshit.</p>
<p>The pettier the crime, the more irate we are.</p>
<p>The more what?</p>
<p>Irate.</p>
<p>I thought you said I write.</p>
<p>Irate.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is why we are wearing all black today.</p>
<p>So I have something that I know is going to get you wound up like a cheap clock.</p>
<p>Oh God, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Men who skirt the system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about it for years.</p>
<p>You introduced me to the concept about 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>About it is so unfair that men get to skirt the system.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you define what skirting is because I found it quite humorous.</p>
<p>OK, so I&rsquo;ll tell the audience what I think it is.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;ve all watched those nature shows with that British guy with that great</p>
<p>voice.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Richard Attenborough.</p>
<p>Richard Attenborough.</p>
<p>You know the guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you know, they&rsquo;re mating and they&rsquo;re breeding and she&rsquo;s looking for the</p>
<p>alpha male gorilla.</p>
<p>Females are competing over who is going to have the best sperm for her offspring.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at physical, you know, components.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to help them perpetuate their line, right?</p>
<p>So when it comes to our species, I&rsquo;ve noticed there is a flaw in the system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a prime example.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, Melania Trump.</p>
<p>Prime example.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But if he didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, it would have never happened.</p>
<p>Hence the skirting.</p>
<p>Hence the topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you guys.</p>
<p>She is, I mean, steel traps on both sides of the brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a future in podcasting.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>This is going to be our last episode.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s just a prime example.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another prime example.</p>
<p>Men that are 70 that are dating a 25, 30 year old and because of Viagra they are able to</p>
<p>impregnate and have a whole new round of kids and a whole new family.</p>
<p>You know what I think about when I see that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, she has to see him naked.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like his old wrinkly ass.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Naked.</p>
<p>Naked.</p>
<p>I mean, that is just like, makes me throw up in my mouth.</p>
<p>And they are completely skirting the system because nowhere in nature would a woman choose</p>
<p>a geriatric person to be the father of her offspring.</p>
<p>The only reason our species does it because the one thing that trumps the physicality</p>
<p>for a woman of this type, this type of woman, is a big bank account.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So these men are skirting the system for two things.</p>
<p>Number one, they have a lot of money in the bank.</p>
<p>And number two, Viagra.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Viagra is the worst.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, for these women, it would be a million times better.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Because you know they are having to earn every penny.</p>
<p>And you know that even though there is Viagra involved, if it&rsquo;s a 70-year-old dick, you</p>
<p>know it doesn&rsquo;t end quickly.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I bet it&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
<p>I bet it goes on for hours, forever.</p>
<p>You know that commercial that said if the erection lasts for four hours?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That motherfucker would be dead before four hours ever came.</p>
<p>I mean, there is no fucking way.</p>
<p>So a 70, 80-year-old for four hours.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The ugliest gorilla getting the hottest female gorilla.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It does not happen.</p>
<p>But a lot of women, sadly, that are not focused on having their own career and men, you know,</p>
<p>exploit this, they&rsquo;re skirting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Skirting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re skirting the system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely, this is not the natural flow of it.</p>
<p>So as you and I have talked about men that skirt the system for the longest time, I have</p>
<p>always thought about these mail-order brides.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I had an over-explainer that had a mail-order bride.</p>
<p>It was oil money and lots of it.</p>
<p>So he was rich.</p>
<p>He was rich.</p>
<p>And he weighed 600 pounds if he weighed an ounce.</p>
<p>Like morbidly obese.</p>
<p>Morbidly.</p>
<p>Like take out the wall and get a crane fat.</p>
<p>Morbidly obese, richer than shit.</p>
<p>Richer than shit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Kind of a bugger, whatever.</p>
<p>Maybe he didn&rsquo;t say a lot, but everything he said just gave me like chills.</p>
<p>Just like creepy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Estimate of his age?</p>
<p>He would have been in his 50s probably.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And never had kids, never been married, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And then he gets this bride from South America, I think.</p>
<p>Did you ever see her?</p>
<p>She was attractive.</p>
<p>Younger, much younger.</p>
<p>And a lot more attractive.</p>
<p>Really attractive, yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s skirting.</p>
<p>No doubt about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then he gets her pregnant.</p>
<p>And I think they have one or two kids.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not kidding you.</p>
<p>I had to ask like how does that happen?</p>
<p>Like if a dick&rsquo;s this big and your belly&rsquo;s this big, like how does that happen like physically?</p>
<p>You do it on an incline.</p>
<p>So like- What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like the fat rolls like you, you know, an incline.</p>
<p>Like you incline down so the fat rolls down and then she can get on top.</p>
<p>So he has to lie back- And incline backwards, go backwards.</p>
<p>The man is so fat that there&rsquo;s no way, it&rsquo;s just not possible that his penis could reach</p>
<p>the vagina.</p>
<p>Because the fat overflows to the penis.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was like a double gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not accessible.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not accessible.</p>
<p>I have a really important question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How did you find out this information?</p>
<p>Well, I just asked.</p>
<p>He kind of volunteered it.</p>
<p>Like you do it on an incline.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, well that, I mean, that kind of enlightens- So he says you do it on</p>
<p>an incline.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incline.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t get- Several more questions.</p>
<p>Further details on that, but I figured it out like the fat rolls up.</p>
<p>You crack the case.</p>
<p>I crack the case.</p>
<p>So they have the two kids and then there&rsquo;s a divorce.</p>
<p>No, he dies, luckily for her.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He ended up dying.</p>
<p>So she got all the money.</p>
<p>How did you know she was a mail order?</p>
<p>Well, because she was from a foreign country and it like, he went over there, he came back</p>
<p>with the wife.</p>
<p>We just assumed it was a mail order.</p>
<p>Like I never said, did you mail order this?</p>
<p>So again, you crack the case.</p>
<p>I crack the case.</p>
<p>Like you go to a foreign country, you come back with this young, beautiful wife.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fat as a pig and you have money.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that big of a leap that it was a mail order thing.</p>
<p>You are, I mean- Crackerjack.</p>
<p>The prowess of your deduction skills is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that was before the internet.</p>
<p>Just snail mail.</p>
<p>I figured it out just from U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>You backed it.</p>
<p>You figured out about the incline.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which I thought was a direct question, which I&rsquo;m really kind of proud of you for that.</p>
<p>Well, I skirted around it enough that he volunteered it.</p>
<p>And then I just vividly remember the incline in my mind in that moment.</p>
<p>Like, oh God, that would be awful.</p>
<p>And I think by all accounts, she was lovely.</p>
<p>You and I watched this documentary yesterday about mail order brides.</p>
<p>And a lot of the men that were featured in the documentary didn&rsquo;t appear to be rich.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if like, I mean, obviously, and we&rsquo;re going to have our guest on shortly</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll ask him about this, if, you know, middle class American for some of these women</p>
<p>that they get is for them, you know, would be considered really wealthy.</p>
<p>And I would assume so.</p>
<p>I would assume that would have to be the case.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Would you ever consider mail order husbands?</p>
<p>Um, let me think about that.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would you like to get on the mail order husband website and browse around?</p>
<p>I probably would.</p>
<p>I mean, I like, my friends that have Bumble and stuff, I&rsquo;ll look at that, just kind of</p>
<p>out of interest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I do.</p>
<p>It is interesting that mail order, I mean, I remember in the 80s, by snail mail, hearing</p>
<p>about mail order brides.</p>
<p>And then now with the internet, it makes it so easy.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that these men are skirting the system like they are.</p>
<p>And like your guy that&rsquo;s morbidly obese, I, when I have to get naked or, you know,</p>
<p>think about being sexual, I want to feel and look good.</p>
<p>But for these men, they don&rsquo;t, they just take the clothes off and plop down on an incline</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s just no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no self-consciousness.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If I got on a website and there&rsquo;s like a Brad Pitt lookalike, I&rsquo;m not going to immediately</p>
<p>see him.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s going to like me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 20 years younger and he&rsquo;s got a rock hard body and he&rsquo;s great looking.</p>
<p>So obviously I&rsquo;m the candidate for him.</p>
<p>You know, there has to be some self-awareness about what you&rsquo;re bringing to the table.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he probably, in his mind, thought he was rescuing her from something bad in</p>
<p>her home country.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that, but I would assume he felt like that.</p>
<p>But I also think you get into the, if you&rsquo;re mail order briding it, there&rsquo;s an ownership</p>
<p>thing that creeps me out on that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a possession.</p>
<p>It goes from a person to a possession or that they owe you because you brought them to the</p>
<p>United States.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what kind of creeps me out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, these women are so vulnerable, obviously, to be on a mail order website.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about really, really vulnerable, marginalized women.</p>
<p>And these men live in a country that has 340 million people in it, which would be the United</p>
<p>States of America.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No shortage of human beings here.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re going and retrieving these women and bringing them back.</p>
<p>And just from the onset, my gut tells me these men probably are pretty fucked up.</p>
<p>No psychiatry degree needed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking, you know, these men are probably sitting around looking at porn their</p>
<p>whole fucking lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not dating in their own country.</p>
<p>So by the time they get these women, can you imagine what these women have to go through?</p>
<p>Is there a human trafficking kind of component to it, even though they&rsquo;re both adults?</p>
<p>You and I watched this documentary in preparation for this episode.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this is a documentary by Jonathan Narducci.</p>
<p>And the title of his documentary is called Love Me.</p>
<p>And why are you laughing at me?</p>
<p>No, just the title of the documentary about mail-order brides is Love Me.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jonathan Narducci is a commercial music video and documentary director and cinematographer.</p>
<p>He is the director of the documentary, which we watched yesterday, called Love Me, about</p>
<p>men searching for mail-order brides overseas.</p>
<p>I have so many questions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to ask.</p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s bring on Jonathan Narducci.</p>
<p>Oh, there we go.</p>
<p>Hi, Jonathan.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi, Jonathan.</p>
<p>Can you guys hear me and everything okay?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer and this is Angie.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So first of all, I want to say that we watched your documentary and I loved it.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really interesting because for years, I call Angie her nickname is Pumps.</p>
<p>So for years, we have always talked about men that skirt the system.</p>
<p>That if you think about other species out in the wild, you&rsquo;re never going to have the</p>
<p>hottest gorilla going after the geriatric gorilla to breed.</p>
<p>But in our species, men, by virtue of bank accounts or Viagra, are able to kind of skirt</p>
<p>nature&rsquo;s desire for us to pick the best mate for ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, a bank account is a good indication of somebody&rsquo;s ability to provide, right?</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the documentary.</p>
<p>If you will just summarize a few minutes what your documentary is about and the men that</p>
<p>you followed, and then we&rsquo;ll dive in with questions so our audience kind of knows what</p>
<p>the plot of your documentary is.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>About 10 years ago, I pursued a documentary following men from the United States who went</p>
<p>to Ukraine on what&rsquo;s called a love tour.</p>
<p>And these love tours are basically, you know, like a, I don&rsquo;t know, like a vacation for</p>
<p>single men to meet women that are also single in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of like a modern mail-order bride.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d follow these men on their quest to meet women for the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
<p>For the most part, not a lot of people connected or met women.</p>
<p>And they have these things, which I think you&rsquo;re referring to, they&rsquo;re called, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like social events where there&rsquo;s basically, you know, like 10 to 20 women for every man</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like this weird, it&rsquo;s definitely skirting a normal system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like shooting fish in a barrel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Especially with the people participating.</p>
<p>So the results were pretty interesting.</p>
<p>From our perspective, in my perspective, it was very, very surreal and kind of funny,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>It also could be viewed as kind of sad too.</p>
<p>I mean, we were locked in.</p>
<p>It is so good for those of you that haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great watch.</p>
<p>What Jonathan is talking about is these men go over and they go to these parties and the</p>
<p>ratio is way in the man&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>So we have right out of the gates a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>So the women that arrive to the party, what are they told and are they paid to go to the</p>
<p>party?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re paid to go.</p>
<p>So you have to understand, in Ukraine, I would say the biggest tourism is this kind of international</p>
<p>male tour.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re walking in the center of Kyiv or any of these other cities that you go to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see advertisements for marriage agencies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a massive industry that&rsquo;s been set up and kind of facilitated in that country.</p>
<p>Now, the reality is, is that it&rsquo;s a tourism thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tourist trap in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really part of the reality of what is actually happening from the female perspective.</p>
<p>The company I worked with was based in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a Foreign Affair and they basically have affiliates is what they call them.</p>
<p>So they hire local to each city companies that provide profiles of women, whether those</p>
<p>profiles are accurate, real, or anything in between is up for debate.</p>
<p>But basically, they provide some kind of service to write the men and correspond.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where most of the money is exchanged.</p>
<p>So that was interesting, because I think his name was Bobby.</p>
<p>Bobby, I thought the big reveal when he is messaging with this woman who he thinks is</p>
<p>an Angelina Jolie lookalike.</p>
<p>And to our listener, this man describes himself, he says, let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m a little on the</p>
<p>heavier side.</p>
<p>And the woman that he&rsquo;s kind of pen palling with email wise is, I mean, she&rsquo;s very attractive.</p>
<p>Stunning.</p>
<p>Great body.</p>
<p>And the photos of these women, I mean, they&rsquo;ve got, I mean, banging bodies, no doubt about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Very attractive.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really attractive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But women are hyper sexualized for sure.</p>
<p>So Bobby is totally, he&rsquo;s been emailing with this woman, and he goes to Ukraine and he</p>
<p>thinks that she&rsquo;s going to show up and she kind of stands him up one night and he&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of incredulous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve been emailing.</p>
<p>And then you reveal to the viewer that he&rsquo;s being charged for each email and has racked</p>
<p>up a bill, a bill of something like $9,000.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s living in some kind of fantasy.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think to anyone that lives in a modern world, even though this is 10 years</p>
<p>ago, there&rsquo;s still a Skype.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He could easily, if he actually had a connection with a human being, they would have wanted</p>
<p>to see each other.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re, you know, for instance, if I&rsquo;m, you know, online dating, the first</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ll do is have a FaceTime with somebody, you know, it&rsquo;s so, you know, in reality, it</p>
<p>was a form of entertainment, a form of fantasy, some kind of world that he was able to live</p>
<p>in where he was communicating with this image, this object.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a lot of what&rsquo;s going on, I think, is that there&rsquo;s a lot of objectification</p>
<p>and kind of taking the humanity out of the women that are there, just hyper-sexualized</p>
<p>beautiful women that want to marry these men.</p>
<p>We pretty early on could tell that there was something not right about this process.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re basically mining these photos of these women, creating profiles, and, you know,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s writing to them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Probably a bunch of men writing to like 10 dudes at a time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>
<p>When Bobbi was like, she was writing to me and I&rsquo;m like, she&rsquo;s probably not writing to</p>
<p>you, Bobbi.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I was kind of saying.</p>
<p>Or she&rsquo;s making money, so she&rsquo;s writing to you.</p>
<p>What was the guy&rsquo;s name from Wisconsin?</p>
<p>I think he was from the guy from Wisconsin and he makes a connection with this woman.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then he goes back to the United States and he gets his engagement ring and then he</p>
<p>goes back to the Ukraine and he&rsquo;s like, something&rsquo;s off here.</p>
<p>And then he says a loan shark and a cop showed up at the door and said that she owed the</p>
<p>loan shark $4,000.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t have $4,000.</p>
<p>And I said, well, we&rsquo;re going to take her to jail.</p>
<p>How much do you have?</p>
<p>And he said, a couple hundred.</p>
<p>I have $200.</p>
<p>So he gave him the $200.</p>
<p>And then you flash to this guy back in Wisconsin and he&rsquo;s still trying to crack the case and</p>
<p>it kind of quite hasn&rsquo;t come together for him that it was a racket.</p>
<p>The loan shark, the cop, and his potential fiance were all in cahoots.</p>
<p>I was so incredulous that he couldn&rsquo;t piece all of that together because I pieced it together</p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting hustled.</p>
<p>This is a classic hustle.</p>
<p>You just got hustled.</p>
<p>But do you think it is like they talk about love and so do you think these men are, which</p>
<p>is this is the sad part of your documentary where it tugs on a bunch of different emotions</p>
<p>that you feel for the characters that you have in there.</p>
<p>Do you think that they like, of course, sex is a huge driving component for any man, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just face it.</p>
<p>But do you think that they are looking for a long term connection?</p>
<p>I mean, they might be.</p>
<p>Either way, they all feel some entitlement, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think that he did genuinely want a partner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the case with all of the men that I followed or all of the certainly</p>
<p>not all the men on the tour.</p>
<p>The majority of them, you know, when when I was going on my first tour, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s 10 guys.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s usually 20 or 30.</p>
<p>Like I would say on day one on their way over, there&rsquo;s probably about eight out of 10 guys</p>
<p>who are thinking they&rsquo;re going to go home with a engagement and a woman that they that</p>
<p>they will love them for being who they are and what they are.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the rest of the guys of that 10 are probably on a sex tour.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Under the guise of a marriage tour, you know, going straight to the hotel for prostitution,</p>
<p>which is, by the way, everywhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like Ukraine is obviously a sex tourist place as well.</p>
<p>So marriage tourism, sex tourism, all of that, all the tourists that are using using women</p>
<p>for their bodies.</p>
<p>And so about after that first night and then going out, that paradigm shifts and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe two guys out of the 10 on the first night leftover that are still interested in</p>
<p>meeting a woman.</p>
<p>And I think Travis was one of those guys.</p>
<p>And that, you know, it took a long time to find those men that were actually genuinely</p>
<p>interested in and didn&rsquo;t get like kind of allured by the sex that&rsquo;s so easy to have.</p>
<p>So these women are are they having sex with these men after the socials or whatever?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s probably some sex that happens at the socials.</p>
<p>I think that mostly what happens is it&rsquo;s like and talking about how women make money is</p>
<p>probably through like little kind of hustles, I would say, for the most part there.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re talking about a country where there are, you know, women obviously don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make as much as men.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a great economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that are great about Ukraine, but there&rsquo;s a lot of things as far</p>
<p>as like socioeconomic things, especially for women that make it really hard.</p>
<p>And so if they just get a really nice dinner at a really high end restaurant with champagne,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little hustle.</p>
<p>If they go out and they buy them a computer or a bottle of perfume or a dress or whatever</p>
<p>it is, that&rsquo;s a little hustle.</p>
<p>The men in your documentary didn&rsquo;t appear by their homes because you filmed them in</p>
<p>the United States, too.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t look to be rich nor attractive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there is, you know, there&rsquo;s one, you know, we tried to like show a variety</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>For example, Bobby, he, you know, he&rsquo;s probably fairly well off.</p>
<p>I thought it was fascinating when like the guy that&rsquo;s like the romance night liaison,</p>
<p>he goes, these men that come over here, they&rsquo;re looking for women, and these women are family</p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t career women, that that was like, that was a selling point, you know, that being</p>
<p>a career woman was such a bad thing.</p>
<p>For our audience that&rsquo;s listening, one of the guys finds love, brings his quote unquote</p>
<p>mail order bride back to Texas, and they get married.</p>
<p>Do you think they were in love?</p>
<p>To me, it seemed pretty obvious that it was like a relationship based on, you know, two</p>
<p>people wanting to be married, probably to some degree, ambition from both their parts.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Ambition from Eric, the man, to have a woman that maybe has traditional values and is beautiful.</p>
<p>No, she was definitely, he outkicked his coverage for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, and ambition for Ina, who&rsquo;s, I gotta say, it seemed to me pretty intelligent.</p>
<p>By the time I had gone back to San Antonio, where they lived, within three months, she</p>
<p>was speaking English.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s definitely like, you know, an ambitious, really intelligent woman.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, I can safely say they&rsquo;re not married anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, plot twist.</p>
<p>Four of the couples I followed ended up getting married and none of them are married anymore.</p>
<p>As a woman, and when I watched it, I think about these men that you followed, and I think</p>
<p>that they probably have, you know, social problems, you know, socializing with people.</p>
<p>And I imagine that they probably lived a lifetime of watching a lot of porn.</p>
<p>And then they get the hot, you know, tight ass, everything&rsquo;s completely banging girl.</p>
<p>And as a woman, I imagine what that woman has to go through with someone that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>as attractive as she, and it pains me.</p>
<p>As a woman, I see that she&rsquo;s like, look, I&rsquo;m going to get out of here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to, I&rsquo;m going to have to sleep with him, but I&rsquo;m gonna go to America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get an education.</p>
<p>And this was my journey.</p>
<p>And this is what I&rsquo;m going to have to do.</p>
<p>I can respect it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and who knows if that&rsquo;s like what the intention was, or if it was premeditated</p>
<p>that way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It might have been something very different.</p>
<p>It might have been like, wow, I get to go to America.</p>
<p>Like, I think you have to realize like the women there are hyper sexually, like objects</p>
<p>and the men really don&rsquo;t try to do anything.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re skirting the system, Jonathan, these men are skirting, they&rsquo;re a culture.</p>
<p>So to you and to me, yeah, so to you and me, it might be skirting a system or institutionalized</p>
<p>skirting.</p>
<p>Social and institutional and, you know, things of all kinds of nature.</p>
<p>And, you know, who knows?</p>
<p>Things change.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think probably you don&rsquo;t have a kid with somebody if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to, you know, unless you live in Oklahoma where we live and they just did a total abortion</p>
<p>ban.</p>
<p>So people have to have kids all the time here.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And so I think that she probably did put her best foot forward and, you know, ultimately,</p>
<p>she became more aware of what&rsquo;s in America and maybe her value and her intelligence and</p>
<p>her beauty.</p>
<p>And those things might have not been aligned with what she was seeing on the other side.</p>
<p>And I could also say that she might have figured out that he might have been skirting the system</p>
<p>after being Americanized for a bit.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>You know, she might have been like, I&rsquo;m pretty hot.</p>
<p>Tall blonde.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gorgeous.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re kind of answering the, you know, or rebooting what you&rsquo;re saying by skirting</p>
<p>the system.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s skirting the system?</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the women who come over and end up becoming successful and ultimately raising</p>
<p>their own lifestyle are the ones skirting the system.</p>
<p>The men end up thinking that they&rsquo;re going to get a woman and it&rsquo;s the reverse reverse</p>
<p>skirt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reverse skirt.</p>
<p>So ultimately, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, these, you know, you can look at it either</p>
<p>way, but it&rsquo;s, you know, I, I think without a doubt, the whole thing is kind of like marketing</p>
<p>and, you know, this fictional belief that somehow because you&rsquo;re from a certain place</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re entitled or allowed or can have a genuine relationship with somebody who will</p>
<p>like love you because of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not the reality.</p>
<p>Jen and Nellie told me that you&rsquo;re doing, working on a new one, The Ghosts of the Republic.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m at, we&rsquo;ll watch that one and then we&rsquo;ll probably have you back on because you have</p>
<p>just like-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about surrogacy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about skirting the system.</p>
<p>Totally skirting.</p>
<p>A whole new skirt.</p>
<p>Jonathan, thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big, big fan of your work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to watch Ghosts of the Republic soon, but thank you so much.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Bye, Jonathan.</p>
<p>Bye, Jonathan.</p>
<p>Bye, bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;re not finished with the podcast.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Just because he leaves, we still have an audience that&rsquo;s listening to us.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going to leave you with a quote.</p>
<p>I have a quote.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because we are so-</p>
<p>Is it your quote or are you quoting someone else?</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m quoting someone else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why-</p>
<p>I mean, you have-</p>
<p>That was a stupid question.</p>
<p>No, because you have great little sayings.</p>
<p>You had a quote yesterday that I loved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to quote myself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, here it is.</p>
<p>Jonathan is having a Japanese wife, a Chinese cook, a British country home, and an American</p>
<p>salary.</p>
<p>Hell, on the other hand, is having a Chinese salary, a British cook, a Japanese house,</p>
<p>and an American wife.</p>
<p>So straight up misogyny.</p>
<p>Just like, boom.</p>
<p>We want to-</p>
<p>Apparently he was married to you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We will, if this is not the funeral of our podcast, we will see you next Tuesday.</p>
