<p>bodies have um an incredible ability to</p>
<p>adapt to different diets so uh some</p>
<p>people have an issue some people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but the</p>
<p>benefits of doing that especially if you</p>
<p>have gut</p>
<p>inflammation you just pretty much uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating a healing response to</p>
<p>your gut um because in that situation</p>
<p>your system is compromised where you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tolerate these fibers or legumes</p>
<p>or or anything other than um some</p>
<p>protein and so and fat so it seems to</p>
<p>work uh but I would recommend not just</p>
<p>doing muscle protein I would also</p>
<p>recommend doing like the eggs the fish</p>
<p>things like that but</p>
<p>um um but it&rsquo;s something to um test the</p>
<p>waters and then see how you do um do I</p>
<p>recommend it long term it really depends</p>
<p>on the the sever of damage but once your</p>
<p>gut heels maybe you want to start</p>
<p>introducing um things like um sauerkraut</p>
<p>or fermented vegetables in smaller</p>
<p>amounts and gradually increase it after</p>
<p>that all right very good Natalie from</p>
<p>YouTube again I&rsquo;ve heard or YouTube</p>
<p>again again not Natalie I&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>it can be dangerous to take B1</p>
<p>supplements because they are linked to</p>
<p>cancer what are your thoughts on this</p>
<p>and taking supplements in</p>
<p>general okay I&rsquo;ve never heard that</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ll have to show me some of</p>
<p>the research on that um B1 typically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s water soluable it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>a problem there are fat cable but um I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just the reverse because</p>
<p>cancer originates in the mitochondria</p>
<p>and vitamin B1 actually protects the</p>
<p>mitochondria it helps metabolism within</p>
<p>that kreb cycle so I think it can reduce</p>
<p>your chances of cancer versus causing</p>
<p>cancer um even at higher levels I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen any problems with that of</p>
<p>course you have also the synthetic</p>
<p>version of B1 um which I think um I</p>
<p>would go for the natural one because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be better but typically</p>
<p>nutrition in general um you want to go</p>
<p>for you want to find the source uh a</p>
<p>good source of it you don&rsquo;t want to just</p>
<p>do the synthetic even the antioxidants</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s it they they try to</p>
<p>synthesize the um the exact replication</p>
<p>but in nature nothing comes as one</p>
<p>individual</p>
<p>fractionated nutrient it always comes in</p>
<p>a complex especially with the</p>
<p>antioxidants because think about it when</p>
<p>you have this free radical which is like</p>
<p>if you look at it&rsquo;s called an unpaired</p>
<p>electron so it&rsquo;s kind of like this plate</p>
<p>spinning around in the circle um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of wobbly because it&rsquo;s not balanced</p>
<p>with two weights so if it&rsquo;s a free</p>
<p>radical it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>unpaired electron right so then it</p>
<p>creates a lot of Destruction so here</p>
<p>this antioxidant comes in and it donates</p>
<p>an electron to help balance that free</p>
<p>radical and now it&rsquo;s stable but what</p>
<p>just happened to that antioxidant it now</p>
<p>becomes unstable because it had a donate</p>
<p>electron so in nature you have a um</p>
<p>networks of antioxidants that uh they</p>
<p>borrow another electron from another</p>
<p>antioxidant and they keep doing that and</p>
<p>they keep doing that until the point</p>
<p>where it becomes very stable so in</p>
<p>nature when you take a lot of like one</p>
<p>antioxidant it creates some some</p>
<p>additional problems even in increased</p>
<p>risk of cancer so if you stick with u uh</p>
<p>food-based</p>
<p>antioxidants food base nutrition for the</p>
<p>most part you&rsquo;re going to stay out of</p>
<p>trouble excellent excellent counsel</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Don and Jennifer from YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from 185 pounds to 157 thanks</p>
<p>to your program and you&rsquo;ve helped me fix</p>
<p>my digestive issues I&rsquo;m a 17-year-old</p>
<p>retired army ranger who wishes to salute</p>
<p>you so there you have it Dr ber and you</p>
<p>were Army weren&rsquo;t you uh yourself yeah</p>
<p>Army see all right there you go is that</p>
<p>whoa I forget what all the things are</p>
<p>but no no all right well no this is not</p>
<p>the Marines oh that&rsquo;s right okay well</p>
<p>good us civilians will stick to our</p>
<p>stuff here and let you guys decide that</p>
<p>okay so uh evina from Facebook how can I</p>
<p>apply your Healthy keto and fasting</p>
<p>protocols for someone who has Gilbert</p>
<p>gilar Syndrome excuse me gilar syndrome</p>
<p>syndrome just like you would apply it if</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have that condition um you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>want to do the healthy version of it</p>
<p>just uh because remember keto is just</p>
<p>low carb it doesn&rsquo;t mean healthy</p>
<p>ingredients so you want to do the uh</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s nutrient dense make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quality ingredients and uh it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>if you if you add in that intermittent</p>
<p>fasting with the healthy version of Keto</p>
<p>I think you have the perfect plan to</p>
<p>create more health and so um</p>
<p>um I can&rsquo;t even think of even one</p>
<p>situation where it would be</p>
<p>contraindicated at all even if someone</p>
<p>is pregnant or even lactating they still</p>
<p>should do keto but maybe not</p>
<p>intermittent fasting but keto I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t see any</p>
<p>situations where you would it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>contraindicated all right very good well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the green room because aloc</p>
<p>from Phoenix his his video&rsquo;s been going</p>
<p>in and out and now he looks absolutely</p>
<p>lovely so so while the video is holding</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put them on alock you&rsquo;re on with</p>
<p>Dr ber for your one quick question</p>
<p>please thank you so much uh thank you Dr</p>
<p>bur for taking my question I really</p>
<p>follow you a lot I watch a lot of your</p>
<p>videos um and I&rsquo;ve have been following</p>
<p>uh doing all the right things I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>uh doing intermittent fastings I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing fasting I&rsquo;ve been doing uh taking</p>
<p>all the right food um probiotics or R</p>
<p>and whatnot but uh whenever I go and</p>
<p>check my vitamin and minerals I lack a</p>
<p>lot of them I take supplements as well</p>
<p>uh but still I lack um vitamin and</p>
<p>minerals uh like vitamin D especially</p>
<p>B12 um a lot of it um so I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reason reason there um and</p>
<p>then um other problems I have is I get</p>
<p>flu all the time every time I go like I</p>
<p>feel just fine right now I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>fine but if I go and get tested I</p>
<p>probably will find out that I&rsquo;m flu</p>
<p>positive I&rsquo;m like out of 10 times out of</p>
<p>10 out of eight out of 10 times I&rsquo;m flu</p>
<p>positive and it&rsquo;s mostly Flu Boo flu B</p>
<p>uh I have taken shot as well um for flu</p>
<p>but still it comes out to be positive uh</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t seem to understand the reason</p>
<p>uh behind all of these things got it I</p>
<p>think what you&rsquo;re saying is you get</p>
<p>tested for influenza the flu right yeah</p>
<p>comes out positive always and I feel</p>
<p>fine I feel just okay all the</p>
<p>time you know um there is such a thing I</p>
<p>mean as a false false positive and if</p>
<p>especially if you feel fine I mean what</p>
<p>are you g to do you g to treat it if you</p>
<p>still feel fine what about just</p>
<p>supporting the immune system that would</p>
<p>be a uh kind of A New Concept with h</p>
<p>zinc vitamin C and vitamin D now you</p>
<p>mentioned something very important um if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking this supplement especially</p>
<p>D and even</p>
<p>B12 um and you still test uh deficient</p>
<p>there are there&rsquo;s a condition it&rsquo;s a DNA</p>
<p>uh problem and the term you can look it</p>
<p>up it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s called polymorphism</p>
<p>where your some of your genes are um</p>
<p>altered in a way that makes it very</p>
<p>difficult to absorb vitamin D in fact I</p>
<p>recently looked at the 23 people I think</p>
<p>it was roughly 23 rough could be 24 but</p>
<p>people that I tested with the DNA and</p>
<p>100% of them had at least one gene that</p>
<p>was not allowing them to either absorb</p>
<p>vitamin D or convert from the inactive</p>
<p>to the active I that that was like</p>
<p>amazing now that was a small sample but</p>
<p>still so you may uh have some genetic</p>
<p>problem that prevents you from absorbing</p>
<p>those two nutrients which are very</p>
<p>common issue so</p>
<p>solution is to take more of it take more</p>
<p>take 20 or even 30,000 iuse and then</p>
<p>also um you can take uh more b b B12 but</p>
<p>just make sure that that form of B12 is</p>
<p>not in the synthetic form which is</p>
<p>called cyano Calamine you want the uh</p>
<p>methyl Calamine which actually You&rsquo; want</p>
<p>to take it with like folate in B6 as</p>
<p>well and you could find that but yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of genetic uh</p>
<p>issu isues that prevent people from</p>
<p>absorbing nutrients that&rsquo;s on top of all</p>
<p>the other issues like malabsorption your</p>
<p>gut or maybe low stomach acid so yeah we</p>
<p>want to increase absorption and um I</p>
<p>think the solution is just to take more</p>
<p>of it that would simply override any</p>
<p>type of resistance especially to your</p>
<p>receptors for vitamin D if you have even</p>
<p>if you have a chronic infection going on</p>
<p>in your body um those microbes are very</p>
<p>sneaky and they tend to downgrade your</p>
<p>receptors especially for vitamin D as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re strategy because I know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of your immune system so the way to</p>
<p>solve it is to um take more take more</p>
<p>nutrition it&rsquo;s not going to be a</p>
<p>problem is there any test we can get it</p>
<p>done to to diagnose these conditions I</p>
<p>did get genetic testing done some time</p>
<p>back um and that was not for this</p>
<p>purposes but that for for for fertility</p>
<p>purposes but everything came out to be</p>
<p>fine that point and also I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this condition now I mean I not have I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>44 years old and up to up to the age of</p>
<p>like 35 40 I was just fine it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>happening like last few few years</p>
<p>welcome to getting older no I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>kidding uh I think what I would um I</p>
<p>would uh just hang in there for um a few</p>
<p>more weeks I&rsquo;m going to do a video and</p>
<p>interview the great uh Greek Doctor Who</p>
<p>actually specialized in something called</p>
<p>metabolomics which is I think the the</p>
<p>Medicine of the future which they can</p>
<p>look at a lot more information in your</p>
<p>blood and urine to pick up things that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t detect from normal blood</p>
<p>tissues because you&rsquo;re looking at all</p>
<p>the different um uh enzymes and the and</p>
<p>you can even visualize the inside of the</p>
<p>mitochondria where you have the CB cycle</p>
<p>and look at each stage of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening to find the bottlenecks and</p>
<p>seeing what you&rsquo;re really missing so</p>
<p>this is I wish I had this in practice</p>
<p>this uh way of evaluating someone it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very Dynamic way better than a blood</p>
<p>test because it goes deep into um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the metabolites which are the end</p>
<p>products of this whole chain reaction of</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>biochemistry it&rsquo;s something it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bit difficult to understand if you</p>
<p>just start a reading on it but I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to make it really simple but um I will</p>
<p>do a video on it and I will have a link</p>
<p>where you can get that test but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>awesome well that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>look forward to it that&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>listen let us know go out there and gulp</p>
<p>some more real vitamin D and by the way</p>
<p>I will brag on Dr Burks 10,000 I use per</p>
<p>capsule so it wouldn&rsquo;t take many for you</p>
<p>to get up to speed I&rsquo;ve taken them and</p>
<p>have no uh noted ill effects feel great</p>
<p>so thanks again and do check back in</p>
<p>with us uh ack and why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>our first quiz question of the day and</p>
<p>Doc here it</p>
<p>is okay which is better for Sleep yogurt</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>kefir right yogurt or kefir audience</p>
<p>climb on that let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media and let&rsquo;s find out if there are in</p>
<p>fact anyone viewing the show this</p>

<p>done audience but we want to acknowledge</p>
<p>everyone Finland and all across these</p>
<p>United States of America so thanks</p>
<p>everybody so much uh for joining the</p>
<p>show and um uh Dr Berg Believe It or Not</p>
<p>Combs through all of your comments even</p>
<p>though we can&rsquo;t take them on the air and</p>
<p>from that is that is all the for great</p>
<p>new videos so that your input is</p>
<p>extremely important and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>keeps things fresh for us and allows Dr</p>
<p>Berg to continue to communicate with his</p>
<p>great videos and so forth now back</p>
<p>to uh back to social media again uban</p>
<p>from Facebook what supplements would</p>
<p>help resolve sciatica</p>
<p>pain huh I just uh I did a video on that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s many different U</p>
<p>nutrients involved in itic paint you</p>
<p>know um copper is the trace mineral that</p>
<p>can help you because there&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>relationship to having a deficiency and</p>
<p>having a problem with your milein sheath</p>
<p>of this and there&rsquo;s a condition that if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in comper and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to give you the long name of this</p>
<p>disease but it affects the the</p>
<p>articulation between the spinal column</p>
<p>and this in the peripheral nerves which</p>
<p>is basically what stica nerve is s Saka</p>
<p>pain is so uh if you could um consume</p>
<p>more copper uh of course in a base of</p>
<p>more of of the other trace minerals too</p>
<p>that could potentially help you a lot</p>
<p>but uh I recently released a video on</p>
<p>that um and then also the other thing is</p>
<p>to get one of those foam rollers to add</p>
<p>that support in your lower back to keep</p>
<p>that curve forward in your lower back</p>
<p>for cica that&rsquo;s going to help greatly so</p>
<p>those are a few things and I have other</p>
<p>stretches you can watch</p>
<p>but pyic is definitely a pain in the you</p>
<p>know what literally yeah terrible thing</p>
<p>okay the audience leapt on your first</p>
<p>question which asked uh which is better</p>
<p>for Sleep yogurt or kefir and 98% of a</p>
<p>respondents say kefir and 2% are holding</p>
<p>out hoping that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yogurt it&rsquo;s kefir Kefir is unique</p>
<p>because it has um about five times more</p>
<p>microbes than yogurt plus kefir has a</p>
<p>combination of friendly yeast and</p>
<p>friendly bacteria as whereas whereas</p>
<p>yogurt is only has the bacteria with</p>
<p>just one to five strains um kefir has</p>
<p>between 15 to 20 to 30 or 50 strains of</p>
<p>different microbes so the byproducts of</p>
<p>kefir um that will give you certain</p>
<p>properties certain effects and uh one is</p>
<p>lowering of cortisol another is the</p>
<p>production of</p>
<p>neurotransmitters like serotonin but</p>
<p>even though our gut makes serotonin like</p>
<p>90% it can&rsquo;t cross the blood brain</p>
<p>barrier but it can convert into uh</p>
<p>melatonin eventually which then uh you</p>
<p>know ends up helping you sleep so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s several reasons why Keir</p>
<p>is better uh for sleeping I would</p>
<p>recommend taking it in the maybe after</p>
<p>your dinner maybe not right before bed</p>
<p>because that way you might interrupt</p>
<p>your intermittent fasting but if you can</p>
<p>find a goat milk kefir or even a sheep</p>
<p>milk kefir that would be better than the</p>
<p>cow&rsquo;s milk um for many different reasons</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll release a video on it but um you</p>
<p>might want to try it I think it can help</p>
<p>you if you look at my videos in the</p>
<p>response uh in the comment section of</p>
<p>how many people were finally able to</p>
<p>sleep because they had kefir it was</p>
<p>tremendous so and you can even make your</p>
<p>own uh you don&rsquo;t have to even buy it</p>
<p>from the grocery store all right very</p>
<p>good and I&rsquo;m feeling a little mournful</p>
<p>for the 2% of the yogurts but at least</p>
<p>he did say there&rsquo;s a few strands of</p>
<p>something good in that so take heart but</p>
<p>go get some kefir if you want the real</p>
<p>deal okay and there&rsquo;s other people that</p>
<p>feel left out Uh I that we want to give</p>
<p>a shout out to somebody of that just</p>
<p>checked in from Iraq Hungary the</p>
<p>Philippines South Korea Indonesia Guyana</p>
<p>and turkey so welcome all of you folks</p>
<p>glad that you&rsquo;re watching and um let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to some more social media questions</p>
<p>Gary from Facebook I have been diagnosed</p>
<p>with prostate cancer if I do a 48 hour</p>
<p>fast every week will that help me get</p>
<p>rid of the</p>
<p>cancer yeah right I I that I can&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell you yes or no but I can say</p>
<p>the more severe the stage of cancer the</p>
<p>longer you have to fast so um if you</p>
<p>have stage four I would fast for a</p>
<p>little more than 48 hours I would</p>
<p>definitely fast do that but then I would</p>
<p>probably do a 21 day fast maybe even a</p>
<p>30-day fast if it was that severe um and</p>
<p>if it maybe wasn&rsquo;t that severe I would</p>
<p>do a a week</p>
<p>fast so that&rsquo;s just the general</p>
<p>principle that I think um could</p>
<p>potentially help your immune system to</p>
<p>to fight this thing and overcome it um</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a great Channel um that uh</p>
<p>if you just look up my videos on cancer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the a channel that a</p>
<p>gentleman uh who had the prostate cancer</p>
<p>who has his own channel YouTube channel</p>
<p>and he he talks a lot about it um what</p>
<p>he did to recover um and how he he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing great he&rsquo;s still alive and uh he</p>
<p>should have been dead a long time ago so</p>
<p>I always like to learn from people that</p>
<p>have gotten results in that</p>
<p>area all right very good Mandy from</p>
<p>YouTube not Everyone likes their</p>
<p>mother-in-law but Mandy&rsquo;s concerned</p>
<p>about her my mother-in-law gets diarrhea</p>
<p>about three times a month and she feels</p>
<p>so weak afterward she doesn&rsquo;t have or</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t have a gallbladder is there</p>
<p>anything you can do to suggest that</p>
<p>would help her with that</p>
<p>issue well that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of dangerous</p>
<p>to have diarrhea and lose all your</p>
<p>electrolytes so I would put those</p>
<p>electrolytes in including the trace</p>
<p>minerals that&rsquo;s and sea salt as well to</p>
<p>get the sodium because that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re feeling tired but if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder there and that&rsquo;s when your</p>
<p>diarrhea started that means that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s releasing too much because one side</p>
<p>effect from too much bile um which is</p>
<p>normally not the case when you remove</p>
<p>the gallbladder but sometimes it is then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to take you&rsquo;d have to go to</p>
<p>the doctor and take a certain medication</p>
<p>to um to alter that um</p>
<p>excess so um but that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend and then um one thing that I</p>
<p>do if you take the kefir and the</p>
<p>blackberries and then you blend it in a</p>
<p>shake and consume that that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good remedy for diarrhea to kind of like</p>
<p>stop the diarrhea and uh help you</p>
<p>fortify with the microbes all right well</p>
<p>good luck with that and thanks so much</p>
<p>for taking care of your mother-in-law</p>
<p>Mandy let&rsquo;s see Vincent from YouTube how</p>
<p>can I convince here&rsquo;s a challenge my</p>
<p>kids that healthy keto is the best way</p>
<p>for them to</p>
<p>eat um it&rsquo;s really difficult so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gon to maybe have to have some new</p>
<p>kids either and then start over again</p>
<p>and then just don&rsquo;t show them all this</p>
<p>these sweets and sugars to try to break</p>
<p>that have it but I think the best thing</p>
<p>is education uh keep educating</p>
<p>them um to the point where it finally</p>
<p>rubs off but uh that is the difficult</p>
<p>thing um sometimes they have to go</p>
<p>through um their</p>
<p>own effects bad effects to finally you</p>
<p>know can decide on their own that they</p>
<p>should change but uh um yeah use</p>
<p>the um just education I think that would</p>
<p>be the best approach in right</p>
<p>now very good let go to our next</p>
<p>question this is a true falser there it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>Doc all right but I think the Chinese</p>
<p>water torture might also have come in</p>
<p>handy okay next question is uh during</p>
<p>the uh Paleolithic times like the Stone</p>
<p>Age times man consumed nearly</p>
<p>15,000 milligrams of potassium from</p>
<p>foods is that true or false wow they</p>
<p>were gnawing on something if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>true okay audience climb on that let me</p>
<p>put a check by</p>
<p>that you know I have some duy here but</p>
<p>for some reason I&rsquo;m one of the worst</p>
<p>quiz question askers and answerers</p>
<p>keeping track of that but I have a list</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m very proud of it and I make a</p>
<p>little check mark so hopefully that will</p>
<p>solve that issue uh once and for all</p>
<p>okay back to social media again</p>
<p>um oh Terry said something about don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give the Bratz a meal that&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>Terry leave the kids alone all right um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Jane from YouTube after lumbar</p>
<p>surgery on my L4 and L five I now have</p>
<p>numbness excuse me in both feet what</p>
<p>should I do now to overcome this</p>
<p>condition you want to take something</p>
<p>that supports the nerves uh and it would</p>
<p>definitely be the B vitamins uh B12 make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s the methyl camine but also um</p>
<p>I would highly recommend higher doses</p>
<p>doses of something called</p>
<p>benine benine which is good for</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy but it does help</p>
<p>uh the regrowing of of the nervous</p>
<p>system and the mile and sheath</p>
<p>uh so that would be Beno to me and I</p>
<p>would take probably four of those a day</p>
<p>spread them out over a period of time to</p>
<p>help restore that nerve and of course go</p>
<p>on a low carb diet too because um</p>
<p>diabetes tends to really worsen your</p>
<p>nervous your nerves and um it promotes</p>
<p>problems with the nervous system so we</p>
<p>want to go low carb all right very good</p>
<p>Rachel from YouTube will your</p>
<p>nutritional yeast powder break a fast I</p>
<p>cannot swallow your</p>
<p>tablets no no won&rsquo;t break a fast because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing a lot of calories um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a and you&rsquo;re not doing a lot of</p>
<p>sugar so you&rsquo;re dealing with a little</p>
<p>bit of amino acids with um trace</p>
<p>minerals and B in the B vitamins</p>
<p>unfortified so um I in the morning I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take a I&rsquo;ll chew like three or four of</p>
<p>those uh nutritional yeast um tablets</p>
<p>and yeah it&rsquo;s not the easiest thing to</p>
<p>chew kind of gets in your teeth but um I</p>
<p>feel good when when I take those B</p>
<p>vitamins it&rsquo;s a good source and uh um</p>
<p>you know you can also get the powdered</p>
<p>and put it on your salad which is really</p>
<p>amazing but I know you like those those</p>
<p>chables right Steve I do I really find</p>
<p>them satisfying in fact sometimes use</p>
<p>them as to hedge you know off any hunger</p>
<p>that I have so chew it for goodness</p>
<p>sakes you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll grow to really like</p>
<p>the taste kind of nutty or whatever so</p>
<p>go for it and no fast breaking with it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great news okay Claudia from</p>
<p>Facebook can macular degeneration be</p>
<p>reversed I think so I think so if you</p>
<p>get it in time um you want to um start</p>
<p>consuming foods with um high levels of</p>
<p>uh antioxidants and naturally it comes</p>
<p>from food like these really good high</p>
<p>quality salads grown in soil and also</p>
<p>um you know there&rsquo;s other remedies that</p>
<p>you can take to I&rsquo;ve done videos on on</p>
<p>this um like even like zinc Seafood</p>
<p>shellfish organ Meats like liver all</p>
<p>have great nutrition to help um counter</p>
<p>the destruction of this including the</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids from from either</p>
<p>salmon or um some seafood because when</p>
<p>you do a lot of um processed seed oils</p>
<p>like corn oil soy oil canola that tends</p>
<p>to worsen worsen that situation more</p>
<p>than help it macular degeneration which</p>
<p>is normally happens when you get older</p>
<p>but by with those oils it kind of</p>
<p>accelerates it so you want to avoid</p>
<p>those all right now poor Pablo from</p>
<p>YouTube I think somebody&rsquo;s been pushing</p>
<p>his leg because he says I&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>brushing your teeth can break a fast is</p>
<p>that true no no no it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>break your fast I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>it unless you&rsquo;re swallowing all that</p>
<p>toothpaste which probably not he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably dipping it into a hot fudge</p>
<p>Sunday and that&rsquo;s another case so uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see um we put out the second</p>
<p>question let me get another one</p>
<p>here okay we did that feed me something</p>
<p>Terry uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see okay here we go SP Spyro and I</p>
<p>missed this before thank you Terry from</p>
<p>Facebook please share your thoughts on</p>
<p>fasting and muscle</p>
<p>gain so there is a situation when you</p>
<p>when you when you go on a</p>
<p>fast people are concerned about losing</p>
<p>muscle um there is an interesting um</p>
<p>counter to that or protective mechanism</p>
<p>set in place when you go fast because um</p>
<p>you know it goes against survival of</p>
<p>this loss of muscle we need that as a</p>
<p>survival thing so our body will one of</p>
<p>the big triggers for growth hormone</p>
<p>which is a a great protector of your</p>
<p>muscles is fasting so there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a point where if you fast a longer</p>
<p>period of time time you&rsquo;ll start to use</p>
<p>muscle but typically the body starts</p>
<p>using fat as fuel to get between these</p>
<p>um times of</p>
<p>fasting now is fasting going to actually</p>
<p>directly build muscle no it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>just help you prevent the loss of muscle</p>
<p>um but if you were excuse me if you were</p>
<p>to um fast in a prolonged way and you</p>
<p>were to take as a supplement</p>
<p>a really good combination of amino acids</p>
<p>okay that would give you the amino acids</p>
<p>without the protein and the other stuff</p>
<p>I think that would be a really good way</p>
<p>especially if you do prolong fasting and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re concerned about loss of</p>
<p>muscle and then if you added exercise to</p>
<p>that that would be really great because</p>
<p>exercise is the strongest uh um</p>
<p>conductor or just the stimulus of the</p>
<p>muscle growth</p>
<p>itself um but but that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>um to help conserve your muscles and uh</p>
<p>prevent the loss of muscle I will be</p>
<p>releasing another video on some</p>
<p>additional things you can do as far as</p>
<p>what you eat but</p>
<p>um you know the the one of the</p>
<p>challenges people have when they go on a</p>
<p>fast is they they their muscles tend to</p>
<p>look flat because you&rsquo;re losing all this</p>
<p>stored glycogen which is loaded with</p>
<p>water so it kind might look a little</p>
<p>flat because it doesn&rsquo;t have the water</p>
<p>in there</p>
<p>so sometimes people think oh I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>on a fast I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m having muscle loss no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a loss of water around</p>
<p>your muscles because you even think of</p>
<p>bodybuilders before a match they might</p>
<p>carbo</p>
<p>load not for building up muscle but to</p>
<p>just to fill it up with water so it</p>
<p>looks plump and big and things like that</p>
<p>looks full so</p>
<p>um but you&rsquo;re not going to lose water</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to lose muscle if you</p>
<p>do like just regular in a minute</p>
<p>fasting uh just don&rsquo;t also forget to be</p>
<p>hydrated with enough sea salt and</p>
<p>pottassium also is necessary for that</p>
<p>formation of glycogen too so um these</p>
<p>are all just aspects of the muscle um</p>
<p>related to fasting and making sure that</p>
<p>you you actually don&rsquo;t lose your muscle</p>
<p>all right very good good plan okay</p>
<p>question number two is a true falser and</p>
<p>it asked during the Paleolithic times</p>
<p>man consume nearly 15,000 Mig of</p>
<p>potassium from Foods uh is that true or</p>
<p>false uh and 85% of respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and 15% claim that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false well there&rsquo;s a lot of data that</p>
<p>shows that&rsquo;s true and I actually I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do a video on that and release</p>
<p>that that research study but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>between I think they calculated between</p>
<p>11,000 to 15,000 milligrams I mean think</p>
<p>about this out of all the nutrients</p>
<p>potassium is needed in the most amounts</p>
<p>if you compare that to any other</p>
<p>nutrient we need normally like 4700 to</p>
<p>5,000 milligrams I mean that&rsquo;s like way</p>
<p>more than any other nutrient right but</p>
<p>that might even be not enough based on</p>
<p>our genetics and and so what would</p>
<p>happen if you started to increase more</p>
<p>potassium from the diet well um would</p>
<p>that be bad on the kidneys well your</p>
<p>kidneys are designed</p>
<p>very robustly to get rid of excess</p>
<p>potassium just so you know and the only</p>
<p>contraindication is if you have end</p>
<p>stage stage five kidney failure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;d want to start to be careful</p>
<p>with the pottassium but potassium is</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>protective uh for the kidney and this</p>
<p>potassium is uh part of the raw material</p>
<p>that feeds a very very vital important</p>
<p>purpose which is called the sodium</p>
<p>potassium p pump which is the thing that</p>
<p>generates the battery like voltage for</p>
<p>your nervous system and your muscle</p>
<p>contraction the nerve signals that</p>
<p>transmit through the nerves and both in</p>
<p>muscle as well as cardiac muscle not to</p>
<p>mention the nervous system in the brain</p>
<p>so if when you give more potassium you</p>
<p>get uh better smooth muscle contraction</p>
<p>even in your arteries so your blood</p>
<p>pressure comes down you get more energy</p>
<p>especially when you exercise size and</p>
<p>you get better nerve conduction so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you might want to experiment</p>
<p>with is beef up your potassium no pun</p>
<p>intended to the point where um you just</p>
<p>might feel a lot better with whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through versus to be be too</p>
<p>low on potassium boy what benefits all</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m going to take that to heart I</p>
<p>hope everyone else does too and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our next question doc there it is why is</p>
<p>it difficult to determine potassium</p>
<p>levels from your blood doing a blood</p>
<p>test okay I&rsquo;m sure the audience has a</p>
<p>great answer and now I want we go back</p>
<p>to our green room and this time is</p>
<p>Christina and I believe she&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>Michigan let me unmute her and I think</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to do the same and Christina</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t wait to hear your one question</p>
<p>belted out in 30 seconds and Dr bur</p>
<p>would give you a great answer</p>
<p>go thank you hello Dr Burke it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pleasure to meet you I&rsquo;m a newcomer to</p>
<p>watching your um videos on Facebook it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>become a great um inspiration for me um</p>
<p>I have somewhat followed a natural diet</p>
<p>throughout my life although now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>noticing where my shortcomings are my</p>
<p>particular question is is that in</p>
<p>um late fall last year I was initially</p>
<p>diagnosed with</p>
<p>C or</p>
<p>CL um as of early August I&rsquo;ve been told</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mono B cell lympo</p>
<p>cytosis and I&rsquo;m most interested in what</p>
<p>I can do to bring that white count down</p>
<p>my white count is running approximately</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>15.6 and I&rsquo;m getting it checked about</p>
<p>every three months just</p>
<p>to uh watch it thank you okay so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with a condition where your</p>
<p>immune system is overreacting okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the the the concept of it</p>
<p>an overreaction immune system with the</p>
<p>white blood cells that increased um</p>
<p>normally cortisol supposed to come in</p>
<p>there and help regulate that so it could</p>
<p>be it could be a couple factors in the</p>
<p>background of like maybe some chronic</p>
<p>stress that now created a situation</p>
<p>where your immune system is overactive</p>
<p>um because a lot of these conditions</p>
<p>occur after a stress event and that is a</p>
<p>very underrated or under acknowledged</p>
<p>area the stress connection to an immune</p>
<p>problem um that being said the compound</p>
<p>that most resembles cortisol from a</p>
<p>therapeutic standpoint is vitamin D so I</p>
<p>would if I were you start to increase</p>
<p>your vitamin D uh probably by U maybe 30</p>
<p>or even 40,000 I use this every uh and I</p>
<p>would take that maybe um not necessarily</p>
<p>every day you can actually get a better</p>
<p>effect from vitamin D if you let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take a to take your weekly</p>
<p>amounts that you would normally take and</p>
<p>then just maybe divide it up a few times</p>
<p>a week so it&rsquo;s not consistent because</p>
<p>you you take it erratically you actually</p>
<p>get a little bit more benefit and then I</p>
<p>would also take uh more zinc uh and some</p>
<p>of the trace minerals and eat really</p>
<p>healthy with the low carb diet and then</p>
<p>I would after about six weeks I&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>back and get re-evaluated to see how</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re doing at that point but we</p>
<p>really need to calm down the immune</p>
<p>system vitamin D is the key for that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a kind of a I would I guess I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>call it like a natural cortisol without</p>
<p>the side effects and so it tends to</p>
<p>regulate or modulate an</p>
<p>overreactive um higher level of white</p>
<p>blood</p>
<p>cells thank you I appreciate that</p>
<p>information yes I as most persons we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had a lot of stress in our lives and we</p>
<p>do the best we can to um alleviate and</p>
<p>sail through those times so thank you</p>
<p>again for all your help and all of your</p>
<p>information that you do make available</p>
<p>to all of us out here that are of trying</p>
<p>to live a healthy lifestyle thank you</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome well thanks for those</p>
<p>kind words for the doctor in the show</p>
<p>Christina and we&rsquo;d love to hear back</p>
<p>from you and see if you can get that</p>
<p>that thing calmed down uh that would be</p>
<p>I will all right thank you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific okay well uh the audience just</p>
<p>absolutely leapt on this last question</p>
<p>which is why is it difficult to</p>
<p>determine potassium uh levels in your</p>
<p>blood and I wanted to answer because I</p>
<p>knew well I hope they&rsquo;re right 100% of</p>
<p>them say that it&rsquo;s because the blood</p>
<p>tests not the best method because</p>
<p>potassium resides primarily in our</p>
<p>cells wow we have a smart audience</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s totally true it&rsquo;s uh the</p>
<p>great majority of potassium is inside</p>
<p>the cell like out of your whole body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>99.5% of it is intracellularly so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re checking the blood you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to miss it and you&rsquo;re also going to miss</p>
<p>it for magnesium as well um you can</p>
<p>check sodium sodium is outside the cell</p>
<p>in the plasma in the blood but not</p>
<p>potassium magnesium so um you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really get a true picture of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with potassium you have to</p>
<p>kind of look at um you can do um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain test looking at the</p>
<p>intracellular potassium off of your red</p>
<p>blood cell you can look at that um but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ways too but not a typical</p>
<p>blood test I think that&rsquo;s really a big</p>
<p>issue that I see even in medical</p>
<p>diagnosis if you&rsquo;re just working on a</p>
<p>blood test you&rsquo;re not going to get the</p>
<p>enough information because the body will</p>
<p>do everything it can to keep blood to be</p>
<p>normal as a constant especially calcium</p>
<p>you realize you could be osteoporotic</p>
<p>have complete thinning of the bones and</p>
<p>have normal calcium in the blood</p>
<p>interesting ah so the body compensates</p>
<p>so um this is why I like this this new</p>
<p>metabolomic testing um not metab or</p>
<p>baloney whatever it&rsquo;s metabone bonic</p>
<p>testing bonic testing so um it&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of a new thing that&rsquo;s going to be I</p>
<p>think the wave of the future for for</p>
<p>medicine um and functional medicine and</p>
<p>natural medicine as well and that&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>baloney that&rsquo;s right all right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s uh well let&rsquo;s throw out another</p>
<p>question they&rsquo;re doing so well this is a</p>
<p>true falser folks so again 50/50 chance</p>
<p>of being</p>
<p>brilliant all right true or false most</p>
<p>people get enough biotin from their</p>
<p>diet All Right audience what do you</p>
<p>think okay oh Donna from sorry for</p>
<p>laughing Donna from YouTube I have</p>
<p>bleeding hemorrhoids I&rsquo;m such a child</p>
<p>help Steve you you shouldn&rsquo;t be laughing</p>
<p>at these these people with these</p>
<p>conditions but um um that&rsquo;s usually a</p>
<p>kind of a dilated uh lymphatic problem</p>
<p>which usually is stemming from the</p>
<p>liver um so I would focus uh your</p>
<p>energies on the liver strengthen the</p>
<p>liver get on the right diet do things to</p>
<p>help your liver milk this thisle is a</p>
<p>wonderful herb there are other direct</p>
<p>remedies um that you can do I do videos</p>
<p>on that but ultimately there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on with the liver that you need to</p>
<p>address and of course if there is a</p>
<p>constant Pati involved you have to deal</p>
<p>with that too and the best way to remedy</p>
<p>that is something like um a good amount</p>
<p>of B1 or uh maybe you need more bios</p>
<p>salts uh to help your gallbladder or</p>
<p>maybe you need um more probotics so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different different reasons for</p>
<p>that well my apologies Donna I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>probably next with that condition so</p>
<p>watch it Janice from YouTube what advice</p>
<p>would you share with someone who is on</p>
<p>your Healthy Keto Plan but doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to lose weight uh what can uh what to</p>
<p>maintain but you know don&rsquo;t want to lose</p>
<p>weight and maintain Optimum</p>
<p>Health I would just do two meals a day</p>
<p>but just have have more calories make</p>
<p>sure that you take the same calories you</p>
<p>would have on your normal day and then</p>
<p>just break it into two so that way we</p>
<p>have the intermittent fasting but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just eating uh a bit more calories uh</p>
<p>than you would if you you just like some</p>
<p>because the problem is when you start</p>
<p>reducing your um the the timing so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating so frequently you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>obviously going to eat less because the</p>
<p>hunger goes down and there&rsquo;s only so</p>
<p>much you can eat eat per per meal but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re concerned about the weight</p>
<p>maintaining it which I am you just have</p>
<p>have to eat bigger portions and more</p>
<p>food and maybe a little more fat and</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s going to slow down your um</p>
<p>your weight loss you&rsquo;ll get the benefits</p>
<p>of Keto and am of fasting without the</p>
<p>benefit of the weight loss or the</p>
<p>drawback of weight loss I wish I could</p>
<p>find a drawback in weight loss uh Nita</p>
<p>from Facebook what&rsquo;s a natural and</p>
<p>effective way to address pain from ouch</p>
<p>bone on bone knee</p>
<p>condition well um the typical I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you have tried the Ren sulfate</p>
<p>or um some of the natural joint remedies</p>
<p>that they have out there um but I would</p>
<p>definitely do that Omega 6 fatty acid</p>
<p>would be good um there are um certain</p>
<p>types of um procedures now that involve</p>
<p>stem cell therapy which is another thing</p>
<p>to look at too um or even injections</p>
<p>that they can do U to help stimulate the</p>
<p>growth of</p>
<p>carage um you using different forms</p>
<p>natural type things&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>but yeah bone on bone um that is an</p>
<p>issue um you know believe it or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even when I was in practice I</p>
<p>had these patients come in you take an</p>
<p>x-ray and they had bone on bone but some</p>
<p>had no pain at all and total function</p>
<p>others had normal space in a lot of pain</p>
<p>so before you think it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know exactly that problem you know</p>
<p>change the diet see if your pain goes</p>
<p>away uh start um taking more omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids also be careful of the</p>
<p>oxalates because oxalates can cause knee</p>
<p>pain Big Time whether you have bone on</p>
<p>bone or not and that would be in the</p>
<p>almonds</p>
<p>spinach</p>
<p>chocolate okay and of course you know</p>
<p>beans and even certain nuts too so these</p>
<p>are just other things to look at um in</p>
<p>relationship to knee pain um so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do all right very good well</p>
<p>um our audience leapt on the true falser</p>
<p>which asks most people get enough biotin</p>
<p>from the diet and</p>
<p>99% uh say it&rsquo;s false and there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>outlier that says it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true okay so biotin is for your um your</p>
<p>hair your nails things like that um</p>
<p>which uh hopefully I didn&rsquo;t just answer</p>
<p>the next question St it I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>if I put that as a question but but</p>
<p>biotin is actually not as easy as you</p>
<p>think to get from the diet unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming eggs like egg</p>
<p>yolks and uh the or liver or kidney or</p>
<p>certain cheeses okay um then you you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get enough biotin but we typically if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>combine regular foods with having good</p>
<p>gut health you&rsquo;ll have enough biotin</p>
<p>because at Le at least over half of your</p>
<p>biotin Supply comes from your own</p>
<p>microbes that make it so this is why if</p>
<p>you are an</p>
<p>antibiotic that could be the reason why</p>
<p>you need you all of a sudden you lost</p>
<p>your Biotin and your hair loss went byby</p>
<p>but um the other unique thing about the</p>
<p>biotin that your microbes make is it</p>
<p>makes more free biotin versus on the</p>
<p>diet it comes locked in with the protein</p>
<p>that you have to digest it and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>is free so it&rsquo;s kind of like locked up</p>
<p>unavailable to you so this is what this</p>
<p>is another importance for gut health</p>
<p>especially as it relates to</p>
<p>biotin um there&rsquo;s a biotin shampoo that</p>
<p>um can actually penetrate the skin the</p>
<p>scalp and then stimulate more thicker</p>
<p>hair um so that&rsquo;s something that people</p>
<p>do as well so yeah biotin is</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to be doing a video on that</p>
<p>as well so you can actually learn more</p>
<p>about what it really does it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>interesting all right very good why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to London and go to uh</p>
<p>Marsha and she&rsquo;s I can see she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrestling to unmute herself which is</p>
<p>excellent okay I&rsquo;m going to wait for her</p>
<p>to get settled there you go and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with Dr Berg your quick question</p>
<p>please and you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>muted you&rsquo;re still muted dear see if you</p>
<p>can no now oh there we go</p>
<p>okay hi good afternoon and Dr bur and</p>
<p>Steve thank you very much for this</p>
<p>opportunity my question is regarding</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;ve been um used</p>
<p>to now to omad I&rsquo;ve been um doing it</p>
<p>relatively well and uh but he came to a</p>
<p>plateau some months ago I done 72 hours</p>
<p>was okay but then I went back to the</p>
<p>24 in your experience um would you think</p>
<p>I should I do like 120 hours to give a</p>
<p>good kick and</p>
<p>to you know um or do 72 like once a</p>
<p>month or more often or something like</p>
<p>that what do you think so so I have a</p>
<p>question when you um start fasting does</p>
<p>your hunger go away yes okay um do you</p>
<p>find that um like if you&rsquo;re doing omad</p>
<p>right now are you really really that</p>
<p>hungry before you eat even that one meal</p>
<p>a day or not</p>
<p>um I could extend it okay I think I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a bit of a habit when it</p>
<p>comes to that time of the day is meal</p>
<p>time yeah so the more weight that you</p>
<p>need to lose um the better it&rsquo;s to use</p>
<p>that principle only when you&rsquo;re uh when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hungry and don&rsquo;t eat if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry and just keep that in mind</p>
<p>because you you&rsquo;re right people eat</p>
<p>because of habit and tradition and</p>
<p>social reasons so I would go longer if I</p>
<p>were you why why would you do that</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re not eating you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually eating your your body&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>your fat and then all of a sudden you</p>
<p>eat and now now we just kind of slow</p>
<p>down our ketosis or or not our ketosis</p>
<p>but we break our fast and um we break</p>
<p>our ability to burn our own fat so I</p>
<p>would ride the wave and go longer to the</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re like okay I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>hungry now I feel weak I I I need to eat</p>
<p>and you may find for a while you could</p>
<p>fast um longer than um even 48 Hours um</p>
<p>it could even go up to you know three</p>
<p>even four or five days and then what you</p>
<p>do is have a good meal and then do it</p>
<p>again and just might as well take</p>
<p>advantage of the no appetite and go and</p>
<p>just get the weight off a to B faster</p>
<p>and then get your goal and then you can</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s going to be easier to</p>
<p>maintain it than to get there because</p>
<p>you need</p>
<p>momentum okay thank you very much thank</p>
<p>you very much for you&rsquo;re welcome your</p>
<p>your help thank you thank you Mara great</p>
<p>uh great question and can&rsquo;t wait to see</p>
<p>you come back after all your successes</p>
<p>and brag about on the air us that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>go to our uh final quiz</p>
<p>question uh and and this one is another</p>
<p>true falser there it is</p>
<p>Doc okay uh more than true or false more</p>
<p>than 60% of the calories Americans uh</p>
<p>regularly consume come from Ultra</p>
<p>processed</p>
<p>foods I hope that&rsquo;s not true but I bet</p>
<p>it is okay Jericho Jericho excuse me</p>
<p>from YouTube can too much protein</p>
<p>contribute to an increase in</p>
<p>acne um you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so I don&rsquo;t think so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible but I don&rsquo;t think so um usually</p>
<p>what contributes to acne</p>
<p>is maybe that uh you&rsquo;re eating a lot of</p>
<p>protein but you&rsquo;re also having carbs</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>it and or you&rsquo;re doing um yeah too many</p>
<p>carbs that&rsquo;s usually contributing to</p>
<p>that protein issue because um that will</p>
<p>stimulate the uh sebaceous gland from</p>
<p>producing more oil so um in some of the</p>
<p>videos that I do on acne um you need to</p>
<p>trace minerals like zinc but you want to</p>
<p>start looking at um health and uh large</p>
<p>salads are going to be good for your gut</p>
<p>health uh high quality protein things</p>
<p>like that and without all the other</p>
<p>chemicals so um that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend right well Lisa from Facebook</p>
<p>has heard that eating not eating enough</p>
<p>carbs will diminish your brain function</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on that and</p>
<p>healthy foods for the</p>
<p>brain no no what happens is your your</p>
<p>brain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um if that was true I mean think about</p>
<p>our as our bodies evolved right when</p>
<p>when we didn&rsquo;t have food available and</p>
<p>the Brain needs to survive what what</p>
<p>would happen back then you would have</p>
<p>been we wouldn&rsquo;t even be here right now</p>
<p>our bodies are really used to adapting</p>
<p>to not eating so frequently and they not</p>
<p>eating carbs</p>
<p>and um so our brains can run on ketones</p>
<p>very easily in fact they prefer</p>
<p>ketones now I recently</p>
<p>uhu this is very really weird um if you</p>
<p>type if you type the keto diet okay the</p>
<p>first ranking video is a medical video</p>
<p>um the comments are shut</p>
<p>off um with not very many thumbs up of</p>
<p>course they took away the thumbs down so</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really tell the ratios but you</p>
<p>sort of figure it out and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interview</p>
<p>about how unhealthy ketones are for your</p>
<p>body which is ridiculous and it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>how that&rsquo;s ranked number one which is</p>
<p>interesting um of course you can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>my video unless you I think maybe you go</p>
<p>20 Pages deep but it&rsquo;s just putting out</p>
<p>there the um the dangers of Keto and how</p>
<p>bad it is for the brain and just giving</p>
<p>people this idea that it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>unnatural when in fact it&rsquo;s very natural</p>
<p>and um you&rsquo;re going to feel really good</p>
<p>from it but they they put that little</p>
<p>sense of doubt in oh yeah well you might</p>
<p>be feeling great and you losing weight</p>
<p>but it could be creating problems that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know about I&rsquo;m like what are</p>
<p>you talking about that&rsquo;s ridiculous so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a a a</p>
<p>gross stupidity and under um</p>
<p>understanding the basic physiology of</p>
<p>how the body um PR can very easily adapt</p>
<p>to ketones and it&rsquo;s preferred than all</p>
<p>this sugar that people run on which is</p>
<p>crazy all right well I believe them I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going back to Captain Crunch right after</p>
<p>the show so that sounds like a great</p>
<p>health direction for me okay so our</p>
<p>final question boy the audience has been</p>
<p>so good uh with answering these uh even</p>
<p>though there&rsquo;s less pressure with a true</p>
<p>falser and true false more than 60% of</p>
<p>the calories Americans regularly consume</p>
<p>come from ultr processed foods drum roll</p>
<p>please 100% say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true that&rsquo;s true but what&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>interesting is in the grocery store 83%</p>
<p>of all the calories in the grocery store</p>
<p>are Ultra processed not just process but</p>
<p>Ultra process to the point where those</p>
<p>calories don&rsquo;t ever even don&rsquo;t even look</p>
<p>like food so they modify the starches</p>
<p>and all these proteins and even fats to</p>
<p>the point where it doesn&rsquo;t even resemble</p>
<p>food but it sits on the shelf for a long</p>
<p>time so um the question is um</p>
<p>what the heck is going on with our food</p>
<p>right go it&rsquo;s hard to find real food or</p>
<p>actual food in the grocery stores so</p>
<p>um welcome to um planet Earth where we</p>
<p>we it&rsquo;s hard to find food you know then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll um there&rsquo;ll be certain</p>
<p>campaigns that talk about the import</p>
<p>well if we don&rsquo;t have this processed</p>
<p>food we won&rsquo;t be able to feed people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go hungry well they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting healthy that&rsquo;s for darn sure</p>
<p>from these processed foods uh and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re highly addictive um Doritos I</p>
<p>used to love Doritos and uh if I started</p>
<p>eating Doritos right now I wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to stop it&rsquo;s that addicting so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem and I think if you give</p>
<p>even kids to have like real food that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not process they may even like it if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grown on soil that&rsquo;s because a lot</p>
<p>of the uh the vegetables nowadays are</p>
<p>grown on um they hydroponically which I</p>
<p>have the units I&rsquo;ve tested it out I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like the taste of it&rsquo;s just kind</p>
<p>of empty because it you&rsquo;re just putting</p>
<p>15 minerals in there versus growing</p>
<p>something in the garden or from soil so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of good information</p>
<p>coming down the pike on that topic I</p>
<p>want to talk about but um but the to get</p>
<p>healthy it&rsquo;s very hard to get healthy on</p>
<p>process Ultra processed</p>
<p>foods I think it&rsquo;s actually impossible</p>
<p>all right well here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably close to your heart Debbie from</p>
<p>Facebook what are your thoughts on Stem</p>
<p>Cell</p>
<p>Activation I don&rsquo;t know what the uh stem</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the activation part of</p>
<p>stem cell is because there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different types of stem cell um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done both type where they&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll you</p>
<p>can take it from umbilical cord um from</p>
<p>someone some other umbilical cord that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work for me um I do like the the</p>
<p>taking it from your fat and re-injecting</p>
<p>it still hasn&rsquo;t had enough time to</p>
<p>really get the full benefits but I&rsquo;m I</p>
<p>like that more but I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>all these other kind of things that you</p>
<p>can do to um stimulate stem cells or</p>
<p>products and things I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>those work I haven&rsquo;t I haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>enough data to tell you yes or no all</p>
<p>right very good uh Sharon wants to know</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s on YouTube is there any downside</p>
<p>to taking</p>
<p>berberine yes you&rsquo;re going to create a</p>
<p>severe dip in the sale of metformin</p>
<p>because um berberine actually is almost</p>
<p>comparable with a lot of the results to</p>
<p>metformin but without the toxic effects</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some research on that uh you can</p>
<p>look it up yourself but um berberine is</p>
<p>quite quite amazing with what it can do</p>
<p>not just for your blood sugars and</p>
<p>insulin resistance but many other other</p>
<p>conditions as well but</p>
<p>um I like I like that compound a lot so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say very</p>
<p>good okay Goa is the handle this person</p>
<p>is using from YouTube I have completed</p>
<p>65 days on the keto diet subsisting</p>
<p>primarily on eggs and now my skin has</p>
<p>turned very pale please share your</p>
<p>advice I don&rsquo;t want to give up my keto</p>
<p>dieting well um I just don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>else you&rsquo;re eating um you may want to</p>
<p>switch it up</p>
<p>to red meat which by the way has um even</p>
<p>more protein better sorts of iron things</p>
<p>like that I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re anemic</p>
<p>for I don&rsquo;t know what else you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>so are you having large vegetables are</p>
<p>you eating enough other oils omega-3 F</p>
<p>oils so uh</p>
<p>unfortunately um the eggs unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting it from a farmers market and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pasture raised organic which then</p>
<p>will give you like 180 ft of space but</p>
<p>even then a lot of the farmers will feed</p>
<p>the egg uh chickens some grains but you</p>
<p>really want that chicken to be able to</p>
<p>have the ability to go out and eat worms</p>
<p>and bugs and and insects things like</p>
<p>that which</p>
<p>um which will make a big difference um</p>
<p>so really depends on what else you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating and um and how much sun you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting and things like that so I I need</p>
<p>more information to really evaluate that</p>
<p>question all right well that makes sense</p>
<p>so mix it up on a healthy keto diet JJ</p>
<p>from from Facebook how can someone</p>
<p>eradicate candida from the</p>
<p>gut normally in your gut you have</p>
<p>different strains of friendly candida</p>
<p>yes friendly candida and it doesn&rsquo;t harm</p>
<p>you it actually helps you even in kefir</p>
<p>you have friendly candida that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not until you kill off your</p>
<p>bacteria that then you have this</p>
<p>overgrowth of this pathogenic candida so</p>
<p>the way that you fix and overgrowth is</p>
<p>by adding in more</p>
<p>probiotics from</p>
<p>kefir and uh and a probiotics itself</p>
<p>like from you can just as a supplement</p>
<p>or even um</p>
<p>sauerkraut um and then cut out all the</p>
<p>sugar because that uh fungus or C or um</p>
<p>candida lives on sugar and if you starve</p>
<p>it by going on keto then you will um get</p>
<p>rid of it so just don&rsquo;t feed it anymore</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll make you it&rsquo;ll make you want</p>
<p>sugar and sweets huh especially uh like</p>
<p>milk sugars especially all right well</p>
<p>Miriam from YouTube&rsquo;s been very patient</p>
<p>I saw her question some time ago and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be our final one for the</p>
<p>day please help me address the issue of</p>
<p>alpia thank you says</p>
<p>Miriam</p>
<p>um Believe It or Not biotin can help</p>
<p>with that as well and so can</p>
<p>zinc um zinc and biotin are two good</p>
<p>ones and of course you&rsquo;d want to have</p>
<p>get on a healthy diet as well but it is</p>
<p>an autoimmune condition so you may need</p>
<p>more vitamin</p>
<p>D3 to uh help yourself with that but um</p>
<p>the other point I would look at is uh if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through chronic stress that</p>
<p>has been known to stimulate and Trigger</p>
<p>autoimmune problems so you want to be</p>
<p>careful of that or not be careful of it</p>
<p>but just do whatever you can to get rid</p>
<p>of whatever is stressing you out put</p>
<p>more attention on</p>
<p>that there it is on that note thank you</p>
<p>so much for staying in this long and</p>
<p>watching these videos I really</p>
<p>appreciate your questions stay tuned for</p>
<p>more good videos coming up this next</p>
<p>week have a wonderful</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>weekend</p>
