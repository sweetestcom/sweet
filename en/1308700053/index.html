    <p>Our card this week is Willie Troy Price Sr., the King of Diamonds from South Carolina.</p>
<p>You may have already looked at your feed and noticed, but today I&rsquo;m dropping two episodes</p>
<p>instead of just one.</p>
<p>The stories that you&rsquo;ll hear aren&rsquo;t connected, but they do have something in common.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both being investigated as possible cases of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>Cases like these are hard to tell because oftentimes there&rsquo;s just not a lot to the</p>
<p>investigation once police realize that the victim wasn&rsquo;t who the killer thought they</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>But these victims still deserve to have their stories told.</p>
<p>So right now I&rsquo;m going to tell you about Willie Troy Price Sr., a 53-year-old South</p>
<p>Carolina man who was minding his own business inside his home one winter evening in 2017</p>
<p>when suddenly a group of cowards shot into the house and then fled without a trace.</p>
<p>Willie&rsquo;s senseless death has puzzled investigators for five years as they&rsquo;ve struggled to find</p>
<p>anyone who might have had it out for him, leaving them with one nagging question.</p>
<p>Was Willie even the intended target?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was around 10.45 p.m. on January 18, 2017, and a woman who we&rsquo;ll call Denise was in</p>
<p>her home on Plainview Road in Anderson County, South Carolina, winding down for the evening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when she was startled by several loud bangs.</p>
<p>They sounded like gunshots.</p>
<p>At first, it was just two gunshots, then a series of eight or nine rapid fire shots</p>
<p>after that.</p>
<p>Now, Denise wasn&rsquo;t immediately alarmed because it just sounded like her neighbor a few houses</p>
<p>down doing some target practice in his yard, as he often did.</p>
<p>But Denise wanted to be sure, so she went outside just to double check.</p>
<p>When she stepped out the door, she immediately knew something was off.</p>
<p>She saw a car speeding away from where she heard the shots, booking it to the main road</p>
<p>without its lights on.</p>
<p>Moments later, her heart sank even further.</p>
<p>Her neighbor&rsquo;s stepson, Roy Jones, came barreling out of the house across the street, frantically</p>
<p>yelling, Pops has been hit.</p>
<p>Pops was a nickname for her 53-year-old disabled neighbor, Willie Troy Price Sr.</p>
<p>Denise wasted no time.</p>
<p>She ran inside Willie&rsquo;s house, and she saw a scene that she&rsquo;d never be able to forget.</p>
<p>Sprawled out on the floor of the living room in a pool of blood was Willie.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been shot at least once in his stomach.</p>
<p>Denise immediately called 911, and the dispatcher instructed her to hold pressure on the wound</p>
<p>until first responders arrived.</p>
<p>When medics got there moments later, they found Willie unresponsive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d actually been hit twice.</p>
<p>He was rushed to a nearby medical center, where they attempted to resuscitate him.</p>
<p>But after 20-some minutes, it became clear that their efforts were useless.</p>
<p>At midnight, Willie was officially declared dead.</p>
<p>Detectives with the Anderson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office roped off the property to begin their</p>
<p>investigation.</p>
<p>And a few detectives took Denise and Roy aside to get their stories of what happened.</p>
<p>Still in shock, Roy did his best to recount the evening to investigators.</p>
<p>He said he spent most of the night visiting with Willie, whom he referred to as his stepfather.</p>
<p>And that title was only honorary, because Willie was never actually married to Roy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>But Willie had dated Roy&rsquo;s mom and had a big hand in raising him, so Roy always called</p>
<p>him his stepdad.</p>
<p>Anyway, Roy told police that while he was hanging out at Willie&rsquo;s place, he needed</p>
<p>to use the restroom.</p>
<p>For some reason, the water at Willie&rsquo;s was temporarily turned off, so Roy knew that he</p>
<p>needed to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>His mother lived just a few houses down in the same neighborhood, so that&rsquo;s where he</p>
<p>went.</p>
<p>Roy had seen Willie chatting with an older woman sitting in her car just outside the</p>
<p>house, so he asked her to give him a ride to keep from walking all that way.</p>
<p>She agreed and then drove him back to Willie&rsquo;s place when he was done.</p>
<p>Then, just as the woman dropped Roy off in Willie&rsquo;s driveway and began to leave, Roy</p>
<p>heard gunshots.</p>
<p>He ran inside Willie&rsquo;s house and hid in a hallway until the gunfire stopped.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he walked into the living room and found Willie.</p>
<p>In a panic, he booked it outside to find anyone who could help.</p>
<p>He saw Denise and asked her to call the police.</p>
<p>Roy told investigators he didn&rsquo;t see any cars near Willie&rsquo;s place during the shooting,</p>
<p>and he thought the gunfire was coming from outside by like this wood line kind of in</p>
<p>front of the house.</p>
<p>And more importantly, he couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason anyone would want to hurt Willie.</p>
<p>Willie was retired and had paraplegia.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t seem to have an enemy in the world.</p>
<p>Everyone in the community called him Pops, and he was like the unofficial neighborhood</p>
<p>handyman.</p>
<p>Roy also told investigators that he himself didn&rsquo;t have any ongoing issues or arguments</p>
<p>with anyone, so he didn&rsquo;t think that the attack was aimed at him either.</p>
<p>So after talking with Roy, detectives interviewed Denise.</p>
<p>She told them about hearing the gunshots, thinking it was the neighbor, going outside,</p>
<p>seeing the car speeding away, and then finding Willie.</p>
<p>She was distraught about everything.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;d lived across the street from Willie for the past four years, and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>become more than a neighbor.</p>
<p>They had grown to be good friends.</p>
<p>But when investigators heard her story, they were interested in that neighbor that she</p>
<p>said often did target practice in his yard.</p>
<p>But the thing is, Denise said that this guy was a responsible gun owner, and she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that he was involved in any way.</p>
<p>Besides, he drove a red pickup truck, and his wife drove a silver SUV, neither of which</p>
<p>were the car that she saw speeding away from Willie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Though she didn&rsquo;t get a great look at the car, and she couldn&rsquo;t offer much of a description,</p>
<p>but she did say it was small, like too small to be a truck or SUV.</p>
<p>Now Denise also told investigators that this wasn&rsquo;t the first time there&rsquo;d been a shooting</p>
<p>in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>She said that six or seven months prior, someone had shot up a vacant house on the corner near</p>
<p>her home.</p>
<p>But investigators were already very aware of some of the issues this neighborhood faced.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Sheila Cole with the Anderson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office was quoted in the Greenville</p>
<p>News saying that the road is, quote, known by people in our criminal investigations division</p>
<p>for its varied criminal activity, end quote.</p>
<p>But as far as investigators knew, Willie wasn&rsquo;t involved in any of that criminal activity.</p>
<p>I mean, according to an article from Independent Mail, he pled guilty to some drug and solicitation</p>
<p>charges more than a decade ago, but there was nothing on his record recently.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what was stumping investigators.</p>
<p>Who would have wanted to hurt a kind, disabled man who, by all accounts, hadn&rsquo;t an enemy</p>
<p>in the world?</p>
<p>Crime scene technicians tried to see if they could answer that question by scouring Willie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and property.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Sergeant Kendall Cash with the Anderson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>We held that scene for at least 24 hours and that doesn&rsquo;t happen that often where you</p>
<p>hold a scene for so long just to search it.</p>
<p>And the reason we held that for so long was because we were doing, it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>grid search.</p>
<p>You just kind of walk a line in a field and you&rsquo;re looking for shell casings or anything</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>And it was shocking because there was quite a few shell casings and you would not think</p>
<p>that this old paraplegic man would have at least one, maybe two people that would just</p>
<p>unload a barrage of ammunition at a house that had somebody like that in it without</p>
<p>having really pissed them off.</p>
<p>As investigators were carefully searching every square inch of Willie&rsquo;s property, other</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives were processing the scene of another shooting six miles away</p>
<p>that happened literally mere minutes before the shooting that killed Willie.</p>
<p>The Anderson Independent Mail reported that a 34-year-old man was shot on Leon Drive and</p>
<p>was taken to a nearby hospital with critical wounds.</p>
<p>Since the two shootings happened a few miles apart and, again, within minutes of each other,</p>
<p>officers thought that they might be related and possibly related to drugs somehow.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just a theory, but something investigators kept in mind as they worked</p>
<p>both cases.</p>
<p>Back in Willie&rsquo;s neighborhood, officers were canvassing the area asking around to see if</p>
<p>anybody besides Denise and Roy saw anything suspicious.</p>
<p>And actually, a few people had.</p>
<p>A woman who lived a few houses down the street who we&rsquo;re going to call Sonia said that she</p>
<p>heard the gunshots.</p>
<p>But just like Denise, when she first heard them, she wasn&rsquo;t immediately frightened because</p>
<p>her neighbor often shot off his gun at weird times.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not clear if this is the same neighbor that Denise mentioned to police, but if it</p>
<p>was, Sonia painted him as a little less responsible than Denise did by mentioning that he usually</p>
<p>would do this when he was drunk.</p>
<p>When she would hear him doing that, she&rsquo;d storm outside to yell at him to quit.</p>
<p>So when she heard the gunfire, she walked outside to tell her neighbor to cut it out,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Instead, she noticed a van type vehicle leaving from Willie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>It was boxy and maybe silver and like low to the ground, lower than an SUV would normally</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>She thought it was probably an older model because it didn&rsquo;t reflect light very well.</p>
<p>Sonia then heard Roy call for help and she noticed that Denise was going over to Willie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to do just that.</p>
<p>Sonia then told police something that probably further confirmed their working theory.</p>
<p>She said that she saw people coming and going from Willie&rsquo;s house all the time, and she</p>
<p>indicated that she thought some of his visitors were there for drugs.</p>
<p>Now she admitted that she didn&rsquo;t know for sure that that&rsquo;s what was going on, but she</p>
<p>just got the feeling.</p>
<p>So she actively tried not to look out the window in that direction because she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to see a drug deal go down.</p>
<p>But Sonia wasn&rsquo;t the only person in the neighborhood to see something suspicious the night that</p>
<p>Willie was killed.</p>
<p>A woman who lived around the corner heard the round of gunshots and went outside to</p>
<p>investigate, and when she stepped outside, she noticed that her dogs were barking at</p>
<p>something near a tree stump in the backyard.</p>
<p>She thought that might be significant because in the past, when people committed crimes</p>
<p>in the area, they&rsquo;d use her backyard as kind of a shortcut to get to and from the</p>
<p>road that Willie lived on.</p>
<p>But maybe of more importance was a car that she noticed parked nearby when she walked</p>
<p>outside.</p>
<p>It was at the abandoned blue house on the corner.</p>
<p>It was a white car, and it was the first time that she&rsquo;d ever seen it.</p>
<p>And actually, the car was still there when she was talking to detectives, so she pointed</p>
<p>it out to them.</p>
<p>They thought the car looked abandoned.</p>
<p>One of the detectives noted that it had a donut-type spare tire on it.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s unclear if investigators actually followed up on the white car lead, but it</p>
<p>seems like they felt that it wasn&rsquo;t related to Willie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Now later in the day, investigators learned about an attempted murder earlier that morning</p>
<p>in the same city, and it was possibly connected to Willie&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>At around 9.30 that morning in Anderson, a man was walking back to his apartment from</p>
<p>the nearby Little General, and as he approached his complex, he noticed an older tan model</p>
<p>Chevy car approaching.</p>
<p>The car stopped, and the two men got out and grabbed a white trash bag out of the car,</p>
<p>but it looked like the trash bag had a rifle inside.</p>
<p>The man said he heard a gunshot, and as he was trying to figure out what these guys were</p>
<p>shooting at, he heard another shot, then felt a sharp pain in his foot.</p>
<p>He took off running and managed to escape any further gunfire.</p>
<p>Now I have no idea why investigators thought Willie&rsquo;s case was connected to that attempted</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just close enough in location, and again, time-wise, they thought that there</p>
<p>was a connection that was maybe possible, or maybe they were just grasping at straws.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the chances of either of the possibly connected attempted murders being</p>
<p>solved anytime soon weren&rsquo;t looking good, so for now, they were just empty theories.</p>
<p>As the days passed by, investigators started considering the possibility that maybe Willie</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the intended target.</p>
<p>Not only could they not find anyone who had an ax to grind with Willie, but police knew</p>
<p>of someone who lived a high-risk lifestyle, who frequented the area, who they were beginning</p>
<p>to think was the intended target.</p>
<p>Detective Cash didn&rsquo;t want to get into that part of the investigation or identify the</p>
<p>individual on record, but he said it&rsquo;s the theory he&rsquo;s most confident in today.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a bit of a tangled web, and any information he gave away about that thread</p>
<p>of the case could jeopardize the entire investigation.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Even though they have this new lead, and they&rsquo;re following it, Willie&rsquo;s case remains at a</p>
<p>standstill.</p>
<p>As far as those other attempted murders go, they&rsquo;re still unsolved, too, so it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>Once you have run out of every lead that you can imagine, you just cannot do anything else.</p>
<p>For five years, whoever killed Willie has gotten away with it, and if the people who</p>
<p>know what happened don&rsquo;t speak up, those cowards may never be caught.</p>
<p>So please, if you have any information about Willie&rsquo;s murder in 2017, now is the time to</p>
<p>break your silence.</p>
<p>Call Sergeant Kendall Cash at the Anderson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 864-231-2809.</p>
<p>Or you can call the Detective Bureau line at 864-260-4435.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the second episode that we dropped today.</p>
