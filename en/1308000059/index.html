    <p>Actually, the funny story from Art Basel, so I was hanging with J. Cal, and we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to Beeple.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And for some reason, J. Cal was being nice to me, and he said to Beeple, he said, you</p>
<p>know who this guy is?</p>
<p>This guy is a legend in Silicon Valley, and he introduces me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I said to Jason, I&rsquo;m like, you know, this is Beeple, and he who just sold like</p>
<p>$260 million, like NFTs, I&rsquo;m like, this guy&rsquo;s a legend, too.</p>
<p>And without missing a beat, J. Cal says, well, maybe for the next year.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, welcome to Episode 58 of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have been watching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drinking, boys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drinking.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s Friday.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re filming late on a Friday.</p>
<p>You can tell from the backyard behind Chamath that it&rsquo;s the evening, and he&rsquo;s cracked open</p>
<p>a little something, something.</p>
<p>A little, little, little delishy poops.</p>
<p>Oh, Bond.</p>
<p>2002, St. Eden.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a label of Bond, correct?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Bond, St. Eden, 2002.</p>
<p>Oh, very nice.</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite.</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be right over.</p>
<p>Episode 58, last week, Episode 57 peaked at number 40 episodes in the world.</p>
<p>So thank you to the fans.</p>
<p>We broke 125,000 subscribers on YouTube and the pods over there are getting 150,000 views.</p>
<p>So thank just thank you to the fans, a lot of questions about the All In Summit, I went</p>
<p>to see the locations when I was in Miami.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the location we want, we&rsquo;re working on dates, and you&rsquo;ll have more information</p>
<p>soon about that.</p>
<p>So welcome back to the program with us today, as always, is the Sultan of Science, the Queen</p>
<p>of Quinoa himself, David Friedberg, the Rain Man, yeah, he&rsquo;s definitely back from Art Basel,</p>
<p>of course, he went to Art Basel, and I don&rsquo;t know if he bought any art, but I was on his</p>
<p>boat with him, or his rented boat, David Sachs and I were on a boat.</p>
<p>Ooh, a rented boat.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he hasn&rsquo;t bought one yet, but I think he&rsquo;s moving there.</p>
<p>And then of course, the dictator himself, Chamali Palihapitiya here, Chamali, with</p>
<p>an obnoxiously expensive sweater.</p>
<p>Tell us about that.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Can I?</p>
<p>Everybody wants to know what animal was killed to make that garment.</p>
<p>What animal was killed for that horrible Ernie sweater?</p>
<p>This is a collection of the foreskins of some white tigers.</p>
<p>Oh no, no, I&rsquo;m out, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I mean, it is incredibly soft and smooth.</p>
<p>I literally got a complaint.</p>
<p>Like foreskins are.</p>
<p>Oh God, I guess we&rsquo;re really going in a bad direction, right?</p>
<p>Freeberg and Sachs are like, what are they talking about?</p>
<p>I literally got a complaint on DM about Chamath&rsquo;s conspicuous consumption of his sweaters.</p>
<p>And she was like, listen, I don&rsquo;t mean to tell you your business, but I think Chamath</p>
<p>is turning off the audience with these sweaters.</p>
<p>Was it an angry mid-level white?</p>
<p>It was a white, but extremely successful one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>They were just concerned.</p>
<p>I think that every week.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>We have to go through Chamath&rsquo;s sweater.</p>
<p>Does she pay?</p>
<p>Does she pay attention when I put in $700 million a year into climate change?</p>
<p>How has she put in that much?</p>
<p>With her shitty sweaters?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listen, enough.</p>
<p>Give Chamath some more wine.</p>
<p>Give him some more wine.</p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
<p>Someone text Nash.</p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to start moral virtue signaling over here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, we got a lot to cover.</p>
<p>I mean, this is just absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>I want to finish a glass of wine real quick and then roll into the show.</p>
<p>This is going well so far.</p>
<p>I mean, this show is going to go off the rails.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already lost control of the show.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We got to start with inflation and the economy.</p>
<p>While Sax and I were in Miami for our bazaar, there was an absolute panic going on 2, 3</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>People checking their Robinhood and Coinbase accounts to figure out how much they had lost</p>
<p>in their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>But today-</p>
<p>I lost more in the Robinhood stock than I have in the Robinhood app.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too soon, bro.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too soon for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to distribute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, do I distribute now or wait for-</p>
<p>That thing has been a stone sinking to the floor of the ocean.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Never to be found.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, listen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s $15 billion, a pretty great valuation right now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an opportunity for people, but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not dispensing stock advice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not dispensing stock advice, but I&rsquo;m not selling any of my shares.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you right now.</p>
<p>Before I distribute my stock and mark my capital gains, I&rsquo;d like to advocate to people on Robinhood.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just ask you don&rsquo;t show up drunk for the next episode.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even get through the first story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>All right, this is a nice little thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Inflation rolled in.</p>
<p>Does this woman even own a cashmere sweater that she has to run &hellip;</p>
<p>Can we get off of, people &hellip;</p>
<p>Who is this person?</p>
<p>Freckles, it &hellip;</p>
<p>Fuck her!</p>
<p>Oh, please beep that out.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>God almighty.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What a fucking loser.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Sharath, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;re doing something with all those foreskins because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want them to go to waste.</p>
<p>God almighty.</p>
<p>What do they do with the foreskins?</p>
<p>All those circumcisions and &hellip;</p>
<p>I would love for you to just drive here and touch this sweater.</p>
<p>I mean, I love you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s &hellip;</p>
<p>You started with that bullshit statement by this person who better be good looking or</p>
<p>well dressed, but otherwise they have no right to make this claim.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Calm down, Chamath.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the show.</p>
<p>You insulted his sweater game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a definite no-no.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really &hellip; Now we know he&rsquo;s most sensitive.</p>
<p>Honestly, you might as well have called me a &hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, dude.</p>
<p>You might as well &hellip;</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a sweater comment.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a sweater assumption.</p>
<p>Is that what she&rsquo;s really trying to say?</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s trying to &hellip;</p>
<p>Are we going to be able to move off this compartment?</p>
<p>No, because you brought it up.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>Out her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cancel her.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to &hellip; Nobody&rsquo;s getting canceled for pointing out that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>$4,000 chinchilla sweaters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never said how much they cost.</p>
<p>We beeped it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never said how much this one costs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do you own a sweater worth more than $4,000 or not?</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to rest my case.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>
<p>I own many.</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>Guilty on all charges.</p>
<p>Consumption.</p>
<p>Consumption.</p>
<p>CPI, the past three months, today was 6.8 year over year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest increase since 1982.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting back to the post Jimmy Carter era, and when Reagan got in there and inherited</p>
<p>that mess, September was 5.4, October 6.2, November 6.8 points up, 0.6 or approximately</p>
<p>10% over October, 1.4% over September.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the chart for those of you watching on the YouTube channel.</p>
<p>This all started in March of 2021.</p>
<p>That was the first month where the CPI rose over 2%.</p>
<p>And who was wrong on inflation with the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell called a transitory</p>
<p>numerous times over the past two years, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in her Senate confirmation</p>
<p>hearing in December of 2020, Yellen said she believed the Fed and Biden admin could</p>
<p>take advantage of interest rates being near zero and spend more on stimulus.</p>
<p>Economist Paul Krugman thought it was transitory in his op ed how not to panic about inflation</p>
<p>that did not age well, quote, our business is actually starting to set prices and wages</p>
<p>based on the expectation of high future inflation.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t, and my bet is they won&rsquo;t be, then the lesson of 2010 to 2011 will remain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic.</p>
<p>My God, he could not have been more wrong.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s right on inflation?</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon in March, I would suspect there is a pretty good chance you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>rates going up and people are starting to worry about that.</p>
<p>The American public specifically Gen Z has been on top of this issue.</p>
<p>77% of Americans were either somewhere with somewhat were very concerned about inflation</p>
<p>back in March.</p>
<p>And Gen Z people aged 18 to 24 had the highest rate of very concerned about inflation at</p>
<p>52%.</p>
<p>Larry Summers also got this right.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on inflation, which now seems acute and permanent?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s definitely not transitory.</p>
<p>Remember when it was at about 5.1% over the summer that the administration said, no big</p>
<p>deal.</p>
<p>This is transitory.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic.</p>
<p>Then it went to 6.2.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 6.8.</p>
<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s headed to 7%.</p>
<p>And the real problem here is that these guys, the administration have not adjusted course</p>
<p>in light of this data.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ve tried to do instead is now speciously claim that the same bills that they had written</p>
<p>and conceived, the Build Back Better bill, somehow, even though it was conceived at a</p>
<p>time that was really deflationary, that somehow this is going to fight inflation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re essentially repurposing, they&rsquo;re just changing the arguments they&rsquo;re using as opposed</p>
<p>to changing their legislative priorities.</p>
<p>And just today, we got a report from CBO saying that this Build Back Better bill wasn&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to cost $2 trillion, like the administration said, it&rsquo;s going to cost $5 trillion and add</p>
<p>$3 trillion to the deficit.</p>
<p>Over 10 years, correct?</p>
<p>Over 10 years, if those programs are not sunsetted.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of budgetary gimmicks that were put in the bill.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot of the programs would sunset after one year or three years or six years.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the only way they&rsquo;ve gotten it to this $1.9 trillion price tag.</p>
<p>The reason why that&rsquo;s a gimmick is because once the programs are created, it will create</p>
<p>a special interest or constituency who is now dependent on those programs and no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever going to want to cut them.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman famously said that there&rsquo;s nothing quite so permanent as a temporary</p>
<p>government program.</p>
<p>So that is the game that progressives are playing, is they&rsquo;re going to create the dependency,</p>
<p>the constituency who, once they receive the program, is never going to want to give it</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re counting on the fact that these programs will not sunset, which means they</p>
<p>will cost $5 trillion, and it will add $3 trillion to the deficit.</p>
<p>So the problem is, it&rsquo;d be one thing if we were in a deflationary environment, if the</p>
<p>economy was in the tank, but these guys are continuing to pump more and more stimulus</p>
<p>into an economy that has enough.</p>
<p>And really, Larry Summers made this point all the way back in February.</p>
<p>I think this is worth reading what he said.</p>
<p>He said, there&rsquo;s a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II</p>
<p>levels than normal recession levels were set off inflationary pressures of a kind</p>
<p>we have not seen in a generation.</p>
<p>He said this in February.</p>
<p>Everyone in the administration dismissed him.</p>
<p>All the liberal economists that you mentioned basically derided him.</p>
<p>He turned out to be exactly right.</p>
<p>And he was just saying this about the roughly $2 trillion they passed back in February for</p>
<p>COVID stimulus.</p>
<p>And since then, they passed $1.2 trillion for infrastructure.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s this another $5 trillion for build back better.</p>
<p>So the real problem here is that they are not adjusting course in light of this data</p>
<p>that keeps coming out that inflation is a bigger and bigger problem.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the right thing to do in your mind, Sax?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll go to you, Chet.</p>
<p>Elon said it.</p>
<p>Can this bill?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>This is not what Biden was elected to do.</p>
<p>He was elected to provide normalcy, stop the chaos, and he never got a mandate for this</p>
<p>kind of, you know, whatever, $10 trillion of tax and spend.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been wanting to do an infrastructure bill for a long time, but we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That was prior to pumping so much stimulus into the system.</p>
<p>If he had just done the infrastructure bill and not the build back better, it would have</p>
<p>been one thing.</p>
<p>But this is basically the third hyper stimulatory bill that they&rsquo;ve sought to pass.</p>
<p>First they did the COVID release bill at a time when really the economy didn&rsquo;t need that</p>
<p>stimulus.</p>
<p>And just dovetailing this, and Chamath involved in this, is the jobs report.</p>
<p>November nonfarm payrolls increased only 210, they expected it to be 573, so it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>miss.</p>
<p>However, kind of a miss bag, because there&rsquo;s over 11 million job openings.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now at 4.2% unemployment rate, which is the lowest, which is getting towards the</p>
<p>pandemic lows.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is like before the 2008 financial crisis, Chamath, how do you reconcile</p>
<p>inflation, along with this crazy, bizarre job situation where people will not go back</p>
<p>to work, people are planning on resigning, there continues to be resignations, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too many job openings, and people are raising salaries and still can&rsquo;t hire people?</p>
<p>Well, I think we did a pretty good job of unpacking the great resignation.</p>
<p>I think it was last pod.</p>
<p>So right.</p>
<p>Remember, like, yeah, there are three structural issues at play in the jobs front.</p>
<p>One is that you have this really meaningful under immigration that&rsquo;s happened because</p>
<p>of Trump.</p>
<p>The second was you&rsquo;ve had a big mismatch between the degreed classes in America and the jobs</p>
<p>that they can have for what they think they should earn, meaning you go to school, you</p>
<p>get into all this debt, you try to become a teacher or something, and then you realize</p>
<p>you can make more at an Amazon warehouse, crazy, strange.</p>
<p>And then the fourth is you have all these boomers with an enormous amount of savings</p>
<p>30, 40, $50 trillion, who are pulling forward their retirement and also subsidizing their</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>You put it all together, there&rsquo;s less of an incentive to be in the job force unless you</p>
<p>pay higher wages.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s just put a pin in that for a second.</p>
<p>I think the thing that Saks talked about is really important, which is that we have to</p>
<p>really figure out whether inflation is transitory, or it&rsquo;s persistent, and it&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>And I just want to bring up all of Nick, I&rsquo;ll send you these texts, these the Twitter links</p>
<p>to this, but Bill Ackman tweeted out these two things today, which is that if you fan</p>
<p>of the pod, brilliant investor, by the way, great human being, brilliant investor, two</p>
<p>very specific things, he actually called out something that we&rsquo;ve we also mentioned before,</p>
<p>which is that CPI is horribly calculated, and it&rsquo;s really imprecise.</p>
<p>And if you unpack CPI, there&rsquo;s something price index, the consumer price index, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in there, a component of it, that&rsquo;s very important, which is called the owner&rsquo;s equivalent</p>
<p>rent, right?</p>
<p>How much can somebody basically charge rent to other people?</p>
<p>The way that they calculate that, which is 30% of the 30% of the calculation is they</p>
<p>just survey a handful of people.</p>
<p>The problem is you don&rsquo;t need to survey because the actual exact data is available from single</p>
<p>family rentals that report this number.</p>
<p>So their survey showed basically a much, much smaller increase than what the actual increases.</p>
<p>And let me just give it so the largest owners of nationwide single family rentals are reporting</p>
<p>a 17% year over year rent increase.</p>
<p>Wow, the the OER that was calculated, quote unquote, by survey and the CPI was 3.5%.</p>
<p>If you flow that through, it means that core CPI actually went from 4.9% today to actually</p>
<p>9%.</p>
<p>And the CPI print, which was 6.8% was actually 10.1%.</p>
<p>So it just goes to show you we have sources of data that the government is not in a position</p>
<p>to collect or measure.</p>
<p>We have horribly inaccurate econometric models that we use, you know, you know, that phrase</p>
<p>sort of shit in shit out.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, you get very bad garbage.</p>
<p>You get very bad crappy data.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re printing numbers, we&rsquo;re supposed to make policy against those</p>
<p>numbers.</p>
<p>But the numbers that underlie this decision making is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s flawed in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s bring Friedberg in Friedberg, what do you think is happening here vis a</p>
<p>vis also the creation of companies and entrepreneurship, because one of the weird things that&rsquo;s occurring</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re starting to hit a record number of LLCs S corp C corps being created.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of people are becoming freelance nation, hundreds of 1000s of new</p>
<p>companies during the pandemic were started.</p>
<p>That is probably one of many places where the water is flowing when you fill my cup</p>
<p>and it shall overflow with.</p>
<p>I was talking to a guy this week, who was not the one down, no, no, let him drink the</p>
<p>wine.</p>
<p>Um, and fast.</p>
<p>This guy has a multi billion dollar consumer credit portfolio and subprime, which means</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s got the a bunch of consumers owe him money, that generally there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be a high default rate.</p>
<p>And no comment.</p>
<p>And he said that this year, the portfolio performed beyond like the one percentile of</p>
<p>the model distribution of what they expected to happen.</p>
<p>They had the yield on the portfolio be 40% higher than they thought it would be.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much liquidity in the hands of individuals.</p>
<p>And so I think, you know, Jason, while you might make the argument that companies and</p>
<p>jobs are being created, that is one of many places where like, you know, you overflow</p>
<p>a river and lots of streams start to flow.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re seeing asset bubbles everywhere, in NFTs, in crypto, in startups, in new startups,</p>
<p>in new ideas, in home prices, in every sneakers.</p>
<p>Now the problem with inflation is, you know, it&rsquo;s a definition that we all use this term</p>
<p>and we throw it about but like inflation is really the measure of price going up over</p>
<p>a period of time.</p>
<p>And generally, you want to have inflation of some amount that allows you to see economic</p>
<p>growth and expansion that allows you to fund the debt that you used to create that growth</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>And so without some sort of an inflationary pressure, which is the output of economic</p>
<p>growth, you end up, you know, being unable to meet your debt obligations, and then things</p>
<p>get really ugly and the system as it was constructed because most of these governments and systems</p>
<p>like we have today are funded by debt.</p>
<p>So, you know, Stan Druckenmiller gave a good interview on Q2, he was kind of on a roadshow,</p>
<p>you know, sounding the alarm bells around what was going on, he was saying the market</p>
<p>is not speaking right now, because basically, the Fed kept canceling the market signals</p>
<p>with their interest rate policy.</p>
<p>And by canceling those market signals, it seemed like we had a free for all at the government</p>
<p>level to keep spending.</p>
<p>And so I do think that these two are pretty interrelated.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;ve kept interest rates low, have allowed policymakers to say, you know</p>
<p>what, the cost of debt for this government is zero, we can do anything we want, just</p>
<p>like consumers are saying, we can do anything we want, we can buy anything we want, we can</p>
<p>spend any way we want.</p>
<p>And as a result, we&rsquo;re kind of seeing this, you know, inflationary pressure persist.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is, if you then raise rates, and you can&rsquo;t borrow that money, and suddenly</p>
<p>people have to start to pay that debt down, without economic growth having occurred, the</p>
<p>business goes, the whole system goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>So the challenge that the Fed has, is how do we raise rates without triggering an economic</p>
<p>recession?</p>
<p>And if people are now have overspended and are over levered, once again, and rates go</p>
<p>up, it&rsquo;s going to get really ugly really fast.</p>
<p>And so this is a first derivative balancing act.</p>
<p>And yeah, there&rsquo;s no simple and easy solution, unfortunately, meanwhile, technology is causing</p>
<p>deflationary pressures, which is exactly, you know, maybe what you don&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>happen when you&rsquo;re trying to realize economic growth.</p>
<p>The other thing that we talked about is that the Fed basically changed the, or the government</p>
<p>changed the rules on the percentage, basically, what qualifies as a conforming mortgage.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>And so now that&rsquo;s basically at a million dollars.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, most Americans, you know, 80 to 90% of their true underlying</p>
<p>wealth is their home, to the extent that they built, you know, a positive net worth.</p>
<p>And if you all of a sudden, you know, push up the upper bound on what a conforming mortgages</p>
<p>to a million dollars, that effectively means it&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s roughly about 20%.</p>
<p>That effectively means that you&rsquo;re moving people&rsquo;s net worth up by about four or 5%.</p>
<p>And so if they take that, and then they take that money out of their home via a HELOC or</p>
<p>an equity line of credit, right, home equity line of credit.</p>
<p>And then, you know, to your point, Friedberg, they spend it, or they invest it, or they,</p>
<p>you know, it could be a real disaster scenario in five or six years time.</p>
<p>No, no, this is more like 1929 kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, if you go back to the, remember when we were in like the depths of the market</p>
<p>collapsing and everything, when basically the economy shut down with lockdowns when</p>
<p>COVID started.</p>
<p>And I was speaking to a senior banker at that, like that day.</p>
<p>And he told me, look, it&rsquo;s pretty simple what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>The Fed&rsquo;s going to drop interest rates to zero, and they&rsquo;re going to pump money into</p>
<p>the system.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re going to be able to keep asset prices from collapsing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to artificially inflate asset prices.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to do it for a long time.</p>
<p>Because then people look at the stock market and they say, oh my gosh, stocks are going</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, revenue is going up.</p>
<p>Everything gets inflated by pumping money into the system.</p>
<p>And the problem is, while there&rsquo;s, you know, a perceived, you keep saying the home price</p>
<p>goes up, and I keep saying stocks go up.</p>
<p>But the purchasing power that arises when the inflation is higher than what those things</p>
<p>are going up at indicates economic recession underlying that inflationary bubble.</p>
<p>And the circumstance needs to be analyzed, unfortunately, a little bit more deeper than</p>
<p>that, which is it&rsquo;s not just about inflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about have we pumped enough money into trigger economic growth, that we can come</p>
<p>to balance where the growth can outpace the inflation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>Well, superimposed on this,</p>
<p>I think about it.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me just say, let me just say one simple analogy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ve got 50 clams.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s suddenly a bunch of clams come into the clam market.</p>
<p>Now I got 100 clams.</p>
<p>And if the number of clams has gone up by 3x, my purchasing power is actually gone down</p>
<p>by a third.</p>
<p>While it might look like I&rsquo;ve now got twice as many clams, I can only buy one third as</p>
<p>much as I could buy before, because there&rsquo;s so many more clams floating around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I love clams.</p>
<p>You love clams.</p>
<p>Clams.</p>
<p>So you like I&rsquo;m just, all right, listen, I did a little bit of math.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the price to sales ratios of some of the top companies, we can pull</p>
<p>this up on the screen.</p>
<p>And the price to sales of companies, including zoom, obviously was ridiculous.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, that was a pandemic stock.</p>
<p>So on top of all of this money being printed into the system, you had the participation</p>
<p>of a bunch of stonk traders, you know, in that whole movement, buying up meme stocks</p>
<p>or others, we had the price sales ratio of zoom.</p>
<p>In other words, the value of the enterprise versus their actual sales was at 123.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now at 14.7 peloton was another one of those at 23.</p>
<p>Now down to 3x down 87% coinbase square also, it drops off pretty significantly here.</p>
<p>But you can also we looked at the peak price to sales and how much larger it is then and</p>
<p>so some of these are now off 8x 4x and then it drops off to 2x 1x.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys are looking at the numbers or if you have any thoughts on this,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re reap it seems like there was a mispricing of certain equities.</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors</p>
<p>to be out as long dated as possible in buying earnings.</p>
<p>Because if you have to remember, it&rsquo;s not just that real rates were effectively zero.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to own inflation protected securities, it was actually a negative yield.</p>
<p>So we were destroying people&rsquo;s savings.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of individuals, sorry, well, not individuals, institutions that must</p>
<p>own some of these inflation protected assets.</p>
<p>So we were already in a negative yield environment.</p>
<p>What are those folks supposed to do if they have to fund an 8% return a year to pay the</p>
<p>pensions of, you know, good people, firefighters, teachers, you know, it&rsquo;s you name it, policemen,</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>They were forced to invest in the kinds of funds that would then go out further and further</p>
<p>out into the future to buy the promise of future cash flows.</p>
<p>And when all of a sudden, a whole bunch of other assets that they held, which were supposed</p>
<p>to be safe implodes on them, right?</p>
<p>Because all of a sudden inflation changes and the front end of the yield curve goes</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, all these assets when yields go up, prices go down.</p>
<p>Now the fireman&rsquo;s pension is like, Oh my gosh, we just lost all this money, we never thought</p>
<p>we were going to lose.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re long all these, you know, crazy tech stocks.</p>
<p>And so then they&rsquo;re forced to sell so that their overall exposure goes down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called degrossing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been going through a very painful process of this degrossing hedge funds are</p>
<p>doing it in droves.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question that you&rsquo;re not sorry to interrupt, but should they not have looked</p>
<p>at these multiples and said, you know what, maybe this one&rsquo;s out of whack, and I should</p>
<p>buy the ones that are not as out of whack, because this is really not really because</p>
<p>the last 15 years, if you had, you know, the problem with being a value investor over the</p>
<p>last 15 years, since 2008, is you&rsquo;re basically a dumpster diver.</p>
<p>And you got paid absolutely, you know, you didn&rsquo;t make anything because, because they</p>
<p>misunderstood what value was value isn&rsquo;t necessarily things that are cheap value is</p>
<p>things that are things that are valuable.</p>
<p>And over the last 15 or 20 years, what was once a question is now definitive, which is</p>
<p>that the things that are valuable tend to be technological.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re super high margin, they grow really quickly, they compound, they create</p>
<p>enormous cash flows at scale.</p>
<p>So agree, the point is, you couldn&rsquo;t own that stuff.</p>
<p>And if you sat on the sidelines, you weren&rsquo;t meeting your 8% hurdle, you were all of a</p>
<p>sudden looking at some risk of defaulting on your pension obligations.</p>
<p>So this is how this whole cycle brought us to today is nowhere, what you&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>if I can summarize, there was nowhere else for them to put their money, sacks price matters,</p>
<p>though.</p>
<p>So is this just bad capital allocation, people weren&rsquo;t thinking about the entry price of</p>
<p>their investments?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re giving too much credit?</p>
<p>Well, I think I think what happened is that you had a liquidity fueled boom going on.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve seen over the past four or five weeks, about the first week in November, most</p>
<p>of the market basically peaked, and at least growth stocks did and SaaS companies did.</p>
<p>If you look kind of November 8, was sort of the beginning of the downturn.</p>
<p>And since then, most of these growth stocks are down about 30% plus crypto is down now.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sliding as we speak 30-40% off a peak around the same time.</p>
<p>What happened around the first week in November?</p>
<p>Well, you had three Fed governors come out and make very hawkish statements about the</p>
<p>fact that the Fed was going to need to double the speed of its taper, and that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have two or three rate increases next year.</p>
<p>And so basically, we went from being in a low interest rate environment, which has been</p>
<p>the case with not only just low interest rate environment, low interest rates with massive</p>
<p>stimulus and pumping out of Washington by both the Fed and by Congress, okay.</p>
<p>And so you went from that environment to all of a sudden an environment of now we&rsquo;re expecting</p>
<p>to have rate increases, and that&rsquo;s going to suck the liquidity out of the system.</p>
<p>The amazing thing that I&rsquo;m seeing right now is that every investor I know is having the</p>
<p>same conversation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re a SaaS investor, or a real estate investor, or a crypto investor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all having the same conversation, which is, what are interest rates going to</p>
<p>do?</p>
<p>How much liquidity is that going to suck out of the system?</p>
<p>And how much of the boom that we&rsquo;ve experienced over the last couple of years has been because</p>
<p>of this unnatural liquidity that&rsquo;s been pumped into the system.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve never seen it be the case that investors across every asset category are</p>
<p>having that macro conversation, as opposed to talking about like micro stuff, right?</p>
<p>The specific company, the earnings, the product, who they&rsquo;re beating, the market share.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s talking about that.</p>
<p>Like, what building do I buy?</p>
<p>Or what SaaS can I invest in?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about what is happening in the macro picture.</p>
<p>And this is where I think what Biden is doing is so unbelievably off base is, okay, look,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t start trillion dollar deficits.</p>
<p>You know, that happened in the previous president.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that was good.</p>
<p>But now what we have is a situation here of the Fed is getting extremely hawkish of tightening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing inflation now out of control.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s been no adjustment whatsoever on a policy basis.</p>
<p>Can we just say the ugly truth?</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s hitting the brakes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call a spade a spade at this point, because I think we can.</p>
<p>I think, and I think Biden was, is and will ever be a really moderate, down the middle</p>
<p>centrist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever been an extreme bone in that man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>He has always come off like, you know, the word that I think what I&rsquo;ve always thought</p>
<p>of Biden even now is equanimity.</p>
<p>The guy is a really down the middle person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not an extreme individual.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the only kind of personality, by the way, that could have thrived for eight</p>
<p>years as a VP with Obama and had been in every room in every meeting.</p>
<p>The problem sacks and tell me if you think this is totally off base is that there was</p>
<p>a head fake after he won the presidency, where there was this fake lurch to the progressive</p>
<p>left.</p>
<p>And it turned out that it was a complete head fake because that whole cohort of people just</p>
<p>totally jumped the shark.</p>
<p>Because all that rhetoric then unfortunately turned out to be not worth much, it started</p>
<p>to blow up in their face in every single election that&rsquo;s happened since then, at the</p>
<p>local level in cities at the state level in places like Virginia.</p>
<p>And in the middle of all of that, I actually think what happened was that faction tried</p>
<p>to push an extremely aggressive legislative agenda to paint Biden as an ex Roosevelt,</p>
<p>which maybe he didn&rsquo;t even have the desire to be because I think that he seems a very</p>
<p>low ego kind of person.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re actually realizing, oh, my gosh, this makes no sense.</p>
<p>And so the part of why I think the markets are kind of like hand wringing, is you would</p>
<p>expect at this point, the federal bureaucracy to actually step in.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s like a real lack of confidence.</p>
<p>Because for example, today, when there&rsquo;s a CPI print of somewhere between seven and 10%,</p>
<p>the only democratic sounding, you know, the talking point was one of the squad proposing</p>
<p>a four day work week.</p>
<p>I mean, right.</p>
<p>That is insane.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re in crazy debt.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, guys, we should spend more money and work less.</p>
<p>When the CBO says we&rsquo;re about to go three more trillion into debt.</p>
<p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to Fort well, it&rsquo;s, I actually think if you want to work, let&rsquo;s work less.</p>
<p>You know, maybe you&rsquo;re lucky and your boomer parents can give you money.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bunch of us like me who had to grind.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have anybody to fall back on.</p>
<p>And if you all of a sudden pass the law that said, Hey, Chamath, you can only work four</p>
<p>days a week, I would be really angry.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re depriving me of 20% more of a chance to beat all those other soft candy</p>
<p>asses that went to all those fancy schools that weren&rsquo;t willing to work.</p>
<p>Yeah, ignore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a stupid assignation me work.</p>
<p>So I think I think this this proposal that came out to basically, this was a new proposal</p>
<p>that they were going to limit the work week to four days a week, wouldn&rsquo;t let people work</p>
<p>five days a week.</p>
<p>And the reason why it&rsquo;s, well, it&rsquo;s a bad idea in general, but it&rsquo;s a particularly sort</p>
<p>of a brain dead idea to propose during a height, you&rsquo;d serve this inflationary period, because,</p>
<p>again, inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods.</p>
<p>Well, so that you have a demand component from the pumping and the stimulus, but you</p>
<p>also have the supply component, which is we don&rsquo;t have enough goods and services.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve been, you know, passing out these STEMI checks that disincentivize people</p>
<p>from working, we have problems with the ports.</p>
<p>We have these COVID restrictions have all gone restaurants are closing three days a</p>
<p>week because they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had a shortage.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had a shortage of goods and services.</p>
<p>The last thing we need is a 20% reduction in the number of work days and work hours</p>
<p>that are available.</p>
<p>So it just shows like how out of touch these progressives are.</p>
<p>But look to Chamath, to your point about Biden, I look, I don&rsquo;t know, you know, exactly what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in Biden&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>To me, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>I think I actually think he&rsquo;s pretty liberal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not all the way out to where, you know, AOC is fine.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>But look, at the end of the day, I think, you know, this idea of Biden being a moderate,</p>
<p>you know, the moderate is as moderate moderate does, he has not governed like a moderate,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s because, you know, this moderate thing was just a marketing shtick on his part,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s actually more liberal, or whether he&rsquo;s been co-opted and taken over by the progressives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care what the reason is.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, he is not governed like we pull back the spend, David, I mean,</p>
<p>we have not pulled back the spend.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no.</p>
<p>The original, remember, the original bill was going to be two or three times.</p>
<p>We just loaded the, we put the bullet in the chamber and loaded it for Manchin.</p>
<p>This bill is not going to happen, David, with a $3 trillion deficit increase.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>I mean, but the point is that, look, if people like us don&rsquo;t speak up and say, this is a</p>
<p>reckless, foolish, crazy, yes, exactly, then it can only fly the plane so fast before the</p>
<p>wings come off.</p>
<p>This is too much speed for the airframe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to a clip of our friend Elon talking about, let&rsquo;s go to this clip of Elon talking</p>
<p>about capital allocation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a couple of, it&rsquo;s like 30 seconds, and then Friedberg, I&rsquo;d like you to comment on</p>
<p>the other side.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>You know, at some point, really what you&rsquo;re doing is capital allocation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not money for personal expenditures, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing is capital</p>
<p>allocation.</p>
<p>And it does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who</p>
<p>have demonstrated great skill in capital allocation and give it to, you know, an entity</p>
<p>that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the government.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Friedberg, your thoughts on I&rsquo;ve said it in the past.</p>
<p>This is at a Wall Street Journal conference, by the way, you can think of a government</p>
<p>or a nonprofit or a corporation as an organism, as a living organism, and each living organism</p>
<p>wants to eat and grow.</p>
<p>And there is no such thing as an organism that says over time, I want to shrink and</p>
<p>shrivel away and die.</p>
<p>So the organizing principle of the people in the government is to do more for their</p>
<p>constituents, for their owners, which are what they believe to be the taxpayers or their,</p>
<p>you know, the folks that elected them to office.</p>
<p>The politicians themselves, I would argue, are more actors in the Ouija board of behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>And you know, less kind of, you know, the mental designer of a system that they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to use to infiltrate change in the world individually, and conquer and gain individual power.</p>
<p>There may be some degree of motivation there.</p>
<p>But I think largely, it&rsquo;s more about the fact that that organism, that government wants</p>
<p>to grow, wants to spend more, wants to do more over time, not less.</p>
<p>And this is true of any business.</p>
<p>Every business wants to grow.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not growing, you&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>And every nonprofit, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a nonprofit that says, let&rsquo;s not fundraise</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s spend all our money and then shut down.</p>
<p>And so, I just think like, you know, as much as we want to kind of sit here and rationalize</p>
<p>a way to better politicians that are going to better serve us, that are going to think</p>
<p>smarter, the reality is every government, every, you know, institution of government</p>
<p>in the history of humankind has tried to grow.</p>
<p>And eventually, they cycle back, you know, the United States, like I said, last year,</p>
<p>you know, maybe kind of going out with a little bit of a whimper, less of a bang.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to, you know, be a function of the devaluation of currency or, you know,</p>
<p>having less of a place in the global stage, and so on.</p>
<p>But I think Elon&rsquo;s right, like, you know, he feels and many people in business feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re in competition with the government for capital.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, the only difference is that the government can force that capital, can force that revenue,</p>
<p>and no business can.</p>
<p>And so, they&rsquo;ve got an unfair advantage in that stage of playing for capital.</p>
<p>And this is where, you know, Bitcoin feels to a lot of people like a great equalizer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a huge like, I&rsquo;m not a Bitcoin maximalist or anything.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s where the appeal arises, which is, you know, as Jefferson said, like</p>
<p>every generation needs a revolution.</p>
<p>And I think that this is the revolution that folks are looking for, which is how do we</p>
<p>get this big monopolistic player off the playing field to let us do what we want to do?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
<p>I mean, all Biden has to do is what he was elected to do.</p>
<p>He never had a mandate for this $10 trillion of spending.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy ran a basement campaign.</p>
<p>I mean, he was elected to not be Trump, okay?</p>
<p>He was elected to stop the chaos, not to engage this $10 trillion progressive agenda.</p>
<p>Elon, I think, made a really good point about the capital allocation there.</p>
<p>You know, people think, okay, Elon&rsquo;s got all this money, so he must be enjoying this like</p>
<p>incredible lifestyle.</p>
<p>Look, he&rsquo;s right that once you have that much money, you can&rsquo;t spend it all on personal</p>
<p>consumption.</p>
<p>You invest it.</p>
<p>And so the question is, who&rsquo;s going to make that investment?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to be better at it, Elon or the federal government?</p>
<p>We know Elon is better at it.</p>
<p>He creates incredible innovations.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to put people on Mars.</p>
<p>I mean, he can do incredible things with that capital.</p>
<p>A million electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Whereas the government just squanders it.</p>
<p>Elon had another really good&hellip;</p>
<p>I think Elon actually understands economics at a macro level really well.</p>
<p>He had a really good&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an equally good snippet of him on The Rogan Show called The Horn of Plenty where</p>
<p>he says, look, there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who think the economy is just like this</p>
<p>Horn of Plenty that produces all these goods and the goods just magically appear no matter</p>
<p>what we do, okay?</p>
<p>And so if some people have more goods than others, it&rsquo;s just because they stole them</p>
<p>from the Horn of Plenty.</p>
<p>What he said is, no, this is not the way the economy works.</p>
<p>People actually have to make the stuff.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t make the stuff, there is no stuff, okay?</p>
<p>The stuff doesn&rsquo;t just magically appear.</p>
<p>And the way the stuff gets made is you have people making smart capital allocation decisions</p>
<p>and engaging in hard work, and that&rsquo;s what actually produces the stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>So if you think about this agenda that we have in Washington, it really flips this on</p>
<p>its head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing everything it can to stop the production of the stuff, whether it&rsquo;s the stimmy checks</p>
<p>or the COVID lockdowns or&hellip;</p>
<p>Bonus unemployment, extending that, or just confiscating the earnings of people so that</p>
<p>they can spend it on whatever they want.</p>
<p>Wealth tax, whatever.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually putting constraints on the production on the supply of the stuff.</p>
<p>And then, meanwhile, it&rsquo;s just printing all this money.</p>
<p>So then we wonder, where does the inflation come from?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, it&rsquo;s coming from printing more money for fewer goods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the problem with the agenda we have in Washington right now.</p>
<p>The increase in the deficit is just getting stunning.</p>
<p>If you look back on the five or six last presidents, Reagan, 142% increase.</p>
<p>He got us up to 1.42 trillion.</p>
<p>He had to obviously combat what happened under Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>George Bush, George H.W. Bush, 36% increase.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton, a 1% decrease.</p>
<p>The first time we&rsquo;ve had a stimulus&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, a surplus in a long time.</p>
<p>And then Bush II, 57% increase.</p>
<p>The economic results under Bill Clinton were amazing.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I was just about to say, he&rsquo;s a goat.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, at the time, what was very interesting is politicians actually took this</p>
<p>issue of balancing the budget very seriously.</p>
<p>Really seriously.</p>
<p>Deadly seriously.</p>
<p>And thinking about how we would pay for things.</p>
<p>And now we don&rsquo;t seem to think about who is going to pay for these things.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which is going to screw our children.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have to remember that Bill Clinton was the president who said the era of big</p>
<p>government is over.</p>
<p>And when he left office, he actually bragged about reducing the federal government&rsquo;s share</p>
<p>of the economy from 22% to 18.5%.</p>
<p>You would never hear a Democratic president&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll never happen again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never hear a Democratic president&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, first of all, they wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But second, they wouldn&rsquo;t brag about it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even say something like that.</p>
<p>They would be ashamed at balancing the budget.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, do you think a Republican president would?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not convinced that any party matters at this point.</p>
<p>It feels to me like the incentive structure is such that the individuals who are representing</p>
<p>constituents, who get them elected, and they can pass more dollars back to those constituents,</p>
<p>drives a systemic model of growth for the government.</p>
<p>And therefore, the government is competing as a monopoly on the field for capital.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think you got a point.</p>
<p>You thought Trump was going to be this guy.</p>
<p>And Trump came in, and he ended up spending more.</p>
<p>And I recognize there were extenuating circumstances and so on.</p>
<p>But I thought he was going to go in.</p>
<p>I thought the premise was blow up the government, cut all this nonsense.</p>
<p>And the deficit kind of shot up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that Republicans have a very spotty record on government spending.</p>
<p>And we did have trillion dollar deficits pre-COVID under Trump.</p>
<p>And that was not good.</p>
<p>But what Biden is doing now in the face of inflation is worse.</p>
<p>And look, I mean, historically, the best, the only times that you really have,</p>
<p>it seems like fiscal responsibility is when you actually have the best track records have been</p>
<p>when you have Democratic presidents, Republican Congresses, and the Republicans suddenly find</p>
<p>their principles on spending.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a Democrat in the White House, you&rsquo;re right that when</p>
<p>Trump was in office and had Congress and George W. Bush had Congress,</p>
<p>the Republicans spent a lot of money too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely a bipartisan problem.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happening now in Washington is under Biden is unprecedented.</p>
<p>It is a breaking of the bank.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about minting trillion dollar coins.</p>
<p>So yes, it was a problem under Republicans, but this is even worse.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another thing is the Fed is now saying that they&rsquo;re projecting</p>
<p>two to three rate increases next year.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s call that 75 basis points.</p>
<p>Multiply that by the close to $30 trillion of government debt that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about $150 billion a year of interest payments on the debt of debt service.</p>
<p>Okay, $150 billion extra, extra, extra.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a fixed rate, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all short-term rates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all short-term rates because, yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at $150 billion of incremental debt service costs, right?</p>
<p>So multiply that over 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s $1.5 trillion over 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your Build Back Better right there.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s this money for Build Back Better going to come from?</p>
<p>Well, we have 1.5 trillion of increased interest rate costs starting next year.</p>
<p>And how do we get the cycle of people wanting to go back to work and be productive?</p>
<p>It feels to me like this could be wages, which is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But people are still not going back to work.</p>
<p>Have you been watching that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the people offering $70,000 to be a manager of a Taco Bell and people understand.</p>
<p>Well, then you offer 75,000.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t think they feel it.</p>
<p>No, I think that model is dead.</p>
<p>I think low-cost labor is inevitably the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, some low cost if they&rsquo;re making $75,000.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think in order for people to function, I don&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>
<p>It may still be labor, but it&rsquo;s high cost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Taco Bell is going to sell burritos if they cost $6.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re going to have to raise labor costs,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t going to be buying Taco Bell.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>So the low-cost model of consumerism in the United States,</p>
<p>which has been a stronghold for our economy for 100 years at this point,</p>
<p>may be coming to an end, or it will accelerate the implementation</p>
<p>of automation across that sector of the economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more likely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more likely.</p>
<p>By the way, if you read the press release for the four days a week&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay $4 for a Taco Bell burrito though.</p>
<p>Gobbledygook, in the four days a week thing, it said workers for far too long</p>
<p>have been forced to work very long hours and not get paid.</p>
<p>And they were not paid.</p>
<p>And so the idea is just like, you know, opt out.</p>
<p>But then if you opt out, you&rsquo;ll make even less.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In a moment where you can actually make more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These idiots who are coming up with these ideas&hellip;</p>
<p>The Chinese must be looking&hellip;</p>
<p>The Chinese is licking their chops.</p>
<p>At these buys-outs wrecking the American economy.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>But in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to do anything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re destroying it from the inside.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So just in terms of what we should do here,</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;s a lot of strength in the economy right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all negative.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is down to four and a half percent.</p>
<p>The labor participation rate&hellip;</p>
<p>4.2.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite low.</p>
<p>I mean, it was three and a half percent before COVID.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting close to where we were before COVID.</p>
<p>The labor participation rate is not great.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 61%.</p>
<p>Salaries are up.</p>
<p>It was 63% before COVID.</p>
<p>So we need to get more people working.</p>
<p>We could do that by ending the stimmy checks, okay?</p>
<p>But the most important thing we could do right now</p>
<p>is imagine we do Biden the biggest favor</p>
<p>by just putting a bullet in this Build Back Better plan.</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;d be a massive relief rally,</p>
<p>and the economy would take off like a rocket next year.</p>
<p>If you just got government out of the way,</p>
<p>they have printed enough.</p>
<p>The best thing that could happen is they stop this pumping and stimulus,</p>
<p>and then the Fed doesn&rsquo;t have to raise rates as aggressively next year.</p>
<p>And we could let things have more of a soft landing</p>
<p>as opposed to this sudden austerity,</p>
<p>which is whipsawing the economy.</p>
<p>So just slow the plane down,</p>
<p>and then maybe break this bill into 20 component parts</p>
<p>and just try to get a couple of things done.</p>
<p>He spent all the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spent.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a bender of all benders.</p>
<p>And if people are refusing to go back to work,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to, we talked about this in the last episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to think about&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a generalization.</p>
<p>Jason, I think it&rsquo;s a generalization to say people refuse to go back to work.</p>
<p>I think the jobs that people had when their options open up to them,</p>
<p>you know, may not be jobs they want to go back to.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s going to be a larger,</p>
<p>significant growth in a services economy that didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>Think about how many yoga instructors there are today</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t exist 20 years ago.</p>
<p>How many people doing hair?</p>
<p>Creators.</p>
<p>YouTube creators.</p>
<p>Creators, the creator economy alone, right?</p>
<p>Like Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on content.</p>
<p>And people are spending more time consuming content than ever before.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a services economy that I don&rsquo;t think we really predicted or modeled.</p>
<p>And we all assume, oh my god, we&rsquo;re not going to&hellip;</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going back to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, guess what?</p>
<p>People are spending money,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to spend money on new stuff.</p>
<p>And these new industries are going to emerge.</p>
<p>We know creators and those creators are going to create jobs around them.</p>
<p>You know, one amazing creator will hire 100 people to&hellip;</p>
<p>Staff his videos and make his music and edit his stuff and run his business and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way that the economy shifts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a moment here that is like a Cambrian explosion of new species of industry,</p>
<p>where this meteorite of COVID came and hit planet Earth.</p>
<p>There was an eradication of the old species,</p>
<p>minimum wage jobs for crappy labor work that people don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, the sun came out and new stuff is emerging,</p>
<p>and new life forms are emerging, new jobs are emerging.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going through a really ugly transitory period.</p>
<p>But I think, like Zach said, it could be really great on the other side.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more argument to be made, which is our friend, Brad Gersner,</p>
<p>sent me a note today saying,</p>
<p>I know you guys are going to rant on your all-in pod today about inflation.</p>
<p>I want to remind you about the deflationary effect of technology.</p>
<p>And it is really being felt in the economy.</p>
<p>I think we all see it.</p>
<p>How software alone can reduce the operating costs and the labor costs of businesses,</p>
<p>drive up margins, increase growth.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s a number of tailwinds here.</p>
<p>But I think Saxe is right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a masking going on with respect to the capital that&rsquo;s just being bandied about right now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a risky, nasty kind of maelstrom of a sea we&rsquo;re trying to cross right now.</p>
<p>I want to point out two positive things to build on Saxe&rsquo;s positivity.</p>
<p>Number one, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys are following Omicron in the UK.</p>
<p>They have record cases right now, but deaths&hellip;</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also done great with the vaccine, obviously.</p>
<p>Small country with a lot of resources.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re hitting record cases for this last cycle.</p>
<p>But deaths and hospitalizations are down.</p>
<p>And they say upward of 25-50% is now moved to Omicron.</p>
<p>And it seems like this could be the endgame, maybe.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Did you ever see the end of&hellip;</p>
<p>Was it an outbreak where they dropped that bomb?</p>
<p>And it was like the massive bomb that takes all the air out of the room.</p>
<p>It shocked everything.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, okay, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>There could be this thing happening where Omicron is the air bomb that gets dropped,</p>
<p>clears the room, and then it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing the salaries going up faster than inflation.</p>
<p>People are raising people&rsquo;s salaries in double digits to try to get them to come to these jobs.</p>
<p>So, the people who are choosing to go back to work,</p>
<p>and people are eventually choosing that and switching jobs to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re gonna be making more money.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna be more resilient, and they are gonna be a little more empowered.</p>
<p>And that could end up being a great thing.</p>
<p>And then finally, in terms of technology,</p>
<p>I have one robotic company that serves coffee, and they had a record week.</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>They&hellip;</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>Pump it.</p>
<p>No, no, they broke $11,000 in people ordering from a robotic coffee machine.</p>
<p>Previously, the record was like 7k a week.</p>
<p>So, people are getting used&hellip;</p>
<p>Tell your stupid lady friend, I have an $11,000 sweater.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Please, stop it.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>All right, listen, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this better.com layoffs viral video, but it&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you break this down?</p>
<p>Jake, I was not following this.</p>
<p>All right, very simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a company called better.com.</p>
<p>They get rid of origination fees or whatever, and commissions.</p>
<p>They try to get you faster mortgages, insurance, whatever.</p>
<p>They were going to SPAC.</p>
<p>SoftBank was going to put in 1.5 billion in the pipe.</p>
<p>Everything was going according to plan.</p>
<p>SoftBank was already in the company, right?</p>
<p>So, they were trying to get their own company out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, obviously, the market corrects.</p>
<p>Everybody always asks us as a group, what happens when the market corrects?</p>
<p>Well, here, you&rsquo;re about to see it.</p>
<p>This guy decides I got to cut 10% of the company.</p>
<p>Instead of having his managers go to each group and have a logical,</p>
<p>small discussion about how they&rsquo;re going to correct things,</p>
<p>and maybe some sort of thoughtful process,</p>
<p>he decides he&rsquo;s going to get on Zoom to the entire 900 people who are fired</p>
<p>and in a very bizarre way.</p>
<p>Nine, 900 people were fired?</p>
<p>900 people.</p>
<p>Over Zoom.</p>
<p>How big is this company?</p>
<p>10,000 employees.</p>
<p>And he says to them,</p>
<p>that the last time I had to do this, I laid people off, I cried,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to try to do better this time.</p>
<p>But if you are on this call effective immediately, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another one of these crazy clips we have to respond to.</p>
<p>I want to see it.</p>
<p>30 seconds.</p>
<p>Chamath, give me your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining.</p>
<p>I come to you with not great news.</p>
<p>The market has changed, as you know,</p>
<p>and we have to move with it in order to survive</p>
<p>so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and deliver on a mission.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t news that you&rsquo;re going to want to hear,</p>
<p>but ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear from me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a really, really challenging decision to make.</p>
<p>This is the second time in my career I&rsquo;m doing this,</p>
<p>and I do not, do not want to do this.</p>
<p>The last time I did it, I cried.</p>
<p>This time I hope to be stronger.</p>
<p>Okay, and then here&rsquo;s the second clip where he basically tells everybody over Zoom</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to be able to log in and you got two weeks severance,</p>
<p>three weeks before a month severance, and it&rsquo;s like three weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>We are laying off about 15% of the company.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The market efficiency and performances and productivity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group.</p>
<p>You dude is being laid off.</p>
<p>Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>What does this mean for what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get an email from HR, askhrbetter.com to your personal email address.</p>
<p>According to the details of your severance and your benefits for all US employees,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re providing four weeks of severance, one month of full benefits,</p>
<p>and two months of COBRA for which we will pay the premium.</p>
<p>So three months total benefits if you elect for COBRA.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve all operated business before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to do layoffs before.</p>
<p>It is the most fucking brutal thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the exact wrong way to do it, though.</p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
<p>I remember an AOL&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right way to do it.</p>
<p>But I think the question with this guy is to examine</p>
<p>the growth incentive that got him to this point.</p>
<p>He took SoftBank money.</p>
<p>SoftBank, as you guys, as we all know, creates a very strong incentive and capitalizes businesses</p>
<p>to go after ultra, perhaps unnatural growth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s almost always shocks that occur after they do that.</p>
<p>And the circumstance, I think, could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Maybe he built a business a little more steady,</p>
<p>but then his valuation would have been lower,</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to access as much capital.</p>
<p>And so, unfortunately, the loss of jobs is the cost of capital</p>
<p>with these ultra high growth incentives that are kind of being structurally</p>
<p>built into the fundraising rounds in these later stage deals lately.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys agree, but it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Sachs and then Chamath.</p>
<p>Okay, so&hellip;</p>
<p>How would you do the Sachs?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an operator.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so I&rsquo;ve had to lay people off before,</p>
<p>but never in this era of COVID and remote work.</p>
<p>So the question&hellip;</p>
<p>And look, it is miserable.</p>
<p>And I think that it is the right thing to do for him to take responsibility</p>
<p>if this restructuring was caused by a strategy that was overly prioritized growth.</p>
<p>I think he could say something like,</p>
<p>look, this is my fault, the company&rsquo;s fault, not your fault.</p>
<p>So I think he could have&hellip;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think he could have couched that.</p>
<p>I think he could have taken responsibility.</p>
<p>That being said, I don&rsquo;t think he owed the groveling apology</p>
<p>that he was forced to make because, look, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>How do you lay 900 people off in this era of remote work?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re all working from home.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no office for them to go into,</p>
<p>where you can sit them down one-on-one like a human like you used to be able to do</p>
<p>and have a conversation.</p>
<p>So they are laying people off by Zoom now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but I think it&rsquo;s just this new world that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a much better way to do this.</p>
<p>I think the words could have been better.</p>
<p>Maybe it could have been more organized.</p>
<p>But how do you lay off people who are working from home?</p>
<p>I have an idea, but Chamath, let me let you go first.</p>
<p>Any thoughts you want to add?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you how I would have done it.</p>
<p>I remember when I had to do my first layoff at AOL.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of those riffs.</p>
<p>And I remember the first one.</p>
<p>I was in my early to mid-20s as a manager.</p>
<p>And we had three or four people or whatever.</p>
<p>And I remember distinctly that AOL had this policy at the time,</p>
<p>because I guess they had maybe like better,</p>
<p>like tens of thousands of people, employees,</p>
<p>lots of call center, as an example.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve had to have riffs before.</p>
<p>They would have security guards.</p>
<p>And there would be a security guard outside the meeting room</p>
<p>where you would bring somebody in and talk to them.</p>
<p>And I just remember being seared in my mind,</p>
<p>because never having done it before,</p>
<p>I was like sweating profusely, really nervous.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>I felt really bad.</p>
<p>I felt very guilty.</p>
<p>And then you learn how to do these things.</p>
<p>And there is a very humane way to try to do these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never the best thing to do.</p>
<p>But you try to give people a fair exit package</p>
<p>and all of these things.</p>
<p>Let me put that aside,</p>
<p>because I think what Friedberg said is so good and so important.</p>
<p>The root cause of why this is here,</p>
<p>as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>is not a company that doesn&rsquo;t have consumer demand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company that may have been mismanaged for growth</p>
<p>to meet the consumer demand because of too much money.</p>
<p>And this is a thing that is an avoidable mistake.</p>
<p>And this is where you have to figure out</p>
<p>how much you want to basically swim with the tide</p>
<p>and be like everybody else,</p>
<p>which is to be able to go to the dinner party,</p>
<p>say I raised X amount of dollars at Y valuation</p>
<p>and just keep taking it up and taking it up.</p>
<p>Or to actually have the discipline to hit the brakes</p>
<p>and say, I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to take it.</p>
<p>I need to figure out my business model.</p>
<p>Those are two different kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be layoffs in both.</p>
<p>But if he actually came at it</p>
<p>from the perspective of,</p>
<p>listen, guys, we&rsquo;ve been growing methodically,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just been a structural change,</p>
<p>or for example, rates are ticking up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot less demand</p>
<p>and we have to right size the company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different statement</p>
<p>than maybe we overgrew</p>
<p>because we were drunk on free money.</p>
<p>And now we have to realize</p>
<p>that we actually have too much capacity</p>
<p>for the demand that actually exists.</p>
<p>And those are avoidable mistakes, frankly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had to do layoffs.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>This was executed terribly.</p>
<p>To your point, Saks,</p>
<p>I think a much easier way to do this</p>
<p>would have been to go to the leaders</p>
<p>in each group and say,</p>
<p>hey, listen, we&rsquo;re going to have to do these layoffs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to affect different groups.</p>
<p>So you take your group into a subset of Zoom,</p>
<p>you explain to those people,</p>
<p>and you do it.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, we are reorganizing</p>
<p>because of these reasons.</p>
<p>Chamath had some good language there,</p>
<p>other people did.</p>
<p>But this idea of mass firing 900 people</p>
<p>with one person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the critical error here.</p>
<p>Yeah, one mega Zoom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little megalomaniacal.</p>
<p>It was almost like he wanted to</p>
<p>talk about himself in this</p>
<p>as opposed to taking responsibility</p>
<p>to unpack it.</p>
<p>Obviously, when something like this happens,</p>
<p>then the floodgates open,</p>
<p>Forbes got a 2020 email leak</p>
<p>where he called his own employees dumb dolphins.</p>
<p>In the email that&rsquo;s been leaked</p>
<p>since this came out,</p>
<p>you are, cap locks on,</p>
<p>too damn slow.</p>
<p>You are a bunch of dumb dolphins</p>
<p>and dumb dolphins get caught</p>
<p>in nets eaten by sharks.</p>
<p>So stop it.</p>
<p>Cap locks on.</p>
<p>Stop it. Stop it.</p>
<p>Right now, you are embarrassing me.</p>
<p>This is the pile on.</p>
<p>This is the pile on.</p>
<p>I know, but this person clearly is a liar.</p>
<p>No, for 24 hours,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the incarnation of evil</p>
<p>in the eyes of the media,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re going to move on</p>
<p>to a new person in a couple of days.</p>
<p>So, I mean, look, I think-</p>
<p>Have you ever wrote in that to employees?</p>
<p>Do we have an email coming out from you?</p>
<p>I wrote all caps.</p>
<p>Guys, I quit the group chat for a day.</p>
<p>I all caps you guys this week.</p>
<p>That was hilarious.</p>
<p>Rage quit.</p>
<p>Can I connect with something</p>
<p>Chamath said about,</p>
<p>okay, so you have this larger question about,</p>
<p>or did the company grow too fast?</p>
<p>And our founders asking the right questions</p>
<p>about growing too fast.</p>
<p>Let me connect that</p>
<p>with the first conversation we had</p>
<p>about the macroeconomic situation.</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>every startup board right now</p>
<p>probably needs to be having a conversation</p>
<p>about the macro picture</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s one of two possibilities</p>
<p>happening right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen in the past five weeks,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen 30 to 40% correction</p>
<p>in the public markets</p>
<p>for growth stocks and SaaS companies.</p>
<p>That is absolutely going to trickle down</p>
<p>to venture valuations.</p>
<p>I think it already has.</p>
<p>If you look at the crossover guys,</p>
<p>like Tiger and CO2 and D1,</p>
<p>I guarantee you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all updating their models</p>
<p>or valuation models</p>
<p>based on the public comps.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>we are now in a slightly different environment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that 100 times ARR</p>
<p>is the metric anymore as it was,</p>
<p>you know, say two months ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the new metric</p>
<p>is going to land.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to see</p>
<p>some deals get done post correction.</p>
<p>But, you know,</p>
<p>we could be in a very different environment here.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s two possibilities.</p>
<p>Either the rate increases</p>
<p>that are coming next year</p>
<p>are now priced in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to go back into,</p>
<p>you know, a mode of going back</p>
<p>up into the right.</p>
<p>And especially, I think,</p>
<p>if this BBB bill gets killed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go back and up to the right.</p>
<p>Or this could be the beginning</p>
<p>of a protracted slide</p>
<p>as, you know,</p>
<p>more and more market participants</p>
<p>realize that we&rsquo;re in a very different</p>
<p>kind of environment.</p>
<p>And we may not have seen the bottom.</p>
<p>If you were running a company, Saks,</p>
<p>and you had just raised</p>
<p>that $100 million crazy round</p>
<p>at 100 times,</p>
<p>what do you do?</p>
<p>If you were running a SaaS company,</p>
<p>what would you do?</p>
<p>I just had this conversation</p>
<p>with one of our SaaS founders.</p>
<p>They just closed a monster round</p>
<p>at a great valuation.</p>
<p>And literally a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>and they have some interest</p>
<p>for more people</p>
<p>wanting to get into the round.</p>
<p>And I just pointed out,</p>
<p>listen, you know,</p>
<p>we may be going</p>
<p>into a very different environment.</p>
<p>And I think the company</p>
<p>is worth the valuation we got.</p>
<p>But, you know,</p>
<p>if you just look at the public comps,</p>
<p>valuations are down 30, 40 percent.</p>
<p>So if we were to take more money</p>
<p>into the round at the same valuation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a good deal</p>
<p>for the company.</p>
<p>And it gives us more runway,</p>
<p>gives us more insurance.</p>
<p>Secure the bag.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So those are the types</p>
<p>of conversations</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s prudent</p>
<p>to be having right now.</p>
<p>And frankly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of investors</p>
<p>and certainly a lot of founders</p>
<p>who never lived through</p>
<p>the dotcom crash and down markets,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know how bad it can get.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve only seen good times.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>18 months of nuclear winter?</p>
<p>No checks being written?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>whatever food you have</p>
<p>in the cupboard</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>for the next two thousand</p>
<p>to two thousand three.</p>
<p>You had three years</p>
<p>of nuclear winter pretty much.</p>
<p>But, you know,</p>
<p>in 2008, 2009,</p>
<p>it was about 18 months</p>
<p>of nuclear winter.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even that cold.</p>
<p>But you want to hear a great</p>
<p>2008, 2009 fundraising story?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at Facebook.</p>
<p>Market just implodes.</p>
<p>And we need we decide</p>
<p>that we need to raise</p>
<p>some insurance,</p>
<p>just a little, you know,</p>
<p>a little insurance policy,</p>
<p>a little money,</p>
<p>a little downside protection.</p>
<p>And I remember that</p>
<p>we were having</p>
<p>all these conversations</p>
<p>with TCV.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re a really good firm,</p>
<p>very smart.</p>
<p>And basically, you know,</p>
<p>we we told them</p>
<p>what the price was.</p>
<p>I think it was like</p>
<p>seven billion dollars pre.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like seven billion dollars.</p>
<p>We want to raise 500 million.</p>
<p>Just please just do it.</p>
<p>We just want a little</p>
<p>margin of safety.</p>
<p>And they came back</p>
<p>with their model</p>
<p>and they updated their model,</p>
<p>David, to your point.</p>
<p>And they came back</p>
<p>at like six point eight</p>
<p>or six point seven,</p>
<p>something like that,</p>
<p>six point five.</p>
<p>And we were like,</p>
<p>my God, what the fuck is this?</p>
<p>Like, this is not seven.</p>
<p>We just like we just want</p>
<p>to raise some money at seven.</p>
<p>And seven was a down round</p>
<p>because we had already taken</p>
<p>money from Microsoft</p>
<p>at 10 billion, not 15.</p>
<p>So we had thought</p>
<p>we had hit the jackpot</p>
<p>when a year ago,</p>
<p>a year earlier,</p>
<p>we raised two hundred</p>
<p>and forty nine million</p>
<p>dollars from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Now, by the way,</p>
<p>why two forty nine?</p>
<p>Because at two hundred</p>
<p>and fifty million bomber</p>
<p>would have to go to the board.</p>
<p>So he goes one one million</p>
<p>under the number</p>
<p>where bomber can sign</p>
<p>the check himself.</p>
<p>So we get bomber</p>
<p>in for two forty nine</p>
<p>at fifteen billion.</p>
<p>A year later,</p>
<p>the great financial crisis happens.</p>
<p>We are raising money.</p>
<p>We tell TCV,</p>
<p>please just give us five hundred</p>
<p>million at seven or eight,</p>
<p>some number.</p>
<p>They come in seven hundred</p>
<p>million under because</p>
<p>their model says whatever.</p>
<p>And I will never forget this.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>I was on the phone</p>
<p>and I think it was with like Ted Elliot,</p>
<p>our general counsel at the time.</p>
<p>And we got a term sheet</p>
<p>from a certain person,</p>
<p>Uri Milner at DST.</p>
<p>And Uri came in.</p>
<p>He he throws the high heater</p>
<p>at like eight and a half or nine.</p>
<p>No board seat, all common.</p>
<p>I mean, a completely</p>
<p>disruptive mood and move.</p>
<p>And all I just remember</p>
<p>asking Ted Elliot was,</p>
<p>does he vet?</p>
<p>Meaning like,</p>
<p>will the wire clear?</p>
<p>Will justice let the money</p>
<p>come into the United States?</p>
<p>Not knowing, right?</p>
<p>Because we had heard,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>anyways, the money cleared.</p>
<p>We took the check</p>
<p>and the rest is history.</p>
<p>I have a good story.</p>
<p>But when you are,</p>
<p>when you are facing</p>
<p>an enormous downturn,</p>
<p>you have a fiduciary responsibility,</p>
<p>David, to your point,</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re well capitalized.</p>
<p>But then on the other side,</p>
<p>you have a really important</p>
<p>fiduciary responsibility</p>
<p>to you and all the employees</p>
<p>and everybody else</p>
<p>to run this thing properly.</p>
<p>And you cannot get confused</p>
<p>that value and valuation</p>
<p>are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And so the minute you conflate the two,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an X billion dollar company</p>
<p>and start behaving that way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to note.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s been said many times before,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>what your responsibility</p>
<p>is as a board and as a fiduciary</p>
<p>to the shareholders</p>
<p>of that individual company,</p>
<p>and what the incentives</p>
<p>and motivations are</p>
<p>for the big investor</p>
<p>that just put all this money</p>
<p>into your company</p>
<p>for their portfolio as a whole.</p>
<p>For their portfolio as a whole,</p>
<p>they would rather tell everyone,</p>
<p>go hard, go fast,</p>
<p>spend as much money as you can.</p>
<p>And they hope that</p>
<p>one out of 10 companies</p>
<p>becomes a hundred X from there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay if nine out of 10 die.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t care if you die.</p>
<p>They care if one out of 10 companies</p>
<p>goes a hundred X.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You have a different incentive</p>
<p>and a different motivation</p>
<p>because if the company dies,</p>
<p>your shareholders,</p>
<p>you as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>your team lose out.</p>
<p>And that tension needs</p>
<p>to be understood really clearly</p>
<p>by entrepreneurs and executives</p>
<p>that are taking money</p>
<p>under these conditions.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, SoftBank,</p>
<p>CO2, they&rsquo;re great people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good people investing there,</p>
<p>but the incentive for them</p>
<p>is quite different than it is for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re betting on a big winner.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And do not, do not expect that</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re betting</p>
<p>on a big winner,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re expecting you</p>
<p>will be the big winner.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re indifferent.</p>
<p>As long as they have one go a hundred X,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what happens to you.</p>
<p>When I met Yuri Milner,</p>
<p>he came to a certain poker game,</p>
<p>not to play, but just to say hi.</p>
<p>And I said to him,</p>
<p>I said, you put all that money</p>
<p>into Facebook.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a week or two</p>
<p>after it happened.</p>
<p>I said, why didn&rsquo;t you take a board seat?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never happened.</p>
<p>And he looked at me and he goes,</p>
<p>Justin Calacanis,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to have a board seat</p>
<p>to be influential.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>I think this guy&rsquo;s going to like</p>
<p>whack me any minute.</p>
<p>You do not need the board seat</p>
<p>to be influential.</p>
<p>I was like, what do they use?</p>
<p>Compromat?</p>
<p>What? I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got guys.</p>
<p>And someday I&rsquo;ll tell the story</p>
<p>of the three hour lunch I have</p>
<p>with Yuri Milner.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen for, I, uh, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if we have anything else</p>
<p>to clean up here.</p>
<p>Are we talking about juicy?</p>
<p>Is it Jesse?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen, there&rsquo;s famous actors</p>
<p>as Dave Chappelle calls them,</p>
<p>the famous French actor,</p>
<p>juicy, smelly.</p>
<p>Listen, I don&rsquo;t even want to go there,</p>
<p>but I, there is a person who pretend this.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>worth talking about since we do go to,</p>
<p>we do talk about race.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s an actor who faked</p>
<p>that he was attacked in a bias attack.</p>
<p>He was found guilty of doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deranged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in the gossipy stories.</p>
<p>You guys have a good time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you guys.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>What else do we got on the docket?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lose free bricks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I miss Friedberg.</p>
<p>I want to hug Friedberg&rsquo;s bony body.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you come to the party tomorrow?</p>
<p>Coming.</p>
<p>What are you?</p>
<p>Boys.</p>
<p>I was in.</p>
<p>I did the thing with the thing of the thing.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>And then I was doing another thing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>Jake outside.</p>
<p>He was going to go skiing.</p>
<p>I said, you go skiing.</p>
<p>Have a good time.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m showing up for my best.</p>
<p>This is like the Beatles.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s turning into John Lennon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to hang out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some, you know,</p>
<p>we got some buddies there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to show up.</p>
<p>Well, Rick is going.</p>
<p>Saks, you&rsquo;re going guys.</p>
<p>Do you know how far it is from where I live from?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Cause I play.</p>
<p>I come to your house to play poker.</p>
<p>He comes to your house every week.</p>
<p>And I love you for that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you going to go Saks?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chance of Saks shows up?</p>
<p>He RSVP&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Are you going to go Saks?</p>
<p>Should I pick up the RSVP?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even do one of his.</p>
<p>Oh, for Friedberg&rsquo;s holiday party.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I have a conflict.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Bert.</p>
<p>Oh, you have a call.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>What is the conflict?</p>
<p>You need to drink some pappy.</p>
<p>Oh, they party tomorrow night.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going down to his party.</p>
<p>Can I go?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll skip Friedberg&rsquo;s for that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re selling you out.</p>
<p>Wait, why are you going?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>Besties.</p>
<p>You have.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re picking over Friedberg.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve got a holiday party for like the last five years or whatever it is number,</p>
<p>maybe more years than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always.</p>
<p>Tell us what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Tell us.</p>
<p>This is a good party.</p>
<p>When you see him, do you look him in the eyes and say, what have you done for me lately?</p>
<p>The two of them, the two of them haven&rsquo;t looked each other in the eyes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never looked in the eyes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never looked in the eyes.</p>
<p>And that was an accident.</p>
<p>When they first met, they accidentally.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I got to run.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, wait, no, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We have anything else?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do the Jussie Smollett thing quickly.</p>
<p>No, we do it last because he don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Better.</p>
<p>This is the last thing we&rsquo;ve been doing for over an hour.</p>
<p>A new bank IPO was huge.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>BuzzFeed IPO was a complete disaster.</p>
<p>80% of people redeem their SPAC.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed is circling the drain.</p>
<p>What a disaster.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>Thank you for tuning in to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we have on the docket today.</p>
<p>Chamath is ready, man.</p>
<p>Are you lonely, Chamath?</p>
<p>Chamath is loose.</p>
<p>Loosey goosey.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little loosey.</p>
<p>He wants to go for a ride too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working so hard.</p>
<p>I am working so hard.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I am wiped out this week.</p>
<p>I was traveling all week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted.</p>
<p>I got people in town.</p>
<p>I got to run.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll let Freeburg go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just go for five more minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go tomorrow, Freeburg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not selling you out like these other two.</p>
<p>I love you, J. Cole.</p>
<p>Like Ringo and&hellip;</p>
<p>Love you, Freeburgers.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>Lenin over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be Paul Carney.</p>
<p>Oh, did I tell you about my poker game on Monday?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You had a poker game?</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You went big?</p>
<p>It&hellip; we lost our minds.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>And there was&hellip;</p>
<p>There was some&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a big owl story?</p>
<p>There was some enormous carnage.</p>
<p>Wires were initiated today.</p>
<p>So everything is settled.</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>Were you carnaged?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I did a little chewing of the carcasses.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like one of those&hellip;</p>
<p>Was there a whale and you&rsquo;re just like a great white shark?</p>
<p>Just taking bites after the whale&rsquo;s dead?</p>
<p>Of the blubber?</p>
<p>We quit at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>And it was&hellip;</p>
<p>It was nice.</p>
<p>That is crazy.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So for Jesse Small&hellip;</p>
<p>And now that Freeburg&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jesse Small.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just very weird.</p>
<p>I mean, I think on a race issue,</p>
<p>this is like the worst possible thing to happen</p>
<p>because we do have instances of Asian hate,</p>
<p>of, you know, people being beaten up</p>
<p>for the color of their skin,</p>
<p>for their sexual preference, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then this person is so mentally deranged</p>
<p>that they set up a biased race attack.</p>
<p>Apparently, am I correct that he did this</p>
<p>in order to get sympathy</p>
<p>so that his acting career would do better?</p>
<p>Or do we not know?</p>
<p>Apparently, he was negotiating his contract.</p>
<p>He was worried about getting cut from the show.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He was on the show Empire</p>
<p>and he was worried about getting cut from the show.</p>
<p>But look, to me&hellip;</p>
<p>Hold on, explain that to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worried about getting cut from the show,</p>
<p>so the logic jump is</p>
<p>if I had a race attack, they can&rsquo;t fire me?</p>
<p>No, he played the sympathy card.</p>
<p>Sympathy card, I got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just want to make sure I&rsquo;m understanding it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not crazy.</p>
<p>He made himself into a cause celeb of the woke left.</p>
<p>This is in early 2019</p>
<p>when everyone was worried about, you know, Trump.</p>
<p>So he claimed that he was beaten</p>
<p>by two MAGA, you know, haters</p>
<p>who tied a noose around his neck</p>
<p>and poured bleach on him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the bleach was about.</p>
<p>I think maybe that was&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>&hellip;to make him white or something.</p>
<p>He said&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that what it was?</p>
<p>&hellip;two white dudes, okay?</p>
<p>And then at one point he, in the interview,</p>
<p>when the interrogators</p>
<p>or the investigators were pressing,</p>
<p>are you sure they were white?</p>
<p>He said, well, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to be racist.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t compare them.</p>
<p>Like, and then it turned out</p>
<p>the two dudes were black.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, like from Nigeria.</p>
<p>But he hired them.</p>
<p>Yeah, he hired them.</p>
<p>He hired them and he paid them by check.</p>
<p>So this is not like a master criminal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Lex Luthor.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But look, I think this story,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s really about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a story about one sociopath</p>
<p>doing this crazy thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really more a media story.</p>
<p>This is about how the media covered it.</p>
<p>They loved it.</p>
<p>They loved it.</p>
<p>And I think this&hellip;</p>
<p>Wall to wall news.</p>
<p>Wall to wall coverage.</p>
<p>And I think this reflects</p>
<p>all the worst qualities of the media.</p>
<p>Number one, rush to judgment.</p>
<p>They immediately bought into the story</p>
<p>and they were attacking the Trump administration</p>
<p>for creating the hate and the MAGA people.</p>
<p>So there was a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>Number two, there was no,</p>
<p>and this goes with the rush to judgment.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do any fact checking whatsoever, right?</p>
<p>Because the story was too good.</p>
<p>It fit all their priors,</p>
<p>just like the Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>Ivermectin hoax about,</p>
<p>you know, the MAGA people,</p>
<p>you know, in Oklahoma hospitals or whatever.</p>
<p>That story was too good.</p>
<p>And Rolling Stone and Rachel Maddow bought the&hellip;</p>
<p>No fact checking.</p>
<p>Bought the hoax, hook, line, sinker,</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t do the fact checking.</p>
<p>And then number three, no corrections.</p>
<p>None of these sources ever apologized,</p>
<p>did the mea culpa, issued a correction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just an eerie silence</p>
<p>coming out of all the sources</p>
<p>who pumped the story like crazy.</p>
<p>You have to, Nick,</p>
<p>please put it in the show notes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s got to be a YouTube clip</p>
<p>of the Chappelle joke around Juicy Smollet.</p>
<p>And the basic joke is like</p>
<p>every colored person stayed silent.</p>
<p>All the blacks, all the browns.</p>
<p>And the joke, the punchline of the joke</p>
<p>is because we were all like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably did it.</p>
<p>You know, like,</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t you defending Juicy Smollet?</p>
<p>And the whole point is,</p>
<p>he looks kind of guilty to us.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, hold on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly funny.</p>
<p>If you, let&rsquo;s just play 15 seconds of this,</p>
<p>a deep link to his first interview.</p>
<p>I think this is his first full interview.</p>
<p>Just play 10 seconds of that,</p>
<p>because this is bizarre.</p>
<p>Of Juicy Smollet?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I noticed the rope around my neck</p>
<p>and I started screaming.</p>
<p>And I said, there&rsquo;s a rope around my neck.</p>
<p>Did you get any kind of description</p>
<p>of the attack?</p>
<p>I gave a body description</p>
<p>and I, you know,</p>
<p>because I saw this,</p>
<p>but, and you know,</p>
<p>right here or whatever,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you what color their eyes were.</p>
<p>And I did not see anything</p>
<p>except the second person I saw running away.</p>
<p>And the first person,</p>
<p>yeah, I saw,</p>
<p>saw his stature.</p>
<p>I gave the description as best as I could.</p>
<p>You have to understand also</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s Chicago in winter.</p>
<p>People can wear ski masks</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s going to question that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so deranged.</p>
<p>I mean, the, the poker towels</p>
<p>are flying off of him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like thinking,</p>
<p>does this make him a bad actor or a good actor?</p>
<p>I just want to know David as a producer.</p>
<p>Are you hiring him now or not?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe I will hire him actually.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;ll be working pretty cheap.</p>
<p>He finally got his Emmy.</p>
<p>Oh my God. Sorry too soon.</p>
<p>But the crazy thing here</p>
<p>is that a lot of people,</p>
<p>all the liberal elites</p>
<p>basically fell for this hook,</p>
<p>line and sinker,</p>
<p>president Biden,</p>
<p>vice president.</p>
<p>They all jumped the gun on this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re basically denouncing</p>
<p>they bought into the story.</p>
<p>They were denouncing this racist attack</p>
<p>and blaming Trump</p>
<p>and the administration for the new policy.</p>
<p>I wait until the court case</p>
<p>is over to comment on these crazy things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to comment on a Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to like it or retweet it.</p>
<p>We have a justice system.</p>
<p>If this stuff is hitting the justice system,</p>
<p>just let the process happen</p>
<p>because the velocity of social media</p>
<p>is such that,</p>
<p>and we talk about algorithms all the time,</p>
<p>that if something like this happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to become the number one story</p>
<p>and a billion people are going to see it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s fallout</p>
<p>and the fallout here is it just divides.</p>
<p>Everybody shut up and wait.</p>
<p>The same thing happened</p>
<p>on the written house case, right?</p>
<p>Massive rush to judgment.</p>
<p>They accused this kid</p>
<p>of being a white supremacist attacker</p>
<p>who basically like a school shooter.</p>
<p>It turned out to be totally false.</p>
<p>But, you know, the court systems</p>
<p>have been doing an amazing job.</p>
<p>When you think about the cases,</p>
<p>I think the courts have been on quite a run</p>
<p>in, I think, contradistinction to the media</p>
<p>keeps getting it wrong, right?</p>
<p>So you think about it.</p>
<p>So Derek Chauvin convicted,</p>
<p>Jussie Smollett convicted,</p>
<p>the three killers of Ahmaud Arbery convicted.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But Kyle Rittenhouse, not guilty.</p>
<p>Kenneth Walker, not guilty.</p>
<p>This was Breonna Taylor&rsquo;s boyfriend</p>
<p>who killed a cop when they killed her.</p>
<p>Remember when they busted the apartment?</p>
<p>He basically pledged his case.</p>
<p>He pledged self-defense</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who was shooting at them.</p>
<p>And he got off just like how Rittenhouse did.</p>
<p>So, you know, people,</p>
<p>I think are jumping the gun</p>
<p>on a lot of these cases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually an enormous amount of justice.</p>
<p>America is an incredible country.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get enough credit for that.</p>
<p>That mostly finds a way</p>
<p>to get to the right place.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are moments</p>
<p>where we completely get it wrong.</p>
<p>But David, to your point,</p>
<p>those are some really powerful examples</p>
<p>in modern history with a lot of scrutiny</p>
<p>where our peers, American jurors</p>
<p>found the way to get to the right answer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Feels great.</p>
<p>Bravo to America.</p>
<p>Bravo to those folks.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>By the way, the Breonna Taylor example</p>
<p>is a really wonderful example.</p>
<p>And the Ahmaud Arbery thing</p>
<p>was really important to me as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing it up.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Well, you know, because because I think,</p>
<p>you know, when the Rittenhouse</p>
<p>verdict came down,</p>
<p>a lot of people were saying,</p>
<p>well, look, if Kyle Rittenhouse</p>
<p>had been black,</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten</p>
<p>this self-defense as justice.</p>
<p>Well, Kenneth Walker,</p>
<p>actually, that case</p>
<p>was a self-defense case.</p>
<p>And he killed a cop.</p>
<p>Not a single article in the mainstream media</p>
<p>to basically actually defend Kenneth Walker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he actually shot a cop, right?</p>
<p>And but and he still got off</p>
<p>because when they bust into that apartment,</p>
<p>the jury thought it was reasonable.</p>
<p>Very, very tragic self-defense.</p>
<p>Very tragic that that that the officer died.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry for the family.</p>
<p>But I really hope that Kenneth Walker</p>
<p>has a really amazing,</p>
<p>productive life from here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a terrible situation of like,</p>
<p>are these no knock warrants</p>
<p>even warranted?</p>
<p>Like, what are we doing?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if necessary,</p>
<p>if Kenneth Walker lives a productive life</p>
<p>and does good in the world from here,</p>
<p>he does a small amount</p>
<p>to kind of make up</p>
<p>for that injustice of Breonna Taylor</p>
<p>and probably, you know,</p>
<p>kind of create some positive karma</p>
<p>for the family of the officer that passed away.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the best that you can do.</p>
<p>We just be great if as Americans,</p>
<p>we could start looking at these issues</p>
<p>and saying like, justice is worth pursuing.</p>
<p>The truth is worth pursuing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all in it together.</p>
<p>The United States,</p>
<p>like we talked about in the economy.</p>
<p>Also, we got it right in places</p>
<p>that the elite coasts</p>
<p>kind of point to and look down on.</p>
<p>We got it right in places like Georgia</p>
<p>and deep parts of Georgia, you know.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>for us to also think about.</p>
<p>It is the virulent strain</p>
<p>of the liberal elite</p>
<p>that really do judge</p>
<p>the rest of the country</p>
<p>for being in a way</p>
<p>that is actually not true.</p>
<p>They got it right in Kenosha,</p>
<p>Georgia, Kentucky, Illinois,</p>
<p>just to put it on the record.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time</p>
<p>on the All In Podcast</p>
<p>for The Dictator, Rain Man</p>
<p>and The Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>See you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like sexual tension,</p>
<p>but they just need to release themselves.</p>
