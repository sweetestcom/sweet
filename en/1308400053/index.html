    <p>Okay, hi friends, I just got home from being out, but I really want to make this episode</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Like I have some important shit to say about how to truly level yourself up.</p>
<p>This is something heavy in my mind right now and I just kind of had a big realization around</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So I always say to act on your inspiration.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m having to do that right now.</p>
<p>I just hop my ass in front of here and we&rsquo;re going to make an episode about what I realized</p>
<p>about leveling yourself up because everybody claims that they know how to do it and no</p>
<p>one really fucking knows.</p>
<p>No one truly knows like how to level yourself up.</p>
<p>But this is something that just like rattled the fuck out of my brain.</p>
<p>So basically if you want to level up or you want to like improve anything, all you have</p>
<p>to do is switch and alter your sense of what&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>Basically raise your threshold for what you think is normal.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been operating at a certain way and doing certain shit and you&rsquo;re like used</p>
<p>to it, that&rsquo;s your normal.</p>
<p>When you upgrade that and you can make the next step of like doing more, being more,</p>
<p>all this shit.</p>
<p>If this can become your new normal, boom, you&rsquo;ve leveled up and you just continuously</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>Like you raise your threshold for what your sense of normal is and I&rsquo;m going to give you</p>
<p>a whole bunch of examples and break a lot of shit down, but I&rsquo;m so excited about this.</p>
<p>So this is just one example that I thought of.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to make yourself do a hundred pushups a day.</p>
<p>You decided I&rsquo;m going to start doing a hundred pushups a day.</p>
<p>Your first while, like I was going to say your first couple of days, but bitch, your</p>
<p>first while of doing that probably month, it&rsquo;s going to be fucking hell if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>used to doing pushups.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say your norm is like 10 for you to be able to do 10 pushups and then to force</p>
<p>yourself to do a hundred, it&rsquo;s going to feel like so much fucking work.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So just physically like alone, that&rsquo;s going to be fucking hard.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only able to do 10 pushups and you force yourself to do a hundred a day, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be fucking hard physically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be tired.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to like space it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a lot longer than it should because you can&rsquo;t just pump out a hundred</p>
<p>and like be on with your fucking day.</p>
<p>You could pump out 10 and then you&rsquo;re going to lay there and be exhausted and tired.</p>
<p>And so you can put out five more than five more than five.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a long fucking time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to dread it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fucking hate it.</p>
<p>And this is totally expected when you start something new.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not good enough for yet.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel overwhelmed this fuck.</p>
<p>And this whole like doing a hundred pushups is going to be the worst part of your day.</p>
<p>Your first like month of doing it, it&rsquo;s going to be hell.</p>
<p>But as you do it more and more, you get better and it gets easier.</p>
<p>But if you just do it one day and then you stop, you&rsquo;re never going to get there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to have leveled up.</p>
<p>If you face a little challenge and it&rsquo;s difficult and you just say, eh, fuck it and quit.</p>
<p>You fucked up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not moving from anywhere where you are.</p>
<p>Like you did it one day.</p>
<p>Okay, cool bitch.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing things consistently and like doing a hundred pushups a day, if 10 pushups</p>
<p>a day is your norm and now you flip it to a hundred, that&rsquo;s like zero to a hundred bitch.</p>
<p>Like try 50, 50 a day for a minute, like build up a strength.</p>
<p>But if you want to expedite the process, like flip it to a hundred, literally do a hundred</p>
<p>fucking pushups a day.</p>
<p>If you can only do 10, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before that becomes your new normal.</p>
<p>After about six months, this is going to be easy as fuck for you.</p>
<p>Like your norm of 10, your norm of a hundred is going to feel as easy as the norm of 10</p>
<p>when you started.</p>
<p>After six months, if you do a hundred pushups a day, you&rsquo;re going to be able to get down</p>
<p>and fucking knock them out, knock out the hundred pretty easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my, you&rsquo;re going to get, your heart rate&rsquo;s going to get up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be a little like, but you&rsquo;re going to be able to knock them out easily.</p>
<p>Whereas like day one, you took like a fucking hour to get it all done.</p>
<p>But when you stay consistent with it and you get to six months of doing it, that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to feel so easy.</p>
<p>Like doing a hundred is going to be no fucking big deal because your body adapts.</p>
<p>Also your mind, but we&rsquo;re going to get into the mind in a minute, but your body adapts.</p>
<p>Your muscles get stronger when you put yourself under stress or under stimuli.</p>
<p>If you continually are exposed to it, you will adapt.</p>
<p>You will become strong enough to handle it.</p>
<p>It will beat you the fuck down in the beginning, but that&rsquo;s the only way to get stronger mentally</p>
<p>and physically.</p>
<p>And when I say your mindset around it flips, day one versus the six month mark of you doing</p>
<p>a hundred pushups a day, the first day you fucking dreaded it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel like you can do it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel good enough.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel confident.</p>
<p>You fucking dreaded having to do that every day.</p>
<p>It was a goddamn chore and you didn&rsquo;t look forward to it.</p>
<p>But after doing it repeatedly over a long period of time at six months, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to have the emotional baggage of like the way that you&rsquo;re looking at it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not going to be looked at as an inconvenience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something normal that you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer a big deal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the beginning.</p>
<p>It felt like a huge fucking deal.</p>
<p>Worst part of your day.</p>
<p>When you adapt and you get strong enough to handle the task in front of you, it&rsquo;s no longer</p>
<p>going to ruin you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer going to feel like it&rsquo;s bad and you&rsquo;re no longer going to look at it like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking inconvenience or it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re no longer going to look at it like it&rsquo;s hard and it&rsquo;s not going to feel as hard</p>
<p>because when you look at shit like it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s going to make it 10 times more hard even</p>
<p>if it is hard, you know?</p>
<p>But the mindset shift happens as you go through the process.</p>
<p>Like at the six month mark, you&rsquo;re just going to look at it like it&rsquo;s a part of your day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer a big deal.</p>
<p>Like I said, you&rsquo;re no longer going to question, are you capable of doing it?</p>
<p>No bitch, you can do it now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve put in the work to do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve become resilient.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve like gotten the fucking fortitude to be able to complete the task at hand.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re exposed to a lot of like challenges or something difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exposed to uncomfortable and difficult situations.</p>
<p>You will adapt as long as you keep exposing yourself to it.</p>
<p>You will become strong enough to handle anything fucking in front of you if it&rsquo;s in front of</p>
<p>you long enough.</p>
<p>And that applies to emotionally too.</p>
<p>So imagine if like you&rsquo;re going through a breakup right now or like you just got fired</p>
<p>from your job and you&rsquo;re so upset about it, it feels like the worst fucking shit.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;ve been through that a hundred times.</p>
<p>The version of you experiencing it for the first time and the version of you experiencing</p>
<p>it for the hundredth time are going to be two different motherfuckers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to handle it way different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to feel way different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to have a whole different perspective on it.</p>
<p>Like for you with the first time, it&rsquo;s going to feel like the end of the fucking world.</p>
<p>You for the hundredth time, you&rsquo;re going to be like, eh, whatever.</p>
<p>But when you do hard things, your threshold raises for what you&rsquo;re able to handle.</p>
<p>Your tolerance is higher.</p>
<p>So this is just a huge like mindset shift.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it just knocked me in the fucking head.</p>
<p>Like I kind of knew it, but I don&rsquo;t know why it just hit me real hard and I wanted to share</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But this new awareness is all great and fine, but I want to give you a tip on how you can</p>
<p>actually continue forward in something.</p>
<p>Like when you are up against the challenge that you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re able to handle</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel like you can face, I want you to ask yourself this question to get yourself</p>
<p>through it and to start seeing solutions you weren&rsquo;t seeing before.</p>
<p>If quitting was not an option, how could I continue?</p>
<p>What would have to shift?</p>
<p>What would I have to do to be able to continue if quitting was not an option?</p>
<p>There is no kill yourself, get out of it.</p>
<p>There is no quit.</p>
<p>There is no other option but to continue forward.</p>
<p>That question is going to force you to look for a way through what you&rsquo;re facing, not</p>
<p>a way out of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done this before.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve asked myself this in different ways, like this whole realization just came with</p>
<p>all of it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a little tool that I use all the time.</p>
<p>Look for a way through, not a way out.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something you want on the other side of what you&rsquo;re going through that&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>you need to commit to finding the way through it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even entertain the thought or consider explanations and possibilities of a way out.</p>
<p>Fully commit like you are in that bitch, like there is no way out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the saw house, like that scary movie where people get trapped in the house and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way out.</p>
<p>Like bitch, you&rsquo;re in it.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So there is no quit.</p>
<p>There is no option but to thrive.</p>
<p>So how can I do that?</p>
<p>And that question is going to unlock all the shit that you can start implementing and doing</p>
<p>to strengthen yourself and to get through it.</p>
<p>Like you can ask yourself, what do I physically need to do?</p>
<p>And then what do I mentally need to do?</p>
<p>What perspective do I need to hold about this situation in order to mentally and emotionally</p>
<p>get myself through it?</p>
<p>And I do kind of want to check everybody because I needed to be checked a long fucking time</p>
<p>ago and life sure as shit did.</p>
<p>But I wish someone could have just told me instead of the universe fucking my life up.</p>
<p>But you have it a lot easier than you think.</p>
<p>And I know I don&rsquo;t like to discredit and like discount people&rsquo;s experiences and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with.</p>
<p>Your pain is very real.</p>
<p>Your struggles are very real.</p>
<p>But there are people dealing with 10 times more and they&rsquo;re still functioning.</p>
<p>The only intention I have behind saying that is it doesn&rsquo;t mean that your problems are</p>
<p>not real or not hard.</p>
<p>There are people that have found a way to function with 10 times more and 10 times less</p>
<p>resources.</p>
<p>Like in the world, there&rsquo;s people that deal with a lot more shit.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a modern civilization, if you feel like you are crippled by what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>facing, there is hope and there is a way out.</p>
<p>And you need to look to the people who are finding the way through the shit that&rsquo;s 10</p>
<p>times harder than what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>Not to discredit yourself, not to fight yourself, but to look for the other possibilities of</p>
<p>how you can continue moving forward.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re able to function with 10 times the problems that you have, there is a way</p>
<p>for you to learn to function with the problems that you face.</p>
<p>There was this quote that kind of like kicked me in the ass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this realization and everything I just said like hit me on one side of my</p>
<p>ass.</p>
<p>And then this realization hit me on the other side, this quote.</p>
<p>And it said, you can modify your skills or you can modify your dreams.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just don&rsquo;t fucking sit right with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically you can rise to the occasion or you can change what the fuck you think</p>
<p>you want for your life.</p>
<p>Like you can change your goals.</p>
<p>You can change yourself to get to your goals.</p>
<p>That shit was like the kick in the ass I needed.</p>
<p>But like I didn&rsquo;t need both of these at once, bitch, I need to be able to process one for</p>
<p>the other.</p>
<p>But awareness hits you when it needs to.</p>
<p>So I wanted to get on here and share it because we all function the same.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re aware, you have a lot going on in your fucking head.</p>
<p>But this kind of like grounds you and brings you to the truth of the situation at hand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be all up in your emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, how can I get through this?</p>
<p>How can I build myself up?</p>
<p>How can I level myself up?</p>
<p>How can I improve my skills so that I don&rsquo;t have to modify my goals?</p>
<p>Because you can fucking reach anything you want to reach.</p>
<p>You just have to do what it takes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re fully capable of doing what it takes.</p>
<p>You can look at all the reasons why it&rsquo;s going to be hard or why you don&rsquo;t have what it takes</p>
<p>and why you can&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>But those are all excuses.</p>
<p>You can absolutely fucking do it.</p>
<p>Does not mean it will be easy.</p>
<p>Does not mean you will know how.</p>
<p>It does not mean you can follow what other people tell you to do.</p>
<p>But there is a fucking way to get there if you commit to it.</p>
<p>If you commit to figuring it out, you 1000% will.</p>
<p>And that goes with everything in your life.</p>
<p>One of my own personal examples with raising my threshold to be able to handle more is</p>
<p>when I started posting on social media.</p>
<p>I thought posting once a week was a lot.</p>
<p>I was stressed out trying to post once a week on TikTok and Instagram, bitch.</p>
<p>That was a lot for me.</p>
<p>I was stressed.</p>
<p>I was anxious.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I was like, how am I going to think of ideas?</p>
<p>How am I going to&hellip;</p>
<p>It was just so much in my fucking head and I thought that was hard.</p>
<p>If you understand growth, it&rsquo;s a numbers game on social media.</p>
<p>You have to post more.</p>
<p>You have to get in front of more people&rsquo;s faces to be recognized to gain an audience</p>
<p>to grow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a fucking numbers game, babe.</p>
<p>So if you want to quicken your progress and quicken your results, you got to increase</p>
<p>the amount that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So I started making myself post daily.</p>
<p>And when I started that, I was so fucking stressed out because I had two TikTok accounts,</p>
<p>my advice account, and then my problematic personality account.</p>
<p>The personality account, I said, you can post once a week.</p>
<p>And then my advice account, I made myself post daily.</p>
<p>And then on Instagram, I was posting stories daily and then posts on my app page daily</p>
<p>and posts on my main Instagram account every couple of days.</p>
<p>So I was having to make content and take pictures and shit and have things to post.</p>
<p>And I was also posting on Facebook at the time trying to promote my app.</p>
<p>So I was posting once a week on all of my shit, feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And I saw what I needed to do to grow.</p>
<p>The goal I had was not going to be reached with this measly little once a fucking week.</p>
<p>So I fucking flipped that shit.</p>
<p>And I threw so much work onto myself.</p>
<p>And I was so overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I thought I was overwhelmed with once a week.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck overwhelm was with posting on social media.</p>
<p>Once I started posting daily bitch and managing like five different accounts on three different</p>
<p>platforms, I was so fucking overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I did not know how to manage it at first.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I could do it, but I committed to it and I made myself do it.</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s a non-negotiable motherfucker.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to post if you want this gold, do this.</p>
<p>So I made myself start posting.</p>
<p>I no longer follow a set schedule with what I post.</p>
<p>Now I just post when I want to.</p>
<p>But my whole goal behind this was to desensitize myself to the frequency of posting.</p>
<p>Now to post all the fucking time doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve gotten equipped with the skills and I&rsquo;ve trained my brain to think of ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to allocate my time and dedicate time to certain things.</p>
<p>Oh, and my podcast.</p>
<p>I was doing this shit on a side too, but I&rsquo;ve, I trained myself to be able to handle</p>
<p>a lot of different shit at once, just with social media, regardless of everything else</p>
<p>I was working on.</p>
<p>Like I had to desensitize myself and like reality check myself with like, okay, you</p>
<p>thought once a week was a lot, let me throw this shit on you.</p>
<p>And then I, I fucking squirmed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to adapt.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was like learning as I went, but I forced myself to grow by doing that.</p>
<p>And now my sense of normal is it&rsquo;s not normal for me to not post like almost daily on everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird to me now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that much effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>I look back on me that was stressed posting once a week and be like, Oh, like little do</p>
<p>you fucking know.</p>
<p>But the more you do shit, the more you&rsquo;ll adapt, the more creative you&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>The more you&rsquo;ll learn ways to keep going that you didn&rsquo;t see before.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t learn how to face a challenge and get through things if you don&rsquo;t try to get</p>
<p>through them.</p>
<p>Like as soon as you start walking through whatever you&rsquo;re facing is when all the awareness,</p>
<p>all the insight, all the explanations, all the possibilities, all the new perspectives</p>
<p>are going to flood the fuck in.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just watch from the sideline and be looking for ways to help manage it.</p>
<p>You just have to throw yourself in it.</p>
<p>Like when I was posting once a week, if I was sitting here like, Oh, how can I be more</p>
<p>efficient?</p>
<p>What things can I do?</p>
<p>How can I manage this emotionally and prepare to start posting more?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned what I learned by just jumping into this shit and adapting</p>
<p>as I went.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just sit on the sideline and prepare.</p>
<p>You have to jump into this shit a lot.</p>
<p>And like, if you truly want to level yourself up, you have to raise your threshold.</p>
<p>So overwhelm the fuck out of yourself with what you need to do.</p>
<p>Get desensitized and make your new like heavy workload, your new sense of normal because</p>
<p>it is normal for me now.</p>
<p>I did not know how I was going to be able to do it at the beginning, but now it&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken six months, but now I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Now I have a higher threshold for this shit and I&rsquo;m ready to up it from here, which is</p>
<p>something I never thought I would fucking do.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m able to handle it now.</p>
<p>I just want to like ramble about this because I want to give you guys the reassurance.</p>
<p>I have one more example too, but with mental shit too, like emotional things, this goes</p>
<p>for both things.</p>
<p>Like feeling like you have too much to do all the time.</p>
<p>Add more shit, literally just add more shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get burnt out.</p>
<p>But if you do not stop, you will figure out the ways to deal with burnout.</p>
<p>The only way out is through.</p>
<p>The only way to learn what you need to learn is going through shit.</p>
<p>So put yourself through shit and watch how strong you get.</p>
<p>Watch how much better you become.</p>
<p>Watch how fast you level up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my last little example with like raising your threshold or getting used to something</p>
<p>being uncomfortable, like getting used to discomfort basically is I started working</p>
<p>with a nutrition coach a few months ago and I was used to eating like 250 to 300 grams</p>
<p>of carbs a day.</p>
<p>And when I started working with this nutrition coach, I told him I want results very fast.</p>
<p>I said, give me like the quickest shit that will get me to where I want to go.</p>
<p>Like give me a month of hell because I&rsquo;m a type where like if I&rsquo;m going to suffer and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to like go through something, make it as bad as it can fucking be to get</p>
<p>me my results as fast as possible because I don&rsquo;t want to prolong my suffering.</p>
<p>Like give me a month of absolute hell so I can get it over with and then after that month</p>
<p>we can get something that I can maintain easier and I don&rsquo;t want to fucking kill myself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>
<p>And my meal plan came back and I about shit meself because I was only given 30 grams of</p>
<p>carbs a day to eat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to 250 and I&rsquo;m used to 3000 plus calories a day and that&rsquo;s still a deficit</p>
<p>for me because I work out very hard and I&rsquo;m 6'7&quot;.</p>
<p>But I was eating 1700 calories and 30 grams of carbs.</p>
<p>Like the rest was just protein and fat.</p>
<p>And when I first started doing this meal plan, I felt like fucking shit.</p>
<p>I felt skinny.</p>
<p>I was barely eating.</p>
<p>But I felt so drained, tired, pissed, moody.</p>
<p>Like everything felt wrong.</p>
<p>Everything was so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I fucking hated it.</p>
<p>I had a fucking headache every day.</p>
<p>Like every day I&rsquo;d wake up, I&rsquo;d have a headache.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d eat Advil and before I go to bed I got another headache so I would just get high.</p>
<p>But I would have to like get high and go to bed real fast because I couldn&rsquo;t fucking eat.</p>
<p>Like what am I going to get high and eat?</p>
<p>Like one time I got high and I got the munchies and I didn&rsquo;t have anything I could eat so</p>
<p>I had to eat fucking green beans.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not jeopardizing my goals, bitch.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m going to commit to it, suffer that little period, look how I want to look and</p>
<p>then boom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good and I can be done with the shit.</p>
<p>I like to leave things behind me after I suffer for them and achieve them.</p>
<p>Like get the fuck behind me fatso.</p>
<p>Like when I was chubby, leave it be.</p>
<p>Get behind me.</p>
<p>And like now I get to enjoy having a nice body.</p>
<p>But when I first started that meal plan, yo, I did not think I was going to make it.</p>
<p>But I had to like check myself and like adjust to the new form of normal.</p>
<p>Like my normal was such a surplus of carbs and like feeling energized, feeling good to</p>
<p>feeling very depleted with fucking 30 grams of carbs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even one piece of god damn toast.</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of honey is 30 grams of fucking carbs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 36 I think, 34, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I was running off of literally like two tablespoons worth of honey a day for carbs</p>
<p>which is very very hard.</p>
<p>I was fucking tired.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was moody.</p>
<p>I was mad as fuck.</p>
<p>Like I just was hating life and I still forced myself to function and do everything I was</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>I was still doing my calls.</p>
<p>I was still doing my podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working with this nutrition coach and I have like a more maintainable meal plan</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on like 150 grams of carbs which is a lot better but like girl, I be fucking inhaling</p>
<p>that oatmeal when I get it.</p>
<p>But in the beginning it was such a drastic change from what I was used to.</p>
<p>I fucking hated it but I stuck with it and I would fuck up.</p>
<p>Like I would fuck up on the meal plan.</p>
<p>I would binge eat by accident because like I was in such a caloric deficit and like I</p>
<p>was trying to function.</p>
<p>I was sluggish as fuck at the gym.</p>
<p>I was so tired.</p>
<p>Like I kept fucking up the meal plan but as I kept fucking up and then getting back on</p>
<p>track and recommitting to it, I became strong enough to handle it.</p>
<p>I learned the new ways I was going to feel during the day.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m used to feeling energized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to feeling pumped.</p>
<p>I have a lot of carbs in me.</p>
<p>I had to adjust to the new feeling states that came along.</p>
<p>I had to adjust to the new energy level that I had.</p>
<p>I was operating at a lot less energy but I could still function.</p>
<p>I was operating with a lot less food but I could still function and I did.</p>
<p>I just had to adjust to my day to day how I felt being different.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t mean it was bad or wrong.</p>
<p>I was still able to function.</p>
<p>I just had to accept and realize and learn to function with the new way that I felt which</p>
<p>was very different from what I felt before.</p>
<p>Also had to deal with the emotional side of it.</p>
<p>Of like all the fucking emotions I was having.</p>
<p>Like I was so hungry like all the fucking time.</p>
<p>Like I had to, oh my god, I don&rsquo;t even want to think about it.</p>
<p>It was the worst month of my life.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through way worse shit than like fucking barely eating.</p>
<p>But at the end of the month, I was sticking with it.</p>
<p>I was able to do it.</p>
<p>I was able to function.</p>
<p>Like what seemed impossible in the beginning as I stuck with it was manageable and tolerable</p>
<p>and I kind of liked it.</p>
<p>Like I liked how I felt eating like that after I got used to all the shit that I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>used to.</p>
<p>So it did not become my new normal bitch but I did raise my threshold to deal with those</p>
<p>feeling states and eating that way.</p>
<p>So I still like carbs.</p>
<p>I do not want to be back on that meal plan.</p>
<p>I feel a lot more confident that if I have to go back on it, I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be like, oh my god, the world has ended.</p>
<p>Like I was before.</p>
<p>Like I was whiny as fuck before.</p>
<p>But now I can handle things like that.</p>
<p>I can handle a meal plan that intense and still function and still work out and still</p>
<p>work and still do all the things that I do.</p>
<p>But for everybody curious, my meal plan now is like more consistent and like stable.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a more, not that the other one was unhealthy because I was still getting everything</p>
<p>I needed.</p>
<p>I was just functioning on a lot less of what I was used to.</p>
<p>My meal plan now is like more stable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more relaxed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more maintainable without so much discomfort like the other one.</p>
<p>But like going from the meal plan with 30 carbs to my one now, I think I&rsquo;m at like 150,</p>
<p>200, something like that.</p>
<p>Going from that to this, I felt like my meal plan, like my new one with 150 carbs was like</p>
<p>godsend.</p>
<p>I feel so good on this meal plan now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, shit, like it seems easy even though it is significantly less than what I started</p>
<p>eating before.</p>
<p>Like I was eating 3,000 calories a day, 250, 300 grams of carbs.</p>
<p>Now I eat 2,200 calories a day, if that, and 150 grams of carbs.</p>
<p>Do not try and follow my meal plan because my body is different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 6'7&quot;.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s body is different.</p>
<p>Do not try and follow my numbers because you might get fat because I need a lot more than</p>
<p>normal people do.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just telling you guys this for reference.</p>
<p>Like what I was used to, this dramatic change I had of like misery and then jumping to what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at right now, the meal plan I&rsquo;m at right now is significantly lower than how I was</p>
<p>used to before I started with this coach, but it feels better because I was in such</p>
<p>a deficit and I had such a struggle with that first meal plan that beat my fucking ass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in a deficit with my new one.</p>
<p>I feel good about being in this deficit because I experienced such a drastic deficit.</p>
<p>I desensitized myself to like a minimal deficit.</p>
<p>So this one feels good.</p>
<p>Like this feels great.</p>
<p>I love the meal plan I have right now even though it&rsquo;s a lot lower than what I started.</p>
<p>It really is so strange like how all this works, but it really is just about desensitizing</p>
<p>yourself and coming up with a new feeling state and a new like form of what&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about your perspective on it.</p>
<p>You have to experience contrast to know how good you have it a lot of the times.</p>
<p>So basically show yourself it can be worse by adding more shit to yourself and what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to grow, put more pressure on yourself.</p>
<p>Do more like you&rsquo;re capable of so much more than you think.</p>
<p>You can push the fuck out of your body.</p>
<p>You can accomplish so much more and do so much more.</p>
<p>Everyone is so fucking lazy nowadays and everyone acts like you will just break and like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fragile and like you&rsquo;ll die.</p>
<p>Like bitch, you can function tired.</p>
<p>You can function ready to fucking die.</p>
<p>Oh my God, you&rsquo;re not as fragile as you think and I&rsquo;m just going to shut the fuck up with</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Another thing I had to switch was my sleep.</p>
<p>I used to sleep nine hours a night.</p>
<p>Now I sleep seven if I&rsquo;m lucky, like six and a half, seven hours and it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>fucking busy.</p>
<p>But like getting so busy in the beginning when I went from sleeping like eight, nine</p>
<p>hours a night, when I was not able to get enough sleep, like what my norm was of like</p>
<p>nine hours, eight hours, when I wasn&rsquo;t able to get that, I felt so like fucked up and</p>
<p>like tired and like, Oh, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like I was just like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the type that gets in that attitude where like if I don&rsquo;t sleep right and if things</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going right, I&rsquo;m like, fuck it all and I just want to like ruin it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But being so fucking busy and consistently not having enough time to sleep got me used</p>
<p>to a lot less sleep.</p>
<p>So now I feel well fucking rested off seven hours of sleep.</p>
<p>I can get up and do a whole fucking day and function work from the time I wake up to the</p>
<p>time I go to bed on six and a half, seven hours of sleep.</p>
<p>But no Adderall, it just takes a minute to adjust to, but you&rsquo;re capable of so much more</p>
<p>than you think.</p>
<p>And I just want to like reiterate that and scream it and everybody&rsquo;s face like you have</p>
<p>so much more than what it takes and you are capable of so much more.</p>
<p>And the more you expose yourself to shit that you feel like you can&rsquo;t handle once you start</p>
<p>handling it and you commit to finding the way through, not the way out.</p>
<p>That is where like your true self esteem, your true self trust and like your true confidence</p>
<p>will come from is when you start doing a lot of shit and rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just buckle under the pressure.</p>
