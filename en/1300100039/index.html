<p>stage how many people listen to the podcast it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this the ability</p>
<p>that you have when everybody went crazy was</p>
<p>a huge audience and there&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;d say like 60</p>
<p>of them 70 of them</p>
<p>said they listen to the podcast yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy so it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s only gonna</p>
<p>keep doing that it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>only as long as you make</p>
<p>things that people</p>
<p>think are interesting it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>gonna like this is this is radio</p>
<p>this is this is just as</p>
<p>powerful as any</p>
<p>radio station that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>existed without the bullshit and the drama</p>
<p>yeah nothing</p>
<p>and all that shit</p>
<p>this is just straight up talking</p>
<p>what the fuck happened to that kid</p>
<p>all right there we are i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>terrible camera man looking</p>
<p>sharp brian&rsquo;s off</p>
<p>yeah brian is off in ohio</p>
<p>with his lady friend all right meeting the family</p>
<p>beautiful having a good goddamn time</p>
<p>getting the</p>
<p>freak on what&rsquo;s wrong with eddie bravo</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>eddie bravo&rsquo;s eddie bravo</p>
<p>what do you know strange character</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny you all understand eddie bravo when the</p>
<p>tenth planet reality show comes to light</p>
<p>tenth planet riverside bitches respect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny because i was talking to you on the</p>
<p>phone last week</p>
<p>and you said that you went to see a shitty movie</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re one of the few people</p>
<p>like me that take a shitty</p>
<p>movie and make it work for us</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying like we really make it work for us</p>
<p>we see what the bad</p>
<p>points are and you said you</p>
<p>watch the expendables or whatever</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird how we</p>
<p>learned that</p>
<p>from paul mooney we had a conversation once about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a comedian</p>
<p>you should get</p>
<p>entertained</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll tell you something</p>
<p>the last two weeks i&rsquo;ve done something</p>
<p>that has blown me</p>
<p>apart i want to see a different form of</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>i want to watch</p>
<p>eddie bravo teach</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entertainment and the way that</p>
<p>place is the way you sit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a big fucking</p>
<p>stage like if i had</p>
<p>one man show i</p>
<p>would do it there with the mats</p>
<p>facing everything</p>
<p>and i started</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>and the first week he</p>
<p>taught this move where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hitting the guy and then you roll and</p>
<p>take his leg and the guy gives you an arm so you have</p>
<p>three different options</p>
<p>and then last week he was</p>
<p>when you were there by the way</p>
<p>you know the fucking move just</p>
<p>gotta let it</p>
<p>go like this</p>
<p>and you hit him you&rsquo;re on his back</p>
<p>so you take this leg</p>
<p>and you hook double hook on this leg and you pull over</p>
<p>so you take his arm</p>
<p>from spider web</p>
<p>yeah oh no no the truck</p>
<p>really cool really cool but</p>
<p>just the way</p>
<p>eddie was teaching yeah</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>george come on dog if i didn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>i thought you were just making shit up</p>
<p>i thought you were</p>
<p>just being funny</p>
<p>cause in the beginning of the dvd</p>
<p>you know because at that</p>
<p>point you didn&rsquo;t really know the</p>
<p>system at all so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the beauty of it is you were just talking</p>
<p>about not of the living dead</p>
<p>and then i flip</p>
<p>you with the butterfly hooks and then</p>
<p>no no so last week you</p>
<p>start on the guy&rsquo;s back with your two hooks in</p>
<p>you get the guy in the head</p>
<p>he thinks you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna choke him out</p>
<p>and you flip over you so you got this leg</p>
<p>you take it</p>
<p>to the truck baby</p>
<p>got the truck</p>
<p>and it was really</p>
<p>weird how i went home and it fucked at me</p>
<p>then i was doing doing comedy it affected you like if</p>
<p>it fucked with me like like i thought</p>
<p>about it when i left there</p>
<p>and then i went the</p>
<p>other night</p>
<p>which was a very simple hold</p>
<p>where it was completely</p>
<p>controlling the guy with the</p>
<p>underhook which you really good at he said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>george sonoroplus is</p>
<p>in town he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been in town for the last two weeks so we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>focusing on</p>
<p>over hook butterfly</p>
<p>stuff to rubber</p>
<p>guard so but the</p>
<p>point being that situation was that</p>
<p>i was very intrigued</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>thank you i don&rsquo;t get intrigued by dick</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t go see avatar</p>
<p>all these movies don&rsquo;t do dick to me well when</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>at something when</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s really good at something and really good at</p>
<p>speaking about that something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always fascinating but how he walks he keeps it</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t like a</p>
<p>stand up comic</p>
<p>he walks in a certain area</p>
<p>so people have to look at and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s doing he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how just being him he commands attention</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s not a big guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a flamboyant guy</p>
<p>but i couldn&rsquo;t take my fucking eyes off are you gay for</p>
<p>eddie no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still like you&rsquo;re gay for</p>
<p>eddie i&rsquo;m talking</p>

<p>i gotta put that up</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t go off i love let me tell you something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see what we</p>
<p>mean it was</p>
<p>funny because i said i read something that</p>
<p>dana had mentioned that what&rsquo;s his name choked</p>
<p>and i started</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>kenny flooring</p>
<p>and i thinking</p>
<p>about i said you know what</p>
<p>how can i say that about</p>
<p>a guy that i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>tried what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>like this is to the</p>
<p>point point in my life</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>i could never say somebody choked</p>
<p>you know maybe had a bad day</p>
<p>or then i started</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>here like six bad days you know what i</p>
<p>never said he choked on him like that all i said was</p>
<p>i was fucking</p>
<p>all i said was he was as</p>
<p>skinny as jesus</p>
<p>well people will see exactly what you said when they</p>
<p>watched the episode well</p>
<p>you know what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>funny so what</p>
<p>it is for the people who don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about joey does this</p>
<p>breakdown of the</p>
<p>ufcs as joey karate</p>
<p>was a cuban</p>
<p>black belt and it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>a ufc fan it&rsquo;s probably the funniest fucking</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the funniest</p>
<p>possible most</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>reviews of ufc previews</p>
<p>and reviews</p>
<p>sometimes we review</p>
<p>a show sometimes</p>
<p>there is nothing out there fuck espn</p>
<p>fuck all that ht nut shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nobody</p>
<p>that brings the fire like joey</p>
<p>all that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entertaining to a</p>
<p>point but i don&rsquo;t know how many times i</p>
<p>fucking turned it off halfway through</p>
<p>mma live and half</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you hear joey do it fuck you</p>
<p>fucking wanted to last</p>
<p>30 minutes and i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>two or three or</p>
<p>three and three</p>
<p>might pick some</p>
<p>money you understand because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned from these guys</p>
<p>and i know what it is to get beat up</p>
<p>so i watch these</p>
<p>fights and that&rsquo;s how i pick the</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve been like two other</p>
<p>three lately with the two</p>
<p>key matchups always being money</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m not that fucking</p>
<p>bad no you&rsquo;re very good you&rsquo;re very accurate with it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to see that many guys talking</p>
<p>about fights and</p>
<p>analyzing fights</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a lot of guys i like to listen to dude i want funny</p>
<p>yeah you know what i i respect</p>
<p>everybody out there doing to me</p>
<p>personally i don&rsquo;t get nearly as much insight from</p>
<p>like any articles or any commentators i get it from</p>
<p>mma forums i</p>
<p>think dudes</p>
<p>have more opinions and better opinions and better</p>
<p>points of view</p>
<p>on mma forums</p>
<p>absolutely interactive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some very good writers</p>
<p>guys who write on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys who</p>
<p>write on the</p>
<p>underground that you read</p>
<p>their shit and like this guy&rsquo;s a fucking author</p>
<p>i mean he might as well be writing for a</p>
<p>magazine this is like really well written a really well</p>
<p>written breakdown of the event of a guy&rsquo;s performance</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s to me</p>
<p>just because a guy has a job with yahoo</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make him more credible than</p>
<p>you know make fuck</p>
<p>stick one on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>just writing their</p>
<p>own exactly</p>
<p>you know this need to be official on espn com to me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interacting with people on the</p>
<p>underground and getting someone&rsquo;s opinion</p>
<p>a bit more insight</p>
<p>as to how fights</p>
<p>gonna go down from that and i</p>
<p>think than any of the websites online</p>
<p>you know the one time i do like</p>
<p>hearing what a</p>
<p>fighter actually has to say</p>
<p>about a fight the one time when they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about stuff that i</p>
<p>that the public and</p>
<p>me included</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>in that fucking cage</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>very few people experience</p>
<p>fighting in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>fucking world</p>
<p>so when a guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breaking down a</p>
<p>fight and they see something a chink in that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>armor like he folds</p>
<p>or you know like maybe</p>
<p>fighters can</p>
<p>after a while some</p>
<p>fighters are</p>
<p>known as folders</p>
<p>right they just fold</p>
<p>under the pressure</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>fighters see that</p>
<p>quicker than the average</p>
<p>person so i like that kind of insight yeah there</p>
<p>was a time when i was doing commentary with randy and</p>
<p>a dude got poked in the eye</p>
<p>and the referee</p>
<p>went over to him and he said can you see</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like man i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>could see and</p>
<p>randy got angry</p>
<p>randy goes you</p>
<p>never tell him you can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>he goes if he tells him he can&rsquo;t see it means he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t wanna fight</p>
<p>and i was like whoa he got like really intense</p>
<p>like his crazy</p>
<p>like you know a competitive</p>
<p>drive came out when he was discussing this</p>
<p>other guy that&rsquo;s fascinating yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>yeah but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna hear like it</p>
<p>a bunch of analysts sitting around</p>
<p>going what he has to do is</p>
<p>click we just got to keep the fight</p>
<p>standing shut up shut up</p>
<p>stop it stop it i want to hear you</p>
<p>i see cock suckers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going my man</p>
<p>the caveman</p>
<p>geico guida</p>
<p>take down ground and</p>
<p>pound it&rsquo;s all happening dog</p>
<p>you ain&rsquo;t stopping it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i want to hear that kind of</p>
<p>stuff i do enjoy inside</p>
<p>mma though i</p>
<p>watch that shit all the</p>
<p>time because i</p>
<p>bring in some some cool fighters</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a boss written</p>
<p>fan to the yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>hysterical and the craziest</p>
<p>right you know what i mean</p>
<p>baz is insane</p>
<p>they let an insane man</p>
<p>host a fucking show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious we</p>
<p>flew we flew to</p>
<p>boston on the same</p>
<p>plane we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the same flight he&rsquo;s nice as fuck one of the nicest</p>
<p>guys i&rsquo;ve ever met so roz</p>
<p>is super crazy nice</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also crazy</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>plane right so boss is on the</p>
<p>plane and he goes up to use the restroom</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>ladies that&rsquo;s working for the</p>
<p>plane is like</p>
<p>are you here for the wrestling</p>
<p>thing you know and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yes mixed martial arts went there for</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>and she tells him</p>
<p>that her husband</p>
<p>has hands that he</p>
<p>or her boyfriend</p>
<p>has hands that he had registered as a deadly weapon</p>
<p>and boss became obsessed with this</p>
<p>boss is like this is not true</p>
<p>you know i told her bullshit</p>
<p>you know boss</p>
<p>is like telling me that he told her bullshit</p>
<p>we got off the</p>
<p>plane he was</p>
<p>still down she&rsquo;s telling me</p>
<p>her boyfriends</p>
<p>hands are registered</p>
<p>as a deadly weapon i&rsquo;m like no fucking way</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>super amped up about this</p>
<p>oh yeah i mean</p>
<p>just listen to some of the shit he said on</p>
<p>pie awesome</p>
<p>oh my god he&rsquo;s got like</p>
<p>at least 15 to 20</p>
<p>classic lines like</p>
<p>you want to put that shit on a loop</p>
<p>and on top of that</p>
<p>crazy shit badass</p>
<p>fighter i mean he was one of the</p>
<p>one of the premier</p>
<p>strikers in mma</p>
<p>during his era</p>
<p>like when he took out to</p>
<p>yoshikosaka</p>
<p>watch that fucking fight</p>
<p>watch that fight</p>
<p>where he won the</p>
<p>title he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t actually one of the</p>
<p>title that was the</p>
<p>first fight he had in the ufc</p>
<p>on the posters it said</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest martial</p>
<p>artist that&rsquo;s how they were</p>
<p>bringing him in</p>
<p>as the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest martial artist</p>
<p>and boss just</p>
<p>fucked up to</p>
<p>yoshikosaka just</p>
<p>blasting him</p>
<p>like there wasn&rsquo;t very many dudes who were</p>
<p>striking like that in the ufc and</p>
<p>kosaka&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>tough as fuck dude</p>
<p>tough as fuck</p>
<p>boss was a savage man his</p>
<p>his attack man he could kick</p>
<p>so fucking hard</p>
<p>i remember when he</p>
<p>first fought in pancreas</p>
<p>all these dudes were kind of doing the same kind of</p>
<p>thing the pancreas</p>
<p>is they had open hand slaps you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t allowed to punch</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t kicking very good they just were kind of like</p>
<p>they take a guy down and dive on leg locks</p>
<p>all these shin</p>
<p>pads and these</p>
<p>shoes on like you</p>
<p>could grab a hold of a dude&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>pretty easy and a lot of dudes were doing leg locks</p>
<p>boss root and came out of nowhere</p>
<p>blasting dudes with kicks</p>
<p>just boom you</p>
<p>would see them hit</p>
<p>these guys they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like what the fuck is he doing and the palm</p>
<p>strikes these japanese</p>
<p>guys weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>they were just slapping each</p>
<p>other and grappling</p>
<p>he said wait a</p>
<p>minute we could slap hmm</p>
<p>how about i fucking</p>
<p>slap you really fucking hard so he came in and he was</p>
<p>fucking iron</p>
<p>palming don&rsquo;t what he was doing was boss</p>
<p>could pull his hand way back</p>
<p>so he was basically just</p>
<p>punching you</p>
<p>with this he was</p>
<p>using all his</p>
<p>punch techniques</p>
<p>but he was hitting</p>
<p>you with the you know the meat of your hand</p>
<p>which really is better because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt your knuckles</p>
<p>your hands don&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>you can hit some shit really hard</p>
<p>like that he was</p>
<p>knocking people out with</p>
<p>these slaps the japs</p>
<p>crush anybody out but his</p>
<p>uppercut slaps</p>
<p>knocking dude</p>
<p>senseless you know what&rsquo;s crazy is i</p>
<p>went to amsterdam</p>
<p>with baz root and dude when i</p>
<p>in 2001 i commented</p>
<p>for a show called too hot to handle in holland</p>
<p>while i was working for king of the cage and pride</p>
<p>they fucking hired me</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the same flight we&rsquo;re all in the same flight he</p>
<p>lived in la</p>
<p>and this is when he was</p>
<p>crazy as fuck</p>
<p>gonna get into detail what happened</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>bust them out</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s known as a</p>
<p>crazy wild man yes on the fucking</p>
<p>plane was a</p>
<p>crazy wild man on the</p>
<p>plane and i can&rsquo;t get into details but god damn</p>
<p>damn it when we get to holland</p>
<p>we partied all fucking</p>
<p>i was i have</p>
<p>about a hundred</p>
<p>pictures of me and boss</p>
<p>all fucked up in holland</p>
<p>jack everywhere</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>begin to tell you do you remember any of it</p>
<p>i remember all of it well i remember a lot of shit</p>
<p>thanks to pictures</p>
<p>cause we took a lot of</p>
<p>pictures but and then you</p>
<p>watch the pictures and you go is it</p>
<p>weird how your memories become</p>
<p>memories of the</p>
<p>pictures you</p>
<p>know what i mean</p>
<p>you actually remember that</p>
<p>those are your memories the picture</p>
<p>well memories are only relevant</p>
<p>if you use em</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a memory that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to come up it&rsquo;s really hard to retrieve</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t have any emotional</p>
<p>like bearing in your life</p>
<p>like i have memories from my</p>
<p>early childhood because they were like</p>
<p>strong moments that meant something to me i</p>
<p>learned something from that</p>
<p>experience but if like a regular memory just</p>
<p>hanging out with somebody</p>
<p>how long do you remember that for</p>
<p>good memories</p>
<p>i remember a lot of</p>
<p>dude as i get</p>
<p>older i feel like i have less room on my hard</p>
<p>drive i feel like i got an old hard</p>
<p>drive that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>filled up with shit</p>
<p>i remember the dumb</p>
<p>stuff but i do remember the important stuff</p>
<p>i got a question for you joe</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think out of</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve heard and</p>
<p>about pancreas</p>
<p>i mean what do you</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>think but ken shamrock told me</p>
<p>ken shamrock told me came out of his</p>
<p>mouth that all</p>
<p>those pancreas</p>
<p>fights were worked</p>
<p>that were set up</p>
<p>except all except</p>
<p>for when foreigners fought each</p>
<p>other they would just let them fight</p>
<p>wow but when it was japanese against</p>
<p>a foreigner</p>
<p>like he said he</p>
<p>was he actually worked for the japanese</p>
<p>he was in pancreas</p>
<p>as their american</p>
<p>to fight so they can mix it in with the europeans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said he said</p>
<p>i was brought in you had to be really good</p>
<p>you said the same thing</p>
<p>yeah because he said he was</p>
<p>you had to be really really good because you had</p>
<p>you know if you had</p>
<p>if they asked you to take them to like the</p>
<p>later rounds or whatever take them late into the</p>
<p>fight you had to be good enough too because</p>
<p>sometimes the foreigners didn&rsquo;t know they were fixed</p>
<p>he said the foreigners didn&rsquo;t always know</p>
<p>but we would control it like we were</p>
<p>so the foreigners</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to make sure you just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>knock them out</p>
<p>you know something</p>
<p>with them they were trying to</p>
<p>create characters and do different shit what</p>
<p>would they do if the foreigner got hurt</p>
<p>dude this is</p>
<p>just all i don&rsquo;t know if this is true or not so</p>
<p>is it all about gambling is that what it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but x</p>
<p>fights i mean if it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about predicting the outcome is it like pro</p>
<p>wrestling with</p>
<p>fighting what is it</p>
<p>i think it was i</p>
<p>think it was a</p>
<p>half pro wrestling half real</p>
<p>you know what i mean i think that&rsquo;s a pancreas</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know man this is what ken shamrock yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t know i wouldn&rsquo;t know because i do know one</p>
<p>thing that fucking</p>
<p>frank shamrock against alan goes</p>
<p>that shit was real that was pancreas</p>
<p>was it and that was real as fuck do you</p>
<p>know that no i don&rsquo;t remember that fight at all damn</p>
<p>was it good alan goals was all over frank shamrock</p>
<p>really but you could if you grab the rope</p>
<p>if you got to let go the hold and start again</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t fucking hold if you can grab the rope</p>
<p>so weird alan</p>
<p>goes alan goes was all all over</p>
<p>frank shamrock</p>
<p>frank shamrock just started right he had she was so</p>
<p>green he really didn&rsquo;t know jiu jitsu that well</p>
<p>he was just a real</p>
<p>natural athlete</p>
<p>powerful strong</p>
<p>he was always explosive he was just a fitness fucking</p>
<p>powerhouse and he knew some some shit from ken shamrock</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t that good at that point</p>
<p>and alan goes</p>
<p>was all over him and if it wasn&rsquo;t for the ropes</p>
<p>he would have fucking</p>
<p>but at the end</p>
<p>frank shamrock got him in a fucking foot lock dude</p>
<p>and alan goes couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reach the rope</p>
<p>and he fucking jacked him and</p>
<p>broke his ankle</p>
<p>really yeah but it was like a draw i</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t remember exactly if</p>
<p>it was a disqualification</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know there was something at the end</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know who won</p>
<p>but i do know alan goes was all over him</p>
<p>but he got saved</p>
<p>frank shamrock kept</p>
<p>saving the ropes and then at the end he got him in an</p>
<p>ankle lock man and alan goes</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t defend</p>
<p>right and he</p>
<p>broke it i mean</p>
<p>he screams alice</p>
<p>screams i was surprised if</p>
<p>frank shamrock retired</p>
<p>i was surprised you got real commentator for the</p>
<p>strike force but he&rsquo;s not hasn&rsquo;t retired</p>
<p>he said he retired he had a</p>
<p>big oh dude he retired ceremony</p>
<p>dude he had a big ceremony</p>
<p>stood in the middle of the octagon and</p>
<p>you know how many times ozzy retired</p>
<p>you know how many times</p>
<p>i was born exactly</p>
<p>how many farewell tours technically</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had several farewell</p>
<p>to farewell</p>
<p>okay so you</p>
<p>think can you think frank shamrock</p>
<p>getting in that cage just bowing everybody&rsquo;s public</p>
<p>stunt yeah eventually he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>and make it like it&rsquo;s a really big deal he&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say it was a publicity</p>
<p>stunt because</p>
<p>maybe he believes he&rsquo;s really retiring</p>
<p>but i believe</p>
<p>and he hasn&rsquo;t made that much</p>
<p>money he hasn&rsquo;t made that much</p>
<p>money and you have all these</p>
<p>boxes that have</p>
<p>made gazillions and boxing happens all the time</p>
<p>all these four</p>
<p>boxes are made gazelle you get used to the money</p>
<p>damn if i fight</p>
<p>again that could</p>
<p>fight for like</p>
<p>dude i can make</p>
<p>five like two hundred thousand dollars like</p>
<p>that means a lot to</p>
<p>these guys these guys aren&rsquo;t rich</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll come back</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll always come</p>
<p>back i think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in his late thirties i believe he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 37 you know</p>
<p>even guys with millions come back for the money</p>
<p>yeah and he didn&rsquo;t make millions well he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart guy though</p>
<p>you know but i respect</p>
<p>him i&rsquo;m not saying this i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>i think he could do anything and i</p>
<p>think if he decides that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to compete anymore why</p>
<p>should he compete</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not as hard</p>
<p>anymore and he feels like his performances reflect that</p>
<p>why not just</p>
<p>step down why not stop doing it if you can get over it</p>
<p>the real problem with</p>
<p>fighters is at a certain</p>
<p>point in time your</p>
<p>self esteem and your</p>
<p>self worth evolves</p>
<p>completely around your ability to</p>
<p>fight and beat people up</p>
<p>and when you can&rsquo;t do it anymore you feel like a loser</p>
<p>a lot of guys</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know who they are</p>
<p>when they stop competing because it&rsquo;s such an intense</p>
<p>experience that a</p>
<p>giant chunk of</p>
<p>their life is</p>
<p>dedicated to getting really good at it</p>
<p>to getting good at</p>
<p>fighting their</p>
<p>whole life revolves around</p>
<p>their fighting</p>
<p>and then when they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fighting it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re lost</p>
<p>like when i was doing comedy and i was sucking</p>
<p>one of the best</p>
<p>things that happened to me is i tore my acl</p>
<p>and the reason being is i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>train i couldn&rsquo;t do anything and</p>
<p>i certainly couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight and i needed an operation</p>
<p>but it took</p>
<p>competing as an option away from me</p>
<p>i was 21 years old</p>
<p>and it took it away</p>
<p>now i was like i can&rsquo;t compete anymore</p>
<p>my legs fucked okay so now</p>
<p>i do have to concentrate on the next</p>
<p>phase of my life because</p>
<p>otherwise the thing</p>
<p>about martial arts was this is the only</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;d ever done that</p>
<p>i was good at</p>
<p>so i would do</p>
<p>other things that suck at them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like but i&rsquo;m good at this what the fuck am i doing</p>
<p>why am i getting away from this my</p>
<p>brain would be like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do something and be terrible at it</p>
<p>do something</p>
<p>to be good at it even if there&rsquo;s no fucking</p>
<p>money in it no future in it you know</p>
<p>you can get really</p>
<p>really really attached to the idea of who you are and</p>
<p>being a fighter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for</p>
<p>those guys to step away</p>
<p>you can call it the</p>
<p>glory everybody says it&rsquo;s the glory</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s far more complicated than that it&rsquo;s who they are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>sudden their life is not</p>
<p>wrapped around</p>
<p>training camps</p>
<p>and preparing and improving your</p>
<p>skills to face the next</p>
<p>level and to get to the top and</p>
<p>get your title back once you&rsquo;ve lost it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that anymore now it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a regular dude</p>
<p>well if you</p>
<p>were just a regular dude there&rsquo;s nothing sad</p>
<p>about being a regular dude</p>
<p>but i guess if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>fighter and you</p>
<p>go to become</p>
<p>just being a</p>
<p>regular dude for a lot of them it&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>much to handle they don&rsquo;t want them in a normal life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re wired for fucking craziness</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wired for that extreme experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just hard to walk away from huh dude</p>
<p>i mean nothing</p>
<p>could feel better than beating someone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>winning the belt</p>
<p>in the ufc main</p>
<p>card when chocolate dominos</p>
<p>those arms back and yeah i mean</p>
<p>what feels better than that</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>it looks like you&rsquo;re the number one guy on the planet</p>
<p>chuck would do that and</p>
<p>throw his arms back it looks like he&rsquo;s got like the</p>
<p>whole fucking like you</p>
<p>should be glowing</p>
<p>yeah like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lightning bolt</p>
<p>like the universe</p>
<p>of course you get addicted to that when</p>
<p>you need that that</p>
<p>field when he</p>
<p>smashed he oh</p>
<p>and you know and</p>
<p>after it was over he was so</p>
<p>fired up because</p>
<p>tito talks so much shit</p>
<p>chuck is like the nicest guy in the world but</p>
<p>if you talk shit</p>
<p>chuck liddell</p>
<p>is the last person you want to</p>
<p>talk shit because he just wants to take it out on you</p>
<p>he wanted to take it out on</p>
<p>tito so bad</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>knocked him out</p>
<p>and he fucking</p>
<p>threw his arms back wow</p>

<p>very aggro but</p>
<p>chuck did get in his face</p>
<p>oh dude check that</p>
<p>right in his</p>
<p>face and shut him down</p>
<p>fucking registered with the fbi</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>black guys and</p>
<p>their cousins you ever noticed that</p>
<p>when i was a</p>
<p>white karate guys</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist when i was a kid growing up</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>black and you were talking about</p>
<p>bruce lee was always that</p>
<p>black guy said listen</p>
<p>i got a cousin who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black belt who&rsquo;s got his hands registered with the yeah</p>
<p>actually have your hair only black guys exactly</p>
<p>maybe 20 years ago i think if you had a</p>
<p>i think if you had a black belt karate</p>
<p>in some states</p>
<p>you had a register your hands</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been the case</p>
<p>but you never heard about that i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>about that people heard about it but it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just things that people make</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>place that makes you</p>
<p>register your hands as deadly weapon are you sure i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>almost positive</p>
<p>a hundred percent we got</p>
<p>a hundred i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a lot ninety</p>
<p>i think somewhere</p>
<p>i was very sure this is not true</p>
<p>no he does not</p>
<p>boss is very upset</p>
<p>or professional fighter</p>
<p>and something ever goes down</p>
<p>you always lose because that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>the case that&rsquo;s roger work that thing</p>
<p>everybody thinks he was in the right that guy that</p>
<p>knocked out that chicken but</p>
<p>things have changed now i think</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>20 years ago there was something there was some states</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a video there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video of that guy being an aggressive douchebag i know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the evidence is it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s card</p>
<p>off in texas</p>
<p>yeah well the guy the guy punch this chick in the face</p>
<p>like just it&rsquo;s the beginning of the</p>
<p>video and the guy just</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s filming it looks like he just got</p>
<p>lucky and caught this on tape</p>
<p>but this big</p>
<p>black dude he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>like a quarter</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here nothing</p>
<p>just hold it like a mic</p>
<p>nah i&rsquo;m not in the mood i&rsquo;m over here hanging</p>
<p>relaxing this big big guys like 250</p>
<p>fucking giant muscles walks up to this chick and just</p>
<p>blasts her in the face and sucker punches her</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like what the fuck</p>
<p>the dude&rsquo;s so big nobody wants to do anything well</p>
<p>roger queerte gets right up to the guy and goes hey man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got his hands up like this</p>
<p>man you just knocked out a girl</p>
<p>and the guy&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>knock out any</p>
<p>bitch i want i&rsquo;ll knock your</p>
<p>bitch ass out</p>
<p>and the guy took his shirt off</p>
<p>so roger werte goes alright i</p>
<p>guess we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>roger werte takes his shirt off and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of scramble in the camera it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tough to see what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>seconds later</p>
<p>maybe four maybe five the dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unconscious on the ground and</p>
<p>roger wert just beaten down on him</p>
<p>just bla bla bla</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like karma like a movie</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s an action hero he&rsquo;s like spider man</p>
<p>he just blasts</p>
<p>this dude out of nowhere and they all got it on video</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t say anything because the guy hit a check</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the perfect scenario</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like here&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>using his martial arts for good</p>
<p>unquestionably</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s in a place</p>
<p>where a guy assaults a woman and</p>
<p>hits her with a sucker punch</p>
<p>he confronts the</p>
<p>man with his hands up in a passive way like this like</p>
<p>hey man what the fuck you just</p>
<p>knocked out a girl like</p>
<p>surely there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be a reason for this</p>
<p>you know yeah that girl killed my</p>
<p>mother you know what i&rsquo;m saying you know you never know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>knock out any</p>
<p>bitch ass i want i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>knock your bitch ass out too</p>
<p>and roger werrick</p>
<p>kicks his ass and it&rsquo;s all on</p>
<p>video i love it</p>
<p>roger worth the captain save a hoe</p>
<p>love it give him a cape</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he meant to do it i</p>
<p>think he couldn&rsquo;t help himself</p>
<p>you know that guy went through a lot of</p>
<p>abuse when he was a kid</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very sensitive to bullies i</p>
<p>think when he sees a situation like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like you have to step in and do something</p>
<p>like that girl just got</p>
<p>punched i mean</p>
<p>even if it was for a reason</p>
<p>what could it have been i mean</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reason to walk up to a chicken sucker</p>
<p>punch you drown your</p>
<p>puppy what the fuck</p>
<p>you know what is it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why</p>
<p>would i sucker punch a chick let me think</p>
<p>she would have had to</p>
<p>have the keys to the nuclear bomb she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you know what if</p>
<p>she stole my fucking phone i would fucking</p>
<p>if she stole my phone i would sucker punch</p>
<p>her really yeah that&rsquo;s all it takes a girl has to</p>
<p>steal your phone and you&rsquo;ll sucker punch i fucking</p>
<p>wow you&rsquo;re very close with your phone</p>
<p>he loves his phone</p>
<p>no my laptop my laptop</p>

<p>haven&rsquo;t lost</p>
<p>the last time</p>
<p>wait for three days for you to call me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i didn&rsquo;t call you in boston</p>
<p>how many numbers you</p>
<p>think you can</p>
<p>store in your</p>
<p>brain me yeah</p>
<p>anybody bro in the old days because of my cocaine</p>
<p>and my criminal</p>
<p>shadow on numbers written on</p>
<p>papers my mom</p>
<p>never wrote</p>
<p>papers when my</p>
<p>mother died that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>never talk to my</p>
<p>sister anymore</p>
<p>because my mom had all</p>
<p>those numbers in</p>
<p>their head you know jay z does all</p>
<p>those wraps in his head</p>
<p>on paper in your fucking head man that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy insanity</p>
<p>you do need a</p>
<p>paper from time to time</p>
<p>i like no i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>about long time</p>
<p>where i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write any of my comedy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe he don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he don&rsquo;t use a paper</p>
<p>you got a right yeah</p>
<p>i got notes</p>
<p>like a motherfucker</p>
<p>we all forget</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s i forget man</p>
<p>what i think is happening</p>
<p>joey is much more complicated than that</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s not that this is making us</p>
<p>soft i think this is</p>
<p>becoming a part of us</p>
<p>when you leave your</p>
<p>phone at home and i</p>
<p>leave my phone</p>
<p>at home and i go out and i realize i don&rsquo;t have my</p>
<p>phone on me i feel</p>
<p>like something&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>yeah i feel like</p>
<p>i feel vulnerable</p>
<p>i feel vulnerable</p>
<p>you walk in your door you pick up your</p>
<p>phone and i called you big fucking deal you missed</p>
<p>it feels feels good something</p>
<p>about think</p>
<p>about it think</p>
<p>about when you walk in</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t had your phone on</p>
<p>and you open it up and you</p>
<p>think all this is all this fucking knowledge</p>
<p>gonna be in there and</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s nostalgia</p>
<p>for the past i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re moving towards an era</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>phone numbers they&rsquo;re on this device that controls</p>
<p>everything in your life and it</p>
<p>might even be a part of your body i think</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t hold on to the past</p>
<p>things are changing they&rsquo;re obviously changing</p>
<p>in our lifetime the internet has made</p>
<p>things radically different just in our lifetime</p>
<p>we have had more change</p>
<p>in our lifetime</p>
<p>than hundreds and hundreds of years in the past</p>
<p>just in a few decades</p>
<p>i think this all this computer and</p>
<p>technology and shit it&rsquo;s not making a soft it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>becoming a part of us and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna i</p>
<p>think in some way it&rsquo;s gonna help</p>
<p>human beings evolve well two years from</p>
<p>now when the average bombed the fucking</p>
<p>tower of the</p>
<p>satellites and we got no</p>
<p>phone and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck on fucking</p>
<p>trying to call me</p>
<p>cocksucker you&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>i had a fucking</p>
<p>no joey&rsquo;s number my</p>
<p>you know right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the least of my</p>
<p>worries when the world ends</p>

<p>i understand go kill a</p>
<p>rabbit that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>ready for that shit that&rsquo;s why i got those</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i hang out with the brothers and vermont and</p>
<p>shoot so now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go hunting with</p>
<p>ricky schroeder</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make it a reality special</p>
<p>eddie bravo</p>
<p>me and ricky schroeder</p>
<p>out hunting and the only animal i&rsquo;ve ever killed was</p>
<p>if you count</p>
<p>like i set up a</p>
<p>mouse trap and you know what i mean yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;d be down for that though</p>
<p>right go hunting with</p>
<p>ricky schroeder fuck</p>
<p>yeah we should film that right</p>
<p>get a life that</p>
<p>would be interesting you and i</p>
<p>super baked in the woods with guns what</p>
<p>if i was really high i</p>
<p>think i would be better at hand i&rsquo;m just kidding</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be high with a gun the same woods as</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>yeah how dare you yes you would</p>
<p>not that&rsquo;s okay i</p>
<p>would not do that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do the rubber guys got</p>
<p>22 on his fucking</p>
<p>you have to be very careful i read this article online</p>
<p>about i was researching hunting in</p>
<p>hunting exits in maine</p>
<p>because i used to have this joke</p>
<p>about hunting in maine and i was like i wonder what</p>
<p>the real numbers were like how many people actually got</p>
<p>shot well the real problem is</p>
<p>experience hunters</p>
<p>they literally see deer</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see a deer</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll pull the</p>
<p>trigger and then</p>
<p>after they pull the</p>
<p>trigger they realize it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman in a red jacket it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>their mind plays</p>
<p>tricks on them</p>
<p>because a seasoned</p>
<p>hunter has to get so good at recognizing movement</p>
<p>there he is</p>
<p>i got the opening boom pull the trigger</p>
<p>so their brain</p>
<p>literally puts an</p>
<p>image of a deer in</p>
<p>front of them when they see motion</p>
<p>your brain tries to</p>
<p>already give you the</p>
<p>image before it even gets it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for it so bad you&rsquo;re looking for it so bad that your</p>
<p>brain makes you visualize a deer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the deer</p>
<p>and these guys</p>
<p>literally say they saw a deer</p>
<p>and the most horrible</p>
<p>night how often</p>
<p>does that happen all the time</p>
<p>really yeah that&rsquo;s a problem the problem is experienced</p>
<p>hunters experience hunters who just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just used to</p>
<p>knowing that you have to</p>
<p>capitalize on a</p>
<p>quick opening there&rsquo;s the opening bang</p>
<p>oh my god it&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>like that shit&rsquo;s real man well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the scariest</p>
<p>thing about hunting</p>
<p>so laughing</p>
<p>is hunters that don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and you know people accidentally</p>
<p>shooting people it happens all the time you got</p>
<p>experience hunters out there</p>
<p>30 the other</p>
<p>experience other</p>
<p>experience so some</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>gonna get shot that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re saying i was with the</p>
<p>article that i was reading was</p>
<p>about this guy was an investigator and he was out there</p>
<p>like investigating people who were shot</p>
<p>and you know they had this one guy that he</p>
<p>think was a suspect and the guy was an experienced</p>
<p>hunter and he just you know was asking</p>
<p>the guy like hey you know you see anything anything</p>
<p>going on you know we got we got a situation</p>

<p>house every day for a week</p>
<p>just pause in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>house stop look at him</p>
<p>drive four or five days</p>
<p>later the dude cracked</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>

<p>guilt of accidentally</p>
<p>shooting somebody</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re hunting</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re seeing a deer</p>
<p>so i talked to the guy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the guy said once he finally confessed</p>
<p>he said i really thought it was a</p>
<p>purse i mean i really thought it was an animal</p>
<p>i saw an animal i saw the horns i saw the whole</p>
<p>thing i saw a buck with a big rack and i pulled the</p>
<p>trigger and it was a person let&rsquo;s go do that</p>
<p>and tape it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want a</p>
<p>heart to it let us</p>
<p>talk suckers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i want to go hunt i want to hunt the fucking</p>

<p>crazy yeah but i don&rsquo;t want to eat some my shot oh i do</p>
<p>see why that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why not why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>see that fucking hole in his head why</p>
<p>would you want the animal</p>
<p>to die in some</p>
<p>fucking factory farmer they get</p>
<p>their brain</p>
<p>smashed by a piston and you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>living in cow shit all day for most of their life</p>
<p>until that happens i just don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>shoot in that</p>
<p>you know what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to either but i eat meat and i love it i had a</p>
<p>juicy fat fucking</p>
<p>steak last night it was delicious</p>
<p>i love me man</p>
<p>i love it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a part of being a</p>
<p>human being i love</p>
<p>pussy but you don&rsquo;t see me</p>
<p>shoot but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it has to</p>
<p>laugh i love</p>
<p>pussy you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see me shoot a</p>
<p>bitch in the head i like your</p>
<p>logic cocksucker even though i</p>
<p>would love it</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>shoot an animal</p>
<p>i know you don&rsquo;t know god</p>
<p>bless you motherfuckers are</p>
<p>going i know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>i know you don&rsquo;t want to and i respect that and i</p>
<p>think over i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that i love you guys i don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>shooting any</p>
<p>advice i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that because</p>
<p>you eat meat i don&rsquo;t buy the argument that you</p>
<p>should have to</p>
<p>shoot an animal i don&rsquo;t buy that i think</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve allowed ourselves to somehow</p>
<p>another be removed from the process of murdering</p>
<p>slaughtering and butchering the animal</p>
<p>and we just</p>
<p>enjoy the meat</p>
<p>which is kind of</p>
<p>crazy if you really think</p>
<p>about it fucking</p>
<p>crazy so i just wanna</p>
<p>for my own personal</p>
<p>edification i just want to go and</p>
<p>experience it i want you to go outside</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we get a cow and</p>
<p>shoot it fucking in your backyard</p>
<p>well you know you</p>
<p>could you know my gardener got in</p>
<p>trouble for killing a goat in his backyard</p>
<p>what they do</p>
<p>they got mad at him they were</p>
<p>gonna evict him from the</p>
<p>house and he&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t get it he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he goes i could cook</p>
<p>right in my backyard</p>
<p>he goes why can&rsquo;t i kill a goat</p>
<p>he was like this way you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not disease it&rsquo;s safe it&rsquo;s like the safest</p>
<p>thing to him it was like so normal</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>it is normal</p>
<p>i mean why can&rsquo;t he kill it</p>
<p>how come he can cook it how come he can</p>
<p>he could it be outside with a side of beef</p>
<p>sawing off chunks nobody</p>
<p>would say a word they</p>
<p>would say wow that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>piece of beef you got there</p>
<p>but if you actually killed the cow</p>
<p>and started sawing the beef he</p>
<p>would get in big</p>
<p>trouble and i</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you got to get rid of it just it&rsquo;s gross dude</p>
<p>yeah someone rapid</p>
<p>a spanish person</p>
<p>yes max spanish to spend</p>
<p>sure we don&rsquo;t give a fuck yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s i mean the way he was talking about it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>would this is</p>
<p>silly like come on</p>
<p>this is that i want to make sure my meat is good</p>
<p>you know i know the animals not diseased</p>
<p>when i was a kid in miami my uncle would get the pigs</p>
<p>bring them up</p>
<p>free them for a couple of weeks</p>
<p>yeah then fucking kill him while we were there horrible</p>
<p>i stopped eating pork for a</p>
<p>while because i saw that</p>
<p>movie my brother&rsquo;s keeper did you ever see that no i</p>
<p>heard about it it&rsquo;s a documentary</p>
<p>about these guys that were kind of slow and</p>
<p>one of them i</p>
<p>think got accused</p>
<p>of murder or something like that but anyway</p>
<p>in the documentary</p>
<p>they live on a farm</p>
<p>i believe in upstate new york i forget</p>
<p>and the guy went</p>
<p>to kill one of the pigs and he pulls out the shotgun</p>
<p>and the pig</p>
<p>starts running</p>
<p>that pig knows what the fuck is</p>
<p>going down pigs are</p>
<p>smart they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>smarter than dogs</p>
<p>so when this pig sees that shotgun he just</p>
<p>starts fucking running and squealing</p>
<p>and scrambling the guys chasing</p>
<p>after him finally</p>
<p>gets the gun to his head and blows his</p>
<p>brains out but like</p>
<p>while before it happens that pig is in</p>
<p>utter sheer terror</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about that i&rsquo;m like man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i wanna</p>
<p>experience that</p>
<p>like why am i eating pigs</p>
<p>when was the last time i ate</p>
<p>bacon i eat it all the time</p>
<p>i gave up i gave</p>
<p>up it didn&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>very long listen but for a</p>
<p>while i was like cows are dumb fuck them they&rsquo;re stupid</p>
<p>but really the shit that you&rsquo;re supposed to eat i</p>
<p>think is the</p>
<p>smart shit i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re supposed to eat fish not</p>
<p>smart but difficult to</p>
<p>catch fish and</p>
<p>game you know</p>
<p>those are hard to catch like</p>
<p>cows and pigs are just sitting there laying around</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not the best for you</p>
<p>i appreciate your argument and i know when i</p>
<p>ate a piece of meat</p>
<p>that some cows hanging upside down with a fucking</p>
<p>thing in his neck</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see it i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>but by me going hunting</p>
<p>which i really couldn&rsquo;t do anyway</p>
<p>it would just make my life</p>
<p>i am saying i don&rsquo;t even like venison</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like none of that shit i feel scallopini of the</p>
<p>certain fucking italian makes it to me in east coast</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>feel like a</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and i eat it and i</p>
<p>make believe i don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck i&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like eating</p>
<p>pussy with your</p>
<p>coked up and</p>
<p>drunk that i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>guys i eat meat because of my necessities and stuff</p>
<p>fish you know</p>
<p>chicken i eat and even though like i know they&rsquo;re</p>

<p>rich neighborhoods you know you can&rsquo;t be</p>

<p>three and four</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>the kids are like fucking stray dogs</p>
<p>in poor neighborhoods</p>
<p>right dude when i</p>
<p>was living with</p>
<p>my grandfather in newark</p>
<p>when i was living with my grandfather in newark</p>
<p>they would be playing</p>
<p>stickball in the middle of the</p>
<p>street you would have to stop</p>
<p>and whatever they&rsquo;d be playing</p>
<p>soccer in the middle of the street</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be playing</p>
<p>mostly with</p>
<p>puerto ricans and</p>
<p>dominicans and</p>
<p>stuff in new york</p>
<p>you would literally have to stop your car</p>
<p>wait in order to get through to</p>
<p>where you wanted to go</p>
<p>the street cars coming</p>
<p>stop everybody</p>
<p>would stop the game for a</p>
<p>second we did that car</p>
<p>would drive by</p>
<p>they restart the game</p>
<p>every goddamn day playing football</p>
<p>in the street with car that was a</p>
<p>story of my life</p>
<p>bunch of poor</p>
<p>fucking mexican kids</p>
<p>no one had a dad</p>
<p>ninety percent of all the kids</p>
<p>were like fucking the little rascals dude on my fucking</p>
<p>block it was</p>
<p>it was a couple guys i like ten and eleven</p>
<p>once my stepdad left at ten</p>
<p>i was gone i was on the streets my mom couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control me and my brother</p>
<p>stepdad could</p>
<p>but once i was</p>
<p>10 we were on the fucking streets and it was like</p>
<p>two three dudes at 10</p>
<p>my brother at 14 and 15</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>had some 18 19 year olds and some 20 and we were all</p>
<p>mixed in playing football</p>
<p>organizing she were always on the</p>
<p>street playing</p>
<p>basketball game</p>
<p>bunch of mexicans</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all in the rock and</p>
<p>eric was in the rush</p>
<p>no one had a dad everyone&rsquo;s dad was gone</p>
<p>except for one audio</p>
<p>but fuck man</p>
<p>it was a plan i did it with</p>
<p>ice cream truck</p>
<p>ice cream truck oh</p>
<p>that was part of our life</p>
<p>playing football</p>
<p>on the fucking street</p>
<p>and ice cream</p>
<p>truck coming by</p>
<p>that was that was</p>
<p>irish italian neighborhood</p>
<p>and we played fucking</p>
<p>everything on the</p>
<p>street from</p>
<p>stick ball to</p>
<p>football and then when their</p>
<p>leaves came down that&rsquo;s when you played two hand touch</p>
<p>and we put the</p>
<p>bricks in the middle of the</p>
<p>street and you pile the</p>
<p>leaves on top of it</p>
<p>and some dickheads driving with his car</p>
<p>oh my god and he</p>
<p>kicked the fuck out</p>
<p>we were fucking animals there when i</p>
<p>lived in jamaica</p>
<p>plain when we</p>
<p>first moved to boston we</p>
<p>moved to a bad neighborhood we</p>
<p>moved to this</p>
<p>place jamaica</p>
<p>plain one of</p>
<p>those streets</p>
<p>where you would</p>
<p>on the street</p>
<p>there was like</p>
<p>maybe 15 20 kids that</p>
<p>would live on the</p>
<p>street and they</p>
<p>would be hanging out in the middle of the</p>
<p>street all night</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>watching tv they&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>ten feet in</p>
<p>front of your window</p>
<p>screaming at each</p>
<p>other yelling</p>
<p>drinking beer</p>
<p>throwing shit oh shit summer</p>
<p>nights nobody</p>
<p>went to bed</p>
<p>nobody went to bed</p>
<p>when it was a blizzard</p>
<p>when there was a</p>
<p>blizzard everybody was out in the</p>
<p>street fucking riding</p>
<p>taking sleds</p>
<p>taking sled</p>
<p>rides down the hill</p>
<p>it was crazy my mom couldn&rsquo;t control us</p>
<p>we had a thing called bombing</p>
<p>where everyone</p>
<p>would get together late at</p>
<p>night we&rsquo;d get in camo</p>
<p>climb lemon trees filled backpacks with lemons</p>
<p>and then we climb in</p>
<p>other trees and we&rsquo;d be all camouflaged in a tree</p>
<p>and when cars</p>
<p>would come by</p>
<p>fucking throw</p>
<p>lemons at them</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would stop dude</p>
<p>would come out</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>hiding in the fucking trees man</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>never find us we were all camouflage we love camouflage</p>
<p>but we would practice jumping fences</p>
<p>and escape routes</p>
<p>we knew everybody&rsquo;s backyard and everyone&rsquo;s fence we</p>
<p>would practice</p>
<p>so if we got chased too</p>
<p>cops would even come by cops</p>
<p>chases but they couldn&rsquo;t catch us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gone in the backyard through the fences we were</p>
<p>going through the you know i had this conversation with</p>
<p>brian cowan yesterday i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have it</p>
<p>again with you guys too because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all the same in the</p>
<p>three of us that</p>
<p>we were kind of like left to our own devices</p>
<p>you know do you</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think every interesting person that i know</p>
<p>almost all of them were not raised</p>
<p>by the parents they&rsquo;re all like raised like wild dogs</p>
<p>they all like figured out</p>
<p>their way through the</p>
<p>world like they made a good relationship with</p>
<p>their mother</p>
<p>you know but they don&rsquo;t really see her that</p>
<p>often she didn&rsquo;t really teach them</p>
<p>things they kind of figured</p>
<p>things out on their own</p>
<p>i for sure did</p>
<p>man i was me and my brother on the streets</p>
<p>my mom just had to work all the time she worked</p>
<p>all the goddamn time if you have like if</p>
<p>you had like a really cool dad who was like a christian</p>
<p>who was like you know like</p>
<p>real like republican but</p>
<p>super nice guy you</p>
<p>could have thought like that</p>
<p>if your dad raised you like that</p>
<p>and brought you</p>
<p>along like that who knows you</p>
<p>could have who knows i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>do you think that</p>
<p>would have been different my</p>
<p>brain gets programmed right your</p>
<p>brain gets programmed by the people that around you</p>
<p>especially you know your</p>
<p>influences and your</p>
<p>teachers and your father of course is</p>
<p>gonna be the biggest</p>
<p>teacher in your life</p>
<p>if your father was a really nice guy and a</p>
<p>sweet guy and</p>
<p>a fun guy and</p>
<p>a loving father and a christian</p>
<p>and like really gung</p>
<p>ho rah rah republican</p>
<p>the united states</p>
<p>would never do a bad</p>
<p>thing to us</p>
<p>you could be sucked into that way of</p>
<p>thinking don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think no you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so because you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>and you grew up wild</p>
<p>you grew up your parents died</p>
<p>young you were you were really on your own</p>
<p>and in a lot of ways when you were</p>
<p>taken in by people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s generosity like your</p>
<p>friends and yeah i had a mom till fourteen and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for see what</p>
<p>fourteen is</p>
<p>very young thing</p>
<p>my mom was pro american dog</p>
<p>right here she was</p>
<p>had a bookmaking bank it was involved in heroin</p>
<p>right but i&rsquo;m saying</p>

<p>experience of talking in</p>
<p>front of those people that you probably</p>
<p>never would have done</p>
<p>stand up or</p>
<p>stand up something</p>
<p>that was in the back of your head anyway</p>
<p>it was in the back of my head the prison really</p>
<p>woke the animal up because</p>
<p>you thought</p>
<p>about it before i</p>
<p>had thought</p>
<p>bro because you had to be</p>
<p>funny before prison anybody who</p>
<p>heard the niggas</p>

<p>for that point</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t you know i always thought</p>
<p>about that my life deserve more than to</p>
<p>spend it in here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what prison did for me bro</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t if people come up to me go how bad was prison</p>
<p>prison is how bad you make it for me</p>
<p>for fucking me</p>
<p>and open my eyes i became a</p>
<p>stand up comic</p>
<p>yeah it just</p>
<p>gave me that opportunity to see by the way you see</p>
<p>the show about that dude that</p>
<p>robbed millions what&rsquo;s that guy&rsquo;s name two years ago</p>
<p>guy that went away</p>
<p>the puns he schemes</p>
<p>if you get a chance</p>
<p>watch that on fucking</p>
<p>msnbc what is this show on</p>
<p>msm party made off yes</p>
<p>where they took a</p>
<p>free show from</p>
<p>north carolina now</p>
<p>he went right in and teamed up with the fucking mob he</p>
<p>paid people</p>
<p>he don&rsquo;t give a fuck that guy</p>
<p>about people well you talked into</p>
<p>did people have to tell you that you were</p>
<p>funny that you</p>
<p>should go on</p>
<p>stage did people tell you that you</p>
<p>should do that</p>
<p>yeah tell us</p>
<p>about the first time on stage</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the first time</p>
<p>i would consider the</p>
<p>first time he was on</p>
<p>stage the okay</p>
<p>the first time</p>
<p>outside of prison right the</p>
<p>first time because</p>
<p>my first time on</p>
<p>stage was an open mic</p>
<p>night but before i went to the open mic night</p>
<p>it was a locker room</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>i like your first</p>
<p>night officially as a comedian</p>
<p>is an interesting one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s here yours</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m so curious</p>
<p>about yours the</p>
<p>truth is the</p>
<p>truth of the matter</p>
<p>is now you get down with it you don&rsquo;t remember about a</p>
<p>month now come on dog</p>
<p>about a month ago i got a call from a friend of</p>
<p>mine and we were talking</p>
<p>that i hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talked to i hooked up with him on facebook and he said</p>
<p>something to me goes bro i knew on that bus ride home</p>
<p>that you always</p>
<p>gonna be an</p>
<p>entertainer and i</p>
<p>asked michael</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about he goes</p>
<p>do you remember</p>
<p>after freshman</p>
<p>basketball you</p>
<p>would get on the bus and fucking go off</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>he goes it got to the</p>
<p>point where the bus drivers</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t pick you up anymore</p>
<p>because we used</p>
<p>to go on and do the theme from the odd couple</p>
<p>and then i would go into a fucking</p>
<p>twenty minutes skit</p>
<p>all the way</p>
<p>we got to the</p>
<p>thing and i even</p>
<p>wrote a blog</p>
<p>about it that</p>
<p>after he told me that like i called a</p>
<p>bunch of people from</p>
<p>those days and i go bro</p>
<p>what do we used</p>
<p>to do on the bus now like you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>we used to take over fucking buses the number one bus</p>
<p>90th street to 38th street</p>
<p>we ran and you were the fucking host of mc</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like wow and i</p>
<p>started thinking i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>so if i really go to that that was</p>
<p>freshman year</p>
<p>basketball wow</p>
<p>where i used to</p>
<p>light the buses up</p>
<p>every time and they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>pick i remember that like being out there</p>
<p>for two different bus drivers and they</p>
<p>would pick you up because you guys are too fucking loud</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>but then in</p>
<p>school you know</p>
<p>no one ever considers that</p>
<p>maybe this guy</p>
<p>should be a</p>
<p>stand up comedian</p>
<p>they just go we got a silence him we got to stop this</p>
<p>we got to teach some discipline to you</p>
<p>the lack of discipline is really what makes someone a</p>
<p>comic though</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t a stand up at all like in that</p>
<p>sense like growing up but i was always</p>
<p>every year i was always</p>
<p>depending on the</p>
<p>teacher i had</p>
<p>cause junior high</p>
<p>in high school you have like</p>
<p>seven teachers</p>
<p>i was always</p>
<p>the dude to</p>
<p>start shit play</p>
<p>pranks and always</p>
<p>unless the teacher</p>
<p>was mr enders you</p>
<p>never did shit you just fucking</p>
<p>he was a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker he goes you</p>
<p>wanna act up</p>
<p>you wanna talk</p>
<p>we talked about this before in the podcast</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s mr anders</p>
<p>mr anders 10th grade</p>
<p>i think geology i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to tell you know the</p>
<p>funny thing</p>
<p>about someone</p>
<p>becoming a comic is there&rsquo;s no one who</p>
<p>could have pulled you aside</p>
<p>and said what you really need to do is become a comic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you almost have to</p>
<p>experience all this resistance</p>
<p>to your personality to regular life</p>
<p>then that forces you into being a comic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like someone</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just come up to you and go this is what you</p>
<p>really need to do you really need to be a comic like</p>
<p>you need to go through all the bullshit in life to</p>
<p>experience that before someone comes</p>
<p>along and tells you you know</p>
<p>how old were you when you</p>
<p>first got on stage</p>
<p>thirty thirty</p>
<p>twenty nine i was</p>
<p>i was 21 it would have been better if i was 30</p>
<p>cause when i was 21 i didn&rsquo;t have shit to say</p>
<p>i have no opinions about anything can a 15</p>
<p>year old comedian</p>
<p>stand up to</p>
<p>me because there&rsquo;s a lot of guys yeah they can be</p>
<p>funny can they be funny they can be</p>
<p>funny if that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>my problem was when i was 21</p>
<p>my whole life from 15 to 21</p>
<p>was all just taekwondo</p>
<p>tournaments and kickboxing that&rsquo;s all i did that was 24</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>that was all i thought</p>
<p>about i didn&rsquo;t really consider the world</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t want to be a</p>
<p>loser and i wanted to be really</p>
<p>good at taekwondo and i wanted to win the nationals and</p>
<p>i wanted to compete in the olympics i had all</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about fucking politics i had no clue</p>
<p>as to what was</p>
<p>going on in the</p>
<p>world i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think about it for a</p>
<p>second all i thought</p>
<p>about was this</p>
<p>and getting laid that&rsquo;s all i thought about</p>
<p>so when i started</p>
<p>going into comedy i</p>
<p>literally had no opinions</p>
<p>i know how to</p>
<p>kick somebody i know how to kick somebody in the head</p>
<p>and i know i like pussy hmm</p>
<p>so all the jokes were</p>
<p>pussy jokes</p>
<p>jokes were sex jokes for like the</p>
<p>first year and a half</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>wrote cause</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m 21</p>
<p>years old what the fuck kind of opinion did i have</p>
<p>that was interesting on anything if i told you anything</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>other than sex or kicking somebody in the head</p>
<p>you would already know what i was</p>
<p>gonna say way in advance</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t have enough life</p>
<p>experience my life</p>
<p>experience is very limited</p>
<p>i hear that a lot that people too</p>
<p>young to sing</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re 30</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the kind of comedy you do</p>
<p>where you look at you</p>
<p>look at you you</p>
<p>stupid fuck</p>
<p>you know you do that kind of comedy where you</p>
<p>point some shit out</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t point some shit out at 21</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>was i gonna listen to you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna listen you</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re some</p>
<p>super genius</p>
<p>and even then it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>gonna be funny</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i just i wrestled with it for a</p>
<p>while i was a roofer after i got locked up</p>
<p>i roofed for one week</p>
<p>roofed for fucking two or three years i saw some cause</p>
<p>i went to school and then</p>
<p>so i was sick and tired of people telling me try it and</p>
<p>i was getting breakfast one morning opened up a</p>
<p>paper and there was</p>
<p>be a stand up comedian</p>
<p>class for 33</p>
<p>and i took it</p>
<p>i was not funny at all</p>
<p>i was not a funny person i wasn&rsquo;t funny</p>
<p>until i started doing taekwondo</p>
<p>and we would</p>
<p>fight and compete</p>
<p>in tournaments and everybody be nervous</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be nervous even in a locker room when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to go work out</p>
<p>cause somebody</p>
<p>might just get kicked in the face and</p>
<p>knocked out it happened all the time guys</p>
<p>got knocked out in</p>
<p>class all the time they get kicked in the face</p>
<p>and you would get</p>
<p>fucking terrified and so i was always</p>
<p>cracking jokes to</p>
<p>break detention</p>
<p>i was always the guy who was doing</p>
<p>impressions of</p>
<p>other people on the team that was</p>
<p>the first time</p>
<p>that i became</p>
<p>funny cause</p>
<p>other than that i just i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i was funny</p>
<p>i loved comedy though</p>
<p>man god damn i just thought the idea of it was so crazy</p>
<p>first time i saw richard pryor</p>
<p>live in the</p>
<p>sunset strip</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t fucking believe this guy was just talking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on stage just talking it was one of the most</p>
<p>profound moments of my</p>
<p>young life i was like 13 i think</p>
<p>i was in the audience and i was just looking around</p>
<p>and people were falling out of</p>
<p>their chairs</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s just talking</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s saying is way funnier than any</p>

<p>laughter died</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>going back and forth and</p>
<p>it was you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my story</p>
<p>about and comedy</p>
<p>by the way i</p>
<p>gotta tell joe</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re on this subject</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>i used to always tell you about</p>
<p>ups people used</p>
<p>to always tell me how they used to ship ship on</p>
<p>ups and i take them aside and go</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ship none on ups</p>
<p>because my buddies ran</p>
<p>the paramus one and</p>
<p>yes is they have a little gate</p>
<p>where they have</p>
<p>rolexes and diamonds because they ship all the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s diamonds on ups</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>and they have a gate</p>
<p>so when that</p>
<p>bell goes off that means the security gate go opens</p>
<p>and they would have</p>
<p>these conveyor belts</p>
<p>and these guys</p>
<p>would have to sort shit out</p>
<p>well mike next to</p>
<p>buddy&rsquo;s rotation</p>
<p>throw it under the conveyor belt</p>
<p>and it would get</p>
<p>stuck and rip open</p>
<p>oh dude i got shit off</p>
<p>top shit from my</p>
<p>buddy used to show up with rolex presidentials bitches</p>
<p>and they were selling for ten k cash selling</p>
<p>three a week</p>
<p>making eight fifty an hour ups selling</p>
<p>three presidents did not know there was so many getting</p>
<p>stolen because they&rsquo;re on insurance anyway</p>
<p>this is a long time</p>
<p>for surveillance cameras</p>
<p>cameras rip open</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>boxes ripped they</p>
<p>would just want to take the box and throw on the</p>
<p>floor they have tracking numbers</p>
<p>they know where it stops</p>
<p>they would take the box and throw it in the conveyor</p>
<p>belt so the belt would break it</p>
<p>box open and</p>
<p>they would say the watch got damaged it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>pieces go get it the watch was in their fucking pocket</p>
<p>with the warranty and everything</p>
<p>so a twenty thousand dollar</p>
<p>watch that you would they would sell</p>
<p>three a week these kids</p>
<p>each of them would yanking 90 grand a week out of that</p>
<p>plus diamonds</p>
<p>plus anything else that came out of fucking ups</p>
<p>those cocks</p>
<p>good old that was the</p>
<p>worst job ever</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>it was so bad</p>
<p>that the position i had i thought it was a</p>
<p>promotion like i thought it was moving up</p>
<p>up in ups and</p>
<p>the way you get into ups is hard because i was working</p>
<p>as a temp at the united</p>
<p>states post office</p>
<p>and that shit was only six</p>
<p>months or a year something like that</p>
<p>and it was coming to an end</p>
<p>so i had to get another job so i had</p>
<p>people that worked at ups they go dude</p>
<p>try ups it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be really hard</p>
<p>to get in though</p>

<p>three and i&rsquo;m like</p>

<p>thirty to seven</p>
<p>thirty and they work you four</p>
<p>hours like a fucking dog</p>
<p>but they paid you eight</p>
<p>bucks an hour</p>
<p>and minimum wage back then was</p>
<p>three thirty five so it was like</p>
<p>i want that fucking money</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>i went in there just bullshitted my way through it</p>
<p>i went to the fucking interview</p>
<p>and and they go why do you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re good for this job mom</p>

<p>three out of 30 people</p>
<p>they fucking called our name</p>

<p>how about the dr phil</p>
<p>sketch that was on the man show that was a two parter</p>
<p>remember that shit</p>
<p>on the man show</p>
<p>it was a reality when a guy that was posing as</p>
<p>a dr phil had a fake book signing and people</p>
<p>showed up and</p>
<p>thought it was</p>
<p>all kinds of crazy shit</p>
<p>like the girls were in line</p>
<p>get they didn&rsquo;t even know it was him it looks like him</p>
<p>but i probably didn&rsquo;t fool everybody</p>
<p>but man it was a</p>
<p>total punk like he</p>
<p>would say like when</p>
<p>he was signing the</p>
<p>i got some coke back in the</p>
<p>hotel room you down and girls be like</p>
<p>yeah let&rsquo;s do this</p>
<p>girls were down</p>
<p>he hit and then he was he was making moves on this one</p>
<p>chick and from</p>
<p>under the table</p>
<p>a girl came out</p>
<p>like he had been getting a blowjob and just walked away</p>
<p>and he just kept talking to me you want to party</p>
<p>get your friends let&rsquo;s go i got some coat</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>fucking down</p>
<p>it was it was so</p>
<p>funny that sketch it was so much material</p>
<p>it was the only</p>
<p>comedy it was the only man show</p>
<p>sketch that two parts</p>
<p>they did it</p>
<p>again the next</p>
<p>week there was so much material yeah yeah</p>
<p>it was too funny</p>
<p>if stan hope and i had a real show</p>
<p>where we could have really done what we wanted to do it</p>
<p>could have been very interesting</p>
<p>there was two problems with doing that man show</p>
<p>one was that</p>
<p>i was doing fear factor at the same time that was</p>
<p>crazy days way too</p>
<p>crazy days dude</p>
<p>in the middle</p>
<p>of all that</p>
<p>man show shit i&rsquo;m training</p>
<p>for abu dhabi</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking for</p>
<p>the man show depressed out of my mind it was the worst</p>
<p>from day one</p>
<p>inside i wanted to kill myself i&rsquo;m like this</p>
<p>fucking is not what i thought it was</p>
<p>gonna be well when it</p>
<p>started out</p>
<p>what it was supposed to be was supposed to be we</p>
<p>would be able to do whatever we wanted</p>
<p>the way they sold it to me was</p>
<p>explain the beginning</p>
<p>explain the beginning how they offered to you the show</p>
<p>while you were</p>
<p>on i was doing</p>
<p>fear factor and</p>
<p>they were saying we want you to take over the man show</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>with who you know</p>
<p>and they said</p>
<p>well we have a</p>
<p>short list of peoples or anybody that you</p>
<p>would want to do</p>
<p>it with and i&rsquo;m like there&rsquo;s only one guy doug stanhope</p>
<p>i go that&rsquo;s the only way it</p>
<p>would work i</p>
<p>go he&rsquo;s the only guy that&rsquo;s like that like fits</p>
<p>right in there with me like my</p>
<p>sensitivity</p>
<p>my sensibility rather</p>
<p>and so they said wow you guys</p>
<p>would be perfect you</p>
<p>could do it i&rsquo;m like but it</p>
<p>would be too</p>
<p>restrictive they&rsquo;re like no no no you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand a lawsuit</p>
<p>would be good for us the guy actually said this to me</p>
<p>he said if we got sued okay</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>great publicity</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>great and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we want to do we want to do nudity blur it out</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>swear beep it out</p>
<p>essentially you</p>
<p>could do anything that you</p>
<p>would talk about</p>
<p>and real quick</p>
<p>we already had like ten fifteen ideas for sketches</p>
<p>even before that so</p>
<p>this was like a perfect</p>
<p>thing i remember you called me go dude</p>
<p>the fuck comedy</p>
<p>central wants me to take over the man show</p>
<p>how fucking</p>
<p>crazy is that we were just</p>
<p>we were thinking</p>
<p>so anyway what happened was yeah totally</p>
<p>it was it was very strange</p>
<p>and they came up to me and they</p>
<p>basically just</p>
<p>gave us a story</p>
<p>about what they were</p>
<p>going to be able to do for us we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have some show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>completely wild you can do whatever you want</p>
<p>but once we got in there it was a</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>story they had</p>
<p>really restricted ideas</p>
<p>about what the subject matter should be</p>
<p>the guy who was the</p>
<p>executive producer wind up</p>
<p>kind of hijacking the show and taking</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>his direction</p>
<p>and this is the guy that me and doug hired</p>
<p>yes he had his own you</p>
<p>hired the head writer</p>
<p>he hated you you and him</p>
<p>you remember that right</p>
<p>yeah remember that the head</p>
<p>rider i remember you</p>
<p>going out to dinner because they were</p>
<p>before you signed you were like let me pick the head</p>
<p>rider and you said</p>

<p>bring in my guy what was your guy&rsquo;s name the ball to</p>

<p>jones none the bald guy the comedians</p>
<p>mcguire yes you wanted to</p>
<p>bring in chris mcguire and</p>
<p>maddie kersch</p>
<p>and me and they said no no whatever you want to do man</p>
<p>whatever you have</p>
<p>total power</p>
<p>you have total</p>
<p>power dude and you&rsquo;re like damn</p>
<p>and you called me and go dude they&rsquo;re giving me</p>
<p>total fucking power</p>
<p>you go well i want to be able to hire the head writer</p>
<p>you went out met with some guys and you met with</p>
<p>giannis yeah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not get too into this</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying but i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>throw tom giannis</p>
<p>under the bus i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a talented</p>
<p>guy he just did what he thought was the right show</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>well i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there in the network had real serious ideas</p>
<p>about what they wanted and you know</p>
<p>they were the</p>
<p>ones around the show and coming up with the</p>
<p>money and they had some real serious ideas</p>
<p>about what they thought was</p>
<p>funny and one</p>
<p>of them was they didn&rsquo;t want joey on the show</p>
<p>and i wanted joey to come out the beginning of the show</p>
<p>naked and introduce everybody</p>
<p>he would come out with a</p>
<p>microphone the handheld microphone</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get this</p>
<p>party started</p>
<p>and joey&rsquo;s dancing and</p>
<p>everything it was</p>
<p>probably one of the funniest</p>
<p>things we ever did and they fought to the</p>
<p>point of tears</p>
<p>this fucking chick</p>
<p>who i like very nice person she&rsquo;s executive</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s telling me</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>funny i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>how could it not be</p>
<p>funny i go you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get joey</p>
<p>diaz he&rsquo;s gonna run out</p>
<p>naked you pixelate</p>
<p>his balls the crowds</p>
<p>gonna go crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna put him</p>
<p>in the perfect mood i just don&rsquo;t see how this is funny</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see how this is funny</p>
<p>tears are coming down her eyes</p>
<p>i go we&rsquo;ll do two</p>
<p>intros we&rsquo;ll do one without it and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do one with it we do one without you go out there</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>place goes apeshit they are falling down laughing</p>
<p>it was hilarious</p>
<p>the best intro ever and i got that on camcorder</p>
<p>and so then i go to her and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i raise my hands up see told you</p>
<p>like you gotta</p>
<p>i know what i</p>
<p>think is funny</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m capable of reproducing what i</p>
<p>think is funny</p>
<p>you might not</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny on</p>
<p>paper you might not</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny as i&rsquo;m describing it to you but</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny to me</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be funny to</p>
<p>other people it just has to be but</p>
<p>these are things</p>
<p>that we have</p>
<p>executives that</p>
<p>went to college for four years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the reason chappelle quit</p>
<p>because it was</p>
<p>also the reason</p>
<p>why it turned</p>
<p>out it was the reason why adam corolla and jimmy</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel stopped doing it because</p>
<p>they they they gave up ownership of the show</p>
<p>so that they could have creative control</p>
<p>they gave up on because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired of these idiots</p>
<p>and they gave up</p>
<p>they like look look</p>
<p>look you guys can have the fucking show</p>
<p>we just want to be responsible for what gets done</p>
<p>and they for sure didn&rsquo;t want to hire me</p>
<p>they said no no no once you sign they go no this</p>
<p>eddie bravo has no tv</p>
<p>experience why the fuck do we want him on the show</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to hire chris mcguire and pot</p>
<p>it out but no</p>
<p>the problem was they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what</p>
<p>i was trying to do i was trying to i was like look</p>
<p>he says funny shit he comes up with some</p>
<p>funny ideas</p>
<p>he might not be like a writer</p>
<p>in as far as like he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna come up with a</p>
<p>properly formatted sketch</p>
<p>you know without</p>
<p>everything he</p>
<p>could eventually do that but for</p>
<p>right now what he&rsquo;s good at he&rsquo;s good at</p>
<p>looking at things</p>
<p>funny smoking pot coming up with</p>
<p>crazy ideas</p>
<p>and you could you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t having it they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t hearing it you had to use</p>
<p>it he wanted it to be his show</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t there enough i was doing fear factor at</p>
<p>least three days a week</p>
<p>so for three days they</p>
<p>would be running this the show and doug</p>
<p>did not feel confident enough to take over he</p>
<p>would send me messages</p>
<p>he would call me up and go do this</p>
<p>fucking hell here this is just driving me crazy this</p>
<p>just this fucking</p>
<p>stupid sketch is getting in i can&rsquo;t get this done and</p>
<p>and then the janet jackson nipple</p>
<p>thing happened and then we were fucked</p>
<p>because then</p>
<p>we already had approved they yanked out</p>
<p>they pulled</p>
<p>shit out of episodes</p>
<p>because after that janet jackson nipple fiasco</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t know who</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t in show business to</p>
<p>a lot of people was nothing</p>
<p>some chick pulls her</p>
<p>tit out in a video</p>
<p>in a super bowl</p>
<p>thing rather</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like who cares it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>gross it was stupid</p>
<p>they did something and it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>but to hollywood that cost people</p>
<p>money people</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>sponsors pulling out</p>
<p>people worried</p>
<p>about losing commercial</p>
<p>money and they acted man</p>
<p>they started</p>
<p>chopping up sketches and</p>
<p>removing bits and everybody went on a panic</p>
<p>they were all</p>
<p>sheep they just went on this</p>
<p>panic sheep run</p>
<p>banging into walls</p>
<p>tripping over themselves</p>
<p>trying to stop comedy</p>
<p>how about the</p>
<p>sketch that we</p>
<p>wrote that they</p>
<p>originally approved and they backed out of we were</p>
<p>gonna do extreme sack</p>
<p>fighting yeah</p>
<p>it was funny because i</p>
<p>never forget the day that that all went down</p>
<p>between you me and all</p>
<p>three of us</p>
<p>now i didn&rsquo;t want to fucking be there either</p>
<p>it was the worst fucking</p>
<p>thing i was around it was a bad energy</p>
<p>right it was sarah</p>
<p>bad energy and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget that i went they made me rehearse</p>
<p>like jack offs that they were</p>
<p>and the guy tom giannis came over and oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hysterical we love it</p>
<p>then the next</p>
<p>day i go there and now everybody&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about it was</p>
<p>hysterical to see all</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>educated white people</p>
<p>walking around</p>
<p>like they didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna take his balls out</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna run they</p>
<p>gotta kill and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>so they all were arguing i</p>
<p>mean you should</p>
<p>see direction</p>
<p>we want to go in this is like a fucking hard</p>
<p>they did not want joe push this</p>

<p>everything when joey came running</p>
<p>out all all bets were off they had to shut up for at</p>
<p>least that day so we had to</p>
<p>shoot two episodes</p>
<p>that day we had to</p>
<p>shoot two episodes</p>
<p>and i was gonna run through both of them</p>
<p>even after the</p>
<p>first one even</p>
<p>after they seen the laughter</p>
<p>they were like it&rsquo;s not</p>

<p>wouldn&rsquo;t put his hand like a fuck you bitch</p>
<p>and he just looked at me like he was a</p>
<p>tough guy with his friends</p>
<p>and i remember he looked for the security guard</p>
<p>to throw me out he listen to security</p>
<p>guard the security</p>
<p>guard is like</p>
<p>we just smoked a joint</p>

<p>and very very</p>
<p>deceptive no he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>no he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we fucked up i fucked up in a</p>
<p>bunch of different ways on that show</p>
<p>but i fucked up with him i did not know he was that guy</p>
<p>thought he was a different guy</p>
<p>you know he turned</p>
<p>once he got in he wanted to</p>
<p>do it his way he decided that he was running shit and</p>
<p>it was a real problem remember the date day one day one</p>
<p>we walk in and we already have we</p>
<p>think that we have two episodes already done look</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done all</p>
<p>these sketches that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about two episodes or</p>
<p>so we walked in</p>

<p>forget about that that&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>crazy and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do that shit</p>
<p>start over so</p>
<p>right well it&rsquo;s not that simple</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>simplifying</p>
<p>of course a</p>
<p>bunch of sketches they had already prepared of course</p>
<p>of course of course i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>this was day</p>
<p>fucking one</p>
<p>and day one they put me in a room with chris mcguire</p>
<p>and they go</p>
<p>write some jokes</p>
<p>about miami we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to miami</p>
<p>so now i&rsquo;m i feel like i&rsquo;m at high</p>
<p>school all day we&rsquo;re trying to come up with</p>
<p>these ideas i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>fuck we have all</p>
<p>these other ideas that</p>
<p>what the fuck are we</p>
<p>right there i&rsquo;m new like this is</p>
<p>day one the</p>
<p>first hour i&rsquo;m like oh shit</p>
<p>by the fucking time that nightmare day ended</p>
<p>joe was there all day too</p>
<p>i go joe man i just can&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>write here they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ignoring all the</p>
<p>other sketches that we did</p>
<p>and you were like yeah man</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t write here either i mean i had a writer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>block here too just not the</p>
<p>right environment</p>
<p>so that day you told</p>
<p>giannis and the producers</p>
<p>hey me and eddie are</p>
<p>gonna write</p>
<p>at home we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>relax that&rsquo;s when all the creative</p>
<p>juices come out</p>
<p>they said go</p>
<p>ahead get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still pay</p>
<p>them they just wanted to get rid of me</p>
<p>so they from</p>
<p>i only work there the</p>
<p>first day and all</p>
<p>after that was</p>
<p>working at home</p>
<p>my job was i</p>
<p>had to write</p>
<p>we got together</p>
<p>a lot too but he was really busy with fear factor so</p>
<p>if we couldn&rsquo;t get together i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>write at home i&rsquo;d have to have at</p>
<p>least one sketch</p>
<p>day so i&rsquo;m at home</p>
<p>meanwhile i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>training i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>training for abu dhabi</p>
<p>going oh my god</p>
<p>this is not</p>
<p>what i thought it was</p>
<p>going to be fuck</p>
<p>i just quit my</p>
<p>strip job my</p>
<p>strip club job</p>
<p>strip dj job</p>
<p>for 10 years now i know this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna last day</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s a disaster i&rsquo;m like oh my god either the</p>
<p>show&rsquo;s gonna get canceled</p>
<p>cause they were</p>
<p>green lighting</p>
<p>bunch of bullshit</p>
<p>every now and then occasionally something</p>
<p>would be funny like</p>
<p>the decapisac thing the</p>
<p>duck stanhope that was hilarious what we needed to do</p>
<p>with that show was we needed to have control of it doug</p>
<p>had to have control of it</p>
<p>and we had to have a producer</p>
<p>that was on the same page</p>
<p>and the other problem</p>
<p>we had with that show was that it was the man show</p>
<p>we should have been doing our own show we</p>
<p>should not have</p>
<p>been taking over someone else&rsquo;s show that&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>to me it was like a prepackaged</p>
<p>show that was like it was easy</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>being on fear factor</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really have the time to put something together</p>
<p>so this way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be all put together but it was a mistake</p>
<p>and it was disrespectful to</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel</p>
<p>and adam carroll i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think it was at the time</p>
<p>i thought they had amicably</p>
<p>parted ways</p>
<p>cause jimmy wanted to do his talk show</p>
<p>and adam wanted to do his thing</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t the case</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want the show to continue</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>anybody else to do it and it was</p>
<p>their thing really so we shouldn&rsquo;t have done the</p>
<p>first question you know i love you to all my heart</p>
<p>but is the air condition a</p>
<p>close by dog</p>
<p>like a fucking yoga</p>
<p>class in here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>way i can go out in the hallway</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna end it a couple minutes anyway</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sweating at all you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>sweat on your fucking nose no i don&rsquo;t or is that shiny</p>
<p>dude you got</p>
<p>my nose you got makeup on cock sucker</p>
<p>i got glistening god put some damage</p>
<p>oils i would have put one i</p>
<p>look slippery</p>
<p>what time is it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost five o&rsquo;clock or four o&rsquo;clock rather oh</p>
<p>you wanted to go to 420 symbolically</p>
<p>wanna end this at 420</p>
<p>or whatever i don&rsquo;t give a you</p>
<p>gonna hang in</p>
<p>there with 20 minutes without air conditioning</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s too fucking hot</p>
<p>oh fuck think</p>
<p>about what mccain</p>
<p>went through in nom</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>fuck with that cock sucker that was his choice</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i came up here to a</p>
<p>house i thought you had the air on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s on man it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t even really talk</p>
<p>about the ufc man let&rsquo;s do it what the fuck</p>
<p>oh yeah well we</p>
<p>might as well</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s what you think</p>
<p>about bj and frankie</p>
<p>edgar i thought</p>
<p>you know bj</p>
<p>the game plan like</p>
<p>when they were in between corners</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to have a game plan the game plan was like kick his ass</p>
<p>you know the game plan was like</p>
<p>but there was no leg kicks</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>i want to see it way more leg kicks i thought</p>
<p>he can land leg kicks he&rsquo;s landing them and</p>
<p>every one of</p>
<p>those leg kicks takes the spring out of your step</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with a guy who can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t catch him he&rsquo;s so fast reggie</p>
<p>edgar is a lightning bolt he&rsquo;s all over the</p>
<p>place yeah he&rsquo;s too fast</p>
<p>he was able to land leg kicks bj landed a</p>
<p>bunch of leg kicks</p>
<p>when he tried</p>
<p>but the attempts</p>
<p>were not that many</p>
<p>i know it takes a lot of energy but he</p>
<p>should have been</p>
<p>throwing a lot more leg kicks i think bj</p>
<p>tried his fucking ass off look at the</p>
<p>fifth round he went</p>
<p>after him i just</p>
<p>think frank</p>
<p>frankie edgar is that good oh no</p>
<p>doubt he&rsquo;s so fast</p>
<p>he never gets</p>
<p>tired he could do 25</p>
<p>rounds he never</p>
<p>starts so fast</p>
<p>his wrestling is top notch</p>
<p>his striking is amazing he&rsquo;s hard to hit he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to get a hold of not taking anything away from</p>
<p>frankie i just thought bj&rsquo;s game plan it just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the game plan i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with his advice the advice in the corner</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t any advice they were just give it whatever</p>
<p>kick his ass whatever that announce</p>
<p>whatever you want to call i don&rsquo;t know this from that</p>
<p>but the last two</p>
<p>fights against whatever</p>
<p>that was not the same guy seen</p>
<p>against diego sanchez there&rsquo;s something more there</p>
<p>yeah it could</p>
<p>be a lack of</p>
<p>motivation it</p>
<p>could be you know he needs to mix</p>
<p>things up well the difference</p>
<p>between the camp</p>
<p>the difference between</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>stand up and</p>
<p>diego sanchez stand up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge difference but that&rsquo;s a his hit but</p>
<p>dj hurt diego</p>
<p>early on the fight</p>
<p>that fight was over</p>
<p>it was perfect</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have any fucking tenacity</p>
<p>bj was well it</p>
<p>could be because</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>counters that tenacity with his speed</p>
<p>it could be that bj gets</p>
<p>frustrated and you know he loses</p>
<p>he gets a little disheartened we&rsquo;re seeing some</p>
<p>evolution we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>an amazing wrestler</p>
<p>with serious</p>
<p>stand because</p>
<p>for the longest time bj had the best hands at</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>no one was fucking with bj he was the best boxer</p>
<p>now frankie</p>
<p>edgar looks</p>
<p>like his technique i mean it&rsquo;s totally different</p>
<p>but it seems like he&rsquo;s just too fast</p>
<p>too good he&rsquo;s working too hard</p>
<p>and i think you know</p>
<p>maybe bj might</p>
<p>you know a switch</p>
<p>like you mentioned</p>
<p>a switch of camps</p>
<p>maybe might not hurt or add</p>
<p>something new i</p>
<p>think frank</p>
<p>jaeger is kicking it to a</p>
<p>whole other</p>
<p>level athletically</p>
<p>speed wise endurance wise the way he can move his</p>
<p>training camp must be insane he&rsquo;s a fucking worker</p>
<p>machine he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those little dudes you can&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>with someone&rsquo;s been fucking with him all of his life</p>
<p>and he built up a</p>
<p>level of tenacity</p>
<p>that not that many people can handle his</p>
<p>mentality is fucking perfect</p>
<p>is a randy coutures</p>
<p>mentality you know what i mean</p>
<p>and his cardio and his endurance and his will</p>
<p>but you know if</p>
<p>you look at like the way he moves he moves better than</p>
<p>randy oh no</p>
<p>no for sure i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the mental</p>
<p>game and you know people are saying</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s not stopping people he&rsquo;s stopping some people</p>
<p>which you have to realize though is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite a bit smaller</p>
<p>than everybody else in the division he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>154 pounds for real</p>
<p>legit i think</p>
<p>ultimately he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throwing with</p>
<p>with evil intentions</p>
<p>he just hasn&rsquo;t developed the</p>
<p>power yet but i believe</p>
<p>you know within the next couple years two</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>maybe five years</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>crushing people because he comes in</p>
<p>he comes in to</p>
<p>blast a hundred percent now with pj you</p>
<p>heard veach</p>
<p>and veach is a</p>
<p>tough guy you know</p>
<p>and he you know he</p>
<p>dropped him before he strangled him</p>
<p>and you know his</p>
<p>stand up when he was</p>
<p>fighting with sean shirk</p>
<p>he totally out kick box sean</p>
<p>sure yeah he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting</p>
<p>though the rematch with gray maynard that&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>very interesting very interesting</p>
<p>maynard&rsquo;s a hard guy to beat man</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>complain all you want about his</p>
<p>style the problem he presents</p>
<p>problems you know what&rsquo;s the solution to that problem</p>
<p>you got to be</p>
<p>able to stop him from taking you down man he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>powerful motherfucker and he&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>wrestler or you</p>
<p>gotta have a wicked fucking dustin hazlet</p>
<p>guard or something you know even more than</p>
<p>wicked than dustin</p>
<p>hazel it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>right cause dustin hazlitz couldn&rsquo;t do shit</p>
<p>against rick&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more he needs like some fucking ao</p>
<p>well well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down to 55 because he</p>
<p>should be there</p>
<p>clearly ricky story was</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>stronger than dustin hazley</p>
<p>right but so you know josh burkeman</p>
<p>strong as fuck too and</p>
<p>dustin had no problem with him</p>
<p>yeah but i think</p>
<p>ricky story is</p>
<p>stronger than</p>
<p>josh burkeman dude</p>
<p>yeah he went out he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from washington and he&rsquo;s rolled with gerald one of my</p>
<p>black belt a lot and gerald</p>
<p>can he calls me to tell me</p>
<p>about the roles with with</p>
<p>ricky story said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking amazing</p>
<p>these are so</p>
<p>powerful and good</p>
<p>very technical</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see him</p>
<p>start to develop some finishing too he&rsquo;s all into</p>
<p>evolving and adding</p>
<p>weapons to his game constantly</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s into that</p>
<p>young and he</p>
<p>shows our better</p>
<p>yeah and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his fucking mental game</p>
<p>that guy goes in there and fucking</p>
<p>he loves to destroy</p>
<p>dude can&rsquo;t react</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s up against the cages are ripping his body with</p>
<p>punches like oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to deal with you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing everything he</p>
<p>could just to stay</p>
<p>alive this guy was just</p>
<p>crushing them with punches</p>
<p>yeah i think about randy and tony</p>
<p>frankie edgar might need to go ahead</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>might to really need to</p>
<p>take his guard game to the next</p>
<p>level i was impressed with him off his</p>
<p>back man i was impressed at how he recovered when bj</p>
<p>mounted him yes yeah bj</p>
<p>mounted him</p>
<p>got a hold of them and usually you&rsquo;re dead when bj</p>
<p>mountain yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually over frankie</p>
<p>just shit fucking he&rsquo;s got so much energy man he</p>
<p>could just keeps pushing keeps pushing he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give up man</p>
<p>does not give up</p>
<p>you know some guys rest if bj</p>
<p>mounted you rest and you&rsquo;re like oh fuck now i</p>
<p>gotta get out of this but let me bide</p>
<p>my time for a big explosion</p>
<p>frankie the moment you got</p>
<p>taken down was</p>
<p>move move move move move move move move i&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>yeah obviously bj&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guard wasn&rsquo;t good enough to</p>
<p>really threaten</p>
<p>frankie edgar really</p>
<p>i mean frankie edgar</p>
<p>has great defenses</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is awesome too</p>
<p>but what i did like</p>
<p>about bj is his</p>
<p>guard recovery</p>
<p>his butterflies</p>
<p>and his foot on the hip control</p>
<p>god damn it was really beautiful to see and</p>
<p>again you know</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t really attack that much off his back</p>
<p>but his recovery</p>
<p>just amazing he really uses his flexibility well</p>
<p>and when he had both his hips on frankie</p>
<p>or both his feet on</p>
<p>frankie&rsquo;s hips</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just serious amazing yoda control you know</p>
<p>yeah i know he&rsquo;s badass in controlling</p>
<p>guys like that but not enough to finish guys</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird that bj is such a</p>
<p>jiu jitsu master but yet he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really finish guys off of his back</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s had problems in a lot of</p>
<p>fights where guys can take him down and hold him down</p>
<p>you know that was obviously the problem that george st</p>
<p>pierre fight</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s obviously the problem when</p>
<p>frankie edward</p>
<p>took him down too yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem that is</p>
<p>prevalent in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>have the answer a real</p>
<p>solid answer for the jail summons for isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>weird that BJ</p>
<p>would would not have a guard like that that he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have this ninja assassin</p>
<p>guard like Shini Aoki yeah yeah yeah yeah like</p>
<p>you know why because he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and I would say this I mean I&rsquo;ve told this to BJ</p>
<p>too I&rsquo;m like you know what</p>
<p>if you stay at 55</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really no reason to master any kind of</p>
<p>guard just get back up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking everybody you&rsquo;re better than everybody</p>
<p>standing up</p>
<p>nobody at 55 can take you down</p>
<p>even big wrestlers can&rsquo;t take you down</p>
<p>I even thought he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need a</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t really need a</p>
<p>focus on his guard</p>
<p>I thought he didn&rsquo;t need to develop an added</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>was interested in the rubber</p>
<p>guard and he fucks with it a little bit</p>
<p>you know what I mean but</p>
<p>he I&rsquo;m sure he felt like no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna put me on my fucking back</p>
<p>but maybe now</p>
<p>now that he knows like shit these</p>
<p>fighters are getting so much better and there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>wrestlers out there</p>
<p>you really have to have</p>
<p>the answer for jail sun in</p>
<p>and for like Frankie</p>
<p>Edgar and crazy</p>
<p>yeah for these</p>
<p>elite wrestlers like what he did to</p>
<p>Florian yeah</p>
<p>he took them down and got on top</p>
<p>when they talk</p>
<p>about your guard</p>
<p>the only answer</p>
<p>for the elite</p>
<p>wrestler and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all over the top 10 of every</p>
<p>UFC white division the only</p>
<p>ants or one of the only</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only a couple answers and one of them is</p>
<p>having a when they talk</p>
<p>about your guard they don&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>oh man he&rsquo;s got an okay</p>
<p>guard it&rsquo;s a decent guard</p>
<p>they have to say your</p>
<p>guard is a fucking amazing like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go in his guard</p>
<p>your guard has to be like Ryan Hall</p>
<p>your guard has to be like Shin</p>
<p>you you don&rsquo;t want to fucking be in</p>
<p>your like raid</p>
<p>like Anthony Pettitz and</p>
<p>Shane Roller when Anthony Pettitz slapped on that</p>
<p>trial exactly you have</p>
<p>to have a super</p>
<p>dangerous guard if they are not</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about your guard like it&rsquo;s amazing and it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy wicked and they</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the best guards</p>
<p>in your division</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not good enough</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the answer for the</p>
<p>elite wrestler</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>sometimes you throw up</p>
<p>a pop triangle</p>
<p>and it lands like</p>
<p>Anderson Silva made it work in the 5th round</p>
<p>Chris Lieben made that pop triangle work</p>
<p>and the Noguera</p>
<p>style of triangle it worked that works it does work but</p>
<p>um not at the highest rate</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>could do as well to add to that already game</p>
<p>you know to</p>
<p>those Noguera triangles you could</p>
<p>mix it all up there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things you can do</p>
<p>just look at what</p>
<p>Shiny Aoki has done</p>

<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about James Tony</p>
<p>I ran in James Tony I know</p>
<p>gas station</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that you lived in</p>
<p>you know the same</p>
<p>you know I was pulling for him at first William</p>
<p>well I thought that box I thought that these</p>
<p>MMA guys really didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a boxer and you&rsquo;re that high rate of a boxer</p>
<p>you know you really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these guys can hit in</p>
<p>their hands and</p>
<p>their the timing and their</p>
<p>rights and shit</p>
<p>but when I watched the</p>
<p>countdown was when I was like</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t work he got a</p>
<p>great opportunity to represent boxing</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think he worked out</p>
<p>I lost a lot of weight</p>
<p>he lost 15 pounds in 5</p>
<p>months okay</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re rolling any student lost 60</p>
<p>in a couple</p>
<p>months if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>fucking rolling and let&rsquo;s say you take this guy on</p>
<p>you got 4 months</p>
<p>the first month all you&rsquo;re doing with</p>
<p>him you&rsquo;re not working his hands they&rsquo;re already there</p>
<p>so you basically working him getting up</p>
<p>and just rolling</p>
<p>little things just</p>
<p>surviving on</p>
<p>the back right there all</p>
<p>those things all day</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>I used to go to judo when I was a kid I was</p>
<p>skinny as shit</p>
<p>because the hardest thing</p>
<p>about judo isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flipping it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>every time you get up and fucking down</p>
<p>you get up and down 50 times a day that you get skinny</p>
<p>this guy didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that he got some guy from the FBI to come in and train</p>
<p>you know what the fuck</p>
<p>did you see that shit</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m in Hollywood with Lidell I&rsquo;m rolling</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rolling with Einstein I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning the</p>
<p>basics how to bro</p>
<p>what how much can I</p>
<p>learn in 4 months</p>
<p>to get me out of a mess</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning he didn&rsquo;t know any better he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know he got a guy from the FBI that</p>
<p>God knows what they</p>
<p>fucking paid up</p>
<p>what was it what was</p>
<p>the guy who</p>
<p>trained him to kenpo</p>
<p>videos of him online</p>
<p>doing kempo</p>
<p>with the guys that come behind him and cut his legs and</p>
<p>stuff James tony&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the guy was</p>
<p>trained James Tony yeah it&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>underground I say is</p>
<p>James Tony actually doing it</p>
<p>well I mean he you know he</p>
<p>look the guy set</p>
<p>up a program for him but what does a guy know for real</p>
<p>you know what he really needed to do is go to</p>
<p>Colorado Springs and</p>
<p>train the Olympic</p>
<p>training center</p>
<p>he needed to get a guy who&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>jiu jitsu master to come with him</p>
<p>okay these guys are</p>
<p>gonna take you down you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do your best to stop to take down</p>
<p>then once they get you</p>
<p>taken down then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna work your</p>
<p>guard that&rsquo;s what you need to do I just</p>
<p>get down and</p>
<p>try to make</p>
<p>those FBI man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from the Federal Bureau</p>
<p>of my fucking</p>
<p>man down motherfucker</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>on a daily basis when I</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>countdown show what was very</p>
<p>clear to me is that the guys he was working out with</p>
<p>were letting him do</p>
<p>things for the camera</p>
<p>and that it was</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>elite grapplers</p>
<p>they were letting him do</p>
<p>things the guy</p>
<p>was like ah</p>
<p>they were like it was a demonstration like anytime</p>
<p>James rolled over like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they were</p>
<p>letting him</p>
<p>do it they were putting on a show and letting</p>
<p>James throw them around</p>
<p>yeah I was like this is</p>
<p>silly I&rsquo;m like he</p>
<p>might not know anything</p>
<p>about grappling</p>
<p>yeah there was this dude that fought Javi</p>
<p>Vasquez back in my</p>
<p>first King of the Cage show in 2000</p>
<p>he comes out and</p>
<p>claims he&rsquo;s a Brazilian Jiu jitsu</p>
<p>black belt he&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>French karate guy</p>
<p>and he thought</p>
<p>back then he just thought it was 2000 like you</p>
<p>could just say shit like that</p>
<p>and so Hobbie said</p>
<p>he said he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>training jiu</p>
<p>jitsu 12 years and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black belt under Hoist Gracie</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he was telling</p>
<p>Terry troublecock</p>
<p>I think we got a live</p>
<p>one here he calls the police Gracie Academy they never</p>
<p>heard of the guy the guy&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>scare Hobby into</p>
<p>going to the ground with him and</p>
<p>Hobby was a purple belt but</p>
<p>a did mad destroyer</p>
<p>on the local</p>
<p>Southern California</p>
<p>scene he would go to</p>
<p>Santa Santa Cruz as well and smash</p>
<p>he was the fucking</p>
<p>destroyer of the purple belts division and</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t very many</p>
<p>browns and blacks at that</p>
<p>point and he was</p>
<p>going to go against</p>
<p>this guy who</p>
<p>claimed to be a</p>
<p>black belt dude</p>
<p>hobby took him down and like the guy had no</p>
<p>training dude 0</p>
<p>he just laid flat on his back</p>
<p>and he tapped really</p>
<p>quickly how he</p>
<p>pound on him a couple times he just</p>
<p>tapped and it was over it&rsquo;s like what the fuck was that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>story but a much more interesting</p>
<p>story is the</p>
<p>other guy that we know</p>
<p>that claimed to be a Brazilian jiu jitsu</p>
<p>black belt that really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know anything that turned out to be a murderer</p>
<p>yes yeah there was a</p>
<p>dude we knew</p>
<p>his fake name was Rafael Tori</p>
<p>but his real name what was his real name</p>
<p>damn I don&rsquo;t remember but he told people</p>
<p>he he taught karate</p>
<p>did karate his</p>
<p>whole life and he</p>
<p>taught karate</p>
<p>and he told</p>
<p>people he was a</p>
<p>black belt in Brazilian</p>
<p>jiu jitsu this guy</p>
<p>Eddie was hanging</p>
<p>around with this guy you were you were he was doing</p>
<p>half Brazilian</p>
<p>he said website</p>
<p>right he was</p>
<p>a writer no</p>
<p>he was a writer he was probably one of the most popular</p>
<p>journalists back down on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>I mean Rafael</p>
<p>Torre was all over the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>it was 2000 it was</p>
<p>still in the</p>
<p>dark ages so it was easy for a guy to bust up</p>
<p>and he was on</p>
<p>speed all the time I didn&rsquo;t know this</p>
<p>until like years</p>
<p>later so he</p>
<p>would work hard dude he</p>
<p>would always have shit and</p>
<p>pride loved him he always had reports</p>
<p>he always had interviews</p>
<p>oh dude he was probably</p>
<p>one of the top 3 writers</p>
<p>in all of MMA</p>
<p>well I remember he was very</p>
<p>productive and he</p>
<p>would do you</p>
<p>know he was doing his version of gonzo</p>
<p>journalism for</p>
<p>MMA like asking MMA</p>
<p>fighters if they like anal sex</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being real crazy</p>
<p>yeah that was</p>
<p>my shit so it turned out that this dude wasn&rsquo;t really a</p>
<p>black belt at all and</p>
<p>we you know and it wasn&rsquo;t half Brazilian</p>
<p>yeah it was like it was all</p>
<p>crazy we were driving and</p>
<p>Eddie had this confrontation with him on the phone</p>
<p>to make a long</p>
<p>story short</p>
<p>homeboy winds up killing some dude strangling him to</p>
<p>death the husband</p>
<p>of this chick that he&rsquo;s banging</p>
<p>and he winds up</p>
<p>going to jail for it</p>
<p>when he was he was a murderer</p>
<p>he he got this guy for insurance</p>
<p>yeah yeah him</p>
<p>yeah the the wife</p>
<p>of this guy that he strangled</p>
<p>you know so they</p>
<p>they decided to</p>
<p>set this up and</p>
<p>he choked the guy to death</p>
<p>yeah kill the guy with a real</p>
<p>naked choice</p>
<p>how ironic is it that his</p>
<p>black belt wasn&rsquo;t legit</p>
<p>but he killed someone with a rear</p>
<p>naked choke yeah</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>poor guy the</p>
<p>poor guy killed didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>train at all and probably didn&rsquo;t even see it coming</p>
<p>he just jumped him and choked the shit out of him</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>Matt man your fucking wife is banging some</p>
<p>other dude and that dude comes to your</p>
<p>house and kills you</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t go to his</p>
<p>house he lured</p>
<p>him into his gym</p>
<p>fuck and I testified on that</p>
<p>trial did you really yes</p>
<p>you had to go to</p>
<p>court I had to go to</p>
<p>court and just finger them and they called to</p>
<p>me they called me the cops called me because I called</p>
<p>Gerald once</p>
<p>and when I was talking to Gerald on the</p>
<p>phone the phone was being tapped</p>
<p>and Gerald and I are talking</p>
<p>about you know his</p>
<p>possibility of him</p>
<p>fighting the UFC</p>
<p>whose you want to</p>
<p>fight this now</p>
<p>blah blah blah</p>
<p>and Rafael tori&rsquo;s name comes up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with</p>
<p>that dude and so Gerald was like being tapped</p>
<p>and he was like talking all</p>
<p>these different people</p>
<p>about it and then</p>
<p>everybody that he talked to on the</p>
<p>phone they had to talk to the cops</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t really know anything</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the guy I just knew the guy through Eddie</p>
<p>fortunately I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking go to</p>
<p>court about that</p>
<p>yeah so what do you have to say</p>
<p>yeah that guy&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a liar</p>
<p>basically yeah</p>
<p>I forget the questions</p>
<p>they made me ask but dude I hung out with that</p>
<p>like he was always brought in and whatever show I was</p>
<p>commentating whether it was King of the Cage or Pride</p>
<p>or even too hot to handle</p>
<p>he was always the reporter who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna blow up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>handle was in Holland</p>
<p>right yeah that&rsquo;s when I talked</p>
<p>about with the boss root</p>
<p>now Sam and boss dude and</p>
<p>he was so busy</p>
<p>so amped up on</p>
<p>speed he always had articles and</p>
<p>to blow up shows you</p>
<p>bring Raphael Torah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll blow it all up all over the Internet</p>
<p>always on speed huh</p>
<p>how did you find out he was always on speed</p>
<p>it came out later</p>
<p>you know on the trial do</p>
<p>you know Ari took</p>
<p>what is it called</p>
<p>adderall took an Adderall says it&rsquo;s the fucking</p>
<p>greatest thing ever for getting</p>
<p>things done</p>
<p>just cleaned out</p>
<p>speed did yeah</p>
<p>yeah but what is it why is it</p>
<p>speed help you get organized</p>
<p>how does that</p>
<p>work how does it give you fucking energy what the fuck</p>
<p>you feel like you</p>
<p>could do anything you just want to</p>
<p>paint the fucking house</p>
<p>you want to go to college</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s drive to fucking Louisiana</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>is it bad for you is it bad for you</p>
<p>come on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be what comes up must come down</p>
<p>right dude anything that</p>
<p>speeds you out is</p>
<p>gotta be bad for you that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super but it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>super speeds you out it makes you look really organized</p>
<p>Robert Schimmel told me once</p>
<p>he took one accidentally and he said he just</p>
<p>started organizing all of his notes just kidding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens when you do</p>
<p>speed too I would</p>
<p>think that you</p>
<p>could use that though as a tool</p>
<p>if you could</p>
<p>really make sure</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t do too much of it and didn&rsquo;t fuck up your</p>
<p>whole system</p>
<p>short circuit</p>
<p>everything like</p>
<p>every now and then we need</p>
<p>but the problem is you come down so hard</p>
<p>that you want more to come down hard</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about Adderall but anything</p>
<p>speedy that</p>
<p>goes up comes down oh yeah</p>
<p>hard we call</p>
<p>buddy was on it every day</p>
<p>are you what does he say</p>
<p>buddies on he said he loves it helps him</p>
<p>organize helps</p>
<p>him work and he&rsquo;s pretty fucking ambitious he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a hard</p>
<p>worker but he said he was just really listless and</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get anything</p>
<p>going on and you know and they got him on the Adderall</p>
<p>and then Bam</p>
<p>you know he just couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focus and constrain on things</p>
<p>he just had a hard time committing to</p>
<p>things and constrain who knows</p>
<p>maybe it works different than</p>
<p>speed because</p>
<p>speed somehow</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works really</p>
<p>well by a Phoenix</p>
<p>speed and that&rsquo;s the fuel</p>
<p>of the capitalist society</p>
<p>I mean look we&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>people who drink coffee</p>
<p>every day in</p>
<p>every union contract they have</p>
<p>they negotiate a time</p>
<p>where you could take a drug</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking coffee break</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>union contracts have coffee break time</p>
<p>what is a coffee</p>
<p>break coffee</p>
<p>breakers in your work it&rsquo;s fucking 11 a</p>
<p>m it&rsquo;s not quite</p>
<p>lunch yet coffee</p>
<p>truck pulls up</p>
<p>and you get a chance to take fucking 5 10 minutes off</p>
<p>and fuel up on some</p>
<p>some stimulants</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for the company you come back all</p>
<p>jazz and charge</p>
<p>and you feel better you work harder you feel better</p>
<p>and you feel like you got another little</p>
<p>break you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>union things is one</p>
<p>thing they figured out that was smart</p>
<p>you know look</p>
<p>everybody doesn&rsquo;t have to be a</p>
<p>slave like people will go</p>
<p>against unions say</p>
<p>unions fuck up business and union</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t work hard and they make too much</p>
<p>money and blah blah blah</p>
<p>they make work</p>
<p>easier and that&rsquo;s good right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good to have people work like fucking slaves</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if</p>
<p>they got a little bit less done but everybody was more</p>
<p>happy wouldn&rsquo;t that be better</p>
<p>if they get a nice coffee</p>
<p>break and get to</p>
<p>relax for an hour for lunch</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;re getting tortured all day</p>
<p>you know maybe if they got some shit to do during lunch</p>
<p>they can go somewhere and fucking pay a Bill</p>
<p>or you know pick up a fucking</p>
<p>thing that they were supposed to buy you</p>
<p>know how fast do</p>
<p>those hours go by god damn it</p>
