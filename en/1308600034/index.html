    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Anna Lemke.</p>
<p>Dr. Lemke is a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and the chief of the Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a psychiatrist who treats patients</p>
<p>struggling with addiction.</p>
<p>She has successfully treated patients</p>
<p>dealing with drug addiction, alcohol addiction,</p>
<p>and behavioral addictions,</p>
<p>such as gambling and sex addiction,</p>
<p>as well as other types of addiction.</p>
<p>In fact, during our discussion,</p>
<p>I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors</p>
<p>and substances to which people can become addicted to,</p>
<p>and that there is a common biological underpinning</p>
<p>of all those addictions.</p>
<p>I also learned that there&rsquo;s a common path</p>
<p>to the treatment and recovery</p>
<p>from essentially all addictions.</p>
<p>Dr. Lemke explained that to me</p>
<p>and explained how to think about</p>
<p>and conceptualize our own addictions,</p>
<p>as well as the addictions of other people</p>
<p>who are struggling to get treatment,</p>
<p>move through treatment,</p>
<p>and stay sober from their addictions.</p>
<p>In addition to treating patients,</p>
<p>Dr. Lemke is an author</p>
<p>and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The Social Dilemma.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out</p>
<p>called &lsquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The book comes out August 24th</p>
<p>and is an absolutely fascinating read into addiction</p>
<p>and ways to treat various types of addiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the book cover to cover,</p>
<p>and all I&rsquo;ll tell you is that at the very first chapter</p>
<p>and throughout, you are going to be absolutely blown away.</p>
<p>The stories about her patients are extremely engaging.</p>
<p>It brings forward the real struggle of addiction</p>
<p>and the incredible, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say heroic battles</p>
<p>that people fight in order to get through addictions</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>And all of that is woven through with story,</p>
<p>with science and ways that make it very accessible to anyone</p>
<p>whether or not you have a science background or not.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough.</p>
<p>So again, the book is &lsquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It comes out August 24th of this year, 2021.</p>
<p>And you can pre-order that book by going to Amazon.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to that in the show caption.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I just want to mention</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Great to have you here.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you.</p>
<p>I and many listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are obsessed with dopamine.</p>
<p>And what is dopamine?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>We all hear that dopamine</p>
<p>is this molecule associated with pleasure.</p>
<p>I think the term dopamine hits,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m getting a dopamine hit from this,</p>
<p>from Instagram or from likes or from praise</p>
<p>or from whatever is now commonly heard.</p>
<p>What is dopamine?</p>
<p>And what are maybe some things about dopamine</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and probably that I don&rsquo;t know either?</p>
<p>So dopamine is a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters are those molecules</p>
<p>that bridge the gap between two neurons.</p>
<p>So they essentially allow one neuron,</p>
<p>the presynaptic neuron,</p>
<p>to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>Dopamine is intimately associated</p>
<p>with the experience of reward,</p>
<p>but also with movement,</p>
<p>which I think is really interesting</p>
<p>because movement and reward are linked, right?</p>
<p>If you think about early humans,</p>
<p>you had to move in order to go seek out the water</p>
<p>or the meat or whatever it was.</p>
<p>And even in the most primitive organisms,</p>
<p>dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment.</p>
<p>For example, C. elegans, a very primitive worm.</p>
<p>So dopamine is this really powerful,</p>
<p>important molecule in the brain</p>
<p>that helps us experience pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really, really important one.</p>
<p>And if you wanna think about something</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t know about dopamine,</p>
<p>which I think is really interesting,</p>
<p>is that we are always releasing dopamine</p>
<p>at a kind of tonic baseline rate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really the deviation from that baseline</p>
<p>rather than like hits of dopamine in a vacuum</p>
<p>that make a difference.</p>
<p>So when we experience pleasure,</p>
<p>our dopamine release goes above baseline.</p>
<p>And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline.</p>
<p>And then we experience a kind of pain.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So is it fair to say that one&rsquo;s baseline levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>how frequently we are releasing dopamine</p>
<p>in the absence of some, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>drug or food or experience, just sitting, being,</p>
<p>is that associated with how happy somebody is,</p>
<p>their kind of baseline of happiness or level of depression?</p>
<p>There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed</p>
<p>may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really reasonable thought.</p>
<p>And there is some evidence to suggest that that may be true.</p>
<p>The other thing that we know,</p>
<p>and this is really kind of what the book is about,</p>
<p>is that if we expose ourselves chronically</p>
<p>to substances or behaviors that repeatedly release</p>
<p>large amounts of dopamine in our brain&rsquo;s reward pathway,</p>
<p>that we can change our tonic baseline</p>
<p>and actually lower it over time</p>
<p>as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,</p>
<p>which is more really than we were designed to experience.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And is it the case that our baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are set by our genetics, by our heredity?</p>
<p>Well, I think, you know, if you think about sort of,</p>
<p>you know, the early stages of development in infancy,</p>
<p>certainly that is true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of, you know,</p>
<p>born with probably whatever is your baseline level,</p>
<p>but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact</p>
<p>on where your dopamine level ultimately settles out.</p>
<p>So if somebody&rsquo;s disposition</p>
<p>is one of constant excitement and anticipation</p>
<p>or easily excited,</p>
<p>these are, I think, about the kind of people where you say,</p>
<p>hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>And other people are a little more cynical,</p>
<p>harder to budge, like my bulldog Costello.</p>
<p>Very, very stable, low levels of dopamine</p>
<p>with big inflections in his case.</p>
<p>Is that, do you think that&rsquo;s set in terms of our parents</p>
<p>and obviously nature and nurture interact,</p>
<p>but is that, is dopamine at the core of our temperament?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think we know the answer to that,</p>
<p>but I will say that people are definitely born</p>
<p>with different temperaments</p>
<p>and those temperaments do affect</p>
<p>their ability to experience joy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve known that for a long time</p>
<p>and we describe that in many different ways.</p>
<p>One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era</p>
<p>is to use psychiatric nomenclature,</p>
<p>like this person has a dysthymic temperament,</p>
<p>or this person has chronic major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>In terms of looking specifically</p>
<p>at who&rsquo;s vulnerable to addiction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting sort of mixed bag</p>
<p>because when you look at the research</p>
<p>on risk factors for addictions</p>
<p>or what kind of temperament of a person</p>
<p>makes them more vulnerable to addiction,</p>
<p>you see some interesting findings.</p>
<p>First, you see that people who are more impulsive</p>
<p>are more vulnerable to addiction.</p>
<p>So what is impulsivity?</p>
<p>That means having difficulty putting space</p>
<p>between the thought or desire to do something</p>
<p>and actually doing it.</p>
<p>And people who have difficulty putting a space there</p>
<p>who have a thought to do something</p>
<p>and just do it impulsively</p>
<p>are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>In terms of impulsivity,</p>
<p>is this something that relates literally</p>
<p>to the startle reflex?</p>
<p>Like I, for instance, as a lab director,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with walking around my lab</p>
<p>and when I decide, deciding I&rsquo;m going to talk to my people,</p>
<p>of course, when they knock on my door,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now?</p>
<p>Even though I love to talk to them.</p>
<p>But I walk around my lab from time to time</p>
<p>and some people I notice I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>do you have a moment?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll slowly turn around and say, yeah, or no,</p>
<p>in some cases.</p>
<p>And other people will jump the moment I say their name.</p>
<p>They actually have a kind of a heightened startle reflex.</p>
<p>Is that related to impulsivity</p>
<p>or is what you&rsquo;re referring to an attempt</p>
<p>to withhold behavior that&rsquo;s very deliberate</p>
<p>under very deliberate conditions?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t think that that startle reflex</p>
<p>is necessarily related to impulsivity.</p>
<p>That can be related to anxiety.</p>
<p>So people who are high anxiety,</p>
<p>people will tend to have more of a startle reflex.</p>
<p>Impulsivity is a little bit different.</p>
<p>And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad, right?</p>
<p>Impulsivity is that thing where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of self-editing</p>
<p>or worrying about future consequences.</p>
<p>You know, you have the idea to do something and you do it.</p>
<p>And of course we can imagine many scenarios</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>You know, there can be a sort of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>intimate interactions between people</p>
<p>where you wouldn&rsquo;t really wanna be</p>
<p>super inhibited about it, right?</p>
<p>You would wanna be disinhibited and impulsive.</p>
<p>I can also imagine like sort of fight or flight scenarios,</p>
<p>like battle scenarios, right?</p>
<p>Where it would really be good to be impulsive</p>
<p>and just go, rah, you know, just go.</p>
<p>Where hesitation can cost you your life.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But, you know, and I think this brings up a really,</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;ve come to believe</p>
<p>after 25 years of practicing psychiatry</p>
<p>is that what we now conceptualize in our current ecosystem</p>
<p>as mental illness are actually traits</p>
<p>that in another ecosystem might be very advantageous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not advantageous right now</p>
<p>because of the world that we live in.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, impulsivity</p>
<p>is potentially one of those, right?</p>
<p>Because we live in this world that&rsquo;s sort of like</p>
<p>you have to constantly be thinking sort of rationally</p>
<p>about the consequences of X, Y, or Z.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a sensory rich environment, right?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re being bombarded with all these opportunities,</p>
<p>these sensory opportunities.</p>
<p>And we have to constantly check ourselves.</p>
<p>And so impulsivity is something that right now</p>
<p>can be a difficult trait,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t in and of itself a bad thing.</p>
<p>I see. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m beginning to realize</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity.</p>
<p>What is pleasure and how does it work</p>
<p>at the biological level and if it feels right</p>
<p>at the psychological level?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t mind painting a picture</p>
<p>of sort of the range of things</p>
<p>that you have observed in your clinic or in life</p>
<p>that people can become addicted to.</p>
<p>But just to start off really simply,</p>
<p>what is this thing that we call pleasure?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s actually really hard to define pleasure</p>
<p>in any kind of succinct way</p>
<p>because certainly there is the seeking out of a high</p>
<p>or a euphoria or I think the kind of experience</p>
<p>that most anybody would associate with the word pleasure.</p>
<p>But also the seeking out of those same substances</p>
<p>and behaviors is often a way to escape pain.</p>
<p>So for example, when I talk to people with addiction,</p>
<p>sometimes their initial foray into using a drug</p>
<p>is to get pleasure.</p>
<p>But very often it&rsquo;s a way to escape their suffering,</p>
<p>whatever their suffering may be.</p>
<p>And certainly as people become addicted,</p>
<p>even those who initially were seeking out pleasure</p>
<p>are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal</p>
<p>or the pain of the consequences of their drug use.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very hard to actually define it</p>
<p>as this unitary thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly not just getting a high.</p>
<p>There are so many ways in which people</p>
<p>sort of want to escape,</p>
<p>which is not the same thing as sort of this hedonic</p>
<p>wanting to feel pleasure.</p>
<p>So someone could decide that they want to go out and dance</p>
<p>or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing.</p>
<p>I can imagine that.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s very difficult for them to stay seated</p>
<p>when a particular song comes on, for instance.</p>
<p>But seeking what we would call pleasure</p>
<p>in order to eliminate pain,</p>
<p>that evokes a different picture in my mind.</p>
<p>That evokes a picture of somebody that feels lost</p>
<p>or depressed or underwhelmed.</p>
<p>I definitely want to get into the precise</p>
<p>and general description of addiction and what that is.</p>
<p>But in a previous conversation we had,</p>
<p>you said something that really rung in my mind,</p>
<p>which is that many people who become addicted to things,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call them addicts,</p>
<p>have this feeling that normal life isn&rsquo;t interesting enough,</p>
<p>that they are seeking a super normal experience</p>
<p>and that the day-to-day routine balance,</p>
<p>which is actually in the title of your book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation Finding Balance</p>
<p>in the Age of Indulgence,&rdquo;</p>
<p>that the word balance itself</p>
<p>can sometimes be a bit of an aversive term for people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m struck by this idea.</p>
<p>And the reason I want to explore it</p>
<p>is because so much of what I see online</p>
<p>is about generating a lack of balance,</p>
<p>about being tilted forward at all times,</p>
<p>really leaning into life hard, experiencing life,</p>
<p>living a full life.</p>
<p>Even the commencement speech given by Steve Jobs</p>
<p>on this campus was really about finding passion,</p>
<p>digging, you know, that&rsquo;s so much in the narrative now.</p>
<p>So maybe you could just tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about your experience with this association,</p>
<p>if it really exists, between people&rsquo;s sense of the normalcy</p>
<p>or maybe even how boring life can be</p>
<p>and their tendency to become addicts of some sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, I think that life for humans</p>
<p>has always been hard,</p>
<p>but I think that now it&rsquo;s harder in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>And I think that the way that life is really hard now</p>
<p>is that it actually is really boring.</p>
<p>And the reason that it&rsquo;s boring</p>
<p>is because all of our survival needs are met, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t even have to leave our homes</p>
<p>to meet every single physical need.</p>
<p>You know, as long as you&rsquo;re of a certain level</p>
<p>of financial wellbeing, which frankly,</p>
<p>you know, we talk so much about the income gap</p>
<p>and certainly there is this enormous gap</p>
<p>between rich and poor,</p>
<p>but that gap is smaller than it&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>in like the history of humans.</p>
<p>Even the poorest of the poor</p>
<p>have more excess income to spend on leisure goods</p>
<p>than they ever have before in human history.</p>
<p>If you look at leisure time, for example,</p>
<p>so people without a high school education</p>
<p>have 42% more leisure time than people with a college degree.</p>
<p>So my point here is that life is hard now</p>
<p>in this really weird way</p>
<p>in that we don&rsquo;t really have anything that we have to do.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all forced to make stuff up, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s being a scientist or being a doctor</p>
<p>or being an Olympic athlete or, you know,</p>
<p>climbing Mount Everest.</p>
<p>And people really vary in their need for friction.</p>
<p>And some people need a lot more than others.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t have it, they&rsquo;re really, really unhappy.</p>
<p>And I do think that a lot of the people that I see</p>
<p>with addiction and other forms of mental illness</p>
<p>are people who need more friction.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re unhappy, not necessarily</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something wrong with their brain,</p>
<p>but because their brain is not suited to this world.</p>
<p>And do you think they have that sense?</p>
<p>My brain isn&rsquo;t suited to this world</p>
<p>or they simply feel a restlessness</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re constantly seeking stimulation?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s not really knowing what&rsquo;s wrong with me.</p>
<p>Why am I unhappy?</p>
<p>How can I be happier?</p>
<p>And of course, as you talk about what&rsquo;s so pervasive</p>
<p>in our narrative now is like, find your passion, you know,</p>
<p>find your, you know, whatever it is to save the world.</p>
<p>And in a way that&rsquo;s good because it has people</p>
<p>out in the world and seeking.</p>
<p>But in a way it can also be misleading in the sense that</p>
<p>I think people aren&rsquo;t entirely aware</p>
<p>that the world is a hard place and that life is hard</p>
<p>and that, you know, like we&rsquo;re all kind of making it up.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s a book by Cal Newport.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know Cal Newport&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>but you guys are very symbiotic in your messages.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of computer science at Georgetown.</p>
<p>Yes, at Georgetown.</p>
<p>And wrote a book some years ago,</p>
<p>really ahead of its time called</p>
<p>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You,</p>
<p>which is about not meditating or doing much work</p>
<p>to try and figure out what one&rsquo;s passion is by thinking,</p>
<p>but rather go out and acquire skills</p>
<p>and develop a sense of passion for something</p>
<p>by your experience of hard work and getting better</p>
<p>and feedback, a little bit of the growth mindset thing</p>
<p>of our colleague, Carol Dweck.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s gone on to write books, Deep Work,</p>
<p>and which is all about removing yourself from technology</p>
<p>and doing deep work.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been a big proponent of the evils of context</p>
<p>switching too often throughout the day</p>
<p>for sake of productivity, mostly.</p>
<p>His new book is called A World Without Email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to realize as I cite off these books</p>
<p>and your book, Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence,</p>
<p>that maybe the reason why you two don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about one another is because neither of you</p>
<p>are on social media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re two of the most productive people</p>
<p>that I know, including productive authors.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a discussion unto itself.</p>
<p>But I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the pleasure-pain balance and addiction.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard you use this seesaw or balance scale</p>
<p>analogy before.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful one that really, for me,</p>
<p>clarified what addiction is,</p>
<p>at least at the mechanistic level.</p>
<p>Yeah, so to me, one of the most significant findings</p>
<p>in neuroscience in the last 75 years</p>
<p>is that pleasure and pain are co-located,</p>
<p>which means the same parts of the brain</p>
<p>that process pleasure also process pain.</p>
<p>And they work like a balance.</p>
<p>So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way.</p>
<p>When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And one of the overriding rules governing this balance</p>
<p>is that it wants to stay level.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t want to remain tipped very long</p>
<p>to pleasure or to pain.</p>
<p>And with any deviation from neutrality,</p>
<p>the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance</p>
<p>or what scientists call homeostasis.</p>
<p>And the way the brain does that</p>
<p>is with any stimulus to one side,</p>
<p>there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount</p>
<p>to the other side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have principle laws of physics.</p>
<p>Yes, right, right.</p>
<p>So I like to watch YouTube videos.</p>
<p>When I watch YouTube videos of American Idol,</p>
<p>it tips to the side of pleasure.</p>
<p>And then when I stop watching it, I have a comedown,</p>
<p>which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that moment of wanting to watch</p>
<p>one more YouTube video, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I just want to interject there.</p>
<p>So this moment of wanting to watch another</p>
<p>that is associated with pain, I think,</p>
<p>is are we always aware of that happening?</p>
<p>Because you just described in a very conscious way.</p>
<p>But when I indulge in something I enjoy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about the pain.</p>
<p>I just think about more.</p>
<p>Right, so really excellent point,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re mostly not aware of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also reflexive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something that consciously happens</p>
<p>or that we&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>unless we really begin to pay attention.</p>
<p>And when we begin to pay attention,</p>
<p>we really can become very aware of it in the moment.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s like a falling away,</p>
<p>like that moment you&rsquo;re on social media,</p>
<p>and you get a good tweet of something.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t stop yourself</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this awareness, a latent awareness,</p>
<p>that as soon as I disengage from this behavior,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to experience a kind of a pain, right?</p>
<p>A falling away, a missing that feeling,</p>
<p>a wanting more of it.</p>
<p>And of course, one way to combat that is to do it more,</p>
<p>right, and more and more and more.</p>
<p>So I think that is really what I want people to tune into</p>
<p>and get an awareness around.</p>
<p>Because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot.</p>
<p>And then when you begin to see it, you have,</p>
<p>and if you keep the model of the balance in mind,</p>
<p>I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re experiencing on a neurobiological level</p>
<p>and understand it.</p>
<p>And in that understanding, get some mastery over it,</p>
<p>which is really what this is all about.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, we do need to disengage, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t live in that space all the time, right?</p>
<p>We have other things we need to do.</p>
<p>And there are also serious consequences</p>
<p>that come with trying to repeat</p>
<p>and continue that experience or that feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if I understand this correctly,</p>
<p>when we find something, or when something finds us,</p>
<p>that we enjoy, that feels pleasurable,</p>
<p>social media, food, sex, gambling, whatever happens to be,</p>
<p>we will explore the full range of these.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some dopamine release</p>
<p>when we engage in that behavior.</p>
<p>And then what you&rsquo;re telling me is that very quickly,</p>
<p>and beneath my conscious awareness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tilting back of the scale</p>
<p>where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard you say before that the pain mechanism</p>
<p>has some competitive advantages</p>
<p>over the pleasure mechanism,</p>
<p>such that it doesn&rsquo;t just bring the scale back to level,</p>
<p>it actually brings pain higher than pleasure.</p>
<p>Could you tell us a little bit more about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so what happens, again,</p>
<p>so the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior</p>
<p>is that it releases a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>in our brain&rsquo;s reward pathway, right?</p>
<p>Like broccoli just doesn&rsquo;t release a lot of dopamine,</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine, I was about to say,</p>
<p>and I stopped myself because, no, broccoli&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>it can be really good, but broccoli is never amazing.</p>
<p>Right, broccoli&rsquo;s never amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, we can probably find somebody</p>
<p>on the planet for whom broccoli is amazing.</p>
<p>And of course, if I&rsquo;m starving, broccoli is amazing.</p>
<p>Rich Roll, Rich Roll is big on plants</p>
<p>and he has a good relationship to plants.</p>
<p>Rich, tell us how to make broccoli amazing.</p>
<p>If anyone could do it, it&rsquo;d be Rich.</p>
<p>But what happens right after I do something</p>
<p>that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>is, again, my brain is going to immediately compensate</p>
<p>by down-regulating my own dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>my own dopamine transmission to compensate for that, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that comedown or the hangover,</p>
<p>that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more.</p>
<p>Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass,</p>
<p>then my dopamine will re-regulate itself</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t wait, and here&rsquo;s really the key,</p>
<p>if I keep indulging again and again and again,</p>
<p>ultimately, I have so much on the pain side, right,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve essentially reset my brain</p>
<p>to what we call like an anhedonic</p>
<p>or lacking in joy type of state,</p>
<p>which is a dopamine deficit state.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the way in which pain</p>
<p>can become the main driver</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;ve indulged so much</p>
<p>in these high reward behaviors or substances</p>
<p>that my brain has had to compensate</p>
<p>by way down-regulating my own dopamine</p>
<p>such that even when I&rsquo;m not doing that drug,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a dopamine deficit state,</p>
<p>which is akin to a clinical depression.</p>
<p>I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria,</p>
<p>and a lot of mental preoccupation</p>
<p>with using again or getting the drug.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the piece there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the single use, which easily passes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the chronic use that can then reset</p>
<p>really our dopamine thresholds,</p>
<p>and then nothing is enjoyable, right?</p>
<p>Then everything sort of pales in comparison</p>
<p>to this one drug that I want to keep doing.</p>
<p>And that one drug could be a person, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I know people in my life</p>
<p>that are still talking about this one relationship,</p>
<p>this one person that was just so great</p>
<p>despite all the challenges of that thing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re addicted to the narrative,</p>
<p>they were maybe or still are addicted to the person.</p>
<p>So it could be to any number of things,</p>
<p>video games, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative.</p>
<p>To me, and because of the way you described this mechanism,</p>
<p>this pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>that all speaks to the kind of generalizability</p>
<p>of our brain circuitry.</p>
<p>And this is something that fascinates me,</p>
<p>and I know it fascinates you as well,</p>
<p>which is that nature did not evolve</p>
<p>20 different mechanisms for 20 different types of addiction.</p>
<p>Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters and pathways,</p>
<p>and one person is triggered by social interactions,</p>
<p>another person is triggered by spiders,</p>
<p>but the underlying response is identical.</p>
<p>It sounds like with addiction as well,</p>
<p>there may be some nuance,</p>
<p>but that they&rsquo;re sort of a core set of processes.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gambling or video games or sex</p>
<p>or a narrative about a previous lover or partner or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same addictive process underneath that.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where this whole idea of cross addiction comes in.</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;ve been addicted to a substance,</p>
<p>severely addicted,</p>
<p>that makes you more vulnerable to addiction</p>
<p>to any substance.</p>
<p>And when you say substance,</p>
<p>does the same, is what you just said also true for behavior?</p>
<p>Yes, so when I use the word drug,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about substances and behaviors, really.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about behaviors like gambling, sex,</p>
<p>gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accused me, I&rsquo;ll just for the record,</p>
<p>Anna, Dr. Lemke has accused me,</p>
<p>not accused me, has diagnosed me outside the clinic</p>
<p>in a playful way of being work addicted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>The first thoughts I have when I wake up</p>
<p>are typically about work,</p>
<p>certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of waking.</p>
<p>And probably the last thoughts I have,</p>
<p>I would hope, are not about work,</p>
<p>but yeah, I work constantly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I do other things,</p>
<p>but I have to actively turn that off.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re certainly not alone in that.</p>
<p>And of course-</p>
<p>At Stanford, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I mean, here in Silicon Valley, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly rewarded, right?</p>
<p>So that kind of addiction-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embedded in the culture.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this other city,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called New York,</p>
<p>where they also work a lot out here,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s heavily rewarded.</p>
<p>I once said, and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not the first person to say it,</p>
<p>but I was thinking about addiction,</p>
<p>and I was thinking about the underlying circuits,</p>
<p>and I posted something to social media,</p>
<p>which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>That was the way that I kind of crystallized</p>
<p>the literature in my mind.</p>
<p>And then we met, and you, of course,</p>
<p>came and gave these amazing lectures</p>
<p>in the neuroanatomy course for the medical students,</p>
<p>and the rest is history.</p>
<p>But I tossed out a kind of mirroring statement</p>
<p>for that as well, which was a bit overstepping, I admit,</p>
<p>which I said, addiction is a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>And I said, dare I say,</p>
<p>enlightenment is a progressive expansion</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is,</p>
<p>but it was my attempt to take a little bit of a jab</p>
<p>at the fact that nobody knows.</p>
<p>And so why not, why wouldn&rsquo;t I throw</p>
<p>a neurobiological explanation</p>
<p>just to kind of sample the waters?</p>
<p>And people had varying levels of response.</p>
<p>But the reason I bring that up is that I would imagine</p>
<p>that being able to derive pleasure from many things</p>
<p>would be a wonderful attribute.</p>
<p>We know people like this that can experience pleasure</p>
<p>in little things and in big events,</p>
<p>not just the big milestones of life,</p>
<p>but also the subtle, as like the yogis would say,</p>
<p>the subtle ripples of life.</p>
<p>If such an ability exists,</p>
<p>do you think that that reflects</p>
<p>a healthily tuned dopamine system?</p>
<p>One that can engage and enjoy, but then disengage?</p>
<p>Is that what we should be seeking?</p>
<p>And to underscore,</p>
<p>I know nothing about enlightenment meditation or any of it.</p>
<p>I use these as opportunities to explore.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And I understand the question as,</p>
<p>so what should we be striving for, right?</p>
<p>Where should we settle out?</p>
<p>And in my book, I really hold out people in recovery</p>
<p>from severe addiction as sort of modern day prophets</p>
<p>for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Because I do think that people who have been addicted</p>
<p>and then go get into recovery,</p>
<p>do have a hard one wisdom that we can all benefit from.</p>
<p>And the wisdom, I guess, to distill it down,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s many things.</p>
<p>But in terms of dopamine,</p>
<p>the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine</p>
<p>and there are less than adaptive ways.</p>
<p>And in general, you could describe the adaptive ways</p>
<p>as not too potent.</p>
<p>So not tipping that balance too hard or too fast</p>
<p>to the side of pleasure.</p>
<p>So does that mean never allowing myself</p>
<p>to be absolutely in complete bliss?</p>
<p>Or does it mean not allowing myself</p>
<p>to stay in that state too long?</p>
<p>The latter, I think the latter.</p>
<p>So, and then that gets to temperament.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to get that to a second.</p>
<p>So in general, what we want is some kind of flexibility</p>
<p>in that balance and the ability</p>
<p>to easily reassert homeostasis.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to break our balance,</p>
<p>which is possible if we overindulge</p>
<p>for enough period of time</p>
<p>and end up with a balanced tip to the side of pain,</p>
<p>this dopamine deficit state we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>We want a flexible, resilient balance, right?</p>
<p>Which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment,</p>
<p>which can experience pleasure and approach,</p>
<p>which can experience pain and recoil, right?</p>
<p>This is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and good.</p>
<p>We would never want a balance that doesn&rsquo;t tilt.</p>
<p>That would be a disaster.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be human.</p>
<p>And we wouldn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really, really boring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what people in recovery</p>
<p>from addiction talk about is to some extent</p>
<p>having to learn to live with things being a little boring</p>
<p>a lot of the time, right?</p>
<p>So trying to avoid some of this intensity</p>
<p>and thrill-seeking and escapism</p>
<p>that really is at the core of addictive tendencies.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but when you say boring,</p>
<p>can we add stressful and boring?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because there are days where I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people who have to remind myself</p>
<p>to have fun because I sort of forgot what the term means.</p>
<p>Because I like to think that I experience</p>
<p>a lot of pleasure in little things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a pretty hard-driving guy.</p>
<p>I like goals and big milestones, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point being that many days I&rsquo;m not bored</p>
<p>thinking, oh, there&rsquo;s nothing to do,</p>
<p>but I am kind of overwhelmed by the number of things</p>
<p>that are really not pleasureful that I have to do.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention what they are</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want my colleagues to be like,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t respond to emails.</p>
<p>No, just your emails.</p>
<p>Not yours, Anna, but theirs.</p>
<p>In any event, so anxiety and boredom</p>
<p>can hang out together, right?</p>
<p>Am I correct?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, actually boredom is highly anxiety-provoking.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good to know</p>
<p>because I think people hear boredom</p>
<p>and they think like, oh, there&rsquo;s nothing to do here.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I feel like we have a ton to do,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t really want to do it,</p>
<p>as opposed to something that we&rsquo;re excited to do.</p>
<p>Right, okay, so this gets to sort of</p>
<p>some of the core things also we were talking about earlier</p>
<p>about finding your passion.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to try to link it all together.</p>
<p>But basically, boredom,</p>
<p>first of all, boredom is a rare experience for modern humans</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re constantly distracting ourselves</p>
<p>from the present moment</p>
<p>and we have an infinite number of ways to do that, right?</p>
<p>But boredom is really, I think,</p>
<p>an important and necessary experience.</p>
<p>But it is scary because when you allow yourself to be bored,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you had that list</p>
<p>of all the things you hate to do,</p>
<p>but you actually got them all done.</p>
<p>Imagine that, and you got your forthcoming book done,</p>
<p>and you did all your interviews.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>It could happen.</p>
<p>Lightning could strike.</p>
<p>Right, and you walked your dog,</p>
<p>and you cleaned your house,</p>
<p>and you went shopping.</p>
<p>Imagine that for a moment.</p>
<p>You would be sitting in your house,</p>
<p>and my guess is you would be terrified</p>
<p>because, wow, what am I supposed to do now, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I really have to do.</p>
<p>And that is really, really scary.</p>
<p>That can feel like free fall.</p>
<p>And yet, that&rsquo;s really an important</p>
<p>and good experience to have.</p>
<p>And I think that is an experience</p>
<p>out of which we can have a lot of creative initiative,</p>
<p>but also really consider our priorities and values.</p>
<p>Okay, here I am on planet Earth.</p>
<p>What the hee-haw am I gonna do with my life?</p>
<p>What do I really care about?</p>
<p>How do I really wanna spend my time</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m not distracting myself in order to spend it?</p>
<p>And then this gets back to our conversation</p>
<p>a little bit earlier about finding your passion.</p>
<p>So I think that one of the big problems now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very misguided about this idea</p>
<p>of finding your passion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost as if people are looking to fit the key</p>
<p>into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do.</p>
<p>Right, and then everything will feel</p>
<p>like a natural progression.</p>
<p>Right, and then everything will be wonderful.</p>
<p>I can attest to the fact that is not how it works</p>
<p>in any endeavor.</p>
<p>Right, and then you&rsquo;ll have all this great success.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I really think the answer lies,</p>
<p>and I really, really believe this.</p>
<p>Stop looking for your passion,</p>
<p>and instead look around right where you are.</p>
<p>Stop distracting yourself,</p>
<p>look around right where you are,</p>
<p>and see what needs to be done.</p>
<p>So not what do I want to do,</p>
<p>but what is the work that needs to be done?</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be some grandiose work.</p>
<p>Like, does the garbage need to be taken out, right?</p>
<p>Is there some garbage on your neighbor&rsquo;s lawn</p>
<p>that someone threw there</p>
<p>that you could actually bend over and pick up</p>
<p>and put into the garbage can?</p>
<p>Look around you.</p>
<p>There is so much work that needs to be done</p>
<p>that nobody wants to do</p>
<p>that is really, really important.</p>
<p>And if we all did that,</p>
<p>I really think the world would be a much better place.</p>
<p>And this is what people who have severe addiction</p>
<p>who get into recovery realize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not about me and my will</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m going to will in my life or in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about looking around what needs to be done.</p>
<p>What is the work that I am called to do in this moment?</p>
<p>Which also is incredibly freeing</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have to search for the perfect thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of burden now on young people</p>
<p>that they have to find that perfect thing,</p>
<p>and until they&rsquo;ve found that perfect thing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be miserable.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>Look at the life you were given.</p>
<p>Look at the people around you.</p>
<p>Look at the jobs that present themselves to you</p>
<p>and do that job simply and honorably one day at a time</p>
<p>with a kind of humility.</p>
<p>I think this is really what&rsquo;s so striking to me</p>
<p>about the wisdom of people in recovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this incredible humility</p>
<p>that comes out of that experience.</p>
<p>You feel so broken, so ashamed,</p>
<p>but you pick yourself up one day at a time</p>
<p>and you build a life that&rsquo;s around,</p>
<p>what can I do right in this moment</p>
<p>that might benefit another person and thereby benefit me?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really important point,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re willing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to actually stay on this issue of passion</p>
<p>because I think the dopamine systems,</p>
<p>if I understand them correctly,</p>
<p>the dopamine systems merge with this work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>this immediacy of things calling to us</p>
<p>like taking out the trash,</p>
<p>which sounds frankly really boring, to be honest.</p>
<p>I hate taking out the trash, but I do it</p>
<p>because I like a clean home</p>
<p>and I like a home that smells good,</p>
<p>or at least doesn&rsquo;t smell bad.</p>
<p>So we do these things,</p>
<p>and not that we want to offer some larger carrot</p>
<p>as a consequence of doing those things,</p>
<p>but if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is in the act</p>
<p>of looking at one&rsquo;s immediate environment,</p>
<p>acting on that immediate environment,</p>
<p>we cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain</p>
<p>about action and reward that, at least to my mind,</p>
<p>span the range of small things being rewarding</p>
<p>and then lead us to bigger things being rewarding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like all we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>is take out trash and tend to house.</p>
<p>We eventually will venture out</p>
<p>and we eventually will find careers and work on those.</p>
<p>But if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about getting into a sort of functional</p>
<p>or adaptive action step.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the action step that these days</p>
<p>we tend to overlook because most of our mindset</p>
<p>is in things that are truly outside</p>
<p>of our immediate reality.</p>
<p>Do I have that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was beautifully said.</p>
<p>And I would just add to that.</p>
<p>I see a lot of young people who, for example,</p>
<p>spend most of their waking hours playing video games.</p>
<p>And they come to me and they say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anxious and depressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m majoring in computer science.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>I thought I would like it.</p>
<p>If I could only find that thing</p>
<p>that I was really meant to do, my life would be better.</p>
<p>And my first intervention for the many, many people</p>
<p>like that that I see in clinical care is,</p>
<p>you have it backwards.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say it quite like that.</p>
<p>You were waiting for that thing to pull you out</p>
<p>of the video game world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never gonna find it</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re playing video games.</p>
<p>Because video games are so powerfully dopaminergic</p>
<p>that you have this distorted sense</p>
<p>of really pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>And you will not be able to find that thing that you enjoy.</p>
<p>And so, of course, the intervention is,</p>
<p>abstain from video games, reset your reward pathways,</p>
<p>start with a level balance.</p>
<p>And what invariably happens,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve just seen it over 20 years so many times,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become really a believer in this.</p>
<p>All of a sudden it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, wow, my computer science class</p>
<p>is interesting this quarter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you have a receptivity then</p>
<p>to experiencing pleasure and reward</p>
<p>in a way you just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re bombarding your reward pathways</p>
<p>with these high dopamine drugs.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>And just to underscore this notion</p>
<p>that tending to the immediate things</p>
<p>can lead to super performance.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned it earlier this episode,</p>
<p>but if I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll mention now,</p>
<p>which is I have the great privilege</p>
<p>of having some close friends that were in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>and doing some work with those communities.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a remarkable community</p>
<p>for reasons that I think most people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>People think they see the images</p>
<p>carrying logs down the beach</p>
<p>and all the blowing stuff on,</p>
<p>all the stuff that&rsquo;s fun for guys like that.</p>
<p>But all of the guys I know who were in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>have this sense of duty about immediate things.</p>
<p>And not just holding the door</p>
<p>and helping with the dishes and moving things around.</p>
<p>They are constantly scanning their environment</p>
<p>for what can be done.</p>
<p>They essentially conquer every environment they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>They are also some of the most competitive human beings</p>
<p>that they do in the world.</p>
<p>And they do it unless they&rsquo;re in the act of war fighting,</p>
<p>which is their real job.</p>
<p>They do it in every environment in a very benevolent way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a remarkable thing</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s what is part</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re selected for.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a range there.</p>
<p>But I think when we hear about</p>
<p>tending to the immediate things,</p>
<p>or this phrase, how you do one thing is how you do anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky one for me</p>
<p>because there are certain things I just don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>But should we always be trying?</p>
<p>I think that the tending to,</p>
<p>setting the horizon in closely</p>
<p>and tending to things in one&rsquo;s immediate environment,</p>
<p>I think it is very powerful and translates.</p>
<p>Because again, I think the nervous system,</p>
<p>it performs algorithms, it has action steps.</p>
<p>The brain doesn&rsquo;t evolve to do one thing.</p>
<p>It evolves to be able to use the same approach</p>
<p>to doing lots of different things.</p>
<p>I just want to add, so even beyond that,</p>
<p>because that totally resonates for me</p>
<p>and is very consistent with people in recovery</p>
<p>from addiction who learn to take it one day at a time,</p>
<p>which is one of the standard lingo</p>
<p>from Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step groups.</p>
<p>But I think also, as you say,</p>
<p>our brain is really wired for the 24-hour period.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not very good at sort of the 10-year, 20.</p>
<p>I mean, we have these huge frontal lobes,</p>
<p>and yes, we&rsquo;re great planners.</p>
<p>But if we live too much in that space,</p>
<p>we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost</p>
<p>and either catastrophize or get grandiose.</p>
<p>But if you can chunk it down to a day,</p>
<p>what people in recovery talk about</p>
<p>is how if I can just do today right,</p>
<p>then I will get a chain of days</p>
<p>that seem insignificant in their individual units.</p>
<p>But after six months or a year</p>
<p>or two years of those good days,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two very good years, right?</p>
<p>And I look back and it&rsquo;s like, oh, wow,</p>
<p>well, I guess I did all that.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s really one of the keys,</p>
<p>is really taking it one day at a time,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re sealed.</p>
<p>And also this connecting with the environment, right?</p>
<p>So being awake and alert to your environment</p>
<p>and connecting with your environment,</p>
<p>not trying to escape it.</p>
<p>And of course, escapism is what we all want and desire,</p>
<p>that experience of non-being.</p>
<p>And we get it from the internet or from drugs</p>
<p>or whatever it is, but it&rsquo;s the booby prize.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, it takes you further and further away</p>
<p>from your immediate environment,</p>
<p>which is where we really have to connect</p>
<p>to get that sense of groundedness and authenticity</p>
<p>and like of being in our own lives.</p>
<p>Well, I think the unit of the day</p>
<p>is something that comes up again and again</p>
<p>in my discussions with colleagues</p>
<p>who are extremely successful</p>
<p>and who also have balanced lives.</p>
<p>This actually came up in the discussion</p>
<p>with Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who is also a successful scientist and clinician</p>
<p>and manages a family, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the unit of the day I think is fundamental</p>
<p>and those stack up, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>So along those lines, I&rsquo;ve heard you say</p>
<p>that in order to reset the dopamine system,</p>
<p>essentially in order to break an addictive pattern,</p>
<p>to become unaddicted,</p>
<p>30 days of zero interaction with that substance,</p>
<p>that person, et cetera.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, and 30 days is in my clinical experience,</p>
<p>the average amount of time it takes</p>
<p>for the brain to reset reward pathways,</p>
<p>for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a little bit of science</p>
<p>that suggests that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Some imaging studies showing that</p>
<p>our brains are still in a dopamine deficit state</p>
<p>two weeks after we&rsquo;ve been using our drug.</p>
<p>And then a study by Shuckett and Brown,</p>
<p>which took a group of depressed men</p>
<p>who also were addicted to alcohol,</p>
<p>put them in a hospital</p>
<p>where they had received no treatment for depression,</p>
<p>but they had no access to alcohol in that time.</p>
<p>And after four weeks, 80% of them no longer met criteria</p>
<p>for major depression.</p>
<p>So again, this idea that by depriving ourselves</p>
<p>of this high dopamine, high reward substance or behavior,</p>
<p>we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine</p>
<p>for the balance to really equilibrate.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re in a place</p>
<p>where we can sort of enjoy other things.</p>
<p>So that progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of what brings one pleasure eventually expands.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to dissect out that 30 days a little more,</p>
<p>finally.</p>
<p>And I also want to address</p>
<p>how does one stop doing something for 30 days</p>
<p>if the thing is a thought?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll kind of put that on the shelf for a moment.</p>
<p>So days one through 10,</p>
<p>I would imagine will be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to suck, basically, to be quite honest,</p>
<p>because the way you describe this pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>to my mind says that if you remove what little pleasure</p>
<p>one is getting or a lot of pleasure</p>
<p>from engaging in some behavior,</p>
<p>the pain system is really ramped up</p>
<p>and nothing is making me feel good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just use myself as an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in recovery,</p>
<p>but that 10 days is going to be miserable.</p>
<p>Anxiety, trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>physical agitation to the point where</p>
<p>maybe impulsive, angry.</p>
<p>Should one expect all of that?</p>
<p>Should the family members of people expect all of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what I say to patients,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really important piece of this intervention,</p>
<p>is that you will feel worse before you feel better.</p>
<p>For how long?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is probably the first question they ask, right?</p>
<p>And I say, usually, in my clinical experience,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel worse for two weeks.</p>
<p>But if you can make it through those first two weeks,</p>
<p>the sun will start to come out in week three.</p>
<p>And by week four,</p>
<p>most people are feeling a whole lot better than they were</p>
<p>before they stopped using their substance.</p>
<p>So yeah, you have to, it&rsquo;s a hard thing.</p>
<p>You have to sign up for it.</p>
<p>And I will say, obviously,</p>
<p>there are people with addictions that are so severe</p>
<p>that as long as they have access to their drug or behavior,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to stop themselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have higher levels of care</p>
<p>or residential treatment.</p>
<p>So this is not going to be for everybody, this intervention,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing how many people</p>
<p>with really severe addictions to things like heroin,</p>
<p>cocaine, very severe pornography addictions,</p>
<p>I posit this, and I do it as an experiment.</p>
<p>I said, let&rsquo;s try this experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed, number one,</p>
<p>how many of them are willing,</p>
<p>and number two, how many of them are actually able to do it.</p>
<p>They are able to do it.</p>
<p>And so that little nudge is sort of just what they need.</p>
<p>And the carrot is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a better life out there for you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to taste it in a month.</p>
<p>You really will be able to begin to see</p>
<p>that you can feel better and that there&rsquo;s another way.</p>
<p>So the way you describe it seems like it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s doable for most people, not everybody.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll return to that category of people</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t do that on their own.</p>
<p>Well, then days 21 through 30,</p>
<p>people are feeling better.</p>
<p>The sun is starting to come out, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Which translates in the narrative we&rsquo;ve created here</p>
<p>and support by biology,</p>
<p>that dopamine is starting to be released</p>
<p>in response to the taste of a really good cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Whereas before it was only to insert addictive behavior.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Whichever.</p>
<p>Of course, coffee can be addictive too,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll leave that aside.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like coffee has a kind of</p>
<p>consumption limiting mechanism built in,</p>
<p>where at some point you just can&rsquo;t ingest anymore.</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Sorry to give lift to the caffeine addicts out there,</p>
<p>as I clutch my mug.</p>
<p>So days 21 through 30,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people go through addiction</p>
<p>and addiction treatment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in those places,</p>
<p>actually looking at it, researching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got friends in that community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m close with that community.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve seen over and over again,</p>
<p>sadly, often in the same individuals,</p>
<p>is they get sober from whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing great.</p>
<p>These are people with families.</p>
<p>These are people that you discard</p>
<p>your normal image of an addict</p>
<p>and insert the most normal, typical,</p>
<p>whatever, healthy person you can imagine,</p>
<p>because a lot of these people you wouldn&rsquo;t know were addicts.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you get this call.</p>
<p>So-and-so&rsquo;s back in jail.</p>
<p>So-and-so&rsquo;s wife is going to leave him</p>
<p>because he drank two bottles of wine</p>
<p>and took a Xanax at 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>crashed his truck into a pole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got two beautiful kids.</p>
<p>How did this happen again?</p>
<p>To the point where by the fourth and fifth time,</p>
<p>people are just done.</p>
<p>I mean, you might be able to detect</p>
<p>the frustration in my voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with this with somebody that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that I want to help this time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been so many times.</p>
<p>To the point where I&rsquo;m starting to wonder,</p>
<p>is this person just an addict?</p>
<p>This is just kind of what they do and who they are.</p>
<p>And you never want to give up on people,</p>
<p>but, and I&rsquo;m hanging in there for them,</p>
<p>but I will say that many people have given up on them.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;d like to talk about in this context</p>
<p>is what sorts of things help other people</p>
<p>that we know that are addicted?</p>
<p>What really helps?</p>
<p>Not what could help, but what really helps?</p>
<p>And are there certain people for whom it&rsquo;s hopeless?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t like to hold the conversation that way,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t be close to the real life data</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t ask, is it hopeless?</p>
<p>Are there people who just will not be able</p>
<p>to quit their substance use or their addictive behavior,</p>
<p>despite, I have to assume, really wanting to?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there are people who will die</p>
<p>of their disease of addiction.</p>
<p>And I think conceptualizing it as a disease</p>
<p>is a helpful frame.</p>
<p>There are other frames that we could use,</p>
<p>but I do think given the brain physiologic changes</p>
<p>that occur with sustained heavy drug use</p>
<p>and what we know happens to the brain,</p>
<p>it is really reasonable to think of it as a brain disease.</p>
<p>And for me, the real window of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>being able to access my compassion</p>
<p>around people who are repeat relapsers,</p>
<p>even when their life is so much better,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in recovery.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a no-brainer, right?</p>
<p>Is to conceptualize this balance</p>
<p>and the dopamine deficit state</p>
<p>and a balance tilted to the side of pain.</p>
<p>And to imagine that for some people,</p>
<p>after a month or six months or maybe even six years,</p>
<p>their balance is still tipped to the side of pain,</p>
<p>that on some level, that balance has lost its resilience</p>
<p>and its ability to restore homeostasis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the hinge on that balance is messed up.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, for someone who&rsquo;s never experienced</p>
<p>addiction like yourself,</p>
<p>maybe one way to conceptualize it is-</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>No, to be clear, I was not referring to myself,</p>
<p>but in this example I was given,</p>
<p>if I were, I would come clean.</p>
<p>I would reveal that.</p>
<p>But I think that, especially after hearing</p>
<p>some of your lectures and descriptions</p>
<p>of the range of things that are addictive,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been fortunate</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t have a propensity for drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky in that way, that frankly,</p>
<p>if they remove all the alcohol from the planet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be relieved because no one will offer it to me.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t send me any alcohol.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t go to me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>I like to think I have the compassion,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have that empathy for</p>
<p>taking a really good situation</p>
<p>and what from the outside looks to be</p>
<p>throwing it in the trash.</p>
<p>Yeah, so okay, so is that what that means?</p>
<p>And this is really, I think, important</p>
<p>because I also had to come to an understanding of this,</p>
<p>and I feel that I have in my 20 years</p>
<p>of seeing these patients.</p>
<p>And of course, addiction is a spectrum disease, right?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got the severe end of things.</p>
<p>Imagine that you had an itch somewhere on your body, okay?</p>
<p>And it was, I mean, we&rsquo;ve all had that,</p>
<p>like, you know, whatever the source.</p>
<p>It was super, super itchy.</p>
<p>You can go for, you know, if you really focus,</p>
<p>you could go for a pretty good amount of time</p>
<p>not scratching it.</p>
<p>But the moment you stopped focusing on not scratching it,</p>
<p>you would scratch it.</p>
<p>And maybe you would do it while you were asleep, right?</p>
<p>And that is what happens to people with severe addiction.</p>
<p>That balance is essentially broken.</p>
<p>Homeostasis does not get restored</p>
<p>despite sustained abstinence.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re living with that constant specter of that pull.</p>
<p>It never goes away.</p>
<p>So let me say there are lots of people with addiction</p>
<p>for whom that does go away.</p>
<p>And it goes away at four weeks for many of them.</p>
<p>But in severe cases, that&rsquo;s always there and it&rsquo;s lingering.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the moment when they&rsquo;re not focusing on not using.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a reflex.</p>
<p>They fall back into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not purposeful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they want to get high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they value using drugs</p>
<p>more than they do their family.</p>
<p>None of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that really they cannot not do it</p>
<p>when given the opportunity and that moment</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not thinking about it.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great description.</p>
<p>And actually in that description,</p>
<p>I can feel a bit of empathy</p>
<p>because the way you described scratching an itch</p>
<p>in your sleep, I&rsquo;ve done that with mosquito bites</p>
<p>and someone scratching and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, you wake up scratching that mosquito bite.</p>
<p>And I also have to admit that I&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>not feeling like I want to pick up my phone</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so rewarding, but just finding myself doing it.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not going to use this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to use this thing.</p>
<p>And then just finding myself doing it.</p>
<p>Like, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>Sort of the, how did I get back here again?</p>
<p>And I know enough about brain function</p>
<p>to understand that we have circuits</p>
<p>that generate deliberate behavior</p>
<p>and we have circuits that generate reflexive behavior.</p>
<p>And one of the goals of the nervous system</p>
<p>is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to make the decision</p>
<p>because decision-making is a very costly thing to do.</p>
<p>Decision-making of any kind.</p>
<p>So that does really help.</p>
<p>I want to just try and weave together this dopamine puzzle,</p>
<p>however, because if by week,</p>
<p>so first phase of this 30 or 40 day detox,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a dopamine fast, right?</p>
<p>Okay, first 10 days are miserable.</p>
<p>Middle 10 days, the clouds are out.</p>
<p>There may be some shards of sunlight coming through</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden, sun starts to come out,</p>
<p>it gets brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>Why is it then that people will relapse</p>
<p>not just after getting fired from a job</p>
<p>or their spouse leaving them,</p>
<p>but when things are going really well?</p>
<p>Is it this unconscious mechanism?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve seen this before is they have a great win.</p>
<p>I have a friend who&rsquo;s a really impressive creative.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to reveal any more than that.</p>
<p>But, and relapsed upon getting another</p>
<p>really terrific opportunity to create for the entire world.</p>
<p>And I was like, how can that happen?</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder,</p>
<p>was it the dopamine associated with that win</p>
<p>that opened the spigot on this dopamine system?</p>
<p>Because it happened in a phase</p>
<p>of a really great stretch of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you raised that great point about triggers, right?</p>
<p>And triggers are things that make us want to go back</p>
<p>to using our drug.</p>
<p>And the key thing about triggers, whatever they are,</p>
<p>is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right?</p>
<p>So just thinking about whatever the trigger is</p>
<p>that we associate with drug use,</p>
<p>or just thinking about drug use,</p>
<p>can already release this anticipatory dopamine,</p>
<p>this little mini spike.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the part that I think is really fascinating.</p>
<p>That mini spike is followed by a mini deficit state.</p>
<p>So it goes up, and then it doesn&rsquo;t go back down</p>
<p>to baseline, it goes below baseline tonic levels.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s craving, right?</p>
<p>So that anticipation is immediately followed</p>
<p>by wanting the drug.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that dopamine deficit state</p>
<p>that drives the motivation to go and get the drug.</p>
<p>So many people talk about dopamine</p>
<p>is not really about pleasure,</p>
<p>but about wanting and about motivation.</p>
<p>And so it is that deficit state</p>
<p>that then drives the locomotion to get it.</p>
<p>And earlier, your description of dopamine being involved</p>
<p>in the desire for more, giving the sense of reward,</p>
<p>but also movement.</p>
<p>I have to assume that those things are braided together</p>
<p>in our nervous system for the specific intention</p>
<p>of when you feel something good,</p>
<p>then you feel the pain, but maybe you don&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>And then the next thing you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pursuing more of the thing that could deliver.</p>
<p>And I love the way you use the word braided together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And let me also just say something</p>
<p>that I find also fascinating in my work with patients,</p>
<p>and I see this all the time.</p>
<p>There are people for whom bad life experiences,</p>
<p>loss, you know, in any form,</p>
<p>stress in many different forms, that&rsquo;s a trigger.</p>
<p>But there are absolutely people</p>
<p>for whom the trigger is things going well.</p>
<p>And the things going well can be like the reward</p>
<p>of the things going well,</p>
<p>but very often what it is,</p>
<p>is the removal of the hypervigilant state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to keep their use in check.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this sense of, I wanna celebrate, you know,</p>
<p>or I wanna, this reward happened,</p>
<p>I wanna put more reward on there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, really fascinating</p>
<p>because when people come to that realization</p>
<p>about themselves, that they&rsquo;re most vulnerable</p>
<p>when things are going well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really a valuable insight</p>
<p>because then they can put some, you know,</p>
<p>things in place or barriers in place,</p>
<p>or go to more meetings or whatever it is that they do,</p>
<p>you know, to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I have a friend, 40 years sober,</p>
<p>who was a severe drug and alcohol addict</p>
<p>from a very young age, really impressive person,</p>
<p>does a lot of important work</p>
<p>in the kind of at-risk youth community out in Hawaii.</p>
<p>And he said something to me, he said,</p>
<p>as former addicts often do, they&rsquo;ve got these great sayings,</p>
<p>but I think it fits very well with what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>He said, you know, no matter how far you drive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always the same distance from the ditch.</p>
<p>And I said, well, that&rsquo;s kind of depressing.</p>
<p>And he said, no, that&rsquo;s actually what gives me peace</p>
<p>because what would happen is for so many years</p>
<p>of relapsing and relapsing, getting,</p>
<p>recovering and relapsing, he felt like it was hopeless.</p>
<p>And then somehow conceptualizing</p>
<p>that the vigilance can never go away.</p>
<p>Instead of making him feel burdened,</p>
<p>it made him feel relieved.</p>
<p>So I often think about that statement, you know,</p>
<p>no matter how far you drive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always the same distance from the ditch</p>
<p>because in my mind, I conceptualize that as, gosh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tough way to drive down the road,</p>
<p>but actually on a road where you know where the ditch is</p>
<p>and where you know where the lane lines are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a pretty nice drive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t know where the shoulder is</p>
<p>that you constantly have to be looking around.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this, we&rsquo;re speaking now in analogies</p>
<p>and imagery and science.</p>
<p>But one of the things I find so incredible</p>
<p>about this community of 12-step,</p>
<p>and there are a variety of them,</p>
<p>are the communities that they create for themselves.</p>
<p>And some of these sayings, which I do believe link back</p>
<p>to really core biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I do want to ask about those communities.</p>
<p>I have a question which might be a little bit controversial.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Which is, is it possible</p>
<p>that people who were addicted to drugs or alcohol</p>
<p>or some gambling or some other behavior</p>
<p>get addicted to the addiction community?</p>
<p>Because one thing that I think I observe over and over</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s some circuit in the brain of human beings</p>
<p>that has to tell you about the dream</p>
<p>they had the night before, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another circuit that leads people to wake you up</p>
<p>if they themselves can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the circuit is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being facetious here.</p>
<p>But there does seem to also be a circuit</p>
<p>in the brain of addicts to discuss</p>
<p>and want to kind of talk about their recovery a lot.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this not to poke at them,</p>
<p>but rather the opposite,</p>
<p>because I think that one thing that is challenging,</p>
<p>at least for me and having friends</p>
<p>that have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction,</p>
<p>not all of them, but certainly some of them,</p>
<p>is when they&rsquo;re talking about their recovery,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s all they talk about.</p>
<p>This meeting, that meeting, that meeting.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m really asking here is,</p>
<p>can we become addicted to sobriety?</p>
<p>Right, so this is a great question,</p>
<p>and it links into some of the other things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about having to do with</p>
<p>where do we settle out?</p>
<p>What is the way to live between pleasure and pain?</p>
<p>And I implied earlier that ultimately</p>
<p>we want a resilient balance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sensitive to pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge,</p>
<p>even when we indulge greatly.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is that</p>
<p>people with severe addiction,</p>
<p>I believe temperamentally want those extremes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wired for that kind of intensity</p>
<p>that is more than just these slight adjustments</p>
<p>around the fulcrum, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they want the big highs and the big lows.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, great meeting.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, that was such an amazing meeting,</p>
<p>or they find a group.</p>
<p>They find a group in a location.</p>
<p>This is almost an inside joke in those communities.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not reporting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about a friend in quotes,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t me reporting,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll talk about how attractive people are</p>
<p>at a given meeting,</p>
<p>or how bonded they feel to people at a given meeting,</p>
<p>that the meetings themselves</p>
<p>become their own form of dopamine hit.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not being disparaging,</p>
<p>I just, I want to understand this.</p>
<p>Right, so yes, so a lot of times patients will say to me,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to go to AA, it&rsquo;s a cult.</p>
<p>And my response to that is,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a cult is exactly why it works, okay?</p>
<p>Because yes, it is much better for you</p>
<p>to be addicted to AA and to recovery</p>
<p>than almost any other addiction I could think of.</p>
<p>And we know from Rob Malenka&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s here at Stanford,</p>
<p>that oxytocin is the hormone that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in human pair bonding and relationships and love.</p>
<p>And it directly links to dopamine neurons</p>
<p>and causes the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>So yes, when we connect with other humans,</p>
<p>especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge dopamine hit.</p>
<p>And it does replace the dopamine that people get from drugs.</p>
<p>And for people who have this addiction temperament,</p>
<p>they need it on a more intense level.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be generally satisfied</p>
<p>with kind of, you know, sort of acquaintanceship, right?</p>
<p>They want that intensity of the intimacy</p>
<p>that you get with people</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re cathartically exposing, you know, warts and all.</p>
<p>So yes, people can get addicted to recovery</p>
<p>and good for them, go for it, you know?</p>
<p>And of course, this can be disruptive for friendships</p>
<p>and relationships where the one person is not in recovery,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going to so many meetings,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always talking about recovery, but you know what?</p>
<p>Much better than them being intoxicated, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so although you may tire of your friends</p>
<p>talking about their, you know, meetings all the time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you would rather have them do that</p>
<p>than, you know, be in their addiction, so.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and this is now the second time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done this during this discussion,</p>
<p>but now I have empathy because the way you describe</p>
<p>their enthusiasm about meetings</p>
<p>is probably the way that people feel about me and work.</p>
<p>And in neuroscience, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting up in front of the class</p>
<p>since I was eight years old</p>
<p>and talking about things I read over the weekend.</p>
<p>Now I just happen to have this thing called a podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it since I was little</p>
<p>and it annoys a lot of people, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to suppress it a little bit.</p>
<p>Some people like it, but I&rsquo;m poking fun at myself</p>
<p>just to say that I now can understand</p>
<p>that the way I feel about their reports</p>
<p>about yet another amazing meeting</p>
<p>or for, there&rsquo;s a different form of this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some people for which</p>
<p>they just love intense experiences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always like trying to pull me off to Bali</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re talking about how sensual it is.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m sure Bali is wonderful,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this kind of ratcheting up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like seeking Burning Man all year long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Burning Man,</p>
<p>no desire to go to Burning Man.</p>
<p>But inside of academia, I mean,</p>
<p>if I were to just turn the mirror at myself,</p>
<p>inside of academia or here in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>work and the pursuit of more success,</p>
<p>even if money is kind of divorced from that,</p>
<p>sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>academic work is for sake of pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like the same mechanism.</p>
<p>In fact, it feels to me very much like the same mechanism.</p>
<p>So Andrew, here&rsquo;s what I love about you.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re willing to bring your own flaws</p>
<p>and foibles to this conversation.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re really open and curious</p>
<p>and wanting to understand,</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people I have met</p>
<p>who really see addiction as some kind of otherness.</p>
<p>But the truth is we&rsquo;re all wired for addiction.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not addicted yet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s right around the corner.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Especially with the incredible panoply of new drugs</p>
<p>and behaviors that are out there.</p>
<p>So I love that you&rsquo;re willing to take a moment</p>
<p>and really try to understand this,</p>
<p>because it is, we can all relate.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re relating it to your,</p>
<p>essentially your work addiction is right and apt.</p>
<p>You just happen to be addicted to something</p>
<p>that is really socially rewarded.</p>
<p>You know, you figured that out at an early age.</p>
<p>Oh, when I do X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>all these people go, look at that smart kid</p>
<p>or whatever it is, you know.</p>
<p>For me, it made me feel safe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I felt like, yeah, I just felt like this.</p>
<p>And I paused there because it&rsquo;s like peace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ah, I can relax for a moment.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about neuroscience.</p>
<p>Or just when I feel like I&rsquo;m on the right path</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m on to something,</p>
<p>or if I see something that I&rsquo;m excited about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I feel filled with, it must be dopamine.</p>
<p>I feel flooded with pleasure, literally from head to toe.</p>
<p>And then my next thought is more.</p>
<p>So true, you&rsquo;re really, you&rsquo;re a true addict.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You are, but you just got really,</p>
<p>you really got lucky with the fact</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re drawn to is adaptive, essentially.</p>
<p>And then your challenge is going to be</p>
<p>that your life doesn&rsquo;t get too out of balance</p>
<p>in the sense that you&rsquo;re 24 seven work</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t stop and do some other things</p>
<p>or think about it.</p>
<p>And my life admittedly is somewhat asymmetric.</p>
<p>I mean, it has other components of physical health,</p>
<p>et cetera, but it is somewhat asymmetric,</p>
<p>which is why I got a dog.</p>
<p>Although I talk about him an awful lot.</p>
<p>But the dog is good because that draws you out of yourself</p>
<p>and a little bit away from the work.</p>
<p>But again, I think the key here is for people</p>
<p>who feel like they&rsquo;ve never experienced addiction</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t know anybody with addiction,</p>
<p>or if they do, they don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Just think of that one thing</p>
<p>that is the most important thing in your life that you do</p>
<p>that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>And then imagine if you couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, let&rsquo;s not talk about that.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate the feedback</p>
<p>and you can send me a bill at the end.</p>
<p>What is the most ridiculous sounding addiction</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve ever witnessed</p>
<p>that was actually a real addiction along these lines?</p>
<p>Because I think we all know the standard heroin pill.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been very, I should mention,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s important, your previous book,</p>
<p>and we will probably link to that as well,</p>
<p>focused on the opioid crisis</p>
<p>and what we thought was medication</p>
<p>and turned out to be just as bad,</p>
<p>if not worse, than a lot of so-called street drugs.</p>
<p>So we understand those gambling,</p>
<p>sex addiction, porn addiction, now video games.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about social media a little bit more in depth,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the most like, wow,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize people could get addicted to that?</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>So I had a very lovely patient</p>
<p>who had a severe alcohol addiction</p>
<p>and she got into recovery from her alcohol addiction</p>
<p>for many years,</p>
<p>but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsia</p>
<p>or an urge to be drinking something a lot.</p>
<p>And so she drank a lot of water</p>
<p>and slowly over time,</p>
<p>she realized that if she drank enough water,</p>
<p>she could become hyponatremic and delirious</p>
<p>and be out of herself.</p>
<p>You can die from it, right?</p>
<p>Right, which is,</p>
<p>she just wanted to be out of her own head.</p>
<p>And so she would periodically,</p>
<p>intentionally overdose on water</p>
<p>in order to,</p>
<p>I know it was so sad, so sad.</p>
<p>What happened to her?</p>
<p>She eventually took her own life.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>She was a lovely woman.</p>
<p>She was so bright.</p>
<p>She had so many interests and passions.</p>
<p>And of course it was very sad when she died.</p>
<p>But that was a wow to me.</p>
<p>It was like, wow,</p>
<p>if you have this disease of addiction,</p>
<p>you can even get addicted to water.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I think it just underscores</p>
<p>the generalizability of these circuits.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a brain circuit for addiction to water</p>
<p>that she happened to have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brain circuit for pleasure and pain</p>
<p>and addiction and water plugged into that circuit.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s intense.</p>
<p>In your book, Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>you also describe some amazing paths to recovery.</p>
<p>People that, from reading it,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say which ones and who,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some great surprises in the book too,</p>
<p>both tragic and triumphant, as they say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve often described your patients as your heroes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell us a little bit more about that.</p>
<p>You know, when you think about how hard it is</p>
<p>to give up a drug or a behavior that you&rsquo;re addicted to,</p>
<p>and how much courage that takes and fortitude</p>
<p>and discipline and stick-to-itiveness,</p>
<p>these people are really amazing people.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know that I could do it,</p>
<p>what they do, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and like, you know, we talked a little bit about,</p>
<p>you know, just the constant, ever-present urge to use,</p>
<p>even after sustained periods of abstinence for some people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really hard.</p>
<p>And of course, then you double down on the shame</p>
<p>that they feel because of that urge,</p>
<p>even when their lives are so much better.</p>
<p>I mean, these people are really, really remarkable.</p>
<p>And you take their remarkable accomplishment,</p>
<p>and then you imagine the world that we live in now,</p>
<p>where we are constantly invited and tempted,</p>
<p>and really bombarded with opportunities</p>
<p>to become addicted at every turn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like feeling an itch everywhere.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I mean, you can&rsquo;t escape it.</p>
<p>You know, you cannot escape it,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get an email in your inbox</p>
<p>inviting you to do X, Y, or Z,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re addicted to that thing,</p>
<p>you know, you tried to like delete all your apps</p>
<p>and not go here, all of a sudden, your work inbox,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting those images, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>really, really, really hard.</p>
<p>And yet these people find a way to do it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really wise people.</p>
<p>They have so much wisdom to offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taught me a lot.</p>
<p>You know, as I talk about in my book,</p>
<p>I have my own addictions,</p>
<p>and I really just like took a page right out of there,</p>
<p>but I was like, okay, what do I do now?</p>
<p>All right, what did this patient do?</p>
<p>What about, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna try that.</p>
<p>It is an amazing community of people</p>
<p>that they are very sage.</p>
<p>I wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is the shame.</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t go to a meeting</p>
<p>or talk to addicts without detecting</p>
<p>or hearing about like lies, shame, et cetera.</p>
<p>I heard you say in an interview</p>
<p>with somebody else recently</p>
<p>that truth-telling and secrets</p>
<p>are sort of at the core of recovery.</p>
<p>And yeah, tell us more about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so one of the things that I found really fascinating</p>
<p>about working with people in recovery</p>
<p>was how telling the truth,</p>
<p>even about the merest detail of their lives,</p>
<p>was central to their recovery.</p>
<p>And I became really curious about that.</p>
<p>Like, why would truth-telling be so important?</p>
<p>And of course, there is the obvious thing</p>
<p>that when people are in their addiction,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lying about using.</p>
<p>So part of getting into recovery</p>
<p>is to stop lying to the people they care about</p>
<p>about their use.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really more than that,</p>
<p>because what people in recovery have taught me</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not even just not lying about using drugs.</p>
<p>I have to not lie about anything.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t lie about why I was late to work this morning,</p>
<p>which we all do.</p>
<p>Oh, I hit traffic.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t hit traffic.</p>
<p>I wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper</p>
<p>or drinking my coffee, right?</p>
<p>Or just lying about, I don&rsquo;t know, where I had dinner.</p>
<p>So people with addiction will get into the lying habit</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re lying about random stuff</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re sort of in the habit of lying.</p>
<p>And how recovery is really about telling the truth</p>
<p>in all ways.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that I had a lot of fun with</p>
<p>in writing the book is sort of exploring</p>
<p>the neuroscience around why truth-telling is important</p>
<p>to leading a balanced life.</p>
<p>And we know like every religion since the beginning of time</p>
<p>is all about telling the truth.</p>
<p>Well, why, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s really interesting neuroscience behind it</p>
<p>that suggests that when we tell the truth,</p>
<p>we actually potentially strengthen</p>
<p>our prefrontal cortical circuits</p>
<p>and their connections to our limbic brain</p>
<p>and our reward brain.</p>
<p>And of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in our addiction, right?</p>
<p>Our balance in our reward pathway, our limbic brain,</p>
<p>our emotion brain is doing one thing</p>
<p>and our cortical circuits are completely disengaged</p>
<p>from that, ignoring what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>which is easy to do because it&rsquo;s reflexive.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to think about that balance</p>
<p>for the balance to be happening.</p>
<p>But we have to re-engage those circuits,</p>
<p>anticipate future consequences, think through the drink,</p>
<p>not just how am I gonna feel now if I use,</p>
<p>but how am I gonna feel tomorrow or six months from now?</p>
<p>And that telling the truth is in fact a way to do that,</p>
<p>to make these connections stronger.</p>
<p>And there, I talk about some studies in my book</p>
<p>that kind of indirectly show that.</p>
<p>So I find that really fascinating,</p>
<p>plus just that being open and honest with people</p>
<p>really does create very intimate connections.</p>
<p>And those intimate connections create dopamine.</p>
<p>So we were talking a little bit about how you know</p>
<p>a bunch of people who need intensity in their lives.</p>
<p>For me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m really not interested in</p>
<p>and bored by and made anxious by casual interactions.</p>
<p>But like having this kind of discussion with you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very intense and also intimate and self-disclosing</p>
<p>is very rewarding for me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important source of dopamine.</p>
<p>Thank God I became a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t disclose all my stuff,</p>
<p>but I am quite transparent with my patients,</p>
<p>which is a slightly unorthodox.</p>
<p>But when I think it&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m also transparent with them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a source of dopamine too,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re honest and we disclose.</p>
<p>And that you think people are going to run away from you</p>
<p>if you tell them about all like your weird neuroses,</p>
<p>but really they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re like is, oh, thank God,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, what I love about,</p>
<p>I love many things about your book.</p>
<p>I read it in one sweep.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>And I was like, wow.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised, but I was like, wow,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s really opening up in this book from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to give it away,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, yeah, you&rsquo;re very open where it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>And also I think that this question about truth-telling,</p>
<p>I always think about like, tell the truth,</p>
<p>be 100% about the truth,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also this element about,</p>
<p>do you report previous lies?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like what about prior behavior?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by this,</p>
<p>because to me, telling the truth has many facets,</p>
<p>but the three sides of this thing in my mind are,</p>
<p>one is reporting everything accurately.</p>
<p>The other is, what do you withhold?</p>
<p>What do you not withhold?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because some people will say, tell the truth</p>
<p>or at least don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of a-</p>
<p>Lies of omission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lies of omission, lies of omission.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>what I have to assume for most people is a small</p>
<p>to enormous batch of things that they lied about</p>
<p>in the past that still thread into the future.</p>
<p>So how important is it for the addict</p>
<p>or the every person really to,</p>
<p>because it sounds like cultivating the circuitry</p>
<p>between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system</p>
<p>would be great for anybody,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re all addicts, everyone should do it.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>it sounds like a good thing for everybody to do.</p>
<p>How much work needs to be done on all the priors,</p>
<p>all the stuff we&rsquo;ve hidden and,</p>
<p>I mean, not me, but all the stuff</p>
<p>that everybody else has hidden.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the steps of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous,</p>
<p>a good number of those steps are about that very thing,</p>
<p>the past, the ways that we&rsquo;ve harmed people in the past.</p>
<p>And the fourth step is about making amends,</p>
<p>you know, by admitting the ways in which</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve contributed to harming others.</p>
<p>And it is a really big piece of recovery.</p>
<p>So, you know, how important,</p>
<p>so for people with addiction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, really important to go back and make amends.</p>
<p>And, you know, the key idea there is</p>
<p>you just go back and you apologize, you know,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to get any particular kind of response</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t need to be forgiven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the act itself of apologizing about</p>
<p>the ways in which we&rsquo;ve harmed or lied to people</p>
<p>in the past that is cathartic and renewing</p>
<p>and allows us to kind of shed this skin</p>
<p>and be new in our lives and begin again,</p>
<p>sort of absolved, you know, of past sins, so to speak.</p>
<p>So it is really important.</p>
<p>You know, are there situations</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s maybe not a good idea</p>
<p>because of that person or the nature?</p>
<p>Sure, you know, there are always gonna be,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re talking about not like Kant&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>about like never lie, but you know,</p>
<p>robbers in your house and you&rsquo;re stowaway.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t lie even about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, there are probably situations where,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>For sake of other people&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, there, you can think of a million scenarios,</p>
<p>but in general, you know, when we&rsquo;re taking stock,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>but I have a lot of regrets and guilt</p>
<p>about a lot of things in my life.</p>
<p>And they kind of haunt me.</p>
<p>You know, and sometimes I&rsquo;ll have nightmares, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true for most people.</p>
<p>I mean, I occasionally will meet somebody who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any regrets in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow.</p>
<p>Like, I cannot relate to that at all.</p>
<p>So, you know, this idea of like catharsis and well,</p>
<p>I mean, in the 12 steps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s telling God or your higher power,</p>
<p>telling another human being the ways</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;ve wronged others,</p>
<p>considering your own character defects</p>
<p>and how those have contributed.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s a really important piece</p>
<p>and something that we don&rsquo;t do enough in our current culture,</p>
<p>especially in psychiatry, frankly,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of eternally empathizing with patients,</p>
<p>but not a whole lot of like going, well, you know,</p>
<p>actually you kind of messed that up.</p>
<p>Or like, that was really bad on you.</p>
<p>You know, and in my work,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily use that language,</p>
<p>but, you know, patients may say like,</p>
<p>I really feel badly about, you know, this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>I understand that you feel.</p>
<p>Well, guilt is a, there&rsquo;s a circuit for that too.</p>
<p>Right, and it&rsquo;s important, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also important to recovery</p>
<p>and to not becoming addicted,</p>
<p>you know, experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame</p>
<p>for things that we have done.</p>
<p>And, you know, feeling the pain that comes with shame,</p>
<p>which is an incredibly painful emotion, right?</p>
<p>And I think that may be the one</p>
<p>that we all try to avoid more than any other,</p>
<p>is like that shame of not being liked</p>
<p>or not being accepted or not being celebrated.</p>
<p>Or that the thing that we did is really despicable.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s really, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, oh my God, I did that horrible thing.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And then, so, I mean, I&rsquo;ve done horrible things</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t gone back and said,</p>
<p>I did this horrible thing,</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;ve tried to pay it forward.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve told my kids, you know, when I was younger,</p>
<p>I did this horrible thing and it still haunts me.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re ever tempted to do something like what I did,</p>
<p>you might think about my situation.</p>
<p>So, you know, some kind of way,</p>
<p>but I think wrestling with that is important.</p>
<p>All right, I think it&rsquo;s a really important element</p>
<p>to all of this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not, I love that there&rsquo;s neuroscience</p>
<p>being done on truth-telling and the value of truth-telling.</p>
<p>I think if I were to predict a new and truly exciting area</p>
<p>that people are going to be really curious about,</p>
<p>in this huge sphere we call neuroscience,</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll continue to do more work.</p>
<p>Also speaks to, I&rsquo;m so glad to hear</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening here at Stanford.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s, well, the literature that I look at</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t Stanford work, but there&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>There might be people that say,</p>
<p>Regardless of where it&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>more of that and all the rest, please.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction.</p>
<p>These days, there&rsquo;s a growing interest</p>
<p>or at least discussion about Ibogaine.</p>
<p>People going out of country,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s still illegal here,</p>
<p>or is illegal here, going out of country to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, either inject it or smoke it</p>
<p>or whatever it is,</p>
<p>or people going and doing ayahuasca journeys or MDMA,</p>
<p>which is still an illegal drug in this country,</p>
<p>but there are clinical trials.</p>
<p>There are people on this campus doing experimental studies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of clinical trials,</p>
<p>but at Johns Hopkins, there are clinical trials.</p>
<p>Et cetera.</p>
<p>So this is a vast area, right?</p>
<p>Different chemistries for different drugs</p>
<p>and different purposes,</p>
<p>but the rationale as I understand it</p>
<p>is take people who are in a pattern of addiction,</p>
<p>launch them into a experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also chemical and extreme,</p>
<p>often of the extreme serotonin and or extreme dopamine type.</p>
<p>So MDMA, ecstasy, for instance,</p>
<p>tons of serotonin dumped,</p>
<p>tons of dopamine dumped,</p>
<p>how neurotoxic, if neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera, not a topic for now, but a lot.</p>
<p>And then somehow that extreme experience</p>
<p>wrapped inside of a supported network in there,</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s just someone there</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re actively working through something</p>
<p>with the patient is supposed to eject the person</p>
<p>into a life where drug use isn&rsquo;t as much of interest.</p>
<p>This violates, at a purely rational level,</p>
<p>this violates everything that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in terms of dopamine biology.</p>
<p>It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it,</p>
<p>cause more addiction.</p>
<p>It is anything but a dopamine fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dopamine feast.</p>
<p>So we hear about successful transitions through this,</p>
<p>at least anecdotally,</p>
<p>and maybe some clinic will say,</p>
<p>what is going on?</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re skeptical.</p>
<p>I think we all should be skeptical.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are clinical studies showing,</p>
<p>you know, and these are small studies</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re short duration, small number of subjects,</p>
<p>but, you know, taking people, for example,</p>
<p>who are addicted to alcohol,</p>
<p>and then having them have this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say psychedelic experience</p>
<p>in a very controlled setting.</p>
<p>So either, typically it&rsquo;s a high dose psilocybin</p>
<p>or three dose, as I saw it for the MAP study of MDMA,</p>
<p>of ecstasy.</p>
<p>Those are sort of the, seem to be the kind of bread</p>
<p>and butter of this kind of work.</p>
<p>But the thing to really keep in mind</p>
<p>is that this is completely interwoven</p>
<p>with regular psychotherapy.</p>
<p>And that these are highly selected individuals.</p>
<p>And clinical trials.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And these are clinical trials.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re referring to legal clinical trials.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think the metaphor</p>
<p>that helps me think about this is,</p>
<p>there are many ways to the top of the mountain,</p>
<p>and these are sort of like taking the gondola</p>
<p>instead of walking up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, instead of doing like a year of psychoanalysis</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sitting on the couch every week,</p>
<p>reflecting on your life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a condensed version of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy</p>
<p>plus, you know, MDMA, which gets you there faster.</p>
<p>Creates the intimacy, presumably, because of this.</p>
<p>Well, I think the main thing that happens</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s beneficial is it just allows the person</p>
<p>to get outside of their own head</p>
<p>and look at their lives on a much broader sweep.</p>
<p>And to consider themselves not mired</p>
<p>in the, you know, quotidian sort of details of their life,</p>
<p>but rather as a human on the large planet Earth</p>
<p>in the vast universe.</p>
<p>So I think it takes, it&rsquo;s like, when it works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a transformational experience</p>
<p>because it gives the person another lens</p>
<p>through which to view their life, their lives,</p>
<p>which I think, for some people, is positive and powerful</p>
<p>because they can come back from that and be like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I care about my family</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t, I want X, Y, or Z for them.</p>
<p>And I realize that my continuing to drink</p>
<p>is not going to, you know, achieve that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a spiritual or values-based.</p>
<p>So I think it can be very powerful.</p>
<p>But having said that, I truly am quite skeptical</p>
<p>because, you know, addiction is a chronic relapsing</p>
<p>and remitting problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that works very quickly short-term</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to work for a disease</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really long-lasting.</p>
<p>Yeah, the two addicts I know</p>
<p>that did MDMA-assisted psychotherapy</p>
<p>as part of this thing, both got worse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the people I know who had severe trauma,</p>
<p>who did this, who took this approach,</p>
<p>seem to be doing better.</p>
<p>Okay, interesting.</p>
<p>And so I think that the discussion as we hear it now</p>
<p>is just sort of psychedelics, which is a huge category</p>
<p>that includes many different drugs</p>
<p>and compounds with different effects.</p>
<p>And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped together.</p>
<p>And I think that I&rsquo;m a splitter, not a lumper,</p>
<p>as we say in science.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s going to be important for people</p>
<p>to know that this is definitely not</p>
<p>a one-size-fits-all kind of thing.</p>
<p>But it sounds like it may have some utility</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m trying to be very open-minded</p>
<p>about its potential utility for certain individuals.</p>
<p>But I can tell you in my clinical work,</p>
<p>what is a very concerning unintended consequence</p>
<p>of this narrative is I have a lot of people</p>
<p>who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening</p>
<p>who on their own, not in the context</p>
<p>of any kind of therapeutic psychological work,</p>
<p>you know, microdose or wanna try psilocybin</p>
<p>or MDMA with a friend or wherever</p>
<p>so they can have this spiritual experience</p>
<p>that they can figure out their lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a disaster and almost never works out well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve then had people who literally,</p>
<p>supposedly you can&rsquo;t get addicted to psychedelics</p>
<p>because something with the biochemistry,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t fully understand</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>But I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted</p>
<p>to, you know, MDMA, to microdosing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very concerning to me</p>
<p>because like, you know, Pollen&rsquo;s How to Change Your Mind,</p>
<p>that, you know, I respect that work,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s penetrated the culture.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and I don&rsquo;t know him</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t have a problem taking a stance.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just say my stance on that is the narrative</p>
<p>of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast</p>
<p>that pretty soon people are essentially</p>
<p>taking their mental health into their own hands.</p>
<p>And I actually, I have great optimism</p>
<p>for this business of clinical use of psychedelics,</p>
<p>including MDMA.</p>
<p>Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins</p>
<p>is doing fabulous work on this</p>
<p>and there are others too, of course,</p>
<p>but those are controlled settings.</p>
<p>And the pharmacology is being tuned up.</p>
<p>And one thing that I think is coming,</p>
<p>there are several papers published recently</p>
<p>in great journals like Nature and Science, et cetera,</p>
<p>where there are scientists</p>
<p>who are removing the hallucinogenic components</p>
<p>of these drugs and finding that they still have</p>
<p>the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p>And so the experience of a psychedelic</p>
<p>and the long-term effects of the psychedelic</p>
<p>might actually be dissociable.</p>
<p>And so I, again, and I&rsquo;m always careful to say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither for something or against it.</p>
<p>I just think that treading carefully is what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And I can just tell you that the downstream effect</p>
<p>for the average person,</p>
<p>many of whom present in our clinic,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve misconstrued the data</p>
<p>on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions</p>
<p>to this idea that they&rsquo;re safe</p>
<p>or that anybody can take them in any circumstance</p>
<p>and have this kind of awakening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what the data show, right?</p>
<p>The data are these highly controlled settings,</p>
<p>carefully selected patients.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my worry.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to be sitting down with Matthew Johnson</p>
<p>at some point and we&rsquo;ll discuss this.</p>
<p>And I think that that care</p>
<p>and that cocoon of real clinical care</p>
<p>does seem to be an important component.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad we could touch on it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get a bunch of comments telling me.</p>
<p>But I think it is important to explore things</p>
<p>from all sides.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we do as scientists.</p>
<p>And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed the book, actually.</p>
<p>But I think that people run with ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t walk with them, they sprint.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>There are a couple other things I just want to touch on,</p>
<p>but they all relate to social media.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You were featured in the Social Dilemma.</p>
<p>It was a powerful movie.</p>
<p>I think many people avoided seeing that movie</p>
<p>because it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are</p>
<p>and how manipulated we all are.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have changed behavior much.</p>
<p>I have to say that the movie changed my understanding</p>
<p>and my perception, but not my behavior too much.</p>
<p>If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s making our lives worse</p>
<p>or us less functional at work and in relationships,</p>
<p>I could imagine a version of social media</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s making me more connected.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a podcast after all.</p>
<p>I post videos.</p>
<p>This will show up on YouTube</p>
<p>and elements of it on Instagram as well.</p>
<p>Much like sugar or other things,</p>
<p>I have to imagine that we need to regulate,</p>
<p>not necessarily eliminate this behavior.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about what that looks like.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about what you&rsquo;ve referred to</p>
<p>as this narcissistic preoccupation</p>
<p>that social media is creating,</p>
<p>that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look</p>
<p>and how we sound and how we are being perceived</p>
<p>than we were 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So first of all, social media,</p>
<p>how addicting is it really?</p>
<p>And what is healthy social media behavior?</p>
<p>So the first message I would want to get across</p>
<p>about social media is that it really is a drug</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s engineered to be a drug.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s based on potency, quantity, variety,</p>
<p>the bottomless bowls, the likes,</p>
<p>the way that it&rsquo;s enumerated, all of that,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t use it,</p>
<p>but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it,</p>
<p>just like we need to be thoughtful</p>
<p>about the way we use any drug.</p>
<p>And so that means with intention</p>
<p>and in advance planning our use, right?</p>
<p>And trying to use it as a really awesome tool</p>
<p>to potentially connect with other people</p>
<p>and not to be used by it or get lost in it.</p>
<p>And of course, people are gonna come</p>
<p>with different propensities for addiction to any drug,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true for social media too.</p>
<p>Some people will have no problem using it in moderation</p>
<p>or using it in a way that&rsquo;s adaptive</p>
<p>and other people will immediately get sucked in.</p>
<p>And the key thing about getting addicted</p>
<p>is when it&rsquo;s happening, nobody who&rsquo;s getting addicted</p>
<p>thinks they&rsquo;re getting addicted, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only after the fact that we go,</p>
<p>whoops, what was that about?</p>
<p>Well, remember texting and driving?</p>
<p>There were all these books about texting and driving,</p>
<p>how terrible it was.</p>
<p>Even the governments have largely given up.</p>
<p>You see these billboards, like don&rsquo;t text and drive</p>
<p>or any text can wait or not worth dying for,</p>
<p>but everybody&rsquo;s texting and driving.</p>
<p>Right, and if you look at young people today, teenagers,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re basically cybernetically enhanced</p>
<p>that the phone is there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re talking to you</p>
<p>and texting 12 friends at the same time,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no stopping it.</p>
<p>I mean, the genie is out of the bottle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going back.</p>
<p>So we do need to figure out how to make this tool</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s gonna be good for us</p>
<p>and not ultimately harmful.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have all the answers</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination,</p>
<p>but I do think some of the wisdom that we have learned</p>
<p>from using other drugs also applies to social media,</p>
<p>which is to say that we have to, again,</p>
<p>put barriers in place that allow us</p>
<p>to remain in control of our use,</p>
<p>which means not too much, not too often, not too potent.</p>
<p>Do you think in going back to this idea</p>
<p>of the unit of the day being a good tractable unit,</p>
<p>a manageable unit of time for most people,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying in advance,</p>
<p>so allocating two hours in which you&rsquo;re going to allow</p>
<p>yourself to have free reign use of the phone</p>
<p>and all its apps and all its things,</p>
<p>or even more restricted than that,</p>
<p>meaning, okay, I&rsquo;m only gonna allow myself 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>to post and comment,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s a closeout completely?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think it depends on the person,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of a combination.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about having an itch</p>
<p>and scratching yourself at night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten to a point with smartphones,</p>
<p>people are pulling them out,</p>
<p>and they are utterly unconscious of doing so,</p>
<p>pulling them out, a couple texts, a couple,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>I have a friend who works and delivers babies,</p>
<p>and many pregnant mothers</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t actually deliver without their phone in hand,</p>
<p>and this used to be the hand</p>
<p>that was connected to their spouse.</p>
<p>This may be a comment on spouses more than on phones,</p>
<p>but it sounds like it&rsquo;s a kind of a security blanket.</p>
<p>Right, like a transitional object, yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, that reminds me, you&rsquo;ve referred to the phone,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the phone,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s our online persona or ourselves</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve become sort of infantile in our need for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a baby in a bottle,</p>
<p>and so I do wonder if we have regressed,</p>
<p>and I do think we&rsquo;ve regressed a bit</p>
<p>in terms of our online behavior,</p>
<p>our inability to act like,</p>
<p>I always thought an adult</p>
<p>was somebody that can control their behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between a baby and an adult.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a developmental neurobiologist</p>
<p>for very long to understand that a young organism</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t control its behavior and an older one can.</p>
<p>So to me, a mature organism, mature in years organism</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t control its behavior is a baby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an immature version of itself,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s neuroscience to support that statement.</p>
<p>I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes,</p>
<p>and I think, I&rsquo;m a grown man.</p>
<p>Like, what is the problem here, right?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t eat baby food,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m acting like a baby with the phone, all right?</p>
<p>In the sense that I&rsquo;m reflexively picking it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being intentioned and deliberate with it.</p>
<p>Do I need a full 30 days, Anna?</p>
<p>30 days away from my phone?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s my recommendation, the full 30 days to reset.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re severely addicted, I recommend the 30 days,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re just a little bit addicted like most of us,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t need 30 days.</p>
<p>In fact, a single day not only would be challenging,</p>
<p>but probably maybe sufficient.</p>
<p>My phone is off for substantial segments of the day.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it drives other people crazy.</p>
<p>People expect me to respond, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I actually take a little bit of pleasure</p>
<p>in the fact that, well, because I think the point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make is the right one,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s not just right for me,</p>
<p>but like why, I don&rsquo;t see a clause on text messages</p>
<p>or emails that say, must be responded to</p>
<p>within X amount of time or else, or else.</p>
<p>So I take the liberty of replying when I&rsquo;m able to.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Or want to.</p>
<p>Right, which touches on one of the big challenges</p>
<p>about social media is that as more and more of us</p>
<p>are spending more and more time on social media,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re divesting our libidinous energies, et cetera,</p>
<p>from real life interactions.</p>
<p>So that means even when we want to choose</p>
<p>to not be online connecting, we go outside</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no there there, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody else there.</p>
<p>So I think our collective challenge,</p>
<p>and it should be our mission,</p>
<p>is to make sure that we are preserving</p>
<p>and maintaining offline ways to connect with each other.</p>
<p>Because if we don&rsquo;t do that, then we&rsquo;ll be very lonely,</p>
<p>right, if we were not online.</p>
<p>But if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with,</p>
<p>none of whom are on their phones while you&rsquo;re together</p>
<p>for that discrete amount of time,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s wonderful and liberating and nobody&rsquo;s distracted.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really the key.</p>
<p>And I think young people are figuring that out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to create these spaces or try to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, instead of doing a dopamine fast by yourself,</p>
<p>do it with your friends, right?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the FOMO is less, the fear of missing out,</p>
<p>because, oh, you&rsquo;re all doing the dopamine fast together.</p>
<p>So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, good.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t allow, I have a home gym and I love working out.</p>
<p>I just enjoy it and I always have.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t allow my phone in my gym anymore.</p>
<p>And I live in an area where I don&rsquo;t get any reception,</p>
<p>like two meters outside my door.</p>
<p>So all my dog walks now are just with the dog.</p>
<p>And they were boring as hell.</p>
<p>I also have a bulldog.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t like to walk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really slow.</p>
<p>And it was so boring for a while.</p>
<p>Because I was so used to taking calls while I walk</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s super efficient.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t I do that?</p>
<p>The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day.</p>
<p>Because, and if the phone were,</p>
<p>if I were to get a call on one of those</p>
<p>and they brought reception in the area,</p>
<p>I would be very dismayed.</p>
<p>So I can attest to this.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a phone addict,</p>
<p>but I do put work into regulating my phone behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, so this is the key.</p>
<p>You have to, with intention,</p>
<p>prior to being in that situation,</p>
<p>think of literal physical and metacognitive barriers</p>
<p>that you can put between yourself and your phone</p>
<p>or whatever your drug is,</p>
<p>to create these intentional spaces</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not constantly interrupting yourself,</p>
<p>essentially, and distracting yourself.</p>
<p>Because I really do think,</p>
<p>I think we talked just before we started with the interview,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re losing the ability to have a sustained thought, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we get so far,</p>
<p>and then you get to that point in the thought</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a little bit hard to know what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very easy to check your phone or check your email</p>
<p>or look something up on the internet.</p>
<p>And then you never get that opportunity</p>
<p>to finish that thought,</p>
<p>which is really the source of creative energy</p>
<p>and an original thought, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just reacting to what&rsquo;s coming at you.</p>
<p>Right, and something that could contribute to the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that you&rsquo;re either consuming</p>
<p>or you are creating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there is, I should mention, it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I do believe in neutral time.</p>
<p>I think sleep is great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of sleep</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about it on the podcast.</p>
<p>I care a lot about sleep</p>
<p>and not just for sake of performance.</p>
<p>I actually just really like sleep.</p>
<p>I think that being a constant consumer of visual information</p>
<p>and information of all kinds can be a problem.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some really great sources of information</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>And I certainly benefit from the fact</p>
<p>that those channels exist.</p>
<p>Narcissistic preoccupation.</p>
<p>Am I a narcissist?</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s healthy-</p>
<p>Or is the fact that I asked, does that take me out of,</p>
<p>would a narcissist never ask that question?</p>
<p>Oh yes, a highly sophisticated narcissist</p>
<p>would know to do that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not very sophisticated.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s healthy narcissism,</p>
<p>which means that we all invest our personal energies</p>
<p>into things that we care about.</p>
<p>And if our competence in that arena is threatened,</p>
<p>we would all experience a narcissistic injury</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s normal and healthy.</p>
<p>But we are living in a narcissistic culture.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not news,</p>
<p>this preoccupation with individual achievement</p>
<p>and individual self-worth and individual self-confidence.</p>
<p>And I think all of that is just fueled by social media</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not just seeing ourselves,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re seeing people&rsquo;s reactions to ourselves</p>
<p>and every single thing we say or do,</p>
<p>we get likes and this and that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really insidious.</p>
<p>And it contributes, I think, ultimately</p>
<p>to a lot of personal shame</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not really meant to be individuals</p>
<p>bouncing around in the universe, we&rsquo;re social animals.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re probably generally happiest,</p>
<p>even for natural contrarians among us,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re part of a tribe, right?</p>
<p>And if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves</p>
<p>from that tribe, I think that the brain&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>and instinctive corrective mechanism against that</p>
<p>is self-loathing and shame.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s so ironic because the culture tells us</p>
<p>if we just achieve more, we&rsquo;ll like ourselves more.</p>
<p>But the truth is actually the opposite,</p>
<p>that I think when people get these pinnacles</p>
<p>of personal achievement,</p>
<p>you have things like the imposter syndrome or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re at Stanford</p>
<p>after a lot of high achievers here, right?</p>
<p>Some phenomenal, amazing people like yourself</p>
<p>and other colleagues of mine that just, I&rsquo;m always in awe.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>Like, the mean is shifted so high.</p>
<p>And also people who have amazing paths to get here</p>
<p>coming from very little, accomplishing so much.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the pressure, right?</p>
<p>You know, the way that this career was described to me</p>
<p>the day I got my job was one colleague of mine,</p>
<p>the late Ben Behrer, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Welcome to schizophrenia</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re never going to be able to complete anything</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;without getting interrupted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was partially true.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve created buffers.</p>
<p>And the other one, very successful scientist</p>
<p>and a member of the National Academy, et cetera,</p>
<p>said to me, you know, just remember it&rsquo;s pinball.</p>
<p>You never win.</p>
<p>The best you can do is just keep playing.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, okay, okay.</p>
<p>And then you just go.</p>
<p>But I think that as we achieve more,</p>
<p>not just academics, of course,</p>
<p>but as anyone achieves more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the relishing in the accomplishment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s often the desire for more,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the pressure of,</p>
<p>well, now I have to do this for the next 30 years,</p>
<p>even though I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the pressure of, well, if the mountain is this high,</p>
<p>then how do I get here and here and here?</p>
<p>And then you start shoveling more dirt on</p>
<p>so you can keep climbing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>And I think that the perception of success</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a roar of the crowd and you cruise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t cruise.</p>
<p>They just give you more to do.</p>
<p>Or you give yourself more to do.</p>
<p>Well, what I think is, at least in my life experience,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve heard this from other people as well,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s that prize that we&rsquo;re going for</p>
<p>that if we get it, is so unsatisfying.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the prize that we never imagined</p>
<p>that we kind of go, well, how did that happen?</p>
<p>But gee, you know, that feels good.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very, you know, it&rsquo;s cure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cure?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mirage in the one case.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a, yeah, it&rsquo;s on the one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like dopamine can create these mirages.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s some place there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And if I just, it&rsquo;s that pot of gold, right?</p>
<p>If I just-</p>
<p>Constant dopamine.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I think this, you know, this really, I think,</p>
<p>is related to our discussion earlier</p>
<p>about this taking it one day at a time</p>
<p>or paying attention to that, you know,</p>
<p>24 hour period in your environment.</p>
<p>I am absolutely fascinated by the ways</p>
<p>in which we accumulate success when we do that,</p>
<p>totally independent of the desire for success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really process oriented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where am I today?</p>
<p>How can I make today a good and meaningful day,</p>
<p>a little bit better or as good as some other days I&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<p>Constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment</p>
<p>that we call, you know, our human existence.</p>
<p>And when we do that in a way that&rsquo;s authentic</p>
<p>and paying attention and value driven,</p>
<p>whatever our, you know, values are informed by,</p>
<p>it is very, very interesting how those days, again,</p>
<p>accumulate and you find, wow,</p>
<p>I guess I contributed something of value there,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t trying to do that.</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>I mean, what I&rsquo;m so amazed by is like, you know,</p>
<p>20 years ago when I went to Stanford Medical School,</p>
<p>25 years ago, you know, I just,</p>
<p>I was happy to just be a good doctor.</p>
<p>I was like, I guess I&rsquo;m just gonna try to figure out</p>
<p>how to be a good doctor and I&rsquo;m here to learn that.</p>
<p>And now I see these medical students and they&rsquo;re wonderful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re brilliant and they&rsquo;re well-intentioned, all that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re like, how can I, you know,</p>
<p>write the great American novel, do my startup,</p>
<p>go to Africa, apply for that grant?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, really?</p>
<p>I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, as you say, it&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also kind of a weird leapfrogging</p>
<p>of the real way to accomplish something.</p>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t about like, oh, how can I accomplish something?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what can I do today</p>
<p>that would be of service, right?</p>
<p>And then finding that, of trying to be of service,</p>
<p>you know, and not really going for recognition</p>
<p>can sometimes lead to what people call success.</p>
<p>Although that wasn&rsquo;t what you were aiming for.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all the more beautiful</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re aiming for.</p>
<p>Oh, so much better, so much better.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a big believer that when one can</p>
<p>align their compulsion with some greater good.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The service to humanity or the planet or animals,</p>
<p>whatever it is, that&rsquo;s where the really good stuff emerges.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of reciprocity there.</p>
<p>The world starts to, you&rsquo;re supporting the world,</p>
<p>and then it starts to support you</p>
<p>in a way that feels very fluid.</p>
<p>And that comes back, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, that speaks to like your generosity to me,</p>
<p>vis-a-vis my book.</p>
<p>And I have to say-</p>
<p>Well, I love the book.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re not in a business deal, folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just purely that I heard Anna lecture in my course.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn more about dopamine.</p>
<p>She taught me.</p>
<p>I asked her if she would come on the podcast.</p>
<p>Turned out she wrote this amazing book.</p>
<p>She sent me a copy of the book.</p>
<p>I read it in one sweep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And I love it.</p>
<p>So just like the eight-year-old version of me,</p>
<p>now the 45 version of myself,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop blabbing about the things I love.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But I have to say I have been surprised by your generosity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve encountered frequently at Stanford,</p>
<p>which is a wonderful place,</p>
<p>but there is a general sense</p>
<p>that if I give away to somebody else,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost something,</p>
<p>which is not the right way to think about it,</p>
<p>not how you are, and also not how the world works.</p>
<p>Because when we give away to other people,</p>
<p>we get back so much more, but it takes a long time.</p>
<p>And it might not come through that path.</p>
<p>I never think about reciprocity,</p>
<p>but I was weaned by good advisors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I just sort of got drilled into me</p>
<p>that the more you give, the better your immediate life is.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>But I also don&rsquo;t have a long-term vision.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just excited about the book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited that people are learning</p>
<p>about the brain and dopamine.</p>
<p>I have to admit, having grown up in neuroscience,</p>
<p>essentially, I did not understand</p>
<p>that pleasure and pain were orchestrated</p>
<p>the way that they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very mindful of it now.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s changed a number of my behaviors.</p>
<p>I know a number of people are going to have questions</p>
<p>and want to get in contact with you.</p>
<p>You are not on social media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, yes.</p>
<p>And you are true to your ideology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is just</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to control myself.</p>
<p>I mean, that really would be my drug.</p>
<p>People are my drug.</p>
<p>Intimacy is my drug, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to manage it.</p>
<p>And so it was just easier for me to not do it at all</p>
<p>rather than try to moderate it.</p>
<p>Well, the book, as you mentioned before,</p>
<p>and as I can attest to, it has a certain intimacy.</p>
<p>People get to know you through the book.</p>
<p>So definitely check out the book.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the book, et cetera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome to send them my way.</p>
<p>I will buffer you from all those questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll filter them.</p>
<p>Okay, Anna, Dr. Lemke, I should be a formal,</p>
<p>forgive me, I&rsquo;ve been referring to you</p>
<p>the whole way through-</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re colleagues,</p>
<p>but thank you so much for sharing this information.</p>
<p>And I know I learned a ton,</p>
<p>and I know everyone else is going to learn</p>
<p>a lot more about addiction and the good side of dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really, really great to talk with you.</p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my discussion</p>
<p>with Dr. Anna Lemke.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.</p>
<p>Please be sure to check out her new book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.</p>
<p>You can pre-order it on Amazon</p>
<p>or any places where books are sold.</p>

<p>all about addiction and dopamine.</p>
