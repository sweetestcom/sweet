    <p>How mad is Saks gonna get when he sees my button situation today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna join you. Jamal, how you doing?</p>
<p>Oh my god, look at the collar situation. Look at the button situation. Look at that.</p>
<p>Oh, this is fantastic.</p>
<p>Oh, hey besties.</p>
<p>Just got off the lake.</p>
<p>Where the lake?</p>
<p>I just got off the lake. Yeah, I was just on the lake with the boat.</p>
<p>Lake Como? Where were you?</p>
<p>I was doing a little wakeboarding Tahoe. Yeah, I was still wakeboarding. Me and Saks.</p>
<p>Me and Nat took all five kids and we navigated the entire island of Sardinia for eight days.</p>
<p>Amazing. And by when you say we navigated, you mean the crew navigated and you ate seafood.</p>
<p>Yeah, it took a village.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to episode 91. Episode 91 of the All In podcast. Yeah, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still here. Lots of news to discuss this week with me, of course, to chop it up from his</p>
<p>deposition room, the war room, the rain man himself, David Saks. How you doing, brother?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Big week for you?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all big weeks. They&rsquo;re all big weeks.</p>
<p>You look tired.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re recording pretty early today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little exhausting.</p>
<p>You actually look really tired.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I just got off the lake. I feel fresh. I was just wakeboarding</p>
<p>this morning on Lake Tahoe. I feel refreshed. I&rsquo;m refreshed. And of course, in front of his</p>
<p>nine dollar clip art that he blew up on EasyPrince.org, the sultan of science himself,</p>
<p>David Freeberg. How are you, sir?</p>
<p>Always great to be with you, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Are you working?</p>
<p>It boosts my self-esteem and my morale to be with you every morning that we get to connect over Zoom.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad that your performance has been stratospheric the last three weeks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going on a hot streak. Let&rsquo;s see if you can continue it on episode 91.</p>
<p>And missing many buttons this week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got at least a three or four button August going. How are you doing,</p>
<p>dictator from your island, the remote island? Did you, you invaded an island?</p>
<p>Markets go up another 5% and one more button comes undone.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it. So this is 20% up and we could go to 25.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bull shirt. Daddy&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The more bullish he gets on the market, the more he unbuttons.</p>
<p>Daddy&rsquo;s back. So the low-rise jeans on right now, or are you wearing shorts?</p>
<p>What are you wearing? Show us those stick legs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wearing these beautiful linen shorts.</p>
<p>Can you stand up and show us?</p>
<p>Yeah, come on. Give us a 360. Come on. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>But these are the most beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little too much thigh.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s like a chicken wing.</p>
<p>You guys like this?</p>
<p>It looks tight too.</p>
<p>Very tight. Are you?</p>
<p>Yeah. Those are definitely yours.</p>
<p>Are you wearing like a children&rsquo;s size or something? Is that a junior size?</p>
<p>I like, you know, I like the tighter sizes.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>I do like the tighter sizes. I think they, uh, they, they</p>
<p>one person body type, accentuate all the little bumps and</p>
<p>nodules.</p>
<p>Too much information. All right. Let&rsquo;s start with, um, there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about this week.</p>
<p>I think one of the most interesting things last week, we were talking about it in the</p>
<p>group chat that doesn&rsquo;t exist. Vision funds, $21 billion investment loss for the quarter.</p>
<p>Masayoshi San did a really great YouTube video. I sent it around. Did he get any of you guys</p>
<p>watch the video?</p>
<p>Yes. No.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really interesting to watch. We&rsquo;ll put it in the show notes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a six minute interview. He put on his earnings page,</p>
<p>right? Like right when they put out quarterly earnings, he&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s my interview.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, he comes to a podium and basically talks about, uh, the vision fund.</p>
<p>Obviously, if people don&rsquo;t know the vision fund, one was a hundred billion dollars,</p>
<p>largest venture fund ever raised. Um, and SoftBank&rsquo;s current market cap is 66 billion.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quote from the FT article sunset on Monday, that SoftBank</p>
<p>would now subject itself to dramatic cost cutting exercise. Uh, after a $59 billion</p>
<p>investment gain at the two vision funds, almost completely reversed over the past six months,</p>
<p>they were up almost $60 billion at the peak. And it came crashing down.</p>
<p>Masa kicked off the presentation showing portraits of Togugawa,</p>
<p>Tokugawa, Gawa, uh, Yasu. This is the, uh, founding Shogun of Japan&rsquo;s, uh, Tokugawa Shogunate.</p>
<p>And, uh, you ruled Japan for six. I mean, I&rsquo;m killing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a long intro.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s so hard. Yeah. I mean, but it was just so great. Let me just play a clip for you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 68 second clip and we&rsquo;ll talk about it right after,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get into what all this means.</p>
<p>This is a portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu. He actually made a big loss against Takeda Shingen</p>
<p>and came back in the background of that Tokugawa Ieyasu had to face Takeda Shingen,</p>
<p>which is much, much larger army than theirs.</p>
<p>And, uh, most of the allies actually said, uh, this is going to be the losing battle</p>
<p>so that they should not go for it, but actually it&rsquo;s better to stay at the castle.</p>
<p>However, Tokugawa Ieyasu didn&rsquo;t want to lose his face so that he get out from the castle,</p>
<p>had a battle, made a complete loss and suffer, uh, and came back.</p>
<p>And that actually learn lesson, he tried to remember and remind his own learnings</p>
<p>and put it into this drawing. So since the foundation of Softbank Group,</p>
<p>I made that two consecutive quarters loss. So previous quarter and this time quarter,</p>
<p>consecutively, we made 3 trillion yen level of the loss. So in total, 6 trillion yen loss,</p>
<p>was made in the past six months. So I believe I need to remind that myself.</p>
<p>Pretty spectacular loss. And then he goes on to take some Q and A, and this is the,</p>
<p>I guess the killer quote, when we were turning out big profits, I became somewhat delirious</p>
<p>and looking back at myself, I am quite embarrassed and remorseful. You remember,</p>
<p>of course, and he complained a little bit in the, in this whole thing about how there was</p>
<p>a giant bubble without ever recognizing that he kind of created the bubble with a $4 billion check</p>
<p>to we work at a $47 billion valuation after a 20 minute meeting with Adam Newman.</p>
<p>This chart is pretty incredible. This is the net income quarterly,</p>
<p>essentially, you can think of Softbank as like a holding company of a bunch of</p>
<p>different assets, including Alibaba, previously Uber, and all of this vision fund stuff,</p>
<p>97% decrease in terms of deployment of capital. So if you look at capital deployment as well,</p>
<p>nobody ever put this much money to work, especially in privates.</p>
<p>The second chart, if you look in q1 of 2021, they put 20 billion into work, and then q1 this year,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting 600 million to work. Just quick reflections on this, what we saw here with</p>
<p>Masayoshi San deploying $100 billion at the top of the market into me, it&rsquo;s basically creating</p>
<p>the market top trim off other lessons here, or takeaways for you. I mean, I think that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to understand that. If you&rsquo;re going to attempt to be great, there are going to be</p>
<p>moments where you look the exact opposite of great. You know, the guy that takes the final</p>
<p>shot is the same guy that can miss the final shot. And here is a guy over his, you know,</p>
<p>50 year career has had some huge ups and downs. This is also the same guy that found a way</p>
<p>to rip in 25 or $30 million and made 125 billion off of Alibaba. That&rsquo;s the same kind of person who</p>
<p>has that kind of risk tolerance. He was for seven minutes or something, the richest person in the</p>
<p>world, and then lost 99% of his wealth in the.com bubble. I have enormous respect for a person like</p>
<p>this, because I feel like it takes enormous amounts of courage. I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>most people jibber jabber about investing and all of this stuff. And when push comes to shove,</p>
<p>they crumble like little bitches and run into mommy&rsquo;s coattails. It&rsquo;s hard to put lots of money</p>
<p>to work. And this is a guy that&rsquo;s done it. So the same person that can make 125 billion turns out is</p>
<p>the same person that can lose 30 billion. And so one thing is I would just keep in mind that this</p>
<p>is a resilient guy who seems to land on his feet. And the second thing that nobody talks about is</p>
<p>how smart Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi were in how they structured the investment into the vision</p>
<p>fund, because more than half their investment is in preferred equity, which is effectively debt</p>
<p>that pays a coupon. And you see it now where SoftBank, by the way, who has been pretty smart</p>
<p>in how they&rsquo;ve managed their Alibaba position, have been using these derivatives and forward</p>
<p>swaps to be able to sell and manage their liquidity. So it turns out that even if the</p>
<p>vision fund breaks, even Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi will have made money, because I think they</p>
<p>paid a 6% coupon on you know, $50 billion is a lot of money over 6789 years, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>SoftBank has found a way to sell down 25% of Alibaba, which is no trivial feat</p>
<p>for half a trillion dollar company. And this guy gets to keep swinging. And if he you know,</p>
<p>hits it one more time, he&rsquo;ll end up with half a trillion.</p>
<p>This chart is pretty great. sacks, if you look at this, this is the gain and loss on</p>
<p>investments at the vision fund. You can see the first vision fund racing up, then coming down,</p>
<p>I think after that summer of IPOs that we had in the Airbnb, Uber days, and then a huge peak run</p>
<p>up in 2021. And then come and crashing down. Apparently he wasn&rsquo;t selling any portion of this</p>
<p>that to me was a big lesson of like, maybe pairing some of these winners, if it sold 10 or 20% on the</p>
<p>way up, this could look like a completely different outcome. But I agree with each mafia,</p>
<p>he swung for the fences, and there was downside protection built in for the LPS into some of</p>
<p>these sacks. What are your thoughts? Any lessons here in terms of the impact on our overall</p>
<p>ecosystem or that you can take as a capital allocator yourself?</p>
<p>Well, Jason, I think masa did something you can never do, which is admit a mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go. Well, when I have my first mistake, I&rsquo;m certainly willing to admit it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting. Imagine that you ran 100 billion for sovereigns instead of 100,000 for doctors</p>
<p>and dentists. And you can kind of put yourself yourself in Moses position.</p>
<p>Oh, I love sacks in the morning, sacks in the morning.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wake sacks up early, man. That&rsquo;s a big lesson here. You make sacks go to a 9am,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s coming in like a bear. A bear has been hibernating and you poke him.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You know, look, I think that SoftBank obviously made some decisions that were,</p>
<p>you know, they were sort of peak decisions. They were a little bit bubbly. They didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take chips off the table when they probably should have. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into these</p>
<p>bubbles because the psychology of it is so powerful. And as, you know, Bill Gurley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointed out, these bull markets are more like a sawtooth, which is they gradually go up for 9,</p>
<p>10, 11, 12 years. And then when they end, they just, you know, it&rsquo;s like an elevator going down.</p>
<p>So, you know, if the market had continued for another couple of years,</p>
<p>Masa probably would have made a lot of money. But in any event, look, he took responsibility</p>
<p>for the losses. This was a very, you sort of culturally Japanese speech. I mean, he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>commit seppuku at the end, but it was kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>He was heading that direction. They might have had to move the camera off. Oh my God,</p>
<p>what is he doing with that sword?</p>
<p>It was the verbal equivalent, basically. And look, he took responsibility. What else can you do?</p>
<p>Now, one thing I would quibble about is the idea that SoftBank caused this bubble. You know,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just SoftBank. We had tons of new money. Tiger had huge funds. They were deploying</p>
<p>very quickly. But there was a lot of so-called tourist money, basically money from crossover</p>
<p>funds. Investors who are not primarily VCs came into the ecosystem over the last few years. And</p>
<p>a lot of that was driven by sovereigns and by liquidity. So, you know, you can&rsquo;t forget that</p>
<p>we had $10 trillion of liquidity pumped into the system over the last couple of years. And</p>
<p>many billions of that found its way into the tech ecosystem. And fundamentally,</p>
<p>you know, VC is not that scalable. There was an attempt to make it scalable. There&rsquo;s an attempt</p>
<p>to push more money into VC. Why isn&rsquo;t it scalable? Why isn&rsquo;t it scalable? Because people have tried,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s a craft business. I mean, what does it mean?</p>
<p>It is scalable. It&rsquo;s just that if you try to scale it, your returns will go to zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the same thing, right?</p>
<p>Like, I want to just critique the strategy for a second, because,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re talking about as if market conditions caused these massive write downs.</p>
<p>And that is the only reason that these funds have suffered. But, you know, if you read a lot of the</p>
<p>stories of Masa&rsquo;s investments in a number of these companies, and the full list is available and how</p>
<p>much he invested, there are many, many stories. And I&rsquo;ve heard many of them personally from CEOs</p>
<p>that have met with Masa and raised money from him. You go into Masa, you tell some the bigger</p>
<p>the story you tell, the more excited he gets, the more of the world you can capture.</p>
<p>You go in, you&rsquo;re raising $100 million. He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll invest 400 million.</p>
<p>You say you&rsquo;re raising 25 million. He&rsquo;s like, I want to give you 150 million.</p>
<p>And his motivation was always give you more capital so you can go capture the market.</p>
<p>And the problem in that model is that by giving you so much money,</p>
<p>capital becomes your primary asset as a business. And capital needs to be the fuel that enables</p>
<p>your assets as a business to accelerate. But as soon as capital itself becomes your primary asset,</p>
<p>business is doomed to fail. And that&rsquo;s a really key point. If you let&rsquo;s say and let me let me be</p>
<p>very specific about what I mean. Let&rsquo;s say you have a direct to consumer business that requires</p>
<p>online marketing. And your business grows well, you spend $100 to acquire a customer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone says here&rsquo;s a billion dollars to spend on acquiring customers. As soon as you</p>
<p>have to start deploying a billion dollars, your cost of acquisition goes up, the number of customers</p>
<p>per dollar spent goes down, and the business itself starts to look upside down and fail.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened with a number of these businesses that masa put in and he put oversized</p>
<p>checks in. We work is a really well documented example in terms of what happened when they</p>
<p>started to accelerate their growth beyond the natural course of the business because of the</p>
<p>amount of capital that they took. It really started to hurt the fundamental profitability</p>
<p>and unit economics of the core assets of the business. And this strategy, theoretically can</p>
<p>work to a degree, but masa took it to a level that had not been seen before. I think I highlighted</p>
<p>for you guys, like back in 2011, I think when Andreessen Horowitz, they pitched me on this idea,</p>
<p>I was trying to raise $25 million in my company, Mark was like, we&rsquo;ll give you $40 million, you</p>
<p>can accelerate your growth. And he&rsquo;s like, we want you to go capture the market. And Peter Thiel</p>
<p>always use these terms go capture the market. And these and blitz scaling, really scale again,</p>
<p>Reid Hoffman with blitz scaling. And the motivation is, look, we&rsquo;ll give you more money,</p>
<p>because the core asset of the business works the core assets of the business work. So the money</p>
<p>should be more fuel for the fire. The problem is, if you overindulge, if you put too much money in,</p>
<p>and the the asset cannot handle that much capital, the whole thing collapses. Yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many documented examples of this in his portfolio. And I think that the strategy is</p>
<p>worth highlighting that there are some issues with that strategy across all these business</p>
<p>categories. It doesn&rsquo;t always work, right? The core issue here, I think is and then I&rsquo;ll go to</p>
<p>you, Saxon, then Jamal, the core issue here that you&rsquo;re describing is exactly correct. And it</p>
<p>really is up to the founder to decide what they&rsquo;re going to do with that capital, the we work example</p>
<p>so instructive, because they were buying under market buildings in the in the tenderloin, and</p>
<p>then marking them up to, you know, class A office space and getting those prices. Once they got the</p>
<p>masa money, he started buying class A and offering kit at class B prices and flip the whole business</p>
<p>upside rate at which you can deploy capital does not flex, right. And so in all businesses,</p>
<p>understanding the rate at which you can deploy capital to grow is critical to understand how</p>
<p>much capital you can raise. And then if you raise too much money, and you and you flex beyond what</p>
<p>the natural condition of the business is, in terms of capital deployment, the economics fall apart,</p>
<p>and the business itself looks terrible. And eventually you will have a write down.</p>
<p>And the distraction on the founder is the key. I mean, look at what Adam Newman,</p>
<p>he was easily distracted. He started buying surf machines and companies and starting kindergarten</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t naturally deploy that much capital. So you find unnatural ways to deploy</p>
<p>may build on that point. I think there was a belief on the part of SoftBank that they did</p>
<p>publicly espoused, which is that they could be the kingmaker.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And in fact, you know, we had some startups that were in competitive markets and SoftBank</p>
<p>would basically announce that we&rsquo;re going to be anointing, we&rsquo;re going to be picking a winner,</p>
<p>anointing a winner, and writing them a huge check. And everyone kind of had to play along</p>
<p>because if your competitor got that 100 or $500 million check, then you would be presumably way</p>
<p>behind. So there was this belief that they could be a kingmaker and make the difference. And I think</p>
<p>that what we saw is that for whatever reason, partly because of the dynamics that Freeberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about, that that strategy just didn&rsquo;t really work that well. And what it really goes</p>
<p>down to is that VCs can be helpful, but they don&rsquo;t ultimately cause the winning companies to be the</p>
<p>winner. So this idea that you could be a kingmaker, I think was a little bit flawed. I think one way</p>
<p>that Tiger actually improved on this model was that they never tried to be a kingmaker. They</p>
<p>actually went the other direction, which is, we&rsquo;re going to own less your company. They try to be</p>
<p>passive, non-dilutive capital. And they would do high price rounds, but with reasonably sized</p>
<p>checks. But they didn&rsquo;t try to go for 25%, 30% ownership at a late stage. And founders did like</p>
<p>that model better. Now, as it turned out, they both had the market timing wrong. But I think</p>
<p>this kingmaker aspect was a problem. And one other aspect of that, I think, is that ‚Äì and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to beat up on SoftBank too much. I&rsquo;ll say something nice about them in a second. But I think</p>
<p>one of the mistakes they made is you&rsquo;d see them writing multi-hundred million dollar checks into</p>
<p>companies that were at a very, very early stage. Free product market fit.</p>
<p>Free product market. Companies, frankly, that we thought were like seed investments.</p>
<p>Brandless was the perfect example. It was a company that made like soaps and dishwashers</p>
<p>and cereal, but they had no brand on it. It was like Uniqlo of this. And they gave them,</p>
<p>I think, $200 million. And I was like, this is a seed stage company. Makes no sense.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, look, they wrote like $500 million seed checks into robotics companies effectively.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because that the SoftBank had a thesis. And I think sometimes, again,</p>
<p>this goes back to kingmaker. If you&rsquo;re a VC, and you think you&rsquo;re the one with the thesis,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s going to make the difference, it&rsquo;s actually a seductive fallacy</p>
<p>to fall into. It&rsquo;s the founder who has the thesis. And you can only do so much to help,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t really force it. And so I think they ended up making some,</p>
<p>cutting some really big checks into some companies that were really risky.</p>
<p>And the way that we do growth investing is that it&rsquo;s milestone-based. We&rsquo;re writing,</p>
<p>the size of the check is proportional to the amount of proof that the company has.</p>
<p>And look, the nice thing I&rsquo;ll say about SoftBank is recently, we&rsquo;ve actually done some SaaS deals</p>
<p>with them that I think are some really good deals. And they&rsquo;ve written checks that I think</p>
<p>are appropriate to the size of the of the company and the amount of proof they have.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been really easy to work with. And I look forward to doing more deals with them.</p>
<p>But I think it would behoove them to do more deals like that,</p>
<p>where again, check size is related to proof. I think that SoftBank, in hindsight,</p>
<p>made one critical, critical error and only one. And everything else was sort of a fait</p>
<p>accompli with that one error, which is that in their fund documents, they made this a 10 year</p>
<p>fund. Now let me explain why is that an error? That is the status quo for all these funds.</p>
<p>And the more nuanced part of that decision to make it a 10 year fund is that your investment</p>
<p>period is only five years. So you&rsquo;re only allowed to put the money in for the first five.</p>
<p>And then you have to basically manage the portfolio because there&rsquo;s an expectation</p>
<p>that you raise a new fund. So if all of a sudden you have $100 billion in a five year investing</p>
<p>life, the math says, Oh my gosh, okay, well, I need to put 20 billion out per year. And then</p>
<p>you try to look for, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s say 50 companies a year, while the mean check size now</p>
<p>all of a sudden balloons to 400 million. That was the error. You see afterwards, the very,</p>
<p>very smart private equity folks who saw that that was the error fixed it. So Blackstone,</p>
<p>Silverlake, when they came on the heels of SoftBank, what they did was they raised funds</p>
<p>with a 15 and 20 year life. And what that allows them to do, and what would it would have allowed</p>
<p>MASA to do in this situation was just slow it way, way down, pace yourself and do fewer deals</p>
<p>with much more capital, and then be patient and say, I&rsquo;m going to have a 10 year investing life.</p>
<p>And I think that that would have saved them. And they would have looked incredible right now,</p>
<p>because they would be the kingmaker in a moment where there is no money flowing into venture</p>
<p>and early stage tech. So in my opinion, I think it was just that it was such an ambitious feat,</p>
<p>that when it came time to execute, whoever was really in charge of those details,</p>
<p>kind of fucked it up. And they should have realized the math didn&rsquo;t work for a five year</p>
<p>fund life. And they should have made it a 10 year fund light or 10 year investment life,</p>
<p>which would have put a 20 year fund life on the thing. And I think they would have been fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you look at it as 60 months, maybe you take out August and like the holidays,</p>
<p>you got basically 50 months to deploy 100, 100 billion, it&rsquo;s 2 billion a month,</p>
<p>500 billion a week. I mean, how do you even process that many deals? It&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>the quality of the diligence, by necessity has to go to zero.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it was a crazy strategy. If you can breathe, you get money. If you can get a meeting,</p>
<p>you get the money. I mean, basically, I mean, and if they had just I&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s there was one</p>
<p>guy. No, and it forces you to have a team that is so broad and large and diffuse. That is not</p>
<p>this game. This is another thing I would love to, you know, for us to correct, correct. Investing</p>
<p>has never will never, and is not ever a team sport. Okay, explain it is like basketball,</p>
<p>you can be on a team, but you are Steph Curry, or you&rsquo;re not Steph Curry, you are Draymond Green,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not Draymond Green, you are LeBron James, or you&rsquo;re not. There are J.R. Smith&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>a team, there are Tristan Thompson&rsquo;s on a team, and you come together and the team can win a</p>
<p>championship. But there are these exceptional individuals. Yes. And the firms that have really</p>
<p>done well, consistently over decades, embrace that philosophy, benchmark, Sequoia, you know,</p>
<p>these guys don&rsquo;t try to create this team oriented, glad handing approach. But they also don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow the teams to get so diffused that there&rsquo;s 500 people running around ripping money in because</p>
<p>you basically then return the beta of the market. And if the market doesn&rsquo;t look good in that</p>
<p>vintage, then all of your returns look pretty crappy. The lesson for me in all of this is I</p>
<p>think we talked about riding your winners on the show that came from just so people understand when</p>
<p>we said ride your winners, and it&rsquo;s famously in the in the opening song here. What we were talking</p>
<p>about was like, don&rsquo;t sell your entire position, like when Sequoia sold their entire Apple position</p>
<p>or other people have done, but pairing your position would have changed this whole story.</p>
<p>If he had paired 10 20% of some of these names that were breaking, I disagree with that, too,</p>
<p>along the way. Oh, why? Go ahead, because I think that&rsquo;s the world. I think the opposite,</p>
<p>he would have had it up a year ago, Sequoia just put out an entire document and a roadmap for</p>
<p>becoming an evergreen fund. But and I read that. And what I thought to myself is all of this looks</p>
<p>incredible unless the market goes down. And then and then the market went way, way down. Why?</p>
<p>Because their whole thesis is we&rsquo;re going to park and hold money. Well, okay. But they also allowed</p>
<p>a revolving liquidity mechanism for their LPs. Every year, you know, you&rsquo;re a cancer foundation,</p>
<p>and you want to fund cancer research, and you expect Sequoia to give you back money,</p>
<p>you fill out a form. And Sequoia basically fronts you the money. Well, excuse me, but you can see</p>
<p>how all of a sudden, this can very quickly get out of control. Because then where does Sequoia get</p>
<p>that money, they&rsquo;ll have to borrow it or liquidate some positions. But the whole point is to not</p>
<p>liquidate positions. This is what they said. Yeah. So my point is, I really think and David said this</p>
<p>before, I think a VC&rsquo;s job is to be a VC, it&rsquo;s hard enough to do that job well. And if you think</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to cascade across all asset classes and do better than the market, it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>extremely high bar that creates tremendous pressure and forces you to bring things on like debt,</p>
<p>and all of these leverage lines, which when markets go up will work in your favor,</p>
<p>but can very quickly turn against you. I disagree completely. Because when if you look at when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a private company, and you&rsquo;re you own some private shares, you know, the revenue,</p>
<p>you know, the velocity, you know, the management team, you have more insights than everybody,</p>
<p>you got a massive information edge, because it&rsquo;s all based on insider information before it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>public. And pairing your positions in privates can be amazing, because you have some overvalued</p>
<p>company because someone like Masa or tiger comes along and overvalues it. So for venture funds,</p>
<p>I think when you start hitting these 50 100 x is pairing 10% pairing 20% along the way,</p>
<p>which masa could have done in these private names, especially would have been brilliant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t distribute and just hold on and use data and give people give your LPS of</p>
<p>all liquidity. No, no, no. I&rsquo;m saying if you have the opportunity to sell in secondary,</p>
<p>you should pair your position in your winners. Times. I&rsquo;m not saying that this would be a</p>
<p>different position. But like you&rsquo;re using soft, you&rsquo;re using Apple and Sequoia. As an example,</p>
<p>you do remember the trajectory of Apple basically went to a $4 billion market cap</p>
<p>for years languishing. I mean, the idea that Sequoia would have held those shares because</p>
<p>they had some proprietary views ludicrous. Why is it ludicrous? What if they just had a</p>
<p>company was on death&rsquo;s doorstep, you can see the YouTube videos when Steve Jobs came back,</p>
<p>he said, we may not make it. Yes, but Chamath that in that is part of the opportunity. But</p>
<p>putting that aside, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s the quiz doing is they&rsquo;re saying we want to hold</p>
<p>the legendary companies, the legendary brands with the great founders for easy in hindsight,</p>
<p>how do you do it today? Well, is is unity a legendary company? Or should you have distributed</p>
<p>at $165 a share? Well, I&rsquo;m an extremely hard question. And I&rsquo;m saying you can mitigate that</p>
<p>question by pairing your position 10 20%. So you have the best of both worlds. So what do you</p>
<p>think? Well, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard to pair down a position while the company&rsquo;s still private,</p>
<p>because the companies don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t want you to by and large. But but once they do become public,</p>
<p>then the question is when you distribute and we talked about this, I think it sounds like softening</p>
<p>was sitting on quite a few large public positions, and could have distributed I&rsquo;m not fully familiar</p>
<p>with their structure. But given that they had all this debt, seems like you&rsquo;d want to pay off</p>
<p>all the debt as soon as you could. And missing the chance to do that preferred coupon, they had</p>
<p>to pay pif and an idea every year, I think it&rsquo;s like three or $4 billion. It&rsquo;s well, it&rsquo;s documented,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the 6% that they that they were owed on their $50 billion.</p>
<p>But do they pay it off? Well, you have to pay it every year.</p>
<p>Yeah. So they did it. I mean, look, I would just say these bubble, it&rsquo;s easy,</p>
<p>you know, hindsight is 2020. It&rsquo;s really easy to point out these mistakes after the market&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cratered. You know, my experience with these bubbles, whether you go back to 1999, or 2021,</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re in them, they&rsquo;re very powerful psychologically, you know, everyone&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about how everything&rsquo;s going up. And we, I think, actually had some really good commentary on the</p>
<p>show about back in November about how it could be the peak, how it could be all liquidity fueled.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know for sure. But there were some pretty good predictions on the spot.</p>
<p>But by and large, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to know whether you&rsquo;re, you know, whether</p>
<p>there are grounding metric that you use, I&rsquo;ll open up to freeberg, and then everybody else,</p>
<p>when to know that the market is overheated to freeberg, is there something you look at and go,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;ve disconnected from reality price, the earnings price, the sales,</p>
<p>some valuation metrics are the things you look for. So you know that this is overheated. And</p>
<p>maybe it is time to pair positions. What would have you learned over now, our third collective</p>
<p>down market valuation trophy hunting, I would say is a pretty good indicator of things being</p>
<p>things being explained what that is in a heated market, like if the</p>
<p>the businesses, the CEO, the founder, the venture firms, everyone is all about how</p>
<p>much you can mark up your investment, as opposed to talking about the quality of the business and</p>
<p>the quality of the earnings. And then you revert back, as we just recently did to now people talking</p>
<p>about, okay, how strong are the gross margins of this business? How effectively can they deploy</p>
<p>capital? What&rsquo;s the return on invested capital, key metrics around the fundamentals of the business</p>
<p>versus the value that the market is willing to pay for the business. And the more heated the</p>
<p>market gets, the more everyone focuses on terms like unicorn deca corn, you know, and that becomes</p>
<p>the key metric as opposed to saying this business is so good. For every dollar they spend, they make</p>
<p>$3 in gross profit in 12 months. That&rsquo;s what fundamentally says that&rsquo;s a high quality growth,</p>
<p>you know, valuable business over time, as opposed to here&rsquo;s what the market is telling me it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>today. And if the market is telling you it&rsquo;s worth that much today, and you&rsquo;re and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you focus on, you inevitably end up in these kind of bubbly moments where you miss out on</p>
<p>focusing on core value creation, which will actually pay off much, much more over time.</p>
<p>Matthew pointed out another signal. Hey, when smart people who have the largest amount of</p>
<p>capital in the markets are clearing positions, maybe that&rsquo;s a signal of a top. And then I think</p>
<p>is a really good insight by free bird when the conversation, the narrative is about the valuation</p>
<p>and the status and vanity metrics, as opposed to the quality of the earnings. Hey, that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good indicator, we&rsquo;re in a bubble, maybe you should start clearing positions. What are indications for</p>
<p>you that we&rsquo;re either in a bubble, or the market is undervalued? Because we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>this timing, right timing is very important. It&rsquo;s not possible. This is why I think that</p>
<p>you have to define what game you want to play before you start playing the game. Okay.</p>
<p>This is why I think it&rsquo;s kind of nonsensical. For example, I believe that at best, I am an equity</p>
<p>investor in technology companies, or things that have a technology bias, because I can generally</p>
<p>understand them, maybe, you know, a few seconds faster than everybody else, which allows me to</p>
<p>make a decision a little bit quicker. But if all of a sudden, I started investing in debt,</p>
<p>you should expect that I&rsquo;ll lose my money. Because I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. And that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>game where I have any advantage. So I think the most important thing to do is to not try to do</p>
<p>all of this crazy stuff. Because this is what happens in moments where either things are very,</p>
<p>very good, or things are very, very bad. People try to create all these stupid rules.</p>
<p>And the rule, their only rule is there are no rules. So I don&rsquo;t know, I just think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>stick to your knitting. If you&rsquo;re a product builder, build products. If you&rsquo;re an early</p>
<p>stage investor, just do that. It&rsquo;s hard enough to do any one of those things really, really,</p>
<p>really well. But this idea that you know, you&rsquo;re going to come up with like some mosaic in a system,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just highly suspect. And I think the market returns have showed that everybody</p>
<p>that tries has failed except for maybe one or two facts. I mean, it&rsquo;s not going to work. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the point? So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re an early stage investor, make good deals and then give</p>
<p>the shares and book the win. That&rsquo;s what I do. Yeah, that&rsquo;s my philosophy. facts. What are your</p>
<p>thoughts? There&rsquo;s a couple of metrics that I&rsquo;ll be looking at from now on that I wasn&rsquo;t paying</p>
<p>a huge amount of attention to before. One is the price to ARR of the median public SaaS company.</p>
<p>And so like Brad Gerstner has these great charts where you saw that historically, that number was</p>
<p>around six, you know, the median SaaS company was trading at about six times their next 12 months</p>
<p>revenue. And it went all the way to 15 during this sort of COVID bubble in 2021. And for the</p>
<p>high growth SaaS companies, which are the ones growing 40%, 20%, it went from, you know, like</p>
<p>eight to 35. So, so I&rsquo;ll definitely be looking at that. And you know, what you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>is just how off the historical mean, are we positively or negatively, because these public</p>
<p>valuations are the exit comps for, you know, the private markets, and those valuations do</p>
<p>eventually trickle down. And so if there is a bubble in the public markets, it will trickle</p>
<p>down to the private market. So that would be like one metric. I mean, again, it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that like affects me daily, but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d want to periodically keep tabs on. The other</p>
<p>is just interest rate policy. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never spent so much time in my entire career,</p>
<p>like looking at inflation interest rates that I have this year, because who knew how much</p>
<p>this stuff was affecting us, I thought I was a micro investor, I thought I was just picking</p>
<p>companies on a micro level, as it turns out, we were all massively impacted by macroeconomic policy.</p>
<p>And, you know, it got so we didn&rsquo;t even notice it, the zero, the zero interest rate policy,</p>
<p>the ZURP, along with the quantitative easing, these are supposed to be exceptional measures</p>
<p>that started back in 2008. But we stopped noticing them, they continued for years and years and</p>
<p>years. They continued until last year. And we again, we just stopped noticing because we got</p>
<p>used to it, we kind of got hooked on hooked on drugs. So the market did. So I&rsquo;m just gonna have</p>
<p>to pay a little bit more attention to what the Fed is doing now. And, you know, if you go all</p>
<p>the way back to the dot com bubble, what&rsquo;s interesting is that the Fed fund rate back in</p>
<p>1999 wasn&rsquo;t low, it was like 4%. It wasn&rsquo;t like it was even today. And we still had a bubble. But</p>
<p>what popped the bubble was that interest rates went from four to 6%. And from 1999 to 2000,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what popped the bubble. So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever have a situation again,</p>
<p>like we had over the last few years with the ZURP. But I mean, that probably looking for that</p>
<p>next time is fighting the last battle instead of the next one. But you do probably have to</p>
<p>be a little bit more aware of monetary policy and what the Fed is doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, this chart, Exhibit 6 from the Vision Fund benchmarking against peer funds that Chamath just</p>
<p>put into the group chat is absolutely spectacular. It puts Sequoia Insight and SoftBank, you know,</p>
<p>large, large funds against each other fund size 100 billion for SoftBank, 8 billion for Sequoia,</p>
<p>6.3 billion for Insight. And to Chamath&rsquo;s point earlier, the pace is really crazy.</p>
<p>130 deals per month, but then the average check size is 620 million versus 130 and 70.</p>
<p>And the deals per month 3.5 versus point six versus 4.2. So it&rsquo;s like going pretty</p>
<p>fast with small checks. SoftBank going very fast with huge checks.</p>
<p>Is really, you know, Sequoia has the benefit of being able to back test against 40 years of</p>
<p>returns. And so if essentially what they&rsquo;re saying is there&rsquo;s really no more than five or six</p>
<p>companies a year that are worth investing in, that&rsquo;s a really big signal that&rsquo;s worth thinking</p>
<p>about. And so, you know, five or six companies, maybe they can absorb even $600 million each,</p>
<p>you know, it still puts you at three and a half, $4 billion. Doesn&rsquo;t put you at 20,</p>
<p>which is what you need to put 100 into the ground. 2 billion a month. I mean,</p>
<p>my Lord, it&rsquo;s like Brewster&rsquo;s millions or something. It&rsquo;s like some crazy premise.</p>
<p>I think in fairness to SoftBank, again, you know, these are the same guys that invested in Yahoo.</p>
<p>They invested in all of these, you know, dot com companies and brought them into Japan,</p>
<p>including great businesses like Cisco. You know, these guys have been big time serial winners.</p>
<p>I think the tactical mistake was not having a 10 year investment life.</p>
<p>I mean, and we could be sitting here next year, Alibaba could double in value,</p>
<p>a couple of their other positions could recover 50%. Okay, but we could be sitting there and</p>
<p>they could be they could have closed the gap massively. Anything&rsquo;s possible. I think actually</p>
<p>a good jump off point here. Great discussion, gentlemen. Do we want to talk about the markets</p>
<p>and we got the inflation print sacks. I guess depending on what political party you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either 8.5% or 00% month over month. If you&rsquo;re a democrat, if you&rsquo;re a republican,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 8.5% in our polarized times. But what does this tell us sacks just at least about maybe</p>
<p>inflation is tipped over and we&rsquo;re going to be flat for a little bit that obviously caused the</p>
<p>market to rip a little bit and we had this incredible jobs report. We&rsquo;re now at 3.5%</p>
<p>unemployment. As we predicted, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty extraordinary what happened in the last 30 days to</p>
<p>the to these prints. Yeah, look, I think that overall, the economic data is mixed. But we got</p>
<p>a couple of good data points in the last month. So inflation did decrease from 9.1 to 8.5%.</p>
<p>Inflation was until now measured on a year over year basis, not a month over month basis. But</p>
<p>since we got the first good month over month reading, all of a sudden now, it&rsquo;s been redefined</p>
<p>to be on a month over month basis. Just this is the same thing that happened with the definition</p>
<p>of recession, where recession used to mean two quarters of negative GDP growth. Of course,</p>
<p>that happened. And so all of a sudden, the definition became unknowable, we have to defer</p>
<p>to this, this economic board that won&rsquo;t render a decision until next year. By the way, if that</p>
<p>were true, how can we ever contemporaneously talk about a recession? You know, if you had to wait</p>
<p>until this economics board declares recession a year from now, the press could never have ever</p>
<p>reported for one recession. Yeah, I&rsquo;m shocked politics, politics, politics of this are obvious,</p>
<p>which is to keep redefining terms rather than admit that there&rsquo;s any bad data at all.</p>
<p>Now, look, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think the data is catastrophic. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s in anyone&rsquo;s interest to catastrophize the data. But there&rsquo;s a lot of negative data out</p>
<p>here. I mean, look, inflation is still very high, eight and a half percent. If you had told any of</p>
<p>us that in August, that inflation would still be a half, eight and a half percent the beginning of</p>
<p>this year, we would have said that is horrible. Because remember, the investment banks are all</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s gonna come down to 3% by the end of the year. So inflation is still high, the jobs</p>
<p>picture is good. We&rsquo;re technically in a recession. If I were to predict, I think what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>now, I think, you know, look for a double dip, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all, if in Q3 or Q4,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back to positive GDP growth. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re actually out of the woods, because</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that next year, these these rate hikes really kick in,</p>
<p>it takes six to nine months for them to ripple through the economy. So if you look at the</p>
<p>construction industry, the construction industry has been devastated new housing starts, you talk</p>
<p>to the builders, they tell you that the construction industry has been clobbered by these rate hikes,</p>
<p>the inventories are piling up, and the affordability of there&rsquo;s a chart today about</p>
<p>the affordability of home prices at a 40 year low. And so the construction industry, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the bellwether when a recession starts, they&rsquo;re the ones who are first impacted, but it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>going to take six, nine months, because the loans are so expensive. And cost of capital is expensive,</p>
<p>right? So projects. So look, I if I take, I think we&rsquo;re in a shallow, technical recession right now,</p>
<p>I bet that we probably bounce out of it in Q3 or Q4. But I think there&rsquo;s a significant risk that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back in. We&rsquo;re back in it next year, just my guess,</p>
<p>a free break, we&rsquo;ve been talking about consumer credit, a whole bunch by now pay later,</p>
<p>household debt now totals more than 16 trillion credit card balances make up 890 billion of that</p>
<p>obviously, student loans, mortgages, other things are in there. And the number of credit cards is</p>
<p>now at a massive high 550 million of them issued here in the United States, we added a massive</p>
<p>amount of debt, it&rsquo;s still lower, the credit card debt, just to be clear, is still lower than the</p>
<p>pre pandemic level of 930 billion. But consumers seem to be taking out credit,</p>
<p>I guess to deal with inflation or to enjoy their lives, because they&rsquo;re not stopping their spending.</p>
<p>And we see that in some of the stocks and the earnings reports that are coming out as well. So</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your take on this? You know, conflicting data we have? Or is or have you made</p>
<p>some sense of it? And what is your prediction of q4? Sorry, are you asking what my take is on the</p>
<p>consumer credit? Well, basically, the overall macro situation here, we&rsquo;ve got consumer credit,</p>
<p>you know, people taking on a lot of debt, while jobs look great, while inflation is still high.</p>
<p>What does that look like? You know, as we go into q4? And next year? What is this telling you? Is</p>
<p>there some signaling you can take from this? sack said shallow recession thinks we might double dip,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of getting to your prediction of q4. I mean, this is a little repetitive. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this, I first said it in May at the all in summit, and I said it again on the show twice.</p>
<p>Great, which is I think that the definition of a recession of negative GDP growth, when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming off of inflated GDP is, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not a binary catch all term. I mean, the fact</p>
<p>is, we had inflated assets. And as a result of inflated assets, we had inflated earnings, and we</p>
<p>had inflated valuation, and we inflated income. And, you know, now, the capital is coming out,</p>
<p>and things are going to go down inevitably. But I don&rsquo;t think that this should be deemed that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fundamentally negative about the US economy. The biggest risk I still see</p>
<p>is this rising consumer credit balance, particularly in a rising rate environment.</p>
<p>People are taking on more debt. If you look at the New York Fed here, I&rsquo;ll just give you the latest.</p>
<p>This is the household debt and credit report they put out household debt rises to</p>
<p>$16 trillion amid growth in housing and non housing balances. And so there are variable</p>
<p>rate loans in there in the auto home and credit card markets. Those variable rates mean that as</p>
<p>interest rates climb, the amount to service existing debt will go up each month. And the</p>
<p>amount of debt that&rsquo;s being taken on is also going up each month. And so the key economic question</p>
<p>is, does the income gain that&rsquo;s being experienced or the asset value gain that&rsquo;s being experienced,</p>
<p>outpace the increase in monthly debt service needed for a large number of consumers? Student</p>
<p>loans are also in here, by the way. And so when you put that all together, it&rsquo;s a very technical</p>
<p>question, which is technically where do you start to see defaults rise. And when you have defaults</p>
<p>rise, then the money that&rsquo;s owed and the services that are the service payments that are owed on</p>
<p>that debt, trickles through the economy, because bonds start to default, equity start to decline,</p>
<p>and so on. So, you know, I this is why I can speak at a high level, from a macro point of view,</p>
<p>that the rate at which debt is going up and consumer credit is going up, and the rate at</p>
<p>which rates are climbing that affect the revolving and variable rate debt that consumers hold,</p>
<p>could outpace the income and the asset value gain, particularly when equities are down 401ks are down,</p>
<p>house housing prices are down. And so there&rsquo;s a tipping point. And when that starts to happen,</p>
<p>then you start to really hit an economic crunch. And I&rsquo;ve mentioned this multiple times now that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the thing, you know, I would kind of watch most closely, while there are core elements of</p>
<p>the current economy that looks strong. There are real concerns around whether consumers can keep</p>
<p>up with their debt payments in the month or two quarters ahead. Yeah.</p>
<p>Chamath, are you following this consumer credit surge? And do you think that this could be a</p>
<p>black swan type event? This could be, you know,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right here in front of us. So, you know, okay. Yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>I would say like a massive contagion where there&rsquo;s massive number of defaults creating a black swan</p>
<p>contagion like event, but yes, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s maybe hidden in plain sight. What do</p>
<p>you think Chamath is this important data, or impacting your view on things?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s part of a mosaic. And I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>Look, what are we trying to get from this discussion? I don&rsquo;t understand, like,</p>
<p>like, are we trying to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen? I mean,</p>
<p>I think David basically said it best, like, if you actually just take a step back and stop</p>
<p>overlaying what we want to happen, look, the reality is all four of us want things to go up.</p>
<p>And we like it when there&rsquo;s money in the system, and everything&rsquo;s flush.</p>
<p>But if we had said last year that we would open an envelope, and, you know, we would show these</p>
<p>inflation prints, we would be shocked. And we would have been scared. And quite honestly, you</p>
<p>know, in the process in November, when I started selling, I would have sold even more violently</p>
<p>than I sold. And all I can say is I saved my ass in November of last year, looking at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened in the last six, eight months. So I don&rsquo;t know, I just think that if you look at the CPI</p>
<p>print, and you look at the components, we were saved, because energy basically fell off a cliff.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, a bunch of people decided not to travel. And, you know, we didn&rsquo;t import as</p>
<p>much oil, and we were able to keep costs contained. And that kept CPI from being really out of</p>
<p>control. But again, we&rsquo;re in the summer where we don&rsquo;t have the pressure on energy that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have in October, November this year. So I really don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I just think that</p>
<p>there is like, Freeberg has his pet issue, I have my pet issue, Sachs has his pet issue,</p>
<p>you ask 100 economists, they&rsquo;ll have their own pet issue, housing, affordability, whatever it is.</p>
<p>The point is, we have 100 whack a mole problems. And the question is, which mousetrap sets off the</p>
<p>rest of the mousetraps? I have no idea. And so, you know, I just think that right now,</p>
<p>things are a little bit too calm. And that makes me feel very unsettled.</p>
<p>Another shoe might drop. I mean, the point of the conversation is to try to understand and</p>
<p>make better decisions in capital allocation, company formation, and placing bets in the</p>
<p>next year. So I think that&rsquo;s the point of the discussion.</p>
<p>We now have the spectacle of the President saying he&rsquo;s going to pass an inflation reduction act</p>
<p>to solve a 0% inflation problem to get us out of a recession that he says doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>You guys know this, but the politics and the political commentary on this are absurd.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re describing here is simply more honest,</p>
<p>which is to say that the data is mixed, and we don&rsquo;t exactly know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, the thing that I think is encouraging is when you look at this jobs data,</p>
<p>and you look at the debt that consumers are putting on, my theory is, and I could be wrong,</p>
<p>that people want to keep spending, they want to keep living their lives,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking on a little bit of debt to deal with inflation and to keep spending,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also going back to work. And I&rsquo;m seeing that anecdotally, a lot more people</p>
<p>going back to work and the numbers show that that feels to me and I said this on previous episodes,</p>
<p>that that feels like a possible, you know, very helpful path out here. And I think you brought it</p>
<p>up sacks as well, which is, hey, if we have increased participation, that&rsquo;s great increases</p>
<p>monetary velocity increases participation in the economy, that&rsquo;s a possible path out, do you feel</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s still holding strong secular decline on that trend for 25 years. So maybe maybe on the</p>
<p>margins, a few folks run out of stimulus and decide to go and get a job. But I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, when you&rsquo;re at your when you&rsquo;re at the blackjack table in</p>
<p>Vegas, and clapping as a strategy, I feel like all the like, what we&rsquo;re talking about right now is</p>
<p>clapping as a strategy. Maybe this can happen, maybe that can, you know, maybe it&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>raining gold fucking coins that we can use. And just worry about me.</p>
<p>I feel like the last 15 minutes have been like, not a good conversation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great conversation.</p>
<p>Jake out, because look, the structure of the problem, I think is very well</p>
<p>defined, which is we have an inflation problem. Great. It went down from 9.1 8.5%. It&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>really high. Two to 3% would be would be normal. Okay. So that&rsquo;s half the problem is how fast is</p>
<p>inflation going to go back down to normal based on interest rate cuts. The other side of the problem</p>
<p>is increases is sorry, interest rate increases, not cuts. The other side of the problem is how</p>
<p>much will the economy be hurt by these rising rates. And those are the two variables. And we</p>
<p>see that there is a slowdown. There&rsquo;s still a lot of jobs being filled, which is good. But there is</p>
<p>unquestionably an economic slowdown. And those are the two sides of this equation. And we just need</p>
<p>to see some economic data. It&rsquo;s gonna play out over the next several months.</p>
<p>Asking the same question for three fucking weeks.</p>
<p>If you guys don&rsquo;t want to talk about the new data, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>None of us care. None of us. We don&rsquo;t have an opinion other than we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How many ways can we say I don&rsquo;t want to talk about inflation or recession or jobs or any of</p>
<p>that shit anymore, unless there&rsquo;s something really for us all to say, like something news come out.</p>
<p>Well, some fucking economic report was really important. I mean, that was a that was a massive</p>
<p>print, but it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s Oh, yeah, it is twice as many jobs track of what we&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>said a point. It&rsquo;s one day. It&rsquo;s on the track. There were some bad jobs reports before that</p>
<p>print. Yeah, we should stop doing the recession inflation chat every week. It honestly is like</p>
<p>repetitive better job moderating. Can you not dial it in? You got no you guys asked to talk</p>
<p>about it. You guys put some of these things on the dot. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it anymore.</p>
<p>I think we should let&rsquo;s move on. What do you what do you want? I think SoftBank was a great chat.</p>
<p>I think you know, that was a good talk. We should do that kind of shit. We should talk about what</p>
<p>you guys think about the Sequoia evergreen fund. Tell me what you guys think about that. Come on,</p>
<p>geniuses. The Sequoia like when they restructured. Are you joking?</p>
<p>I love I love when these two go silent.</p>
<p>No, I always didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt anybody. I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why you guys are trying so hard to avoid the the obvious news of this week.</p>
<p>Is there something else in the news this week? Saks? Um, if Trump actually had some material</p>
<p>in Mar-a-Lago, that was related to the nuclear program. And, you know, there was an attempt to</p>
<p>try and get recover those documents through normal means. And they were not recoverable.</p>
<p>What would your course have been if you were the director of the FBI or the President of the US</p>
<p>in that condition? Because I think that seems to be the party line of what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Well, you know, the democratic kind of spin on what&rsquo;s going on here, but like, you know,</p>
<p>honestly, in that circumstance, what do you think would have been appropriate? So there&rsquo;s some sort</p>
<p>of confidential material related to our nuclear program, or nuclear weapons, something&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>there in those materials that were attempted to be recovered, or were taken without approval,</p>
<p>and then they try to recover it. For, you know, assume there&rsquo;s no nefarious intent,</p>
<p>what would be the right kind of course here? Well, so I don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I just think that you can&rsquo;t necessarily give the F sadly, I don&rsquo;t think you can necessarily give</p>
<p>the FBI the benefit of the doubt here in light of their history. But let&rsquo;s back up. I mean,</p>
<p>first, you had this this raid on Mar-a-Lago, where you got 30 FBI agents, they&rsquo;re not wearing</p>
<p>suits with holstered sidearms, they&rsquo;re carrying AR-15s, you know, weapons of war, fingers just</p>
<p>outside the trigger guard, they&rsquo;re wearing body armor, it looks like a paramilitary</p>
<p>raid on Mar-a-Lago, it&rsquo;s utterly unprecedented. And you look at tweets by Andrew Cuomo, for example,</p>
<p>or Andrew Yang, I mean, these guys actually turned out to be pretty, I think, intellectually honest</p>
<p>Democrats on this point saying, this is unprecedented. And it&rsquo;s really gonna, I want</p>
<p>to read this by Andrew Yang. Why don&rsquo;t you answer Freeberg&rsquo;s question? I&rsquo;m getting there. I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to cut me off. So I&rsquo;d like to just read these tweets. So maybe you&rsquo;ll because you</p>
<p>know, maybe you&rsquo;ll give more credence to Andrew Yang. He said, I&rsquo;m no Trump fan. I want him as</p>
<p>far away from the White House as possible. But a fundamental part of his appeal has been that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>him against a corrupt government establishment. This race strengthens that case. For millions</p>
<p>of Americans will see this as unjust persecution. You have Andrew Cuomo saying, DOJ must immediately</p>
<p>explain the reason for its raid. It must be more than a search for inconsequential archives or be</p>
<p>viewed as a political tactic and undermine any future credible investigation and legitimacy</p>
<p>of January 6 investigations. And let me read one other tweet by Elon that&rsquo;s not directly about this</p>
<p>but he tweeted this on July 11, so a month ago. And he said, I don&rsquo;t hate the man, but it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for Trump to hang up his hat and seal at the sunset. That was the part that was widely reported.</p>
<p>But he also said, Dems should also call off the attack. Don&rsquo;t make it so that Trump&rsquo;s only way</p>
<p>to survive is to regain the presidency. I think there was a lot of wisdom in that. And you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when the case for Biden getting elected is we have to move past</p>
<p>this partisan warfare, this extreme rancor and derangement. And we were told that the media,</p>
<p>all these people who had TDS, that their psychosis was due to Trump. And if we could</p>
<p>just move past Trump, all this sort of partisan warfare would end. And I was certainly hoping</p>
<p>that would be true. And now sadly, it seems like we&rsquo;re right back in this thing, where we&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>back with the media being obsessed with TDS, portraying this narrative that somehow he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>traitor. And what does this whole thing hang on? Just these two words, nuclear documents. Well,</p>
<p>listen, until they actually produce those documents, I&rsquo;m going to suspend judgment,</p>
<p>because the FBI, the last time they did this, remember, they manufactured a falsified</p>
<p>warrant to the FISA court for this type of investigation. They have that history. So I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to suspend judgment on what&rsquo;s going on here until they actually produce the documents</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about. Because right now this stinks. Do you honestly question the integrity</p>
<p>of leadership and agents of the FBI? Are you serious? Like, you don&rsquo;t think? Yeah. All right,</p>
<p>let me read you this tweet from Michael Burry. I don&rsquo;t want to hear the tweet. I want to hear</p>
<p>your point. Well, I agree with what Michael Burry is saying. So I think sometimes there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>thoughtful commentary about this. And what Burry says is J. Edgar Hoover led the FBI for five</p>
<p>decades, denied the mafia existed, fought the civil rights movement, shielded the KKK, multiple</p>
<p>presidents acknowledged fear of him. So what he&rsquo;s saying is that the FBI, since its inception,</p>
<p>has political origins, and basically meddled politically in the affairs of the country.</p>
<p>Then he says, the FBI lied to the FISA court. This is back in 2016. Totally true. Altered emails,</p>
<p>leaked lies to the press to get Trump. Nothing shocking. So, Freeberg, listen, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whether the FBI is telling the truth, but are you honestly going to say that the FBI&rsquo;s leadership</p>
<p>has never been political, that it&rsquo;s never harbored or pursued their own agenda, and that it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>had a desire to go after Trump? I&rsquo;m not making an opinion.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. We saw the text messages from Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe. I mean,</p>
<p>these guys basically took it upon themselves when Trump was elected to be the quote unquote</p>
<p>insurance policy. And an FBI lawyer pled guilty to falsifying documents to seek a warrant from</p>
<p>the FISA court. So I just think anything&rsquo;s possible here. And now, I&rsquo;m not saying the</p>
<p>FBI is lying about this. I don&rsquo;t know. But the idea that the FBI is automatically entitled</p>
<p>to the benefit of the doubt, in light of their proven history of basically pursuing Trump like</p>
<p>Ahab pursued the white whale. I mean, these guys have been after him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to zoom out for a second. The reason I&rsquo;m interrogating</p>
<p>Sachs on this is like, it&rsquo;s just so telling to me that a guy like you, Sachs, in your position</p>
<p>are actually questioning the integrity of like the highest justice, authority and institution</p>
<p>in the United States really says a lot about kind of the state of the US citizenry, the state of</p>
<p>our society today. I think it speaks a lot to&hellip; It&rsquo;s at least a third of Americans.</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s incredible. And what Ray Dalio said in his book about how during these periods when</p>
<p>the empires begin their decline, and you know, when you&rsquo;re challenged with kind of the economic</p>
<p>conditions that the US is challenged by printing lots of money, lots of debt, very hard to service</p>
<p>all that debt. And we have a ton of obligations over the next decade or two, that are going to</p>
<p>be very hard to meet given our economic growth and inflation conditions right now, that you start to</p>
<p>see these sorts of behaviors. Historically, it&rsquo;s happened six times in the last 500 years,</p>
<p>where large empires like the United States are large, you know, economic powerhouses,</p>
<p>like the United States start to decline, that the civil war begins that the institutions get</p>
<p>challenged by a minority and then a majority of the citizenry. And it really starts to crumble</p>
<p>and challenge the the integrity of the institution, its ability to hold itself together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, hold on a second. I&rsquo;m not challenging, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re questioning the integrity. You&rsquo;re questioning the integrity of the Department of</p>
<p>Justice, right? By the way, I&rsquo;m not arguing, I&rsquo;m just pointing out, like, it&rsquo;s an incredible</p>
<p>condition for us to find ourselves in. Yeah, but my questioning did not create</p>
<p>that condition. This lack of trust is earned. It&rsquo;s earned by the FBI in light of behaviors they took</p>
<p>just a few years ago. Now, listen, I&rsquo;m not defending Trump per se. I don&rsquo;t know what he did</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t do, okay? But I think that you can&rsquo;t just accept at face value without further proof</p>
<p>these leaked, what are basically leaked comments by the FBI. I mean, look, I&rsquo;m not, listen, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>a naive child. I mean, the fact of the matter is that power can be corrupt, and power corrupts,</p>
<p>okay? And we have seen that the FBI from its earliest days did engage in corruption,</p>
<p>and more recently, against Trump himself, had a vendetta against Trump. So, hold on,</p>
<p>so all I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m not going to automatically accept at face value what they&rsquo;re saying until I</p>
<p>see some proof. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that they&rsquo;re wrong or they&rsquo;re lying about this. I&rsquo;m simply</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m not going to accept it at face value. Yeah, and remember, Trump was elected on the</p>
<p>platform that there is this deep state, that there is institutional corruption, that there is</p>
<p>malaise and lethargy in these institutions of the government that are funded on the order of</p>
<p>trillions of dollars a year, and that that&rsquo;s what he was intended to, you know, to go and</p>
<p>and blow up and repair. And there&rsquo;s a very strong and potentially close to majority percentage of</p>
<p>voting Americans that feel that there is this core deep state corruption, institutional lethargy,</p>
<p>that is challenging our ability to give everyone the freedom and liberties that they deserve.</p>
<p>These agencies are supposed to be nonpartisan. They&rsquo;re not supposed to have a horse in the race.</p>
<p>And what we saw is that when Trump was in office and these texts came out, clearly,</p>
<p>the top levels of the FBI, these top agents, I&rsquo;m not talking about the rank and file,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the field agents. I understand that a lot of them are law and</p>
<p>order types who vote Republican, I get it. But I&rsquo;m talking about the leadership,</p>
<p>the highly political leadership in Washington. And it was pretty clear that they had a horse</p>
<p>in the race. They did not like Trump, and they were out to get Trump.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, Trump is not my preferred candidate for 2024. But what the FBI has done</p>
<p>with this raid, quite frankly, I think has polarized the outcomes. They are basically</p>
<p>going to send Trump to the big house or the White House. I mean, because now the Republicans have</p>
<p>rallied around Trump, I think he&rsquo;s gonna be very, very hard to beat for as the nominee in 2024,</p>
<p>unless the FBI comes up with ironclad evidence to show that he did something significantly wrong.</p>
<p>I care less about who did what and what was done wrong. I care more about the fact that this</p>
<p>conflict is escalating, and it&rsquo;s creating a real condition of continuing polarization. And it</p>
<p>really is the conditioning that, you know, Biden had some historians in the White House, there was</p>
<p>a report on this last week. And these historians spoke about how the conditions in the United</p>
<p>States are just as they were right before the Civil War. And, and that there&rsquo;s real concern</p>
<p>that, yeah, well, I mean, you know, they can go read the the anecdotal reporting that was done</p>
<p>on this thing. But that was the general theme of the conversation. And, you know, it really it</p>
<p>really kind of concerns me more that this level of discourse is escalating to a point of, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s corruption, this person is a criminal, and that sort of discussion happens, you know,</p>
<p>in more dire circumstances and more in economic circumstances than has ever been seen, you know,</p>
<p>the US is the largest economy in history. And we&rsquo;re now having these sorts of conversations</p>
<p>that typically lead to some degree of conflict. And it&rsquo;s really concerning.</p>
<p>Well, I just think, listen, I think that Trump was out of office, we were told that this partisan</p>
<p>rancor would stop once he was out. And it&rsquo;s, you know, they&rsquo;re pulling him back in. And all I can</p>
<p>say is that when the I think we know maybe 1% of the story, okay, I think this leak around nuclear</p>
<p>documents is, it feels like a selective leak. It&rsquo;s not certainly all sides are inflammatory.</p>
<p>All sides are cantankerous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m suspending judgment. What I&rsquo;m saying is, though, that when all the information comes out,</p>
<p>there better be a very significant there there.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we&rsquo;ve made that impossible to because he Trump came out, and he basically said,</p>
<p>Hey, listen, if you if these guys find something, it was planted. And now you&rsquo;re going to have at</p>
<p>least a, you know, 10 or 15% of the population that believes, okay, this was planted, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually there. And, you know, so whatever the outcome is, will not be good. Nobody will be</p>
<p>satisfied. And both both of the extremes in the United States will be even more angry,</p>
<p>further inflamed. Yeah,</p>
<p>further. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. The inflammatory index has now has now skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Yeah, by the way, this is why I think at some level, maybe the lack of faith in these institutions</p>
<p>is well deserved. Because where is the, the, you know, the, the prudence of all of this,</p>
<p>like, where is the, the circumspect, thoughtful, methodical thinking about all of the different</p>
<p>outcomes that could be possible, so that you exhaust every option, and this is the only option</p>
<p>left. And then even then, if Merrick Garland was open to basically saying, unseal the warrant,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you do it before and say, we&rsquo;re going to have to serve this guy,</p>
<p>unless he actually gives us these things, there&rsquo;s all kinds of things you could have done.</p>
<p>Oh, clearly, they did keep the hold on a second to keep the temperature of this thing, way,</p>
<p>way down. And to your point, Jamal, they could have let Trump&rsquo;s lawyers watch them do the search</p>
<p>so that nobody could claim anything about anything being planted. Yeah. So the inflammatory index is</p>
<p>spiking. I think that&rsquo;s my key takeaway on all of this. I care less about what Trump did and what</p>
<p>the DOJ did. And you know, when you&rsquo;re more concerned about where this takes us, because</p>
<p>the next step regardless of where it takes us, you know, where it takes us when you&rsquo;re on tilt</p>
<p>at the poker table, what do you do? You cannot think properly. That&rsquo;s where everyone&rsquo;s at right</p>
<p>now. Yeah, when people are so inflamed with emotion, they start to make very poor decisions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the DOJ and main justice made a poor decision or not. I think this is</p>
<p>where we have to hold our breath and hope they didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know whether the White House</p>
<p>knew anything or not. But the whole point of all of this is that we pulled this guy right back in</p>
<p>to the to the to the main stage. Absolutely. I mean, you&rsquo;re like I said, you&rsquo;ve polarized the</p>
<p>outcomes. You&rsquo;re either going to basically send this guy to jail, or you&rsquo;re going to send to the</p>
<p>White House. No, I think there&rsquo;s very likely No, I think there&rsquo;s very likely a middle path where</p>
<p>nothing happens, right? But it will further erode what freebird says, which is, it&rsquo;s just a little</p>
<p>bit less trust in the DOJ is eroding and when institutional integrity, the fabric of what keeps</p>
<p>everything working starts to fall apart. And I&rsquo;m not saying this is some cataclysmic civil war</p>
<p>happening. Just to be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s some cataclysmic civil war happening next</p>
<p>year. But it&rsquo;s an unfortunate decline in everyone&rsquo;s faith and and the stability of the</p>
<p>institutions that we all rely on to support and service us because the inflammatory index is going</p>
<p>to go up and everyone&rsquo;s going to be criticizing everything. And that&rsquo;s why I think we really have</p>
<p>to ask was this really necessary? I mean, why did the DOJ and the FBI think this was necessary?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think these boxes were just in there. I think that&rsquo;s a reasonable question is like,</p>
<p>if these things were actually sitting in a box with a lot that they changed, there must have</p>
<p>been something more that was so grievous, where you had to do something like this. Now, by the way,</p>
<p>David, I just want to I read so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true or not. I think maybe it was in</p>
<p>Barry Weiss&rsquo;s substack or Matt Taibbi substack. These folks weren&rsquo;t armed to the teeth. They came</p>
<p>in jeans and shorts and t shirts. In fact, main justice told them like, do it as not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the photos that I&rsquo;ve seen the photos and I&rsquo;m saying the people inside were there for</p>
<p>six or seven hours. And only a few people knew about it. They were there for nine hours. They</p>
<p>basically told Trump&rsquo;s people they couldn&rsquo;t be there that to leave. They told him to turn the</p>
<p>cameras off. And they had like highly militarized got there was something like 40 people and</p>
<p>something like 30 of them were heavily armed. The optics were terrible. If there was some nuclear</p>
<p>confidential nuclear material in Mar-a-Lago, and through normal means of communication,</p>
<p>they had asked several times to have it returned and identified this for him. And he had refused,</p>
<p>which I think is a very reasonable kind of, you know, conditioning for what may have happened</p>
<p>here. And then they said, Okay, we got to go get it. There&rsquo;s no choice. This is like super</p>
<p>confidential nuclear material, we got to get this stuff. The only way to get it is to serve a</p>
<p>warrant and go in there and get it. You know, under those circumstances, you know, do you think</p>
<p>that this would have been kind of inappropriate, like assume all other kind of communication means</p>
<p>were exhausted? Like, you know, what would you have done if you were president?</p>
<p>Listen, I think there is information that could still come out to convince me that this</p>
<p>raid was warranted. I just haven&rsquo;t seen that information yet. And I think the optics of it</p>
<p>were terrible. I&rsquo;d like right, the point I was making, I don&rsquo;t know why it wouldn&rsquo;t have been</p>
<p>good enough to send in the FBI agents with holstered sidearms, you know, not ar 15 weapons</p>
<p>of war, you know, where the fingers were just outside the trigger guard, it looked like a</p>
<p>paramilitary raid. So whoever was thinking about the political ramification, this clearly didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do a very good job. I also don&rsquo;t know. I also don&rsquo;t know why you wouldn&rsquo;t give the courtesy</p>
<p>to a former president United States to give them either more of a heads up or to let his</p>
<p>lawyers attend so that just for their own protection, so they can&rsquo;t be accused of planning</p>
<p>anything that would have been smart. And I don&rsquo;t know why they would have said to trust people that</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t record it. And I don&rsquo;t know why there&rsquo;s been reports that the FBI went through</p>
<p>Melania&rsquo;s closet. I mean, seriously, they&rsquo;re like going through Melania&rsquo;s clothes. It&rsquo;s just weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird. So there&rsquo;s a lot about this that we don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not conclusively rendering</p>
<p>judgment about it, because there are things that absolutely could come out to convince me</p>
<p>that it was warranted, but I haven&rsquo;t heard them yet. Okay, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see on the next</p>
<p>episode of the all in podcast. Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Oh, man,</p>
<p>we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>We need to get merchies our back</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in</p>
