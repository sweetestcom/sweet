    <p>Hi friends, so this week I want to talk about breakups because people do not</p>
<p>fucking understand them. So I want to give you some explanations that I have</p>
<p>around breakups and why they feel so fucking terrible and also I&rsquo;m gonna give</p>
<p>you some tips about how to navigate one because no one really knows what to tell</p>
<p>you like they fucking suck and people don&rsquo;t understand how deep they actually</p>
<p>are and why they fuck you up the way that they do. Like a breakup is one of</p>
<p>the worst things you can go through as a human being. So I want to shed some light</p>
<p>on a couple of things, give you a couple tips and get you back on your way</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going through a breakup right now I know bitch how hard</p>
<p>it is. I know how bad you&rsquo;re hurting and this podcast is about to help you feel a</p>
<p>lot better. I can guarantee it because this is all the shit I wish someone</p>
<p>would have told me but they didn&rsquo;t. I just had to go through it and figure it</p>
<p>out and even if you&rsquo;re not going through a breakup I still think you should</p>
<p>listen to this episode because it will help you understand them better and it</p>
<p>will help you be there for your friends who are going through breakups and if</p>
<p>you want to sound real smart and if you want to get close to people this is a</p>
<p>way to do it. Like just listen to what the fuck I&rsquo;m gonna tell you. So the main</p>
<p>thing I want everyone to understand about a breakup is they are so much</p>
<p>bigger than people realize. They&rsquo;re gonna fuck you up in a way that most people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t recover from. Like a lot of people never get over a breakup. They never like</p>
<p>fully get through it but your entire life as you knew it is over. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just that you&rsquo;re mourning a person you lost and someone you care about. Your</p>
<p>entire life as you knew it is gone. That&rsquo;s a really big contributor to how</p>
<p>painful it is and it makes it worse. A lot of people don&rsquo;t understand why it</p>
<p>feels like hell and that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s not just that you lost the person. You lost</p>
<p>your life as you knew it. So you&rsquo;re gonna feel like your earth is shattered. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel like you&rsquo;re confused. You&rsquo;re lost. You&rsquo;re scared. All these emotions</p>
<p>are gonna be coming up at once and it&rsquo;s totally normal and it&rsquo;s not just one</p>
<p>aspect of your life that&rsquo;s different. Everything about your life has now</p>
<p>changed. Like as soon as you break up with someone everything changes.</p>
<p>Everything is different. Like your daily routines, your habits, things you think</p>
<p>about, what you prioritize, what you take into consideration, how you spend your</p>
<p>time. All of these things are shifted. It&rsquo;s not just one aspect of your life</p>
<p>that is going wrong. Like literally it fucks with every single thing. A lot of</p>
<p>people talk about your relationships are like your biggest contributor of how</p>
<p>your life is going. Like if your relationship is shit, your whole life is</p>
<p>shit. But if your relationship is okay, your whole life is gonna be okay. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people always say that and they don&rsquo;t understand why but that&rsquo;s it. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because your person occupies so much of what you do and how you think</p>
<p>and like what you feel. But if you&rsquo;re going through a breakup I just want to</p>
<p>reassure you right now you are not crazy. You&rsquo;re not psycho. The way you feel</p>
<p>is not weird or bad or like you&rsquo;re not overreacting. It&rsquo;s very much one of the</p>
<p>most painful things you can go through. So like I said you lose the person you</p>
<p>care for but now you&rsquo;re in a place where your whole life was just wiped out from</p>
<p>under you and you&rsquo;re faced with the reality of like okay I have to construct</p>
<p>a whole new life. But the real fucking kicker is society just expects you to</p>
<p>keep moving. Like people just expect you to keep functioning like nothing just</p>
<p>happened. Like your life didn&rsquo;t just completely stop and that&rsquo;s what it did.</p>
<p>Like your life just stopped as you knew it. It&rsquo;s fucking over and I keep saying</p>
<p>that because that&rsquo;s the truth of it and that&rsquo;s why you feel all these intense</p>
<p>things. But people don&rsquo;t understand like I said how bad breakups are and everybody</p>
<p>just expects you to keep moving and keep going forward and to just walk through</p>
<p>it with your life. Like bitch you&rsquo;re supposed to break down. You&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to literally like feel like the world has just ended. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>feel and to expect people to just function normally after that is</p>
<p>unrealistic. Like your jobs don&rsquo;t give a fuck. There&rsquo;s no paid time off. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>time off really and your bosses don&rsquo;t even see it as a reason to take off work</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going through something like a breakup. Like they don&rsquo;t see like the</p>
<p>emotional damage and the emotional turmoil of it as a valid excuse to be</p>
<p>cut slack. So that&rsquo;s why I want to bring that to everyone&rsquo;s awareness. Like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot bigger than you think and then the expectation of everyone around you</p>
<p>looking at you like you&rsquo;re supposed to just hold it together. That makes it ten</p>
<p>times harder because even if you&rsquo;re in the same place, like you live in the same</p>
<p>house or you live in the same city, everything about the way you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>living is completely new. Like everything you&rsquo;re used to is gone even if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the same spot and that&rsquo;s one thing I suggest if you go through a breakup.</p>
<p>Bitch run away. Run the fuck away and go start a whole new life. Like I swear it</p>
<p>sounds dramatic but it will help a lot because you&rsquo;re gonna think about the</p>
<p>person you just broke up with non-stop and that&rsquo;s normal. Like you are gonna</p>
<p>have them in the forefront of your mind all the time because that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>were when you were together. They&rsquo;re what occupied most of your attention. So when</p>
<p>you now have a void because you lost them, what do you expect your brain to do?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s used to focusing on this thing. Now you&rsquo;re experiencing a lack of this</p>
<p>person. So all your mental state is freed up. Like your brain is just gonna focus</p>
<p>on what it&rsquo;s been used to focusing on which is this person. So you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>think about them all the fucking time. You&rsquo;re in a routine. You&rsquo;re in a habit of</p>
<p>having this person in your life and in your thoughts. It&rsquo;s not just gonna go</p>
<p>away and stop as soon as the person isn&rsquo;t there anymore. It&rsquo;s gonna take time.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the main thing is getting out of the habit and getting out of the</p>
<p>routine of talking to someone and thinking about someone and having them</p>
<p>be such a big role in your life. It&rsquo;s gonna be fucking hell for a while but I</p>
<p>promise you it does get better. And another big thing people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>about breakups is your partner, your person when you&rsquo;re dating them, is your</p>
<p>main emotional support person. Like they&rsquo;re who you go to when you have a</p>
<p>bad day or when you have a good day. Like when you have bad things to talk about,</p>
<p>you need comfort or you want to celebrate. Like your person is always</p>
<p>right there and that&rsquo;s your go-to. Like that&rsquo;s your emotional support system and</p>
<p>your emotional support person most of the time. But when you break up with them</p>
<p>you lose this. So you&rsquo;re feeling all these emotions and you don&rsquo;t have your</p>
<p>emotional support person that you&rsquo;re used to. So you&rsquo;re left to deal with all</p>
<p>your emotions on your own. That&rsquo;s another explanation for why you feel so lost and</p>
<p>scared and why all these emotions feel so overwhelming. And this is the main</p>
<p>reason that I will always say you need to cut contact after you break up. Like</p>
<p>you need to sever it and have it be done. Because you&rsquo;re both gonna be going</p>
<p>through all these emotions. You&rsquo;re both gonna be fucked up in the head. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both gonna be feeling all these things. And like I said, you are each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emotional support system. So that person is who you&rsquo;re used to going to and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re used to going to you. So if you break up and you try and stay in contact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna try to lean on each other for support. Like that&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go. And that&rsquo;s a literal recipe for fucking disaster because you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>feel obligated to be there for each other. Like while you&rsquo;re in your own hurt</p>
<p>when your ex comes to you and they&rsquo;re upset you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you want to</p>
<p>comfort them. Like that&rsquo;s just how you are. You care for them. You&rsquo;re gonna want</p>
<p>to comfort them. And that&rsquo;s the wrong thing to fucking do. Like it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>comfort them sure but it&rsquo;s gonna fuck you both up. Like you have to understand</p>
<p>you lost this person. You no longer have this as an emotional support or a</p>
<p>comfort. Like do not reach out to them for comfort. And that&rsquo;s where most</p>
<p>couples fuck up when they get back together and break up and make up and</p>
<p>break up and make up. And Ron and Sam. Like Jersey Shore. Ron and fucking Sam.</p>
<p>Back and forth all the goddamn time. Because they kept going back and forth</p>
<p>to each other for their emotional support. You have to use this period to</p>
<p>cut them the fuck off and learn how to be your own emotional support. And lean on</p>
<p>your friends. Lean on your family. Lean on people around you. Find another</p>
<p>emotional support system besides your ex. And agreeing to cut contact is really</p>
<p>gonna help that. But if you can&rsquo;t cut contact because I know a lot of people</p>
<p>are like married or they&rsquo;re really deep in relationships and you have a lot to</p>
<p>sort out. Like some people have dogs or like apartments and houses and shit</p>
<p>together. And you have to go about splitting everything up. If you can&rsquo;t cut</p>
<p>contact then at least agree you won&rsquo;t go to each other when you&rsquo;re emotional. You</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t go to each other when you need support or when you need to feel</p>
<p>comforted. Just go to each other with the cold facts of like what the fuck needs</p>
<p>to be done. And don&rsquo;t lean on each other emotionally. And that&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>important to realize because like I said you&rsquo;re both gonna be going through a lot</p>
<p>of different emotions. You&rsquo;re both gonna be feeling all the fucking shit you can</p>
<p>feel as a human. Like literally you&rsquo;re both reconstructing your entire lives</p>
<p>and trying to navigate it like a blind fucking puppy or like a brand new giraffe.</p>
<p>Like you know when it stands up and it can&rsquo;t fucking walk and it like stumbles</p>
<p>around. That&rsquo;s how you are emotionally after a breakup. But I want to dive a</p>
<p>little bit into the emotions of it. So you&rsquo;re gonna have points where you are</p>
<p>in complete despair. You&rsquo;re gonna be sad. You&rsquo;re gonna be hysterical fucking</p>
<p>crying. You&rsquo;re gonna be so fucking upset for a good period. But they come in waves.</p>
<p>So these emotions are gonna come in waves. They are not gonna come and stay.</p>
<p>Your emotional system does not stay in any extreme state. So for you to feel</p>
<p>positive emotions, when something good happens you feel positive emotions. You</p>
<p>feel happy. You feel excited. And then after like a couple of minutes, an hour,</p>
<p>whatever it is, after it dies down your emotional state goes back to a sense of</p>
<p>normal. Like you&rsquo;re just you kind of rest at a state of neutral. That&rsquo;s how all</p>
<p>humans are. And you don&rsquo;t even have to try. Because when something good happens</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re happy. You experience the heightened positive emotions. And then</p>
<p>you just gradually just go back to a place of neutral. You don&rsquo;t have to try.</p>
<p>It just does it on its own. And I want to reassure you, when you&rsquo;re feeling very</p>
<p>intense states of negative emotions, you&rsquo;re not gonna stay there. Your</p>
<p>emotional system will get you back to a place of neutral. So there are gonna be</p>
<p>periods where you are hysterical crying upset. And you don&rsquo;t know how to fix the</p>
<p>feeling you&rsquo;re feeling. But you don&rsquo;t want to feel it. Like it&rsquo;s just the worst</p>
<p>fucking helplessness and sadness that you&rsquo;ve ever felt. And in those moments</p>
<p>just let yourself cry. Because it stops. It does stop. I promise you are not gonna</p>
<p>stay there forever. And it&rsquo;s very very hard to sit in these emotional states.</p>
<p>But you need to. Like I said it&rsquo;s a wave. The wave is gonna come on very strong.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s gonna pass. Like you&rsquo;re gonna get back to a state of neutral. I</p>
<p>promise. Like you don&rsquo;t just sit in a state of despair for 24 fucking hours</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re upset. Like you&rsquo;ll be really upset. And when I say like deep states of</p>
<p>despair, I&rsquo;m talking about where you can&rsquo;t function. Like all you can do is</p>
<p>just break the fuck down and cry. Or be angry or whatever it is. Like however you</p>
<p>go emotionally with all this. Like you&rsquo;re gonna have very very intense waves where</p>
<p>it debilitates you. You can&rsquo;t do anything. You can&rsquo;t fucking function. And those are</p>
<p>the times that I&rsquo;m saying the wave is gonna pass. It&rsquo;s hitting you like a</p>
<p>fucking truck when it hits you. But it passes. I promise. Because if you think</p>
<p>about going through a breakup or being very sad, you can&rsquo;t hang out in a very</p>
<p>very extremely negative state for too long. Like you can&rsquo;t be debilitated for</p>
<p>too long. You always get back to a point where like okay I can go eat. Or I can go</p>
<p>take a piss. Or I can go drink some water. Like there&rsquo;s points where it lets up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s points where the wave will break and you get like relief for a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not always gonna be in the very very negative like sad despair like</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t function states. Because it takes a lot of energy for your body to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you rest that neutral. Like it&rsquo;s very exhausting to stay in a</p>
<p>heightened emotional state for too long. Like you&rsquo;re gonna have periods of breaks.</p>
<p>And I just want you to remind yourself of that when you&rsquo;re fucking bawling. Like</p>
<p>when you are debilitated by the way that you feel and you cannot function, just</p>
<p>remind yourself and comfort yourself. Just stick through it. It&rsquo;s gonna stop. I</p>
<p>promise it&rsquo;s gonna stop. If you have to replay this, play it. But I promise the</p>
<p>way you&rsquo;re feeling is going to stop. It&rsquo;s going to let up. It&rsquo;s just a wave. The</p>
<p>waves of heavy emotions will never stop as long as you live. But there are gaps</p>
<p>in between them and you will get better at learning to surf them. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be drowned by them for long. That&rsquo;s just for now. I have a couple of</p>
<p>tips for dealing with this. But I do want to say my number one fucking rule is do</p>
<p>not act when you are highly emotional. Do not take an action. Okay? So when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in one of these very very high states of like, oh my fucking god I&rsquo;m gonna die. Do</p>
<p>not act. Don&rsquo;t reach out to them. Don&rsquo;t message them. Don&rsquo;t call them. Don&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>anything on social media. Literally just sit with yourself and let yourself cry.</p>
<p>Sit with yourself through that wave and get through it. Do not act when you are</p>
<p>highly emotional. You are not rational. So just remember me saying this. Do not take</p>
<p>fucking action. Do not act when you are feeling very very intense emotions.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where you do shit you regret and you fuck up. And when you want</p>
<p>to lean on your emotional support person, when you&rsquo;re in the very heavy emotions</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re the weakest and when you will do it. So don&rsquo;t. Literally just</p>
<p>remember, do not act. So once you&rsquo;re back at a place of neutral and you can</p>
<p>function again, that is when you can take different actions. But when you&rsquo;re sad</p>
<p>you have to just let yourself fucking cry. You have to let yourself sit in the</p>
<p>devastation. But do not act while you&rsquo;re in it. So when I get emotional or get</p>
<p>very very upset, I isolate myself. I do not like people to see me cry. Like I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>cry at raves and festivals and like fun stuff like that. Like when I do mushrooms</p>
<p>I fucking cry. I always have some kind of realization and I cry. But it&rsquo;s never a</p>
<p>sad like devastated cry. It&rsquo;s like I just cry. You know? Like it&rsquo;s just like a</p>
<p>weird little, I don&rsquo;t know. But I don&rsquo;t like for people to see me when I&rsquo;m sad.</p>
<p>Like I was raised that that&rsquo;s weak and I understand that it&rsquo;s not now. But I still</p>
<p>am very very uncomfortable allowing people to see me when I&rsquo;m sad. Because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been attacked when I&rsquo;m down like that. So what you don&rsquo;t want is for</p>
<p>yourself to be going through one of these really really heavy waves and then</p>
<p>break down in front of someone that&rsquo;s gonna attack you. So the way that I would</p>
<p>avoid this and the way that I still avoid it is by just being alone. Just go</p>
<p>somewhere where you feel safe to let it out and be vulnerable. So like when I was</p>
<p>going through my biggest breakup, I would go get in my car and drive to an empty</p>
<p>parking lot and just sit there for a couple hours and just fucking cry. Like I</p>
<p>would just literally go isolate myself in the car and just cry because I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>live alone. But I didn&rsquo;t feel safe to be vulnerable with people around me or near</p>
<p>me or they could walk in. So I would literally just cry in my fucking car and</p>
<p>I would just get through it. Another place to cry is the shower because people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fucking hear you and you can literally sit in there for like an hour.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing that I used to do a lot when I was going through it is like</p>
<p>just cry in a shower. Like just fucking get it out. Let it out. Learn to comfort</p>
<p>yourself when you&rsquo;re upset. So like hug a fucking pillow. Like that&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>thing is just sit with yourself and let yourself cry. Let yourself be absolutely</p>
<p>beat the fuck down by the wave of emotion you&rsquo;re feeling. Don&rsquo;t resist it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to fight it. Just let yourself fucking cry. Like you&rsquo;re going through a</p>
<p>big mourning process. You&rsquo;re mourning the person that you lost and you&rsquo;re mourning</p>
<p>the life that you had. Everything you knew is gone. You&rsquo;re gonna feel scared.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel unsafe. Like everything&rsquo;s gonna be uncertain. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be lost. You&rsquo;re gonna feel all these things and that&rsquo;s not easy to</p>
<p>manage. So don&rsquo;t try to manage it. Just let yourself fucking cry it out. And my</p>
<p>next tip for dealing with situations like this when you&rsquo;re really really</p>
<p>emotional is do not try to be logical with the way that you feel. I will open</p>
<p>up because I need to for this example. When I was going through my worst</p>
<p>breakup I knew the person that I had left was not good for me. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>what I wanted. But when I left and I was sad and I was dealing with the emotional</p>
<p>waves like this. This is where I say don&rsquo;t be fucking logical. Like all I</p>
<p>kept repeating to myself as I was just sitting in my fucking bed like crying.</p>
<p>Like I was just like rolling around hugging a pillow. Like literally like</p>
<p>it was like a fucking child throwing a tantrum. Like I literally was going the</p>
<p>fuck through it. I didn&rsquo;t think I was gonna make it and every wave I was like</p>
<p>wondering am I gonna make it through this and I did. And I&rsquo;m just I want to</p>
<p>reiterate that like it gets the best of us. As strong as you see me now it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>easy. I had to go the fuck through it to be able to stand as strong as I am. But</p>
<p>when I was at my lowest and I was the most sad all I was repeating to myself</p>
<p>was I just want to go back. I just want to go back. I just want to go back. And I</p>
<p>kept trying to fight myself and be like Leo he&rsquo;s not what you fucking want. You</p>
<p>know you don&rsquo;t want that. Like what the fuck why are you saying you want to go</p>
<p>back. And I learned do not try to be logical when you&rsquo;re upset. Like when I</p>
<p>just kept saying I just want to go back I just started saying I know. Like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two different people I&rsquo;m trying to comfort. I was like I know I know I know</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m sorry. Like I just kept apologizing to myself because I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>letting myself go back. And I was no longer trying to fight myself about</p>
<p>wanting to go back. I didn&rsquo;t tell the part of me that wanted to go back to</p>
<p>shut up or question it or try and fight it and be like no you don&rsquo;t want to go</p>
<p>back because all I felt was that I did. So I had to learn how to take care of</p>
<p>the part of me that wanted to go back. Like I just had to be there for him and</p>
<p>let him fucking cry and let him be sad. Like I know you want to go back and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry. And I just learned to be there for him. I stopped trying to be logical. I</p>
<p>stopped trying to talk him out of it. I stopped trying to look for proof of like</p>
<p>why the person I left was like a fuck up and why it was never gonna work and why</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. Because that didn&rsquo;t do anything for me. It made me</p>
<p>feel worse. So stop punishing yourself for wanting to go back. Stop punishing</p>
<p>yourself for missing them. Don&rsquo;t try to convince yourself you don&rsquo;t miss them</p>
<p>and that you don&rsquo;t care about them. Oh fuck them. Don&rsquo;t say any of that. Just be</p>
<p>there for the part of you that does want to go back. Because that&rsquo;s a part of you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s screaming for your attention. Like you&rsquo;re literally so fucking upset. Because</p>
<p>part of you does want nothing more than just to be with this person and to care</p>
<p>about this person. But you have to govern that part of you. And you just</p>
<p>have to be there for yourself. You have to let yourself break down and just</p>
<p>comfort you. Like learn to truly comfort yourself for the first time. And that</p>
<p>comes by not fighting yourself. So don&rsquo;t try to be logical. Don&rsquo;t try to talk</p>
<p>yourself out of how you feel. Just feel it. Just literally let yourself feel it</p>
<p>and be there for yourself through it. It&rsquo;s way easier said than done. But I had</p>
<p>to learn this while I was going through it and it made such a difference. So I</p>
<p>wanted to share it. And I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make this episode for a long</p>
<p>time. But there&rsquo;s just so much that goes into it. And this is such a heavy topic. I</p>
<p>wanted to make sure I like hit it right. So the next part I want to talk about is</p>
<p>everything in your life when you&rsquo;re going through a breakup is gonna seem</p>
<p>difficult. Everything is gonna seem hard. Everything is gonna feel like it takes</p>
<p>so much energy. Like getting out of bed is gonna seem like the biggest fucking</p>
<p>task of the day. Taking care of yourself. Like don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overrun with all these heavy emotions and your life kind of like slips for a</p>
<p>minute. Like you&rsquo;ll get it back together in a second. Like you have to go through</p>
<p>it. You have to feel all this shit. And to feel debilitating emotions you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect yourself to function at the same time. So be easy on yourself. Everything</p>
<p>is gonna seem hard. And that&rsquo;s normal. Like everything is gonna seem so</p>
<p>difficult. Because you have a giant hole in your life now. You literally have a</p>
<p>giant fucking hole in your life. And I&rsquo;m talking every aspect of it. So it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I come up to you and I shoot you with a shotgun and I blow a giant hole in your</p>
<p>chest. Bitch you think it&rsquo;s not gonna impact you? You think it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>affect you? You think it&rsquo;s not gonna make everything difficult? You think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna hurt? Like that&rsquo;s exactly what happens to you when you lose someone.</p>
<p>Like emotionally you have a giant fucking hole. With your attention you</p>
<p>have a giant hole. With your entire life you have a giant hole. You&rsquo;re such a</p>
<p>void everywhere. And it&rsquo;s so obvious now because this person is no longer there.</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s gonna feel difficult for a minute. It&rsquo;s gonna feel tiring. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna feel exhausting. But just how you learned to live with this person. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gonna take you a minute and you will learn how to live without them. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time. You&rsquo;re not gonna be sad forever. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be confused. And everything&rsquo;s not gonna feel difficult forever. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gonna take you a minute like I said to get out of the habit and the routine</p>
<p>of having this person in your life. You&rsquo;re gonna learn to live without them</p>
<p>again. I promise. You can&rsquo;t not. Like you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s gonna happen. It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen a lot more effortless than you think. But the first few days, first</p>
<p>few weeks, first month is gonna be the hardest part. And once you get through</p>
<p>that, the hard work is basically done. Like just sitting through all the</p>
<p>emotions is done. Now you just have to start taking different actions and</p>
<p>implementing different things into your day and boom like you&rsquo;ve learned to live</p>
<p>without them again. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s gonna be easy. It&rsquo;s gonna be one of the</p>
<p>hardest fucking things you do. But don&rsquo;t get scared and convince yourself that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t live without them. You can. You did before you met them. And life is not</p>
<p>always gonna feel bad. So the next thing I want to hit on is something that a lot</p>
<p>of people don&rsquo;t really talk about. But it&rsquo;s something that fucked me up big</p>
<p>time when I was going through my bad breakup. I felt like no one else would</p>
<p>want me. Like I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s a thing for breakups but the more people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked to about it, that&rsquo;s universal for everyone. Everyone kind of</p>
<p>feels that way. It&rsquo;s weird. Like I was so scared when I was going through it that</p>
<p>no one would want me. I felt ugly. I felt like no one was attracted to me. I felt</p>
<p>like worthless and I was like this is the only person that will ever care</p>
<p>about me. Like I convinced myself of that. And it felt so fucking real. Like I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know how to not feel like that because it just felt so real.</p>
<p>Like I just felt like the reality of it. It wasn&rsquo;t like oh I&rsquo;m making myself</p>
<p>think that. It was just there. Like it wasn&rsquo;t even a question. It was just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reality as I just felt no one would want me. Nothing was ever gonna be</p>
<p>okay. Nothing was ever gonna be good. And I felt so unattractive. And that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>staying broken up is so hard sometimes. Because your brain kind of convinces you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re undesirable and nobody else wants you. And even if you know that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re physically hot, you&rsquo;re scared no one else is gonna care about you. And</p>
<p>like worry about the way that you feel and love you. And it&rsquo;s just a weird</p>
<p>dynamic that goes on in your fucking head. But we all feel it. And I promise</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true. Because that&rsquo;s one of the things that really fucked with me. And</p>
<p>really made it difficult for me. As I was so just worried no one would love me. And</p>
<p>no one would care about me. And no one would like me ever again. Like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why I thought oh this is the only person that can do it. But I just want to</p>
<p>reassure you. You&rsquo;re not ugly. You&rsquo;re not worthless. You&rsquo;re not void of value. Like</p>
<p>other people will want you. Other people will care about you. You&rsquo;re just got to</p>
<p>get through this little patch. And another thing I want to bring up is when</p>
<p>you go through day-to-day life, it&rsquo;s gonna feel different. It&rsquo;s gonna feel a</p>
<p>lot different. Because the way you move when you&rsquo;re single versus the way you</p>
<p>move when you&rsquo;re in a relationship is two different things. I fucking hope for</p>
<p>all y&rsquo;all. I hope it&rsquo;s two different goddamn things. But when I&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>relationship, I don&rsquo;t look around really like other people. Like I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. But like I&rsquo;m not checking people out. I&rsquo;m not being flirty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being like overly nice. You know what I mean? I&rsquo;m always trying to make</p>
<p>sure that my behavior is respectful of the person that I&rsquo;m with. But when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>single or when you&rsquo;re newly single, all that&rsquo;s gone. And you get your freedom</p>
<p>back to do whatever the fuck you want. So like just stepping out of your house is</p>
<p>gonna feel different. And also the reassurance of just having someone at</p>
<p>home is something that you no longer have. Like you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>trying to look cute or presentable or like trying to get other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attention when you&rsquo;re with someone. Like when you have a partner. I hope, like I</p>
<p>said for the other one. And I don&rsquo;t really know how to explain that. But</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all get what I fucking mean. Y&rsquo;all get it. You&rsquo;re not worried about shit when</p>
<p>you have someone at home. Like everything is just like eh. Like it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>just reassurance in the sense of like safety. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it</p>
<p>but we all get it. But when you&rsquo;re not in a relationship anymore, you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to give yourself a second to readjust of like okay I can talk to</p>
<p>these people. I can flirt. I do actually want to put effort into my appearance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna come a little bit after you&rsquo;re through like the whole traumatic</p>
<p>cry-cry part of the breakup. But everything&rsquo;s gonna feel different. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the way it&rsquo;s gonna go. Like I said you have to get used to being single</p>
<p>again. Like it&rsquo;s a whole different mindset. It&rsquo;s a whole different way of</p>
<p>like being for most people. So if you notice everything feels different in</p>
<p>that aspect to like the way you just feel in public, that&rsquo;s normal because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the security at home and you now have to behave like you&rsquo;re single</p>
<p>again. Not like you&rsquo;re fucking booed up. So my last point and I think it is one</p>
<p>of the biggest is you can want to go back to them and you can want to be back</p>
<p>in the relationship and still not go back. Okay you can still choose to not go</p>
<p>back even though you feel all these things inside you and you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you want. If you can logically look at a person and say okay that is not who</p>
<p>I want, you can miss them and still not go back. If you know they&rsquo;re not what you</p>
<p>want and they&rsquo;re not ever gonna be what you want, you don&rsquo;t have to choose them</p>
<p>just because you love them. If you know that they&rsquo;re gonna be damaging to you, if</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re gonna hold you back from what you can achieve in life or</p>
<p>what you want out of life and you feel like you&rsquo;re limiting yourself or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>settling by being with them, you&rsquo;re free to move forward. You don&rsquo;t have to choose</p>
<p>to go back to them just because you care for them. Just because you love them you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to choose them if they&rsquo;re not right for you. And if they&rsquo;ve just hurt</p>
<p>you one too many times and you know you&rsquo;ll never be able to trust them, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go back. Everything inside you is gonna pull you toward them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like oh my god I just want to fucking go back. I went through it. I was</p>
<p>literally fucking crying hysterical and all I could say is I just want to go</p>
<p>back. I just want to go back. But the reason I felt like I just wanted to go</p>
<p>back is because that is how I was gonna alleviate the way that I was feeling.</p>
<p>Being without him fucking sucked. It was just a pain I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with. So</p>
<p>being with the person I was with, I knew what it was like and I was used to that</p>
<p>level of like discomfort and kind of like the weird feelings of it and like I</p>
<p>want to say pain but not being with him and experiencing losing him and losing</p>
<p>the life that I had with him, that was a pain that was new to me and it was very</p>
<p>overwhelming and I didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with that yet. So my brain</p>
<p>immediately resorted to a time when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling the pain I was currently</p>
<p>feeling and it was when I was with him. So my brain thinks the solution is going</p>
<p>back because it alleviates the pain. But I just want you to know both options are</p>
<p>painful. To go be with someone and be in a relationship that you do not want and</p>
<p>you know will limit you is pain. To learn to be without them is pain. Only</p>
<p>one of them stops. Because once you learn how to live without this person, that</p>
<p>pain is gone. That&rsquo;ll take a couple of months. You&rsquo;ll get the fuck through it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be just fine. You&rsquo;ll be better than ever. But being in that relationship</p>
<p>you know you shouldn&rsquo;t be in, that&rsquo;s a pain you will endure forever. So I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want you to look at, oh going back alleviates the pain. No. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>choosing a different kind of pain. That&rsquo;s the thing. You need to understand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a choice. And you need to ask yourself, which pain do I want to choose?</p>
<p>Do I want the pain of being in the relationship I know I don&rsquo;t want? Or do I</p>
<p>want the pain that&rsquo;s temporary of learning how to be without them? And that</p>
<p>makes it very clear when I said you can want them and still choose not to be</p>
<p>with them. So I just want you to remember that. You are picking your pain. So choose</p>
<p>the one that is gonna get you what you want. Alright, I&rsquo;m gonna leave you off</p>
<p>there. I hope you enjoyed this episode. If you found it helpful, leave me a five</p>
<p>stars before you get to crying again if you&rsquo;re going through a breakup. But</p>
<p>please if this helped you, message me on Instagram and just let me know. Because</p>
<p>hearing that my podcast helps people is what helps me keep going. It makes me</p>
<p>want to keep making them. So I would love to know if any of this helped you. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through a breakup, I promise it gets better. You&rsquo;re gonna get through</p>
<p>this. Just understand your emotions right now are waves. They&rsquo;re gonna come</p>
<p>and go. They&rsquo;re gonna feel very intense at times. Sometimes there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>fucking tsunami type waves. Like the biggest waves you ever seen in your life.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll make it. Other times it&rsquo;s gonna be like little kiddie</p>
<p>pool waves. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a little wave. It just hits you in the knee and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s it. Like there&rsquo;s gonna be different levels of emotion. But I</p>
<p>promise you will get through all of it. So stay strong. Lean on your family and</p>
<p>friends and do not let yourself down. That&rsquo;s the biggest thing. I have just</p>
<p>opened up some new appointment times and days and I&rsquo;m taking on clients again. So</p>
<p>if you want help with going through a breakup or anything else you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>going on, you can submit an application to work with me one-on-one. I will put</p>
<p>the link in the description of this podcast. The link will also be in my</p>
<p>Instagram bio and wherever else you find me on social media. The link will be</p>
<p>there. Just know you&rsquo;ve always got someone there for you. I&rsquo;ve got you and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get through this. I just want to reiterate that. You&rsquo;re gonna make</p>
<p>it through. I fucking promise. But that&rsquo;s all I got for this episode. Please be</p>
<p>safe. Take care of yourself and I will talk to you guys next Sunday.</p>
