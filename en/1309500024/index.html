    <p>hi guys how are you today my name is Bailey</p>
<p>Syrian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder Mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>how are you guys</p>
<p>today I hope you are having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>oh I said this already my apologies</p>
<p>if you are new here hi</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down and I talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup at the same time it&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>kind of yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime or you like makeup I</p>
<p>would highly suggest that you subscribe so</p>
<p>today I want to talk about Tim Mcclain</p>
<p>and this Greyhound bus situation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>awful and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird so I guess I&rsquo;ll just shut up and let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>right into it</p>
<p>so Tim Mcclain was born October</p>
<p>3rd 1985 he grew up outside of Winnipeg Canada</p>
<p>in a small town called Eli Manitoba</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s just one of those</p>
<p>small towns where</p>
<p>growing up you really have to</p>
<p>make up your own fun</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s small towns for you</p>
<p>you build like little mud huts and</p>
<p>stuff did anyone build mud huts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we did</p>
<p>so tim&rsquo;s friends would say that he was very outgoing he</p>
<p>loved people</p>
<p>he was not shy at all</p>
<p>like if he got invited somewhere</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t know anybody in the room</p>
<p>he would be able to go up to anybody</p>
<p>and just like make friends with them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so envious of people like that</p>
<p>I aspire to be like that but you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely opposite I&rsquo;m like hmm</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter Tim</p>
<p>loved just meeting new people</p>
<p>seeing new places</p>
<p>so one summer when Tim was</p>
<p>22 at this time his longtime friend since like</p>
<p>childhood hit</p>
<p>him up and was like hey what are you doing this summer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nothing well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he said nothing but he was like nothing</p>
<p>she told him hey okay well pack</p>
<p>your bag for like a week I don&rsquo;t know how long we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be gone but</p>
<p>pack your bag for a week</p>
<p>and come meet me at this at this</p>
<p>place I got a job opportunity for you</p>
<p>so the 2 of them go</p>
<p>to this job opportunity and it&rsquo;s actually at a carnival</p>
<p>working as carnies</p>
<p>is that the</p>
<p>right term I believe so</p>
<p>carnivals travel from city to city</p>
<p>gotta work all the different games and</p>
<p>stuff it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be like a permanent job</p>
<p>it was just like a</p>
<p>quick little</p>
<p>thing but then it turned into a long summer job</p>
<p>for the whole summers</p>
<p>it seemed like a lot of fun like you become really</p>
<p>close with everybody that you work with at the carnival</p>
<p>and you become like a tight knit</p>
<p>family pretty much who</p>
<p>travels from</p>
<p>city to city so you&rsquo;re constantly seeing new</p>
<p>places new cities meeting new people constantly</p>
<p>so it was like the perfect job for Tim because he</p>
<p>loved traveling</p>
<p>and he loved meeting new people</p>
<p>he seemed to like find a</p>
<p>passion in it like he was very passionate</p>
<p>about this job</p>
<p>and honestly I</p>
<p>22 like that</p>
<p>sounds like a fun ass job</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re traveling with a</p>
<p>bunch of people who became now like your friends</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going from city to city you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;re seeing cool</p>
<p>places that you probably</p>
<p>would have never seen before</p>
<p>you just having a good time a good summer</p>
<p>so it was the perfect</p>
<p>job for him</p>
<p>now at this time I</p>
<p>think he had a</p>
<p>girlfriend I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>quite sure it was kind of hard to find a lot of</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>on tim&rsquo;s like upbringing and</p>
<p>background and</p>
<p>stuff he had a</p>
<p>girlfriend I think</p>
<p>or they were just like hanging out you know</p>
<p>so her name was Colleen</p>
<p>and he knew her</p>
<p>since like first</p>
<p>grade after high</p>
<p>school and all that they went</p>
<p>their separate ways</p>
<p>this Colleen lady she</p>
<p>ended up getting</p>
<p>married and then she got a divorce</p>
<p>and her and Tim</p>
<p>started hanging out</p>
<p>after she got a divorce and this was in like</p>
<p>2008 so they kind of like rekindled</p>
<p>their friendship or whatever</p>
<p>so not long</p>
<p>after Colleen</p>
<p>was pregnant</p>
<p>this would be her</p>
<p>3rd child so</p>
<p>she had 2 from her previous</p>
<p>marriage and this</p>
<p>would be tim&rsquo;s Tim was back working at the carnival</p>
<p>and at this time it was at Edmonton</p>
<p>and the carnival&rsquo;s next stop was Regina</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when Tim made a crucial decision</p>
<p>instead of going to Regina</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d go home to Winnipeg</p>
<p>to make arrangements for his move to British Columbia</p>
<p>he liked it there so he</p>
<p>planned on moving</p>
<p>some friends</p>
<p>offered to buy him a</p>
<p>plane ticket so he didn&rsquo;t have to take the bus</p>
<p>because it would be a 24 hour bus ride</p>
<p>but Tim insisted on taking the Greyhound</p>
<p>bus then just</p>
<p>after midnight on July 30</p>
<p>Bus 1170 began</p>
<p>its journey</p>
<p>24 hour journey</p>
<p>back home okay so then there is another person in this</p>
<p>story and his name is</p>
<p>Vince Lee now he was born in China</p>
<p>Vince was born</p>
<p>April 30th 1968 and then he</p>
<p>moved to Canada</p>
<p>in June of 2001 he</p>
<p>ended up going to college there</p>
<p>and he graduated in 2002 with</p>
<p>a computer programming degree he worked in Winnipeg</p>
<p>at a church for 6</p>
<p>months and he</p>
<p>got married</p>
<p>and he was trying to support his wife Anna</p>
<p>his old boss at this church</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>Vince seemed</p>
<p>like really nice really</p>
<p>happy he seemed</p>
<p>thankful to be having</p>
<p>a job because he was having a hard time finding a job</p>
<p>and he seemed</p>
<p>very committed to what he was doing as well</p>
<p>now there was a language barrier</p>
<p>and his old boss</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>it was frustrating for</p>
<p>Vince because</p>
<p>you know lack</p>
<p>of communication or not being able to communicate</p>
<p>with someone is just really frustrating in general</p>
<p>his old boss</p>
<p>would say that he</p>
<p>could tell Vince was</p>
<p>frustrated because</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t seem to communicate</p>
<p>clearly with</p>
<p>his co workers and stuff</p>
<p>learning a new language is effing</p>
<p>hard come on</p>
<p>his old boss</p>
<p>would also say that</p>
<p>Vince showed no signs of</p>
<p>aggression he didn&rsquo;t seem like an</p>
<p>angry man so then in 2005</p>
<p>Vince started working as a forklift</p>
<p>operator in Winnipeg and his wife worked as a waitress</p>
<p>and then Vince</p>
<p>moved to Edmonton</p>
<p>in 2006 he worked a lot of just</p>
<p>random jobs</p>
<p>he was working at Walmart he was working at a fast food</p>
<p>restaurant he worked at a newspaper delivery boy man</p>
<p>sorry Vince was getting more and more</p>
<p>frustrated over time because</p>
<p>he had this degree</p>
<p>for computer</p>
<p>programming</p>
<p>and he was working these</p>
<p>random little jobs nothing in his</p>
<p>you know what he went</p>
<p>to college for so he was just growing more and more</p>
<p>frustrated and then</p>
<p>later in 2005</p>
<p>Vince would be</p>
<p>diagnosed with</p>
<p>schizophrenia</p>
<p>and this would be left untreated</p>
<p>but him and his wife</p>
<p>ended up getting a divorce</p>
<p>and he left a note for his ex wife Anna saying</p>
<p>quote I&rsquo;m gone</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look for me</p>
<p>I wish you were</p>
<p>happy end quote</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no report on what his plan was or like</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>gonna go he just wanted to get out of there</p>
<p>and it seems like this Anna</p>
<p>lady wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happy so he was just leaving</p>
<p>I guess according to Anna his</p>
<p>ex wife it was a complete surprise like it was super</p>
<p>random that he left he was just gone one day and she</p>
<p>found that letter</p>
<p>and it was like oh</p>
<p>why guess I&rsquo;m single now</p>
<p>July 29th Vince</p>
<p>gets on a Greyhound bus</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bound for Winnipeg</p>
<p>around 6pm Vince</p>
<p>got off of the bus</p>
<p>in Ericsson Manitoba</p>
<p>Manitoba Manitoba</p>
<p>is that okay</p>
<p>mm hmm now Vince</p>
<p>got off this bus and Ericsson and he had</p>
<p>3 pieces of luggage with him</p>
<p>and he stayed the</p>
<p>night on a bench</p>
<p>next to a grocery store</p>
<p>but close to the bus stop</p>
<p>you know because he wanted to hop on to another bus</p>
<p>according to one witness</p>
<p>they saw Vince</p>
<p>like sitting on the</p>
<p>on the bench and it was like 3 a m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what they were doing at 3 a</p>
<p>m but whatever they see</p>
<p>Vince sitting</p>
<p>like straight up and his eyes are like wide open</p>
<p>and they remembered this because it was weird</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure if any of us saw that I</p>
<p>would be like um</p>
<p>fuck that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going over here</p>
<p>so then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>later reported that Vince</p>
<p>sold some of his</p>
<p>his luggage</p>
<p>I guess in order to make</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>clear on that</p>
<p>anyways but he</p>
<p>saw he sells some of his</p>
<p>luggage and in his luggage was like his computer and</p>
<p>stuff and he decided you know what fuck it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna sell it</p>
<p>so he sells it</p>
<p>makes some money</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s waiting for the next bus to come</p>
<p>at this bus stop that he was at there was only one bus</p>
<p>that came a day so he&rsquo;s waiting for that specific bus</p>
<p>now finally at 6 55 pm a bus pulls up to the bus stop</p>
<p>this is the same bus that Tim is on remember Tim</p>
<p>I just talked</p>
<p>about him I really hope you remember</p>
<p>so the bus pulls over people get off so they can</p>
<p>smoke their cigarettes</p>
<p>or stretch their legs</p>
<p>and they pick up any new passengers</p>
<p>Vince he hops</p>
<p>on this bus</p>
<p>now Vince was like a tall man he&rsquo;s in his</p>
<p>forties he has a shaved head he&rsquo;s wearing sunglasses</p>
<p>he seemed to just kind of mind his own</p>
<p>business this is according to people on the bus so when</p>
<p>Vince got onto the bus originally he sat like in the</p>
<p>front of the bus</p>
<p>now Tim was actually in the back of the bus like</p>
<p>the very very back row</p>
<p>not that that&rsquo;s bad or</p>
<p>anything but Tim was in the back and when you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>back of the bus you&rsquo;re kind of like cornered into the</p>
<p>the back if I say back one more time anyway so</p>
<p>Vince gets on the bus and he&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>in the very</p>
<p>front so a scheduled rest stop came up</p>
<p>and Tim stepped out so he</p>
<p>could have a cigarette</p>
<p>and a lot of people got off so</p>
<p>again they could stretch</p>
<p>their legs they</p>
<p>could get snacks at the vending machine or whatever</p>
<p>now when Tim got back onto the bus he goes back to</p>
<p>his seat that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>Vince he gets up</p>
<p>from his seat</p>
<p>and he goes to the back of the bus and sits</p>
<p>next to the</p>
<p>empty seat that&rsquo;s next to Tim</p>
<p>so tim&rsquo;s like at a window seat</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>Vince is sitting next to him</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people sitting in</p>
<p>front of him</p>
<p>and then behind them is</p>
<p>like a wall so</p>
<p>again cornered</p>
<p>now witnesses</p>
<p>say it didn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>Vincelike knew</p>
<p>him at all but Tim was friendly</p>
<p>he when Vince came and sat next to him Tim said</p>
<p>hello how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>going cause</p>
<p>again he was a friendly guy</p>
<p>so Tim puts on like his headphones</p>
<p>listens to music</p>
<p>and he kind of leans his head on the window so he</p>
<p>could just go to bed</p>
<p>on the bus they&rsquo;ve got the little TVs</p>
<p>going and they have The Return of Zorro playing some</p>
<p>passengers are</p>
<p>sleeping some are</p>
<p>reading so suddenly out of nowhere</p>
<p>the passengers just hear</p>
<p>like a blood curdling scream</p>
<p>wakes everybody up</p>
<p>and it was coming from the back of the bus</p>
<p>so according to witnesses it was</p>
<p>about 8 30 pm</p>
<p>and Tim was</p>
<p>sleeping with his headphones on when</p>
<p>suddenly the man next to him just</p>
<p>pulled out a large</p>
<p>knife from his backpack</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>began to stab Tim</p>
<p>and he was stabbing</p>
<p>Tim in the neck and in the chest</p>
<p>just going to town on this poor kid</p>
<p>now again witnesses</p>
<p>would say that Tim</p>
<p>tried to fight back he was trying his hardest to get</p>
<p>Vince off of him</p>
<p>then it said</p>
<p>that Tim was either</p>
<p>thrown onto the</p>
<p>floor of the bus or he fell onto the</p>
<p>floor of the bus tim&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>again was towards the back of the bus so the seats in</p>
<p>front of him made it</p>
<p>really difficult</p>
<p>to escape because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cornered</p>
<p>killer is right here</p>
<p>right and then you got people in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>and a window right here</p>
<p>where are you supposed to go</p>
<p>now the bus driver his name was Bruce</p>
<p>he is yelling at</p>
<p>Vince to stop to</p>
<p>stop I mean what can you do you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>stop that you know</p>
<p>he pulls over to the side of the road</p>
<p>quickly all the passengers get off of the bus</p>
<p>Bruce the bus driver stays behind</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s yelling at Vince</p>
<p>to stop please stop please stop trying to reason with</p>
<p>Vince and Bruce says that&rsquo;s when Vince</p>
<p>was like holding the</p>
<p>knife and walking towards Bruce</p>
<p>and Bruce is like fuck that</p>
<p>so he gets off the bus he</p>
<p>closes the door</p>
<p>and he like barricades</p>
<p>it locks it make sure that</p>
<p>Vince cannot escape</p>
<p>sadly just leaving</p>
<p>Vince and Tim inside</p>
<p>now they didn&rsquo;t know at that time like</p>
<p>if Tim was still</p>
<p>alive should we</p>
<p>get him like</p>
<p>should we say try and save him what</p>
<p>should we do everyone&rsquo;s just panicking</p>
<p>so a bus driver</p>
<p>was driving in the area and he sees</p>
<p>the bus pulled over</p>
<p>and he sees a</p>
<p>bunch of people and they all look like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in distress</p>
<p>so this bus driver</p>
<p>named Chris</p>
<p>he pulls over and ask what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>he actually helps</p>
<p>barricade the bus door</p>
<p>because Vince was trying to escape</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s there just making sure that</p>
<p>Vince does not get out</p>
<p>oh and by the way</p>
<p>when the bus was accident</p>
<p>or when they pulled over the police were called and</p>
<p>stuff so they&rsquo;re just kind of waiting for</p>
<p>police to show up</p>
<p>Vince inside</p>
<p>with tim&rsquo;s body he turns back and goes back to Tim</p>
<p>and he just continues to stab and attack him</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a Greyhound bus so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of windows and</p>
<p>stuff and everybody</p>
<p>standing on the outside all the passengers and whatnot</p>
<p>they could see into the bus so they</p>
<p>could see Vince</p>
<p>and like what he was doing</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>watching and</p>
<p>ugh I couldn&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>so then another Greyhound</p>
<p>bus that was</p>
<p>on the same</p>
<p>route and it was</p>
<p>carrying passenger</p>
<p>like their overload</p>
<p>so they see</p>
<p>the Greyhound bus is pulled over and</p>
<p>so they pull over the driver of that bus</p>
<p>his name is Bernie</p>
<p>and so Bernie was like okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try and go on the bus and see if Tim is still</p>
<p>alive can I help him</p>
<p>maybe I can do something</p>
<p>so Bernie decides to go into the bus</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s asking</p>
<p>Vince to stop</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s asking him why like why are you doing this but</p>
<p>Vince simply responded with quote</p>
<p>get emergency</p>
<p>and quote while continuing to stab</p>
<p>Tim now Bernie</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on this bus and he&rsquo;s yelling at</p>
<p>Vince to stop</p>
<p>right now the</p>
<p>whole time he&rsquo;s yelling at</p>
<p>Vince to stop he had like this</p>
<p>crazy look in</p>
<p>his eyes and he just like staring at Bernie like</p>
<p>fucking kill you and Bernie was just like oh shit</p>
<p>no and Bernie said that he didn&rsquo;t really look at Tim</p>
<p>at that moment because</p>
<p>you know when you see something like</p>
<p>maybe bad happening over there and</p>
<p>if you just don&rsquo;t look at it then it&rsquo;s like not real</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re like trying not to look at it cause</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna acknowledge it so you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not looking at it anyways</p>
<p>what he was saying is he didn&rsquo;t like look at him yet</p>
<p>cause he just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna lose it</p>
<p>and then Bernie says he finally</p>
<p>just like looks at Tim and he sees tim&rsquo;s body and like</p>
<p>Vince was cutting</p>
<p>deep into tim&rsquo;s body and just taking out</p>
<p>pieces of his flash</p>
<p>and then Bernie realized that</p>
<p>Vince was cutting</p>
<p>deep into tim&rsquo;s neck and he was beheading Tim</p>
<p>I think at that moment</p>
<p>you know Bernie</p>
<p>exited the bus</p>
<p>because he realized that there was really nothing they</p>
<p>could do at that</p>
<p>point to save Tim</p>
<p>he was sadly dead</p>
<p>so Bernie got off the bus</p>
<p>and they barricaded</p>
<p>the door again</p>
<p>Bernie then suggested to the bus driver</p>
<p>be best if we cut the</p>
<p>power on the bus so so Vince</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>start up the bus and</p>
<p>drive away so Bernie</p>
<p>engaged the</p>
<p>emergency immobilizer system</p>
<p>which makes the bus inoperable</p>
<p>so he can&rsquo;t take off</p>
<p>again at this</p>
<p>point they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still waiting for</p>
<p>authorities to show up</p>
<p>so then they see</p>
<p>Vince inside the bus</p>
<p>and they see him walking around</p>
<p>and he goes to the</p>
<p>front of the bus and he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>start the bus up</p>
<p>so he could take off</p>
<p>and then once</p>
<p>Vince realizes that he&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>stuck he starts to get really</p>
<p>really agitated he&rsquo;s growing very</p>
<p>frustrated so</p>
<p>Vince goes to like the</p>
<p>the door of the bus and he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to stab and cut his way out of the the door and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everybody well not everybody but like</p>
<p>the bus driver</p>
<p>and Chris the</p>
<p>truck driver</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all trying to like</p>
<p>make sure that</p>
<p>Vince does not get out of this</p>
<p>this door so at this</p>
<p>point Vince</p>
<p>accepts the fact that he is</p>
<p>trapped inside this bus</p>
<p>so they see him kind of give up on this door idea</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>goes back to what he was doing so he went back</p>
<p>and he continued to stab and mutilate</p>
<p>tim&rsquo;s body finally</p>
<p>at 9 pm emergency officials</p>
<p>arrived at the scene</p>
<p>corporal Harter</p>
<p>tried to talk to Vince</p>
<p>down from outside of the bus and he&rsquo;s pleading with him</p>
<p>to drop the knife</p>
<p>to come out</p>
<p>to throw the</p>
<p>knife out of the</p>
<p>small window of the bus</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>ended up bringing in</p>
<p>special negotiators and</p>
<p>a heavily armed tactical unit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to negotiate with Vince</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get him to</p>
<p>turn himself over</p>
<p>it said that</p>
<p>vinces his responses were very chaotic</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense the one</p>
<p>thing that they did make out was Vince</p>
<p>loudly said I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to stay on this bus forever</p>
<p>which is like okay</p>
<p>so again all the passengers and</p>
<p>stuff are like</p>
<p>standing on the side of the road</p>
<p>and you can see inside of the bus they</p>
<p>could see what</p>
<p>Vince was doing</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>watching Vince in there just</p>
<p>doing weird shit they</p>
<p>could see him</p>
<p>mutilating tim&rsquo;s body with scissors and a buck</p>
<p>knife Vince</p>
<p>would like pull</p>
<p>certain body parts and</p>
<p>organs out of tim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>again they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching they</p>
<p>could see I</p>
<p>think just Vince</p>
<p>want to put on a show or something</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>but Vince pulls</p>
<p>a body part out and then he like</p>
<p>smells it everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching that he smells it</p>
<p>and then he puts it in his mouth</p>
<p>and begins to eat it there were also reports that Vince</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>licking the</p>
<p>blood off of his hands and arms and then he</p>
<p>would just walk up and down the bus</p>
<p>aisle just like</p>
<p>carrying various</p>
<p>organs and body part</p>
<p>and he was like showing them off to the witnesses</p>
<p>before stuffing them into</p>
<p>garbage bags</p>
<p>like the small you know</p>
<p>chopping garbage bags</p>
<p>Vince then decides to pick up tim&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s carrying it back and forth</p>
<p>letting everyone see it</p>
<p>a lot of the witnesses were saying it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrific right</p>
<p>but you also can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>looking around 9 30 or 10 pm</p>
<p>the stranded</p>
<p>passengers finally were</p>
<p>taken and they were</p>
<p>transported to</p>
<p>be interviewed at</p>
<p>Brandon RCMP</p>
<p>Detachment which I</p>
<p>think means police department</p>
<p>you know I do a lot of researching for</p>
<p>these stories but I always forget</p>
<p>to Google the small</p>
<p>stuff that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like RCMP what is that I</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>googled that</p>
<p>the passengers are</p>
<p>taken to be questioned and</p>
<p>hear all their stories and what not trying to</p>
<p>understand the situation and what happened</p>
<p>July 31st 2008 at 1 20 am</p>
<p>this is hours</p>
<p>after the initial attack</p>
<p>Vince broke one of the back windows open</p>
<p>on the bus and he</p>
<p>threw out some belongings</p>
<p>along with the</p>
<p>knife and the</p>
<p>scissors that he was using</p>
<p>Vince then decided to jump out of the window and</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily turning himself in he was</p>
<p>gonna try and run for it</p>
<p>great plan Vince</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t work out he jumps out the windows</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>Vince is like</p>
<p>trying to resist arrest he&rsquo;s trying to get away</p>
<p>and of course like police use</p>
<p>their little taser</p>
<p>and they control the situation</p>
<p>the police were able to go onto the bus</p>
<p>and they just see a</p>
<p>horrific scene they see that there are</p>
<p>trash bags everywhere</p>
<p>and inside these</p>
<p>trash bags were like parts</p>
<p>of tim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>what he was doing with them</p>
<p>so they go up to tim&rsquo;s body and they see that</p>
<p>his ear his nose his tongue they were all missing from</p>
<p>from tim&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>where the fuck is that</p>
<p>they search</p>
<p>Vince and they find in his pockets</p>
<p>were tim&rsquo;s ears</p>
<p>nose and tongue</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what he was</p>
<p>gonna do with that and then</p>
<p>sadly tim&rsquo;s eyes and part of his heart</p>
<p>they were never</p>
<p>found or recovered</p>
<p>and they are</p>
<p>assumed that</p>
<p>Vince ate them</p>
<p>so then at 10 am</p>
<p>Greyhound representatives took</p>
<p>other passengers to</p>
<p>Walmart I think it is or it was like a</p>
<p>small store</p>
<p>I kind of saw both</p>
<p>but they took</p>
<p>some of the passengers</p>
<p>to the store</p>
<p>to replace the</p>
<p>clothing that they&rsquo;re wearing because they had</p>
<p>blood like on</p>
<p>their shirts and whatnot</p>
<p>they let them get some items to her</p>
<p>to replace the bloody</p>
<p>clothes and then they sent the passengers</p>
<p>on another bus to head back to Winnipeg</p>
<p>so they could go home</p>
<p>Vince his trial was on</p>
<p>March 3rd 2009</p>
<p>Vince was pleading</p>
<p>not criminally responsible</p>
<p>now this means</p>
<p>hold on not</p>
<p>criminally responsible so this means that he accepted</p>
<p>the offense</p>
<p>occurred he&rsquo;s like yeah that shit happened</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully there mentally</p>
<p>so technically wasn&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>so Vince would go on to say that</p>
<p>he got on the bus</p>
<p>right and he sat in the</p>
<p>front and then</p>
<p>there were voices</p>
<p>in his head that were telling him he was in danger</p>
<p>Vince said he sat next to Tim</p>
<p>Tim smiled at him</p>
<p>and asked how he was doing and</p>
<p>Vince said he heard the</p>
<p>voice of God telling him that he had to kill Tim or</p>
<p>he would die immediately</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>part that pisses off a lot of people I mean it pisses</p>
<p>it pissed me off too okay</p>
<p>so Vince was</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>second degree murder</p>
<p>but ended up being</p>
<p>found not criminally</p>
<p>responsible because he was diagnosed with</p>
<p>schizophrenia</p>
<p>and he failed to take his</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>so Vince was</p>
<p>required to be held at a mental hospital</p>
<p>get the help that he needs</p>
<p>and then after</p>
<p>a few years he</p>
<p>ended up being</p>
<p>fully discharged</p>
<p>fully discharged and this</p>
<p>caused a lot of debate for obvious reasons</p>
<p>some people I</p>
<p>wanna say like 90</p>
<p>of people believe that</p>
<p>Vince should have been held accountable for the murder</p>
<p>due to its brutality</p>
<p>and then others believe that he</p>
<p>should be forgiven due to his</p>
<p>mental illness</p>
<p>so really quick like my own personal opinion</p>
<p>where I totally support the</p>
<p>idea that if you were suffering from a mental illness</p>
<p>and you commit a</p>
<p>crime that yeah I like the idea that</p>
<p>you get help</p>
<p>versus just being locked up and like</p>
<p>the keys just thrown away</p>
<p>right like out here in America</p>
<p>you just get locked up forever</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>system forever because you can&rsquo;t ever get out hot mess</p>
<p>and in Canada</p>
<p>it seems like they&rsquo;re always trying to help the people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just trying to lock them up forever they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>truly help people but</p>
<p>I feel like</p>
<p>in some cases like with this one it&rsquo;s not like he</p>
<p>stabbed him one time and it was like not that</p>
<p>stabbing him one time</p>
<p>would be better but</p>
<p>Vince full on</p>
<p>chop this guy&rsquo;s head off and was like</p>
<p>carrying it around like</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>no it should be case by case I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite understand</p>
<p>why they yeah mm hmm</p>
<p>no and then in February of 2016</p>
<p>Vince ended up legally changing his name to Will</p>
<p>Baker and he left his</p>
<p>group home and is living independently</p>
<p>people who work closely with Vince they say that</p>
<p>he feels great remorse and that like he&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>as long as he&rsquo;s getting the help that he needs</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t just one victim</p>
<p>all of the passengers on that bus</p>
<p>have suffered in some kind of way</p>
<p>sadly this awful murder had lasting</p>
<p>effects on those who were a witness</p>
<p>one of the passengers who gave birth a couple years</p>
<p>later she suffered from PTSD</p>
<p>that occurred from witnessing the attack</p>
<p>this affected her ability to</p>
<p>raise her child who had been</p>
<p>taken from her and placed in foster care for 18</p>
<p>months before being returned to her</p>
<p>another the truck driver Chris</p>
<p>he is the one who tried to stop and help</p>
<p>he also came forward and said he struggled from PTSD</p>
<p>from what he witnessed</p>
<p>he says he became an alcoholic</p>
<p>after the event because he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep at night from all the</p>
<p>nightmares there was another witness who actually</p>
<p>tried to file a lawsuit</p>
<p>against Greyhound the police</p>
<p>and Vince and it was later</p>
<p>dropped but she goes on to say it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>because officials were so lenient with Vince</p>
<p>and his mental illness trying to help</p>
<p>Vince to get better</p>
<p>but nobody has offered</p>
<p>help for the people that suffer from PTSD and suffer</p>
<p>daily where&rsquo;s their help</p>
<p>and for that</p>
<p>Vince shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>out because</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s their help get them help</p>
<p>the list goes on almost</p>
<p>every single passenger</p>
<p>on that bus has suffered from PTSD in some way whether</p>
<p>they were able to get help or not</p>
<p>greyhound has</p>
<p>never offered any type of help for them</p>
<p>the only type of help</p>
<p>they did offer</p>
<p>was compensation for the reimbursement of clothing</p>
<p>or any items that may have gotten</p>
<p>stained with</p>
<p>blood but other than that</p>
<p>that was about it</p>
<p>so on December 21st</p>
<p>2008 this is 5</p>
<p>months after the murder</p>
<p>tim&rsquo;s girlfriend</p>
<p>Colleen remember Colleen</p>
<p>she was pregnant with tim&rsquo;s son</p>
<p>she ends up giving</p>
<p>birth sadly</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>messy custody battle between</p>
<p>tim&rsquo;s family and</p>
<p>Colleen that</p>
<p>started in 2009</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly</p>
<p>like what the case</p>
<p>was why they felt like she was unfit but regardless</p>
<p>and 2016 tim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother and her husband were</p>
<p>granted full</p>
<p>guardianship of tim&rsquo;s son</p>
<p>according to Global</p>
<p>News Vince was most recently in a secondary</p>
<p>training program in hopes</p>
<p>to enter the career fields</p>
<p>so that is the</p>
<p>tragic story</p>
<p>about Tim Mcclain</p>
<p>he just got to walk free</p>
<p>tough kind of</p>
<p>horseshit is</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t getting help and he needs help and he</p>
<p>should get that in prison but he needs to be in prison</p>
<p>and he needs</p>
<p>to be held accountable for what he did he took a life</p>
<p>whether you were there</p>
<p>mentally or not you</p>
<p>still did it he</p>
<p>still did it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly unfortunate because all of the</p>
<p>victims on that bus</p>
<p>tim&rsquo;s family they</p>
<p>they are carrying this</p>
<p>heavy thing that happened to them and</p>
<p>knowing that the person responsible for this</p>
<p>is out there</p>
<p>living their life</p>
<p>changed their name</p>
<p>trying to get a career</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure in Canada</p>
<p>how the law works can somebody be retried for a case</p>
<p>is that something that can happen</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>um but if it&rsquo;s possible I really hope justice can</p>
<p>happen for tim&rsquo;s family and for all of the</p>
<p>victims who are affected</p>
<p>I would love to hear your guys</p>
<p>thoughts down</p>
<p>below do you believe Vince</p>
<p>should be in prison</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>would love to hear as well I guess</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it thank you so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today I hope that you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>be safe out there</p>
<p>okay rest in</p>
<p>peace to Tim Mcclain</p>
<p>and I really hope his family</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>victims can get some kind of peace</p>
<p>and healing let me know</p>
<p>who you would like me to talk</p>
<p>about next week but</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day today</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
