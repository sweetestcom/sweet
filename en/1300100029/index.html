    <p>bam ladies and gentlemen day 27</p>
<p>so it is right</p>
<p>yeah week twenty seven or podcast twenty</p>
<p>seven right we did two in a week once yeah</p>
<p>that was a crazy week</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen welcome once again to the</p>
<p>weekly you stream podcast</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s been fucking weekly man actually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>twenty nine we&rsquo;re way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re way late</p>
<p>podcast twenty nine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that we kept kept with it for this long</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s also amazing that i</p>
<p>never did anything like this before</p>
<p>it is you know</p>
<p>it takes me so long</p>
<p>to get into a</p>
<p>groove with anything it took me so long to accept like</p>
<p>email lists and myspace and all that shit</p>
<p>like for the</p>
<p>longest time i was like i don&rsquo;t want to get involved in</p>
<p>promoting myself fuck that</p>
<p>you know fuck</p>
<p>advertising shows just get on the</p>
<p>radio and just do it like normal</p>
<p>but then you see all these</p>
<p>other dudes that are doing it that way and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing so well with it what happened to your shit i</p>
<p>think myspace is the</p>
<p>first one that actually went crazy</p>
<p>that made you realize the</p>
<p>power of the internet like flashlight</p>
<p>well the myspace days that was the comedy</p>
<p>store days and we were using the</p>
<p>when we were</p>
<p>using the myspace</p>
<p>fucking comic</p>
<p>store were sold out like</p>
<p>every weekend</p>
<p>and it was just because of myspace</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know before then man you</p>
<p>could never have like</p>
<p>they would have to</p>
<p>drive by and</p>
<p>just know that you&rsquo;re there because of the billboard or</p>
<p>just know that you&rsquo;re there because of word of mouth</p>
<p>but you know we could</p>
<p>throw it up on myspace it was nothing now</p>
<p>or a schoolyard of</p>
<p>paper boys going</p>
<p>mister mister myspace</p>
<p>myspace is a fucking dinosaur</p>
<p>you know why</p>
<p>cause myspace didn&rsquo;t adapt</p>
<p>i logged in last night</p>
<p>the first time in i</p>
<p>think like two</p>
<p>months checked</p>
<p>went through</p>
<p>three or four pages of people that were fake</p>
<p>people asking me to talk and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>one new person going</p>
<p>hey dude here&rsquo;s my facebook page add me</p>
<p>yeah every now and then i&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>and read a little bit of the fan mail but it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>worth it it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>graveyard it&rsquo;s like you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>going to chernobyl</p>
<p>after the blast</p>
<p>and like talking to people that are</p>
<p>still there like god man get out of here why</p>
<p>are you here</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>using myspace for</p>
<p>pat and oswald use myspace</p>
<p>still though</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen before we get going</p>
<p>our podcast is sponsored by the</p>
<p>flashlight i show it</p>
<p>every week and i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i feel like one of barker&rsquo;s beauties i&rsquo;m supposed to be</p>
<p>demonstrating the product but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>is basically a masturbation tool if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t used it before</p>
<p>we talk about it every week</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking fantastic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s far as</p>
<p>beating off if you beat off and i know you do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better than just regular beating off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that much</p>
<p>money how much is the</p>
<p>money does it cost</p>
<p>brian it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t know but you get 15</p>
<p>off your if you go on your way you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how much at all i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like 69 59</p>
<p>i did your tip though</p>
<p>this week and it&rsquo;s kind of of course a</p>
<p>crazy thing happened</p>
<p>every time i do anything with a flashlight some crazy</p>
<p>warm water thing no i put it outside and</p>
<p>they let it heat up</p>
<p>of course my landlords</p>
<p>often go out in the back to smoke</p>
<p>and because they work</p>
<p>above me and</p>
<p>and they see this rubber</p>
<p>pussy out in the sun they saw it out in the sun</p>
<p>oh my god because</p>
<p>when i went to pick it up they were sitting out there</p>
<p>this if you go to the</p>
<p>flashlight says this website contains explicit</p>
<p>adult material</p>
<p>what how crazy</p>
<p>is it that you go to a website that has rubber pussies</p>
<p>and they have this</p>
<p>crazy fucking warning you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to see explicit</p>
<p>adult material</p>
<p>i mean do they have porn on their site</p>
<p>okay they have a guy and a girl</p>
<p>not even nudity</p>
<p>those girls have clothes on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>and a girl in bed but the girl had a bra and panties on</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re looking at all these</p>
<p>flashlights man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay yeah it&rsquo;s rubber body part</p>
<p>is that really</p>
<p>like something you need to have a little warning to</p>
<p>click through</p>
<p>you know those sites</p>
<p>where you see violence</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t see shit</p>
<p>like that yeah why can you just walk into a hustler</p>
<p>store without them stopping and telling you the same</p>
<p>thing so a lot of hustler</p>
<p>stores out there in the</p>
<p>world is there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s stories just like it</p>
<p>like porn stores that is one of</p>
<p>those weird</p>
<p>things when we go on the road</p>
<p>and we see these</p>
<p>fucking towns like you know like</p>
<p>if you go to like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good example of one that had a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>youngstown ohio</p>
<p>i was doing chosen</p>
<p>youngstown ohio and it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of those</p>
<p>little sad 24 hour neon lit</p>
<p>adult shops and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s just people that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>reluctant body maintenance</p>
<p>like poor sad fucks and those</p>
<p>places just wandering around looking depressed</p>
<p>pushing those beads</p>
<p>apart it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why do they have to use beads beads make fucking</p>
<p>noise right</p>
<p>when you push</p>
<p>those beads</p>
<p>apart and they</p>
<p>click and you go back into the</p>
<p>dirty dirty area</p>
<p>see all the</p>
<p>cock sucking</p>
<p>videos and shit</p>
<p>i used to work at a video</p>
<p>store that had an</p>
<p>adult room and it was open</p>
<p>24 hours a day</p>
<p>and it was kind of cool because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d walk you know somebody be walking up like a hot</p>
<p>chick and you&rsquo;re like please let them go in the</p>
<p>adult room you</p>
<p>know of course they just walk up and goes</p>
<p>you know words</p>
<p>to designing women</p>
<p>season two you know or something</p>
<p>but adult room</p>
<p>the craziest</p>
<p>thing happened is</p>
<p>an old teacher of mine</p>
<p>first grade</p>
<p>teacher went in there a</p>
<p>woman and got</p>
<p>porn and i could only hope it was for like a</p>
<p>party you saw her yes</p>
<p>i waited on</p>
<p>her she probably didn&rsquo;t recognize me because</p>
<p>i was like 20</p>
<p>and she was like</p>
<p>you know older lady so this is your</p>
<p>first grade</p>
<p>teacher yeah</p>
<p>first grade</p>
<p>teacher wow</p>
<p>so first grade is what seven six</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>six i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>something like that</p>
<p>and because i rang</p>
<p>her up i also saw her last name was like miss ba ba ba</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like oh that&rsquo;s totally her</p>
<p>anyway she got the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>sylvester stallone did a porn called</p>
<p>the italian</p>
<p>stallion and that&rsquo;s what she had got</p>
<p>and so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was real porn though</p>
<p>i think it was one of</p>
<p>those like showtime</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>in the morning porns</p>
<p>right so i think that i</p>
<p>thought like oh this is for a gag this for a</p>
<p>party i accept this</p>
<p>but see i could also see her</p>
<p>whole history</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>big black dick five you</p>
<p>know it was like</p>
<p>really only rented porn</p>
<p>wow sixty eight</p>
<p>seventy maybe she</p>
<p>was seventy</p>
<p>that bitch is a</p>
<p>freak that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy just keeping it</p>
<p>alive huh yeah</p>
<p>woo so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that italian</p>
<p>stallion was a real porn i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i never watched</p>
<p>it talking out of my ass but i&rsquo;m pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure it was like some fake</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>in the morning shit we had it the porn side</p>
<p>i saw a chick</p>
<p>that i used to date in one of</p>
<p>those fake three o&rsquo;clock in the morning porns</p>
<p>where a dude was fake boning her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like to do just a little too low</p>
<p>right like she</p>
<p>was like a pie a little too high and who you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you tell her they&rsquo;re growing is it really touching</p>
<p>right one of</p>
<p>those you know</p>
<p>i know it was really freaky</p>
<p>i was by myself and i&rsquo;ll slip through the channels</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like whoa here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a person that you know</p>
<p>i hadn&rsquo;t seen her</p>
<p>he is a long time ago</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i dated her over you know</p>
<p>twelve years ago thirteen fourteen years ago even</p>
<p>so seeing her it was like wow</p>
<p>this is kind of strange like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching someone</p>
<p>that i used to know and then they&rsquo;re fucking in a</p>
<p>movie even though it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>you know what do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like if you like your high school</p>
<p>sweetheart turns into like</p>
<p>sasha gray or something like that i</p>
<p>could tell you</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like i know what it&rsquo;s like it fucking it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird man i don&rsquo;t even like</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>no no no you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like because in your situation the person that</p>
<p>if any person we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is an actual real person right</p>
<p>these are people that</p>
<p>you met when you knew that they already did that thing</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>thing to have a girl</p>
<p>have it be your girlfriend</p>
<p>this is my girl</p>
<p>i check and then there&rsquo;s some fucking brute just</p>
<p>doggy styling her yeah and</p>
<p>sweating and spitting on her and shit oh you fucking</p>
<p>bitch you like that you like whoa</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s fucking the shit out of my ex</p>

<p>like using i&rsquo;ve always been sad like my</p>
<p>whole life i</p>
<p>always thought that was like one of the weakest</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>when someone</p>
<p>you can tell the only reason why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing this up or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about their ex is to try to fuck with your head</p>
<p>like it never works</p>
<p>all that it makes you</p>
<p>feel uncomfortable but the uncomfort that i feel is oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not as cool as i thought you were</p>
<p>and yeah now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creepy and you&rsquo;re trying to fuck with me and</p>
<p>okay can i talk you out of this can</p>
<p>i tell you that this is not necessary and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>you know two people that</p>
<p>are enjoying each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s company getting to know each</p>
<p>other you know we don&rsquo;t have to play any</p>
<p>stupid games that we&rsquo;ve already played in the past we</p>
<p>should all learn right</p>
<p>right i played some</p>
<p>stupid games when i was a little kid</p>
<p>you know i had to</p>
<p>learn that they&rsquo;re dumb</p>
<p>so when someone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that games like that</p>
<p>are dumb like jealousy games from like fucking really</p>
<p>you know come on man</p>
<p>what am i fucking child</p>
<p>cut the shit</p>
<p>so another guy fucked you you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy get out of here</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hot and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>twenty six and another guy&rsquo;s fucked you already</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>was this recent was this with</p>
<p>that bitch is probably sucking somebody&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>an hour before she picked you up</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s fucking crazy</p>
<p>it makes me wonder if that shit ever goes away cause it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like it is like</p>
<p>does my mom get in a</p>
<p>fight with her boyfriend and just do</p>
<p>stupid shit like that</p>
<p>it goes away for sure it goes away</p>
<p>when with maturity</p>
<p>everything evolves</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the problem is when people get</p>
<p>they go from one shit</p>
<p>relationship to the next shit relationship and they</p>
<p>never get traction</p>
<p>as a human being</p>
<p>never get traction and</p>
<p>never realize</p>
<p>and if you have shit friends on top of that</p>
<p>which a lot of girls do man</p>
<p>especially pretty girls a lot of pretty girls</p>
<p>their friends be hating</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tough man because for them it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out with a pretty girl if you&rsquo;re a girl</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re out with a pretty girl no one is</p>
<p>gonna pay attention to you everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pay attention</p>
<p>to her and she didn&rsquo;t even do anything to deserve this</p>
<p>she was just born this way</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re so much funnier</p>
<p>and so much cooler and you&rsquo;d be so much better</p>
<p>girlfriend and you you will get</p>
<p>crazy for that</p>
<p>bitch and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try to trip her up you&rsquo;ll want her to fail</p>
<p>your hope she falls and</p>
<p>breaks her fucking nose you know</p>
<p>like literally like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stealing from you</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s stealing male attention from you</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s how a lot of</p>
<p>chicks feel</p>
<p>about hot chicks man</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like it so</p>
<p>anything like that man if that if that&rsquo;s your situation</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re around people like that they&rsquo;re douchey to</p>
<p>you and you around ex boyfriends who are douchey to you</p>
<p>you just you can get into a bad</p>
<p>grind where you just automatically get douchey</p>
<p>first cause you</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get douchey</p>
<p>first and you</p>
<p>wanna get the upper hand</p>
<p>you know you ever get in those</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>where you could</p>
<p>tell that someone&rsquo;s fucking with you just to get the</p>
<p>upper hand and oh yeah</p>
<p>expecting more</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s so annoying what</p>
<p>worse is when you go with it</p>
<p>just to see</p>
<p>where it goes</p>
<p>the worst for me is if i get involved in it and i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been working out</p>
<p>especially when i was younger</p>
<p>dude when i was younger i did not have</p>
<p>such a good</p>
<p>judgment and i</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t sometimes</p>
<p>about when to</p>
<p>argue and when to just go</p>
<p>without fuck am i arguing over</p>
<p>back then i</p>
<p>just argued automatically i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna stop me from arguing fuck you and it</p>
<p>would just turn ugly</p>
<p>every time every time i got an argument with somebody</p>
<p>would turn ugly</p>
<p>but as i got older</p>
<p>you know any kind</p>
<p>of relationship like that when shit comes up now i just</p>
<p>i try very very hard now to just look at it and go</p>
<p>what is the purpose of all this</p>
<p>who gives a shit if you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>who gives a shit if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong who gives</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i want</p>
<p>i want to be around people that i</p>
<p>enjoy talking to and i know</p>
<p>there can&rsquo;t really be this many problems that we</p>
<p>fight all the time</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s this many problems that we</p>
<p>fight all the time</p>
<p>where is that coming from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be a personality</p>
<p>thing cause i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that many problems in my life my life&rsquo;s pretty smooth</p>
<p>most of the people in</p>
<p>my life are very nice</p>
<p>most of the people in my life</p>
<p>we enjoy each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s companies</p>
<p>very few this</p>
<p>i mean everybody has like</p>
<p>here and there there&rsquo;ll be issues with any</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>where someone</p>
<p>sees something totally differently but you</p>
<p>can talk it through and if you&rsquo;re really good friends</p>
<p>you work it out and</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s cool and nobody ever gets ugly</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>the real keyman is finding</p>
<p>other people that go</p>
<p>along with that because as soon as you go with someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s used to douchey shit</p>
<p>and is used to insulting you</p>
<p>and is used</p>
<p>to playing games as soon as you go into that</p>
<p>and dive into that world man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>no progress</p>
<p>yeah no fun</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s so hard to get out of it so hard</p>
<p>and then once you get out of it you&rsquo;re so sad because</p>
<p>you got out of it you have to get back in it just</p>
<p>cause you felt</p>
<p>so sad for getting out of that well being</p>
<p>alone man when</p>
<p>you just got out of a relationship and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alone and lonely</p>
<p>those are the darkest</p>
<p>emptiest most hollow moments as an</p>
<p>adult human being</p>
<p>that feeling is a terrible terrible feeling</p>
<p>most people just aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>equipped to</p>
<p>understand rationally what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on like why are you so</p>
<p>upset how much of this is just</p>
<p>evolutionary</p>
<p>how much is this it&rsquo;s been designed into the whole</p>
<p>human mechanism</p>
<p>to feel dreadful</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re left</p>
<p>alone to feel terrible</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re rejected</p>
<p>being rejected</p>
<p>by someone you don&rsquo;t even know is brutally painful</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>why would you even care</p>
<p>if it was a dude who didn&rsquo;t like you</p>
<p>if you had no desire</p>
<p>to fuck that person if you just came up to a dude and</p>
<p>dude was like look at you you&rsquo;re not even good looking</p>
<p>be like what fuck you faggot</p>
<p>you know you like</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t care at all</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t change your opinion of yourself at all</p>
<p>but when a chick does it to you it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>devastating</p>
<p>oh totally especially if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chick that you&rsquo;re attracted to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all but it&rsquo;s all evolution</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all set up that way</p>
<p>to try to get you to be as</p>
<p>attractive as possible</p>
<p>and to make very stringent standards</p>
<p>at what people find and don&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>attraction attractive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to make you operate at a higher level</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s all just</p>
<p>designed to make you work harder as a</p>
<p>human being to become more</p>
<p>impressive as a mate</p>
<p>and in doing so and in</p>
<p>becoming more</p>
<p>impressive as a mate you get to</p>
<p>contribute more to society you&rsquo;ll create more energy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll create more money</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll create more whatever you do whether you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>technology you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>innovate more if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>art you produce more art</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>prove your worth</p>
<p>and so that that craziness like</p>
<p>allows people to</p>
<p>shine you know</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t find that girl though you know</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t find that partner was on the same</p>
<p>level as me it seems like they</p>
<p>always act like the same</p>
<p>level but then once you get into it</p>
<p>they were just</p>
<p>like kind of</p>
<p>mimicking what they thought that</p>
<p>level it is that</p>
<p>too but it&rsquo;s also that</p>
<p>they want you to be something that you&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know they want you to be not even a real person you</p>
<p>know they have this</p>
<p>a lot of people have an idea in</p>
<p>their head that&rsquo;s really almost kind of</p>
<p>based on movies</p>
<p>you know what was it like before the 1800s</p>
<p>based on movies totally better</p>
<p>yeah everybody but that&rsquo;s how it is</p>
<p>you see movies and</p>
<p>everything works out fucking awesome in the</p>
<p>movies and you go well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what life is like</p>
<p>right life is like this</p>
<p>this is my model of life</p>
<p>sandra bullock</p>
<p>movies you get</p>
<p>trapped in your head</p>
<p>thinking well</p>
<p>maybe this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s not the one</p>
<p>maybe there is another one</p>
<p>god damn what is this crazy</p>
<p>what about you are you the one</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re probably not the one</p>
<p>it might be you</p>
<p>the fucking problem</p>
<p>might be you over and over again</p>
<p>with everybody it&rsquo;s kind of like the</p>
<p>fight club relationship</p>
<p>where the whole time it actually is you you</p>
<p>know yeah right</p>
<p>well dude i&rsquo;ve been that guy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve totally been that guy</p>
<p>start arguments and relationships for no reason</p>
<p>just cause i was</p>
<p>frustrated with my own life</p>
<p>especially when i was really</p>
<p>young like i was like 20</p>
<p>when i was like 20 and 21</p>
<p>i would start</p>
<p>stupid arguments with girls i was dating over nothing</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>them that was the problem</p>
<p>it was really me</p>
<p>it was really me like being</p>
<p>frustrated all the time with my life</p>
<p>trying to like being like</p>
<p>hyper ambitious and trying to like get</p>
<p>ahead in my life but really</p>
<p>terrified that i was</p>
<p>gonna be a loser</p>
<p>so i would you know always be like</p>
<p>under stress and if you</p>
<p>anything annoyed me</p>
<p>about a check i</p>
<p>would like been</p>
<p>like why do you even talk like that</p>
<p>meanwhile that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a douchey</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>to take your frustrations out on someone else</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrapped up in it man</p>
<p>especially if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like everyone in your family that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everyone you&rsquo;re friends with</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the only way you know it takes a long time to</p>
<p>learn to not communicate shitty to people</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>in like a shitty communication pattern</p>
<p>fuck that&rsquo;s hard to snap out of man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>very hard to recognize how</p>
<p>other people are seeing you like so many people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that they come off as assholes</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re just playing around and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh this guy&rsquo;s such a douche get him away from me</p>
<p>so what do you fuck you can&rsquo;t take a joke</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a joke if i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not a joke if no one else is</p>
<p>laughing but you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a joke that&rsquo;s you being a douchebag and laughing</p>
<p>about being a douchebag</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>brian how do we fix the</p>
<p>world definitely</p>
<p>not alcohol because it seems like more</p>
<p>fake the anti fixture</p>
<p>vegas really</p>
<p>taught me a lot</p>
<p>about alcohol you know like just</p>
<p>just seeing</p>
<p>people in alcohol is just</p>
<p>weird alcohols</p>
<p>it does terrible</p>
<p>things for your judgment i</p>
<p>enjoyed myself so much more saturday</p>
<p>night i had</p>
<p>water drank</p>
<p>water all night we went to that party</p>
<p>smoked a little weed</p>
<p>it was fun you know</p>
<p>the problem with alcohol is everybody else is</p>
<p>drinking too</p>
<p>wind up getting in</p>
<p>stupid conversations over nothing and</p>
<p>we got to hang out with doug benson</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>really even talked</p>
<p>to him before you know i&rsquo;ve seen him a couple times</p>
<p>but hanging out with doug benson</p>
<p>stoned with a couple beers in us</p>
<p>fucking had</p>
<p>dance off with him for what two</p>
<p>hours me him</p>
<p>me and him were dancing i mean</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>never fucking did he&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>dude we really</p>
<p>enjoyed hanging out with him he&rsquo;s a real good dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never really i&rsquo;ve done his podcast before you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;ve seen him like</p>
<p>here and there clubs i talk to him</p>
<p>every now and then but this is the most time i ever</p>
<p>spent with him by far</p>
<p>who went to dinner with him and</p>
<p>talked to him a lot he&rsquo;s just cool man</p>
<p>really cool guy and</p>
<p>you know i always questioned how much he really</p>
<p>enjoyed pot and i will</p>
<p>never question his</p>
<p>hot likeness</p>
<p>again he fucking</p>
<p>questioned it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so funny the</p>
<p>stoners are always doing that he ain&rsquo;t legit</p>
<p>yeah you know why</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve totally felt for something that happens to you</p>
<p>every day almost is where</p>
<p>you go up to him like dude come on</p>
<p>smoke weed you want to</p>
<p>smoke a joint</p>
<p>right but i mean it&rsquo;s also like you know</p>
<p>hanging out with</p>
<p>other comics and stuff</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little different but</p>
<p>still that happens to me how</p>
<p>often every day</p>
<p>every time we&rsquo;re out at a club</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>every time everywhere and like you don&rsquo;t know who</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>are right like they could have</p>
<p>crazy shit in</p>
<p>their weed dude</p>
<p>like a gyrogan</p>
<p>eye on acid</p>
<p>and i gotta</p>
<p>drive home and you know</p>
<p>double rainbow</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about double rainbow look up double rainbow on youtube</p>
<p>have you seen the</p>
<p>remix yet no i don&rsquo;t want to see the</p>
<p>remix oh no no i just i saw by</p>
<p>too much i even watch the whole video</p>
<p>i watched like half of the</p>
<p>video and i shut it off i get it i get it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking out over rainbows</p>
<p>the remix they did the robot</p>
<p>voice what you know with the</p>
<p>voice and they edit it real</p>
<p>quick kind of like</p>
<p>oh eric tune</p>
<p>and they edit like tim and eric</p>
<p>style that auto</p>
<p>tune shit catch on what the fuck happened i got</p>
<p>t pain on my iphone</p>
<p>do you yeah</p>
<p>do you like that</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kinda cool just</p>
<p>like singing something that you thought of</p>
<p>and then just</p>
<p>changing the lyrics and next thing you know you</p>
<p>could actually make it into a real song</p>
<p>like even if it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going hey dad</p>
<p>that song that</p>
<p>drake song it&rsquo;s over does he use that shit auto tune</p>
<p>cause i kinda like that song dude i</p>
<p>think everyone uses auto tune</p>
<p>in the pop industry right now</p>
<p>the pop industry like</p>
<p>lindsay lohan should be using pot</p>
<p>the potter to a</p>
<p>lot lindsey&rsquo;s gonna do some time now huh yeah</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t know ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>brian says where&rsquo;d you read this off of i</p>
<p>watched it live on cbs live</p>
<p>you know they put it on video</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve courtroom</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna do 90 days in jail that is</p>
<p>crazy she has to turn herself in two weeks</p>
<p>unless she suicides but she</p>
<p>still has to wear</p>
<p>the bracelet</p>
<p>so she can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink every</p>
<p>day and they made it like a big deal like we want to</p>
<p>switch to a</p>
<p>blood a blood</p>
<p>thing instead of you know the scram</p>
<p>and the reason why she wants to do that because if you</p>
<p>drink alcohol at midnight</p>
<p>like by 4 a</p>
<p>m it&rsquo;s not in your</p>
<p>blood anymore</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why lindsay wants to do that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s so funny that</p>
<p>the thing that really got to me was</p>
<p>where the judge like</p>
<p>heard lindsay crying and</p>
<p>stuff and the</p>
<p>judge finally goes</p>
<p>all right you</p>
<p>did lied here you lied here you lied here you lied here</p>
<p>next case you lied here you lied here you</p>
<p>went through like four cases of like</p>
<p>seven i don&rsquo;t know if locking someone</p>
<p>up in jail is like the best way to deal with this but</p>
<p>this should all be a bright example to people</p>
<p>really a prominent example to</p>
<p>people how you shouldn&rsquo;t make your fucking kids famous</p>
<p>how many kids</p>
<p>have to become</p>
<p>incredibly fucked up</p>
<p>from being famous</p>
<p>child actors</p>
<p>before we look at it and go</p>
<p>this is nuts there&rsquo;s no way you</p>
<p>should be doing that to a</p>
<p>child there&rsquo;s no way you should be</p>
<p>developing as a</p>
<p>human being getting your shit together</p>
<p>getting your ego together is hard enough as it is</p>
<p>but to have that developing and</p>
<p>getting your shit together and then mix it with fame</p>
<p>dude can you imagine like 10 years from now will</p>
<p>smith&rsquo;s kids</p>
<p>gonna jump on your back and</p>
<p>slice their necks</p>
<p>i know he&rsquo;s probably just</p>
<p>gonna be sad or who knows man will is a</p>
<p>really brilliant guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>smart guy he</p>
<p>might figure out a way to</p>
<p>raise his kid correctly through this but</p>
<p>what an incredible fucking chore</p>
<p>and what an incredible responsibility and</p>
<p>the amount of pressure you put on the kid because</p>
<p>kids you know</p>
<p>they can get</p>
<p>spoiled so easy</p>
<p>their perspective can get fucked up so</p>
<p>quickly they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really developed character</p>
<p>and to have a kid really be in a position where he</p>
<p>never really has</p>
<p>to overcome the same adversity that the rest of us have</p>
<p>he just doesn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>opportunity to develop the character that the rest of</p>
<p>us are going to have</p>
<p>the regular</p>
<p>people that have to go through life and make</p>
<p>their way as an adult and</p>
<p>evolve as an</p>
<p>adult and be an</p>
<p>adult without</p>
<p>money where you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like wow i</p>
<p>gotta figure out a way</p>
<p>to get through this and</p>
<p>to not have any fame whatsoever</p>
<p>you have to get by on your</p>
<p>personality instead of get by on the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>famous when you were six i</p>
<p>heard that the first</p>
<p>eight years of your life you learn 88</p>
<p>of what makes you who you are today</p>
<p>the things like</p>
<p>from walking all the way to how you</p>
<p>react to certain</p>
<p>things and the rest</p>
<p>is what you have to deal with</p>
<p>ram almost right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve read some</p>
<p>stuff about it up to two years old</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t read up to</p>
<p>eight but it makes</p>
<p>sense i mean</p>
<p>a lot of who you are as a</p>
<p>human being is</p>
<p>based on what kind of</p>
<p>input you got when</p>
<p>your mind was developing</p>
<p>it only makes</p>
<p>sense your mind is</p>
<p>going to prepare for a certain world</p>
<p>you know they say that</p>
<p>babies born</p>
<p>into really high stress violent families</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>shouting and yelling and you know too many people like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a really</p>
<p>bad neighborhood and you know too many people in your</p>
<p>house there&rsquo;s a lot of stress all the time</p>
<p>babies born</p>
<p>literally are</p>
<p>wired different than</p>
<p>babies that are born into calm households</p>
<p>babies that are born into calm</p>
<p>households like</p>
<p>the less stress you have</p>
<p>the more chilled out the baby can be</p>
<p>but if you have like a really really</p>
<p>tense mom that kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out just</p>
<p>ready to snap</p>
<p>that kid&rsquo;s gonna come out recognizing danger</p>
<p>i had this long talk on a</p>
<p>plane with michael irvin</p>
<p>michael irvin</p>
<p>was on a plane to australia we were all</p>
<p>going to the ufc</p>
<p>he was going there to do some football</p>
<p>things russell crowe</p>
<p>and i had met him because i did best damn</p>
<p>sports show</p>
<p>period and he was</p>
<p>on it and he said real cool guy man and very down to</p>
<p>earth normal dude</p>
<p>and so he and i were talking and we&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>about kids getting involved in martial arts</p>
<p>and kids getting involved in</p>
<p>sports and he was talking</p>
<p>about like what he was like</p>
<p>when he was young</p>
<p>that you know he&rsquo;s trying to like</p>
<p>teach kids you know</p>
<p>about controlling themselves</p>
<p>teach kids about keeping</p>
<p>their shit together and this was</p>
<p>right after that dude that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the football player but he was chasing</p>
<p>after his girlfriend he jumped in the back of a</p>
<p>truck and he fell out and died</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the guy&rsquo;s name yeah</p>
<p>he was talking</p>
<p>about that guy that that guy that was not</p>
<p>thinking he was just</p>
<p>reacting like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you don&rsquo;t do shit like that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking but</p>
<p>these guys aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>thinking they just</p>
<p>react and he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>teach them how</p>
<p>to put some steps in there to</p>
<p>consider things</p>
<p>before you act and recognize that there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so quick to behave like that</p>
<p>and that these people</p>
<p>these reckless</p>
<p>type people</p>
<p>are the ones who are always involved in like really</p>
<p>strong competitive athletics like</p>
<p>fighting and football and shit like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re so much more quick to</p>
<p>react they&rsquo;re so much more explosive</p>
<p>and a lot of it is just stress based</p>
<p>we do so many</p>
<p>fighters are born from shitty</p>
<p>households so many</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s not a prerequisite</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys from</p>
<p>strong families that</p>
<p>still are great fighters</p>
<p>because they just accept that you</p>
<p>know they just love the challenge like george st</p>
<p>pierre is a perfect example of that very</p>
<p>close with his dad</p>
<p>but a lot of guys come from fucking broken homes man</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something in that there&rsquo;s something in that</p>
<p>the fury is just a little more intense</p>
<p>from a dude who grows up without a dad or a dude</p>
<p>who grows up in like a real shitty situation you know</p>
<p>fucking crazy man when you really stop and</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy that anybody would want</p>
<p>their kid to be</p>
<p>famous the lindsay lohan</p>
<p>thing this should be the last draw</p>
<p>yeah well there should be some kind of laws</p>
<p>about it definitely but i</p>
<p>think most of the people that have their kids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re broken</p>
<p>dreams and they&rsquo;re using their kids you know to</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s it or is just a lack of</p>
<p>awareness their lack of</p>
<p>real real consideration you see nobody</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s an offensive thing</p>
<p>like you know if you</p>
<p>if you tell them you know all my</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s acting she&rsquo;s in a commercial they</p>
<p>go oh good for you nobody ever goes wow what are you</p>
<p>doing like why are you putting your kid on tv nobody</p>
<p>nobody ever says that nobody ever says it like whoa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fuck your kid up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get your kid famous</p>
<p>you know what the odds are</p>
<p>if you got your kid</p>
<p>famous what are the odds your kids</p>
<p>gonna grow up and be a mess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ninety percent</p>
<p>why would you ever i mean yeah there&rsquo;s a few that get</p>
<p>through it and they&rsquo;re okay the jodie fosters of the</p>
<p>world that seem to be</p>
<p>adjusted but they&rsquo;re fucking rare dude</p>

<p>this is beautiful what a beautiful time to be alive</p>
<p>and the internet</p>
<p>if you have a question</p>
<p>he just throw that</p>
<p>bitch into google so simple</p>
<p>brian austin</p>
<p>green rapping we are</p>
<p>about to find out</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to go to the fucking library</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>you know go to a college and meet some experts</p>
<p>oh brian austin</p>
<p>okay that was on tv that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>no see that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think it is i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that he had it</p>
<p>was going to his wiki</p>
<p>a moment in rap history as that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>around the same time his character on 90210</p>
<p>david silver started rapping hmm</p>
<p>among his lyrical stylings</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so precious to me am i precious to you</p>
<p>the answer brian is yes</p>
<p>okay that was so pointless</p>
<p>we missed the very beginning of it it was</p>
<p>still pointless i think</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have his rapping i mean they had some of his</p>
<p>lyrics i think that they&rsquo;re just saying</p>
<p>that he was a rapper but it was wack but we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>play it because then we&rsquo;ll have to pay him something</p>
<p>oh really you know something like that that was on vh1</p>
<p>well they they were also saying that he&rsquo;s wack</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>quote his lyrics yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty wack</p>
<p>that sucks that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>those lyrics were so wack like you don&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>pass a judgment on them you just playing for people and</p>
<p>raise your eyeballs and go hmm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you ever see that</p>
<p>movie jesus camp</p>
<p>yeah crazy crazy fucking</p>
<p>movie and the best part</p>
<p>about the movie is they didn&rsquo;t cast any judgment</p>
<p>they just showed you</p>
<p>these nutty</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>that are out there raising kids to be christian</p>
<p>jihadists you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to cast anything and the people are so nutty</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll approve it you</p>
<p>could show them the fucking</p>
<p>video and they</p>
<p>would they would they</p>
<p>would say yeah that&rsquo;s our that&rsquo;s our message</p>
<p>you got our message down sir</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good documentary</p>
<p>meanwhile anybody saw that</p>
<p>thing was like a fucking horror movie</p>
<p>taking little kids and</p>
<p>the best part is when they make them talk in tongues</p>
<p>did you see that part</p>
<p>they would say everybody now talking tongues</p>
<p>so the kids would go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like god talking through them in tongues</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hilarious they&rsquo;re five years</p>
<p>old man five years old it&rsquo;s nonsense they love nonsense</p>
<p>five years old</p>
<p>love to talk nonsense all five year old kids do</p>
<p>so you give them like a time of the day at school</p>
<p>alright kids time to go nonsense</p>
<p>so they just go full fantasy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking in this made up language</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s obviously not a fucking language</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not saying anything</p>
<p>i can tell when i&rsquo;m listening</p>
<p>to someone talk even if they have a foreign language</p>
<p>i could tell if it&rsquo;s a real language</p>
<p>you know you hear someone talking in</p>
<p>chinese like they&rsquo;re saying a bunch of</p>
<p>crazy shit but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a flow to it</p>
<p>where you know they&rsquo;re not saying the same</p>
<p>sounds over and over and over and over again</p>
<p>which is what you do because</p>
<p>you have to invent all these</p>
<p>sounds on the fly if you&rsquo;re making a fake language</p>
<p>like to have them vary to the</p>
<p>point where it looks like it&rsquo;s like an actual</p>
<p>language that&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>so you start going</p>
<p>which is what they all do they&rsquo;re all uncreative fucks</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking in tongues and they&rsquo;re just making nonsense</p>
<p>noises that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re doing man</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting little kids to do this shit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>these kids that you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re warriors for christ and</p>
<p>this woman was comparing them to how</p>
<p>hamas and all these</p>
<p>terrorist organizations raised little</p>
<p>jihadists she was</p>
<p>literally comparing them</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s comparing them</p>
<p>like why don&rsquo;t we do that with christianity like this</p>
<p>would be a good thing</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>wanna blow themselves up is cause</p>
<p>they indoctrinated them into the</p>
<p>world of radical</p>
<p>islam we can do the same</p>
<p>thing but for good</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like but we&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>not seeing the irony</p>
<p>you know in the</p>
<p>brainwashing kids she&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>brainwashed</p>
<p>with the wrong</p>
<p>thing but if we</p>
<p>brainwash our kids with the</p>
<p>truth and jesus and like whoa</p>
<p>joe how to raise kids i had two guys</p>
<p>knock on my door</p>
<p>today that were both my age</p>
<p>dressed up in the white</p>
<p>shirts and the</p>
<p>ties and stuff like that is that a</p>
<p>scientology or a mormon</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s a mormon</p>
<p>right mormons i just i</p>
<p>laugh mormons are some of the nicest</p>
<p>fucking people</p>
<p>i have to tell</p>
<p>you it might be but they&rsquo;re so nice but</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>laughing at them you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>ridiculous the</p>
<p>whole look it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>ridiculous though it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>you know being a</p>
<p>muslim isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ridiculous but being a jew is</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>being a catholic</p>
<p>is ridiculous being a</p>
<p>protestant is</p>
<p>ridiculous being a baptist</p>
<p>being a buddhist is ridiculous</p>
<p>being in anything is</p>
<p>ridiculous you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>human being and if</p>
<p>you attach yourself in your mind to any</p>
<p>ideology you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be on a road</p>
<p>and that road</p>
<p>may or may not lead you in a good direction</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to stay on that fucking road if you&rsquo;re attached to an</p>
<p>ideology and it</p>
<p>could be a terrible road</p>
<p>it could be a road of</p>
<p>circumcising your</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s clitoris because that&rsquo;s a fucking tradition</p>
<p>i mean these fucking</p>
<p>crazy bitches in africa that</p>
<p>cut holes in</p>
<p>their lip and stretch them out to put</p>
<p>plates on why is that</p>
<p>because they got on a fucking road and</p>
<p>they stuck with that road</p>
<p>regardless of rational</p>
<p>thinking they didn&rsquo;t use rational</p>
<p>thinking at all</p>
<p>they had just</p>
<p>adapted a predetermined</p>
<p>pattern of behavior that makes life so much more simple</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>every fucking religion is</p>
<p>the problem is no one knows</p>
<p>you cannot know</p>
<p>you can have your own beautiful personal</p>
<p>experiences you</p>
<p>could have been the person that was actually</p>
<p>touched by god</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>start yelling and ranting that</p>
<p>other people have to follow your lead or the fucking</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s gonna end and christians are</p>
<p>gonna be taken away</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re full of shit</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>full of shit and you know you&rsquo;re full of shit</p>
<p>and the real</p>
<p>problem is that we can&rsquo;t say it because everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got this freedom of religion freedom of religion</p>
<p>religious freedom the freedom to express yourself</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re expressing yourself with nonsense</p>
<p>nonsense that helps scared lonely sad people</p>
<p>lock onto that</p>
<p>nonsense so they feel like they&rsquo;re a part of something</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is it preys on people whose lives fucking suck</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all nuts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>your shit&rsquo;s cool and my shit&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>you know yoga&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the answer or fucking mushrooms are the answer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just questions</p>
<p>and until we&rsquo;re honest</p>
<p>about that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna evolve</p>
<p>the human race is</p>
<p>stuck in a giant quagmire when it comes to our behavior</p>
<p>and our thinking</p>
<p>about our behavior</p>
<p>yeah totally</p>
<p>and i you know</p>
<p>one thing is like they all look like from</p>
<p>the geek squad these are</p>
<p>these mormon guys</p>
<p>like on ten</p>
<p>speeds can you imagine though if they just like</p>
<p>mixed it up and like showed up with like you know hairy</p>
<p>chest and necklaces and like rave</p>
<p>clothes on and sunglasses how</p>
<p>scary that would be if the mormons came to your</p>
<p>house like that they</p>
<p>started rocking it yeah like they pull up</p>
<p>like those yeah pull up in like a</p>
<p>you know what says new chevys</p>
<p>yeah man i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ready for like a hip</p>
<p>religion yet</p>
<p>there was like some work</p>
<p>they were doing</p>
<p>with rock and roll churches remember that yeah they</p>
<p>still have those</p>
<p>do they have</p>
<p>those yeah that is</p>
<p>still popular</p>
<p>totally popular mine</p>
<p>had starbucks in it</p>
<p>there was a girl</p>
<p>that used to work at fear factor she&rsquo;s a very nice girl</p>
<p>and she was you</p>
<p>know trying to find her</p>
<p>place and she</p>
<p>started going to</p>
<p>a rock and roll church saying how much i</p>
<p>would really love this rock and roll church</p>
<p>and even though</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>talking about god he&rsquo;s really all just</p>
<p>about being positive and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>vehicle that he uses</p>
<p>for a lot of people man religion</p>
<p>can give you some inspiration but there comes a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>where you have to pop the</p>
<p>training wheels off</p>
<p>and you have to recognize that all this</p>
<p>morality that you&rsquo;ve developed is good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>treat other people good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>treat other people the way you</p>
<p>would like to be</p>
<p>treated yourself it&rsquo;s like a fucking golden rule</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason for it and that reason is that we&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>in some strange way that we don&rsquo;t totally understand</p>
<p>unless you are good to</p>
<p>other people around you</p>
<p>unless you are kind and friendly</p>
<p>and warm and loving you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>enjoy this life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be problems</p>
<p>everywhere you go you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have problems</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>you gotta figure out a way to</p>
<p>enjoy this fucking life it&rsquo;s not because of</p>
<p>jesus it&rsquo;s not because of</p>
<p>moses it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>because of anybody that may or may not have ever</p>
<p>existed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you fit in better in the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you stay positive</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be some shit that was written</p>
<p>5 000 years ago on fucking animal skins that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>the golden rule because it&rsquo;s old you know that&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>we need to figure out like now</p>
<p>today what is</p>
<p>the best way to live your life what is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be ways you can be putting forward the</p>
<p>most positive energy i mean we know objectively what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing pollution we know objectively what&rsquo;s causing</p>
<p>birth defects and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking in too much chemicals and</p>
<p>not enough vitamins we know objectively all this stuff</p>
<p>we know how to</p>
<p>organize our</p>
<p>world and yet we don&rsquo;t do it we know how to</p>
<p>organize our health and yet very few people do it</p>
<p>we know all</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>the right path to being</p>
<p>a happy healthy person</p>
<p>is to do all</p>
<p>the shit that we already know you&rsquo;re supposed to do</p>
<p>take care of your body</p>
<p>take care of your health</p>
<p>take care of your mind your stress</p>
<p>meditate be kind to people we all know that</p>
<p>you ask anybody they know how to get by and to be</p>
<p>the most evolved version of you that you can be i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a magical</p>
<p>checklist if you talk to people</p>
<p>about it you said okay</p>
<p>you got a person you want to improve them what are the</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do to them</p>
<p>okay well if i was a life</p>
<p>coach the first</p>
<p>thing i would say is</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s got to get on a diet that makes him healthy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mean a diet just to lose weight i mean just</p>
<p>healthy foods in your body</p>
<p>many many vegetables vegetables</p>
<p>a lot of good good quality protein</p>
<p>a lot of water</p>
<p>stop the sodas</p>
<p>stop the bullshit</p>
<p>start working out your body and get a better</p>
<p>sense of how this machine feels</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s flowing</p>
<p>better there&rsquo;s less tension in it your mind feels like</p>
<p>relaxed and you enjoy</p>
<p>every single moment</p>
<p>of the day better</p>
<p>step one everybody knows that step right</p>
<p>but step two</p>
<p>be cool to people be nice to as many people as you can</p>
<p>smile as many people as you can have them</p>
<p>smile back at you tip well when you go to restaurants</p>
<p>just do the most you can be as nice as you can</p>
<p>and just still</p>
<p>manage to not have people walk all</p>
<p>over you just get through this life as nice as you can</p>
<p>what else do what you</p>
<p>wanna do with your life</p>
<p>right don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go be doing something you don&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get locked into you know</p>
<p>a car that you can&rsquo;t afford and doing something</p>
<p>crazy because you need the</p>
<p>money don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t do that do what you</p>
<p>wanna do do what the fuck is it that you really</p>
<p>wanna do cause if someone else is doing it</p>
<p>you can do it you know</p>
<p>i mean everybody makes</p>
<p>their own path through this world</p>
<p>but a lot of people don&rsquo;t follow the</p>
<p>path that they really fucking feel pulled to you know</p>
<p>for whatever reason they got negative programming</p>
<p>you know when they were kids someone told them</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t do it or told them to take the shortcut</p>
<p>or take the</p>
<p>shore route</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sad</p>
<p>thing man when you talk to dudes</p>
<p>especially like talented dudes and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t follow up with what they want to do you know</p>
<p>you know anybody like that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but i was just</p>
<p>thinking to your list that</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>should never stop tickling people and i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s looked down upon</p>
<p>because i enjoy i don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>people laugh in</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>including tickling</p>
<p>forcing them to</p>
<p>laugh i don&rsquo;t like people tickling</p>
<p>why are you ticklish</p>
<p>yeah ticklish yeah</p>
<p>i think tickle you know do you know</p>
<p>where ticklish</p>
<p>this is an interesting subject do you know</p>
<p>where this comes from</p>
<p>what no it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>evolutionary</p>
<p>trait and it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>being freaked out instantly and immediately</p>
<p>about spiders and insects</p>
<p>crawling on you</p>
<p>really cause</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sleeping on the ground yeah</p>
<p>cause if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping on the ground</p>
<p>and something&rsquo;s on you and you fucking move like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what ticklish is you&rsquo;re trying to avoid</p>
<p>these instant reactions</p>
<p>to these weird sensitive areas of your body especially</p>
<p>things where</p>
<p>things can crawl</p>
<p>like under your armpits</p>
<p>you touch my armpit i&rsquo;ll jump through the fucking roof</p>
<p>i fucking but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is you know i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s like this is all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an evolutionary thing</p>
<p>it did not know that makes sense</p>
<p>course why else</p>
<p>would you have this extreme reaction</p>
<p>on the bottom of your feet</p>
<p>that are stepping on things</p>
<p>not ticklish at all though i mean like</p>
<p>the dopes and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to die because you know i</p>
<p>dated this girl that i even went to</p>
<p>their let you know that</p>
<p>you have your answer</p>
<p>she was willing to date you so you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a b she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ready to be bitten by a spider</p>
<p>right i always</p>
<p>go for the butthole as the last move though like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not ticklish you&rsquo;re ticklish in the butthole</p>
<p>then wow i usually gets them</p>
<p>you ever watch a porno</p>
<p>where a girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a rubber butthole and you&rsquo;re like this is</p>
<p>ridiculous how is this</p>
<p>chuck taking this the ass</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>pound in the ass yeah</p>
<p>how do they do that i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you seen the belladonna one</p>
<p>yeah dude she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and so it&rsquo;s talked</p>
<p>about them the podcast before</p>
<p>where we we looked it up and then we</p>
<p>found out there was like</p>
<p>we looked up</p>
<p>baseball bat porn</p>
<p>because we thought it</p>
<p>would only be the one belladonna</p>
<p>video no there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bunch of videos of</p>
<p>chicks with bats up</p>
<p>their ass i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s once a girl puts a bat up her ass</p>
<p>then the other poor guys</p>
<p>they come to the</p>
<p>other chicks and go see look she&rsquo;s willing to do it</p>
<p>what you don&rsquo;t want to do it you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>work you just can add it to your resume that&rsquo;s an extra</p>
<p>job that you</p>
<p>would get that you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have got before</p>
<p>you know to dark road son</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>weird i would like to see like the resumes of some of</p>

<p>yeah how do you know that</p>
<p>somebody tweeted it</p>
<p>earlier today</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t research it so it</p>
<p>might be fake</p>
<p>could you imagine if they really do invent</p>
<p>a time machine one day</p>
<p>cause the real thing</p>
<p>about time machines that people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>aware of there&rsquo;s like scientists that actually</p>
<p>try to like</p>
<p>study time travel whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy is in fucking awesome story</p>
<p>his name is</p>
<p>ronald mallet</p>
<p>dr ronald mallet i believe from connecticut</p>
<p>see if you google that shit see if that&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>but anyway the guy has a fantastic</p>
<p>story he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s like the leading</p>
<p>scientist when it comes to</p>
<p>theoretical</p>
<p>models for time</p>
<p>travel what was his name</p>
<p>ronald mallet from i believe</p>
<p>university of connecticut and he</p>
<p>he has like a working</p>
<p>model yeah it is ronald malin</p>
<p>he has a working model of</p>
<p>m a l l e t</p>
<p>t or one one two or two t&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tt who else</p>
<p>ronald m a l l e</p>
<p>t t look them up on google and there&rsquo;s some videos</p>
<p>about them but</p>
<p>his dad died it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy story</p>
<p>his dad died when he was a kid</p>
<p>and he was so hurt he</p>
<p>loved his father there&rsquo;s all those</p>
<p>photos of him</p>
<p>and his father and his father smiling and he&rsquo;s smiling</p>
<p>he was so close to his father when his father died it</p>
<p>crushed him</p>
<p>and so he dedicated his life</p>
<p>to creating a time machine</p>
<p>he dedicated</p>
<p>his life to creating a time machine so that he</p>
<p>could go back in time and save his father so his father</p>
<p>would be with him</p>
<p>again so that was the entire</p>
<p>focus of his life</p>
<p>and he got to a certain</p>
<p>point where he realized that you can</p>
<p>someday it is possible to</p>
<p>travel back in time</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to go back to any</p>
<p>point in history</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>able to go back in time to the moment that the</p>
<p>first time machine was invented</p>
<p>so what will be able to be possible is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to the moment there is a time machine invented you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>that day from that day on you&rsquo;ll be able to go to any</p>
<p>point in history that you want</p>
<p>so you can go to</p>
<p>assuming there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>human beings around</p>
<p>you know assuming though the</p>
<p>world hasn&rsquo;t been hit by another planet or some</p>
<p>crazy shit you&rsquo;ll be able to go to</p>
<p>you know one million years from now let&rsquo;s see what the</p>
<p>world looks like one million years from now because</p>
<p>there will be time machines functional back then</p>
<p>or in that future</p>
<p>but the problem is then</p>
<p>this is the this you know this is all</p>
<p>theoretical but the problem is that any moment in time</p>
<p>could also go back to the moment the</p>
<p>first time she was invented</p>
<p>so if you can</p>
<p>travel back in time from any moment in time that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>millions of years in fact</p>
<p>infinite if people are still</p>
<p>alive of time of years of people</p>
<p>going back to the moment of the</p>
<p>first time machine being invented so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally like</p>
<p>the whole notion of time gets broken there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>real future it all kind of happens all at once</p>
<p>so it literally</p>
<p>fucks with the entire fabric of the universe</p>
<p>everything can come back</p>
<p>to the moment that the</p>
<p>first time machine was invented</p>
<p>it breaks everything</p>
<p>so this is like real shit they&rsquo;re working on like this</p>
<p>guy is like really convinced that this is a possible</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s craziness beyond</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>back to the future 3</p>
<p>if you look at the very end of the</p>
<p>movie when docs</p>
<p>has his kids and he&rsquo;s like telling like see a</p>
<p>mighty everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be good you know</p>
<p>look at one of the kids</p>
<p>the kid starts</p>
<p>going like this</p>
<p>like come here or put something in my hand</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>points to his dick</p>
<p>what it is so ridiculous</p>
<p>and just got</p>
<p>snuck through somehow it</p>
<p>snuck through but i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about like a six year old</p>
<p>dude people were so</p>
<p>stupid back then</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>so yeah you</p>
<p>could find on youtube like back to the future three</p>
<p>points to package</p>
<p>is that one of</p>
<p>those movies that you go</p>
<p>watch it today and it</p>
<p>would disappoint the shit out of you</p>
<p>yeah not so good huh</p>
<p>not so good i mean i saw the</p>
<p>first one the</p>
<p>other day and it was okay but then i saw the</p>
<p>third one and it was just so</p>
<p>dumb i didn&rsquo;t even want to</p>
<p>watch it yeah man the</p>
<p>evolution of</p>
<p>movies has been pretty fucking</p>
<p>pretty obvious</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>evolution of what we accept</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>like people talk</p>
<p>about avatar being</p>
<p>silly and ridiculous but</p>
<p>still you see toy</p>
<p>story three yet</p>
<p>no i heard it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>is it yeah doing the best</p>
<p>all that animation stuff just</p>
<p>freaks me the fuck out i was reading and wired that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some insane amount of time for like</p>
<p>every frame</p>
<p>for as far as like</p>
<p>rendering some like</p>
<p>seven hour fucking time for each</p>
<p>frame to render</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that insane</p>
<p>which movie though this can&rsquo;t be there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>picture now</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>hmm it seems like it</p>
<p>would be better than</p>
<p>i could go into the living room and go get that uh</p>
<p>that magazine but i don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>where it is and i want to get up</p>
<p>but the idea is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still even into this day it&rsquo;s very difficult to do</p>
<p>the whole even if my time frame is</p>
<p>wrong the whole</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just go look</p>
<p>under wired hmm pixar</p>
<p>sorry not pixel um</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not quite</p>
<p>there yet as far as like the technology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>exist one day</p>
<p>where you can create instant</p>
<p>artificial people</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>remember like the editing that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>right now just with final cut</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m just doing on a regular home computer on</p>
<p>apple i mean that this is the kind of shit that</p>
<p>ten years ago it&rsquo;s like fucking</p>
<p>dreaming right now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dreaming bitch like you know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to edit and how fast is it</p>
<p>gonna render</p>
<p>you gonna put shit together it&rsquo;s that easy 20 years ago</p>
<p>science fiction</p>
<p>right twenty years ago science fiction</p>
<p>thirty years ago</p>
<p>super crazy science fiction that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>ridiculous you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s just like people</p>
<p>would look at in the</p>
<p>movies and go wow</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>minority report type shit yeah</p>
<p>where they make</p>
<p>it look like you can do it now but it really is not</p>
<p>gonna exist for another you know</p>
<p>hundred years or so what did you say how many hours</p>
<p>i think they said</p>
<p>seven yeah that&rsquo;s what they just</p>
<p>seven hours right at</p>
<p>seven hours</p>
<p>seven hours per</p>
<p>pixel yeah yeah</p>
<p>what the fuck man and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>supercomputer to</p>
<p>right don&rsquo;t they use like a</p>
<p>server i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they use yeah a huge</p>
<p>cloud of computers</p>
<p>definitely that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous those</p>
<p>movies took a lot of fucking time</p>
<p>but goddamn they&rsquo;re cool as fuck so</p>
<p>seven hours now</p>
<p>so in ten years</p>
<p>that means we</p>
<p>could do pixar</p>
<p>movies on our phone</p>
<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s gonna be awesome hey dude</p>
<p>check out toy</p>
<p>story 80 huh if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break the universe before then yeah</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s my latest theory right</p>
<p>the human beings create the big bang and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about on that stage</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s why the big i</p>
<p>think 14 billion years ago plus</p>
<p>was the big bang</p>
<p>i think it was a lonely dude in his basement who</p>
<p>figured out a way to</p>
<p>break the universe and he had a</p>
<p>switch and he wanted to see what happened and he</p>
<p>clicked it and the</p>
<p>whole thing i just want</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what happens and then</p>
<p>people get curious and we develop to a certain</p>
<p>point in time where we</p>
<p>repeat the process</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that possible</p>
<p>i mean nobody knows what the fuck created the big bang</p>
<p>right but when you see scientists</p>
<p>working on shit like the</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>large hadron colliders this</p>
<p>crazy experiment that they&rsquo;re participating</p>
<p>right now in europe</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve got this</p>
<p>22 kilometer</p>
<p>long machine and it spins</p>
<p>these atoms around and collides them it&rsquo;s just just</p>
<p>slightly slower than the</p>
<p>speed of light</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to recreate a</p>
<p>thing called the</p>
<p>higgs boston particle now they believe there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>five different</p>
<p>higgs boston particles are trying to figure out like</p>
<p>what existed they called the</p>
<p>god particle for lack of a better word and it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>existed just a</p>
<p>millisecond</p>
<p>you know a fraction of a</p>
<p>millisecond even</p>
<p>right after the big bang</p>
<p>so when they</p>
<p>get that when they figure out how to do that and if</p>
<p>they do recreate the higgs boss and if they do really</p>
<p>find out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just a theoretical particle but it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>when they do that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna stop there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to stop there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to keep going</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next thing</p>
<p>they got 10 000 scientists</p>
<p>working on that this is the biggest project in</p>
<p>scientific history</p>
<p>and it has nothing to do with making our lives better</p>
<p>technology at one</p>
<p>point in time was all</p>
<p>about making your life better</p>
<p>technology was about</p>
<p>hey we need to get</p>
<p>water and we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>just have to</p>
<p>drink it out of the</p>
<p>river every time</p>
<p>we need to get it and</p>
<p>bring it back</p>
<p>to camp what do we do we figured out how to make a jug</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>technology today</p>
<p>the shit like the higgs boston particle</p>
<p>shit like the</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>shit like making time machines like what are you doing</p>
<p>like what the fuck are you doing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fixing the hole in the ground in the</p>
<p>gulf that&rsquo;s making the oil pull out</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t they pull all the scientists off</p>
<p>everything and go okay we</p>
<p>gotta fix this</p>
<p>before the whole</p>
<p>ocean gets poison i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>wondered why they don&rsquo;t do that anyway so with cancer</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s anything i</p>
<p>just like all</p>
<p>right all you guys we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you know take</p>
<p>all the sciences</p>
<p>at once cancer</p>
<p>one year do it</p>
<p>you know these guys aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>experts in their</p>
<p>fields obviously you mean</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>everything about</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>silly concept i mean what i&rsquo;m saying but</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>great if they took all the top scientists from</p>
<p>all the different disciplines that</p>
<p>would be involved and they immediately allocated</p>
<p>funds to get them to work on the project instantly</p>
<p>and just the government step</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not in</p>
<p>favor of the government stepping in but in this case i</p>
<p>would say this is</p>
<p>not just a natural disaster</p>
<p>this is a fucking catastrophic disaster</p>
<p>where apocalyptic</p>
<p>disaster where they need to step in and do something</p>
<p>about this immediately</p>
<p>they need to impose</p>
<p>almost like a martial law</p>
<p>type of a thing</p>
<p>take over the</p>
<p>whole but then</p>
<p>again who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing that for the government the government</p>
<p>would have to involve the private sector</p>
<p>and then the private</p>
<p>sector would try to make a lot of</p>
<p>money from it and they</p>
<p>would try to fuck people over and it</p>
<p>would be a big scandal and it</p>
<p>would be like halibut and they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>find out billions of dollars are missing from the yeah</p>
<p>whatever my fucking idea sucks you see that baby in</p>
<p>china was born with a</p>
<p>second dude i did and i didn&rsquo;t want to look</p>
<p>i saw it and i shut</p>
<p>it off that shit depresses the fuck out it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>amazing now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>second face and it kind of looks like what is that</p>
<p>movie phantom of the</p>
<p>opera or whatever</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s i mean</p>
<p>did you does it say if they were</p>
<p>gonna be able to fix the kid or</p>
<p>no dude i didn&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>it depresses the shit out of me</p>
<p>just like the one that i saw the</p>
<p>other day where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a baby that was born there was like a fish baby</p>
<p>and like the skin had this very strange disease</p>
<p>that shit so depressing to me man</p>
<p>you know fucked at birth</p>
<p>and especially man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s depressing when you find out that it&rsquo;s due to</p>
<p>birth defects because</p>
<p>of chemicals people that worked at factories and</p>
<p>you know people that were</p>
<p>given chemicals they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>given while they were pregnant</p>
<p>man china china&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tricky place</p>
<p>right now man</p>
<p>china has some of the most</p>
<p>polluted cities in the</p>
<p>world have you ever seen the</p>
<p>videos on that</p>
<p>is that the same</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re dropping</p>
<p>all our old computers and cell</p>
<p>phones are all</p>
<p>going there is that china</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know do they go to</p>
<p>china yeah there&rsquo;s somewhere they go and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>cities that are</p>
<p>kind of like was that wall e movie</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s cities of just old computers and</p>
<p>stuff like that yeah let&rsquo;s find out</p>
<p>where they go let&rsquo;s find out because i never</p>
<p>heard of that before really i</p>
<p>know but i do know that you know</p>
<p>china has terrible</p>
<p>pollution problems</p>
<p>and there was one city</p>
<p>where they showed it was it a vbs tv doc</p>
<p>some doc that i</p>
<p>watched on the most</p>
<p>polluted city in the world</p>
<p>and just one day in this city</p>
<p>just breathing</p>
<p>the air is like smoking</p>
<p>three packs of</p>
<p>cigarettes a day wow</p>
<p>so every fucking day you&rsquo;re there you&rsquo;re smoking</p>
<p>three packs of</p>
<p>cigarettes a day that the sky was</p>
<p>brown man it was</p>
<p>crazy like you couldn&rsquo;t see shit</p>
<p>like it took</p>
<p>smog to la&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nasty dude when</p>
<p>you come over like when you&rsquo;re coming from the valley</p>
<p>and you come over that hill</p>
<p>and you see everything</p>
<p>brown and you can&rsquo;t even see the fucking mountains</p>
<p>outside like pasadena you can&rsquo;t see the mountains</p>
<p>and you look at it and</p>
<p>you go what the fuck are we doing to the air that ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shit compared to</p>
<p>china right</p>
<p>china&rsquo;s five times</p>
<p>worse than that it is the nuttiest</p>
<p>shit you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your life</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what kind of laws they have i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how they get away with shit like that but the factories</p>
<p>just pump shit out</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>so we have a photo you</p>
<p>found the dangers of old computers is a computer</p>
<p>wasteland does it say what country</p>
<p>china china</p>
<p>woman in every</p>
<p>china is about to smash</p>
<p>yeah i mean everybody keeps going off about how</p>
<p>great the economy is in china and china&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>becoming like a capitalist economy and you know</p>
<p>chinese people are</p>
<p>you know the whole country is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changing and flourishing and we owe america owes</p>
<p>china so much</p>
<p>and then you look at what</p>
<p>china&rsquo;s really doing like con cam</p>
<p>you know or a foxcon rather</p>
<p>right is then the name of the company foxcon</p>
<p>foxcons where all those guys who are working for</p>
<p>apple keep killing themselves</p>
<p>they help make iphone</p>
<p>speaking of how do you like your new iphone</p>
<p>how to get a new one yeah</p>
<p>how to get a new one what happened</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t accept the</p>
<p>sim card kept saying i didn&rsquo;t have a sim card oh yeah</p>
<p>crazy i don&rsquo;t know what happened</p>
<p>i just kept doing it</p>
<p>kept saying no sim card no sim card and so</p>
<p>finally eventually had to</p>
<p>bring it back to him yeah so do you want to see live</p>
<p>me going from</p>
<p>three bars to zero service</p>
<p>okay this is the</p>
<p>thing where if you</p>
<p>touch the bottom it says</p>
<p>it does something</p>
<p>first i show it</p>
<p>okay if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>nobody could see this man this fucking web camera sucks</p>
<p>you can see i have bars</p>
<p>okay you can at</p>
<p>least see i have a couple bars</p>
<p>right well just</p>
<p>just do it and tell us what&rsquo;s happening okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going from i just went to</p>
<p>three it was on four actually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now a two oh wow</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now going to go to one any second now</p>
<p>so just slowly drops yeah</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>apple says they say that it&rsquo;s an error in the</p>
<p>phones while drop down to one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s gonna go to no service now</p>
<p>they say that it&rsquo;s a an</p>
<p>error in the phones computing and that it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an error wow saying</p>
<p>no searching</p>
<p>wow okay let it go now</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll go back up and so</p>
<p>apple&rsquo;s trying to say that it&rsquo;s not a real problem</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to say that what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting is just a more accurate representation</p>
<p>of the signals wow now it&rsquo;s got a signal yeah</p>
<p>which is whack that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense yeah because if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying what they&rsquo;re saying is like if this is</p>
<p>wrong if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>three bars right now you actually have one bar and</p>
<p>covering up the antenna will make it go down</p>
<p>i said it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stupid thing to say because</p>
<p>okay so you&rsquo;re saying that the</p>
<p>phone just calculates the bars incorrectly</p>
<p>and really when you</p>
<p>touch it a certain way</p>
<p>then it calculates them</p>
<p>right what is that the</p>
<p>truth button the fuck are you talking about</p>
<p>you have a button and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of the</p>
<p>phone and if you touch it</p>
<p>it makes the phone</p>
<p>honest with you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stupid that&rsquo;s a hardware problem you cocksucker</p>
<p>right it doesn&rsquo;t do it with the case</p>
<p>which is good because i</p>
<p>never used my iphone without a case</p>
<p>anyway you get signal here man</p>
<p>yeah you should get signal yeah i got</p>
<p>and when you had no signal that&rsquo;s not normal right</p>
<p>but but the problem is what are they</p>
<p>gonna really do</p>
<p>about it is this software update just</p>
<p>gonna make all the everyone</p>
<p>that just not happen you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>always have</p>
<p>lower signal than normal</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t buy it somebody just made up a</p>
<p>whack excuse</p>
<p>right because if they didn&rsquo;t make up a</p>
<p>whack excuse</p>
<p>they would have had to have some massive fucking recall</p>
<p>yeah people</p>
<p>would have gone nuts this</p>
<p>class action lawsuit in the works</p>
<p>yeah but they said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it does it on the 3g and</p>
<p>yeah yeah the 3s</p>
<p>but i tried on the 3gs i couldn&rsquo;t do it really</p>
<p>i tried video bottom</p>
<p>right i tried</p>
<p>doing top oh really yeah i couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>maybe they broke</p>
<p>theirs or something</p>
<p>maybe maybe was</p>
<p>older models</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a stupid way to deal with the</p>
<p>issue though tell people they have to buy a bumper</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re selling bumpers for 30 bucks</p>
<p>which is kind of douchey in and of itself</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah how come</p>
<p>if i drop it it&rsquo;s fucked</p>
<p>right so you get that bumper</p>
<p>so you give me this little</p>
<p>thing to put around it oh how much is this little</p>
<p>thing 30 bucks</p>
<p>this is 30 bucks</p>
<p>right and only</p>
<p>apple makes it and it</p>
<p>should have came with it fucking you got a</p>
<p>blackberry the</p>
<p>other day it came with a</p>
<p>leather case yeah</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t get a little</p>
<p>piece of rubber</p>
<p>i know you know so i went to best buy and i bought</p>
<p>two of the only cases that best buy</p>
<p>cells you know that</p>
<p>cover the back</p>
<p>so the first one i put on</p>
<p>it was so tight and</p>
<p>poorly made i</p>
<p>think was belkin</p>
<p>that the top button just</p>
<p>automatically was always pushed down so it was just</p>
<p>resetting my</p>
<p>phone over and over</p>
<p>so i had a second one that i was</p>
<p>going to give to you and i opened that one and</p>
<p>tried it again</p>
<p>same thing went online</p>
<p>found out that&rsquo;s the problem with the case</p>
<p>so then i bought this</p>
<p>other one from griffith that had</p>
<p>plastic back to it</p>
<p>and every time you took a</p>
<p>photo it would</p>
<p>flash and hit the plastic</p>
<p>and flash back into the camera and</p>
<p>every photo looked like shit</p>
<p>and it went back online</p>
<p>same exact thing</p>
<p>across the board</p>
<p>so the only case we can</p>
<p>it right now</p>
<p>is this one that won&rsquo;t protect</p>

<p>fuck yeah can you imagine lindsay</p>
<p>lohan as your mom</p>
<p>and fucking the dude from jackass</p>
<p>steve o as your dad do you</p>
<p>think she can get pregnant uh</p>
<p>now she&rsquo;s probably so big</p>
<p>like you said</p>
<p>we just saw that she was 24</p>
<p>i thought for sure she was like over 30</p>
<p>i forgot all</p>
<p>about her being a</p>
<p>young girl right yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i wonder if i</p>
<p>could hard action man that</p>
<p>chicks out there doing it</p>
<p>every night yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the one who told me that she</p>
<p>got a tooth pulled just so she can get back on viking</p>
<p>well yeah supposedly when she got that scramble</p>
<p>bracelet on</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called that she immediately</p>
<p>had a dentist appointment like the next day that was</p>
<p>supposedly priorly you know</p>
<p>prior to this whatever and she had like a</p>
<p>tooth pulled or she had something that she had done</p>
<p>but it was like oh now she&rsquo;s allowed to have viking</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>for her so that</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>crazy bracelet on and says she has to stay sober</p>
<p>right and the dentist gives her viking in</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>she don&rsquo;t need to get fucking viking in i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>teeth pulled i&rsquo;ve had shit happen</p>
<p>right you just deal with it it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>bad i have a knee surgery didn&rsquo;t take pain medication</p>
<p>i took viking in when i had my</p>
<p>first acl reconstruction it made me feel so stupid</p>
<p>it just made me feel so dumb</p>
<p>and i sold him some dude at the pool hall</p>
<p>this dude named jeff</p>
<p>you did not do that yes i did you</p>
<p>sell them i sold them to my friend</p>
<p>jeff and jeff sold them all throughout the pool</p>
<p>people gobble</p>
<p>those vikings up they love them</p>
<p>i had a friend</p>
<p>who was a guitarist he used to say that it made him</p>
<p>more creative</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s the opposite</p>
<p>effect it does to me to me it makes me feel</p>
<p>fucking useless and dumb that&rsquo;s all it does yeah but i</p>
<p>think everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brain is working differently man</p>
<p>i mean slightly i</p>
<p>think we all have different</p>
<p>levels of different chemicals and different</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>music was probably fucking retarded then well</p>
<p>no he was a</p>
<p>classical guitarist he was really good</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>went like competitions and shit it was fucking badass</p>
<p>worst song i ever competition</p>
<p>no man he would</p>
<p>play songs that already existed</p>
<p>you know like spanish</p>
<p>flamenka songs that</p>
<p>kind of shit he was just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a brilliant guitarist</p>
<p>and he said we take</p>
<p>vodka dance it</p>
<p>would make him more creative i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but you know everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brains he&rsquo;s a fucking crazy dude</p>
<p>who was a former</p>
<p>taekwondo champion my friend dimitri</p>
<p>and he was a</p>
<p>big fucking burly</p>
<p>manly giant dude from the ukraine</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>his family is a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking savages</p>
<p>bunch of russian</p>
<p>fucking animals</p>
<p>and maybe the viking in just helped calm his</p>
<p>inner monkey</p>
<p>enough so that he</p>
<p>could you know he</p>
<p>could tune into his creative spirit</p>
<p>you know yeah everyone&rsquo;s different right</p>
<p>this this dude is the only</p>
<p>dude that i&rsquo;ve ever talked to that said viking ends</p>
<p>made him creative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>could easily been it you know</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own fucking</p>
<p>thing man i mean how many people have you come across</p>
<p>where you go this guy&rsquo;s just broken</p>
<p>his brains just not wired</p>

<p>i like the idea creating your own</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>mm hmm good</p>
<p>stuff so brock</p>
<p>brock lesnar</p>
<p>and shane carwin that was crazy</p>
<p>brian was there</p>
<p>yeah on the</p>
<p>floors what on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so glad they didn&rsquo;t say about</p>
<p>man oh yeah</p>
<p>brock is one of</p>
<p>those people that that they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about stopping it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take a few</p>
<p>trains until they</p>
<p>really stop the guy</p>
<p>so glad that</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>you know trains to the head</p>
<p>but i mean that</p>
<p>he they didn&rsquo;t stop it so i was</p>
<p>happy i was just</p>
<p>i was so scared they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop it</p>
<p>yeah well you know</p>
<p>it looked like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop it i mean he was just</p>
<p>covering up and</p>
<p>shane carne was bombing on them and props to referee</p>
<p>josh rosenthal</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t for josh rosenthal</p>
<p>that you know someone easily</p>
<p>could have pulled the</p>
<p>trigger earlier</p>
<p>right you know there&rsquo;s a few guys that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>trusted in that situation but</p>
<p>josh saw that he was okay he was</p>
<p>going to get through it and he saw that</p>
<p>chains punches were coming slower and slower</p>
<p>and chain unfortunately just blew his wand</p>
<p>he had an adrenaline</p>
<p>dump i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>the excitement of the fact that he had</p>
<p>the champ hurt and on his back and that</p>
<p>he was on top and he&rsquo;s like this is over this fucking</p>
<p>thing is over</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s pounded him and</p>
<p>pounded him and</p>
<p>then all of a</p>
<p>sudden he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like fuck there&rsquo;s two minutes left to go in this</p>
<p>round you know</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s got to keep</p>
<p>going and by the end of</p>
<p>those two minutes there was nothing left</p>
<p>he got back to his corner and literally</p>
<p>could barely get up his legs were barely walking</p>
<p>and he was fucked he said his legs seized up</p>
<p>and he said he just went out there and he</p>
<p>tried to do</p>
<p>whatever he</p>
<p>could but his body just was not responding</p>
<p>he just completely adrenaline</p>
<p>dumped and completely blew out all of his energy</p>
<p>but goddamn did he hit him hard before that</p>
<p>holy shit that fucking</p>
<p>shane carwin can punch</p>
<p>he hits so hard he&rsquo;s so big</p>
<p>but i think he&rsquo;s too big</p>
<p>i think maybe like</p>
<p>he had to lose like 17</p>
<p>pounds to make</p>
<p>265 so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>walking in like</p>
<p>like somewhere around 280</p>
<p>ish you know on the day of the fight</p>
<p>so i think that</p>
<p>might be too big for his frame</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>he might be better off if he was like 250</p>
<p>you know just a little</p>
<p>lighter but with more endurance</p>
<p>his punches are</p>
<p>still going to be</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>powerful nobody could</p>
<p>stand up to the way that guy hits</p>
<p>his punches will</p>
<p>still be ridiculously</p>
<p>powerful but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll have a little bit more cardio</p>
<p>brock is just physically a bigger guy man brock</p>
<p>brock really has a 270</p>
<p>pound man&rsquo;s body i mean he&rsquo;s so wide</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a big</p>
<p>giant freak</p>
<p>carlin&rsquo;s not as wide you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still big as fuck got big</p>
<p>giant hands and shit but</p>
<p>you know i think brock</p>
<p>maybe can carry a little bit more weight</p>
<p>naturally than shane can</p>
<p>these guys when they</p>
<p>train really hard with weights and</p>
<p>power lifting and shit like that yeah makes you</p>
<p>stronger gives you a lot more muscle and that muscle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta get fed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta get fed by blood</p>
<p>but god damn it was</p>
<p>exciting as fuck before it was</p>
<p>before it was over</p>
<p>how do you still have his mouthpiece</p>
<p>yeah i got brock</p>
<p>lesnar&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>put in yet tasted the</p>
<p>taste of the</p>
<p>taste of a warrior</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right over there</p>
<p>he stuck it in my pocket</p>
<p>after was over i said i&rsquo;m gonna sell that shit on ebay</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna hang out to it yeah that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>fucking i&rsquo;m a fan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trivia moment</p>
<p>plus it was what a comeback</p>
<p>when he came out for that second round</p>
<p>his hands were</p>
<p>up high and like you know you just knew like this</p>
<p>motherfucker&rsquo;s not going away</p>
<p>he got hit with some bombs and he was</p>
<p>still there and</p>
<p>still in really good</p>
<p>shape and that was really the big difference</p>
<p>he took shane down</p>
<p>gone shane&rsquo;s half</p>
<p>guard passed</p>
<p>got on top of them</p>
<p>got him in an arm triangle and put him to</p>
<p>sleep it was fucking sweet</p>
<p>or put him you</p>
<p>know to tap</p>
<p>he would have gone to</p>
<p>sleep he really</p>
<p>cranked it tight and</p>
<p>brock is so gigantic he</p>
<p>they also call it a side choke</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>different versions of it there&rsquo;s one like this you do</p>
<p>it like this and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called an arm triangle</p>
<p>but the way</p>
<p>brock did it i</p>
<p>think he did it with a gable</p>
<p>grip where you do it like this</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s really more of a side choke</p>
<p>but brock is so big and so fucking strong</p>
<p>that when he just</p>
<p>crushes down like that like</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t have any options man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>sleep he&rsquo;s just got much too much</p>
<p>power he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna crush that</p>
<p>whole area between your arm and your neck and</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get smushed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be any air</p>
<p>that was one of the best</p>
<p>ufcs i think in a long time</p>
<p>right that was</p>
<p>dude i was standing up during the</p>
<p>lesnar fight</p>
<p>it was so exciting i couldn&rsquo;t fucking sit down i</p>
<p>stood up that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>when car went hit him and</p>
<p>he went to the ground it was like</p>
<p>the whole thing there was so much energy in the</p>
<p>arena it was so unbelievable</p>
<p>and then when</p>
<p>brock took him down at the end it was like</p>
<p>the whole thing was just</p>
<p>so and then when he tapped like it was just</p>
<p>fucking craziness man there was so much energy i</p>
<p>stood up like</p>
<p>three or four times</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do that man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>fight i&rsquo;ve ever had to</p>
<p>stand up in the middle of it because it was so crazy</p>
<p>like as far as like sheer</p>
<p>entertainment value</p>
<p>what a fucking fight</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>bunch of sheer</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>value fights</p>
<p>that were just off the charts</p>
<p>like lieben and akiyama</p>
<p>holy shit yeah that was</p>
<p>crazy man god</p>
<p>for sheer entertainment</p>
<p>that fight was better than any fucking</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s ever been made i said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>photos of his face</p>
<p>since then leaving</p>
<p>yeah dude leave is probably fine probably looks</p>
<p>today like nobody hit him really yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tough as fuck damn</p>
<p>he can take</p>
<p>a shot dude he got nailed his legs went rubbery</p>
<p>he bounces backwards for a</p>
<p>second and then</p>
<p>starts walking forwards</p>
<p>again like a fucking zombie</p>
<p>it was incredible</p>
<p>he was he was like</p>
<p>literally like</p>
<p>right out of</p>
<p>twenty eight days later</p>
<p>it was fucking crazy</p>
<p>he can take bombs man he takes them</p>
<p>right on the chin and keeps going</p>
<p>the only persons been able to put him away is anderson</p>
<p>anderson&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>way too fast way too technical way too fluid</p>
<p>just way too</p>
<p>gifted anderson&rsquo;s just on another level</p>
<p>but for a lot of</p>
<p>other people man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like arturo</p>
<p>gotti couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight with with</p>
<p>floyd mayweather he got in there with</p>
<p>floyd mayweather he just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t compete he couldn&rsquo;t compete with the style</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t compete with the technical superiority the</p>
<p>speed the reflexes the training</p>
<p>everything was superior and he just got lit up</p>
<p>but when he fought someone like</p>
<p>mickey ward who was like in his ball</p>
<p>in his range</p>
<p>he put on some of the most incredible</p>
<p>fights ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of getting on the</p>
<p>right opponent</p>
<p>and leven keeps getting better and better you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you know he&rsquo;s beating like high</p>
<p>level guys you know</p>
<p>aaron simpson</p>
<p>the guy who beat before he beat this guy is a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker man</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s a serious fucking wrestler</p>
<p>strong as shit incredible endurance</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>his fight with tom lawler</p>
<p>he got nailed from pillar to post in that</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>you know he came back and he fucking</p>
<p>started taking</p>
<p>lower down and the</p>
<p>third round he came back and won that</p>
<p>round too and</p>
<p>wound up getting the decision when</p>
<p>it looked like he was a dead man in the</p>
<p>first round he was getting battered so</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s tough as fuck</p>
<p>so when lieben</p>
<p>put him away it was like wow like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strong that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>strong statement</p>
<p>you know and then the next</p>
<p>fight to go</p>
<p>right from that two weeks later to</p>
<p>fight akiyama</p>
<p>you know akiyama is a fucking bad dude man</p>
<p>knocked out dennis</p>
<p>kang&rsquo;s fastest fuck</p>
<p>awesome judo real</p>
<p>solid grappler you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good dude so leaving</p>
<p>two fucking</p>
<p>sweet wins in a row</p>
<p>and how about that</p>
<p>kristoff suzinski stephen bonner fight oh</p>
<p>that was probably</p>
<p>one of my that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>second favorite of the</p>
<p>night dude a man</p>
<p>are just attacked like a man</p>
<p>possessed yeah of</p>
<p>he knew that like it was</p>
<p>do or die time he had lost to coleman</p>
<p>he had you know had the</p>
<p>fight with suzynski like he was fight</p>
<p>look that guy will always have a home in the</p>
<p>ufc because he&rsquo;s a part of the biggest</p>
<p>fight in the history of the</p>
<p>sport the most important</p>
<p>fight the fight that got everybody to pay attention the</p>
<p>fight with him</p>
<p>and stefan bonner</p>
<p>when they were on</p>
<p>spike tv when it was the</p>
<p>finals of the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter the very</p>
<p>first season</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>so many people were</p>
<p>tuning in while the</p>
<p>fight was on</p>
<p>that i think</p>
<p>the amount of people viewing the fight by</p>
<p>the time the first card</p>
<p>started but the</p>
<p>first fight of the card</p>
<p>started to stefan</p>
<p>bonner and forres griffin</p>
<p>boris griffin&rsquo;s fight</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d like double tripled quadrupled</p>
<p>at one point in time some insane number like six to 10</p>
<p>million they estimated</p>
<p>forget what it was</p>
<p>but something</p>
<p>crazy was watching that</p>
<p>fight where nobody was watching</p>
<p>spike tv before that</p>
<p>just people were calling</p>
<p>their friends and they were like dude</p>
<p>you gotta fucking</p>
<p>turn this on turn on channel whatever it is</p>
<p>these two guys are beating the shit out of each other</p>
<p>and forest griffin and stephen bonner had like a</p>
<p>movie fight</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even real it was like a goddamn</p>
<p>every which way but</p>
<p>loose clint eastwood</p>
<p>movie it was him</p>
<p>fighting tank murdoch</p>
<p>they beat each</p>
<p>other all over the fucking</p>
<p>place and kept coming</p>
<p>they just went after each</p>
<p>other for 15</p>
<p>solid minutes nobody backed down for a second</p>
<p>you know so he&rsquo;ll always have like</p>
<p>a strong place in the organization</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll always</p>
<p>have love for that dude</p>
<p>but he also knew that he wants to be</p>
<p>back in the heat</p>
<p>at 205 he wants to be</p>
<p>fighting up to his potential and he knows</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had some</p>
<p>good outings and some not so good outings that john</p>
<p>jones fight was a</p>
<p>tough loss he had</p>
<p>three tough losses in a row</p>
<p>so he stepped in</p>
<p>like a fucking wild man felt like his life was on the</p>
<p>line i was actually surprised to see him back since the</p>
<p>last one yeah</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>cause i always liked that guy well you know</p>
<p>he got through when coleman</p>
<p>got caught man</p>
<p>coleman fought couture</p>
<p>he got caught but</p>
<p>right before coleman</p>
<p>beat couture or lost to couture</p>
<p>rather he beat bonner</p>
<p>you know so are you surprised that like kimbo is not</p>
<p>given an extra shot or</p>
<p>yes and no i see the point</p>
<p>you know really</p>
<p>if he wasn&rsquo;t kimbo</p>
<p>you would have to cut him</p>
<p>matt metreone</p>
<p>beat him down and it looked like he was you</p>
<p>know it didn&rsquo;t look like he was in the</p>
<p>right kind of condition</p>
<p>it looks like he got really</p>
<p>tired his technical prowess wasn&rsquo;t up to the</p>
<p>level of metreone</p>
<p>metreone and improved much more</p>
<p>from his time on the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter</p>
<p>and you also have to wonder</p>
<p>about kimbo&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>kimbo had some real knee problems on the show</p>
<p>and the knee problems that he had on the show they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t fixable</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s like bone on bone type shit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s worn out the cartilage in one of his knees</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t train as hard you can&rsquo;t sprawl</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the kind of wrestling</p>
<p>training that you need you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>your legs kicked the way you kind of need to get kicked</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>pretty serious problem</p>
<p>that problem kept him from</p>
<p>fighting in the main event or</p>
<p>getting another</p>
<p>shot at getting back in the heat of the show remember</p>
<p>he got eliminated and</p>
<p>then they offered it to him they offered him a fight</p>
<p>and he passed on the</p>
<p>fight because of his knee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something that gets better</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>unless he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got some sort of a cartilage replacement surgery</p>
<p>or i don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re even able to do these days</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a problem with that knee</p>
<p>and that knee is</p>
<p>gonna keep him from being able to</p>
<p>train the way</p>
<p>the way gsp</p>
<p>trains or tiago</p>
<p>alves trains or</p>
<p>any of the killers</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i i</p>
<p>think you could</p>
<p>still make a lot of</p>
<p>money off the guy and the guy</p>
<p>still wants a fight</p>
<p>i look at it as like you know butterbean</p>
<p>member and butterbean was king of the four</p>
<p>rounders you know</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t use butterbean on your car just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna beat</p>
<p>larry holmes all right</p>
<p>you know get butterbean</p>
<p>out there fuck it you know put them out there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still entertaining</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like chris</p>
<p>lieben i mean</p>
<p>chris lieben</p>
<p>is you know he&rsquo;s battling it out with the best in the</p>
<p>world he&rsquo;s beating akiyama beat you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s starting to move up in the chain</p>
<p>but the end of the rainbow for him is always</p>
<p>gonna be anderson silva</p>
<p>you know anderson</p>
<p>i mean look anybody can beat anybody on any</p>
<p>given day a zigguin you</p>
<p>should have zag you run into one of chris lieben&rsquo;s</p>
<p>punches you</p>
<p>could be in a lot of trouble</p>
<p>technically</p>
<p>the two are so far apart</p>
<p>anderson is in such a different</p>
<p>level athletically</p>
<p>his ease of movement</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>what do you do you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to cut lieben</p>
<p>why would you cut him he&rsquo;s one of the most</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>fighters in the world</p>
<p>so even if he can&rsquo;t beat anderson</p>
<p>got to keep him around even if he can</p>
<p>never beat the best guy in the</p>
<p>world which i&rsquo;m not saying he can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>never know you</p>
<p>never fucking know and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s improving and shit happens and</p>
<p>weirder things have taken</p>
<p>place in this world</p>
<p>but if even if he doesn&rsquo;t if</p>
<p>never if he can</p>
<p>never beat anderson he should</p>
<p>still be around because he&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s fucking fun as shit to watch</p>
<p>so i think that</p>
<p>about kimbo too i</p>
<p>think kimbo&rsquo;s fun to watch</p>
<p>and even though he&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the at the level</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>gino santos is or kane</p>
<p>velasquez is he&rsquo;s not at that</p>
<p>level i mean</p>
<p>you just got to</p>
<p>match them correctly</p>
<p>just just accept the fact that this guy is</p>
<p>never going to be a</p>
<p>title contender and</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s not really what the</p>
<p>ufc is all about the</p>
<p>ufc is the very best guys</p>
<p>fighting the very best guys</p>
<p>and those may be hurt</p>
<p>throwing a young</p>
<p>gun in there with a gatekeeper make kimbo a gatekeeper</p>
<p>you know make him a guy that you test</p>
<p>young guys with i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that makes it kind of interesting</p>
<p>as long as kimball wants to keep doing it</p>
<p>and if he keeps losing and then you know gets to a</p>
<p>point where nobody wants to see him anymore</p>
<p>then maybe stop using them</p>
<p>what do you have a chance</p>
<p>what do you think dana</p>
<p>white would say</p>
<p>about having a ufc</p>
<p>bar that was</p>
<p>just in the middle there was an octagon and</p>
<p>every night you just go there and there&rsquo;s just people</p>
<p>fighting constantly</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>you can have that many people</p>
<p>fighting now</p>
<p>no you know it</p>
<p>would be too hard to sanction it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be too hard to</p>
<p>ensure that everybody had the proper medicals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be too hard to find qualified</p>
<p>fighters because they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight but you know</p>
<p>i mean lieben fought</p>
<p>aaron simpson then two weeks</p>
<p>later he fought akiyama</p>
<p>very unusual and</p>
<p>for most people there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>months off in between</p>
<p>fights and a</p>
<p>lot of that is because you get beat up and you got to</p>
<p>relax and rest</p>
<p>and heal up</p>
<p>if you have any injuries they have to</p>
<p>be fixed some guys</p>
<p>break their hands some guys</p>
<p>ligaments they have to get operations you know</p>
<p>shogun just got an operation on his knee</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>if they did that in vegas</p>
<p>or something i</p>
<p>think a better</p>
<p>bar solution</p>
<p>since the ufc has this gigantic library of 116 events</p>
<p>the best idea is to</p>
<p>serve good food</p>
<p>have a cool bar</p>
<p>and have the</p>
<p>ufc planned</p>
<p>state on all</p>
<p>these different fucking</p>
<p>televisions yeah</p>
<p>a steak bar with ufc</p>
<p>everywhere and then</p>
<p>during live shows they have like huge movie</p>
<p>theaters yes</p>
<p>or they have it on</p>
<p>every goddamn tv</p>
<p>in the room</p>
<p>doing a live show they have it on</p>
<p>every goddamn tv in the room and you have to pay 20</p>
<p>bucks to get in or whatever it is and</p>
<p>damn they would</p>
<p>clean the fuck up now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to the ufc bar</p>
<p>because really it</p>
<p>would be it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really there&rsquo;s a cool</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>watching it live</p>
<p>i love watching</p>
<p>fights live because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right there when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>nothing the</p>
<p>experience is</p>
<p>nothing like anything you&rsquo;ve ever had before</p>
<p>if your seats are good</p>
<p>right but if your seats aren&rsquo;t that good</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re in the bleachers you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of cool being there still but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty fucking badass to go to a</p>
<p>place with a bunch of</p>
<p>other people and</p>
<p>watch it on tv</p>
<p>you know like having a</p>
<p>ufc bar where people</p>
<p>you know if you can&rsquo;t afford to go to</p>
<p>vegas you know you&rsquo;re living in another city</p>
<p>everybody all your friends</p>
<p>gonna go to the</p>
<p>ufc bar and</p>
<p>watch the fight</p>
<p>totally i think it</p>
<p>would be for</p>
<p>mma fans alone</p>
<p>and everything i</p>
<p>think dana could have</p>
<p>his own little menu like</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s desserts brock&rsquo;s</p>
<p>members davis</p>
<p>desserts pinkberry</p>
<p>joe rogan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ravioli ravioli</p>
<p>why do i have ravioli because you italian hey</p>
<p>that would work that would work but having live</p>
<p>fights i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>would work i think that would be a little too much</p>
<p>yeah but no seriously that ufc gym</p>
<p>you know that yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s doing good too</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know anything about it</p>
<p>pretty crazy</p>
<p>some dude facebooked me</p>
<p>from a ufc gym</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m the manager of</p>
<p>ufc gym if you&rsquo;re in town you wanna work out</p>
<p>alright buddy i think that sounds like a</p>
<p>great idea fucking do some squats at your ufc gym</p>
<p>take a goddamn tybo class</p>
<p>right i wonder what kind of classes they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>liability do you have</p>
<p>if you let dudes actually beat the shit out of each</p>
<p>other i know</p>
<p>because if you have sparring</p>
<p>the bottom line is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>extensive medicals when you have sparring like</p>
<p>when dudes sparr</p>
<p>in kickboxing</p>
<p>classes i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never taken a</p>
<p>blood test i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never taken a fucking cat scan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never never taken shit</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like any workout any gym has no</p>
<p>yeah just sign here</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not responsible good</p>
<p>dude you don&rsquo;t even sign anything at boxing gyms</p>
<p>most of them you know</p>
<p>shit damn the</p>
<p>places i&rsquo;ve worked on they&rsquo;ll just slap</p>
<p>gloves on you and you</p>
<p>climb in the</p>
<p>ring with another dude that you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>and you say</p>
<p>okay so you</p>
<p>know just go easy go easy let me see what you can do</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>throw punches with some</p>
<p>dude that you don&rsquo;t even know and you know who knows</p>
<p>most of time dudes are cool but</p>
<p>every now and then dudes will try to take your head off</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>might have an aneurysm just</p>
<p>ready to pop</p>
<p>right behind your eyeball</p>
<p>and he touches you in the chin your legs go</p>
<p>you fall you</p>
<p>hit your head on the back of the mat and that</p>
<p>thing burst and just fills your eyeballs with</p>
<p>blood and you fucking die</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible i need to go to</p>
<p>when i went to get my eyes</p>
<p>checked a while back they were like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in the back of your eye it&rsquo;s probably nothing but you</p>
<p>should take it to a doctor and like yeah</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>brain tumor</p>
<p>i know that was like ten years ago though</p>
<p>i would know it</p>
<p>right now you gotta</p>
<p>smoke a lot of weed</p>
<p>lose weight yeah</p>
<p>and where can i eat a lot of vegetables 15</p>
<p>pounds today get</p>
<p>drink my kombucha</p>

<p>watcher diet</p>
<p>which is modified meaning you taking less calories</p>
<p>well weight</p>
<p>watchers is you have this many</p>
<p>points you use them based on</p>
<p>this is the food like an orange is two</p>
<p>points you know</p>
<p>a sandwich is six</p>
<p>points whatever</p>
<p>so what i&rsquo;ve been doing is</p>
<p>doing the weight</p>
<p>watcher diet but only eating zero to one</p>
<p>point shit so mostly vegetables mostly do you um</p>
<p>do you eat like little</p>
<p>small meals to keep like your metabolism and</p>
<p>eat small meals throughout the day</p>

<p>starving yourself to</p>
<p>death totally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great no but i&rsquo;m making sure i&rsquo;m getting all</p>
<p>the nutrients and proteins and all that stuff</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve done brian</p>
<p>just for fyi</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve known why is your</p>
<p>phone on that&rsquo;s not me is it</p>
<p>alerts you getting alerts</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>brian he&rsquo;s done this like five times</p>
<p>where he got</p>
<p>heavy and then he got</p>
<p>skinny he got</p>
<p>heavy yo yo dieting is one of the safest</p>
<p>ways to to long</p>
<p>jiviate your life longevity</p>
<p>he went from you were up at like</p>
<p>how hot was the heaviest you were ever at two forty</p>
<p>three two forty</p>
<p>three and by the way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how tall are you five</p>
<p>eight five eight okay 243 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>giant he was a fat guy</p>
<p>his legs used to</p>
<p>touch together in the middle</p>
<p>he had to wear</p>
<p>crazy pants</p>
<p>his pants were always way too long</p>
<p>because his</p>
<p>waist and his butt were way too big for</p>
<p>pants that were that long</p>
<p>so they had</p>
<p>his pants were always like</p>
<p>shuffling and then</p>
<p>this guy got dumped by his</p>
<p>girlfriend and went fiance</p>
<p>fiance sorry</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more devastating</p>
<p>than just a</p>
<p>girlfriend right</p>
<p>seven years</p>
<p>they were together for a long time it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>devastating and he went on a goddamn weight watcher</p>
<p>elliptical machine rampage</p>
<p>and over the course of how long</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>you lost like 70</p>
<p>pounds right i was 1</p>
<p>63 was the lowest i got then i</p>
<p>decided to and that was in</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s so unhealthy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so unhealthy dude</p>
<p>you basically</p>
<p>starved yourself</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>pictures of yourself</p>
<p>when you were that skinny</p>
<p>do you have anything that would</p>
<p>shock the people at home yeah i do</p>
<p>actually i have something really just pulled that up so</p>
<p>i can take a look at that because it was really strange</p>
<p>it turns out</p>
<p>brian has a weird head</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t know because it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>embraced in</p>
<p>a row of soft tissue</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get to see the true</p>
<p>shape of his head</p>
<p>but when you just see</p>
<p>skinny brian</p>
<p>skinny brian is a strange dude i don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>nationality he is he looks like he&rsquo;s a fucking alien</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll find it</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s kenny bryant</p>
<p>what we got to do is we got to make your neck</p>
<p>build up this to</p>
<p>match your head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>you know you can have a big head</p>
<p>as long as you have a big neck to support that big head</p>
<p>right you got</p>
<p>a big head son and you don&rsquo;t have a big neck</p>
<p>and that shit looks strange</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>your head is used to be your body being gigantic</p>
<p>right so what you got to do is</p>
<p>you got to build</p>
<p>your neck up you know that&rsquo;s one of the most popular</p>
<p>things in hollywood though for actors to</p>
<p>make exercises they want you to have a big head</p>
<p>what is that about</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a more more</p>
<p>brains thing</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t be true</p>
<p>cause i know some people with big heads are</p>
<p>stupid as fuck</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a picture of me</p>
<p>holding my old</p>
<p>pants up wow</p>

<p>later today well</p>
<p>when you do i&rsquo;ll retweet it</p>
<p>cause i know people are fucking</p>
<p>excited to see</p>
<p>what you look like when you look strange there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>picture i have that&rsquo;s just so scary</p>
<p>but what was interesting is when you became</p>
<p>went from being a fat guy to a</p>
<p>skinny guy you also</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re attractive</p>
<p>and you started getting girls</p>

<p>you did not look like you had aids i</p>
<p>swear you never looked</p>

<p>he has it backwards he has the</p>
<p>tiniest head ever it&rsquo;s a very small head</p>
<p>and all i can</p>
<p>think of when i&rsquo;m next to him is</p>

<p>punch this guy in his tiny little head</p>
<p>like you could just</p>
<p>crush his head he&rsquo;s got a bird head</p>

<p>lesbian right</p>
<p>brian that&rsquo;s what you look like god damn it you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>lesbian underneath it all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you look like when you&rsquo;re thin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious but i don&rsquo;t want to be a gay</p>
<p>lesbian but</p>
<p>how come you can&rsquo;t stay</p>
<p>the same way</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you like</p>
<p>monitor your weight and you see it go up and what</p>
<p>do you do what&rsquo;s the process when you see it going up</p>
<p>what keeps you</p>
<p>from just recognizing</p>
<p>that and cutting back on your food</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not even a cutback at food it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i have the metabolism of a</p>
<p>small goat where i</p>
<p>eat small goats are</p>
<p>skinny as fuck</p>
<p>dude what are you talking</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re lean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible example</p>
<p>i meant backwards</p>
<p>you have a metabolism of</p>
<p>fat person yeah that&rsquo;s what i mean i fucking eat like</p>
<p>two pieces of</p>
<p>pizza again</p>
<p>so if you just gave up</p>
<p>and just were a</p>
<p>sedentary fuck and had a normal nine to</p>
<p>five job we</p>
<p>ate shit at the office and</p>
<p>ate shit for lunch</p>
<p>and then you came home you were too</p>
<p>tired to work and you</p>
<p>ate and then</p>
<p>watch tv you just be a</p>
<p>giant fat huge i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>crazy huge i wonder how many my</p>
<p>grandmother was like six hundred pounds</p>
<p>on my dad&rsquo;s side really yeah she was humongous diabetes</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary yeah my dad said</p>
<p>yeah i wonder</p>
<p>how many dudes who are like that have like a hormonal</p>
<p>imbalance a thyroid imbalance or something that</p>
<p>could be corrected well it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>why he&rsquo;s got mine</p>
<p>checked and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m supposedly fine whatever the</p>
<p>thyroids fine yeah but</p>
<p>check your testosterone</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>non detective</p>
<p>i saw this not saw i was listening to</p>
<p>sirius satellite</p>
<p>radio the other day and one of the</p>
<p>things they were saying about</p>
<p>guys who gain a lot of weight</p>
<p>is a lot of</p>
<p>times it&rsquo;s just some sort of a hormone imbalance</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe a testosterone imbalance</p>
<p>they could cure it with like some</p>
<p>cream yeah but when i just get more hairier</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need that anymore listen</p>
<p>bitch what are you</p>
<p>gonna take care</p>
<p>and have some fucking energy</p>
<p>and and not</p>
<p>become fat i</p>
<p>should get that</p>
<p>checked honestly</p>
<p>cause i bet you i&rsquo;m fucking no you</p>
<p>tired all the time i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired from when i wake i wake up in the morning i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired guarantee you and</p>
<p>especially because you don&rsquo;t do anything that</p>
<p>forces your body to produce it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not involved in any</p>
<p>heavy lifting or anything</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s one of the most important</p>
<p>things when you&rsquo;re maintaining your health as you get</p>
<p>older you have to do strength training</p>
<p>you have to do</p>
<p>training that makes your body constantly regenerate</p>
<p>tissue keep your glands pumping</p>
<p>when i wake up i really feel</p>
<p>tired like i</p>
<p>never have woken up and like wow</p>
<p>i have sleep</p>
<p>apnea to man i probably have</p>
<p>you snore yeah</p>
<p>chicks tell you snore</p>
<p>yeah you ever</p>
<p>like gag in your</p>
<p>sleep i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>well you should get tested man</p>
<p>i got a new</p>
<p>mouthpiece that i</p>
<p>started wearing you know because i got diagnosed with</p>
<p>sleep apnea a few years ago</p>
<p>and when the</p>
<p>doctor created this</p>
<p>mouthpiece it&rsquo;s got dr coropian and tarzana</p>
<p>he created some</p>
<p>a mouthpiece</p>
<p>that keeps your tongue down and the problem is</p>
<p>i have a big tongue and</p>
<p>my my neck is big from working out all the time</p>
<p>and my hold that i have in the back of my</p>
<p>throat it&rsquo;s not so big</p>
<p>and so when i lie down my tongue falls back as i</p>
<p>relax and covers over the fucking hole</p>
<p>and i gag and cough</p>
<p>like a lot of times it&rsquo;s fat people fat people have it</p>
<p>but athletes have it a lot too</p>
<p>anybody who has</p>
<p>like a big neck if you have a big tongue it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna happen to you</p>
<p>so this mouthpiece kind of keeps</p>
<p>your tongue down well he just invented a new one i just</p>
<p>started using this new one</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>i wake up i feel so fucking rested</p>
<p>mrs rogan says i don&rsquo;t snore at all anymore</p>
<p>and i feel so much better and my dreams are</p>
<p>super vivid man my</p>
<p>dreams are really intense</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really like very very lifelike to the</p>
<p>point where sometimes my</p>
<p>alarm goes off in mid dream</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like wow that was a</p>
<p>dream cause it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even like</p>
<p>crazy dreams they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dreams like life dreams</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very strange they don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>dream like feel to them they feel like</p>
<p>dropped another</p>
<p>level below</p>
<p>in my depth of my sleeping</p>
<p>you know and so i&rsquo;m having these</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;m reaching a rem</p>
<p>level that i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reaching before</p>
<p>because i was snoring all the time because i</p>
<p>would choke and i have this</p>
<p>sleep apnea</p>
<p>problem because even the</p>
<p>mouthpiece didn&rsquo;t totally cure it it</p>
<p>definitely made it better</p>
<p>right but i</p>
<p>still snored</p>
<p>this new one i don&rsquo;t snore at all</p>
<p>is that a picture of you and jenna</p>
<p>jameson yeah</p>
<p>when she was what</p>
<p>when we were in arizona yeah</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s the goal now you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>195 and what&rsquo;s your goal trying to get to</p>
<p>165 yeah you</p>
<p>should get your hormones</p>
<p>checked out son</p>
<p>you might have problems i should</p>
<p>you know they can</p>
<p>one thing you can do</p>
<p>things to cure it but one of the</p>
<p>things that works is</p>
<p>squats squats and</p>
<p>heavy lifting</p>
<p>makes your body</p>
<p>produce more testosterone</p>
<p>makes your body produce more growth hormone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very good for you but</p>
<p>you gotta not be a pussy</p>
<p>you gotta actually do em yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t seem like the type of dude that&rsquo;s really into</p>
<p>what straining i just</p>
<p>seem like the energy i have per day</p>
<p>is so small that</p>
<p>you look at it yeah</p>
<p>like i feel like i am</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m barely trying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m barely trying not to go back to sleep</p>
<p>damn dude you really need to get yourself</p>
<p>checked out yeah what if you have a real</p>
<p>issue that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>do but if i had it it&rsquo;s been i&rsquo;ve had it my</p>
<p>whole life hmm</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>fucking goddamn kids get off my lawn</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t looked at the photo</p>
<p>the the questions on</p>
<p>on twitter and forever oh</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>thing that i did last week that i forgot about</p>
<p>i actually gave my phone number out on twitter yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with that</p>
<p>i fucked up royally i gave my</p>
<p>phone number out</p>
<p>i gave it to doug benson cause doug was gonna come to</p>
<p>vegas this weekend</p>
<p>and he wanted to come hang out with us at the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>and i said yeah man i said i can even get you into the</p>
<p>ufc here&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my phone number</p>
<p>me and i put it in the main twitter box</p>
<p>instead of the</p>
<p>direct message box i thought i was sending a</p>
<p>direct message</p>
<p>so i tweeted my fucking number to the whole</p>
<p>world so i was like god damn it and then it just</p>
<p>started vibrating</p>
<p>and vibrating and the calls were just coming in like</p>
<p>they never stopped it was like one after the</p>
<p>other cause</p>
<p>you know when you have</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got 130 something</p>
<p>thousand twitter friends and who knows how many 10</p>
<p>maybe 10 000</p>
<p>might have seen it i</p>
<p>tried to delete it but it was too late it was out there</p>
<p>and so then as i was driving to the verizon</p>
<p>store to go change my number</p>
<p>i just started answering</p>
<p>phone calls like what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>is this joe rogan</p>
<p>like yeah man what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on what are you doing</p>
<p>might come on my way to the verizon</p>
<p>store i&rsquo;m just turning in my phone</p>
<p>i have to i</p>
<p>would answer it here for you guys and show you</p>
<p>but i have verizon</p>
<p>and verizon</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work here</p>
<p>where i live you know</p>
<p>but i did it all week i accepted as a family you</p>
<p>did act very nice though you could have</p>
<p>told all those</p>
<p>morons who called you and ruined your</p>
<p>phone number you</p>
<p>could have just posted all</p>
<p>those online and fuck them</p>
<p>you know but you were nice</p>
<p>about you took the high road</p>
<p>well what are they doing they&rsquo;re just look</p>
<p>i fucked up it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna take it away it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna be so cool</p>
<p>that no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna call you on that</p>
<p>would not be</p>
<p>great though if everyone was cool</p>
<p>no because some of the people just want to call to</p>
<p>say hi why not if you were eighteen years old</p>
<p>and you you&rsquo;re a fan of some dude and also he&rsquo;s got his</p>
<p>phone number online</p>
<p>and you call him and he actually answers like holy shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most of the</p>
<p>calls most of the calls were people saying holy shit</p>
<p>and they were all cool</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about fader or losing is he out of the</p>
<p>ufc managers</p>
<p>never gonna</p>
<p>bring them in now</p>
<p>and all these conversations about</p>
<p>fucking had conversations</p>
<p>about comedy</p>
<p>i conversations</p>
<p>about about</p>
<p>mma i had a</p>
<p>bunch of different conversations</p>
<p>about all kinds of shit and i was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna keep this</p>
<p>phone fuck it</p>
<p>so i kept it</p>
<p>as a fan line you want to call it i really do answer it</p>
<p>not all the time</p>
<p>but i pick it up</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>eight one eight five one</p>
<p>seven two seven</p>
<p>seven four that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>phone number that&rsquo;s my fan line now i</p>
<p>agree with that number</p>
<p>i know that was like a real number right</p>
<p>like shit he&rsquo;s giving out</p>
<p>the real number</p>
<p>i thought that</p>
<p>would be kind</p>
<p>of cooler too to actually give out the real number</p>
<p>instead of getting</p>
<p>another number and making it my fan line</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like actually</p>
<p>kinda cool that</p>
<p>you actually have my real number i mean that&rsquo;s like my</p>
<p>legit number that i&rsquo;ve had for fucking a decade right</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my number and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the deal this weekend</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be at the ontario improv</p>
<p>with the one and only joey coco</p>
<p>diaz and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a lot of fun</p>
<p>ontario is a badass club it&rsquo;s selling out quickly so</p>
<p>if you want</p>
<p>to get in i know a lot of people got shut out in irvine</p>
<p>i talked to a lot of people that were</p>
<p>disappointed and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i didn&rsquo;t get in but</p>
<p>you know these clubs they only seat like 300 people so</p>
<p>if you want to come to a show</p>
<p>especially like the fridays</p>
<p>shows and the saturday shows you</p>
<p>know sunday sometimes a little easier because you got</p>
<p>less people are out doing</p>
<p>things but friday and saturday</p>
<p>those fucking tickets so quick</p>
<p>irvine was awesome irvine</p>
<p>last weekend</p>
<p>every show sold out</p>
<p>every show was</p>
<p>cool people were cool as fuck it was awesome</p>
<p>and then house of blues was awesome too</p>
<p>although i did get a todd too</p>
<p>drunk just a</p>
<p>touch yeah what happened one shot over the line not</p>
<p>too bad cause i didn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>nothing it was nothing bad the show was</p>
<p>great but i</p>
<p>definitely got too drunk</p>
<p>and i told the</p>
<p>second half of a joke twice</p>
<p>is because i didn&rsquo;t tell the</p>
<p>first half of it</p>
<p>right the first time</p>
<p>so i tried to like redo it and i</p>
<p>and then i realized</p>
<p>as i was saying it i was like i already said this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it does that suck to you</p>
<p>it does but i just</p>
<p>admit it you</p>
<p>admit it like i immediately</p>
<p>just stop and</p>
<p>admit it i just</p>
<p>said what happened</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>point it out i go</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>but i did it because i fucked up this part of it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a good enough answer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the answer really is i was</p>
<p>drunk that&rsquo;s the answer i mean i&rsquo;m saying what i did</p>
<p>wrong but the only reason why i did it</p>
<p>again is because i was</p>
<p>drunk right</p>
<p>i just i didn&rsquo;t have anything to eat</p>
<p>and i had like</p>
<p>three shots in a row on stage</p>
<p>which is two shots too many</p>
<p>but still it was a</p>
<p>still fun fucking</p>
<p>fun like really</p>
<p>happy crowd they were cool sam tripoli was hilarious</p>
<p>yeah sam was awesome he crushed it it was really good</p>
<p>yeah that place could go either way you</p>
<p>know sometimes the ufc knights that place is</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>house of blues is just a madhouse well we fixed</p>
<p>it we fixed it we fixed it when we got real</p>
<p>standing only that</p>
<p>changed the vibe of it so much</p>
<p>because people were uncomfortable</p>
<p>before and you felt that uncomfort from them</p>
<p>because the fact they had to</p>
<p>stand and watch a show</p>
<p>and i made a lot more</p>
<p>money than on</p>
<p>those shows but i don&rsquo;t care i don&rsquo;t want people to</p>
<p>stand up i think it sucks</p>
<p>when we saw</p>
<p>stand up we saw</p>
<p>stand hope rather that shit cured me</p>
<p>no more stand up shows i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never make someone pay to see me</p>
<p>stand up ever again</p>
<p>we fucked up in memphis</p>
<p>joey and i did a show in memphis and</p>
<p>it had to be</p>
<p>stand up because it was a really tiny place and</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand i would only seated like</p>
<p>100 people and all</p>
<p>these people were</p>
<p>standing up by the bar</p>
<p>so half the</p>
<p>crowd was standing</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>all talking at full</p>
<p>voice like bar</p>
<p>voice like no one was like</p>
<p>paying attention to the show</p>
<p>when joey went on</p>
<p>stage no one</p>
<p>was like maybe 10</p>
<p>of the people in the bar</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t talking</p>
<p>it was just a low rumble</p>
<p>and then i was like okay this is the</p>
<p>final straw i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never have a</p>
<p>standing room show ever it&rsquo;s not fun to watch man</p>
<p>the part of what is good</p>
<p>about a show is you can kick back and relax</p>
<p>what would be awesome is if</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>place you went had real comfortable seats</p>
<p>if you could sit on a</p>
<p>couch like this</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s how you watched</p>
<p>every comedy show</p>
<p>kicking back and</p>
<p>chilling on a couch</p>
<p>how fucking it</p>
<p>would be way funnier</p>
<p>because you be feeling</p>
<p>relaxed you have no tension it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to</p>
<p>laugh at shit</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing your fucking feet hurt that sucks</p>
<p>first person i ever</p>
<p>heard say that was</p>
<p>jimmy norton</p>
<p>and i heard</p>
<p>jimmy talking</p>
<p>about it he was</p>
<p>promoting one of his shows</p>
<p>and it was talking about</p>
<p>you know people were calling in and saying that they</p>
<p>heard there were</p>
<p>standing tickets in the back and</p>
<p>jimmy was like no no no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>my show is a</p>
<p>standing show</p>
<p>and i was like wow he&rsquo;s like real adamant</p>
<p>about that but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was that big of a deal i&rsquo;m like well</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>rigid with his</p>
<p>style or something and he wants to make it like that</p>
<p>but then i you know</p>
<p>i realized that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right thing to do</p>
<p>those standing shows the stanhope</p>
<p>shows i mean they&rsquo;re fun and</p>
<p>everything but it&rsquo;s not as fun</p>
<p>yeah to me i don&rsquo;t know it was my</p>
<p>age or what the</p>
<p>whole time i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>focusing on the pain of my</p>
<p>standing like</p>
<p>how uncomfortable it was it&rsquo;s not an age</p>
<p>thing man i didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>standing up with a concrete</p>
<p>floor when i was 10 yeah</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>when i worked at gateway i had to do it</p>
<p>eight hours and</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t allowed to sit down</p>
<p>throughout the day so you</p>
<p>would find the thickest</p>
<p>shoes and then you put the best</p>
<p>inserts in that shit&rsquo;s not good for</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you know your body&rsquo;s supposed to be moving around too</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when i do stand up and i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage for an hour and a half or whatever i&rsquo;m on for it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m never hurt</p>
<p>i feel fine i get off i get off i feel</p>
<p>energized but</p>
<p>standing in one</p>
<p>place and not</p>
<p>moving at all for an hour and a half that sucks</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re carrying your weight you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think about it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>moving you don&rsquo;t even get</p>
<p>blood flowing through it and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right next to</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stretch your arms out</p>
<p>move your body and</p>
<p>touch your toes and shit</p>
<p>like if you don&rsquo;t do that man your body feels like shit</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why i don&rsquo;t like doing comedy too much in bars anymore</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do it every now and then just for a goof just to</p>
<p>experience something different get to get a different</p>
<p>taste of comedy you know do like a little</p>
<p>shitty little hollywood gigs</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>again but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very important the right</p>
<p>atmosphere has to be set</p>
<p>you know the same</p>
<p>atmosphere that&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>music it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>atmosphere that&rsquo;s good for comedy</p>
<p>you know music you</p>
<p>could go up and people</p>
<p>could be talking like how&rsquo;s everybody doing out there</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>play your song man you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>their attention</p>
<p>a hundred percent</p>
<p>their complete interaction</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t require that you don&rsquo;t require a response</p>
<p>a definite response you know from them</p>
<p>comedy though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricky very tricky</p>
<p>setting up the</p>
<p>atmosphere is so tricky</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>i always go on the road</p>
<p>with dudes who i</p>
<p>think are funny</p>
<p>i always go on the road with friends it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>the worst thing you</p>
<p>could ever do is go on the</p>
<p>road and a guy opens for you and the guy fucking sucks</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t just suck he like sucks like</p>
<p>aggressively</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>bad material</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like badly done</p>
<p>and like the totally different</p>
<p>crowd that you</p>
<p>would have you know that he</p>
<p>would have normally</p>
<p>yeah most of them</p>
<p>would never have a</p>
<p>crowd at all yeah</p>
<p>really bad ones yeah</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been one of</p>
<p>those really</p>
<p>bad ones by the way i&rsquo;m not shitting on them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i mean it&rsquo;s part of the development process</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing this book that i&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>about a lot of my</p>
<p>early comedy days</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making me rehash</p>
<p>old bombing</p>
<p>stories that i forgot of</p>
<p>terrible fucking disastrous tales of the road</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fucking crazy</p>
<p>you know but a lot of it was just</p>
<p>cause i sucked</p>
<p>i was just terrible i didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>relax back then i didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>do comedy yet i was really just fucking feeling it out</p>
<p>which is fine and good you know and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing you have to go through but i don&rsquo;t want people</p>
<p>going through it before i get up on stage</p>
<p>because if they do it</p>
<p>right before you it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>taints the whole room</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like someone just came on</p>
<p>stage and just shit into</p>
<p>their minds you know</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re forced to like</p>
<p>clean everything up and</p>
<p>start from scratch</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you have to like do damage control you know yeah</p>
<p>so weird at</p>
<p>this comic i know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think 20 years old</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just the nicest</p>
<p>guy little kid ever you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always you</p>
<p>know asking for advice to like ari and me and</p>
<p>stuff like that just</p>
<p>a really nice guy and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell him</p>
<p>how just how nice this guy is</p>
<p>did you fuck him</p>
<p>what did you</p>
<p>say no no well</p>
<p>he just said that told me the</p>
<p>other day that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like lead role</p>
<p>in like a real</p>
<p>movie now and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to go from this nice</p>
<p>nice little open mic</p>

<p>gonna be like lead role in a</p>
<p>movie and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>movie or that</p>
<p>kind of well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a think it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>movie it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what it is it&rsquo;s supposed to be like a cloverfield</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like at a</p>
<p>party with like</p>
<p>generation x guys or whatever</p>
<p>generous and it becomes a</p>
<p>monster movie</p>
<p>no no how it&rsquo;s like recorded like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like like cell</p>
<p>phones cell</p>
<p>phones like that</p>
<p>you know what man i&rsquo;m not buying that anymore</p>
<p>i bought that shit with like the</p>
<p>i thought it was kind of interesting the blair</p>
<p>witch project</p>
<p>how they did that i thought that was a good movie</p>
<p>i mean it was really like for what it was</p>
<p>when we saw the blair</p>
<p>witch project the</p>
<p>first time i saw it</p>
<p>was we were in houston and</p>
<p>chris mcguire and i were working at the last stop</p>
<p>and this was way back in the day</p>
<p>whenever it came out</p>
<p>and this dude</p>
<p>who worked at the</p>
<p>movie theater across the street</p>
<p>came to the show</p>
<p>and after the show we&rsquo;re all hanging out and</p>
<p>smoking weed</p>
<p>and the dude goes hey do you guys want to go</p>
<p>watch the blair</p>
<p>witch project</p>
<p>right now we can all</p>
<p>watch it like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll set it up i got the keys we&rsquo;ll turn it on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like get</p>
<p>the fuck out of here are you serious he&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>so it was like a midnight show okay</p>
<p>so we went over there at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>and this dude had the keys unlock the</p>
<p>place we got popcorn and shit</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>him the dude</p>
<p>he worked there a couple</p>
<p>other people that worked with him like a guy and a girl</p>
<p>and me and chris maguire</p>
<p>says five of us and we</p>
<p>watched the blair</p>
<p>witch project and was badass yeah</p>
<p>was the perfect way to watch it</p>
<p>freaked me out the</p>
<p>second time i</p>
<p>watched it it was terrible did not work</p>
<p>not only did it not work</p>
<p>there was some dude who brought his baby</p>
<p>and this fucking</p>
<p>mexican dude and his baby was making all this</p>
<p>noise who&rsquo;s like two</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>you know so a</p>
<p>bunch of people like shush</p>
<p>dumb and he got</p>
<p>aggressive with the people fuck you</p>
<p>bitch don&rsquo;t fucking shush me bitch</p>
<p>and i was like okay now i have to fucking</p>
<p>think about this guy and his fucking inconsiderate</p>
<p>ways and he&rsquo;s got a baby and people trying to shush him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s you know fucking</p>
<p>yelling at them</p>
<p>obscenities</p>
<p>and threatening them i&rsquo;ll fucking kick your ass</p>
<p>bitch and that kind of shit</p>
<p>so now you gotta think</p>
<p>about him for the fucking</p>
<p>movie or so it was a bad experience</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t really like</p>
<p>going to movies anymore</p>
<p>so roll the dice</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>especially when</p>
<p>nowadays it&rsquo;s like i can get a blu ray i can wait</p>
<p>i can wait six</p>
<p>months and that</p>
<p>the experience at my</p>
<p>house now is better than</p>
<p>i think going to a</p>
<p>movie yeah if you have a nice good size tv</p>
<p>and you know you got a good size</p>
<p>sound system plus</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry i can</p>
<p>get pee breaks</p>
<p>i can fucking smoke weed</p>
<p>yeah you can have whatever food you want you can</p>
<p>have a comfortable</p>
<p>couch to watch on it&rsquo;s a way better experience</p>
<p>people like the event of being out there with</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>you know people like that&rsquo;s what one of</p>
<p>things people like</p>
<p>about a concert</p>
<p>you know a fucking</p>
<p>ozzy osbourne</p>
<p>was playing just to you and it was just you and ozzy</p>
<p>alone with his band in a room</p>
<p>you probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even want to be there</p>
<p>right you know maybe like</p>
<p>maybe listen to a song or two you be like this is</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s looking me in the eyes and singing fucking</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to look at you you&rsquo;re the only one there</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>one of 15 000 in an</p>
<p>arena then it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s fun that&rsquo;s crazy but</p>
<p>i think movie theaters need to reboot man</p>
<p>i think they need to stop going hey</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re charging you 14</p>
<p>for tickets 8</p>
<p>for a popcorn 5</p>
<p>for a pop i think they need to it</p>
<p>is kind of fucked that you have to pay that much just</p>
<p>to watch it</p>
<p>whereas if you want to own it</p>
<p>like 30 bucks in a few</p>
<p>months not even</p>
<p>that you can get a best buy for 14 99 on dvd</p>
<p>you know 12 99 not blu ray though</p>
<p>right blu ray</p>
<p>30 bucks sometimes opening week or first</p>
<p>week you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have it on sale for like 17</p>
<p>yeah if you</p>
<p>watch something blu ray it&rsquo;s so much better</p>
<p>so much more comfortable</p>
<p>watching shit at home yeah</p>
<p>this i watched the wolfman</p>
<p>the other day</p>
<p>again yeah i</p>
<p>watched it again</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even like it it&rsquo;s a terrible</p>
<p>movie but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s dope</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s at home</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>home i like it yeah it&rsquo;s not bad when i saw in the</p>
<p>movie theater i&rsquo;m like i paid for this fucking</p>
<p>stupid movie this</p>
<p>movie&rsquo;s retarded yeah</p>
<p>what do i say that was pretty good oh</p>
<p>the crazies</p>
<p>crazy dude the crazies</p>
<p>this good goddamn</p>
<p>horror movie really yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna tell you the premise</p>
<p>cause i didn&rsquo;t know a thing</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give you the blu ray i got it up here oh cool</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know a thing</p>
<p>about it i knew nothing</p>
<p>but someone had said this is a really</p>
<p>scary movie someone twittered it so i</p>
<p>might check it out</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i love when i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about a movie i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know nothing i didn&rsquo;t i hadn&rsquo;t seen a single preview</p>
<p>i saw a photo</p>
<p>with a guy with a</p>
<p>pitchfork that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i know</p>
<p>so like okay some</p>
<p>crazy shit obviously</p>
<p>guys killing people with a</p>
<p>pitchfork right</p>
<p>great movie</p>
<p>i mean not the best</p>
<p>movie in the world but</p>
<p>a good goddamn horror</p>
<p>movie good solid</p>
<p>holy shit horror movie</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;m like why wasn&rsquo;t this</p>
<p>movie popular</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t this</p>
<p>movie go somewhere in the</p>
<p>movie theater</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty fucking good</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>a thing about it did you hear anything about it</p>
<p>i just remember the advertise</p>
<p>or the advertising</p>
<p>how they advertised it</p>
<p>the last airbender i have not seen it you know why</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not fooling me</p>
<p>again you fuck</p>
<p>m night shamalama ding dong</p>
<p>your movies are</p>
<p>goddamn terrible sir i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>happy internet</p>
<p>internet sat there when he had zero percent of rotten</p>
<p>tomatoes is like yes this is hilarious i</p>
<p>know he had 0</p>
<p>of rotten tomatoes for a long time</p>
<p>like six now or</p>
<p>seven or something</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a few percent now there&rsquo;s a few fools out there</p>
<p>or some staff members from</p>
<p>tonight shamalama ding dongs fucking</p>
<p>but what makes me even</p>
<p>more angry is that the fact that the opposite</p>
<p>is happening with toy story 3</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>movie i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>angriest person in the</p>
<p>world you&rsquo;ll sit there and you&rsquo;ll go at least</p>
<p>yeah that was a good movie</p>
<p>those pixar</p>
<p>movies are always good man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so good at it one bad one i</p>
<p>think there</p>
<p>was one or two bad ones and it was just like</p>
<p>really i wanna meet</p>
<p>these people and go</p>
<p>what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>are you really</p>
<p>that angry of a person or</p>
<p>are you somebody from a different</p>
<p>movie studio just being a dick you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of that</p>
<p>a lot of espionage and fucking double</p>
<p>crossing online</p>
<p>for sure a lot of positive comments as well by paid</p>
<p>shills you know people accuse the</p>
<p>ufc of doing that all the time on the</p>
<p>underground people are saying how many of you guys are</p>
<p>paid ufc shills</p>
<p>as far as i know there are none but there</p>
<p>might be i might just not know</p>
<p>about them it</p>
<p>might very well be that they hire people to</p>
<p>get online i mean it&rsquo;s effective</p>
<p>marketing if you</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>get online you hype up a</p>
<p>fight you start talking</p>
<p>you instigate comments you know</p>
<p>do you think that you know</p>
<p>shane would have been</p>
<p>knocked out by brett</p>
<p>rogers you know or that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>i bet lesnar</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>knocked out by brett</p>
<p>rogers like</p>
<p>sometimes it is</p>
<p>i know it is</p>
<p>i know but i</p>
<p>know in the</p>
<p>pride days they</p>
<p>used to do that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a lot of people also that&rsquo;s all they think yes</p>
<p>that is true but but</p>
<p>as far as like</p>
<p>as far as like putting together threads and pushing</p>
<p>positive threads and talking</p>
<p>about how excited you are for something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good move</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart move you know if you get a good thread together</p>
<p>amazon&rsquo;s reviews are that</p>
<p>yeah well i pay attention to amazon&rsquo;s reviews</p>
<p>half of it could be</p>
<p>total bullshit</p>
<p>i even try to read it to say okay does this</p>
<p>sound like something like a publicist made or</p>
<p>the company made</p>
<p>no one can stop you from doing that you</p>
<p>could review the shit out of your own stuff</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never done that with anything i&rsquo;ve ever done i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done that but</p>
<p>i was pleasantly surprised at how</p>
<p>many cool fucking comments i got on the itunes thing</p>
<p>i thought when i was</p>
<p>going over the podcast i&rsquo;m like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a</p>
<p>bunch of douchebags that don&rsquo;t want to hear us</p>
<p>yapping about</p>
<p>things because this</p>
<p>is kind of a free form podcast a lot of times we talk</p>
<p>about the same subjects we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about before</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re relevant to the current conversation i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i gotta assume that each one of</p>
<p>these two hour</p>
<p>things is its own thing</p>
<p>i try not to repeat</p>
<p>things as much as possible but</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also just hard to remember</p>
<p>you know what was 28 times two</p>
<p>you know how many</p>
<p>hours is that of trying to</p>
<p>but i also think that we get into subjects a lot deeper</p>
<p>than you can if you&rsquo;re just doing an hour podcast</p>
<p>you know i like the hour podcast format but i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about really intense conversations or</p>
<p>we have these cool conversations you</p>
<p>gotta let them kind of take</p>
<p>their fucking path</p>
<p>you know and sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like well this is it we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna stop it now</p>
<p>but you know there&rsquo;s more shit to be talked about</p>
<p>but so many fucking people who said</p>
<p>things on the itunes</p>
<p>were cool there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of complaints</p>
<p>about the sound</p>
<p>which we did have problems with the</p>
<p>sound but we</p>
<p>fixed all that shit and if you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s too low stop listening it on your iphone</p>
<p>speaker phone it&rsquo;s low for everything</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>upset with this</p>
<p>well some guys said</p>
<p>how low it was and so today i</p>
<p>recorded myself</p>
<p>going on like</p>
<p>adam corollas</p>
<p>you know a couple of them and then ours i</p>
<p>think we got the</p>
<p>loudest this is good now</p>
<p>we mean and i</p>
<p>think this is the</p>
<p>right way to do it too because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard things</p>
<p>where people talk on live mics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>quite as loud or clear</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>radio stations use</p>
<p>these kind of mics and</p>
<p>stand up comedy use this kind of mics and</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>right shit to use</p>
<p>so this is the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to keep it</p>
<p>as far as like</p>
<p>putting up this</p>
<p>green screen i kind of gave up on that shit</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s distracting</p>
<p>i might put up</p>
<p>a banner or something</p>
<p>maybe put up a big</p>
<p>flat screen and</p>
<p>have a constantly</p>
<p>changing logo</p>
<p>make you you can put together some nutty</p>
<p>video and i&rsquo;ll be playing in the</p>
<p>background we think</p>
<p>good move just</p>
<p>show ideas on a toilet but i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve given up on the idea of us being in</p>
<p>space looking like a</p>
