    <p>hi friends how are you today</p>

<p>about it I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day today</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s matter mystery makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down I talk</p>
<p>about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>heavy and I do my makeup where I just get</p>
<p>ready for my</p>
<p>day at the same time if you are interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup I</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>all right before we hop in today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story I do need to add a disclaimer</p>
<p>yes I do warning</p>
<p>the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains graphic</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue</p>
<p>and strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion</p>
<p>is advised but</p>
<p>other than that yes let&rsquo;s just hop</p>
<p>jump and skip</p>
<p>skadoodle right into it I have gotten</p>
<p>requested a lot to do this</p>
<p>story I kinda was</p>
<p>avoiding it</p>
<p>because I try to</p>
<p>avoid stories that are</p>
<p>super well known</p>
<p>just because I feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been told so many times what else can I add to the</p>
<p>story you know</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m doing it anyways</p>
<p>I like to give in to you guys his name</p>
<p>is Richard Ramirez</p>
<p>AKA the Night</p>
<p>Stalker so Richard was one of 5 children and his</p>
<p>father was a former police officer who was working in</p>
<p>juarez Mexico</p>
<p>here it comes but he</p>
<p>ended up leaving Mexico and he went to work on the</p>
<p>Santa Fe railroad the</p>
<p>whole family relocated to</p>
<p>Texas so his father was a very hard working man</p>
<p>and was determined just to provide for his family as</p>
<p>you know a parent should</p>
<p>but he was prone to</p>
<p>bursts of anger</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>often physically</p>
<p>abuse his wife and his children</p>
<p>it was like a very</p>
<p>toxic environment</p>
<p>a very ANGRY</p>
<p>angry FATHER at the</p>
<p>age of 2 Richard was</p>
<p>struck in the head with like a falling</p>
<p>piece of furniture</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound that bad</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>furniture is so dangerous</p>
<p>but this falling</p>
<p>piece of furniture</p>
<p>ended up cutting a big gash in his head on his forehead</p>
<p>and then when he was 5 years old he was</p>
<p>struck again</p>
<p>in the head</p>
<p>with a swing at school</p>
<p>and he was knocked</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>and Richard</p>
<p>would say from that point on</p>
<p>he suffered from</p>
<p>seizures side note</p>
<p>if any of you have been paying attention to</p>
<p>these back stories</p>
<p>now mind you</p>
<p>these back stories have a lot of</p>
<p>consistencies a lot of</p>
<p>things in common</p>
<p>right usually</p>
<p>the killer or the murderer the bad guy or girl</p>
<p>suffered from some kind of or was a</p>
<p>victim of some kind of</p>
<p>abuse at a young</p>
<p>age but also</p>
<p>there is another theme tends to happen in</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>do you know what it is</p>
<p>well you should</p>
<p>cause I just talked</p>
<p>about it a head injury</p>
<p>last week we talked</p>
<p>about Randy</p>
<p>Craft head injury</p>
<p>Edmund Kemper</p>
<p>head injury ed Geen</p>
<p>head injury Gary</p>
<p>Hyde nick remember him I talked</p>
<p>about him a while ago</p>
<p>head injury</p>
<p>John Wayne Gacy</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t talked</p>
<p>about him here yet but he was the</p>
<p>clown dude boo</p>
<p>head injury</p>
<p>and the list goes on there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>right is that not interesting to you</p>
<p>because that was like wait a</p>
<p>minute wait a</p>
<p>minute wait a</p>
<p>minute anyways</p>
<p>now because richard&rsquo;s home life was pretty</p>
<p>toxic he would</p>
<p>spend a lot of his time</p>
<p>nearby at his cousin&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>his cousin his name was Miguel</p>
<p>so Miguel this cousin</p>
<p>he was much older than</p>
<p>Richard and he had been an Army</p>
<p>Green Beret</p>
<p>combat veteran</p>
<p>who served in the Vietnam War so</p>
<p>pretty hardcore dude</p>
<p>now this cousin</p>
<p>was all sorts of effed</p>
<p>up you know they don&rsquo;t really give</p>
<p>much to veterans in the</p>
<p>first place as far as like</p>
<p>for their mental well being</p>
<p>this guy obviously Miguel had</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucked up is really all I can say</p>
<p>Richard would go over to his</p>
<p>house and just</p>
<p>hang out with him now he was like the cool cousin</p>
<p>Miguel would</p>
<p>tell Richard just the</p>
<p>awful things that he experienced</p>
<p>while away at war</p>
<p>and he would also tell Richard the</p>
<p>awful and violent rapes</p>
<p>that he committed</p>
<p>while stationed in Vietnam</p>
<p>he even had</p>
<p>photos of this is the cousin he even had</p>
<p>photos of him posing with a severed head</p>
<p>belonging to a</p>
<p>woman that he had raped and killed</p>
<p>so he is like showing this all to Richard</p>
<p>and Richard is like whoa that&rsquo;s cool because he&rsquo;s a kid</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know that this</p>
<p>is really awful or he does</p>
<p>but at this time Richard was 10 years old so</p>
<p>he just thought</p>
<p>Miguel was a cool</p>
<p>older cousin</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t know what he thought I</p>
<p>guess I can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>speak for him anywho</p>
<p>so Miguel would end up teaching</p>
<p>Richard some of the</p>
<p>skills he had</p>
<p>learned when</p>
<p>he was in the military including how to kill people</p>
<p>and how to capture people as well I</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>10 year olds to know</p>
<p>on May 4th 1973</p>
<p>Richard was at miguel&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and they were just hanging out</p>
<p>when Miguel and his wife got into an argument</p>
<p>their heated argument now this argument</p>
<p>ended up pushing Miguel over the edge</p>
<p>and Miguel ended up</p>
<p>shooting his wife in the face</p>
<p>now Richard was there he was just sitting like on the</p>
<p>couch kind of just</p>
<p>staying out of it</p>
<p>so he witnesses Miguel</p>
<p>shooting now Miguel</p>
<p>would end up getting arrested and taken into</p>
<p>prison but he was</p>
<p>found not guilty by reasons of insanity</p>
<p>and he would just</p>
<p>spend 4 years</p>
<p>incarcerated</p>
<p>in the state mental hospital</p>
<p>for a while after the</p>
<p>shooting Richard decided</p>
<p>to live with his</p>
<p>sister and her husband</p>
<p>he really just didn&rsquo;t want to go home because it was</p>
<p>not a good place to be</p>
<p>so he ends up moving in with his</p>
<p>sister and her husband now her husband</p>
<p>this is just a one big</p>
<p>hot mess of a family</p>
<p>his sister&rsquo;s husband was</p>
<p>Nate his name was</p>
<p>Roberto and</p>
<p>Roberto over here</p>
<p>was a Peep Tom so Roberto</p>
<p>would take Richard with him at</p>
<p>night to peep in windows of neighbors</p>
<p>where like really pretty or</p>
<p>attractive ladies were living</p>
<p>so the both of them would go</p>
<p>and just kind of</p>
<p>creep through the window</p>
<p>and watch these</p>
<p>women undress or like go to the bathroom</p>
<p>or just simply</p>
<p>watch creep</p>
<p>it just kind of seems like</p>
<p>for Richard it was</p>
<p>just one bad</p>
<p>place to another bad</p>
<p>place to another bad</p>
<p>place you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he knew what like</p>
<p>about quote</p>
<p>unquote normal</p>
<p>normal life or just normal effing</p>
<p>hobbies are</p>
<p>as a teenager</p>
<p>Richard began</p>
<p>associating his</p>
<p>sexual fantasies with violence</p>
<p>while he was</p>
<p>still at school</p>
<p>he also worked part time at a Holiday Inn</p>
<p>which is a hotel</p>
<p>holiday Inn is</p>
<p>everywhere right it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter it was a</p>
<p>hotel so he&rsquo;s working part time at a hotel</p>
<p>and going to</p>
<p>school now Richard was</p>
<p>using this job to his advantage</p>
<p>Richard Wood</p>
<p>uses pass key to</p>
<p>enter into hotel rooms and rob the</p>
<p>guests while they</p>
<p>were out so one</p>
<p>night when he was working at the</p>
<p>hotel Richard</p>
<p>broke into or</p>
<p>just used his pass key to get into a</p>
<p>guest hotel room</p>
<p>now it was a couple</p>
<p>the husband was somewhere he</p>
<p>had left and it was just the wife in there by herself</p>
<p>so Richard led himself into the room</p>
<p>and he attempted to rape</p>
<p>this woman the husband</p>
<p>ended up walking into the room and</p>
<p>catching Richard attacking his wife</p>
<p>he tackled him and he</p>
<p>tried to take him</p>
<p>out holding him down police were called but the charges</p>
<p>ended up being</p>
<p>dropped when the couple refused to testify</p>
<p>and I was trying to figure out well why did they</p>
<p>refuse to testify but</p>
<p>they were from out of</p>
<p>out of state just</p>
<p>visiting and they didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>travel to testify</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>because of this</p>
<p>Richard did end up losing his job at the hotel</p>
<p>as he should</p>
<p>so then Richard ends up</p>
<p>dropping out of high</p>
<p>school in the 9th</p>
<p>grade and honestly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little unclear what he did from this time</p>
<p>9th grade all the way up to the age of 22</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>much said as</p>
<p>to what he was doing so I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t really know but</p>
<p>at the age of 22</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Richard decided that he was</p>
<p>gonna move from Texas</p>
<p>to California permanently</p>
<p>so when he moved to</p>
<p>California he went to San Francisco first</p>
<p>and he was staying in the Tenderloin</p>
<p>district so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>April 10th 1984</p>
<p>Richard is staying at this hotel</p>
<p>in San Francisco</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where he ends up murdering a 9 year old girl</p>
<p>in the basement of the hotel</p>
<p>sadly he he</p>
<p>just he raped and he beat the poor girl before</p>
<p>stabbing her</p>
<p>to death I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry and this would be</p>
<p>richard&rsquo;s first</p>
<p>known killing</p>
<p>but initially it wasn&rsquo;t connected to him</p>
<p>at all it went</p>
<p>unsolved for many many years and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until 2009 when they were able to get a DNA</p>
<p>match linking him</p>
<p>to this horrible murder</p>
<p>he ends up going down</p>
<p>south to Los Angeles</p>
<p>so on June 28th 1984</p>
<p>a 79 year old</p>
<p>woman her name was</p>
<p>Jenny she was found</p>
<p>brutally murdered in her</p>
<p>apartment in Glasgow Park in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and it was said that she had been</p>
<p>stabbed repeatedly</p>
<p>fall asleep in her bed and her throat</p>
<p>was slashed so deeply that she was nearly decapitated</p>
<p>whoever had done this</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t know it was Richard at the time</p>
<p>but they knew whoever had done this</p>
<p>had gone through</p>
<p>the window and they had a fingerprint but no suspects</p>
<p>on March 17th 1985</p>
<p>Richard had attacked a 22 year old</p>
<p>woman and her name was</p>
<p>Maria all of</p>
<p>these crimes took</p>
<p>place in like the Los Angeles area</p>
<p>so 22 year old</p>
<p>Maria was pulling into her garage</p>
<p>Richard ends up like ambushing her running up to her</p>
<p>and he pulls out his handgun and he</p>
<p>shoots her in the face</p>
<p>she ends up</p>
<p>surviving because the bullet had</p>
<p>ricocheted off the keys</p>
<p>she held in her hands when she</p>
<p>lifted her hands up to</p>
<p>protect herself Richard thought like she was dead so he</p>
<p>goes inside of the home</p>
<p>and inside of the</p>
<p>house was her roommate</p>
<p>34 year old</p>
<p>woman named Dale</p>
<p>she had heard</p>
<p>the gunshot from</p>
<p>inside the house</p>
<p>and she had ducked behind a</p>
<p>counter in the</p>
<p>kitchen and she was just kind of like hiding there</p>
<p>she ends up</p>
<p>raising her head over the</p>
<p>counter where she&rsquo;s hiding to kind of see</p>
<p>where Richard is at</p>
<p>right so she</p>
<p>raises her head and that&rsquo;s when Richard sees her and</p>
<p>shoots her in the face</p>
<p>killing her</p>
<p>Richard then looked around the home and tried to</p>
<p>steal any jewelry or any like valuables and then left</p>
<p>and it was within the same hour okay</p>
<p>within the same hour</p>
<p>Richard had come across a lady</p>
<p>named Veronica</p>
<p>and she was sitting in her car</p>
<p>and Richard wanted to</p>
<p>steal her car so he</p>
<p>could get away</p>
<p>so Richard ends up pulling her out of her vehicle</p>
<p>and he ends up</p>
<p>shooting her</p>
<p>twice and then he ran</p>
<p>said that he wanted to</p>
<p>steal her car but he ran on foot</p>
<p>after he shot her</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not so then on</p>
<p>March 27th 1985</p>
<p>Richard broke into a home in Whittier</p>
<p>he had broken into this</p>
<p>house once before apparently</p>
<p>so he goes back and he</p>
<p>breaks into this home it&rsquo;s now 2 am in the morning</p>
<p>when he gets in there he sees</p>
<p>64 year old Vincent is</p>
<p>sleeping in his room next to Vincent</p>
<p>was his 44 year old wife</p>
<p>her name was Maisine</p>
<p>Richard just</p>
<p>shoots Vincent in the head</p>
<p>and of course this wakes up his wife who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleeping next to him Richard</p>
<p>like hops on top of her and he beats her</p>
<p>he then bounce</p>
<p>her her hands</p>
<p>and he demands that she tells him</p>
<p>where all the valuables</p>
<p>are at inside of the home she tells him that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some jewelry over there just take whatever you want</p>
<p>leaves her on the bed</p>
<p>ransacking the home</p>
<p>she is actually able to get her hands out of the bonds</p>
<p>right and she knows like there&rsquo;s a shotgun</p>
<p>underneath her bed</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s able to get out of there be quiet</p>
<p>about it so he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting out and she gets up gets</p>
<p>under the bed</p>
<p>she grabs the shotgun</p>
<p>Richard comes into the room she</p>
<p>points it at him</p>
<p>pulls the trigger</p>
<p>click it wasn&rsquo;t loaded</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine her feeling in that moment</p>
<p>so of course this infuriates Richard</p>
<p>and he then proceeds to</p>
<p>shoot her 3 times</p>
<p>so then Richard ends up</p>
<p>grabbing a knife from the</p>
<p>kitchen gouges</p>
<p>both of her</p>
<p>eyes out of her face and he puts them in a jewelry box</p>
<p>and he takes the jewelry box</p>
<p>just takes it</p>
<p>so when Richard is leaving the scene</p>
<p>he actually ends up leaving his footprints from his</p>
<p>sneakers in the flower beds</p>
<p>which are like outside the home</p>
<p>when police went out to the home</p>
<p>and they photographed and made a cast and</p>
<p>also police had</p>
<p>found bullets at the</p>
<p>scene which had</p>
<p>matched to those</p>
<p>found at previous attacks this is the</p>
<p>moment when police realized that a serial killer was</p>
<p>was at large</p>
<p>so then May 14th 1985</p>
<p>Richard goes down to like Monterey Park and he</p>
<p>enters the home</p>
<p>of 66 year old boy</p>
<p>Bill and his 56 year old disabled wife</p>
<p>Lillian who Bill was like the main caretaker for</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful Bill was in his bedroom</p>
<p>and Richard</p>
<p>enters the room</p>
<p>they kind of have like a little confrontation</p>
<p>confrontation</p>
<p>Bill went to go</p>
<p>reach for his own handgun that he had nearby</p>
<p>when he was</p>
<p>reaching for the gun</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Richard shot him in the face</p>
<p>then Richard that goes around and</p>
<p>starts trying to</p>
<p>steal stuff or find valuables but then he</p>
<p>enters lillian&rsquo;s room and he finds her there</p>
<p>he bound her up he</p>
<p>raped her then he ransacked the home</p>
<p>sadly Bill passed away</p>
<p>while he was in the hospital</p>
<p>so then May</p>
<p>29th all of these took</p>
<p>place in 1985 so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna stop saying 1985 Richard</p>
<p>steals a Mercedes</p>
<p>car he drives out to the home of 83 year old</p>
<p>Mabel and her 81 year old</p>
<p>sister Florence</p>
<p>both of them live together</p>
<p>so Richard breaks into</p>
<p>their home and he goes straight to the kitchen</p>
<p>and in the kitchen is</p>
<p>where he finds a hammer</p>
<p>he runs into Florence</p>
<p>first so he beat her with the hammer</p>
<p>and then he runs into</p>
<p>Mabel bounds her</p>
<p>wrists together</p>
<p>he ends up beating her</p>
<p>and he gets</p>
<p>electrical cords and he gives both</p>
<p>women electric shocks</p>
<p>using this cord</p>
<p>he then proceeds to rape</p>
<p>Florence and</p>
<p>then he grabs a lipstick he sees</p>
<p>and he draws like a pentagram</p>
<p>on poor mabel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as well as one of the walls in the bedroom</p>
<p>the women were actually discovered 2 days</p>
<p>later and they were both still</p>
<p>alive at the time and</p>
<p>transferred</p>
<p>to the hospital</p>
<p>on July 2nd Richard</p>
<p>stole a Toyota</p>
<p>and he randomly</p>
<p>selected the</p>
<p>house of 75 year old</p>
<p>Mary he quietly</p>
<p>entered the home and</p>
<p>found her asleep in her bedroom</p>
<p>he then beat her</p>
<p>until she was</p>
<p>unconscious with a lamp he then</p>
<p>tried to find any valuables in the home</p>
<p>and left she was</p>
<p>later discovered</p>
<p>dead at the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>oh it keeps</p>
<p>going then July</p>
<p>7th Richard</p>
<p>broke into the home of 61 year old Joyce</p>
<p>she was asleep</p>
<p>on her living room</p>
<p>couch Richard beat her to death</p>
<p>and kicked her in the head</p>
<p>which ended up leaving a</p>
<p>clear shoe print</p>
<p>from a sneaker on her face</p>
<p>and then after this attack</p>
<p>Richard decided that he needed a better tool</p>
<p>to commit these</p>
<p>crimes he was doing</p>
<p>so he goes and he buys a machete</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m like a</p>
<p>store owner or something and some guy comes in and</p>
<p>randomly buys just a machete</p>
<p>I feel like that</p>
<p>would be a red flag</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re buying a machete</p>
<p>okay yeah let me just take your information really</p>
<p>quick I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard any good stories with a machete</p>
<p>anyways so he buys a machete</p>
<p>Richard keeps</p>
<p>stealing cars and then he wipes them down</p>
<p>he ditches it somewhere</p>
<p>and he moves on to the next so he</p>
<p>drives out to a home</p>
<p>of 66 year old Lila and her 68 year old husband Max</p>
<p>bursts into the couple&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>asleep kills both of them with the machete</p>
<p>and then after he</p>
<p>knew that they</p>
<p>were dead or he thought that they were dead</p>
<p>he then shoots them in the head</p>
<p>and then robs their</p>
<p>house and takes all of</p>
<p>their valuables</p>
<p>so that same night July 20th at 4 am</p>
<p>Richard breaks into another home</p>
<p>it was a husband and a wife and they were asleep in</p>
<p>their bed Richard shot the husband</p>
<p>which killed him instantly</p>
<p>and then he bound and raped the wife</p>
<p>then the couple had an</p>
<p>8 year old son the</p>
<p>8 year old son came walking in because he hears like</p>
<p>noise going on in his parents bedroom</p>
<p>so he goes into the room to see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on Richard sees the 8 year old</p>
<p>he bounce him up and he drags the 8 year old around the</p>
<p>house telling him to show him</p>
<p>where the valuables were</p>
<p>and it was said that during this time when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dragging the little boy around he demanded</p>
<p>that he quote</p>
<p>I swear to Satan</p>
<p>that he was not hiding any</p>
<p>money from him</p>
<p>he left the</p>
<p>child bound</p>
<p>in the home</p>
<p>the child was able to get out and run to the neighbor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house for help</p>
<p>how are we doing are we okay</p>
<p>you need to</p>
<p>leave completely</p>
<p>understand when you read</p>
<p>about these it&rsquo;s easy to just</p>
<p>think of them as like a character in a way</p>
<p>or just like not real then when</p>
<p>you remember that&rsquo;s a real person who really did these</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re like what the</p>
<p>what you know it&rsquo;s just what</p>
<p>moving on to August 8th Richard</p>
<p>steals another car</p>
<p>and he chose the home of</p>
<p>27 year old</p>
<p>sakina and her 31</p>
<p>year old husband</p>
<p>Elias at this</p>
<p>point sometime</p>
<p>after 2 30 am</p>
<p>so he enters the home</p>
<p>and he just walks into the master bedroom</p>
<p>where they are asleep he</p>
<p>shoots and kills Elias</p>
<p>then he handcuffs</p>
<p>sachina while forcing</p>
<p>her to reveal the locations of like the family jewelry</p>
<p>and it was said</p>
<p>that Richard repeatedly demanded that she quote</p>
<p>swear on Satan</p>
<p>that she would not</p>
<p>scream during his assaults</p>
<p>sure Richard</p>
<p>sure he ends up just taking any valuables he saw</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>leaves the home</p>
<p>now during all this time</p>
<p>I mean police keep finding these</p>
<p>victims and they are linking them all together</p>
<p>thinking that</p>
<p>there is indeed like a serial killer out there</p>
<p>they hadn&rsquo;t made any like</p>
<p>public announcement</p>
<p>about it they didn&rsquo;t want to draw attention</p>
<p>too much and like</p>
<p>scare Richard away</p>
<p>then a televised</p>
<p>press conference</p>
<p>had taken place</p>
<p>and it was during this conference</p>
<p>which they ended up giving Richard the name the</p>
<p>Night Stalker</p>
<p>now during this</p>
<p>press conference is when they tell viewers to lock</p>
<p>their doors lock</p>
<p>their windows because someone is coming and it</p>
<p>could be any of you</p>
<p>like they were</p>
<p>they were putting some serious fear into anyone who was</p>
<p>watching which I mean they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>wrong because Richard was out here like</p>
<p>killing people just at</p>
<p>random this</p>
<p>press conference</p>
<p>ended up pissing a lot of people off especially</p>
<p>the LA detectives because they knew Richard was</p>
<p>gonna be watching and they knew</p>
<p>that Richard was</p>
<p>gonna like make a run for it</p>
<p>or destroy any type of evidence that he may have in</p>
<p>his possession</p>
<p>so LA detectives were like pissed off that they had</p>
<p>this media conference</p>
<p>about it I mean they were</p>
<p>right Richard was indeed</p>
<p>watching Richard saw this</p>
<p>and knew that everyone was on to him</p>
<p>he then took his sneakers</p>
<p>because they had mentioned in this media</p>
<p>conference that they had do you remember when they</p>
<p>found like his footprints in the garden area when he</p>
<p>broke out of a house</p>
<p>they found out like what kind of</p>
<p>sneaker it was so they made an announcement</p>
<p>about what kind of</p>
<p>sneaker was any little bit of information they had</p>
<p>Richard then takes his</p>
<p>sneakers that were linked to the crimes</p>
<p>drives up to San Francisco</p>
<p>he then goes to the Golden Gate Bridge</p>
<p>and he drops his</p>
<p>sneaker off of the Golden Gate Bridge into the water</p>
<p>he at that time</p>
<p>remained in the San Francisco area for a few more days</p>
<p>and then for</p>
<p>some reason he goes back to the Los Angeles area</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I mean it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing he did because</p>
<p>he gets caught but like</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>drives back to the Los Angeles area</p>
<p>and then on August 24th</p>
<p>Richard gets that itch or that</p>
<p>urge to break into someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house again</p>
<p>so he drives a little bit outside the Los Angeles area</p>
<p>and he is kind of lurking</p>
<p>outside of a home inside was a 13 year old boy named</p>
<p>James and he was awake</p>
<p>and he hears footsteps outside the window</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>everybody had</p>
<p>heard about this</p>
<p>night stalker so everybody was like just</p>
<p>freaked out this</p>
<p>James boy he hears like footsteps and</p>
<p>naturally he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>night stalker so he runs and he wakes up his parents</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being just really loud and</p>
<p>making sure that whoever&rsquo;s outside is like hearing them</p>
<p>right this freaks Richard out and he gets into a</p>
<p>stolen card so</p>
<p>James is 13 year old boy he runs outside</p>
<p>rave had a little notepad</p>
<p>and he noted the</p>
<p>color the make and</p>
<p>model of the car that Richard was</p>
<p>speeding off in</p>
<p>and James was also</p>
<p>able to get just a few numbers and letters from the</p>
<p>license plate</p>
<p>James contacted the police</p>
<p>and handed over what he knew</p>
<p>or what he saw the</p>
<p>stolen vehicle</p>
<p>that Richard was driving in they</p>
<p>found it on August</p>
<p>28th they were able to get like a fingerprint from the</p>
<p>rear view mirror</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>Richard was really good at like wiping down the</p>
<p>vehicle he just missed like one little</p>
<p>fingerprint police are excited</p>
<p>about this like they got a fingerprint okay</p>
<p>so they go back</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to get a positive ID on the fingerprint</p>
<p>and now they had a name</p>
<p>for this serial killer who&rsquo;s been just causing chaos</p>
<p>this fingerprint belongs to someone</p>
<p>named Richard Ramirez</p>
<p>they see that he&rsquo;s like a 25 year old</p>
<p>drifter from</p>
<p>Texas and he had a long rap</p>
<p>sheet that included</p>
<p>many arrests for traffic and drug violations</p>
<p>so law enforcement decided to release to the</p>
<p>media a mugshot of Richard that they had on file</p>
<p>so they do another</p>
<p>media conference</p>
<p>and they publicly address Richard</p>
<p>cause they know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching and they say</p>
<p>we know who you are everyone else will too</p>
<p>and there will be no</p>
<p>place for you to hide</p>
<p>which I feel like is such a ballsy</p>
<p>move when you address the killer on camera I feel like</p>
<p>that to them</p>
<p>they take it as like a challenge like oh yeah</p>
<p>watch me you know and I just</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing or not</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter okay cool</p>
<p>so then August 30th Richard decided to take a bus</p>
<p>to Tucson Arizona that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where his brother was living</p>
<p>so his brother at this time</p>
<p>I guess was</p>
<p>completely unaware</p>
<p>what was going on</p>
<p>now every newspaper</p>
<p>and TV program in</p>
<p>California was running this</p>
<p>story okay it was</p>
<p>everywhere and you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>avoid it but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know so much if in Tucson</p>
<p>it was anyways Richard ends up</p>
<p>not meeting with his brother so he takes the bus out to</p>
<p>Tucson and then gets back on the bus</p>
<p>and goes back to Los Angeles</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve gathered</p>
<p>perhaps maybe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s because he was</p>
<p>worried to put his brother in jeopardy</p>
<p>and then now involve him on his crimes</p>
<p>but that is</p>
<p>still kind of like unclear</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>no but he gets</p>
<p>back on the bus and he goes back to Los Angeles</p>
<p>so then on August 31st Richard</p>
<p>gets off of the bus and he&rsquo;s walking and he looks over</p>
<p>and he sees like a newspaper rack</p>
<p>right has magazines newspapers everything</p>
<p>and on the newspaper rack</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>every single newspaper had his</p>
<p>picture on the front</p>
<p>so he sees this and it sends him into a full</p>
<p>blown book a meltdown</p>
<p>he takes off running on foot and he</p>
<p>tries to run across the freeway</p>
<p>stops a car it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman he tries to</p>
<p>carjack her</p>
<p>other people nearby who have slowed down</p>
<p>and they see this happening</p>
<p>so then they</p>
<p>prevent him from</p>
<p>carjacking this woman</p>
<p>Richard gets</p>
<p>exhausted by all this so he takes off and he hops over</p>
<p>several fences attempting 2 more carjackings</p>
<p>now this is the good part</p>
<p>because he ends up in East LA</p>
<p>rough so he ends up in the</p>
<p>wrong part of the neighborhood</p>
<p>perfect right love that</p>
<p>his dumbass</p>
<p>tries to stop one of the cars driving down the</p>
<p>street luckily there were people outside like a</p>
<p>group of guys hanging</p>
<p>outside so they see this happening and they&rsquo;re like no</p>
<p>and they attack</p>
<p>Richard one of them had</p>
<p>struck Richard over the head with a metal bar</p>
<p>and it prevented him from getting away</p>
<p>cause it like</p>
<p>knocked him out you know</p>
<p>the group ends up just taking turns</p>
<p>beating the shit out of him and holding him down</p>
<p>until police came</p>
<p>so Richard gets arrested</p>
<p>and put in prison and is waiting for his court date</p>
<p>so at his first</p>
<p>court appearance</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>press there and stuff</p>
<p>and Richard had</p>
<p>carved a pentagram</p>
<p>on his hand</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s showing it to like the cameras and</p>
<p>stuff and he just yells hail Satan</p>
<p>lots of Satan</p>
<p>stuff on his body</p>
<p>then on August 3</p>
<p>1988 the Los Angeles Times reported that jail employees</p>
<p>had overheard Richard</p>
<p>planning to</p>
<p>shoot the prosecutor with a</p>
<p>and then Richard Rudd was really bragging that he was</p>
<p>going to smuggle</p>
<p>like a gun into the</p>
<p>courtroom and how he was</p>
<p>gonna do it and all that and they install a</p>
<p>metal detector</p>
<p>outside the</p>
<p>courtroom so then</p>
<p>August 14th the trial</p>
<p>was interrupted because one of the jurors</p>
<p>did not arrive to the</p>
<p>courtroom and</p>
<p>later that day she was</p>
<p>found shot to</p>
<p>death in her apartment</p>
<p>so naturally</p>
<p>the jury was terrified they were all</p>
<p>thinking it was Richard</p>
<p>that he somehow directed</p>
<p>this to happen</p>
<p>from inside his prison cell</p>
<p>and now everyone</p>
<p>especially the jury was really afraid for</p>
<p>their own lives because you know one of them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to do my duty</p>
<p>you know and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna put my life at risk</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame them I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go heck no later on it was determined</p>
<p>that Richard was actually not responsible for</p>
<p>this lady&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death and it was like her boyfriend</p>
<p>shot and killed her ugh</p>
<p>just what is</p>
<p>going on this is what is</p>
<p>going on you know like how</p>
<p>awful now this is the part that</p>
<p>extra pisses me off I mean this whole</p>
<p>story pisses me off don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong mmm hmm</p>
<p>media was covering this</p>
<p>story they were showing richard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>photo everywhere a lot of people</p>
<p>thought he was a good looking guy that he was very hot</p>
<p>Richard had fans</p>
<p>he was getting hundreds of letters they</p>
<p>loved him they were a fan of his</p>
<p>work there were also a lot of people paying him a visit</p>
<p>while he was in prison</p>
<p>one of the ladies who was a big fan her name was Doreen</p>
<p>and she wrote him nearly like</p>
<p>75 letters during</p>
<p>his incarceration and they were in love</p>
<p>and then during his trial</p>
<p>women were just flocking to the</p>
<p>courtroom to get a</p>
<p>glimpse of him they were</p>
<p>screaming like it was Justin Bieber</p>
<p>would people only</p>
<p>scream for Justin Bieber anymore</p>
<p>they were screaming like it was</p>
<p>you know fan girls now many of</p>
<p>these fans believe</p>
<p>that he was innocent he&rsquo;s innocent he didn&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>everything points to him that one sure</p>
<p>she got shot and she died</p>
<p>so she ends up being replaced by another woman</p>
<p>her name is Cindy</p>
<p>and Cindy was infatuated</p>
<p>in love with</p>
<p>obsessed with Richard</p>
<p>how she got on the jury</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know she is just making</p>
<p>googly eyes with Richard like oh my God</p>
<p>and she would</p>
<p>write him little notes and</p>
<p>stuff and write him letters</p>
<p>in prison Richard</p>
<p>loved this okay</p>
<p>because he thought with her on his side he</p>
<p>could have a chance of getting a hung jury so he</p>
<p>is making sure to</p>
<p>give her eye contact when he&rsquo;s like in</p>
<p>court you know</p>
<p>that kind of</p>
<p>stuff September 30th 1989</p>
<p>Richard was convicted of all charges 13</p>
<p>counts of murder</p>
<p>5 attempted murders 11</p>
<p>sexual assaults and 14 burglaries burglary</p>
<p>sorry during the penalty</p>
<p>phase of the</p>
<p>trial on November 7th he was sentenced to die</p>
<p>in california&rsquo;s gas chamber</p>
<p>which they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even do anymore so he just sat there now Richard</p>
<p>ended up being</p>
<p>upset with Cindy the judge</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t have his back</p>
<p>disappointed that you know</p>
<p>that he got the</p>
<p>death sentence</p>
<p>she would later go on to do a few TV appearances</p>
<p>insisting that he had been poorly represented</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t deserving of the</p>
<p>death sentence how do you do that</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>boys and girls just set better</p>
<p>standards for yourself you deserve better</p>
<p>all right I&rsquo;m glad we had this talk</p>
<p>in 1988 do you remember Doreen</p>
<p>they were in love too he had a lot of like</p>
<p>girlfriends and</p>
<p>stuff anyways doreen</p>
<p>Richard ends up like proposing to her</p>
<p>and they get</p>
<p>married on October</p>
<p>3 1996 they were</p>
<p>married in the</p>
<p>California San</p>
<p>Quentin State Prison</p>
<p>we should just do a</p>
<p>video dedicated</p>
<p>like San Quentin</p>
<p>State Prison because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re all at</p>
<p>field trip but Doreen</p>
<p>would eventually</p>
<p>leave Richard she</p>
<p>found out that he had killed a 9 year old and this</p>
<p>upset her so she</p>
<p>broke it off with him but I</p>
<p>guess none of the</p>
<p>other murders really mattered to her</p>
<p>be better and get</p>
<p>better idols</p>
<p>get better idols okay</p>
<p>doreen darling hey do better</p>
<p>okay Richard was waiting for his</p>
<p>execution date</p>
<p>and this is when</p>
<p>he became very unwell very sick his health just fell</p>
<p>apart and he</p>
<p>ended up passing away at the</p>
<p>age of 53 he had been sitting on</p>
<p>death row for more than 23 years</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>museum out here it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>Museum of Death</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one here in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one in New Orleans</p>
<p>as well I&rsquo;ve been to the one out here in Los Angeles</p>
<p>been a couple</p>
<p>of times you are not allowed to film in there take</p>
<p>photos anything</p>

<p>you guys what it looks like inside it&rsquo;s intense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intense collection</p>
<p>of serial killer</p>

<p>graphic images</p>
<p>wall to wall to</p>
<p>every corner is</p>
<p>stuffed with something when you walk in it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heavy anyways what I&rsquo;m getting at is</p>
<p>in the Museum of</p>
<p>Death here in Los Angeles</p>
<p>they actually have a lot of letters from Richard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on display</p>
<p>and you could see a</p>
<p>picture book</p>
<p>all the different</p>
<p>pictures that he got from fan girls</p>
<p>while he was in prison</p>
<p>these girls just trying to be all</p>
<p>cute and sexy yay Satan</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would send it to him and they would</p>
<p>write letters expressing</p>
<p>their love oh it&rsquo;s mind blowing some of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>these girls</p>
