<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>lesbians that</p>
<p>would do it just to</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>using their vagina properly</p>
<p>with rosie&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d have to take two</p>
<p>flashlights and just rub them together</p>

<p>when to enforce it was sex in the city wasn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>no no it was real a real couple real couple</p>
<p>was making out</p>
<p>weird fucking shit like we had</p>
<p>we had drinks beers on our van</p>
<p>and i was over there another time</p>

<p>and we had beers on the van</p>
<p>after we shot one</p>
<p>night and we had</p>
<p>a female like that worked</p>
<p>for the emirates with us</p>
<p>and the next day we find out like we&rsquo;re in big</p>
<p>trouble we drank around a female</p>
<p>we were swearing</p>
<p>there was all kinds of shit and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like you</p>
<p>broke every like sharia law</p>
<p>possible don&rsquo;t you you</p>
<p>fuck there&rsquo;s evidence of this well it was kind of like</p>
<p>i was over there with like a guy who&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>his his father</p>
<p>is like the attorney for the emirates</p>
<p>right and so it was kind of like</p>
<p>you guys are okay but don&rsquo;t fuck up</p>
<p>again like like</p>
<p>you so do you have a mark</p>
<p>against you now so if you go to dubai now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m never going</p>
<p>again we filmed one</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>i put on a dish dash</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>islamic well not</p>
<p>islamic but just the garb</p>
<p>that they wear</p>
<p>right in dubai</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s the white</p>
<p>down in the hat</p>
<p>and they gave</p>
<p>me one of those when i did the</p>
<p>ufc in abu dhabi</p>
<p>yeah and a buddy of mine</p>
<p>just wore them around town we thought it was kind of</p>
<p>funny and we&rsquo;re just right</p>
<p>and we kept asking people were like we&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>breaking any law</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like no no it&rsquo;s not religious it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>clothing that people wear</p>
<p>and then the girl that</p>
<p>worked for the emirates left the emirates and sent me</p>
<p>an email telling me that there were spies</p>
<p>watching us</p>
<p>the whole time</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>just fuck this shit i don&rsquo;t need to go back there</p>
<p>yeah who was it</p>
<p>that was telling us</p>
<p>pete johansson was telling us that he did gigs in</p>
<p>dubai and there was</p>
<p>members of the</p>
<p>secret police</p>
<p>would sit in the audience and</p>
<p>watch yeah yeah yeah they did and they</p>
<p>would be in the front row</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be totally obvious i think</p>
<p>actually i don&rsquo;t remember if you said the</p>
<p>front row he</p>
<p>might have said the back row</p>
<p>whatever he said they were</p>
<p>super obvious</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>standing there with</p>
<p>their arms crossed just staring</p>
<p>at him the whole time yep</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s trying not to</p>
<p>cross any lines trying not to say</p>
<p>anything with the lines you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cuss no no you can say</p>
<p>anything you</p>
<p>want they don&rsquo;t want you making fun of islam</p>
<p>well remember when we had</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his face</p>
<p>how sparks and he was talking</p>
<p>about almost getting arrested he</p>
<p>was doing gigs with john lovett</p>
<p>and he made a mistake of calling the</p>
<p>speaking of</p>
<p>one of the sultans or one of the shakes</p>
<p>and he called them</p>
<p>what do you call</p>
<p>miss sure ms sure i</p>
<p>think he said that i called him the french name for mr</p>
<p>and apparently one guy got incredibly offended</p>
<p>and you know called the religious police and</p>
<p>people showed up and they were</p>
<p>gonna fucking put him in jail for this i seriously</p>
<p>think i could make a movie</p>
<p>about my weekend</p>
<p>the one weekend i went there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>scary when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other parts of the country where you</p>
<p>travel like that</p>
<p>you know we get used to</p>
<p>behaving and</p>
<p>thinking you have</p>
<p>a certain amount of freedom you know what you do here</p>
<p>this is an entirely free country you know weeds</p>
<p>still illegal you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>i want to kill</p>
<p>the president or if you do they&rsquo;ll lock you up</p>
<p>obviously it was in character when i said that</p>
<p>the president of kentucky</p>
<p>fried chicken</p>
<p>you know certain</p>
<p>things you can&rsquo;t say is not</p>
<p>completely and totally free</p>
<p>but for the most part it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get</p>
<p>along here but if you go to</p>
<p>other parts of the</p>
<p>world they&rsquo;re incredibly suppressive</p>
<p>incredibly especially the middle east yeah</p>
<p>terrifyingly you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>people like you know i am</p>
<p>most certainly not for war and not into this war</p>
<p>which i think is a</p>
<p>fucking shady war and shady as fuck how we got into it</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>we have to be very careful</p>
<p>about the rise</p>
<p>of islamic power all around the</p>
<p>world the rise of sharia</p>
<p>sharia sharia</p>
<p>sharia sharia law</p>
<p>we have to be</p>
<p>careful of any kind of religious zealots whether</p>
<p>christian zealots or</p>
<p>muslim zealops or</p>
<p>anytime people that</p>
<p>think they can lock you up and they have the</p>
<p>right to because you were having fun</p>
<p>you were out dancing</p>
<p>you were out drinking</p>
<p>i have to say that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>scary shit i&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>not anti american but i always rail</p>
<p>against the government on all things but</p>
<p>when i get over there</p>
<p>and this kind of shit happened that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start to really</p>
<p>appreciate your country</p>
<p>that you go</p>
<p>you know i could call the embassy and they</p>
<p>would take care like</p>
<p>they fight for you sure</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to do you&rsquo;re the united</p>
<p>states citizens you know</p>
<p>i mean we pay</p>
<p>taxes that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the benefits of being a part of the team</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just fucked up that we have to think</p>
<p>about that anywhere</p>
<p>you know i mean yeah the united states</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not perfect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s corrupt as shit you know</p>
<p>super corrupt the fucking</p>
<p>the business of government is gigantic</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a billion different jobs out there that</p>
<p>literally don&rsquo;t need to exist</p>
<p>they exist to keep jobs</p>
<p>going to keep the business of government</p>
<p>going and it creates</p>
<p>quagmires and fucking complex little social situations</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i always say to people i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny when people criticize the president</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>obama fan but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>against them i don&rsquo;t believe in the</p>
<p>whole political system</p>
<p>i love people that criticize</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>charge like</p>
<p>you yeah i always</p>
<p>fucked everything up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so silly he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like wwe</p>
<p>raw you know the</p>
<p>whole political system</p>
<p>and vince mcmahon&rsquo;s the corporations running it all</p>
<p>yeah and and</p>
<p>but but people that criticize like a guy</p>
<p>you know obama is healthcare</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like dude you can&rsquo;t even fucking return your</p>
<p>videos to blockbuster</p>
<p>on time how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a general lack of</p>
<p>understanding about the</p>
<p>system which i</p>
<p>think most people have and even</p>
<p>me i&rsquo;ll get like into it i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>focus on for like a couple of</p>
<p>months then i&rsquo;ll go what am i doing</p>
<p>what am i paying</p>
<p>attention to i&rsquo;m paying attention to this</p>
<p>stupid hustle</p>
<p>this fake thing that barely</p>
<p>you know what goes on in washington barely affects your</p>
<p>day to day life what goes on in your neighborhood what</p>
<p>goes on with your friends what goes on in your world</p>
<p>people that</p>
<p>you interact with that&rsquo;s what affects your life</p>
<p>if you get really</p>
<p>too hung up and dealing with like washington</p>
<p>and politics and democrats and republicans and</p>
<p>thinking you</p>
<p>understand that system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous i</p>
<p>used to work for a</p>
<p>senator and</p>
<p>yeah it was my</p>
<p>first job where</p>
<p>i worked for arlen spector</p>
<p>get the fuck out</p>
<p>of here i swear to god</p>
<p>that evil cunt</p>
<p>you know that guy was on the warrant</p>
<p>commission right dude i</p>
<p>could tell you i just i</p>
<p>started interning for him in college and</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>i thought i wanted to go into</p>
<p>politics or something and then i realized like i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>i thought like</p>
<p>that i had the shady side that was good for politics</p>
<p>but i was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fun</p>
<p>involved it&rsquo;s just a fucking torturous horrible</p>
<p>and they are</p>
<p>like everyone says it&rsquo;s poor man&rsquo;s hollywood</p>
<p>spectre had like hair plugs</p>
<p>facelift fucking</p>
<p>of course you have to appear</p>
<p>vera to your</p>
<p>audience and</p>
<p>he was just like he was the ugliest dude in the</p>
<p>world and he was</p>
<p>of evil fuck man but</p>
<p>when he would explain</p>
<p>his single bullet theory</p>
<p>if he would sit and explain it to you</p>
<p>after he does it you</p>
<p>would believe him no i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you no i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve seen the bullet the dumbest thing</p>
<p>about the single bullet is the bullet itself</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s almost no damage one through two people</p>
<p>shattered bone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s barely</p>
<p>dented but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you in his presence he has this way of</p>
<p>correcting you incorrect</p>
<p>i would not be amused or affected by that dummy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that guy&rsquo;s an evil fuck there&rsquo;s no way i</p>
<p>would listen to him and</p>
<p>be impressed is it</p>
<p>charming or is he</p>
<p>not in the least it was one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where i was like how the fuck</p>
<p>did this guy get into politics he was like</p>
<p>and all you have to do is be in dude</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re in it&rsquo;s like being a writer on a sitcom</p>
<p>you know when you work on a sitcom one of the</p>
<p>things you find out</p>
<p>about working</p>
<p>on sitcoms is there&rsquo;s usually a few brilliant writers</p>
<p>and these fucking fakes</p>
<p>these people that aren&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>funny at all like</p>
<p>they would never</p>
<p>stand up comedians</p>
<p>someone somehow or another</p>
<p>got them a job as a comedy</p>
<p>writer and now here they are on sitcoms and</p>
<p>you deal with them over and over and over</p>
<p>again and you realize</p>
<p>all you have to do is just get into the system</p>
<p>once you get into the</p>
<p>system then you get</p>
<p>other jobs i gave that</p>
<p>speech once i got a deal a long time ago</p>
<p>to do a sitcom and it was</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>about my life and i used to live with my</p>
<p>sister in new york for a</p>
<p>while and they thought that was</p>
<p>funny to the</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make a show about it</p>
<p>so i met with writers</p>
<p>first i met with</p>
<p>all the development guys and they were like</p>
<p>showing me the writers they were</p>
<p>gonna give me and they gave me the</p>
<p>script of these guys and i went this is shit</p>
<p>this is shit</p>
<p>and my manager at the time was like shut the fuck up</p>
<p>take the money who&rsquo;s your manager got up</p>
<p>the time it was carrie hoffman</p>
<p>carrie hoffman out of new york he owned</p>
<p>stand up new york oh my god</p>
<p>stand up new york didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>carry like he</p>
<p>would get like people</p>
<p>would get sitcoms and he</p>
<p>would want a</p>
<p>piece of the</p>
<p>sitcom because they used to work out in his club</p>
<p>did he do that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious you listen to</p>
<p>stuffers like listen to that</p>
<p>the guy was a manager of a fucking</p>
<p>or owned a comedy club</p>
<p>comics would go up and then perform in his club</p>
<p>and they got</p>
<p>one guy got a development deal</p>
<p>and he wanted</p>
<p>like a certain percentage of this guy&rsquo;s sitcom</p>
<p>because he used</p>
<p>to practice at his club oh that&rsquo;s fucking stupid</p>
<p>amazing and he didn&rsquo;t get it though</p>
<p>of course not of course not</p>
<p>really hard amazing that he</p>
<p>would even chase</p>
<p>after that so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry so this guy tells you to shut</p>
<p>the fuck up he&rsquo;s like shut the fuck up and take the</p>
<p>money and i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sitting in the meeting and</p>
<p>no offense i said i</p>
<p>understand you know that you</p>
<p>think these guys are good writers and</p>
<p>everything i said but i know this whole</p>
<p>system what goes on</p>
<p>guys get in and they get their</p>
<p>buddy and he can&rsquo;t write</p>
<p>and but then they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been there for ten years and you don&rsquo;t realize they</p>
<p>never wrote anything good they were just there</p>
<p>and now they get to be a show runner i said</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got millions of friends that</p>
<p>write funnier than this can i can i just go out and get</p>
<p>one of them and we&rsquo;re jim and i are in that situation</p>
<p>right now where they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>a show with us right now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we feel like we could</p>
<p>write the show</p>
<p>there was a time when i had a development deal</p>
<p>where there were two guys that were</p>
<p>writing for friends they were the creators of friends</p>
<p>and one of them branched out on his own</p>
<p>and i got this development deal</p>
<p>and it was for fox and</p>
<p>it was a good amount of</p>
<p>money and so they</p>
<p>really wanted this guy to do it because this guy had</p>
<p>such a great</p>
<p>background well</p>
<p>often what happens is when there&rsquo;s a team of writers</p>
<p>you got one brilliant guy</p>
<p>and the other guy is this fucking</p>
<p>buddy that you bounce shit off of</p>
<p>you know and so the brilliant guys</p>
<p>bouncing shit off the</p>
<p>other guy and then they put it all together like</p>
<p>maybe the other guy types and</p>
<p>and they become a team so</p>
<p>you want somewhere</p>
<p>along the line the</p>
<p>other guy says you know what i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m unrecognized</p>
<p>my talent personalities</p>
<p>my friend i&rsquo;m much better</p>
<p>so this fucking</p>
<p>idiot decides he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go out on his own so he gets his</p>
<p>giant development deal it was for</p>
<p>it was i zoe</p>
<p>it was michael eisner&rsquo;s company</p>
<p>and it was a fucking huge development deal millions and</p>
<p>millions dollars everybody was like banking on this guy</p>
<p>and so i go</p>
<p>to meet with the guy they want me to meet with him</p>
<p>i meet with him and he&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>bowling shoes</p>
<p>whenever i see a guy who&rsquo;s trying to be wacky</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wearing bone</p>
<p>shoes aren&rsquo;t comfortable</p>
<p>those are uncomfortable as fuck</p>
<p>like why are you wearing</p>
<p>those are you wearing</p>
<p>those to let me know that you&rsquo;re nutty</p>
<p>i might be a</p>
<p>multi millionaire but i wear bowling</p>
<p>shoes to the office</p>
<p>did you just</p>
<p>get done bowling no you&rsquo;re trying to send a message</p>
<p>and the message is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dressing like you</p>
<p>think a funny person</p>
<p>would dress</p>
<p>tells me you&rsquo;re probably not fucking funny</p>
<p>so i immediately</p>
<p>get terrified i&rsquo;m like oh this guy this is a fucking</p>
<p>faker he snuck through</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way there&rsquo;s no way how</p>
<p>could he get this fucking gigantic</p>
<p>multi multi million dollar deer if he</p>
<p>snuck through</p>
<p>so i meet with the guy</p>
<p>we talk he has an</p>
<p>idea he wants me to be a part of it bubba bubba we meet</p>
<p>and then they give me one of his</p>
<p>scripts the</p>
<p>script that</p>
<p>i read is fucking terrible i mean it&rsquo;s just god</p>
<p>awful there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>funny in it at all</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like well</p>
<p>maybe this is just a shit script</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>other ones maybe there&rsquo;s a spec</p>
<p>maybe they had him write this</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t a subject that he was interested in</p>
<p>so this guy comes up with the</p>
<p>this is his idea for a sitcom</p>
<p>sitcom is about an immortal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about a man who&rsquo;s immortal</p>
<p>okay and he</p>
<p>existence like</p>
<p>egyptian days</p>
<p>and all he does is like get laid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking devoid of comedy</p>
<p>who wants to watch</p>
<p>a sitcom about an immortal</p>
<p>a guy who&rsquo;s an immortal</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been immortal since the</p>
<p>egyptian days and all he does is try to get laid</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand all</p>
<p>these hooks in these sitcoms when you look at</p>
<p>the best sitcoms that have ever existed</p>
<p>the jobs or whatever they do it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>superfluous</p>
<p>all you need is a group of people</p>
<p>that hang out together and have relationships with each</p>
<p>other in the</p>
<p>interesting relationships if you look at like taxi</p>
<p>and cheers and you</p>
<p>could move them to any</p>
<p>other setting and they</p>
<p>would be funny</p>
<p>you know you put them in an office if you well that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter what this guy did well this guy was not</p>
<p>funny it didn&rsquo;t matter if he</p>
<p>wrote about</p>
<p>three people hanging out at a laundromat or</p>
<p>three people who work on the moon he</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>idiot yeah he just</p>
<p>snuck in that show</p>
<p>never made it out though</p>
<p>right no of course</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t and i had to tell them we had a meeting</p>
<p>and it was a real controversial meeting it was like</p>
<p>they were upset at me because i was like</p>
<p>this guy sucks and they&rsquo;re like this guy does not suck</p>
<p>this guy is ba ba ba</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this he&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done all</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny i&rsquo;m telling you this guy&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny this is a mistake</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more to writing than just being</p>
<p>funny there&rsquo;s character development and story arcs</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a guy who really</p>
<p>understands that</p>
<p>and we can bring in more</p>
<p>funny later but what he&rsquo;s really concerned with</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re concerned</p>
<p>we want a really good</p>
<p>story the story was</p>
<p>it was terrible it was</p>
<p>stupid it didn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>like a guy who&rsquo;s pretending to be a comedy writer</p>
<p>who got a job</p>
<p>right in comedy</p>
<p>if you took some fucking guy to work for</p>
<p>a fence company</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tired of writing fences i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m good writer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done it i&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>stand up for 15 years and</p>
<p>it took me 15 14 and</p>
<p>about 14 and a half years to finally realize</p>
<p>that 95 of the people in the business</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about comedy</p>
<p>like well you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>truly understand</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>i mean i and i&rsquo;ve lately been putting them to the test</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ll say well explain to me why</p>
<p>and when you put them</p>
<p>like when you put them on the hot</p>
<p>screen while</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ll say something like why is that</p>
<p>comic doing that or why</p>
<p>should he why do you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s good at what he does or why isn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>are you asking</p>
<p>agents managers</p>
<p>yeah everybody</p>
<p>yeah development people</p>
<p>talent scouts</p>
<p>i always do it and i put them to it and they&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>well you know he does this really interesting</p>
<p>thing where he&rsquo;s kind of like not really</p>
<p>observational but he&rsquo;s kind of political but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s more unnecessary i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you have no fucking idea</p>
<p>you have no idea</p>
<p>you all are</p>
<p>sheep and you just follow well it&rsquo;s not that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i think agency</p>
<p>managers are really important</p>
<p>but i think they really can&rsquo;t truly</p>
<p>understand what comedy is all</p>
<p>about unless they do it</p>
<p>you know unless you do it you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>never going to be an</p>
<p>expert on it you</p>
<p>might know a lot</p>
<p>about it but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna really</p>
<p>truly understand it</p>
<p>unless you can recreate</p>
<p>it i have an</p>
<p>agent out of australia</p>
<p>i think you might have</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>might have worked</p>
<p>with you when you were down there artie lang</p>
<p>yeah yeah dude</p>
<p>same name as</p>
<p>howard you guy but same now arty</p>
<p>is fucking like</p>
<p>the greatest</p>
<p>agent that has</p>
<p>a great guy he&rsquo;s fucking amazing and he knows comedy</p>
<p>comedy a little bit</p>
<p>and like you&rsquo;ll do a</p>
<p>bit and he&rsquo;ll go why don&rsquo;t you say this and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah that would actually work better</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll run my sets</p>
<p>by him before i</p>
<p>go on tv and he&rsquo;s like no no take that out put that in</p>
<p>not saying that he can&rsquo;t have some</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>of comedy without doing it you just can&rsquo;t really truly</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna</p>
<p>understand the way a comic</p>
<p>understands it it&rsquo;s all theoretical</p>
<p>until you put it in practice it&rsquo;s like a guy who does</p>
<p>kata in the gym is pretty sure he</p>
<p>could fare well in a</p>
<p>street fight yeah</p>
<p>but really he&rsquo;s not really sure it&rsquo;s theoretical</p>
<p>you know a guy who&rsquo;s actually fought a</p>
<p>bunch of times is like yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been through this shit before i know what i&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with agents and managers that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it totally</p>
<p>because they do a great job</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t do it and you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to sell ourselves we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to go out and get development deals</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>anyway you can&rsquo;t negotiate for yourself it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>especially that and be creative</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to have managers and agents</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to know</p>
<p>everything they just have to</p>
<p>shut the fuck up and push in the</p>
<p>right direction if you&rsquo;re talented</p>
<p>the problem is when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>that talented or when you&rsquo;re not doing that well you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>successful yet</p>
<p>then they start</p>
<p>tweaking you</p>
<p>then they start well we&rsquo;ve got to figure out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here what you need is a new look</p>
<p>you know jamie masada told</p>
<p>my friend todd parker</p>
<p>that he had to be the</p>
<p>generation x guy that&rsquo;s what he was saying</p>
<p>buddy you are</p>
<p>generation x guy</p>
<p>this is your new hook you go on stage</p>
<p>everything come out of your mouth</p>
<p>generation x i am</p>
<p>generation x guy</p>
<p>have you imdb that guy now lately that</p>
<p>got the friends writer just to see what kind i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even remember his name</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember his name</p>
<p>but i met a couple of</p>
<p>those guys i</p>
<p>wrote something with one of</p>
<p>those guys a guy who</p>
<p>wrote on seinfeld</p>
<p>fucking terrible he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write anything</p>
<p>funny it wind</p>
<p>up me and me writing the funny</p>
<p>stuff and him writing it down</p>
<p>it was a terrible relationship</p>
<p>kerry hoffman did that to uh</p>
<p>to me that once he</p>
<p>tried to change me he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ve got an idea</p>
<p>um oh what you</p>
<p>never see comedy duos anymore</p>
<p>you we get you and a girl</p>
<p>we get you and a girl</p>
<p>and you do like</p>
<p>still earn mira oh my god</p>
<p>oh my god what an idiot</p>
<p>yeah but uh</p>
<p>what is that guy</p>
<p>still in the business</p>
<p>i think so actually he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>really well because he&rsquo;s got mike royce and tom hurt</p>
<p>who are really good writers and</p>
<p>yeah i think i think</p>
<p>tom might be on</p>
<p>i always like the guy</p>
<p>and doing his club he&rsquo;s always nice to me</p>
<p>tom when i heard that shit</p>
<p>about him trying to get</p>
<p>15 percent from me he was kind of like a father to me</p>
<p>he was that he was really good and he actually did shit</p>
<p>that was amazing some of the shit he did was the best</p>
<p>stuff a manager</p>
<p>ever did for me when i went to montreal to do new faces</p>
<p>he sent a tape of me to</p>
<p>every single person</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to montreal</p>
<p>and i bombed at montreal bombed</p>
<p>and so i was fucked</p>
<p>and then all the people</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t go to montreal saw a tape that was great</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like he&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>what year was this</p>
<p>this was 2000</p>
<p>i think so people were stopping and</p>
<p>going to montreal by then</p>
<p>it was montreal</p>
<p>kinda died out</p>
<p>around that my year</p>
<p>my year of new faces was listened to this it was me</p>
<p>tony rock i believe was in it</p>
<p>dean edwards who got saturday</p>
<p>night live that year dimitri martin</p>
<p>mike berglia</p>
<p>russ moneve</p>
<p>like everybody got something big out of it</p>
<p>and so it was</p>
<p>like the last year then and it was the last year</p>
<p>cause chicken was the year before</p>
<p>yeah that was what i was</p>
<p>gonna bring up we were talking</p>
<p>about this i</p>
<p>think we brought</p>
<p>up chicken on the podcast before didn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>well chicken god rest his soul</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most amazing phenomena</p>
<p>and this is the proof that</p>
<p>agents and managers have no fucking</p>
<p>idea they just don&rsquo;t get it they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny and what&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p>some of them don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i should say</p>
<p>this guy he was this</p>
<p>young kid who is just real boyishly handsome</p>
<p>and he had this really</p>
<p>wacky act like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a screw</p>
<p>loose in him</p>
<p>and he had this like really like</p>
<p>completely over the top act that just</p>
<p>would baffle comedians</p>
<p>they would go this is not funny</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get it oh</p>
<p>dude it was all like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you one i remember i audition</p>
<p>for snl with them</p>
<p>he went on stage</p>
<p>and said so and so when they hit a home</p>
<p>run you ever see him they just jog around the bases</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like they just casually</p>
<p>jog around if they hit a home run he&rsquo;s like that was me</p>
<p>if i hit a home run</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be like whoa</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>yeah and he&rsquo;d like do like flips on</p>
<p>stage and run around the audience and like</p>
<p>throw his arms in the air</p>
<p>and be like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be flinging shit in the air out of my and</p>
<p>everything but people</p>
<p>would almost like</p>
<p>you know if you just see a</p>
<p>crazy man jumping up and down in a</p>
<p>nightclub you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>dudes pretty</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s what he was</p>
<p>yeah he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t that talented he</p>
<p>tried really hard anyway he</p>
<p>wound up getting this</p>
<p>giant development deal</p>
<p>and just being a complete total bust</p>
<p>like they couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything with him he was just not talented it was just</p>
<p>awful and so</p>
<p>he went into this sort of dark</p>
<p>depression and then</p>
<p>comics hated him</p>
<p>like he was a</p>
<p>punchline for comedians</p>
<p>a bunch of them who just shit all over him</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>come you know</p>
<p>comics are for one guy&rsquo;s doing better than you and you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s not as good as you it&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>venomous hate</p>
<p>so this kid</p>
<p>wound up killing himself in</p>
<p>front of a school</p>
<p>he hung himself on a tree in</p>
<p>front of a school</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>i know that part of i know</p>
<p>i heard the</p>
<p>story when he was at montreal though</p>
<p>like there was so much hype on him</p>
<p>going into montreal that</p>
<p>like that they were</p>
<p>bidding on him before he even went on</p>
<p>stage and i</p>
<p>think he did</p>
<p>as he was going on</p>
<p>stage someone said to his manager</p>
<p>like one of the networks</p>
<p>goes like we&rsquo;ll give you a million dollars if he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t step on that</p>
<p>stage cause they knew</p>
<p>his price would even go up once he went on stage</p>
<p>and a million dollars</p>
<p>well his development</p>
<p>deal was a half a million</p>
<p>that was it i&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s what he got</p>
<p>so they said like we&rsquo;ll give you half a million for at</p>
<p>least that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>rumor was not to</p>
<p>go on stage</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>the bidding to even go up further so i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a lot of hype yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that really happened</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really nobody does that</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>a lot of people that were into this kid and</p>
<p>comics we&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>standing in the back of the room</p>
<p>watching this kid</p>
<p>flail around on</p>
<p>stage and you know like</p>
<p>literally flail</p>
<p>you know and like he was on fire</p>
<p>and go what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>these are clips of him online you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good question michael ruth was his name i</p>
<p>think i met him</p>
<p>the night we did snl</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all back</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re auditioning caroline&rsquo;s and we&rsquo;re all in the</p>
<p>green room and he comes into the</p>
<p>green room and all the</p>
<p>comics kind of know each other</p>
<p>and then he shows up in the green room</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got this energy you know</p>
<p>those energy like</p>
<p>vampires that just</p>
<p>suck all the energy away from everyone else</p>
<p>he starts bouncing around the room going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what i&rsquo;m fucking doing here this is like</p>
<p>snls here and i&rsquo;m fucking like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even a comedian</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what you like this is</p>
<p>crazy you guys like do your shit and i just get up on</p>
<p>stage and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>wacky and fucking crazy and</p>
<p>and everyone was just kind of you know</p>
<p>comics were all looking at each</p>
<p>other like dude you</p>
<p>it was almost like he was</p>
<p>psyching us out too</p>
<p>right because we&rsquo;re all trying to</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>is a big deal for us we&rsquo;re all trying to get on</p>
<p>it and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bringing you into his head yeah</p>
<p>and i thought that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what he was doing and i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re fucking with me</p>
<p>right now and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to punch you in the face</p>
<p>so you thought he was doing it on purpose yeah and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna put someone</p>
<p>really do that</p>
<p>i think there are guys that are</p>
<p>they kind of do that really yeah how</p>
<p>would that work though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird strategy to go out and</p>
<p>did you get anything i found some</p>
<p>videos if you want to listen to one yeah let&rsquo;s listen</p>
<p>to one i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>comics that go yeah that&rsquo;s him man you go</p>
<p>house the room</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>about him how he&rsquo;s dead yeah</p>
<p>did it say oh he killed himself no</p>
<p>you guys got a lot of</p>
<p>white suburban gangster kids here i ain&rsquo;t got a</p>
<p>voice you guys got a lot of</p>
<p>white suburban gangster kids here</p>
<p>not me but white suburban gangster kids</p>
<p>seventeen year old caucasian boys that look like me</p>
<p>fuck you they said that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>black and raised in the hood</p>
<p>walk around the mall here they got the</p>
<p>pants hanging off their ass got the hat on</p>
<p>quick and oh shit what&rsquo;s up motherfucker</p>
<p>oh shit oh oh oh oh shit</p>
<p>shit he pulled his pants down</p>
<p>it looked like a thong he had on</p>
<p>what a problem</p>
<p>like three days your cell phone we got fax machines</p>
<p>forty five pounds of gold got a seven gold chain</p>
<p>three gold ring two gold teeth in the</p>
<p>whole fucking time his name&rsquo;s bradley</p>
<p>dumb as shit driving his mama&rsquo;s minivan</p>
<p>no thank you to watching the dance clubs</p>
<p>doing all those booty dances you know damn</p>
<p>fuck you dude you can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>he pulled his pants down again</p>
<p>his name is michael roof r o o f</p>
<p>so anyway that&rsquo;s enough of that</p>
<p>anyway that&rsquo;s not terrible i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>worst comedy i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard what&rsquo;s funny when he was</p>
<p>pulling down his pants the</p>
<p>first time he had</p>
<p>taken his underwear and i gave</p>
<p>himself a wedgie so it looked like he had a thong on</p>
<p>it was like a little</p>
<p>touch a little</p>
<p>extra touch nice</p>
<p>there that was</p>
<p>nice he jazzed up the bit</p>
<p>i like the tagline the new</p>
<p>butt crack tagline he added</p>
<p>you know whatever man nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>i mean i mean it&rsquo;s not my style</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into it</p>
<p>he was in like</p>
<p>lockdown really yeah</p>
<p>well he you know he had</p>
<p>that big development deal and nothing happened for it</p>
<p>and then i remember like</p>
<p>so many people were so fucking</p>
<p>happy when nothing happened to it</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it got really ugly for him like</p>
<p>comics were</p>
<p>happy that he was failing</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>there was like</p>
<p>a lot of negative energy towards this but</p>
<p>they used him as an example they</p>
<p>said like he killed the development</p>
<p>yes he did he did kill it</p>
<p>they gave him a</p>
<p>ton of money</p>
<p>and that was it</p>
<p>what really killed it was</p>
<p>their lack of real</p>
<p>talent and ability</p>
<p>to recognize</p>
<p>talent you know these</p>
<p>comics or these</p>
<p>agents and managers they&rsquo;re really just taking guesses</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what killed it what killed it was all</p>
<p>these big people that</p>
<p>spent a lot of money</p>
<p>and people that were the head of</p>
<p>studios and people that you know they had a</p>
<p>budget and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like why did we</p>
<p>spend half a million dollars on this fucking</p>
<p>thing like what is this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of that</p>
<p>going on man</p>
<p>you know like this</p>
<p>the friends guy if they sat that guy down said just</p>
<p>write us a couple of</p>
<p>scripts real quick</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s look at your</p>
<p>scripts let&rsquo;s look at your</p>
<p>scripts they read their</p>
<p>scripts and then dude</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t read anything from</p>
<p>this guy before you got this deal i know they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i know the whole</p>
<p>story behind it everybody was so high on them they just</p>
<p>want to throw this guy money</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve looked at a</p>
<p>bunch of scripts lately and i&rsquo;m like death</p>
<p>death right</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve read a couple of them and</p>
<p>i sigh and i look down at it and i go no i&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>going in i can&rsquo;t go in i can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>you know yeah it</p>
<p>would be nice to do a sitcom</p>
<p>again i love doing news</p>
<p>radio it was a lot of fun</p>
<p>but good luck trying to find another one of</p>
<p>those by the way dave foley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do the podcast</p>
<p>got in touch with dave foley</p>
<p>no way yeah</p>
<p>very excited</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>getting a hold of one of</p>
<p>those sitcoms is like</p>
<p>a fucking one in a million and so if you don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>what are you dealing with well you&rsquo;re dealing with a</p>
<p>bunch of producers</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really know how to do comedy</p>
<p>dealing with a</p>
<p>bunch of writers most of them are not</p>
<p>going to be talented</p>
<p>because if they were talented they&rsquo;d be working for</p>
<p>modern family</p>
<p>or some of those big shows</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that many really good ones that are out there free</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like your odds of</p>
<p>finding you know a good one are like one in 10 you know</p>
<p>maybe maybe one in 20 yeah i</p>
<p>paul prevents</p>
<p>and i started writing</p>
<p>a movie together on this idea that i had</p>
<p>and i met paul in</p>
<p>edinburgh i was doing the</p>
<p>edinburgh festival and i</p>
<p>kind of did the</p>
<p>thing is a bit and he&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>i said oh yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried to write a movie</p>
<p>about that and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hey you should</p>
<p>write that fucking movie</p>
<p>this is the bit that</p>
<p>you said is the same as my bit the one that i talked</p>
<p>about on the show</p>
<p>very similar</p>
<p>i had a bit that i used to do</p>
<p>i did it back in the 90s</p>
<p>i just talked</p>
<p>about it on the show the</p>
<p>other day because</p>
<p>we were both on the</p>
<p>green room show together</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about like being booed off</p>
<p>stage and like when</p>
<p>people want you to change the subject you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about and how people get</p>
<p>upset at you</p>
<p>and i said that i used to do this joke</p>
<p>about cloning jesus</p>
<p>because there was a</p>
<p>thing called a</p>
<p>second coming project and the</p>
<p>second coming project was like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>named the script was the</p>
<p>second coming because it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the guy jerking off was the opening</p>
<p>scene really yeah okay</p>
<p>there was a real</p>
<p>thing that was in the news</p>
<p>about this many many years ago anyway this</p>
<p>the idea was they were</p>
<p>gonna take like dna from the shroud of turn</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna recreate jesus</p>
<p>they were gonna like</p>
<p>clone jesus</p>
<p>but my joke was like and this is a real</p>
<p>thing like they really</p>
<p>think sort of i&rsquo;m not sure it</p>
<p>might have been a parody</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>those that sneak</p>
<p>through by the way rachel matto got busted on a parody</p>
<p>the other day</p>
<p>she was reading a parody</p>
<p>this christian</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fake website</p>
<p>and she was reading</p>
<p>as if it was news</p>
<p>palance supporters really believe that</p>
<p>we have to inject</p>
<p>christianity into</p>
<p>north africa</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny so my</p>
<p>bid was dolly the</p>
<p>sheep you know when they</p>
<p>clone dolly the</p>
<p>sheep that shit didn&rsquo;t come out perfect like</p>
<p>cloning is not an</p>
<p>exact science like</p>
<p>what do they do with the first</p>
<p>jesus of the</p>
<p>clone i mean he comes out retarded</p>
<p>do you kill him and</p>
<p>start from scratch</p>
<p>or do you just you</p>
<p>know and so there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>whole bit about it</p>
<p>when i did it</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>store someone was yelling out</p>
<p>next subject</p>
<p>fat white woman</p>
<p>with fat blonde</p>
<p>hair and fat blonde fingers</p>
<p>just that you know i&rsquo;m a christian</p>
<p>next subject</p>
<p>like she was so firm and her</p>
<p>wonky beliefs</p>
<p>that she wanted to stop i love</p>
<p>those people it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>theoretical idea i mean it&rsquo;s not a real</p>
<p>jesus we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>this is a and it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>legit question if they really do</p>
<p>clone jesus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>legit question like what if they found</p>
<p>jesus&rsquo;s bones and there was some dna inside of it</p>
<p>and they could</p>
<p>extract it they knew for sure it was deep</p>
<p>jesus they knew it was his dna</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>legit question what if he does come back retarded</p>
<p>because he could come back all fucked up there</p>
<p>could be all sorts that he</p>
<p>could be autistic and</p>
<p>psychopath he could be</p>
<p>black as fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what it is what if he was that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think jesus was</p>
<p>black yeah because you can&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>off white and then go</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that jesus</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even real</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that there was no</p>
<p>jesus that&rsquo;s done mythology yeah and</p>
<p>that this same mythology</p>
<p>repeats itself over and over and over again so</p>
<p>jesus even as a historical figure</p>
<p>is in question you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s like you know volumes of</p>
<p>pages written</p>
<p>about you know certain caesars and certain you</p>
<p>know rulers of</p>
<p>greece and rome so</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>jesus is so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to tell whether it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>well and also all</p>
<p>those biblical</p>
<p>fucking you know like</p>
<p>everything from all the</p>
<p>matthew mark luke and john there was like</p>
<p>there was the book of q to</p>
<p>know but that</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>fifth book of the gospels</p>
<p>apparently that luke</p>
<p>based his book on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not completely accurate and all this</p>
<p>stuff but if you</p>
<p>start reading</p>
<p>about it you&rsquo;ll find out</p>
<p>that like all four of them didn&rsquo;t live at the same time</p>
<p>so some of them base</p>
<p>their account on the</p>
<p>other ones because they&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>identical of the other one</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s like they just</p>
<p>just based heard a</p>
<p>story yeah and just rewrote it</p>
<p>which could have happened from the beginning</p>
<p>and then there was also like the council of nicea</p>
<p>where these guys went in and decided</p>
<p>the bishops all went okay well we&rsquo;ve got all</p>
<p>these books we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna throw out</p>
<p>these ones we don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>these we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna keep the</p>
<p>they just rewrote history the way they wanted it so</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that on there well you if you find out</p>
<p>about the new testament that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where things get really</p>
<p>weird because constantine and a</p>
<p>bunch of bishops created</p>
<p>a new testament that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something that was way</p>
<p>after jesus</p>
<p>death you know if</p>
<p>jesus was a real figure</p>
<p>the whole thing is fucking squirrely</p>
<p>you know the historical account just</p>
<p>me not even saying the religious account the historical</p>
<p>account is very squirrely</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>saying something</p>
<p>about recreate</p>
<p>like dolly being retarded</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve often wondered</p>
<p>like you know when like a dog bites someone</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like oh he&rsquo;s a bad dog or whatever i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you see people</p>
<p>all the time like</p>
<p>people with down syndrome</p>
<p>are there like down</p>
<p>syndrome dogs</p>
<p>yes oh yeah mine&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>syndrome mine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real fucking my</p>
<p>dog&rsquo;s retired yeah it&rsquo;s totally retired</p>
<p>your dogs just really really overbred</p>
<p>you know you have a</p>
<p>you have one of</p>
<p>those little dogs yeah what&rsquo;s it called again</p>
<p>pekingese yeah those dogs man</p>
<p>guess what that came from a wolf</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no way you get a good example if that</p>

<p>think my dog might be part wolf</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s an aussie cattle dog and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i grew up with jack</p>
<p>russell terriers you ever see those little</p>

<p>under the road</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m looking down the sewer grate i see him</p>

<p>apart from the</p>
<p>second time</p>
<p>they were fucking junkie</p>
<p>texting and tweeting</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s trying to have some convoluted conversation</p>
<p>they said they&rsquo;ll rip your dog</p>
<p>apart and i said well what</p>
<p>about the rabies and</p>
<p>the rabies aren&rsquo;t bad in</p>
<p>california but uh</p>

<p>used to fuck up trash cans</p>
<p>he was gigantic i mean it was like a dog</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>how big he was and i got a blow gun just so i</p>
<p>could try to kill him</p>
<p>and i was terrified i opened the door it was</p>
<p>small i had a</p>
<p>small little yard</p>
<p>and i would open the door and he</p>
<p>would literally be fucking ten feet from me i panic and</p>
<p>slam the door</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like get out of here bitch</p>
<p>my old dog cabo at once i</p>
<p>let him out the backyard and just to go to the bathroom</p>
<p>and i let him out and instead i hear him going</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>so i go outside and there&rsquo;s two skunks</p>
<p>i cornered in my little backyard</p>
<p>and the dog&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to attack him</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just thinking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>sprayed i want the dog to get</p>
<p>sprayed you know takes forever to</p>
<p>clean that shit off</p>
<p>my dog got sprayed when i was a little kid</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>it takes forever</p>
<p>you use tomato juice</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s an enzyme</p>
<p>in tomatoes that helps</p>
<p>break it down but not much</p>
<p>tomato and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>that good you</p>
<p>gotta keep doing it over and over and over</p>
<p>again that dog</p>
<p>stunk for weeks have you ever heard the</p>
<p>billy burr bit</p>
<p>about raccoons</p>
<p>was the raccoon and the little hand</p>
<p>stealing the cat the youtube video</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hardest i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>laughed at a joke in my life i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m must honor</p>
<p>i saw him at the improv</p>
<p>one night it</p>
<p>was recently so it&rsquo;s probably like in his new set</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s billy show you know</p>
<p>angry billy gets right</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>angry watching this youtube video</p>
<p>where a raccoon keeps stealing</p>
<p>like cat food like it comes over and keeps</p>
<p>stealing the</p>
<p>food from the cat or from the dog or something</p>
<p>and he keeps</p>
<p>going this little</p>
<p>fucking raccoon hands</p>
<p>and tears were coming out of my eyes i was</p>
<p>laughing i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>laughed that hard at a comics</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s so angry</p>
<p>about the little hands</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like the fucking little mask on this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty crazy that</p>
<p>all dogs came from wolves</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>when they figured out the genetic lineage of dogs they</p>
<p>expected to be a</p>
<p>bunch of wild canids in there a</p>
<p>bunch of different kinds of canines</p>
<p>nope wolves</p>
<p>all originally was a wolf</p>
<p>what about a dingo</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different kind of dog</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a canada wild dog okay i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>specific ones like</p>
<p>the dingo doesn&rsquo;t come from</p>
<p>a wolf does it i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s good question it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>australian dingo um</p>
<p>yeah the dingoes eat babies</p>

<p>everything&rsquo;s groovy</p>
<p>and no plague</p>
<p>just eat nuts you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to eat garbage okay cool cool have you seen the</p>
<p>viral video yet of the rat that goes up the guy&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>what oh yes on the subway</p>
<p>you get everybody&rsquo;s to tell me</p>
<p>new york city rats are fucking terrifying</p>
<p>i remember when i</p>
<p>lived in new york</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;ve told the</p>
<p>story but i&rsquo;ll tell it</p>
<p>again for this</p>
<p>i was at a gas station once and i went to use a cell</p>
<p>phone a pay</p>
<p>phone this is how old</p>
<p>the story is</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone</p>
<p>so i step away from my car</p>
<p>while my car is pumping gas</p>
<p>and i go to the pay phone</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m on the pay phone and</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m on the pay phone i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching rats</p>
<p>big ones like cats</p>
<p>jump in the</p>
<p>wheel housing of my car</p>
<p>climb on the tires</p>
<p>climb down and i am in your car</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m fucking 15 feet away</p>
<p>i stepped over to use the pay</p>
<p>phone and as i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing there on the</p>
<p>phone i&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>these rats and</p>
<p>they keep going down this opening in the manhole</p>
<p>there must have been</p>
<p>thousands of them down there</p>
<p>the way they were coming up so quickly</p>
<p>and in such like</p>
<p>rapid succession one</p>
<p>after the other one</p>
<p>after the other</p>
<p>and then down one</p>
<p>after the other one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like there&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>of them down there</p>
<p>i would have called</p>
<p>911 and reported my car stolen</p>
<p>so scary dude</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more rats than people in</p>
<p>the area like four</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s four rats for</p>
<p>every person oh my</p>
<p>i was walking down mcdougall</p>
<p>street one time home from the cellar one night</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>walking through in there you know people with</p>
<p>their garbage out in the</p>
<p>street for the garbage went to pick them up</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going between garbage and a</p>
<p>building and</p>
<p>all of a sudden</p>
<p>a rat just runs out from the garbage and uses my</p>
<p>foot as like a hurdle its little feet touched my foot</p>
<p>and it was the most i&rsquo;ve ever been like a</p>
<p>woman in my life i</p>
<p>started like jumping up and down like screaming</p>
<p>screaming because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that fucking like adrenaline</p>
<p>rush goes and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like ah</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>imagine if a rat was as big as you</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re such pussies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re such pussies compared to animals ah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so soft and mushy and fleshy</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s the filth</p>
<p>though of the rats that&rsquo;s just the filth</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re furious</p>
<p>those are wild that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>scare me as much as</p>
<p>the filth of them</p>
<p>you feel like they</p>
<p>carry hepatitis and</p>
<p>fucking aids and</p>
<p>everything yeah i mean the</p>
<p>black plague</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that connected to rats isn&rsquo;t that all</p>
<p>about rats why not a</p>
<p>bunch of plagues have been</p>
<p>about rats i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re horrible carriers</p>
<p>of diseases</p>
<p>who was it jim norton and</p>
<p>i think as jim norton and rich</p>
<p>voss used to</p>
<p>go to this one park in new york and sit there and</p>
<p>watch the rats and they said you</p>
<p>would see like</p>
<p>thousands of</p>
<p>these rats dude there&rsquo;s so many of them manhattan</p>
<p>manhattan is so</p>
<p>crazy with rats</p>
<p>i was at a pool</p>
<p>hall once in new jersey this is the scariest</p>
<p>right i ever saw so my friend john we went</p>
<p>we were doing a gig and we stopped home</p>
<p>from the gig to play some pool we stopped this pool</p>
<p>get out of the car</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;m walking towards the door there&rsquo;s a dumpster</p>
<p>like outside</p>
<p>and as i passed by the dumpster there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>biggest rat i have</p>
<p>ever seen in my life i mean</p>
<p>it is like a raccoon</p>
<p>it was gigantic</p>
<p>so no bullshit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not bullshitting it was two and a half</p>
<p>maybe three feet long in the body</p>
<p>it was enormous</p>
<p>it had these</p>
<p>huge fucking</p>
<p>nasty yellow teeth</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know if it was sick</p>
<p>or if it was</p>
<p>dying i mean it</p>
<p>might have been an old</p>
<p>age because it was so big it</p>
<p>might have been the end of the line for this fucking</p>
<p>thing but it was up on its back legs it was</p>
<p>going like this to me</p>
<p>and i was thinking do i kick this</p>
<p>thing do i get a rock</p>
<p>what the fuck i was</p>
<p>just such a little girly man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll never forget the</p>
<p>noise you gotta</p>
<p>think with all the</p>
<p>poison they lay down like you&rsquo;ll see the signs in the</p>
<p>subway saying you know</p>
<p>careful there&rsquo;s like poison</p>
<p>everywhere around</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got to be adapting</p>
<p>and mutating</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re making some fucking</p>
<p>scary rat is just course right yeah</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what happens with bacteria</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>immersa it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that staph infection</p>
<p>that people get that&rsquo;s antibiotic resistant that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is from fucking is that like the superbug</p>
<p>yeah well the</p>
<p>mersa is the</p>
<p>super staff it said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it actually</p>
<p>stands for but it&rsquo;s something resistant</p>
<p>staff so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>antibiotic resistant</p>
<p>so when people get it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really really dangerous and it&rsquo;s really just created by</p>
<p>human beings by</p>
<p>you know us</p>
<p>fighting off different versions</p>
<p>till the only ones to survive were</p>
<p>super fucking</p>
<p>strong that&rsquo;s why i just read the</p>
<p>other day that and 80</p>
<p>of all the antibiotics in america are</p>
<p>given to animals</p>
<p>like they pump them so full of antibiotics</p>
<p>and the same bacteria that we used antibiotics to</p>
<p>fight off so do</p>
<p>animals so all the antibiotics</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking is causing the bacteria to mutate</p>
<p>which is making us immune to</p>
<p>these antibiotics too</p>
<p>hmm is that true</p>
<p>because i was on</p>
<p>i did a thing</p>
<p>about i talked</p>
<p>about food inc you</p>
<p>never saw food inc</p>
<p>and i got contacted</p>
<p>and this is one of the coolest fucking</p>
<p>things about this podcast</p>
<p>i got contacted by a</p>
<p>bunch of scientists</p>
<p>food scientists</p>
<p>you know people who are</p>
<p>you know involved in you know the</p>
<p>these farms and</p>
<p>one guy who worked for a poultry company</p>
<p>and he was talking to me about it</p>
<p>let me find it here that shows</p>
<p>the difference between</p>
<p>your listeners and ours</p>
<p>you have all these</p>
<p>intelligent people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really interested we get guys who are like</p>
<p>you guys are fat cunts</p>
<p>well i get those two</p>
<p>watch corn too by the way if you ever get the chance to</p>
<p>watch the documentary</p>
<p>about monsanto</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they even go into more detail about</p>
<p>having holes on the side of the cows</p>
<p>so creepy and food</p>
<p>ink there&rsquo;s a hole inside</p>
<p>this town in</p>
<p>who was according this guy</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>when he wanted it and his name is</p>
<p>jacob kim so</p>
<p>thank you jacob</p>
<p>one of the things that he</p>
<p>explained to me</p>
<p>is that chickens are not on steroids and then</p>
<p>what it is is just genetic selection and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>naturally selected birds with bigger and bigger breasts</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>freaks so they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have survive if they were a real animal</p>
<p>but you know because we grow them just for their tits</p>
<p>so and he also said that what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to do is they&rsquo;re supposed to cycle</p>
<p>the antibiotics</p>
<p>so when a bird is sick say like they have a</p>
<p>cycle like there&rsquo;s 49 days he says to grow a bird</p>
<p>so in business terms the farmer sees</p>
<p>profits go down as the flock stays longer than that</p>
<p>so in the instance that a 30 day old flock gets sick</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re supposed to wait 21 days</p>
<p>before they kill them</p>
<p>so when they get sick they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna lose like 10 or 11 days of profit</p>
<p>so if they do something like that and lose</p>
<p>these days of profit</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like a problem with them so some</p>
<p>unscrupulous companies</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t follow that and then they send out the bird</p>
<p>you know like 15 days</p>
<p>later and the bird</p>
<p>still pumped up with antibiotics it has a process</p>
<p>to the system</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe it i know i fucking have</p>
<p>one thing that i didn&rsquo;t do right</p>
<p>oh shut it off</p>
<p>thanks at amp t</p>
<p>you fucking cunts</p>
<p>my new phone number is</p>
<p>you fuckheads for</p>

<p>gonna do put it on a banner and</p>
<p>raise it into the rafters at like the apollo theater or</p>
<p>a number it&rsquo;s retired</p>
<p>you know i apologize for</p>
<p>some gay guy gets mad at me and i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>flirt with him you</p>
<p>just blow him until he</p>
<p>goes to sleep</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be mad yeah i do a bit</p>
<p>right now where i say it i go</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the reason that like</p>
<p>gay men are more sexually</p>
<p>promiscuous than men and</p>
<p>women is because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got time and energy from not</p>
<p>fighting all the time because a gay fight</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just like hey</p>
<p>those shoes don&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>your belt and he&rsquo;s like really let&rsquo;s fuck and</p>
<p>you know like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>please gay guys beat the shit out and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other thing gay guys can beat the</p>
<p>other shit out of each</p>
<p>other and they</p>
<p>cop show up like what happened he</p>
<p>punched me we&rsquo;ll hit him back faggot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>so anyway back to this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the guy was explaining to me</p>
<p>so no steroids for</p>
<p>chickens that&rsquo;s not true but there it is true for cows</p>
<p>so cows are jacked</p>
<p>cows are totally jacked up on hormones</p>
<p>but no hormones at all</p>
<p>are no steroids</p>
<p>on chickens</p>
<p>cause i eat all</p>
<p>grass fed stuff</p>
<p>i order all my</p>
<p>meat from us wellness meats</p>
<p>dirty hippie</p>
<p>yeah no no it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>grass fed beef tastes</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>fucking had a</p>
<p>strip last night and pork chops</p>
<p>grass fed pork</p>
<p>chops yeah i ordered</p>
<p>we need pop</p>
<p>shields by the way because pork chops makes a big</p>
<p>yeah terrible</p>
<p>noise in people&rsquo;s ears</p>
<p>i ordered those</p>
<p>but i yeah i eat</p>
<p>the paleo diet</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>that yeah so i eat that diet and i&rsquo;m into all the</p>
<p>grass fed shit</p>
<p>and my chicken breast that i get</p>
<p>are grass fed and they&rsquo;re fucking massive</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>this is weird i</p>
<p>heard the whole</p>
<p>thing was when you buy organic and grass</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just not getting</p>
<p>the fuck they&rsquo;re bigger</p>
<p>chemicals in the grass</p>
<p>yeah how&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>possible i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>steroids yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on that grass</p>
<p>oh hey so what did you</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>movie into the void to the void i saw it last</p>
<p>night i shut it off</p>
<p>after the car accident when</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>the parents were killed in the car accident i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>you just you</p>
<p>showed me a girl who&rsquo;s a prostitute and a stripper</p>
<p>okay and then you showed her</p>
<p>happy family</p>
<p>fuck you okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more science fiction than the dmt shit</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just shitty writing to me you&rsquo;re showing me</p>
<p>this girl who loves her brother</p>
<p>and how much do you love me i love you so much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just jerking with my emotions man this isn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>story writing this is nonsense</p>
<p>what i liked</p>
<p>about the movie was</p>
<p>the first person perspective</p>
<p>it was like i was in a video game</p>
<p>that was cool the</p>
<p>blinking of the eye</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>you could actually see it</p>
<p>where the character</p>
<p>blinks they</p>
<p>would have it</p>
<p>randomly every 5 10</p>
<p>seconds and then</p>
<p>when he goes into the dmt trip did you</p>
<p>think that was pretty realistic</p>
<p>no i thought it was</p>
<p>amazing it was interesting yeah but it wasn&rsquo;t realistic</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t explain what the dmt trip looks to</p>
<p>a person you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recreate it with like cgi</p>
<p>because what it is isn&rsquo;t possible</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>but when you have a dmt trip</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeing anything that can be recreated</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to recreate it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m watching there was just some</p>
<p>swirly cool shit and like really interesting but</p>
<p>when you see it</p>
<p>when you see</p>
<p>a dm teacher it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s a million</p>
<p>things at the same time it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different things</p>
<p>no matter how you</p>
<p>depending how you look at it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different thing</p>
<p>i really liked how there was so much detail too</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve noticed this on past hallucinate</p>
<p>trips before like</p>
<p>little things like</p>
<p>after he was tripping</p>
<p>like he shut</p>
<p>this door and the door kind of had like a red</p>
<p>pulse when he shut it</p>
<p>and stuff like that</p>
<p>now what did you</p>
<p>think about the big</p>
<p>even at the very beginning</p>
<p>where you were</p>
<p>hypnotized in a seizure</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>flashing all</p>
<p>those logos that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy like that happens throughout the</p>
<p>movie in some</p>
<p>points you&rsquo;re just like all</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>brainwashing me</p>
<p>right now this</p>
<p>is this is like from the government or google yeah</p>
<p>hey dm that</p>
<p>that kind of shit though i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to wonder</p>
<p>about that with i&rsquo;m such a</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist but i am paranoid</p>
<p>so really i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>completely paranoid and</p>
<p>or i can get there and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta like close the</p>
<p>neuro pathways</p>
<p>you know and just fucking like try to</p>
<p>bring myself back from it</p>
<p>cause i can go totally into that</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>anything like a fucking sitcom</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>well you had a real</p>
<p>freak out recently then we talked</p>
<p>about this on the</p>
<p>green room where</p>
<p>you you got</p>
<p>super paranoid from weed</p>
<p>yeah and i&rsquo;ve had it happen</p>
<p>it was the second time it happened the</p>
<p>first time i</p>
<p>ate a pot cookie in australia the</p>
<p>second time i just smoked</p>
<p>but you said something</p>
<p>really interesting to me you know he said i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke pot i said yes you can</p>
<p>he said i have to go to therapy first yeah</p>
<p>like what do you have to go therapy</p>
<p>about breathing</p>
<p>exercises i don&rsquo;t fucking know but it just put me into</p>
<p>panic attacks and</p>
<p>well i thought</p>

<p>no more getting into personal details but</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>

<p>nobody knows what the fuck it does to you</p>
<p>you know nobody tells you they just sell</p>
<p>these things at the pot stores</p>
<p>oh is that a pot</p>
<p>brownie oh i&rsquo;ll try eating it</p>
<p>not knowing that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s way more powerful</p>
<p>way way more</p>
<p>powerful and it lasts forever</p>
<p>i ate a pop</p>
<p>brownie once and i</p>
<p>swear to god it lasted</p>
<p>twelve hours yeah this</p>
<p>first one lasted</p>
<p>about twelve fucking</p>

<p>funny i was having a great time</p>
<p>i was in adelaide</p>
<p>australia i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>drinking all day</p>

<p>nothing happened i go i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have the</p>
<p>other half and they were like all</p>
<p>right i did the</p>
<p>other half having a</p>
<p>great time and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i turned around</p>
<p>i got to go to the</p>
<p>kitchen i turned around and looked at</p>
<p>these girls and i go</p>
<p>make it stop</p>
<p>whatever we have to do</p>
<p>to stop this let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stop your trip</p>

<p>all right calm down and i&rsquo;m like no no</p>
<p>no we need to fucking</p>
<p>stop this and they&rsquo;re like why you being such a bitch</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but what</p>
<p>started happening it was around a</p>
<p>bunch of girls</p>
<p>man why don&rsquo;t you pull it together hey remember when i</p>
<p>tripped out of fear factor i had to sit with all those</p>
<p>girl interns in</p>
<p>their car and i kept</p>
<p>it together though</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t yell</p>
<p>at anybody to make it stop i thought my eyeballs were</p>
<p>shocked him when he</p>
<p>first came here from ohio he had nothing</p>
<p>he had no resistance he was used to this ohio weed</p>
<p>which you might as well have been</p>
<p>mexican brickweed</p>
<p>might as well been smoking talcum powder and</p>
<p>nonsense that&rsquo;s a terrible example cold bond</p>
<p>and i gave him a pot lollipop</p>
<p>these fucking beyond bomb</p>
<p>before beyond bomb went to jail</p>
<p>they were operating a</p>
<p>multi million</p>
<p>dollar operation out of oakland and the dea</p>
<p>rated them during</p>
<p>the bush administration and we had two</p>
<p>we had one on the way there</p>
<p>and then like half hour later</p>
<p>you feel anything i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>no not really and then so we took another one cause</p>
<p>i think you were new to the</p>
<p>lollipops too at the time</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>the length of how long</p>
<p>the wait this is getting me a</p>
<p>panic attack right now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sitting and</p>
<p>he drops me and goes oh hang out here in this</p>
<p>trailer it was like the</p>
<p>trailer with all the managers and directors</p>
<p>producers and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just thinking</p>
<p>about not knowing anybody</p>
<p>and it hits me they were all</p>
<p>super friendly oh they&rsquo;re totally cool but i mean my</p>
<p>heart started</p>
<p>pounding i started</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>i go and sit on the curb and then in between</p>
<p>breaks you come out like how you doing i&rsquo;m like dude</p>
<p>fucking stone</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m having a</p>
<p>panic attack</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like dude i</p>
<p>still have a mic on everyone and so now</p>
<p>everybody in the</p>
<p>trailer now hears me and</p>
<p>so then he&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>drop me off in</p>
<p>these interns</p>
<p>car and just sat there and talked</p>
<p>about fucking</p>
<p>sex in the city or something</p>
<p>i think i told you this i know</p>
<p>these little dudes that i used to kind of</p>
<p>it was a girl that was friends with</p>
<p>their little brothers</p>
<p>and they were big potheads in high school</p>
<p>and we used to hang around we were in college at</p>
<p>their house and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d always they were up to note like they&rsquo;d grow in</p>
<p>their backyard they</p>
<p>tried everything</p>
<p>so they were making pot cookies one</p>
<p>night and they make them and they</p>
<p>leave them out</p>
<p>kind of a wealthy family they have like a maid and</p>
<p>everything they</p>
<p>leave the pot</p>
<p>cookies out because parents are always out of town</p>
<p>the maid puts them in baggies and puts them</p>
<p>in the cookie canister</p>
<p>dad comes home</p>
<p>grabs two cookies</p>
<p>two full cookies and eats them</p>
<p>rushed to the hospital</p>
<p>thinking he&rsquo;s having a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>and i say to the kid like they&rsquo;re telling me the</p>
<p>story i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>so did you tell him they&rsquo;re like fuck no wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious so did he ever figure out that he was</p>
<p>medicated like the</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>had a panic attack</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>one kid went to jail because</p>
<p>they dosed their</p>
<p>teacher up in school</p>
<p>they gave the</p>
<p>teacher pot cookies</p>
<p>i remember in high</p>
<p>school we used to always</p>
<p>try to sneak in</p>
<p>laxatives in our</p>
<p>teacher&rsquo;s coffees and</p>
<p>stuff and then</p>
<p>i look back and i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s fucking rude</p>
<p>cause i mean i remember getting like</p>
<p>melting dangerous</p>
<p>and pouring the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>dangerous too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s evil i heard</p>
<p>about a fraternity once you know all</p>
<p>these dumb fraternity pranks</p>
<p>at where i was this college like george</p>
<p>mason when i was doing</p>
<p>a show there they go oh yeah we got this fraternity</p>
<p>that at the end of hell week they</p>
<p>they feed them spaghetti</p>
<p>they give them</p>
<p>this big spaghetti dinner that the like little</p>
<p>sisters make for them</p>
<p>and then they feed</p>
<p>them like chocolate pudding but it&rsquo;s full of ex lacks</p>
<p>and then they make them</p>
<p>climb a tree</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>spend the night in a tree like</p>
<p>the top guy</p>
<p>gets to go to the top of the tree</p>
<p>and all the way down</p>
<p>so like if you&rsquo;re an asshole</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re down at the bottom so they&rsquo;re shitting on</p>
<p>each other they&rsquo;re just all shitty</p>
<p>like a tree fraternity</p>
<p>things are so disgusting</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just preparing you for just to be</p>
<p>fucked with</p>
<p>and being some cunty</p>
<p>group where you get to fuck with new people</p>
<p>just taking advantage of the people that have the</p>
<p>least amount of power</p>
<p>and the people that want the most from you</p>
<p>the only good thing</p>
<p>about fraternities was</p>
<p>going to their parties</p>
<p>and like fucking those</p>
<p>their sorority girls i did</p>
<p>stand up at a fraternity once i&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s supposed to i know i did a lot of college</p>
<p>a lot of college gigs and like</p>
<p>weird spots like</p>

<p>and she would just</p>
<p>open up like</p>
<p>he said he didn&rsquo;t even know what it</p>
<p>was she just be like open up and just pop them in his</p>
<p>mouth and make them</p>
<p>drink it down</p>
<p>well you know when you develop a kid incorrectly</p>
<p>some people are just</p>
<p>mentally imbalanced that is a fact there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>there their hormone</p>
<p>levels or their</p>
<p>chemical levels their</p>
<p>brain are just fucked up and they do need some help</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people that just were</p>
<p>somebody raised them shitty</p>
<p>just did a terrible job barely fucking</p>
<p>paid attention to him and the kid developed all this</p>
<p>nutty behavior</p>
<p>and getting it out of someone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way harder</p>
<p>to get something out of something someone</p>
<p>once it&rsquo;s in there once they&rsquo;ve already developed some</p>
<p>wacky patterns</p>
<p>or behavior and they have like a certain associations</p>
<p>very difficult to get that to change</p>
<p>what if you could just</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s way easier to</p>
<p>raise them correctly from the beginning</p>
<p>to try to turn someone around once they&rsquo;re fucked up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how many people that you know</p>
<p>that are a mess</p>
<p>that have fucked up lives ever pull it together ever</p>
<p>you know ever</p>
<p>so few but so few people</p>
<p>with anything i know a chick</p>
<p>who used to prostitute herself oh</p>
<p>and she was like the nicest girl in the</p>
<p>world i knew</p>
<p>two girls that kind of like went to prostitution</p>
<p>and there you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>either these girls but she was doing like</p>
<p>craigs with</p>
<p>craigslist hooking and shit and um</p>
<p>she you know it had like the molestation</p>
<p>thing and all that fucked up stuff</p>
<p>and she went to therapy</p>
<p>and i said why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you tell you know did you what&rsquo;s your therapist say</p>
<p>about it and she&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t tell him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like well</p>
<p>you need to tell your therapist</p>
<p>that you were molested</p>
<p>and all this</p>
<p>stuff and work on that shit</p>
<p>and she did eventually</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>married and i</p>
<p>think she and</p>
<p>her life is good</p>
<p>it she really is a product of like it actually</p>
<p>cleaned up that problem</p>
<p>people can do it man you can change it&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>gotta be fucking goddamn committed</p>
<p>staying on that trout</p>
<p>you almost have to become</p>
<p>addicted to changing</p>
<p>you know you have to like</p>
<p>get so and it has to get ingrained in you so deeply</p>
<p>after so long a time</p>
<p>that it actually becomes your new way of</p>
<p>thinking and your new behavior</p>
<p>i mean if you</p>
<p>just go back and look at yourself i mean if i had to</p>
<p>be myself at</p>

<p>savage they have</p>
<p>they have a real fucking like</p>
<p>they call them blokes</p>
<p>like a guy&rsquo;s a bloke and they&rsquo;re very blokey</p>
<p>and women complain</p>
<p>about it like in</p>
<p>sydney i always say that like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even talk to a</p>
<p>woman in a bar</p>
<p>cause the guys have fucked them over so badly</p>
<p>you go up to</p>
<p>go and be like hi she be like go fuck yourself cunt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>really whoa what did i do and it&rsquo;s not what you</p>
<p>did it&rsquo;s what the last 20 guys that dealt with her did</p>
<p>so the girls are on the defense of and</p>
<p>cause the guys just it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about your boys</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t they have a different</p>
<p>attitude towards sex in australia they&rsquo;re much more</p>
<p>permissive much more</p>
<p>i would say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>fucking everywhere</p>
<p>but america</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>about america is how</p>
<p>i mean obviously</p>
<p>the middle east is</p>
<p>worse unless you&rsquo;re a little boy</p>
<p>but in the middle east they love</p>
<p>to fuck little boys that&rsquo;s an awesome time for them</p>
<p>but as far as</p>
<p>like european</p>
<p>countries we are so fucked up in</p>
<p>comparison to them like our</p>
<p>whole repression</p>
<p>all that shit that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist over there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in argentina</p>
<p>south america</p>
<p>south america commercials yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super long well i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard i&rsquo;ve heard i don&rsquo;t know how true this is i read</p>
<p>or it was in it was</p>
<p>statistic in</p>
<p>jesus camp did you see that film</p>
<p>it said two</p>
<p>thirds of america&rsquo;s born</p>
<p>again christians</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it said in the beginning of that film i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s correct i</p>
<p>think probably two</p>
<p>thirds of the people they talk to are</p>
<p>evangelical</p>
<p>you know finding the numbers</p>
<p>for 300 million people that&rsquo;s so problematic</p>
<p>not only that you</p>
<p>gotta add in mexicans</p>
<p>you know cause there&rsquo;s a lot of undocumented people in</p>
<p>this country and who knows how many it is i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard millions and millions in california</p>
<p>alone so who knows how many it is nationwide</p>
<p>so knowing how many people</p>
<p>are actually christians and</p>
<p>evangelical christians or people</p>
<p>who believe the</p>
<p>earth is less than ten thousand years old you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the numbers are who the fuck knows what the i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard fifty</p>
<p>one percent believe the</p>
<p>earth is less than ten thousand years old</p>
<p>fifty one percent believe</p>
<p>in a biblical version of the bible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>oh which by the way play that fucking clip i say yeah</p>
<p>god we have to play this clip bill o&rsquo;reilly man</p>
<p>now by the way bill o&rsquo;reilly went to fucking harvard i</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>riley&rsquo;s i think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>troll i think he&rsquo;s playing a character i think you</p>
<p>might be rob</p>
<p>almost pause i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s very clever as to what</p>
<p>like the kind of shit that</p>
<p>he supports and the way he supports it is so asinine</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trolling it&rsquo;s almost like a</p>
<p>subtle parody</p>
<p>yeah here&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>think that i used to do</p>
<p>sports radio in new york city i was on</p>
<p>wwe which is</p>
<p>the station</p>
<p>opin anthony</p>
<p>ron and all that</p>
<p>i was the morning show with this guy</p>
<p>named sid rosenberg sid</p>
<p>sure i know</p>
<p>sid rosenberg</p>
<p>i do a show in</p>
<p>miami all the time sid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sports expert</p>
<p>i knew fucking</p>
<p>nothing it was supposed to be like love lines</p>
<p>where he was the</p>
<p>expert and i was the comedian right</p>
<p>and sid wanted me to be an expert in</p>
<p>sports and i don&rsquo;t give a shit about</p>
<p>what the fucking guy&rsquo;s stats are so did he ask you to</p>
<p>learn the stats</p>
<p>no but there was constant conflict between the</p>
<p>two of us because how long did you work there for six</p>
<p>months and i was like i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>the fuck out of here so he was telling you hey read the</p>
<p>sports book yeah and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be like did you</p>
<p>watch the game last</p>
<p>night like no</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like why not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i didn&rsquo;t fucking want to you know and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>just let me</p>
<p>fucking be funny</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ll be funny</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like but you gotta be</p>
<p>funny about</p>
<p>sports i&rsquo;m like no i don&rsquo;t i just have to be funny</p>
<p>so man that always bugs me when i listen to</p>
<p>sports radio and they&rsquo;re like and how</p>
<p>about mchenry</p>
<p>with the play in the</p>
<p>ninth does he</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get his contract extension</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t bump</p>
<p>but it made me fuckin like</p>
<p>cause i realized the only way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get ratings and be interesting</p>
<p>is i had to</p>
<p>basically take on a character</p>
<p>and i would sit there and criticize</p>
<p>these athletes and</p>
<p>these coaches</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>watch the fucking game people love</p>
<p>to do that by the way i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>watch the game</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be like jim fossil he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>pussy did you</p>
<p>see what he did last</p>
<p>time did you say fucking pussy</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say that but i be like he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>can you put i said</p>
<p>pussy i&rsquo;d go he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pussy he&rsquo;s a pussy</p>
<p>and the next</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>you know all his fans are calling yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna kick your ass man how</p>
<p>could you say that</p>
<p>how could it</p>
<p>and i would just try to incite people</p>
<p>to create radio</p>
<p>right and i</p>
<p>watch fucking bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the same shit there&rsquo;s no possible</p>
<p>way he might be he</p>
<p>we know i definitely</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s playing towards his</p>
<p>market he has a</p>
<p>market and he&rsquo;s concocted this</p>
<p>this gigantic</p>
<p>conglomeration of retards and old people</p>
<p>that think that he makes sense</p>
<p>but this is one of the the most</p>
<p>troll like things he&rsquo;s ever said brian</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about the moon</p>
<p>this is on bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>com you can find it on youtube</p>
<p>backstage conversation backstage with bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>david beverly hills florida</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>when you refer to the tides when you ask</p>
<p>about the existence</p>
<p>of god science explains the tides</p>
<p>the moon&rsquo;s gravity pulls on the</p>
<p>ocean okay how did the moon get there</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d the moon get there</p>
<p>look you pinheads who attacked me for this</p>
<p>you guys are just desperate</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d the moon get there how&rsquo;d the sun get there</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d it get there</p>
<p>can you explain that to me</p>
<p>how come we have that</p>
<p>and mars doesn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>venus doesn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>how come mars has two moons by now</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d it get here</p>
<p>how did that little amoeba get here</p>
<p>call out there</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d it do it come on</p>
<p>you have an order in this universe you have an</p>
<p>order in the universe</p>
<p>tye comes in</p>
<p>tye goes out okay</p>
<p>yeah the moon does it fine how&rsquo;d the moon get there</p>
<p>who put it there</p>
<p>did it just happen</p>
<p>okay if we have</p>
<p>existence if we have life</p>
<p>on earth how come they don&rsquo;t have it on the</p>
<p>other planets</p>
<p>but we just lucky some meteor do this</p>
<p>come on you know i see this stuff it&rsquo;s desperate</p>
<p>science is desperate</p>
<p>it takes more faith to not believe</p>
<p>and to think that this was all luck</p>
<p>every all this human body the intricacies of it and</p>
<p>everything else all luck</p>
<p>than it does</p>
<p>to believe in indeed</p>
<p>two things i want you to do right now two</p>
<p>things i want you to do one i want you to go look up</p>
<p>bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>scandalous voicemails</p>
<p>because he left a bunch of voicemails on his assistants</p>
<p>his assistants</p>
<p>phone about</p>
<p>rubbing her down with aloof of sponge and</p>
<p>fucking all kinds of creepy</p>
<p>shit and he wanted to paying her off</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think that bill o&rsquo;reilly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the kind of guy that really needs to get really high</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>might go holy shit</p>
<p>i take back</p>
<p>i take back almost</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve ever said</p>
<p>yeah for sure he would</p>
<p>because it would</p>
<p>allow him a different perception that he probably has</p>
<p>never entered into if he does believe that shit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know if he does or</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t i think he does</p>
<p>and this is why i</p>
<p>think he does i</p>
<p>think he does because he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>tremendous ego</p>
<p>and i think you know he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s saying something all the time</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>would say something all the time</p>
<p>unless he believed it</p>
<p>you know this this</p>
<p>whole thing i</p>
<p>think you know i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>preaching to the</p>
<p>choir and i</p>
<p>definitely think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to fit a mold</p>
<p>and trying to appease his constituents</p>
<p>all the people that listen to his show</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>contrary to what he really believes</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got too big of an ego</p>
<p>for him to be on tv talking</p>
<p>about it all the time</p>
<p>eventually he&rsquo;d implode he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to deal with that if he really did have</p>
<p>an intelligent</p>
<p>argument that was</p>
<p>contrary to what we were saying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>would be saying it on the air i just</p>
<p>think his ego is too big i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s that genius</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not andy kaufman</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not some</p>
<p>brilliant trickster that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>fooling the</p>
<p>world i think</p>
<p>these guys they</p>
<p>start playing a character and then</p>
<p>they sort of like dice clay it</p>
<p>they become</p>
<p>the character yeah what&rsquo;s number one dice clay</p>
<p>do you know the dice clay used to be andrew silverstein</p>
<p>by the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to get dice in the podcast too</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not hating i love dice</p>
<p>we had a great</p>
<p>talk with dice the</p>
<p>other day dice&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kid is doing comedy dice&rsquo;s kid is 20 wow</p>
<p>and dice is so proud</p>
<p>and his kid is fucking killing his kid&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>learning yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>great what&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>name what&rsquo;s he go</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s his name bro</p>
<p>uh was it max</p>
<p>max yeah i think is it max clay</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>think did you go by silverstein</p>
<p>anyway he oh i&rsquo;ve seen his name around</p>
<p>dice used to be</p>
<p>andrew silverstein and then</p>
<p>the dice man</p>
<p>was like this character that he</p>
<p>would do on stage</p>
<p>along with a</p>
<p>bunch of other characters he</p>
<p>would do like</p>
<p>stallone and he</p>
<p>would do deniro</p>
<p>he would do all</p>
<p>these characters like all these</p>
<p>impressions and the dice man was one of his characters</p>
<p>well the dice man just became</p>
<p>his main character that became his</p>
<p>thing he did on</p>
<p>stage and then it became him off stage</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>think that happens to guys like glenn beck</p>
<p>i think what happens is they</p>
<p>start out with this character</p>
<p>and they start out and then they get all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>thank you mr beck you make me so</p>
<p>happy and what you said</p>
<p>about jesus is so important to me and my family</p>
<p>and what you say</p>
<p>about our troops is so important to me and our family</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>soaking in this love and he&rsquo;s putting out a book</p>
<p>every three days this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and all of them are</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with the left and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with society and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with being godless and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with this and</p>
<p>sarah palin&rsquo;s the only hope for our country</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>start fucking believing it man because</p>
<p>the human ego</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the type of person that&rsquo;s really selling something and</p>
<p>pitching something</p>
<p>and getting all this adulation for it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an egomaniac</p>
<p>which most people</p>
<p>into the public eye are</p>
<p>you know most people that get into a</p>
<p>position where they&rsquo;re like a guy like that</p>
<p>where they have</p>
<p>an opinion show</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage every</p>
<p>day talking to people and broadcasting to millions</p>
<p>they get all this love and fan mail</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to be objective about that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>have a real honest way of looking at the way you</p>
<p>start looking</p>
<p>at it the way they want you to look out because this is</p>
<p>where the love&rsquo;s coming from and then</p>
<p>beck turned into a fucking mormon</p>
<p>okay as an adult</p>
<p>as an adult</p>
<p>who by the way</p>
<p>obviously look you can say he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and i</p>
<p>do but that guy&rsquo;s got a high iq there&rsquo;s no question in</p>
<p>my mind i guarantee you if you sat that guy down he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>120 plus iq</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart guy there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you can do that free ball mormonism</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>look the intelligence</p>
<p>and balance are two totally different</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve met some brilliant people</p>
<p>one of the i don&rsquo;t want to say his name</p>
<p>a guy who used to design my website is</p>
<p>fucking brilliant but</p>
<p>completely insane</p>
<p>and totally imbalanced</p>
<p>i know a bunch of people</p>
<p>like that that are really really brilliant people</p>
<p>but i mean a mathematically brilliant</p>
<p>structurally</p>
<p>brilliant the way they can</p>
<p>break down complex</p>
<p>orders in society</p>
<p>but in their own life is just</p>
<p>chaos so wait so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying beck is brilliant yes i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely brilliant brilliant in being a cunt</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is i think he&rsquo;s a brilliant guy</p>
<p>manipulation</p>
<p>yeah brilliant manipulation brilliant acting</p>
<p>brilliant at playing a part</p>
<p>brilliant at</p>
<p>becoming the perfect</p>
<p>version of this guy that all</p>
<p>these retards need</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it takes intelligence to be a manipulator</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s doing takes intelligence he&rsquo;s free balling</p>
<p>every day he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a big screen and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breaking things down</p>
<p>and some of it makes</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>20 or 30 percent of it i go</p>
<p>god damn it i</p>
<p>agree with glenn beck yeah well this is</p>
<p>ridiculous but i</p>
<p>think that those guys</p>
<p>when they get to that position</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>extraordinary amount of</p>
<p>success that they achieve</p>
<p>in one certain area i mean glenn beck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house is for sale in connecticut</p>
<p>and i looked at that shit online</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking giant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably only for sale</p>
<p>cause he got a bigger one</p>
<p>you know he got a bigger</p>
<p>crazy one that guy&rsquo;s selling literally</p>
<p>every time i go to the bookstore there&rsquo;s a new glenn</p>
<p>beck book nobody makes me feel lazier than glenn beck</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>writing this goddamn book for a year and i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and glenn beck puts out one</p>
<p>every 15 days</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking insane you know but</p>
<p>these guys i really</p>
<p>truly believe as a person who&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>affected by fame</p>
<p>and been affected like</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ve had to look at my own</p>
<p>behavior and</p>
<p>analyze it and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i really got into</p>
<p>psychedelics and the isolation tank is because</p>
<p>i felt like there was an overwhelming</p>
<p>influence that</p>
<p>fame and the pursuit of fame has on a person</p>
<p>especially in hollywood</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>things happen well you can</p>
<p>lose yourself in this</p>
<p>quest and i</p>
<p>think it happens to a lot of people</p>
<p>so i wanted to kind of analyze it</p>
<p>in myself and it took a long time for</p>
<p>me to get a hold of it from fear factor on there was</p>
<p>a long time in there</p>
<p>where i was like this is a</p>
<p>crazy thing here</p>
<p>how do you make sure that</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is really what you want to be doing</p>
<p>how do you know that</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is not what you</p>
<p>think people</p>
<p>would like to hear from you or what you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say and</p>
<p>do to get more work and to get more people to like you</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ve had conversations with really</p>
<p>successful people they say</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t do that because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m this and that and my images that and this and</p>
<p>like okay you&rsquo;re not even doing you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretending</p>
<p>to be something else just so that you can</p>
<p>get more of the positive reaction that you&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>well that permeates</p>
<p>into your real life but what if that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>kind of person i vacillate off and i&rsquo;ll look at one</p>
<p>thing and then i&rsquo;ll have a different opinion</p>
<p>maybe a year</p>
<p>later on how i felt</p>
<p>about it and i question</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>yeah but and as a as a performer as a comedian</p>
<p>my acts constantly</p>
<p>changing sometimes</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do bits that i used to do because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve changed as a person i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel that way and i can&rsquo;t deliver them with truth</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like that</p>

<p>anyways who cares we&rsquo;re talking about you</p>
<p>you know well i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>i accidentally unclicked it and i can&rsquo;t get back to it</p>
<p>so so sorry go ahead</p>
<p>so people like</p>
<p>the ability to like change</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re and</p>
<p>to get locked into that character</p>
<p>would be terrifying for me i&rsquo;m a control freak</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where your income and i don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lucky enough that i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>like a wife and kids but imagine if you got into that</p>
<p>where then you&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>house and mortgages</p>
<p>schools and you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>bought into this character and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>changed as a character and you&rsquo;re like fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not that guy anymore i don&rsquo;t feel that way i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>changed my way of</p>
<p>thinking but fuck i</p>
<p>gotta i gotta</p>
<p>still do that because people do change</p>
<p>people either become more conservative as they get</p>
<p>older or you know</p>
<p>start to realize shit</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve become more</p>
<p>liberal as i get older</p>
<p>yeah yeah well i</p>
<p>think as you become more intelligent</p>
<p>you realize that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>more to things than people like to think</p>
<p>now everybody likes to</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s black and</p>
<p>white i have a lot of conservative ideas a lot of them</p>
<p>about gun control</p>
<p>about taxes</p>
<p>about a lot of different things</p>
<p>but i also have a lot of liberal</p>
<p>points of view too</p>
<p>especially when it comes to</p>
<p>things like gay</p>
<p>marriage and</p>
<p>that to me is one of the most frustrating</p>
<p>things when i see people get upset</p>
<p>about gay marriage</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s somehow</p>
<p>another fucking affects you of two guys who obviously</p>
<p>want to be gay</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s got a gun to their head</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s saying if you&rsquo;re not gay i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>killing your family you know no one&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>they want to be</p>
<p>i find the people that are afraid of like bro this</p>

<p>yeah just fucking shut up</p>
<p>and go fucking have a beer somewhere you</p>
<p>why are you out here with</p>
<p>the fuck you&rsquo;ve got your own religion of atheism like</p>
<p>i get it i get your belief you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>any kind of fucking</p>
<p>order or anything i don&rsquo;t know what i believe</p>
<p>but go away</p>
<p>right fucking stop your religion of trying to yeah</p>
<p>people want to</p>
<p>believe anything</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s they want to believe in republicans they</p>
<p>want to believe in god they want to believe in no god</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had arguments with atheists</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>ridiculous you know like they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>science disproves the</p>
<p>existence of god like</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>science doesn&rsquo;t disprove anything</p>
<p>what science does is it</p>
<p>shows well first of all statistics and</p>
<p>things that can be measured</p>
<p>you know how can you measure what happens in the</p>
<p>afterlife that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>how can you measure what happened</p>
<p>you know what the</p>
<p>birth of the universe is and how do you mean</p>
<p>how do we not</p>
<p>know that there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s far more</p>
<p>comp i mean i&rsquo;m not saying that there&rsquo;s a guy in the</p>
<p>clouds with a harp</p>
<p>but what i am saying is that</p>
<p>after smoking dmt</p>
<p>seven times and doing mushrooms all the times i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and all the times in the isolation tank</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen shit</p>
<p>way crazier than a dude with a harp in the clouds</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve seen it many many many times</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>the idea that you can tell me what does and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist is fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>i cannot believe</p>
<p>people actually try to do that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>how do we know that we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>right now or that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know there could be</p>
<p>something so complex</p>
<p>i always tell</p>
<p>people when they go what&rsquo;s your belief on god i go</p>
<p>when my dog</p>
<p>looks at my computer my macbook</p>
<p>she can&rsquo;t comprehend</p>
<p>the operating system</p>
<p>she has no she does not have the capability</p>
<p>and i believe that as humans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we are with the universe</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the fucking</p>
<p>capability we</p>
<p>might be the most intelligent species</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not intelligent enough</p>
<p>to understand</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being the the baddest worm this worm is so</p>
<p>smart look it</p>
<p>knows how to get around this pebble</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous the</p>
<p>idea that we can figure it out i mean this is</p>
<p>complete and total</p>
<p>stoner talk but</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>we can figure out the fucking universe you know</p>
<p>did you find the bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>this stuff no it&rsquo;s not on there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a video bro</p>

<p>gonna fucking die</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pulling cushioning out of the seats and</p>
<p>throwing it at me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re booing so loud</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>about eddie yeft</p>
<p>this is what he says to me when he tells me the</p>
<p>story at the beginning of the day he goes</p>
<p>now if it happened</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;d totally be able to be fine with it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;d totally be able to make it funny</p>
<p>comedians always</p>
<p>wanna think that</p>
<p>i have some ruthless bombs in my past</p>
<p>and i have gone over</p>
<p>these bombings</p>
<p>and said man if i</p>
<p>could just go back and redo it</p>
<p>this one time i bombed</p>
<p>after jim brewer</p>
<p>it was the worst bomb of my entire career it was</p>
<p>devastation</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before i don&rsquo;t remember i talked</p>
<p>about it on the podcast did i yeah i</p>
<p>think so brewer</p>
<p>we worked together all weekend and i</p>
<p>could barely follow him</p>
<p>you know this is like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d only been doing comedy</p>
<p>maybe three years</p>
<p>maybe three or four years</p>
<p>and he was just too</p>
<p>strong to be a middle</p>
<p>and i really wasn&rsquo;t a headliner i was a fake headliner</p>
<p>i could do 45</p>
<p>minutes but i had to tell my joke slow</p>
<p>you know what i mean i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so like when he was on</p>
<p>stage and brewer</p>
<p>used to do his bit</p>
<p>about going home and</p>
<p>he was hammered and his</p>
<p>mother turned into a</p>
<p>demon and it was</p>
<p>really loud and really animated and he was just</p>
<p>now sometimes a dude just gets in the zone</p>
<p>and brewer used to get in these</p>
<p>crazy zones man i used to really</p>
<p>enjoy watching him perform</p>
<p>because he could just</p>
<p>just his physical</p>
<p>performance his physical</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>presence on stage</p>
<p>fuck he just</p>
<p>would nail it and this is one time man</p>
<p>we had been</p>
<p>doing all weekend so we&rsquo;d done two shows friday</p>
<p>one show saturday this was a late show saturday and</p>
<p>brewer just</p>
<p>knocks it out of the park</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>
<p>going wrong in my life at the time</p>
<p>one i had just torn my acl</p>
<p>so it was for the</p>
<p>first time in my life i couldn&rsquo;t work out i</p>
<p>had never not worked out so i had all this tension</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with</p>
<p>you know like for me</p>
<p>my whole body from the time i was like</p>
<p>14 years old to the time i was</p>
<p>this would happen when i was 22 or 23</p>
<p>my body had been designed just</p>
<p>to constantly be working constantly be exerting</p>
<p>all this energy whether it was in kickboxing or</p>
<p>wrestling or something</p>
<p>there was like</p>
<p>this constant</p>
<p>and that was the only way i coped with stress</p>
<p>that was gone okay</p>
<p>and i had moved from new york to boston so no acl</p>
<p>it blows out and</p>
<p>moved to new york</p>
<p>or from boston new york</p>
<p>i have no friends i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anybody there i&rsquo;m living with my grandfather and my</p>
<p>grandmother my</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>was dying of</p>
<p>an aneurysm she had an aneurysm they gave her 72</p>
<p>hours to live she</p>
<p>lived for 12 years</p>
<p>okay and i&rsquo;m staying in</p>
<p>their old house that they bought</p>
<p>in 1945 in newark new jersey</p>
<p>which is now in a war zone</p>
<p>i mean while</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m there the next door neighbor&rsquo;s door gets broken</p>
<p>down with a battering ram they arrest him for selling</p>
<p>crack i mean</p>
<p>no joke man</p>
<p>it was a scary</p>
<p>scary neighborhood</p>
<p>it used to be an italian neighborhood then it went just</p>
<p>total total chaos</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m staying in the</p>
<p>house and grandma like</p>
<p>she died both of them are dead now</p>
<p>but back then</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t move she was</p>
<p>completely paralyzed</p>
<p>she would get bed sores</p>
<p>and she could feel some things</p>
<p>and sometimes she</p>
<p>would just let out</p>
<p>these souls</p>
<p>almost like</p>
<p>she was emptying herself of the pain and the</p>
<p>only way to do it was to let out this horrible screech</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d be in the house</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be like wandering around</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;d go to the</p>
<p>kitchen and grab something to eat and i&rsquo;d hear</p>
<p>it was like an animal</p>
<p>like a wounded animal she couldn&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>she was so resilient</p>
<p>she had those italian peasant genes</p>
<p>and she was just so fucked up</p>
<p>but yet she hung in there for like 12 years</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m living in this</p>
<p>house right</p>
<p>and i just broken up with my girlfriend</p>
<p>and my manager</p>
<p>god bless i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>great guy but it was back in the day</p>
<p>where we talked about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing so well that everybody has advice for you</p>
<p>and his advice was</p>
<p>you should dress nice</p>
<p>like you know you&rsquo;re a good looking guy i should</p>
<p>dress nice on stage</p>
<p>so my stupid ass</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m wearing</p>
<p>these like nice</p>
<p>pants and a nice belt</p>
<p>and like a club</p>
<p>shirt that you</p>
<p>would go out clubbing and</p>
<p>i had a nice head of hair back then it was delicious</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m wearing</p>
<p>shiny shoes and shit</p>
<p>and i just look like the fucking biggest asshole</p>
<p>i just look like</p>
<p>some club shithead</p>
<p>some goofy italian cunt that&rsquo;s 22 years old that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about the world</p>
<p>right and i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage and i</p>
<p>fucking i am</p>
<p>panicking i remember</p>
<p>brewer got off</p>
<p>stage and the mc</p>
<p>was about to</p>
<p>bring me up and i was off</p>
<p>stage when brewer came up</p>
<p>and i remember he said</p>
<p>he said have fun up there have fun they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>and i go i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking eat it</p>
<p>i remember saying it to him like</p>

<p>and chopping the jokes as i go</p>
<p>along and one girl goes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kinda hot but you&rsquo;re not funny</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing you can say when you know that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true not that i&rsquo;m kind of hot but that i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>funny and another guy goes</p>

<p>to do 45 minutes i went up doing like 30</p>
<p>i got a few</p>
<p>laughs i started getting a few laughs</p>
<p>but they were so shaky it was just</p>
<p>the worst set ever the</p>
<p>worst bombing ever and i</p>
<p>still to this day will go back in my head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>twenty years ago this my gig</p>
<p>still to this day the</p>
<p>worst one i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever had and you go back and you like replay</p>
<p>it over your</p>
<p>head okay i</p>
<p>could have said this</p>
<p>the heat that goes through your body when you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand when you&rsquo;re bombing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a hot like</p>
<p>flash you almost get hot flashes</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m having it when the guy</p>
<p>threw the that</p>
<p>knocked me out of my</p>
<p>aggression when the</p>
<p>chair came up onto the</p>
<p>stage i was like</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight a</p>
<p>crowd and and i</p>
<p>gotta get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>the girl on the side of the</p>
<p>stage that that booked me is</p>
<p>going get off</p>
<p>get off and i</p>

<p>thirty five more minutes and take the</p>
<p>abuse i wanted the</p>

<p>when i get to pick my middle act i love to</p>
<p>bring the best fucking comedian i can</p>
<p>bring dude i go on the road with joey diaz</p>
<p>and does he just not joey</p>
<p>diaz is the funniest guy that&rsquo;s ever walked a face</p>
<p>of the earth</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never laughed more</p>
<p>at anybody ever in my life</p>
<p>23 years of being a comic</p>
<p>have you ever met anybody funnier than joey</p>
<p>no i mean it&rsquo;s like a cartoon</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just explosive</p>
<p>with energy he just makes you</p>
<p>happy and he just</p>
<p>it makes you</p>
<p>funnier too he makes me funnier i&rsquo;m funnier when i work</p>
<p>with joe that&rsquo;s how i feel better yeah that&rsquo;s how the</p>
<p>brian mccarthy is i feel the same way</p>
<p>but what you said</p>
<p>i saw dave chappelle once</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>store and i felt the same way i want to go home and</p>
<p>write i&rsquo;m totally inspired by</p>
<p>great comics too</p>
<p>i saw louis at the</p>
<p>improv in hollywood lu</p>
<p>ck and i wanted to go home and</p>
<p>write was really</p>
<p>great performance and norton recently</p>
<p>i saw norton at</p>
<p>cap city and austin fucking</p>
<p>great and that same feeling i want to go right</p>
<p>but i also get inspired by people who don&rsquo;t like me</p>
<p>yeah yeah even fucking you know haters online</p>
<p>i can get a million people who love me dude it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest fucking show i&rsquo;ve ever seen it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll let one person</p>
<p>was like you know</p>
<p>fucking hang it up</p>
<p>stick to ufc oh what</p>
<p>bitch you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get like</p>
<p>fired up to like i have to zone them work harder</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to zone</p>
<p>them out but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to be humble</p>
<p>i really believe i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>feeling to have someone negatively critique your work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible feeling but i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something to it that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for an artist</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that keeps you</p>
<p>sort of humble and balanced</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>this direct</p>
<p>adulation relationship that you have with an audience</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immediately giving them</p>
<p>what they wanna hear and they immediately</p>
<p>laugh and they tell you how much they love you</p>
<p>you can get imbalanced by that you can get lazy</p>
<p>i mean we both know</p>
<p>comics that got fuckin</p>
<p>super super lazy</p>
<p>and one of the reasons is like</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>for whatever reason</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough balance you know</p>
<p>they got to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>it was too easy for them</p>
<p>too many people being nice to them and they just</p>
<p>they lose it</p>
<p>chris rock once had a really important</p>
<p>thing that i read</p>
<p>where he was talking</p>
<p>about how he bombed really hard once</p>
<p>going on after martin lawrence</p>
<p>martin lawrence</p>
<p>which i did too by the way</p>
<p>a bunch of times at the comedy</p>
<p>store when i was</p>
<p>a fucking when i was on</p>
<p>hardball the show that nobody ever saw on fox</p>
<p>i would go on</p>
<p>after a lot of guys at the comic</p>
<p>store mitsy shore</p>
<p>god bless her did</p>
<p>a tremendous amount for me</p>
<p>early in my career and one of the</p>
<p>things that she</p>
<p>did for me she always put me on the most devastating</p>
<p>comedians in the night</p>
<p>right on after them</p>
<p>like dice clay</p>
<p>i went off to dice clay a hundred times</p>
<p>richard pryor</p>
<p>i went on after richard pryor</p>
<p>when he was in a</p>
<p>wheelchair when he couldn&rsquo;t even talk for five weeks</p>
<p>every time martin lawrence</p>
<p>would have a</p>
<p>set this is back when martin lawrence had the tv show</p>
<p>he was a fucking destroyer</p>
<p>royer i&rsquo;d never seen an aston martin</p>
<p>either martin lawrence is in the back parking lot with</p>
<p>an aston martin i was like what the fuck is this thing</p>
<p>like me and a couple other</p>
<p>comics like circling around i was driving a volkswagen</p>
<p>sharako was like</p>
<p>scratching my chin like what the fuck is this man this</p>
<p>thing&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>and martin would just</p>
<p>devastate the main room i mean devastate</p>
<p>when martin lawrence was in his prime</p>
<p>that guy does not get enough respect</p>
<p>because if you go back and</p>
<p>watch like some of his old</p>
<p>stand up he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>fucking funny</p>
<p>and that show martin</p>
<p>dude that show is</p>
<p>the writing was like non</p>
<p>existent but he</p>
<p>carried the whole show</p>
<p>with all his characters and he pretended to be women</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>funny yeah and i</p>
<p>would be backstage same just like the brewer</p>
<p>night i mean at</p>
<p>least i&rsquo;d been past the brewer</p>
<p>thing like it happened like a couple years before that</p>
<p>so i had like</p>
<p>recovered i knew how to like get out of the gates</p>
<p>strong but 90</p>
<p>black audience you know</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just just</p>
<p>ready to go on</p>
<p>after him and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crushing crushing</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like who&rsquo;s coming up next</p>
<p>he has to bring me up so martin lawrence</p>
<p>brings me up</p>
<p>he calls over to the piano guy</p>
<p>piano guy says joe rogan</p>
<p>he goes alright</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all give it up for this next comedian mr joe rogan</p>
<p>very nice guy says</p>
<p>and i just go up and</p>
<p>eat a bag of shit</p>
<p>of just a big manure</p>
<p>bag that you</p>
<p>would buy like at a fucking farm depot</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>filled with shit i&rsquo;m just chewing up there</p>
<p>and people getting up in</p>
<p>droves and leaving</p>
<p>but all that</p>
<p>stuff makes you way better</p>
<p>it makes you a way better</p>
<p>comic because you realize you don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>wanna make that</p>
<p>feel that feeling it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you feel the</p>
<p>fire behind your feet and it makes you run faster</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>gonna run a certain amount when you&rsquo;re not pushed</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny like said</p>
<p>sometimes i just go i&rsquo;m shit i suck now blah blah blah</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t have the ability to bomb like that anymore</p>
<p>i mean it can happen in a bad situation</p>
<p>now like something really fucked up happening but like</p>
<p>i used to have to new york you know million times</p>
<p>esty used to</p>
<p>do at the seller she just wait and put you up</p>
<p>after the hardest person</p>
<p>to make sure you were</p>
<p>ready for it i had to throw</p>
<p>attell forever</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>in the cellar and that&rsquo;s how i got so dark because</p>
<p>attell would</p>
<p>just his jokes were so amazing</p>
<p>and so dark too that it was like</p>
<p>i had to go to a darker</p>
<p>place than him</p>
<p>right james</p>
<p>had to like</p>
<p>pick up the</p>
<p>frequency where he</p>
<p>leaves it off</p>
<p>and i remember just bombing so bad in the cellar</p>
<p>that i would just start</p>
<p>start just like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fucking freestyling just saying the</p>
<p>worst things i</p>
<p>could say like talking</p>
<p>about killing</p>
<p>babies and shit like trying to</p>
<p>get out of this horrible hole that i would just</p>
<p>shock the fuck out of the audience it</p>
<p>never works</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>that never works</p>
<p>it was almost like if you go into a zone though</p>
<p>of like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna pretend like they&rsquo;re not here and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna just keep saying this shit and hopefully they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come around because this is so painful</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in this terrible terrible bomb</p>
<p>i mean i had</p>
<p>like i watched you on what was it</p>
<p>a amp e evening at the end</p>
<p>caroline&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>hour that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i saw you</p>
<p>first when i</p>
<p>was like a little kid that i didn&rsquo;t even do comedy</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>watching you and you were dirty</p>
<p>i remember you and</p>
<p>sarah were on it and</p>
<p>sarah was dirty</p>
<p>and so as a little kid i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>these are good</p>
<p>comics these two</p>
<p>these are comedians</p>
<p>it was so hard for me back then they even come up with</p>
<p>seven minutes of material that i</p>
<p>could do on tv</p>
<p>i would have to sit down and go over my shit i</p>
<p>was like god i can&rsquo;t do that bit i can&rsquo;t do this but i</p>
<p>might had an hour material</p>
<p>i might have five i</p>
<p>could do it but i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>imagine you bombing because of the way your act was</p>
<p>like you had the</p>
<p>confidence and the dirtiness</p>
<p>and everything so i was like</p>
<p>this guy can&rsquo;t bomb it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>so you probably had a lot less bombs than i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>wow well yeah</p>
<p>well you know i&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch man i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that i don&rsquo;t know how many you&rsquo;ve had but</p>
<p>especially at the</p>
<p>store i had a gang of them in the</p>
<p>early days when i was</p>
<p>going on after</p>
<p>you know like really good</p>
<p>comics over and over and over</p>
<p>again i had a</p>
<p>quite a few bombings yeah</p>
<p>but the early days were way</p>
<p>worse the open mic days were</p>
<p>fucking brutal</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really not supposed to be up there talking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really not good enough and then look brian</p>
<p>has been doing</p>
<p>stand up he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>doing open mic</p>
<p>nights just for a</p>
<p>short period of time</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>kind of zone area</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning it and</p>
<p>figuring it out you&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>stage of your life</p>
<p>where sometimes</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve seen you go on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re trying out a new joke and it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fucked you know you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>stuck in this rut</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>right now right</p>
<p>well i had a horrible</p>
<p>thing the other day where</p>
<p>somebody i knew</p>
<p>was sitting in the front row</p>
<p>and they thought</p>
<p>oh this is awesome</p>
<p>you know i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say talk to</p>
<p>brian while he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>stage and so the</p>
<p>whole time she&rsquo;s just like making me going meow</p>
<p>meow like that or</p>
<p>like i said something like oh i just</p>
<p>broke up with my ex</p>
<p>i hate that</p>
<p>bitch and she&rsquo;s like oh whatever you&rsquo;re not over her</p>
<p>and i said it loud enough</p>
<p>where it kept on</p>
<p>like fucking me up and then it just</p>
<p>throws you off and i felt it</p>
<p>i felt way off my</p>
<p>tracks you know but</p>
<p>i never feel i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really felt like</p>
<p>bomb where you</p>
<p>gave me anxiety</p>
<p>except for that</p>
<p>because i had to go on</p>
<p>afterwards and i was like this</p>
<p>bitch gonna talk to me</p>
<p>right fuck she</p>
<p>gonna talk to me too like she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah but i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want i&rsquo;d rather not you know people always</p>
<p>say oh you know you&rsquo;re so good</p>
<p>with hecklers you must love it when people talk shit no</p>
<p>i want everybody to have fun</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to have to ruin someone&rsquo;s mind the bob hope joke</p>
<p>that one that talked a few times on the podcast before</p>
<p>when i did that</p>
<p>and i was booed and</p>
<p>hissed i took off comedy for five years</p>

<p>gonna fly out his body to</p>
<p>entertain all the dead troops</p>

<p>it was the day he died though</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>right during like you know</p>

<p>funny like all of them hate it when i come in</p>
<p>their face now i</p>
<p>break it down to eat you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cutie</p>
<p>and chris wayne</p>
<p>house from australia i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a kiwi but he lives</p>
<p>in australia and he&rsquo;s really dark and really funny</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>job what&rsquo;s a kiwi</p>
<p>new zealander</p>
<p>oh and his name is chris</p>
<p>wayne and he</p>
<p>writes jokes he</p>
<p>writes a ton</p>
<p>here on twitter</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know his name on twitter but he</p>
<p>writes tons of jokes all the time</p>
<p>he did a joke</p>
<p>about the crocodile</p>
<p>hunter the day the crocodile hunter died</p>
<p>and somebody in the audience yells out too soon</p>
<p>and he goes too soon</p>
<p>i would have done that joke on the fucking boat</p>
<p>i said something</p>
<p>about the crocodile</p>
<p>hunter when he died and i actually felt bad about it</p>
<p>and the reason why i felt bad</p>
<p>about it was some you know</p>
<p>what i said was</p>
<p>i go he dies</p>
<p>i go my act gains 10 minutes i don&rsquo;t see the loss</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>wrote on a message board</p>
<p>and i just you know</p>
<p>flipping like you know comics</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say shit like that</p>
<p>just to fuck with each</p>
<p>other like you ever done the opening anthony show</p>
<p>no never done it</p>
<p>great fucking show and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everyone tries to say that like louis</p>
<p>ck will say the meanest</p>
<p>shit to norton who&rsquo;ll say the meanest shit the ob</p>
<p>they say the meanest</p>
<p>shit back to but it&rsquo;s not real it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get laughs</p>
<p>and someone said you</p>
<p>know hey man this guy has like a family and children</p>
<p>what if his children read that and i went oh shit</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m like okay i don&rsquo;t even really</p>
<p>think that i don&rsquo;t even really believe</p>
<p>that right and i was really mad at myself because i</p>
<p>would have totally written a crocodile hunter bit</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that i felt bad</p>
<p>that i said that</p>
<p>which was a very</p>
<p>short sighted and it wasn&rsquo;t really even</p>
<p>funny it was just like</p>
<p>a quick easy</p>
<p>cheap like jibe</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about it and i said god damn</p>
<p>it i fucked myself out of a good crocodile hutter bit</p>
<p>right because for sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right up my alley</p>
<p>you know like i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s more fascinated by predatory animals than me</p>
<p>and when a dude</p>
<p>who fucks with animals his entire career</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>snake i call him in his head</p>
<p>when a guy like that</p>
<p>fucking gets killed by an animal i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking wealth of material there i said in</p>
<p>australia in australia i said before he died</p>
<p>i watch the show i go i</p>
<p>they all think america loves the crocodile</p>
<p>hunter they</p>
<p>think we all most of us do</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not as into him as we are really</p>
<p>no not at all</p>
<p>they all kind of</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freak and they&rsquo;re not that</p>
<p>do australians have a</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>australians who become</p>
<p>famous somewhere else and it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>poppy syndrome they</p>
<p>they try to cut down the tall flower</p>
<p>yeah because jeffries was</p>
<p>pissed because he</p>
<p>would go back to australia and people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t buy tickets to his show</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ve got a fucking hbo special yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>worst jeffrey&rsquo;s accent ever</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have a lot to complain</p>
<p>about right now</p>
<p>things are going</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s doing great but</p>
<p>my joke was i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching the show</p>
<p>i go i admit i</p>
<p>watch the show and i watch it</p>
<p>every day hoping</p>
<p>every day will be that day</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>you know you put your head in fucking crocodiles</p>
<p>mouth and mouth</p>
<p>and then when he died</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>funny joke everyone used to</p>
<p>laugh at it then when he died my</p>
<p>my agent over</p>
<p>in australia called me goes mate you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>i go what he goes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re playing your clip on the radio</p>
<p>and i was like</p>

<p>these two like dish jaw djs were</p>
<p>playing at this one station they thought it was kind of</p>
<p>funny just playing my bit over and over</p>
<p>right so i got</p>
<p>i thought oh this is fucking i&rsquo;m dead</p>
<p>in america you know i</p>
<p>would have been had gone into hiding yeah but ozzies</p>

<p>legend mate you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>legend you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>legend mate</p>
<p>alright speaking of</p>
<p>legend before we get out of here i</p>
<p>found the bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>thing and i got to read it because it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous when everything</p>
<p>about bill o&rsquo;reilly no matter what</p>
<p>if you think</p>
<p>about his opinions</p>
<p>this is what you need to know</p>
<p>and this is some fucking voicemail that he left</p>
<p>from some woman</p>
<p>her name was andrea</p>
<p>mccarris and she sued him for</p>
<p>sexual harassment</p>
<p>and this is what</p>
<p>he goes you</p>
<p>would basically be in the shower</p>
<p>and then i would come in</p>
<p>and you would have your back to me</p>
<p>and i would take the loofah</p>
<p>thing and kind of soap up your back</p>
<p>rub it all over you</p>
<p>get you to relax</p>
<p>hot water and um you know</p>
<p>feel the tension</p>
<p>drain out of you and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d still be with your back to me</p>
<p>and then i would</p>
<p>kinda put my arm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those mitts one of those lufa</p>
<p>mitts you know</p>
<p>so i got my hand in it</p>
<p>and i would put it around in front</p>
<p>kinda rub your</p>
<p>tummy a little bit within</p>
<p>and then my</p>
<p>other hand would</p>
<p>start to massage your boobs</p>
<p>get your nipples really hard</p>
<p>cause i like that and you have really</p>
<p>spectacular</p>
<p>boobs so anyway</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be rubbing your big</p>
<p>boobs and getting your nipples really hard</p>
<p>kinda kissing your neck from behind</p>
<p>and then is it</p>
<p>wrong that i have the</p>
<p>other right now yes it is</p>
<p>and then i would take the</p>
<p>other hand with</p>
<p>the falafel</p>
<p>thing the falafel</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>and just put it on your pussy</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d have to do it real</p>
<p>light just kind of</p>

<p>thing that&rsquo;s not what you want</p>
<p>shove some chickpeas up here cause</p>
<p>they just use the</p>
<p>wrong word maybe i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>understand that this is the kind of</p>
<p>human being you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with and all this shit that you see in the fucking</p>
<p>in the public eyes just nonsense</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just what we said before that</p>
<p>people when they become</p>
<p>famous and they get adulation they</p>
<p>start all of a</p>
<p>sudden believing the bullshit they believe</p>
<p>their own hype</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s step one</p>
<p>to losing it all</p>
<p>like r kelly and it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>zeus on you got that</p>
<p>bitch yeah you</p>
<p>wanna play at the end though yeah let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cut it out at the very end yeah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s queue</p>
<p>it up and we&rsquo;ll play it at the very end do you know the</p>
<p>angelica houston i</p>
<p>think it was her that said it she goes</p>
<p>i go by the motto</p>
<p>never pick it up</p>
<p>never put it down</p>
<p>like if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take the adulations you can&rsquo;t take the criticism</p>
<p>like focus on yourself don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focus on like what</p>
<p>other people say</p>
<p>and i try to do that like cause</p>
<p>if i can learn</p>
<p>from people you</p>
<p>know but when you walk out of a show and people you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great what you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just your opinion</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re gonna hear</p>
<p>you suck too right</p>
<p>and so that way i don&rsquo;t take that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great i just go</p>
<p>thanks but i don&rsquo;t let it soak in</p>
<p>cause otherwise</p>
<p>you know what i like hearing i like hearing we had a</p>
<p>great time that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>like hearing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna hear your</p>
<p>great i mean if you</p>
<p>think that thank you very much</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying i&rsquo;m working hard</p>
<p>keep going i do it all for</p>
<p>whoever likes</p>
<p>to see the comedy that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m doing it for i mean</p>
<p>i think you alter your</p>
<p>motivation as you get</p>
<p>older and as you get more</p>
<p>successful and as you</p>
<p>kind of get a better</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing like as an artist and i think</p>
<p>initially i just wanted to get</p>
<p>laughs i just wanted to</p>
<p>for me i wanted to</p>
<p>prove that i</p>
<p>could be good at this</p>
<p>i wanted to get some success</p>
<p>i wanted to do it for me</p>
<p>but then once you get the</p>
<p>success then</p>
<p>you have to change</p>
<p>your rational or</p>
<p>your motivation has to change</p>
<p>and it has to become</p>
<p>in order to stay good and to stay relevant</p>
<p>it has to become</p>
<p>about the art</p>
<p>you have to be obsessed with creating good</p>
<p>stuff you have to be obsessed with</p>
<p>doing something that people are</p>
<p>gonna enjoy</p>
<p>those pops of brilliance when a new bit comes to life</p>
<p>did you go through</p>
<p>a change though because i remember like when i</p>
<p>watched you when i was</p>
<p>younger and i was like oh i liked you because at that</p>
<p>point in my life</p>
<p>i was into like</p>
<p>i want to hear like</p>
<p>tits and ass and</p>
<p>fucking pussy and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to me you were that kind of</p>
<p>comic yeah and</p>
<p>evening the improv</p>
<p>was guys with their</p>
<p>sleeves rolled up going</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the deal with</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>going you know fuck that pussy</p>
<p>yeah and i was a</p>
<p>savage and then you</p>
<p>think about how i got into</p>
<p>stand up comedy i was a fucking kickboxer but</p>
<p>then you change it totally</p>
<p>now you do this</p>
<p>kind of intellectual type material that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like what you talk about now</p>
<p>well when i was 21 i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still have a million dick jokes but when i was 21</p>
<p>i had nothing to say</p>
<p>about anything else</p>
<p>i had no opinions</p>
<p>i had no opinions on society</p>
<p>i had no opinions on life i didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about religion at all</p>
<p>except it scared me</p>
<p>because i went to catholic</p>
<p>school when i was little all i thought</p>
<p>about when i was 21 was pussy</p>
<p>that is all i was a fucking savage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i thought</p>
<p>about here i was</p>
<p>a former martial arts</p>
<p>teacher and</p>
<p>fighter who is now</p>
<p>a professional</p>
<p>comic and i was making my living</p>
<p>working in bars and doing</p>
<p>stand up and trying</p>
<p>to make girls like me i mean that&rsquo;s what i was doing</p>
<p>and all i was obsessed with</p>
<p>and all i was obsessed with was fucking</p>
<p>and people would say that to me like your act is all</p>
<p>about sex and why is your act all about sex</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>22 and my hormones are</p>
<p>blasting inside of my body like a broken fire hydrant</p>
<p>slamming against the walls of my heart</p>
<p>like what are you talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about i don&rsquo;t know anything else</p>
<p>i had no opinions</p>
<p>i could say sex jokes on</p>
<p>stage and people</p>
<p>could laugh you know why</p>
<p>because these are</p>
<p>things that i was actually thinking</p>
<p>about so i had actual</p>
<p>humorous points of view on it and people</p>
<p>would say well your act is so dirty</p>
<p>am i supposed to not talk</p>
<p>about what i&rsquo;m obsessed with</p>
<p>should i talk</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re obsessed with i guess i</p>
<p>should have balance i mean i did go through a long time</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>especially if i do like</p>
<p>a half an hour set it was too much sex talk it was like</p>
<p>i was like enough</p>
<p>already dude you must have something else</p>
<p>you know how many cumshot jokes can you have</p>
<p>you know but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as i got older then i</p>
<p>started you know</p>
<p>looking at the</p>
<p>world and you know</p>
<p>then you know actually</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>things and then</p>
<p>actually forming opinions and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>deeply considering</p>
<p>those opinions before i ever thought</p>
<p>about taking them to the stage</p>
<p>i mean i had opinions</p>
<p>about things for years and years before i ever</p>
<p>tried to like</p>
<p>put them in a</p>
<p>humorous situation</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a matter of</p>
<p>developing as a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>but as your</p>
<p>motivation changes</p>
<p>and as your perception changes i mean just you just</p>
<p>mature you grow you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>things differently</p>
<p>no but is your audience</p>
<p>your ufc audience the guys that are like</p>
<p>mma guys and like that kind of</p>
<p>stuff are they</p>
<p>on the same mindset as</p>
<p>you now with your kind of material dude you&rsquo;d be amazed</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>about ufc fans</p>
<p>first of all the</p>
<p>broad spectrum of</p>
<p>ufc fans there&rsquo;s some fucking brilliant intelligent</p>
<p>ufc fans i&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>some people in the</p>
<p>mixed martial arts business whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trainers or competitors or</p>
<p>you know people who just do</p>
<p>just do it as a hobby</p>
<p>or involved in a</p>
<p>management aspect</p>
<p>fucking brilliant people</p>
<p>who are huge fans of the</p>
<p>sport i met a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>like the guys who own the</p>
<p>ufc they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>smart people man yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not caveman</p>
<p>i mean dana white&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and he</p>
<p>swears a lot</p>
<p>stuff but he&rsquo;s a fucking really</p>
<p>introspective like</p>
<p>a very considerate and</p>
<p>compassionate person like</p>
<p>these guy like</p>
<p>dana white recently</p>
<p>saved some thailand girl</p>
<p>there was a girl who needed to like i believe it was</p>
<p>liver surgery</p>
<p>and she was the</p>
<p>daughter of a trainer at</p>
<p>tiger muay thai</p>
<p>somebody put a threat</p>
<p>about it on the</p>
<p>underground that this girl&rsquo;s gonna die</p>
<p>unless she gets this</p>
<p>this surgery within like the next</p>
<p>eight weeks</p>
<p>dana white fucking paid for all of it</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those guys he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not an asshole he&rsquo;s not a meathead you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really good dude and</p>
<p>these people that you know everybody looks at like cage</p>
<p>fighting fans</p>
<p>and they think of oh they must be assholes with</p>
<p>skulls on their</p>
<p>shirts yeah</p>
<p>a lot of them are</p>
<p>but a lot of them aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and even the assholes with</p>
<p>skulls in their shows</p>
<p>they can be lead</p>
<p>they can all be</p>
<p>everybody can look at</p>
<p>things in a</p>
<p>more fun friendly way well i&rsquo;d imagine that cage</p>
<p>fighters to themselves are kind of</p>
<p>perfectionist kind of guys</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>thing i texted you one day and</p>
<p>asked you about</p>
<p>the quote about if you can do one</p>
<p>thing well you can do</p>
<p>miyamoto masashi</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i got this</p>
<p>tattoo see that shit</p>
<p>because i find sashi versus a</p>
<p>tiger like those</p>
<p>i do that crossfit</p>
<p>stuff and all the guys i do</p>
<p>crossfit with</p>
<p>are obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>and very intellectual you find</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>great athletes and you</p>
<p>would think they&rsquo;re just dumb fucking</p>
<p>you know can</p>
<p>climb a rope and fucking</p>
<p>power lift you know deadlift</p>
<p>500 pounds but</p>
<p>you start finding out they know</p>
<p>everything about</p>
<p>nutrition and then</p>
<p>everything about this</p>
<p>and then it goes discipline</p>
<p>but some people are not disciplined</p>
<p>right dumb people can</p>
<p>work hard if they&rsquo;re like in a football camp and the</p>
<p>coach is screaming at you</p>
<p>every day or</p>
<p>if you have to</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re in the army or something like that but</p>
<p>when you have to</p>
<p>motivate yourself to go to the gym and you have to</p>
<p>motivate yourself to buy the proper</p>
<p>nutrition and</p>
<p>that takes intelligence</p>
<p>it takes a certain amount of discipline</p>
<p>yeah so i&rsquo;ve seen that</p>
<p>these mixed martial arts</p>
<p>cause i would say that them</p>
<p>the guys that do</p>
<p>fight and are really into it</p>
<p>are probably</p>
<p>good fans that really get all your material</p>
<p>and get into like the intellectual shit but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>the average guy that like</p>
<p>shit at home</p>
<p>and goes hey</p>
<p>i just want to see some fucking blood</p>
<p>yeah like yeah does</p>
<p>he come to your show and be like tell me a dick joke</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s that but you know what man i make sure</p>
<p>i try very hard to make sure that my jokes are</p>
<p>first and foremost funny</p>
<p>you know whatever my</p>
<p>point of view is on something it has to be</p>
<p>it has to be digestible</p>
<p>to a lot of people</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>weird shit that i</p>
<p>might think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that if i had an audience filled with you</p>
<p>know only like</p>
<p>guys like you</p>
<p>or duncan or you know someone who&rsquo;s like a very</p>
<p>smart person that&rsquo;s you know of a certain</p>
<p>age i could talk to</p>
<p>about almost anything</p>
<p>i would do different</p>
<p>material yeah it was just you guys you know but to</p>
<p>an audience full of a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>first of all i want everybody to have fun</p>
<p>you know i want like a joyous</p>
<p>fun festive</p>
<p>atmosphere i</p>
<p>want it to be like an hour long party</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that party filled with ideas and thoughts and</p>
<p>then you know that i&rsquo;m not coming from these</p>
<p>coming from a</p>
<p>place of ego i&rsquo;m not an egomania</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m coming from a</p>
<p>place to just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just figure this out</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try to put this all together it&rsquo;s not me it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about me it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>these ideas it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about having a good goddamn time up there so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ideas but i&rsquo;ve got a lot of</p>
<p>weird shit in my act</p>
<p>about time travel and the</p>
<p>large hadron collider and there&rsquo;s some shit that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some place</p>
<p>sometimes when i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage where i go god damn i&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>these motherfuckers down a fucking</p>
<p>twisty road here i hope they&rsquo;re with me</p>
<p>you know i hope they&rsquo;re with me when the</p>
<p>punchlines come</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>might have been like you know</p>
<p>after five minutes of</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>rant when i</p>
<p>get to the end like what the fuck is he talking about</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>are taking notes i better go home and read</p>
<p>about this yeah</p>
<p>i think you know i</p>
<p>initially i</p>
<p>sort of you know did comedy just to try to get</p>
<p>laughs and this</p>
<p>is what i always said that there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>stages of comedy</p>
<p>i think the first</p>
<p>stage is you do anything you can to get a laugh</p>
<p>you know i mean i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve said that some</p>
<p>hacky lines in your life that you&rsquo;re embarrassed about</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;d look back</p>
<p>the last time i</p>
<p>think in 1997 or 90</p>
<p>no earlier than that i was on news</p>
<p>radio though it was like 95 96</p>
<p>i told some</p>
<p>woman hey i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come to your job and slap the dicks out of your mouth</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe i</p>
<p>still used that</p>
<p>like in 90 i used it one time</p>
<p>it was in montreal at the comedy works some</p>
<p>chick said something</p>
<p>right after i said i&rsquo;m like man really</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>dig into your bag</p>
<p>you just grabbed</p>
<p>the most obvious</p>
<p>stupid hacking line i</p>
<p>still think</p>
<p>about that to this day</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>initially you&rsquo;re just trying to get</p>
<p>laughs and then</p>
<p>once you get good</p>
<p>then it goes from</p>
<p>what makes me laugh</p>
<p>you know instead of just trying to make anybody</p>
<p>laugh with like</p>
<p>a tool like i have a hammer look at my hammer i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna hit the nail dong</p>
<p>then it becomes</p>
<p>your perspective it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>this actually is</p>
<p>funny to me</p>
<p>and then it becomes</p>
<p>how do you make someone</p>
<p>laugh with your opinions on</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>what are your unique</p>
<p>points of view</p>
<p>that you can somehow another turn into comedy</p>
<p>so to me there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>been three stages in my life the first</p>
<p>stage was just say anything</p>
<p>even you didn&rsquo;t believe in it i said a lot of</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>about gay people</p>
<p>about whatever the fuck i</p>
<p>was if i thought it would work</p>
<p>you know to me it was like is this a</p>
<p>brick can i kill a rat with it</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s kill the rat you know</p>
<p>it was just a</p>
<p>tool i think i followed your</p>
<p>model and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>years behind you doing the same</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>the analogy</p>
<p>a good analogy i</p>
<p>heard was golf</p>
<p>say when you</p>
<p>learn to golf</p>
<p>just fucking</p>
<p>hit the ball as far as you can fucking hit it</p>
<p>and then hone</p>
<p>your swing and</p>
<p>bring it in instead of</p>
<p>trying to hit it</p>
<p>right and then trying to hit it far</p>
<p>so like try to kill it</p>
<p>first yeah just try to</p>
<p>learn how to kill</p>
<p>and once you kill you&rsquo;ll get all that</p>
<p>confidence and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be scared and then</p>
<p>own in the good</p>
<p>really creative interesting jokes with your</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t go out there</p>
<p>initially with that</p>
<p>some guys probably</p>
<p>have they try but they seem so pretentious</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re 20 and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking down the government</p>
<p>please shut the fuck up</p>
<p>please go get hit in the head by a ball</p>
<p>you know please get</p>
<p>punched you know</p>
<p>go do something</p>
<p>where you develop some character</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about this off air</p>
<p>maybe someone who does that</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of people who do it</p>
<p>well you know you want</p>
<p>to be somebody man you want to be bill hicks you know</p>
