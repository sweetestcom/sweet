<p>you really want to do you just a lot of</p>
<p>people want to just move to someplace</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s out of the you know out of</p>
<p>the society and like you just basically</p>
<p>did it with your family and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re living off the land it seems like</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s pretty pretty admire well</p>
<p>thanks man I really appreciate it you</p>
<p>know I mean we don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily when I hear we look living</p>
<p>off the land I I would of course I&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>to kind of an extreme of like what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually like to live completely off of</p>
<p>you know your own land it&rsquo;s something I</p>
<p>think is a beautiful idea but in the</p>
<p>modern world it&rsquo;s kind of almost</p>
<p>impossible to do you know I mean without</p>
<p>proper training we haven&rsquo;t been trained</p>
<p>generationally to even know shoot how to</p>
<p>feed ourselves by going to the grocery</p>
<p>store right we don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>what to buy in the grocery store</p>
<p>nonetheless how to completely harvest</p>
<p>our own land so I think it&rsquo;d be so cool</p>
<p>to live off of our own land I think one</p>
<p>day well I just saw I just I was looking</p>
<p>at some of your videos and it looked</p>
<p>like you have some land looks like you</p>
<p>have some cows looks like you so I just</p>
<p>assume that you eat those cows yes well</p>
<p>did you have cows we haven&rsquo;t eaten any</p>
<p>of our own cows at this point</p>
<p>okay plan on eating most of these cows</p>
<p>some of these cows we&rsquo;re ready to be</p>
<p>almost now so yeah so we do we got a</p>
<p>bunch of chickens and we&rsquo;ve got a dog</p>
<p>that eats more of our chickens than we</p>
<p>do because we get a lot of eggs but I</p>
<p>actually find when you eat a lot of meat</p>
<p>when you eat you know you&rsquo;re doing like</p>
<p>a ketogenic diet or something you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have like fatty cuts of meat and</p>
<p>so if you get t-bones regularly which</p>
<p>our daughter loves t-bone steaks so get</p>
<p>those t-bones and we feed them to the</p>
<p>chickens we find that their egg</p>
<p>production has almost doubled so I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve probably got like a 3540 percent</p>
<p>increase in egg production just from</p>
<p>giving them more bones and leftover</p>
<p>scraps I really like to eat marrow as</p>
<p>well so oh I love marrow</p>
<p>I love Meryl it&rsquo;s just hard to get</p>
<p>enough of it you know you like get this</p>
<p>and you get this little scoop of marrow</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really add up yeah okay what</p>
<p>are you gotta get the whole boho what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it so nice you get the whole bone you</p>
<p>know when you live somewhere where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re close to a food source or if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got you know everybody no matter</p>
<p>where you live even if you live in a</p>
<p>city there&rsquo;s going to be I mean even if</p>
<p>you check your local Craigslist you</p>
<p>might be able to find providers who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got you know the organic farms nearby</p>
<p>about grass-fed animals and you can get</p>
<p>a whole femur bone and if you get that</p>
<p>whole femur bone you don&rsquo;t have to get</p>
<p>it cut up if you got like a saw at your</p>
<p>house got a bandsaw you can think you</p>
<p>cut that femur bone however you want I</p>
<p>like to use an axe myself in the</p>
<p>backyard I just like to chop it down</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up now do these chickens they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t eat bone right I mean like how do</p>
<p>they could they break the bone up or do</p>
<p>you have to crush them you know what</p>
<p>they just pick it they pick all the</p>
<p>little bits out of it that you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>all the collagen</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the entire collagen network it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all tied into the bone I mean we think</p>
<p>of our of our body almost I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny I mean you as a chiropractor</p>
<p>you probably see this a lot when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with other chiropractors I know</p>
<p>you actually trained other doctors but I</p>
<p>mean we tend to look at the body as like</p>
<p>well you have the bone and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>separate from the muscle and then you</p>
<p>have the blood vessels but when you</p>
<p>actually look at the the matrix of your</p>
<p>body these you&rsquo;re looking at systems</p>
<p>within systems within systems of</p>
<p>magnetic fluids electrified moving</p>
<p>through your blood which is you know</p>
<p>this paramagnetic substance filled with</p>
<p>iron and it&rsquo;s constantly interacting</p>
<p>with the mitochondria in your body and</p>
<p>pumping through this giant magnet of</p>
<p>your heart and this all this whole</p>
<p>matrix of fluids and metals and salts</p>
<p>and I mean there&rsquo;s just so much going on</p>
<p>electricity it&rsquo;s not just like you know</p>
<p>the bone and then the collagen and you</p>
<p>just peel the collagen off it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>stuff is all intertwined and when you</p>
<p>actually look at a bone after you cook</p>
<p>it you know you make a steak and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got that little marrow a bone in the</p>
<p>middle you see it opens up all these</p>
<p>holes and these juices seep out of it so</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so much going on</p>
<p>there when you look at like protein I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really big on you know protein coming</p>
<p>from something that has eyes or a shell</p>
<p>and you know not necessarily a powder</p>
<p>not you know whey protein powder while</p>
<p>that might have some benefits for some</p>
<p>people in certain contexts</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not food I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that is food now for properties that you</p>
<p>get from the whole food that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get from these other totally I mean for</p>
<p>dinner I had the you I order us wellness</p>
<p>meats they ship and it&rsquo;s like total</p>
<p>grass-fed and and the soil is amazing</p>
<p>and the farmers are incredible so I have</p>
<p>the steak it&rsquo;s a fifty-five percent fat</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the most fat so I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>could I cooked the steak and man I just</p>
<p>feel so good when I consume that I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>show you I actually have another thing</p>
<p>that I I don&rsquo;t I order also liverwurst</p>
<p>but this is kind of I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever seen this before I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have can you pronounce it I would say oh</p>
<p>my god yes this has I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grass-fed liver beef onion white pepper</p>
<p>and salt the perfect food right there</p>
<p>look at what you would make I mean when</p>
<p>I do you know I mean we don&rsquo;t eat all I</p>
<p>wish everything we ate was our own we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>our own animals that would be so nice</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cool you live in a place or</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve worked with companies like</p>
<p>us wellness meats or you know you</p>
<p>butcher box or something like that when</p>
<p>you know like this is coming from a</p>
<p>really good source you know that the</p>
<p>whole animal is healthy and very edible</p>
<p>you know making sausage or something</p>
<p>like that I mean you you you&rsquo;ve got so</p>
<p>much of the animal that is very</p>
<p>affordable well not a lot of people</p>
<p>really eat nowadays and it kind of gets</p>
<p>overlooked and it can be way cheaper</p>
<p>than normal cuts oh I bet that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty affordable that was it Browns</p>
<p>Friday yeah it&rsquo;s pretty full cuz you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really I don&rsquo;t need a lie mean I</p>
<p>eat like a chunk of it each day and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just like a superfood because</p>
<p>you have you actually have more</p>
<p>nutrients than anything on the planet in</p>
<p>the organ meats you know so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the things I want to talk to you</p>
<p>about you you I think you said you do a</p>
<p>carnivore diet right I do a primarily</p>
<p>carnivorous diet now I think that term</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a C word right now I mean I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what the carnivore diet</p>
<p>is right a lot of people say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this diet that dad&rsquo;s a keto diet whereas</p>
<p>you know you I know there&rsquo;s a million</p>
<p>different ways we can spew a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet right I do keep in a diet that</p>
<p>basically comes all from the animal</p>
<p>kingdom right now and that&rsquo;s not because</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>believe plants are bad so now because I</p>
<p>think that we should all eat this way I</p>
<p>just find myself gravitating towards</p>
<p>these foods and I like to experiment all</p>
<p>the time and I&rsquo;m kind of going through a</p>
<p>phase where I&rsquo;m craving just foods like</p>
<p>marrow heart liver fatty cuts of meat</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s basically what I build my</p>
<p>diet around right now and I think other</p>
<p>things that I would be consuming would I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s all peripheral you know I like</p>
<p>chocolate I think 100 percent chocolates</p>
<p>great food some people are sensitive to</p>
<p>oxalates they&rsquo;re highly sensitive dog</p>
<p>slices they don&rsquo;t do well with chocolate</p>
<p>I can eat it but I don&rsquo;t know I just I</p>
<p>do find that I function really well on a</p>
<p>diet that&rsquo;s very very low in fiber which</p>
<p>I would have never thought that I would</p>
<p>say right I used to be so big on fiber</p>
<p>but I do find myself gravitating towards</p>
<p>lower fiber diet high in animal fats</p>
<p>whole unrefined animal fats it&rsquo;s fast</p>
<p>timing I know people they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>asking me well what do you think about</p>
<p>this I said well I think if it works for</p>
<p>you great do it I mean I think that when</p>
<p>I when I was a vegan woman in my 20s I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>50 now 53 and I actually had the worst</p>
<p>digestion on the planet I mean I was</p>
<p>like gaseous and bloating and then one</p>
<p>day I had this burger and I was like my</p>
<p>whole stomach just stopped bloating I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like wow wow I mean I was like I thought</p>
<p>it was the fiber we needed the fiber but</p>
<p>actually you need I mean I think you</p>
<p>need some fiber but you and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a way the microbes live</p>
<p>without the fiber but the point is that</p>
<p>when I went with more fatty meats my</p>
<p>digestive system did very well so I</p>
<p>think a lot of people have a problem</p>
<p>with you know beans and lentils and all</p>
<p>these other things that our bodies just</p>
<p>just produce so much gas and then they</p>
<p>think they have to dump all this</p>
<p>tremendous amounts of fiber as fiber is</p>
<p>the secret nutrient I mean I think it</p>
<p>can tear you up so I started at</p>
<p>consuming fatty hamburger for breakfast</p>
<p>I remember and I was like what laughs my</p>
<p>digestion second it feels great</p>
<p>I was just blown away so then it was</p>
<p>like oh my gosh I&rsquo;m gonna just go for</p>
<p>this so I started doing fish in Mead for</p>
<p>breakfast and I start stopped eating all</p>
<p>these the so called brain</p>
<p>and fiber which is you know insoluble</p>
<p>just terrible</p>
<p>you know I guess the the saying goes</p>
<p>that your gut bacteria needs a lot of</p>
<p>fiber which we do know there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>got bacteria the feed off of fiber</p>
<p>certain types of got bacteria can feed</p>
<p>off of certain fibers there&rsquo;s also i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you know fungus and yeasts that grow in</p>
<p>our gut and they&rsquo;re not all bad they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not all good it&rsquo;s about context and the</p>
<p>gut microbiomes fascinating now the</p>
<p>assumption would have been myself</p>
<p>included i would have assumed this you</p>
<p>know three four years ago</p>
<p>well you remove all that fiber you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get digestive issues you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have constipation you&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>getting the you know the nutrition from</p>
<p>your food because you won&rsquo;t be digesting</p>
<p>it because you&rsquo;re losing gut bacteria</p>
<p>now i think that was definitely maybe a</p>
<p>little bit of oversimplification in my</p>
<p>mind when i look at it now i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re gonna have gut bacteria</p>
<p>for every single macronutrient not just</p>
<p>fiber</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got bacteria that are there just</p>
<p>to break down fats</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got bacteria that are there to</p>
<p>break down proteins in our body and all</p>
<p>of these are all connected with our</p>
<p>immune systems and very intelligent ways</p>
<p>that have over millennia been dealing</p>
<p>with different dietary pathways but when</p>
<p>you look at every diet of every healthy</p>
<p>human being or you know every human</p>
<p>being on this planet before a hundred or</p>
<p>two hundred years ago the main part of</p>
<p>every single cultures diet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unavoidable are animal foods so you know</p>
<p>i mean whether it&rsquo;s in india whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re vegetarian and they don&rsquo;t iver</p>
<p>Emaar the population they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>obsessively consuming milk cream and</p>
<p>cheese and dairy products so it&rsquo;s animal</p>
<p>husbandry animal foods in my opinion and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna really be gaining by</p>
<p>removing these and i would say that that</p>
<p>is objectively true i guess i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>say my opinion i do believe that to be</p>
<p>objectively true which kind of talk</p>
<p>about that quite a bit on channel cuz i</p>
<p>I was a vegan myself for a little while</p>
<p>and eating a very high fiber diet not</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m totally against fiber but I</p>
<p>think we tend to look at plants so we</p>
<p>can be naive and looking at plant says</p>
<p>all of them being so deliciousness and</p>
<p>so great and like plants are just this</p>
<p>panacea of health I think what we might</p>
<p>be seeing and a lot of the medical</p>
<p>literature is what</p>
<p>these plant foods replacing and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually well the bun on the burger you</p>
<p>know I mean if you replacing wheat with</p>
<p>fruit and vegetables like a lot of</p>
<p>people do and they go into a vegan diet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna feel they better so I</p>
<p>think if we don&rsquo;t want to simplify it</p>
<p>too much but uh the gut microbiome is a</p>
<p>complex thing and it does need to digest</p>
<p>proteins and fats as well and eating</p>
<p>very little fiber for me now at this</p>
<p>point feels very good so I I kind of do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right for me well what was the</p>
<p>thing when you were a vegan what was the</p>
<p>thing that said you&rsquo;re you made the</p>
<p>shift into or out of veganism out out of</p>
<p>veganism</p>
<p>okay so vegan for me was a way to get</p>
<p>healthy it was a way to try and use diet</p>
<p>to make mice make my body perform better</p>
<p>right I just I wanted to feel better I</p>
<p>wanted to be clear-headed I wanted to be</p>
<p>without allergies asthma chronic pain</p>
<p>degenerating discs I had injuries so I</p>
<p>started looking at diet and as you</p>
<p>probably know being a chiropractor I</p>
<p>mean you&rsquo;ve been around this stuff for a</p>
<p>long time especially in the mid 2000s a</p>
<p>lot of people&rsquo;s go to alternative health</p>
<p>method was leaning towards plant-based</p>
<p>diets right it was you know people were</p>
<p>getting into like raw vegan which I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really too into a periodically</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go through appears where I&rsquo;d play</p>
<p>around with the idea but that was you</p>
<p>knows it&rsquo;s disastrous for my gut</p>
<p>disastrous for my well-being and I</p>
<p>definitely felt better than on a</p>
<p>standard junk food diet but long-term I</p>
<p>ended up getting really really sick I</p>
<p>contracted some sort of a viral or</p>
<p>bacterial infection I think it was a</p>
<p>virus or I don&rsquo;t know whatever happened</p>
<p>to me I was in bed for a week and there</p>
<p>was a I couldn&rsquo;t drink water for several</p>
<p>days of that week I was evacuating</p>
<p>everything I put in my body I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hold anything down I thought I was gonna</p>
<p>have liver failure that was what was</p>
<p>coming to mind because I could feel I</p>
<p>was just I felt so inflamed and I felt</p>
<p>so deathly sick and when I was so sick I</p>
<p>remember actually telling my wife it was</p>
<p>horrific it was it was beautiful at the</p>
<p>time it was like</p>
<p>but I remember thinking back was so</p>
<p>terrible I remember telling her what I</p>
<p>might die like I feel like a dyke and it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t me just telling her as a joke</p>
<p>like I got the flu a dying babe it was</p>
<p>like it was an intense experience so um</p>
<p>anyways I ended up getting really hungry</p>
<p>for Chickenfoot so sick and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;d never had chicken food soup</p>
<p>chicken foot soup in my life I just knew</p>
<p>that uh traditional Chinese medicine</p>
<p>they always used organs and they would</p>
<p>use the bones and they would use the</p>
<p>whole carcass and make soup and they</p>
<p>would do it for people that cold and flu</p>
<p>so I thought this is what I need when</p>
<p>they come out of this I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>nutritionally depleted I&rsquo;ve been eating</p>
<p>quinoa and feeling guilty when I sneak</p>
<p>in cheese or something just because it</p>
<p>was this idealistic thing of all I can</p>
<p>live without those animal foods I can do</p>
<p>it other people maybe fail because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not eating a Whole Foods diet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it all Whole Foods lentils</p>
<p>beans rice quinoa and a little bit of</p>
<p>goat cheese every now and then but it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t necessary no which I was I was</p>
<p>fooling myself that goat cheese was</p>
<p>priced saving my butt every once in a</p>
<p>while I mean even though making b12</p>
<p>supplements and stuff it just for me it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work so yeah first thing I had</p>
<p>was chicken foot soup after that was</p>
<p>just made the transition you know um I</p>
<p>have a good friend who&rsquo;s a podiatrist</p>
<p>and she does surgery on people&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>all the time and she can always</p>
<p>recognize a vegan I&rsquo;m like what what are</p>
<p>you talking about when she does surgery</p>
<p>smell right now I&rsquo;m gonna know that the</p>
<p>the tissue</p>
<p>it looks gray the tissue is gray it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not bright red like it&rsquo;s great and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like what she goes oh yeah all of my</p>
<p>doctor friends could spot you know like</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s interesting that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible now yeah I mean we</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably looking all right so a</p>
<p>lot of the arguments the argumentation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the main argumentation you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see on the internet against not eating</p>
<p>plants the scurvy so lack of vitamin C</p>
<p>scurvy what is wrong with where what</p>
<p>happens in it scurvy that&rsquo;s you know the</p>
<p>noticeable</p>
<p>you know degenerative factor is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to synthesize collagen so you</p>
<p>start breaking down</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s crazy is when you actually</p>
<p>look at all these people that are doing</p>
<p>diets with no plants in them you look at</p>
<p>the Plains Indians over with they were</p>
<p>including certain plants right but you</p>
<p>look like so I guess maybe the Plains</p>
<p>Indians aren&rsquo;t the best argument or that</p>
<p>but they did eat primarily from the</p>
<p>Buffalo and then you have the Inuit</p>
<p>living off of mostly all animal foods</p>
<p>but of course they would have some kelp</p>
<p>and stuff like that so you can&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>that as an example either but when you</p>
<p>look at a lot of people that are doing</p>
<p>these diets now there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are getting by on steak for there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a few people</p>
<p>Charlene Anderson for instance and</p>
<p>Joelle Anderson they&rsquo;ve got two kids I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying this is a good idea I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that I know that they&rsquo;re healthy</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know these folks but</p>
<p>apparently allegedly they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>20 years just on steaks and they all</p>
<p>seem to be in phenomenal health and they</p>
<p>yeah they they get attacked online for</p>
<p>it and they&rsquo;ve had to remove certain</p>
<p>blog posts because of the negativity</p>
<p>that comes to them but I it&rsquo;s funny what</p>
<p>we consider extreme these days right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I think a lot of this stuff is</p>
<p>culturally induced and recent taboos</p>
<p>against foods like organs foods like</p>
<p>meat we think these foods are bad bacon</p>
<p>and eggs for breakfast oh my goodness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrible when it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what your grandparents did and your</p>
<p>parents were Keeling over from cancer at</p>
<p>30 years old they weren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>Alzheimers degrees a disease like I have</p>
<p>apparently know that we wouldn&rsquo;t get an</p>
<p>owl&rsquo;s dimers disease in it disease in</p>
<p>neurodegeneration in their early 40s</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re seeing today so like you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>arguments against these diets but I</p>
<p>think the scurvy thinks fascinating and</p>
<p>just going back to where your</p>
<p>podiatrists friend notice difference in</p>
<p>tissue quality that&rsquo;s just amazing that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at the absence of</p>
<p>animal fats and of certain vitamin</p>
<p>cofactors like vitamin D vitamin k2</p>
<p>vitamin A all of these involved in the</p>
<p>production of your nervous system so if</p>
<p>you deprive a pig of vitamin A that pig</p>
<p>can be born blind and without eyes and</p>
<p>this has been experimentally done many</p>
<p>times and proven that their nervous</p>
<p>system is not properly forming without</p>
<p>these fat soluble vitamins so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just really horrifying that you&rsquo;d see</p>
<p>things like that but I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because my hip injury that I thought was</p>
<p>getting better when I was on a vegan</p>
<p>diet I don&rsquo;t think it got any better at</p>
<p>all now that I look back it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>amount of healing that I&rsquo;ve seen and of</p>
<p>course it&rsquo;s years later and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with a lot of you know tissue</p>
<p>inflammation and scar tissue and like a</p>
<p>hip or something like that it does take</p>
<p>time to process but man the regeneration</p>
<p>that I noticed as soon as I came out of</p>
<p>that vegan paradigm was just remarkable</p>
<p>and quite frankly frustrating to me</p>
<p>because I I never was ideologically</p>
<p>married to it I think I just stubbornly</p>
<p>wanted to prove to myself that I could</p>
<p>do it and they&rsquo;ll deeper I got into it</p>
<p>the more I kept you know this is just</p>
<p>sheer will I&rsquo;m detoxing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just detox those kind of things I</p>
<p>would tell myself and looking back it</p>
<p>was so silly and even then I knew better</p>
<p>but I still got so wrapped up in it I</p>
<p>mean once you do something like that you</p>
<p>almost have to people have a real hard</p>
<p>time being wrong so they have to</p>
<p>maintain that rightness despite how</p>
<p>wrong it is they&rsquo;ll keep keeping the</p>
<p>right because in Bali</p>
<p>all this stuff invalidates their whole</p>
<p>paradigm so people have this drive to be</p>
<p>right no matter what even if it makes</p>
<p>them unhealthy but one of the reasons I</p>
<p>brought you on is that I do want to add</p>
<p>more recipes for organ meats and stuff</p>
<p>and you have a amazing cookbook which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re sending me and I want to</p>
<p>know more about it but I think the the</p>
<p>organ mines meats you know the problem</p>
<p>is like you have to prepare them you</p>
<p>have to make them taste good there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ways to cook them and the amount of</p>
<p>nutrition I mean even like some of the</p>
<p>Indians they would consume the adrenal</p>
<p>gland not a lot of it just a little bit</p>
<p>of them from the caribou which is</p>
<p>basically the the main organ that or the</p>
<p>gland that has the most vitamin C I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s one of the things they got</p>
<p>a ton of vitamin C from the adrenal</p>
<p>glands because that&rsquo;s where those how so</p>
<p>animal going back to the scurvy thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting point about</p>
<p>vitamin C right so when you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at foods like liver with just got more</p>
<p>vitamin A than almost any other food</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna find in the world it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got 300 like I think for a hundred grams</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around 360 percent of the daily</p>
<p>recommended value of vitamin A and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s retinol for in vitamin A naught</p>
<p>beta carrots right just made a carotene</p>
<p>is very</p>
<p>different so you know you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>the mineral what&rsquo;s in these foods and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different for you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>find in plant-based foods and the</p>
<p>vitamin C thing I think that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting point and you know without</p>
<p>consuming plant products will you get</p>
<p>scurvy so fascinating is you can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>see with Steffensen you know about the</p>
<p>guys Steffensen yeah he lived like the</p>
<p>Inuit for a while</p>
<p>nice he&rsquo;s just cute he wants me to hold</p>
<p>him so I&rsquo;m gonna have to hold prop I</p>
<p>need so Steffensen lived with the Inuit</p>
<p>for years and he hunted with them and he</p>
<p>lived among them and he was not eating</p>
<p>any plant foods at all during this</p>
<p>period he came back and the Western</p>
<p>science didn&rsquo;t believe him that he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get scurvy and died they said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s impossible without vegetables</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get scurvy and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>die and nothing bad happened to the guy</p>
<p>so then he was under medical observation</p>
<p>for I think two years it was either a</p>
<p>year or two years doing the same thing</p>
<p>eating organs fatty animal cuts and meat</p>
<p>and he was totally fine and if you read</p>
<p>you know actually the literature on and</p>
<p>they say much to our surprise he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>die so they&rsquo;re trying to prove this you</p>
<p>know that it&rsquo;s really interesting to me</p>
<p>the the the difficulty in reconciling</p>
<p>the scurvy idea and the not eating</p>
<p>plants but but it has been observed and</p>
<p>so many people that without eating</p>
<p>plants people are not getting these</p>
<p>vitamin C deficiencies well I would</p>
<p>pause it as an alternate thing that</p>
<p>could be happening is you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>lot of these other cofactors that are</p>
<p>involved with the building of collagen</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re eating when you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>animal foods you&rsquo;re eating the entire</p>
<p>college and major matrix of the animal</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a lot of glycine prolene</p>
<p>which these are also precursors to</p>
<p>collagen synthesis so we could be</p>
<p>looking at multiple pathways leading to</p>
<p>the same destination and perhaps just</p>
<p>perhaps you&rsquo;re not gonna have to worry</p>
<p>about scurvy and stuff if you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the right vitamins and minerals in from</p>
<p>the whole animal which Stefan said</p>
<p>observed and he also noted that if he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t eat a lot of fatty pieces and if</p>
<p>he just ate lean meat he would get sick</p>
<p>get diarrhea vomit and feel like crap so</p>
<p>start getting all the scurvy symptom</p>
<p>right well I mean there is actually</p>
<p>vitamin C in liver I mean um like the</p>
<p>gin as well yeah you gave me an active</p>
<p>form of vitamin</p>
<p>I mean vitamin A you got you got iron</p>
<p>you got b12 you got b1 b2 for folate</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just crazy amounts yeah it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>lot of bullet and also coenzyme q10 yeah</p>
<p>so correct I&rsquo;m cute it&rsquo;s a massive</p>
<p>antioxidant very powerful antioxidant</p>
<p>your body also mate yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many nutrients that you can</p>
<p>survive off of I mean you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>thrive you&rsquo;re gonna thrive so so yes I</p>
<p>mean foods like liver if you I think one</p>
<p>of the most powerful scenes and like</p>
<p>what a modern film is in the revenant</p>
<p>when Leonardo DiCaprio his character</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t eaten in days he&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>beaten and busted up he&rsquo;s almost dying</p>
<p>and he finds a guy who had just killed a</p>
<p>buffalo and he gives him the raw liver</p>
<p>and just the visser allottee of that</p>
<p>scene and that being the first thing</p>
<p>then the guy looked at him in his eyes</p>
<p>and looked at him and you could see just</p>
<p>that the most human basic level that</p>
<p>non-verbally this guy understood was</p>
<p>going on and as it was portrayed in the</p>
<p>film it was really beautiful and you</p>
<p>just ate that full liver like it was</p>
<p>like it was his job and when you look at</p>
<p>any apex predators they&rsquo;re all going for</p>
<p>the fatty parts of the animal they go</p>
<p>for the liver the heart and they&rsquo;ll eat</p>
<p>the guts is what I don&rsquo;t they do that</p>
<p>for a reason they do not digest that</p>
<p>lean meat and look for the nutrients and</p>
<p>the lean meat that they do in foods like</p>
<p>marrow and liver and heart so these are</p>
<p>foods that are actually really really</p>
<p>easy to prepare it&rsquo;s not really hard to</p>
<p>make heart or liver a part of your diet</p>
<p>like a few times a week making something</p>
<p>just like some liver sauteed and butter</p>
<p>you know really simple recipes you</p>
<p>mentioned our book like we&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>recipes for an entire section on organ</p>
<p>meats in our book the ketogenic edge</p>
<p>cookbook so we&rsquo;ve got we call it the odd</p>
<p>bit section and we teach you just you</p>
<p>know how to make bone broth how to</p>
<p>prepare liver how to make heart kidney</p>
<p>how to prepare tongue how to make your</p>
<p>own tallow so I mean there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many ways that you can use the entire</p>
<p>animal and get really affordable pieces</p>
<p>of the animal and they&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>nutritious pieces so you mentioned like</p>
<p>you know vitamin adek folate the amount</p>
<p>of b12 and liver is so absurd it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this is the food that people would go</p>
<p>for first when they were starving and</p>
<p>this is literally with one of the most</p>
<p>important human foods in the world is</p>
<p>liver the liver of ruminant animals</p>
<p>especially you know coenzyme q-10 it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>powerful antioxidant as we age we</p>
<p>produce less of it so getting in foods</p>
<p>like liver at least you know once a week</p>
<p>is something that we definitely made a</p>
<p>big part of our lives when we first</p>
<p>started out on eating a higher fat diet</p>
<p>about five years ago my daughter was a</p>
<p>year old</p>
<p>after she experienced dental caries was</p>
<p>likely due to like that&rsquo;s why it hit me</p>
<p>earlier and you said the podiatrist saw</p>
<p>that the bones of these kids we were</p>
<p>doing a vegan diet before my daughter</p>
<p>was conceived</p>
<p>she got dental caries immediately when</p>
<p>they broke through her tom by the grace</p>
<p>of God we weren&rsquo;t doing it well she was</p>
<p>pregnant but we were you know I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have done that I had known I&rsquo;d known</p>
<p>well enough at that time to know that</p>
<p>not you know what the one thing I just I</p>
<p>just remembered when I was a kid</p>
<p>probably five six years old for four of</p>
<p>my birthday I don&rsquo;t know why I requested</p>
<p>this my half of my family is Swedish and</p>
<p>so that we had all these they had the</p>
<p>Swedish butter</p>
<p>I wanted butter I wanted a pound of</p>
<p>butter</p>
<p>I would eat literally just right out of</p>
<p>you know just eat butter I just would</p>
<p>add the kraid it and now I know looking</p>
<p>back I had every single tooth was filled</p>
<p>with you know amalgams and because I had</p>
<p>so many dental cavities I was trying to</p>
<p>find those fat soluble vitamins trying</p>
<p>to get them and Nate Lee but obviously</p>
<p>it was too late because I didn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>eating sugar dough until I was 23 years</p>
<p>old and what&rsquo;s that in when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating sugar it&rsquo;s the white sugar</p>
<p>especially you&rsquo;re having to leach</p>
<p>minerals out of your body to observe and</p>
<p>deal with that sugar to absorb what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the glycation I mean there&rsquo;s a lot going</p>
<p>on so I yeah man that&rsquo;s crazy and when</p>
<p>you look at you what Western a prices</p>
<p>book nutrition and physical degeneration</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s an amazing book so yeah he</p>
<p>gets into the same thing he would have</p>
<p>kids where they were having behavioral</p>
<p>issues and showing</p>
<p>I guess what we would consider now</p>
<p>autism type disorders where you know</p>
<p>social issues not performing well in</p>
<p>school difficulty focusing and he would</p>
<p>always notice a nutritional component in</p>
<p>a degeneration of the teeth he would</p>
<p>give these kids foods like cod liver and</p>
<p>high vitamin butter oil which was just</p>
<p>really concentrated grass-fed butter and</p>
<p>they would regenerate and they become</p>
<p>the best students in the class</p>
<p>frequently so I mean this is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>shame that we&rsquo;re not looking at this</p>
<p>more and he even gets demonized I mean a</p>
<p>lot of people are well that guy you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t trust him it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s old</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an old book and it&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>demonstrated scientifically in</p>
<p>peer-reviewed studies now it&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna fund who&rsquo;s gonna fund this</p>
<p>study you know let&rsquo;s take some orphans</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s give them some good high-fat</p>
<p>foods and let&rsquo;s turn their life around</p>
<p>it see you&rsquo;re not gonna say it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in it it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s ridiculous that</p>
<p>you also do you have like old injuries</p>
<p>is that why you had a lot of pain from</p>
<p>sports yeah uh yeah no I have just for</p>
<p>me being an idiot I heard my hip really</p>
<p>bad skateboarding was involved with a</p>
<p>vehicle that was totally my fault and</p>
<p>yeah so I ran into a car which in turn</p>
<p>reciprocated with its gravity right into</p>
<p>my hip and I was going pretty fast and</p>
<p>yeah so I had a chronic injury there but</p>
<p>also I had some degenerative stuff as</p>
<p>well because you know you mentioned</p>
<p>dental cavities there looking back also</p>
<p>had I think six teeth filled when I was</p>
<p>ten and then various you know dental</p>
<p>issues after that scoliosis was</p>
<p>diagnosed in seventh grade and that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>genetic thing I don&rsquo;t think that my back</p>
<p>was I was just born with it twisted</p>
<p>it was postured I mean it was you know</p>
<p>my bones not being strong enough perhaps</p>
<p>who knows you know just I mean what do</p>
<p>we do all day and when were in school we</p>
<p>lean over our desks and so I think there</p>
<p>are big nutritional deficiencies too</p>
<p>that would be involved with the proper</p>
<p>growth of your spine and the proper</p>
<p>healing and that definitely got me into</p>
<p>looking at nutrition as a way to try to</p>
<p>regenerate the body and be free of pain</p>
<p>and you were you were pretty close to</p>
<p>becoming a chiropractor at one point but</p>
<p>so so did you do still have hip pain</p>
<p>yeah yeah I mean I still have a hip so</p>
<p>still hurts every once in a while</p>
<p>my left side left side is that where you</p>
<p>got hit yeah so I got hit you know going</p>
<p>sideways into the side of a car but also</p>
<p>I remember I was diagnosed Coley osis</p>
<p>before this and even before this injury</p>
<p>happened I would I would get knots in my</p>
<p>my thoracic spine and had really poor</p>
<p>thoracic extension and you know forward</p>
<p>neck all this stuff and man I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>definitely a big proponent or a</p>
<p>proponent but I just definitely been</p>
<p>believer and posture greatly affecting</p>
<p>things like digestion and general health</p>
<p>like I I&rsquo;m uh I&rsquo;m not a chiropractor so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got no invest no vested interest</p>
<p>but but people say chiropractic is whack</p>
<p>your chiropractors are quacks I just</p>
<p>laughed as a man like a chiropractors</p>
<p>and helped me more than any other</p>
<p>conventional medicine doctor that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever been to in my life and I grew up</p>
<p>with asthma allergies you know I was</p>
<p>taking amoxicillin I remember the taste</p>
<p>of amoxicillin I loved it was pink and</p>
<p>it was tasted sweet and I would get it</p>
<p>when I got here infections and the next</p>
<p>time I got an ear infection I&rsquo;d get more</p>
<p>you know I think we all deal with these</p>
<p>things antibiotic use low quality foods</p>
<p>you know even more abrasive foods once</p>
<p>we start trying to get healthy and we</p>
<p>think yeah you know I mean I mean eat a</p>
<p>bunch of broccoli and maybe if it&rsquo;s raw</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better well it&rsquo;s like no Rob</p>
<p>broccoli is not elde food you&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>steam that stuff and you&rsquo;ve got to make</p>
<p>it edible so it&rsquo;s uh yeah the pain and</p>
<p>digestion posture all those things are</p>
<p>definitely linked to me well I&rsquo;m gonna I</p>
<p>want to give you a little tip on the hip</p>
<p>pain because there&rsquo;s something uh that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite magical you can get rid of</p>
<p>hip pain or any injury at all and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very contradictory of so if you if the</p>
<p>car hits you on the left side right is</p>
<p>that word impacted you on the left hip</p>
<p>yep okay so yes you can do this when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done here and then you can tell me</p>
<p>how you feel but do you have a tennis</p>
<p>ball laying around or yeah yeah well</p>
<p>alright so yeah all right yes do you</p>
<p>ever experience pain still I&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>jackhammer next to my desk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good yeah you could probably good</p>
<p>so you can use that ball on there and so</p>
<p>what you want to do and you want to when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done lay on the on the floor and</p>
<p>lay on your right side and put that ball</p>
<p>on the mirror image on the good hip</p>
<p>exactly opposing where you got hit on</p>
<p>the bad hip you put it on the good head</p>
<p>and so and what happens it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>want to find the epicenter of that so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna hurt like hell</p>
<p>in fact yeah good side when you press on</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s gonna hurt way more than you</p>
<p>ever thought that it could hurt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like always like hypersensitive and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just because of the circuits so</p>
<p>when I treat people I never ever ever</p>
<p>ever work on the side of injury because</p>
<p>that just takes too long</p>
<p>this new method works like that so you</p>
<p>put it on the good side that no one ever</p>
<p>even deals with and you lay on it right</p>
<p>on that hip right on the mirror image</p>
<p>and for about two minutes and then stand</p>
<p>up and then see how it feels on the</p>
<p>other side it just puts you&rsquo;ll feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s blood flow circulation it just</p>
<p>starts coming back you&rsquo;re like what the</p>
<p>house is so amazing I mean yeah you can</p>
<p>put pressure on one part of the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s low in the body and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>affect how your neck is feeling and you</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so incredible</p>
<p>especially you have this yeah let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>ahead oh I do I&rsquo;m just digging out on</p>
<p>just thinking of what the heck&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on there when you got electrical current</p>
<p>and different magnetic fields being</p>
<p>created by those electrical currents and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so much energy in the body</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like I mean it&rsquo;s I love thinking</p>
<p>about what even happens kinetically hit</p>
<p>her in our body when those are going and</p>
<p>those things are happening yeah because</p>
<p>you have you have a loss of</p>
<p>communication lines internet areas of</p>
<p>injury so you have a high amount of</p>
<p>resistance so you just throw off the</p>
<p>entire electrical field so but the cool</p>
<p>thing is that that circuit is is</p>
<p>connected to the spinal column on the</p>
<p>mirror-image side so it&rsquo;s all one so you</p>
<p>can influence this side by working on</p>
<p>this side it works with like I was</p>
<p>weightlifting with sandals once okay and</p>
<p>I had a 45 pound dumbbell and I dropped</p>
<p>in my toe okay so that hurt so I</p>
<p>instantly started working</p>
<p>the opposite BAM took took all the pain</p>
<p>way healed real quick same thing with</p>
<p>the tip of my finger I closed the door</p>
<p>on it crushed it work on the opposite</p>
<p>side so injuries you always work on the</p>
<p>opposite and like they don&rsquo;t teach this</p>
<p>in school they don&rsquo;t teach it they</p>
<p>actually tell you to start working on</p>
<p>the inflammatory areas and you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>that thing for like the next 10 years it</p>
<p>never gets goes yeah it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>deeper you dig it into that scar tissue</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just like oh yeah I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>push it right back yes longer yeah right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny and then you find yourself</p>
<p>walking differently and then you see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna affect all the way up your</p>
<p>entire spine and if you&rsquo;re walking weird</p>
<p>and you know same thing with gut issues</p>
<p>right you can get gut issues that are</p>
<p>greatly exacerbated by injuries or vice</p>
<p>versa</p>
<p>yeah the the biggest thing I see in</p>
<p>Pride this is probably the most common</p>
<p>thing in practice is gall bladder</p>
<p>congestion the gall bladder from</p>
<p>probably high insulin right the gall</p>
<p>bladder there&rsquo;s a nerve right connected</p>
<p>is called the phrenic that goes right up</p>
<p>to the right side of the neck and nearly</p>
<p>100% of time any time people have</p>
<p>right-sided headaches right shoulder</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the gallbladder you massage</p>
<p>the gall bladder the pain goes away I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s so common everyone comes in</p>
<p>with it they&rsquo;re blown away again they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been working on the shoulder for the ten</p>
<p>years doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t help so a lot</p>
<p>of pain is referred one yeah yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so amazing the human body is so</p>
<p>incredible I think you know the way that</p>
<p>people look at it we look at it in</p>
<p>segments like it&rsquo;s a I don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>that game operation or something right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s my arm and in no way is</p>
<p>my arm connected to my foot yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all connected yeah yeah I I have some</p>
<p>book that haven&rsquo;t got a look at yet but</p>
<p>uh Thomas Myers Anatomy trains I really</p>
<p>want to look at that yet have you ever</p>
<p>seen that one he&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a body worker of some type or</p>
<p>my shirt as a chiropractor but he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>an interesting interesting perspective</p>
<p>just on the holistic nature of the human</p>
<p>body and movement I haven&rsquo;t seen that I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it but the thing is when</p>
<p>like I had a cast practice</p>
<p>and so I didn&rsquo;t accept insurance and so</p>
<p>you had you were forced to get results</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t get results people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t gonna come back so it kept</p>
<p>pushing you know more and more like I</p>
<p>mean to the point where these people</p>
<p>would come in expecting like okay I want</p>
<p>all my problems gone into business so</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s kind of where my head was</p>
<p>wrote for many years but like when you</p>
<p>have the typical Rock&rsquo;em Sock&rsquo;em crack</p>
<p>on practice where you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>lining people up and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>cracking stuff it&rsquo;s like I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where carp are just get a bad name yeah</p>
<p>yeah so I mean you really begin to give</p>
<p>me people with corrective exercises and</p>
<p>you know showing them how to manage</p>
<p>their posture and stuff throughout the</p>
<p>day afterwards</p>
<p>well what I&rsquo;m bigging is really</p>
<p>understanding that the essence of the</p>
<p>injury and all the compensatory muscles</p>
<p>that are happening especially with ankle</p>
<p>stuff and nice stuff which how it throws</p>
<p>off the opposite hip and the shoulder</p>
<p>and so going through the whole thing and</p>
<p>stripping off all these compensations</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like very fascinating and then</p>
<p>you you find out why the person can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hold the treatment because they&rsquo;re they</p>
<p>have these muscle that&rsquo;s been working</p>
<p>twice as hard and no one ever dealt with</p>
<p>that because they fell on their knee</p>
<p>when there were seven and then that</p>
<p>created this over here so you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with like all these interesting ropes</p>
<p>that are too tight you&rsquo;re an accident</p>
<p>yeah the psychology of it all - yes</p>
<p>probably the huge emotional component</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see with people somebody used the</p>
<p>press is gonna have a compress I could</p>
<p>kya phonic posture that&rsquo;s gonna affect</p>
<p>their how their chest is other breathing</p>
<p>how their diaphragm moves I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>affect their digestion yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to get like a history of old</p>
<p>injuries I&rsquo;m talking like falling on</p>
<p>your tailbone I mean I was upside down</p>
<p>on a swing set when I was five and fell</p>
<p>right on my head and compressed and</p>
<p>jammed my neck I mean I probably I think</p>
<p>what got me so interested is cuz I had</p>
<p>pretty much more injury than any person</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to ask you you</p>
<p>must be I mean that no one gets into</p>
<p>chiropractic just cuz like oh I want to</p>
<p>make a bunch of money as a chiropractor</p>
<p>like you got to have a specific reason</p>
<p>Oh injuries wrestling injuries have</p>
<p>fractured my neck wrestling in college I</p>
<p>mean just snap your neck yeah and then I</p>
<p>kept wrestling a broken</p>
<p>the ankle the shoulder this I was I was</p>
<p>driving a bike up a hill on the cement</p>
<p>fast as I could go and I the chain fell</p>
<p>off and I landed on this elbow is</p>
<p>completely no Sprint in your chain yes</p>
<p>the chain canceled words going so hard</p>
<p>Oh No yeah and so it actually the told</p>
<p>chain it was a the bike jammed and it</p>
<p>just threw me right off like you always</p>
<p>think you can tuck and roll it happened</p>
<p>so fast all I could do is turn my head</p>
<p>and kiss the cement and it felt like</p>
<p>some of my tooth just like jammed up and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like damn like that&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>while before I feel normal again</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s - I just remembered this</p>
<p>and they hit my head pretty hard you</p>
<p>know maybe you know suburban fence so</p>
<p>maybe five foot five and a half foot</p>
<p>tall you know like your dad can look</p>
<p>over it but you got to climb up it and</p>
<p>yeah I was playing hide and seek running</p>
<p>from my friend and fell off the top of</p>
<p>the fence straight down on my head side</p>
<p>down just straight to my head you know</p>
<p>like forward you know right there so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got you know I&rsquo;ve got like a little</p>
<p>I mean you just get up and you just like</p>
<p>somehow how did you survive learn swear</p>
<p>words recently so I think I said some</p>
<p>swear words and went to the doctor got a</p>
<p>couple stitches he was like now you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a concussion you&rsquo;re fine kid</p>
<p>and then just moved on but who knows I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m sure that wasn&rsquo;t great for my</p>
<p>spinal cord oh your neck you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>active I was running I was we were</p>
<p>playing outside in the dark running I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see the clothesline it was right</p>
<p>on my neck and I literally almost</p>
<p>severed my head and I mean like I go to</p>
<p>school the next day and there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>huge like red mark and I&rsquo;m like why did</p>
<p>I do that you know so there&rsquo;s some film</p>
<p>I watched a few years ago is like this</p>
<p>Ridley Scott film about</p>
<p>drug smugglers I forget was called the</p>
<p>counselor do you ever watch shows a</p>
<p>weird movie now a lot of dialogue I</p>
<p>thought it was actually a good film this</p>
<p>maybe some people would be annoyed</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s very kind of pretentious</p>
<p>dialogue but yeah there was a thing</p>
<p>where they they they would strung a</p>
<p>piece of just metal wire across the road</p>
<p>to get a guy&rsquo;s head when he was on his</p>
<p>motorcycle eppard that was pretty</p>
<p>picturesque that I remember and that was</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>yeah that was her that was almost you</p>
<p>good thing you couldn&rsquo;t run that yes I</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>well I my feet came up I literally</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t breathe I&rsquo;m like I just somehow</p>
<p>lucked out I mean I&rsquo;ve done so many</p>
<p>things where it just almost could have</p>
<p>went this way and so but if I can you</p>
<p>know in one hand it was good because it</p>
<p>forced me to come up with techniques</p>
<p>that deal with pain and chronic injury</p>
<p>and also old injury and inflammation and</p>
<p>basically I have I put it all on YouTube</p>
<p>so people can watch and get rid of their</p>
<p>injuries now you get a help how many</p>
<p>people I mean you owe million people</p>
<p>pricing your videos so I mean you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>what a blessing all these other people</p>
<p>that you and I can just be so dumb</p>
<p>sometimes idiotic there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>condition called reflex sympathetic</p>
<p>dystrophy have you ever heard that</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s called simple a sympathetic</p>
<p>reflex well something like that</p>
<p>anyway this weird condition is when you</p>
<p>get surgery on an area and then you have</p>
<p>chronic pain it&rsquo;s so bad on some people</p>
<p>that they basically commit suicide it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so bad so they it&rsquo;s after surgery they</p>
<p>they have a neuroma on the foot and then</p>
<p>they get taken out and now they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>walk and it debilitated that is the</p>
<p>easiest thing to correct on the planet</p>
<p>with the and I&rsquo;m talking within minutes</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll have people that will literally</p>
<p>come in with that and they&rsquo;ll walk out</p>
<p>like just without any pain so why does</p>
<p>that work so well because I work on the</p>
<p>opposite side no one does that no one</p>
<p>does that they do more surgery on the</p>
<p>area of injury and I&rsquo;m like oh my god</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like taking an open wound and just</p>
<p>like digging in there so so completely</p>
<p>sometimes what we think is gonna be good</p>
<p>for us</p>
<p>a complete opposite of a kind of contra</p>
<p>to ative but I actually I contacted some</p>
<p>of the support groups I&rsquo;m like hey guys</p>
<p>I can I can help you and it&rsquo;s weird like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not interested I&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>no thanks I&rsquo;m like I got my doctor I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like no no I can get rid of your pain</p>
<p>okay no no I&rsquo;m good I&rsquo;m like okay all</p>
<p>right interesting I mean I mean a guy</p>
<p>like you going through all those</p>
<p>injuries and then what was the final I</p>
<p>mean how did you even hear about</p>
<p>chiropractic and and pull the trigger to</p>
<p>actually go for it and ten do that well</p>
<p>it was ninth grade actually uh my</p>
<p>grandfather I never met him but he was a</p>
<p>chiropractor and I said well what&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chiropractor do my mom brought me there</p>
<p>after some injuries from wrestling and</p>
<p>he said lay down and I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna do and he went and I go oh my</p>
<p>god I feel so good I said I said you</p>
<p>like what you do and he said yes I said</p>
<p>I want to do that so I&rsquo;m gonna be a</p>
<p>chiropractor ninth grade so that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>I knew so I had to go through pre-med I</p>
<p>went through pre-med you had pain before</p>
<p>ninth grade so you were in chronic pain</p>
<p>I went in there and 14 year old right</p>
<p>yeah I mean by the time I was 20 I had</p>
<p>my hands were arthritic arthritis down</p>
<p>the spine I was like messed up I was</p>
<p>like a basketball so that&rsquo;s what drove</p>
<p>me to this saying and then unfortunately</p>
<p>the way they teach you in school is not</p>
<p>always the most effective I had to kind</p>
<p>of figure it out because it didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for me I mean it didn&rsquo;t hold you know</p>
<p>you get adjusted and you have to keep</p>
<p>coming back but I will say this if you</p>
<p>find a really good doc there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>better than a really good adjustment</p>
<p>where he has the right amount of force</p>
<p>the right amount of just the perfect</p>
<p>amount of tension and bam it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>oh my gosh this is it&rsquo;s the best and my</p>
<p>experience too is them knowing what to</p>
<p>adjust right rather than just you know</p>
<p>if you see him you know if they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>lining them up with crank and a mouse</p>
<p>but yeah I had to shop around for</p>
<p>chiropractors because I met a few that</p>
<p>were just okay I can tell you just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just looking at me as like</p>
<p>alright next guy where there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>chiropractors you sit down you talk to</p>
<p>them and they look at</p>
<p>you can just you could see it them</p>
<p>engineering reverse engineering your</p>
<p>body as they ask you questions and you</p>
<p>cannot yeah it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>relationship that develops unfortunately</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s seminars within the car</p>
<p>part of community that basically call</p>
<p>volume seminars volume go for Vaughn I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like a thousand patients in a</p>
<p>week a hundred patients a day</p>
<p>and you know you know it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taking the time it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>Rock&rsquo;em Sock&rsquo;em number game just cracker</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s I can crack every bone in</p>
<p>your body and then the conventional</p>
<p>medicine model right like I guess if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you want to be like a normal you</p>
<p>know the the American Medical</p>
<p>Association that&rsquo;s that seems to be like</p>
<p>the standard of care that I got you go</p>
<p>in what are your symptoms</p>
<p>right I mean your knee with a piece of</p>
<p>rubber up here put this in your mouth</p>
<p>for two minutes okay here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>amoxicillin you gone you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it was just who am I even talking to</p>
<p>like so half of doctors don&rsquo;t even look</p>
<p>you in the face they just walk in all</p>
<p>soaked in and inflamed like the face is</p>
<p>like five flaps hanging off itself look</p>
<p>half-dead like what what is this I had</p>
<p>one doctor that I felt cared and he was</p>
<p>a he was a really nice guy dr. Linea</p>
<p>Weaver he was he looked like John Luke</p>
<p>Picard from from Star Trek and he was uh</p>
<p>it was an asthma doctor and but he still</p>
<p>had asthma but he was it was it was like</p>
<p>seven years old but he had running</p>
<p>trophies on his desk and he&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>know still uses an inhaler but he would</p>
<p>use to asthma guy and he wanted to help</p>
<p>people but all you knew how to do is</p>
<p>have you blow into a freaking bingo and</p>
<p>then say yeah you&rsquo;re fighting today here</p>
<p>next time you get your next time your</p>
<p>lungs seized up and you can&rsquo;t breathe</p>
<p>inhale this steroid and it was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no thinking maybe diet is</p>
<p>affecting you you know maybe connections</p>
<p>you know maybe you should be looking at</p>
<p>other lifestyle factors maybe you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be eating Cheerios and Mama</p>
<p>should be making you some some eggs in</p>
<p>the morning and maybe have some liver</p>
<p>once a week you know you&rsquo;re just little</p>
<p>things like that that we don&rsquo;t get told</p>
<p>in abundance and it almost goes against</p>
<p>conventional wisdom to what we end up</p>
<p>finding out works where it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>we need fats right and we that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>heel</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you find that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost every single recommendation is</p>
<p>the truth is the opposite I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s literally I&rsquo;m serious it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hundred percent it&rsquo;s so hard it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>hard to like it could be really hard for</p>
<p>me to try and and legitimize any of the</p>
<p>things that the mainstream medical</p>
<p>establishment says so I&rsquo;m just I feel</p>
<p>like myself</p>
<p>constantly just trying to understand</p>
<p>from somebody&rsquo;s perspective who buys</p>
<p>into the charade I don&rsquo;t I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the big charade at this point it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so much it&rsquo;s so backwards</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so maybe that&rsquo;s just the nature</p>
<p>of it though where it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>obviously doctors think they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the right thing right and the people of</p>
<p>these pharmaceutical companies they</p>
<p>probably think that they&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>right thing because when you&rsquo;re blind</p>
<p>you can be completely blinded by greed</p>
<p>so easily people human beings are so</p>
<p>flawed we&rsquo;re so we&rsquo;re so open to</p>
<p>manipulation by our lower nature that</p>
<p>yeah I mean it&rsquo;s I mean to look at an</p>
<p>entire profession and think oh wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;ve all been duped it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s really not that hard I mean</p>
<p>humans are greedy creatures we really</p>
<p>easily puffed up with pride alright so</p>
<p>if you tell somebody that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>brilliant because they went into $20,000</p>
<p>worth of debt or because daddy pushed</p>
<p>him so hard when they&rsquo;re a little kid</p>
<p>made him want to go to Harvard and</p>
<p>become a doctor and now you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to pay off their debt now</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like we think that it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>easy for us to to be blinded and to be</p>
<p>ideologically completely possessed by</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s not beneficial to us or</p>
<p>anybody else just because we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money or because you know being we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>insecure and we want to be accepted by</p>
<p>society we want to be accepted by daddy</p>
<p>and mommy so therefore I&rsquo;m a doctor or a</p>
<p>lawyer or you know whatever it is and we</p>
<p>tell ourselves and yeah it&rsquo;s so sad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so sad to see people suffer I have a</p>
<p>little other theory about like in</p>
<p>medical school because I went to pre-med</p>
<p>and you you basically do not have time</p>
<p>to learn the information you don&rsquo;t this</p>
<p>is too much style it&rsquo;s too much data</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s volumes of data so what you end up</p>
<p>doing is you end up</p>
<p>memorizing things getting passing the</p>
<p>test without any any application or</p>
<p>knowledge or any evaluation of the data</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s true or not so we accept</p>
<p>it all is true and then you keep doing</p>
<p>that over over years and years and you</p>
<p>literally brainwash yourself to the</p>
<p>point where you get out of school and</p>
<p>you have all these fixed ideas because</p>
<p>you you can&rsquo;t think anymore you you went</p>
<p>in be able to think now you can&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually dumber when you graduate</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even your professors are also</p>
<p>in this your professors are just like a</p>
<p>little deeper into the prison to like</p>
<p>where they figured out like you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like the shot-callers in the</p>
<p>prison but they get yeah they get like</p>
<p>the the more accolades and they think</p>
<p>they get a little bit more power and</p>
<p>they get a puffed-up so then you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy and I look at my university</p>
<p>experience and looking at every probably</p>
<p>I went to school within the whole system</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you it kids out there if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in high school or something when</p>
<p>you graduate from university and you</p>
<p>know you get your bachelor&rsquo;s degree then</p>
<p>you get your master&rsquo;s degree then you</p>
<p>get your PhD now of course I&rsquo;ve I</p>
<p>stopped at a bachelor&rsquo;s degree but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you this you get your bachelor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>degree you come out just as dumb</p>
<p>confused lost frustrated and just</p>
<p>totally bewildered as when you graduated</p>
<p>eighth grade you&rsquo;re basically and you</p>
<p>can but you have debt and you&rsquo;re told</p>
<p>that you have this responsibility and</p>
<p>that responsibility and you know you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got you got all this other stuff going</p>
<p>on oh man the whole the education</p>
<p>systems me I&rsquo;m incredibly kind of black</p>
<p>pilled on the whole education system I</p>
<p>think that most of it is just it&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>create ideologies and it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>when you look at the people who created</p>
<p>the public school system and you look at</p>
<p>their writings they actually write about</p>
<p>it as a utopian concept that has nothing</p>
<p>to do with intellectual endeavor has</p>
<p>nothing to do with increasing human</p>
<p>intelligence it&rsquo;s about creating a</p>
<p>utopian society of perfect of a</p>
<p>perfectly functioning little society as</p>
<p>they see it to be ordered which is</p>
<p>basically a bunch of people doing</p>
<p>repetitive tasks in factories and you</p>
<p>know being able to regurgitate</p>
<p>information we&rsquo;re gonna say I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>mold you into being a perfect citizen</p>
<p>and you can work in our factories and</p>
<p>get your certification and I know it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s actually honestly I</p>
<p>told my kids that movie metropolis</p>
<p>remember it&rsquo;s like metropolis and and</p>
<p>the the neophytes student is the the</p>
<p>golem the the the false create creature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to be made and the whole</p>
<p>ritualistic society around it in this</p>
<p>film is it&rsquo;s just there to create this</p>
<p>new human which is a total robot in that</p>
<p>film and then I guess that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty that&rsquo;s a pretty funny vision</p>
<p>other but I really isn&rsquo;t so far off from</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s now now I think some of the</p>
<p>brightest minds they may either dropouts</p>
<p>or they are self-taught and I mean</p>
<p>unless you find it really I&rsquo;ve had one</p>
<p>really good teacher chemistry but other</p>
<p>than that I mean there&rsquo;s some brilliant</p>
<p>guys in the humanities departments of</p>
<p>the schools that I went to that were</p>
<p>like Canaries in the coal mine right</p>
<p>there basically in there you know</p>
<p>speaking out against what&rsquo;s all around</p>
<p>them that&rsquo;s what I found there there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>few good ones in there and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of ideologue who are just totally</p>
<p>puffed up with pride and they think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re geniuses because they have a</p>
<p>paycheck and you know 18 year old girls</p>
<p>flirt with them over beers at the dining</p>
<p>hall it&rsquo;s sad you know I mean the</p>
<p>university system it&rsquo;s silly and I I</p>
<p>think I think it&rsquo;s valuable to get</p>
<p>educated and get and to learn like I</p>
<p>have obviously a voracious hunger for</p>
<p>knowledge but you know it&rsquo;s the Internet</p>
<p>and now not that the Internet&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>or you know that it&rsquo;s not addictive and</p>
<p>she bruins people many ways but we have</p>
<p>access to so much knowledge and we can</p>
<p>we can learn a lot outside of roarin</p>
<p>different structures and I think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s better ways to go about it then</p>
<p>we do in our modern system and I hope to</p>
<p>see reform in it and more independent</p>
<p>teachers right like guys like you who</p>
<p>are doubt they&rsquo;re educating people and</p>
<p>helping people and you mentioned that</p>
<p>you actually would you know train other</p>
<p>chiropractors and seminars and stuff too</p>
<p>so yeah I think this that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>yeah that was some it was it was good it</p>
<p>was a lot of work but then I found out</p>
<p>it was easier to train the lay person I</p>
<p>was like wow they don&rsquo;t have all these</p>
<p>fixed ideas so what I did is I said you</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;m just gonna I&rsquo;m gonna put</p>
<p>all this information out there and see</p>
<p>what happens and people liked it and</p>
<p>there apply and they get it they don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>mean I think the more educated someone</p>
<p>is the more educated the harder it is</p>
<p>for them to learn new things and so I</p>
<p>had these guys that like went way beyond</p>
<p>their basic training and man they just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get it so I mean they got</p>
<p>straight A&rsquo;s but they couldn&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not very practical they couldn&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>make it in the real life so anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a long story well I get you</p>
<p>know with nutrition it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>like you know ya had to kind of have to</p>
<p>figure it out outside the standard</p>
<p>guidelines that we&rsquo;ve been given and you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s funny because we can be</p>
<p>told well this food these are bad</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re high in cholesterol you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have eggs or bacon you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t eat these foods because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got cholesterol I mean this is</p>
<p>these are the things that we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>told and we have to actually be able to</p>
<p>first of all be intelligent enough to</p>
<p>question it and then second of all be</p>
<p>confident enough to be able to live in a</p>
<p>manner without being constantly worried</p>
<p>about the other narratives right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you have to uh it takes a lot for</p>
<p>people to actually even start to</p>
<p>implement some of these nutritional</p>
<p>practices that have been around forever</p>
<p>like emags and butter right not cooking</p>
<p>in margarine not using vegetable oil not</p>
<p>eating bread every freakin meal because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even human food</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re things that we&rsquo;ve kind of had to</p>
<p>figure out on our own but you know I</p>
<p>think you know bringing it back to like</p>
<p>the basics of human nutrition that are</p>
<p>unavoidably important if certain fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins that we need right I</p>
<p>mean we need things like vitamin A</p>
<p>vitamin D vitamin K and we need these</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamins we need protein</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easily digested and a lot of</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t digesting very well and</p>
<p>animal-based foods actually digest</p>
<p>easier than any other foods out there</p>
<p>and we forget because we&rsquo;ve been so</p>
<p>inundated with you know thinking the</p>
<p>soluble fiber and taking you know</p>
<p>psyllium husk powder and Metamucil is</p>
<p>how you get good digestion but you know</p>
<p>fats and foods like marrow play a really</p>
<p>important part in our bone marrows got</p>
<p>components and you can actually</p>
<p>regenerate your gut lining with I mean</p>
<p>bone marrow is filled with adiponectin</p>
<p>in our body so our bone marrow stores</p>
<p>this adiponectin</p>
<p>which helps us to maintain insulin</p>
<p>sensitivity helps us to break down fat</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s also associated high levels of</p>
<p>adiponectin associated with decreased</p>
<p>risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes</p>
<p>and all these other conditions so I mean</p>
<p>just eating foods like this like Mara</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s so rich in fats where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got all these stem cells of the animal</p>
<p>being stored in the fat in the marrow</p>
<p>and all these regenerative properties</p>
<p>have been associated with these foods</p>
<p>for millennia but we&rsquo;ve suddenly started</p>
<p>throwing these foods out because we</p>
<p>thought they were useless so what am I</p>
<p>gonna do with these bones what I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>do with this liver now we forget that</p>
<p>the best parts the animal so you know</p>
<p>just learning how to implement that</p>
<p>foods like liver and heart one of the</p>
<p>things that we like to do we usually</p>
<p>recommend people when you&rsquo;re first</p>
<p>starting out try heart hearts one of the</p>
<p>most nutrient-dense pieces of the animal</p>
<p>and you can get it ground up just like</p>
<p>ground beef from a butcher yeah so you</p>
<p>just go to a butcher you get it crowned</p>
<p>up with your ground beef you can do like</p>
<p>75252 star or you can go up to like 50%</p>
<p>heart but we&rsquo;ll make meatball sometimes</p>
<p>with a hundred percent beef heart it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very lean so you&rsquo;re probably gonna want</p>
<p>to add some sort of fat have with that</p>
<p>you know grass butter q10 on steroids</p>
<p>exactly litter like your heart you think</p>
<p>about your heart so your heart is the</p>
<p>most powerful magnetic field in your</p>
<p>body besides your brain and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the most mitochondria in our</p>
<p>body actually the heart and the brain so</p>
<p>these two tissues are also the some of</p>
<p>the most important stores of certain</p>
<p>vitamins and factors and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna find elsewhere you know the brain</p>
<p>and got a lot of DHA the human brain</p>
<p>needs fats it&rsquo;s made mostly of</p>
<p>cholesterol and DHA and then coenzyme</p>
<p>q10 in heart you&rsquo;re not gonna find any</p>
<p>other food in the planet with more</p>
<p>colons on q10 than art also loads of</p>
<p>iron folate but it just tastes amazing</p>
<p>too so you didn&rsquo;t make meatballs with</p>
<p>ground-up heart we really like doing</p>
<p>that like Jessica&rsquo;s got some recipe</p>
<p>called Mama&rsquo;s best meatballs in her book</p>
<p>which she gave me an author credit but I</p>
<p>you know good my wife she did this whole</p>
<p>book Jessica she&rsquo;s the brains behind the</p>
<p>ketogenic edge cookbook so I kind of</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to get it because I I what</p>
<p>I want to do is now I I do a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables but I don&rsquo;t want to do like</p>
<p>chicken lean chicken breasts what I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to do is do my bed user fermented</p>
<p>and then add the organ meats with that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I want to try I think that</p>
<p>and then add the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>cuz you&rsquo;re gonna get like massive</p>
<p>quantities of fat soluble vitamins way</p>
<p>better than a piece of lean protein you</p>
<p>know like a chicken breast it I look at</p>
<p>chicken breast it&rsquo;s like then the totem</p>
<p>pole of protein sources like chicken is</p>
<p>least priority for me like ruminant</p>
<p>animals you&rsquo;re getting so much more and</p>
<p>the liver the heart I mean even the</p>
<p>brain like we show you how to make brain</p>
<p>in the book to it like real simple</p>
<p>traditional recipes that people have</p>
<p>used for so long like you know eggs and</p>
<p>brain scrambled eggs and brain is how</p>
<p>they do it here they&rsquo;ll make tortillas</p>
<p>as well with just the egg and the brain</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll just fry it up on both</p>
<p>sides until I don&rsquo;t like to fry stuff</p>
<p>too super hardcore but here they&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>a tortilla oh just brain the egg so I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s you know these are foods that</p>
<p>and I live in Ecuador by the way for</p>
<p>definitely I don&rsquo;t think we talked about</p>
<p>that but I&rsquo;m yeah you know just really</p>
<p>easy air Foods liver you can also the</p>
<p>little tip I gave about ground beef you</p>
<p>can grind up liver with it too so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;ve got a week where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so busy and you&rsquo;re just man I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to have to prepare five different meals</p>
<p>this week I&rsquo;m gonna make a bunch of meat</p>
<p>this week you can just mix in some liver</p>
<p>and some heart ground liver ground heart</p>
<p>with your ground beef and have much more</p>
<p>nutrient density and you know of course</p>
<p>you know if you like vegetables we I</p>
<p>just because I don&rsquo;t eat vegetables</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean I think everybody should</p>
<p>avoid vegetables I know everybody&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>somewhere else in their journey and I</p>
<p>like to experiment with different things</p>
<p>so now I like you mentioned sauerkraut</p>
<p>because we put a sauerkraut recipe we</p>
<p>show you how to make sauerkraut in the</p>
<p>book to eat just those are all the foods</p>
<p>that you know that are our grandparents</p>
<p>were eating that every single generation</p>
<p>before us was preparing plants in a</p>
<p>specific way and using things like</p>
<p>fermentation storing things in specific</p>
<p>ways so I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important that we understand how to</p>
<p>prepare these foods and yeah you know</p>
<p>properly prepared</p>
<p>sauerkraut can be so amazing I love the</p>
<p>juice the vitamins all art so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna do I&rsquo;m going to I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>get your book and I&rsquo;m gonna actually</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing a series of like</p>
<p>recipes like keto bombs</p>
<p>but now we&rsquo;re gonna do a series of organ</p>
<p>meat recipes out of your book and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try babies meatballs some we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>some heart we&rsquo;ll just some brain and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just amazing as I think you can</p>
<p>input on ways to vary them too because</p>
<p>over the years you&rsquo;ve always you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this was kind of made this was</p>
<p>like our kitchen this is kind of like</p>
<p>our kitchen transmute it into a book</p>
<p>okay we have it as a book - which is I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>the ebooks way cheaper</p>
<p>obviously print it out but we we really</p>
<p>like we had a lot of fun doing this and</p>
<p>we really liked taking certain recipes</p>
<p>and rearranging them so we take like</p>
<p>Mama&rsquo;s best meatballs recipe which is</p>
<p>just like a normal meatball recipe not</p>
<p>too many ingredients simple</p>
<p>straightforward meatball recipe with a</p>
<p>little bit of crunch in it because that</p>
<p>always helps with meatballs but you can</p>
<p>just substitute some organ meat for that</p>
<p>ground beef and make that rest I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>try that I mean I know what it takes to</p>
<p>put together a recipe book it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>is a lot of work because you get it you</p>
<p>know type all the recipes out and in the</p>
<p>pictures and all that stuff so anyway</p>
<p>guys for those of you that are</p>
<p>interesting I&rsquo;m gonna put a link with</p>
<p>his book down below so check it out but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make some recipes and I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m I want to do more organ stuff</p>
<p>and I think of course we&rsquo;re talking high</p>
<p>quality we&rsquo;re not talking like</p>
<p>conventional you know animal products</p>
<p>but yeah usually with the organs that</p>
<p>going for the grass yeah you want to</p>
<p>exactly not have a lot of hormones</p>
<p>people think foods like liver I think</p>
<p>when you talk about Oregon&rsquo;s people like</p>
<p>well isn&rsquo;t the liver and the kidney</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t those filters don&rsquo;t those just</p>
<p>filter things out they think of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I Drive on a dusty road all the</p>
<p>time here in Ecuador it&rsquo;s all dirt roads</p>
<p>and they I got to clean my air filter</p>
<p>every few months which glad I just</p>
<p>reminded myself I got to buy some of</p>
<p>this spray oil stuff to clean it out and</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s not what the liver does</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like the liver is you know dr.</p>
<p>burgher liver is making enzymes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making vitamins and storing vitamins so</p>
<p>that it can deal with and remove toxic</p>
<p>loads from the body extra toxins end up</p>
<p>when they can&rsquo;t be processed by the</p>
<p>liver being excreted in other ways or</p>
<p>stored in fat tissue so yeah I think</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating like you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>May</p>
<p>in tallow I really prefer going for the</p>
<p>grass-fed high quality stuff whenever</p>
<p>possible and doing your best to get</p>
<p>quality so yeah we&rsquo;re will having food</p>
<p>quality for me absolutely</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m excited to do that and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you some of the videos and you</p>
<p>could see we&rsquo;ll see well it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a taste test and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna experiment we&rsquo;ll put some stuff</p>
<p>together and we need to do a series of</p>
<p>these organ meats because it&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t do it anymore so we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>increase some awareness I think I think</p>
<p>how about you guys fly down here to</p>
<p>Ecuador come into our kitchen we&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>some organ meats here you eat some</p>
<p>Ecuadorian grass-fed beef beef liver and</p>
<p>right down the street right there right</p>
<p>you know but for you to fly from Florida</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so long it&rsquo;s actually not so</p>
<p>long but uh yeah what Jen went to</p>
<p>Columbia how let&rsquo;s see Ecuador is</p>
<p>probably next to Peru isn&rsquo;t it yeah yeah</p>
<p>between Peru and Colombia yeah I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>to Colombia that was an interesting what</p>
<p>was the name of that sitios and it was</p>
<p>an interesting city just Holley name a</p>
<p>couple more it&rsquo;s at the top party midday</p>
<p>een there&rsquo;s another another place I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>Colombia is a big beautiful country that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to I didn&rsquo;t know a lot</p>
<p>of really awesome salons doing really</p>
<p>well now with there&rsquo;s like very little</p>
<p>crime and it&rsquo;s really turned around the</p>
<p>economy&rsquo;s good but what happened was I</p>
<p>had to leave and the Pope is flying in</p>
<p>right after me and there was a hurricane</p>
<p>do you shine what the heck man there was</p>
<p>a hurricane and I&rsquo;m like so I bought a</p>
<p>one-way ticket because I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when I was gonna come back and I was</p>
<p>doing a convention and so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hurricane and they jacked up the price</p>
<p>is a one-way ticket I had to go from</p>
<p>Panama to Cancun to Texas cost me $2,500</p>
<p>for a one-way ticket back home and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like ouch but anyway you&rsquo;re forever</p>
<p>traumatized so you&rsquo;ll never come visit</p>
<p>in Ecuador because what those dings</p>
<p>airlines going to Colombia this they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually good flights from from Miami to</p>
<p>poquito you know that the</p>
<p>capital of Ecuador is that is Quito</p>
<p>right yeah Wow what do you think I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s Q uit oh yeah yeah</p>
