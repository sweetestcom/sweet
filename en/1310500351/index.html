    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Malice.</p>
<p>This is a special holiday episode,</p>
<p>and it is made extra special</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s announcing the release</p>
<p>of Michael&rsquo;s new book called The White Pill,</p>
<p>A Tale of Good and Evil.</p>
<p>Michael and I disagree on a lot of ideas</p>
<p>in politics and philosophy,</p>
<p>and we have a lot of fun disagreeing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no question that he has a deep love for humanity</p>
<p>and puts his heart and soul into his work,</p>
<p>especially into this heart-wrenching, deeply personal book.</p>
<p>So I ask that you support him</p>
<p>by buying it at whitepillbook.com.</p>
<p>That should hopefully forward to the Amazon page.</p>
<p>As always, we each dressed up in a ridiculous outfit</p>
<p>without coordinating for the chaos</p>
<p>that makes life so damn interesting.</p>
<p>This episode is full of humor, darkness, and love,</p>
<p>which is the best way to celebrate the holidays.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias</p>
<p>for delicious macadamia-based snacks,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for biological monitoring,</p>
<p>NetSuite for business management,</p>
<p>and SimpliSafe for home security.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make them interesting, but if you must skip,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a new sponsor,</p>
<p>a delicious sponsor, House of Macadamias,</p>
<p>a company that ships delicious, high-quality,</p>
<p>and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a shipment, what is it, two weeks ago?</p>
<p>Two weeks ago.</p>
<p>And it brought happiness to my heart.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention which episode, perhaps you might know.</p>
<p>But it was a very stressful episode.</p>
<p>I was getting attacked a lot online,</p>
<p>and I was just very stressed.</p>
<p>And I was feeling lonely.</p>
<p>I was feeling, you know, out of it sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes your heart, sometimes your mind</p>
<p>can take you to some low places.</p>
<p>So I was sitting there on the couch,</p>
<p>and I got this shipment.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang, and I came outside,</p>
<p>and it was a mysterious box.</p>
<p>And I brought it in.</p>
<p>Like it was the holidays, but it wasn&rsquo;t the holidays yet.</p>
<p>And I opened it up, and there was like</p>
<p>a variety of delicious snacks.</p>
<p>They were extremely healthy and extremely delicious.</p>
<p>And I partook in the snackage.</p>
<p>And it was glorious.</p>
<p>I immediately felt better.</p>
<p>It just, for many reasons, obviously it&rsquo;s delicious,</p>
<p>but also brought joy to my heart</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s people out there that really care</p>
<p>about crafting, like culinary art.</p>
<p>Essentially crafting out a snack</p>
<p>from really good ingredients</p>
<p>that you could just tell a lot of love went into it.</p>
<p>Nutritionally, there&rsquo;s a lot of nice things I could say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 30% less carbs than almonds.</p>
<p>Let us not debate how I pronounce almonds or almonds.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m horrible with this.</p>
<p>I forget which is the right way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only nut rich in omega-7s.</p>
<p>This is basically the healthiest nut.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a good joke in there.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to houseofmacadamias.com slash lex</p>
<p>to get 20% your first order.</p>
<p>You will not regret it, my friends.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Inside Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>What I want to know is the data</p>
<p>that was coming from my heart and mind</p>
<p>during the partaking of the macadamia snackage.</p>
<p>The great, the glorious happiness.</p>
<p>I wonder how the body communicates happiness.</p>
<p>Short-term, like moment by moment, minute by minute,</p>
<p>hour by hour, day by day, weeks, years.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the progression of human life,</p>
<p>the ups and downs.</p>
<p>There must be signals in there.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really promising direction</p>
<p>to take health advice, to take medical advice,</p>
<p>to collect the full raw set of signals your body provides</p>
<p>to help you determine the different turns to take in life,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s lifestyle or diet changes,</p>
<p>all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s obviously the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m excited about Inside Tracker.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking those early, big leaps into that future.</p>
<p>You can get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to insidetracker.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by NetSuite,</p>
<p>an all-in-one cloud business management system.</p>
<p>They manage everything.</p>
<p>Your financials, human resources, inventory, e-commerce,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re that kind of business,</p>
<p>many business-related details.</p>
<p>They automate the messy, the difficult,</p>
<p>the challenging processes that are required</p>
<p>to run a business.</p>
<p>For me, the idea of running a business is really exciting,</p>
<p>not for all of the things I just mentioned,</p>
<p>but for the idea generation, for the design,</p>
<p>for the engineering, for the mass production,</p>
<p>achieving scale, for all the challenges</p>
<p>of bringing down the cost while bringing up the quality,</p>
<p>all of those trade-offs.</p>
<p>And all the different people involved,</p>
<p>getting to work with them, getting to be inspired by them,</p>
<p>rethinking how things have done in the past,</p>
<p>doing things that are totally new way,</p>
<p>taking huge risks, all that is super exciting.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you do that to help</p>
<p>some aspect of the world.</p>
<p>In my case, the dream is to add a little bit of love</p>
<p>to the world with things that create.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s super exciting to me.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a bunch of messy things</p>
<p>that are required to make all of that happen,</p>
<p>and financials, and human resources, and invention,</p>
<p>all that is extremely important,</p>
<p>so you should use the best tools</p>
<p>for the job of running a business.</p>
<p>Go to netsuite.com slash Lex to access</p>
<p>their one-of-a-kind financing program.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by SimpliSafe,</p>
<p>a home security company designed to be simple and effective.</p>
<p>30-minute setup, and you can customize the system</p>
<p>for your needs.</p>
<p>I think it took me even less than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first layer of physical protection that I have.</p>
<p>Of course, I have other layers.</p>
<p>I take my safety and security extremely seriously.</p>
<p>But for most of us, the basic low-hanging fruit solution</p>
<p>should be a good, easy-to-setup,</p>
<p>easy-to-use security system.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe is the best of the best for that.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have it set up on my place, and I love it.</p>
<p>Go to simplisafe.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to get a free indoor security camera,</p>
<p>plus 20% off your order with interactive monitoring.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to have a nearly infinite number</p>
<p>of cameras in my house so I can do full 3D reconstruction,</p>
<p>and at some point, transfer myself into a virtual world</p>
<p>and not know it like somebody else sets it up.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be living in a virtual world</p>
<p>with the exact same experience as I have</p>
<p>in the physical world, and I wouldn&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be some fascinating experiment.</p>
<p>And in that place, too, there would need to be security,</p>
<p>and it would be a perfect reconstruction</p>
<p>of the SimpliSafe system, but in a virtual world.</p>
<p>That would be incredible.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s simplisafe.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Michael Malice.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Since this is a Christmas special, a holiday special,</p>
<p>have you been a good or a bad boy, Michael, this year?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>One of the people in the book,</p>
<p>Grendel Hicks, his autobiography starts with,</p>
<p>I was a good boy, and he wasn&rsquo;t a very good boy.</p>
<p>On a scale of one to 10?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of what bad things I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, that&rsquo;s not, that was,</p>
<p>that was not a 10.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I would say nine.</p>
<p>Nine?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I try to do the right thing.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be a one or a zero?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m extremely self-critical.</p>
<p>I push the zero.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I reach for the zero.</p>
<p>Well, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>So, this episode is announcing the release</p>
<p>of The White Pill, a book you wrote,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;ve gotten the honor, the privilege,</p>
<p>the pleasure of being one of the first people to read it.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m really, I don&rsquo;t know if nervous is the word,</p>
<p>but you are the first person who has read it</p>
<p>that I am speaking to about it.</p>
<p>My first, my last, my everything.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You say that to all the girls, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>All the fembots.</p>
<p>All the fembots.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was a truly incredible book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a story of evil in the 20th century,</p>
<p>and throughout it, you reveal a thread that gives us hope.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the idea of The White Pill.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s the blue pill and the red pill.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the black pill, which is a kind of deeply cynical,</p>
<p>maybe apathetic, just giving up on the world,</p>
<p>given that you see behind the curtain,</p>
<p>and given that you don&rsquo;t like what you see,</p>
<p>given that there&rsquo;s so much suffering in the world,</p>
<p>you give up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the black pill.</p>
<p>And the white pill, I suppose,</p>
<p>is even though you acknowledge</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s evil in the world, you don&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a fan of this podcast.</p>
<p>You go to whitepillbook.com, it&rsquo;ll go to it.</p>
<p>Whitepillbook.com, and if you don&rsquo;t know how to spell,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably have a link that you can click on.</p>
<p>So, for people who also don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Michael Malice is not just a troll,</p>
<p>not just a hilarious, comedic genius</p>
<p>who hosts his own podcast,</p>
<p>but he is an incredible, brilliant author.</p>
<p>Dear Reader, the unauthorized autobiography, Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a story of North Korea.</p>
<p>The New Right, A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the story of the extremes</p>
<p>of the United States political movements,</p>
<p>and then the anarchist handbook</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking about the ideologies,</p>
<p>the different flavors of ideologies of anarchism.</p>
<p>But on top of that, you&rsquo;re now going in,</p>
<p>going into the darkest aspects of the 20th century</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union and the communism with the white pill.</p>
<p>So, let me ask you, let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, as you write,</p>
<p>the terms socialist, communist, and anarchist</p>
<p>were used somewhat loosely and interchangeably</p>
<p>because the prophesied Marxist society</p>
<p>was one in which the state had famously withered away.</p>
<p>There was a great disagreement</p>
<p>about what a socialist system would look like in practice,</p>
<p>but two things were clear.</p>
<p>First, that socialism was both inevitable and scientific,</p>
<p>the way of the future,</p>
<p>and second, that the capitalist ruling class</p>
<p>were not going down without a fight.</p>
<p>So, what are the key points of disagreement</p>
<p>between the socialists, the anarchists, the communists</p>
<p>along that, at that time?</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>at the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>the possibility of the century laid before us</p>
<p>that eventually led to the first and the second World War.</p>
<p>The idea when the Industrial Revolution came,</p>
<p>and Marx was very much a product</p>
<p>of Industrial Revolutionary thinking,</p>
<p>was, okay, now that we have technology,</p>
<p>now that we have science,</p>
<p>we can scientifically manage society.</p>
<p>We saw this very much with Woodrow Wilson</p>
<p>and this kind of idea of progressivism</p>
<p>that we could use technology and kind of not capitalism.</p>
<p>In their view, unfettered capitalism was wasteful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making too much stuff.</p>
<p>You have surpluses, you have shortages.</p>
<p>If we produce just exactly what we need</p>
<p>and you have these people, engineers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re engineering society, then everyone will be happy</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t have to have any suffering or waste.</p>
<p>So, socialism at that time was used as a broad umbrella.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not used in the term that it means today</p>
<p>of necessarily state socialism.</p>
<p>It just meant the idea</p>
<p>of having society scientifically run.</p>
<p>So, you had a huge argument.</p>
<p>There are different wings.</p>
<p>You even had it from the beginning</p>
<p>with Marx versus Bakunin,</p>
<p>because Marx was for, obviously, state socialism,</p>
<p>the absolute state running everything.</p>
<p>Although, even with Marx and Engels,</p>
<p>it was a means to an end.</p>
<p>After man is remade in his very nature,</p>
<p>then the state withers away and everyone&rsquo;s equal</p>
<p>and you have this kind of heaven on earth situation.</p>
<p>Bakunin was the opposite.</p>
<p>He regarded the state as inherently immoral</p>
<p>and wanted to have kind of like workers&rsquo; collectives</p>
<p>and things like that and ultra-localized control.</p>
<p>So, the end was always stateless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that some people viewed the state</p>
<p>as a convenient, effective intermediate state.</p>
<p>Intermediate process.</p>
<p>Well, I think, at least Marx and Bakunin,</p>
<p>there were plenty of others who just regarded it,</p>
<p>you know, have state owners,</p>
<p>have the workers control the production via the state.</p>
<p>By the way, how does my hat look?</p>
<p>It looks great.</p>
<p>Festive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>Is this side better than the other side?</p>
<p>I think you want it on this side so people can see you.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I want it, you know, like when you have like hair</p>
<p>Peek-a-boo hair, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Veronica Lake, I think, was her name.</p>
<p>And then I just glance flirtatiously</p>
<p>towards the camera sometimes.</p>
<p>I gotta, stay, don&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, put on gloves.</p>
<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<p>No glove, no love.</p>
<p>The bad aspect of white gloves is the blood stains them.</p>
<p>So, you have to get new ones every time.</p>
<p>And now I glance flirtatiously after that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, Bakunin and Marx.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>So, there were other socialists who did not regard</p>
<p>this kind of end times where the state</p>
<p>would do it their way at all.</p>
<p>And there were, you know, various strains in between</p>
<p>where, you know, you&rsquo;d have some capitalism</p>
<p>and some socialism.</p>
<p>You know, the concept of a safety net</p>
<p>came out of socialist thinking in the Labor Party,</p>
<p>came out of the Fabian socialists in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Their logo was a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>And then when that was too on the nose,</p>
<p>they changed it to a tortoise,</p>
<p>meaning we&rsquo;re gonna get to socialism slowly</p>
<p>in the sense of either gradualism or boiling a frog.</p>
<p>And also, the big part of this thinking at the time,</p>
<p>this is, again, the late 19th century,</p>
<p>is the idea that there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a worldwide workers&rsquo; revolution.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going to be that, you know, in one country,</p>
<p>you know, it was gonna happen</p>
<p>and then all the other countries would be capitalists.</p>
<p>The idea was, all right, like the workers in Germany</p>
<p>have more in common with the workers in America</p>
<p>than the workers in Germany have</p>
<p>with the capitalists in Germany.</p>
<p>So the idea is, all right, like the working class</p>
<p>all over the world, at one point,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be like, we&rsquo;re being exploited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse and worse for us.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t feed our families.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting injured and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no compensation for this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna overthrow our chains</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna run everything ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the ones running it already anyway.</p>
<p>And, you know, this was a-</p>
<p>Doing all the work.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing all the work,</p>
<p>so why shouldn&rsquo;t we be getting all the benefit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of violence in all of this?</p>
<p>So this was a big source of contention.</p>
<p>So the Fabians, for example, in Britain,</p>
<p>who were all socialists, they were very heavily</p>
<p>of the idea that we can do this through the ballot box.</p>
<p>We can advocate and agitate and get the people</p>
<p>to be voting for their own self-interest</p>
<p>and furthering the state at the expense</p>
<p>of the capitalist class.</p>
<p>Then there were the people who were the hardcore anarchists</p>
<p>who were like, if voting changed anything,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t let us do it.</p>
<p>And the only way to have a revolution</p>
<p>is to have a revolution, to kill, to overthrow,</p>
<p>to seize these factories, and this was a big argument.</p>
<p>And it also fed into the idea of where does free speech end?</p>
<p>Is it legal to be giving speeches,</p>
<p>advocating for violence and revolution?</p>
<p>Is it legal?</p>
<p>Johan Most, who I discuss in the book</p>
<p>and in the Anarchist Handbook,</p>
<p>he published a book in the 1800s</p>
<p>about how to build dynamite and how to build bombs.</p>
<p>And this is a big free speech concern at the time</p>
<p>because now anyone in their own house can make a bomb</p>
<p>and kill lots of people.</p>
<p>And this is something that was happening</p>
<p>with enormous frequency at the time.</p>
<p>And people tend to think,</p>
<p>because we have these kind of prejudices,</p>
<p>or we only remember what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>but this was, I mean, World War II,</p>
<p>excuse me, World War I got started</p>
<p>with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.</p>
<p>There were lots of people,</p>
<p>McKinley&rsquo;s another one who I discuss</p>
<p>in the book, his assassination.</p>
<p>There was lots of violence happening very regularly.</p>
<p>And with the creation of dynamite,</p>
<p>it kind of exponentially became more dangerous</p>
<p>and threatening.</p>
<p>Even now on Wall Street, there was a bomb that went off,</p>
<p>I think in the 1920s.</p>
<p>And the shards of shrapnel are still</p>
<p>in the J.P. Morgan building, I believe.</p>
<p>Do you ever think, if you were alive during that time,</p>
<p>what you would be doing?</p>
<p>You think of yourself as an anarchist?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Would you be, where would you be?</p>
<p>Would you be a socialist, a communist?</p>
<p>Which parties would you attend, figuratively and literally?</p>
<p>Well, the thing that was so interesting back then</p>
<p>is there was a woman named Mabel Dodge Lujan,</p>
<p>and she ended her days in Taos, New Mexico.</p>
<p>She founded an artist colony.</p>
<p>And she had an apartment on 9th Street</p>
<p>and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, a shuttle salon.</p>
<p>And everyone got together and talked.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have Emma Goldman, who was an anarchist,</p>
<p>Margaret Sanger, who invented Planned Parenthood</p>
<p>and advocated for birth control.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have the people from the Wobblies,</p>
<p>the hardcore labor unions.</p>
<p>And everyone kind of, Ed Sheeran Mencken didn&rsquo;t attend,</p>
<p>but he was friends with them all.</p>
<p>So there was this very weird,</p>
<p>with the birth of modernism in art</p>
<p>and in kind of modernist thinking,</p>
<p>there was this idea of like, all right,</p>
<p>like this was the first time</p>
<p>where you could be intellectual as a class,</p>
<p>where there really was this space</p>
<p>for people who are thinkers.</p>
<p>And they just sat around being like, all right,</p>
<p>like what are we gonna do with ourselves?</p>
<p>And you had it in modern art, you had it in literature,</p>
<p>you had it in politics.</p>
<p>So it was a very exciting time where people were like,</p>
<p>all right, like everything is now on the table.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do with this?</p>
<p>And they very much were aware that this was a break</p>
<p>with the pre-industrial revolution</p>
<p>kind of farmer labor era.</p>
<p>Do you see, do you think for you,</p>
<p>violence would be compelling?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m just too small.</p>
<p>But second, I just-</p>
<p>Dynamite doesn&rsquo;t care about your size.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, retribution does.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but to me, violence is the kind of thing</p>
<p>where you think you&rsquo;re running it, but it&rsquo;s running you.</p>
<p>Once you cross that line, violence sings its own song.</p>
<p>So whenever I hear even contemporary times</p>
<p>where people are advocating for violent actions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, when you start a fire,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like, I&rsquo;m just gonna burn down this house.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many cases over and over</p>
<p>of people who are building bombs</p>
<p>or trying to assassinate someone or things like that.</p>
<p>And it ended up literally, literally, literally</p>
<p>blowing up in their own face.</p>
<p>And violence doesn&rsquo;t really work necessarily</p>
<p>because if you have an assassination,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not assassinating the presidency.</p>
<p>If you take out a president,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another president instantly there.</p>
<p>So what have you accomplished?</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s husband, dad is gone.</p>
<p>You replace them with someone who now is in a position</p>
<p>to crack down and retaliate with even more violence.</p>
<p>So the calculus for me isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Would I be advocating for then?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be able to have the space</p>
<p>to be, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have the space</p>
<p>to be a podcaster or like a media personality.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really a thing.</p>
<p>To some extent, it was in the 1920s</p>
<p>with the Algonquin Roundtable</p>
<p>and all the people from the New Yorker magazine.</p>
<p>But they were all drunks.</p>
<p>It was very much a weird kind of situation to be a thinker.</p>
<p>What would you think you would do?</p>
<p>Work at a carnival?</p>
<p>You look good in lipstick, so.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I look good in anything.</p>
<p>What would I, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not building robots.</p>
<p>I mean, you could have been a Tesla, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean a car.</p>
<p>I meant the person.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you for explaining the witty comments to me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t witty at all,</p>
<p>because you wouldn&rsquo;t be an Einstein</p>
<p>because he was an immigrant.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t work with an immigrant?</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>No, you would have been a Tesla-like figure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already a Tesla,</p>
<p>so you wouldn&rsquo;t literally be Tesla.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you said a Tesla.</p>
<p>Oh, a Tesla.</p>
<p>Okay, so, all right, thank you for the explanation.</p>
<p>See, Michael doesn&rsquo;t only make funny things.</p>
<p>He also explains them for you.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t funny.</p>
<p>Mansplains them.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t funny at all.</p>
<p>That I agree with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so yes, when you achieve.</p>
<p>See, this is why Kanye didn&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m downgrading you from a nine down to an eight.</p>
<p>And if you keep talking like this,</p>
<p>a five is a real possibility.</p>
<p>All right, so the kind of vacuum that&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>with violence is usually filled with a harsher figure.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think violent revolution</p>
<p>ultimately leads to positive progress in the short term?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes it does.</p>
<p>The American Revolution, I think, was a positive example.</p>
<p>And overthrowing the czar, which was done peacefully,</p>
<p>was a positive example.</p>
<p>But again, when violence happens, people get scared,</p>
<p>and they want the violence stopped immediately.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a call for authoritarianism.</p>
<p>And you see it time and time again.</p>
<p>And they also want retribution.</p>
<p>They were like, bring this back to normal.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really worry about things</p>
<p>like civil liberties or things like that.</p>
<p>And then it also creates this space</p>
<p>for invasion from foreign sources or demagogues.</p>
<p>Like, oh, look, they&rsquo;re killing us in the streets.</p>
<p>Now you gotta support me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very deadly game, obviously.</p>
<p>I remember somebody told me that, I forget where it was,</p>
<p>but they told me that from the very beginning</p>
<p>it was obvious that communism is an evil system,</p>
<p>or a system that leads to evil.</p>
<p>And to me, at least, that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>if I had to put myself in the beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p>or at the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally not obvious.</p>
<p>They are trying to elevate humanity.</p>
<p>The basic worth of a human being,</p>
<p>of a hardworking human being, of the working class,</p>
<p>of the people that are doing the work and are striving</p>
<p>and just really trying to build up society</p>
<p>with their own hands, it just seems like a beautiful ideal.</p>
<p>So I guess the question is,</p>
<p>can you see yourself believing in that,</p>
<p>in the ideas of socialism and communism?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say if you were living in Russia.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, easily.</p>
<p>So first of all, I don&rsquo;t think anything</p>
<p>is obvious in politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious that humans have rights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious that liberty is better</p>
<p>or the markets either.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re for a welfare state</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re for more free markets,</p>
<p>neither of those is obvious.</p>
<p>Both of them involve an enormous amount of thought</p>
<p>and background information.</p>
<p>So when someone says something is obvious in politics,</p>
<p>they really mean something is apparent.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not apparent on its face</p>
<p>that if we all get together</p>
<p>and promote a society based on equality</p>
<p>and we all chip in,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna really be good for everyone.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me is the promise of communism.</p>
<p>And it was also very appealing to many people</p>
<p>because it was new.</p>
<p>So the idea was, all right, we&rsquo;ve tried it these other ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these negative consequences.</p>
<p>You have all these slums.</p>
<p>You have people getting fired</p>
<p>and then they have no recourse.</p>
<p>You have women with 10 kids</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t feed their kids.</p>
<p>You have infant mortality.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have sanitation.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have food.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s illiterate and uneducated.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying, look,</p>
<p>if we all chip in together, everyone will have clothes.</p>
<p>Everyone will have food.</p>
<p>Everyone will be educated.</p>
<p>Everyone will do their part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be rough in the short period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very compelling case to be made for communism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy in many ways</p>
<p>when something hasn&rsquo;t been tried</p>
<p>to make it sound compelling</p>
<p>because you just talk about how great it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>And then no one,</p>
<p>people are always arguing about Venezuela and Sweden,</p>
<p>like, oh, you want democratic socialism to be like Sweden.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to be like Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Venezuelans didn&rsquo;t vote for Venezuela.</p>
<p>They voted for Sweden.</p>
<p>They ended up with Venezuela.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think,</p>
<p>and the thing with communism, especially at that era,</p>
<p>it was very much correlated</p>
<p>with people who are too smart for their own good</p>
<p>because they had the idea that if we&rsquo;re just put in charge,</p>
<p>instead of these business people</p>
<p>or these heirs to great estates,</p>
<p>if the people who are smart and get it, like us,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean you and me,</p>
<p>like the people at the time who were advocating for it,</p>
<p>once we&rsquo;re in charge, since we&rsquo;re good people</p>
<p>and we want what&rsquo;s best for everyone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make sure everyone&rsquo;s taken care of.</p>
<p>And they always talked about how much they cared</p>
<p>about the little guy.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sure some of them meant it a lot.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, look,</p>
<p>if the guy in charge is very much concerned</p>
<p>with the little guy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna slip between the cracks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just gonna be absolutely great.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the capitalist class</p>
<p>just basically exploiting people</p>
<p>and having these huge estates</p>
<p>while these people can&rsquo;t even feed their own families.</p>
<p>Since we have a little bit of momentum,</p>
<p>can you steal me on the case for socialism?</p>
<p>At that time and even today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a rhyme</p>
<p>and a similarity to socialism as implemented at that time</p>
<p>and what could possibly be implemented today,</p>
<p>but maybe you can dance between the two.</p>
<p>The steel man argument for socialism is</p>
<p>if you have everything up to private industry,</p>
<p>you do not have a guarantee</p>
<p>that someone won&rsquo;t fall between the cracks.</p>
<p>And the other concern is in any other context,</p>
<p>if someone is let&rsquo;s suppose mentally ill, right?</p>
<p>Through no fault of their own</p>
<p>and they are, or someone&rsquo;s handicapped,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t feed themselves</p>
<p>or mentally disabled or something like that.</p>
<p>If you have everything up to charity,</p>
<p>some, if you see this with a endangered species, right?</p>
<p>The species that are cute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to raise money for them or protect them.</p>
<p>Some weird kind of frog somewhere that no one cares about,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t raise money for it.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s interests are to what they find interesting.</p>
<p>So if someone is,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s like not socially appealing in some way,</p>
<p>whatever capacity,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna fall between the cracks and they&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>Under socialism,</p>
<p>if you have a government taking care of everything,</p>
<p>no one is left behind.</p>
<p>You are guaranteed that the lowest of the low</p>
<p>and the worst of the worst are still going to make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not starving the street or just left behind.</p>
<p>So that is a big moral case</p>
<p>to be made for having the state running everything.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, it&rsquo;s a lot harder,</p>
<p>but the argument there would be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not fair,</p>
<p>a term which in my view does not actually have a good</p>
<p>meaning, but it&rsquo;s not fair that</p>
<p>because you were born a Rockefeller</p>
<p>and I was born in Poland that you never have to worry</p>
<p>about food the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Whereas I have to worry about,</p>
<p>you know, paying for a doctor for my kid.</p>
<p>Like you won this lottery when you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>and now I have to be screwed</p>
<p>and I have to respect all your property, why?</p>
<p>So that is another strong argument to be made for socialism.</p>
<p>And the other argument is if you have a media apparatus</p>
<p>that is operated under profit-seeking principles,</p>
<p>it is going to feed into people&rsquo;s worst qualities,</p>
<p>most basic animal-like qualities and sensationalist qualities</p>
<p>and will be used as a mechanism for capitalist control.</p>
<p>Whereas if the government, which represents all of us,</p>
<p>is running things, then everyone will have a right</p>
<p>to have their voice heard and won&rsquo;t be manipulated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument.</p>
<p>What about the reaching towards the stateless version?</p>
<p>Sort of because you espouse the ideas of anarchism,</p>
<p>it kind of has the same conclusion,</p>
<p>which is reaching towards the removal of the state</p>
<p>to where we, I guess, have some distributed reallocation</p>
<p>of resources that are quote-unquote fair.</p>
<p>But the thing is, the Marxist vision</p>
<p>of the state withering away and becoming anarchism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of like the underpants gnomes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Tell me more.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Step one, you have Marxist-</p>
<p>Tell me slowly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>You have full communism.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s running everything, including education.</p>
<p>Step two, question mark.</p>
<p>Step three, anarchism.</p>
<p>So their idea was that after enough time,</p>
<p>the nature of man himself was going to change.</p>
<p>Changed it.</p>
<p>And then the government would be superfluous</p>
<p>because we would all be equal and we would all naturally</p>
<p>or socially, whatever term they would use,</p>
<p>want to act the part that we would need to do.</p>
<p>And in fact, Reagan had a great joke about this</p>
<p>where there were two commissars, I think, in Moscow.</p>
<p>And one of them, they&rsquo;re walking around,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going, is this it?</p>
<p>Is this full?</p>
<p>Have we done it?</p>
<p>Have we reached full communism?</p>
<p>The other goes, oh no, it&rsquo;s gonna get a hell of a lot worse.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the counter argument to that.</p>
<p>Do you think culture, society can change the nature of man?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So no matter, you don&rsquo;t think this idea that,</p>
<p>for example, America has been founded on</p>
<p>and all men are created equal,</p>
<p>that that idea can&rsquo;t permeate the culture</p>
<p>and thereby change how we see each other,</p>
<p>how we think of the basic worth of a human being</p>
<p>and thereby change our nature?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t change, that&rsquo;s epigenetic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that changes the nature of man.</p>
<p>I think, for example, if I say someone,</p>
<p>and which I agree with,</p>
<p>that someone is innocent until proven guilty,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not literally innocent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re regarded in a legal context as innocent,</p>
<p>but that person is or is not a murderer,</p>
<p>a thief, or so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So we can legally and ethically regard everyone as equal,</p>
<p>but as Thomas Sowell pointed out,</p>
<p>a human being isn&rsquo;t even equal to himself</p>
<p>over the course of a day.</p>
<p>Twins who are genetic clones are not equal to one another.</p>
<p>So it is a important thing legally,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a good yardstick, but it&rsquo;s not literally true.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think that law becomes ethics?</p>
<p>So that idea of justice starts to,</p>
<p>we start to internalize it,</p>
<p>that we just, the way we behave,</p>
<p>the way we think about the world?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s a complete red herring</p>
<p>because no one is-</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re a red herring.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>See what I did there?</p>
<p>Seletka.</p>
<p>Because people are still going to always prefer</p>
<p>their family to strangers,</p>
<p>or their in-group to out-group.</p>
<p>So in terms of if you&rsquo;re gonna have equality,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s gonna not matter to you</p>
<p>whether someone is your mom</p>
<p>or someone is someone down the street,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see how that will ever become the case.</p>
<p>Do you think it would be possible</p>
<p>if you were an intellectual</p>
<p>like you are at the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>would you be able to predict the rest of the 20th century?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think at all.</p>
<p>I think there was so many,</p>
<p>out of nowhere turns</p>
<p>that no one would have seen them coming.</p>
<p>And as an example, Lenin seizing power</p>
<p>and making the Bolshevik Revolution a reality</p>
<p>was regarded as utopian and insane.</p>
<p>The fact that he pulled it off is close to miraculous,</p>
<p>and it was quite literally unprecedented.</p>
<p>The fact that, so that&rsquo;s a very big one.</p>
<p>Which aspect of it, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>which aspect was hard to predict,</p>
<p>that a singular figure with just some ideas</p>
<p>would be able to take so much power?</p>
<p>And maintain that power and remake that society</p>
<p>so drastically, so quickly, despite such opposition.</p>
<p>Also, not just a set of temporary protests</p>
<p>by hooligans that lead to turmoil in the short term,</p>
<p>but then stabilizes,</p>
<p>but literally changes the entirety of the society.</p>
<p>Yeah, Ludendorff, who was the German general,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>we gotta get the Russians out of World War I.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get this lunatic Lenin</p>
<p>who already tried and failed to have a revolution in Russia.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s send him back there,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just gonna cause problems to everybody,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be great,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna weaken Russia,</p>
<p>and then our Eastern Front isn&rsquo;t gonna have to be a problem.</p>
<p>And then to his surprise,</p>
<p>and everyone else&rsquo;s, including anarchists</p>
<p>and communists worldwide,</p>
<p>they pulled off this October Revolution.</p>
<p>And then for a while, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>I mean, I think my understanding is even people at the time</p>
<p>in St. Petersburg and in Moscow were like,</p>
<p>what does this even mean, right?</p>
<p>No one took it seriously.</p>
<p>And then very quickly,</p>
<p>you had the Cheka and the secret police</p>
<p>and all these other kind of implementations</p>
<p>of the communist state,</p>
<p>and people are like, oh, they&rsquo;re not messing around.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re like, all right,</p>
<p>this is not gonna last for long.</p>
<p>And the USA, the US and A,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t even recognize the Soviet Union&rsquo;s legitimacy</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>There were no diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>And after a certain point, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t recognize Lenin and Stalin&rsquo;s government,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the government of Russia or the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Is it the Tsar?</p>
<p>You have to recognize it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re not going anywhere.</p>
<p>So that was something that was not,</p>
<p>I think, very predictable.</p>
<p>The Great Depression, in retrospect,</p>
<p>there were certain things that were predictable,</p>
<p>but it was not at all the case</p>
<p>that it needed to last as long as it did in the States</p>
<p>as FDR made it do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all sorts of things.</p>
<p>If they fought Germany&rsquo;s re-militarization</p>
<p>near World War II could have been prevented.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have the Treaty of Versailles,</p>
<p>would you have the hyperinflation?</p>
<p>Would you have Hitler?</p>
<p>These are all, I think, choose your own adventure moments</p>
<p>where things could have gone in other directions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this kind of idea.</p>
<p>This is a very Marxist idea that history is inevitable.</p>
<p>And once you start with certain premises,</p>
<p>the contradictions kind of unfold.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I feel that there&rsquo;s power in the Santa Claus outfit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a fundamentally communist idea, right?</p>
<p>How? Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Arbitrary redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not redistribution.</p>
<p>Well, at least I decide who&rsquo;s good and bad.</p>
<p>Only I, only I know this.</p>
<p>And I mean, I am somehow getting funding</p>
<p>from somewhere, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, I have so much to teach you.</p>
<p>You have a workshop.</p>
<p>Workshop, yeah.</p>
<p>And how many people do you think are employed</p>
<p>in this workshop?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re slaves.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many elves are in the workshop.</p>
<p>I think the rest of you are gonna have to look into it.</p>
<p>No, anyway, and the red colors and everything.</p>
<p>Is that the biggest holiday of all time, Christmas?</p>
<p>Like just in terms of the intensity of the festivities?</p>
<p>No, I think Christmas is a very recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think historically it was not a big deal.</p>
<p>No, I know, historically it has not been,</p>
<p>but in terms of how much it captivates,</p>
<p>how intense it is, I guess from a capitalist perspective,</p>
<p>like how much is going on, how visual it is,</p>
<p>how intense it is, how it grabs a whole population.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because the idea of Christmas</p>
<p>is probably one of the most powerful holiday ideas.</p>
<p>Easter&rsquo;s probably up there.</p>
<p>Easter&rsquo;s obviously up there</p>
<p>because you have Christ dying, his resurrection.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a big one.</p>
<p>But Christmas is this symbol of brotherhood</p>
<p>and kindness and magnanimity.</p>
<p>You know, one of the things I despise about our culture</p>
<p>is this, and something I&rsquo;m fighting very heavily</p>
<p>with this book, or at least attempting to,</p>
<p>is this glorification of cynicism.</p>
<p>This kind of like, oh, you like this song?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cute, it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Whereas Christmas is the one time of year</p>
<p>where you could be happy and joyous and kind</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t get to roll their eyes at you.</p>
<p>They get to stop being too cool for school</p>
<p>and they get to be like, you know, I enjoy your friendship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re my sister, my brother, my dad, my mom, whatever.</p>
<p>And it was Ayn Rand&rsquo;s favorite holiday.</p>
<p>I adore it, especially Christmas in New York.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just this idea of like, even though we&rsquo;re cold</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dark outside, you know, it&rsquo;s still this kind of,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s still cozy and the next,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hope the next year is,</p>
<p>because with Russians, Dnipro Santa comes on New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make this next year an even better one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very much the holiday of hope and joy.</p>
<p>And like love for family, for friends, for friendship.</p>
<p>And kindness and benevolence, yeah.</p>
<p>And like almost the whole, that whole rat race</p>
<p>of chasing material possessions and all that</p>
<p>gets put on hold for a brief moment</p>
<p>and it just all goes quiet.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also about giving people material possessions,</p>
<p>like here, like I value you,</p>
<p>this is something that brings you joy, yeah.</p>
<p>You write in the book, which by the way,</p>
<p>people should go get, buy it right now.</p>
<p>If you support this podcast,</p>
<p>or if you support the ridiculous outfits</p>
<p>that Michael wears, the more books you buy,</p>
<p>the more outfits he is gonna wear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two, my next two appearances in the show,</p>
<p>assuming I don&rsquo;t burn this bridge, I&rsquo;ve got some good ones.</p>
<p>This bridge has been burning for a long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been going across the road by canoe at this point.</p>
<p>Next time we&rsquo;re gonna be swimming.</p>
<p>How the hell are you gonna swim?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re made out of lead.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Sink to the bottom, get dragged across by rope.</p>
<p>Okay, you write in the book,</p>
<p>cynics like to lie and call themselves realists,</p>
<p>hoping for positive outcomes,</p>
<p>can thus be dismissed as being naive or utopian.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on this point,</p>
<p>just like you said right now?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a fundamental characteristic</p>
<p>of our society today or just societies throughout history,</p>
<p>but there is a cynicism.</p>
<p>You write in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>it was a really, there&rsquo;s a deep cynicism.</p>
<p>Well, that was good at the end, yeah.</p>
<p>But there is a cynicism today as well,</p>
<p>at least in like public discourse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why does it happen and how can we fight it?</p>
<p>I think it is easy to be like, eh, everything sucks.</p>
<p>You know, I had my friend Lux,</p>
<p>she was a blogger and she was an author.</p>
<p>She had this great line,</p>
<p>cause you know, we worked in media</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re at a party</p>
<p>and someone starts talking about a new app or website</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know anything about it,</p>
<p>just say, oh, I was on that for a while,</p>
<p>it sucked and that&rsquo;s all you need to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Lux, that&rsquo;s a great line.</p>
<p>But I think it is, and especially I&rsquo;m sure you had to,</p>
<p>you experienced this as well with your family.</p>
<p>I certainly did with mine.</p>
<p>There is this idea, especially in Russian culture,</p>
<p>but in American culture to some extent as well,</p>
<p>where if you have aspirations,</p>
<p>I remember there was this show called Russian Dolls.</p>
<p>It was, oh, I just got it, like the Matryoshka.</p>
<p>Okay, I just got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the name, okay.</p>
<p>The show is called Russian Dolls.</p>
<p>It was about Brighton Beach,</p>
<p>which is the Russian Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be their version of Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>It was on Lifetime and it had no ratings.</p>
<p>And I remember the last four episodes,</p>
<p>they had to burn them.</p>
<p>So they just ran it through like 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. one day.</p>
<p>And there was this one scene where one of the girls,</p>
<p>I forget her name, probably Natalia,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d been in college</p>
<p>and she had been wondering what she wanted to major in.</p>
<p>Right, and this story was so perfect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve told it before.</p>
<p>And she took an aptitude test and she went with her mom</p>
<p>to get like mani-pedis or something.</p>
<p>And she goes, mom, you know, I&rsquo;ve had like 80 majors.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And she goes, I took this aptitude test.</p>
<p>It really made sense to me.</p>
<p>I am gonna go to law school.</p>
<p>I wanna be a lawyer.</p>
<p>This is something I enjoy.</p>
<p>And the first thing out of her mom&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>is how are you gonna pay for it?</p>
<p>And the girl, and I really related,</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t have this Russian upbringing,</p>
<p>you watched it, you would think her reaction</p>
<p>was completely insane.</p>
<p>She just lost it, just screaming.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, people pay for law school all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll figure out a way.</p>
<p>Why is your first reaction to look for a problem?</p>
<p>Why is your first response to be like,</p>
<p>oh, are you sure you&rsquo;ve thought this through?</p>
<p>I have been struggling with one problem for years,</p>
<p>what I wanted to do for a living.</p>
<p>And now like, as soon as I solve</p>
<p>this one big problem of identity,</p>
<p>your first reaction is like, let&rsquo;s find a new problem.</p>
<p>Why is that your, instead of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s figure out how we&rsquo;re gonna pay for it.</p>
<p>And that kind of approach is so deadly</p>
<p>and it gnaws at you.</p>
<p>And I always, I don&rsquo;t like giving people advice</p>
<p>because who the hell am I?</p>
<p>And also if I don&rsquo;t know the context of the problem,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not informed enough to give advice.</p>
<p>But this is piece of advice that I do for comfort giving.</p>
<p>If you are someone who has around you,</p>
<p>people who as soon as you have any accomplishment</p>
<p>or any hope that their first reaction is to be like,</p>
<p>well, what about this?</p>
<p>You have to get rid of them or sit them down,</p>
<p>maybe give them a chance.</p>
<p>Because that is something that is such so demoralizing</p>
<p>and it drains you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, the example I&rsquo;ve used all the time,</p>
<p>all the time, all the time.</p>
<p>I say, if you wanna be an author, right?</p>
<p>You can go to any bookstore</p>
<p>and look at all the shitty, shitty books</p>
<p>like The White Pill.</p>
<p>And you could say to yourself,</p>
<p>I could be the shitty author.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be Hemingway.</p>
<p>So people should buy your book just to know</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t take much.</p>
<p>It really does not take much.</p>
<p>What shitty writing is all about and boring.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could just pick a random period in history</p>
<p>and just write a bunch of crap about it</p>
<p>and put a pretty stamp on the cover and just go.</p>
<p>It was pretty, yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, like for you, right?</p>
<p>Like not, you don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t mean you, Lex, but-</p>
<p>I was raised by the wolves.</p>
<p>The wolf bots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of standard comedians</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t Jerry Seinfeld, right?</p>
<p>If you wanna be a podcaster,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>You could be someone who&rsquo;s got a medium audience</p>
<p>and are enjoying it.</p>
<p>So like the idea that like something has to be,</p>
<p>you have to be a massive superstar or you&rsquo;re a failure</p>
<p>is also ridiculous, but that&rsquo;s cynicism.</p>
<p>I mean, you can even be a failed comedian like Dave Smith.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a generic name</p>
<p>I came up with as an example.</p>
<p>I think he has like a podcast of some kind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, not very funny.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he would call himself a comedian, but you-</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s being ironic.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, so even then you could do something special.</p>
<p>I remember what you did with me in the movie theater.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, oh, you continue.</p>
<p>Can you explain the jokes?</p>
<p>Cause I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not explaining jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wearing lipstick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>Now I remember what you did to me in a movie theater</p>
<p>and you wore lipstick that night too.</p>
<p>Not when I was done.</p>
<p>People for sure will think, this feels like a gay porn,</p>
<p>like a very long intro.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not wearing pants?</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s many reasons why this feels like this</p>
<p>and the outfits and just everything about this.</p>
<p>How would you know?</p>
<p>I am my friend.</p>
<p>I have stories.</p>
<p>I thought I don&rsquo;t have friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all suspiciously named either Lex or Lux</p>
<p>or some variation.</p>
<p>Like you lack complete creativity.</p>
<p>Just like in the writing of your book.</p>
<p>Or Lux, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t even use like a thesaurus</p>
<p>for your book.</p>
<p>The same words over and over and over.</p>
<p>The sad thing about the cynicism is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just a Russian thing.</p>
<p>I think the people.</p>
<p>Let me interrupt you because I didn&rsquo;t finish</p>
<p>what you were saying earlier.</p>
<p>In America, it&rsquo;s not just a Russian thing.</p>
<p>In American culture, if you have like a sitcom</p>
<p>or a musical, it&rsquo;s regarded as less legitimate</p>
<p>than a drama, right?</p>
<p>Like if something&rsquo;s gotta be about someone struggling</p>
<p>or someone suffering,</p>
<p>whereas this is like a joyous, happy story,</p>
<p>like maybe something like Pixar, right?</p>
<p>Like sure, they have conflict</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going for something,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s overall the background the universe is taking in</p>
<p>is very joyous and happy.</p>
<p>That is regarded artistically as less legitimate</p>
<p>than something which is dark</p>
<p>and the background is despair.</p>
<p>And that very subtly sends a very, to me,</p>
<p>pernicious message that what&rsquo;s real is despair</p>
<p>and happiness is the aberration.</p>
<p>And I think if you have that as your mindset,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for maybe not failure,</p>
<p>but certainly not happiness.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s in the figures,</p>
<p>the ideas that the culture elevates.</p>
<p>But at the local personal life of parents and teachers,</p>
<p>that still happens a lot.</p>
<p>In Russia and here, just my whole life,</p>
<p>especially because I&rsquo;m a weirdo,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been kind of told to basically be less weird.</p>
<p>Be, there&rsquo;s a kind of sense in where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain path you&rsquo;re supposed to take in life.</p>
<p>And every time you have a little bit of success</p>
<p>on those very specifically defined paths,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pushed to do more and more and more on those paths,</p>
<p>as opposed to celebrating the full complexity</p>
<p>of the weirdo that each one of us is.</p>
<p>And I certainly am.</p>
<p>And I just, teachers, even friends,</p>
<p>and certainly family have constantly been very cynical</p>
<p>about my aspirations, my dreams, and so on.</p>
<p>I think that actually created</p>
<p>a deeply self-critical engine in my brain</p>
<p>that I think ultimately was productive</p>
<p>because it was also balanced by just an internal,</p>
<p>maybe through genetics, thing I have of optimism</p>
<p>about the world, of just seeing the beauty in the world.</p>
<p>But it is weird looking back how much the,</p>
<p>how much people that love me were trying to bring me down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so strange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very hurtful for me</p>
<p>because when I graduated college,</p>
<p>it was important for me to be self-made</p>
<p>and not take money from my family.</p>
<p>And I remember my grandma, this was a huge argument,</p>
<p>an ongoing argument.</p>
<p>And one time she, as we were leaving,</p>
<p>as she was leaving my house,</p>
<p>she slipped money in under the door and I threw it out.</p>
<p>And it made me so angry.</p>
<p>Or like one year for my birthday,</p>
<p>she gave me, I think like $500,</p>
<p>which was a lot of money when you&rsquo;re like 22 or 23.</p>
<p>And I was so pissed because that told me</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;d be able to feed myself</p>
<p>or make it on my own.</p>
<p>And I understand their mindset, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I wasn&rsquo;t, I was never hungry.</p>
<p>Like maybe I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I remember I&rsquo;d have to wait on the subway</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t afford a cab.</p>
<p>But that was a sacrifice I had to make.</p>
<p>You know, I had to wait that half hour.</p>
<p>So it was a huge source and remains a source</p>
<p>of enormous tension and contention.</p>
<p>And I think also, I&rsquo;m sure speaking to your upbringing,</p>
<p>in their minds, unless you&rsquo;re going into an office,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t pay the rent.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, just like you said,</p>
<p>forget the office, forget all that.</p>
<p>No matter what, there&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>whatever you accomplish in life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always negative about your current position.</p>
<p>You always come up with another problem,</p>
<p>just like you said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, it&rsquo;s like a self-generating problem box.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember I didn&rsquo;t speak to my dad for a few years.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m like, let me give this guy another chance.</p>
<p>And in that time period, Harvey Pekar,</p>
<p>the author of Subject of American Splendor,</p>
<p>the movie and author of the series of comic books,</p>
<p>he and I became friends</p>
<p>and he was writing a graphic novel about me.</p>
<p>And when I met with my dad, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, someone&rsquo;s writing a book about me.</p>
<p>And he goes, I know, so.</p>
<p>And it was one of those moments where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wow, you&rsquo;re an asshole.</p>
<p>And not the kind of asshole I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like not a good person.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, or really at this point care,</p>
<p>what the motivation, or if there was no motivation,</p>
<p>what the visceral emotional reasoning for that.</p>
<p>But that kind of thing is something I,</p>
<p>much later now in life, have absolutely no tolerance for.</p>
<p>Well, in my own private life,</p>
<p>I try to forgive and love those people.</p>
<p>But it is, there&rsquo;ve been a few in my life like this.</p>
<p>And I think they are incredible people</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to see it, but they&rsquo;re flawed.</p>
<p>And so I try to forgive them.</p>
<p>That said, it is true that the people</p>
<p>that are close to you, especially family,</p>
<p>have a disproportionate psychological effect on you.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful</p>
<p>having them in your life too much.</p>
<p>Like one thing is to love them,</p>
<p>and the other is to actually allow yourself to flourish.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people that help you flourish.</p>
<p>And like you said, the advice there is really powerful,</p>
<p>especially early on, to have people that believe in you,</p>
<p>in whatever crazy big dreams you have,</p>
<p>that pat you on the back and say, you got this, kid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so valuable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>If you try and you don&rsquo;t make it to that Rogan level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Like I have several books that I&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>that are on my hard drive that have not been published.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of work,</p>
<p>and it was really disappointing when they went out</p>
<p>and no publishers were interested in it.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll publish them one day, maybe I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Point being, it&rsquo;s fine, I tried.</p>
<p>Is it a romance novel?</p>
<p>One is, one is a-</p>
<p>Gay romance novel?</p>
<p>Does it have a guy in a Santa outfit in it?</p>
<p>Can you please stop asking me to send you gay pornography?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s calling me up all hours of the night.</p>
<p>I need more gay porn.</p>
<p>I need some ones, I only have zeros.</p>
<p>Yeah, never enough.</p>
<p>This one almost got a book deal.</p>
<p>This was, it would have been, it was 16 years ago.</p>
<p>It was a ladlet novel.</p>
<p>What kind of novel?</p>
<p>Ladlet, it&rsquo;s like Nick Hornby.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Nick Hornby, about a boy.</p>
<p>So there was a little mini genre of these books</p>
<p>about young men trying to struggle their way through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole little,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole little series of them.</p>
<p>Fight Club is adjacent to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not literally a ladlet.</p>
<p>I feel like you would write a great Fight Club type novel.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>You know, Fight Club is much,</p>
<p>and Chuck Palahniuk, is my understanding, admitted this.</p>
<p>Fight Club is one of the few things</p>
<p>where the movie is better than the book.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But the movie is so iconic.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>But still, isn&rsquo;t there a deeply philosophical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like David Foster Wallace novels,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t Fight Club capture some moment in time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very kind of-</p>
<p>I was hanging out with Kurt Metzger</p>
<p>a couple weeks ago, comedian, very failed comedian.</p>
<p>Name drop.</p>
<p>Yeah, hey, Kurt.</p>
<p>Watch out.</p>
<p>And he had this great story.</p>
<p>He was hanging out with Patrice O&rsquo;Neill, the late comedian.</p>
<p>Name drop.</p>
<p>One of the great comics of all time.</p>
<p>And Patrice goes,</p>
<p>Kurt was talking about how much he liked the book</p>
<p>or the movie, Fight Club.</p>
<p>And Patrice is like,</p>
<p>that is the whitest book on earth.</p>
<p>He goes, your problem in life</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have enough violence.</p>
<p>Your problem in life, you need someone to beat you up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a problem for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, but still,</p>
<p>it is a very white book,</p>
<p>but it still captures a kind of anger and an angst</p>
<p>and a certain subculture in society.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>That probably led to, in some part,</p>
<p>to the thing you wrote about and then you write.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it was this kind of,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s that line in the movie</p>
<p>where Edward Norton says, I&rsquo;m a 30 year old boy.</p>
<p>This kind of question of what is it,</p>
<p>sorry to be Matt Walsh,</p>
<p>but what does it mean to be a man, right?</p>
<p>What does masculinity mean?</p>
<p>Why are so many men at such a young age feeling so lost?</p>
<p>This idea that like, if I fill my house with nice furniture,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still not going to be fulfilling to anyone.</p>
<p>Matt Walsh is-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from the Daily Wire.</p>
<p>He just did a documentary called What is a Woman?</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who he is.</p>
<p>So Matt Walsh is someone who works for the Daily Wire.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And he just recently did a documentary called</p>
<p>What is a Woman?</p>
<p>I think it was called.</p>
<p>And he went out to lots of people working in gender theory</p>
<p>and all that thing.</p>
<p>And he asked them to define,</p>
<p>and he went to the Maasai in Africa, the tribe,</p>
<p>and to talk to people about transgenderism, non-binary,</p>
<p>which is a word I know you hate.</p>
<p>And the documentary was surprisingly well done.</p>
<p>Is that like a passive aggressive compliment?</p>
<p>Surprisingly well done.</p>
<p>Well, because Matt is very aggressive on Twitter.</p>
<p>We follow each other.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of opportunities in this film</p>
<p>for him to really be like, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And instead, to his credit, he let the people speak.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible it was edited a certain way, of course.</p>
<p>It was obviously edited.</p>
<p>But when he just asked them,</p>
<p>can you just define a woman for me?</p>
<p>And playing dumb, we&rsquo;re not playing dumb,</p>
<p>just saying, what&rsquo;s your opinion?</p>
<p>A lot of the people he was speaking to</p>
<p>were getting extremely agitated.</p>
<p>So it worked in that kind of context as well.</p>
<p>It was not his usual style.</p>
<p>Speaking of which,</p>
<p>do you ever regret your behavior on Twitter?</p>
<p>There were a couple of times, but very rarely.</p>
<p>Can you describe the big strategy</p>
<p>before we dive back into the October revolution?</p>
<p>My strategy-</p>
<p>Do you have a strategy,</p>
<p>or does it come from the heart?</p>
<p>Or does it come from the brain?</p>
<p>It comes from, I want to have fun.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s literally what it comes down to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is-</p>
<p>Girls just wanna have fun.</p>
<p>Are you drunk?</p>
<p>What is in there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very cheeky.</p>
<p>I have the holiday spirit,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not the holidays.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s eggnog in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delirious.</p>
<p>I did not sleep much last night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, which is, I think the second time we talked,</p>
<p>or the third time, the second time,</p>
<p>I stayed up almost all night.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>I keep track of when you come and go.</p>
<p>So my door camera points at your garage,</p>
<p>so I know when you&rsquo;re leaving or coming home.</p>
<p>My camera points at your bedroom from the inside,</p>
<p>but I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you that now.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this,</p>
<p>because this is something that&rsquo;s been bothering me.</p>
<p>There was a chair that you threw out,</p>
<p>and I was looking at my camera,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, let me see when he threw this out.</p>
<p>And then one time you went to the garbage</p>
<p>and you adjusted it to make it stick</p>
<p>out of the garbage even more.</p>
<p>What were you doing there?</p>
<p>Was I, oh, to make sure</p>
<p>that people know there&rsquo;s a chair in there.</p>
<p>Is that really what you, why?</p>
<p>Well, like the garbage person,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;d notice the chair, so they don&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>like, I always think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to get hurt or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Like, they open the thing, it&rsquo;s like, ah, chair.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Okay, it was really odd.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to get rid of a chair.</p>
<p>It was broken.</p>
<p>It was cracked, and I didn&rsquo;t, it was a problem.</p>
<p>Twitter, for me, I, my point is to have fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fun to kind of smack down people</p>
<p>who I regard as bad actors,</p>
<p>and also kind of to promote news that I find interesting</p>
<p>that maybe isn&rsquo;t as prominently part of the culture</p>
<p>as it might otherwise be.</p>
<p>Do you think sometimes you draw too broadly</p>
<p>the category of people that are bad actors,</p>
<p>and then some, thereby sort of adding</p>
<p>to the mockery and the cynicism in the world?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think mockery and cynicism are at all synonymous.</p>
<p>I think cynicism means everyone sucks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone sucks.</p>
<p>I think it is undeniable that a lot of people suck.</p>
<p>What if I told you most people don&rsquo;t suck?</p>
<p>Could you, could you, could you steal me on the case</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t suck?</p>
<p>Sure, I can do it in a cynical way, honestly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quasi-cynical way.</p>
<p>I think most people are neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Most people just kind of go with the flow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amiable.</p>
<p>Human beings are social creatures.</p>
<p>They wanna get along.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna cause problems.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the capacity to be the target of a problem.</p>
<p>So most people, I mean, if people, if most people sucked,</p>
<p>then going anywhere would be an excruciating ordeal, right?</p>
<p>Like literally, like the airport&rsquo;s annoying,</p>
<p>but if most people sucked, it would really be annoying.</p>
<p>You know, going to the supermarket would be really annoying.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think most people suck,</p>
<p>but I do think that in public discourse,</p>
<p>there are lots of people who are dishonest</p>
<p>about their agenda.</p>
<p>For example, if I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I could be a, someone who has,</p>
<p>promoting a certain ideology,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m in the payroll of a candidate,</p>
<p>or, you know, my think tank needs this to happen,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m being paid for something like that.</p>
<p>So that sort of thing, I think, happens all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the line I have in the book, Upton Sinclair.</p>
<p>I forgot how he, he worded exactly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard to convince someone of something</p>
<p>if his payroll depends on him</p>
<p>not being convinced of it, right?</p>
<p>So I think things like that are,</p>
<p>the thing I&rsquo;m really excited about</p>
<p>with what Elon&rsquo;s doing with Twitter,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just ecstatic about this,</p>
<p>is to have the context now.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll have a politician making a claim,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to word it in certain ways.</p>
<p>Like my favorite example is when people are like,</p>
<p>if you look at the years 2002 to 2020,</p>
<p>terrorism in America, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>did anything happen in 2001?</p>
<p>Is there a reason you just coincidentally started in 2002?</p>
<p>Like things like that.</p>
<p>So when people are manipulating things</p>
<p>to force an outcome that they want,</p>
<p>and to promote an idea that they want disingenuously,</p>
<p>to have that underneath that in Twitter now,</p>
<p>where the audience provides context,</p>
<p>I think is something extremely useful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great way to nip propaganda in the bud.</p>
<p>And propaganda pervades</p>
<p>the entire political spectrum, of course.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Twitter</p>
<p>is also the discussion about free speech and so on.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to discuss free speech,</p>
<p>and the freedom of the press</p>
<p>from the context of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the October Revolution, and Lenin.</p>
<p>What was the October Revolution?</p>
<p>Who was Lenin?</p>
<p>What are some interesting aspects of this human being,</p>
<p>and also this moment in history that stand out to you,</p>
<p>that are important to understand?</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing about Lenin</p>
<p>is he was a zealot, and he was a visionary,</p>
<p>and he really kind of meant it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m skipping ahead a little bit,</p>
<p>but Lenin also was someone who was strategic.</p>
<p>So at a certain point,</p>
<p>when they were trying to advance communism</p>
<p>throughout the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and the costs were outweighing the benefits,</p>
<p>he did a strategic retreat.</p>
<p>That did the new economic policy.</p>
<p>You had a rise of kind of these small capitalists coming back.</p>
<p>You could hire people again.</p>
<p>And for the hardcore people</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union, the hardcore communists,</p>
<p>this was a huge betrayal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a step back.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do it because he was some kind of crypto-capitalist.</p>
<p>He did it because he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all right, we know where we gotta get to,</p>
<p>but we have to go at a certain pace,</p>
<p>and we have to adjust as we go along.</p>
<p>So to have someone who is that much of an ideologue,</p>
<p>and that much of a visionary,</p>
<p>but still to have any element of pragmatism to him</p>
<p>is, I think, a very rare combination.</p>
<p>And that pragmatism,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s ultimately where things go wrong?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you sacrifice the ideas.</p>
<p>Pragmatism, in this case, was good</p>
<p>because by taking a step back,</p>
<p>he kind of gave himself some breathing room</p>
<p>to allow the revolution to continue, to win the Civil War.</p>
<p>There was a big moment where Germany,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s lots of funny anecdotes</p>
<p>that I learned while researching this book.</p>
<p>So they were, Germany and Russia,</p>
<p>they were negotiating a ceasefire</p>
<p>because Germany wanted Russia out of the war.</p>
<p>And basically, Germany was like,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;ll let you leave,</p>
<p>but you have to sign this treaty</p>
<p>and basically hand over all this land</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re currently occupying.</p>
<p>It was just parts of Ukraine, parts of Poland.</p>
<p>And Lenin tells Trotsky to stall.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just run the clock because he was of the belief</p>
<p>that now that they&rsquo;ve taken power in Russia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a worldwide workers&rsquo; revolution.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, just stall them.</p>
<p>And he stalled, he stalled.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, Germany&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all right, you&rsquo;re signing this tomorrow or we&rsquo;re invading.</p>
<p>And Trotsky basically said,</p>
<p>yeah, so we&rsquo;re leaving the war,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not signing anything.</p>
<p>And the Germans are like, what?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing, so hey.</p>
<p>And basically, eventually he had to sign the treaty</p>
<p>and cede huge parts of the land.</p>
<p>And a lot of money.</p>
<p>And this was a very precarious moment for him</p>
<p>to maintain control of Russia.</p>
<p>And people were telling him like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost huge amounts of territory.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve blown it.</p>
<p>You should be in jail.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, watch your mouth</p>
<p>because if you look forward to the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be clear which one of us is more likely</p>
<p>to be the one ending up in jail.</p>
<p>And he was absolutely right.</p>
<p>This was Trotsky or Lenin saying?</p>
<p>This was Lenin saying this to Karl Radick.</p>
<p>So who are these figures here?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Trotsky, who&rsquo;s Lenin, who&rsquo;s Stalin?</p>
<p>What are some interesting aspects of all of this?</p>
<p>What sort of just to linger on it,</p>
<p>the personalities, the ideas that were important?</p>
<p>Well, Trotsky came late to Bolshevism.</p>
<p>He was really the brains in many ways</p>
<p>of the October Revolution.</p>
<p>He was an amazing strategist.</p>
<p>He never forgot that he was an amazing strategist,</p>
<p>had a very high opinion of himself.</p>
<p>And by the way, the October Revolution, 1917,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a key moment.</p>
<p>Of course, the Russian Revolution lasted a long time,</p>
<p>but this was a key moment of a phase shift</p>
<p>towards success of the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>Well, that was the moment.</p>
<p>That was like, all right, we are the government now.</p>
<p>And now we have to make it.</p>
<p>You know, like Thomas Jefferson said,</p>
<p>I think it was Thomas Jefferson, no, it&rsquo;s Ben Franklin.</p>
<p>A republic, if you can keep it, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made our own kind of government if we can keep it.</p>
<p>Because that was the big question.</p>
<p>You got an international blockade.</p>
<p>You had the white armies, the czarist forces</p>
<p>who wanted to restore czarism,</p>
<p>or at least the parliament right before Lenin took over.</p>
<p>So this was a big kind of, no one was,</p>
<p>you know, in some ways it was like the 2016 election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, we vote in Trump.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s this gonna look like?</p>
<p>Like no one had any idea</p>
<p>of what a Trump presidency was gonna look like.</p>
<p>All we knew was this guy&rsquo;s on Twitter running his mouth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s insulting people and he&rsquo;s had all these views.</p>
<p>Some are over here, some are over there.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is the Russians hacked both elections.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, it was Putin and the gremlin.</p>
<p>So Trotsky was, you know, Lenin&rsquo;s right-hand man.</p>
<p>And he was, you know, enormous.</p>
<p>And to this day, he remains this kind of figure</p>
<p>who is supposedly a less authoritarian,</p>
<p>anti-Stalinist version of communism</p>
<p>that people can endorse.</p>
<p>And Stalin, of course, was Lenin&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>At first, there was a triumvirate running Russia</p>
<p>as Lenin was recuperating from strokes.</p>
<p>Then very quickly, not very quickly, but gradually,</p>
<p>and then suddenly Stalin became an absolute dictator</p>
<p>and he had a series of purges and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>which solidified his control over the country.</p>
<p>And of course for Stalin, Trotsky later,</p>
<p>but throughout, as you write,</p>
<p>seemed to almost take on a supernatural character</p>
<p>wherein everything that went wrong in the USSR</p>
<p>was due not just to his views,</p>
<p>but to his direct orders from abroad.</p>
<p>And of course, George Orwell brilliantly,</p>
<p>in probably my favorite book of his, which is Animal Farm,</p>
<p>and also in 1984, portrayed Trotsky</p>
<p>as a snowball in Animal Farm,</p>
<p>and Immanuel Goldstein in 1984,</p>
<p>is this embodiment of this evil</p>
<p>that we always have to be fighting.</p>
<p>And you need that in order to hold onto power.</p>
<p>You always have to have that enemy.</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, that&rsquo;s something I talk about</p>
<p>in The White Pill as well.</p>
<p>When things start going wrong,</p>
<p>they always have to have scapegoats, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this Russian anecdote.</p>
<p>You know, what the Russians like to do</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t say things out loud,</p>
<p>but if you make jokes, you can say unspeakable truths.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this one anecdote where there&rsquo;s a Russian leader</p>
<p>and things are going bad.</p>
<p>And he looks in his drawer</p>
<p>and there were two letters from his predecessor.</p>
<p>And he opens the first letter in a panic,</p>
<p>and the letter says, you know, for advice,</p>
<p>and the letter says, blame everything on me.</p>
<p>So he goes out there and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, my predecessor sucked.</p>
<p>He was terrible, blah, blah, it&rsquo;s his fault.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a calamity again.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, crap.</p>
<p>So he goes back at his desk and he reads the second one,</p>
<p>and it says, sit down and write two letters.</p>
<p>So when things start going wrong,</p>
<p>as they constantly did throughout the history</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union or any, you know,</p>
<p>totalitarian authoritarian country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s someone has to be the blame.</p>
<p>Since we know that our ideology is true</p>
<p>and scientifically true,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not working in reality,</p>
<p>given the perfection of the ideology,</p>
<p>someone must be intentionally undermining it</p>
<p>and causing the disconnect between thought and reality.</p>
<p>And in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there was the kulaks at one point,</p>
<p>then it was the wreckers, the doctors.</p>
<p>It was just different.</p>
<p>There was always someone,</p>
<p>and Trotsky was called a fascist</p>
<p>and was accused of plotting with Hitler</p>
<p>and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>And you also write, the problem with communism</p>
<p>is that eventually you&rsquo;ve run out of possible scape boat.</p>
<p>Scape boats.</p>
<p>Scape boats.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve run out of boats.</p>
<p>You do run out of boats.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna carry them?</p>
<p>Eventually you run out of possible scape coats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my second language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this English thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a failed podcaster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a failure.</p>
<p>Eventually you run out of possible scape goats for failure,</p>
<p>at which point acknowledging or even noticing</p>
<p>that something was wrong itself becomes a form of treason.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I saw that in North Korea, right?</p>
<p>Wherever you went in North Korea,</p>
<p>something was wrong.</p>
<p>So if you have four buttons for the elevator,</p>
<p>one will be mismatched.</p>
<p>Every wall had a crack.</p>
<p>Every floor had a stain.</p>
<p>The bathroom would be rusted through</p>
<p>when you wanted to flush the urinal.</p>
<p>But if you are someone who points this out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a troublemaker.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, oh, you&rsquo;re saying something&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re criticizing the operation.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re threatening the person who&rsquo;s in charge</p>
<p>because now they&rsquo;re incompetent</p>
<p>and now that&rsquo;s a big red flag for them.</p>
<p>But second, if you&rsquo;re just going around</p>
<p>saying this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s objectively true,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a troublemaker and you&rsquo;re a counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>So at a certain point, everyone just has to put on blinders</p>
<p>and pretend that everything is fine.</p>
<p>One example I use in the book, an extreme example,</p>
<p>was there was a photography professor</p>
<p>and he pointed out to his class, and he was an older man,</p>
<p>that before the revolution,</p>
<p>the quality of photographic paper was better.</p>
<p>And he was, I think, executed for this heresy.</p>
<p>So yeah, you have to pretend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a book right now</p>
<p>about the Chinese Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>And there was an academic,</p>
<p>I forget his name, Hu Shi, I think.</p>
<p>And he points out that in these countries,</p>
<p>not only do you not have freedom of speech,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have freedom of silence.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just sit there quietly.</p>
<p>You have to say how great things are</p>
<p>and how much you&rsquo;re enjoying and how wonderful they are</p>
<p>instead of just keeping quiet,</p>
<p>because if you keep quiet, that&rsquo;s suspicious.</p>
<p>Yeah, those,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always singing those songs</p>
<p>about how happy they are and how great everything is.</p>
<p>And if everyone else is singing, who are you to not sing?</p>
<p>Yeah, those pictures, especially when,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s Stalin giving speeches</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s applauding, any dictator,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna be the first person</p>
<p>that stops applauding.</p>
<p>Stalin had to have a button, is my understanding,</p>
<p>at a certain point, to tell people to stop applauding,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re, like you said,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the first one to stop clapping,</p>
<p>people are gonna notice.</p>
<p>And why&rsquo;d you stop clapping?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like Stalin?</p>
<p>But just imagine being one of those people clapping.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>They always had a sword over their head,</p>
<p>but they all had a lot of blood on their hands, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very precarious life.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, I mean, 1984 does a good job of this.</p>
<p>What is that, like two minutes of hate</p>
<p>or something like this?</p>
<p>You lose yourself in the hysteria of it, in the hysteria.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some level of which,</p>
<p>at first, you&rsquo;re sacrificing</p>
<p>your basic individualistic ability to think,</p>
<p>but then you get lost in this kind of wave of emotion,</p>
<p>and you give into it, you allow yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mix of fear and then anger,</p>
<p>and then you direct that anger towards Snowball or Trotsky</p>
<p>or whoever the, and like, what is that?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also losing yourself in the crowd.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not just I&rsquo;m angry,</p>
<p>everyone I know, we&rsquo;re all angry together.</p>
<p>So you really are becoming a part</p>
<p>of something bigger than yourself,</p>
<p>and having this kind of communal,</p>
<p>very primal emotional experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the opposite of Christmas, right?</p>
<p>Christmas, we&rsquo;re all together,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s sharing their joy,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s sharing their love.</p>
<p>This is the opposite, literally the opposite.</p>
<p>Like everyone&rsquo;s together sharing their hate</p>
<p>and anger and rage,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re all kind of having a mind meld.</p>
<p>But I wonder what it&rsquo;s like to be an independent thinker</p>
<p>in those moments.</p>
<p>Like, allow yourself to think.</p>
<p>Well, we know, because there were a lot of them,</p>
<p>and they were all punished enormously.</p>
<p>So they can be noticed.</p>
<p>You can notice them.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you even notice it in America.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s a free country,</p>
<p>but when people start asking too many questions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, where are you going with this?</p>
<p>You know, like if you&rsquo;re in an office,</p>
<p>even in a corporate setting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a troublemaker.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, you know, you&rsquo;re making problems for everyone.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you be normal?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you be just like everybody else?</p>
<p>So people do not like having to be made to think,</p>
<p>and they certainly despise having to be made</p>
<p>to justify themselves,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a threat to their status and to their power.</p>
<p>And this applies in totalitarianism,</p>
<p>or applies to, you know, Dunder Mifflin.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re wearing lipstick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Goes to show, you can pull lipstick on a pig.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a snowball.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve just been on a bender.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been rough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been rough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been rough.</p>
<p>I feel kind of,</p>
<p>I feel like I can be myself in this outfit.</p>
<p>Like, I honestly feel like I could just go around</p>
<p>in this outfit and just be weird,</p>
<p>because everyone will accept you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wearing a Santa outfit.</p>
<p>Like, you can say anything in a Santa outfit, right?</p>
<p>Have you seen Bad Santa?</p>
<p>Yeah, my favorite comedy.</p>
<p>Bad Santa, exactly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>My fuck stick.</p>
<p>How did Stalin come to power?</p>
<p>If we return back to those early days,</p>
<p>post the October Revolution,</p>
<p>with Lenin and Trotsky and Stalin,</p>
<p>how did he come to power?</p>
<p>So what Stalin did very cleverly,</p>
<p>Stalin was, you know, he worked the system.</p>
<p>He was, you know, but he was very much in the background.</p>
<p>And what he did better than Trotsky</p>
<p>is he was much more of a politician.</p>
<p>He was a glad hander.</p>
<p>He made friends within the party.</p>
<p>He made people feel respected and appreciated.</p>
<p>And Lenin trusted him.</p>
<p>When, after Lenin&rsquo;s stroke,</p>
<p>Stalin was basically the one who was keeping track of him.</p>
<p>Lenin asked Stalin at one point to kill him,</p>
<p>because after the strokes, he was incapacitated.</p>
<p>Stalin talked him out of it.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Lenin was like,</p>
<p>if I need someone killed, like,</p>
<p>this is who I need to talk to.</p>
<p>You know, Stalin, if you look up photos of him</p>
<p>when he was young, he was a stud.</p>
<p>He was a gangster.</p>
<p>He was a bank robber.</p>
<p>And, you know, he basically worked the system.</p>
<p>And you had the Trotskyites on one hand,</p>
<p>who were much more to the left.</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s big, I would guess, I would call it a heresy,</p>
<p>was he put forth the idea of socialism in one country,</p>
<p>whereas, like, we&rsquo;re just gonna make it work here</p>
<p>in what became the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Trotsky idea, and this is really kind of the Marxist idea,</p>
<p>is that the workers&rsquo; revolution has to be worldwide.</p>
<p>This is just a worldwide kind of new era of humanity,</p>
<p>where Stalin&rsquo;s like, no, no, no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna make it here,</p>
<p>and then later behind what became the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>But this was, sure, this was an ideological division</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>But what happens in totalitarian countries,</p>
<p>it happens in any kind of, like, you know,</p>
<p>when you have intermingling of, like,</p>
<p>religion and government,</p>
<p>things that are, like, ideological disputes,</p>
<p>like the Aryan heresy.</p>
<p>The Aryan heresy in Christianity</p>
<p>is that Christ is subordinate to God the Father, right?</p>
<p>Whereas the contemporary Orthodox version,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one God and three persons, excuse me.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all co-equal aspects of God and heaven.</p>
<p>But that was an excuse to be like, you guys are evil,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the side of the devil, we&rsquo;re gonna kill you.</p>
<p>So these little disputes about ideas</p>
<p>are often a convenient cover</p>
<p>for people to have a power struggle</p>
<p>in the guise of being like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m about wanting to be more powerful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just on the side of the truth, and you&rsquo;re speaking lies,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s dangerous to the revolution</p>
<p>or to the true faith.</p>
<p>So he squeezed, but the thing is,</p>
<p>Trotsky had the seeds of his own defeat,</p>
<p>because per Trotsky, the party is always right.</p>
<p>You cannot be right against the party, right?</p>
<p>So if you have this kind of party structure</p>
<p>and the party is saying you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>as an individual, you are wrong,</p>
<p>because the collective is what makes decisions,</p>
<p>the collective, the workers are who have the knowledge</p>
<p>and the information.</p>
<p>And it is important for you to kind of subordinate</p>
<p>your selfishness, your individualism to this greater good.</p>
<p>So he kind of set himself up in many ways.</p>
<p>Is it clear to you why Trotsky lost that power struggle?</p>
<p>So you just explained that he set himself up,</p>
<p>but you can see how different ideologies</p>
<p>can be used to achieve different ends.</p>
<p>Is there another alternative possible trajectory</p>
<p>where Trotsky could have been the head of the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>It would be very hard, because he was Jewish.</p>
<p>So when they were seizing power,</p>
<p>Trotsky explicitly said, I can&rsquo;t be in charge, I&rsquo;m Jewish.</p>
<p>So the Soviet Union remained extremely anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>One of the reasons so many Jews became communists</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union, because the promise was,</p>
<p>once the communists took over,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna have pogroms anymore.</p>
<p>Pogroms was you had these Jewish ghettos</p>
<p>and under the permission or encouragement of the Tsar,</p>
<p>just gangs of people go through killing, raping,</p>
<p>robbing, stealing, rioting for days</p>
<p>and just a complete massacre.</p>
<p>And the idea is like under communism,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna be equal,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna have this anymore.</p>
<p>They still had it, but to a lesser extent,</p>
<p>but since Trotsky was Jewish,</p>
<p>his real name is Lev Bronstein,</p>
<p>it was almost impossible to have a scenario</p>
<p>where he was going to be in charge.</p>
<p>And Stalin fed into that to some extent.</p>
<p>Also this kind of idea of Jewish internationalism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, he doesn&rsquo;t really have loyalty to Russia.</p>
<p>And many of the people who were Jewish</p>
<p>who were high up in Stalin&rsquo;s government administration,</p>
<p>they very much had to prove their loyalty to communism</p>
<p>as opposed to Judaism.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20th century,</p>
<p>what was the relationship between communism</p>
<p>and Jews in the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>In terms of anti-Semitism,</p>
<p>the ups and downs of anti-Semitism,</p>
<p>it seems like it lessened,</p>
<p>it was lesser and greater in different parts</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing where if something was bad,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this Russian rhyme,</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p>–µ—Å–ª–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç –≤–æ–¥—ã –≤ –∫—Ä—ã–Ω–µ, –∫—Ç–æ –µ–µ –≤—ã–ø–∏–ª –∂–µ —Ç—ã?</p>
<p>Like, if there&rsquo;s no water in the sink,</p>
<p>who drank it?</p>
<p>All the Jews.</p>
<p>So if something goes wrong,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a convenient historical scapegoat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Jews&rsquo; fault.</p>
<p>So this is something that&rsquo;s towards the end of his life</p>
<p>very much, and this was after World War II,</p>
<p>Stalin was getting ready</p>
<p>for another kind of series of programs.</p>
<p>All these Jews were getting kicked out of their jobs,</p>
<p>Jewish doctors were getting sent to the Far East</p>
<p>instead of being in cities.</p>
<p>The newspapers started talking about rootless cosmopolitans,</p>
<p>which was a term the Nazis also used</p>
<p>to kind of regard Jews as others or as aliens.</p>
<p>And this was going to be,</p>
<p>and they were very clever about it.</p>
<p>In Pravda, and I talk about this in the White Pill,</p>
<p>in Pravda, there were articles, letters to the editor,</p>
<p>they were like, you know,</p>
<p>things are getting so anti-Semitic,</p>
<p>we really should round up all the Jews</p>
<p>and send them elsewhere for their own safety.</p>
<p>So they were kind of setting the ground rules</p>
<p>or the basis to have this sort of program come back,</p>
<p>but spoiler alert, Stalin dies,</p>
<p>and immediately all of this gets reversed,</p>
<p>and the new administration rehabilitates the doctors</p>
<p>who were accused of trying to hurt him</p>
<p>and all this other sort of thing.</p>
<p>What is it about the scapegoats in society?</p>
<p>Are we always going to be looking for scapegoats?</p>
<p>What do you learn from human nature</p>
<p>that this seems to keep happening?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a book called The Nurture Assumption,</p>
<p>and I discuss this in The New Right.</p>
<p>And what the author learned</p>
<p>is that humans define themselves by opposition.</p>
<p>So if you have a group of people and it&rsquo;s kids and adults,</p>
<p>the kids will see themselves as kids</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re as opposed to adults.</p>
<p>If the adults leave,</p>
<p>the kids see themselves as boys and girls,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a girl, I&rsquo;m a boy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a boy, I&rsquo;m a girl.</p>
<p>So they divide.</p>
<p>So this idea, which is a very lefty idea,</p>
<p>that human beings naturally all get along is not accurate.</p>
<p>And the best example of this is look after 9-11,</p>
<p>look where there&rsquo;s a war.</p>
<p>Nothing unites a popular,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like when times are thriving</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s all working together.</p>
<p>When things are bad and there&rsquo;s an enemy,</p>
<p>the Japanese are Pearl Harbor, it&rsquo;s Al-Qaeda,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when everyone really comes together</p>
<p>because now we have someone to be against.</p>
<p>So there will always be,</p>
<p>someone has to be the out group</p>
<p>and we have to be the in group as opposed to them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a viciousness to the actions you take,</p>
<p>towards the out group that varies throughout history.</p>
<p>Some, like the degree of viciousness can cross the line</p>
<p>towards atrocities, towards genocide.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the question of why does it sometimes do that?</p>
<p>Why does it sometimes cross into genocide?</p>
<p>I understand it&rsquo;s a useful thing</p>
<p>to have the other to blame in this world,</p>
<p>especially when times are rough.</p>
<p>But why does that sometimes lead to sort of action</p>
<p>that says I&rsquo;m going to murder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to torture the other?</p>
<p>I think the question really is why sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And one of the things I learned</p>
<p>when I was doing The New Right</p>
<p>is a lot of the Nazis,</p>
<p>using that term loosely speaking, neo-Nazis,</p>
<p>they make the point that like,</p>
<p>oh, when the Holocaust happened,</p>
<p>it really wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal</p>
<p>and that only became a big deal in the decades later.</p>
<p>And this just shows the power of Jewish influence.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this to me is a great thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thing that we sat down</p>
<p>pretty recently historically,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>guys, when we have a war or we have conquest,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to just start killing everyone.</p>
<p>Like this is something that&rsquo;s bad and wrong.</p>
<p>And certainly in the last 60 years, 70 years,</p>
<p>this is something that people have come to take for granted,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t the case before.</p>
<p>It would always be, or not always,</p>
<p>but often if you conquer,</p>
<p>you just go wild and just start slaughtering</p>
<p>masses of people.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the guy from Harvard?</p>
<p>And he-</p>
<p>Steven Pinker.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker, I&rsquo;m sorry, I forgot his name.</p>
<p>So he just talks about like,</p>
<p>we know this is one of the reasons also why</p>
<p>there was so much skepticism when the Holocaust started,</p>
<p>because this was regarded as something that was barbaric.</p>
<p>This is from the middle ages, from the biblical times.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do this anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re civilized now.</p>
<p>So genocide is historically the norm.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also harder to pull it off emotionally</p>
<p>when you have the visuals and when you have the audio</p>
<p>and when you have the voices of the people being slaughtered.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, if this was 2000 years ago</p>
<p>and people in the Bible,</p>
<p>like go kill this group, go kill that group.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have their names.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the visuals.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>But when you see someone being like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book about, I think the Rwandan genocide.</p>
<p>And the title is,</p>
<p>we regret to inform you that tomorrow</p>
<p>we will be executed with all of our families,</p>
<p>like a telegram.</p>
<p>And like, when you get a telegram like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different than reading some history book</p>
<p>about the Assyrians killed the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know who this is</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know who that is, right?</p>
<p>So I think this is something that has changed very recently.</p>
<p>There was this kind of interesting moment</p>
<p>just that speaks to the way technology</p>
<p>has liberated people from violence.</p>
<p>Kristallnacht, which was a moment</p>
<p>in the lead up to the Holocaust,</p>
<p>where basically, with Hitler&rsquo;s blessing,</p>
<p>you had a nationwide burning of Jewish businesses,</p>
<p>synagogues burnt down.</p>
<p>And Kaiser Wilhelm, the Kaiser,</p>
<p>he said, for the first time in my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m embarrassed to be a German.</p>
<p>But that was a moment where worldwide,</p>
<p>even plenty of people who did not think very highly</p>
<p>of Jewish people were like, this is a wrap.</p>
<p>This is a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>200 years ago, 100 years ago,</p>
<p>maybe not literally a Kristallnacht,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an outgroup and we hate them</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna kill them and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And you think it&rsquo;s even more difficult now</p>
<p>with the internet, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now, more difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>or it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that at all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying that we know a lot</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in North Korea,</p>
<p>probably the most secretive country on earth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of atrocities in Eritrea,</p>
<p>which is kind of known.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s also, like, if you think about it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re how many years ago, 300 years ago,</p>
<p>you only know the people in your village</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all probably gonna look like you,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Whereas now, if I&rsquo;m on social media</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s someone from any country</p>
<p>and maybe their picture looks a little different,</p>
<p>they use the same anime picture as somebody else,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re putting forth their ideas,</p>
<p>you do see the humanity in them.</p>
<p>And you do see a sense of familiarity</p>
<p>and a familial bond with them.</p>
<p>And when you hear about these things,</p>
<p>again, like I did when I did Dear Reader,</p>
<p>no one, I was on Al-Qaeda and I was on Alex Jones,</p>
<p>no one pushed back about like, oh, the North Koreans.</p>
<p>They were all like, this is horrible.</p>
<p>If I had a magic wand, I&rsquo;d give them food.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have them live in fear.</p>
<p>And this is something that I don&rsquo;t think was the case</p>
<p>a couple of hundred years ago.</p>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in Iran, the protests.</p>
<p>It seems like the regime there</p>
<p>is able to crack down on violence.</p>
<p>My thoughts about Iran, let me just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something else about Iran</p>
<p>which I think is interesting.</p>
<p>This whole idea of care for what you wish for.</p>
<p>Because people have this, and something I kind of,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I have the white pill</p>
<p>is Americans really are very naive</p>
<p>about the nature of evil, right?</p>
<p>They really think that a dictator has a weird mustache</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s banging the table and he&rsquo;s like a crazy person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s often not the case.</p>
<p>But they also think if something is bad,</p>
<p>therefore the alternative is gonna be better.</p>
<p>So you had the Shah of Iran and he was kind of authoritarian</p>
<p>and no, he&rsquo;s not a good guy.</p>
<p>So in 1979, there were a lot of people like,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s horrible, he&rsquo;s oppressing the Iranian people,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get him the F out of there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so bad that whatever comes after it</p>
<p>has to be an improvement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s, if you think,</p>
<p>this drives me crazy when conservatives are like,</p>
<p>Joe Biden&rsquo;s the worst president we&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>this is destroying America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you have no idea how bad things can get.</p>
<p>The fact that you are in a position to complain</p>
<p>means we got our ways to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, every time you say that Donald Trump</p>
<p>or Joe Biden is the worst president ever,</p>
<p>that warms my heart because you&rsquo;re allowed to say that.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just let it, it&rsquo;s like music.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re allowed to be pretty,</p>
<p>in response to a president&rsquo;s tweet, you can write that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it still lives there and nobody arrests you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is a rare thing in human history.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And still rare thing in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, it does seem that Iran,</p>
<p>the current regime is able to crack down</p>
<p>on communication channels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s surprising to me</p>
<p>how much power a government can have.</p>
<p>Like they could use violence to control the population.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And nobody&rsquo;s gonna do anything about it.</p>
<p>Well, I just-</p>
<p>The rest of the world just watches.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>Because if the rest of the world starts doing too much,</p>
<p>then they have a justification to crack down even more.</p>
<p>This regime, this protests are not legitimate.</p>
<p>These are, this happened constantly, Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These are foreign provocateurs.</p>
<p>This is meddling in our country.</p>
<p>Curfew, lockdown, mandatory searches, everyone&rsquo;s a spy.</p>
<p>So that narrative is a very convenient one</p>
<p>for people who are authoritarian.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who are Persian,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure you do as well.</p>
<p>Very hardworking, very bright, great people.</p>
<p>And all you could do is hope</p>
<p>for a peaceful liberalization of it.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t realize how liberal Iran used to be.</p>
<p>Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Andy Warhol used to be friends with the Shah.</p>
<p>And if you read his diaries,</p>
<p>he talks about how he knew things</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going well for the Shah</p>
<p>because they had less caviar at the table.</p>
<p>But like this is, he was really kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s I think a poor understanding in America,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure why,</p>
<p>of what these liberal Muslim countries are like.</p>
<p>I gave a talk in Bodrum in Turkey,</p>
<p>which is like a resort town in Turkey.</p>
<p>And I had thought previous to that,</p>
<p>or I had suspected if push comes to shove</p>
<p>and they have to choose people in Turkey</p>
<p>between the West and like Al-Qaeda, not Al-Qaeda,</p>
<p>but like, you know, hardcore Islam,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna choose hardcore Islam.</p>
<p>You go there and you&rsquo;re like, oh, this is like Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Like these people are so liberal.</p>
<p>And they are the first to be killed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the first targets.</p>
<p>So people like that in Iran are who my thoughts are.</p>
<p>And I gotta tell you,</p>
<p>like nothing makes me more of a feminist</p>
<p>than seeing the women in countries like this</p>
<p>fight for the right to education,</p>
<p>the right to dress as they please.</p>
<p>Maybe we don&rsquo;t need them driving, but you know, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>There he is with that characteristic brilliant humor.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re so loved for.</p>
<p>I should probably be banned for on Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my best.</p>
<p>Every time you tweet, I just report, report, report.</p>
<p>Please stop this man.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have like a script to just.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, actually funny enough, I do.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t abuse my power.</p>
<p>I wear the ring like Frodo and I respect the power.</p>
<p>But you look like Gollum.</p>
<p>Huh, that&rsquo;s not what your mom said last night.</p>
<p>She said you&rsquo;re hung like Gollum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going down that road with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not holding hands another time.</p>
<p>I learned my, fool me once.</p>
<p>Okay, my close childhood friend is from Iran.</p>
<p>Oh wow, okay.</p>
<p>And I talk to him a lot.</p>
<p>I wanted to go to Iran.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so far away.</p>
<p>I can see it from my house, my friend.</p>
<p>I would love to take that trip even now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just culturally.</p>
<p>So all the different little pockets of local cultures</p>
<p>that make up Iran.</p>
<p>I just heard so many amazing things.</p>
<p>Yeah, my friend Paul went there.</p>
<p>He had an amazing time.</p>
<p>He just absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>He thought the people were awesome.</p>
<p>It was so interesting, very developed.</p>
<p>Tehran is, the history in Tehran is insane.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would really love to visit.</p>
<p>Now we return back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we ended up in Iran.</p>
<p>But let us stroll back to Stalin taking power.</p>
<p>What role did the suppression of speech,</p>
<p>the censorship, the suppression of the freedom of the press</p>
<p>have in Stalin taking hold, taking power?</p>
<p>In Lenin, in Trotsky, in Stalin having power?</p>
<p>Well, it was a very useful mechanism</p>
<p>to direct public opinion</p>
<p>and inform public perspectives and everything.</p>
<p>So first of all, there was a lot of news</p>
<p>about how great things were.</p>
<p>You have a bumper crop here.</p>
<p>Grains never better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great, there&rsquo;s another anecdote</p>
<p>where President Kalinin is talking about how</p>
<p>on Karl Marx Street in Kharkiv,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of new skyscrapers being built</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>And some of the audience gets up and goes,</p>
<p>comrade, I work on Karl Marx Street.</p>
<p>I walk there every day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of these skyscrapers.</p>
<p>He goes, see, that&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trusting your eyes</p>
<p>instead of reading something and learning</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in the papers.</p>
<p>So there was this kind of disconnect between,</p>
<p>I forget, you probably know the joke,</p>
<p>like pravda-nepravda, izvestia-nezvestia,</p>
<p>like pravda means truth,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no truth to be had in pravda</p>
<p>is like kind of the Russian line.</p>
<p>The point is it very much,</p>
<p>and the other thing, this is,</p>
<p>my mom wasn&rsquo;t particularly politically motivated,</p>
<p>but she talked about how you didn&rsquo;t have to be smart</p>
<p>to realize how dishonest it was</p>
<p>because one day someone is the great hero</p>
<p>of the Soviet people,</p>
<p>and the next week he&rsquo;s been a traitor</p>
<p>and a class enemy and the worst.</p>
<p>And then sometimes they reverted</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>like they couldn&rsquo;t even keep their story straight.</p>
<p>And in fact, at a certain point</p>
<p>when Gorbachev liberalized,</p>
<p>they had to cancel tests</p>
<p>because the history books had to be rewritten so quickly.</p>
<p>So, and the thing that also with these newspapers</p>
<p>is there was a lot of, it was very monotonous</p>
<p>because you had the same message over and over.</p>
<p>A lot of these papers were about</p>
<p>kind of speaking to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Everything overseas bad.</p>
<p>So it very much was about not informing,</p>
<p>but creating a certain perspective in the public at large.</p>
<p>And also you were educated as a citizen</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re supposed to think and say.</p>
<p>So you have, a lot of this was this kind of</p>
<p>private truths, public lies situation.</p>
<p>So you could read the paper and at your factory,</p>
<p>you could be like, oh my God,</p>
<p>this guy, Karl Radek&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>You knew what to talk about</p>
<p>and you knew how to look at it as well.</p>
<p>And then when you get home,</p>
<p>you could just kind of be more honest with family.</p>
<p>But the question is to which degree does this propaganda</p>
<p>and this ideology infiltrate your actual thinking?</p>
<p>You give examples of this like scientists</p>
<p>in infiltrated science.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So basically, Lysenko is the textbook example</p>
<p>of Lysenkoism in biology.</p>
<p>So because Marxism is materialist,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t like the idea that genes pass on</p>
<p>from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>So Lysenkoism kind of was a rejection</p>
<p>of Mendel and that kind of genetics.</p>
<p>And if you reject genes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really going in a bad direction in terms of biology.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union&rsquo;s biological program</p>
<p>became an international laughingstock.</p>
<p>At one point, Lysenko claimed he crossed</p>
<p>a tomato and a potato.</p>
<p>You had things where they said they had nuclear,</p>
<p>which is, wait, we have fission,</p>
<p>but they said they invented fusion or heavy water</p>
<p>or hard water or whatever it was.</p>
<p>Point being, in cultures like this,</p>
<p>your way to achieve status</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t necessarily about your accomplishments,</p>
<p>but about your loyalty to orthodoxy.</p>
<p>So if you were saying things that got to a result</p>
<p>that was congruent with the broader ideology as a whole,</p>
<p>that was much better as a means of furthering yourself</p>
<p>in the arts or in the sciences</p>
<p>than if you had something that was innovative,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re innovative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, how do I fit this in</p>
<p>with the broader ruling ideology?</p>
<p>The problem with totalitarianism,</p>
<p>one of the many problems, is everything,</p>
<p>literally everything has to be perceived</p>
<p>through the lens of ideology.</p>
<p>And that is, there were scientists who were arrested</p>
<p>or at least fired because of their theories</p>
<p>about sunspot developments,</p>
<p>because it was regarded as un-Marxist.</p>
<p>There was an epidemic and all these horses got sick,</p>
<p>and because the vaccine didn&rsquo;t work on the horses,</p>
<p>the bacteriologists were arrested</p>
<p>because they were regarded as wreckers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we gave you a job, you didn&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re undermining the socialist state.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a backward series of incentives,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s designed to maintain at all costs</p>
<p>the ruling ideological superstructure.</p>
<p>But you draw a small distinction between the ideology</p>
<p>and the ideological superstructure and the propaganda.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t those kind of intermixed together?</p>
<p>Well, the ideological&rsquo;s like in the sciences</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s true in genetics or what&rsquo;s true in astronomy,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really percolate out to the masses, right?</p>
<p>So the Pravda is maybe covering this scientist is great</p>
<p>or these discoveries are great,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily the same as day-to-day</p>
<p>or glorifying political leaders.</p>
<p>But the Pravda is a manifestation of the idea</p>
<p>that truth can be conjured up.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It can be constructed and it can be altered quickly,</p>
<p>and then I just, I wonder, so 1984 caricatures that,</p>
<p>I wonder to what degree it really could control</p>
<p>the way you think, like how many people it affected.</p>
<p>I can give you an example, a very easy one.</p>
<p>So again, regarding North Korea,</p>
<p>Kim, the great leader Kim Il-sung,</p>
<p>who was the founder of North Korea,</p>
<p>had a tumor on the back of his neck</p>
<p>and it was too close to the skull, the spinal column,</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t operate on it.</p>
<p>And throughout his life, it got bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And I got mixed messages in my research</p>
<p>about whether North Koreans knew about it</p>
<p>because they always photographed him from this angle.</p>
<p>And I met a refugee and I asked him, like,</p>
<p>did you know that he had this tumor?</p>
<p>She goes, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>When people played him in the movies,</p>
<p>they would, you know, you&rsquo;d make up there.</p>
<p>And she goes, it was an old war injury.</p>
<p>And I go, why would a war injury get bigger</p>
<p>throughout your life?</p>
<p>And she just stood there and she was like, holy,</p>
<p>but she never questioned it,</p>
<p>but it was the kind of thing</p>
<p>where they put the idea in her head</p>
<p>and since there was no reason to question it,</p>
<p>she just kind of went with it her entire life</p>
<p>until I talked to her, Audrey, his name.</p>
<p>Hi, Audrey.</p>
<p>Hi, Audrey.</p>
<p>I wonder what percent of the population is like that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If there is a cost to me questioning Lysenko</p>
<p>as a great scientist and there was no benefit,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t I just go with what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to keep me and my family safe?</p>
<p>But I also mean just the psychological.</p>
<p>There might be a very local psychological cost.</p>
<p>So not a cost you&rsquo;re going to jail,</p>
<p>but a cost like you&rsquo;re gonna kind of ruin the conversation</p>
<p>by bringing it up.</p>
<p>Kind of like, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Debbie Downer, right?</p>
<p>Wah, wah, yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the whole metaphor</p>
<p>of like there&rsquo;s two fish in the river.</p>
<p>One says, man, the water&rsquo;s really great today.</p>
<p>And the other one goes, what&rsquo;s water?</p>
<p>Like a friend of mine, Adriana,</p>
<p>her mom came to the West and they went to a supermarket</p>
<p>and the mom just in front of all the Fanta,</p>
<p>this is just crying.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>She goes, they told us we had more food than you.</p>
<p>And when something is, you can under think this story.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s an enemy of the people and he was just a hero.</p>
<p>He just offended someone, this is bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible psychologically</p>
<p>to think I&rsquo;m living in the Truman Show</p>
<p>and that everything in the media is not just wrong,</p>
<p>but a carefully constructed narrative and a lie.</p>
<p>Like what, they&rsquo;re never gonna tell the truth?</p>
<p>And how are you, you know, like what?</p>
<p>Even if you do understand that,</p>
<p>how would you even read between the lines</p>
<p>to deduce what the truth is?</p>
<p>Yeah, it must&rsquo;ve been a strange experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stories of soldiers,</p>
<p>the Red Army soldiers throughout World War II</p>
<p>as they go to different countries, even Romania.</p>
<p>But in Europe, just to understand</p>
<p>that people live much better than they did,</p>
<p>than the soldiers did back in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of times when they went back,</p>
<p>Stalin had them killed because they saw too much</p>
<p>or sent to the camps.</p>
<p>So just to linger on this idea of free speech.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s constant discussion about free speech</p>
<p>in this modern debate about social media</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on it?</p>
<p>Grounding it, not in some kind of shallow discussion</p>
<p>of free speech we have today,</p>
<p>but more in the context of Pravda</p>
<p>and the suppression of speech in Stalinist Russia.</p>
<p>I hate the term free speech</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s used in many different contexts.</p>
<p>Some I agree with entirely, some I disagree with at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone has something to say</p>
<p>or something to add to the conversation.</p>
<p>And I have my locals community and it used to be,</p>
<p>I think the boilerplate language is,</p>
<p>come support free speech and free discourse.</p>
<p>And I changed that because I don&rsquo;t like that term.</p>
<p>Because people will tell you with some reason</p>
<p>that, oh, if you block me on Twitter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re voiding my free speech.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like that term as a whole.</p>
<p>But one of the points of the white pill</p>
<p>and something I see enormous parallels with today,</p>
<p>if you have one news outlet</p>
<p>or three news outlets with identical ideology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to get to any kind of truth</p>
<p>or any kind of useful information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gonna be pre-filtered for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a baby bird</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eating the mother bird&rsquo;s vomit, right?</p>
<p>But if you have what we have increasingly now</p>
<p>with technology, if you have a world</p>
<p>where everyone has a camera on their phone,</p>
<p>if you have a world where anyone</p>
<p>can put their ideas out there,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re banned from certain outlets,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not literally vanished</p>
<p>like they were in the USSR, that is very healthy.</p>
<p>That is something I&rsquo;m enormously supportive of</p>
<p>because back in the day,</p>
<p>if you only had the TV crews with cameras,</p>
<p>you can only see what they&rsquo;re capturing</p>
<p>and they could edit it.</p>
<p>Whereas now, we saw this recently during COVID, right?</p>
<p>You had these reporters with masks on and they&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>but the cameraman wasn&rsquo;t wearing a mask.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have the people on the street being like,</p>
<p>look, they don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Or as soon as they would start filming,</p>
<p>the guy took the mask off and they&rsquo;d film them.</p>
<p>They go, you are lying.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting this on for some purpose,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re leaving the efficacy of masks or not.</p>
<p>That person clearly does not,</p>
<p>is only putting on for show.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, or crimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people, you know, are anti-police.</p>
<p>They say, okay, the cop said this.</p>
<p>Did he draw the gun in the sky necessarily?</p>
<p>So on and so forth.</p>
<p>It is so much better when everyone has access</p>
<p>to as much of the information as possible</p>
<p>and can make that informed decision themselves.</p>
<p>Now, there certainly is space for informed people</p>
<p>to be like, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t what it looks like.</p>
<p>If you look here, if you look there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cropped here, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s still much more useful</p>
<p>than just having that 20 second clip</p>
<p>that someone has decided to edit for you.</p>
<p>So like truth has a way of,</p>
<p>because everything is so interconnected,</p>
<p>truth, no matter what,</p>
<p>has a way of finding its way to the populace.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a big asymmetry in terms of trust.</p>
<p>So if I tell you a hundred truths and one lie,</p>
<p>that lie is equal, I&rsquo;m screwed.</p>
<p>Because once you catch me in a,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to kill someone every day</p>
<p>to be a murderer, right?</p>
<p>You only have to do it once.</p>
<p>So if you catch me in a brazen lie,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to look at everything I say after that</p>
<p>with an enormous grain of salt.</p>
<p>So that is another big asymmetry in favor of truth.</p>
<p>If someone trusts you,</p>
<p>you have to be honest all the time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to make mistakes.</p>
<p>You can own those mistakes and be like,</p>
<p>hey, this is why I made the mistake.</p>
<p>This is why I said such and such.</p>
<p>Okay, but the flip side of that,</p>
<p>which has been disheartening to me</p>
<p>is that people on the conspiracy side,</p>
<p>conspiracy theory side of things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed how easy it is to just call something a lie.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then that becomes viral.</p>
<p>For some reason, there&rsquo;s a desire for people,</p>
<p>yeah, for anyone who points out</p>
<p>that the emperor&rsquo;s not wearing a clothes,</p>
<p>even when the emperor is fully clothed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what that is,</p>
<p>but that really seems to mess with this truth mechanism.</p>
<p>So when it becomes viral to call people a liar,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re a liar or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you feel like on unstable ground</p>
<p>because to me, that idea of revealing a lie</p>
<p>that somebody told is a really powerful mechanism</p>
<p>to keep people honest.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re like misusing it, crying wolf too much,</p>
<p>well, it seems to break the system.</p>
<p>It makes me nervous because there&rsquo;s also like a-</p>
<p>But just, if someone is a liar,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean literally everything they say is a lie.</p>
<p>No, but what is a lie and what isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I just noticed that there&rsquo;s money to be made</p>
<p>in calling out something as a lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Straight up, the first thing, some traumatic event happened,</p>
<p>give an explanation that&rsquo;s not the mainstream explanation.</p>
<p>No matter what, whether it&rsquo;s true or a lie,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of virality and money to be made in that.</p>
<p>And that makes me nervous</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>It becomes anti-establishment ideas are viral,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re true or not.</p>
<p>Sure, but I think establishment ideas are powerful</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re true or not.</p>
<p>So I think-</p>
<p>On the whole, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, on the whole, it&rsquo;s good to test the power centers,</p>
<p>but it just makes me nervous in our attention economy</p>
<p>that the sexy thing seems to be</p>
<p>the anti-establishment message.</p>
<p>And then it feels like that becomes a drug</p>
<p>where everything, anything the establishment says,</p>
<p>anything institutions say,</p>
<p>anything the mainstream says must be wrong</p>
<p>because it comes from the mainstream.</p>
<p>I have that line that you&rsquo;re supposed to take one red pill,</p>
<p>not the whole bottle.</p>
<p>I am certainly one of those people who is of the idea</p>
<p>that they are dishonest far more often than they&rsquo;re honest.</p>
<p>That said, there are people who are of the belief,</p>
<p>to use an extreme example,</p>
<p>that Trump is still the shadow president.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s gonna be these QAnon mass arrests.</p>
<p>I thought this was something that like the Daily Beast</p>
<p>made up to make fun of MAGA,</p>
<p>but I was just on the phone with my buddy last night</p>
<p>and he was like, no, no, if you go to Truth Central,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like all over there.</p>
<p>And if you disagree with them,</p>
<p>they call you a controlled opposition</p>
<p>or a grifter or so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Is it on 4chan or where?</p>
<p>Truth Central, Trump&rsquo;s social media outlet.</p>
<p>Oh, Truth Central, no, Truth Social.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he forgot the name of it himself,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s why I had to create a joke.</p>
<p>You gotta explain the jokes.</p>
<p>You gotta explain the jokes.</p>
<p>You do like the way Twitter puts that context.</p>
<p>You gotta do the joke and then pause</p>
<p>and like turn to the camera and explain.</p>
<p>And have a laugh track.</p>
<p>Yeah, so people know where the jokes are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s real humor.</p>
<p>So we, and then we just clap.</p>
<p>And then everybody clapped.</p>
<p>I think for the last two years, especially vis-a-vis COVID,</p>
<p>the overwhelming message was the experts</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And if you are questioning this, you&rsquo;re a Vax denier</p>
<p>and you basically should be read out of polite society.</p>
<p>And one obvious counterexample to this was social distancing.</p>
<p>If social distancing was efficacious,</p>
<p>why were there no attempts ever to bring it back, right,</p>
<p>when you had different waves?</p>
<p>And if it wasn&rsquo;t efficacious,</p>
<p>why was it so insistent that we do it,</p>
<p>all do it at the very beginning?</p>
<p>In fact, in many places,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll still see the signs on the floor</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s six feet apart.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an incongruity there.</p>
<p>And I think we are forgetting, as a people,</p>
<p>the intensity with, and understandably to some extent,</p>
<p>if you have this worldwide deadly plague,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s gonna be, go where the leakiest hole is.</p>
<p>So you really got to kind of get everyone on board.</p>
<p>But to the vehemence with which we&rsquo;re told,</p>
<p>we know what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is the way to solve it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re causing mass death.</p>
<p>That I think fed in very heavily</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s enormous sense of skepticism</p>
<p>toward establishment sources.</p>
<p>Speaking of the plague, you opened the book with a-</p>
<p>Yeah, that quote from Camus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strong, strong quote.</p>
<p>Camus brings me to tears.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny, because I reread the myth of Sisyphus,</p>
<p>which I had been recommending to people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this book is not good.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s got, his ethos is my favorite</p>
<p>of all the philosophers.</p>
<p>It sounds like the myth of Sisyphus was a myth.</p>
<p>He says-</p>
<p>Laugh track, cute.</p>
<p>All I maintain is that on this earth,</p>
<p>there are plagues and there are victims.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s up to us, so far as possible,</p>
<p>not to join forces with the plagues.</p>
<p>And why I have that as the introductory quote to the book</p>
<p>is I think morality and ethics</p>
<p>are very, very complicated subjects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of gray areas</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t know which way to choose.</p>
<p>But at a base level,</p>
<p>he has another quote that&rsquo;s ascribed to him.</p>
<p>He never actually said.</p>
<p>But something about, you know,</p>
<p>is the duty of thinking people</p>
<p>not to be on the side of the executioners.</p>
<p>If you are, we should do whatever we can</p>
<p>not to have blood on our hands,</p>
<p>not to be murderers, not to want death.</p>
<p>And that in and of itself is a big pill</p>
<p>for a lot of people to swallow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all brought up, taught that war is a last resort.</p>
<p>And yet when it comes to international affairs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always often a first priority</p>
<p>and people are champing at the bit</p>
<p>to start going in and killing people.</p>
<p>And what war means isn&rsquo;t good guy soldiers</p>
<p>versus bad guy soldiers.</p>
<p>My concern is always with the civilians,</p>
<p>with the kids who become orphans,</p>
<p>with the wives who become widows and things like that.</p>
<p>And then communities which are, you know, ruined forever.</p>
<p>So I love that quote of his.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s, I mean, the book started,</p>
<p>it was going to be a recontextualization of Camus&rsquo; thought.</p>
<p>I was gonna rip off my old buddy, Ryan Holiday,</p>
<p>what he did with the Stoics and do about Camus.</p>
<p>And then when I started rereading Camus,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read more into him than is really there.</p>
<p>And then it went a whole other direction.</p>
<p>So you wanted to do almost</p>
<p>like an existentialist manifesto.</p>
<p>So like, one must imagine Sisyphus happy?</p>
<p>Well, more like Camus for today</p>
<p>and what his philosophy can teach us,</p>
<p>like Ryan did with his many books about the Stoics, yeah.</p>
<p>And it was gonna be called The Point of Tears.</p>
<p>Live to the Point of Tears?</p>
<p>Yes, but the title was gonna be The Point of Tears.</p>
<p>No, I know, but from that line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line, right?</p>
<p>He has so many good lines.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not about how-</p>
<p>Probably shitty in bed though, right?</p>
<p>Well, no, he was a big Lothario.</p>
<p>He was probably pretty good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Lothario mean?</p>
<p>He got around.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What percent of the audience of humans on earth</p>
<p>do you think know the word Lothario?</p>
<p>What percent of them have a computer?</p>
<p>Look it up.</p>
<p>Lothario.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some weird term.</p>
<p>Lothario.</p>
<p>L-O-T-H-A-R-I-O, Lothario.</p>
<p>Lothario.</p>
<p>A man who behaves selfishly in a response</p>
<p>to being in sexual relationships with women,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re seduced by a handsome, in quotes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re seduced by a handsome Lothario</p>
<p>who gains control of their financial affairs.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think, I always thought it was more</p>
<p>as just someone who&rsquo;s like a stud.</p>
<p>Like a player, but no.</p>
<p>Yeah, a player, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a malevolent-</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t realize that, okay.</p>
<p>Well, then he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Selfishly.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s not him.</p>
<p>Irresponsibly, and a man too.</p>
<p>Although Ayn Rand would be proud, selfishly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with selfishly?</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t like that kind of selfishness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s expectative.</p>
<p>A man who behaves selfishly and irresponsibly</p>
<p>in his sexual relationships with women, huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So he was just a player.</p>
<p>Not a, maybe a stud.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was promiscuous particularly.</p>
<p>Nietzsche didn&rsquo;t get, he never got laid, right?</p>
<p>He had syphilis.</p>
<p>He died of syphilis.</p>
<p>Oh, it was from prostitutes.</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>Okay, possibly, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking me like I knew the guy.</p>
<p>I heard it&rsquo;s from,</p>
<p>he never had a deep, loving, fulfilling relationship.</p>
<p>He had a very skewed understanding</p>
<p>on the way he wrote about women.</p>
<p>Although somebody wrote to me and said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a mischaracterization,</p>
<p>that he was actually very respectful of women.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he had that line,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going before a woman, bring a whip.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that him or was that Schopenhauer?</p>
<p>If I were to quote you from your Twitter,</p>
<p>I think I could make a very convincing argument</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sexist, racist, and probably a Nazi.</p>
<p>Well, I do own like some of Hitler&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I got the-</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m a Nuremberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be hung by his own tie.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a tie, it&rsquo;s a noose.</p>
<p>You should have thought about that</p>
<p>when you were saying all those things.</p>
<p>Okay, what do you think of the leak of the Twitter files?</p>
<p>I was so happy that Elon gave the information</p>
<p>to Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss,</p>
<p>who are both, by any metric, lefties,</p>
<p>who are both professional journalists</p>
<p>of longstanding with great resumes.</p>
<p>And overnight now they&rsquo;re doing PR for the world,</p>
<p>which all the way to the party line was.</p>
<p>The fact that you had all these corporate journalists</p>
<p>now having to play catch up</p>
<p>and not having control of the microphone, to me,</p>
<p>was just absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>I think transparency is what brought down</p>
<p>in many aspects of Soviet Union</p>
<p>and what will bring down what negative aspects</p>
<p>of the regime we have here.</p>
<p>When you see the machinations behind the scenes,</p>
<p>and then when you see the rationalizations after the fact,</p>
<p>you realize, oh, these people are not acting in good faith.</p>
<p>The fact that, for example, the New York Post article</p>
<p>about the Hunter Biden laptop</p>
<p>and how the New York Times covered it as well,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t mention any kind of dick pics,</p>
<p>Twitter made it so I couldn&rsquo;t even DM you</p>
<p>the link to the New York Post article,</p>
<p>which was a tool they had previously used only</p>
<p>to prevent child pornography.</p>
<p>So that shows to what extent they were willing</p>
<p>to put their thumb on the scale,</p>
<p>but it also shows that for any layman,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re looking at this,</p>
<p>to realize what you are perceiving as news or information</p>
<p>is very much sculpted, edited, and guided by powerful people</p>
<p>who have a vested interest in maintaining their power.</p>
<p>I think, to me, the important lesson</p>
<p>is this is not a left or right thing.</p>
<p>Oh, not at all.</p>
<p>Power versus powerless, yes.</p>
<p>And also the important lesson there,</p>
<p>I think, at least in the case of Twitter,</p>
<p>in our society, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get there overnight.</p>
<p>You start using those tools a little bit,</p>
<p>a little bit to slow down misinformation,</p>
<p>to just a little bit,</p>
<p>that you start sending emails to each other a little bit,</p>
<p>and it becomes more and more,</p>
<p>you start forming justifications,</p>
<p>you start getting a little more and more comfortable</p>
<p>kind of talking about the stuff.</p>
<p>I think there are several ways to fight that.</p>
<p>One is having hardcore integrity up front,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t even open the door.</p>
<p>But I think, realistically, human nature is what it is,</p>
<p>and so I think the only way is through transparency.</p>
<p>I hate the fact they got politicized.</p>
<p>I really hate that the right have run with it,</p>
<p>like, look, the left is planning the rigged elections,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>To me, it shouldn&rsquo;t be left or right,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be about politics.</p>
<p>That transparency&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Other companies should do the same.</p>
<p>Facebook should do the same.</p>
<p>And in fact, that transparency will protect Facebook.</p>
<p>It will protect Google.</p>
<p>Look, this is our situation, tell us what to do,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do our best.</p>
<p>I remember when I was writing The New Right,</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s line was,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna tell you guys what the metrics are</p>
<p>by which we ban or censor people,</p>
<p>because then bad actors are gonna navigate around them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Just tell people in any establishment</p>
<p>what are the rules for which behavior is permissible.</p>
<p>If I go to a store, if I return the sweater,</p>
<p>is it cash back, no refunds,</p>
<p>or if I get store credit, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So that they were having this place</p>
<p>which was presented as a huge</p>
<p>international space for public discourse,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not telling you ahead of time,</p>
<p>this is what we will tolerate,</p>
<p>this is what we will warn you about,</p>
<p>this is what will kick you out overnight.</p>
<p>That to me was crazy and outrageous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really pleased with to what extent Elon</p>
<p>is being open with their policies.</p>
<p>And what I really wanna commend him about is,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m triggered,</p>
<p>because one of the things that he took over,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, our first priority is getting rid</p>
<p>of child pornography and child exploitation, right?</p>
<p>That was, he&rsquo;s like, racial slurs, homophobic slurs,</p>
<p>anti-Semitic slurs, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Kids getting harmed is number one.</p>
<p>And he fired the old task force</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t doing their job.</p>
<p>Eliza Blue, who you know,</p>
<p>she had been on this for a long time,</p>
<p>but people who were victims of child pornography,</p>
<p>child exploitation, were emailing Twitter being like,</p>
<p>these are my images, get them off.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, too bad, porn is allowed on Twitter.</p>
<p>He starts trying to crack down on it,</p>
<p>this is a very hard problem</p>
<p>because these bad actors have mechanisms</p>
<p>to evade being banned.</p>
<p>They wanna get their,</p>
<p>for lack of a better term, product out there.</p>
<p>Forbes Magazine, who is an agent of the devil,</p>
<p>had a tweet and they tweeted this nine times.</p>
<p>You know, now that Elon&rsquo;s here,</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s child porn nightmare has gotten much worse.</p>
<p>They tweeted this nine times.</p>
<p>I looked up, anyone listening to this can look up,</p>
<p>look at Forbes and do a search.</p>
<p>They never mentioned this problem before.</p>
<p>So now that Elon is doing something about it,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s a problem for you.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a problem, Elon&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the child porn that you guys had a problem with.</p>
<p>And that to me is like, yeah,</p>
<p>I understand that you think that Elon is a bad guy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s upset your apple cart.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a political issue.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a gotcha moment.</p>
<p>This is, all right, here are some tips.</p>
<p>We talked to 10 experts, digital experts,</p>
<p>and here are some techniques, Mr. Musk,</p>
<p>that you might want to take from us free of charge</p>
<p>that will help you solve this.</p>
<p>That would be a great article.</p>
<p>And I just want to use this opportunity</p>
<p>to say quite clearly and strongly</p>
<p>that even though Twitter and other parts of the internet</p>
<p>are interpreting some of my statements</p>
<p>to mean I&rsquo;m right, in this case,</p>
<p>meaning leaning right, right wing,</p>
<p>and in other cases, leaning left, left wing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m apolitical,</p>
<p>or at least I try to be in my thinking.</p>
<p>Take one issue at a time.</p>
<p>I do take an opinion on each issue at a time,</p>
<p>but I hate camps.</p>
<p>I try to avoid political camps in general.</p>
<p>It just, it sucks that promoting transparency in this case</p>
<p>or celebrating transparency</p>
<p>is somehow connected to being right wing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s being made into a supposed euphemism</p>
<p>for being right wing.</p>
<p>It just, it sucks.</p>
<p>It sucks, even though I&rsquo;m wearing a red suit</p>
<p>and this is a very red-themed conversation.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the revolution was the color of blood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna let it sit on that for a second.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned New York Times bestseller list.</p>
<p>You chose to self-publish.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can we just linger on that decision?</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons of self-publishing?</p>
<p>The cons are it is acceptable</p>
<p>in our current business climate or cultural climate</p>
<p>for corporate media outlets</p>
<p>to pretend the book doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So basically, and there&rsquo;s reason for it.</p>
<p>I can make the case to them pretty easily.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s doing it themselves, who is this guy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some crackpot writing crazy stuff</p>
<p>from his basement, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little different, I think, for me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an established author.</p>
<p>C-SPAN gave me an hour on Book TV.</p>
<p>Still a crackpot, but yeah, established.</p>
<p>For Dear Reader, I think I was the first one</p>
<p>to get an hour on Book TV for a book that I did myself.</p>
<p>So there is space for that.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t go through a vetting process</p>
<p>the way a book going through a corporate publisher did.</p>
<p>So those are the minuses.</p>
<p>The pros are I can drop it and publish it immediately.</p>
<p>If you go through a corporate publisher,</p>
<p>you have to wait a year.</p>
<p>You can have the book you want</p>
<p>instead of getting past the editor.</p>
<p>And some editors are very, very good,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum.</p>
<p>Some of them, not so good.</p>
<p>Some are good, some are not so good.</p>
<p>I know the best, the real killers.</p>
<p>All right, there&rsquo;s good people on both sides.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s plenty of good people on both sides.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean the white nationalists</p>
<p>who I condemn totally.</p>
<p>But the thing is, in terms of money,</p>
<p>you get six times as much profit when you self-publish</p>
<p>than when you go through a corporate publisher.</p>
<p>The buck stops here.</p>
<p>In one of my books that I co-authored,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even mention the name,</p>
<p>there is a typo, and they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t fix it for the paperback edition.</p>
<p>Here, since I&rsquo;m going through Amazon,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a typo, I can fix it live, and it updates.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>You can just update it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s very useful.</p>
<p>You do like a Fight Club thing</p>
<p>where you can insert a dick pic in one of the pages?</p>
<p>Okay, why do you keep texting me to send you dick pics?</p>
<p>Talk about North Pole.</p>
<p>Justin, you&rsquo;re, all right, all right.</p>
<p>All right, I get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not the editor.</p>
<p>I get it, North Pole, I get it.</p>
<p>The other advantage, just socially,</p>
<p>is I think people are,</p>
<p>like I found this with the Kickstarter I did for Dear Reader,</p>
<p>people are much more excited to buy it and promote it</p>
<p>and talk about it when they know you&rsquo;re doing it yourself</p>
<p>instead of you&rsquo;re getting a big check</p>
<p>from St. Martin&rsquo;s, HarperCollins, Penguin, whatever.</p>
<p>Are you also trying to use some kind of service</p>
<p>to get it distributed to bookstores,</p>
<p>or are you just going to do Amazon?</p>
<p>No, just Amazon, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably where most sales happen.</p>
<p>The vast majority, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna be in bookstores.</p>
<p>So how difficult is the process of getting it on Amazon?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you a funny story about how Amazon works,</p>
<p>because this was, I always planned for,</p>
<p>because everyone, people&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another piece of advice I will give people.</p>
<p>Your life will be a lot easier if you realize</p>
<p>that the majority of people in every industry</p>
<p>are bad at their jobs.</p>
<p>Like once you have that realization,</p>
<p>everything else makes sense</p>
<p>and your life will be a lot easier, right?</p>
<p>So when I did the Anarchist Handbook,</p>
<p>which was a collection of essays</p>
<p>from various anarchists throughout history,</p>
<p>when I submitted it to Amazon,</p>
<p>there was a lot of copyright issues.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re like, do you have the rights to this essay?</p>
<p>Do you have the rights to this essay?</p>
<p>I had to go back and forth with them a lot</p>
<p>to make sure I had copyright</p>
<p>where everything was public domain.</p>
<p>And the thing is you forward it, you update it,</p>
<p>you give them the information, three days,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another problem, it&rsquo;s not three days, so it&rsquo;s weeks.</p>
<p>The other thing with their CreateSpace program</p>
<p>is the paperback and the ebook, the Kindle,</p>
<p>are approved independently.</p>
<p>So just because it&rsquo;s approved for one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not approved for the other.</p>
<p>After I published Anarchist Handbook</p>
<p>and it was a big success,</p>
<p>they unleashed, enrolled, excuse me,</p>
<p>a hardcover edition program.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh, great, I&rsquo;ll put in hardcover.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, sorry, this is too similar</p>
<p>to Murray Rothbard&rsquo;s Anatomy of State,</p>
<p>which is a pamphlet or short book</p>
<p>that Murray Rothbard wrote.</p>
<p>I go, well, wait, I have the entirety</p>
<p>of Anatomy of State in here.</p>
<p>I have permission from the Mises Institute in writing,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m giving to you, to reprint it.</p>
<p>And you guys already have it been published for a year</p>
<p>as a paperback and ebook.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, too bad, blocked.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not available as a hardcover on Amazon,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Maybe now it&rsquo;s gonna be pulled as paperback and ebook.</p>
<p>So with this book, I was anticipating,</p>
<p>all right, there&rsquo;s gonna be some whatever.</p>
<p>The thing with how it works is you have to upload it</p>
<p>and hit publish, and then you gotta wait for the approval.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, this is gonna be who knows.</p>
<p>I just wanted to get it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>4 a.m., less than 24 hours, I get a notification.</p>
<p>Congratulations, your book&rsquo;s available for sale.</p>
<p>And I have to run downstairs and pull it from publication</p>
<p>because otherwise it was out and I didn&rsquo;t finish editing it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the situation there.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s all in your hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all on you.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think the program is great.</p>
<p>It charts just like any other book.</p>
<p>The quality of the books is great.</p>
<p>I am very happy with, I have no contact with them.</p>
<p>My buddy Tucker Max, he had a company that did this</p>
<p>and they basically helped people</p>
<p>self-publish their own book.</p>
<p>They did Dave Goggins&rsquo; book.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve talked to him, haven&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Or yeah, maybe they emailed me or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And he said, I have done dozens,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of books with them.</p>
<p>I have never been able to get someone on the phone.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on over there,</p>
<p>but guys, if you wanna reach out to me, please call me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Michael at LexFriedman.com.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Friedman is spelled wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you ever have any complaints,</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Please just at me at Twitter about Michael.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why do you think so few established authors self-publish?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>in this modern society to be able to,</p>
<p>when you finish the book,</p>
<p>to publish it within a few days, a few weeks.</p>
<p>I think, I talked to Jordan Peterson about this at length,</p>
<p>and Michaela, his daughter, who I&rsquo;m also good friends with.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s actually named after Gorbachev,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a big hero of this book.</p>
<p>Also a friend?</p>
<p>Michaela, you know, I was in talks to interview Gorbachev,</p>
<p>and then COVID hit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the big regrets of my life.</p>
<p>I think if I met him, I would be on my knees,</p>
<p>literally kissing his feet, crying.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the big points of the White Pill</p>
<p>is there were so many moments</p>
<p>when they were calling him up,</p>
<p>sending the tanks, we want another Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, fuck you.</p>
<p>So when you have anyone who has the capacity</p>
<p>to murder thousands of people</p>
<p>and chooses to withhold that power,</p>
<p>all I could do is applaud.</p>
<p>He resisted the cynicism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wait, so the authors,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t he publish some of the books?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re still in the,</p>
<p>you know how there&rsquo;s this whole idea</p>
<p>of how if you&rsquo;re a movie actor, you don&rsquo;t go on TV,</p>
<p>because that kind of ruins your brand?</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s kind of going away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of shows where the lead</p>
<p>is now like a former movie actor.</p>
<p>And this is kind of like a big thing,</p>
<p>like Matthew McConaughey,</p>
<p>you know, he had a TV show on HBO, I believe.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s this kind of like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear what you said.</p>
<p>I said, all right.</p>
<p>Is it all right?</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey, all right, all right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Look at the context below.</p>
<p>So I think for them,</p>
<p>it might be A, a loss of credibility to some extent,</p>
<p>but B, their agent,</p>
<p>whose job is to sell them and get a big advance,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be encouraged to self-publish,</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s percolated to powerful people yet</p>
<p>how feasible this is,</p>
<p>and how profitable it is,</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;ll still be able to reach their audience.</p>
<p>And I feel if, you know, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if Anarchist Handbook wasn&rsquo;t such a gigantic success,</p>
<p>I would be much more nervous about The White Pill.</p>
<p>But the fact that it was,</p>
<p>and that I saw it from start to finish,</p>
<p>and I know the ins and outs,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m like, what are you guys bringing to the table?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s taking a year of my time,</p>
<p>and introducing edits that I would not otherwise agree with.</p>
<p>I think for some people,</p>
<p>a book is a sort of beacon of reputation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important to not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s somehow not as much reputation</p>
<p>associated with a self-published book,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s successful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then like the,</p>
<p>its success outshines the actual,</p>
<p>however it was published.</p>
<p>I think, I guess David Goggins self-published his book.</p>
<p>Because it used to be you self-published</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t get a book deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an admission of failure.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you would recommend it as something for authors?</p>
<p>No, I would recommend it as something for authors</p>
<p>of a certain stature, for lack of a better term.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>In terms of your resume and your experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to get a crappy advance,</p>
<p>and have a book with St. Martin&rsquo;s that goes nowhere,</p>
<p>than a self-published book that goes nowhere.</p>
<p>So the other thing is you have to make sure</p>
<p>you have enough of an audience</p>
<p>that you can move some copies.</p>
<p>What about OnlyFans?</p>
<p>Would you recommend authors?</p>
<p>How much money do you think you and I could make</p>
<p>if we did like bathtub scenes in OnlyFans?</p>
<p>No, just chilling, just reading.</p>
<p>Like Animal Farm, just like while sitting in the bathtub.</p>
<p>Bestiality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, Snowflake.</p>
<p>Snowball, sorry, Snowball.</p>
<p>Okay, Snowball.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What was his name?</p>
<p>Snowball.</p>
<p>No, the horse.</p>
<p>Boxer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hung like a boxer.</p>
<p>I will work harder.</p>
<p>And that guy, I think about that guy a lot.</p>
<p>Boxer?</p>
<p>Yeah, his motto was I will work harder.</p>
<p>Anything that happens, like the pigs would take advantage</p>
<p>and his response to everything.</p>
<p>He was inspiring to me</p>
<p>because he never gave in to the cynicism.</p>
<p>Right, and they killed him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Spoiler, sorry.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good way to die, never giving in.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of that in this book</p>
<p>about the people who were like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna break me.</p>
<p>Like I am bigger than this.</p>
<p>Did you ever believe in Santa?</p>
<p>I remember the day I woke up on New Year&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and there was a present under my pillow</p>
<p>and it was like, holy shit.</p>
<p>Because Santa Claus left it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>He leaves you a present under your pillow.</p>
<p>Right, so you believed, but what,</p>
<p>I thought the story was gonna be</p>
<p>when you first realized he&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when I realized he wasn&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>but that story was, I did think it was real.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God.</p>
<p>And okay, there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>because I did too.</p>
<p>And I remember, I don&rsquo;t think I can put myself</p>
<p>in the mindset of the kind of person</p>
<p>that believed he was real.</p>
<p>Because what did I think?</p>
<p>What was my worldview that allowed</p>
<p>like a giant person in a red suit to be real?</p>
<p>Although I do remember, I think the first time</p>
<p>that Santa Claus showed up to our,</p>
<p>like lived in this very small apartment.</p>
<p>And when he first showed up to our apartment,</p>
<p>I just remember it because he was really drunk</p>
<p>and smelled.</p>
<p>It was like a party.</p>
<p>It was like a New Year&rsquo;s party or whatever.</p>
<p>So one of the people dressed up as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>I just remember this, wow, this gotten like real fast.</p>
<p>Like I remember like thinking, of course,</p>
<p>of course it would be, like, what was I thinking?</p>
<p>What was I thinking?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be some perfect, like-</p>
<p>Being.</p>
<p>Perfect being, like better than,</p>
<p>like the best of humanity.</p>
<p>He was just a regular dude, kind of fat,</p>
<p>but like not sexy fat.</p>
<p>It was like, not really that jolly and kind of exhausted.</p>
<p>And I really have not showered in a while, but also funny.</p>
<p>I remember, I love telling this story,</p>
<p>how old I was and I must&rsquo;ve been five or six.</p>
<p>And it was just that age where you distinguish</p>
<p>between what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So like Vikings and knights and ninjas are real</p>
<p>and dragons and mermaids and elves are fake.</p>
<p>And I was on the corner of Shore Parkway,</p>
<p>right before the park in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>And around the corner wearing a denim vest</p>
<p>was a little person, a dwarf.</p>
<p>And I saw him and I was like,</p>
<p>all right, back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s real or not anymore</p>
<p>because I just saw a dwarf, so I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And since then, given your relationship with Alex Jones,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve continued the journey</p>
<p>of not knowing what&rsquo;s real or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about the next steps.</p>
<p>After Stalin took power, he started to actually</p>
<p>implementing some of the economic, some of the policies</p>
<p>in this idea of collectivization.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story of that in the 20s leading into the 30s?</p>
<p>What was this idea?</p>
<p>What was the relationship between the regime,</p>
<p>the ideology and the farmers?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s always been, and obviously very much this day,</p>
<p>an enormous amount of enmity, for lack of a better term,</p>
<p>hatred between Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, this is centuries in the making, if not more.</p>
<p>And the Ukraine, or Ukraine now,</p>
<p>but at the time, I&rsquo;m speaking of the region,</p>
<p>is and still is the breadbasket of Europe.</p>
<p>It was very fertile lands.</p>
<p>This is where the food comes from.</p>
<p>And this was a issue also for Lenin,</p>
<p>as I discuss in the book,</p>
<p>because when you had famines there,</p>
<p>you have famines throughout</p>
<p>what later became the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And the problem is, this happened in North Korea as well</p>
<p>in the 90s, when they don&rsquo;t have food,</p>
<p>if you let in foreigners and feed your people,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you as the government are either superfluous</p>
<p>or downright deleterious to their wellbeing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a threat to your power.</p>
<p>So Lenin let in an American organization in the early 20s,</p>
<p>which was actually headed by Herbert Hoover, of all people.</p>
<p>And after a while, Hoover left</p>
<p>because he found that the Bolsheviks</p>
<p>were just taking the grain</p>
<p>that the Americans were giving to feed the people</p>
<p>and selling it for export while the people suffered.</p>
<p>And one of the people who grew up in these starvation times</p>
<p>was a young Mikhail Gorbachev,</p>
<p>where he had, I think it was like a quarter</p>
<p>or a third of his village starved to death</p>
<p>during one of these periodic famines.</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s idea, this was a good mechanism for him</p>
<p>to break the idea of Ukraine being an independent nation</p>
<p>within its own identity.</p>
<p>And he had this kind of liquidation of the kulaks,</p>
<p>very famously, which thankfully is much more discussed now</p>
<p>than it was maybe when you and I were kids.</p>
<p>And a kulak, the real meaning or the literal meaning</p>
<p>is kind of this wealthy landowner, right?</p>
<p>But very quickly, it&rsquo;s kind of like it becomes outgroup.</p>
<p>So there was a big incentive</p>
<p>to call someone you didn&rsquo;t like a kulak</p>
<p>and then good luck to you</p>
<p>because now the eyes of the state are on you</p>
<p>and you have to prove that you didn&rsquo;t hire people,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have four cows</p>
<p>or how many acres or so and so forth.</p>
<p>They took a huge percentage of the population, the kulaks,</p>
<p>and they just deported them.</p>
<p>These are lands that they had for generations</p>
<p>and they just spread them throughout broader Russia.</p>
<p>Many of them never made it and many of them were killed.</p>
<p>This was by design.</p>
<p>And the dark thing about the kulaks, like you said,</p>
<p>when it becomes abused, when it becomes the outgroup,</p>
<p>is the kulak is supposed to be wealthier</p>
<p>than sort of the general farmer peasant.</p>
<p>And so basically, it gives you a mechanism of resentment.</p>
<p>Anybody that&rsquo;s better off must be better off</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a kulak, let&rsquo;s get rid of them.</p>
<p>And it has, just from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>even leaving ethics aside,</p>
<p>it basically completely de-incentivizes productivity.</p>
<p>It wants you to fail because if you succeed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a kulak and you&rsquo;re going to be tortured,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be deported,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be derided, all that.</p>
<p>And also, you&rsquo;re poor because he&rsquo;s rich.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>So while this was going on and food was becoming a problem</p>
<p>because you had poor weather conditions,</p>
<p>there was a campaign about, oh, the reason you&rsquo;re hungry</p>
<p>is because the kulaks are hoarding all the grain.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somewhere else in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>how are you supposed to know any better?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re being told every year,</p>
<p>the crops are bumper crop, bumper crop, bumper crop,</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s no food, there&rsquo;s no bread.</p>
<p>And so, see, we produced all this bread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not getting to you</p>
<p>because the kulaks are hoarding the grain.</p>
<p>So they came in what became known as the Haldimor</p>
<p>and Ann Applebaum, who&rsquo;s a great historian,</p>
<p>who, unfortunately, I disagree with a lot</p>
<p>in contemporary politics,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s done so much great work about the Soviet Union</p>
<p>that I pretty much give her a blank check</p>
<p>on whatever she wants to say nowadays.</p>
<p>She wrote a great book about this called Red Famine.</p>
<p>And these activists descended on these villages like locusts</p>
<p>and their job was to requisition</p>
<p>as much food as possible.</p>
<p>And they would come back at all hours of the night</p>
<p>to make sure you weren&rsquo;t hiding food.</p>
<p>And this is what was so pernicious about it.</p>
<p>Your own body would betray you.</p>
<p>They could look at you and see that you&rsquo;re not losing weight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got those chubby cheeks.</p>
<p>That means you have food and that&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>That is the food of the people.</p>
<p>And if you are keeping food for yourself,</p>
<p>you are stealing from the people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an enemy of the people</p>
<p>and you deserve whatever comes to you.</p>
<p>And it got to a point where they&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have grain to plant for the next harvest.</p>
<p>And what was even sicker is,</p>
<p>one of the big criticisms of communists of the Tsar</p>
<p>was his internal passport system</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t go wherever I want within Russia,</p>
<p>the Russian empire without permission.</p>
<p>Stalin reintroduced this.</p>
<p>So if your village was targeted, you can&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>Now, some people got away.</p>
<p>They tried to get to the cities and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But you get to the city and you&rsquo;re starving.</p>
<p>You have no clothes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a kulak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hungry because of you.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re too lazy to work.</p>
<p>Get the F out of there.</p>
<p>And there were stories, I have them in the white pill</p>
<p>of this like starving teenage girl</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s begging for food.</p>
<p>And the guy knocks, the shopkeep knocks the food</p>
<p>out of her hand and she dies on the spot.</p>
<p>And everyone in that line knew not to give her any food</p>
<p>or any sympathy because she&rsquo;s a kulak sympathizer.</p>
<p>And very quickly, if you&rsquo;re a kulak sympathizer,</p>
<p>all that has to happen is someone has to call,</p>
<p>I think it was the NKVD at the time,</p>
<p>you know, the different names, the Cheka,</p>
<p>the secret police, and they have to be like,</p>
<p>oh, you see whatever her name was, Zhenya?</p>
<p>She was a kulak sympathizer.</p>
<p>We saw a kulak who was trying to shake us down for food</p>
<p>because too lazy to work and she felt so bad for them.</p>
<p>So you might want to check in on Zhenya, so yeah.</p>
<p>But in 32 and 33, Holodomor,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just small injustice here and there.</p>
<p>It was mass starvation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And suffering.</p>
<p>Yes, millions starved to death in the Ukraine alone</p>
<p>and by design.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Anne Applebaum&rsquo;s book, Red Famine,</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s War in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But another excellent book on the topic,</p>
<p>and by the way, thank you for recommending that to me.</p>
<p>Her work&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really, really powerful book</p>
<p>about not just about Holodomor,</p>
<p>but like the context of Ukraine,</p>
<p>basically the history of Ukraine that&rsquo;s relevant for today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To understand, understand the relationship</p>
<p>between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>But another great book is Bloodlands,</p>
<p>Europe Between Hitler and Stalin by Timothy Snyder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think you also recommended that to me</p>
<p>at some point, or maybe not.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m familiar with that, I haven&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>So he does quite a bit of, it&rsquo;s brief,</p>
<p>but extremely well-researched writing</p>
<p>about cannibalism there.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>And that it was not uncommon during the Stalin-imposed</p>
<p>famine in the Soviet Ukraine for parents</p>
<p>to cook and eat their children.</p>
<p>He writes, quote, survival was a moral</p>
<p>as well as a physical struggle.</p>
<p>A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933</p>
<p>that she had not yet become a cannibal,</p>
<p>but was not sure that I shall not be one</p>
<p>by the time my letter reaches you.</p>
<p>In quotes.</p>
<p>The good people died first.</p>
<p>Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died.</p>
<p>Those who gave food to others died.</p>
<p>Those who refused to eat corpses died.</p>
<p>Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.</p>
<p>Parents who resisted cannibalism died</p>
<p>before their children did.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s stories in there about,</p>
<p>yeah, cooking, cooking your children.</p>
<p>The other thing about cannibalism,</p>
<p>about famine in general, that stood out to me,</p>
<p>unlike a lot of atrocities,</p>
<p>is the people that are starving are exhausted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically unable to think.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t even have the energy to protest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange kind of way to kill thinking in the populace.</p>
<p>That, it kind of, I suppose it was obvious,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something fundamental about starvation</p>
<p>where it slowly removes your humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was a scene in the book</p>
<p>where a lot of times people literally go crazy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a scene where a mom</p>
<p>in some nursing, a train station was nursing her kid,</p>
<p>and she was going mad from hunger,</p>
<p>and she just starts beating the crap out of her baby</p>
<p>and kicking it, and then she just reverts to normal</p>
<p>like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, madness, like you lose, yeah, you lose your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the physiological cause of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, I think it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>if someone has dealt with a glycogen depletion,</p>
<p>it affects their mood, things like that.</p>
<p>So taken to an extreme, who knows what happens</p>
<p>when parts of the brain start functioning</p>
<p>and start imploding.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s, what I wanted, what just happened,</p>
<p>this is something that&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>regarding the Holodomor.</p>
<p>So there was one Western journalist, Gareth Jones,</p>
<p>who was like, all right, something&rsquo;s not adding up here.</p>
<p>So he was supposed to take a train through Ukraine,</p>
<p>and he got out early and decided to start walking</p>
<p>through the countryside to go from village to village.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll get to his story in a minute.</p>
<p>Right before we started recording,</p>
<p>I got this book in the mail.</p>
<p>I ordered it on November 28th from Great Britain.</p>
<p>It was the only copy available on the whole internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Experiences in Russia, 1931.</p>
<p>It is anonymous, and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Gareth Jones wrote the introduction.</p>
<p>It was published by the Alton Press in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>It was self-published.</p>
<p>And see, it just says forward, it just says by the author.</p>
<p>So it was the author who went alongside Gareth Jones</p>
<p>was someone by the name of Henry John Hines,</p>
<p>who was heir to the Hines fortune.</p>
<p>And you only know that if you start looking at the internet,</p>
<p>because his name&rsquo;s not anywhere in this book.</p>
<p>Well, I opened this book up right when I got it,</p>
<p>right before we&rsquo;re taping, and it&rsquo;s signed by him.</p>
<p>And it took me a second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait a minute, who is this signed by?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s H.J. Hines, because his name was Jack Hines,</p>
<p>but it was Henry John Hines.</p>
<p>So this is, I&rsquo;m very excited</p>
<p>that I had this little miracle in the mail.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Christmas miracle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Christmas miracle.</p>
<p>They traveled together?</p>
<p>They traveled together.</p>
<p>So this book&rsquo;s a diary of their travels.</p>
<p>Why do you think so few journalists</p>
<p>was able to do what he did?</p>
<p>So there were several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, if you were a Western journalist</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>you were under very strict circumstances.</p>
<p>First of all, you could be deported at any time.</p>
<p>You had no, there was no pretense</p>
<p>that you have a right to be a journalist in,</p>
<p>especially as a representative of a capitalist,</p>
<p>by which they meant Western paper.</p>
<p>Second, it was a complete nightmare</p>
<p>getting your articles filed,</p>
<p>because you had a censor that you had to go through,</p>
<p>and the censor&rsquo;s job, whose life depended on it,</p>
<p>was to make sure that your story was advantageous</p>
<p>to the Soviet Union, or at least neutral.</p>
<p>And they had all sorts of techniques.</p>
<p>You know, they could spy, they spied on you all the time.</p>
<p>They followed you around, because, you know, you&rsquo;re a foreigner.</p>
<p>But also, that censor had to answer to somebody.</p>
<p>So all the censor has to do is be like,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m having trouble with my supervisor.</p>
<p>And the reporter could be like,</p>
<p>well, can I talk to the supervisor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s on deadline, but it&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy doesn&rsquo;t recognize the needs of deadlines.</p>
<p>So there was a big pressure, a lot of pressure</p>
<p>on Western journalists to have to get through this net,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s literally constant.</p>
<p>You know, every story, it&rsquo;s gonna be a fight.</p>
<p>So at a certain point, you&rsquo;re just gonna be like,</p>
<p>all right, and you&rsquo;re gonna pre-censor yourself.</p>
<p>You know, if you know, all right, if I include this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna get through, what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>I think human beings are naturally,</p>
<p>and also a lot of these journalists were pro-Soviet.</p>
<p>They thought this is the society of the future.</p>
<p>At least everyone&rsquo;s trying to make it a better country</p>
<p>for everyone, not like back home</p>
<p>with a poor slip between the cracks.</p>
<p>We gotta do what we can to make this work.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was a lot of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say conspiracy, but within the industry,</p>
<p>there was a consensus that the Stalin was the good guy,</p>
<p>and we were, if not the bad guy,</p>
<p>certainly not as good in certain regards.</p>
<p>So when this news of the famine started percolating,</p>
<p>all the other Western journalists,</p>
<p>besides Gareth Jones and Malcolm Muggeridge,</p>
<p>were saying this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing that they haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>The paper that took the lead in this was the New York Times</p>
<p>with their guy, Walter Durante,</p>
<p>who had previously won a Pulitzer</p>
<p>and had interviewed Stalin,</p>
<p>which is an enormously rare honor for a Westerner.</p>
<p>And he, because he has so much experience</p>
<p>covering Russia and the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>he basically took the lead</p>
<p>and other people followed his lead.</p>
<p>You know, he was kind of the dean</p>
<p>of the press corps in Russia, and he made a point.</p>
<p>And the thing, there&rsquo;s so many quotes I have from him</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s not only denying</p>
<p>that this mass starvation is happening,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also going after journalists</p>
<p>who are questioning the narrative.</p>
<p>And, you know, he says things like,</p>
<p>look, this is nothing</p>
<p>that the Russians haven&rsquo;t experienced before.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re simply tightening their belts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you only have to tighten your belt</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have enough food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they started a new exercise regimen</p>
<p>and now their body fat&rsquo;s dropping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why would someone tighten their belt?</p>
<p>So that was one.</p>
<p>And the New York Times had a 13-page article,</p>
<p>big headline, Russians Hungry, Not Starving.</p>
<p>And he went after Jones.</p>
<p>He went after Magritch, I believe.</p>
<p>No, he did go after Magritch,</p>
<p>but the point being that this is just propaganda</p>
<p>from people who want the Soviet Union to fail.</p>
<p>You know, they don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re building here.</p>
<p>You know, he had so many excuses like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, the reason all these Russians</p>
<p>are supposedly leaving their villages to go to the cities</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t because there&rsquo;s no food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re nomadic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tradition.</p>
<p>They go from town to town looking for new experiences.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, you know, at a certain point,</p>
<p>and I think it was 1941, where he was eventually like,</p>
<p>or 51 rather, I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>he was like, oh, well, I guess I was kind of wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>any journalist worth his salt can admit when he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, were you worth your salt?</p>
<p>Because you sure, he explicitly said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point in sending out journalists</p>
<p>to look for themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through the countryside and everyone&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just that the loudest people are making noise,</p>
<p>whereas everyone else is doing the work and, you know,</p>
<p>trying, and this isn&rsquo;t about famine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about Western skeptical about collectivization,</p>
<p>which is just simply a new way of farming.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was a new way of farming</p>
<p>and the results were by design</p>
<p>and also accidentally absolutely catastrophic.</p>
<p>How hard was it to see the truth at that time, do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think that was a mistake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s understandable to make as a journalist?</p>
<p>If my job as a journalist,</p>
<p>I have two bosses if I&rsquo;m in Moscow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my reporter in New York or London or whatever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got my censor here.</p>
<p>And he is making sure I have a house, the department.</p>
<p>He makes sure I have food.</p>
<p>He makes sure I have access to dignitaries.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my lifeline.</p>
<p>If I piss him off, I&rsquo;m on the next plane out of town.</p>
<p>So that-</p>
<p>Is that enough?</p>
<p>Is that enough to slowly suffocate</p>
<p>the integrity of a journalist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was slow at all.</p>
<p>And it was clearly enough.</p>
<p>And because what are they gonna do?</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think the failure of integrity has to come from New York</p>
<p>on the American side,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just the flock of fish or whatever</p>
<p>that all move in the same narrative.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think journalists would like to be the kind of people</p>
<p>that have integrity.</p>
<p>So if they are conscious of sacrificing their own integrity,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re conscious of an act that&rsquo;s doing it,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So it has to happen like a lobster slowly boiling.</p>
<p>No, I think it happens when everyone else is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Greek chorus, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, it&rsquo;s a chorus.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about the act, but they will, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to journalists where I get the sense</p>
<p>that they will sell their soul for access.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s their job.</p>
<p>Is it though?</p>
<p>Because what they do, what journalists do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen American journalists,</p>
<p>they take a huge amount of pride for having gotten</p>
<p>the interview, whatever that is, the Putin interview.</p>
<p>And first of all, they&rsquo;re glowing with pride.</p>
<p>It seems like they&rsquo;re always showing off</p>
<p>to the other journalists back in America.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re showing off like,</p>
<p>look, I got the access, you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And second thing they&rsquo;re doing when they show up</p>
<p>to that interview is they ask all the questions</p>
<p>that signal to the other journalists</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re on the same side.</p>
<p>They ask the most generic, aggressive questions</p>
<p>to which they know the answers.</p>
<p>They want to basically get the access</p>
<p>and ask the quote unquote hard-hitting questions</p>
<p>that they know will not be answered.</p>
<p>And this is the entire machinery of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s modern journalism.</p>
<p>And I suppose at that time-</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even doing the display</p>
<p>of hard-hitting questions.</p>
<p>It was PR pieces.</p>
<p>Think about what high status that is</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m an American journalist in Moscow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowed in this secretive country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy who&rsquo;s very privileged to have access</p>
<p>to live in Moscow and tell Americans,</p>
<p>which are all fascinated about this new society,</p>
<p>the future, what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And as soon as I kind of start questioning the narrative,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get kicked out and humiliated very publicly.</p>
<p>I thought you were in Moscow.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to say?</p>
<p>So Eugene Lyons, he&rsquo;s one of the heroes in the book.</p>
<p>He was a young communist.</p>
<p>And I think it was United Press he was working for.</p>
<p>They sent him there.</p>
<p>And when he went there, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, this is not what I thought it was gonna be like.</p>
<p>This is horrible.</p>
<p>And he turned very heavily against it.</p>
<p>But he talks about how they would write one thing</p>
<p>and say another thing and then think another thing.</p>
<p>And each of those steps was just more and more</p>
<p>like kind of lying in terms of maintaining your sanity</p>
<p>and maintaining your narrative.</p>
<p>So you reference Ann Applebaum and say that, quote,</p>
<p>starvation was not simply a consequence,</p>
<p>it was the goal and it was the law.</p>
<p>Stalin intended to break the Ukrainians once and for all.</p>
<p>It thus became common for villagers</p>
<p>to spy and inform on one another.</p>
<p>Turning in a neighbor for having a sack of grain</p>
<p>might be the easiest and safest way</p>
<p>to procure food for one&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To what degree was this the intention?</p>
<p>To what degree did Stalin anticipate this kind of suffering</p>
<p>as a consequence of the collectivization policy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that he intended the suffering</p>
<p>to be a consequence of the collectivization,</p>
<p>but it was quite apparent,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a pretty heavy consensus nowadays,</p>
<p>that his goal was very much,</p>
<p>because Ukraine, again, resented the czar</p>
<p>and had this kind of very contentious relationship</p>
<p>with Russia, which obviously very clearly remains today.</p>
<p>I mean, the hatred of Ukrainians</p>
<p>for Russians preceded Putin&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, even when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I obviously don&rsquo;t remember it,</p>
<p>but my parents just told me the hatred that they had,</p>
<p>and understandably, I mean,</p>
<p>they were basically under foreign occupation,</p>
<p>what they regard as foreign occupation for-</p>
<p>So your parents talked about a hatred</p>
<p>by Ukrainians towards Russians?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, oh, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know,</p>
<p>I certainly, having visited there this year,</p>
<p>because of the most recent invasion in February,</p>
<p>that hatred is nationwide and very intense,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, I think the feeling,</p>
<p>the emotions were much more complex before.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>at least they were under occupation before, right?</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t speak Ukrainian,</p>
<p>they had to speak Russian, so this was a thing.</p>
<p>But because of the forced intermixing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a more complex story.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I mean, they weren&rsquo;t certainly fans.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s people that came from Russia</p>
<p>that are living there, they&rsquo;re marrying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re falling in love, they&rsquo;re working with each other.</p>
<p>So like, there is the bigger atrocity of the genocide of it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the reality of intermixing of peoples.</p>
<p>Well, sure, I mean-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the atrocity of slavery in the United States,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also a reality</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s now an intermixing of peoples,</p>
<p>and now they fall in love,</p>
<p>and they live after slavery&rsquo;s abolished.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality.</p>
<p>Like, after the genocide-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Precedes a kind of generational integration</p>
<p>that still remembers, like the suffering reverberates,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s a different culture that&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>And now, I think,</p>
<p>I mean, I have complex stories,</p>
<p>I mean, most of my family&rsquo;s from Ukraine,</p>
<p>so I have a, and my understanding</p>
<p>is grounded in Soviet Ukraine.</p>
<p>But there is something in the last 30 years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different, where now,</p>
<p>after the collapse of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a true, maybe renewed fight for independence,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a difference,</p>
<p>like, if I go to North Korea as an American, right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very friendly now, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t perceive me as part of the yank devils.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, you&rsquo;re an American,</p>
<p>but you come from America.</p>
<p>So, yeah, there&rsquo;s gonna be intermarriage,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between the perception of Russia as an entity,</p>
<p>as opposed to some individual Russians.</p>
<p>I just, that wasn&rsquo;t the experience I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>talking to a lot of friends and family in Ukraine</p>
<p>until the war started.</p>
<p>Really, so they really didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this kind of low-key animosity toward Russians?</p>
<p>No, there was a lot of factional conflict inside Ukraine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, the whole country is united.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a clarity now,</p>
<p>the war gave a clarity that wasn&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>So this is, I was saying earlier</p>
<p>how humans define themselves by opposition.</p>
<p>So now that there&rsquo;s a war, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, all this little stuff doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We are all united because we have a common enemy.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, as you know, there&rsquo;s regions</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just groups of different people.</p>
<p>And then one of the big divides, of course,</p>
<p>is the city versus rural.</p>
<p>And then in the case of Ukraine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to know what the truth is,</p>
<p>because my personal experience is sampled.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many Ukrainians I know,</p>
<p>maybe like 30 or 40, before this trip, like 30 or 40.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m close with just a handful.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s hard to know,</p>
<p>because you get a lot of Western press perspective</p>
<p>and you get the Russian perspective</p>
<p>and you get other perspectives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to know how much hate there is</p>
<p>outside of this conflict.</p>
<p>So my primary question is,</p>
<p>and this is what I ask a lot of people</p>
<p>when I visited Ukraine,</p>
<p>is will you ever be able to forgive the Russians?</p>
<p>And a lot of people said, never, never.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t just about,</p>
<p>assuming we win, they would say.</p>
<p>Assuming we win, we still would not ever forgive.</p>
<p>Never, never forgive.</p>
<p>And they said it in a way where like,</p>
<p>not only us, but our children will never forgive.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just, you know what?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just about Russia or the Russian leadership,</p>
<p>it was about the Russian people.</p>
<p>But a lot of people also said</p>
<p>that this is our feeling currently, we understand.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re lost in the rage of war.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you lose so much.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you asked Americans,</p>
<p>would you ever be friends with Germany or Japan?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, are you kidding?</p>
<p>After Pearl Harbor?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But of course, most Americans didn&rsquo;t feel Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>is different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good point when it&rsquo;s your own land,</p>
<p>but when, imagine it wasn&rsquo;t just Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>but it was New York and Chicago and Dallas</p>
<p>and all these cities being bombed.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a linger on this war in Ukraine currently.</p>
<p>Does it break your heart to see what&rsquo;s going on there now,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s on the same land as the same cities?</p>
<p>The same stories are now brought back to the surface,</p>
<p>like the generational pain,</p>
<p>as it was in the time that you&rsquo;re writing about?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a fundamentally different country,</p>
<p>different war, different situation,</p>
<p>or do you hear echoes of the same?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>because I think there is no one.</p>
<p>I mean, there is no one who is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad this is happening to the Ukrainian people, right?</p>
<p>So even the people who are for Putin and for the invasion</p>
<p>and whatever justification they might have for his war,</p>
<p>no one is like, yeah, let&rsquo;s get those darn Ukrainians.</p>
<p>I think there was that sense in America after 9-11</p>
<p>when we invade Afghanistan and Iraq</p>
<p>and there was like, F those Iraqis, F those Afghan people.</p>
<p>Whereas now, I think it&rsquo;s completely the opposite.</p>
<p>I also think a lot of Russians, I&rsquo;m sure if I ask them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not thinking like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s wipe the Ukrainian people off the map.</p>
<p>I think whatever reasons they have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not kind of going after this.</p>
<p>Even if you have to kind of rile up people</p>
<p>against the citizenry, it&rsquo;s not to that level</p>
<p>of the hatred of the Kulaks, hatred of those villages.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a belief though amongst the soldiers</p>
<p>outside of the big cities,</p>
<p>their belief that the Ukrainian people</p>
<p>who the Russian soldiers believe</p>
<p>are their brothers and sisters</p>
<p>are occupied by an evil regime.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you need to save them from the evil regime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also very different from the Holodomor.</p>
<p>And also there is dispute in the press</p>
<p>about the causes, the consequences, the victims,</p>
<p>the villains of Putin&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>But when it came to this,</p>
<p>no one is denying that the war is happening.</p>
<p>The New York Times isn&rsquo;t saying everything is fine</p>
<p>and the only reason people are saying it&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>is because they hate Putin or they hate Zelensky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have so much footage</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And you have, it takes two seconds to go on Google</p>
<p>and you have a map of Russian advancement.</p>
<p>What parts are they occupying?</p>
<p>What parts are not under their control?</p>
<p>I did a little live stream.</p>
<p>I raised money for Ukrainian refugees to feed them</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s my concern is just keeping people fed.</p>
<p>There was none of that.</p>
<p>And the two people who kind of spoke the truth,</p>
<p>Gareth Jones was shot, I think,</p>
<p>the day before his 30th birthday</p>
<p>while he was uncovering news, I think it was in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Malcolm Muggeridge had problem finding work</p>
<p>when he exposed this.</p>
<p>And I think, like we was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>the ubiquity of things like cell phones and camera phones</p>
<p>would make something like this, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say an impossibility, they could still do it,</p>
<p>but it would be really hard to cover it up.</p>
<p>Well, sort of to push back on that,</p>
<p>if you just look at Iran, I would draw a different,</p>
<p>so I agree with you mostly,</p>
<p>but I would also draw a different distinction</p>
<p>when the atrocities happening to your own people</p>
<p>versus there&rsquo;s a war.</p>
<p>Ukraine is a sovereign independent nation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a war between two nations.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s easier for journalists</p>
<p>to somehow reveal the truth in that.</p>
<p>When the atrocities happen within the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>for some reason, that&rsquo;s easier to hide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easier for journalists to deceive themselves</p>
<p>and easier for the authoritarian leader</p>
<p>to hide the information.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the dark, I mean, that&rsquo;s why people,</p>
<p>maybe you can educate me on this,</p>
<p>but this is why I think people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about Holodomor and other atrocities,</p>
<p>the Great Leap Forward,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s inside the country</p>
<p>versus the Holocaust, that&rsquo;s part of a war.</p>
<p>Why is that that we,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re too almost like afraid, too polite,</p>
<p>too, what is it that we don&rsquo;t wanna cover the atrocities</p>
<p>because side the country, like it&rsquo;s their business,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t want to touch it.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that what we refer to as the news</p>
<p>is in the business of selling narratives, right?</p>
<p>And the narrative of the Holocaust is a very powerful one,</p>
<p>which is if you let hatred of a subgroup</p>
<p>in a population get out of control,</p>
<p>this is the ultimate consequence,</p>
<p>and this is something that we all have to be scared of</p>
<p>and do everything in our power to avoid in the future</p>
<p>for any outgroup.</p>
<p>Whereas what&rsquo;s the narrative of the Holodomor?</p>
<p>Sometimes governments kill their own citizens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you could do about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing we, I mean,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have let us send food.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge, like the newspapers,</p>
<p>even Russia weren&rsquo;t acknowledging it.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the, like this is some of the issues I had</p>
<p>with regard to trying to advocate</p>
<p>for the North Korean people.</p>
<p>The reporters would be like, well, what can I do</p>
<p>as an American?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very natural question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I like, all I know is how to speak to what is happening,</p>
<p>but in terms of next steps,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good answer for you.</p>
<p>So that is where the news kind of does break down</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t a story or a call to action,</p>
<p>the kind of, you&rsquo;re kind of almost like having a movie</p>
<p>with a cliffhanger and there&rsquo;s no sequel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what am I supposed to do here?</p>
<p>Like, this is not scratching that itch,</p>
<p>which for me, as a consumer of news, you know,</p>
<p>layman is like, okay, here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>There was a bad guy and the cops shot him</p>
<p>or they took him to jail.</p>
<p>And now the bad guy&rsquo;s caught, beginning, middle, end.</p>
<p>Here it&rsquo;s just like, Mao did this.</p>
<p>A lot of people were executed and starved.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that awful?</p>
<p>Well, and Mao&rsquo;s still in power.</p>
<p>And now Richard Nixon is raising a toast to him.</p>
<p>Like, that story is just like,</p>
<p>how am I supposed to feel about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like when there&rsquo;s tanks</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s war and there&rsquo;s military conflict,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more actionable, you can cover it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it did seem like Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the Holocaust was the thing</p>
<p>that made it most coverable.</p>
<p>I think it was that this is a threat</p>
<p>to the entire civilization.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we were at war with them, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it coverable.</p>
<p>And if the Holocaust was happening just inside a country,</p>
<p>inside of Germany,</p>
<p>or even if it didn&rsquo;t expand beyond Poland.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be like a footnote.</p>
<p>It was in many ways a footnote.</p>
<p>Like, many of the early steps toward it was like,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t cover it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, all right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being oppressive toward their own people, okay.</p>
<p>Especially given some of the,</p>
<p>maybe if you negotiate certain peace treaties</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union and with Germany,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re too, the basic, the pacifist imperative.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Sorry, Santa.</p>
<p>Is that what you say every time you masturbate?</p>
<p>No, after you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now, see, I hate it when you don&rsquo;t yes, and,</p>
<p>because it leaves me in a hole I dug for myself.</p>
<p>And I sit there in a hole,</p>
<p>in my sadness.</p>
<p>How long have you been writing this book?</p>
<p>I mean, how long?</p>
<p>Two years.</p>
<p>Mentally, it was like two years,</p>
<p>since you spent time with it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, almost three, two and a half, yeah.</p>
<p>And I suppose it stayed with you much longer,</p>
<p>like you said, your family.</p>
<p>So, in many ways,</p>
<p>this is a book you&rsquo;ve been writing your whole life.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fair,</p>
<p>that all my work&rsquo;s been leading to this, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly the most, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the most important thing I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>What stands out to you about Haldemar?</p>
<p>What moments, what aspects of human nature stand out to you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think that story is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say story,</p>
<p>but I meant like that incident is,</p>
<p>I mean, I was familiar with it before,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So, I kinda knew about it,</p>
<p>in part, thanks to kind of the North Korean work,</p>
<p>and coming from Ukraine.</p>
<p>The thing that was also kind of insane about it is,</p>
<p>that they were taking all this grain,</p>
<p>and not using it even to feed the Russian people.</p>
<p>They were selling it for export, for hard currency.</p>
<p>I think what the takeaway there,</p>
<p>and I think, again, this is something Westerners,</p>
<p>and especially Americans, don&rsquo;t appreciate.</p>
<p>They think that evil often has a logic to it, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, why would,</p>
<p>because it makes no sense to them,</p>
<p>why would they kill their own people?</p>
<p>Therefore, it probably didn&rsquo;t happen, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that thing.</p>
<p>They really think like, okay,</p>
<p>they can understand country A conquers country B,</p>
<p>and slaughters a bunch of people country B,</p>
<p>as a means of conquest.</p>
<p>Like that kind of makes sense to them,</p>
<p>they know that thing.</p>
<p>But like, why are you starving all these people?</p>
<p>Like, what are you gaining out of it?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to them.</p>
<p>And because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of like, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably more the story that I&rsquo;m hearing.</p>
<p>And a lot of times there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like evil for the sake of power.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have that,</p>
<p>certainly anywhere near that scale,</p>
<p>and never have certainly since America has been a thing.</p>
<p>I mean, and the fact that this is like the 30s,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t that long ago.</p>
<p>But I think also the narrative in some ways</p>
<p>is how technology is also something</p>
<p>that kind of people have mixed feelings about.</p>
<p>Like I said this before,</p>
<p>and this is something I really believe very strongly,</p>
<p>the ability of information to be captured and spread easily</p>
<p>is such an effective tool in exposing humanity at its worst.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one thing if I sit here</p>
<p>and tell you what I saw in these villages,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another thing if I sat you down and showed you a YouTube</p>
<p>and you and I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to look in the eyes of someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s thinking about eating their own kids.</p>
<p>I mean, and you see that face,</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s not some CGI, it will haunt you forever.</p>
<p>Just looking at the different mechanisms</p>
<p>that made all of this happen.</p>
<p>So this is not just one guy, Stalin, having a policy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole system.</p>
<p>I mean, one of it is just a system of fear.</p>
<p>But how do you implement that system of fear?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a giant bureaucracy of fear.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what he implemented with the Great Terror is-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the late 30s.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s throughout the 30s,</p>
<p>but yeah, it starts in the mid to late 30s.</p>
<p>Basically, communism was based on the common good</p>
<p>and the public good.</p>
<p>And anything private, which was bourgeois, was a problem.</p>
<p>When they were started, when the revolution came,</p>
<p>the October Revolution,</p>
<p>they wanted to recreate society entirely.</p>
<p>And that included like, okay, let&rsquo;s make it so</p>
<p>everyone eats in like cafeterias,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not eating by themselves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s design buildings so everyone has to share bathrooms.</p>
<p>Like their whole plan was to have,</p>
<p>eliminate any kind of concept of privacy at all.</p>
<p>They also had this bizarre kind of radical idea</p>
<p>of like attacking shame.</p>
<p>So many of these, before the 1917,</p>
<p>people were also very involved with like free love,</p>
<p>because the idea of like having this private bond</p>
<p>between husband and wife was also bourgeois and old fashioned</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re the society of the future.</p>
<p>That changed relatively quickly,</p>
<p>but they were talking about things</p>
<p>like raising kids communally and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So for Stalin, if you and I are friends,</p>
<p>we have a bond that&rsquo;s a threat to him.</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s a threat.</p>
<p>The, any kind of organization is a threat,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a power center that is not between,</p>
<p>a relationship between you and him.</p>
<p>And now you have a relationship with somebody else.</p>
<p>So he systemically went through that whole society</p>
<p>and it became, there were certain things that became a crime.</p>
<p>Then it became a crime to be a spouse</p>
<p>of the enemy of the people.</p>
<p>Now, right away, I as a child become an orphan</p>
<p>because my dad was an enemy of the people.</p>
<p>My mom is married to an enemy of the people.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t have parents.</p>
<p>They get arrested or executed or whatever.</p>
<p>But now I have nowhere to go,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t go to my friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>because their family doesn&rsquo;t want to take in a child</p>
<p>that the enemy of the people.</p>
<p>You had this culture where everyone was very much encouraged</p>
<p>to turn people in.</p>
<p>And if you turn, if you&rsquo;re arrested and tortured,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, who are your accomplices?</p>
<p>And now you just got to name names, people you knew.</p>
<p>And then it becomes this whole chain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, how am I going to protest my innocence?</p>
<p>If Lex just said, I worked with Michael</p>
<p>and we were working with Trotskyists</p>
<p>and we were plotting to overthrow Stalin.</p>
<p>Lex testified to this.</p>
<p>He signed a confession.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do now?</p>
<p>So it worked its way in a most viral fashion</p>
<p>through the whole society.</p>
<p>There was this amazing moment where these poor people,</p>
<p>peasants, because obviously the powerless</p>
<p>are often going to be caught in the web.</p>
<p>They were going to jail for being Trotskyites</p>
<p>and they had to ask themselves, what&rsquo;s a tractorist?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know who Trotsky was.</p>
<p>And the other thing is ethnicity was a problem, right?</p>
<p>If you were an ethnicity, you have more power</p>
<p>with other members of that ethnicity</p>
<p>than you have with this kind of broader Soviet culture.</p>
<p>So he would just deport entire populations</p>
<p>from their ancestral lands to other parts,</p>
<p>A, to spread the population around,</p>
<p>but also to break that link</p>
<p>between the peoples and their lands.</p>
<p>There was this 1937 NKVD order against Polish people</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like, if you had come from Poland</p>
<p>or had been, just this whole list,</p>
<p>and basically people were being arrested</p>
<p>because they had Polish last names.</p>
<p>And I think it was a million people were killed,</p>
<p>like some astronomical number.</p>
<p>So there was this, anything that was a bond</p>
<p>was a threat to him.</p>
<p>And it went systemically.</p>
<p>So after he had all these kind of executions</p>
<p>of people who were like Lenin&rsquo;s people, the old Bolsheviks,</p>
<p>then he went after, he started arresting the secret police.</p>
<p>You know, he arrested all the cops,</p>
<p>he arrested all the judges,</p>
<p>and all these prisoners got to see the judges</p>
<p>who yelled at them for being counter-revolutionaries and spies</p>
<p>now they were in the jails.</p>
<p>If you were a foreigner,</p>
<p>if there was a huge push from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>toward African-Americans, right?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>look, you were living in a racist country.</p>
<p>Here we have no racial inequality.</p>
<p>Come live here.</p>
<p>A bunch of them went and they were all vanished.</p>
<p>You know, anyone who knew information</p>
<p>about the outside world,</p>
<p>if you were a foreigner, Andre Babel,</p>
<p>I forget his first name,</p>
<p>he had a French writer he was friends with.</p>
<p>He was arrested and shot because he&rsquo;s a spy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re friends with Melrose.</p>
<p>And that means if you know a foreigner, you&rsquo;re a spy.</p>
<p>Speaking Esperanto became a crime.</p>
<p>Having a pen pal,</p>
<p>literally anything that was some kind of chain</p>
<p>between yourself and someone else was a threat</p>
<p>and was grounds for arrest.</p>
<p>The Russians would joke about how relieved they would be</p>
<p>if someone knocked on your door in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to tell you your house was on fire</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t the NKVD coming to arrest you.</p>
<p>And of course, most of the accusations</p>
<p>probably were completely false.</p>
<p>So not only because you not do all of those things,</p>
<p>you were also a victim of just-</p>
<p>Being late to work became a felony</p>
<p>and also not doing your job became a felony</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re taking food or product away</p>
<p>from the people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supposed to be there working for the people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this one story, which I was doing the audio book</p>
<p>and this is like,</p>
<p>I still trying to get through without crying.</p>
<p>This was 1920.</p>
<p>They were a bunch of kids in Moscow who were pickpockets</p>
<p>between ages 11 and 15.</p>
<p>They rounded them up and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>all right, point out your accomplices.</p>
<p>And they would take them in the trams</p>
<p>and you have to point out people.</p>
<p>Then they would take them back to the cellar,</p>
<p>beat the crap out of these children.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d take them out again.</p>
<p>And if they didn&rsquo;t point out to anybody,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d beat them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, all right.</p>
<p>So they just start pointing at random.</p>
<p>And the thing that was really sick about this story,</p>
<p>if that wasn&rsquo;t sick enough,</p>
<p>is that the screams that the other criminals,</p>
<p>the adult hardened criminals</p>
<p>had to hear from these children</p>
<p>as they realized they were being taken back to the cellar.</p>
<p>It was just horrifying.</p>
<p>And they, so they tortured people.</p>
<p>They tortured confessions out of people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>At scale.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and the dark aspect of this is it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this weird, it&rsquo;s a bureaucracy of torture.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s not like that there&rsquo;s, what is it?</p>
<p>The torturer is afraid of,</p>
<p>like does it so that he doesn&rsquo;t become the prisoner.</p>
<p>Right, because then it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, you couldn&rsquo;t get a confession out of him?</p>
<p>Are you an enemy of the people now as well?</p>
<p>And the thing that was even crazier</p>
<p>is that a lot of these interrogators were frustrated</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, look, we both know you&rsquo;re innocent.</p>
<p>Just sign this confession and make my life easier.</p>
<p>They knew it was crap.</p>
<p>Stalin joked about, Stalin joked about this.</p>
<p>This is one of his little jokes.</p>
<p>There was a kid who was arrested and he was said,</p>
<p>oh, was forced to say, you wrote Eugene Onegin,</p>
<p>which is a play.</p>
<p>It goes, that play was by Pushkin.</p>
<p>And they tortured him, they tortured him, tortured him.</p>
<p>And then his parents are walking down the street</p>
<p>and they run into a secret police and they go,</p>
<p>congratulations.</p>
<p>And they go, for what?</p>
<p>They go, your son wrote Eugene Onegin.</p>
<p>Like he admitted to it last night.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just like, they could get you to say anything.</p>
<p>And what else was really, really sick,</p>
<p>which they understood is they lowered the death penalty</p>
<p>for kids, I think it&rsquo;s either 14 or 12.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember off the top of my head.</p>
<p>And what Stalin&rsquo;s head of the secret police did</p>
<p>is when you were interrogating someone,</p>
<p>you either had to have some of that family member&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possessions on the desk or a copy of the decree</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying that they can go after your family.</p>
<p>And the amount of people who would confess to anything</p>
<p>when they saw their family was in danger</p>
<p>and they knew this wasn&rsquo;t a bluff was astronomical.</p>
<p>Then it becomes a chain.</p>
<p>Because if you confess and I have your confession,</p>
<p>how hard is it to get your neighbor?</p>
<p>What do you make of the, for most of the time,</p>
<p>the NKVD was about the head of NKVD Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria.</p>
<p>Oh, Beria, yeah.</p>
<p>I have a death warrant signed by him</p>
<p>hanging in my kitchen that I acquired.</p>
<p>He was one of the most evil people who ever lived.</p>
<p>The thing that Americans don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>is how clever some of the sadism is.</p>
<p>So there was one actress,</p>
<p>I think he took her back to his house</p>
<p>and he asked her to, he tried to get her to sleep with him.</p>
<p>And he promised her that if she did,</p>
<p>her father and either her husband or her grandfather,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember which one it was,</p>
<p>is gonna be released from jail.</p>
<p>Well, they were already dead at that point.</p>
<p>He had them executed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still finding the bodies of the women he murdered</p>
<p>in the grounds of his dacha, it&rsquo;s an embassy now.</p>
<p>And the thing is Stalin knew,</p>
<p>because at one point Stalin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a picture of Stalin&rsquo;s daughter in his lap,</p>
<p>and she was at his house one day</p>
<p>and Stalin calls up, he goes,</p>
<p>get out of there immediately.</p>
<p>So he, like a good bureaucrat,</p>
<p>he kept a list of all of his sexual partners.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still sealed,</p>
<p>but both him and his bodyguard had this list.</p>
<p>So just to clarify.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He headed the operation</p>
<p>that did this whole giant mechanism of forced confessions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He was part of expanding the gulags.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t the head of the gulags,</p>
<p>but he was part of this giant machine.</p>
<p>And his famous quote was,</p>
<p>show me the man and I&rsquo;ll show you the crime.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But on top of that,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re describing is he was also,</p>
<p>related or not, was also just a mass rapist.</p>
<p>Yes, and there&rsquo;s some dispute</p>
<p>about whether he went after kids with his rapes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s plenty of adult women</p>
<p>that were targets for this.</p>
<p>There was also another little joke about him</p>
<p>about how Stalin is looking for his pipe</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t find it and he calls Beria.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, okay, I can&rsquo;t find this pipe.</p>
<p>And then the afternoon he calls Beria again.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, I found the pipe.</p>
<p>He goes, but Comrade Stalin,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got four people to confess to steal already.</p>
<p>So you have to laugh,</p>
<p>but then you think about the nature of how it operates.</p>
<p>Well, and also the fact that this kind of person</p>
<p>was allowed to run.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s all different kinds of evil</p>
<p>and rape was just a part of the story.</p>
<p>His own personal willingness to</p>
<p>oversee torture and commit torture himself and rape.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also what happens when you&rsquo;re in a country</p>
<p>where it has no rights of any kind.</p>
<p>And by the way, I should mention</p>
<p>that people should get your book and audio.</p>
<p>When is your audio book coming out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be out shortly, yeah.</p>
<p>You gave me the great honor of voicing this man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for the promo.</p>
<p>Yeah, for the promo.</p>
<p>Yeah, the video.</p>
<p>Excellent, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>For a moment, I actually, it was really difficult.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It was just a sentence.</p>
<p>I understand, I understand.</p>
<p>Because it takes you to that place.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because he told her,</p>
<p>scream if you want, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And he was right.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the thing, he wasn&rsquo;t bluffing.</p>
<p>You could scream, these women could scream their head off.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna come help him.</p>
<p>He would drive around Moscow at night</p>
<p>in his limo looking for victims.</p>
<p>But somehow me saying those words is tough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Because this is where we came from.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just like some kind of Tolkien villain.</p>
<p>But it also was tough because I could see myself</p>
<p>being somewhere in that machine somewhere.</p>
<p>Like somehow that put me right there.</p>
<p>Any cog in that machine is committing evil.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dark thing.</p>
<p>I think the higher you are to the top,</p>
<p>the closer you are to the top,</p>
<p>the more ability you have to stop it.</p>
<p>But the less, the more freedom you have to stop it,</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>To a point, yeah.</p>
<p>But like the little things.</p>
<p>So Beria had the freedom to commit rape.</p>
<p>Or not to.</p>
<p>Or not to.</p>
<p>And so he chooses to sort of increase the amount of evil</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s putting out into the world.</p>
<p>But then you have to counterbalance that</p>
<p>as dark as this calculus is.</p>
<p>After Stalin dies, like that week,</p>
<p>they start making the gulag shrink.</p>
<p>They start pulling back on the labor camps.</p>
<p>So I mean, that is a big plus in his side.</p>
<p>Like you start liberating, having this mass amnesty</p>
<p>and freeing people from work camps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a minor thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not saying Peter, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s a good person,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of insane that someone can do things</p>
<p>that everyone listening to this would regard as pure evil.</p>
<p>And at the same time, this guy also,</p>
<p>when the time came, saved tens of thousands of lives.</p>
<p>So in some sense, Stalin is the kind of cancer</p>
<p>that permeates all the Soviet minds.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s gone, you almost like wake up,</p>
<p>wait a minute, what the fuck was I a part of?</p>
<p>And Khrushchev, it was in 56,</p>
<p>when he gave a secret speech behind closed doors.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>all this criticism of Stalin was true.</p>
<p>This is completely not what Marxism,</p>
<p>he tried to salvage the system.</p>
<p>This is not what Marxism is about.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have a personality cult.</p>
<p>Stalin killed all these top generals.</p>
<p>And when Hitler turned to betray the pact and invaded,</p>
<p>Stalin didn&rsquo;t believe his buddy Hitler was gonna do this.</p>
<p>And as a result of this,</p>
<p>we lost a lot of territory and lives.</p>
<p>This is not a military genius.</p>
<p>This was Stalin being an idiot or a moron,</p>
<p>whatever term you wanna be.</p>
<p>So, yeah, but the thing is Khrushchev also was a butcher.</p>
<p>He had a lot of blood in his hands.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t become the, take Stalin&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>without having overlooked a lot of murder and chaos.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>subtitled books, A Tale of Good and Evil.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much malevolence to go around.</p>
<p>What do you think was going through Stalin&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>in the 20s and the 30s?</p>
<p>Like,</p>
<p>did he directly like allow himself</p>
<p>to acknowledge the reality of the suffering he was causing?</p>
<p>Like, what does it take to be that human?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost interested to extract lessons from that</p>
<p>for leaders of today.</p>
<p>Like, how hard is it?</p>
<p>Is it that Stalin is evil</p>
<p>or can you just delude yourself gradually</p>
<p>into where you don&rsquo;t have a sense</p>
<p>of the effect of your policies on the populace?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re not deluding yourself</p>
<p>because you have around you an entire government</p>
<p>of people telling you 24-7 how great you are,</p>
<p>how thankful they are for you,</p>
<p>how awesome you are, you&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>So, that certainly gonna play into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked myself that question as well.</p>
<p>Like, do these people believe their own bullshit?</p>
<p>And I think the receipts are when Elena Ceausescu,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the four women on the cover,</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s being taken away to be executed in 1989,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s yelling at the soldiers,</p>
<p>how could you, I raised you like a mother.</p>
<p>So, she at least believed her own bullshit.</p>
<p>With Stalin, he was obviously extremely intelligent.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of easy for us to kind of psychologize</p>
<p>and say he&rsquo;s a sociopath, he&rsquo;s a narcissist,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this, he&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, like if you&rsquo;re surrounded</p>
<p>by a culture dedicated to glorifying you</p>
<p>and everyone you meet is so happy to see you,</p>
<p>and oh my God, all your pronouncements are so good.</p>
<p>And you know what, if you make a decision that&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>the people around you, it&rsquo;s their job to tell you</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s not your fault, it&rsquo;s the fault of the wreckers</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the fault of Hitler or whoever it is, the kulaks.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the human mind wants to believe</p>
<p>how great it is, especially someone in that vaunted position.</p>
<p>But he had his, there was this one funny,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the word loosely, quote,</p>
<p>when Hitler invades Russia and he couldn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just missing in action for days</p>
<p>because how could Hitler betray me,</p>
<p>we had a deal, birds of a feather.</p>
<p>And he had this quote about like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve taken Lenin&rsquo;s legacy and shitted out our asses.</p>
<p>I think he was very aware,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no question that he was aware</p>
<p>that in terms of being a philosopher or a thinker,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t on Lenin&rsquo;s level, right?</p>
<p>So that was, I&rsquo;m sure, played a lot into his psychology.</p>
<p>That he never quite lived up to the,</p>
<p>like, everything he tried.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some sense that the collectivization,</p>
<p>that this idea was a failure,</p>
<p>the way he responds to the economic policy being a failure</p>
<p>is to lean in and basically torture anyone</p>
<p>who says it&rsquo;s a failure and double down on the policy.</p>
<p>Like, that says something about.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a failure, it broke the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think he believed early on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it turned into,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t think in the very early days</p>
<p>there was a thought that collectivization</p>
<p>is the right mechanism by which to enact communism</p>
<p>in the nation.</p>
<p>I think his goal was to break their spirit</p>
<p>and getting them fed was secondary, right?</p>
<p>And given the fact that they stopped complaining</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re dead, he got what he wanted.</p>
<p>He got a compliant population.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I wonder how much disagreement there is about,</p>
<p>because if that was the goal from the beginning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different level of evil.</p>
<p>I think that was clearly the goal.</p>
<p>So his, like I said earlier, he broke with Lenin</p>
<p>because he wanted socialism in one country, right?</p>
<p>That was his vision, right?</p>
<p>And he was also very aware</p>
<p>that what became the Soviet Union was extremely diverse.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s a gigantic country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big country on earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always gigantic.</p>
<p>You had all these peoples, these nationalities within it</p>
<p>that have had historical enmity</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna have loyalty to Moscow.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Georgian himself.</p>
<p>This was always a big problem.</p>
<p>So that was what he wanted to do as well,</p>
<p>is to homogenize and have them be standardized.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see how you do that</p>
<p>without either massive re-education,</p>
<p>which is only gonna go so far,</p>
<p>or really just crushing people&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>So like a forced homogeneity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the other big thing,</p>
<p>a big element of Soviet culture and the Soviet mythology,</p>
<p>I mean, he called, he changed his name to Stalin.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even pronounce his Georgian name,</p>
<p>Djokas Vili or something like that.</p>
<p>It means man of steel.</p>
<p>So a large part of the,</p>
<p>and this still remains in Russian culture to this day.</p>
<p>I see in my family too, and like other Russians I know,</p>
<p>there is this pride in ruthlessness</p>
<p>and this kind of like, I&rsquo;m so tough,</p>
<p>like nothing&rsquo;s gonna affect me.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna suffer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s for a greater good or for the long-term</p>
<p>and not to be kind of sentimental</p>
<p>or squeamish about things.</p>
<p>Like that was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that away from me too, Michael.</p>
<p>What do you mean? You&rsquo;ve taken everything.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>I admire, not stoicism, but that kind of hardness.</p>
<p>I look forward to myself.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Stalin.</p>
<p>But not to the extent that like, if some,</p>
<p>like for example, like if you see someone suffering</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s being used as a mechanism</p>
<p>to get you to change your opinion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re not gonna get to me.</p>
<p>Like that is very much part of that Russian psychology.</p>
<p>Right, at least at that time.</p>
<p>Yes, I think still largely no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be manipulated</p>
<p>by someone else&rsquo;s suffering or weakness,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really part of it to this day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of it is caricature,</p>
<p>how much of it is reality.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I remember, I knew of someone who was,</p>
<p>him and his fiance were Russian</p>
<p>and they had this big fight.</p>
<p>She took off the ring, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>And just like the way he told the story to me,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, what do you want me to say?</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me, baby.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t live without you.</p>
<p>Like that nasty cruelty, which-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a Russian thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a people thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an American thing.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s all kinds of flavors</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re different by region</p>
<p>of the way that people are cruel to each other.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;m not arguing that.</p>
<p>In America, New Jersey is different than Texas,</p>
<p>is different than California.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think Americans are a higher trust,</p>
<p>more kind society than Russia, even today?</p>
<p>Higher trust?</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m not going to, so first of all,</p>
<p>I have very complex feelings about Russia today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about, that&rsquo;s like a January before the war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about nowadays.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a complex psychological dynamic</p>
<p>of what trusting means.</p>
<p>I think Russians are generally less friendly,</p>
<p>but have more intimate friendships.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one is more trusting.</p>
<p>Which is more trusting?</p>
<p>Americans.</p>
<p>But then this would define trusting different.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s having a party in America</p>
<p>and people come over, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s welcome.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in Russia, it&rsquo;s like, who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;d you bring?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s much more of a like,</p>
<p>let me be sure that&rsquo;s okay, this person&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have parties.</p>
<p>I have never been at a party.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t come to mine.</p>
<p>Then ask if it was very sad.</p>
<p>Well, I love Ben.</p>
<p>I love Ben.</p>
<p>Well, you should have showed it by showing up.</p>
<p>Man, I&rsquo;m a high height from the world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m afraid of social interaction.</p>
<p>And I just lay on the ground instead</p>
<p>and feel sorry for myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad Santa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad Santa.</p>
<p>Well, I conserve my emotional energy</p>
<p>towards this one day of the year.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where I can intensely spread my joy.</p>
<p>All right, speaking of which,</p>
<p>you tell a Christmas story in the book.</p>
<p>Are you spoiling that chapter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Die Hard.</p>
<p>All right, well, I&rsquo;m not gonna spoil it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>I was very proud of that chapter.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the ending that&rsquo;s a Christmas story</p>
<p>is just like, I know everyone reading it&rsquo;s gonna go Google it</p>
<p>and be like, these can&rsquo;t be real, but it was real.</p>
<p>That it was on Christmas, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, this has to do with the bigger picture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to do the big reveal,</p>
<p>but the bigger picture of there was an Iron Curtain</p>
<p>and it was coming down in complex ways.</p>
<p>How would you define the Iron Curtain?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a set of ideologies,</p>
<p>a set of countries united by an ideology</p>
<p>and a set of countries united by a different ideology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a curtain that divided them</p>
<p>and it eventually came down.</p>
<p>So how would you describe how it came down?</p>
<p>It came, I hate that I can never remember,</p>
<p>ever remember if this was Hemingway.</p>
<p>No, it was Hemingway.</p>
<p>It was Mark Twain.</p>
<p>No, it came down two ways, gradually then suddenly.</p>
<p>The thing with the Iron Curtain and the Warsaw Pact,</p>
<p>these were a bunch of nations run under communism,</p>
<p>but they were all, almost all, under the sway of Moscow.</p>
<p>So if they were going to make big changes,</p>
<p>Moscow had to prove it.</p>
<p>It was in the 50s when Hungary decided to rebel</p>
<p>or not rebel, liberalize.</p>
<p>And they even were thinking of leaving the Warsaw Pact</p>
<p>and the Russians send in the tanks.</p>
<p>And you had the development</p>
<p>of what was called the Brezhnev Doctrine,</p>
<p>which was the idea that it is the duty</p>
<p>of all the Warsaw Pact nations,</p>
<p>if another country tries to,</p>
<p>and this was also in 68 in the Prague Spring</p>
<p>in Czechoslovakia,</p>
<p>if a nation wants to leave socialism,</p>
<p>it is incumbent on those socialist nations</p>
<p>to do whatever is necessary</p>
<p>to make sure there isn&rsquo;t a counter-revolution.</p>
<p>So they were very much under Moscow&rsquo;s thumb.</p>
<p>And one of the big ways it changed was one man,</p>
<p>and that was Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>And he was the first Russian leader</p>
<p>to be born after the October Revolution.</p>
<p>He grew up and his grandfather was arrested</p>
<p>for being a Trotskyite.</p>
<p>And the other one was arrested for this or that.</p>
<p>He saw his village starve as a result of Stalin.</p>
<p>So even though he was a very committed communist,</p>
<p>he also was very and increasingly skeptical</p>
<p>of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>And in Poland, for example, you had the Solidarity Movement.</p>
<p>And this was a labor union movement.</p>
<p>And the government didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>They were getting a lot of support from the peoples.</p>
<p>They had strikes that,</p>
<p>and the Gdansk Shipyard was one of them started.</p>
<p>And basically Moscow told them,</p>
<p>either you crack down or we&rsquo;re cracking down on you.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, all right.</p>
<p>And they declared martial law</p>
<p>and the rest of the leaders put them away.</p>
<p>But then when Gorbachev was in charge,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a gun to their back.</p>
<p>And it was the communist leaders themselves</p>
<p>who were like, you know what?</p>
<p>There was this really funny moment</p>
<p>where Lech Walesa is meeting with Margaret Thatcher</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling her what solidarity the movement wants.</p>
<p>And she had been meeting with the Polish government as well.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, look, tell them like what,</p>
<p>cause they had, you tried,</p>
<p>they wanted, the government wanted her to tell them</p>
<p>that we want to negotiate and work things out.</p>
<p>She goes, all right, tell the government</p>
<p>what it is that you&rsquo;re asking for.</p>
<p>And he just points to the ceiling.</p>
<p>She goes, he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, our meetings are bugged anyway</p>
<p>but they then had the freedom</p>
<p>because they knew that Gorbachev wasn&rsquo;t forcing them</p>
<p>to drive solidarity underground.</p>
<p>So they had the idea of like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s work together with these people.</p>
<p>And as a result of this, you know,</p>
<p>Poland liberalized and freed itself fairly easily.</p>
<p>And with a minimum of bloodshed in 89.</p>
<p>And there was this whole argument for the Vietnam War</p>
<p>was something called domino theory,</p>
<p>which is if you lose Vietnam, then you&rsquo;re gonna lose Laos.</p>
<p>Then you lose Cambodia.</p>
<p>One by one, the country&rsquo;s gonna turn communist dominoes</p>
<p>but people didn&rsquo;t realize the reverse was true</p>
<p>because after Poland liberalized,</p>
<p>then you have, you know, Hungary,</p>
<p>then you have, you know, Czechoslovakia,</p>
<p>then, you know, you had East Germany</p>
<p>and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great thing because as this is happening,</p>
<p>the people are looking around and they&rsquo;re like, wait,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>Like, this has gotta be a trick.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a trick.</p>
<p>So one of my favorite books,</p>
<p>which was a big inspiration for this one</p>
<p>was by my favorite historian.</p>
<p>I apologize to Victor Petrusha,</p>
<p>David Petrusha and Arthur Herman, my second and third.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tied.</p>
<p>But Victor Sebastian wrote a book called Revolution 1989.</p>
<p>And he just talked about that year</p>
<p>and how all these countries one after another liberalized.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such a,</p>
<p>and none of them thought this was possible.</p>
<p>One of my favorite, favorite moments in this book</p>
<p>is Helmut Kohl, who was the head of West Germany</p>
<p>is in Warsaw with Lech Walesa discussing the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>And Lech Walesa is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be around</p>
<p>for like another, you know, few years.</p>
<p>And Helmut Kohl laughs in his face.</p>
<p>And he goes, look, you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t how things work.</p>
<p>Like this is gonna take some doing.</p>
<p>It fell the next day.</p>
<p>And Helmut Kohl literally says, I&rsquo;m at the wrong party.</p>
<p>And he got in a plane and got out of Warsaw.</p>
<p>So there are, why this book has a broader message</p>
<p>than the actual stories of these incidents</p>
<p>is that as these wonderful things are happening,</p>
<p>the universal consensus at the time is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Or if it does gonna happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen only through an enormous amount</p>
<p>of carnage and blood.</p>
<p>And when it doesn&rsquo;t, then everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, it was inevitable.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say it was inevitable at the time.</p>
<p>You only said it was inevitable after the fact.</p>
<p>And the other thing that was really brought me a lot of joy</p>
<p>is there are so many moments of men with guns</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;re not shooting anyone</p>
<p>because they wanted several Tiananmen Squares.</p>
<p>They wanted it in East Berlin.</p>
<p>They wanted it in Romania.</p>
<p>They wanted it in Moscow.</p>
<p>And these strong, tough, trained men with guns were like,</p>
<p>no, we&rsquo;re not shooting the civilians.</p>
<p>And then everything else was history.</p>
<p>Yeah, just as surprising as the mass violence</p>
<p>committed by like police and the army on its own citizenry,</p>
<p>equally surprising is when they choose not to somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>How do you explain 1989?</p>
<p>How do you explain this progress that happened so suddenly?</p>
<p>How do you explain that at the beginning</p>
<p>of the 20th century, so much revolution happened</p>
<p>that created communism?</p>
<p>And how do you explain then the collapse of that</p>
<p>across so many nations at the same time?</p>
<p>I think a large part of it had to do</p>
<p>with the closer interconnections</p>
<p>between people like Gorbachev and Thatcher</p>
<p>and Gorbachev and Reagan,</p>
<p>because both of them visited Red Square.</p>
<p>And in the years before, these are enemies.</p>
<p>They wanna invade, they wanna kill us.</p>
<p>The Americans thought this about the Russians.</p>
<p>The Russians thought this about the Americans,</p>
<p>obviously not so much the British.</p>
<p>And they got on really well.</p>
<p>When Gorbachev came to Chequers,</p>
<p>which is the prime minister&rsquo;s countryside estate,</p>
<p>Thatcher sat him down and she&rsquo;s lecturing him</p>
<p>about human rights and she&rsquo;s lecturing him about economics</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s lecturing him about this and that.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;s lecturing him about why he isn&rsquo;t eating</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s yelling at her.</p>
<p>And he goes, Mrs. Thatcher,</p>
<p>I know you have a lot of strong opinions.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been sent here to recruit you</p>
<p>to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>And she just started laughing.</p>
<p>But right away, there was such a sense in the air</p>
<p>of we can do better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re spending all this money on missiles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re spending all this money on the military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>And for what?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to be looking at each other as enemies.</p>
<p>We can try to work together to kind of, at the very least,</p>
<p>lower the volume and the heat.</p>
<p>How much credit do you give to Gorbachev the man?</p>
<p>So meaning, how much power does a single individual have?</p>
<p>I could not give him more credit.</p>
<p>I had a tweet last year where I said,</p>
<p>who do you think is the greatest person alive right now?</p>
<p>And my answer by far would be Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Then he died.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just funny because Gorbachev also had a tweet.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>But it was, it was my favorite.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, sure.</p>
<p>That would be a good, now I wish I interviewed Gorbachev</p>
<p>and asked him the famous question</p>
<p>of what would you like best about Michael Malice?</p>
<p>Look, the transition after the Soviet Union fell</p>
<p>to Russia and Yeltsin was not a smooth one by any means.</p>
<p>As I say at the end of the book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>But my point, broader point is you take the wins</p>
<p>when you can get them.</p>
<p>People now had access to passports.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to have, they can leave the country.</p>
<p>They have food.</p>
<p>They have access to information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat censored, but it&rsquo;s certainly nothing</p>
<p>like it was under the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t have to live in this kind of constant fear.</p>
<p>And they had opportunities and it&rsquo;s such a step forward.</p>
<p>And there was this one great moment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a super, Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also mayor of Moscow at one point</p>
<p>or the equivalent of mayor.</p>
<p>And he came here to visit NASA</p>
<p>in the capacity of one or the other.</p>
<p>And while he was there, he went to visit a supermarket.</p>
<p>It was a Randall&rsquo;s then, I think it&rsquo;s a food town now.</p>
<p>It still exists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start bawling.</p>
<p>And as he&rsquo;s looking around,</p>
<p>like he had never seen so much food.</p>
<p>And this is food that like even wealthy people</p>
<p>in Russia don&rsquo;t have access to.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s pictures of him just like this, like what?</p>
<p>And the scene that really was poignant to me</p>
<p>is on his flight back,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sitting there on the plane like this.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, they had to lie to the people</p>
<p>because if they knew,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get away with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the moment where it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>oh, this wasn&rsquo;t like skewed propaganda.</p>
<p>This was like, they knew and it was a lie from A to Z.</p>
<p>And he was just like, holy crap.</p>
<p>And you can just imagine him on that plane,</p>
<p>his brain reprogramming.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re taught since you&rsquo;re a kid,</p>
<p>and he was an older man, he was no dummy.</p>
<p>You think, okay, the Americans are starving and poor</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re lynching people every day.</p>
<p>And then you go to a supermarket,</p>
<p>the most banal place on earth.</p>
<p>And you see, I think one of the articles said like,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t believe how big the onions were</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing these like janitors, school teachers,</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t dignitaries.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re regular people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just picking whatever they want.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just like, it&rsquo;s like the equivalent</p>
<p>of having a stroke.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think that that&rsquo;s one of the most powerful things</p>
<p>is the grocery store.</p>
<p>In terms of drawing a distinction between the two systems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you could have like technology,</p>
<p>you can show off technology and so on,</p>
<p>but you can kind of sign right off technology is like,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s the mechanism of the devil.</p>
<p>But when you look at just,</p>
<p>fruit and veggies and like very big fruit and veggies</p>
<p>and like, yeah, and fruit in particular,</p>
<p>like certain kinds of fruit</p>
<p>that are just not available in Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, yeah, that really shows, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, like when you&rsquo;re older</p>
<p>and you have to face the reality</p>
<p>that what you believe to be true,</p>
<p>that your whole life has been based on a set of lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Not mistakes, not like a little bit,</p>
<p>like blatant lies from top to bottom, start to finish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>How much you&rsquo;ve, you start the book,</p>
<p>I think you started the book with Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As one does.</p>
<p>So before the revolution, she was born in Russia</p>
<p>and she witnessed the revolution</p>
<p>and moved to the United States in the 20?</p>
<p>26, 26, yeah.</p>
<p>26, I remember like it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Anyway, she, you write that she spent a lot of her life</p>
<p>trying to convince Americans in the world</p>
<p>that the negative effects of totalitarian government,</p>
<p>just maybe using her as an example,</p>
<p>but also this question,</p>
<p>can we draw a distinction</p>
<p>between authoritarian regimes and communism?</p>
<p>Is it possible to steel man the case</p>
<p>that not all implementations of socialism and communism</p>
<p>would lead to the atrocities we&rsquo;ve seen in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and in China under Mao?</p>
<p>Like when you, in studying all of this,</p>
<p>how much blame do you put on the ideologies,</p>
<p>on the Marxist ideologies</p>
<p>versus the particular leaders and dictators?</p>
<p>Well, you have to blame the leaders a lot</p>
<p>because they had different leaders</p>
<p>in different countries were different from each other.</p>
<p>Dupchik, who took over Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>and he tried to introduce socialism with a human face</p>
<p>in the Prague Spring of 1968,</p>
<p>he was like, all right,</p>
<p>we got to do away with this authoritarianism.</p>
<p>We got to have more free speech.</p>
<p>He was thinking of introducing elements of democracy.</p>
<p>Now then the Russians sent in the tanks,</p>
<p>but the point is he certainly was someone who was like,</p>
<p>all right, this has got to stop.</p>
<p>This is just absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>Khrushchev and Stalin were not the same animal at all.</p>
<p>So I think the problem with communism in the Marxist sense</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re going to have an introduce</p>
<p>an element of authoritarianism</p>
<p>simply because you can&rsquo;t have economic planning.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have a price mechanism,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how price is what is me knowing</p>
<p>as a consumer or a producer,</p>
<p>what should be produced or what there&rsquo;s a shortage of.</p>
<p>As prices increase,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a signal that we have a shortage here.</p>
<p>As prices decrease,</p>
<p>that means that there&rsquo;s a surplus here.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m setting the price,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how much weed I need to produce</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m compared to corn, as compared to shoes,</p>
<p>as compared to Santa costumes.</p>
<p>So that is a big problem.</p>
<p>The other issue is if you have one agency,</p>
<p>the government having a monopoly on let&rsquo;s suppose the news,</p>
<p>like you were talking about earlier with Twitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be really hard</p>
<p>to have any kind of objective discourse</p>
<p>because everyone is going to be working</p>
<p>for the same organization.</p>
<p>That is going to cause a problem</p>
<p>in terms of having a feedback mechanism,</p>
<p>even in the best scenario in terms of this is a problem,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>And when you have a monopoly,</p>
<p>which is what a government is,</p>
<p>I think people are very familiar</p>
<p>with what the problems happen with monopoly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of accountability.</p>
<p>Bureaucracies are faceless and then no one&rsquo;s to blame,</p>
<p>but and yet everyone kind of suffers as a consequence.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p>as authoritarian as Stalinism,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t have a government,</p>
<p>which is authority by its nature,</p>
<p>be this pervasive without a strong amount of oppression.</p>
<p>Same thing with even if you just have like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say socialized healthcare,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to make it illegal</p>
<p>for doctors to practice privately.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to have rationing,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now that might be a price that people are willing to pay</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t have infinite spending</p>
<p>on healthcare, right?</p>
<p>So something&rsquo;s going to have to give somewhere.</p>
<p>So there is an element of authoritarianism there</p>
<p>and people are comfortable with that</p>
<p>and I can wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to have one organization</p>
<p>running literally everything in society,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how you do that</p>
<p>and have any measure of liberalism.</p>
<p>Why do you think Ayn Rand had so much trouble</p>
<p>telling people the danger of Soviet Stalinism?</p>
<p>Well, I think a more pertinent question</p>
<p>is why did Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman</p>
<p>have so much problems?</p>
<p>So they were hardcore.</p>
<p>These are anarchists.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re Emma Goldman&rsquo;s on the cover.</p>
<p>They were deported from the US.</p>
<p>J. Edgar Hoover saw them off at Ellis Island.</p>
<p>They were sent to Russia.</p>
<p>They were bloodthirsty revolutionaries.</p>
<p>They had no shortage advocating violence when necessary.</p>
<p>And when they went there,</p>
<p>they were just like, this is a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>They both individually had meetings with Lenin,</p>
<p>complaining about political prisoners,</p>
<p>complaining about lack of free speech.</p>
<p>He told them, this is a revolutionary time.</p>
<p>You could do that later.</p>
<p>And when they both left,</p>
<p>she wrote, her memoir was split into two books,</p>
<p>My Disillusionment in Russia</p>
<p>and My Third Disillusionment in Russia.</p>
<p>He wrote The Bolshevik Myth.</p>
<p>And she was in England and she gave a speech.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>if you guys think this is for the workers,</p>
<p>this is the biggest lie I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re oppressing the workers</p>
<p>like no capitalist has ever imagined.</p>
<p>And as she described it,</p>
<p>people were just shifting their seats.</p>
<p>They were interrupting her.</p>
<p>And when she opened her talk,</p>
<p>she had a standing ovation.</p>
<p>And when she was done, you could hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t wanna hear it</p>
<p>because this was this kind of,</p>
<p>and Eugene Lyons talks about it later.</p>
<p>This was like the guinea pig theory of the Russian people.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re gonna experiment on them over there.</p>
<p>If it works, great, we&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;s their problem.</p>
<p>And sure, these animals squeal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re beneath us.</p>
<p>And of course they&rsquo;re gonna make some noise,</p>
<p>but this is a noble experiment,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re experimenting on a country, several countries.</p>
<p>So I think an ideology like this,</p>
<p>which appeals to intellectuals,</p>
<p>because if it works or if it&rsquo;s implemented,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who are gods in effect in a society.</p>
<p>Like their status cannot be higher.</p>
<p>They really want this to work.</p>
<p>Like they want a society where they are the new aristocracy,</p>
<p>the most important people.</p>
<p>And their criticisms of America,</p>
<p>if they had a binary worldview,</p>
<p>if America&rsquo;s bad and this is the opposite of America,</p>
<p>then by definition, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And the other binary that they bought into</p>
<p>is the Nazis and the fascists hate the communists</p>
<p>and the communists, it&rsquo;s true, up to a point,</p>
<p>hated the fascists and the Nazis.</p>
<p>Okay, well, Hitler is evil,</p>
<p>so this guy&rsquo;s against Hitler, we&rsquo;re with him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an argument that&rsquo;s still made</p>
<p>in schools growing up,</p>
<p>when you talk about World War II,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, we team up with Stalin,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really talk about Stalin being a bad guy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, we worked with him to fight Hitler</p>
<p>because Hitler was a unique evil.</p>
<p>Now, that is certainly true that Hitler&rsquo;s a unique evil,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean or even imply</p>
<p>that Stalin is somehow an angel or a saint.</p>
<p>Do you think some of the lessons of history</p>
<p>are forgotten here in our modern political discourse</p>
<p>that are important to remember?</p>
<p>I was so triggered because I was in the supermarket</p>
<p>and there was like a company that&rsquo;s selling Russian ice cream</p>
<p>because it meets these high level Soviet standards.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, you think this is some kind of joke?</p>
<p>You think this is some kind of kitschy punchline</p>
<p>that you had decades of people who were taught in school</p>
<p>to turn their parents into the police</p>
<p>if they were hoarding grain,</p>
<p>even if it cost them their own lives,</p>
<p>where it was a crime to be married to someone</p>
<p>who was an enemy of the state,</p>
<p>where you had torture being the norm,</p>
<p>where people were institutionalized</p>
<p>because they were politically disadvantageous</p>
<p>and they were called insane?</p>
<p>Like, this isn&rsquo;t just like, oh, this hammer and sickles,</p>
<p>this cool, wacky symbol.</p>
<p>Like, the amount of blood under this symbol</p>
<p>was just enormous.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think the lesson</p>
<p>has very much been forgotten.</p>
<p>How did the ice cream taste?</p>
<p>It was fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Baskin-Robbins guy, to be honest,</p>
<p>but Van Leeuwen&rsquo;s does some great work.</p>
<p>Baskin-Robbins doesn&rsquo;t have any Soviet flavors?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Those are dark jokes, dark jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna self-publish a book of jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming out in a grocery store near you.</p>
<p>Okay, what was the hardest part about writing this book?</p>
<p>Spent two years writing it?</p>
<p>So, when I write books for celebrities</p>
<p>and I was co-authoring them,</p>
<p>I did it kind of like method acting.</p>
<p>I tried to get into their head as much as possible</p>
<p>to kind of speak in their voice.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re dealing with children being tortured</p>
<p>harmed, starved, and you&rsquo;re trying to empathize</p>
<p>with the characters, it&rsquo;s hard to take.</p>
<p>The other big part I had, like I was saying earlier,</p>
<p>is just, I was just very, very concerned</p>
<p>that I told this story and that it did it justice.</p>
<p>Because I think this is something that is,</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand, and I&rsquo;m kind of angry about it,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s fallen on me to tell this story.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t some minor incident that happened</p>
<p>in some random town in, pick a state.</p>
<p>This is half the world for 70, 80 years.</p>
<p>And the fact that it&rsquo;s, this is the 80s, this isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, you and I are old enough to remember the 80s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a show, I remember the 80s.</p>
<p>The fact that all these things have just kind of,</p>
<p>we have this collective amnesia, and even amnesia,</p>
<p>I think a lot of this stuff was not known even at the time</p>
<p>or was kind of obscured.</p>
<p>This is, I remember I was at The Blaze,</p>
<p>which is a network run by Glenn Beck,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re conservatives, and I have a lot of fun there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just sitting there, and sometimes they veer off.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, Biden&rsquo;s a communist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, okay, Biden&rsquo;s a communist.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, we talk so much about slavery</p>
<p>and the Civil War, the atrocities.</p>
<p>We talk about World War II and the Holocaust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how is no one talking about this?</p>
<p>And this can very easily be portrayed</p>
<p>as conservatism&rsquo;s big victory,</p>
<p>because Reagan and Thatcher were so instrumental</p>
<p>in guiding this to a safe landing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, how is no one telling this story?</p>
<p>And then one day, my brain is like,</p>
<p>you know, you write books for a living.</p>
<p>This is kind of your job.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, but I still don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I still, I gotta tell you, I&rsquo;m kind of confused</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the one who has to do this,</p>
<p>because this should be, there should be, you know,</p>
<p>there should be 30 books like this.</p>
<p>And this is a model to follow.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s also that it&rsquo;s such recent history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it also kind of makes you realize</p>
<p>that there might be other fights</p>
<p>for progress going on right now.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>In a world that we don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>So you wrote about North Korea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know to what degree there is,</p>
<p>could possibly be fights there for progress,</p>
<p>but there could be, they could be boiling up.</p>
<p>In China, there could be boiling up battles for progress.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world, Russia, there could be.</p>
<p>And in America.</p>
<p>And in America.</p>
<p>And these are all different kind of battles for progress.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all, sometimes,</p>
<p>sometimes I, you know,</p>
<p>we sometimes tend to criticize these battles for progress.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s on the left,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it like woke-ism or whatever.</p>
<p>And we pick extreme elements of it</p>
<p>and show how silly and ridiculous it is.</p>
<p>Not realizing it, not acknowledging</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a more civil battle going on underneath</p>
<p>for actual, for respecting human dignity</p>
<p>from all people for all walks of life.</p>
<p>And the same, we tend to call anybody</p>
<p>who questions mainstream narratives, conspiracy theorists,</p>
<p>we dismiss them immediately.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re ultimately fighting for progress.</p>
<p>So people who criticize Fauci and everybody else,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I think they want institutions that serve the public.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fighting for progress too.</p>
<p>And we tend to dismiss them.</p>
<p>Like each side tends to caricature the other.</p>
<p>But the battle for progress is happening.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hopeful message with the white pill, right?</p>
<p>Is that there&rsquo;s progress being made.</p>
<p>Somehow we&rsquo;re all making progress here.</p>
<p>I think more the hopeful message is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not possible that we have to lose.</p>
<p>Like if someone tells you the straight face, you can&rsquo;t win,</p>
<p>the enemy is too impressive and strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, look, this was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And it happened relatively quickly</p>
<p>and relatively peacefully.</p>
<p>I mean, again, and it wasn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>Honecker in East Germany was like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m just gonna vacate my seat.</p>
<p>He was like sending the tanks and the military guy said no.</p>
<p>So they wanted blood.</p>
<p>There were plenty of people who wanted blood</p>
<p>and would have been happy to have it.</p>
<p>So to you, maybe if not the fall of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>then the fall of the Iron Curtain</p>
<p>is a great leap of progress in the 20th century.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how anyone can argue against that point</p>
<p>with a straight face.</p>
<p>So that gives you hope that we humanity</p>
<p>were able to do that.</p>
<p>Yes, and at the same time, we were told at the time,</p>
<p>give it up, be realistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s utopian to think this is going anywhere,</p>
<p>maybe in 100 years.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a reason Chekhov was on Star Trek</p>
<p>because the idea is even the far future,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have America</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Like this is the reality.</p>
<p>It was called real politic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have detente</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this permanent stalemate.</p>
<p>We had the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>We got our asses kicked.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>We got to learn to live with each other, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And Reagan said, you don&rsquo;t wanna hear my strategy</p>
<p>for the Cold War.</p>
<p>Some people might say it&rsquo;s simple or even simplistic.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>We win, they lose.</p>
<p>And the people who won were the Russian people</p>
<p>and the Ukrainian people and the Lithuanian people</p>
<p>and the Polish people and the Romanian people especially</p>
<p>and the Hungarian people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s so many moments of great joy</p>
<p>that just tears coming down my face</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like in Prague when Dubcek,</p>
<p>again, who tried to liberalize in 1968</p>
<p>and then when they send the tanks,</p>
<p>they deport him to Slovakia somewhere</p>
<p>to do some forestry job.</p>
<p>Like he appears in their big squares</p>
<p>just waving from the balcony</p>
<p>like this ghost from 20 years prior being like,</p>
<p>look, the spirit of 68 is still alive here</p>
<p>in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>And it was like a matter of weeks,</p>
<p>the entire government resigned and then they liberalized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so many things about just overnight</p>
<p>just change for the profound better.</p>
<p>And people are so committed</p>
<p>to making sure you don&rsquo;t have hope.</p>
<p>And if things get better, oh, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>because the broader picture never gets better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of data to the contrary</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s happened before.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t some magical faraway place.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of magical faraway place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And to me, I think one such narrative</p>
<p>that people assume will always be true</p>
<p>or just to a degree will always be true</p>
<p>like in American politics</p>
<p>is the extreme levels of division.</p>
<p>And it seems to me like that too, we can overcome.</p>
<p>So the division in American politics</p>
<p>that seems to be counterproductive,</p>
<p>I think that can be overcome.</p>
<p>And I think the division in geopolitics currently</p>
<p>with Russia, China, and the United States,</p>
<p>particularly China and the United States can be overcome.</p>
<p>And I think that requires great leadership</p>
<p>that galvanizes the populace</p>
<p>to the better angels of their nature.</p>
<p>Like I have hope for that.</p>
<p>People have become really cynical on social media</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the way they talk.</p>
<p>The liberals are destroying this country.</p>
<p>The conservatives are destroying this country.</p>
<p>This kind of language is becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I have hope that that&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s my white pill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have that kind of hope for,</p>
<p>like what does hope look like for you in American politics?</p>
<p>Forget American politics, American, the nation,</p>
<p>the country, the people.</p>
<p>My hope, which I don&rsquo;t think is an unrealistic one,</p>
<p>is that the next generation has a better life</p>
<p>than you and I have had in this country.</p>
<p>And I think anyone who thinks that America is over</p>
<p>or is one president away from being destroyed</p>
<p>cannot in good conscience call themselves a patriot.</p>
<p>Because if you think America is so weak</p>
<p>that it takes a Biden or a Trump or an Obama</p>
<p>to irrevocably destroy it, then it&rsquo;s already a wrap.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you look what this country has survived,</p>
<p>Great Depression, World War II, the Civil War.</p>
<p>I mean, my God.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been through worse before.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always easy, certainly not.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so hard for me as someone who&rsquo;s a hopeful person,</p>
<p>not by my nature, I&rsquo;m not Michael Kindness</p>
<p>who does work for Random House,</p>
<p>or at least he did last time I talked to him.</p>
<p>I look at even like, the thing is when you speak positively,</p>
<p>it sounds corny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how screwed up our cynical culture is.</p>
<p>Have you seen my Twitter?</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re verified now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But even like something like Etsy.</p>
<p>Like you can go on Etsy.</p>
<p>I paid $8 for that verification.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>I earned it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity for independent artists</p>
<p>to create something special and cool.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve bought a lot of stuff from them.</p>
<p>That in and of itself is something that&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much, I&rsquo;m into shaving soaps, right?</p>
<p>Of course you are.</p>
<p>The point is, there&rsquo;s like dozens of artisans,</p>
<p>every day when you have a shave, it brings you some joy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just so many things that are wonderful.</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s people listening to this,</p>
<p>rolling their eyes.</p>
<p>How can you talk about shaving soaps when my daughter,</p>
<p>or when my wife, or when blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not disparaging or dismissing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re regarding as a problem.</p>
<p>My point is, hope means the belief</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not at all a certainty</p>
<p>that this problem will be insurmountable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it means.</p>
<p>What do you look forward to in 2023?</p>
<p>Since this is a holiday special.</p>
<p>Honestly, like if I look forward to a lot of young people</p>
<p>realizing that they still have lots of opportunity</p>
<p>in this country and taking control of their own selves</p>
<p>and realizing they can be a better person tomorrow</p>
<p>than they are today, that the entirety of their identity</p>
<p>is not a function of a culture,</p>
<p>which may they may not identify, or government,</p>
<p>which they may not identify with, or like,</p>
<p>or think is deplorable and realize, you know what?</p>
<p>I have it in me to improve and find joy and happiness.</p>
<p>And also the fact that that is so compelling and contagious.</p>
<p>That is what I would want in 2023.</p>
<p>And also for New York to get nuked.</p>
<p>So those two things could be accomplished.</p>
<p>Can I go back and switch the order?</p>
<p>Because I think New York won.</p>
<p>Oh, the jokes, the jokes.</p>
<p>And one day, friends, if you work hard enough</p>
<p>in believing in yourself.</p>
<p>You too can nuke New York.</p>
<p>No, you too can spend your time</p>
<p>days dressing up.</p>
<p>Grown men dressing up in a Santa outfit</p>
<p>and putting on lipstick and having hours upon hours</p>
<p>of conversation with each other and loving every second.</p>
<p>Thank you for writing this really, really important book.</p>
<p>Please buy the white pill.</p>
<p>I love you, brother.</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
