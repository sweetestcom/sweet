    <p>The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist, futurist,</p>
<p>and professor at the City College of New York.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of many fascinating books</p>
<p>that explore the nature of our reality</p>
<p>and the future of our civilization.</p>
<p>They include Einstein&rsquo;s Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,</p>
<p>Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,</p>
<p>and his latest, The Future of Humanity,</p>
<p>Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,</p>
<p>Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful and important</p>
<p>when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore</p>
<p>through conversation subjects</p>
<p>just outside of our understanding.</p>
<p>That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,</p>
<p>just outside of our understanding,</p>
<p>a place we have to reach for</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re to uncover the mysteries of the human mind</p>
<p>and build human level and superhuman level AI systems</p>
<p>that transform our world for the better.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michio Kaku.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that we just might make contact</p>
<p>with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?</p>
<p>Well, this is pure speculation, of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Given the fact that we&rsquo;ve already identified</p>
<p>4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,</p>
<p>and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy</p>
<p>for the first time,</p>
<p>we know that on average, every single star, on average,</p>
<p>has a planet going around it,</p>
<p>and about one fifth or so of them</p>
<p>have Earth sized planets going around them.</p>
<p>So just do the math.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about out of 100 billion stars</p>
<p>in the Milky Way galaxy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about billions</p>
<p>of potential Earth sized planets.</p>
<p>And to believe that we&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.</p>
<p>And how many galaxies are there?</p>
<p>Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,</p>
<p>there are about 100 billion galaxies.</p>
<p>So do the math.</p>
<p>How many stars are there in the visible universe?</p>
<p>100 billion galaxies,</p>
<p>times 100 billion stars per galaxy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a number beyond human imagination.</p>
<p>And to believe that we&rsquo;re the only ones,</p>
<p>I think, is rather ridiculous.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about different types of,</p>
<p>type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,</p>
<p>even, of the Kardashev scale</p>
<p>of the different kind of civilizations.</p>
<p>What do you think it takes,</p>
<p>if it is indeed a ridiculous notion</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re alone in the universe,</p>
<p>what do you think it takes to reach out?</p>
<p>First, to reach out through communication and connect.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, we have to understand</p>
<p>the level of sophistication of an alien life form</p>
<p>if we make contact with them.</p>
<p>I think in this century, we&rsquo;ll probably pick up signals,</p>
<p>signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll pick up there, I love Lucy,</p>
<p>and there, leave it to Beaver.</p>
<p>Just ordinary day to day transmissions</p>
<p>that they emit.</p>
<p>And the first thing we wanna do is to A,</p>
<p>decipher their language, of course,</p>
<p>but B, figure out at what level they are advanced</p>
<p>on the Kardashev scale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a physicist.</p>
<p>We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we rank black holes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we rank stars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we rank civilizations in outer space.</p>
<p>So a type one civilization is capable</p>
<p>of harnessing planetary power.</p>
<p>They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.</p>
<p>They can modify the course of geological events,</p>
<p>sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.</p>
<p>Type two would be stellar.</p>
<p>They play with stars, entire stars.</p>
<p>They use the entire energy output of a star,</p>
<p>sort of like Star Trek.</p>
<p>The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.</p>
<p>So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.</p>
<p>Type three would be galactic.</p>
<p>They roam the galactic space lanes.</p>
<p>And type three would be like Star Wars,</p>
<p>a galactic civilization.</p>
<p>Now, one day I was giving this talk in London</p>
<p>at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me</p>
<p>and he says, professor, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong, there&rsquo;s type four.</p>
<p>And I told him, look, kid,</p>
<p>there are planets, stars, and galaxies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks.</p>
<p>And he kept persisting and saying, no, there&rsquo;s type four,</p>
<p>the power of the continuum.</p>
<p>And I thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>And I said to myself,</p>
<p>is there an extra galactic source of energy,</p>
<p>the continuum of Star Trek?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s dark energy.</p>
<p>We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe</p>
<p>is dark energy.</p>
<p>Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,</p>
<p>and we only represent 4%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the oddballs.</p>
<p>And so you begin to realize that, yeah,</p>
<p>there could be type four, maybe even type five.</p>
<p>So type four, you&rsquo;re saying being able to harness</p>
<p>sort of like dark energy,</p>
<p>something that permeates the entire universe.</p>
<p>So be able to plug into the entire universe</p>
<p>as a source of energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why the galaxies are being pushed apart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the energy of nothing.</p>
<p>The more nothing you have,</p>
<p>the more dark energy that&rsquo;s repulsive.</p>
<p>And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating</p>
<p>because the more you have, the more you can have.</p>
<p>And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a de Sitter expansion,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the current state of the universe.</p>
<p>And then type five, would that be able to seek</p>
<p>energy sources somehow outside of our universe?</p>
<p>And how crazy is that idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.</p>
<p>Multiverse, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a quantum physicist,</p>
<p>and we quantum physicists don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that the Big Bang happened once.</p>
<p>That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>And that means that there could be multiple bangs</p>
<p>happening all the time.</p>
<p>Even as we speak today,</p>
<p>universes are being created, and that fits the data.</p>
<p>The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain finite probability</p>
<p>that universes are being created all the time.</p>
<p>And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing</p>
<p>because I was raised as a Presbyterian,</p>
<p>but my parents were Buddhists.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two diametrically opposed ideas</p>
<p>about the universe.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, there&rsquo;s only nirvana.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no beginning, there&rsquo;s no end,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only timelessness.</p>
<p>But in Christianity, there is the instant</p>
<p>when God said, let there be light.</p>
<p>In other words, an instant of creation.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,</p>
<p>and I now realize that it&rsquo;s possible to meld them</p>
<p>into a single theory.</p>
<p>Either the universe had a beginning or it didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>You see, our universe had a beginning.</p>
<p>Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,</p>
<p>let there be light.</p>
<p>But there are other bubble universes out there</p>
<p>in a bubble bath of universes.</p>
<p>And that means that these universes are expanding</p>
<p>into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.</p>
<p>In other words, hyperspace.</p>
<p>In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.</p>
<p>So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace</p>
<p>where big bangs are happening all the time.</p>
<p>So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories</p>
<p>of creation.</p>
<p>And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,</p>
<p>even said that this is an argument</p>
<p>against the existence of God.</p>
<p>He said there is no God because there was not enough time</p>
<p>for God to create the universe</p>
<p>because the big bang happened in an instant of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, there was no time available</p>
<p>for him to create the universe.</p>
<p>But you see, the multiverse idea</p>
<p>means that there was a time before time.</p>
<p>And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.</p>
<p>And so it means that there could actually be a universe</p>
<p>before the beginning of our universe.</p>
<p>So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,</p>
<p>or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the big bang.</p>
<p>So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes</p>
<p>or the budding of universes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful picture</p>
<p>of our incredibly mysterious existence.</p>
<p>So is that humbling to you?</p>
<p>Exciting, the idea of multiverses?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to even begin</p>
<p>to wrap my mind around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting for me</p>
<p>because what I do for a living is string theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my day job.</p>
<p>I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.</p>
<p>And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.</p>
<p>So people say, first of all, what is string theory?</p>
<p>String theory simply says that all the particles</p>
<p>we see in nature, the electron, the proton,</p>
<p>the quarks, what have you,</p>
<p>are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,</p>
<p>on a tiny, tiny little string.</p>
<p>You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,</p>
<p>the creator of the atomic bomb,</p>
<p>was so frustrated in the 1950s</p>
<p>with all these subatomic particles being created</p>
<p>in our atom smashers that he announced,</p>
<p>he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics</p>
<p>should go to the physicist</p>
<p>who does not discover a new particle that year.</p>
<p>Well, today we think they&rsquo;re nothing but musical notes</p>
<p>on these tiny little vibrating strings.</p>
<p>So what is physics?</p>
<p>Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.</p>
<p>What is chemistry?</p>
<p>Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.</p>
<p>What is the universe?</p>
<p>The universe is a symphony of strings.</p>
<p>And then what is the mind of God</p>
<p>that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about</p>
<p>for the last 30 years of his life?</p>
<p>The mind of God would be cosmic music,</p>
<p>resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.</p>
<p>So beautifully put.</p>
<p>What do you think is the mind of Einstein&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a why that we could untangle</p>
<p>from this universe of strings?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>once said that the more we learn about the universe,</p>
<p>the more we learn that it&rsquo;s pointless.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t profess to understand</p>
<p>the great secrets of the universe.</p>
<p>However, let me say two things</p>
<p>about what the giants of physics</p>
<p>have said about this question.</p>
<p>Einstein believed in two types of God.</p>
<p>One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,</p>
<p>the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,</p>
<p>performs miracles, smites the Philistines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the personal God that he didn&rsquo;t believe in.</p>
<p>He believed in the God of Spinoza,</p>
<p>the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.</p>
<p>The universe could have been ugly.</p>
<p>The universe could have been messy, random,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>You realize that on a single sheet of paper,</p>
<p>we can write down all the known laws of the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, on one sheet of paper,</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s equation is one inch long,</p>
<p>string theory is a lot longer,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s a standard model,</p>
<p>but you could put all these equations</p>
<p>on one sheet of paper.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>It could have been messy.</p>
<p>And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy</p>
<p>entering this huge library for the first time,</p>
<p>being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,</p>
<p>and beauty of this library,</p>
<p>but all he could do was read the first page</p>
<p>of the first volume.</p>
<p>Well, that library is the universe,</p>
<p>with all sorts of mysterious, magical things</p>
<p>that we have yet to find.</p>
<p>And then Galileo was asked about this.</p>
<p>Galileo said that the purpose of science,</p>
<p>the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.</p>
<p>The purpose of religion is to determine</p>
<p>how to go to heaven.</p>
<p>So in other words, science is about natural law,</p>
<p>and religion is about ethics,</p>
<p>how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.</p>
<p>As long as we keep these two things apart,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in great shape.</p>
<p>The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences</p>
<p>begin to pontificate about ethics,</p>
<p>and people from religion begin to pontificate</p>
<p>about natural law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we get into big trouble.</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re fundamentally distinct,</p>
<p>morality and ethics and our idea of what is right</p>
<p>and what is wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s outside the reach</p>
<p>of string theory and physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you talk to a squirrel about what is right</p>
<p>and what is wrong, there&rsquo;s no reference frame</p>
<p>for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,</p>
<p>if they ever come visit us, they&rsquo;ll try to talk to us</p>
<p>like we talk to squirrels in the forest,</p>
<p>but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t talk back to us.</p>
<p>Same thing with aliens from outer space.</p>
<p>They come down to earth, they&rsquo;ll be curious about us</p>
<p>to a degree, but after a while they just get bored</p>
<p>because we have nothing to offer them.</p>
<p>So our sense of right and wrong,</p>
<p>what does that mean compared to a squirrel&rsquo;s sense</p>
<p>of right and wrong?</p>
<p>Now we of course do have an ethics</p>
<p>that keeps civilizations in line,</p>
<p>enriches our life and makes civilization possible.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not mandated by a law of physics.</p>
<p>So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,</p>
<p>forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re more likely to be friendly,</p>
<p>to befriend us or to destroy us?</p>
<p>Well, I think for the most part,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pretty much ignore us.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?</p>
<p>Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?</p>
<p>Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?</p>
<p>Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer</p>
<p>about to basically flatten the entire forest,</p>
<p>destroying your livelihood.</p>
<p>So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,</p>
<p>but actually the problem with deers in the forest</p>
<p>is that they should fear developers</p>
<p>because developers look at deer as simply</p>
<p>getting in the way.</p>
<p>I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,</p>
<p>the aliens did not hate us.</p>
<p>If you read the book,</p>
<p>the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.</p>
<p>No, we were in the way.</p>
<p>So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations</p>
<p>may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.</p>
<p>However, I personally believe,</p>
<p>and I cannot prove any of this,</p>
<p>I personally believe that they&rsquo;re probably gonna be peaceful</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing that they want from our world.</p>
<p>I mean, what are they gonna take us?</p>
<p>What are they gonna take us for, gold?</p>
<p>No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silver, I mean, it&rsquo;s gold in color,</p>
<p>but that only affects homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Squirrels don&rsquo;t care about gold.</p>
<p>And so gold is a rather useless element.</p>
<p>Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,</p>
<p>rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it for a moment.</p>
<p>People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,</p>
<p>but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,</p>
<p>absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,</p>
<p>I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an alien writing down that very same equation</p>
<p>in different notation,</p>
<p>but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,</p>
<p>Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,</p>
<p>it would mean nothing to him or her or it.</p>
<p>When you think about entities that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look</p>
<p>something that even is recognizable to us as life?</p>
<p>Or would they be radically different?</p>
<p>Well, how did we become intelligent?</p>
<p>Basically three things made us intelligent.</p>
<p>One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.</p>
<p>We have the eyes of a hunter,</p>
<p>stereo vision so we lock in on targets.</p>
<p>And who is smarter, predator or prey?</p>
<p>Predators are smarter than prey.</p>
<p>They have their eyes at the front of their face,</p>
<p>like lions, tigers,</p>
<p>while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Hunters have to zero in on the target.</p>
<p>They have to know how to ambush.</p>
<p>They have to know how to hide, camouflage,</p>
<p>sneak up, stealth, deceit.</p>
<p>That takes a lot of intelligence.</p>
<p>Rabbits, all they have to do is run.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.</p>
<p>Second is the thumb.</p>
<p>The opposable thumb of some sort</p>
<p>could be a claw or a tentacle.</p>
<p>So hand eye coordination.</p>
<p>Hand eye coordination is the way</p>
<p>we manipulate the environment.</p>
<p>And then three, language.</p>
<p>Because mama bear never tells baby bear</p>
<p>to avoid the human hunter.</p>
<p>Bears just learn by themselves.</p>
<p>They never hand out information</p>
<p>from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.</p>
<p>Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb</p>
<p>or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself a simple question.</p>
<p>How many animals have all three?</p>
<p>Just us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just us.</p>
<p>I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,</p>
<p>they may get up to maybe 20 words,</p>
<p>but a baby learns a word a day,</p>
<p>several words a day a baby learns.</p>
<p>And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.</p>
<p>While the maximum number of words</p>
<p>that you can teach a gorilla in any language,</p>
<p>including their own language, is about 20 or so.</p>
<p>And so we see the difference in intelligence.</p>
<p>So when we meet aliens from outer space,</p>
<p>chances are they will have been descended</p>
<p>from predators of some sort.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have some way to manipulate the environment</p>
<p>and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks.</p>
<p>So functionally, that would be similar.</p>
<p>That would, we would be able to recognize them.</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily, because I think</p>
<p>even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually</p>
<p>going to perhaps become part cybernetic</p>
<p>and genetically enhanced.</p>
<p>Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.</p>
<p>But in the coming years,</p>
<p>our robots will be as smart as a mouse,</p>
<p>then maybe as smart as a rabbit.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.</p>
<p>And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,</p>
<p>our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.</p>
<p>Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.</p>
<p>You see, monkeys are self aware.</p>
<p>They know they are monkeys.</p>
<p>They may have a different agenda than us.</p>
<p>While dogs, dogs are confused.</p>
<p>You see, dogs think that we are a dog,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the top dog.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the underdog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they whimper and follow us and lick us</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the top dog.</p>
<p>Monkeys have no illusion at all.</p>
<p>They know we are not monkeys.</p>
<p>And so I think that in the future,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off</p>
<p>once our robots have murderous thoughts.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s in a hundred years.</p>
<p>In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough</p>
<p>to remove that fail safe chip in their brain</p>
<p>and then watch out.</p>
<p>At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,</p>
<p>we should merge with them.</p>
<p>We should become part cybernetic.</p>
<p>So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,</p>
<p>they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.</p>
<p>Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.</p>
<p>Wow, so let&rsquo;s talk about that full range.</p>
<p>In the near term and 200 years from now,</p>
<p>how promising in the near term in your view</p>
<p>is brain machine interfaces?</p>
<p>So starting to allow computers to talk directly</p>
<p>to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other companies working on this idea.</p>
<p>Do you see promise there?</p>
<p>Do you see hope for near term impact?</p>
<p>Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>Already we can record memories.</p>
<p>I have a book, The Future of the Mind,</p>
<p>where I detail some of these breakthroughs.</p>
<p>We can now record simple memories of mice</p>
<p>and send these memories on the internet.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;re gonna do this with primates</p>
<p>at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And then after that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a memory chip for Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll test it out in Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients</p>
<p>because of course, when Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients</p>
<p>lose their memory, they wander.</p>
<p>They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,</p>
<p>oblivious to their surroundings and they&rsquo;ll have a chip.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll push the button and memories,</p>
<p>memories will come flooding into their hippocampus</p>
<p>and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.</p>
<p>And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.</p>
<p>And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.</p>
<p>What is the future of the internet?</p>
<p>The future of the internet is brain net.</p>
<p>Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,</p>
<p>sensations on the internet.</p>
<p>And we will telepathically communicate</p>
<p>with other humans this way.</p>
<p>This is gonna affect everything.</p>
<p>Look at entertainment.</p>
<p>Remember the silent movies?</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin was very famous</p>
<p>during the era of silent movies.</p>
<p>But when the talkies came in,</p>
<p>nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore</p>
<p>because he never talked in the movies.</p>
<p>And so a whole generation of actors lost their job</p>
<p>and a new series of actors came in.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re gonna have the movies replaced by brain net</p>
<p>because in the future, people will say,</p>
<p>who wants to see a screen with images?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Sound and image, that&rsquo;s called the movies.</p>
<p>In our entertainment industry,</p>
<p>this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens</p>
<p>with moving images and sound.</p>
<p>But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,</p>
<p>memories can be conveyed on the internet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna change everything.</p>
<p>Human relations will change</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll be able to empathize</p>
<p>and feel the suffering of other people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be able to communicate telepathically.</p>
<p>And this is coming.</p>
<p>You described brain net and future of the mind.</p>
<p>This is an interesting concept.</p>
<p>Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,</p>
<p>but what kind of effect would it have</p>
<p>on our personal relationships?</p>
<p>Hopefully it will deepen it.</p>
<p>You realize that for most of human history,</p>
<p>for over 90% of human history,</p>
<p>we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks.</p>
<p>That was your tribe.</p>
<p>That was everybody you knew in the universe</p>
<p>was only maybe 50 or 100.</p>
<p>With the coming of towns,</p>
<p>of course it expanded to a few thousand.</p>
<p>With the coming of the telephone,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people</p>
<p>with a telephone.</p>
<p>And now with the internet,</p>
<p>you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.</p>
<p>And so I think this is a normal progression.</p>
<p>And you think that kind of sort of connection</p>
<p>to the rest of the world,</p>
<p>and then adding sensations</p>
<p>like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on</p>
<p>that would just further deepen our connection</p>
<p>to our fellow humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.</p>
<p>Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.</p>
<p>A double edged sword,</p>
<p>one side of the sword can cut against people.</p>
<p>The other side of the sword</p>
<p>can cut against ignorance and disease.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I think technology does have a moral direction.</p>
<p>Look at the internet.</p>
<p>The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,</p>
<p>and that creates empowerment.</p>
<p>People act on knowledge.</p>
<p>When they begin to realize</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have to live that way,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to suffer under a dictatorship,</p>
<p>that there are other ways of living under freedom,</p>
<p>then they begin to take things, take power.</p>
<p>And that spreads democracy.</p>
<p>And democracies do not war with other democracies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I believe in data.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and write down every single war you had to learn</p>
<p>since you were in elementary school.</p>
<p>Every single war, hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.</p>
<p>All these wars were between kings, queens,</p>
<p>emperors, and dictators.</p>
<p>Never between two major democracies.</p>
<p>And so I think with the spread of this technology</p>
<p>and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,</p>
<p>it means that, well, we will still have wars.</p>
<p>Wars, of course, is politics by other means,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll be less intense and less frequent.</p>
<p>Do you have worries of longer term existential risk</p>
<p>from technology, from AI?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a wonderful vision of a future</p>
<p>where war is a distant memory,</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s another agent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody else that&rsquo;s able to create conflict,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to create harm, AI systems.</p>
<p>So do you have worry about such AI systems?</p>
<p>Well, yes, that is an existential risk,</p>
<p>but again, I think an existential risk,</p>
<p>not for this century.</p>
<p>I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront</p>
<p>this question as robots gradually approach</p>
<p>the intelligence of a dog, a cat,</p>
<p>and finally that of a monkey.</p>
<p>However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.</p>
<p>Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll also digitize our personality,</p>
<p>our memories, our feelings.</p>
<p>You realize during the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>there was something called dualism.</p>
<p>Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.</p>
<p>When the body died, the soul went to heaven.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dualism.</p>
<p>Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in</p>
<p>and said, bah, humbug.</p>
<p>Every time we look at the brain, it&rsquo;s just neurons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks, period, end of story.</p>
<p>Bunch of neurons firing.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going back to dualism.</p>
<p>Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,</p>
<p>feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called the Connectome Project.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars are now being spent</p>
<p>to do not just the genome project</p>
<p>of sequencing the genes of our body,</p>
<p>but the Connectome Project,</p>
<p>which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.</p>
<p>And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>today, at this very moment,</p>
<p>you can contact Silicon Valley companies</p>
<p>that are willing to digitize your relatives</p>
<p>because some people want to talk to their parents.</p>
<p>There are unresolved issues with their parents,</p>
<p>and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.</p>
<p>We leave a digital trail.</p>
<p>Our ancestors did not.</p>
<p>Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,</p>
<p>just one line in a church book,</p>
<p>saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That was their entire digital memory.</p>
<p>I mean, their entire digital existence summarized</p>
<p>in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.</p>
<p>Now we digitize everything.</p>
<p>Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.</p>
<p>You put it on the internet.</p>
<p>And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves</p>
<p>and give us digital immortality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll not only have biologic genetic immortality</p>
<p>of some sort, but also digital immortality.</p>
<p>And what are we gonna do with it?</p>
<p>I think we should send it into outer space.</p>
<p>If you digitize the human brain</p>
<p>and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the moon in one second.</p>
<p>Shoot it to Mars, you&rsquo;re on Mars in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Shoot it to Pluto, you&rsquo;re on Pluto in eight hours.</p>
<p>Think about it for a moment.</p>
<p>You can have breakfast in New York</p>
<p>and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,</p>
<p>then zap your way to Mars by noontime,</p>
<p>journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,</p>
<p>and then come back for dinner in New York at night.</p>
<p>All in a day&rsquo;s work at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Now, this means that you don&rsquo;t need booster rockets.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need weightlessness problems.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about meteorites.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s on the moon?</p>
<p>On the moon, there is a mainframe</p>
<p>that downloads your laser beam&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>And where does it download the information into?</p>
<p>An avatar.</p>
<p>Now, what does that avatar look like?</p>
<p>Anything you want.</p>
<p>Think about it for a moment.</p>
<p>You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,</p>
<p>traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,</p>
<p>downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.</p>
<p>Now, let me stick my neck out.</p>
<p>So far, everything I&rsquo;ve been saying</p>
<p>is well within the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Well within the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I think this already exists.</p>
<p>I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway</p>
<p>a laser highway of laser porting</p>
<p>with billions of souls of aliens</p>
<p>zapping their way across the galaxy.</p>
<p>Now, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Are we smart enough to determine</p>
<p>whether such a thing exists or not?</p>
<p>No, this could exist right outside</p>
<p>the orbit of the planet Earth.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re too stupid in our technology</p>
<p>to even prove it or disprove it.</p>
<p>We would need the aliens on this laser super highway</p>
<p>to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.</p>
<p>I mean, it ultimately boils down</p>
<p>to the language of communication,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s an exciting possibility</p>
<p>that actually the sky is filled with aliens.</p>
<p>The aliens could already be here.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just so oblivious that we&rsquo;re too stupid to know it.</p>
<p>See, they don&rsquo;t have to be in alien form</p>
<p>with little green men.</p>
<p>They can be in any form they want</p>
<p>in an avatar of their creation.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, they could very well be.</p>
<p>They can even look like us.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d never know.</p>
<p>One of us could be an alien.</p>
<p>You know, in the zoo, did you know</p>
<p>that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?</p>
<p>We create a fake animal and we put it in</p>
<p>so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.</p>
<p>And of course, these animals brains,</p>
<p>their brain is about as big as a walnut.</p>
<p>They accept these dummies as if they were real.</p>
<p>So an alien civilization in outer space would say,</p>
<p>oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.</p>
<p>We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d never know it.</p>
<p>That would be an entertaining thing to watch</p>
<p>from the alien perspective.</p>
<p>So you kind of implied that with a digital form</p>
<p>of our being, but also biologically,</p>
<p>do you think one day technology will allow</p>
<p>individual human beings to become immortal</p>
<p>besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence</p>
<p>will give us the key to genetic immortality.</p>
<p>You see, in the coming decades,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna have their gene sequence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have billions of genomes of old people,</p>
<p>billions of genomes of young people.</p>
<p>And what are we gonna do with it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna run it through an AI machine,</p>
<p>which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.</p>
<p>In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,</p>
<p>kings, and queens lusted over.</p>
<p>The fountain of youth will be found</p>
<p>by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will identify</p>
<p>where these age genes are located.</p>
<p>First of all, what is aging?</p>
<p>We now know what aging is.</p>
<p>Aging is the buildup of errors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.</p>
<p>This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,</p>
<p>they go into senescence, and they die.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s why we die.</p>
<p>We die because of the buildup of mistakes</p>
<p>in our genome, in our cellular activity.</p>
<p>But you see, in the future, we&rsquo;ll be able to fix those genes</p>
<p>with CRISPR type technologies,</p>
<p>and perhaps even live forever.</p>
<p>So let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Where does aging take place in a car?</p>
<p>Given a car, where does aging take place?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s obvious, the engine, right?</p>
<p>A, that&rsquo;s where you have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>B, that&rsquo;s where you have combustion.</p>
<p>Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?</p>
<p>The mitochondria.</p>
<p>We now know where aging takes place.</p>
<p>And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up</p>
<p>in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,</p>
<p>would you?</p>
<p>Damn straight.</p>
<p>No, I think about it for a while,</p>
<p>because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a famous myth of Tithonus.</p>
<p>It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,</p>
<p>there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.</p>
<p>Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,</p>
<p>and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.</p>
<p>And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her</p>
<p>the gift of immortality to give to her lover.</p>
<p>So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.</p>
<p>But you see, Aurora made a mistake,</p>
<p>a huge mistake.</p>
<p>She asked for immortality,</p>
<p>but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.</p>
<p>So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,</p>
<p>decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.</p>
<p>Never die.</p>
<p>Quality of life is important.</p>
<p>So I think immortality is a great idea,</p>
<p>as long as you also have immortal youth as well.</p>
<p>Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,</p>
<p>but I personally believe that our grandkids</p>
<p>may have the option of reaching the age of 30</p>
<p>and then stopping.</p>
<p>They may like being age 30,</p>
<p>because you have wisdom,</p>
<p>you have all the benefits of age and maturity,</p>
<p>and you still live forever with a healthy body.</p>
<p>Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.</p>
<p>Is there an aspect of human existence</p>
<p>that is meaningful only because we&rsquo;re mortal?</p>
<p>Well, every waking moment,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t think about it this way,</p>
<p>but every waking moment,</p>
<p>actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.</p>
<p>Think about it for a moment.</p>
<p>When you go to college,</p>
<p>you realize that you are in a period of time</p>
<p>where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.</p>
<p>And after that, you&rsquo;ll retire and then you&rsquo;ll die.</p>
<p>And so even as a youth, even as a child,</p>
<p>without even thinking about it,</p>
<p>you are aware of your own death,</p>
<p>because it sets limits to your lifespan.</p>
<p>I gotta graduate from high school.</p>
<p>I gotta graduate from college.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>Because unless you graduate from high school,</p>
<p>unless you graduate from college,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna enter old age with enough money</p>
<p>to retire and then die.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,</p>
<p>because it affects every aspect of your being.</p>
<p>The fact that you go to high school, college,</p>
<p>get married, have kids, there&rsquo;s a clock,</p>
<p>a clock ticking even without your permission.</p>
<p>It gives a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Do you yourself, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much excitement and passion</p>
<p>in the way you talk about physics</p>
<p>and the way you talk about technology in the future.</p>
<p>Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about this clock that&rsquo;s ticking?</p>
<p>Well, I try not to,</p>
<p>because it then begins to affect your behavior.</p>
<p>You begin to alter your behavior</p>
<p>to match your expectation of when you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about youth,</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s talk about death, okay?</p>
<p>When I interview scientists on radio,</p>
<p>I often ask them, what made the difference?</p>
<p>How old were you?</p>
<p>What changed your life?</p>
<p>And they always say more or less the same thing.</p>
<p>No, these are Nobel Prize winners,</p>
<p>directors of major laboratories,</p>
<p>very distinguished scientists.</p>
<p>They always say, when I was 10,</p>
<p>when I was 10, something happened.</p>
<p>It was a visit to the planetarium.</p>
<p>It was a telescope.</p>
<p>For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>it was the chemistry kit.</p>
<p>For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.</p>
<p>For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.</p>
<p>For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.</p>
<p>Something happened,</p>
<p>which gives them this existential shock.</p>
<p>Because you see, before the age of 10,</p>
<p>everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your universe, mommy and daddy.</p>
<p>Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s beyond mommy and daddy?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you have this epiphany,</p>
<p>when you realize, oh my God, there&rsquo;s a universe out there,</p>
<p>a universe of discovery.</p>
<p>And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You still remember that shock</p>
<p>that you felt gazing at the universe.</p>
<p>And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists</p>
<p>known to science.</p>
<p>The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science</p>
<p>is junior high school.</p>
<p>When you hit junior high school, folks, it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.</p>
<p>And your friends shun you.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, people think you&rsquo;re a weirdo.</p>
<p>And scientists made boring.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,</p>
<p>when he was a child,</p>
<p>his father would take him into the forest.</p>
<p>And the father would teach him everything about birds,</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re shaped the way they are,</p>
<p>their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,</p>
<p>everything about birds.</p>
<p>So one day, a bully comes up</p>
<p>to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,</p>
<p>hey, Dick, what&rsquo;s the name of that bird over there?</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He knew everything about that bird except its name.</p>
<p>So he said, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then the bully said, what&rsquo;s the matter, Dick?</p>
<p>You stupid or something?</p>
<p>And then in that instant, he got it.</p>
<p>He got it.</p>
<p>He realized that for most people,</p>
<p>science is giving names to birds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what science is.</p>
<p>You know lots of names of obscure things.</p>
<p>Hey, people say, you&rsquo;re smart.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re smart.</p>
<p>You know all the names of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>You know all the names of the plants.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not science at all.</p>
<p>Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what science is all about.</p>
<p>My favorite quote from Einstein is that,</p>
<p>unless you can explain the theory to a child,</p>
<p>the theory is probably worthless.</p>
<p>Meaning that all great theories are not big words.</p>
<p>All great theories are simple concepts, principles,</p>
<p>basic physical pictures.</p>
<p>Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,</p>
<p>rocket ships and locomotives.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s laws of gravity are all about balls</p>
<p>and spinning wheels and things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what physics and science is all about,</p>
<p>not memorizing things.</p>
<p>And that stays with you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So even in old age, I&rsquo;ve noticed that these scientists,</p>
<p>when they sit back, they still remember.</p>
<p>They still remember that flush,</p>
<p>that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,</p>
<p>that first moment when they encountered the universe.</p>
<p>That keeps them going.</p>
<p>By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,</p>
<p>something happened to me as well.</p>
<p>When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers</p>
<p>that a great scientist had just died.</p>
<p>And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, just a simple picture of the front page</p>
<p>of the newspapers of his desk.</p>
<p>That desk had a book on it, which was opened.</p>
<p>And the caption said more or less,</p>
<p>this is the unfinished manuscript</p>
<p>from the greatest scientists of our time.</p>
<p>So I said to myself, well, why couldn&rsquo;t he finish it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so hard that you can&rsquo;t finish it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a great scientist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a homework problem, right?</p>
<p>You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t he solve it?</p>
<p>So to me, this was a murder mystery.</p>
<p>This was greater than any adventure story.</p>
<p>I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t finish something.</p>
<p>And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,</p>
<p>Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.</p>
<p>It was unfinished.</p>
<p>Well, today I can read that book.</p>
<p>I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.</p>
<p>And I began to realize that he lost his way</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t have a physical picture</p>
<p>to guide him on the third try.</p>
<p>On the first try, he talked about clocks</p>
<p>and lightning bolts and meter sticks,</p>
<p>and that gave us special relativity,</p>
<p>which gave us the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The second great picture was gravity</p>
<p>with balls rolling on curved surfaces.</p>
<p>And that gave us the Big Bang,</p>
<p>creation of the universe, black holes.</p>
<p>On the third try, he missed it.</p>
<p>He had no picture at all to guide him.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a quote I have where he said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still looking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still looking for that picture.</p>
<p>He never found it.</p>
<p>Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.</p>
<p>The strength theory can unify gravity</p>
<p>and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>which is quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>or couldn&rsquo;t quite pin down and make sense of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.</p>
<p>The left hand is a theory of the small.</p>
<p>The right hand is a theory of the big.</p>
<p>The theory of the small is the quantum theory,</p>
<p>the theory of atoms and quarks.</p>
<p>The theory of the big is relativity,</p>
<p>the theory of black holes, big bangs.</p>
<p>The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.</p>
<p>They hate each other.</p>
<p>The left hand is based on discrete particles.</p>
<p>The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.</p>
<p>How do you put these two things together</p>
<p>into a single theory?</p>
<p>They hate each other.</p>
<p>The greatest minds of our time,</p>
<p>the greatest minds of our time</p>
<p>worked on this problem and failed.</p>
<p>Today, the only theory that has survived</p>
<p>every challenge so far is string theory.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean string theory is correct.</p>
<p>It could very well be wrong,</p>
<p>but right now it&rsquo;s the only game in town.</p>
<p>Some people come up to me and say,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Professor, I don&rsquo;t believe in string theory.</p>
<p>Give me an alternative.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I tell them there is none.</p>
<p>Get used to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best theory we got.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only theory we have.</p>
<p>Do you see, you know,</p>
<p>the strings kind of inspire a view,</p>
<p>as did atoms and particles and quarks,</p>
<p>but especially strings inspire a view of a universe</p>
<p>as a kind of information processing system,</p>
<p>as a computer of sorts.</p>
<p>Do you see the universe in this way?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Some people think, in fact,</p>
<p>the whole universe is a computer of some sort.</p>
<p>And they believe that perhaps everything,</p>
<p>therefore, is a simulation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there is a super video game</p>
<p>where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen</p>
<p>and somebody hit the play button</p>
<p>and here we are talking about simulations.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,</p>
<p>the simple weather is so complicated</p>
<p>with trillions upon trillions of atoms</p>
<p>that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.</p>
<p>In other words, the smallest object</p>
<p>which can describe the weather</p>
<p>and simulate the weather is the weather itself.</p>
<p>The smallest object that can simulate a human</p>
<p>is the human itself.</p>
<p>And if you had quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>it becomes almost impossible</p>
<p>to simulate it with a conventional computer.</p>
<p>This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,</p>
<p>parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.</p>
<p>And so the calculation just spirals out of control.</p>
<p>Now, so far, there&rsquo;s only one way</p>
<p>where you might be able to argue</p>
<p>that the universe is a simulation.</p>
<p>And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia</p>
<p>into a black hole, the information is not lost.</p>
<p>Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.</p>
<p>Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.</p>
<p>In fact, you can calculate</p>
<p>the maximum amount of information</p>
<p>you can store in a black hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a finite number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a calculable number, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,</p>
<p>which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,</p>
<p>each universe, each black hole</p>
<p>has a finite amount of information.</p>
<p>Therefore, ergo, da da!</p>
<p>Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe</p>
<p>is finite.</p>
<p>This is mind boggling.</p>
<p>This, I consider mind boggling,</p>
<p>that all possible universes are countable</p>
<p>and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,</p>
<p>a number you can write on a sheet of paper,</p>
<p>all possible universes, and it&rsquo;s a finite number.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a number beyond human imagination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a number based on what is called a Planck length,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a number.</p>
<p>And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,</p>
<p>then the universe would be a simulation.</p>
<p>So theoretically, because the amount of information</p>
<p>is finite, well, there necessarily must be able</p>
<p>to exist a computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>maybe impossible to build.</p>
<p>Yes, no computer can build a universe</p>
<p>capable of simulating the entire universe,</p>
<p>except the universe itself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your intuition, that our universe</p>
<p>is very efficient, and so there&rsquo;s no shortcuts.</p>
<p>Right, two reasons why I believe the universe</p>
<p>is not a simulation.</p>
<p>First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.</p>
<p>No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.</p>
<p>And second, why would any super intelligent being</p>
<p>simulate humans?</p>
<p>If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?</p>
<p>And we call it art, we call it humor.</p>
<p>We call it human civilization.</p>
<p>So why should an advanced civilization</p>
<p>go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night</p>
<p>Live?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a funny idea, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that the act of creation</p>
<p>cannot anticipate humans?</p>
<p>You simply set the initial conditions</p>
<p>and set a bunch of physical laws,</p>
<p>and just for the fun of it, see what happens.</p>
<p>You launch the thing, so you&rsquo;re not necessarily</p>
<p>simulating everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not simulating every little bit in the sense</p>
<p>that you could predict what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,</p>
<p>and see what kind of fun stuff happens.</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, that&rsquo;s how life got started.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called</p>
<p>the Miller experiment.</p>
<p>He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases</p>
<p>with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.</p>
<p>And then he just walked away for a few weeks,</p>
<p>came back a few weeks later, and bingo.</p>
<p>Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.</p>
<p>If he had left it there for a few years,</p>
<p>he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably how life got started, as a accident.</p>
<p>And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,</p>
<p>DNA might have formed in that beaker.</p>
<p>And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that</p>
<p>could have been an accident if you wait long enough.</p>
<p>And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s plenty of time for lots of random things</p>
<p>to happen, including life itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.</p>
<p>And there could be an infinite number</p>
<p>of those throughout the history of the universe,</p>
<p>many creatures like us.</p>
<p>We perhaps are not the epitome of what</p>
<p>the universe is created for.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not.</p>
<p>Just look around.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look to your left, look to your right.</p>
<p>When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good chance in the 2030s</p>
<p>that we will be on Mars.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s no physics reason why we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an engineering problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,</p>
<p>but it is an engineering problem.</p>
<p>And in my book, Future of Humanity,</p>
<p>I even speculate beyond that, that by the end</p>
<p>of this century, we&rsquo;ll probably have the first starships.</p>
<p>The first starships will not look</p>
<p>like the Enterprise at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably be small computer chips</p>
<p>that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.</p>
<p>And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,</p>
<p>the Breakthrough Starshot program</p>
<p>could send ships to the nearby stars,</p>
<p>traveling at 20% the speed of light,</p>
<p>reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we should have fusion power.</p>
<p>Fusion power is, in some sense, one</p>
<p>of the ultimate sources of energy, but it&rsquo;s unstable.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have fusion power today.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>First of all, stars form almost for free.</p>
<p>You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t even have to do anything to it,</p>
<p>and it becomes a star.</p>
<p>Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?</p>
<p>Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.</p>
<p>They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very easy to get spherically symmetric</p>
<p>configurations of gas to compress into a star.</p>
<p>It just happens naturally all by itself.</p>
<p>The problem is magnetism is bipolar.</p>
<p>You have a North Pole and a South Pole.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like trying to squeeze a long balloon.</p>
<p>Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.</p>
<p>You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem with fusion machines.</p>
<p>We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole</p>
<p>to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies</p>
<p>and horrible configurations can take place</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not squeezing something uniformly</p>
<p>like in a star.</p>
<p>Stars, in some sense, are for free.</p>
<p>Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.</p>
<p>So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy</p>
<p>for the planet Earth.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the intuition there?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ll extract hydrogen from seawater,</p>
<p>burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor</p>
<p>to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,</p>
<p>without the nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Why do we have meltdowns?</p>
<p>We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,</p>
<p>every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Tons of it.</p>
<p>30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hot for thousands, millions of years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have meltdowns.</p>
<p>But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor</p>
<p>is helium gas.</p>
<p>Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.</p>
<p>You can make money selling helium gas.</p>
<p>And so the waste product of a fusion reactor</p>
<p>is helium, not nuclear waste that we find</p>
<p>in a commercial fission plant.</p>
<p>And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion</p>
<p>allows us to, converts us into a type one,</p>
<p>I guess, civilization, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization</p>
<p>will be fusion power.</p>
<p>We, by the way, are type zero.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even rate on this scale.</p>
<p>We get our energy from dead plants, for God&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>oil and coal.</p>
<p>But we are about 100 years from being type one.</p>
<p>Get a calculator.</p>
<p>In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we</p>
<p>are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.</p>
<p>For example, what is the internet?</p>
<p>The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology</p>
<p>to enter into our century.</p>
<p>The first planetary technology is the internet.</p>
<p>What is the language of type one?</p>
<p>On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese</p>
<p>are the most dominant languages on the internet.</p>
<p>And what about the culture?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,</p>
<p>a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,</p>
<p>type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,</p>
<p>the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re beginning to see the beginnings of a type one</p>
<p>culture in a type one civilization.</p>
<p>And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.</p>
<p>So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light</p>
<p>on a chip into Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>But in a slightly nearer term, what</p>
<p>do you think about the idea when we still have to send</p>
<p>our biological bodies the colonization of planets,</p>
<p>colonization of Mars?</p>
<p>Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever</p>
<p>or anytime soon?</p>
<p>Well, just remember the dinosaurs</p>
<p>did not have a space program.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not here today.</p>
<p>How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?</p>
<p>Because they didn&rsquo;t have a space program.</p>
<p>We do have a space program, which</p>
<p>means that we have an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think we should bankrupt the Earth</p>
<p>or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too expensive and not practical.</p>
<p>But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars</p>
<p>in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.</p>
<p>And that means we have to terraform Mars.</p>
<p>Now, to terraform Mars, if we could</p>
<p>raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,</p>
<p>then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.</p>
<p>Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>It causes even more melting of the ice caps.</p>
<p>So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It feeds on itself.</p>
<p>It becomes autocatalytic.</p>
<p>And so once you hit six degrees, rising</p>
<p>of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.</p>
<p>And we melt the polar ice caps.</p>
<p>And liquid water once again flows</p>
<p>in the rivers, the canals, the channels,</p>
<p>and the oceans of Mars.</p>
<p>Mars once had an ocean, we think,</p>
<p>about the size of the United States.</p>
<p>And so that is a possibility.</p>
<p>Now, how do we get there?</p>
<p>How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?</p>
<p>Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads</p>
<p>on the polar ice caps.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know that much about the effects</p>
<p>of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.</p>
<p>And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading</p>
<p>the newspaper?</p>
<p>So I think there are other ways to do it</p>
<p>with solar satellites.</p>
<p>You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight</p>
<p>onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.</p>
<p>Mars has plenty of water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just frozen.</p>
<p>I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture</p>
<p>of the future.</p>
