    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring you zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>Along those lines,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This month, we&rsquo;re talking all about</p>
<p>the neuroscience of emotions.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>an extremely important topic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s central to our daily life, and that&rsquo;s motivation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about pleasure and reward.</p>
<p>What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about addictions.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a discussion about pleasure and reward</p>
<p>without having a discussion about addictions</p>
<p>and the addictive properties of certain substances,</p>
<p>as well as how to break free of addiction.</p>
<p>As well, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>the neurochemistry of drive and mindset.</p>
<p>So all these themes are woven together</p>
<p>in the context of emotions.</p>
<p>Each one of them, of course,</p>
<p>could also be its own entire month of the podcast.</p>
<p>And in fact, we are going to have an entire month</p>
<p>devoted to addiction.</p>
<p>And I have a very special guest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be joining us to talk about</p>
<p>the science and clinical practices</p>
<p>that we know are important for understanding</p>
<p>and treating addiction.</p>
<p>But for now, let&rsquo;s just talk about</p>
<p>the neuroscience of motivation and reward,</p>
<p>of pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>because those are central to what we think of as emotions,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel good,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel we&rsquo;re on track in life,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel we&rsquo;re falling behind.</p>
<p>So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allows us to pursue long-term goals</p>
<p>or short-term goals.</p>
<p>Motivation and the chemistry of motivation</p>
<p>is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.</p>
<p>In fact, the same single molecule, dopamine,</p>
<p>is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement.</p>
<p>Even though nerves controlling muscles,</p>
<p>so again, these are nerves in the spinal cord or brain</p>
<p>that move our limbs,</p>
<p>the effector chemical there,</p>
<p>the one that actually causes the muscles to twitch,</p>
<p>to contract, is acetylcholine.</p>
<p>In the brain, acetylcholine is responsible for focus.</p>
<p>However, whether or not we move,</p>
<p>whether or not we want to move,</p>
<p>whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of,</p>
<p>you know, they could be social barriers</p>
<p>or financial barriers or time constraints,</p>
<p>that depends on this molecule we call dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating molecule,</p>
<p>and it lies at the center of so many great things in life,</p>
<p>and it lies at the center</p>
<p>of so many terrible aspects of life,</p>
<p>namely addiction and certain forms of mental disease.</p>
<p>So if ever there was a double-edged blade</p>
<p>in the world of neuroscience, it&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what dopamine is,</p>
<p>and as always, we are going to talk about actionable tools.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re definitely going to talk about</p>
<p>some things related to supplementation,</p>
<p>although you might be surprised to learn</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not all just about increasing dopamine,</p>
<p>and in particular, in some cases,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s appropriate, sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>More so, we&rsquo;re going to talk about tools</p>
<p>related to what&rsquo;s called dopamine scheduling,</p>
<p>how the way that you&rsquo;re leading your life</p>
<p>and the way that you&rsquo;re conceptualizing your goals</p>
<p>can actually predict whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to continue to pursue those goals,</p>
<p>and therefore, whether or not you will succeed</p>
<p>in achieving those goals,</p>
<p>as well as whether or not you will quit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental relationship</p>
<p>between dopamine released in your brain</p>
<p>and your desire to exert effort,</p>
<p>and you can actually control the schedule of dopamine release</p>
<p>but it requires the appropriate knowledge.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases where understanding</p>
<p>the way the dopamine system works</p>
<p>will allow you to leverage it to your benefit,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t understand the way that dopamine works,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance that it&rsquo;s going to pull you out</p>
<p>into the current of life,</p>
<p>meaning the rest of the world</p>
<p>is going to control your dopamine schedules.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited to tell you about today&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn some basic science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of tools,</p>
<p>and these tools I believe are applicable</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re five years old, eight years old,</p>
<p>80 years old, or anything in between.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about dopamine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get a few basic facts on the table.</p>
<p>Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s,</p>
<p>and it was discovered as the precursor,</p>
<p>meaning the thing from which epinephrine</p>
<p>or adrenaline is made.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s fundamentally important</p>
<p>because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays,</p>
<p>we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure,</p>
<p>but actually it is the substrate</p>
<p>from which adrenaline is made,</p>
<p>and in the brain it&rsquo;s the substrate</p>
<p>from which epinephrine is made.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline,</p>
<p>except in the brain we call it epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, as you may recall from previous podcasts,</p>
<p>or if you haven&rsquo;t, no problem,</p>
<p>epinephrine allows us to get into action.</p>
<p>It stimulates changes in the blood vessels,</p>
<p>in the heart, in the organs and tissues of the body</p>
<p>that bias us for movement.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about epinephrine,</p>
<p>you can check out our episode on mastering stress.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about it there.</p>
<p>Dopamine was initially thought to be</p>
<p>just the building block for epinephrine,</p>
<p>and it is indeed the chemical building block</p>
<p>from which epinephrine is made.</p>
<p>However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always converted to epinephrine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is released from several sites</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>but perhaps the most important one for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>about motivation and reward</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s sometimes just called</p>
<p>the reward pathway.</p>
<p>For the aficionados,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sometimes called the mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fundamentally important</p>
<p>to your desire to engage in action,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fundamentally important</p>
<p>for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.</p>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got a structure</p>
<p>in the deep part of your brain called the VTA.</p>
<p>It stands for ventral tegmental area.</p>
<p>As always, you don&rsquo;t have to remember these names,</p>
<p>but if you want to, I offer them to you</p>
<p>for further Googling, research, reading, et cetera.</p>
<p>The VTA, or ventral tegmental area, contains neurons</p>
<p>that send what we call axons, little wires,</p>
<p>that spit out dopamine at a different structure</p>
<p>called the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>And those two structures, VTA and nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>form really the core machinery of the reward pathway</p>
<p>and the pathway that controls your motivation for anything.</p>
<p>You can think of them like an accelerator.</p>
<p>They bias you for action.</p>
<p>However, within the reward pathway, there&rsquo;s also a break.</p>
<p>The break or restriction on that dopamine,</p>
<p>which controls when it&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>and how much it&rsquo;s released, is the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate</p>
<p>right behind your forehead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience.</p>
<p>You hear about it for decision-making,</p>
<p>executive function, for planning, et cetera.</p>
<p>And indeed, it&rsquo;s responsible for a lot of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this really unique real estate</p>
<p>that we were all endowed with as humans.</p>
<p>Other animals don&rsquo;t have much of it.</p>
<p>We have a lot of it.</p>
<p>And that prefrontal cortex acts as a break</p>
<p>on the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Without that break,</p>
<p>you would be purely a pleasure-seeking animal.</p>
<p>You would be purely pleasure-seeking.</p>
<p>You would have no basis for regulating your behavior</p>
<p>in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the important feature of motivation,</p>
<p>which is that motivation is a two-part process,</p>
<p>which is about balancing pleasure and pain, okay?</p>
<p>Most people think about motivation and reward</p>
<p>and dopamine as just trying to achieve pleasure.</p>
<p>And indeed, dopamine is released in the brain</p>
<p>from the VTA at the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>when we experience things that we like.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the way to conceptualize this.</p>
<p>And if you can internalize this in your mind,</p>
<p>it will really help you as you move through your day</p>
<p>trying to understand why you might be motivated</p>
<p>or not motivated for certain things.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re just sitting around,</p>
<p>not doing much of anything,</p>
<p>maybe you wake up in bed in the morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about getting up or not,</p>
<p>this reward pathway is releasing dopamine</p>
<p>at a rate of about three or four times per second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of firing at a low level.</p>
<p>When I say firing, mean electrical activity in the neurons.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re just around, you feel okay,</p>
<p>not depressed, not highly motivated, not excited,</p>
<p>maybe three or four times a second.</p>
<p>If suddenly you get excited about something,</p>
<p>you anticipate something, not receive an award,</p>
<p>but you get excited in an anticipatory way,</p>
<p>then the rate of firing,</p>
<p>the rate of activity in this reward pathway</p>
<p>suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times.</p>
<p>And it has the effect of creating a sense of action</p>
<p>or desire to move in the direction of the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re craving.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s fair to say that dopamine is responsible</p>
<p>for wanting and for craving.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s distinctly different</p>
<p>from the way that you hear it talked about normally,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s involved in pleasure.</p>
<p>So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released in response to food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released in response to a lot of things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly released in anticipation</p>
<p>and craving for a particular thing.</p>
<p>It has the effect of narrowing our focus</p>
<p>for the thing that we crave.</p>
<p>And that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>It could be as important as a big board meeting.</p>
<p>It could be a big final exam.</p>
<p>It could be the person that we&rsquo;re excited to meet or see.</p>
<p>Dopamine doesn&rsquo;t care about what you&rsquo;re craving.</p>
<p>It just releases at a particular rate.</p>
<p>In fact, if we just take a step back</p>
<p>and we look at the scientific data</p>
<p>on how much the dopamine firing increases</p>
<p>in response to different things,</p>
<p>you get a pretty interesting window</p>
<p>into how your brain works</p>
<p>and why you might be motivated or not motivated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re looking forward to a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to see your partner.</p>
<p>Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate</p>
<p>until you start thinking about the thing that you want</p>
<p>or the thing that you&rsquo;re looking forward to.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re craving chocolate or a good meal,</p>
<p>a steak if you like steak,</p>
<p>or a nice plate of pasta if you like pasta.</p>
<p>When you eat that food,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline.</p>
<p>The neurons there go from firing</p>
<p>three or four times per second</p>
<p>to six or 10 times per second.</p>
<p>It really depends, and these aren&rsquo;t exact numbers,</p>
<p>but if we were to measure</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>it goes up about 50%, all right?</p>
<p>Sex, which is fundamental</p>
<p>to our species continuation and reproduction,</p>
<p>although it doesn&rsquo;t have to be for conceiving children,</p>
<p>sex does release dopamine</p>
<p>and it increases dopamine levels about 100%,</p>
<p>so it basically doubles them.</p>
<p>Nicotine of the sort that&rsquo;s in cigarettes,</p>
<p>or some people are taking nicotine in supplemental form,</p>
<p>increases the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>about 150% above baseline.</p>
<p>It also does some other things that we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>but nicotine does that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that nicotine</p>
<p>would increase the amount of dopamine in your brain</p>
<p>very quickly within seconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 150 times over baseline</p>
<p>as opposed to sex, which is 100% above</p>
<p>or food, which is 50%.</p>
<p>Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released a thousand fold</p>
<p>within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.</p>
<p>However, just thinking about food, about sex,</p>
<p>about nicotine, if you like nicotine,</p>
<p>or cocaine or amphetamine</p>
<p>can increase the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.</p>
<p>Now, it depends.</p>
<p>In some cases, for instance, the cocaine user,</p>
<p>the addict that wants cocaine,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just think about cocaine</p>
<p>and increase the amount that&rsquo;s released about a thousand fold</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually much lower,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just enough to put them on the motivation track</p>
<p>to crave that particular thing.</p>
<p>Now, there are reasons</p>
<p>why you would have brain circuitry like this.</p>
<p>I mean, brain circuitry like this</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t evolve to get you addicted.</p>
<p>Brain circuitry like this evolved</p>
<p>in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals,</p>
<p>water when you&rsquo;re thirsty, sex in order to reproduce.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about the relationship</p>
<p>between estrogen and testosterone in the dopamine system</p>
<p>because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released.</p>
<p>These things and these brain areas and neurons</p>
<p>were part of the evolutionary history</p>
<p>that led to the continuation of our species.</p>
<p>Things like cocaine and amphetamine</p>
<p>are disastrous for most people</p>
<p>because they release so much dopamine</p>
<p>and they create these closed loops</p>
<p>where people then only crave the particular thing,</p>
<p>cocaine and amphetamine,</p>
<p>that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.</p>
<p>Most things don&rsquo;t release that level of dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, nowadays, there&rsquo;s a ton of interest in social media</p>
<p>and in video games.</p>
<p>And there have been some measurements</p>
<p>of the amount of dopamine released.</p>
<p>Video games, especially video games</p>
<p>that have a very high update speed</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s novel territory all the time.</p>
<p>Novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.</p>
<p>Those can release dopamine</p>
<p>somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.</p>
<p>So very high levels of dopamine release.</p>
<p>Social media is an interesting one</p>
<p>because the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>in response to logging onto social media</p>
<p>initially could be quite high,</p>
<p>but it seems likely that there&rsquo;s a taper</p>
<p>in the amount of dopamine,</p>
<p>but, and yet, people still get addicted.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Why is it that we can get addicted to things</p>
<p>that fail to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure</p>
<p>that they initially did?</p>
<p>Being addicted to something isn&rsquo;t just about</p>
<p>the fact that it feels so good</p>
<p>that you want to do it over and over again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of this pleasure-pain balance</p>
<p>that underlies motivation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look a little bit closer</p>
<p>at the pleasure-pain balance</p>
<p>because therein lies the tools</p>
<p>for you to be able to control motivation</p>
<p>toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors</p>
<p>towards things that are destructive for you.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors,</p>
<p>whether or not those are drugs</p>
<p>or whether or not those are adventure thrill-seeking things,</p>
<p>or they seek out new partners,</p>
<p>or, you know, they take a new class.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll notice, I&rsquo;m not placing any judgment</p>
<p>or value on these different behaviors.</p>
<p>Although I think it&rsquo;s fair to point out</p>
<p>that for most people,</p>
<p>addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamine</p>
<p>are very destructive.</p>
<p>Actually, we know that about 15 to 20% of people</p>
<p>have a genetic bias towards addiction</p>
<p>that, you know, you sometimes hear that the first time</p>
<p>that you use a drug, you can become addicted to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not been shown to be true</p>
<p>for most things and most people,</p>
<p>but for some people that actually is true.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit later</p>
<p>about why certain people are heavily biased</p>
<p>toward becoming addicts on the first use</p>
<p>of a particular drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very interesting.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with whether or not</p>
<p>they were formally addicted to something else.</p>
<p>But in any case, the way that addiction works</p>
<p>and the way that motivation works generally</p>
<p>in the non-addictive setting</p>
<p>is that when you anticipate something,</p>
<p>a little bit of dopamine is released.</p>
<p>And then when you reach that thing,</p>
<p>you engage in that thing,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine goes up even further.</p>
<p>But as you repeatedly pursue a behavior</p>
<p>and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you love running or you love chocolate.</p>
<p>As you eat a piece of chocolate, believe it or not,</p>
<p>it tastes good.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a shift away from activation of dopamine.</p>
<p>And there are other chemicals that are released</p>
<p>that trigger a low level sense of pain.</p>
<p>Now you might not feel it as physical pain,</p>
<p>but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine</p>
<p>and one part the mirror image of dopamine,</p>
<p>which is the pain or the craving</p>
<p>for yet another piece of chocolate.</p>
<p>And this is a very important and subtle feature</p>
<p>of the dopamine system that&rsquo;s not often discussed.</p>
<p>People always talk about just as pleasure.</p>
<p>You love social media, so it gives you dopamine.</p>
<p>And so you engage in that.</p>
<p>You like chocolate, it releases dopamine, so you do that.</p>
<p>But for every bit of dopamine that&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another circuit in the brain that creates,</p>
<p>you can think of it as kind of like</p>
<p>a downward deflection in pleasure.</p>
<p>So you engage in something you really want</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an increase in pleasure.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a, without you doing anything,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mirror image of that,</p>
<p>which is a downward deflection in pleasure,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re calling pain.</p>
<p>So for every bit of pleasure,</p>
<p>there is a mirror image experience of pain.</p>
<p>And they overlap in time very closely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to sense this, but try it.</p>
<p>The next time you eat something really delicious,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll take a bite, it tastes delicious.</p>
<p>And part of the experience is to want more of that thing.</p>
<p>This is true for any pleasureful experience.</p>
<p>Now, the diabolical part about dopamine</p>
<p>is that because it didn&rsquo;t evolve</p>
<p>in order to get you to indulge in more and more</p>
<p>and more of something,</p>
<p>what happens is that initially</p>
<p>you experience an increase in pleasure</p>
<p>and you also experience this increase in pain</p>
<p>shortly after or woven in with the pleasure</p>
<p>that makes you want more of that thing.</p>
<p>But with each subsequent time that you encounter that thing,</p>
<p>that you pursue the chocolate, that you pursue the lover,</p>
<p>each time the experience of dopamine release and pleasure</p>
<p>is diminished a little bit.</p>
<p>And the diabolical thing is that the pain response</p>
<p>is increased a little bit.</p>
<p>And this is best observed</p>
<p>in the context of drug seeking behavior.</p>
<p>The first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine</p>
<p>they may do it out of boredom,</p>
<p>they may do it out of peer pressure,</p>
<p>they may do it to relieve some internal sense,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re bored or they&rsquo;re just excited,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re high in novelty seeking.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people might try a drug,</p>
<p>far too many for us to get into or parse here.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t even want to do it,</p>
<p>but someone encourages them.</p>
<p>They will experience a huge dopamine release</p>
<p>and they will feel likely very good.</p>
<p>However, the next time they take it,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t feel quite as good</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t feel even as good the third time</p>
<p>or the next time.</p>
<p>But the amount of pain, the amount of craving</p>
<p>that they experience for the drug will increase over time.</p>
<p>So much of our pursuit of pleasure</p>
<p>is simply to reduce the pain of craving.</p>
<p>So the next time you experience something you really like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take you out of that experience,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important that you notice this,</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s something you really enjoy,</p>
<p>part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation</p>
<p>and wanting of more of that thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the pain system in action.</p>
<p>And so we can distinguish between dopamine,</p>
<p>which is really about pleasure,</p>
<p>and dopamine, which is really about motivation</p>
<p>to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that.</p>
<p>Dopamine isn&rsquo;t as much about pleasure</p>
<p>as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more</p>
<p>in order to reduce the amount of pain.</p>
<p>And we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain</p>
<p>and a craving, although people that miss a lover very badly</p>
<p>or that really crave a food very badly</p>
<p>or that are addicted to a drug and can&rsquo;t access it</p>
<p>will experience that as a physical craving</p>
<p>and a mental craving.</p>
<p>The body and brain are linked in this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, they&rsquo;ll describe it as painful.</p>
<p>They yearn for it.</p>
<p>And I think the word yearning is one that&rsquo;s very valuable</p>
<p>in this context because yearning seems to include</p>
<p>a whole body experience more than just wanting,</p>
<p>which could just be up in the mind.</p>
<p>So your desire for something is proportional</p>
<p>to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing,</p>
<p>but also how much pain you experience when you don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And you can now start to let your mind wander</p>
<p>into all sorts of examples of addictions</p>
<p>or things that you happen to like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the example that I sometimes use on here,</p>
<p>which is my love of croissants,</p>
<p>although several of you pointed out</p>
<p>these are called croissants,</p>
<p>but then it sounds like I&rsquo;m trying to speak French.</p>
<p>And I always tried to do that when I was a kid</p>
<p>and I went to a bilingual school and it failed then,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to fail now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to call them croissants.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re delicious.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>A really good one makes me want to eat six.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I have pretty good impulse control, I think,</p>
<p>but it makes me want to eat six.</p>
<p>I taste it and it tastes so delicious.</p>
<p>And unless I really force myself</p>
<p>to experience the taste of it in my mouth</p>
<p>and how flaky I&rsquo;m getting hungry for it right now</p>
<p>and delicious the croissant is,</p>
<p>mostly the taste of that croissant</p>
<p>makes me want to eat more croissants.</p>
<p>Now, eventually blood sugar goes up.</p>
<p>Satiety is reached, et cetera.</p>
<p>What happens then?</p>
<p>What is satisfaction and satiety about?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a separate neuromodulator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the neuromodulator serotonin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about oxytocin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a hormone system</p>
<p>that involves something called prolactin.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about all of those</p>
<p>in the book, The Molecule of More, wonderful book.</p>
<p>Those were described as the here and now molecules,</p>
<p>the ones that allow you to experience</p>
<p>your sensations and pleasure in the present</p>
<p>and for which the brain stops projecting</p>
<p>into the future.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about craving</p>
<p>and these so-called here and now molecules</p>
<p>and how those engage in a kind of push-pull balance</p>
<p>that will allow you to not just feel more motivated</p>
<p>but also to enjoy the things in life</p>
<p>that you are pursuing to a much greater degree.</p>
<p>We have neurons in an area of our brain</p>
<p>called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E.</p>
<p>The raphe releases serotonin</p>
<p>at different places in the brain.</p>
<p>Serotonin is the molecule of bliss</p>
<p>and contentment for what you already have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about exteroception.</p>
<p>Exteroception is a focus on the outside world,</p>
<p>everything beyond the confines of your skin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about interoception,</p>
<p>a focus on things that are happening internally</p>
<p>within the confines of your skin.</p>
<p>Dopamine and serotonin can be thought of</p>
<p>as related to exteroception.</p>
<p>Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us</p>
<p>that are beyond what we call our personal space</p>
<p>where we actually have to move and take action</p>
<p>in order to achieve things.</p>
<p>And serotonin in general has to do with the things</p>
<p>that are in our immediate here and now,</p>
<p>hence the description of these as the here and now molecules.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to point out that the body and the brain</p>
<p>can direct its attention towards things outside us</p>
<p>or inside us or split our attention between those.</p>
<p>I talked about this in a previous podcast,</p>
<p>but if you didn&rsquo;t see it, no problem.</p>
<p>Just understand that dopamine biases us</p>
<p>toward thinking about what we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules</p>
<p>like the endocannabinoids,</p>
<p>if you picked up on the word cannabinoid,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s like cannabis because cannabis</p>
<p>attaches to endocannabinoid receptors.</p>
<p>And the endocannabinoids are receptors and chemicals</p>
<p>that the cannabinoids that you naturally make</p>
<p>that are involved in things like forgetting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that pot smokers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the most terrific memory.</p>
<p>You may know a few that have great memories,</p>
<p>but chances are they would have even better memories</p>
<p>if they weren&rsquo;t pot smokers.</p>
<p>But you make these molecules that bind to these receptors</p>
<p>that make you feel kind of blissed out</p>
<p>and content in the present.</p>
<p>Those are receptors that exist in us</p>
<p>not for sake of consuming THC or marijuana,</p>
<p>but for sake of binding</p>
<p>of our natural endogenous cannabinoids.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got these two systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of like a push pull.</p>
<p>And if you were to say, do the, you know,</p>
<p>in the book, wherever you go, there you are.</p>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about this meditation practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than most meditation practices</p>
<p>where you eat one almond</p>
<p>and you focus all of your attention on the almond,</p>
<p>the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really a mindfulness practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s geared towards trying to take a behavior</p>
<p>which is normally about pursuit.</p>
<p>Normally feeding is we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>we engage in feeding because of dopamine.</p>
<p>We pursue more of a food</p>
<p>because of that pleasure pain relationship</p>
<p>I talked about before.</p>
<p>The focus on the one almond</p>
<p>or becoming very present in any behavior</p>
<p>that normally would be a kind of</p>
<p>extra receptive pursuit behavior</p>
<p>and bring it into the here and now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mental trick or a mental task</p>
<p>that the mindfulness community has really embraced</p>
<p>in order to try and create increased pleasure</p>
<p>for what you already have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really trying to accomplish a shift</p>
<p>from dopamine being released to serotonin</p>
<p>and the cannabinoid system</p>
<p>being involved in that behavior.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in mindfulness,</p>
<p>which is something I&rsquo;ve talked about before in this podcast</p>
<p>and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes</p>
<p>about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is a vast space.</p>
<p>That is a mindful practice</p>
<p>that a lot of people have engaged in.</p>
<p>And indeed it can give you deeper appreciation</p>
<p>for things that you already have.</p>
<p>Dopamine has the quality of making people</p>
<p>kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.</p>
<p>Look at people who are high on cocaine or amphetamine</p>
<p>and they are almost entirely extra receptive.</p>
<p>Drugs like marijuana, the opioids,</p>
<p>anything that really hits the serotonin system hard</p>
<p>tend to make people rather lethargic</p>
<p>and content to stay exactly where they are.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to pursue much at all.</p>
<p>Occasionally when people smoke marijuana or consume THC,</p>
<p>their appetite goes way up</p>
<p>and they really want to consume food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because of its effects on insulin</p>
<p>and its effects on blood sugar,</p>
<p>which is a slightly separate matter.</p>
<p>But since some of you probably your minds</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve gone to those either experiences</p>
<p>or reports of what pot does, that&rsquo;s why it does that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got these molecules like dopamine</p>
<p>that make you focused on the things you want</p>
<p>and the things you crave.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the molecules</p>
<p>that make you content with what you have.</p>
<p>So the most important thing perhaps</p>
<p>in creating a healthy emotional landscape</p>
<p>is to have a balance</p>
<p>between these two neuromodulator systems.</p>
<p>People that are always in anticipation and desire</p>
<p>and seeking, that&rsquo;s wonderful for pursuing goals.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s terrible for enjoying life.</p>
<p>And actually those people are actually quite difficult</p>
<p>to be around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain almost sociopathic element</p>
<p>to people who are what they call hyper dopaminergic.</p>
<p>People who are always on the dopaminergic scale</p>
<p>to the point where they are always pursuing goals.</p>
<p>In fact, those people are known to be,</p>
<p>at least in the psychological spectrum,</p>
<p>they can be very manipulative.</p>
<p>You know, dopamine and the pursuit of something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be high energy</p>
<p>and intense from the outside</p>
<p>when you observe it from the outside.</p>
<p>In fact, there are people who will manipulate</p>
<p>in order to get what they want.</p>
<p>This has been shown who have high levels</p>
<p>of dopamine release in their brain,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve learned that a kind of passive manipulation</p>
<p>is the best way to maneuver</p>
<p>through a particular environment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to focus too much on sociopathy</p>
<p>because those are kind of extreme examples,</p>
<p>but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal</p>
<p>and realize the series of steps that they need to take</p>
<p>in order to achieve that goal</p>
<p>can either do it through ethical means or non-ethical means.</p>
<p>They can do it through active pursuit,</p>
<p>being the kind of type A person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always declaring their goals</p>
<p>and going after it, posting it on Instagram,</p>
<p>telling everybody about it, trying to recruit others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that phenotype.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that kind of signature of dopamine.</p>
<p>And then there are the people that want to get what they want</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing it by always serving other people,</p>
<p>by always taking care of everybody else&rsquo;s needs,</p>
<p>by always trying to accomplish their goals,</p>
<p>but through a mode that at least from the outside</p>
<p>seems more passive or more about supporting others.</p>
<p>Neither of these are good or bad.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because dopamine is a molecule.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care how you reach your goals.</p>
<p>It only cares that you reach your goals</p>
<p>because the internal sensation is one, again,</p>
<p>of mild pleasure, a little bit of pain,</p>
<p>although more pain over time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not reaching those goals,</p>
<p>and it takes you away from the here and now.</p>
<p>So at about this point in the podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that some of you are thinking,</p>
<p>okay, great, I want more dopamine.</p>
<p>I want to be more motivated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to procrastinate as much.</p>
<p>And I want to be able to experience life.</p>
<p>I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way to do that,</p>
<p>but you have to understand the source of procrastination</p>
<p>is not one thing.</p>
<p>There are basically two kinds of procrastinators,</p>
<p>or so says the research.</p>
<p>The first kind are people that actually really enjoy</p>
<p>the stress of the impending deadline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way they can get into action.</p>
<p>These are people that really like the feeling of,</p>
<p>you know, something being due in an hour</p>
<p>and how activated and sharp and focused</p>
<p>that makes them feel.</p>
<p>Those people are people that are tapping</p>
<p>into the epinephrine system, the stress system,</p>
<p>and for which the stress really tightens</p>
<p>their ability to see.</p>
<p>It creates that soda straw view of the world.</p>
<p>It creates an action element in the body</p>
<p>that makes them feel like they want to move.</p>
<p>It really eliminates all the distractions for them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually leveraging stress, internal stress,</p>
<p>in order to achieve a state</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t seem to otherwise achieve.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you what to do in order to overcome</p>
<p>all kinds of procrastination,</p>
<p>but from a logical perspective, it makes sense,</p>
<p>therefore, for those kinds of people</p>
<p>to think about other ways</p>
<p>that they can get their system into activation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this in previous podcasts,</p>
<p>but a couple of those tools might be</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve called super oxygenation breathing,</p>
<p>which I admit is not always super oxygenating.</p>
<p>So this would be, if you didn&rsquo;t want to consume anything,</p>
<p>this could be 25 or 30 cycles of deep inhales and exhales.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely to create some anxiety and low-level stress.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s prone to panic attacks,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this, but it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>It will deploy adrenaline into your system</p>
<p>and you will find that your visual field is focused</p>
<p>and you will be able to work and focus better</p>
<p>than if you just kind of waited around</p>
<p>for some wave of motivation to wash over you.</p>
<p>Normally, you&rsquo;re waiting for that deadline</p>
<p>to come into sight, and then that&rsquo;s what the stimulus is.</p>
<p>But you can self-direct adrenaline release</p>
<p>without ingesting anything.</p>
<p>You can also ingest coffee, caffeine,</p>
<p>or mate or something like that,</p>
<p>which is what I prefer very often to coffee,</p>
<p>which has caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine does release dopamine at low levels.</p>
<p>How much it releases dopamine isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>It seems to increase firing in these neurons</p>
<p>in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%,</p>
<p>which is a pretty low level, but it can create agitation.</p>
<p>So for caffeine-sensitive people, that could be a problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about things like L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>the precursor to dopamine, or macunipurines.</p>
<p>I talked about that in the last episode,</p>
<p>but if you didn&rsquo;t see that, just to remind you,</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is present in red meats, it&rsquo;s in certain nuts,</p>
<p>and L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>You can supplement L-tyrosine if you like.</p>
<p>You will get a big inflection in dopamine,</p>
<p>but there is a crash associated with it.</p>
<p>However, it will increase motivation in the short term.</p>
<p>Not suggesting anyone do this.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear, say what I always say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a doctor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>I profess things.</p>
<p>You have to know whether or not these things</p>
<p>are appropriate for your mental and physical health or not.</p>
<p>So you need to consult a doctor.</p>
<p>For instance, people who suffer from schizotypal</p>
<p>or schizophrenia or mania should probably</p>
<p>not be taking supplements</p>
<p>that increase their dopamine levels.</p>
<p>Now, if you can&rsquo;t increase your level of focus</p>
<p>and your level of alertness</p>
<p>and your level of motivation using breathing,</p>
<p>well, then there might be something else at play.</p>
<p>There are other procrastinators</p>
<p>for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not making enough dopamine.</p>
<p>And for those people, there are a variety of things</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine.</p>
<p>I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about mucunipurines, which is 99.9% L-DOPA,</p>
<p>the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>So there are people that do much better</p>
<p>when they take things that increase their dopamine levels.</p>
<p>There are antidepressants like Welbutrin, Bupriron,</p>
<p>which increase, is the other name for it,</p>
<p>which increase dopamine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>It can increase risk of epileptic attacks</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re epileptic.</p>
<p>So again, you have to talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>but they will increase dopamine and motivation and focus.</p>
<p>However, if you think back to our earlier discussion</p>
<p>about dopamine, dopamine, if it&rsquo;s very high,</p>
<p>creates a sense of pleasure and the desire for more.</p>
<p>So you can also become a person</p>
<p>for which enough is never enough.</p>
<p>The only thing that dopamine really wants</p>
<p>is more of the thing that releases dopamine.</p>
<p>And so big inflections in dopamine,</p>
<p>whether or not they come from cocaine</p>
<p>or whether or not they come from a supplementation,</p>
<p>caffeine exercise study regime,</p>
<p>will just make you want more of something.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve all heard before of growth mindset,</p>
<p>this incredible discovery of my colleague, Carol Dweck,</p>
<p>where some of these positive mindsets</p>
<p>that the psychology community has put forth</p>
<p>as really good for pursuit of goals</p>
<p>and pursuit of things that require long bouts of effort.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine</p>
<p>to that process psychologically,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re starting to augment the amount of dopamine,</p>
<p>increase the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>through things like supplementation and prescription drugs,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is you&rsquo;re not only going to need</p>
<p>to pursue more and more of the sorts of things</p>
<p>that are associated with the dopamine,</p>
<p>so doing more studying, more sport, more pursuit,</p>
<p>higher mountains, more money, more whatever,</p>
<p>but we know that over time, the mirror image of that,</p>
<p>the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase.</p>
<p>This is the pleasure-pain relationship</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>So in a few moments, I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>how to think about healthy dopamine schedules,</p>
<p>but I just want to take a step back for a second</p>
<p>and talk a little bit about the flip side of dopamine,</p>
<p>what happens after this so-called dopamine crash,</p>
<p>what mechanisms are installed in us,</p>
<p>because believe it or not, there are mechanisms</p>
<p>that are installed in all of us</p>
<p>that really put the complete and total break on dopamine,</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re there and what they do,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve experienced these before,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually ways that you can navigate them,</p>
<p>these dopamine crashes</p>
<p>or these intentional dopamine suppression mechanisms</p>
<p>in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules</p>
<p>and to feel more motivated.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms</p>
<p>in all humans is the neural circuitry</p>
<p>designed for seeking out mates and for reproduction,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because the continuation of any one species</p>
<p>is the primary driver for any species,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the reality.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m removing all context here,</p>
<p>so whatever I say, of course, it&rsquo;s on a backdrop</p>
<p>of consensual, age-appropriate, species-appropriate,</p>
<p>context-appropriate, all of that,</p>
<p>this is not about the sociology of reproduction in sex,</p>
<p>this is about the biology.</p>
<p>The biology of sex in males and females,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s XX chromosome, XY chromosome,</p>
<p>XXY, XYY, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>the reality is that dopamine is released on anticipation</p>
<p>and consummation of sex and reproduction,</p>
<p>and after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dramatic decrease in dopamine</p>
<p>and an increase in a hormone called prolactin.</p>
<p>Now, prolactin is associated with milk letdown</p>
<p>in lactating mothers, it&rsquo;s also present in males,</p>
<p>and in general, prolactin creates a sense</p>
<p>of lethargy, of stillness, and lack of desire to move,</p>
<p>and lack of desire to pursue more</p>
<p>of whatever released the dopamine.</p>
<p>Prolactin, in fact, sets the refractory period</p>
<p>on a male&rsquo;s ability to mate again.</p>
<p>Now, this is going to vary tremendously</p>
<p>from individual to individual,</p>
<p>it also can, there are data showing</p>
<p>that it can vary tremendously</p>
<p>from mate pairing to mate pairing.</p>
<p>The number one thing that releases dopamine is novelty,</p>
<p>and it is true that the refractory period is shortened</p>
<p>by the introduction of novel mates.</p>
<p>This was first shown in a kind of classic experiment</p>
<p>in, of all things, in chickens,</p>
<p>this is called the Coolidge effect,</p>
<p>and the story is, the story goes,</p>
<p>and I believe it&rsquo;s a true story,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually in all the neuroendocrinology textbooks,</p>
<p>so I believe it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>is that President Calvin Coolidge</p>
<p>was visiting a chicken farm,</p>
<p>they were just being taken around,</p>
<p>and the person who was hosting the visit</p>
<p>showed them a rooster,</p>
<p>that was Coolidge and his wife were on the visit,</p>
<p>and said, this rooster copulates thousands of times per day,</p>
<p>and Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind of elbowed</p>
<p>President Coolidge and said, uh, you hear that?</p>
<p>Kind of like pointing out the prowess of this rooster,</p>
<p>and Coolidge said, yeah, but let me ask a question,</p>
<p>same hen or different hens?</p>
<p>It turns out it was different hens,</p>
<p>and the reason is,</p>
<p>the introduction of a novel mate increases dopamine levels,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s interesting about this</p>
<p>is that after copulation,</p>
<p>prolactin goes through the roof</p>
<p>and prevents further copulation, dopamine crashes,</p>
<p>but the introduction of some sort of novelty</p>
<p>shortens this, now, this is not a ploy</p>
<p>for people to change mates often,</p>
<p>what this is is a story</p>
<p>about the dopamine and prolactin system</p>
<p>that also exists in humans,</p>
<p>now, there are actually things</p>
<p>that people in certain communities take</p>
<p>in order to bypass these refractory periods,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually drugs that increase dopamine</p>
<p>suppress prolactin and vice versa,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually another way to suppress prolactin,</p>
<p>vitamin B6 is a fairly potent prolactin inhibitor as is zinc,</p>
<p>and if you look out there in the literature,</p>
<p>and for those either in the wellness</p>
<p>and kind of sports performance community,</p>
<p>a lot of the so-called, quote unquote, testosterone boosters</p>
<p>are actually combinations of vitamin B6 and zinc,</p>
<p>which inhibit prolactin</p>
<p>and by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine,</p>
<p>so they do have some functional effect in that regard,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really increasing testosterone directly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re suppressing prolactin levels,</p>
<p>and there are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia,</p>
<p>which leads to massive decreases in libido, et cetera,</p>
<p>and there are prescription drugs</p>
<p>to treat hyperprolactinemia,</p>
<p>which of course, you should always talk</p>
<p>to an endocrinologist</p>
<p>about those sorts of prescription drugs,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s interesting that this very basic mechanism</p>
<p>of dopamine and prolactin,</p>
<p>this sort of motivation, no, no more motivation,</p>
<p>is a system that evolved for reproduction first,</p>
<p>but that actually takes place</p>
<p>and you can see in elsewhere in the world,</p>
<p>for instance, schizophrenia,</p>
<p>a disease that has many different types and facets,</p>
<p>but schizophrenia is a case of,</p>
<p>often of hyperactivation of the dopamine system,</p>
<p>so much so that it can make people feel kind of high,</p>
<p>they hallucinate, I mean, we&rsquo;re talking very, very high</p>
<p>or dysregulated dopamine circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>one of the treatments for schizophrenia</p>
<p>are drugs that block dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>and if you have the, it&rsquo;s unfortunate,</p>
<p>you know, there are so many people</p>
<p>that are out on the street these days</p>
<p>who have schizophrenia,</p>
<p>some of whom are taking their meds,</p>
<p>some of whom aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you ever see somebody on the street</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing what&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like a lip smacking and writhing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually called tardive dyskinesia,</p>
<p>this is a movement disorder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created by taking these anti-dopaminergic drugs,</p>
<p>so you can imagine these anti-dopaminergic drugs,</p>
<p>while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations,</p>
<p>they create these movement problems</p>
<p>because of dopamine&rsquo;s importance for the movement circuitry,</p>
<p>so-called pyramidal circuitry for the aficionados,</p>
<p>in addition, you sometimes see in males</p>
<p>that take these drugs,</p>
<p>drugs like haloperidol and the other dopamine blockers,</p>
<p>that they actually develop breast tissue, gynecomastia,</p>
<p>so the development of male breast tissue</p>
<p>is because of the elevated levels of prolactin</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re suppressing their dopamine so much,</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s a really extreme case,</p>
<p>but maybe perhaps if you see somebody</p>
<p>engaging these very strange kind of face writhing</p>
<p>and body writhing behaviors,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually not a consequence of their mental illness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a consequence most often of the drugs</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re taking to treat the mental illness,</p>
<p>those are side effects of those drugs,</p>
<p>now prolactin is increased</p>
<p>anytime we have some really heightened intense experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just released after sex and reproduction,</p>
<p>prolactin is released after some major event,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually responsible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thought for some of postpartum depression,</p>
<p>for different types of kind of the let down, the low,</p>
<p>I can distinctly remember that after finals</p>
<p>or after publishing a big paper,</p>
<p>I would be very, very happy,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;d find that, oh, you know, like what next,</p>
<p>or things might seem a little bit dimmed or dulled out</p>
<p>for the next day or so, or the following week,</p>
<p>the timescales on these are going to vary</p>
<p>because some people release a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>for a very long time in response to something great,</p>
<p>and other people have a quick inflection of dopamine</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re back to feeling not so great,</p>
<p>it really varies from person to person,</p>
<p>in fact, long ago,</p>
<p>as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry</p>
<p>and the relationship between dopamine and prolactin,</p>
<p>I started to leverage this,</p>
<p>believe it or not, after some major event,</p>
<p>I would take a couple hundred milligrams of vitamin B6,</p>
<p>I think for people who have diabetic neuropathy,</p>
<p>you need to be careful with vitamin B6,</p>
<p>check with your doctor, I was told,</p>
<p>although I haven&rsquo;t found the literature on this,</p>
<p>that it can in some cases exacerbate peripheral neuropathy,</p>
<p>but for most people, it&rsquo;s thought to be reasonably safe,</p>
<p>but again, always check with your physician,</p>
<p>but I would take some B6 to kind of offset some of that low,</p>
<p>and actually, I don&rsquo;t know if it was subjective or not,</p>
<p>but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect,</p>
<p>I also started just internalizing</p>
<p>the fact that dopamine is so subjective,</p>
<p>there are objective aspects to dopamine</p>
<p>and how much is released,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some subjective effects to dopamine,</p>
<p>and so one of the things that you can do</p>
<p>in order to generally just be a happier person,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re a person in pursuit of long-term goals</p>
<p>of any kind, is the longer that you can extend</p>
<p>that positive phase of the dopamine release,</p>
<p>and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that,</p>
<p>the better, and you can actually do this cognitively,</p>
<p>I used to joke with my lab that when we&rsquo;d publish a paper,</p>
<p>I would get really excited,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t allow myself to get too excited,</p>
<p>what I wanted to do instead,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve still tried to do is try and extend</p>
<p>the arc of that positive experience</p>
<p>as long as I possibly can, simply by thinking back,</p>
<p>like, oh, that was really cool,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed doing that work,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the discovery,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed doing that with the people</p>
<p>that I was working with at the time,</p>
<p>what a pleasure that was,</p>
<p>I can get this very easily from pictures of people</p>
<p>and things like Costello that I really enjoy,</p>
<p>trips that I&rsquo;ve taken, so you can extend pleasure</p>
<p>without having to engage in the behavior over and over,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extending the arc of that dopamine release,</p>
<p>as well, it offsets some of the pain</p>
<p>of not having that experience occur</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>now, for the high performers out there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably familiar with this,</p>
<p>many people who have a big achievement,</p>
<p>their first thoughts are, well, now what,</p>
<p>what am I going to do next,</p>
<p>how am I ever going to exceed that,</p>
<p>and indeed, many people who are very high</p>
<p>on this kind of dopamine sensation</p>
<p>and novelty-seeking scale are prone to addiction,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals,</p>
<p>of exteroception, to the neglect of these internal mechanisms</p>
<p>that allow them to feel calm and happy,</p>
<p>so for people that are very driven, very motivated,</p>
<p>adopting a practice of being able to engage</p>
<p>in the here and now, the sort of almond-type practices</p>
<p>we talked about earlier, of learning how to achieve</p>
<p>a really good night&rsquo;s sleep on a regular basis</p>
<p>through tools and mechanisms I talked about</p>
<p>in previous podcasts, gives a sort of balance</p>
<p>to the pleasure-seeking and offsetting of pain</p>
<p>and the pleasure in the here and now,</p>
<p>so pleasure is really two things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a joy in pursuit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the joy in what you have,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a beautiful model of emotional development</p>
<p>that was developed by Alan Shore,</p>
<p>a professor at UCLA and psychiatrist,</p>
<p>that talks about some of the basics</p>
<p>of good infant-parent attachment,</p>
<p>where good parenting that leads</p>
<p>to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation</p>
<p>tends to include both sides</p>
<p>of this dopamine-serotonin spectrum,</p>
<p>you talk about the relationship between child and parent,</p>
<p>typically it was the mother, but also father,</p>
<p>where you can get the child really excited</p>
<p>by kind of squealing and ramping them up</p>
<p>or talking about something or ice cream or play,</p>
<p>and the kid gets very excited,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the dopaminergic system,</p>
<p>the anticipation of something that&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>but as well, engaging with children in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really about everything that you have</p>
<p>right in the here and now, the reading of the book,</p>
<p>the kids always seem to ask one more time, one more,</p>
<p>they seem to want more of the things that they enjoy,</p>
<p>but really engaging with them in a way</p>
<p>that increases their sense of pleasure</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s right there,</p>
<p>as well as giving them a lot of things to be excited about</p>
<p>and positive anticipation.</p>
<p>Now, having worked years ago with at-risk kids</p>
<p>and also with young kids at summer camps</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>one of the things that you learn</p>
<p>is you never say maybe to a kid about a reward,</p>
<p>if you say we might have ice cream later,</p>
<p>you are essentially saying we are having ice cream,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t hear the maybe part,</p>
<p>and it turns out adults don&rsquo;t either,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called reward prediction error,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t really talked about it deeply</p>
<p>in the context of the dopamine system,</p>
<p>dopamine, as I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>is involved in anticipation of wanting, not of having,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involved in motivation toward the thing that you want,</p>
<p>and it biases us towards action,</p>
<p>reward prediction error equals the actual amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released in response to something</p>
<p>versus minus the amount that&rsquo;s expected, okay?</p>
<p>So if you tell a kid we might have ice cream,</p>
<p>they hear we&rsquo;re going to have ice cream and they expect it,</p>
<p>and if you later say, well, we&rsquo;re not going to have ice cream</p>
<p>and I said maybe,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually going to lead to a much bigger crash</p>
<p>in dopamine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to lead to a negative signal,</p>
<p>a punishment signal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally going to feel like pain,</p>
<p>so kids, you can leverage this,</p>
<p>if your parents say maybe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re effectively telling your dopamine system,</p>
<p>absolutely, now adults are like this too,</p>
<p>if we think something might happen and it doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big crash in our affect, in our emotionality,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because that dopamine system</p>
<p>goes from firing about three to four times per second</p>
<p>to about 10 or 15 times per second</p>
<p>in the possibility that something might happen,</p>
<p>possibility is deeply woven into our biology</p>
<p>of the dopamine and motivation system</p>
<p>as a way for us,</p>
<p>presumably in ancient times to explore novel territories</p>
<p>and get a sense that maybe there&rsquo;s water there,</p>
<p>maybe there are mates there,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s better food there,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s resources there,</p>
<p>the maybe is an important thing that in language terms,</p>
<p>maybe means maybe,</p>
<p>but in neurobiological terms,</p>
<p>maybe means perhaps there&rsquo;s going to be the surprise</p>
<p>of an even bigger dopamine reward,</p>
<p>and the one thing dopamine loves</p>
<p>more than anything else is surprise,</p>
<p>when we get something positive,</p>
<p>we go to the mailbox,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re expecting some bills and you open it up</p>
<p>and you get a letter from somebody</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t thought about in a long time</p>
<p>and you adore that person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge dopamine release,</p>
<p>it actually triggers neural plasticity,</p>
<p>you probably never forget that</p>
<p>because of the way that dopamine gates plasticity,</p>
<p>when we get a surprise of something that we didn&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>also it creates plasticity,</p>
<p>so the surprise, novelty, motivation and reward,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all woven into this package that we call dopamine,</p>
<p>and the cool thing is,</p>
<p>you can actually regulate this whole system</p>
<p>in a way that will steer you</p>
<p>or lean you towards more positive anticipation</p>
<p>of things in life and less disappointment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simply a matter of adjusting</p>
<p>what we call the dopamine schedule.</p>
<p>Okay, a couple of things before we continue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about attention deficit in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but before that,</p>
<p>I want to talk about something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>but that you may not be aware of,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re aware of,</p>
<p>you may still be doing,</p>
<p>which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s creating a sense of disappointment</p>
<p>in ways that are most likely hurting you</p>
<p>mentally and physically,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the blunting of dopamine</p>
<p>by viewing light in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>I realize this is not a discussion</p>
<p>about sleep and circadian rhythms,</p>
<p>but the data now are so strong</p>
<p>showing that viewing bright light</p>
<p>from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. too often</p>
<p>triggers activation of this circuit called the habenula,</p>
<p>so this is eye to,</p>
<p>it goes from your retina</p>
<p>to a structure called the habenula, H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A,</p>
<p>then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry,</p>
<p>and it suppresses the activation of the reward circuitry,</p>
<p>not just in that moment,</p>
<p>but to things that you normally</p>
<p>positively anticipate and pursue,</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up now</p>
<p>is because I haven&rsquo;t really gone into depth</p>
<p>on the dopamine system before,</p>
<p>now you understand you have this very precious reward system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a double-edged sword,</p>
<p>it needs to be taken care of and treated well,</p>
<p>you want to use it, but not overuse it, et cetera,</p>
<p>but getting bright light exposure</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>is reducing your capacity to release dopamine,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just about the sleep</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not getting in that time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also that you&rsquo;re not getting the dopamine</p>
<p>that would otherwise be available to you,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re actually taking,</p>
<p>think of light in the middle of the night</p>
<p>as a kind of antagonist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a blocker of dopamine,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;ll help you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who has to work</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and you want to bypass this dopamine suppression,</p>
<p>please see the episode about jet lag and shift work,</p>
<p>because there are a lot of tips there</p>
<p>that will allow you to do that.</p>
<p>In order to understand how to control the dopamine system,</p>
<p>how to leverage it for a better life,</p>
<p>you need to understand the results</p>
<p>of a very important experiment,</p>
<p>this experiment was able to separate</p>
<p>pleasure from motivation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very simple,</p>
<p>but like many simple experiments,</p>
<p>a very elegant experiment,</p>
<p>what they did,</p>
<p>and this has now been done in animals and in humans,</p>
<p>they offered rats food,</p>
<p>it was a food that they particularly liked,</p>
<p>and the animals would lever press</p>
<p>for a pellet of food,</p>
<p>kind of classic experiment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d eat the food,</p>
<p>and they presumably liked the food,</p>
<p>because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it,</p>
<p>great,</p>
<p>they took other rats,</p>
<p>they eliminated the dopamine neurons,</p>
<p>you can do this by injection of a neurotoxin</p>
<p>that destroys these neurons,</p>
<p>so they actually had no dopamine in their brain,</p>
<p>they have no ability to release dopamine,</p>
<p>and they gave them a lever,</p>
<p>the rats would sit there and they&rsquo;d hit the lever</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d eat the food,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still enjoyed the food,</p>
<p>so you say,</p>
<p>well, okay, so dopamine isn&rsquo;t involved in motivation,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t involved in pleasure,</p>
<p>no, it absolutely is,</p>
<p>they could still enjoy the food,</p>
<p>but if they moved the rat,</p>
<p>literally one body length away from the lever,</p>
<p>what they found was the animals that had dopamine</p>
<p>would move over to the lever,</p>
<p>press it and eat,</p>
<p>and the ones,</p>
<p>the rats that did not have dopamine available to them,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even move one body length,</p>
<p>one rat length to the lever</p>
<p>in order to press it and get the food,</p>
<p>dopamine therefore is not about</p>
<p>the ability to experience pleasure,</p>
<p>it is about motivation for pleasure,</p>
<p>this has been repeated in humans</p>
<p>in a variety of different scenarios,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really do the lever press thing quite as easily,</p>
<p>but we know that people that have low levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are simply less motivated</p>
<p>even though they can achieve pleasure,</p>
<p>and this has serious ramifications</p>
<p>for the fact that now,</p>
<p>quote unquote pleasure or ways to induce</p>
<p>things that we believe give us pleasure</p>
<p>are everywhere and they&rsquo;re within reach,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to forage for our food,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of highly processed,</p>
<p>high sugar, high fat foods,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also foods that are healthy that taste good,</p>
<p>and hopefully they&rsquo;re pretty easy to get,</p>
<p>all that different people have different access</p>
<p>to things of course,</p>
<p>but dopamine isn&rsquo;t about the ability to experience pleasure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures,</p>
<p>and so many of you are probably thinking,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m not a very motivated person,</p>
<p>like you talked about the one kind of procrastination</p>
<p>earlier, what about when I just feel kind of meh about life,</p>
<p>now, for some of you there may be a real clinical depression</p>
<p>and you should talk to a professional,</p>
<p>there are very good prescription drugs</p>
<p>that can really help people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also great non-drug treatments of psychotherapy</p>
<p>and other treatments that are being developed</p>
<p>in addition to psychotherapy</p>
<p>and the various kinds of psychoanalysis, et cetera,</p>
<p>that one can use,</p>
<p>I think the data really points to the fact</p>
<p>that a combination of pharmacology and talk therapies</p>
<p>are generally best,</p>
<p>and there are a huge range of these things,</p>
<p>I know many of you are in these professions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to talk about that right now,</p>
<p>there is a compound that&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>in the supplement space that isn&rsquo;t mucunipurines L-DOPA,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t promoting massive releases of dopamine</p>
<p>or even dopamine alone,</p>
<p>but a combination of dopamine and serotonin,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an intriguing molecule,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sold over the counter,</p>
<p>again, you have to check with your healthcare provider</p>
<p>before you would take anything or remove anything,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s phenethylamine or PEA,</p>
<p>PEA or beta phenethylamine</p>
<p>releases dopamine at low levels,</p>
<p>but also serotonin at low levels,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules</p>
<p>as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules,</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s response to this varies widely,</p>
<p>but many people report feeling heightened sense</p>
<p>of mental acuity, wellbeing, et cetera,</p>
<p>it is a bit of a stimulant,</p>
<p>like anything that triggers activation of the dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine pathway,</p>
<p>but it is an interesting supplement,</p>
<p>I actually haven&rsquo;t tried it before,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t report on my own experiences,</p>
<p>I will point you however to examine.com,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be a Huberman Lab podcast episode</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t point you to examine.com,</p>
<p>this incredible free resource</p>
<p>where you can put in any supplement</p>
<p>and it will tell you the quote unquote human effect matrix,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll point you to the various studies,</p>
<p>we always provide a link to this in the caption,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing resource,</p>
<p>so you can go there to explore more,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t talked about beta phenethylamine before</p>
<p>in previous podcasts,</p>
<p>and I wanted to add it to the list of things</p>
<p>that tap into the dopamine system</p>
<p>that are in this, I guess we call it now</p>
<p>the supplementation space.</p>
<p>I personally am fascinated by these supplements</p>
<p>and the things that exist out there</p>
<p>that are non-prescription,</p>
<p>that seem to, at least in some people,</p>
<p>have positive effects,</p>
<p>for instance, last episode,</p>
<p>we talked about acetyl L-carnitine,</p>
<p>which there are several papers</p>
<p>that report antidepressant effects,</p>
<p>as well as positive effects on other things,</p>
<p>sperm health, ovarian health, et cetera,</p>
<p>I learned from a colleague</p>
<p>that acetyl L-carnitine in Europe</p>
<p>is actually a prescription drug,</p>
<p>in the US, it&rsquo;s sold over the counter,</p>
<p>so I guess depending on where you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>the availability might vary,</p>
<p>and as always, I put the caveat,</p>
<p>you have to check with your healthcare provider</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fascinated by the fact that these things exist</p>
<p>and that they lie somewhere between prescription drugs</p>
<p>and doing nothing,</p>
<p>and that makes them interesting compounds,</p>
<p>and I think that PEA, beta phenethylamine,</p>
<p>is yet another one of such compounds.</p>
<p>I am going to talk a lot about attention deficit</p>
<p>and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p>
<p>in a future episode,</p>
<p>but I do want to mention it today</p>
<p>in the context of dopamine and impulsivity,</p>
<p>so ADHD or ADD,</p>
<p>so attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD,</p>
<p>are clinical diagnoses,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people nowadays walk around</p>
<p>and say, I have ADD or you have ADD,</p>
<p>and indeed, one can create a sort of ADD</p>
<p>by attention switching all the time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Cal Newport,</p>
<p>he wrote the book, Deep Work,</p>
<p>I believe he was the one who said,</p>
<p>context switching is terrible for the brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the worst thing for the brain</p>
<p>because then the brain learns to context switch,</p>
<p>and real deep work, productivity,</p>
<p>learning of all kinds,</p>
<p>good relationships of all kinds</p>
<p>really come from depth of experience,</p>
<p>not from breadth of experience within the moment,</p>
<p>and so I think it&rsquo;s important to know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s clinical ADHD and ADD,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the kind that people are kind of inducing</p>
<p>and through distraction and social media</p>
<p>and phones, et cetera,</p>
<p>and those can sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD,</p>
<p>but I want to talk about ADHD and ADD in kids just briefly,</p>
<p>the drugs that are normally given to treat those conditions,</p>
<p>ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall,</p>
<p>things that have very amphetamine-like qualities</p>
<p>and structures,</p>
<p>and you might ask, why would they do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that in kids,</p>
<p>these activate that forebrain circuitry,</p>
<p>the break that exists on the deeper mesolimbic circuitry,</p>
<p>so as you recall, there&rsquo;s the VTA and nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of accelerators on dopamine,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity,</p>
<p>and those drugs tend to increase the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>and it reduces impulsivity,</p>
<p>in fact, there&rsquo;s a experiment described</p>
<p>in the book, The Molecule of More,</p>
<p>which is really interesting,</p>
<p>where they looked at impulsivity in obese children,</p>
<p>and it turns out, they did this experiment in a safe way,</p>
<p>that they looked at kids,</p>
<p>both obese kids and non-obese kids,</p>
<p>and their willingness to cross a very busy highway,</p>
<p>and it turns out that the obese kids got hit by cars</p>
<p>more often than non-obese children,</p>
<p>and it turns out this was a virtual reality experiment,</p>
<p>and it had nothing to do with the fact</p>
<p>that they were obese or limitations on movement</p>
<p>or speed of movement,</p>
<p>it was that the obese children were more impulsive</p>
<p>in a variety of contexts,</p>
<p>not just in this virtual crossing the street thing,</p>
<p>and it turns out, the data point to the fact</p>
<p>that impulsivity at age 10 is actually predictive</p>
<p>of overeating disorders at a later stage in life,</p>
<p>so some of these drugs that are designed</p>
<p>to create heightened activity in the breaking system,</p>
<p>the decelerator of the reward pathway,</p>
<p>are designed to reduce impulsivity</p>
<p>because they suppress the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>and they allow, hopefully, they allow children,</p>
<p>and when they become adults,</p>
<p>to better control the schedule of dopamine release,</p>
<p>so now let&rsquo;s talk about what is a dopamine schedule</p>
<p>and how you can leverage this</p>
<p>in order to have heightened levels of motivation,</p>
<p>but not get so much dopamine</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re experiencing a crash afterwards,</p>
<p>and also so that you can experience heightened pleasure</p>
<p>from the various pursuits that you are engaged in in life.</p>
<p>I know many of you are interested in tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to be more motivated,</p>
<p>to focus longer, sleep better,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what the Huberman Lab podcast is all about,</p>
<p>but always framed in the context</p>
<p>of neurobiological principles and objective mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are some tools that we can apply</p>
<p>to the dopamine system and motivation</p>
<p>that can really improve our ability</p>
<p>to stay in pursuit of things,</p>
<p>as well as enjoy things after we&rsquo;ve achieved our goals,</p>
<p>or even enroute our goals,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the key principle.</p>
<p>Dopamine is very subjective,</p>
<p>meaning you can either allow yourself</p>
<p>to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone,</p>
<p>of achieving, or some craving, or not.</p>
<p>Now, that won&rsquo;t work in the extreme cases of drugs,</p>
<p>like cocaine and amphetamine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually pretty powerful</p>
<p>what one can do with the subjective system.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m going to describe you an experiment</p>
<p>that highlights just how powerful the subjective readout,</p>
<p>or the subjective interpretation of a given experience</p>
<p>really can be, even at the level of pharmacology.</p>
<p>I love examples of subjective effects</p>
<p>over things that would otherwise seem hardwired,</p>
<p>because they really illustrate the interplay</p>
<p>between our cognition, our belief system,</p>
<p>and what would otherwise be these,</p>
<p>just plug and chug kind of mechanisms</p>
<p>of you eat X amount of chocolate,</p>
<p>or you drink X amount of water</p>
<p>after being water deprived for a certain amount of time,</p>
<p>and you get X amount of dopamine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>The experiment was just published on March 18th, 2021,</p>
<p>so very recently, and the title of the experiment</p>
<p>is Expectation for Stimulant Type,</p>
<p>Modifies Caffeine&rsquo;s Effects on Mood and Cognition.</p>
<p>This was done in college students,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fascinating study.</p>
<p>What they did is they gave college students</p>
<p>either placebo, essentially nothing,</p>
<p>or 200 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>200 milligrams of caffeine is about what&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p>well, a typical coffee, like a medium coffee</p>
<p>that you would buy, a drip coffee,</p>
<p>or a coffee that you&rsquo;d make at home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fair amount of caffeine.</p>
<p>If you were to take it in pill form,</p>
<p>it would definitely make you feel more alert,</p>
<p>unless you were one of those mutants, literally mutants,</p>
<p>that is insensitive to caffeine,</p>
<p>and those mutants are pretty rare.</p>
<p>So they took 65 undergraduate students in college.</p>
<p>They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine,</p>
<p>and they told them</p>
<p>that they were either getting caffeine or Adderall.</p>
<p>Now, Adderall cognitively</p>
<p>carries a very different expectation.</p>
<p>College students know Adderall</p>
<p>to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine.</p>
<p>They know it to create a sort of high.</p>
<p>This is the way the students described it,</p>
<p>and they thought that it would increase their level of focus</p>
<p>and their ability to perform work.</p>
<p>So what was really interesting</p>
<p>is there was definitely an effect of placebo versus caffeine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising, however, right?</p>
<p>You take a placebo, you may or may not feel more alert,</p>
<p>but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>very likely you&rsquo;re going to feel very alert.</p>
<p>But there was also an effect</p>
<p>of whether or not the students</p>
<p>thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.</p>
<p>The subjects receiving caffeine</p>
<p>reported feeling more stimulated, anxious, and motivated</p>
<p>than the subjects that received the placebo, okay.</p>
<p>But the ones that expected Adderall</p>
<p>reported stronger amphetamine effects.</p>
<p>So they felt much more high.</p>
<p>They performed better on a working memory test.</p>
<p>And in general, they had all the increased cognitive effects</p>
<p>that would have been seen with Adderall,</p>
<p>but they were only ingesting caffeine.</p>
<p>And so this shows an interaction between the drug, caffeine,</p>
<p>and the expectation that it was Adderall.</p>
<p>So it led to heightened performance</p>
<p>simply because the students</p>
<p>thought they were getting Adderall.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know whether or not</p>
<p>they told them at the end that it wasn&rsquo;t Adderall.</p>
<p>I doubt that they did.</p>
<p>This, if you want to look it up,</p>
<p>the study was published in</p>
<p>the Journal of Experimental Clinical Psychopharmacology.</p>
<p>The paper is Luby et al., L-O-O-B-Y et al.</p>
<p>And again, it was just published March 18th, 2021.</p>
<p>Speaks to the fact that,</p>
<p>yes, there are so-called placebo effects,</p>
<p>but this is different than placebo.</p>
<p>This is a belief effect about what the specific reactions</p>
<p>to a given stimulant ought to be.</p>
<p>And I think this is very important</p>
<p>because I think that it points to the fact that</p>
<p>the top-down, the kind of higher-level cognitive processes</p>
<p>are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects of,</p>
<p>say, dopamine release or adrenaline release</p>
<p>or epinephrine release</p>
<p>in ways that can positively impact performance.</p>
<p>In this case, it was a positive improvement</p>
<p>in working memory and focus.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re talking about caffeine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out a study that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>This was published in Journal of Neuroscience,</p>
<p>which is the Society for Neuroscience&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of flagship journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good journal.</p>
<p>And what they showed was that caffeine</p>
<p>can increase dopamine release in the brain by about 30%.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t surprising.</p>
<p>I even said that earlier.</p>
<p>But what they also showed is that it has a protective effect</p>
<p>on dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>So caffeine, in some cases,</p>
<p>may not just increase dopamine release,</p>
<p>but it might actually have a protective effect</p>
<p>on dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s distinctly different from some claims</p>
<p>that drugs like MDMA, ecstasy, have been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been argued, are neurotoxic</p>
<p>for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons.</p>
<p>The study that was published about that</p>
<p>in the journal Science,</p>
<p>which is an extremely prestigious, excellent journal,</p>
<p>later, it was shown that it wasn&rsquo;t MDMA ecstasy</p>
<p>that was given in that case.</p>
<p>It was actually amphetamine,</p>
<p>which is known to destroy dopaminergic</p>
<p>and serotonergic neurons.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means that low levels of caffeine may,</p>
<p>at least in a few studies,</p>
<p>be protective for dopamine neurons over time.</p>
<p>That MDMA ecstasy,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s in clinical trials right now</p>
<p>for the treatment of trauma, PTSD,</p>
<p>of various kinds and depression,</p>
<p>but still illegal at this point in time,</p>
<p>may, although it doesn&rsquo;t appear yet</p>
<p>from any published studies,</p>
<p>destroy dopaminergic neurons,</p>
<p>perhaps serotonergic neurons.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real asterisk and a question mark there.</p>
<p>But amphetamine, and in particular methamphetamine,</p>
<p>is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think any of us needed any additional reasons</p>
<p>to avoid methamphetamine,</p>
<p>this drug that creates huge increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>and then huge crashes from that dopamine.</p>
<p>Very destructive drug.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>From time to time, I&rsquo;ve talked about nicotine on here,</p>
<p>not smoking, because obviously smoking is bad.</p>
<p>Lung cancer is bad for health, et cetera.</p>
<p>But nicotine, it&rsquo;s in supplemental form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned that a very famous neuroscientist,</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winning scientist,</p>
<p>chews a lot of Nicorette.</p>
<p>I know other people who chew Nicorette.</p>
<p>They believe in its neuroprotective effects</p>
<p>for Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And indeed, nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.</p>
<p>We talked about that earlier.</p>
<p>Whether or not it has a protective effect isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>The protective effects might be through the noradrenergic</p>
<p>and acetylcholine systems.</p>
<p>Those findings are still unclear,</p>
<p>but it is interesting to note</p>
<p>that nicotine can increase prolactin somewhat.</p>
<p>There are a couple studies,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to link to them in the caption,</p>
<p>that shows that nicotine taken too much</p>
<p>over too long periods of time can also increase prolactin,</p>
<p>which again is the opposite side of dopamine.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the dopamine system</p>
<p>and those kinds of schedules</p>
<p>that will allow craving or addiction.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the schedule of dopamine that&rsquo;s going to allow you</p>
<p>to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure</p>
<p>and your elimination of pain?</p>
<p>And we get the answer to that</p>
<p>from our good friend gambling.</p>
<p>The reason gambling works,</p>
<p>the reason why people will throw their lives away,</p>
<p>the reason why people go back again and again and again</p>
<p>to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City</p>
<p>is because of the hope and anticipation.</p>
<p>Those are cities and places built on dopamine.</p>
<p>They are leveraging your dopamine system.</p>
<p>And I realize that there are experienced gamblers,</p>
<p>there are people that enjoy gambling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually just say,</p>
<p>I like sitting at the roulette table.</p>
<p>I always take a designated amount of money, it&rsquo;s not much.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette.</p>
<p>I certainly enjoy when I win.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t like it when I lose,</p>
<p>but I do it sheerly for the pleasure of playing</p>
<p>and I do it very seldom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a gambling problem.</p>
<p>And if I did, I&rsquo;d probably tell you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a gambling problem</p>
<p>yet people throw away their entire lives on gambling.</p>
<p>And as a friend of mine,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a certified addiction treatment specialist tells me</p>
<p>that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister</p>
<p>because the next time really could be</p>
<p>the thing that changes everything.</p>
<p>Unlike other addictions,</p>
<p>the next time really could change everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s embedded in the mind of the gambling addict.</p>
<p>And rarely does it work out in favor of the wellbeing</p>
<p>of the gambling addict and their family.</p>
<p>However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule</p>
<p>was discovered long ago by scientific researchers.</p>
<p>So this is the slot machine that every once in a while</p>
<p>gives you a win to keep you playing.</p>
<p>This is the probability of winning on the craps table</p>
<p>or the roulette table or at blackjack,</p>
<p>just often enough that you&rsquo;re willing to buy tickets,</p>
<p>head out there, play again,</p>
<p>go downstairs again from your room,</p>
<p>even though you swore you were done for the night.</p>
<p>Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form</p>
<p>of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something.</p>
<p>So we can export that, we can use it for good.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re pursuing in life,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s an academic goal or a financial goal</p>
<p>or relationship goal,</p>
<p>one of the things that you can do to ensure</p>
<p>that you will remain on the path to that goal</p>
<p>for a very long time,</p>
<p>and that you will continue</p>
<p>to exceed your previous performance,</p>
<p>as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine release</p>
<p>that occurs when you hit the milestones</p>
<p>that you want to achieve,</p>
<p>is to occasionally remove rewards subjectively.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you set out a goal of making,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make this quantitative</p>
<p>with respect to finances</p>
<p>because it just is an easy description,</p>
<p>but this could also be in sport,</p>
<p>this could be in school, this could be in music,</p>
<p>could be in anything, creative endeavors.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you set out a certain financial goal</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you want to get a certain number of followers</p>
<p>on whatever social media platform.</p>
<p>As you reach each one of those goals,</p>
<p>you should know now that the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>is not going to peak,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually going to diminish and make you crave more.</p>
<p>The key to avoiding that crash,</p>
<p>but to still keep it in healthy levels</p>
<p>that will allow you to continue your pursuit,</p>
<p>is as you are staircasing toward your goal,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s dollars, maybe that&rsquo;s followers,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s grades, maybe that&rsquo;s some other metric,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s medals or trophies,</p>
<p>you actually want to blunt the reward response</p>
<p>for some of those intermediate goals.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not telling you shouldn&rsquo;t celebrate your wins,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m telling you not to celebrate all of them.</p>
<p>Or as a good friend of mine who recently,</p>
<p>fortunately for him, had a great financial success,</p>
<p>he asked me and somebody else, a good friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very tuned into dopamine reward schedules,</p>
<p>understands how they work at a really deep level.</p>
<p>And he said, I don&rsquo;t know what to do next.</p>
<p>And we said, oh, well, that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>You should just give most of it away.</p>
<p>And this wasn&rsquo;t a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves,</p>
<p>this was really about reducing the impact of that reward.</p>
<p>Now, hopefully giving a money away</p>
<p>if you already have enough of it</p>
<p>would be something that was rewarding in and of itself.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a student who&rsquo;s pursuing goals in university,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re an athlete who&rsquo;s pursuing goals,</p>
<p>it actually makes sense from a rational perspective,</p>
<p>once you understand these mechanisms,</p>
<p>to hit a new high point of performance,</p>
<p>or to get that A plus, or for you, if it&rsquo;s an A minus,</p>
<p>et cetera, and to tell yourself, okay, that was good,</p>
<p>but to actually actively blunt the reward,</p>
<p>to not go and celebrate too intensely.</p>
<p>Because in doing that,</p>
<p>you keep your dopamine system in check,</p>
<p>and you ensure that you&rsquo;re going to stay on the path</p>
<p>of continued pursuit, not just for that thing,</p>
<p>but for all things.</p>
<p>Big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine,</p>
<p>and big increases in dopamine up the ante.</p>
<p>They increase the extent to which</p>
<p>you are willing to invest time and energy</p>
<p>in order to achieve goals and rewards</p>
<p>that may be out of your reach.</p>
<p>You never really know if you&rsquo;re going to succeed.</p>
<p>So to make this crystal clear,</p>
<p>celebrate your wins, but don&rsquo;t celebrate every win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way that you can ensure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to continue down the path of progress.</p>
<p>And I think most of the learning tools that are in schools</p>
<p>are about reward, hopefully for genuine performance.</p>
<p>They are about encouraging us.</p>
<p>We do have to believe that we can perform well.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of growth mindset</p>
<p>is the internalization that we&rsquo;re not getting it right yet.</p>
<p>The word yet is very important.</p>
<p>And also the sense that we reward our good behavior,</p>
<p>our good performance, but not every time.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to actually take the reward</p>
<p>and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind.</p>
<p>And you tell somebody that they are in control</p>
<p>of whether or not you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to feel good about your wins.</p>
<p>Now, this is, I realize it&rsquo;s very unnatural for most people,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s simply going to be in pursuit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to really register your wins</p>
<p>and you think that that&rsquo;s going to actually</p>
<p>make you a better performer, it will in the short term,</p>
<p>but not in the long term.</p>
<p>So you can lift what Las Vegas and Atlantic City</p>
<p>and other gambling mechanisms</p>
<p>and places have known for a long time.</p>
<p>They lifted it from the scientists.</p>
<p>You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that.</p>
<p>And you just make it intermittent.</p>
<p>You reward yourself not on a predictable schedule.</p>
<p>So not every other time or every third time</p>
<p>or every 10th time, but sometimes it&rsquo;s three in a row</p>
<p>then not at all for 10 days.</p>
<p>So reward is important.</p>
<p>Self-reward is critically important,</p>
<p>but make sure that you&rsquo;re not doing it</p>
<p>on such a predictable schedule</p>
<p>that you burn out these dopamine circuits</p>
<p>or that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve.</p>
<p>I actually have a story from graduate school</p>
<p>which I was forced into an intermittent reinforcement</p>
<p>schedule that I do believe has served me very well</p>
<p>in my scientific career and other aspects of life.</p>
<p>My graduate advisor was an amazing scientist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she passed away, but amazing scientists</p>
<p>and amazing human being with a very dry</p>
<p>and somewhat cruel sense of humor.</p>
<p>Her name was Barbara Chapman.</p>
<p>And we published a paper in the journal Science</p>
<p>and Science, Nature and Cell are considered the big three,</p>
<p>the most competitive journals to publish in.</p>
<p>I had a first author paper in Science.</p>
<p>It was really exciting to me as a graduate student.</p>
<p>I was very excited about the discovery.</p>
<p>I was excited that it was in Science.</p>
<p>I was just thrilled.</p>
<p>And I remember when the paper finally got accepted</p>
<p>because it involved a ton of revisions</p>
<p>and a lot of very hard work.</p>
<p>And she came in and she said, you know, paper got accepted.</p>
<p>I was super excited.</p>
<p>And she just kind of sat there and nodded.</p>
<p>And I said, are we going to celebrate?</p>
<p>Are we going to have a party?</p>
<p>Or like, what are we going to do?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget her answer.</p>
<p>She said, hmm, I think we should skip this one.</p>
<p>And I thought she was joking.</p>
<p>And I said, what do you mean skip this one?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to publish the paper.</p>
<p>She said, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to publish the paper.</p>
<p>But she said, you know, maybe when you get like four more,</p>
<p>maybe three, maybe two.</p>
<p>And I thought she was messing with me.</p>
<p>And she wasn&rsquo;t messing with me.</p>
<p>And she was right.</p>
<p>We never had a party.</p>
<p>We never had a celebration for that paper.</p>
<p>I think she was really trying to instill two ideas in me.</p>
<p>One is that the work itself</p>
<p>was what was supposed to be most rewarding.</p>
<p>The practice of experimentation, of writing the paper,</p>
<p>the experience of achieving something</p>
<p>that we worked very hard at.</p>
<p>And that did indeed feel amazing.</p>
<p>I actually can still feel it in my body now, the excitement.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still a dopamine release</p>
<p>or that arc is going very long.</p>
<p>This would be almost 20 years ago now that this happened.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>The other one is that she&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We never went out and celebrated.</p>
<p>And we did celebrate other wins,</p>
<p>other papers in the future and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But she was either consciously or subconsciously</p>
<p>putting me on an intermittent reward schedule.</p>
<p>And to this day, when something really good happens,</p>
<p>I actually hesitate as to whether or not</p>
<p>I want to internalize that and celebrate,</p>
<p>whether or not I want to tell anybody,</p>
<p>which is its own form of celebration</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re getting positive feedback.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very cautious with how I deploy dopamine release</p>
<p>in response to wins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not the only way</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve navigated my career.</p>
<p>There are a number of other principles I incorporate,</p>
<p>but intermittent reward for wins, for achievements</p>
<p>is a very powerful way to ensure</p>
<p>that you will stay on the path of pursuit.</p>
<p>At this point in the podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to address some corrections.</p>
<p>I made some errors in previous episodes.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t major errors,</p>
<p>but a couple of you pointed them out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to me that we strive for accuracy.</p>
<p>So the first one was I talked in a previous episode</p>
<p>about the potential benefits for some people, not all,</p>
<p>of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol</p>
<p>and a way of offsetting medium-term</p>
<p>and some long-term stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a supplement that I&rsquo;ve benefited from.</p>
<p>It works through the GABA system and some other systems.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out a study</p>
<p>that admittedly was done in rats.</p>
<p>I was focusing mainly on studies in humans</p>
<p>during the episode,</p>
<p>but they point out a study that was done in rats</p>
<p>that showed that long-term administration of ashwagandha</p>
<p>could actually create some negative effects,</p>
<p>mainly on the thyroid</p>
<p>and perhaps even the cortisol system,</p>
<p>maybe the melatonin system.</p>
<p>I just want to acknowledge that study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reference it in the caption.</p>
<p>Again, that was a rat study.</p>
<p>I was focused on human studies.</p>
<p>Please go to examine.com.</p>
<p>Put in ashwagandha.</p>
<p>It will tell you the various effects</p>
<p>on different aspects of brain and body.</p>
<p>It will also link to the PubMed articles</p>
<p>that are relevant there.</p>
<p>It is called the human effect matrix</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s only focused on humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I like examine.com</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s focused on human studies.</p>
<p>Again, a wonderful free resource.</p>
<p>But I do appreciate that you pointed out that study</p>
<p>because I do want people to be aware</p>
<p>of the range of effects</p>
<p>that these various compounds can have.</p>
<p>As well, a couple of times in previous episodes,</p>
<p>I said 5-HTP and not 5-HT.</p>
<p>5-HT is serotonin.</p>
<p>5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.</p>
<p>I was talking about supplements and compounds</p>
<p>that can stimulate the release of serotonin.</p>
<p>In the previous episode,</p>
<p>I was actually referring to it in a context</p>
<p>for which I don&rsquo;t personally like to take 5-HTP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my own bias</p>
<p>for reasons I described in that episode.</p>
<p>But if you heard me say 5-HTP</p>
<p>when I meant to say 5-HT, I apologize.</p>
<p>And then last, I just want to point out again,</p>
<p>something that I mentioned in the beginning,</p>
<p>which is that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now subtitled in Spanish.</p>
<p>Episodes one and two,</p>
<p>as well as our welcome video are in Spanish.</p>
<p>The other ones will be subtitled soon.</p>
<p>You can expect that within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>So if you know Spanish-speaking people</p>
<p>who prefer to digest the information in Spanish,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s you, you can look forward</p>
<p>to the Spanish subtitles.</p>
<p>You need to activate those</p>
<p>in the caption feature on YouTube.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have Spanish dubbing</p>
<p>over in the audio platforms.</p>
<p>I realize once again, we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>Hopefully you now know far more</p>
<p>about the dopamine system, reward, and motivation</p>
<p>than you did at the beginning of this podcast.</p>
<p>Hopefully you also understand the other side</p>
<p>of dopamine and reward, which is pain</p>
<p>and the balance of this pleasure-pain system,</p>
<p>as well as the molecules that we call,</p>
<p>or that were described in the Molecule of More book,</p>
<p>I should say, as the here and now molecules,</p>
<p>things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.</p>
<p>We talked about a variety of supplement-based tools,</p>
<p>things like vitamin B6 and zinc,</p>
<p>as they relate to prolactin, PEA, very interesting compound.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve never tried it, very interesting,</p>
<p>definitely in use out there.</p>
<p>L-DOPA, mucunipurines, talked about caffeine,</p>
<p>talked about nicotine,</p>
<p>talked about how some of the effects of Adderall</p>
<p>can be created purely cognitively</p>
<p>without actually ingesting Adderall,</p>
<p>simply by telling people they&rsquo;re ingesting Adderall,</p>
<p>giving them caffeine, very interesting study</p>
<p>that I referenced a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>And we talked about scheduling dopamine,</p>
<p>adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself</p>
<p>in order to ensure long-term engagement with pursuits</p>
<p>that I hope are healthy pursuits</p>
<p>and ones that serve you well.</p>
<p>This was by no means an exhaustive coverage</p>
<p>of all things dopamine and motivation.</p>
<p>It was by no means the only time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about dopamine and motivation.</p>
<p>Next episode, we&rsquo;re going to continue to talk about emotions</p>
<p>from yet another perspective.</p>
<p>But hopefully you have enough now to think about</p>
<p>in the meantime, and that you can consider adopting</p>
<p>in your own life and practices.</p>
<p>As always, I really want to thank you</p>
<p>for your time and attention.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve learned something useful today,</p>
<p>please pass it along.</p>
<p>One of the things that we teach in science</p>
<p>that I think is really wonderful to adopt in general in life</p>
<p>is this idea of watch one, do one, teach one.</p>
<p>This is what we tell graduate students</p>
<p>and med students and postdocs.</p>
<p>Watch somebody do something, learn it,</p>
<p>then do it, apply it, see if it works for you,</p>
<p>and then teach it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually not watch one, do one, teach one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually watch one, do 20,</p>
<p>teach as many people as you possibly want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for attribution.</p>
<p>These are tools that are grounded in neuroscience</p>
<p>for which I can&rsquo;t claim attribution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just passing them along</p>
<p>so that you can adopt them if you like</p>
<p>and pass them along</p>
<p>if you think people can benefit from them.</p>
