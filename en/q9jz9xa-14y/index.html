discuss the difference between hiit high intensity interval training versus cardio for your heart which one is better and the answer is high intensity interval training now you think high intensity exercise would be more harmful to the heart than a lower type longer sustained exercise but it&amp;rsquo;s not and that has to do with what&amp;rsquo;s happening in a heartbeat okay in a heartbeat you have this contraction and relaxation okay this wave form contraction relaxation and so the heart operates on a rhythm okay and so high intensity interval training mimics more of a rhythmic type exercise than some type of moderate sustained type exercise where you&amp;rsquo;re jogging for a period of time or doing any type of marathons that&amp;rsquo;s actually much harder on the heart and so short duration high intensity exercise with a good amount of rest is very very therapeutic to the heart there&amp;rsquo;s a study that i&amp;rsquo;m going to put a link down below that showed that hiit exercise showed significant increase in cardiovascular and respiratory health so you can do the spin bike okay you can do the slam ball right now i&amp;rsquo;m doing the slam ball there&amp;rsquo;s this really heavy rubber ball it&amp;rsquo;s like 30 pounds and you lift it from the ground up and you slam it down man that gives you an intense workout and i could probably only do that maybe 12 to 15 times and i i just you hit a max where you just can&amp;rsquo;t go anymore so you get this huge spike in pulse rate so then you stop what you&amp;rsquo;re doing let the pulse rate come down to a good level and then do it again okay but you only need to do it like between i don&amp;rsquo;t know three to seven cycles and that&amp;rsquo;s it of course the key is the rest and i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about that a little bit then you have something called plyometrics which you&amp;rsquo;re hopping on like a platform back and forth that will give you a really good high intensity interval training workout there&amp;rsquo;s many other things you can do you don&amp;rsquo;t even need equipment sprinting is another really good one but of course you need good joints for that and if you&amp;rsquo;re like 80 years old and you have arthritis not a good option but if you&amp;rsquo;re younger and you can do sprint training it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the best exercise because it&amp;rsquo;s so intense and you&amp;rsquo;re working every single muscle in your body in a very short duration i mean just take a look at these sprinters that sprint for 100 yards right in like i mean 10 11 12 seconds i mean that&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s a short workout but that&amp;rsquo;s intense you do several of those with a good amount of rest in between you&amp;rsquo;re going to create some serious improvements in your health the other thing they noted in the study is that it was safe for people with high blood pressure and even with people who had heart problems of course check with your doctor before doing this but it&amp;rsquo;s safer than you think especially if you&amp;rsquo;re giving your heart a good amount of rest the other thing that high intensity interval training will do is it&amp;rsquo;ll increase something called vo2 max and this is the amount of oxygen that feeds the muscles okay so it&amp;rsquo;ll actually help you with that and it will increase growth hormone as well as testosterone two very important hormones especially as we age so we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with like three variables we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with the intensity of exercise we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with their duration and we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with the recovery with hit training we want a high intensity okay we want short duration okay because the longer duration the more you&amp;rsquo;re going to increase cortisol which is not good it&amp;rsquo;s going to have more stress and then we want a good amount of recovery so we create this short-term stress we create less cortisol improve recovery we improve the parasympathetic nervous system now what happens when we spike our pulse rate high we have a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system that is raising our pulse rate up to a certain peak right and as soon as we stop exercising the pulse rate should come down now what&amp;rsquo;s responsible for the pulse rate coming down is the parasympathetic nervous system the parasympathetic nervous system is all about recovery and it&amp;rsquo;s an active wave like mechanism that&amp;rsquo;s literally pushing down your pulse rate actively and in practice i had a machine that measured that it used something called heart rate variability technology and it measured part of the autonomic nervous system and after a minute exercise you can actually see how long it takes for someone to recover and if they had a weak parasympathetic nervous system it would take a very long period of time to recover if they had a strong parasympathetic nervous system they can recover really quick so based on your recovery you can kind of tell what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside to that part of the nervous system and so by doing this exercise you can actually strengthen your parasympathetic nervous system by allowing it to recover fully so what i would recommend is do like a 20 second or even a less intense workout and then rest for about two to four minutes to allow that pulse rate to come all the way down and then do it again and again and again like three to seven sets and that&amp;rsquo;s all you need to do i highly recommend this workout add it to what you&amp;rsquo;re already doing and i think you&amp;rsquo;re gonna really see some amazing changes not just with your heart for your whole body hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below"><title>HIIT vs. Cardio： Which Is Better for Your Heart？ ｜

intensity interval training versus cardio  </p><p>for your heart which one is better and the 
answer is high intensity interval training  </p><p>now you think high intensity exercise would 
be more harmful to the heart than a lower type  </p><p>longer sustained exercise but it&rsquo;s not and that 
has to do with what&rsquo;s happening in a heartbeat  </p><p>okay in a heartbeat you have this contraction 
and relaxation okay this wave form contraction  </p><p>relaxation and so the heart operates on a rhythm 
okay and so high intensity interval training  </p><p>mimics more of a rhythmic type exercise than 
some type of moderate sustained type exercise  </p><p>where you&rsquo;re jogging for a period of 
time or doing any type of marathons  </p><p>that&rsquo;s actually much harder on the heart and 
so short duration high intensity exercise  </p><p>with a good amount of rest is very very 
therapeutic to the heart there&rsquo;s a study that  </p><p>i&rsquo;m going to put a link down below that showed 
that hiit exercise showed significant increase in  </p><p>cardiovascular and respiratory health so you can 
do the spin bike okay you can do the slam ball  </p><p>right now i&rsquo;m doing the slam ball there&rsquo;s this 
really heavy rubber ball it&rsquo;s like 30 pounds and  </p><p>you lift it from the ground up and you slam it 
down man that gives you an intense workout and  </p><p>i could probably only do that maybe 12 to 15 times 
and i i just you hit a max where you just can&rsquo;t go  </p><p>anymore so you get this huge spike in pulse rate 
so then you stop what you&rsquo;re doing let the pulse  </p><p>rate come down to a good level and then do it 
again okay but you only need to do it like between  </p><p>i don&rsquo;t know three to seven cycles and that&rsquo;s 
it of course the key is the rest and i&rsquo;m going  </p><p>to talk about that a little bit then you have 
something called plyometrics which you&rsquo;re hopping  </p><p>on like a platform back and forth that will 
give you a really good high intensity interval  </p><p>training workout there&rsquo;s many other things you 
can do you don&rsquo;t even need equipment sprinting  </p><p>is another really good one but of course you need 
good joints for that and if you&rsquo;re like 80 years  </p><p>old and you have arthritis not a good option but 
if you&rsquo;re younger and you can do sprint training  </p><p>it&rsquo;s probably one of the best exercise because 
it&rsquo;s so intense and you&rsquo;re working every single  </p><p>muscle in your body in a very short duration i 
mean just take a look at these sprinters that  </p><p>sprint for 100 yards right in like i mean 10 11 
12 seconds i mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a short workout  </p><p>but that&rsquo;s intense you do several of those with 
a good amount of rest in between you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to create some serious improvements in your health 
the other thing they noted in the study is that it  </p><p>was safe for people with high blood pressure and 
even with people who had heart problems of course  </p><p>check with your doctor before doing this but it&rsquo;s 
safer than you think especially if you&rsquo;re giving  </p><p>your heart a good amount of rest the other thing 
that high intensity interval training will do  </p><p>is it&rsquo;ll increase something called vo2 
max and this is the amount of oxygen that  </p><p>feeds the muscles okay so it&rsquo;ll actually help 
you with that and it will increase growth hormone  </p><p>as well as testosterone two very important 
hormones especially as we age so we&rsquo;re dealing  </p><p>with like three variables we&rsquo;re dealing with 
the intensity of exercise we&rsquo;re dealing with  </p><p>their duration and we&rsquo;re dealing with the recovery 
with hit training we want a high intensity okay  </p><p>we want short duration okay because the longer 
duration the more you&rsquo;re going to increase  </p><p>cortisol which is not good it&rsquo;s going to have more 
stress and then we want a good amount of recovery  </p><p>so we create this short-term stress we create 
less cortisol improve recovery we improve the  </p><p>parasympathetic nervous system now what happens 
when we spike our pulse rate high we have a part  </p><p>of the nervous system called the sympathetic 
nervous system that is raising our pulse rate  </p><p>up to a certain peak right and as soon as we 
stop exercising the pulse rate should come  </p><p>down now what&rsquo;s responsible for the pulse rate 
coming down is the parasympathetic nervous system  </p><p>the parasympathetic nervous system is all about 
recovery and it&rsquo;s an active wave like mechanism  </p><p>that&rsquo;s literally pushing down your pulse rate 
actively and in practice i had a machine that  </p><p>measured that it used something called heart rate 
variability technology and it measured part of  </p><p>the autonomic nervous system and after a minute 
exercise you can actually see how long it takes  </p><p>for someone to recover and if they had a weak 
parasympathetic nervous system it would take a  </p><p>very long period of time to recover if they 
had a strong parasympathetic nervous system  </p><p>they can recover really quick so based on your 
recovery you can kind of tell what&rsquo;s happening  </p><p>inside to that part of the nervous system and so 
by doing this exercise you can actually strengthen  </p><p>your parasympathetic nervous system by allowing it 
to recover fully so what i would recommend is do  </p><p>like a 20 second or even a less intense workout 
and then rest for about two to four minutes  </p><p>to allow that pulse rate to come all 
the way down and then do it again  </p><p>and again and again like three to seven sets and 
that&rsquo;s all you need to do i highly recommend this  </p><p>workout add it to what you&rsquo;re already doing and i 
think you&rsquo;re gonna really see some amazing changes  </p><p>not just with your heart for your whole body hey 
before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting from any of my  </p><p>content i would love to hear about your success
