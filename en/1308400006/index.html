    <p>Hello friends today, we&rsquo;re talking about dating apps and all the issues that I think are wrong with them</p>
<p>Which is a whole bunch</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna list them all and get all in depth with every single one because I genuinely believe that</p>
<p>Dating apps are fucking us up worse than anyone realizes</p>
<p>Also, no offense to anyone that is on dating apps or likes dating apps. I&rsquo;ve been on them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I have all this information that I&rsquo;m about to spit at you</p>
<p>But I just hope this episode makes you think of some things and take some shit into consideration</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve got some new perspectives for you and I say new because I know you haven&rsquo;t thought of all of this</p>
<p>I know it cuz nobody overthinks like me</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is like I joke about that, but y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t realize I don&rsquo;t watch TV. I don&rsquo;t watch Netflix</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. What shows are good what people are talking about every time I like have you seen this movie?</p>
<p>No, I have no clue what you&rsquo;re talking about. I haven&rsquo;t even seen the fucking Lion King</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been busy since I&rsquo;m little like I don&rsquo;t even know most movies people talk about</p>
<p>But my point is any free time I have I spend it over analyzing some shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do what normal people do and like distract myself with stupid mindless bullshit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too anxious to do that. Like if I&rsquo;m not constantly working towards something or learning something</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m not doing enough but that&rsquo;s a whole other topic</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna get into and like sometimes it just be no point, but I spend all my time</p>
<p>reflecting and overthinking and</p>
<p>On tick-tock because I love a tick-tock shit is so funny</p>
<p>But anyway, let me walk you through</p>
<p>Every issue as I see it getting on a dating app. Okay. So the first problem you run into is when you&rsquo;re making the profile</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to represent yourself through pictures and for someone that is as complex as me</p>
<p>That is very very hard. I&rsquo;ve got like 12 personalities. Okay, and that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>Lenient with that&rsquo;s like a low number. That&rsquo;s a low guess. I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>Portray that online in a couple of pictures. They all dress different</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually have like split personality disorder, but I&rsquo;d be five different fucking people</p>
<p>Okay, like you&rsquo;ll see a picture of me in one setting and be like, okay</p>
<p>I get it have one opinion of me and like what I could be and then you&rsquo;ll see me in another picture and be like</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two different fucking people. Like I look the same but my vibe and the outfit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wearing is two different people because there&rsquo;s like 12 living up in my brain</p>
<p>Okay, whichever one wanted to express itself that day did like if you see me day-to-day normal</p>
<p>I look like one way if you see me at the gym</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m another way if you see me at the club, I&rsquo;m a fuckboy. I&rsquo;d be showing up gold chain snapback. Hello</p>
<p>How you doing, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole nother element to picking pictures of yourself to put on a dating app because pictures only show so much</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things you don&rsquo;t see about people and things</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t represent like the way that you move the way that you walk that can make or break somebody</p>
<p>I walk nice. I feel I have like cool mannerisms</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t portray that through some fucking pictures on a dating app</p>
<p>But like if you see this profile and this motherfucker is like super cute</p>
<p>But he walks like a duck like that&rsquo;s the deal-breaker for me</p>
<p>It might not be for you</p>
<p>but for me that is but that also works against you because if you have good mannerisms and you have a nice walk and</p>
<p>The way that you move your body people can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s that adds hot points that adds a lot of fucking hot points</p>
<p>You got height. You got the build of your body like the way your body is</p>
<p>Bill are you like top heavy? Are you bottom heavy?</p>
<p>What you got going on because you can pose in a picture and cover all that up. Like if you are built really good</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t come across in pictures. So that&rsquo;s another that&rsquo;s pretty points</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re losing because you&rsquo;re trying to represent yourself through some goddamn pictures. You can&rsquo;t represent your personality</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing you can&rsquo;t put in the picture</p>
<p>People be trying too hard to wear certain clothes to express their personality and they just look like a fucking weirdo</p>
<p>Like they have the cool like what they think is cool socks</p>
<p>Like with the cartoons and shit on them or they&rsquo;ll wear some kind of like weird fucking bowtie or like a tie</p>
<p>With their like dress clothes or they&rsquo;ll just they try too hard to like express their self</p>
<p>And they look like a fucking dweeb like you try and put my personality on a fucking dating app</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t you cannot represent my personality on a dating app and that loses hot points for me because I&rsquo;m half</p>
<p>Personality like if you the people that like my personality love it the people that don&rsquo;t hate me. So my personality is</p>
<p>Hot points. Okay, like those are hot points that I&rsquo;m losing out on and that pisses me off like you I&rsquo;m not the cutest in</p>
<p>Pictures, but when you see the way I carry myself when you see my personality you be like, oh fuck</p>
<p>Like but if you just judge me off the way that you see me in pictures, it&rsquo;s like eh, you know</p>
<p>Another thing you miss out on and you can&rsquo;t put in pictures is the way that you interact with people</p>
<p>The way that you talk to people. Are you fucking insecure? Are you socially aware? Do you hold the door for people?</p>
<p>Are you aware of who&rsquo;s around you? You can&rsquo;t represent that in</p>
<p>Pictures, but you can&rsquo;t some people are really insecure and weird and look like a fucking deer in headlights</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s other human beings around them like that&rsquo;s unattractive. Are you confident?</p>
<p>Are you like sure of yourself? Not a cocky asshole. Are you afraid to speak up? I don&rsquo;t like that shit</p>
<p>I need someone that will speak up another thing that works both ways that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Portray on your profile through your pictures is the way you smell now the stinky motherfuckers gonna slide on this</p>
<p>They get a free pass that like they get to hide that but the motherfuckers that smell good me</p>
<p>I lose hot points because the way that I smell dude, like</p>
<p>One of my biggest fears is to stink so I am like a one on my hygiene</p>
<p>I always have on deodorant like an excessive amount</p>
<p>I always have on a shit ton of cologne even when I go to the gym</p>
<p>I have a separate cologne for the gym. I have a gym cologne. I have a running errands cologne</p>
<p>I have a going out cologne. I got different smells for different things</p>
<p>I want to do but my point is I fucking smell good because I&rsquo;m terrified to stink. But anyway, that&rsquo;s hot points</p>
<p>I lose I miss those I don&rsquo;t get those</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re literally only getting half of me not even you&rsquo;re getting like a third of me</p>
<p>Through my profile if I try to get on a fucking dating app, so you&rsquo;re gonna miss out but we&rsquo;re gonna get to the part</p>
<p>Where for someone like me it will make you insecure</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting there, but my point with the whole trying to choose pictures of yourself. You can&rsquo;t grasp</p>
<p>Who you fully are as a person through pictures, even if you don&rsquo;t even talk like you can&rsquo;t grasp</p>
<p>Someone and their energy that&rsquo;s another thing you cannot show online is someone&rsquo;s energy if you meet me in real life</p>
<p>The people that have met me all of my friends everyone in my life</p>
<p>Says I have a safe</p>
<p>Protective and calming energy like people just feel safe with me. They feel good about their self. They feel okay</p>
<p>They feel protected. You can&rsquo;t portray that online. You have to meet me in person. You have to experience it</p>
<p>You have to like feel it. I know some people don&rsquo;t believe in the energy shit, but you&rsquo;re a fucking idiot. Wake up</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real thing. The way someone makes you feel is</p>
<p>Huge because some people can make you feel gross. Some people can make you feel uneasy</p>
<p>Some people can make you feel like like your skin is crawling</p>
<p>You want to get the fuck up and get away from them?</p>
<p>Like people just have that aura that energy whatever you want to call it about them</p>
<p>So the people that have really good energy, they can&rsquo;t show that online</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s more that&rsquo;s not even hot points that is like marriage points that&rsquo;s like motherfucker</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t never want to lose you points is if you make someone feel good. We miss those two</p>
<p>So with this people can create any kind of facade they want they can make their self look any way that they want to</p>
<p>Online they can make their self look taller look cooler look smarter. They can fucking fake a personality and</p>
<p>Make it seem like they are the funniest person in the world on a dating app when you give someone control over the way that</p>
<p>They portray their self</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only gonna put their best foot forward like they&rsquo;re not gonna put any of the real shit about them out there</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re gonna try and</p>
<p>construct the best version of their self or construct the best image of their self they can create and</p>
<p>That sets you up to get fucked not physically</p>
<p>I mean you probably will want to fuck them when you see them online</p>
<p>But like when you meet them in real life, you&rsquo;re like, ooh, no fucking sidearm stiff arm</p>
<p>Get the fuck from me taser. So that means they can hide things. They can hide anything. They don&rsquo;t want you to see</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s motherfuckers that have kids. There are people no offense to handicapped people, but I saw a motherfucker with one leg</p>
<p>Have a tender and I seen him in real life. So I knew he had one leg</p>
<p>I knew he was like, I knew what he had going on on tinder. He looked fully</p>
<p>legged I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how to word this but he made it seem on his tinder that he had two legs</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not something people consider like you just see him in normal clothes doing normal shit</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t think oh does homeboy not have a fucking leg like you can hide it really well</p>
<p>And nothing against him or people that do this, but that&rsquo;s something that I feel it should be disclosed</p>
<p>This means they can hide whatever they want to hide. They&rsquo;re not gonna put anything that makes them look bad on their profile</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see all that shit in person. You are only looking at online</p>
<p>the best</p>
<p>Constructed version of their self they could create and this makes you think people are greater than they are</p>
<p>And it really sets you up to fail like when you meet them in person. You&rsquo;re like, what the fuck is this?</p>
<p>I do have a little example</p>
<p>I was not gonna pull any examples from my own life</p>
<p>But I feel like I need to there was this boy. I</p>
<p>Met on tinder</p>
<p>Like a year ish ago. I don&rsquo;t know when the fuck it was. It was a long time ago</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t quote me on the day. I don&rsquo;t fucking know and he was a fucking 10 out of 10</p>
<p>His pictures dude were so fucking hot</p>
<p>like Instagram model</p>
<p>I was</p>
<p>Instantly trying to find his Instagram cuz I&rsquo;m like this dude is like Instagram famous the way that he fucking looks like get real</p>
<p>And I look I finally found his Instagram. He only had like 2,000 followers. I was like what?</p>
<p>but his pictures dude, like</p>
<p>He was a 10 out of 10. The body was on 12 not even on 10. The body was on 12</p>
<p>The face was on fucking 13</p>
<p>everything was just like</p>
<p>Perfect his attitude he had in his fucking pictures like he was tough stuff and he didn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>He was not insecure at all. He was so cocky</p>
<p>He would fucking spit at you if you were uglier than him, like that&rsquo;s the way his pictures looked online</p>
<p>Let me tell you how fucking disappointed I was when I met up with this boy</p>
<p>So we talked we bullshitted then we agreed to hang out when I got to his house</p>
<p>He opened his front door and I thought uh-oh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s all I could think was uh-oh cuz I knew it was him</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough of a difference for me to be like is this your fucking roommate?</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t get catfished, but I was like, oh, so this is you in real life</p>
<p>Like this is really you and I was thinking that in my head. I didn&rsquo;t say nothing like I was like, okay</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s fun cuz he seemed really fucking fun</p>
<p>His personality seemed cool like the way we had chatted like on the like messages like he seemed cool</p>
<p>So I was like, let me just fucking hang out with him. See how it goes</p>
<p>So I walk in we start hanging out this motherfucker</p>
<p>Was like talking to a loaf of bread. No a loaf of bread will absorb information</p>
<p>This motherfucker was like talking to a brick. He was so</p>
<p>Stupid stupid is like being generous</p>
<p>No personality flat as a board</p>
<p>Was extremely insecure</p>
<p>Like when he was making us a drink this motherfucker was shaking like a salt shaker like he was so</p>
<p>Nervous he fucking spilled some shit like I get being nervous</p>
<p>But like the image you had portrayed of what you were and the way you were talking before I came over</p>
<p>This is not</p>
<p>Who you are?</p>
<p>You know that shit pisses me off. He was very insecure</p>
<p>He had no personality at all. His body did not look like how it looked</p>
<p>it was one of those phases for him like when you&rsquo;re in a cut like when you&rsquo;re working out really hard and you cut down and</p>
<p>You take like really hot beach pictures</p>
<p>And then you put a little bit of weight on because it&rsquo;s like not healthy to maintain such a low body fat percentage</p>
<p>Like he had like porked up a little</p>
<p>Not bad, like he still looked good, but he did not look like his pictures</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a turnoff for me. Like I would rather you downplay yourself and then be</p>
<p>Better than I even imagined in real life. That&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>With everything even when I&rsquo;m about the fuck. I&rsquo;m like now my dick is small</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like just to prepare you my dick is little and then when people go down there like oh my god</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s funny, you know, like I like to play it down. I like people to be pleasantly surprised not fucking disappointed and</p>
<p>Let me tell you</p>
<p>about this guy&rsquo;s breath</p>
<p>Bad breath is something you will never catch me with in my entire life</p>
<p>I have like three packs of gum on me at all times. I don&rsquo;t fucking know bad breath</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very conscious about it. And that&rsquo;s one of the things I cannot stand is someone with bad breath</p>
<p>This fucking dudes breath was so bad. I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>I walked out of there with eyebrows and eyelashes still on my face. I&rsquo;m surprised it didn&rsquo;t burn them off with that hot ass breath</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something else people can hide and like I said, we were drinking</p>
<p>He made us drinks alcohol was in his mouth and it didn&rsquo;t kill whatever he had going on in there</p>
<p>He got close to my face one fucking time and that was it</p>
<p>Wrapped that shit up and got out of there like it was so stupid. It was so fucking stupid because when I was</p>
<p>Talking to him and like messaging him</p>
<p>I was so excited to like go meet up with him and like I was putting effort into what I was saying</p>
<p>Like I was so</p>
<p>Trying to like put my best foot forward like this motherfucker had me nervous. This motherfucker had me like</p>
<p>Watching what I say like and then to get in real life and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re a fucking goober like for real</p>
<p>That shit was so upsetting and like that experience made me</p>
<p>start digging into tinder and like all these fucking issues because people are never as cool as they seem online and</p>
<p>Social media</p>
<p>Gives people that are nobody&rsquo;s the opportunities to look like somebody&rsquo;s because they get to construct an image of whatever they want to look</p>
<p>Like so something about tinder and about the human brain that is working against you is</p>
<p>When I was on tinder looking at this boy when I was looking at his pictures your brain sees what you want to see</p>
<p>Your brain like sees shit better than it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the whole mask phenomenon when everyone&rsquo;s wearing a mask and all you see is like their eyes and up</p>
<p>your brain will</p>
<p>Construct a cuter image if the rest of someone&rsquo;s face is a mystery like your brain will make them hotter in your own head</p>
<p>Then they actually are that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so disappointed when someone pulls their mask down and they&rsquo;re ugly because you thought they were gonna be</p>
<p>Cuter like you just always assume people are gonna be cuter if you can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>Everything you know</p>
<p>But also your brain when you see a picture of someone online it already starts projecting everything you wish and hope for in</p>
<p>That picture like the person that you could see anything that you could potentially want your brains gonna start thinking of it and it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>Be subconscious. Okay, because how many times have you seen a couple of pictures of somebody and like there are four pictures?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like fuck. Yeah, you&rsquo;re like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re the vibe that you want</p>
<p>And then that fifth picture</p>
<p>Ruins it like they got a fucking pink t-shirt on or they got some stupid shit on and it were like ruins the vibe</p>
<p>That you had just created in your head like they didn&rsquo;t match up to it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what your brain does to you like it will hope it will show you what you&rsquo;re hoping for and</p>
<p>You will see in pictures what you&rsquo;re hoping for and you won&rsquo;t see the bad shit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these hot people that have messy rooms in the background half the people don&rsquo;t even notice that the room is messy</p>
<p>I do cuz I&rsquo;d be looking for shit like that</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t see the messy room because they&rsquo;re looking at the hot person your brain makes you blind to what you don&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>Now your brain is a fucking asshole because it does the opposite when it comes to you</p>
<p>When you look at pictures of yourself, you are nitpicking and seeing every fucking thing wrong with it</p>
<p>You see everything that you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Okay, when you see somebody else, it&rsquo;s like they you your brain gases them up</p>
<p>I think fair like I&rsquo;m realizing this is not fair what your brain does</p>
<p>But like your brain gases up to other people but like when it sees the picture of you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ripping you apart. Your brain is only gonna see where you&rsquo;re inadequate and how they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>So this is immediately gonna make you insecure. You don&rsquo;t know this is going on when you&rsquo;re getting on tinder</p>
<p>But this is what&rsquo;s going on. So you&rsquo;re already set up for fucking failure with this</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not the only one that does this</p>
<p>But you know how when you&rsquo;re swiping through a dating app and it&rsquo;s like average people or like ugly people and you&rsquo;re like, nope</p>
<p>Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope, and then you find the hot one like one little fucking unicorn comes through and you</p>
<p>halt every</p>
<p>motherfucking thing you&rsquo;re doing and</p>
<p>So you swipe right or you like them whatever direction that goes for you like you like this person you like give them a little</p>
<p>Heart or their thumb up whatever the fuck. I don&rsquo;t know how dating apps work</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only ever used tinder and grinder, but you like the person</p>
<p>Okay, you do the interest button you&rsquo;re interested and then immediately</p>
<p>You run to your profile to look at it again. You&rsquo;re like, oh my god. What the fuck pictures? Do I have up?</p>
<p>Do I look hot enough? Do I need to add new pictures? Do I need to change something?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my bio stupid you see someone hot and you</p>
<p>Immediately get insecure and start trying to make sure your shit is perfect before they see you</p>
<p>Because I do it all the time or did when I was on these fucking apps</p>
<p>So this is where things get really complicated when it comes to dating apps is</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being judged off of the way that you look in pictures</p>
<p>You are being subconsciously sent the message</p>
<p>your only way of attracting someone is</p>
<p>Through the way you look if you are not hot</p>
<p>You will not catch anyone&rsquo;s attention. No one&rsquo;s gonna give you the time of day</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get swiped on no one your interest is gonna like you if you&rsquo;re not hot</p>
<p>This is gonna start making you think that where your value lies is in your appearance in the way that you look</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna stop seeing all the other things</p>
<p>about you that make you valuable because the only thing that is being reflected to you by these dating apps is</p>
<p>Your only value is in the way you fucking look</p>
<p>Your brain is gonna start adopting that your brain is picking up on that</p>
<p>Like I said in the beginning of this all the great things that you miss out on and all the really</p>
<p>important things that you can&rsquo;t portray in pictures</p>
<p>All of those things you&rsquo;re gonna stop seeing as good things about yourself. You&rsquo;re not gonna recognize those anymore</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna look at oh, hey the way that I walk is actually kind of fucking cool</p>
<p>No one cares because the way that you&rsquo;re gaining attention and the way that you&rsquo;re getting approval is through a dating app</p>
<p>Where none of that plays a role all it is about is the way that you look in pictures</p>
<p>This is very dangerous territory when it comes to having any kind of self-esteem</p>
<p>I would really like for someone to try and fight me on that one because there&rsquo;s no getting around that</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t portray yourself fully online. All you can show is the way that you fucking look</p>
<p>You might be able to throw a funny little one-liner in your bio. You can&rsquo;t represent your personality on there</p>
<p>So what are people looking at you for not your personality?</p>
<p>So this is what&rsquo;s going on subconsciously that you&rsquo;re not realizing then you get</p>
<p>The motherfuckers that are only on there for sex like if you&rsquo;re actually on there for like dates and like a relationship good for you, babe</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s other people that are only on there for sex and they&rsquo;re gonna objectify you even worse</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna reinforce these beliefs and these thoughts that you&rsquo;re already having</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make you even more blind to other things you have to offer</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be seen as you&rsquo;re pretty you&rsquo;re worth talking to because you&rsquo;re pretty I&rsquo;ll swipe you because you&rsquo;re cute</p>
<p>Then people are gonna send you the message of I&rsquo;m only gonna swipe you because I want to fuck you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at you</p>
<p>For sex they&rsquo;re looking at you for your body what they can get from you. They&rsquo;re not interested in getting to know you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna validate</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>Good about you any good traits you have they&rsquo;re not seeing them. They don&rsquo;t care. They don&rsquo;t give a fuck about your personality</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>The way you interact with people your mannerisms the way you walk</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care what kind of heart you have</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care if you have</p>
<p>Empathy and compassion or if you are a deep person or if you know a lot of things if you&rsquo;re knowledgeable if you&rsquo;re smart</p>
<p>none of that</p>
<p>Matters to these people that are trying to get your attention</p>
<p>Dating apps put you in a whole different world, and it&rsquo;s not real life. I know the whole social media</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like talk shit on that, but dating apps are a whole different beast like that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>Alternate reality and it really can fuck you up mentally it will ruin your self-esteem</p>
<p>It will make you blind to anything good about yourself</p>
<p>That is not the way you look or what you can offer sexually and that will lead you into feeling worthless</p>
<p>Into not feeling good enough into feeling like you have nothing to offer people feeling like you have no value</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna respect yourself if you don&rsquo;t feel like you have anything to value you&rsquo;re gonna get into situations and relationships</p>
<p>That are so much below what you&rsquo;re worth because you don&rsquo;t see your value</p>
<p>Dating apps are meant to keep you cripplingly insecure so you stay on them</p>
<p>So, you know when you&rsquo;re on a dating app and you&rsquo;ve like gone through all the people in your area and you&rsquo;re like, oh</p>
<p>well fuck I guess I gotta</p>
<p>Like expand my radius so I can go to like a 50 mile radius or 100 mile radius instead of fucking 10</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m out of people I&rsquo;m out of people that I could possibly like they&rsquo;re all ugly or they didn&rsquo;t swipe me back or whatever</p>
<p>The fucking issue is you start to think that this is all that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;ve gone through all the people in the hundred mile radius and you&rsquo;re out of fucking people to swipe on</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be like damn. Are my standards too high?</p>
<p>Do I maybe I should just go back and just see like maybe I should just like I can swipe on a few people</p>
<p>Maybe I missed a couple people. Maybe I was too harsh</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make you start thinking that there&rsquo;s less out there than there actually is which makes you insecure</p>
<p>About having high standards, you&rsquo;re gonna go back and you&rsquo;re gonna start lowering your standards</p>
<p>You can be like, oh, maybe I could give them a chance. Maybe this could work. Maybe that work. I guess they&rsquo;re cute</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you fuck yourself because these are the type people that should not have access to you. Your standards keep you safe</p>
<p>As soon as you lower them you open yourself up for low quality experiences</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a cycle of that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant cycle of keep swiping through to lower your standards</p>
<p>And then maybe they&rsquo;ll get low enough where you&rsquo;ll start matching with people and you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>Liking some people and you&rsquo;ll get some reassurance off the app that you&rsquo;re fucking cute again</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;d forget to realize is not everyone that is single is on a dating app</p>
<p>There are so many more people in this radius that you have picked out</p>
<p>That are open and actually looking for a relationship then you can even fucking think of</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not on the app, but you get convinced that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not you get convinced that oh</p>
<p>This is all there is and the ways that these dating apps are developed are to fool the fuck out of your brain</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re convinced, that&rsquo;s all there is you&rsquo;ll keep swiping. You&rsquo;ll stay on it. You&rsquo;ll lower your standards or keep swiping</p>
<p>They want you to do that</p>
<p>But you need to remind yourself what you see on these apps is not all that there is there is so much more I</p>
<p>Guarantee you there&rsquo;s ten times what you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>Maybe even 20 that exists in real life the people that you&rsquo;re looking for the people of quality</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it are not on these fucking apps</p>
<p>Every once in a blue fucking moon, you&rsquo;ll get someone that&rsquo;s worth the fuck that&rsquo;s desperate enough or too busy</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll get on one of these apps and you&rsquo;ll find them</p>
<p>That is so few and far between I wouldn&rsquo;t even bother wasting my fucking time</p>
<p>Because like I said, there&rsquo;s too much to sort through</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>so someone can look cute but when you meet up with them and they walk weird or they&rsquo;re actually short or</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look like how you thought they would or they don&rsquo;t have the attitude that you thought they would that they were portraying online</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a waste of fucking time. You can knock all of that out</p>
<p>Just by meeting someone in person start going places to meet people if they walk weird</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see it immediately. You&rsquo;ll know not to fucking talk to them. Don&rsquo;t approach them</p>
<p>They walk like a fucking duck. You know what I mean? Like you can narrow it down in real life and one of the most</p>
<p>reassuring and like</p>
<p>uplifting things is when you&rsquo;ve been on the dating app and you feel so fucking ugly and</p>
<p>And then you go out in real life like say you go to a bar or a club or you go to a fucking yoga</p>
<p>Class because you&rsquo;re into yoga and you start seeing the people there and you like meet more people</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll realize you&rsquo;re a lot cuter than you thought</p>
<p>Dating apps make you insecure. They&rsquo;re fucking meant to so you&rsquo;ll stay on them. I</p>
<p>Just think there&rsquo;s too many problems with dating apps and too much bullshit to sort through that it&rsquo;s not even worth</p>
<p>My time that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not on them. Now if I get to another point where I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;d be bored and I have like</p>
<p>Free time and I want to go do all this and take the chance then I might I&rsquo;m not bashing dating apps</p>
<p>I kind of am not really I&rsquo;m just making you aware of what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>So you can protect yourself mentally if you choose to get on them. You need to be smart. You need to watch out for yourself</p>
<p>And you need to realize how these things are fucking you up mentally without you realizing oh</p>
<p>And one more thing I want to mention is how?</p>
<p>Disrespectful it is</p>
<p>When an ugly motherfucker swipes you or like super likes you</p>
<p>What the fuck is that? That is the most like</p>
<p>dehumanizing experience</p>
<p>Bitch you thought like it starts making you think like am I fucking delusional or are you like?</p>
<p>What did you think was gonna happen? Did you think you had a chance? You know, like I&rsquo;d be getting mad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you really looked at you and then looked at me and was like, yeah</p>
<p>What bitch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what?</p>
<p>Run that back turbo rethink that through bitch. Cuz did you really think or were you just like</p>
<p>Taking a shot out in the wild, you know, like were you just like I guess he I fuck</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just seen him that like just in case like what was the what was the race head, you know, I</p>
<p>Just think that is so disrespectful and I be getting my feelings hurt when ugly motherfuckers</p>
<p>Swipe me or like me cuz I&rsquo;m like you really thought like you thought he was the same caliber, huh?</p>
<p>And another thing talking about disrespect is people on these apps got big fucking balls. Okay, they&rsquo;re all tough stuff</p>
<p>And they say a lot of shit that they would not say in</p>
<p>person like they wouldn&rsquo;t dare test you the way that they do online and they would not be as</p>
<p>Slick with the shit that they say if they were face to face and that&rsquo;s just the internet in general</p>
<p>But I just need to reassure you that about dating apps because people are so goddamn sensitive and people are so goddamn stupid</p>
<p>So my last thing I definitely want to bring up is you need to keep in mind a lot of the times</p>
<p>People forget that it&rsquo;s actually another human being on the other end of the phone</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re communicating</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re swiping or not swiping what they&rsquo;re saying to you when they message you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it looks like a game like on your phone</p>
<p>It looks like a game and when you do it so much and you swipe so many people you get</p>
<p>Desensitized to it and you kind of forget that it&rsquo;s a human being and they have feelings too</p>
<p>Like the person that you&rsquo;re talking to and the person that you&rsquo;re swiping</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a human and a lot of people forget that so their actions are not gonna be</p>
<p>the best when it comes to like what they say and what they</p>
<p>Do and how they handle shit like if they just ignore you</p>
<p>They forget that it&rsquo;s another human being like they lack consideration</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all I want to say about dating apps</p>
<p>But I do want to make an entire episode about hookup apps like grinder or whatever the straights got for like when they want</p>
<p>to fuck each other</p>
<p>That is a whole like five hour podcast of things to unpack</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll definitely do that soon</p>
<p>But in the meantime if you have anything else you want to hear me talk about you can leave a review of this</p>
<p>podcast five stars preferably</p>
<p>Five I&rsquo;m holding my hand up like I&rsquo;m gonna backhand the fuck out of you</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t give me five stars like don&rsquo;t say nothing if you&rsquo;re gonna give me one star or like anything less than five</p>
<p>Just shut up and just don&rsquo;t talk to me. Okay. Bye</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re gonna give me five, I would love to hear what you have to say</p>
<p>So if you want to like comment a topic you can leave a review and then you can add a description to it or you</p>
<p>Can message me on my Instagram?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it in the description of this podcast because I&rsquo;m not gonna try and spell it all out</p>
<p>You can message me on there</p>
<p>Anything you want to hear my hot take on or you want to hear my perspective on I?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Hope that you got something out of this podcast if you did like it share it</p>
<p>Maybe tell your friend about it. Tell your friend that&rsquo;s addicted to dating apps about it. Maybe maybe they need to hear this</p>
<p>All right. That&rsquo;s all I got. Thank you for listening and I will talk to you guys next Sunday</p>
