    <p>Hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a crazy couple of weeks here.</p>
<p>We had the All In Summit, and boy, was it amazing.</p>
<p>Our bestie David Freeburg couldn&rsquo;t make it today.</p>
<p>He had some personal things he had to attend to.</p>
<p>So joining us again is Brad Gershner.</p>
<p>Welcome back to the fifth bestie on his, is this your fourth appearance now, including</p>
<p>the All In Summit?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve been on four times now.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about 5% of the episodes.</p>
<p>Nice, nice.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a nice little chip in your, in your, in your, your belt there.</p>
<p>I mean, unworthy replacement to Freidberg, but I do what I can do.</p>
<p>Nobody can replace Freidberg.</p>
<p>That is the truth.</p>
<p>Just going around the horn here, Tramov, did you have a favorite moment on stage, a favorite</p>
<p>moment off stage?</p>
<p>Well, what is your general impressions of the All In Summit 2022?</p>
<p>I thought the people I met were really impressive.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed meeting people and learning what they did.</p>
<p>I also thought you and your team organized really an incredible event, and I forgot how</p>
<p>good you are at these things, but, um, so I give you a lot of credit.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed participating.</p>
<p>The only thing that I was nervous about during that whole thing, which probably limited a</p>
<p>little bit of my fun, was my mom was coming, she&rsquo;s 81.</p>
<p>And so it was not, I was not super psyched to really be in the throes of all the parties,</p>
<p>to be honest, just because I was like, I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to get COVID and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to introduce it to her and.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, Nat ended up getting really, really sick, but more like a flu and a cold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, but you know, I&rsquo;ve been fine.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I know a bunch of folks that came out, unfortunately tested positive.</p>
<p>So that was the only, that&rsquo;s the only downside where I would, I would have wanted to be a</p>
<p>little bit more carefree, but, um, that was the only thing that was, but that&rsquo;s not in</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, I recall that when I had a Christmas party back in December, like a week later, he called</p>
<p>my Christmas party at a super spreader.</p>
<p>Even though I tested everybody at the door, every single person was negative at this.</p>
<p>So, so my parents went to this conference, they both got COVID my aunt who lives in Miami,</p>
<p>he was in her 70.</p>
<p>She got COVID.</p>
<p>How are they doing?</p>
<p>Are they okay?</p>
<p>By the way?</p>
<p>Are they okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Omicron.</p>
<p>It was like, you know, it&rsquo;s like bad for two days and then you get better.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to be fine.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Or no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One did.</p>
<p>And one didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, um, my brother&rsquo;s got COVID and your brother&rsquo;s got it, Josh and Jamie both got it.</p>
<p>And then Josh&rsquo;s wife got it.</p>
<p>So she, um, took the PAX love and everybody&rsquo;s great now, but yeah, if you go to my, a lot</p>
<p>of people who came to the event, it was their first time out.</p>
<p>Like this was for a lot of people, I think very emotional and exciting because it was</p>
<p>their first venture out.</p>
<p>And if you go to Miami to a conference, like you&rsquo;re going to get, especially if the event</p>
<p>organizer doesn&rsquo;t test anybody, it&rsquo;s impractical to test 850 people.</p>
<p>Nobody would come.</p>
<p>Not if you want to make a profit.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Nah, it wouldn&rsquo;t have actually been that expensive.</p>
<p>You could put that on the people.</p>
<p>They could just, you know, share their results.</p>
<p>But I think at this point, you know, even on the planes going out there, nobody&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>masks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know, well, you guys are flying private, but you know, my flight out</p>
<p>there, it was all, you know, nobody&rsquo;s wearing masks anymore, but anyway, J Cal, I think</p>
<p>everybody who went to the conference took the risk upon themselves of getting COVID</p>
<p>and you know, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world or anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all fine, but I&rsquo;m just pointing out the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>My hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re like Nancy Pelosi or something where every time a Republican gets COVID,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their fault.</p>
<p>But when you throw a super spreader, and I think AIS now stands for all in super spreader.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p>It was well beyond your control.</p>
<p>It was the virus.</p>
<p>And in fact, it was probably just Florida.</p>
<p>It was just, it was Miami.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s the Santa&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>In fact, I was going to bring it up.</p>
<p>Both of you now have thrown super spreader events.</p>
<p>Yes, but in mine, I tested.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even proven that mine was a super spreader.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, did you have a favorite moment on stage or some reflections on the</p>
<p>event?</p>
<p>I thought the Elon thing was really good, by the way.</p>
<p>And the only thing I&rsquo;ll say is the Palmer Lucky thing was pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, which will be we will be releasing the Palmer Lucky episode next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see that.</p>
<p>I think that that episode is eye opening.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t want to say too much, but I think that you were really, I think you handled</p>
<p>yourself really well there.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Chamath, what actually happened?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there for that portion.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p>
<p>We gave a mini summary here of it, I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the outside inversion.</p>
<p>He gives what I can only describe as an incredibly motivating breakdown of American defense and</p>
<p>what his company and, you know, you have to remember to put it in context, this is a 29</p>
<p>year old young man who has now started two multibillion dollar unicorn.</p>
<p>So, you know, this he&rsquo;s going to be around for a long time doing amazing things.</p>
<p>But he talks about Anduril, which is his defense company.</p>
<p>Really impressive.</p>
<p>And then the whole, you know, everybody&rsquo;s kind of like rousing and cheering and applauding.</p>
<p>And then he said, you know, I have something else that I want to get off my chest.</p>
<p>And I was standing beside Jason backstage, Jason was looking at the monitor.</p>
<p>I was looking at the mirror at myself.</p>
<p>But and check your sweater.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, there&rsquo;s a person here that that has been, you know, really hard</p>
<p>on me, you know, tried to ruin my life, attack my family.</p>
<p>And represents, you know, these really this strain of very influential people in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, who have gotten it totally wrong, basically.</p>
<p>And he called out cancel culture.</p>
<p>And then he called out Jekyll.</p>
<p>And to Jekyll&rsquo;s credit, after he was done, Jekyll was the first one that walked out</p>
<p>on stage, shook Palmer&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>And then we all sat down, we talked to him, and then the two ended up hugging it out at</p>
<p>the end.</p>
<p>But there were moments that were very heated in the middle of it.</p>
<p>The whole thing was incredible to watch.</p>
<p>I got to be honest with you.</p>
<p>It was super dramatic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>I would say that the most shocking and surprising aspect of the whole thing was that a person</p>
<p>as important as Palmer and Lucky felt the need to get revenge on a person as unimportant</p>
<p>as Jason Calacanis.</p>
<p>That was the part I mentioned when he&rsquo;s like, my career was said important people in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley.</p>
<p>I initially thought, oh, my God, he&rsquo;s talking about me.</p>
<p>What did I say?</p>
<p>I was I was thrown by that, too, if I&rsquo;m being honest, he&rsquo;s like, my entire career was stopped</p>
<p>in its tracks.</p>
<p>And I had to claw my way back because Jason Calacanis said this.</p>
<p>And I was like, um, no, actually, I&rsquo;m looking forward to when you&rsquo;re going to be a great</p>
<p>episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be coming out next week.</p>
<p>Thank you to all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to give a shout out to Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi and Antonio Garcia Martinez for</p>
<p>appearing.</p>
<p>And, you know, we did two different panels.</p>
<p>We did one on domestic politics with Glenn and Taibbi.</p>
<p>And then the we did a debate on Ukraine, which has now been published between Glenn and Antonio</p>
<p>And particularly, I want to thank Antonio, because it did end up being a little bit of</p>
<p>a two on one at the end, which wasn&rsquo;t my intention.</p>
<p>But I have my own views on it, too, although I did try to be somewhat restrained and even</p>
<p>handed in the moderation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a really good debate.</p>
<p>We should have had longer.</p>
<p>We only had about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>But you can see that online right now, it actually is a great example of actually how</p>
<p>to listen to somebody else having a completely diametrically opposed view and still be respectful.</p>
<p>I thought those guys were great to listen to.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a new format, Saxon.</p>
<p>I think, you know, somebody was like, hey, maybe you and J-Cal could do it.</p>
<p>I think you and I moderating like two people with different sides, it could be like a really</p>
<p>interesting format for us for future events.</p>
<p>Brad, did you have a favorite moment on stage?</p>
<p>Maybe outside of Elon?</p>
<p>Of course, you can mention.</p>
<p>Well, I would say, you know, maybe both on stage and off stage, you know, I think listen,</p>
<p>I think this podcast has taken some shots and probably appropriately so at times for</p>
<p>being a bunch of men in a little bro culture.</p>
<p>And the effort made to build authentic community and diversity into that room, I&rsquo;ve been to</p>
<p>a lot of conferences, whether it&rsquo;s Claire Thielke, you know, Patty Wexler, extraordinary,</p>
<p>you know, minds, women, all diverse cultures, economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>When we walked around the floor, you know, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, everywhere,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And who are starting companies having authentic conversations, and frankly, we&rsquo;re grateful</p>
<p>for the community and the advice that they were being given.</p>
<p>These were from big startups to very small startups.</p>
<p>And so for me, that was a highlight the effort you made, I don&rsquo;t know, almost 40% women,</p>
<p>you know, both economic, I thought, as well as, you know, geographic diversity.</p>
<p>And then, you know, listen, I had a moment.</p>
<p>After Bill and I after Gurley and I got off stage, I was stopped by a group of founders</p>
<p>and they said, Hey, we need your help.</p>
<p>I said, What?</p>
<p>And they said, We are that company you and Bill were just talking about and said was</p>
<p>screwed.</p>
<p>We raised $100 million last November from from Tiger at 100 times ARR.</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And like, like the fact that that, you know, that those conversations are going on, of</p>
<p>course, they&rsquo;re not screwed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very interesting company.</p>
<p>But it led to a real conversation that you don&rsquo;t often have at conferences like that.</p>
<p>And so I thought it was much more than just a bunch of talking heads on stage.</p>
<p>I thought it was a real give and take in, you know, in the crowd afterwards, the parties,</p>
<p>the in betweens.</p>
<p>And so I really enjoyed that.</p>
<p>The other big thing that we avoided failing on was putting back the AMA.</p>
<p>I think these AMAs are some of the most interesting parts of that conference.</p>
<p>And I think that we should make sure that we probably do an AMA Jason, like, both days</p>
<p>if we do a two day conference, the AMAs are awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, when the audience is asking us and just to explain to people how we were able to,</p>
<p>you know, curate the audience, we asked people, I think it&rsquo;s a good playbook for other people</p>
<p>if they want to steal it, to they could, they could pick the price they wanted to pay based</p>
<p>on their station in life.</p>
<p>And so people said, I want to come, I&rsquo;ll pay 500, I&rsquo;ll pay 1000, I&rsquo;ll pay 2500 instead</p>
<p>of the 7500 ticket price, which was like 300 people in the audience.</p>
<p>And we just said, hey, what do you love about the show?</p>
<p>You know, what would coming to the conference mean to you?</p>
<p>And we kind of just sorted that and we look for people who are passionate about the show.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the thing that stuck out to me, and I know Freeberg had a great time</p>
<p>as well, was the passion of the audience and how much they appreciate what we do here every</p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>So the love that we got people asking to take selfies, people telling us what the show meant</p>
<p>to us, you know, and people coming from all different stations in life, really, it made</p>
<p>it not elitist.</p>
<p>But it felt like the people who were there, were all builders.</p>
<p>And that was really an interesting part, what I instructed the team to do was anybody who</p>
<p>was like a real estate broker, a money manager, a sales executive, a business development</p>
<p>person, I said, let&rsquo;s not have them there, no offense to those, you know, critical functions,</p>
<p>but a lot of people will come to these events to sell and get customers.</p>
<p>But I said, anybody who&rsquo;s a builder and artists, they&rsquo;re making something in the world, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give them the priority for these scholarship tickets.</p>
<p>So, you know, when you met people, they were all building something interesting in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>And no press, I think also created a certain vibe there.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have the media, they&rsquo;re criticizing every panel and, you know, every speaker.</p>
<p>And so it I think it just, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a great show.</p>
<p>Well, I think it really couldn&rsquo;t do it without all you guys, and Freeberg and the besties</p>
<p>and Brad, you were helping behind the scenes.</p>
<p>So couldn&rsquo;t do it without everybody.</p>
<p>And my team, you know, great job.</p>
<p>It turned out surprisingly well, I thought.</p>
<p>I thought the whole thing was a J. Cal grift, and it actually turned out well, there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>there was there&rsquo;s some grifting going on, for sure.</p>
<p>We still haven&rsquo;t seen an accounting of exactly where all the money went.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s close, we&rsquo;ll have that accounting any day now, Saks, any day now.</p>
<p>What could you have done better?</p>
<p>What would you change for the next time?</p>
<p>You know, I guess a great question.</p>
<p>You know, we always do a document with lessons learned right after the event.</p>
<p>So I went through my team, and I had 26 people for my team, 21 from launch, and I think five</p>
<p>from insight came and, you know, helped staff the event, a little more time to work on the</p>
<p>speakers in the agenda.</p>
<p>If we had a little more time, I would have teased out of each bestie, you know, maybe</p>
<p>five or 10 speakers or topics they wanted and worked backwards.</p>
<p>So just a little more time to, to experiment with the format.</p>
<p>But I took an experimental approach to it.</p>
<p>We did have people who did solo dolo, like Ted style talks.</p>
<p>We then had people come on stage with the besties and do discussions.</p>
<p>But having all besties on stage all the time is a little hard for for everybody.</p>
<p>I know David likes to focus on maybe a couple of things.</p>
<p>Other people like Chamath and I like to be on stage for everything, I think.</p>
<p>But the format was experimental.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of great moments, I think when we overlapped folks, I think Nate</p>
<p>Silver overlap with Keith Raboy, you and Bill Gurley together, Tim Urban, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>overlapped with Keith Raboy.</p>
<p>Those were magical moments, I think.</p>
<p>And so I have something in my brain about weaving individual talks and data points with</p>
<p>the besties and then having the next speaker on the stage, the next speaker, and I would</p>
<p>have liked to have more time to refine that format, I think.</p>
<p>Okay, my only question is, was the Palmer Lucky Deal, was that a plant?</p>
<p>Did you plan that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the backstory is, I, you know, I had invited him on this week, it starts</p>
<p>before all in came out.</p>
<p>Many times he said, fuck you, basically, in so many words, I hate Jake out.</p>
<p>And then when all in came out, he&rsquo;s a fan of this show, I think he&rsquo;s particularly a</p>
<p>fan of David Sacks&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And I think David knows a lot of the investors, the investor pools, I think overlap in a lot</p>
<p>of different circles of ours.</p>
<p>And I said, Would you like to come to the summit?</p>
<p>And I, and I basically said to him, heartfelt, like, Listen, I think the work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to protect the country, most people in Silicon Valley don&rsquo;t believe in building weapons systems,</p>
<p>but I kind of am with you on this.</p>
<p>So we probably have some common ground here.</p>
<p>I think the mission of what you&rsquo;re doing is more important than our disagreement from,</p>
<p>you know, the Hillary Clinton versus Trump days, maybe we could just, you know, put that</p>
<p>aside and have you speak.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, as people were like, Yes, I didn&rsquo;t know they were doing yes, because</p>
<p>he had a plot to dunk on me.</p>
<p>But who cares?</p>
<p>You know, like, I don&rsquo;t mind being dunked on, if I&rsquo;m wrong about something, or I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>The whole spirit of this show is to, you know, to learn and grow and have great conversations.</p>
<p>So with that, maybe we start the show now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let me Am I still allowed to do intros?</p>
<p>Or is it too triggering?</p>
<p>Because I do have interest for this week.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>So do it.</p>
<p>Okay, I got thumbs up.</p>
<p>Only if they&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s the caveat that I cannot guarantee.</p>
<p>But anyway, here we go.</p>
<p>Getting ready to gallivant across the Italian countryside.</p>
<p>He spent 40k at all in summit on food and wine.</p>
<p>He took 400 selfies in three hours.</p>
<p>Those sweaters, my lord, they reek of power.</p>
<p>The dictator himself is back.</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, welcome back to the show.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jason.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>His body looks like he doesn&rsquo;t eat cake.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a major stake in Snowflake.</p>
<p>You might have heard him earlier on the week with Bill Gurley.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the crossover fund manager with that BDE.</p>
<p>Our fifth bestie, the audience hangs on every word he has to say, the Dark Knight of Namaste.</p>
<p>Welcome back to the program, Brad Gershner.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s BDE?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, then you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You can look that up, Urban Dictionary.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about to turn 50, but he looks like he&rsquo;s 65.</p>
<p>After 72 hours in Miami, we&rsquo;re not sure he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>The crib creeper is jealous of the bags under his eyes.</p>
<p>His portfolio has been down for 35 straight days.</p>
<p>No surprise, the rain man himself is back.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Too rough on Sachs?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Is it okay?</p>
<p>I felt like I might&rsquo;ve gone too rough on Sachs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>With markets and S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date, Dow down 11%.</p>
<p>Two stocks of note that did particularly well during COVID, Zoom and Snowflake reported</p>
<p>their earnings this week, and they beat expectations.</p>
<p>Of course, that gives them no reprieve.</p>
<p>Market cap for Zoom, 31 billion, got almost $6 billion in cash, which was a prescient</p>
<p>move to cash up, I guess, during the boom times.</p>
<p>Their stock jumped 18% after the earnings, so great for them.</p>
<p>Q1 revenue 2023, 1 billion, 12% year over year.</p>
<p>They got an 80% gross margin for that business, pretty impressive.</p>
<p>500 million in adjusted free cash flow, 7,000 employees.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at almost 500,000 per employee at this point, and stock is still down 43% year</p>
<p>to date.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bump here, so I guess we might be bumping along the bottom soon, and just to</p>
<p>quickly recap Snowflake and get your comments after that, Snowflake reported their quarterly</p>
<p>earnings yesterday, $41 billion market cap.</p>
<p>They got almost 4 billion in cash.</p>
<p>They were down slightly at the taping of this episode today, and they&rsquo;re down 67% from the</p>
<p>peak of $409 a share in November.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not in the 85% plus club like Coinbase and Peloton, but still they&rsquo;ve lost two thirds</p>
<p>of their market cap, 422 million in revenue, 85% year over year, beat their expectations,</p>
<p>and gross margin 72%, net retention 174%, 70% growth within their existing customers</p>
<p>to David Sachs&rsquo; point about why SaaS is so great.</p>
<p>They got 4,000 employees, 6,300 total customers.</p>
<p>So I guess maybe starting with you, Brad, since you&rsquo;re in this in the thick of it, thoughts</p>
<p>on I know you&rsquo;re a major Snowflake early supporter, thoughts on what&rsquo;s happening in the market</p>
<p>and maybe any indication from these two, let&rsquo;s face it, strong results in the bouncing along</p>
<p>the bottom, I think is how we&rsquo;d all describe what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>Well, I think, listen, what makes investing hard is sometimes you have to hold simultaneous</p>
<p>truth, right?</p>
<p>And the reality is there&rsquo;s a lot of cognitive dissonance when you see something down 30,</p>
<p>40, 50%, but it may be still fair value, right?</p>
<p>We were talking about last October, like make no mistake about it.</p>
<p>Just take Snowflake as an example.</p>
<p>The move from 400 to 200 was probably just what I would describe as normalization in</p>
<p>a world where rates were going back to two and a half or 3%, right?</p>
<p>The market last October had gone too high.</p>
<p>We discussed it on this pod.</p>
<p>We discussed it on CNBC.</p>
<p>And so I expected a return to what we call the five-year average, as we discussed at</p>
<p>the summit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been surprising to me is the negative reflexivity that&rsquo;s kicked in as a result of</p>
<p>the war in Ukraine, uncertainty about hyperinflation, uncertainty about hyper rates.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re seeing software generally, all risk assets, growth assets trading now</p>
<p>30, 40, 50% below the five-year average, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s helpful to say, well, none of that should have happened.</p>
<p>No, the reality is normalization meant that all of this stuff was going to be down 20</p>
<p>to 50% because it was way overvalued last fall.</p>
<p>We gaslighted ourselves in many respects.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t hedge it perfectly in many respects.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what happens in late market cycles.</p>
<p>So the question is, where are we today?</p>
<p>And for example, why is the NASDAQ up 300 basis points today, right?</p>
<p>It feels like whiplash.</p>
<p>I come in one day and you have market caps up 10% one day, down 10% the next.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s really important to help the people listening understand what happened</p>
<p>this week and what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It is been kind of a pretty mixed bag this week, in fact, of things going down.</p>
<p>Chamath, what are you going to take on this of what we&rsquo;re seeing in the market this week</p>
<p>specifically with precipitous drops and then, you know, the bouncing up again?</p>
<p>Look, we, we still had some amount of rate uncertainty from the Fed.</p>
<p>I think people weren&rsquo;t sure how aggressively they were going to hike.</p>
<p>But by early this week, it was pretty clear there&rsquo;s going to be two 50-point hikes, one</p>
<p>in June and one in July, and then effectively a pause because then the Fed funds rate will</p>
<p>be at around 2%.</p>
<p>And everything from there will probably be path and data dependent, OK?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s effectively what they said.</p>
<p>Now, I think the markets had actually already started to see that writing on the wall.</p>
<p>So if you go back to, you know, one of our favorite measures, which is the 10-year breakeven,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s effectively rolled over, which meant that, you know, which means that from the</p>
<p>highs in sort of late April, it started to come down, which says that, you know, they</p>
<p>were thinking that, you know, the inflation was not going to be as bad in the back half</p>
<p>of the year.</p>
<p>And then the second is that corporate credit, which is really what matters in some ways</p>
<p>to the Fed because that&rsquo;s where they can intervene.</p>
<p>What is the spread above treasuries that a company can issue debt?</p>
<p>When it goes crazy and it goes up, it means, oh, no, the cost of capital is going up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be hard for companies to raise money.</p>
<p>They may have to lay people off.</p>
<p>They may need to get into cost-cutting mode, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what goes through everybody&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also now about 35 and 40 days rolled over, which means that the gap has started</p>
<p>to shrink, you know, between the U.S. treasury price and what, you know, decent corporates</p>
<p>can issue debt at.</p>
<p>So it looks like we are set up for potentially a decent little rally here.</p>
<p>The problem is, is it a rally that is sustainable or is it a rally that&rsquo;s basically what we</p>
<p>call a dead cat bounce or a bear market rally where, you know, you just get some one or</p>
<p>two weeks of relief before the thing spears down again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to know, although tomorrow, on Friday, there&rsquo;s going to be a really important</p>
<p>set of inflation data that gets released, and I think everybody&rsquo;s going to be sweating</p>
<p>these details.</p>
<p>So right now, we&rsquo;re in a moment of pause, and there is the potential, if this data comes</p>
<p>back as reasonably good, which means prices are, you know, not escalating as much as we</p>
<p>thought.</p>
<p>Inflation is not going to be as bad.</p>
<p>Growth is going to be moderate.</p>
<p>That gives a lot of ammo for the Fed to kind of take their foot off the gas here, and if</p>
<p>that case, markets will go boom.</p>
<p>Sachs, the interesting note, I think, is what we talked about here.</p>
<p>Everything was correcting except housing, and we were wondering when this, you know,</p>
<p>the increasing rates would hit mortgage rates, mortgages way above 5% in the last two weeks,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s come down a little bit.</p>
<p>But the mortgage rate basically doubled.</p>
<p>And then we finally saw it earlier in this week.</p>
<p>What day was it?</p>
<p>It was two days ago.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re taping this on Thursday.</p>
<p>So I think on Tuesday, new home sales 591,000, they expected 749.</p>
<p>And I think the last month before that was 763.</p>
<p>Is that indicative of the raising the rates and slowing down inflation has finally occurred,</p>
<p>and that maybe we, the Fed, maybe skewed too much into the turn?</p>
<p>How do you interpret that massive, it was a pretty massive miss in terms of home sales</p>
<p>in the estimate?</p>
<p>Well, the costs of buying a home are going way up because home loans are now more expensive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to factor into all sorts of consumer purchases.</p>
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s finance can be more expensive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also seeing companies starting to slow down spending, really starting to slam on</p>
<p>the brakes.</p>
<p>We see in a startup land, startups are all slashing costs right now.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s eventually going to percolate up to big companies too.</p>
<p>You saw Dara&rsquo;s memo, basically, when he got back from Wall Street, remember he published</p>
<p>that a couple of weeks ago saying we need to sharpen our pencils, cut everything.</p>
<p>What Wall Street is looking for now is free cash flow.</p>
<p>So it seems to me like we&rsquo;re headed into a pretty serious downturn or recession here.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been saying we&rsquo;re in a recession for months.</p>
<p>The tricky thing for the Fed is that they don&rsquo;t have a lot of good options because we</p>
<p>have a lot of recession indicators blinking red right now.</p>
<p>At the same time, inflation is still high.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>I think what the Fed should have done in 2020 hindsight is back last summer, we first</p>
<p>got that shock CPI print, remember it was like 5.1%, seemed to come out of the blue</p>
<p>because for years and years, we&rsquo;ve been talking about deflation, nobody thought inflation</p>
<p>was a problem.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, we got that 5.1% print.</p>
<p>They were in total denial about it.</p>
<p>They just dismissed it saying that inflation was transitory and Yellen said the same thing.</p>
<p>Basically, everyone just ignored the data for six months.</p>
<p>What they should have done was stop QE right then and there.</p>
<p>They could have taken a little bit of time to think out a rate increase strategy, but</p>
<p>they were still basically engaging in QE for nine months after that first inflation warning.</p>
<p>If they had stopped QE there, then we wouldn&rsquo;t have had this asset bubble in the second half</p>
<p>of last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it inflated the most.</p>
<p>We could have had more of a soft landing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now, they kept inflating and really until the end of Q1, and they&rsquo;ve yanked</p>
<p>away the punch bowl so violently that I think the real economy is going to go into recession.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is now, given that we&rsquo;re in this almost stagflationary</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try and answer that, Brad.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t act soon enough, if you agree with Sax&rsquo;s point, pretty hard to disagree</p>
<p>with, and we didn&rsquo;t take the medicine a little bit at a time, and now maybe we&rsquo;ve overreacted,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s going to get worse, what is the right thing for us to be doing now?</p>
<p>Because all these companies doing hiring freezes, layoffs, at the same time that the housing</p>
<p>market tanks, at the same time crypto tanks, at the same time the stock market tanks, this</p>
<p>feels like a major shock to the system.</p>
<p>Is it time to maybe reconsider some of these, you know, for the Fed to reconsider, or just</p>
<p>slow and steady wins the race here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best option?</p>
<p>First, we should erect statues to Senator Manchin for saving the republic by vetoing</p>
<p>stimmy two.</p>
<p>That would have been devastating, that would have been devastating.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll revisit that.</p>
<p>Listen, the Fed said two really important things this week.</p>
<p>They said, number one, our communications have been helpful in shifting market expectations.</p>
<p>What that means, the Fed is the air traffic control.</p>
<p>They said to the markets at the beginning of the year, you&rsquo;re 90 degrees off runway</p>
<p>heading, get your ass back on runway heading.</p>
<p>It was a slap in the face to markets, and it was a radical adjustment.</p>
<p>Now you hear the Fed in these little statements this week.</p>
<p>They said, hey, we&rsquo;re well positioned this year to assess the effects of policy firming</p>
<p>in the back half.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re going to hit it with 50-50 and then we&rsquo;re going to take a look.</p>
<p>So now think of it as air traffic control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re two degrees to the left, you&rsquo;re two degrees to the right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re steering us on runway heading.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Fed wants to do anything at this moment to lose credibility in the</p>
<p>inflation fight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get 50.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get another 50.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re doing what they want to do, which is keeping markets sufficiently tight.</p>
<p>They wanted to take the crypto market down.</p>
<p>They wanted to take all the excessive risks in the stock market down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>The inventory of $350,000 homes spiked from four months to nine months.</p>
<p>Used car prices are rolling over the last three months.</p>
<p>All the things they needed to do, they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They need to stay the course.</p>
<p>However, the hyperventilation this week by Bill Ackman on Twitter, that the Fed needs</p>
<p>to be doing radically more, that somehow we need to be raising rates to 6%, 7%, 8% in</p>
<p>order to squash inflation, to me seems highly misdirected and totally out of touch with</p>
<p>the fact that on layoffs.fyi, they&rsquo;ve already announced 750 companies that are announcing</p>
<p>layoffs.</p>
<p>The market is getting the drill.</p>
<p>I totally agree with this.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a pretty reasonable place here.</p>
<p>The real question is now, what do you need to take the market lower?</p>
<p>This is more of a nuance, but when you look at companies that are now, quote unquote,</p>
<p>cheap, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example like you, well, we hear a lot about Google or Facebook, right?</p>
<p>People will say, my gosh, this is cheap because if you run a screen on it, it&rsquo;s like 10, 11,</p>
<p>12 times price to earnings.</p>
<p>Well, the price, you know, because you can look on the screen.</p>
<p>The real question is, are the earnings right?</p>
<p>And the thing that can take the market lower is if you actually think earnings are modeled</p>
<p>incorrectly, right?</p>
<p>So we saw this week as well, Snap, I mean, completely just blew themselves up.</p>
<p>46% down intraday yesterday, I think.</p>
<p>I just want to say something about Snap.</p>
<p>In one day.</p>
<p>They have the most incredible propensity to self immolate on earnings calls than any other</p>
<p>company I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably been three times, no less than three times over the last four years</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s just poorly scripted or not well rehearsed or the people</p>
<p>that are helping Evan get ready for these things, but these are disastrous calls.</p>
<p>You know, Facebook&rsquo;s had a couple in its lifetime, but Snap consistently, probably once every</p>
<p>18 months, will do this anyways.</p>
<p>The thing just completely implodes.</p>
<p>The stock implodes by 48% or something, and then it, you know, rolls over to companies</p>
<p>like Facebook and Google, who then are off eight or 10%.</p>
<p>My point in telling you the story is that if you think Facebook and Google, just as</p>
<p>an example, again, are cheap at 10 times, well, you better hope that the earnings are</p>
<p>right because the earnings are actually wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually 27 times and 19 times, you know, I&rsquo;m making these numbers up to give</p>
<p>you the example because the earnings are fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the risk now that&rsquo;s left in the market, in my opinion, that could take it</p>
<p>much, much lower is if that, you know, all of this slowdown really contracts spend and</p>
<p>the earnings are actually not accurate.</p>
<p>The forecasted earnings will need to be revised over the next two or three quarters, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we will probably see the low.</p>
<p>If however, growth is muted and the Fed can, as Brad said, it&rsquo;s a really good analogy now,</p>
<p>is course correct by degrees, you know, a degree here, degree there, we&rsquo;ve probably</p>
<p>consolidated the lows.</p>
<p>So said another way, we look at a company like snap, or Google, a lot of their expected</p>
<p>value has to do with people&rsquo;s ad spend, we now see less homes being sold.</p>
<p>So maybe people in real estate stop spending less on ads, there are major advertising category,</p>
<p>maybe direct to consumer, people are not buying because the supply chain issues, this stuff</p>
<p>is too expensive.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to spend on ads.</p>
<p>And so all of this ad revenue, that&rsquo;s some of the first to come out of people&rsquo;s budgets.</p>
<p>So you know, even as great as snaps results, actually, look, they were up 38% year over</p>
<p>year, they&rsquo;re generating over 100 million free cash flow,</p>
<p>the guide was terrible, because what they said was our E, right, our earnings, right,</p>
<p>are not modeled accurately, right.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the risk that you now have to take to every company, you cannot look</p>
<p>at a screen on Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg, look at a price to earnings ratio and say,</p>
<p>wow, seven times, that&rsquo;s so cheap, it may not be seven, you have to do your own work,</p>
<p>it could actually be much higher than that, because your earnings may be at risk.</p>
<p>The earnings being at risk is this contagion that we talked about, I don&rsquo;t know, six, maybe</p>
<p>it was like, we&rsquo;re going on almost a year now, sacks, we talked about a contagion happening,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve all experienced it in the last two recessions to that the dot com bust in</p>
<p>the Great Recession.</p>
<p>So what are you seeing in terms of at companies, this contagion risk, are people canceling</p>
<p>SAS contracts on the margins, obviously, people are doing hiring freezes, obviously, people</p>
<p>are laying people off, are people going to start renegotiating salaries?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the next couple of shoes to drop here, sacks, and that would signal</p>
<p>to you a true bottom here?</p>
<p>Like, have you seen, I thought maybe one would be if somebody offered somebody an investment</p>
<p>with a two or three times liquidation preference?</p>
<p>Have you seen one of those yet?</p>
<p>Have you seen people say, we&rsquo;re going to renegotiate salaries, because that&rsquo;s when it was really</p>
<p>dark, right?</p>
<p>The last two times?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s gonna take time to get to that point.</p>
<p>I mean, where you start seeing structure and deal is in deals is when a founder is trying</p>
<p>to preserve a valuation they got last year, and that can&rsquo;t really be justified, but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to just take the down round.</p>
<p>So you try to preserve the optics of the last round by building all these preferential terms.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to do deals that way.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll start to see them happen later this year when companies get more desperate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the first thing that happens, though.</p>
<p>I think that, to your point about the talent market, it&rsquo;s definitely going to happen.</p>
<p>Has it happened yet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What has to happen is first, all these open recs get canceled, companies freeze their</p>
<p>hiring plans, then eventually they do layoffs, that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Both of those things are here.</p>
<p>Both are here.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the next in talent wars?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, but within the next six months, the talent market is not gonna be as hot.</p>
<p>And you know, in the same way that startups aren&rsquo;t getting 10 term sheets, now that maybe</p>
<p>they get one or two, if they&rsquo;re a good company, same thing with talent, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna have 10 job offers, they might have one or two, and that&rsquo;s gonna create</p>
<p>the same upward pressure, continuing upward pressure for increases in comp.</p>
<p>To your point about, like, will SaaS contracts be cut?</p>
<p>I mean, I think software is pretty sticky, I mean, if it&rsquo;s a good product.</p>
<p>Will deal cycles get longer?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Will there be more mortality risk in the startup or SMB customer bases of companies?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think one concept that startups may want to wrap their heads around is what I would</p>
<p>call deferred mortality risk, meaning that during the last few years, during the boom</p>
<p>times, the graduation rate from C to Series A to Series B was very high, perhaps artificially</p>
<p>high.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of companies that got funded in advance to the next round, where in more</p>
<p>normal times, they wouldn&rsquo;t have made it.</p>
<p>So now if those companies haven&rsquo;t really fixed their issues, they&rsquo;ve just deferred the mortality.</p>
<p>So I think all of us probably in SaaS land need to be modeling out higher logo churn</p>
<p>for customer bases that are skewed towards startups or SMBs, and we don&rsquo;t know what those</p>
<p>numbers are gonna be yet, but that is likely to happen.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think the other thing is that there&rsquo;s a lot of companies that are gonna have to get</p>
<p>religion on free cash flow conversion, ASAP.</p>
<p>And I just think that most CEOs, to be very blunt, are poorly educated and innumerate.</p>
<p>So their level of numeracy to even understand this is pretty poor.</p>
<p>And most board directors are equally.</p>
<p>Can you unpack it right now?</p>
<p>What does it mean to get the business to free cash flow?</p>
<p>What does it take?</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>And what are the how do those businesses look differently to spend less than you make?</p>
<p>Okay, hold on, I just want to make sure I got it correct.</p>
<p>You make money, but the number of the money you make is higher than the number of the</p>
<p>money you spend.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a delta there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some difference between those two numbers.</p>
<p>And that number is important to some people is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I think increasingly getting that number to be greater than zero is going to be really</p>
<p>important.</p>
<p>It allows you again, everybody starts to throw out this whole thing, which is, oh, my God,</p>
<p>you can never slow growth and the company will die.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe in a vacuum that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But when every other company is fighting tooth and nail to survive, the only thing that you</p>
<p>need to do is actually survive.</p>
<p>By surviving, you win.</p>
<p>And if you can basically make your cash last as long as possible, even if you cut to the</p>
<p>bone and stop growing, if you come out the other end, and you&rsquo;re the only company that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>left, you will win and run over the market.</p>
<p>You may have pushed to the right a few years, your plans of world dominance, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still available to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the company that foolishly thinks that they can continue to spend money at the same</p>
<p>rate or in the same ways that are going to learn this hard lesson.</p>
<p>Because I think that investors are not going to tolerate being able to provide incremental</p>
<p>capital to organizations funds who are then, you know, misallocating that capital to basically</p>
<p>support a poorly marked portfolio.</p>
<p>And I think that is going to be the real come to Jesus that actually makes all of this thing</p>
<p>come clean, like pension funds, family offices, endowments, all these organizations are smart</p>
<p>enough to realize that they&rsquo;re giving good money after bad if what those folks are going</p>
<p>to do is not demand portfolio rehabilitation, and instead are just going to basically keep</p>
<p>the marks of their old funds because they&rsquo;re just in a in a game of waiting it out, where</p>
<p>the whole taking action greater than you know, blind hope and just going, you know, steady</p>
<p>doing what you&rsquo;ve been doing, you got to make some changes.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I&rsquo;d love Brad&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>I think that most growth oriented funds are looking at their portfolios.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to balance two strategies.</p>
<p>Strategy one is get into massive rehabilitation mode.</p>
<p>The problem is, most of these people have never built or run a company.</p>
<p>So they have no idea how to rehabilitate anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, market momentum folks, and in that they were excellent, but in actually</p>
<p>helping CEOs build and rebuild a business, I think that they&rsquo;re not as well suited doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean they can&rsquo;t do it, but they&rsquo;re not as well suited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pathway.</p>
<p>But I think that path is very painful.</p>
<p>And it requires you to take medicine to bitter medicine, which is to basically mark your</p>
<p>portfolio down 50 or 60%.</p>
<p>Just like the public market, terminal valuations have gone down.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to basically raise enough money to do, for example, unpriced</p>
<p>converts into those same companies so that you don&rsquo;t have to remark so that the auditors</p>
<p>will be allowed to carry these fake valuations, you can maybe mark it down 10 or 15%.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to mark it down 50 or 60%.</p>
<p>And hope the market returns to his previous state.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ve all talked about, that previous state is probably unreliable, because it was</p>
<p>a moment where we had a global pandemic where we took rates to zero, and we printed nine</p>
<p>or $10 trillion of excess liquidity that inflated these things.</p>
<p>So I got to think that, you know, prices in 2019 were a little bit ticking up 2020 were</p>
<p>really ticking up 2021 was egregious and 2022 is the is, you know, where it all comes home</p>
<p>to roost.</p>
<p>So, Brad, explain to us, we hear free cash flow, we hear income, net income, EBITDA,</p>
<p>we hear all these terms now free cash flow is what everybody is focused on.</p>
<p>I believe that seems to be the predominant rallying cry and a lot of public market companies</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Can you explain to people what the difference between these things are?</p>
<p>Because people kind of bundle them together?</p>
<p>Why would somebody like Dara at Uber?</p>
<p>say, hey, you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking about adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA, income, net income,</p>
<p>all this stuff.</p>
<p>But free cash flow is what we want to focus on now.</p>
<p>Or is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and our friend Bill Gurley, rails on this adjusted adjusted and, you know, look</p>
<p>to your left, look to your right adjusted one more time EBITDA, right?</p>
<p>Like in markets like this, what people want to know are what&rsquo;s the green stuff I can take</p>
<p>out of the business and put under my mattress, free cash flow, distributable free cash flow.</p>
<p>And not only that, how much per share, I think the single biggest issue growth investors</p>
<p>are focused on today is the easy way out for all these companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll tap down a little bit on their hiring.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll tap down on their spend, but out of the back door, they want to give a bunch of</p>
<p>free stock to employees to help offset that pain.</p>
<p>This is really important to understand because stock is a real expense, right?</p>
<p>When a company goes public, the more shares you have, the lower your price.</p>
<p>So it is a real expense to everybody, the founders, the employees, the investors, right?</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s what I think the single biggest conversation going on in boardrooms in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley today is, hey, can we have a little bit more stock this year, whether it&rsquo;s options</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s outright RSUs to give to employees, because if we don&rsquo;t give it to employees,</p>
<p>they tell us they&rsquo;re going to leave.</p>
<p>This is a real hard truth.</p>
<p>I had a CEO of an incredible company call me and say, listen, we pay our engineers a</p>
<p>million bucks ahead, but we give them stock that over the last five years has been worth</p>
<p>another million dollars each year.</p>
<p>So they built their lives as though they had $2 million a year in income.</p>
<p>They bought a house, they bought cars, they sent their kids to private schools based upon</p>
<p>that $2 million.</p>
<p>And now when we tell them that this upcoming year, we&rsquo;re not making whole on that million.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be when we win, you win, and when we lose, you win.</p>
<p>So the tough conversation is we&rsquo;re not re-upping you because the stock&rsquo;s been cut in half.</p>
<p>And so now that engineer is saying, yeah, but this year that means I&rsquo;m only getting</p>
<p>paid $1.2 million.</p>
<p>And the answer, the tough answer is yes, right?</p>
<p>Shared sacrifice.</p>
<p>You should have never assumed that that was going to be worth an incremental million dollars</p>
<p>a year.</p>
<p>But that takes leadership, that takes courage, that takes a board that knows what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing to explain that over the full arc of that employment.</p>
<p>And the first thing the mercenary employee says is, well, I&rsquo;ll just go work somewhere</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And the right answer for a good leader is okay.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your approach to this business, then you need to go work somewhere else.</p>
<p>I mean, you just did a great test, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great filter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a mercenary, and you were with us when we&rsquo;re up, but you&rsquo;re not with us when we have</p>
<p>to take some austerity measures.</p>
<p>Is this the end of entitlement across the board, Sax?</p>
<p>I mean, we had an entitlement class.</p>
<p>Everybody thought they could raise a VC fund.</p>
<p>Everybody thought they would have 100% IRR because they would just buy NFTs and flip</p>
<p>crypto projects that had no released product.</p>
<p>And the same with employees.</p>
<p>They just thought, I can just keep raising my salary X amount.</p>
<p>And now it looks like Apple said everybody comes back to work three days a week.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t see a lot of people quitting Apple because there may not be another option.</p>
<p>And maybe a lot of the firings that are occurring, I&rsquo;m thinking of Cameo here, had top three</p>
<p>of their top like six or seven leaders leave.</p>
<p>I interpreted that as maybe they had really big comp packages.</p>
<p>And when they did the layoffs, they said, you know what, the number twos in these positions</p>
<p>can get the job done for a third of the price.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s better for the business.</p>
<p>So is this the end of austerity, the end of entitlement?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Or a lot of it.</p>
<p>There was a great article here that came out recently about Netflix, where Netflix, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finally getting real about their woke entitled employee problem.</p>
<p>And this is in the New York Post, but there are many other newspapers that covered it.</p>
<p>Basically, it says here, Netflix tells woke workers to quit if they&rsquo;re offended.</p>
<p>If you find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place</p>
<p>for you, said the memo.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just sick of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not going to put up with it anymore.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sick of being held hostage by their employees who think that they can kind of</p>
<p>muscle the leaders of the company by starting a petition or boycott campaign every time</p>
<p>they want to drive the company in a certain direction.</p>
<p>And so I think companies are finally figuring out this is the only way to react to basically</p>
<p>being held hostage.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, quit.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have seven, eight job offers, you know, and recruiters calling you constantly</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s on a hiring freeze, well, then maybe people will appreciate the contract</p>
<p>of I work for you, you give me money, and then everything else is superfluous.</p>
<p>On that note, did anybody see the Ricky Gervais Netflix special yet?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s on Netflix, it&rsquo;s on Netflix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I mean, Dave Chappelle, you know, in terms of bravery, Ricky Gervais was like, I&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>made my money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m burning the whole building down.</p>
<p>I mean, he went full equal opportunist.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think the trans issue became like 10 or 20% of the of his latest special.</p>
<p>So it does seem like the comedians are saying, you know what, we&rsquo;re gonna make jokes, make</p>
<p>jokes about everybody.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna buy into this, you can&rsquo;t cancel us, we&rsquo;re just gonna keep making jokes, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna keep making money.</p>
<p>And that whole concept that, you know, people are going to be held hostage, I think is over</p>
<p>independent of what you think of making jokes of, you know, various marginalized or smaller</p>
<p>groups of people.</p>
<p>Can we just go back to something Brad said a while back about how Manchin saved the Democratic</p>
<p>Party?</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s actually an interesting point there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, such notorious right wingers as Jeff Bezos have said something very similar lately</p>
<p>when you see that where Biden tried to blame billionaires for the inflation and Bezos was</p>
<p>having none of it.</p>
<p>He said, no, listen, it&rsquo;s not because of us or our companies, because you printed too</p>
<p>much money.</p>
<p>And Joe Biden, or he said, Manchin saved you from yourself, because it would have been</p>
<p>another $4 trillion of spending on top of all the other trillions of spending that we</p>
<p>had last year.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely the case that if the administration was left to its own devices, remember, they</p>
<p>were touting back in December, they were touting the idea that this $4 trillion of Build Back</p>
<p>Better spending would somehow be the cure to inflation.</p>
<p>Even if they had poured that gasoline onto the fire.</p>
<p>I mean, we would go to 20% inflation, we might have had a currency, you know, like a serious</p>
<p>currency issue.</p>
<p>No, Chamath.</p>
<p>But let me just finish the point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to just make a partisan point here.</p>
<p>I want to there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a serious economics point here with learning.</p>
<p>I hope our policymakers learn from this, which is what happened over the last couple of years,</p>
<p>we had $10 trillion of money printing, right?</p>
<p>Why do they do that?</p>
<p>Because they thought that they could stimulate our way out of this COVID recession that they</p>
<p>had induced with lockdowns.</p>
<p>In any event, the point is, they thought they could stimulate economic activity by printing</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>And maybe cynically, politically, they thought it&rsquo;d be good for them in the midterms.</p>
<p>What actually happened?</p>
<p>That $10 trillion goes into the economy, but there&rsquo;s no corresponding increase in the output</p>
<p>of goods and services.</p>
<p>So two things happen.</p>
<p>First, price levels rise, and we get inflation.</p>
<p>And second, we get an asset bubble in the stock market.</p>
<p>And then the way both those things sort of come crashing down to earth is the Fed looks</p>
<p>at this inflation and suddenly has to jack up interest rates.</p>
<p>That pops the asset bubble, it vaporizes something like 14% of global wealth.</p>
<p>And then simultaneously, workers feel a lot poorer, because their wages haven&rsquo;t kept up</p>
<p>with inflation.</p>
<p>So this whole idea that you can just print money as a way to create wealth and prosperity,</p>
<p>I hope we take away from this, I think, recession that we&rsquo;re going into, is that is not a viable</p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p>The only thing that creates wealth in a society is the output of goods and services that people</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>And you just can&rsquo;t try to sort of play games with that by creating phantom, this sort of</p>
<p>phantom money that doesn&rsquo;t represent a real increase in good services or productivity.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard for people not to take this all as partisan.</p>
<p>But if you just look at the objective facts, the last two administrations have printed</p>
<p>money like drunken sailors.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a mess right now.</p>
<p>You can divorce yourself from any conception that this is partisan.</p>
<p>Trump spent a shit ton of money.</p>
<p>And so did Biden, and who&rsquo;s more qualified than Trump and Biden, Elon, Bezos, the people</p>
<p>who appear on this podcast, we have much more of a pulse on what&rsquo;s happening in the actual</p>
<p>real economy and in entrepreneurship and capital allocating than these people.</p>
<p>And I love the fact that now, you know, Bezos is a shit poster, he just doesn&rsquo;t get he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re having like an honest discussion now, right?</p>
<p>One of the one of the areas where I don&rsquo;t think Elon gets enough credit is when he explains</p>
<p>macroeconomics.</p>
<p>I think he actually really understands the what an economy is.</p>
<p>I mean, an economy is basically a trading system for the production of goods and services.</p>
<p>If you were to go this point he&rsquo;s made, if you were to go to a desert island, and somebody</p>
<p>just gives you a billion dollars, when you&rsquo;re sitting there on that island, you can&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>What makes you wealthier, what makes you wealthier is the production of goods and services</p>
<p>that people want.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately what an economy is.</p>
<p>Money is just the accounting system, the dollars is the accounting system.</p>
<p>If you start printing lots of money, all you&rsquo;re doing is debasing the accounting system, it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make anyone richer.</p>
<p>And yet, you know, the way that conversations around economics really take place, the only</p>
<p>thing you ever hear about is stimulating demand, you never really hear anything about production.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is an old debate that goes back to the 1980s about, you know, supply</p>
<p>side economics, but regardless of what you call it, wealth ultimately comes from our</p>
<p>capacity to produce goods and services that people want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Chamath, all of this adds up to companies and the government&rsquo;s balance sheet becoming</p>
<p>tighter and more efficient.</p>
<p>So the talent diffusion across the industry, perhaps everybody being entitled and getting</p>
<p>paid, people not wanting to go to work, people who have jobs not wanting to go to the office,</p>
<p>all of this seems to have actually reversed in three months.</p>
<p>So this medicine we&rsquo;re taking, we stopped eating the bad food, we started working out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting better sleep, this is going to turn around for the companies that take</p>
<p>the medicine, the management teams, the capital allocators who do the hard work and sharpen</p>
<p>their pencils, as we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>This will all result in a more efficient and vibrant economy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think for the most part, I think there&rsquo;s still going to continue to be examples of</p>
<p>folks who basically run themselves into a brick wall because they don&rsquo;t want to make</p>
<p>the hard decisions that is going to be more exaggerated in Silicon Valley, because we</p>
<p>have a culture of tolerance.</p>
<p>And we have an economic business model that supports kind of irresponsible decision making</p>
<p>and supports poor governance.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve said this many times, but a fund&rsquo;s job ultimately is to make a very important</p>
<p>decision about whether they truly care about generating massive returns or whether the</p>
<p>fee income becomes so meaningful so as to drown out every other incentive that they</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>And I think by and large in Silicon Valley, if you track all of the increased frequency</p>
<p>and fundraising, you can also probably follow those dollars and they generally will be the</p>
<p>most poorly run.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be held the least accountable.</p>
<p>And I think those will have the largest negative outcomes.</p>
<p>And then instead, if you follow the dollars of the the real practitioners who have discipline,</p>
<p>they look kind of sheepish and silly for years in the middle of a rally.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re the ones that are able to really reset and help some of these few companies</p>
<p>really win.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;re going to go through that cycle over the next four or five years.</p>
<p>And so you know, I think it&rsquo;s super well said Schmuth because I have felt at or I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>made to feel silly by some folks who said, Why are you asking to do diligence?</p>
<p>Why do you want to have a board seat?</p>
<p>Why do you want to talk to customers?</p>
<p>Why are you asking for month by month revenue made a sub economic decision like the idea</p>
<p>that over the last four or five years you optimized for anything except the market beta</p>
<p>was kind of dumb, you know, and it&rsquo;s and and the worst thing that you could have done in</p>
<p>that period was confuse alpha and beta, meaning alpha is what you are able to do because of</p>
<p>your discrete skill versus anybody else.</p>
<p>Beta is when just the market goes up, said differently.</p>
<p>You could take any NBA player and put them on a high school basketball team.</p>
<p>And they would be the you know, college player of the year, any single one.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beta.</p>
<p>Yeah, it can be the MVP of the NBA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s alpha.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of folks were made to feel very silly or, you know, a downer</p>
<p>or a wet blanket in these last few years, who will probably have the last laugh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been unbelievable, Brad, to watch the changing of attitudes and the entitlement</p>
<p>in fundraising and private markets in the last 60 days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been even more pronounced in the last 30 I literally have people we talked</p>
<p>to last month, who had really crazy expectations, they&rsquo;ve come down by 50%.</p>
<p>They wanted 50.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re at 25.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want board seats.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re okay with board seats, information rights, they were fighting against information</p>
<p>rights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s a hill to die on.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like information rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our CFOs email, we need to get money in the doors.</p>
<p>So I guess what&rsquo;s the silver lining here does seem to me as a great setup right now.</p>
<p>Jason, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I go to Brad, like, and then you&rsquo;re forgetting one other key thing in the in the race to</p>
<p>raise all of this money.</p>
<p>What did these folks do?</p>
<p>They hired these mid level kids as partners into their venture firms and gave them money</p>
<p>to put into companies.</p>
<p>What are these people know?</p>
<p>No mentoring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it disparagingly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, what do they know?</p>
<p>How do they know how to actually invest?</p>
<p>investing is just not you see it, you just say, Okay, well, I think it sounds cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are some of those younger folks who are going to turn out to be all stars in there.</p>
<p>You just like in the NBA, and they&rsquo;re gonna be some that, you know, prove to be right</p>
<p>in the beta.</p>
<p>Let me answer Jason&rsquo;s question, because, you know, maybe end on a on a note of optimism.</p>
<p>You know, in some countries, you know, notably China right now, they&rsquo;re doing a lot to prop</p>
<p>up a bunch of companies that should be allowed to fail.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about free market capitalism, the creative destruction, the</p>
<p>cycle time on creative destruction in this country has never been faster.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it.</p>
<p>If you took money at a valuation over a billion dollars, okay, last year, you&rsquo;re not that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a venture capital bet.</p>
<p>I call it quasi public, right?</p>
<p>You stepped into the bigs and you said, I will deliver this plan.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t deliver the plan, there&rsquo;s not going to be a lot of tolerance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be tolerance for just giving away a bunch of more stock.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be tolerance for no course correction, right?</p>
<p>Maybe in seed or series A, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tolerance because you sign up to a lot of unpredictability.</p>
<p>But the level of tolerance that you&rsquo;ll see out of late stage growth investors is going</p>
<p>to be akin to what they do with a public company that runs them off a cliff.</p>
<p>You know how that is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on those earning calls.</p>
<p>So I think this is going to shine a light on the bifurcation that we really have.</p>
<p>We call all of this venture capital.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is, series C and before is venture.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re stepping into the bigs and taking money at a billion, two billions, the expectations</p>
<p>are different.</p>
<p>Your access to capital will be different.</p>
<p>The expected course correction will be different, right?</p>
<p>But I take it as a sign of strength that we&rsquo;re going to work through this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have the private markets are absolutely going to go through a reset.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll get through it and the winners will win and those who failed a course correct</p>
<p>and want to fly into the wall will do that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get on with the next generation of incredible entrepreneurs solving big problems.</p>
<p>The secular curve of technology solving big problems has never been steeper, right?</p>
<p>And the cycles that overlay that secular curve are not suspended.</p>
<p>We have not suspended wars.</p>
<p>We have not suspended economic cycles.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to have to get through this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening in record pace.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s an interesting point.</p>
<p>Let me ask Brad a question about that, which is what&rsquo;s the potential here for more of like</p>
<p>a V-shaped recession where, to your point, the market&rsquo;s correct more rapidly and violently</p>
<p>than ever, snap, issues a new forecast down 40%.</p>
<p>Is there a possibility that this thing gets resolved in, say, six months?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that valuation levels are ever back to where they were in the second</p>
<p>half of 2021.</p>
<p>But in six months, could we have sort of done this big reset, washed out a lot of the problems?</p>
<p>And again, valuations are not back, but the capital markets become unfrozen and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>back to a more normal operating environment.</p>
<p>As opposed to, say, like more of a U, where we&rsquo;re kind of bouncing around the bottoms</p>
<p>here in this volatile state for about 18 months, and then it&rsquo;s more like the dot-com crash</p>
<p>would come out of it in two years.</p>
<p>I see smart people on both sides of this.</p>
<p>I hear Jason Lemkin&rsquo;s been saying, I think this is kind of short, deep, sweet, six-month</p>
<p>reset.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson just wrote 18 months at least.</p>
<p>I think Sequoia is saying two years.</p>
<p>I think our instinct is 18 months to two years.</p>
<p>But what do you think the possibility is that we could be in a more normal environment in</p>
<p>six months?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s separate public markets and venture markets, because venture markets, as you know,</p>
<p>have a six to 12-month lag just in terms of the reset.</p>
<p>But I would say, you know, the future is a distribution of probable outcomes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a downside case, an upside case, and a base case.</p>
<p>I think the base case is by this fall, we&rsquo;ll have very good evidence, right, of where inflation</p>
<p>is rolling over.</p>
<p>I think it is rolling over.</p>
<p>What the Fed is likely to do, the upward bound on interest rates.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll be at a point where we can start underwriting to the five-year average</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq today are still 30 percent above where</p>
<p>they were in January of 2020.</p>
<p>30 percent above where they were in January 2020.</p>
<p>How much better is the world today than where it was in January 2020?</p>
<p>Well, I think what the market is saying is that we&rsquo;ve grown the economy on a nominal</p>
<p>basis about 15 percent during that time.</p>
<p>And earnings have about doubled, right?</p>
<p>The earnings margins of those companies have about doubled.</p>
<p>So you would expect, normal course and trajectory, maybe that those companies would be 30 percent</p>
<p>more valuable.</p>
<p>The problem is, as we look ahead, to Chamath&rsquo;s point, the earnings are likely to come down.</p>
<p>Profit margins are being squeezed.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a decent argument.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more pain to come in the public markets that we haven&rsquo;t seen the bottom.</p>
<p>However, I do think that the Fed is taking a good course here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we have runaway inflation.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re going to have an investable environment come this fall.</p>
<p>However, I think for venture, there&rsquo;s a six to a 12-month lag to that.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;ve got to add it to those six months to really get to the market clearing</p>
<p>prices for all these companies.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s incumbent upon all of us to give really good feedback today.</p>
<p>And I see a lot of it, right, to entrepreneurs about making that course correction.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re only turning the plane 10 degrees when they see lightning dead ahead, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making a huge mistake.</p>
<p>The default action by every founder today should be a 90-degree course correction unless</p>
<p>they have very good idiosyncratic reason in that business in terms of their outperformance</p>
<p>to stay the course.</p>
<p>Plan for the worst, hope for the best.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you could even bifurcate the companies in private markets to ones that have strong</p>
<p>product market fit and the ones that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of companies, to David&rsquo;s point, that were getting Series Bs without product</p>
<p>market fit.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one thing to get your Series A when you have this like weak product market</p>
<p>fit and a great story.</p>
<p>But when you start seeing Series Bs happening on momentum, it&rsquo;s like, that to me is going</p>
<p>to be impossible to resolve.</p>
<p>That company has to go to zero or has to reset or even give money back to founders.</p>
<p>Those are really the three things I would see as a true bottom, like the really dark</p>
<p>moment where people have two or three liquidation preferences, people reset comp and tell people,</p>
<p>listen, we&rsquo;re going to cut comp 30% across the board for management.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, leave.</p>
<p>And then finally, people saying, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to give the 60 cents on</p>
<p>the dollar back to investors.</p>
<p>Those are the three things I saw during the two downturns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying something that I think is also important that&rsquo;s not really talked about,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of really good companies with really horrible</p>
<p>capital structures, really terrible cap tables, really bad valuations, really big overhangs</p>
<p>of preference stock that are going to have to get worked out.</p>
<p>And in getting that worked out, going back to what Brad said, the person that course</p>
<p>corrects 90 degrees will win.</p>
<p>And the reason they&rsquo;ll win may not even be because they&rsquo;re being that courageous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just being less stupid than everybody else, quite honestly.</p>
<p>Because you have to remember, in most of these markets over the last four or five years,</p>
<p>we funded four or five versions of every imaginable company.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be two winners, 70 and 30%.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really only going to be one winner.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s going to be a marginal second kind of also ran that captures some value.</p>
<p>And everybody else is not that valuable.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s roughly been true.</p>
<p>But the reason we were able to support that was that every company look kind of interesting,</p>
<p>anyone with traction could be, you know, competed against because the only differentiator at</p>
<p>the time was very cheap money that was effectively free, and it was flowing in, you know, faster</p>
<p>than you could count.</p>
<p>So all of that has to get sorted out.</p>
<p>So I just think that that those dynamics shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>And so you know, again, hard work to I mean, to the thing we&rsquo;ve been saying here, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard work for a board and founders to do this.</p>
<p>But what choice do you have?</p>
<p>Well, the problem is the much more sophisticated markets like the debt markets, which I would</p>
<p>say are much more sophisticated, okay, cutthroat, liquid, covenants.</p>
<p>When you see the people that make the money, two things are true.</p>
<p>Number one is they&rsquo;re incredibly sharp elbowed and number two is they make money in moments</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If you look at Apollo&rsquo;s great returns, or Blackstone&rsquo;s great returns or cerebrus, you</p>
<p>know, these folks were the you know, they really were the barbarians at the gates.</p>
<p>And they made all the money in moments of true dislocation.</p>
<p>If you apply that construct here, you know, we&rsquo;ve never had to go through a period where</p>
<p>there are some real terms and conditions attached to the incremental dollar.</p>
<p>And I think that if that does come to pass in Silicon Valley, you&rsquo;re just going to have</p>
<p>a reckoning and I think that that what it will really do is just sort out the winners</p>
<p>and the losers and it&rsquo;ll sort out the folks that were able to get to default or close</p>
<p>to default alive, or at least default life support.</p>
<p>Saks default investable, default investable.</p>
<p>I like that one, too.</p>
<p>I mean, Saks made a great tweet, he basically said it&rsquo;s not default alive or dead, investable</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an even finer filter.</p>
<p>Well, default default alive is fantastic.</p>
<p>If you can get there basically just means cash flow positive.</p>
<p>I mean, all default alive means is that your cash flow positive or you&rsquo;re going to be cash</p>
<p>flow positive based on the money you have in the you don&rsquo;t need money.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need money.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the best place to be is you don&rsquo;t need money.</p>
<p>But I think for early stage companies, that&rsquo;s almost an impossible standard.</p>
<p>It takes time to get to the point of being cash flow positive.</p>
<p>So therefore, I was trying to propose a standard that I thought was more actionable for founders</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t impossible.</p>
<p>And I call it default investable, which is here are the metrics that you need, at least</p>
<p>I can tell you what they are in the SaaS world.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what great metrics look like, here&rsquo;s what good metrics look like, here&rsquo;s some danger</p>
<p>zone metrics.</p>
<p>And you need, you know, out of the five key metrics, you really need three or four great</p>
<p>ones and one or two good ones to raise in this environment and no dangerous metrics.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have those, you need to give yourself the time to fix the problems in your</p>
<p>business to get to those metrics.</p>
<p>On that note, you know, Sequoia had a really good chart called Survival of the Quickest</p>
<p>that illustrates this concept of giving yourself time.</p>
<p>And I threw it in the chat.</p>
<p>But basically, what it shows is there&rsquo;s a green line and an orange line.</p>
<p>The green line is the company that realizes in May of 2022 that we&rsquo;ve gone into a very</p>
<p>different environment.</p>
<p>And they slash their burn in half, and they basically double their runway.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other company that just keeps going along the same path they were</p>
<p>at until they realize, oh, wait a second, you know, and then, you know, some point in</p>
<p>the future, they realize there&rsquo;s been a change.</p>
<p>They make a small cut, they make another small cut, and they&rsquo;re always behind the eight ball.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this so many times before, that the company doesn&rsquo;t make cuts until they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>forced to.</p>
<p>And so they never really lengthen their runway.</p>
<p>And then when they finally do make the cuts, they go into a death spiral and die.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re over the Atlantic, and there&rsquo;s not enough fuel to get to a landing strip.</p>
<p>And you just plunge into the cold ocean and die.</p>
<p>Founders really have to think about the asymmetry of the risks that they face, right?</p>
<p>Which is, let&rsquo;s say that you cut too much, and the environment is better than you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>Well, you can always hire back.</p>
<p>At a lower price, in all likelihood.</p>
<p>I promise you&rsquo;ll be able to hire back, okay?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t cut enough, and the situation is worse than you think,</p>
<p>then you just die.</p>
<p>So this is why Andy Grove said, only the paranoid survive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to think about the downside risk and be more skewed towards the bad scenario</p>
<p>than sort of the sort of wishful thinking scenario.</p>
<p>David, just one final point here.</p>
<p>You know, because we have all these decks flying around now by venture capitalists telling</p>
<p>founders to go make these really tough decisions.</p>
<p>Being a little self-reflective, where were we all six months ago?</p>
<p>Where were we in October when we were putting more money in and they were hiring like crazy?</p>
<p>Where were we in November, right?</p>
<p>I remember some of the conversations that we were having.</p>
<p>But I look, I posted in chat, layoffs.fyi, right?</p>
<p>The number one company on that list, get here, Sequoia Company, okay?</p>
<p>Are they making a course correction?</p>
<p>You bet your ass they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re laying off 4,500 people, 15% of the workforce.</p>
<p>The second company on that list, Lacework, an altimeter software company that&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>terrific, growing hundreds of percent, laying off 300 people, 20%, right?</p>
<p>A 90 degrees turn of the plane, right?</p>
<p>That company will never need cash again, but it&rsquo;s not just flying toward the lightning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the tough decisions because that&rsquo;s what leaders do in businesses that</p>
<p>are even good businesses.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies that are shit businesses that should be on this list, but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bumbling along and not making the tough decisions.</p>
<p>We need venture capitalists that instead of, you know, this being a popularity contest,</p>
<p>venture capitalists need to look inside as well and say, what about our firm?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t we issuing these course corrections and telling people to tap the brakes a little</p>
<p>bit when we knew markets were overheated last year, right?</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a lot of responsibility that sits on both sides of the table, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, there&rsquo;s 714 startups on this list.</p>
<p>By the time we&rsquo;re done, there are going to be at least 3,000 startups on that list.</p>
<p>Add a zero, add a zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another reason I say the Fed is getting what it wants, right?</p>
<p>This labor market is, you know, is cooling down very quickly, at least in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, and the fact that people felt like they didn&rsquo;t need to take a job and they</p>
<p>could live off credit and there would always be jobs for them.</p>
<p>I think people are going to have to rethink, like, can I be fun ployed forever?</p>
<p>And you know, do I need to take my career seriously during to pay down my debt?</p>
<p>Do I need to have a balanced balance sheet?</p>
<p>My personal balance sheet needs to be in order as well.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what individual workers need to think about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Brad&rsquo;s right that there&rsquo;s certainly enough blame to go around in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And you know, VCs bought into these frothy valuation levels last year.</p>
<p>To some degree, we&rsquo;re all gaslit by the Fed and these low interest rate policies.</p>
<p>I wrote my post about burn multiple and how to measure capital efficiency two years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting a lot more retweets now than it did back then.</p>
<p>But look, do VCs have some self-reflecting to do?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of tweets going around basically saying, like, people</p>
<p>objecting to this advice on the ground.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll hear something like, if you VCs wanted us to operate more efficiently, then</p>
<p>you should have invested more efficiently.</p>
<p>Or if you wanted us to be disciplined, you should have been more disciplined in investing.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s kind of missing the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cutting off your nose to spite your face.</p>
<p>The reason we&rsquo;re giving this advice is because we just want our companies to survive and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want a zero.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want a zero.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through multiple down cycles.</p>
<p>And the truth of the matter is, unless you&rsquo;ve been in the business world for over 14 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never been through a down cycle.</p>
<p>I mean, that means that, you know, no founder under the age of what, like 36 has even seen</p>
<p>a down cycle before.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what it can be like when you go into a two year nuclear winter.</p>
<p>They probably weren&rsquo;t the pilots at that time anyway.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like people who are 40, 45 have the scar tissue because they were in the pilot</p>
<p>seat.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So the reason you&rsquo;re hearing all these VCs all of a sudden say, get more disciplined</p>
<p>is mainly because we&rsquo;ve seen this movie before and we don&rsquo;t want our companies to run out</p>
<p>of money and die.</p>
<p>I think you can safely short, if you could, the stock of all of these rando peanut gallery</p>
<p>CEOs tweeting their disdain on Twitter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re right, that would be a great index index down, fixing stuff.</p>
<p>Just write that company to zero.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just turn your fucking Twitter and just sharpen your pencils.</p>
<p>We would be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t talk about, at least for this last segment about the tragedy</p>
<p>in Uvalde, Uvalde, Texas, 80 miles west of San Antonio on Tuesday, 19 elementary kids</p>
<p>to adults were murdered.</p>
<p>How are we going to talk about this without losing our shit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I think maybe the roadmap, I did give this a lot of thought.</p>
<p>I was like, why, why is this first segment on the market trundling along on fucking life</p>
<p>support for an hour and 10 minutes?</p>
<p>And I think part of it is because none of us can really talk about this without losing</p>
<p>our cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And, but I do think we did good work.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the good work we did in the episode of Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>And we actually came to a point where we said, you know, here are the extreme positions.</p>
<p>And then you were like, Hey, wait a second.</p>
<p>I found this data point.</p>
<p>And we actually figured out, Hey, 80% of people want this definition of abortion in</p>
<p>the United States.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll throw it to you, Chamath, you know, we&rsquo;re all outraged, we&rsquo;re all frustrated,</p>
<p>but maybe we could start there.</p>
<p>Is there a consensus of what could be accomplished here that you&rsquo;ve come to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to think about it a whole bunch, but you know, we&rsquo;re all outraged.</p>
<p>We could all yell and scream here, but a path forward is where my mind goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you what I have been thinking about.</p>
<p>This is just a random stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>I think that the Democrats will not make any progress because they try to make this, unfortunately,</p>
<p>a moral virtue signaling issue.</p>
<p>The Republicans will not make any progress because they become sort of very binary, adamant</p>
<p>absolutists about constitutional rights and the interpretation of that right in a very</p>
<p>specific way.</p>
<p>The truth is in the middle.</p>
<p>You know, if you go back before we talk about Uvalde, Peyton Jondron, who was the kid that</p>
<p>shot up a Topps supermarket in Buffalo and killed umpteen, you know, black shoppers,</p>
<p>lived in a state where there was a red flag law.</p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t understand what red flag laws are, David, you know, tweeted some stuff</p>
<p>about it as well, but essentially it allows a community member or a family member or a</p>
<p>school teacher or a police officer to essentially put a restraining order around an individual</p>
<p>that they think could cause harm and use that as a way to confiscate their weapons.</p>
<p>People have talked about red flag laws as being possible while he lived in a state.</p>
<p>The kid was, you know, put under a psych hold, you know, a year ago and it all just falls</p>
<p>through the cracks.</p>
<p>Now, you know, Ted Cruz or somebody else said, let&rsquo;s spend $10 billion and only have one</p>
<p>door into a school and put an armed guard there.</p>
<p>Well then you find out that Uvalde, you know, doubled their security spend over the last</p>
<p>two or three years.</p>
<p>They actually had a person that may or may not have just kind of like stepped to the</p>
<p>side or something to let them in.</p>
<p>The police, according to the AP, showed up and stood around for 40 minutes before they</p>
<p>were able to actually breach the school.</p>
<p>You know, so much so that the quote in the AP article was that there was a parent that</p>
<p>tried to get other parents to, for 40 minutes they were standing there.</p>
<p>You know, in California you have, you know, very restrictive measures, but we&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>you know, in San Bernardino and other places, we&rsquo;ve had mass shootings here as well because</p>
<p>the guns can just get transported across state lines and there&rsquo;s no real way to stop this.</p>
<p>The NRA, I find out, just so if you guys are interested, Mitt Romney took $13.6 million</p>
<p>from the NRA.</p>
<p>This is the moral finger wagger of the Republican side who, you know, last time I checked is</p>
<p>a multi-centi millionaire, but somehow still needs to take $13 million from these folks.</p>
<p>Rich Burr took $7 million, Roy Blunt $4.5 million, Tom Tillis $4.4 million, Cory Gardner</p>
<p>$4 million, Marco Rubio $3.3 million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no effective counter lobby that says, how about we have a more moderate and restrained</p>
<p>pro-gun set of rights and field candidates on the left and the right that could, Jason,</p>
<p>find this middle ground.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we&rsquo;re in this two or three day period, it seems like, where folks will</p>
<p>get extreme and then nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one thing that I think we can all agree as well.</p>
<p>If you look at the underlying family situation of all of these mass shooters, there is a</p>
<p>really disturbing theme that I think is worth putting out there.</p>
<p>These are all universally young men, 18, 19 odd years old.</p>
<p>They come from broken families.</p>
<p>This individual, Salvatore Ramos, father was absent, again, according to the Times and</p>
<p>the Wall Street Journal article I read, mother, intermittent drug use issues, lived with the</p>
<p>grandmother.</p>
<p>Bullied.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unemployed, barely graduated, if graduated at all in high school.</p>
<p>They harbored these deep resentments towards women or minority groups.</p>
<p>They then project a lot of their frustration.</p>
<p>They were bullied potentially in high school growing up.</p>
<p>And all of the, they were posting all kinds of very challenging content.</p>
<p>You know, apparently this kid had a one TikTok of where he sat in a car with a dead cat in</p>
<p>a paper bag.</p>
<p>You know, he would post on Instagram of assault rifles and nothing happens.</p>
<p>So I just think that we have to acknowledge that there&rsquo;s a complete failure of our politicians.</p>
<p>And at this point, I think they should all be replaced writ large, every single one.</p>
<p>Nobody has added value to this solution is nobody has really tried to figure this out.</p>
<p>But then also like parents have to do something incrementally more from the perspective of</p>
<p>the community, because these kids are going to school with our kids.</p>
<p>The red flags are there.</p>
<p>The red flags are there.</p>
<p>So just one last thing.</p>
<p>And I said, I said, Brad, I said to my kids, when you interact with your friends, I just</p>
<p>want you to understand when you&rsquo;re on social media, and you encounter this content.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re never like either scared, or embarrassed or unsure enough to just show</p>
<p>somebody when this stuff is happening, so that you can let somebody with a little bit</p>
<p>more maturity and judgment try to figure out what to do, if anything at all.</p>
<p>But these communities are completely failing.</p>
<p>These kids as well.</p>
<p>Brad, you have something.</p>
<p>I would say that every fucking country on the planet has kids with mental health disorders.</p>
<p>But not every country on the planet has kids getting shot up in schools and supermarkets</p>
<p>and churches.</p>
<p>That is a unique feature of the system that we accept this system we created.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against guns.</p>
<p>You guys know I took my kids to a shooting range last weekend.</p>
<p>But the idea that we let, you know, assault weapons be sold in this country with no background</p>
<p>checks that we let assault rifles be sold in this country with no limits on magazine</p>
<p>sizes that you can just replace magazines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s total insanity, right?</p>
<p>So I think this is a country that does a lot to self-help, but we are not self-helping</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>When we look at the assassination attempt of Ronald Reagan, amazingly, Republicans found</p>
<p>their voice and they said, let&rsquo;s have an assault ban on assault weapons or let&rsquo;s have a ban</p>
<p>on assault weapons that expired.</p>
<p>And we as I asked my analysts, I said, plot the number of shootings since the expiration</p>
<p>of that ban.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>And it should be something that we just like, don&rsquo;t accept like the middle ground, Jason.</p>
<p>I saw what you tweeted.</p>
<p>There is an obvious middle ground, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about whether it&rsquo;s background checks that Steve Kerr, I mean, he&rsquo;s gone viral feeling</p>
<p>the same way we all feel, but there are also technical solutions.</p>
<p>Why the hell do we let assault weapons?</p>
<p>Why not put a scrambling device on these weapons so that you can&rsquo;t fire them in schools and</p>
<p>churches?</p>
<p>If somebody says that&rsquo;s a breach of their second amendment rights, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not going to allow you to drive into the schoolyard with nuclear material.</p>
<p>There are some rational limits we can agree to.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think this is a partisan thing at this point in time.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s saying, you know, ban all guns.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In fact, I think there&rsquo;s a plurality among gun owners.</p>
<p>They too want reasonable limitations on these things, which are killing machines, not hunting</p>
<p>machines.</p>
<p>Sachs, any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I, so I think if we&rsquo;re looking for solutions, I think these red flag laws and</p>
<p>building on them is, is the way to go.</p>
<p>You know, the, the problem with, with background checks and I&rsquo;m not against them.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve gone through background checks to get, you know, my guns</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in favor of them, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have done anything to stop the Buffalo shooter.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the Buffalo shooter was in New York.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the toughest gun control laws in the nation.</p>
<p>The background check didn&rsquo;t stop him from getting the gun because he bought it lawfully,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a criminal record.</p>
<p>So, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t, that by itself isn&rsquo;t going to do it.</p>
<p>So I think where these red flag laws are useful is that we&rsquo;ve seen with these, all these school</p>
<p>shooters, they have a similar kind of profile, right?</p>
<p>They are disturbed young men, like in their, who are still school age, 18, 19, early twenties.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Now this shooter in Uvalde, I mean, there are reports coming out now that he had been</p>
<p>cutting his face, that he had aimed a BB gun at people.</p>
<p>So he was clearly idiating towards this idea of shooting people.</p>
<p>He had posted violent fantasies, basically of mass shootings on social media.</p>
<p>And he told his classmates he wanted to kill them.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a call for help here.</p>
<p>Almost always.</p>
<p>Same with the Buffalo shooting.</p>
<p>I mean, the people who these like psychos go to school with are the least surprised.</p>
<p>They all know because these people have been warning, they&rsquo;ve been saying that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do it.</p>
<p>So I think we have this problem of we&rsquo;ve got these young psychotic people.</p>
<p>And I think the reason why it happens young is when somehow they get into adulthood, whatever</p>
<p>this mental illness they&rsquo;ve got basically takes hold and they snap or they become psychotic</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take long for them to act on those fantasies, those violent fantasies.</p>
<p>So the simple solution here, I think, is to prevent those people from getting guns.</p>
<p>You know, if you threaten mass violence, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a gun.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an abridgment of second amendment rights</p>
<p>because look, felons can&rsquo;t get guns either.</p>
<p>If you commit a felony, you can&rsquo;t get a gun.</p>
<p>These people haven&rsquo;t committed a felony yet, but I don&rsquo;t want to wait until they do.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re if they have these kinds of red flags against them, then there should be a</p>
<p>way to file to basically get a protective order.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t let 12 year olds drive cars.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t let them drink beer, because we don&rsquo;t want 12 year olds drunk driving.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then at some point, there&rsquo;s a licensing that occurs.</p>
<p>I think a lot of this is framing.</p>
<p>I think it just is once again, very analogous to this abortion issue, where most people</p>
<p>are pro choice and want restrictions on abortion where they don&rsquo;t occur after a certain number</p>
<p>of weeks, just like Europe got to.</p>
<p>And I was just, you know, ideating on this.</p>
<p>And I think replacing the NRA, to your point, Chamath, they have funded people, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>become a key funding source for a lot of folks, and they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve been overfunded themselves.</p>
<p>What if we had Americans for reasonable gun safety, and we have this organization raise</p>
<p>a ton of money, and they just outbid the NRA for Republicans, and for people who are against</p>
<p>background checks?</p>
<p>And we just have a question.</p>
<p>But look, Mike Bloomberg started Everytown for gun control after Newtown, and it did</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t really had, I think, the impact that that we wanted.</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of it is cheap what you said.</p>
<p>So let me just give you my my little four bullet points here and have you react.</p>
<p>You are right that people are absolutists, no abortion, you know, no restrictions, and</p>
<p>no guns, or no restrictions on guns, background checks, we all agree on, make them more intense</p>
<p>and make them proportional to the caliber of the weapon.</p>
<p>If you want one of these weapons, why don&rsquo;t we have you go through a training course.</p>
<p>So for a pistol, you&rsquo;ve got a two hour training course for an AR 15, or something that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>powerful.</p>
<p>How about an eight hour course, a four hour course, then you could actually see the red</p>
<p>flags emerge.</p>
<p>And when somebody who has this red flag issue, go through that, the red flag law should be</p>
<p>national, and they should be very strong.</p>
<p>And then finally, what if we introduced insurance for certain classes of weapons, not all if</p>
<p>you want to get a rifle, you know, to go hunting or a pistol for self defense, maybe you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to have insurance.</p>
<p>Or maybe if you have one, you don&rsquo;t need to have insurance.</p>
<p>But once you get to high caliber, once you get to having clips that are a certain size,</p>
<p>what if we just had some basic insurance, because that would force then somebody to</p>
<p>underwrite the danger of that weapon.</p>
<p>I mean, look, the trick here is to figure out a system that has the least possible impact</p>
<p>on law abiding Americans, there&rsquo;s maybe a few 1000 of these mentally highly mentally</p>
<p>disturbed young men, but like I said, their schools know who they are.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And what we need is a process where, you know, that doesn&rsquo;t turn into the no fly list, where</p>
<p>all of a sudden, everybody&rsquo;s on it, or training or insurance, or content moderation or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>This is the problem.</p>
<p>Look, this is what the NRA is afraid of is that you create a red flag process.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, thousands or millions of people could be on it, right?</p>
<p>So you need a right, but that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Because you had you had this kid who could have been put on it in New York, he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>No, no, no, look, I think we need to I think we need to figure out how do you create due</p>
<p>process around this.</p>
<p>And I think I think if a school they know, I mean, you get multiple affidavits from a</p>
<p>teacher, they should be put on the list.</p>
<p>Yeah, school is a no brainer, a police officer isn&rsquo;t over isn&rsquo;t the problem isn&rsquo;t that these</p>
<p>these kids aren&rsquo;t identifiable.</p>
<p>Because as you say, David, they&rsquo;re hiding in plain sight in these schools.</p>
<p>The problem is that there&rsquo;s no mechanism or incentive for any of these kids, parents,</p>
<p>educators, teachers, community members to do something about it.</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t know what that something is.</p>
<p>And this is where these kids are left to fester, fester, fester, and then the end it</p>
<p>boils over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all of us that have to pay a collective price, David, can you see even worse than</p>
<p>that Chamath because in the Buffalo case, the Buffalo shooter was referred to for psychiatric</p>
<p>evaluation because they thought he did have mental illness.</p>
<p>And then they released him released after a weekend, and then he got the gun.</p>
<p>So he should have been put on a red flag list.</p>
<p>And that should have been the end of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a database like a federal database, which they&rsquo;re the NRA fights to.</p>
<p>I also want to say something about these technology companies.</p>
<p>There is an explicit decision that technology companies can make to be able to review content</p>
<p>from certain kinds of accounts and start to build a cluster and a distribution of risk.</p>
<p>It is possible I helped build one for one of these companies.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s not and I, I will not tolerate some non technical person telling</p>
<p>me it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>It is absolutely possible.</p>
<p>And these technology companies should have a mechanism to be able to say, you know what,</p>
<p>here are these 1000 accounts, David in the United States of these 1000 individuals that,</p>
<p>you know, are sort of getting to a red line here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And line whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s also it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not just going to be what they post on social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s although in both cases, Buffalo and Uvalde, they both posted that they were going to do</p>
<p>what they did.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, no, it&rsquo;s the breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Warning system, there&rsquo;s a warning system is a great idea with you&rsquo;ve all the the cops</p>
<p>were called out multiple times for violent disturbances, you know, and you combine that</p>
<p>with what he&rsquo;s telling people in the schools, and what he&rsquo;s posting on social media, you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s an identifiable profile here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one red flag is multiple red flags.</p>
<p>This is where these corporate social media companies need to take off all of this for</p>
<p>profit focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extreme at this point, be willing to degrade margins to hire the 10s of 1000s of</p>
<p>people to manually review content.</p>
<p>Okay, there should be a mechanism that allows these folks to plug into some system that</p>
<p>law enforcement can use.</p>
<p>There is an early warning system that can be built.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>layer.</p>
<p>Great idea.</p>
<p>human review before this stuff gets out of control, David to control people&rsquo;s individual</p>
<p>civil liberties, okay.</p>
<p>But that is a big step forward from where we are today, which is nothing.</p>
<p>There is zero leadership in America.</p>
<p>Can I just ask David one question, David, you used correctly pointed out, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>astute that we can&rsquo;t penalize people who are legally getting guns or create too much friction</p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>Would you consider training or insurance and just take each one individually for high capacity,</p>
<p>these deadly assault rifles?</p>
<p>Would you consider what would you consider each of those in terms of realistic, you know,</p>
<p>having some basic training, a four hour training class?</p>
<p>I mean, like, like you do for like you do for driving a car, should we have that for</p>
<p>assault rifles?</p>
<p>And then should insurance be required?</p>
<p>What training does is prevent accidental shootings.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against training.</p>
<p>I love training.</p>
<p>I do training.</p>
<p>But But look, what should be mandatory?</p>
<p>What training prevents is is accidental shootings, Buffalo and Uvalde and all these school shootings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actual shootings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going out there and killing as many people as possible.</p>
<p>And they know how to use these weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem is, is what their objectives are.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think training solves it.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>If you were in training for four hours, and you&rsquo;re an instructor, and you were trained</p>
<p>to look for red flags, and it prevented some friction from this person going and buying</p>
<p>it and doing the next day, wouldn&rsquo;t that help and then going to have to buy insurance?</p>
<p>The Buffalo shooter case this this grocery store for like four months.</p>
<p>I mean, they are patient.</p>
<p>They are methodical in how they go about it.</p>
<p>They would have gotten to the train.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t even necessarily need that filter, Jacob, because I&rsquo;m just telling you that the</p>
<p>profiles of these psychos, it&rsquo;s so dramatic.</p>
<p>When you go back and look, I mean, again, multiple red flags are killing animals.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to be beguns that they&rsquo;ve been the cops have been called out on them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re posting on social media, their classmates are all terrified of them.</p>
<p>Their own families are terrified of them.</p>
<p>Now, we just need to basically, we need an incentive to Jamal&rsquo;s point for schools, I</p>
<p>think, to create these profiles and file the right forms, the affidavits in the data.</p>
<p>Now do insurance for high capacity assault rifles.</p>
<p>Would you be in favor of and do you think it&rsquo;s a viable solution?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what that does.</p>
<p>Well, it means you would have to apply and say, Hey, I&rsquo;m Jason Calacanis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 18 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in this school, I would like to apply to own an AR 15.</p>
<p>And then some insurance company would say, Okay, you&rsquo;re 18 years old, you&rsquo;re a male,</p>
<p>you live in Texas, your bill is going to be $600 a year for this gun.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re a 45 year old male in Wyoming, your bill is going to be $100 for this, because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done some actuary tables on the actual risk.</p>
<p>Would you be in favor of insurance?</p>
<p>I think the key to solving this problem is to create the minimum disruption on law abiding</p>
<p>Americans.</p>
<p>Okay, 10s of millions of them who like to do insurance.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t know what that would do.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I want to stop the basically that I think what are a relatively small number of psychos</p>
<p>young psychos, maybe there&rsquo;s only a few 100 or a few 1000 sort of candidates in the entire</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want I don&rsquo;t want to wait for them to become felons to basically prevent them</p>
<p>from getting guns.</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a bunch of study about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of social science studies about the individuals that own guns legally</p>
<p>and those individuals that sort of break and commit these crimes.</p>
<p>And whether we want to admit it or not, there is a definable archetype.</p>
<p>It starts with gender, then their socio economic conditions, then there&rsquo;s, you know, home conditions.</p>
<p>These are knowable things.</p>
<p>These can be built into a combination of software and human review.</p>
<p>And we need to create incentives so that these kids can get some kind of help or intervention.</p>
<p>And the worst case is we kind of, you know, do something with them in a way that helps</p>
<p>us protect everybody.</p>
<p>Because sorry to interrupt, but we do this every day.</p>
<p>We turn this country on its head after September 11.</p>
<p>We started profiling everybody.</p>
<p>And this acts is like minimum standard of disrupting other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security disrupted everybody&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Take off your shoes, go through the security before you get on a plane.</p>
<p>We changed everything in months because we said we&rsquo;re under attack.</p>
<p>But there we&rsquo;re under attack by a foreign presence, a foreign terrorist presence.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re under attack by sick kids who need help.</p>
<p>OK, but we need to disrupt our lives.</p>
<p>We need to change things right in order to save these innocent kids who are being shot</p>
<p>up in schools where they&rsquo;re supposed to be safe.</p>
<p>And so I agree.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s profile them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get these companies doing their jobs, helping us identify these kids, get these</p>
<p>kids help.</p>
<p>But we need to raise the volume and raise the urgency in D.C. the way we did after September</p>
<p>11, 2001, that this is a national crisis as opposed to going back to the normal right</p>
<p>distribution here.</p>
<p>By the way, after 2011, I was on a no fly list.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve told you guys this story before, but I would have the triple S on my</p>
<p>boarding pass for years until about 2007 or 2008.</p>
<p>Constantly profiled, you know, put in the back room the whole nine yards.</p>
<p>But in the end, you know, did did it make me feel kind of like less than a lot of other</p>
<p>people?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think it was because I think it was the on the broad strokes, the right thing</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you would take a little friction.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if I needed to basically turn over all my kids, you know, social media</p>
<p>or there was a mechanism where, you know.</p>
<p>As much as we try to teach our kids, you know, all of these other things that that allow</p>
<p>us to make a socially progressive society, if the guidance counselor also sat around</p>
<p>and asked these kids anonymously, hey, is there anybody in your class you think needs</p>
<p>your help?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do that, too?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s there is friction because that that I think we&rsquo;re all willing to take because</p>
<p>the counterfactual is too horrible to bear.</p>
<p>And this is an example of one of those things.</p>
<p>Would you be in favor of insurance and training trauma?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think rifles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I think these are good ideas.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they will curb the issue.</p>
<p>I do think what David said is right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a level of evil or mental illness in these people that cause them to be incredibly</p>
<p>methodical.</p>
<p>And I think that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate.</p>
<p>So they would get through the insurance screen, they get to the training screen.</p>
<p>Well, I think I think, you know, look, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that drive cars without insurance,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you can drive a lot.</p>
<p>It can happen to be insured.</p>
<p>And, you know, so I think that those are good ideas, Jason.</p>
<p>Where it will falter is we have a political system where the primaries for both sides</p>
<p>are dictated by the looniest 10% of the left and the right.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got to vote in our primary makes practical gun control, just like abortion,</p>
<p>an impossible task, unless we completely turn our political class upside down on both sides</p>
<p>of the aisle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think these are good ideas.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I think parents have to do something because nobody&rsquo;s coming to</p>
<p>our aid.</p>
<p>And I think this the most important thing we can do is just say the truth out loud.</p>
<p>There is an identifiable archetype of these we should profile these kids, we should profile</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt there.</p>
<p>The politicians who are making this about lawful gun ownership.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not helping.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re actually hurting because you&rsquo;re activating millions of Americans who lawfully</p>
<p>own guns and believe in the Second Amendment to oppose reasonable measures, like, like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, hyper targeted measures, like these red flag laws, right.</p>
<p>And so if we make the whole issue about gun ownership, in general, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>get any reasonable changes.</p>
<p>The opposite the sales go up, the sales go up every time we have this happen.</p>
<p>My kids, and I&rsquo;m sure your kids as well, have now gone through multiple active shooter drills</p>
<p>in our school.</p>
<p>But at no point have my kids been sat down and taught some of the warning signs of their</p>
<p>fellow classmates and a mechanism to raise their hand and say, you know what, this is</p>
<p>actually really worrisome here.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that training.</p>
<p>They do have training on how to lock the door, how to flip a desk, how to go into a closet,</p>
<p>which is a horrible thing to have to teach a child.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re already there, I just say, take the extra step and teach the kids because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living on Instagram and tick tock every day.</p>
<p>They see their friends and their, you know, classmates every day.</p>
<p>And we need to start figuring out an early warning system because what is happening continues</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>These politicians are ineffective, they do nothing to help parents, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I like I like the early warning system, because you&rsquo;re right, like they&rsquo;re so first of all,</p>
<p>the red flag laws are something that&rsquo;s done on a state by state basis, something like</p>
<p>19 states have red flag laws, including New York, but it didn&rsquo;t work in New York, the</p>
<p>Buffalo shooter, because no one, no one used the system.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it has to be federal.</p>
<p>I just think that people actually, I think people just have to use the system.</p>
<p>So you had in the Buffalo shooter, the kid was referred for psychiatric treatment, and</p>
<p>they still didn&rsquo;t red flag him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just bonkers.</p>
<p>So people have to, the school systems have to learn how to use these laws.</p>
<p>And so to Jamal&rsquo;s point, we need an early warning system.</p>
<p>We need that translating into red flags that go on someone&rsquo;s record, and then they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>buy guns after that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really simple, at least till maybe they turn 30 or something.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, the problem is that about half the states don&rsquo;t have this mechanism.</p>
<p>And then the half that do aren&rsquo;t using it effectively enough.</p>
<p>I just shared with you guys a chart, the the the the most pernicious part of this debate,</p>
<p>and I think this is a pretty solid debate we had here.</p>
<p>So thank you to the gentleman for all participating in it.</p>
<p>Is every time we have one of these gun sales spike, if you look at the chart in the New</p>
<p>York Times, I just shared a Nick, you can you can share it on the YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Too many guns in the January after Obama&rsquo;s reelection, the Sandy Hook shooting, we hit</p>
<p>peak guns, obviously, during Coronavirus, people got scared and bought a bunch of guns.</p>
<p>After September 11, they bought a lot of guns.</p>
<p>But these moments are sadly going to drive because all the conversation is about banning</p>
<p>guns.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what we should be doing is preventing psychos from getting guns, known cycles, reasonable</p>
<p>gun control increased by 50% in the last 10 years, the last 10 years have been the</p>
<p>safest 10 years in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason, people feel the need to arm themselves more and more and more.</p>
<p>Now, I as an immigrant into this country, except the rules of the country that I come</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a constitution, there&rsquo;s a Second Amendment, I respect people&rsquo;s rights to own gun, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>held a gun by once in my life, I had a panic attack, and I had to put it down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not for me, okay.</p>
<p>But I respect your right to have them.</p>
<p>I think that we need to teach people how to think about the precursors before they get</p>
<p>the hold of these things.</p>
<p>Really sadly, what&rsquo;s killing our kids?</p>
<p>It turns out I just put a I just put the tweet in the chat for you guys to take a look at</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine, massive uptick.</p>
<p>Now gun deaths, combined, it&rsquo;s all gun deaths, includes gangs, includes suicide, and includes</p>
<p>mass shootings.</p>
<p>But firearm related deaths and injuries now exceeds motor vehicle crashes, and so does</p>
<p>opioids.</p>
<p>So we have a crisis after New England Journal of Medicine, just to be very honest, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s not necessarily only about kids, because they included 18 and 19 year olds</p>
<p>in that chart.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So those are adults.</p>
<p>Those are adults and kids.</p>
<p>And so drug overdoses and firearm related are spiking massively.</p>
<p>This is my point about having this debate.</p>
<p>This is being armed by the by the left.</p>
<p>And then the right says, Well, hold on, it doesn&rsquo;t include 18.</p>
<p>And then everybody gets caught in that whole, absolutely, the shooting, these shootings</p>
<p>are being done by people 1819.</p>
<p>But putting all this aside, I just want to make a bigger point about our children.</p>
<p>In the last few years with this COVID, the spike occurred during COVID of drug overdoses</p>
<p>and firearms.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of suicide in here as well.</p>
<p>So we should think holistically about, you know, how kids are dying.</p>
<p>Yeah, one other thing to that, which is we have plenty of gun laws on the books that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t enforced right now in San Francisco, you can&rsquo;t get Jason Boudin to enforce a gun</p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p>He, a young kid named Kelvin Chu got killed, because his his killer, a guy named Zion Young,</p>
<p>he was arrested weeks before on gun charges, and Jason Boudin just let him go.</p>
<p>And in LA with Gascon, he&rsquo;s dropped all gun enhancements to charges.</p>
<p>The whole thing is incompetence across the board.</p>
<p>So you got all these progressive prosecutors who aren&rsquo;t even prosecuting the gun laws we</p>
<p>got on the books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to change.</p>
<p>And Ted Cruz thinks this is about the backdoor being unlocked.</p>
<p>I mean, the stupidity across the board, left or right, everybody in between the incompetence</p>
<p>is stunning, and it has to stop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, if you make this about people&rsquo;s lawful gun ownership, they&rsquo;re going to oppose</p>
<p>what you want to do.</p>
<p>We got to make it some incremental controls, don&rsquo;t you agree there has to be some control.</p>
<p>The controls are basically preventing known psychos from getting weapons.</p>
<p>Okay, so you want to focus on that.</p>
<p>But to be clear, no additional gun control for you.</p>
<p>Background checks or anything.</p>
<p>Background checks.</p>
<p>I just want to be clear, red flag laws and background checks are good.</p>
<p>I know we have to wrap.</p>
<p>I think the consensus was around red flag.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a known profile Chamath articulated it well, David, I don&rsquo;t think we helped the</p>
<p>cause to build the consensus by calling a sick 16 year old kid struggling with self-identity</p>
<p>a psycho.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;re their kids who live all around us, this isn&rsquo;t about lecture.</p>
<p>This is about building consensus.</p>
<p>I think we can profile those folks.</p>
<p>They clearly have psychotic challenges, right?</p>
<p>But there is intervention to help these kids.</p>
<p>I know a lot of kids who frankly had challenges during high school who turned out to be great,</p>
<p>great human beings.</p>
<p>So these are kids at a very vulnerable age.</p>
<p>We should profile them within the community.</p>
<p>Social networks should help us identify these folks.</p>
<p>And we should get them help.</p>
<p>And I think you can build a reasonable consensus around that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Just to explain myself, I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>When I use the word psycho, I&rsquo;m referring to the the ones who actually became shooters.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m referring to those ones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that if we&rsquo;re talking about people who haven&rsquo;t done anything yet, who are mentally</p>
<p>ill, yes, we should get them help.</p>
<p>So I mean, mental illness, you know, this is and this goes to healthcare as well.</p>
<p>We should have national mental health services available freely to every American we are</p>
<p>in a mental health crisis between COVID and just modern life and suicide is becoming the</p>
<p>number one cause of death, sadly, for many demographics now, including our kids.</p>
<p>And so while we do a great job making cars safer, and creating life saving drugs and</p>
<p>emergency rooms and medical attention has gotten unbelievable and we&rsquo;re making all these,</p>
<p>you know, great advances, mental health, we&rsquo;re not making the advances we need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so so so sorry to all those families.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is just I get emotional.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just so sorry for all those people dealing with it&rsquo;s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Yeah, heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take some action here.</p>
<p>Enough with the thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually come up with a fucking plan and just I&rsquo;ve been on it for years.</p>
<p>I put up with it.</p>
<p>Sorry for the indignity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I said, my honest perspective is there&rsquo;s a clustering and a technology component to this</p>
<p>that can meaningfully help.</p>
<p>And we need to start knowing that there are these patterns, we need to say the words out</p>
<p>loud.</p>
<p>There are patterns for these school shooters for these mass shooters.</p>
<p>Those patterns can be written down, they have been written down.</p>
<p>And we need to do something about it, they need to be codified in some form of algorithms.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;ve already taught our kids how to duck and hide, I think we can also teach our</p>
<p>kids how to raise your hand well before they need to learn to duck and identify who&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>bullied.</p>
<p>And to your point about being profiled, if we profile somebody, and they&rsquo;re not a mass</p>
<p>shooter candidate, but they&rsquo;re just depressed, or they&rsquo;re being bullied.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s that they deserve help as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no downside to profiling somebody who&rsquo;s struggling, you&rsquo;re profiling them with</p>
<p>the intent of getting them help.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just profile the kids who are struggling, profile them for good.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll catch some, you know, who&rsquo;s struggling a priori.</p>
<p>My point is that you actually know they&rsquo;re being bullied, they&rsquo;re going to probably be</p>
<p>struggling.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the kids getting psychographic and demographic profiles of the 99% of the</p>
<p>cases that we&rsquo;ve seen over the last two decades.</p>
<p>And all I&rsquo;m encouraging politicians and technology companies to do is come together, create some</p>
<p>standard, you know, we have the downside, what&rsquo;s the downside, none, zero, have mechanisms</p>
<p>like this, by the way, where, you know, these technology companies already do these kinds</p>
<p>of profiles on other kinds of situations.</p>
<p>You know, typically, you need a physical request and other kinds of like legal interventions</p>
<p>in order to unlock this data.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not as if this is, you know, antithetical to what they do in other situations.</p>
<p>They certainly do it for fraud and advertising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if the technological prowess of these companies cannot be applied to a k means</p>
<p>clustering of this issue.</p>
<p>Okay, just to use a simple machine learning context like this is they put a lot of effort</p>
<p>into finding click fraud, right?</p>
<p>This is going to be a very similar problem.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t allow angry young men who&rsquo;ve been emailing with the Middle East, who are citizens</p>
<p>of this country who&rsquo;ve been posting online that they want to run a plane into a building</p>
<p>to go get their pilot&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Right, we profile them after September 11.</p>
<p>And we said no mass.</p>
<p>And all Chamath is saying is use your fucking common sense, identify these folks that we</p>
<p>know are struggling to need help, and put them on a list and say they can&rsquo;t buy an assault</p>
<p>weapon.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>Thank you to Brad Kirshner for sitting in.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the dictator Chamath Palihapitita and thanks, Sax.</p>
<p>And thanks to everybody who spoke at the All In Summit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been releasing all of the videos.</p>
<p>Freeberg will be back next week, as will the Hammer Lucky Explosive episode.</p>
<p>So look for a great week of All In content next week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
