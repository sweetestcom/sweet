    <p>Hold on, let&rsquo;s see if we can get Sax on the line.</p>
<p>Alright guys, I guess Sax is blowing it off because he&rsquo;s too busy with his app.</p>
<p>No, fuck Sax.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start without Sax.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start without Sax.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>With us today, the queen of quinoa on fire in California, which also happens to be on</p>
<p>fire sadly, and the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>David Sax will not be joining us today.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s too busy with his All In app.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually Call In.</p>
<p>He put a C in front of it.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Before he co-opted the All In podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Callin.</p>
<p>Callin.</p>
<p>Callin.</p>
<p>His Callin app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>But Sax will be, if you&rsquo;re a Sax stan, I think Sax is.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;ve done one show without Freeberg.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re doing one without Sax.</p>
<p>Yeah, this will be the Sax free episode.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>Sax free episode.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>So we got a lot on the dance floor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Oh, look who joined.</p>
<p>Look who joined.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all too eager to take credit for Call In on Twitter, so don&rsquo;t pretend like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not part of it now.</p>
<p>The All In app.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I meant Call In app.</p>
<p>The All In app.</p>
<p>I hope Call In is worth a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>This guy is complaining that I&rsquo;m leveraging the pod.</p>
<p>You know, we should have done the Adam Neumann style licensing of the term All In to Sax</p>
<p>and gotten paid like seven million dollars in equity for him using our name.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I gave you guys so many shout outs, you know, during the whole promotion.</p>
<p>Oh, shout outs.</p>
<p>By the way, no, he did.</p>
<p>Because I listened to his interview with Emily Chang and I listened to his thing with Axios</p>
<p>with Dan Premack.</p>
<p>Oh, did he?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, David had a very good.</p>
<p>It was magnanimous.</p>
<p>Presentation and then he was really magnanimous and kind.</p>
<p>So thanks, Saxy Poop.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>And I gave so much credit to J-Cal.</p>
<p>I said that if it wasn&rsquo;t for J-Cal, I never would have done this whole podcasting thing</p>
<p>because it was too hard.</p>
<p>I never would have figured it out.</p>
<p>And then you gave me a shout out because like of organizing it so that we could all be friends</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>I actually haven&rsquo;t listened to it, but give us a, for those who don&rsquo;t know, David Sax</p>
<p>has created a podcasting slash casual audio app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Call In.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available for download for iOS, just coming out of private beta.</p>
<p>My understanding is you&rsquo;re at somewhere around 10,000 folks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of signups yesterday.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t got all the latest numbers yet, but yeah, no, it&rsquo;s taking off.</p>
<p>All the reviews of it have been sort of rave reviews.</p>
<p>People are really excited about it.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>But yeah, look, the concept is we&rsquo;re combining social audio with podcasting.</p>
<p>We call it social podcasting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen these apps where people create a room and they have these many to many conversations.</p>
<p>They tend to be ephemeral.</p>
<p>No one really records or saves them.</p>
<p>And the quality of the conversation, it&rsquo;s a little bit chaotic, but we&rsquo;ve taken that</p>
<p>concept and put it in the service of creators who can now essentially like record their</p>
<p>pod in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>They can bring up the, we call them callers.</p>
<p>They can bring up people from the audience one by one to ask their questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more organized and structured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a free for all to try and grab the mic.</p>
<p>And then once you record the episode, you can then go into post-production in the app.</p>
<p>You can edit the transcript in order to edit the episode, and then you publish it and you</p>
<p>can share it.</p>
<p>Is it like, so it&rsquo;s basically like only fans, but audio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only fans, but for people who don&rsquo;t look good on camera.</p>
<p>Do you still jerk off at the end?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Family show.</p>
<p>Family show.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I do when this becomes a unicorn.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Delete.</p>
<p>Delete.</p>
<p>No, not delete!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my birthday today, God damn it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Chamath.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going around the horn here.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s patting themselves on the back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all take a moment to say what we like about Chamath.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the episode.</p>
<p>That was quick.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what birthday present do I get for Chamath?</p>
<p>And then I was like, gee, what do you get for the dictator who has everything?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What does Kim Jong-un need?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, wait a second.</p>
<p>What did they get MBS for his birthday?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Hey, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>Wine.</p>
<p>Very rare wine.</p>
<p>Very rare wine.</p>
<p>Very rare wine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually an answer to that question.</p>
<p>And apparently, Madeline Albright once got Kim Jong-un a basketball signed by Michael</p>
<p>Jordan for his birthday.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Apparently, that&rsquo;s what you get a dictator.</p>
<p>Access.</p>
<p>You get them access to people they wouldn&rsquo;t normally have or a bone saw.</p>
<p>A very, very, very old French Burgundy.</p>
<p>Ideally white, but the white doesn&rsquo;t hold up as well.</p>
<p>But if you go back, I mean, I wonder if you could drink.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, I had the two the two fills, Deutsch and Muth at my house.</p>
<p>And we had we drank nineteen ninety six Salon Clos de Mesnil.</p>
<p>No, sorry.</p>
<p>Nineteen ninety seven Salon Clos de Mesnil.</p>
<p>And then we drank a bottle of nineteen ninety six Paul Roger Sir Winston Churchill champagne.</p>
<p>Fabulous.</p>
<p>Only champagne.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>We could also get you some plenonium plenonium if you want to.</p>
<p>No, guys, guys, I don&rsquo;t want to take out some enemies.</p>
<p>I would like you to come and play poker next Thursday, you fuckers.</p>
<p>And then I was just bring a bottle of bring a really nice bottle of wine or champagne.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll drink it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I got cases of terrible one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to bring him.</p>
<p>No, you asshole.</p>
<p>Did you hear what this fucker did?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>This piece of shit showed up last week.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, come on through these fantastic bottles.</p>
<p>And I looked at this like nineteen eighty five came and said, I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not a good year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard in the right in the garbage.</p>
<p>Five is right in the garbage.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>He has two bottles.</p>
<p>And so he gives them to Joshua and Joshua looks at them.</p>
<p>And Joshua doesn&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>And he looks at me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, just like, you know.</p>
<p>And so Josh was like, wow, David, thanks, Friedberg.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>And then Friedberg does the fucking most brutal thing.</p>
<p>Open it.</p>
<p>Open it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get Josh was so appalled.</p>
<p>He opened it and poured it on.</p>
<p>I threw it out.</p>
<p>I took it right to the garden.</p>
<p>No, he said, where did you find this?</p>
<p>He goes, oh, it was in my basement in the hot, temperate, humid, fucking San Francisco weather for ten years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I moved, you know, I moved like two weeks ago and I went to the basement, like get all my boxes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve got like hundreds of bottles of wine that I have not seen in years.</p>
<p>And I started not temperature controlled furnace.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t lying flat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, these are all like they&rsquo;re all core.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all they&rsquo;re all.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like stuff in the 80s, 90s.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So me a Josh took them and poured them over the arugula salad.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the arugula.</p>
<p>No, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The arugula would ruin the fucking vegetables and herbs in the garden.</p>
<p>He basically cleaned the drain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to burn them on Chabot&rsquo;s windshield.</p>
<p>Do not bring any more wine to my house.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bringing wine for your dog.</p>
<p>If your dog&rsquo;s coming back with Nat.</p>
<p>My dogs are coming back today.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re flying back.</p>
<p>All I have to say about that game is thank God.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast has 100 million followers on YouTube.</p>
<p>Rest RIP, Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You know, by the way, I want to say give a shout out.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast is fucking incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great.</p>
<p>What a great.</p>
<p>What an incredible entrepreneur.</p>

<p>This guy is clearly on track to being an enormous figure in culture.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s going to be a fucking multi multi billionaire.</p>
<p>He is determined, hardworking, smart, kind, good, ambitious, clever, ambitious.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And his ideas.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s creative.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just a good human.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast was one of the most impressive people I&rsquo;ve met in a really, really, really long</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>I mean, he and I had been texting for a long time on Twitter and then and then just on</p>
<p>text.</p>
<p>But then to finally meet him and we had talked on the phone and we had zoomed before, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never met him in prison.</p>
<p>But what an incredible.</p>
<p>Oh, why don&rsquo;t we have him as the best guest on the pod?</p>
<p>He totally like he totally fit in with the group, too.</p>
<p>He was great.</p>
<p>Just funny.</p>
<p>All we should do is we should all round everybody up.</p>
<p>We should fly to to Greenville.</p>
<p>We should surprise him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do a little game at his.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>No, we could do is we could tweak Phil Hellmuth and just have a game and replace Phil in the</p>
<p>game with him as our new bestie.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replace.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replace the mute with Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>Replace the mute with Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>Replace the mute with Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>Kind of like a better bestie in many ways.</p>
<p>OK, listen.</p>
<p>By the way, are we skipping next week to record at the symposium on Monday or are we going</p>
<p>to do next week and then also do Monday?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Double down.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Double down.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s keep it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s double down.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>We have a lot of shit to cover.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good notification.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing our first all together recording of the all in pod a week from Monday.</p>
<p>At?</p>
<p>At the TPB symposium.</p>
<p>No reason to.</p>
<p>The production board.</p>
<p>The production board.</p>
<p>No reason to publicize it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m excited because it&rsquo;s a closed event.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the event?</p>
<p>I just get together a bunch of scientists, investors, entrepreneurs and CEOs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a day of science talks mostly and then some business talks on the next day.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re having a really fun event the night before with poker.</p>
<p>Our friends are all coming to play poker and we&rsquo;re going to record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming for the science day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there for the science day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying for the science day too.</p>
<p>I want to learn.</p>
<p>But the poker night is going to have poker and we&rsquo;re going to record the all in pod live</p>
<p>or together in person for the first time.</p>
<p>First time.</p>
<p>Yeah, that should be really cool.</p>
<p>And for those of you wondering, you know, we&rsquo;re going to do our own all in summit, which</p>
<p>will be probably like 100 or 200 iconoclastic people.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to probably do that in the first quarter or second quarter of next year</p>
<p>post pandemic.</p>
<p>We got to choose a date.</p>
<p>You know, my people are going crazy because you won&rsquo;t give them a date.</p>
<p>I still think we should do it in.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>In Rome.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>If dictator wants Italy, Rome.</p>
<p>Sax wants Miami.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you guys their hotel in Miami is the sickest hotel in the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>The people you have never seen these people ever.</p>
<p>These people are amazing.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Tremendous.</p>
<p>In Rome.</p>
<p>They are great.</p>
<p>It attracts the hottest people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fucking right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing it based on aesthetics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing it on ideas.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just aesthetics.</p>
<p>Wherever you are.</p>
<p>People are going to go to Rome.</p>
<p>You know, Miami.</p>
<p>The good thing about Miami is we know it&rsquo;ll be open no matter what.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, we can&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>We can host our own super spreader event.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>No, I mean, we&rsquo;re a host.</p>
<p>The, uh, the code conference, Kara Swisher&rsquo;s conferences at the end of the</p>
<p>month and sky and Brooke and I are hosting our poker again.</p>
<p>And I was like, is there any way this conference is going to occur?</p>
<p>And if it does occur, what happens if they&rsquo;re, I mean, obviously</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s going to be vaxxed.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going to be Mac.</p>
<p>Masked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re going to do testing.</p>
<p>You think everyone should be mass at the conference?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be, unless it&rsquo;s, well, they&rsquo;re going to be because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>indoors and there&rsquo;s a breakout event amongst the vaccinated, which can</p>
<p>happen between Delta and Zeta two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, uh, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re going to be forced.</p>
<p>What do you think sacks?</p>
<p>Well, I just think, how do you effectively have a meeting with people</p>
<p>when everyone indoors, when everyone&rsquo;s wearing a mask?</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s, and by the way, I mean, there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Indoors, not during the dinner and stuff.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think for poker, but we are testing everyone on</p>
<p>entry all three days.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We do a rapid test at the door.</p>
<p>And so, but then once you&rsquo;ve done the test and someone&rsquo;s negative,</p>
<p>why would you need a mask?</p>
<p>Once you go in?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The stupidest thing is they do stuff like make you wear the mask, but</p>
<p>then take it off for dinner.</p>
<p>Like what you, you can&rsquo;t get COVID when your mouth is full.</p>
<p>I mean, how does that work?</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Put your mask on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do risk assessment here.</p>
<p>And then take it off when you sit down three feet away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s security theater.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do risk assessment.</p>
<p>None of us would go to an indoor event if it wasn&rsquo;t fully vaxed.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Would anybody attend an indoor event of this nature?</p>
<p>Hundreds of people.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t have the VAX requirement.</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You would.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what I would care about is I wouldn&rsquo;t attend it.</p>
<p>If people weren&rsquo;t all being tested on entrance.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>The VAX doesn&rsquo;t seem to eliminate.</p>
<p>Transmission.</p>
<p>So for you to go to an event, you would have to be vaxed and tested that</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>Morning of rapid test.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think in general, everyone&rsquo;s kind of standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, make sure VAX, because it reduces the likelihood of</p>
<p>transmission, but still like, it&rsquo;s not stopping transmission.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather, what I care more about is, is point of entry testing,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re doing at our symposium.</p>
<p>I just want everyone to get tested upon entry.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about something important.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen, I think the most interesting thing going on in our industry</p>
<p>this week is Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
<p>His trial has begun.</p>
<p>Jury selection started this week.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to cover 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit</p>
<p>wire fraud over false claims.</p>
<p>She made about the blood test results from Theranos.</p>
<p>They have now selected a jury of 12 Northern California residents</p>
<p>consisting of seven men and five women.</p>
<p>It took two days to question around a hundred potential jurors about</p>
<p>their answers to a 28-page questionnaire that included news outlets</p>
<p>they read, what news outlets they read, if they knew any witnesses,</p>
<p>and if they had any negative medical experiences.</p>
<p>And it was complicated to get these because it&rsquo;s impossible to not</p>
<p>know about it.</p>
<p>And now it seems the interesting thing is Elizabeth Holmes,</p>
<p>who worked on this company for close to two decades and was involved</p>
<p>in this fraud from start to finish, is now taking the position that</p>
<p>she was under the control of her business partner, Sonny Balwani,</p>
<p>and that he had been abusing her and controlling her.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on?</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s being tried separately, by the way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be tried in sequential order.</p>
<p>So whenever this trial ends, then he gets to get tried.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on if she will be convicted</p>
<p>and her defense strategy?</p>
<p>I think this is less about the specific evidence against her,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much more right now about the whole Silicon Valley</p>
<p>fake it before you make it approach to entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>We all hear this from all the entrepreneurial advisors</p>
<p>and stories of experience and stories of success,</p>
<p>that in order to achieve success as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you really have to oversell and promise and create an incredible narrative</p>
<p>about where your business is headed.</p>
<p>And in many cases, that gets ahead of you.</p>
<p>Now, the public, the general public that doesn&rsquo;t operate within Silicon Valley</p>
<p>with as much breadth as we do, I think they hear the stories</p>
<p>of the Adam Neumann&rsquo;s and we work in the collapse and Elizabeth Holmes</p>
<p>and this Trevor Milton guy and Nicola.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s 1000s of these other sorts of smaller stories</p>
<p>where VC rolls his eyes where the first board meeting</p>
<p>after raising money is like, wait a second,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually going to be half our forecast when we raise money,</p>
<p>or the numbers are going to be way below</p>
<p>or the product doesn&rsquo;t actually work as we presented it.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever funded a company</p>
<p>where that hasn&rsquo;t been the case.</p>
<p>Exactly. And so I think that&rsquo;s the big question, right?</p>
<p>Does this trial kind of indict the way Silicon Valley operates</p>
<p>and the storytelling models and the narrative models,</p>
<p>there are examples of these people getting a little too far ahead of their skis</p>
<p>and maybe you can argue, they could perceive something to be non fraudulent</p>
<p>while other people can kind of perceive it to be fraudulent.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t we see this kind of broadly in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t this kind of bring up a question on like,</p>
<p>are all startups now and is the industry going to have a shift</p>
<p>as a result of this trial in terms of behavior as investors</p>
<p>and as entrepreneurs and how you tell stories, how you diligence, etc.</p>
<p>This is only going to get meaningfully worse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Elizabeth Holmes committed fraud or not.</p>
<p>I think that these folks will be able to figure that out in detail.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s something that I do know pretty precisely,</p>
<p>which is the amount of money that&rsquo;s trying to get into Silicon Valley</p>
<p>is going exponentially up.</p>
<p>And as that happens, you guys now see it every day</p>
<p>where there are firms whose entire business now</p>
<p>is just to literally write a check every day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re closing deals every single day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing zero diligence.</p>
<p>And so what that&rsquo;s going to create is an incentive for founders,</p>
<p>particularly those whose backs are against the wall</p>
<p>or who&rsquo;s doing something that&rsquo;s highly speculative and hard to diligence</p>
<p>to stretch the truth to get the capital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible for guys like us to actually step in</p>
<p>and do diligence on a lot of these companies,</p>
<p>even if you actually have time.</p>
<p>But then if the competitive dynamic is such that you don&rsquo;t even have the time</p>
<p>because somebody else beside you is going to rip in a check</p>
<p>by just meeting somebody and, quote unquote,</p>
<p>having done the work on their own, which is impossible</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have access to somebody&rsquo;s financial books,</p>
<p>this problem is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>And so I think we as an industry just have to realize that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be an incentive to lie.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be an incentive to stretch the truth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of the amount of money that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>and the lack of diligence that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Saks, is this an example in the case of Elizabeth Holmes</p>
<p>of somebody being delusional as a strength</p>
<p>or somebody committing fraud as a crime?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably both.</p>
<p>Now, look, I think you guys are giving a little bit too much credence</p>
<p>to the media narrative that Theranos is a, quote unquote,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley failure.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is there was no major Silicon Valley VC firm,</p>
<p>in fact, not even a minor one, that invested in Theranos as far as I know.</p>
<p>There was no VC on the board of Theranos.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>It was a bunch of kind of grand poobah types.</p>
<p>And there was no one who actually had the technical competence</p>
<p>to do diligence.</p>
<p>And so, Elizabeth Holmes isn&rsquo;t so much an example of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>as somebody who was selling Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>She was selling the promise of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>She was selling the idea that this was going to be a decacorn</p>
<p>or a centacorn to people who are too unwitting to know.</p>
<p>And I see, you know, Tim Draper a lot.</p>
<p>People are really hanging their hat on the fact that Tim Draper</p>
<p>wrote a seed investment to Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
<p>You know, that really is very different.</p>
<p>You know, when you write a seed investment,</p>
<p>clearly Elizabeth Holmes was like a neighbor of his.</p>
<p>Yeah, their daughters were friends is my understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah, and she clearly was an impressive person.</p>
<p>You know, she came across impressively in person.</p>
<p>She obviously cast a pretty big reality distortion field</p>
<p>to a lot of, you know, smart people.</p>
<p>So, you know, she&rsquo;s the type of person who you would write potentially</p>
<p>a seed check to just based on, you know, a talent bet.</p>
<p>The fact that she later chose to engage in fraud,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s like Tim Draper&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t make this like a Silicon Valley fraud.</p>
<p>Again, you know, show us the VC firm that was hoodwinked by this.</p>
<p>But you are seeing, David, this trend of the firms coming in</p>
<p>and not doing diligence, not having audit rights,</p>
<p>not having information rights, not doing proper diligence,</p>
<p>and basically relying on the previous investors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How troubling is that?</p>
<p>And what are you doing to protect Kraft&rsquo;s LPs?</p>
<p>Yeah, so look, I think there&rsquo;s a big difference between</p>
<p>going into a board meeting and finding out the projections</p>
<p>were inflated because, like, frankly,</p>
<p>we all take projections with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But versus the founder lying about the past.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So people are always going to put the rosiest picture.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to puff up what the future is going to look like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s up to you as the investor to determine if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>But they cannot lie about the past.</p>
<p>They cannot lie about what their revenue was last year,</p>
<p>what contracts they signed before you invested.</p>
<p>That is fraud.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that is what ‚Äì that&rsquo;s where Elizabeth Holmes crossed the line.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t just painting a rosy picture of, you know,</p>
<p>what the technology would look like, you know, years from now.</p>
<p>She was lying about their capabilities at the time people were investing.</p>
<p>That is the line you cannot cross.</p>
<p>Look, we conduct diligence.</p>
<p>We, you know, try to look at financials.</p>
<p>We try to make sure that the numbers are all true.</p>
<p>You know, frankly, we&rsquo;re not investing in things</p>
<p>that involve a tremendous amount of technical risk,</p>
<p>a lot of technology risk.</p>
<p>So we always use the product before we invest.</p>
<p>The idea that the product would be faked,</p>
<p>I think it would be hard to perpetrate that kind of fraud with a SaaS company.</p>
<p>But so, look, I mean, that&rsquo;s what we look at.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting you bring that up.</p>
<p>I just dropped a link into the Zoom chat.</p>
<p>Co-founder and former CEO of Palo Alto-based startup technology company,</p>
<p>Headspin, charged with securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>And this guy, Lakhwani, 45 from Santa Clara County,</p>
<p>basically was lying about their ARR in a SaaS company.</p>
<p>And they raised a bunch of money.</p>
<p>So this is an example of somebody&hellip;</p>
<p>It can happen in every company.</p>
<p>Yeah, it can happen at&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re inoculated just because you invest in SaaS.</p>
<p>My point is, if you have a person that&rsquo;s willing to rip in a check,</p>
<p>$100 million, three hours after meeting you,</p>
<p>asking for no diligence, at some point, David,</p>
<p>your back is going to be against the wall</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to have to justify to your LPs</p>
<p>why you aren&rsquo;t in some of these theoretically good deals, right?</p>
<p>And some of them will become fraudulent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just turn out to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the laws of distribution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, you&rsquo;re saying, Shamath.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do&hellip;</p>
<p>You have to get deals done.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re up against people who won&rsquo;t do diligence.</p>
<p>No, it actually comes down to something different,</p>
<p>which is then you have to differentiate with real brand,</p>
<p>meaning if somebody really wants you on the cap table,</p>
<p>they will absolutely slow everything down to get you.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s Mike Moritz.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use that.</p>
<p>There is nobody in the world, I think,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not a complete buffoon moron</p>
<p>who wouldn&rsquo;t slow his process or her process down</p>
<p>to get Mike to be on their board.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re willing to basically just scuttle an entire process</p>
<p>and just take the fastest money,</p>
<p>I think it actually says something</p>
<p>that there is more risk in backing somebody like you</p>
<p>than somebody that wouldn&rsquo;t slow it down.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So then, you know, the problem is there&rsquo;s fewer</p>
<p>and fewer Mike Moritz&rsquo;s in the world.</p>
<p>You know, I think Sachs is one of those people.</p>
<p>I think Peter Thiel is another kind of person.</p>
<p>You know, Bill Gurley is another kind of person.</p>
<p>So there are these people in our industry</p>
<p>where I think that you will slow things down.</p>
<p>And I do think allow these folks to do diligence.</p>
<p>And I think there will be less fraud in general for that cohort.</p>
<p>But if your platform becomes one that&rsquo;s just about ripping money in,</p>
<p>and I think the late stages are roughly this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all brand independent because the money is the same,</p>
<p>the valuations are the same.</p>
<p>Freeberg, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it introduce the risk of the retail investor?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re seeing more retail participation via syndicates,</p>
<p>you know, via, you know, one-off investments,</p>
<p>online kind of marketplaces, and also SPACs,</p>
<p>where the retail investor relies on, you know,</p>
<p>Chamath, some of these kind of bigger institutional</p>
<p>or perhaps some name that gets some carried interest</p>
<p>in an investment doing the diligence.</p>
<p>And if the activity level is going up and the dollars are flowing in</p>
<p>and the margin of error is increasing, you know,</p>
<p>is there not some inevitable kind of SEC backlash</p>
<p>or consideration around how are private companies</p>
<p>ultimately raising money and how much they are disclosing?</p>
<p>And we kind of face this regulatory threat.</p>
<p>I can address this as a syndicate lead.</p>
<p>You know, we only take accredited investor money at this time.</p>
<p>And so anything that happens is with obviously sophisticated people,</p>
<p>the top 4% of Americans investing in companies.</p>
<p>And in our diligence now, we have seen a spike</p>
<p>in what I&rsquo;ll call massaging or painting the picture</p>
<p>in a way that I&rsquo;m not comfortable with.</p>
<p>And we have maybe tripled the amount of time we&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>into diligence now because I really care about my reputation.</p>
<p>And maybe 20%, 30% of the companies we wind up</p>
<p>after initially wanting to invest, maybe giving them an offer,</p>
<p>getting an allocation.</p>
<p>In recent history, 20%, 30% were winding up backing out</p>
<p>during the diligence process because their revenue</p>
<p>was not software-based.</p>
<p>There was $100,000 in consulting revenue.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re going to make these kind of decisions</p>
<p>early on in the company, I think it&rsquo;s indicative of future fraud</p>
<p>or future moral or ethical issues.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sitting out in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>There are public platforms now, Republic and SeedInvest,</p>
<p>which I know are also increasing their diligence process</p>
<p>because there are so many newcomers to the space.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a level, I&rsquo;ll be quite frank here,</p>
<p>of entitlement amongst founders that is being, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>encouraged unintentionally by the lack of diligence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>People are not taking the process as seriously</p>
<p>as they did 10 years ago or even 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I agree.</p>
<p>I think the diligence you&rsquo;re doing is really good.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I agree with Chamath.</p>
<p>So we have seen this trend in our industry</p>
<p>of the private equity money coming in in greater volumes,</p>
<p>in greater, you know, earlier and earlier</p>
<p>and faster and faster, right?</p>
<p>And it started with, you know, you have these,</p>
<p>like frankly, like public company investors</p>
<p>were looking at the value at IPO relative to the last private round</p>
<p>and they saw, wow, there&rsquo;s like 2, 3x market peer for one year.</p>
<p>Those are phenomenal returns.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s arb that by getting into the last private round.</p>
<p>Then they look at the second to last private round.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, wait, there&rsquo;s a big return there.</p>
<p>So they keep moving earlier and earlier to arb out that return.</p>
<p>But to Chamath&rsquo;s point, it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re applying a financial model</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not in the diligence business.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, and I think they just see like fraud</p>
<p>as a cost of doing business, right?</p>
<p>Something they can model out with a portfolio.</p>
<p>But the only reason they can model it out that way</p>
<p>and have the fraud be an acceptable and predictable</p>
<p>sort of cost of doing business</p>
<p>is because you had these firms in our industry</p>
<p>who actually did diligence at the seed, at the Series A, right?</p>
<p>And now the private equity guys, they&rsquo;re moving so early.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually even now doing the, they&rsquo;re moving all the way to Series A.</p>
<p>So no one&rsquo;s doing the diligence.</p>
<p>And so that is a risk, I think,</p>
<p>because it might actually change things.</p>
<p>And this is where, bringing it back to Elizabeth Holmes,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important here that there&rsquo;s a conviction.</p>
<p>I think she should do time.</p>
<p>This was clearly a major fraud, big time fraud.</p>
<p>And even if she didn&rsquo;t directly perpetrate it on Silicon Valley VCs,</p>
<p>I think the message to the industry would be absolutely horrible</p>
<p>if she gets away with it.</p>
<p>And frankly, I&rsquo;m a little concerned she&rsquo;s going to get away with it.</p>
<p>You know, because-</p>
<p>Well, she is incredibly charismatic.</p>
<p>John Kerry was saying on a CNBC hit</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t underestimate her charisma and ability to snow people.</p>
<p>And the Shvengali defense, and she just had a baby,</p>
<p>which, you know, people don&rsquo;t want to discuss</p>
<p>because it seems like it&rsquo;s sexist.</p>
<p>But she is a Shvengali herself who will manipulate people in the-</p>
<p>I like the way you say that, Shvengali.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a Shvengali, like a-</p>
<p>I think you mean Svengali, but Shvengali.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m talking out of Brooklyn right now.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you handicap her likelihood of conviction at?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably like a 50-50.</p>
<p>And I think, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>When she was running this company,</p>
<p>she wanted everyone to believe she was Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>She even did the media tour with the turtleneck.</p>
<p>She wanted everyone to know that she was a Jobsian micromanager</p>
<p>who made every decision and was responsible for the success.</p>
<p>Now that she&rsquo;s on trial,</p>
<p>she wants us to believe that she wasn&rsquo;t calling the shots.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t the person in charge.</p>
<p>She had 99% voting power in the company,</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;m understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, this is sort of the</p>
<p>Romy and Michelle&rsquo;s high school reunion defense</p>
<p>where she wants us to suddenly believe</p>
<p>that she was sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>the sort of ingenue who didn&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>but she might get off because she kind of looks like Lisa Kudrow.</p>
<p>Wow, this is a lot of deep polls here.</p>
<p>You have a lot of deep media polls here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That is deep.</p>
<p>The number of polls there.</p>
<p>Based on the number of polls,</p>
<p>I know exactly how old you are too.</p>
<p>Romy and Michelle&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>Lisa Kudrow is her galore.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to go up there</p>
<p>and pretend to be Lisa Kudrow or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also offensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super offensive that she wants to get up there</p>
<p>and say that she was this abused woman.</p>
<p>I mean, for women who actually are abused,</p>
<p>for her to get up there and say she&rsquo;s an abused woman</p>
<p>because she perpetrated this 20 year.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether she was abused or not.</p>
<p>And if she was,</p>
<p>it may or may not have implicated in what she did,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know whether she did,</p>
<p>because again, thank God for the laws in America,</p>
<p>she is presumed innocent.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s all just like,</p>
<p>I think what David where I agree with you is the following,</p>
<p>which is we do need to know that, you know,</p>
<p>investors, we all sign up</p>
<p>for expressing the fiduciary responsibilities</p>
<p>on behalf of our LPs or on behalf of our stakeholders.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There needs to be some equivalent standard</p>
<p>that founders are held to.</p>
<p>And there needs to be consequences for lying,</p>
<p>particularly about the past,</p>
<p>because in the future you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just projecting,</p>
<p>but in the past, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You have to be able to rely on what&rsquo;s given to you.</p>
<p>Like, look, when we do diligence in a company,</p>
<p>we are given everything that they have, right?</p>
<p>We talk to their lawyers.</p>
<p>We talk to their lawyers, lawyers, in some cases,</p>
<p>in the public markets,</p>
<p>all of this has to be transparently published</p>
<p>so that we can come to our own conclusion.</p>
<p>Sometimes those conclusions are right.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>but we can at least know that they&rsquo;re not lying to us.</p>
<p>The minute that it turns out</p>
<p>that they were fudging the numbers that they gave us,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the best decisions you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming that it&rsquo;s great data,</p>
<p>but if the data is fudged, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>And so to the extent that she did that,</p>
<p>then she should be punished.</p>
<p>She needs that standard.</p>
<p>This goes beyond money.</p>
<p>She was switching people&rsquo;s results.</p>
<p>She was saying that she was giving them a blood result</p>
<p>on her incredible Theranos machine,</p>
<p>and she was running it to the back</p>
<p>and running it on an Abbott machine.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So she was taking investors,</p>
<p>putting their blood into her machine,</p>
<p>the Theranos machine,</p>
<p>then taking them for coffee,</p>
<p>running it to an Abbott machine,</p>
<p>and giving their results.</p>
<p>I mean, this was the definition</p>
<p>of a premeditated, deliberate, and multi-year fraud.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I put her at 80% likelihood of guilty,</p>
<p>and I put the over-under at 32.5 months served.</p>
<p>Served.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the-</p>
<p>Take the under.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking the under of 32.5 months?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the under.</p>
<p>Saks, observed, observed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the under.</p>
<p>What do you got, Saks?</p>
<p>Well, I hope you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a little worried</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s going to figure out a way</p>
<p>to pull the rug over people&rsquo;s eyes here.</p>
<p>What are our kids going to get in jail</p>
<p>if we were Chinese right now</p>
<p>and they played video games?</p>
<p>How many months are they going to get?</p>
<p>Basically, I think you would do harder time.</p>
<p>So, moving on to our next story.</p>
<p>No, the consequences is to the Chinese internet companies.</p>
<p>No, what&rsquo;s the consequence to the kids</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re caught on video games?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>The companies have to turn it off.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>China bans young people from playing video games.</p>
<p>This is for kids who are under the age of 18.</p>
<p>They are now restricted from playing games on weekdays,</p>
<p>can only play for three hours most weekends.</p>
<p>And these were set as a response</p>
<p>to China&rsquo;s physical and mental health</p>
<p>being affected by gaming, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>It limits&hellip;</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re doing what all American parents</p>
<p>would want our government to do for our kids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with that.</p>
<p>Gamers are now penalized if they don&rsquo;t obey,</p>
<p>and the gaming companies will be as well.</p>
<p>Gaming companies will have to prove</p>
<p>they have an identification system in place,</p>
<p>like requiring monitors to use their real names.</p>
<p>Do you know how fucking hard it is?</p>
<p>I have three kids in that age range.</p>
<p>I am sweating who they&rsquo;re texting,</p>
<p>who they&rsquo;re talking to,</p>
<p>what game they&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>the new game they want to download.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>This is the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever said</p>
<p>that would make me want to move to China.</p>
<p>This one rule is the most incredible thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever heard, and they&rsquo;re so smart.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s so beautiful is</p>
<p>they send fentanyl and TikTok to us</p>
<p>so that we get addicted to that shit.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>no, you guys are going to learn STEM</p>
<p>so that you can take over the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful. It&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say everything about China</p>
<p>is a measured decision, right?</p>
<p>The Politburo, the decision makers</p>
<p>are not sitting there,</p>
<p>randomly shooting from the hip</p>
<p>based on intuition and saying,</p>
<p>hey, I think we should stop video games.</p>
<p>They seem bad for kids.</p>
<p>There is clearly evidence and data</p>
<p>and statistical models</p>
<p>that are driving this decision</p>
<p>and their objective function</p>
<p>is improve the health, the longevity</p>
<p>and the economic prosperity</p>
<p>of our society as a whole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, did you get this statement from China?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Continue, comrade.</p>
<p>Comrade Friedberg, continue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pointing out,</p>
<p>these guys generally don&rsquo;t make decisions</p>
<p>based on someone&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>flippant intuition.</p>
<p>They make decisions based on</p>
<p>what they believe to be in the better interest.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or wrong,</p>
<p>but in the better interest</p>
<p>of economic prosperity and longevity.</p>
<p>They got a 100 year plan, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>They want to win.</p>
<p>And I think we all know it intuitively.</p>
<p>We can certainly read reports,</p>
<p>but in the United States,</p>
<p>we value individual liberties above all else.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t find ourselves</p>
<p>in a circumstance that seems foreign</p>
<p>and scary and crazy.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s another, in my opinion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another tool that China will use</p>
<p>to outcompete the century.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t value individual liberties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what we tell people.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not totally true.</p>
<p>And you know that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go there, but yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean,</p>
<p>we are literally sitting here fighting.</p>
<p>There is a group of individuals</p>
<p>who are fighting to wear masks</p>
<p>or not have to wear a mask, rather,</p>
<p>not have to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if we want to go there,</p>
<p>we are denying a woman&rsquo;s right to choose.</p>
<p>Can I, can I, can I?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to David Sachs.</p>
<p>David Sachs, are you in support</p>
<p>of Texas&rsquo;s abortion ban?</p>
<p>No, no, let&rsquo;s just hear it on China.</p>
<p>No, no, I think it&rsquo;s a stupid law</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain why in a second.</p>
<p>But just on the China thing for a second.</p>
<p>This is, I&rsquo;ll be a dissenting voice here.</p>
<p>This is like if we had given</p>
<p>Tipper Gore dictatorial powers.</p>
<p>I mean, this is insane.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to, they&rsquo;re going to determine</p>
<p>how many hours a kid can play video games.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I get the potential benefit,</p>
<p>but this is incredibly intrusive</p>
<p>into the lives of citizens.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that video game playing</p>
<p>is altogether a negative thing.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>our kids go through a phase</p>
<p>where they play a lot of games</p>
<p>and they grow out of it.</p>
<p>And, you know, you talk to developers,</p>
<p>like computer programmers,</p>
<p>they all went through some phase</p>
<p>where they were like hyper addicted</p>
<p>to video games.</p>
<p>It, you know, builds hand-eye coordination.</p>
<p>It builds sort of, you know,</p>
<p>computer literacy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>Look, obviously, if someone does nothing</p>
<p>but computer games their whole life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>But as a phase that a kid goes through,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>I agree with you,</p>
<p>because I used to play three hours</p>
<p>of fucking Zelda a day when I came home.</p>
<p>No, because I was a latchkey kid.</p>
<p>No, because I was a latchkey kid</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have anybody</p>
<p>to take care of me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, David, though,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what kids are getting</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re playing four hours</p>
<p>of fucking Call of Duty every night.</p>
<p>Four hours?</p>
<p>These kids are playing 10 hours a day.</p>
<p>By the way, I think China has another motivation</p>
<p>for this ban, which is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a lot of,</p>
<p>because of the one-child policy, right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a radical misbalance</p>
<p>of, you know, male to female ratio.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a lot of young males</p>
<p>without romantic prospects in that country.</p>
<p>Basically, they have an incel problem.</p>
<p>They have a ton of incels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant incel problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we hear much about it</p>
<p>because they control the media.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of just random violence out there.</p>
<p>And the last thing they want to do</p>
<p>is have these incels</p>
<p>playing Fortnite and Call of Duty,</p>
<p>shooting people five hours a night,</p>
<p>and then getting their brains wired that way.</p>
<p>That might be playing into this decision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, again, you&rsquo;re just validating</p>
<p>the mental health aspect.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve studied the mental health implications</p>
<p>of these video games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing for the ban.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m arguing for the fact</p>
<p>that China has certainly done something</p>
<p>to indicate they have some data</p>
<p>that indicates why they should make this decision.</p>
<p>It may be, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>it may be about kind of, you know,</p>
<p>growing, getting people to be more romantic</p>
<p>and get out of the house</p>
<p>and go get married and have kids and whatnot.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s certainly a&hellip;</p>
<p>And remember, their objective function</p>
<p>is always about longevity and economic prosperity.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making them say</p>
<p>that we can increase economic prosperity,</p>
<p>increase longevity by doing this.</p>
<p>And that outweighs</p>
<p>whatever the detrimental social</p>
<p>and other effects might be.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to read into it.</p>
<p>But no matter what,</p>
<p>every big decision they make</p>
<p>has some degree of competitive advantage for them.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>those kids, if they&rsquo;re not playing video games,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be doing something else.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>programming computers,</p>
<p>doing biotechnology in a lab,</p>
<p>figuring stuff out on the internet,</p>
<p>writing the next cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s going to be some advantage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to arise</p>
<p>out of the time and the productivity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be generated by this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the calculus</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re undertaking here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>No, no, we all agree they&rsquo;re thoughtful.</p>
<p>The question is,</p>
<p>what is this going to do for this generation</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t play video games?</p>
<p>Are they going to be more productive?</p>
<p>Are they going to be, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be good drones for the collective,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the downside here</p>
<p>is even if they get it right</p>
<p>in this particular case,</p>
<p>how much freedom do you have to give up?</p>
<p>How much state surveillance</p>
<p>is there in the enforcement?</p>
<p>And how many other insane policies</p>
<p>will they foist on people</p>
<p>with this mentality of</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to live your life individually,</p>
<p>you got to serve this collective?</p>
<p>This is actually, I think, your best point, Sax,</p>
<p>is that I think what could happen here</p>
<p>is you can overplay a hand</p>
<p>and by squeezing people too tightly,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t play video games,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t run your own companies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get replaced,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t practice your own religion,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say what you want,</p>
<p>be a journalist.</p>
<p>These things could add up</p>
<p>and they could, you know,</p>
<p>piss off a young group of people</p>
<p>who do what happened in Tiananmen Square</p>
<p>or in Hong Kong</p>
<p>and they could be dealing with,</p>
<p>you know, their own revolution.</p>
<p>And what if it&rsquo;s video games?</p>
<p>Revolutions have started over similarly,</p>
<p>seemingly simple acts</p>
<p>by an authoritarian government,</p>
<p>taking away people&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>to sell fruit on the street,</p>
<p>you know, famously started</p>
<p>the Spring Awakening</p>
<p>in the Middle East.</p>
<p>So you could see this, actually,</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a small chance,</p>
<p>5% or 10%,</p>
<p>you know, creating a lot of social unrest.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>All right, should we go to Texas?</p>
<p>You guys want to talk about that?</p>
<p>Speaking of social unrest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose my mind here.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>SB8 creates a private cause of action</p>
<p>that enables Texans to sue</p>
<p>those who perform or aid and abet</p>
<p>the performance of abortions</p>
<p>after a fetal heartbeat has been detected.</p>
<p>The ban comes two years</p>
<p>after abortion restrictions</p>
<p>were proposed in Georgia, Mississippi,</p>
<p>Kentucky, and Louisiana.</p>
<p>The previous propositions</p>
<p>were spoken out publicly against</p>
<p>by progressive tech companies,</p>
<p>companies with a female customer base,</p>
<p>women-led businesses.</p>
<p>That proposed bill never became law.</p>
<p>Sax, you want to just frame for us</p>
<p>the legal sort of case here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you want to go back</p>
<p>and actually frame Roe v. Wade</p>
<p>and Planned Parenthood versus Casey?</p>
<p>I think those are important</p>
<p>to understand what the hell</p>
<p>is going on here.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay, well, so, you know,</p>
<p>Roe obviously gave women</p>
<p>the right to choose,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>reproductive freedom</p>
<p>over invalidated abortion laws</p>
<p>in a very, very sweeping way.</p>
<p>Casey sort of modified Roe.</p>
<p>It upheld it but modified it</p>
<p>saying that the state</p>
<p>could impose some restrictions</p>
<p>as long as it didn&rsquo;t place</p>
<p>an undue burden.</p>
<p>That was a key term,</p>
<p>undue burden on a woman&rsquo;s right to choose.</p>
<p>And I think what was at issue</p>
<p>in that case was,</p>
<p>I think it was Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The state of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>imposed a waiting period</p>
<p>and some consultation with an advisor.</p>
<p>And so it delayed the abortion</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t restrict</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t otherwise limit it.</p>
<p>Let me add.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, Casey, Roe as modified by Casey</p>
<p>is really the law of the land right now,</p>
<p>which is the undue burden.</p>
<p>Then Texas comes along.</p>
<p>And do you want me to explain this law?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, this law is,</p>
<p>regardless of what you think about abortion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really bizarre law</p>
<p>because what it does is</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t just ban,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t ban abortion outright.</p>
<p>What it does is create</p>
<p>a private right of action.</p>
<p>Basically, a right to sue in civil court</p>
<p>anyone who aids and abets an abortion</p>
<p>after about five or six weeks.</p>
<p>Six weeks.</p>
<p>Six weeks.</p>
<p>Basically, after a fetal heartbeat</p>
<p>can be detected.</p>
<p>So, which is about six weeks</p>
<p>into the pregnancy.</p>
<p>And the way the law works is that&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, point one,</p>
<p>abortion providers are prohibited</p>
<p>from performing abortion</p>
<p>if they can detect fetal heart tones.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s six weeks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no exception for rape and incest.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really explosive politically.</p>
<p>And horrible?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s horrible as a human?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious your personal position.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s get that.</p>
<p>Let me just explain the law.</p>
<p>So, the law puts the onus of enforcement</p>
<p>on private citizens,</p>
<p>not government officials.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They do that to avoid,</p>
<p>to make it harder</p>
<p>to legally challenge this under Roe and Casey.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, what the government has done here,</p>
<p>what Texas has done is</p>
<p>it gives private citizens</p>
<p>the ability to sue abortion providers</p>
<p>or anyone who aids and abets someone</p>
<p>to get an abortion.</p>
<p>So, it could be an Uber driver.</p>
<p>It could be a friend</p>
<p>who simply drives someone</p>
<p>to the abortion clinic.</p>
<p>It could be a person</p>
<p>who provides financial assistance.</p>
<p>It could be a secretary</p>
<p>who works at the abortion clinic.</p>
<p>They can all be sued now</p>
<p>under aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s really the&hellip;</p>
<p>The person who had the abortion</p>
<p>cannot be sued,</p>
<p>but anyone who aided and abetted can be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re getting around</p>
<p>the right to choose.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the craziest part is</p>
<p>the citizens who choose to sue</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to show any connection</p>
<p>to the person they&rsquo;re suing,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even have to live in the state.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s no connection to them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no personal injury to them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re basically suing</p>
<p>under a personal injury,</p>
<p>under a civil right of action.</p>
<p>And if they succeed,</p>
<p>the law states that they&rsquo;re entitled</p>
<p>to at least $10,000 in damages</p>
<p>in addition to their legal costs.</p>
<p>So, if they win,</p>
<p>their legal costs get paid,</p>
<p>but if they lose,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to cover</p>
<p>the defendant&rsquo;s legal fees.</p>
<p>So, they just get a free shot here,</p>
<p>which is also&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a loser pay rule like this.</p>
<p>I mean, there are loser pay rules,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re symmetric.</p>
<p>So, we have an asymmetric loser pays rule.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>a civil law like this</p>
<p>where somebody can sue</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no injury to them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no standing here.</p>
<p>This is the thing that&rsquo;s fundamentally,</p>
<p>I think, at odds</p>
<p>with our entire legal tradition.</p>
<p>And I think,</p>
<p>regardless of what you think about abortion,</p>
<p>this law will eventually be invalidated</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court</p>
<p>or a lower court on that ground</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re allowing people</p>
<p>to sue without standing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a horrible precedent</p>
<p>because can you imagine if&hellip;</p>
<p>What Texas is basically doing</p>
<p>is deputizing private citizens</p>
<p>to enforce in civil courts</p>
<p>a prohibition that they cannot</p>
<p>or will not pass directly.</p>
<p>Is this the best they could come up&hellip;</p>
<p>In your&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just state a couple more facts.</p>
<p>Like, this was an extremely</p>
<p>well thought out law.</p>
<p>I think that the pro-life faction in Texas</p>
<p>clearly had some very smart</p>
<p>constitutional thinkers</p>
<p>that were able to navigate around</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade</p>
<p>and Planned Parenthood versus Casey</p>
<p>to get something written</p>
<p>that could be passed in a way</p>
<p>where, you know,</p>
<p>Sam Alito basically punted</p>
<p>and said, we&rsquo;re not going to give a stay.</p>
<p>And so this is going to have to</p>
<p>meander through the courts.</p>
<p>There is still a risk</p>
<p>that it could just get kicked down to Texas</p>
<p>and it could remain a state issue,</p>
<p>which there is a big risk.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, then,</p>
<p>you know, other states</p>
<p>could basically take a run</p>
<p>at copying this law.</p>
<p>What I wanted to talk about was</p>
<p>if you bring it all together,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>Friedberg said something about,</p>
<p>like, you know,</p>
<p>we really value personal freedom.</p>
<p>And this is where I was like,</p>
<p>cynically like,</p>
<p>no, actually, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>This is an example in my,</p>
<p>in my opinion of where this is just like,</p>
<p>we are very hypocritical where,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>if we talk about a vaccine mandate,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just an entire fiery,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>up in arms of people,</p>
<p>usually typically in the same states</p>
<p>that are very anti-abortion</p>
<p>that are like, you know,</p>
<p>you know, tread on me lightly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t touch my body.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>I have the right to decide.</p>
<p>But when it comes to this topic,</p>
<p>they abandon all of that</p>
<p>and they go to the extreme opposite side,</p>
<p>which is the government mandates.</p>
<p>And to be able to say that</p>
<p>to 50% of the population,</p>
<p>that just because you were born</p>
<p>with reproductive organs,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re treated different,</p>
<p>specifically, you know,</p>
<p>a uterus, ovaries, and a vagina,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re treated differently than a man,</p>
<p>to me just seems absolutely insane.</p>
<p>And just like fundamentally</p>
<p>just erodes this idea of equality,</p>
<p>like at just a very principled level.</p>
<p>And the even worse thing is that then,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>the corporations that actually used</p>
<p>to be on the front lines</p>
<p>of helping to drive social justice</p>
<p>so far have been completely absent, right?</p>
<p>You have to remember in 2019,</p>
<p>when we had these very repressive</p>
<p>abortion laws,</p>
<p>I think it was in Mississippi or Alabama,</p>
<p>you had all of these companies come out</p>
<p>and say, hey, no, not here,</p>
<p>not under our watch.</p>
<p>Then when you had all these</p>
<p>voter suppression laws in Georgia, right?</p>
<p>You had all these companies come out</p>
<p>and say, hey, absolutely not,</p>
<p>not on our watch.</p>
<p>We will leave the state</p>
<p>if you implement these things.</p>
<p>But so far,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve seen in this law</p>
<p>is complete radio silence in Texas.</p>
<p>And this is, you know,</p>
<p>you have to remember,</p>
<p>Texas is the ninth largest economy</p>
<p>in the world, right?</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>So you have every single kind of company</p>
<p>from technology to otherwise</p>
<p>who have chosen to either start</p>
<p>or relocate their businesses in the state.</p>
<p>And I got to think that,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>these employees and these leaders</p>
<p>of these businesses</p>
<p>should be saying something</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t said a damn thing.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you have thoughts?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll go to you, Sykes.</p>
<p>Look, I feel like</p>
<p>everyone has a limit</p>
<p>to what they believe</p>
<p>defines individual liberty.</p>
<p>You know, should everyone have</p>
<p>complete freedom to the point</p>
<p>that they can take a gun</p>
<p>and go shoot anyone that they want?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>I think even the most diehard libertarians</p>
<p>would argue that there&rsquo;s some degree of</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s sex.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>you should have the ability</p>
<p>to do whatever you want</p>
<p>within your sphere of influence</p>
<p>as long as it doesn&rsquo;t intersect</p>
<p>with the sphere of influence of others.</p>
<p>And so the philosophical argument</p>
<p>that I believe the pro-life movement made,</p>
<p>which is really a different</p>
<p>point of view on values,</p>
<p>is that the sphere of influence</p>
<p>of a fetus exists</p>
<p>at some point in time</p>
<p>and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t be invaded</p>
<p>by the mother.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not speaking,</p>
<p>obviously, my point of view.</p>
<p>My point of view is extremely pro-choice,</p>
<p>just to be very clear.</p>
<p>But the argument is, I think,</p>
<p>one that we all kind of blush over</p>
<p>and assume that it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>taking away a woman&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>without recognizing the voice</p>
<p>on the other side,</p>
<p>which says that there is a right</p>
<p>to life by a fetus</p>
<p>at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>And so to me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost like this</p>
<p>principle debate that arises,</p>
<p>and it probably certainly falls</p>
<p>more along religious lines</p>
<p>than it does along</p>
<p>on a religious spectrum</p>
<p>than it does on a</p>
<p>kind of a libertarian spectrum</p>
<p>or a spectrum of liberties</p>
<p>that kind of defines</p>
<p>that crossover point for people.</p>
<p>But clearly, Texas is a really</p>
<p>interestingly confused state, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this argument about</p>
<p>individual freedom,</p>
<p>but now what comes across</p>
<p>is a highly kind of</p>
<p>conservative point of view</p>
<p>with respect to the freedom</p>
<p>of a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there really</p>
<p>is an easy answer.</p>
<p>It certainly seems to me</p>
<p>nowadays that the pro-choice</p>
<p>movement is the majority.</p>
<p>The pro-life movement</p>
<p>is the minority.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m off on that sack.</p>
<p>You probably know better.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>this truly does set a precedent</p>
<p>that becomes kind of</p>
<p>a widespread recognition</p>
<p>of a new way of addressing</p>
<p>kind of the pro-life movement</p>
<p>or giving the pro-life movement</p>
<p>some additional movement.</p>
<p>I still think that the</p>
<p>pro-life movement remains</p>
<p>a minority.</p>
<p>And over time,</p>
<p>that will, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be perturbations,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll certainly be</p>
<p>some resolution over time</p>
<p>in favor of what I think</p>
<p>the majority&hellip;</p>
<p>Where are all the politically</p>
<p>correct people?</p>
<p>Where are they?</p>
<p>Where are they right now?</p>
<p>Where are all the politically&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I guess they were happy</p>
<p>to get Mike Richards</p>
<p>or whatever the guy&rsquo;s name was</p>
<p>fired from Jeopardy last week,</p>
<p>but where are they now</p>
<p>when we really need them?</p>
<p>But Chamath,</p>
<p>are you really saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough outrage</p>
<p>about this?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m seeing a ton</p>
<p>of outrage on social media</p>
<p>about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see everything.</p>
<p>I see nothing.</p>
<p>I see a lot of useless</p>
<p>virtue signaling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually organized.</p>
<p>My prediction is gonna be</p>
<p>a million-person march</p>
<p>within 45 days.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me go back</p>
<p>to Chamath&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>about whether, you know,</p>
<p>he called this bill smart</p>
<p>in the sense that it was</p>
<p>really thought through.</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s a deliberate</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade</p>
<p>and make it harder</p>
<p>to sustain a legal challenge</p>
<p>against it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think this is smart.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>philosophically,</p>
<p>politically,</p>
<p>and legally</p>
<p>for the&hellip;</p>
<p>even for the people</p>
<p>who are in charge</p>
<p>of this bill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is smart.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>philosophically,</p>
<p>politically,</p>
<p>and legally</p>
<p>even for the pro-life movement.</p>
<p>So, philosophically,</p>
<p>I think the problem here is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>unlimited standing</p>
<p>to sue</p>
<p>across state boundaries</p>
<p>by somebody</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t even experienced harm.</p>
<p>I mean, this is so far</p>
<p>from what conservative</p>
<p>jurists and legal scholars</p>
<p>have always professed to believe.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember</p>
<p>20 years ago,</p>
<p>tort reform</p>
<p>and ending frivolous lawsuits</p>
<p>was the absolute bedrock plank</p>
<p>of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re just throwing</p>
<p>that out the window here</p>
<p>with unknown consequences.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t this be used</p>
<p>to circumvent</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s Second Amendment rights?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you just create</p>
<p>a private right of action</p>
<p>to sue anyone</p>
<p>who could,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>aid and abetted</p>
<p>a gun crime?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So, I think this is going</p>
<p>to boomerang</p>
<p>on conservatives.</p>
<p>Second&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait, okay.</p>
<p>Let me get to the</p>
<p>political stupidity of it.</p>
<p>Henry Belcaster wanted</p>
<p>this as one piece</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>so much editing.</p>
<p>No, look.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>has a great editorial today.</p>
<p>Okay, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>editorial page</p>
<p>is a great piece.</p>
<p>This is from&hellip;</p>
<p>They basically say,</p>
<p>look, they said,</p>
<p>sometimes we wonder</p>
<p>if Texas Attorney General</p>
<p>Ken Paxton</p>
<p>is a progressive plant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the guy behind this.</p>
<p>His ill-conceived</p>
<p>legal attack against Obamacare</p>
<p>backfired Republicans</p>
<p>in last year&rsquo;s election</p>
<p>and lost at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Now, he is leading</p>
<p>with his chin on abortion.</p>
<p>How about thinking first?</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re pretty clear</p>
<p>this is going to get overturned.</p>
<p>And frankly,</p>
<p>then politically,</p>
<p>this is just handed.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>Democrats are already</p>
<p>having a field day with this.</p>
<p>So, Biden said,</p>
<p>this law is so extreme</p>
<p>it does not even allow</p>
<p>for exceptions</p>
<p>in the case of rape and incest.</p>
<p>I mean, look,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s right about that.</p>
<p>And Gavin Newsom,</p>
<p>the polling for him</p>
<p>is now going through the roof</p>
<p>because all he has to do</p>
<p>for the next 10 days</p>
<p>is talk about</p>
<p>right to choose</p>
<p>in this Texas bill</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to cruise</p>
<p>towards defeating the recall</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>something differently than I was.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is something very specific.</p>
<p>If you go back to Roe v. Wade,</p>
<p>it was written by a man,</p>
<p>first of all,</p>
<p>which, you know,</p>
<p>we can debate</p>
<p>whether that makes</p>
<p>any fucking sense.</p>
<p>But Harry Blackmun</p>
<p>went to the Mayo Clinic</p>
<p>and lived there</p>
<p>for like six or eight weeks</p>
<p>reading medical textbooks</p>
<p>and came up with</p>
<p>this trimester framework.</p>
<p>And again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to go out on a limb</p>
<p>and say I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a fucking clue</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Harry Blackmun did,</p>
<p>even though he was</p>
<p>much smarter than I</p>
<p>And then Casey</p>
<p>tried to clean this up</p>
<p>by going to this</p>
<p>fetal viability thing.</p>
<p>So we have this law</p>
<p>that was really</p>
<p>kind of ill-conceived</p>
<p>but was kind of going</p>
<p>in the right direction</p>
<p>but it was really</p>
<p>a very first form</p>
<p>of judicial activism.</p>
<p>We tried to clean it up</p>
<p>in the early 90s</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always been</p>
<p>an issue</p>
<p>where eventually</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really been happening</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve been pushing</p>
<p>this to a state&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right issue.</p>
<p>And I think that</p>
<p>the cleverness</p>
<p>of this bill</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>but it was very well</p>
<p>thought out.</p>
<p>This was not</p>
<p>a random thing</p>
<p>where two haphazard</p>
<p>dipshits got together</p>
<p>and wrote this bill,</p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>I think that this was</p>
<p>methodically planned out</p>
<p>for years.</p>
<p>They are dipshits though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally going to</p>
<p>backfire on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>David,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>we now have</p>
<p>an activist</p>
<p>Supreme Court</p>
<p>who may actually</p>
<p>not opine on this</p>
<p>on the validity</p>
<p>of the issue</p>
<p>but say this is a</p>
<p>state&rsquo;s right issue.</p>
<p>If this stays in Texas</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>outside of Texas</p>
<p>you will have</p>
<p>this specific thing</p>
<p>hold and stand.</p>
<p>And I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>bad precedent</p>
<p>to have set.</p>
<p>I think that these folks</p>
<p>planned this out</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they thought that</p>
<p>it was an easy way</p>
<p>to overturn it</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>when everybody</p>
<p>was waiting with</p>
<p>bated breath</p>
<p>for Alito to</p>
<p>basically stay this</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Listen, I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>hysteria and hyperbole</p>
<p>on social media</p>
<p>right now saying that</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been overturned.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court</p>
<p>has overturned Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>because the Supreme Court</p>
<p>ruled on very narrow</p>
<p>procedural grounds</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t ready</p>
<p>to hear about</p>
<p>the Texas law</p>
<p>because a harm</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been committed yet</p>
<p>but they haven&rsquo;t said</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t look at it</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>I believe they will.</p>
<p>I believe that this</p>
<p>law will be found</p>
<p>unconstitutional</p>
<p>not necessarily</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Not necessarily</p>
<p>because of abortion</p>
<p>but just because</p>
<p>there is</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re changing</p>
<p>the legal definition</p>
<p>of standing</p>
<p>in a way that</p>
<p>flies against</p>
<p>everything we know</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>court system works.</p>
<p>I just</p>
<p>I think ultimately</p>
<p>this is too clever</p>
<p>by half</p>
<p>by the</p>
<p>by the state</p>
<p>attorney general.</p>
<p>I think it was</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a tool.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do we want to move on</p>
<p>and talk about</p>
<p>Apple allowing people</p>
<p>to link to their</p>
<p>own websites?</p>
<p>The Apple thing</p>
<p>is really big news</p>
<p>because it kind of</p>
<p>goes to show you that</p>
<p>you had</p>
<p>you had a pretty</p>
<p>progressive</p>
<p>legislative framework</p>
<p>in South Korea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>particularly a huge</p>
<p>market for Apple</p>
<p>because most of the</p>
<p>most of the</p>
<p>app activity</p>
<p>I think is Android</p>
<p>more than it is</p>
<p>Apple.</p>
<p>But they basically</p>
<p>just seeded the market</p>
<p>and by deciding to</p>
<p>basically conform</p>
<p>to this law</p>
<p>then then</p>
<p>they started with</p>
<p>these reader apps</p>
<p>and allowing</p>
<p>payments</p>
<p>along the</p>
<p>link.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning</p>
<p>of the beginning</p>
<p>for you know</p>
<p>the app stores</p>
<p>to be deconstructed</p>
<p>and opened.</p>
<p>This just so people</p>
<p>could use the media</p>
<p>apps to create</p>
<p>in-app links</p>
<p>to sign up</p>
<p>pages on</p>
<p>those companies</p>
<p>websites allowing</p>
<p>the likes of</p>
<p>Spotify and Netflix</p>
<p>to bypass the</p>
<p>iPhone makers</p>
<p>cut of subscriptions.</p>
<p>Now of course</p>
<p>you can use</p>
<p>Spotify and Netflix</p>
<p>on your phone</p>
<p>but you may have</p>
<p>probably people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t experienced</p>
<p>this because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>become members</p>
<p>of it and did it</p>
<p>on their site</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually pay</p>
<p>through your</p>
<p>phone and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sign up</p>
<p>through the media</p>
<p>folks.</p>
<p>So what do you</p>
<p>think Saks?</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>Tramath has</p>
<p>kind of said this</p>
<p>the beginning of the</p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some truth to</p>
<p>that look I</p>
<p>think the</p>
<p>root of this</p>
<p>is the fact</p>
<p>that Apple</p>
<p>has this 30 percent</p>
<p>rate on any</p>
<p>in-app purchases</p>
<p>and like</p>
<p>Bill Gurley</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>rake too far</p>
<p>right just because</p>
<p>you can charge 30</p>
<p>percent</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you should charge</p>
<p>30 percent.</p>
<p>So I think</p>
<p>this 30 percent</p>
<p>rake has</p>
<p>ultimately</p>
<p>backfired on</p>
<p>Apple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s created a</p>
<p>huge backlash</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying the</p>
<p>price.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>had to roll it</p>
<p>back for these</p>
<p>so-called reader</p>
<p>apps.</p>
<p>So you know</p>
<p>if what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is</p>
<p>buying a</p>
<p>subscription</p>
<p>to say</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>or Amazon</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>buying a</p>
<p>subscription</p>
<p>to say</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Netflix will</p>
<p>now be able to</p>
<p>redirect you to</p>
<p>the website you</p>
<p>can buy it there</p>
<p>and then consume</p>
<p>the content</p>
<p>you know on</p>
<p>your iOS app</p>
<p>without Apple</p>
<p>getting a</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>split but</p>
<p>this now opens</p>
<p>the door for</p>
<p>this type of</p>
<p>thing to apply</p>
<p>to games as</p>
<p>well where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>more in-app</p>
<p>purchases like</p>
<p>like Fortnite</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>So I just</p>
<p>think this is a</p>
<p>case where you</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening</p>
<p>right now is</p>
<p>Apple is</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>slaughtered</p>
<p>Apple has</p>
<p>been a</p>
<p>hog and</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>slaughtered.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way I</p>
<p>want to point</p>
<p>out like this</p>
<p>is a really</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>experience of</p>
<p>the free</p>
<p>market you</p>
<p>know clearly</p>
<p>consumers and</p>
<p>the developers</p>
<p>on the apps</p>
<p>in the app</p>
<p>store ecosystem</p>
<p>were vocal and</p>
<p>angry enough</p>
<p>that that</p>
<p>is important</p>
<p>and relevant</p>
<p>that is that</p>
<p>yes the market</p>
<p>is functional</p>
<p>the market is</p>
<p>functional and</p>
<p>having the</p>
<p>government and</p>
<p>regulators come</p>
<p>in and you</p>
<p>know people</p>
<p>complaining to</p>
<p>the Senate</p>
<p>about Google</p>
<p>and Apple</p>
<p>monopolizing them</p>
<p>out of their</p>
<p>businesses</p>
<p>ultimately gets</p>
<p>resolved when</p>
<p>enough there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enough kind of</p>
<p>collective mass</p>
<p>from the</p>
<p>consumer slash</p>
<p>partner that</p>
<p>says to the</p>
<p>the big</p>
<p>Apple think</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>enough fear here</p>
<p>right to kind of</p>
<p>to kind of get</p>
<p>start giving</p>
<p>concessions right</p>
<p>some modest</p>
<p>concession that</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a Spotify or</p>
<p>a Netflix or</p>
<p>audible we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna let you buy</p>
<p>through the app</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>regulation and</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>well yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>this is a nice win</p>
<p>for the free</p>
<p>market</p>
<p>yeah I do</p>
<p>well look I</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>monopolies are</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>letting monopolies do</p>
<p>whatever they want</p>
<p>is free market</p>
<p>okay I mean</p>
<p>the monopolies</p>
<p>and competition</p>
<p>they will squash</p>
<p>innovation</p>
<p>they will you know</p>
<p>they will</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>get in the way</p>
<p>of permissionless</p>
<p>innovation so</p>
<p>I you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in favor of</p>
<p>reigning in these</p>
<p>monopolies and</p>
<p>the two big</p>
<p>issues I think</p>
<p>with Apple and</p>
<p>Google well</p>
<p>Apple especially</p>
<p>is number one</p>
<p>side loading of</p>
<p>apps so the idea</p>
<p>that they have</p>
<p>total control over</p>
<p>the iOS device</p>
<p>people want the</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>create alternative</p>
<p>app stores that</p>
<p>already exists for</p>
<p>Android right so</p>
<p>I think that is</p>
<p>coming for Apple</p>
<p>Apple claims it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a security issue</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>it is I mean</p>
<p>what they should do</p>
<p>is if you click on</p>
<p>low side load</p>
<p>apps it should just</p>
<p>give you a warning</p>
<p>you are no longer</p>
<p>protected by us</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re subjecting</p>
<p>yourself to phishing</p>
<p>scams your</p>
<p>information and</p>
<p>buyer beware and</p>
<p>then people can make</p>
<p>their own decision</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought</p>
<p>that was a good</p>
<p>decision for what</p>
<p>I like about this</p>
<p>is I think this</p>
<p>gives Apple the</p>
<p>ability to now</p>
<p>just compete against</p>
<p>everybody in the</p>
<p>app store without</p>
<p>having to have</p>
<p>this you know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re partners</p>
<p>with you they are</p>
<p>not partners with</p>
<p>people in the app</p>
<p>store they watch</p>
<p>the app store and</p>
<p>when something great</p>
<p>comes and emerges</p>
<p>they will copy it</p>
<p>they just do it</p>
<p>slower than Facebook</p>
<p>so Apple music</p>
<p>studied Spotify</p>
<p>and they created</p>
<p>their own Apple</p>
<p>product Apple TV</p>
<p>plus now with</p>
<p>Netflix they watch</p>
<p>Netflix and I</p>
<p>signed up for Apple</p>
<p>Arcade for my</p>
<p>daughters because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want them to</p>
<p>be paying for</p>
<p>like in-app</p>
<p>purchases I&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>just have the games</p>
<p>be stop upselling</p>
<p>them and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been wonderful for</p>
<p>five or ten bucks a</p>
<p>month to have that</p>
<p>and I pay for the</p>
<p>news product so now</p>
<p>they can just compete</p>
<p>against everybody</p>
<p>directly I think all</p>
<p>of these media</p>
<p>companies are going</p>
<p>to be video games</p>
<p>podcasts TV shows</p>
<p>and music so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>saw Netflix is going</p>
<p>to be doing podcasts</p>
<p>about their shows and</p>
<p>video games I think</p>
<p>Amazon will be</p>
<p>video games content</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all going to be</p>
<p>one thing and Disney</p>
<p>plus will have games</p>
<p>built into Disney plus</p>
<p>I bet in that</p>
<p>subscription price so</p>
<p>the consumer is going</p>
<p>to win ultimately</p>
<p>you know I think</p>
<p>monopolies are good</p>
<p>because monopolies</p>
<p>are just like lazy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easier to</p>
<p>innovate and compete</p>
<p>against a monopoly to</p>
<p>be honest than it is</p>
<p>to compete against</p>
<p>cronyism when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>embedded kind of</p>
<p>government regulation</p>
<p>that prevents</p>
<p>monopolies from</p>
<p>competing against</p>
<p>government regulation</p>
<p>that prevents</p>
<p>emerging competitors</p>
<p>from competing</p>
<p>effectively it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot harder to win</p>
<p>than against some</p>
<p>slow big</p>
<p>uninnovative monopoly</p>
<p>and well yeah go</p>
<p>ahead well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>argument so I agree</p>
<p>with you that big</p>
<p>slow lumbering</p>
<p>monopolies can be</p>
<p>great to compete</p>
<p>against but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem when</p>
<p>they could pull</p>
<p>access to an</p>
<p>ecosystem when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gatekeepers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>because now you have</p>
<p>to go to them and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>slow lumbering</p>
<p>monopolies and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>slow lumbering and</p>
<p>stupid in terms of</p>
<p>allowing you to</p>
<p>innovate and when</p>
<p>they see you</p>
<p>becoming a threat</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll squawk to</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem if these</p>
<p>guys didn&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>platforms that would</p>
<p>be one thing but</p>
<p>they control the</p>
<p>most important</p>
<p>platform there is</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>operating system so</p>
<p>I just think that</p>
<p>you know this is</p>
<p>Microsoft and</p>
<p>Windows all over</p>
<p>again except there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two of them right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s iOS and</p>
<p>Android and</p>
<p>Microsoft example</p>
<p>you could load</p>
<p>whatever software you</p>
<p>want into the</p>
<p>operating system and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just saying</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>you Internet Explorer</p>
<p>with the operating</p>
<p>system so this is</p>
<p>even worse I mean</p>
<p>right Apple said</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>install your app</p>
<p>yeah Microsoft was</p>
<p>actually pretty open by</p>
<p>comparison but but</p>
<p>there is like a</p>
<p>version of bundling</p>
<p>here what Spotify</p>
<p>said is look when</p>
<p>we have to pay 30%</p>
<p>and Apple Music</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to pay</p>
<p>anything we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compete with that</p>
<p>you know and they</p>
<p>have a point there</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>completely valid</p>
<p>point California&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on fire this is</p>
<p>the fourth year in a</p>
<p>row this has gotten</p>
<p>acute for the Bay</p>
<p>Area people are</p>
<p>now making plans as</p>
<p>Freeberg mentioned</p>
<p>on the last spot I</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or two pods ago</p>
<p>there was like two</p>
<p>or three weeks of</p>
<p>the year maybe even</p>
<p>a month where you</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t really be</p>
<p>outside and do</p>
<p>stuff in Northern</p>
<p>California you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be outside</p>
<p>have you seen</p>
<p>our friends yeah</p>
<p>three of the three</p>
<p>of our friends have</p>
<p>been evacuated</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>they they moved up</p>
<p>there in the middle</p>
<p>of the pandemic they</p>
<p>had to come down</p>
<p>they said it was</p>
<p>you know one of our</p>
<p>friends&rsquo;s homes is is</p>
<p>literally threatened</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like and then the</p>
<p>fire season is moving</p>
<p>up earlier and earlier</p>
<p>in the year you know</p>
<p>my kids were in</p>
<p>camp in Tahoe this</p>
<p>this July and they</p>
<p>had to be evacuated</p>
<p>and fortunately for</p>
<p>us you know we had a</p>
<p>really good friend of</p>
<p>ours a neighbor here</p>
<p>whose whose kids were</p>
<p>also at that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to drive up in</p>
<p>the but my god like</p>
<p>that was you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about eight</p>
<p>trillion dollars</p>
<p>worth of</p>
<p>evacuees in</p>
<p>California</p>
<p>and you know if you</p>
<p>assume a tenth of</p>
<p>that is exposed</p>
<p>in the middle of</p>
<p>this kind of</p>
<p>dense fire</p>
<p>these dense fire</p>
<p>regions let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trillion</p>
<p>dollars but the</p>
<p>trillion dollars a</p>
<p>real estate value</p>
<p>that you cannot</p>
<p>insure anymore</p>
<p>so I had an idea</p>
<p>about this free</p>
<p>burg I was</p>
<p>looking two or</p>
<p>three years ago</p>
<p>when these fires</p>
<p>started maybe it</p>
<p>was four or five</p>
<p>years ago now for</p>
<p>a blanket that</p>
<p>could go over a</p>
<p>home could be</p>
<p>insured and</p>
<p>insured and</p>
<p>could go over a</p>
<p>home could be</p>
<p>installed or</p>
<p>dropped over a</p>
<p>home with</p>
<p>helicopters I</p>
<p>know this sounds</p>
<p>crazy but is</p>
<p>there a material</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s light</p>
<p>enough that you</p>
<p>could put it on a</p>
<p>helicopter and</p>
<p>drop it over one</p>
<p>of these yeah</p>
<p>yeah well why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t the startup</p>
<p>exist I mean</p>
<p>this would be</p>
<p>amazing imagine</p>
<p>if these homes</p>
<p>had on the</p>
<p>roof some</p>
<p>sort of a system</p>
<p>that when fire</p>
<p>heat got there</p>
<p>just deployed the</p>
<p>blanket and</p>
<p>protected the</p>
<p>home from</p>
<p>the flames and</p>
<p>fires and</p>
<p>the fire</p>
<p>insurance</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>becoming</p>
<p>kind of a</p>
<p>predominant</p>
<p>factor in</p>
<p>California</p>
<p>particularly in</p>
<p>all the</p>
<p>areas with</p>
<p>lots of</p>
<p>forest land</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hundred million</p>
<p>acres of</p>
<p>forest land</p>
<p>in California</p>
<p>so if a</p>
<p>trillion</p>
<p>dollars of</p>
<p>real estate</p>
<p>is actually</p>
<p>exposed to</p>
<p>fires and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything</p>
<p>about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>be a</p>
<p>massive</p>
<p>loss</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ultimately</p>
<p>the federal</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>have these</p>
<p>like Katrina</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>hurricane</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>all these</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>that are</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>happen</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>massive</p>
<p>shift in</p>
<p>economic</p>
<p>value that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>have to pay</p>
<p>for over the</p>
<p>next decade</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>just the</p>
<p>beginning of</p>
<p>it all is</p>
<p>my is my</p>
<p>strong belief</p>
<p>I tweeted</p>
<p>this out about</p>
<p>maybe six or</p>
<p>seven months</p>
<p>ago but</p>
<p>with another</p>
<p>with this</p>
<p>fabulous</p>
<p>entrepreneur</p>
<p>named David</p>
<p>Soloff I</p>
<p>co-founded</p>
<p>climate</p>
<p>insurance</p>
<p>and you</p>
<p>know we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been trying</p>
<p>to build</p>
<p>models and</p>
<p>price</p>
<p>this kind</p>
<p>of insurance</p>
<p>climate</p>
<p>insurance</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>kinds of</p>
<p>like disruptions</p>
<p>civil unrest</p>
<p>insurance</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>are very</p>
<p>typical</p>
<p>atypical</p>
<p>sorry and</p>
<p>to your</p>
<p>point</p>
<p>freeberg</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>really really</p>
<p>hard to</p>
<p>be a</p>
<p>provider of</p>
<p>this kind</p>
<p>of insurance</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning is</p>
<p>man these and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re negotiating</p>
<p>multi hundred</p>
<p>million dollar</p>
<p>policies with</p>
<p>these big</p>
<p>corporates</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>they want</p>
<p>pandemic</p>
<p>insurance if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>next delta</p>
<p>variant or</p>
<p>whatever and</p>
<p>I have to</p>
<p>shut down my</p>
<p>facility and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>house burns</p>
<p>down yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard so</p>
<p>this kind of</p>
<p>parametric</p>
<p>insurance doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist which</p>
<p>means that if</p>
<p>you live in</p>
<p>any of these</p>
<p>areas like I</p>
<p>basically I</p>
<p>think what it</p>
<p>means is that</p>
<p>climate change</p>
<p>is going to</p>
<p>ravage suburbs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to ravage these</p>
<p>sort of like</p>
<p>far-flung</p>
<p>communities</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to want</p>
<p>to step in</p>
<p>there and</p>
<p>ensure the</p>
<p>parametric risk</p>
<p>of climate</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>you can buy</p>
<p>weather insurance</p>
<p>online and</p>
<p>you underwrite</p>
<p>the risk and</p>
<p>the way you</p>
<p>underwrite risk</p>
<p>like this and</p>
<p>auto insurance and</p>
<p>any kind of</p>
<p>insurance is you</p>
<p>look at past</p>
<p>data you build a</p>
<p>statistical model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s represented</p>
<p>by the past data</p>
<p>and the frequency</p>
<p>of certain things</p>
<p>happening and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>price the</p>
<p>insurance.</p>
<p>The problem</p>
<p>now is the</p>
<p>past data has</p>
<p>absolutely no</p>
<p>information about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>like fires</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>something no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good at.</p>
<p>No one</p>
<p>has any</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>do because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen this</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen</p>
<p>hot year</p>
<p>after hot</p>
<p>year, dry</p>
<p>year after</p>
<p>dry year.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way to do</p>
<p>this and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>build homes</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Talk about</p>
<p>functioning markets.</p>
<p>I think what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re realizing</p>
<p>is the market</p>
<p>now is so</p>
<p>convinced that</p>
<p>global warming</p>
<p>is real and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deny it that</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>insure for it</p>
<p>therefore we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to</p>
<p>make serious</p>
<p>societal changes</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of this process.</p>
<p>Insurance being</p>
<p>denied for</p>
<p>hurricane zones</p>
<p>and insurance</p>
<p>being denied</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>climate</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>accepting the</p>
<p>reality that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing enough.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>J. Cal, the</p>
<p>problem is not</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>denied, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to</p>
<p>be able to</p>
<p>get it and</p>
<p>if you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>able to</p>
<p>afford it.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even that</p>
<p>people are</p>
<p>really open</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what everybody</p>
<p>wants.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to change</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>I mean, we</p>
<p>saw now in</p>
<p>Florida and</p>
<p>other places,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>Louisiana, other</p>
<p>places that are</p>
<p>flood zones,</p>
<p>nobody builds</p>
<p>on the ground</p>
<p>floor anymore.</p>
<p>Everybody</p>
<p>builds, you</p>
<p>know, on</p>
<p>stilts and</p>
<p>they put a</p>
<p>car garage</p>
<p>underneath it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>flood it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take</p>
<p>one hour.</p>
<p>15 people, my</p>
<p>understanding,</p>
<p>has died in</p>
<p>basement apartments</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t or</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>out in time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>hard to</p>
<p>understand,</p>
<p>but I guess</p>
<p>people stayed</p>
<p>in their</p>
<p>apartments while</p>
<p>they were</p>
<p>filling up</p>
<p>with water</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>it broke</p>
<p>through.</p>
<p>Did you see</p>
<p>the video of</p>
<p>the flood</p>
<p>waters ripping</p>
<p>into the</p>
<p>ground?</p>
<p>When we build</p>
<p>new structures,</p>
<p>the first floor</p>
<p>is going to be</p>
<p>built like they</p>
<p>built them in</p>
<p>Miami, which is</p>
<p>for water to</p>
<p>flow straight</p>
<p>through them.</p>
<p>And the</p>
<p>garages underneath</p>
<p>are designed</p>
<p>to accept</p>
<p>massive flood</p>
<p>waters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>spending a lot</p>
<p>of time on</p>
<p>water recently</p>
<p>and the thing</p>
<p>that I learned</p>
<p>this week,</p>
<p>which, not the</p>
<p>thing that I</p>
<p>learned, but a</p>
<p>great way to</p>
<p>summarize this</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>when we have</p>
<p>extreme</p>
<p>dryness or</p>
<p>heat, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>extreme.</p>
<p>And when it</p>
<p>rains, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be so</p>
<p>extreme and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to get</p>
<p>buffeted back</p>
<p>and forth</p>
<p>between these</p>
<p>two extremes</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>only going to</p>
<p>escalate over</p>
<p>the next</p>
<p>20 years or</p>
<p>30 years</p>
<p>because we</p>
<p>have so much</p>
<p>embedded</p>
<p>pollution that</p>
<p>we have to</p>
<p>work our</p>
<p>asses off</p>
<p>to actually</p>
<p>fix it.</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>was all</p>
<p>over</p>
<p>my head.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>why is</p>
<p>this so</p>
<p>unprecedented.</p>
<p>What</p>
<p>wait this</p>
<p>is my</p>
<p>god damn</p>
<p>birthday</p>
<p>guys.</p>
<p>What the</p>
<p>fuck.</p>
<p>Happy</p>
<p>birthday,</p>
<p>the happy</p>
<p>birthday women&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rights are</p>
<p>being taken</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>The planet</p>
<p>is on fire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it</p>
<p>like nuts</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty exciting.</p>
<p>I like the</p>
<p>way you</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>entrepreneurs</p>
<p>because I</p>
<p>say it</p>
<p>entrepreneurs</p>
<p>but you</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very literal</p>
<p>pronunciation of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>look, I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>real</p>
<p>schwing</p>
<p>galley</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>word</p>
<p>yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good</p>
<p>news</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Colin&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>really well.</p>
<p>Great</p>
<p>long.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>look, I</p>
<p>think I</p>
<p>think that</p>
<p>in terms</p>
<p>of processing</p>
<p>all the</p>
<p>bad news,</p>
<p>I do</p>
<p>think we</p>
<p>have a</p>
<p>tendency to</p>
<p>underestimate</p>
<p>how much</p>
<p>political</p>
<p>partisans</p>
<p>sort of</p>
<p>whip things</p>
<p>up in any</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>pretty</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>to talk</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>Joe</p>
<p>Rogan got</p>
<p>COVID.</p>
<p>He was</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>misframed</p>
<p>what he</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>saw the</p>
<p>original</p>
<p>quote where</p>
<p>he said</p>
<p>should a</p>
<p>young</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>get</p>
<p>COVID?</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>then he</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>had to</p>
<p>cancel some</p>
<p>shows.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>funny here</p>
<p>but also</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>serious here</p>
<p>about the</p>
<p>way the</p>
<p>media covers</p>
<p>news like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>First of</p>
<p>all, the</p>
<p>media is</p>
<p>positively</p>
<p>gleeful</p>
<p>whenever they</p>
<p>can report</p>
<p>news like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>whether</p>
<p>Ivermectin</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>helpful</p>
<p>treatment or</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>think you</p>
<p>have to do</p>
<p>a double</p>
<p>blind</p>
<p>study to</p>
<p>figure that</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>also think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dishonest to</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>describing</p>
<p>Ivermectin</p>
<p>as a</p>
<p>horse</p>
<p>dewormer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>treatment</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>Humans</p>
<p>do take it</p>
<p>as a</p>
<p>treatment</p>
<p>against</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>parasites.</p>
<p>It also</p>
<p>happens to</p>
<p>have a</p>
<p>benefit in</p>
<p>deworming</p>
<p>horses but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of its</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>describe this</p>
<p>drug as</p>
<p>a horse</p>
<p>dewormer</p>
<p>as if it</p>
<p>was the</p>
<p>opposite</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>horse</p>
<p>dewormer.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>whether</p>
<p>Ivermectin</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>treatment</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>horses.</p>
