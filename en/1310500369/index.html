    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>As I said two years ago, when I first met and spoke with Sam,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the most influential pioneering thinkers of our time</p>
<p>as the host of the Making Sense podcast, creator of the Waking Up app</p>
<p>and the author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind,</p>
<p>including The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape, Lying, Free Will and Waking Up.</p>
<p>In this conversation, besides our mutual fascination with AGI and free will,</p>
<p>we do also go deep into controversial, challenging topics of Donald Trump,</p>
<p>Hunter Biden, January 6th, vaccines, lab leak, Kanye West,</p>
<p>and several key figures at the center of public discourse,</p>
<p>including Joe Rogan and Elon Musk,</p>
<p>both of whom have been friends of Sam and have become friends of mine.</p>
<p>Somehow, in an amazing life trajectory that I do not deserve in any way</p>
<p>and in fact believe is probably a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s all right, please allow me to say a few words</p>
<p>about this personal aspect of the conversation of discussing Joe, Elon and others.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been weighing heavy on my heart since the beginning of the pandemic,</p>
<p>now three years ago, is that many people I look to for wisdom in public discourse</p>
<p>stop talking to each other as often, with respect, humility and love,</p>
<p>when the world needed those kinds of conversations the most.</p>
<p>My hope is that they start talking again, they start being friends again,</p>
<p>they start noticing the humanity that connects them,</p>
<p>that is much deeper than the disagreements that divide them.</p>
<p>So let me take this moment to say with humility and honesty</p>
<p>why I look up to and I&rsquo;m inspired by Joe, Elon and Sam.</p>
<p>I think Joe Rogan is important to the world</p>
<p>as a voice of compassionate curiosity and open-mindedness</p>
<p>to ideas, both radical and mainstream, sometimes with humor,</p>
<p>sometimes with brutal honesty, always pushing for more kindness in the world.</p>
<p>I think Elon Musk is important to the world as an engineer, leader,</p>
<p>entrepreneur and human being who takes on the hardest problems</p>
<p>that face humanity and refuses to accept the constraints</p>
<p>of conventional thinking that made the solutions to these problems seem impossible.</p>
<p>I think Sam Harris is important to the world as a fearless voice</p>
<p>who fights for the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers</p>
<p>and audience capture, taking unpopular perspectives</p>
<p>and defending them with rigor and resilience.</p>
<p>I both celebrate and criticize all three privately,</p>
<p>and they criticize me, usually more effectively,</p>
<p>for which I always learn a lot and always appreciate.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is respect and love for each other as human beings.</p>
<p>The very thing that I think the world needs most now in a time of division and chaos.</p>
<p>I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to understand, not deride,</p>
<p>to turn the other cheek if needed, to return hate with love.</p>
<p>Sometimes people criticize me for being naive, cheesy, simplistic, all that.</p>
<p>I know, I agree, but I really am speaking from the heart and I&rsquo;m trying.</p>
<p>This world is too fucking beautiful not to try in whatever way I know how.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Notion for AI powered note-taking and team collaboration.</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring great teams and a masterclass for online learning.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our team, we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you must skip them, please</p>
<p>still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Notion, a note-taking and team collaboration</p>
<p>tool, my favorite note-taking and team collaboration tool.</p>
<p>And they have a new feature, Notion AI that I&rsquo;ve been using and loving.</p>
<p>And this thing is probably the best implementation of a system that</p>
<p>uses a language model to generate text.</p>
<p>Because it integrates across the entirety of your note-taking process.</p>
<p>And it adds just a giant number of small and big features that help you</p>
<p>out, that save a lot of time, but also make everything more fun and creatively</p>
<p>sort of inject ideas into your workflow.</p>
<p>So just to list some features, they can edit the voice and tone of the</p>
<p>text you already wrote, so they can rewrite it in a different tone.</p>
<p>They can make the text, which I love, they can make it shorter or longer.</p>
<p>Also, they can simplify the text, which to me is at the core of the writing</p>
<p>process, make things as simple as possible, but not simpler as Einstein said.</p>
<p>And to have tools that give you ideas how to do that, not necessarily</p>
<p>completely automate everything, but give you really powerful ideas</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just really fun to listen to him, to listen to him discuss what he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good at that was true on the podcast.</p>

<p>systematically breaks down his ideas of what it takes to negotiate with</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Sam Harris.</p>
<p>What is more effective at making a net positive impact on the world?</p>
<p>Empathy or reason?</p>
<p>It depends on what you mean by empathy.</p>
<p>There are two, at least two kinds of empathy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the, the cognitive form, which is, you know, I would argue even</p>
<p>a species of reason, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just understanding another person&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>of view, you know, you understand why they&rsquo;re suffering or why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy or what, you know, just, you have a theory of mind about another</p>
<p>human being that is, is accurate.</p>
<p>And so you can, you can navigate in relationship to them more effectively.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another layer entirely, not incompatible with that, but</p>
<p>just distinct, which is what people often mean by empathy.</p>
<p>Which is more a kind of emotional contagion, right?</p>
<p>Like you feel depressed and I begin to feel depressed along with you</p>
<p>because, you know, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s contagious, right?</p>
<p>I, I, you know, we&rsquo;re so close and I&rsquo;m so, I&rsquo;m so concerned about you and</p>
<p>your problems become my problems and it bleeds through right now.</p>
<p>I think both of those capacities are very important, but the emotional</p>
<p>contagion piece, and this is not really my thesis, this is something I have</p>
<p>more or less learned from, from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a</p>
<p>book on this topic titled Against Empathy.</p>
<p>The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide rather often for ethical</p>
<p>behavior and ethical intuitions.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>And, uh, so I&rsquo;ll give you the clear example of this, which is, uh, we find</p>
<p>stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly</p>
<p>empathize with far more compelling than data, right?</p>
<p>So if I tell you, you know, this is the classic case of the little</p>
<p>girl who falls down a well, right?</p>
<p>You know, this is some, somebody&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>You see the parents, uh, distraught on television.</p>
<p>Uh, you hear her cries from the bottom of the well, the whole country stops.</p>
<p>I mean, this, there was an example of this, you know, 20, 25 years ago, I think</p>
<p>where it was just wall to wall on CNN.</p>
<p>This is just the perfect use of CNN.</p>
<p>It was, you know, 72 hours or whatever it was of continuous coverage of</p>
<p>just extracting this girl from a well.</p>
<p>So we effortlessly pay attention to that.</p>
<p>We care about it.</p>
<p>We will donate money toward it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it marshals a hundred percent of our</p>
<p>compassion and altruistic impulse.</p>
<p>Um, whereas if you hear that there&rsquo;s a genocide raging in some country, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been to, and it never intended to go to, and the numbers don&rsquo;t make a dent.</p>
<p>And the, and we, we find the story boring, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll change the channel in the face of a genocide, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So it literally, perversely, it could be 500,000 little girls have fallen</p>
<p>down wells in that country, and we still don&rsquo;t care, right?</p>
<p>So, um, it&rsquo;s, uh, you know, many of us have come to believe that this is a bug</p>
<p>rather than a feature of our moral psychology, and so the empathy</p>
<p>plays an unhelpful role there.</p>
<p>So ultimately I think when we&rsquo;re making big decisions about what we should do and</p>
<p>how to mitigate human suffering and what&rsquo;s worth valuing and how we should</p>
<p>protect those values, um, I think reason is the better tool, but it&rsquo;s not that I</p>
<p>would want to dispense with any part of empathy either.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of dangers to go on there, but briefly to mention, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>recently talked about, uh, effective altruism on your podcast.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned some interesting statement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to horribly misquote you, but that you&rsquo;d rather live in a world, like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense, but you&rsquo;d rather live in a world where you care</p>
<p>about maybe your daughter and son, more than a hundred people that live across</p>
<p>the world, something like this, where the calculus is not always perfect, but</p>
<p>somehow it makes sense to live in a world where it&rsquo;s irrational in this way, and</p>
<p>yet empathetic in the way you&rsquo;ve been discussing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the right answer is there, or even whether there is one right</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>There could be multiple peaks on this part of the moral landscape, but so the</p>
<p>opposition is between an ethic that&rsquo;s articulated by someone like the Dalai</p>
<p>Lama, right, or really any exponent of, of, um, you know, classic Buddhism would</p>
<p>say that sort of the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect to</p>
<p>friends and strangers, right?</p>
<p>So that you would, the, you know, the, the mind of the Buddha would be truly</p>
<p>dispassionate.</p>
<p>You would love and care about all people equally.</p>
<p>Uh, and by that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing, or at least, you</p>
<p>know, failure of, of, to fully actualize compassion in the limit, or, you know,</p>
<p>enlightened wisdom in the limit, um, to care more or even, and much more about</p>
<p>your kids than the kids of other people, or, and to, and to prioritize your, your</p>
<p>energy in that way, right?</p>
<p>So you spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids healthy</p>
<p>and happy, and you&rsquo;ll attend to their minutest concerns, however superficial.</p>
<p>And, and again, there&rsquo;s a genocide raging in Sudan or wherever, and it takes up</p>
<p>less than 1% of your bandwidth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it would be a better world if everyone was running</p>
<p>the Dalai Lama program there.</p>
<p>I think some prioritization of, of one&rsquo;s nearest and dearest, uh, ethically might</p>
<p>be optimal because we will all be doing that and we&rsquo;ll all be doing that in a</p>
<p>circumstance where we have certain norms and, and laws and, and other structures</p>
<p>that force us to be dispassionate where that matters, right?</p>
<p>So like when I go to, when my daughter gets sick and I have to take her to, to</p>
<p>a hospital, you know, I really want her to get attention, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m worried about her more than I&rsquo;m worried about everyone else in the lobby.</p>
<p>But the truth is I actually don&rsquo;t want a totally corrupt hospital.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a hospital that treats my daughter better than anyone else in the</p>
<p>lobby because she&rsquo;s my daughter and I&rsquo;ve, you know, bribed the guy at the door or</p>
<p>whatever, you know, or the guy&rsquo;s a fan of my podcast or whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want starkly corrupt, unfair situations.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re, when you sort of get pressed down the hierarchy of Maslow&rsquo;s</p>
<p>needs, you know, individually and, and, and societally, a bunch of the, a bunch</p>
<p>of those variables change and they change for the worse, understandably.</p>
<p>But yeah, when things are, when everyone&rsquo;s corrupt and it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in a, in</p>
<p>a state of, of, uh, collective emergency, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a lifeboat problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re scrambling to get into the lifeboat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then, then fairness and norms and, and, um, the, you know, the, uh, the other</p>
<p>vestiges of civilization begin to get stripped off.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t reason from those emergencies to normal life.</p>
<p>I mean, in normal life, we want justice.</p>
<p>We want fairness.</p>
<p>We want, we&rsquo;re all better off for it.</p>
<p>Even when the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know, the people</p>
<p>who are friends, the people who are family, people we, we, we have good reason to care</p>
<p>about, we still by default want a system that protects the interests of strangers</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>And we know that generally speaking, and just in game theoretic terms, we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>going to tend to be better off in a fair system than a corrupt one.</p>
<p>One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data.</p>
<p>Just a good story will get us to not think clearly.</p>
<p>But what about empathy in the context of just discussing ideas with other people?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a large number of people like in this country, you know,</p>
<p>red and blue, half the population believes certain things on immigration or on the</p>
<p>response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue.</p>
<p>Even if, if the election was fairly executed, having an empathy for their world</p>
<p>view, trying to understand where they&rsquo;re coming from, not just in the explicit</p>
<p>statement of their idea, but the entirety of like the roots from which their idea</p>
<p>stems, that kind of empathy while you&rsquo;re discussing ideas, what is, in your pursuit</p>
<p>of truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other</p>
<p>people versus raw mathematical reason.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important, but I just, it only takes you so far, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t get you to truth, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, the truth is not a, it&rsquo;s not decided by, you know, democratic</p>
<p>principles and, um, certain people believe things for understandable reasons, but</p>
<p>those reasons are nonetheless bad reasons, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t scale, they don&rsquo;t generalize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not reasons anyone should adopt for themselves or, or respect, you know,</p>
<p>epistemologically and yet their, their circumstance is understandable and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you can care about, right?</p>
<p>And so, yeah, like, I mean, just take, I think there&rsquo;s many examples of this.</p>
<p>You might be thinking of, but I mean, one, one that comes to mind is I&rsquo;ve been super</p>
<p>critical of Trump, obviously.</p>
<p>And, um, I&rsquo;ve been super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not</p>
<p>criticizing him when he really made it, you know, patently obvious who he was, you</p>
<p>know, if, if there had been any doubt initially, there was no doubt when we have</p>
<p>a sitting president who&rsquo;s not, uh, not, um, agreeing to a peaceful transfer of</p>
<p>power, right?</p>
<p>So, um, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m critical of all of that.</p>
<p>And yet the fact that many millions of Americans didn&rsquo;t see what was wrong with</p>
<p>Trump or bought into the, um, didn&rsquo;t see through his con, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they bought into the idea that he was a brilliant businessman who could,</p>
<p>might just be able to change things because he&rsquo;s so unconventional.</p>
<p>And so, you know, his heart is in the right place.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s really a man of the people, even though he&rsquo;s a, you know, gold-plated</p>
<p>everything in his life.</p>
<p>Um, they bought the myth somehow, uh, of, you know, largely because they had seen him</p>
<p>on television for almost a decade and a half, uh, pretending to be this genius</p>
<p>businessman who could get things done.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s understandable to me that many very frustrated people who have not had</p>
<p>their hopes and dreams actualized, uh, who have been the victims of globalism and,</p>
<p>and, um, many other, you know, current trends, uh, it&rsquo;s understandable that they</p>
<p>would be confused and, and, and not see the liability of electing a grossly</p>
<p>incompetent, morbidly narcissistic person into the, into the presidency.</p>
<p>Um, so I don&rsquo;t, so which is to say that I don&rsquo;t blame, there are many, many millions</p>
<p>of people who I don&rsquo;t necessarily blame for the Trump phenomenon, but I can</p>
<p>nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon as, as indicative of, you know, very bad, uh,</p>
<p>state of affairs in our society, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s two levels to it.</p>
<p>I mean, one is, I think you have to call a spade a spade when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about how things actually work and what things are, are likely to happen or not.</p>
<p>But then you can recognize that people are, have very different life experiences.</p>
<p>And, and yeah, I mean, I think empathy and, you know, probably the better word</p>
<p>for what I would hope to embody there is compassion, right?</p>
<p>Like really, you know, to really wish people well, you know, and to really wish,</p>
<p>you know, strangers well, effortlessly wish them well, I mean, to realize</p>
<p>there is no opposition between in the, at bottom, there&rsquo;s no real opposition</p>
<p>between selfishness and selflessness because why is selfishness really takes</p>
<p>into account other people&rsquo;s happiness?</p>
<p>I mean, you, you know, which do you, do you want to live in a society where you</p>
<p>have everything, but most other people have nothing, uh, or do you want to live</p>
<p>in a society where you&rsquo;re surrounded by happy, creative, self-actualized people</p>
<p>who are having their hopes and dreams realized?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious that the second society is much better, however much</p>
<p>you can guard your good luck.</p>
<p>But what about having empathy for certain principles that people believe, for</p>
<p>example, the, the pushback, the other perspective on this, because you said</p>
<p>bought the myth of Trump as the great businessman, there could be a lot of</p>
<p>people that are supporters of Trump who could say that Sam Harris bought the</p>
<p>myth that we have this government of the people by the people that actually</p>
<p>represents the people as opposed to a bunch of elites who are running a giant</p>
<p>bureaucracy that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves and they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>not representing the people.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s this chaos agent Trump who speaks off the top of his head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s flawed in all this number of ways.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s actually creating the kind of chaos that&rsquo;s going to shake up this</p>
<p>bureaucracy, shake up the elites that are so uncomfortable because they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>the world to know about the game that got running on everybody else.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the kind of perspective that they would take and say, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these flaws that Trump has, but this is necessary.</p>
<p>I agree with the first part of it.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t bought the myth that it&rsquo;s a, you know, a truly representative</p>
<p>democracy in the way that we would, you might idealize.</p>
<p>And, you know, on some level, I mean, this is a different conversation, but on some</p>
<p>level, I&rsquo;m not even sure how much I think it should be right.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not sure we want in the end, everyone&rsquo;s opinion given equal weight</p>
<p>about, you know, just what we should do about anything.</p>
<p>And I include myself in that.</p>
<p>I mean, there are many topics around which I don&rsquo;t deserve to have a strong</p>
<p>opinion because I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, right.</p>
<p>Or what I would be talking about if I had a strong opinion.</p>
<p>So, um, and I think we&rsquo;ll probably get to that, to some of those topics because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve declined to have certain conversations on my podcast just because I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the wrong person to have that conversation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s, um, and I think it&rsquo;s important to see those bright lines in, in</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s life and in, in the moment politically, uh, and ethically.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, I think, um, so leave aside the, the, the viability of democracy.</p>
<p>Uh, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m under no illusions that all of our institutions are, you know, worth</p>
<p>preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment this great orange wrecking</p>
<p>ball came swinging through our lives.</p>
<p>But I just, it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is grossly incompetent</p>
<p>and, um, worse than incompetent, um, genuinely malevolent in his selfishness.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think, and this is something we know based on literally decades</p>
<p>of him being in the public eye.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not as, he&rsquo;s not a public servant in any normal sense of that term.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t possibly give an honest or sane answer to the question, the</p>
<p>question you asked me about empathy and reason and, and like, how should</p>
<p>we, you know, what should guide us?</p>
<p>Um, I genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and,</p>
<p>and psychological tools.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this, this is, I can feel compassion for him as a human being, because I</p>
<p>think having those things is incredibly important and genuinely loving other</p>
<p>people is incredibly important.</p>
<p>And, and knowing what all it&rsquo;s about is, is, is that&rsquo;s really the good stuff in</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>And I, I, um, I think he&rsquo;s missing a lot of that, but I think we, we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to promote people to, to the highest positions of power in our society who are</p>
<p>far outliers in, in pathological terms.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We want them to be far outliers in, in, if, if in the best case in wisdom and</p>
<p>compassion and some of the things you&rsquo;ve, some of the topics you&rsquo;ve brought up.</p>
<p>I mean, we want someone to be deeply informed.</p>
<p>We want someone to be, um, uh, unusually curious, unusually alert to how they may</p>
<p>be wrong or getting things wrong consequentially.</p>
<p>Um, he&rsquo;s none of those things.</p>
<p>And if, in so far as we&rsquo;re going to get normal mediocrities in that role, which</p>
<p>I think, you know, is often the best we could expect, let&rsquo;s get normal mediocrities</p>
<p>in that role.</p>
<p>Not, uh, you know, once in a generation, uh, narcissists and, um, uh, frauds.</p>
<p>I mean, it is like the, I mean, just take honesty as a single variable, right?</p>
<p>I think you want, yes, it&rsquo;s possible that, uh, most politicians lie at</p>
<p>least some of the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Um, I think people should be gen, you know, generally honest, um, even to a fault.</p>
<p>Um, yes, there are certain circumstances where lying, I think is necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of on a continuum of self-defense and violence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re going to, you know, if the Nazis come to your door and ask you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got Anne Frank in the attic, I think it&rsquo;s okay to lie to them.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, you know, Trump, there&rsquo;s, I, arguably there&rsquo;s never been a person</p>
<p>that anyone could name in human history who&rsquo;s lied with that kind of velocity.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it was, he was just a blizzard of lies, great and small, you</p>
<p>know, to, to pointless and, and to, and effective, but it&rsquo;s just, it, it says</p>
<p>something, uh, fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character</p>
<p>got promoted and so, uh, yes, I have compassion and concern for, for half of</p>
<p>the society who didn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to sound elitist and, and, uh, and smug or something to, for</p>
<p>anyone who&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s on that side listening to me, but, um, it&rsquo;s genuine.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m, I understand that like, like I barely have the, I&rsquo;m like one of the</p>
<p>luckiest people in the world and I barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to</p>
<p>half the things I should pay attention to in order to have an opinion about half</p>
<p>of the things we&rsquo;re going to talk about.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So how much less bandwidth is somebody who&rsquo;s working two jobs or, you know, a</p>
<p>single mom who&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s, you know, raising, you know, multiple kids, you know,</p>
<p>even a single kid, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s unimaginable to me that people have the,</p>
<p>the bandwidth to, to really track this stuff.</p>
<p>And so then they jump on social media and they, they see, they get inundated by</p>
<p>misinformation and they see what their favorite influencer just said.</p>
<p>Um, and now they&rsquo;re worried about vaccines and they&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re living in an environment where our, our, the information</p>
<p>space has become so corrupted.</p>
<p>Uh, and we&rsquo;ve built machines to, to further corrupt it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a business model for the internet that it further corrupts it.</p>
<p>Uh, so it&rsquo;s, it is just, um, it&rsquo;s chaos in informational terms.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t fault people for being confused and impatient and, uh, at the,</p>
<p>at their wits end and, um, yes, Trump was a, an enormous fuck you to the</p>
<p>establishment and, and that&rsquo;s, that was understandable for many reasons.</p>
<p>To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris is somebody I&rsquo;ve looked up to for a long</p>
<p>time as a beacon of voice of reason.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this meme on the internet, and I would love you to steel man the</p>
<p>case for it and against that Trump broke Sam Harris&rsquo;s brain, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something is disproportionately to the actual impact that Trump had on our</p>
<p>society, he had, um, an impact on the, on the ability of balanced, calm, rational</p>
<p>minds to see the world clearly, to think clearly you being one of the beacons of</p>
<p>that, is there, is there a degree to which he broke your brain, uh, otherwise</p>
<p>known as Trump derangement syndrome, medical, medical condition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Trump derangement syndrome is a, is a very clever meme</p>
<p>because it, it just, uh, throws the, you know, the, the problem back on the</p>
<p>person who&rsquo;s criticizing Trump.</p>
<p>In truth, the true Trump derangement syndrome was not to have seen how</p>
<p>dangerous and divisive it would be to promote someone like Trump to that</p>
<p>position of power and to not, and in the, in the final moment, not to see how, uh,</p>
<p>untenable it was to still support someone who, uh, you know, a sitting</p>
<p>president who was not committing to a peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>I mean, that was, if, if, if that wasn&rsquo;t a bright line for you, you have been</p>
<p>deranged by something, uh, because that was, you know, the, that was one minute</p>
<p>to midnight for our democracy as far as I I&rsquo;m concerned, and I think it really</p>
<p>was, but for the, the integrity of, uh, a few people that we didn&rsquo;t suffer some</p>
<p>real constitutional crisis and real emergency, you know, after January 6th.</p>
<p>I mean, if, if Mike Pence had caved in and decided to not certify the election,</p>
<p>right, uh, if it literally, you can count on two hands, a number of people who held</p>
<p>things together at that moment.</p>
<p>And so it was, so it wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying on Trump&rsquo;s part that we, we, um,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t succumb to some real, truly uncharted, uh, uh, catastrophe with our</p>
<p>democracy.</p>
<p>So the fact that that didn&rsquo;t happen is not a sign that those of us who were</p>
<p>worried that it was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you know, you almost got run over by a car, but you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you&rsquo;re the fact that you&rsquo;re adrenalized and you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>you know, but boy, that was dangerous.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t, you know, you know, wander in the middle of the street, uh,</p>
<p>with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>Um, you weren&rsquo;t wrong to feel that you really had a problem, right?</p>
<p>Um, and came very close to something truly, uh, terrible.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s where we were.</p>
<p>And I think we shouldn&rsquo;t do that again.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the fact that he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s still, he&rsquo;s coming back around as</p>
<p>potentially a viable candidate.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not spending much time thinking about it, frankly, because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m waiting for the moment where it re it requires some thought.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, it, it did, it took up, uh, I don&rsquo;t know how many podcasts I</p>
<p>devoted to the topic.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t that many in the end, you know, against</p>
<p>the, the number of podcasts I, I devoted to other topics, but there are people</p>
<p>who look at Trump and just find him funny, entertaining, not especially</p>
<p>threatening, it&rsquo;s like not a, you know, just, it&rsquo;s just good fun to see somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like, who&rsquo;s just not taking anything seriously and it&rsquo;s just, just</p>
<p>putting a, you know, a stick in the wheel of, of business as usual again</p>
<p>and again and again and again.</p>
<p>Um, and they don&rsquo;t really see anything much at stake, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if we don&rsquo;t support NATO.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter if he says he trusts Putin more than</p>
<p>our intelligence services.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, none of this is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s on the one hand saying</p>
<p>that he loves, uh, the leader of North Korea and on the other threatening,</p>
<p>it threatens to, to, you know, bomb them back to the stone age right on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, it all can be taken in the spirit of kind of reality television.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is just, this is the part of the movie that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just fun to watch, right?</p>
<p>And I understand that I can even inhabit that space for a few minutes at a time,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a deeper concern that we&rsquo;re in the process of entertaining ourselves</p>
<p>to death, right?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re just not taking things seriously.</p>
<p>And this is, it&rsquo;s a problem I&rsquo;ve had with several other people we might name</p>
<p>who just, who just appear to me to be goofing around at scale and they</p>
<p>lack a kind of moral seriousness.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re touching big problems where lives hang in the</p>
<p>balance, but they&rsquo;re just fucking around.</p>
<p>And I think there are really important problems that we have to</p>
<p>get our head straight around.</p>
<p>And we need, you know, it&rsquo;s not to say that, that institutions don&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>corrupt, I think they do.</p>
<p>And I think, and I&rsquo;m quite worried that, you know, both about the loss of trust</p>
<p>in our institutions and the fact that trust has eroded for good reason, right?</p>
<p>That they have become less trustworthy.</p>
<p>I think, you know, they&rsquo;ve become infected by, you know, political</p>
<p>ideologies that are not truth tracking.</p>
<p>I mean, I worry about all of that.</p>
<p>But I just think the, we need institutions, we need to rebuild them.</p>
<p>We need, we need experts who are real experts.</p>
<p>We need to value expertise over, you know, amateurish speculation and</p>
<p>conspiracy thinking and just, you know, and bullshit.</p>
<p>What kind of amateur speculation we&rsquo;re doing on this very podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually alert to the moments where I&rsquo;m just guessing or where I actually</p>
<p>feel like I&rsquo;m talking from within my wheelhouse and I try to telegraph</p>
<p>that a fair amount with people.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, I mean, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, you, you can invite someone onto your podcast who&rsquo;s an expert about</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re, you, you&rsquo;re not an expert about, and then you, you in the</p>
<p>process of getting more informed yourself, your, your audience is getting more</p>
<p>informed, so you&rsquo;re asking smart questions and you might be pushing back at the</p>
<p>margins, but you know that when push comes to shove on that topic, you really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a basis to have a strong opinion.</p>
<p>And if you were going to form a, a, a strong opinion that was this counter to</p>
<p>the expert you have in front of you, it&rsquo;s going to be by deference to some other</p>
<p>expert who you&rsquo;ve brought in or who you&rsquo;ve heard about or whose work you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve read or whatever.</p>
<p>But there, there&rsquo;s a paradox to how we value authority in science that most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I think we should at some point unravel that because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the basis</p>
<p>for a lot of public confusion.</p>
<p>And, and frankly, it&rsquo;s the basis for a lot of, you know, criticism I&rsquo;ve received on</p>
<p>these topics where it&rsquo;s, you know, people think that I&rsquo;m a, you know, I, I&rsquo;m against</p>
<p>free speech or I&rsquo;m an establishment shill, or it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, I just think I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>credentialist.</p>
<p>I just think people with PhDs from Ivy league universities should run everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true, but there&rsquo;s a ton of, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot to cut through to get</p>
<p>to daylight there because people are very confused about how we value authority in</p>
<p>the service of rationality generally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about it, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just interesting.</p>
<p>The intensity of feeling you have, you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve had this famous phrase about Hunter</p>
<p>Biden and children in the basement.</p>
<p>Can you just revisit this case?</p>
<p>So let me, let me give another perspective on the situation of January 6th and Trump</p>
<p>in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that January 6th and things of that nature revealed that our democracy</p>
<p>is actually pretty fragile and that Trump is not a malevolent and ultra-competent</p>
<p>malevolent figure, but it&rsquo;s simply a jokester.</p>
<p>And he just, by creating the chaos revealed that it&rsquo;s all pretty fragile.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a student of history and there&rsquo;s a lot of people like Vladimir</p>
<p>Lenin, Hitler, who are exceptionally competent at controlling power, at being</p>
<p>executives and taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the</p>
<p>figures involved and certainly not tweeting, but working in the shadows behind the</p>
<p>scenes to gain power.</p>
<p>And they did so extremely competently.</p>
<p>And that is how they were able to gain power.</p>
<p>The pushback with Trump, he was doing none of that.</p>
<p>He was creating what he&rsquo;s very good at, creating drama, sometimes for humor&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>sometimes for drama&rsquo;s sake, and simply revealed that our democracy is fragile.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s not this once in a generation, horrible figure.</p>
<p>Once in a generation narcissist.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a truly scary, sinister, Putin-like or Hitler, much less</p>
<p>Hitler-like figure, not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s not ideological.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care about anything beyond himself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, no, no, he&rsquo;s much less scary than any really scary totalitarian, right?</p>
<p>I mean, and he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more brave in your world than 1984?</p>
<p>This is what, you know, Eric Weinstein never stops badgering me about, but, you</p>
<p>know, he&rsquo;s still wrong, Eric.</p>
<p>You know, I can, you know, my analogy for Trump was that he&rsquo;s an evil Chauncey</p>
<p>Gardner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember the book or the film being there with Peter Sellers.</p>
<p>But, you know, Peter Sellers is this gardener who really doesn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>But he gets recognized as this wise man and gets promoted to immense power in</p>
<p>Washington because he&rsquo;s speaking in these kind of, in a semblance of wisdom.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got these very simple aphorisms or what seem to be aphorisms.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just talking, all he cares about is gardening.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just talking about his garden all the time.</p>
<p>But, you know, he&rsquo;ll say something, but yeah, you know, in the spring, you know,</p>
<p>the new shoots will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius, you know,</p>
<p>insight politically.</p>
<p>And so he gets promoted.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the joke of the film.</p>
<p>For me, Trump has always been someone like an evil Chauncey Gardner.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not to say he&rsquo;s totally, yes, he has a certain kind of</p>
<p>genius.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a genius for getting the eye of the media always coming back to him.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s only, it&rsquo;s a kind of, it&rsquo;s a kind of, you know, self-promotion that</p>
<p>only works if you actually are truly shameless and don&rsquo;t care about having a</p>
<p>reputation for anything that, that, that I, or you would want to have a reputation</p>
<p>for, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s pure, the pure pornography of attention, right?</p>
<p>He just, and he just wants more of it.</p>
<p>Um, I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a</p>
<p>country that at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many</p>
<p>ways, we have a country that didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>Bringing someone who&rsquo;s, who obviously doesn&rsquo;t know what he should know to be</p>
<p>president and who&rsquo;s obviously not a good person, right?</p>
<p>Obviously doesn&rsquo;t care about people, can&rsquo;t even pretend to care about people</p>
<p>really, right?</p>
<p>In a credible way.</p>
<p>Um, and so, I mean, this, if there&rsquo;s a silver lining to this, it, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s along</p>
<p>the lines you just sketched.</p>
<p>It shows us how vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, like, uh, I, I think we are, um, we really dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could have exploited our</p>
<p>system in a way that Trump didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I, and that&rsquo;s, um, yeah.</p>
<p>So if, if we plug those holes eventually, um, that would be a good thing and he</p>
<p>would have done a good thing for our society.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things we realized, and I think nobody knew, I mean, I</p>
<p>certainly didn&rsquo;t know it and I didn&rsquo;t hear anyone talk about it, is how much</p>
<p>our system relies on norms rather than laws.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Civility almost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s quite possible that he never did anything illegal, you</p>
<p>know, truly, truly illegal.</p>
<p>I mean, I think he probably did a few illegal things, but like illegal such</p>
<p>that he really should be thrown in jail for it, you know?</p>
<p>Um, at least that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>So all of the chaos, all of the, you know, all of the diminishment of our</p>
<p>stature in the world, all of the, just the, the opportunity costs of spending</p>
<p>years focused on nonsense, um, all of that was just norm violations.</p>
<p>All of that was just, that was just all a matter of not saying the thing you</p>
<p>should say, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re insignificant, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not illegal for a sitting president to say, no, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll wait and see whether I win.</p>
<p>If I win, it, it, it, it, it was, the election was, was, was valid.</p>
<p>If I lose, it was fraudulent, right?</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we</p>
<p>know what the limits are, and now we start to think that and have these kinds of</p>
<p>discussions.</p>
<p>But that, that wasn&rsquo;t a humorous perturbation because he did everything he</p>
<p>could, granted he wasn&rsquo;t very competent, but he did everything he could to try to</p>
<p>steal the election.</p>
<p>I mean, the irony is he claimed to have an election stolen from him all the while</p>
<p>doing everything he could to steal it, declaring it fraudulent in advance,</p>
<p>trying to get the votes to, to, to not be counted as the evening wore on, knowing</p>
<p>that they were going to be disproportionately Democrat, Democrat votes,</p>
<p>um, because of the, you know, because of the position he took on mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>I mean, all of it was fairly calculated.</p>
<p>Um, the whole circus of, of, of, you know, the clown car that crashed into, you</p>
<p>know, four seasons landscaping, right.</p>
<p>And, and you got Rudy Giuliani with his hair dye and you got Sidney Powell and</p>
<p>all the, all these grossly incompetent people lying as freely as they could</p>
<p>breathe about election fraud, right.</p>
<p>And all of these things are getting thrown out by, you know, Republican,</p>
<p>largely Republican election officials and Republican judges.</p>
<p>Um, it wasn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maintain his power in this country.</p>
<p>He really tried to steal the presidency.</p>
<p>He just was not competent and the people around him weren&rsquo;t competent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worth not letting that happen again.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t competent.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t do everything he could.</p>
<p>Well, no, he did everything he could.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do everything that could have been done by someone more competent.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the, the tools you have as a president, you could do a lot of things.</p>
<p>You can declare emergencies, especially during COVID, you could</p>
<p>postpone the election, you can create military conflict that, you know, any</p>
<p>kind of reason to postpone the election.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>Well, he, he tried to do things and he would have to have done those</p>
<p>things through other people.</p>
<p>And there are people who refuse to do those things.</p>
<p>There are people who said they would quit.</p>
<p>They would, they would quit publicly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, you start, again, there are multiple books written</p>
<p>about the last hours of, of this presidency.</p>
<p>And the details are shocking in what he tried to do and try to get others to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s awful, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just awful that we were that close to something, to, to a</p>
<p>true unraveling of our political process.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the only time in our lifetime that anything like this has happened.</p>
<p>And, um, it&rsquo;s deeply embarrassing, right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re at, you know, on the world stage, it&rsquo;s just like, we, we looked like a</p>
<p>banana republic there for a while.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re the lone superpower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so we shouldn&rsquo;t, like, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no, the, I, the people who</p>
<p>thought, well, we just need to shake things up and this is a great, great way</p>
<p>to shake things up and having people, you know, storm our Capitol and smear shit</p>
<p>on the walls, that&rsquo;s just more shaking things up, right?</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s all just for the lulz.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s a nihilism and cynicism to all of that, which again, in certain</p>
<p>people, it&rsquo;s understandable, you know, frankly, it&rsquo;s not understandable if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a billion dollars and you&rsquo;re, you, you know, have a compound in</p>
<p>Menlo Park or wherever it&rsquo;s like, there are people who are cheerleading this</p>
<p>stuff who shouldn&rsquo;t be cheerleading this stuff and who know that they can get on</p>
<p>their Gulf stream and fly to their compound in New Zealand if everything</p>
<p>goes to shit, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a cynicism to all of that, that I think we should be deeply critical of.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to understand is not, and analyze, is not the behavior of this</p>
<p>particular human being, but the effect it had in part on the division between</p>
<p>people, as to me, the degree, the meme of Sam Harris&rsquo;s brain being broken by</p>
<p>Trump represents, you&rsquo;re like the person I would look to, to bridge the division.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there is something profitably to be said to someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly captivated by the, the, the personality cult of Trumpism, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s nothing that I&rsquo;m going to say to, there&rsquo;s no conversation I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to have with Candace Owens, say, about Trump that&rsquo;s going to converge</p>
<p>on something reasonable, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I&rsquo;ve tried, I haven&rsquo;t tried with Candace, but I&rsquo;ve tried with, you</p>
<p>know, many people who are in that particular orbit.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve had conversations with people who won&rsquo;t admit that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything wrong with Trump, anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to push for the empathy versus reason, because when you operate</p>
<p>in the space of reason, yes, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of power in you showing,</p>
<p>in you, Sam Harris, showing that you&rsquo;re willing to see the good qualities of</p>
<p>Trump, publicly showing that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way to win over Candace Owens.</p>
<p>But he has so few of them.</p>
<p>He has fewer good qualities than any, virtually anyone I can name, right?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>He, I&rsquo;ll grant you that he&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a, he&rsquo;s a good entertainer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s others look at just policies and actual impacts he had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve admitted that.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So like, so I&rsquo;ve admitted that many of his policies I agree with.</p>
<p>Many, many of his policies.</p>
<p>So probably more often than not, I mean, at least on balance, I agreed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I agreed with his policy that, you know, we should take China</p>
<p>seriously as an adversary, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, and I think, I mean, again, you have to, there&rsquo;s a lot of fine print</p>
<p>to a lot of this, because the way he talks about these things and many of his</p>
<p>motives that are obvious are things that I don&rsquo;t support, but I mean, take</p>
<p>immigration, I think there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s obvious that we should have control of our</p>
<p>borders, right?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t see the argument for not having control of our borders.</p>
<p>We should let in who we want to let in and we should keep out who we want to keep</p>
<p>out and we should have a sane immigration policy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t necessarily think it was a priority to build the wall, but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t, I never criticized the impulse to build the wall because if, you know, tens</p>
<p>of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are coming across that border and</p>
<p>we are not in a position to know who&rsquo;s coming, that seems untenable to me.</p>
<p>So, and I can recognize that many people in our society are on balance, the victims</p>
<p>of immigration, and there is, in many cases, a zero sum contest between the</p>
<p>interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants, right?</p>
<p>So I think we should have a, we should have control of our borders.</p>
<p>We should have a sane and compassionate immigration policy.</p>
<p>We should have, we should let in refugees, right?</p>
<p>So I did, you know, Trump on refugees was terrible.</p>
<p>But no, like I would say 80% of the policy concerns people celebrated in him are</p>
<p>concerns that I either share entirely or certainly sympathize with, right?</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is, well, the issue is largely what you said it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much the person, it&rsquo;s the effect on everything he touches, right?</p>
<p>He just, he has this, this superpower of deranging and destabilizing almost</p>
<p>everything he touches and sullying and compromising the integrity of almost</p>
<p>anyone who comes into his orbit.</p>
<p>I mean, so you looked at these people who served as chief of staff or, you know, in</p>
<p>various cabinet positions, people who had real reputations, you know, for, for</p>
<p>probity and, and level-headedness, you know, whether you share their politics or</p>
<p>not, I mean, these were real people.</p>
<p>These were not, you know, some of them were goofballs, but, you know, many</p>
<p>people who, who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by</p>
<p>him when they finally parted company with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just people bent over backwards to accommodate his norm</p>
<p>violations and it, it was, it was bad for them and it was bad for our, our, our</p>
<p>system and, but that, but none of that discounts the fact that we have a system</p>
<p>that really needs proper house cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests, and I&rsquo;m not a fan</p>
<p>of the concept of, of the deep state, but cause it, you know, it&rsquo;s been so</p>
<p>propagandized, but yes, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s something like that, you know, that is</p>
<p>not flexible enough to re to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of rethinking of government and of institutions in general</p>
<p>that I think we should do, but we need smart, well-informed, well-intentioned</p>
<p>people to do that job, and the well-intentioned part is, is hugely</p>
<p>important, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, just give me someone who is not the most selfish person anyone has</p>
<p>ever heard about in their lifetime, right?</p>
<p>And what we got with Trump was the, like the, literally the one most selfish</p>
<p>person I think anyone could name.</p>
<p>I mean, and you, and again, you, there&rsquo;s so much known about this man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It was like, it predates his presidency.</p>
<p>We knew this guy 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and this, and this is what, to come back to the, those inflammatory</p>
<p>comments about Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop.</p>
<p>The reason why I can say with confidence that I don&rsquo;t care what was on his, his</p>
<p>laptop is that there is, and, and that includes any evidence of corruption</p>
<p>on the, on the part of his father, right?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s been precious little of that that&rsquo;s actually emerged.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, there is no, as far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s not a big story</p>
<p>associated with that laptop as much as people bang on about a few emails.</p>
<p>But even if there were just obvious corruption, right?</p>
<p>Like Joe Biden was at this meeting and he took, you know, this amount of money</p>
<p>from this shady guy, uh, for bad reasons, right?</p>
<p>Given how visible the lives of these two men have been, right?</p>
<p>I mean, given how much we know about Joe Biden and how much we know about Donald</p>
<p>Trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as I&rsquo;ve been alive,</p>
<p>both of them, the, the, the, the scale of corruption can&rsquo;t possibly balance</p>
<p>out between the two of them, right?</p>
<p>We, I, if, if you show me that Joe Biden has this secret life where he&rsquo;s driving</p>
<p>a Bugatti and he&rsquo;s living like Andrew Tate, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s doing, he&rsquo;s doing all these things I didn&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to start getting a sense that, all right, maybe this guy</p>
<p>is way more corrupt than I realized.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some deal in Ukraine or with China that is just like,</p>
<p>this guy is not who he seems.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the public servant he&rsquo;s been pretending to be.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the take for decades and decades.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s as dirty as can be.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s all mobbed up and it&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>Um, and he can&rsquo;t be trusted, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>If you show me that his life is not at all what it seems, but on the assumption</p>
<p>that I, having looked at this guy for literally decades, right.</p>
<p>And ha and knowing that every journalist has looked at him for decades, just</p>
<p>how many affairs is he having?</p>
<p>Just how much, you know, uh, how many drugs is he doing?</p>
<p>How many houses does he have where, you know, what, what, what is, what are</p>
<p>the obvious conflicts of interest?</p>
<p>You know, you hold that against what we know about Trump, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, the litany of indiscretions you can put on Trump&rsquo;s side that, that</p>
<p>testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that he has no ethical</p>
<p>compass, there&rsquo;s simply no comparison, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s on the laptop when now, if you tell me</p>
<p>Trump is no longer running for president in 2024, and we can put Trumpism behind</p>
<p>us, and now you&rsquo;re saying, listen, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff on that laptop</p>
<p>that makes Joe Biden look like a total asshole.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all ears, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it was a forced in 2020.</p>
<p>It was a forced choice between a sitting president who wouldn&rsquo;t commit to a</p>
<p>peaceful transfer of power and a guy who was obviously too old to be president,</p>
<p>who has a crack addicted son who, who, you know, who lost his laptop.</p>
<p>And I just knew that I was going to take Biden in spite of whatever litany of</p>
<p>horrors was going to come tumbling out of that laptop.</p>
<p>And that might involve sort of, so the actual quote is, Hunter Biden literally</p>
<p>could have had the corpses of children in the basement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark humor to it, right?</p>
<p>Which is, I think you speak to, I would not have cared.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s Hunter Biden, it&rsquo;s not Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Whatever the scope of Joe Biden&rsquo;s corruption is, it is infinitesimally</p>
<p>compared to the corruption we know Trump was involved in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a firefly to the sun is what you&rsquo;re speaking to.</p>
<p>But let me make the case that you&rsquo;re really focused on the surface stuff that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to have corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned,</p>
<p>which is civility.</p>
<p>You can spend hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions towards the war in</p>
<p>the Middle East, for example, something that you&rsquo;ve changed your mind on in</p>
<p>terms of the negative impact it has on the world.</p>
<p>And that, you know, the military industrial complex, everybody&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>nice, everybody&rsquo;s very civil, just very upfront.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re spending the money.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes somehow disappears in different places, but that&rsquo;s the way,</p>
<p>you know, war is complicated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, everyone is very polite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Coke and strippers or whatever is on the laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice and polite.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilians die of hate.</p>
<p>And just an incredible amount of hate is created because people lose their family</p>
<p>members, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no strippers and Coke on a laptop.</p>
<p>So, yeah, but it&rsquo;s not just superficial.</p>
<p>It is when you, when someone only wants wealth and power and fame and that is</p>
<p>their, their, their objective function, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like a, like a robot that is calibrated just to those variables.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t care about the risks we run on any other front.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care about environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear</p>
<p>proliferation risk, none of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They just, they&rsquo;re just tracking fame and money and, and whatever can, can</p>
<p>personally redound to their self-interest along those lines.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not informed about the other risks we&rsquo;re running, really.</p>
<p>I mean, in Trump, you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals,</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t we use our nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we have more of them?</p>
<p>Why do I have fewer nuclear weapons than JFK?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As though that were a sign of, of, of anything other than progress.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this is the guy who&rsquo;s got the, the button, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s got, somebody&rsquo;s following him around with a bag waiting</p>
<p>to take his order to, to launch.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That is a, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a risk we should never run.</p>
<p>One thing Trump has going for him, I think, is that he&rsquo;s, he doesn&rsquo;t drink or do drugs.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s, you know, people allege that he does speed, but, you</p>
<p>know, let&rsquo;s take him at his word.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s not deranging himself with, with pharmaceuticals at least.</p>
<p>But apart from Diet Coke, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, just for the record, let me push back on that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Diet Coke.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been consuming a very large amount.</p>
<p>I occasionally have some myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no medical, there&rsquo;s no scientific evidence that I observed the negatives of,</p>
<p>you know, all those studies about aspartame and all of that is, I&rsquo;m, no, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I like, I hope, I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I mean, everything you said about the military industrial complex is true.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s been, we&rsquo;ve been worrying about that on both sides</p>
<p>of the aisle for a very long time.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just, you know, that phrase came from, from Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s, uh, I mean, so much of what ails us is a story of bad incentives.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How much more do they corrupt bad people?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, so it&rsquo;s like you want to, at minimum, you want reasonably good people,</p>
<p>at least non-pathological people in us, in the system, trying to navigate</p>
<p>against the grain of bad incentives and better still, all of us can get together</p>
<p>and try to diagnose those incentives and change them, right.</p>
<p>And, and, and we will really succeed when we have a system of incentives where.</p>
<p>The, the good incentives are so strong that even bad people are effortlessly</p>
<p>behaving as though they&rsquo;re good people because they&rsquo;re so successfully</p>
<p>incentivized to behave that way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, so, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost the inversion of our current situation.</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>And you say, I changed my mind about the war.</p>
<p>Uh, I, not quite.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I was never a supporter of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>I was always worried that it was a distraction from the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I was a supporter of the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And I will admit in hindsight, that looks like, uh, you know, at best a highly</p>
<p>ambiguous and painful exercise, you know, more likely a fool&rsquo;s errand, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that, you know, it did not turn out well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I have not done a deep dive on, on all of the failures there.</p>
<p>And maybe all of these failures are failures in principle.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s just, maybe that&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that can be done</p>
<p>well by anybody, whatever our intentions.</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, the, the move to Iraq always seemed questionable to me.</p>
<p>And, um, when we knew the problem, the immediate problem at that moment, you</p>
<p>know, Al Qaeda, uh, uh, was in Afghanistan and, you know, and then bouncing to</p>
<p>Pakistan, um, anyway, you know, so yes, but my, my, my sense of the possibility</p>
<p>of nation building, my sense of, of, um, you know, in so, in so far as the,</p>
<p>the, the neocon, um, spirit of, of, uh, you know, responsibility and idealism</p>
<p>that, you know, America was the kind of nation that should be functioning in</p>
<p>this way as, as the world&rsquo;s cop.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got, we have to get in there and, and untangle some of these knots</p>
<p>by force, um, uh, rather often because, you know, if we don&rsquo;t do it over there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to do it over here kind of thing.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, some of that has definitely changed for me and my thinking.</p>
<p>And there are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t change the culture, um, it&rsquo;s, uh, you&rsquo;re not going to force</p>
<p>a change at gunpoint in the culture.</p>
<p>Or it certainly seems that that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>And it took us, you know, over 20 years to apparently to realize that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things you realize with a war is there&rsquo;s not going to be a</p>
<p>strong signal that things are not working.</p>
<p>If you just keep pouring money into a thing, a military effort.</p>
<p>Well, also there, there are signs of it working too.</p>
<p>You have all the stories of girls now going to school, right?</p>
<p>You know, the girls are getting battery acid thrown in their</p>
<p>faces by religious maniacs.</p>
<p>And then we come in there and we stop that.</p>
<p>And now girls are getting educated and there&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>And our intentions are good there.</p>
<p>And I mean, we&rsquo;re on the right side of history.</p>
<p>Good girls should be going to school.</p>
<p>You know, Malala Yousafzai should have the Nobel prize and she shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>been shot in the face by, by the Taliban.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, we know what the right answers are there.</p>
<p>The question is, what do you do when there are enough in this particular case,</p>
<p>religious maniacs who are willing to die and let their children die in defense of</p>
<p>crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the seventh century.</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s a problem we couldn&rsquo;t solve and we couldn&rsquo;t solve it even though we</p>
<p>spent trillions of dollars to solve it.</p>
<p>This reminded me of, um, the thing that you and, and Jack Dorsey, uh, jokingly</p>
<p>had for a while is the discussion about banning Donald Trump from Twitter.</p>
<p>Um, but does any of it bother you now that Twitter files came out that, I mean,</p>
<p>this has to do with sort of the Hunter laptop, Hunter Biden laptop story.</p>
<p>Does it bother you that there could be a collection of people that make</p>
<p>decisions about who to ban and not, and then that could be susceptible to</p>
<p>bias and to ideological influence?</p>
<p>Well, I think it always will be, or in the absence of perfect AI, it always will be.</p>
<p>And this becomes relevant with AI as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some censorship on AI happening and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting question there as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Twitter is as important as people think it is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, and I, I used to think it was more important when I was on it.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;m off of it, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, uh, I mean, first let me</p>
<p>say, it&rsquo;s just an unambiguously good thing in my experience to</p>
<p>delete your Twitter account, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it is just, even the good parts of Twitter that I miss were</p>
<p>bad in the aggregate, in the degree to which it was fragmenting my attention.</p>
<p>The degree to which my life was getting doled out to me in periods between</p>
<p>those moments where I checked Twitter, right.</p>
<p>And had my attention divert.</p>
<p>And, and I was, you know, I was not a crazy Twitter addict.</p>
<p>I mean, I was, I was probably a pretty normal user.</p>
<p>I mean, I was not someone who was tweeting multiple times</p>
<p>a day or even every day.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I probably, I think I probably averaged something like one tweet a day.</p>
<p>I think I averaged, but in reality it was like, you know, there&rsquo;d be like four tweets</p>
<p>one day and then I wouldn&rsquo;t tweet for the better part of a week.</p>
<p>And, but I was looking a lot because it was my newsfeed.</p>
<p>I was just following, you know, 200 very smart people.</p>
<p>And I would just want her to see what they were paying attention to.</p>
<p>And they would recommend articles and I would read those articles.</p>
<p>And, and then when I would read an article that then I would, that I</p>
<p>would thought I should signal boost.</p>
<p>I would tweet.</p>
<p>And so all of that seemed good.</p>
<p>And like that&rsquo;s all separable from all of the odious bullshit that came back</p>
<p>at me in response to this, largely in response to this Hunter Biden thing.</p>
<p>But even the good stuff has a downside and, and it comes at just this point of</p>
<p>your phone is this perpetual stimulus of which is intrinsically</p>
<p>fragmenting of time and attention.</p>
<p>And now my phone is, is a much less of a presence in my life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t check Slack or check email.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, I, I use it to work, but my sense of just what the</p>
<p>world is and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of where I exist</p>
<p>as a person has changed a lot by deleting my Twitter account.</p>
<p>I mean, I had a, and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s and the, and the things that I think,</p>
<p>I mean, we all know this phenomenon.</p>
<p>I mean, we say of someone that person&rsquo;s too online, right?</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean to be too online?</p>
<p>And where do you draw that, that boundary?</p>
<p>You know, how do you know what constitutes being too online?</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, just be, I think being on, on social</p>
<p>media at all is to be too online.</p>
<p>I mean, given what it does to, given the kinds of information it, it</p>
<p>signal boosts and given the, given the impulse it kindles in each of us to</p>
<p>reach out to our audience in, in specific moments and in specific ways, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there, there are lots of moments now where I have an opinion</p>
<p>about something, but there&rsquo;s nothing for me to do with that opinion, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no Twitter, right?</p>
<p>So like there are lots of things that I would have tweeted in the last</p>
<p>months that are not the kind of thing I&rsquo;m going to do a podcast about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to roll out 10 minutes on that topic on my podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to take the time to really think about it, but had I been on</p>
<p>Twitter, I would have reacted to this thing in the news or this thing</p>
<p>that some, somebody did, right?</p>
<p>What do you do with that thought now?</p>
<p>I just let go of it.</p>
<p>Like chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s usually not that sort of thing, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, but then you look at the kinds of problems people</p>
<p>create for themselves.</p>
<p>You look at the life deranging and reputation destroying</p>
<p>things that people do.</p>
<p>And, and I look at the things that, that have the analogous</p>
<p>things that have happened to me.</p>
<p>I mean, the things that have really bent my life around professionally</p>
<p>over the past decade, so much of it is Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, in my case, almost a hundred percent of it was Twitter.</p>
<p>The controversies I would get into, the things I would think I would have to</p>
<p>respond to in a pod, like I would release a podcast on a certain topic.</p>
<p>I would see some blowback on Twitter.</p>
<p>You know, it would give me the sense that there was some signal</p>
<p>that I really had to respond to.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m off Twitter, I recognize that most of that was just,</p>
<p>it was totally specious, right?</p>
<p>It was, it was not something I had to respond to, but yet I would then do</p>
<p>a cycle of podcasts responding to that thing that like taking my foot out of my</p>
<p>mouth or taking someone else&rsquo;s foot out of my mouth, and it became this, this</p>
<p>self-perpetuating cycle, which, I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, if you&rsquo;re having fun,</p>
<p>great, I mean, if it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s generative of useful information</p>
<p>and, and engagement professionally and, and psychologically, great.</p>
<p>But, and, and there, you know, there was some of that on Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, there were people who I&rsquo;ve connected with because, because I just,</p>
<p>you know, one, one of us DM&rsquo;d the other on Twitter and it was hard to see how</p>
<p>that was going to happen otherwise.</p>
<p>But it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to avoid the drug of that?</p>
<p>So now that you&rsquo;ve achieved the Zen state, is it possible for somebody like</p>
<p>you to use it in a way that doesn&rsquo;t pull you into the whirlpool?</p>
<p>And so anytime there&rsquo;s attacks, you just, I mean, that&rsquo;s how I tried to use it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not the way I wanted to use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way it, it, it promises itself as, as a, I wanted to actually</p>
<p>communicate with people.</p>
<p>I want, I wanted to hear from the person because again, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>being in Afghanistan, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there, there, there are the, the potted cases where it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>good, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in Afghanistan, the girl who&rsquo;s getting an education that is just here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s obviously good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had those moments on Twitter where it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing from a smart person who&rsquo;s detected an error I made in my podcast</p>
<p>or in a book, or they&rsquo;ve just got some great idea about something that I should</p>
<p>spend time on and I would never have heard from this person in any other</p>
<p>format and now I&rsquo;m actually in dialogue with them and it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the promise of it to actually talk to people.</p>
<p>And so I, I kept getting lured back into that.</p>
<p>Um, no, the, the way, the sane or, you know, sanity preserving way of, of using</p>
<p>it is, is just as a marketing channel.</p>
<p>You just put your stuff out there and you don&rsquo;t look at what&rsquo;s coming back at you.</p>
<p>Um, and that&rsquo;s, you know, for, you know, I&rsquo;m on other social media</p>
<p>platforms that I don&rsquo;t even touch.</p>
<p>I mean, my team put, post stuff on Facebook and on Instagram.</p>
<p>I never even see what&rsquo;s on there.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to see something and not let it affect your mind?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>But the question is, and I did that for vast stretches of time, right?</p>
<p>And, but then the, the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback, right?</p>
<p>So like, so why am I, if I know for whatever reason, I&rsquo;m going to see like 99</p>
<p>to one awful feedback, you know, bad faith feedback, malicious feedback.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s probably even bots.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even aware of who&rsquo;s a person, who&rsquo;s a bot, right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just going to stare into this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty.</p>
<p>Um, that is going to, I mean, the, the, the reason why I got off is not because I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t recalibrate and find equanimity again with all the, the, the, the nastiness</p>
<p>that was coming back at me and not that I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it for vast stretches of</p>
<p>time, but I could see that I kept coming back to it, hoping that it would be</p>
<p>something that I could use a real tool for communication.</p>
<p>And I was noticing that it was insidiously changing the way I felt about</p>
<p>people, both people I know and people I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Like people I, you know, mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways</p>
<p>on Twitter, which just seemed insane to me.</p>
<p>Uh, and then I, that became a signal.</p>
<p>I felt like I had to take into account somehow, right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing people at their worst, both friends and strangers.</p>
<p>Um, and I, I felt that it was as much as I could sort of try to recalibrate for it.</p>
<p>I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information because</p>
<p>people are performing, people are faking.</p>
<p>People are not themselves or they&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re seeing people at their worst.</p>
<p>And so I felt like, all right, what&rsquo;s at, what&rsquo;s being advertised to me here on a,</p>
<p>not just a daily basis, I, you know, a hourly basis or, you know, an increment</p>
<p>sometimes of, you know, multiple times an hour, I mean, I probably check Twitter,</p>
<p>you know, at minimum 10 times a day.</p>
<p>And maybe I was checking it a hundred times a day on some days, right.</p>
<p>Where I would, things were really active and I was really engaged with something.</p>
<p>Um, what was being delivered into my brain there was a, was</p>
<p>subtly false information about how dishonest and, um, you know, just generally</p>
<p>unethical, totally normal people are capable of being right.</p>
<p>It was like, it was, it is a funhouse mirror.</p>
<p>It was, I was seeing the most grotesque versions of people who I know, right.</p>
<p>People who I know I could sit down at dinner with and they would never behave</p>
<p>this way.</p>
<p>And yet they were, they were coming at me on Twitter in, I mean, it was essentially</p>
<p>turning ordinary people into sociopaths, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, people are just, um, you know, it&rsquo;s their analogies that many of us have</p>
<p>made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like one analogy is road rage, right?</p>
<p>Like people behave in the confines of a car in ways that they never would if they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have this metal box around them, you know, moving at speed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, all of that becomes quite hilarious and, and, um, you</p>
<p>know, obviously dysfunctional when they&rsquo;re actually have to stop at the light next to</p>
<p>the person they just flipped off.</p>
<p>And they realized they didn&rsquo;t realize, they didn&rsquo;t understand that the person</p>
<p>coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower ear is someone who they never</p>
<p>would have rolled their eyes at in public because they would have taken one look at</p>
<p>this person and realized this is the last person you want to fight with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the heartbreaking things is to see, see people who I know, who I</p>
<p>admire, who I know are friends be everything from snarky to downright, uh, mean, um, uh,</p>
<p>derisive towards each other.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Like this, this is the only place where I&rsquo;ve seen people I really admire who have</p>
<p>had a calm head about most things, like really be shitty to other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the only place I&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>And I, I don&rsquo;t, I tend, I choose to maybe believe that that&rsquo;s not really them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the system.</p>
<p>Um, like if you go paintballing, if you, Jordan Peterson and, uh, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>shoot your friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to shoot your friends, but you kind of accept that that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing in this little game that you&rsquo;re playing, but it&rsquo;s sometimes</p>
<p>hard to remind yourself of that.</p>
<p>Well, and I, I think I was guilty of that.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s nothing I, I don&rsquo;t think I ever did</p>
<p>anything that I really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing me to</p>
<p>the edge of snideness somehow.</p>
<p>And, um, it&rsquo;s just not healthy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not, uh, I&rsquo;m so, so the, so the reason why I deleted my Twitter</p>
<p>account in the end was that it was obviously making me a worse person.</p>
<p>And, and so, and yeah, is there some way to be on there where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not making you a worse person?</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m sure there is, but it&rsquo;s given the nature of the platform and given what</p>
<p>was coming back at me on it, the way to do that is just to basically use it as</p>
<p>a one-way channel of, of communication.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;s just, just marketing.</p>
<p>And I was like, here, here&rsquo;s what I, what I&rsquo;m paying attention to look at it if</p>
<p>you want to, and you just push it out.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t look at what&rsquo;s coming back at you.</p>
<p>I put out a call for questions on Twitter and then actually quite</p>
<p>surprising, there&rsquo;s a lot of good.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re like, even if they&rsquo;re critical, they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>being thoughtful, which is nice.</p>
<p>I used it that way too.</p>
<p>And that was what kept me hooked.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also, uh, TouchBalls69 wrote a question.</p>
<p>Ask what?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>This is part of it.</p>
<p>But one way to solve this is, you know, we&rsquo;ve got to get rid of anonymity for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let me ask the question, ask Sam why he sucks was the question.</p>
<p>Well, one, one reason why I sucked was Twitter.</p>
<p>That was, uh, and I, I&rsquo;ve since solved that problem.</p>
<p>So TouchBalls69 should be happy that I suck a little bit less now that I&rsquo;m off</p>
<p>Twitter, I don&rsquo;t have to hear from TouchBalls69 on the regular.</p>
<p>The fact that you have to see that it probably can have a negative effect,</p>
<p>just even a moderation, just to see that there is like, for me, the negative</p>
<p>effect is, um, slightly losing faith in the underlying kindness of humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can also just reason your way out of it saying that this is anonymity and</p>
<p>this is kind of fun and this kind of just the shit show of Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But it does mentally affect you a little bit.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t read too much into that kind of comment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s just, uh, trolling and it&rsquo;s, you know, I, I get</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s I, I get, I understand the fun the person is having on the other side of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you though?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Well, I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, I don&rsquo;t behave that way, but I do.</p>
<p>And for all I know that person could be, you know, 16 years old.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it could be also an alt account for Elon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, no, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Elon would just tweet that, uh, under his own name at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Oh man, you love each other.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the, do you think, so speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter, uh,</p>
<p>is there something that he could do to make this platform better?</p>
<p>This Twitter and just social media in general, but because of the aggressive</p>
<p>nature of his innovation that he&rsquo;s pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a</p>
<p>pleasant place for Sam Harris?</p>
<p>Uh, maybe.</p>
<p>Like in the next five years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I think I&rsquo;m agnostic as to whether or not he or anyone could make a social</p>
<p>media platform that really was healthy.</p>
<p>So you were just observing yourself week by week, seeing the effect it has on your</p>
<p>mind and on how much you&rsquo;re actually learning and growing as a person.</p>
<p>And it was negative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also seen the negativity in other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obviously, I mean, he&rsquo;s not gonna, he&rsquo;s not going to admit it, but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s obviously negative for Elon.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just not, it&rsquo;s, uh, that was one of the things that, you know, you</p>
<p>know, when I was looking into the fun house mirror, I was also seeing the fun</p>
<p>house mirror on his side of Twitter.</p>
<p>And it was just even more exaggerated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when I, when I was asking myself, why is he spending his time this</p>
<p>way, I then reflected on why, why, you know, why was I spending my time this way</p>
<p>to a lesser degree, right.</p>
<p>And at lesser scale and at lesser risk, frankly, right.</p>
<p>And so, um, and it was just so, it&rsquo;s not just Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, this isn&rsquo;t part, an internet phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the, the, the whole Hunter Biden mess that you, you, um, explored.</p>
<p>That was based on, I mean, it was on, I was on somebody&rsquo;s podcast, but that was</p>
<p>based on a clip taken from that podcast, which was highly misleading as to the,</p>
<p>the general shape of my remarks on that podcast.</p>
<p>Even, you know, I, I had to then do my own podcast, uh, untangling all of that</p>
<p>and admitting that even in, even in the full context, I was not speaking</p>
<p>especially well and didn&rsquo;t say exactly what I thought in a way that was, would</p>
<p>have been recognizable to anyone, you know, even someone with not functioning</p>
<p>by a, a spirit of charity, but, but the clip was quite distinct from the podcast</p>
<p>The reality is, is that we&rsquo;re living in an environment now where people are so</p>
<p>lazy and there&rsquo;s, their, their, their attention is so fragmented that they,</p>
<p>they only have time for clips, but 99% of people will see a clip and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>assume there&rsquo;s no relevant context.</p>
<p>I need to understand what happened in that clip, right?</p>
<p>And obviously the people who make those clips know that, right.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing that quite, doing it quite maliciously.</p>
<p>And in this case, the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other</p>
<p>podcasts was quite maliciously trying to engineer, you know, some</p>
<p>reputational, uh, immolation for me.</p>
<p>Um, and being signal boosted by Elon and other prominent people who can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>the time to watch anything other than a clip, even when it&rsquo;s their friend or</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s ostensibly their friend in that clip, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a total failure, an understandable failure of ethics that everyone is so</p>
<p>short on time and they&rsquo;re so fucking lazy that they&rsquo;re just, and, and, and we now</p>
<p>have these contexts in which we react so quickly to things, right?</p>
<p>Like Twitter is inviting an instantaneous reaction to this clip, um, that it&rsquo;s, um,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just too tempting to just say something and not know what you&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>commenting on.</p>
<p>And most of, most of the people who saw that clip don&rsquo;t understand what I, what I</p>
<p>actually think about any of these issues.</p>
<p>And the irony is people are going to find clips from this conversation that are just</p>
<p>as misleading and they&rsquo;re going to export those.</p>
<p>And then people are going to be dunking on those clips and, you know, we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>living and dying by clips now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, um, it&rsquo;s dysfunctional.</p>
<p>See, I think it&rsquo;s possible to create a platform.</p>
<p>I think we will keep living on clips, but you know, when I saw that clip of you</p>
<p>talking about children and so on, just knowing that you have a sense of humor,</p>
<p>you just went to a dark place in terms of humor.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like, I didn&rsquo;t even bother.</p>
<p>And then I knew that the way clips work is that people will use it for virality&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sake, but the giving, giving a person benefit of the doubt, that&rsquo;s not even the</p>
<p>right term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I was, it&rsquo;s really like interpreting it in the context of knowing</p>
<p>your past.</p>
<p>The truth is you even need, like, I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when</p>
<p>I see a clip of Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, so, because there are famous clips of Trump that are very misleading as to</p>
<p>what he was saying in context.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been honest about that.</p>
<p>Like the whole, you know, there were good people on both sides scandal around the</p>
<p>his remarks after Charlottesville, like the clip that got exported and got promoted</p>
<p>by everyone, you know, left of center from Biden on down, you know, the New York</p>
<p>Times, CNN, there&rsquo;s nobody that I&rsquo;m aware of who has honestly, you know,</p>
<p>apologized for what they did with that clip.</p>
<p>That clip, he did not say what he seemed to be saying in that clip about the Nazis</p>
<p>at Charlottesville.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I have always been very clear about that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, you know, even people who I think should be marginalized and people</p>
<p>who should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing</p>
<p>dangerous things and for bad reasons.</p>
<p>I think we should be honest about what they actually meant in context.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this goes to anyone else we might talk about, you know, who&rsquo;s more where the</p>
<p>case is much more confusing.</p>
<p>But yeah, so everyone&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just so and then I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to get to AI,</p>
<p>but, you know, the prospect of being able to manufacture clips with AI and deep</p>
<p>fakes and that where it&rsquo;s going to be hard for most people most of the time to even</p>
<p>figure out that whether they&rsquo;re in the presence of something real, you know,</p>
<p>forget about being divorced from context.</p>
<p>There was no context.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a misinformation apocalypse that we&rsquo;re right on the cusp of and, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Or it could be just a new world like where Alice going to Wonderland where humor is</p>
<p>the only thing we have and that will save us.</p>
<p>Maybe in the end, Trump&rsquo;s approach to social media was the right one after all.</p>
<p>Nothing is true and everything is absurd.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we can&rsquo;t live that way.</p>
<p>People function on the basis of what they assume is true, right?</p>
<p>They think people have functioned to do anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, you have to know what you think is going to happen or you have to</p>
<p>at least give a probabilistic waiting over the future.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re going to be incapacitated by, you&rsquo;re not going to, like, people want</p>
<p>certain things and they have to have a rational plan to get those desires gratified.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want to die.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want their kids to die.</p>
<p>You tell them that there&rsquo;s a comet hurtling toward Earth and they should get outside and</p>
<p>look up, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>And if it turns out it&rsquo;s misinformation, you know, it&rsquo;s going to matter because it</p>
<p>comes down to like, what medicines do you give your children, right?</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re going to be manufacturing fake journal articles.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, I&rsquo;m sure someone&rsquo;s using chat GPT for this reader as we speak.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not credible, if it&rsquo;s not persuasive now to most people, I mean, honestly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to, I&rsquo;ll be amazed if it&rsquo;s a year before we can actually</p>
<p>create journal articles.</p>
<p>They would take, you know, a PhD to debunk that are completely fake.</p>
<p>And there are people who are celebrating this kind of, you know, coming cataclysm,</p>
<p>but I just, it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re the people who don&rsquo;t have anything to lose, who are</p>
<p>celebrating it or just are so confused that they just don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>stake.</p>
<p>And then there are the people who have met the few people who we could count on a few</p>
<p>hands, who have managed to insulate themselves, or at least imagine they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>insulated themselves from the downside here enough that they&rsquo;re not implicated in</p>
<p>the great unraveling we are witnessing or could witness.</p>
<p>The shaking up of what is true.</p>
<p>So actually that returns us to experts.</p>
<p>Do you think experts can save us?</p>
<p>Is there such thing as expertise and experts at something?</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;ve achieved it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge upfront that there&rsquo;s something paradoxical</p>
<p>about how we relate to authority, especially within science.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that paradox is going away and it&rsquo;s just, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>confusing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and it&rsquo;s not truly a paradox.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like there are different moments in time.</p>
<p>So it is true to say that within science or within rationality generally, I mean,</p>
<p>whenever you&rsquo;re having a fact-based discussion about anything, it is true to say</p>
<p>that the truth or falsity of a statement does not even slightly depend on the</p>
<p>credentials of the person making the statement, right?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a Nobel laureate, you can be wrong, right?</p>
<p>The thing you could, the last sentence you spoke could be total bullshit, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible for someone who&rsquo;s deeply uninformed to be right about</p>
<p>something or to be right for the wrong reasons, right?</p>
<p>Or someone just gets lucky or someone, or, or, and there are, there are middling</p>
<p>cases where you have like a, a backyard astronomer who&rsquo;s got no credentials, but</p>
<p>he just loves astronomy and he&rsquo;s got a telescope and it&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s spent a lot of</p>
<p>time looking at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has</p>
<p>seen, you know, not even the professional expert astronomers.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to think that happens less and less now, but, but some version of</p>
<p>that keeps happening and it may always keep happening in every area of expertise.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational concerns we have among</p>
<p>apes who are talking about the truth.</p>
<p>Um, but it is also true that most of the time real experts are much more reliable</p>
<p>than frauds or people who are not experts, right?</p>
<p>Or, you know, so, and expertise really is a thing, right?</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s, you know, when you&rsquo;re flying an airplane in a, in a storm, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want just randos come into the cockpit saying, listen, I&rsquo;ve got a new</p>
<p>idea about how to, you know, how we should tweak these controls, right?</p>
<p>You want someone who&rsquo;s a trained pilot and, and, and that training gave them</p>
<p>something, right?</p>
<p>It gave them a set of competencies and intuitions and they, they know what all</p>
<p>those dials and switches do, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be flying that plane.</p>
<p>Um, so when things really matter, you know, and putting this at 30,000 feet in a</p>
<p>storm sharpens this up, we want real experts to be in charge, right?</p>
<p>And we are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time on a lot of issues, right?</p>
<p>And whether they&rsquo;re public health issues, whether it&rsquo;s issue, whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>geopolitical emergency like Ukraine, what you made the climate change.</p>
<p>I mean, just pick your, pick your topic.</p>
<p>Um, there are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking and</p>
<p>their solutions are non-obvious, right?</p>
<p>And, and so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts much of</p>
<p>the time makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at minimum, it, it prevents either spectacular errors of incompetence</p>
<p>and, and, uh, just, uh, you know, foolhardiness, but even in, in the</p>
<p>case of some where you&rsquo;re talking about someone, I mean, people like</p>
<p>ourselves who are like, we&rsquo;re well-educated, we, we&rsquo;re not the, the</p>
<p>worst possible candidates for, you know, the Dunning-Kruger effect when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into a new area where we&rsquo;re not experts, we&rsquo;re fairly alert to the</p>
<p>possibility that we don&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s not as simple as things seem at first.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t, you know, we don&rsquo;t know how our tools translate to this new area.</p>
<p>We can be fairly circumspect, but we&rsquo;re also, because we&rsquo;re well-educated.</p>
<p>We, we can, we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re pretty quick studies.</p>
<p>We can learn a lot of things pretty fast and we can begin to play a language</p>
<p>game that sounds fairly expert, right?</p>
<p>And in that case, the, the invitation to do your own research, right?</p>
<p>Is in, when, when times are good, I view as an invitation to</p>
<p>waste your time pointlessly, right?</p>
<p>When times are good.</p>
<p>Now, the truth is times are not all that good, right?</p>
<p>And we have the, the ongoing public display of failures of expertise.</p>
<p>We have experts who are obviously corrupted by bad incentives.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got experts who, you know, perversely won&rsquo;t admit they were wrong</p>
<p>when they in fact, you know, are demonstrated to be wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got institutions that have been captured by a political</p>
<p>ideology that&rsquo;s not truth tracking.</p>
<p>I mean, this, this, this whole woke encroachment into really every place,</p>
<p>you know, whether it&rsquo;s universities or science journals or government, or,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like, that is, that has been genuinely deranging.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot going on that where, where experts and, and the very concept</p>
<p>of expertise has seemed to discredit itself, but the reality is that there</p>
<p>is a massive difference when anything matters, when there&rsquo;s anything to know</p>
<p>about anything, there is a massive difference most of the time between</p>
<p>someone who has really done the work to understand that domain</p>
<p>and someone who hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if I get sick or someone close to me gets sick, you know, I, I have</p>
<p>a PhD in neuroscience, right?</p>
<p>So I can read a medical journal article and understand a lot of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I, you know, so I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m just fairly conversant with, you</p>
<p>know, medical terminology.</p>
<p>And I understand its methods and I, I&rsquo;m alert to the difference because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, because in neuroscience, I&rsquo;ve spent hours and hours in</p>
<p>journal clubs, you know, diagnosing, you know, the different, analyzing</p>
<p>the difference between good and bad studies, I&rsquo;m alert to the difference</p>
<p>between good and bad studies in medical journals, right?</p>
<p>And I understand that bad studies can get published and, you know, et cetera.</p>
<p>And, and, and experiments can be poorly designed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alert to all of those things, but when I get sick or when someone</p>
<p>close to me gets sick, I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a doctor, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve got no clinical experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go down the rabbit hole on Google for days at a stretch trying</p>
<p>to become a doctor, much less a specialist in the domain of problem</p>
<p>that has been visited upon me or my family, right?</p>
<p>So if someone close to me gets cancer, I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an oncologist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go out and start, I don&rsquo;t start reading, you know, in journals</p>
<p>of oncology and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s, one is a, one is a bad and potential and very likely</p>
<p>misleading use of my time, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, if I decide, if I had, if I had a lot of runway, if I decided,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s really important for me to know everything I can at this point.</p>
<p>I want to, I know someone&rsquo;s going to get cancer.</p>
<p>I may not go back to school and become an oncologist, but what I want to do is I want</p>
<p>to know everything I can know about cancer, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take the next four years and spend most of my time on cancer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I could do that, right?</p>
<p>I still think that&rsquo;s a waste of my time.</p>
<p>Uh, I still think at the end of, even at the end of those four years, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to be the best person to, to form intuitions about what to do in the face</p>
<p>of the next cancer that I have to confront.</p>
<p>Um, I&rsquo;m still going to want a better oncologist than I&rsquo;ve become to tell me</p>
<p>what he or she would do if they were in my shoes or in the shoes of my family</p>
<p>member, I&rsquo;m going to, you know, what I&rsquo;m, what I&rsquo;m not advocating, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>advocating a, a blind trust in authority.</p>
<p>Like if you get cancer and you&rsquo;re talking to one oncologist and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>recommending some course of treatment, by all means, get a second opinion,</p>
<p>get a third opinion, right?</p>
<p>But it matters that those opinions are coming from real experts and not</p>
<p>from, you know, Robert Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>You know, who&rsquo;s telling you that, you know, you got it because</p>
<p>you got a vaccine, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just, it, it, there&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re swimming in a sea of</p>
<p>misinformation where you&rsquo;ve got people who are moving the opinions of millions</p>
<p>of others who, who should not have an opinion on these topics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there is no scenario in which you should be getting your opinion</p>
<p>about vaccine safety or, or climate change or the war in Ukraine or anything</p>
<p>else that we might want to talk about from Candace Owens, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, like, like she, she&rsquo;s not a relevant expert on any of those</p>
<p>topics and what&rsquo;s more, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to care, right?</p>
<p>And, and, and she&rsquo;s living in a culture that has had, that has amplified that</p>
<p>not caring into a business model and an effective business model, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, and that is something very Trumpian about all that.</p>
<p>Or like, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the problem, the problem is, is the culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not these specific individuals.</p>
<p>So, so the paradox here is that expertise is a real thing.</p>
<p>And we defer to it a lot as a, as a labor-saving device.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as, and just based on the, the, the, the, the reality that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hard to be a polymath, right?</p>
<p>And specialization is a thing, right?</p>
<p>And so there are people who specialize in a very narrow topic.</p>
<p>They know more about that topic than the next guy, no matter how smart that,</p>
<p>that guy or gal is, and, and that those differences matter.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that when you&rsquo;re talking about facts, sometimes the,</p>
<p>the, the, the best experts are wrong.</p>
<p>The scientific consensus is wrong.</p>
<p>You get a, a, a sea change in the thinking of a whole field because one</p>
<p>person who&rsquo;s an outlier for whatever reason decides, okay, I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to prove this point and they prove it, right?</p>
<p>So somebody like the doctor who believed that, that stomach ulcers were not due</p>
<p>to stress, but were due to, to H. pylori infections, right?</p>
<p>So he just drank a vial of H. pylori bacteria and, and proved, and then</p>
<p>quickly got an ulcer and convinced the field that, that at minimum H.</p>
<p>pylori was involved in, in that process.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yes, everyone was wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t disprove the reality of expertise.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time,</p>
<p>especially in an emergency, especially when the clock is ticking,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in this particular cockpit and</p>
<p>you only have one chance to land this plane, right?</p>
<p>You want the real pilot at the controls.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just a few things to say.</p>
<p>So one, you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research.</p>
<p>There, there&rsquo;s several things that are different about our particular time in</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>One, doing your own research has become more and more effective because you can</p>
<p>read, the internet made information a lot more accessible, so you can read a lot of</p>
<p>different meta-analyses.</p>
<p>You can read blog posts that describe to you exactly the flaws in the different</p>
<p>papers that make up the meta, meta-analyses.</p>
<p>They, and, and you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with each</p>
<p>other, and you can take that information in, and in a short amount of time,</p>
<p>you can start to make good faith interpretations.</p>
<p>For example, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t want to overstate things, but if you suffer from</p>
<p>depression, for example, then there, you could go to an expert and a doctor that</p>
<p>prescribes you some medication, but you could also challenge some of those ideas</p>
<p>and seeing like, what are the different medications?</p>
<p>What are the different side effects?</p>
<p>What are the different solutions to depression?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff, and I think depression is just a really difficult</p>
<p>problem that&rsquo;s very, I don&rsquo;t want to, again, state incorrect things, but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of variability of what depression really means, so being</p>
<p>introspective about the type of depression you have and the different possible</p>
<p>solutions you have, just doing your own research as a first step before</p>
<p>approaching a doctor, or as you have multiple opinions, could be very</p>
<p>beneficial in that case.</p>
<p>Now, depression, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been studied for a very long time.</p>
<p>With a new pandemic that&rsquo;s affecting everybody, it&rsquo;s, you know, with the</p>
<p>airplane, equated to like 9-11 or something, like, a new emergency just</p>
<p>happened, and everybody, every expert in the world is publishing on it and</p>
<p>talking about it, so doing your own research there could be exceptionally</p>
<p>effective in asking questions, and then there&rsquo;s a difference between experts,</p>
<p>virologists, and it&rsquo;s actually a good question, who is exactly the expert in a</p>
<p>pandemic, but there&rsquo;s the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the communicators of that expertise, and the question is, if</p>
<p>the communicators are flawed, to a degree where doing your own research is</p>
<p>actually the more effective way to figure out policies and solutions,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not competing with experts, you&rsquo;re competing with the</p>
<p>communicators of expertise, that could be WHO, CDC in the case of the pandemic,</p>
<p>or politicians, or political type of science figures like Anthony Fauci,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question there of the effectiveness of doing your research,</p>
<p>your own research in that context, and the competing forces there, incentives</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve mentioned, is you can become quite popular by being contrarian, by</p>
<p>saying everybody&rsquo;s lying to you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the</p>
<p>institutions are lying to you, so those are the waters you&rsquo;re swimming in, but I</p>
<p>think doing your own research in that kind of context could be quite effective.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying you shouldn&rsquo;t do any research, right, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that you shouldn&rsquo;t be informed about an issue, I&rsquo;m not saying you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t read articles on whatever the topic is, and yes, if I got cancer,</p>
<p>or someone close to me got cancer, I probably would read more about cancer</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;ve read thus far about cancer, and I&rsquo;ve read some, so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>making a virtue of ignorance and a blind obedience to authority, and again, I</p>
<p>recognize that authorities can discredit themselves, or they can be</p>
<p>wrong, they can be wrong even when there&rsquo;s no discredit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot we don&rsquo;t understand about the nature of the world, but</p>
<p>still, this vast gulf between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists, it</p>
<p>always exists, and conspiracy thinking is rather often, you know, most of the</p>
<p>time, a species of bullshit, but it&rsquo;s not always wrong, right, there are real</p>
<p>conspiracies, and there really are just awful corruptions born of</p>
<p>bad incentives within our scientific processes, within institutions,</p>
<p>and again, we&rsquo;ve mentioned a lot of these things in passing, but what woke</p>
<p>political ideology did to scientific communication during the pandemic was</p>
<p>awful, and it was really corrosive of public trust, especially on the right,</p>
<p>for understandable reasons, I mean, it was just, it was crazy, some of the things</p>
<p>that were being said, and still is, and these cases are all different, so like</p>
<p>you take depression, we just don&rsquo;t know enough about depression for, you know,</p>
<p>anyone to be that confident about anything, right, and there are many</p>
<p>different modalities in which to interact with it as a problem, right, so</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals have whatever promise they have, but there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>reason to be concerned that they don&rsquo;t work well for everybody, and I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious they don&rsquo;t work well for everybody, but they do work for some</p>
<p>people, but again, depression is a multifactorial problem, and there are</p>
<p>different levels at which to influence it, and there are things like</p>
<p>meditation, there are things like just life changes, and you know, one of the</p>
<p>perverse things about depression is that when you&rsquo;re depressed, all of the things</p>
<p>that would be good for you to do are precisely the things you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do, you don&rsquo;t have any energy to socialize, you don&rsquo;t want to get things</p>
<p>done, you don&rsquo;t want to exercise, you know, and all of those things, if you got</p>
<p>those up and running, they do make you feel better, you know, in the aggregate,</p>
<p>but the reality is that there, you know, there are clinical level depressions</p>
<p>that are so bad that it&rsquo;s just, we just don&rsquo;t have good tools for them, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not enough to tell you, there&rsquo;s no life change someone&rsquo;s going to embrace</p>
<p>that is going to be an obvious remedy for that.</p>
<p>I mean, pandemics are obviously a complicated problem, but I would</p>
<p>consider it much simpler than depression in terms of, you know, what&rsquo;s on the menu</p>
<p>to be chosen among the various choices. It&rsquo;s less multifactorial. The logic by</p>
<p>which you would make those choices, yeah. So it&rsquo;s like, we have a virus, we have a</p>
<p>new virus, it&rsquo;s some version of bad, you know, it&rsquo;s human transmissible, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still catching up, we&rsquo;re catching up to every aspect of it. We don&rsquo;t know how it</p>
<p>spreads. We don&rsquo;t know how effective masks are. Well, at a certain point, we</p>
<p>knew it was respiratory, and whether it&rsquo;s spread by fomites,</p>
<p>we were confused about a lot of things, and we&rsquo;re still confused. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a moving target this whole time, and it&rsquo;s been changing this whole time, and</p>
<p>our responses to it have been, you know, we ramped up the vaccines as quickly</p>
<p>as we could, but, you know, too quick for some, not quick enough for</p>
<p>others. We could have done human challenge trials and got them out more</p>
<p>quickly with better data, and I think that&rsquo;s something we should probably</p>
<p>look at in the future, because to my eye, that would make ethical sense</p>
<p>to do challenge trials. And so much of my concern about COVID, I mean,</p>
<p>many people are confused about my concern about COVID. My concern about</p>
<p>COVID has, for much of the time, not been narrowly focused on COVID itself, how</p>
<p>dangerous I perceive COVID to be as a illness. It has been, for the longest</p>
<p>time, even more a concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary</p>
<p>pathogen next time. Like, for, you know, outside those initial months, you</p>
<p>know, give me the first six months to be quite worried about COVID and the</p>
<p>unraveling of society, but&hellip; And the supply of toilet paper. You want to secure a steady</p>
<p>supply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period, when we had a sense</p>
<p>of what we were dealing with, and we had every hope that the vaccines are</p>
<p>actually going to work, and we knew we were getting those vaccines in</p>
<p>short order, right? Beyond that, and we knew just how dangerous the</p>
<p>illness was and how dangerous it wasn&rsquo;t. For years now, I&rsquo;ve just been worrying</p>
<p>about this as a failed dress rehearsal for something much worse, right? I think</p>
<p>what we prove to ourselves at this moment in history is that we have built</p>
<p>informational tools that we do not know how to use, and we have made ourselves&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically enrolled all of human society into a psychological experiment</p>
<p>that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve</p>
<p>coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve next time, when things are</p>
<p>worse. Do you understand who&rsquo;s at fault for the way this unraveled? The way</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t seem to have the distrust in institutions and the institution of</p>
<p>science that grew seemingly exponentially or got revealed through</p>
<p>this process. Who is at fault here? And what&rsquo;s to fix? So much blame to go</p>
<p>around, but so much of it is not a matter of bad people conspiring to do bad</p>
<p>things. It&rsquo;s a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives and just</p>
<p>ordinary, you know, plain vanilla dysfunction. But my problem was that</p>
<p>people like you, people like Brett Weinstein, people that I look to for</p>
<p>reasonable, difficult conversations on difficult topics, have a little bit lost</p>
<p>their mind, became emotional and dogmatic in style of conversation, perhaps not in</p>
<p>the depth of actual ideas. But there, you know, a tweet something of that nature,</p>
<p>not about you, but just it feels like the pandemic made people really more</p>
<p>emotional than before. And then Kimball Musk responded, I think something I think</p>
<p>you probably would agree with. Maybe not. I think it was the combo of Trump and</p>
<p>the pandemic. Trump triggered the far-left to be way more active than they</p>
<p>could have been without him. And then the pandemic handed big government, nanny</p>
<p>state, lefties a huge platform on a silver platter, a one-two punch, and here</p>
<p>we are. I would agree with some of that. I&rsquo;m not sure how much to read into the</p>
<p>nanny state concept, but&hellip; But yet, like, basically got people on the far-left</p>
<p>really activated. Yeah. And then gave control to, I don&rsquo;t know if you say</p>
<p>nanny state, but just control to government that, when executed poorly, has</p>
<p>created a complete distrust in government. My fear is that there was</p>
<p>going to be that complete distrust anyway, given the nature of the</p>
<p>information space, given the level of conspiracy thinking, given the gaming of</p>
<p>of these tools by an anti-vax cult. I mean, there really is an anti-vax cult</p>
<p>that just ramped up its energy during this moment. But it&rsquo;s a small one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that everything, every concern about vaccines is a species of,</p>
<p>is born of misinformation or born of this cult, but there is a cult that is</p>
<p>just, you know, and the core of Trumpism is a cult. I mean, QAnon is a</p>
<p>cult. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of lying and there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion. You know,</p>
<p>there are&hellip; It&rsquo;s almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some people are</p>
<p>and how fully their lives are organized around that confusion. I mean,</p>
<p>there are people who think that the world&rsquo;s being run by pedophile cannibals</p>
<p>and that, you know, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama are among</p>
<p>those cannibals. I mean, like, they&rsquo;re&hellip; Adjacent to the pure crazy, there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>semi-crazy, and adjacent to the semi-crazy, there&rsquo;s the grifting opportunist</p>
<p>asshole. And the layers of bad faith are, you know, hard to fully</p>
<p>diagnose. But the problem is, all of this is getting signal boosted by an</p>
<p>outrage machine that is preferentially spreading misinformation. It has a</p>
<p>business model that is guaranteed that it is preferentially sharing</p>
<p>misinformation. Actually, just on a small tangent, how do you defend yourself</p>
<p>against the claim that you&rsquo;re a pedophile cannibal? It&rsquo;s difficult. Here&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>I would make, because I don&rsquo;t think you can use reason. I think you have to</p>
<p>use empathy. You have to understand. But what, like, part of it, I mean, I find it very</p>
<p>difficult to believe that anyone believes these things. I mean, I think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some number of people who are</p>
<p>just pretending to believe these things because it&rsquo;s just, again, this is</p>
<p>sort of like the 4chanification of everything. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just Pepe the Frog, right? Like, none of this is what it seems. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>signaling an alliance with white supremacy or neo-nazism, but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing it. Like, they just don&rsquo;t fucking care. It&rsquo;s just cynicism overflowing its</p>
<p>banks, right? It&rsquo;s just fun to wind up the normies, right? Like, look at all the</p>
<p>normies who don&rsquo;t understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even</p>
<p>when it isn&rsquo;t just a green frog, right? It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s just gumming up</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s cognitive bandwidth with bullshit, right? I get that that&rsquo;s fun if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a teenager and you just want to vandalize our newsphere, but at a</p>
<p>certain point, we have to recognize that real questions of human welfare are in</p>
<p>play, right? There&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re really, there is this, there are wars getting</p>
<p>fought or not fought, and there&rsquo;s a pandemic raging, and there&rsquo;s medicine to</p>
<p>take or not take. But I mean, to come back to this issue of COVID, I don&rsquo;t think my,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I got so out of balance around COVID. I think people are quite</p>
<p>confused about what I was concerned about. I mean, like, there was a, yes, there was</p>
<p>a period where I was crazy because anyone who was taking it seriously was</p>
<p>crazy because they had no idea what was going on. And so it&rsquo;s like, yes, I was</p>
<p>wiping down packages with alcohol wipes, right? Because people thought it</p>
<p>was transmissible by touch, right? That&rsquo;s so, and then when we realized</p>
<p>that was no longer the case, I stopped doing that. But so there, again, it was a</p>
<p>moving target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school</p>
<p>closures looked fairly dysfunctional, right? But unnecessary. I think the</p>
<p>criticism that people would say about your talking about COVID, and maybe</p>
<p>you can correct me, but you were skeptic, or you were against skepticism of the</p>
<p>safety and efficacy of the vaccine. So people who get nervous about the vaccine</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t fall into the usual anti-vax camp, which I think there was a</p>
<p>significant enough number, they&rsquo;re asking, they&rsquo;re getting nervous. I mean,</p>
<p>especially after the war in Afghanistan or Iraq, I too was nervous about anything</p>
<p>where a lot of money could be made. And you start, you just see how the people</p>
<p>who are greedy, they come to the surface all of a sudden, and a lot of them</p>
<p>that run institutions, actually really good human beings, I know a lot of them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to know how those two combine together when there&rsquo;s hundreds</p>
<p>of billions, trillions of dollars to be made. And so that skepticism, I guess you,</p>
<p>the sense was that you weren&rsquo;t open enough to the skepticism.</p>
<p>I understand that people have that sense. I&rsquo;ll tell you how I thought about it and</p>
<p>think about it. One, again, it was a moving target. So there was a point in the</p>
<p>timeline where it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both</p>
<p>working, both they were they were reasonably safe, and that</p>
<p>COVID was reasonably dangerous, and that the trade-off for basically everyone was</p>
<p>it was rational to get vaccinated, given the level of testing</p>
<p>and how many people had been vaccinated before you, given what we were seeing</p>
<p>with COVID, that that was a forced choice. You&rsquo;re eventually going to get COVID,</p>
<p>and the question is, do you want to be vaccinated when you do? There was a</p>
<p>period where that forced choice, where it was just obviously reasonable to get</p>
<p>vaccinated, especially because there was every reason to expect that while</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a perfectly sterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock down</p>
<p>transmission a lot, and that matters. And so it wasn&rsquo;t just a personal choice. You</p>
<p>were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run whatever risk you</p>
<p>were going to run to get vaccinated, because there are people in our</p>
<p>society who actually can&rsquo;t get vaccinated. I mean, I know people who can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take any vaccines. They&rsquo;re so allergic. I mean, they, in their own</p>
<p>person, seem to justify all of the fears of the anti-vax cult. I mean, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr. can point to and say, see,</p>
<p>vaccines will fucking kill you, right? Because of the experience, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still, I know people who have kids who fit that description, right? So</p>
<p>we should all feel a civic responsibility to be vaccinated against egregiously</p>
<p>awful and transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines</p>
<p>to keep those sorts of people safe. And there was a period of time when it was</p>
<p>thought that the vaccine could stop transmission. Yes. And so again, all of</p>
<p>this has begun to shift. I don&rsquo;t think it has shifted as much as Brett Weinstein</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s shifted, but yes, there are safety concerns around the mRNA vaccines,</p>
<p>especially for young men, right? As far as I know, that&rsquo;s the purview of actual</p>
<p>heightened concern. But also, there&rsquo;s now a lot of natural immunity out there. Basically,</p>
<p>everyone who was going to get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to</p>
<p>the point in this context where it seems less dangerous. Again, I&rsquo;m going more on</p>
<p>the seemings than on research that I&rsquo;ve done at this point, but I&rsquo;m certainly less worried</p>
<p>about getting COVID. I&rsquo;ve had it once. I&rsquo;ve been vaccinated. It&rsquo;s like, so you ask me now,</p>
<p>how do I feel about getting the next booster? I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m going to get the next booster,</p>
<p>right? So I was somebody who was waiting in line at four in the morning, hoping to get some</p>
<p>overflow vaccine when it was first available. And at that point, given what I thought I knew</p>
<p>based on the best sources I could consult and based on anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore,</p>
<p>both data and personal experience, it was totally rational for me to want to get that vaccine as</p>
<p>soon as I could. And now, I think it&rsquo;s totally rational for me to do a different kind of cost</p>
<p>benefit analysis and wonder, listen, do I really need to get a booster, right? How many of these</p>
<p>boosters am I going to get for the rest of my life, really? And how safe is the mRNA vaccine for</p>
<p>a man of my age, right? And do I need to be worried about myocarditis? All of that is</p>
<p>completely rational to talk about now. My concern is that at every point along the way,</p>
<p>I was the wrong person and Brett Weinstein was the wrong person, and there&rsquo;s many other people</p>
<p>I could add to this list, to have strong opinions about any of this stuff, right?</p>
<p>I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%, but I feel like experts</p>
<p>failed at communicating, not at doing- They did.</p>
<p>And I just feel like you and Brett Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet,</p>
<p>given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time,</p>
<p>deeply about the problems that face our world, that you actually have the tools</p>
<p>to do pretty good thinking here. The problem I have with experts-</p>
<p>But there would be deference to experts and pseudo-experts behind all of that.</p>
<p>Well, the papers, you would stand on the shoulders of giants, but you can surf those</p>
<p>shoulders better than the giants themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I knew we were going to disagree about that. I saw his podcast where he brought on these</p>
<p>experts who had, many of them had the right credentials, but for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t pass the smell test for me. One larger problem, and this goes back to the problem of</p>
<p>how we rely on authority in science, is that you can always find a PhD or an MD</p>
<p>to champion any crackpot idea, right? I mean, it is amazing, but you could find PhDs and MDs who</p>
<p>would sit up there in front of Congress and say that they thought smoking was not addictive,</p>
<p>or that it was not harmful. There was no direct link between smoking and lung cancer.</p>
<p>You could always find those people. Some of the people Brett found were people who had obvious</p>
<p>tells, to my point of view, to my eye, and I saw some of the same people were on Rogan&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard, because if a person does have the right credentials, and they&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>something floridly mistaken, and we&rsquo;re talking about something where they&rsquo;re genuine unknowns,</p>
<p>how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines? At that point, not a whole hell of a</p>
<p>lot. I mean, we have no long-term data on mRNA vaccines, but to confidently say that millions of</p>
<p>people are gonna die because of these vaccines, and to confidently say that ivermectin is a</p>
<p>panacea, right? Ivermectin is the thing that prevents COVID, right? There was no good reason</p>
<p>to say either of those things at that moment, and so, given that that&rsquo;s where Brett was,</p>
<p>I felt like there was just no, there was nothing to debate. We&rsquo;re both the wrong people to be</p>
<p>getting into the weeds on this. We&rsquo;re both gonna defer to our chosen experts. His experts look like</p>
<p>crackpots to me, or at least the ones who are most vociferous on those edgiest points that seem most-</p>
<p>And your experts seem like, what is the term, mass hysteria? I forgot the term.</p>
<p>Well, no, but it&rsquo;s like with climate science. I mean, this old, it&rsquo;s received as a canard</p>
<p>in half of our society now, but the claim that 97% of climate scientists agree that</p>
<p>human-caused climate change is a thing, right? So, do you go with the 97% most of the time,</p>
<p>or do you go with the 3% most of the time? It&rsquo;s obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for</p>
<p>anything that matters. It&rsquo;s not to say that the 3% are always wrong. Again, things get overturned,</p>
<p>and yes, as you say, and I&rsquo;ve spent much more time worrying about this on my podcast than I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent worrying about COVID, our institutions have lost trust for good reason, right? And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open question whether we can actually get things done with this level of transparency</p>
<p>and pseudo-transparency given our information ecosystems. Can we fight a war,</p>
<p>really fight a war that we may have to fight, like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when</p>
<p>everyone with an iPhone is showing just how awful it is that little girls get blown up when we drop</p>
<p>our bombs, right? Could we as a society do what we might have to do to actually get necessary</p>
<p>things done when we&rsquo;re living in this panopticon of just, you know, everyone&rsquo;s a journalist,</p>
<p>right? Everyone&rsquo;s a scientist, everyone&rsquo;s an expert, everyone&rsquo;s got direct contact with the</p>
<p>facts or a semblance of the facts. I don&rsquo;t know. I think yes, and I think voices like yours are</p>
<p>exceptionally important, and I think there&rsquo;s certain signals you send in your ability to</p>
<p>steal me on the other side in your empathy, essentially. So that&rsquo;s the fight, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mechanism by which you resist the dogmatism of this binary thinking. And then if you become a</p>
<p>trusted person that&rsquo;s able to consider the other side, then people will listen to you as the</p>
<p>aggregator, as the communicator of expertise. Because the virologists haven&rsquo;t been able to be</p>
<p>good communicators. I still, to this day, don&rsquo;t really know what am I supposed to think about the</p>
<p>safety and efficacy of the vaccines today? As it stands today, what are we supposed to think? What</p>
<p>are we supposed to think about testing? What are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of</p>
<p>masks or lockdowns? Where&rsquo;s the great communicators on this topic that consider all the other</p>
<p>conspiracy theories, all the communication that&rsquo;s out there, and actually aggregate it</p>
<p>together and be able to say this is actually what&rsquo;s most likely the truth? And also some of</p>
<p>that has to do with humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can&rsquo;t really know for sure.</p>
<p>Just like with depression, you can&rsquo;t really know for sure. I&rsquo;m not seeing those communications</p>
<p>being effectively done, even still today. Well, the jury is still out on some of it. And again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a moving target. And some of it, I mean, it&rsquo;s complicated. Some of it&rsquo;s a self-fulfilling</p>
<p>dynamic where, so like lockdowns, in theory, a lockdown would work if we could only do it.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t really do it. And there&rsquo;s a lot of people who won&rsquo;t do it because they&rsquo;re convinced</p>
<p>that this is the totalitarian boot finally on the neck of the good people who</p>
<p>are always having their interests introduced by the elites. So like this is, if you have enough</p>
<p>people who think the lockdown, for any reason, in the face of any conceivable illness,</p>
<p>is just code for the new world order coming to fuck you over and take your guns. Okay, you have</p>
<p>a society that is now immune to reason, right? Because there are absolutely certain pathogens</p>
<p>that we should lock down for next time, right? And it was completely rational in the beginning</p>
<p>of this thing to lock down, to attempt to lock down. We never really locked down.</p>
<p>To attempt some semblance of a lockdown just to, quote, bend the curve, to spare our healthcare</p>
<p>system, given what we were seeing happening in Italy, right? Like that moment was not hard to</p>
<p>navigate, at least in my view. It was obvious at the time. In retrospect, my views on that haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>changed, except for the fact that I recognize maybe it&rsquo;s just impossible, given the nature of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s response to that kind of demand, right? We live in a society that&rsquo;s just not gonna lock</p>
<p>down. Unless the pandemic is much more deadly. Right, so that&rsquo;s a point I made, which was</p>
<p>maliciously clipped out from some other podcast, where someone&rsquo;s trying to make it look like,</p>
<p>I wanna see children die. It&rsquo;s a pity more children didn&rsquo;t die from COVID, right?</p>
<p>This is actually the same person who&hellip; And that&rsquo;s the other thing that got so poisoned here. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that person, this psychopath, or effective psychopath, who&rsquo;s creating these clips of me on</p>
<p>podcasts. The second clip of me seeming to say that I wish more children died during COVID,</p>
<p>but it was so clear in context what I was saying, that even the clip betrayed the context,</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t actually work. This psycho, and again, I don&rsquo;t know whether he actually is a</p>
<p>psychopath, but he&rsquo;s behaving like one because of the incentives of Twitter. This is somebody who</p>
<p>Brett signal boosted as a very reliable source of information, right? He kept retweeting this guy</p>
<p>at me, against me, right? And this guy, at one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was,</p>
<p>right? But I think I&rsquo;m not at all&hellip; One thing I think I did wrong, one thing that I do regret,</p>
<p>one thing I have not sorted out for myself, is how to navigate the professional and personal</p>
<p>pressure that gets applied at this moment, where you have a friend, or an acquaintance,</p>
<p>or someone you know, who&rsquo;s behaving badly in public, or behaving in a way that you think</p>
<p>is bad in public, and they have a public platform where they&rsquo;re influencing a lot of people,</p>
<p>and you have your own public platform where you&rsquo;re constantly getting asked to comment</p>
<p>on what this friend, or acquaintance, or colleague is doing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t known what I think is ethically right about the choices that seem forced</p>
<p>on us at moments like this. So I&rsquo;ve criticized you in public about your interview with Kanye,</p>
<p>in that case, I reached out to you in private first, and told you exactly what I thought.</p>
<p>And then when I was gonna get asked in public, or when I was touching that topic on my</p>
<p>podcast, I more or less said the same thing that I said to you in private, right? Now,</p>
<p>that was how I navigated that moment. I did the same thing with Elon, at least at the beginning.</p>
<p>You know, we have maintained good vibes, which is not what I want to say about Elon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I disagree with you, because good vibes in the moment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deep core of good vibes that persists through time, between you and Elon, and I would</p>
<p>argue probably between some of the other folks you mentioned.</p>
<p>I think with Brett, I failed to reach out in private to the degree that I should have.</p>
<p>And we never really had, we had tried to set up a conversation in private that never happened, but</p>
<p>there was some communication, but it would have been much better for me to have made more of an</p>
<p>effort in private than I did before it spilled out into public. And I would say that&rsquo;s true with</p>
<p>other people as well. What kind of interaction in private do you think you should have with Brett?</p>
<p>Because my case would be beforehand, and now still. The case I would like, and this part of</p>
<p>the criticism you sent my way, maybe it&rsquo;s useful to go to that direction. Actually, let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>that direction, because I think I disagree with your criticism, as you stated publicly, but this</p>
<p>is very&hellip; You&rsquo;re talking about your interview with Kanye? Yeah, yeah. The thing you criticized</p>
<p>me for is actually the right thing to do with Brett. Okay, you said Lex could have spoken with</p>
<p>Kanye in such a way as to have produced a useful document. He didn&rsquo;t do that because he has a</p>
<p>fairly naive philosophy about the power of love. Let&rsquo;s see if you can maintain that philosophy</p>
<p>in the present. Let&rsquo;s go. No, it&rsquo;s beautiful. He seemed to think that if he just got through the</p>
<p>minefield to the end of the conversation, where the two of them still were feeling good about one</p>
<p>another and they can hug it out, that would be by definition a success. Let me make the case for</p>
<p>this power of love philosophy. First of all, I love you, Sam. You&rsquo;re still an inspiration and</p>
<p>somebody I deeply admire. Okay. Back at you. To me, in the case of Kanye, it&rsquo;s not only that you</p>
<p>get to the conversation and have hugs. It&rsquo;s that the display that you&rsquo;re willing to do that</p>
<p>has power. So even if it doesn&rsquo;t end in hugging, the actual turning the other cheek, the act of</p>
<p>turning the other cheek itself communicates both to Kanye later and to the rest of the world that</p>
<p>we should have empathy and compassion towards each other. There is power to that. Maybe that is</p>
<p>naive, but I believe in the power of that. So it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m trying to convince Kanye that</p>
<p>some of his ideas are wrong, but I&rsquo;m trying to illustrate that just the act of listening and</p>
<p>truly trying to understand the human being, that opens people&rsquo;s minds to actually questioning</p>
<p>their own beliefs more. It takes them out of the dogmatism. It de-escalates the kind of</p>
<p>dogmatism that I&rsquo;ve been seeing. So in that sense, I would say the power of love is the philosophy</p>
<p>you might apply to Brett, because the right conversation you have in private is not about,</p>
<p>hey, listen, the experts you&rsquo;re talking to, they seem credentialed, but they&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>as credentialed as they&rsquo;re illustrating. They&rsquo;re not grounding their findings in actual meta</p>
<p>analyses and papers and so on, like making a strong case, like what are you doing? This is</p>
<p>gonna get a lot of people in trouble. But instead just saying, like being a friend in the dumbest of</p>
<p>ways, being like respectful, sending love their way, and just having a conversation outside of</p>
<p>all of this. Like basically showing that like, removing the emotional attachment to this debate,</p>
<p>even though you are very emotionally attached, because in the case of COVID specifically,</p>
<p>there is a very large number of lives at stake. But removing all of that, and remembering that</p>
<p>you have a friendship. Yeah, well, so I think these are highly non-analogous cases, right?</p>
<p>So your conversation with Kanye misfired, from my point of view, for a very different reason.</p>
<p>And it has to do with Kanye. I mean, so Kanye, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never met Kanye,</p>
<p>so obviously I don&rsquo;t know him. But I think he&rsquo;s either obviously in the midst of a mental health</p>
<p>crisis, or he&rsquo;s a colossal asshole, or both. I mean, those aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. So one of</p>
<p>three possibilities, he&rsquo;s either mentally ill, he&rsquo;s an asshole, or he&rsquo;s mentally ill and an</p>
<p>asshole. I think all three of those possibilities are possible for the both of us as well.</p>
<p>No, I would argue none of those are likely for either of us. But not to say we don&rsquo;t have our</p>
<p>moments. So the reason not to talk to Kanye, so I think you should have had the conversation you</p>
<p>had with him in private, that&rsquo;s great. And I&rsquo;ve got no criticism of what you said, had it been</p>
<p>in private. I just thought you&rsquo;re not doing him a favor. If he&rsquo;s mentally ill, right? He&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>middle of a manic episode, or I&rsquo;m not a clinician, but I&rsquo;ve heard it said of him that he is bipolar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him and letting him go off on the Jews,</p>
<p>or anything else, right? We know what he thought about the Jews. We know that there&rsquo;s not much</p>
<p>illumination that&rsquo;s going to come from him on that topic. And if it is a symptom of his mental</p>
<p>illness that he thinks these things, well, then you&rsquo;re not doing him a favor making that</p>
<p>even more public. If he&rsquo;s just an asshole and he&rsquo;s just an antisemite, an ordinary</p>
<p>garden variety antisemite, well, then there&rsquo;s also not much to say unless you&rsquo;re really going</p>
<p>to dig in and kick the shit out of him in public. And I&rsquo;m saying you can do that with love. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the other thing here is that I don&rsquo;t agree that compassion and love always have</p>
<p>this patient, embracing, acquiescent face, right? They don&rsquo;t always feel good to the recipient,</p>
<p>right? There is a sort of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s full of shit and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your audience</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re full of shit. And there&rsquo;s no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could just say,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m going to do everyone a favor right now and just take your foot out of your mouth.</p>
<p>And the truth is, I just wouldn&rsquo;t have aired the conversation. I just don&rsquo;t think it was</p>
<p>a document that had to get out there, right? I get that many people&hellip; This is not a signal</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to get from your audience, right? I get that many people in your audience thought,</p>
<p>oh my God, that&rsquo;s awesome. You&rsquo;re talking to Kanye and you&rsquo;re doing it in Lex style,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just love, and you&rsquo;re not treating him like a pariah. And you&rsquo;re holding this tension</p>
<p>between he&rsquo;s this creative genius who is work we love, and yet he&rsquo;s having this moment that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so painful. And what a tightrope walk. And I get that maybe 90% of your audience saw it that way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still wrong. And I still think that was on balance, not a good thing to put out</p>
<p>into the world. You don&rsquo;t think it opens up the mind and heart of people that listen to that,</p>
<p>just seeing a person? If it does, it&rsquo;s opening up in the wrong direction where just gale force</p>
<p>nonsense is coming in, right? I think we should have an open mind and an open heart, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some clear things here that we have to keep in view. One is the mental illness component is its</p>
<p>own thing. I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand what&rsquo;s going on with him. But insofar as that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason he&rsquo;s saying what he&rsquo;s saying, do not put this guy on camera and let no people see it.</p>
<p>Sorry, on that point, real quick, I had a bunch of conversation with him offline,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t get a sense of mental illness. That&rsquo;s why I chose to sit down.</p>
<p>I mean, mental illness is such a&hellip;</p>
<p>But when he shows up in a gimp hood on Alex Jones&rsquo;s podcast, either that&rsquo;s more genius</p>
<p>performance in his world, or he&rsquo;s unraveling further.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put that under mental illness. I think there&rsquo;s another conversation to be had about</p>
<p>how we treat artists, because they&rsquo;re weirdos. They&rsquo;re very&hellip; I mean, taking words from Kanye</p>
<p>as if he&rsquo;s Christopher Hitchens or something like that, very eloquent, researched,</p>
<p>written many books on history, on politics, on geopolitics, on psychology. Kanye didn&rsquo;t do any</p>
<p>of that. He&rsquo;s an artist just spouting off. And so there&rsquo;s a different style of conversation</p>
<p>and a different way to treat the words that are coming out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave the mental illness aside. So if we&rsquo;re gonna say that there&rsquo;s no reason to think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mentally ill, and this is just him being creative and brilliant and opinionated, well, then that</p>
<p>falls into the asshole bucket for me. It&rsquo;s like then he&rsquo;s someone&hellip; And honestly, the most</p>
<p>offensive thing about him in that interview, from my point of view, is not the antisemitism,</p>
<p>which we can talk about, because I think there are problems just letting him</p>
<p>spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusionally</p>
<p>egocentric he is, or was coming off in that interview and in others. He has an estimation</p>
<p>of himself as this omnibus genius, not only to rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like he is the greatest mind that has ever walked among us. And he&rsquo;s more or less</p>
<p>explicit on that point, and yet he manages to talk for hours without saying anything actually</p>
<p>interesting or insightful or factually illuminating. So it&rsquo;s complete delusion</p>
<p>of a very Trumpian sort. It&rsquo;s like when Trump says he&rsquo;s a genius who understands everything,</p>
<p>but nobody takes him seriously, one wonders whether Trump takes himself seriously.</p>
<p>Kanye seems to believe his own press. He actually thinks he&rsquo;s just a colossus.</p>
<p>And he may be a great musician. It&rsquo;s certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him to any other</p>
<p>musicians. But one thing that&rsquo;s patently obvious from your conversation is he&rsquo;s not who he thinks</p>
<p>he is intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. And so when you couple that to</p>
<p>the antisemitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious and ill-considered and</p>
<p>has potential knock-on effects in the Black community. I mean, there&rsquo;s an ambient level</p>
<p>of antisemitism in the Black community that is worth worrying about and talking about anyway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of guys playing the knockout game in Brooklyn, just punching Orthodox Jews in the</p>
<p>face. And I think letting Kanye air his antisemitism that publicly only raises the likelihood</p>
<p>of that rather than diminishes it. I don&rsquo;t know. So let me say just a couple of things. So one,</p>
<p>my belief at the time was it doesn&rsquo;t, it decreases it. Showing empathy while pushing back</p>
<p>decreases the likelihood of that. It might on the surface look like it&rsquo;s increasing it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s simply because the antisemitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface.</p>
<p>And then people talk about it. But I should also say that you&rsquo;re one of the only people that wrote</p>
<p>to me privately criticizing me. And like out of the people I really respect and admire. And that</p>
<p>was really valuable that I had to, painful, because I had to think through it for a while.</p>
<p>It still haunts me because the other kind of criticism I got a lot of, people basically said,</p>
<p>things towards me based on who I am that they hate me.</p>
<p>You mean antisemitic things or that you wrote?</p>
<p>Antisemitic things. I just hate the word antisemitic. It&rsquo;s like racist.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the reality. So I&rsquo;m someone, so I&rsquo;m Jewish, although obviously not religious.</p>
<p>I have never taken, I&rsquo;ve been a student of the Holocaust, obviously. I know a lot about that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s reason to be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience,</p>
<p>I have never taken antisemitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not made a</p>
<p>thing of it. I&rsquo;ve done exactly one podcast on it. I had Barry Weiss on my podcast when her book came</p>
<p>out. But it really is a thing. And it&rsquo;s something we have to keep an eye on societally because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a unique kind of hatred. It&rsquo;s unique in that it seems it&rsquo;s knit together with, it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>ordinary racism. It&rsquo;s knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem to die out.</p>
<p>And it can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically. I mean,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so perverse about antisemitism, look in the American context, with the far right,</p>
<p>with white supremacists, Jews aren&rsquo;t considered white. So they hate us in the same spirit in</p>
<p>which they hate black people or brown people or anyone who&rsquo;s not white. But on the left,</p>
<p>Jews are considered extra white. I mean, we&rsquo;re the extra beneficiaries of white privilege.</p>
<p>And in the black community, that is often the case. We&rsquo;re a minority that has thrived. And it</p>
<p>seems to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,</p>
<p>in particular African-Americans in the American context. And yeah, Asians are now getting a</p>
<p>little bit of this, like the model minority issue. But Jews have had this going on for</p>
<p>centuries and millennia, and it never seems to go away. And again, this is something that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never focused on, but this has been at a slow boil for as long as we&rsquo;ve been alive. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no guarantee it can&rsquo;t suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to</p>
<p>become, even in our society. And so there&rsquo;s kind of a special concern at moments like that where</p>
<p>you have an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history with</p>
<p>respect to their own beliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest. And he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>messaging, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who&rsquo;s given him the microphone at that</p>
<p>moment, to the world. And so that made my Spidey sense tingle.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated. The stakes are very high. And as somebody who&rsquo;s been, obviously, family and</p>
<p>also reading a lot about World War II, and just this whole period is a very difficult conversation.</p>
<p>But I believe in the power, especially given who I am, of not always, but sometimes,</p>
<p>often turning the other cheek. Oh, yeah. And again, things change</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re for public consumption. The cut for me that has just the use case I keep</p>
<p>stumbling upon is the kinds of things that I will say on a podcast like this, or if I&rsquo;m giving a</p>
<p>public lecture, versus the kinds of things I will say at dinner with strangers or with friends.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an elevator, if I&rsquo;m in an elevator with strangers, and I hear someone say something</p>
<p>stupid, I don&rsquo;t feel an intellectual responsibility to turn around in the confines of that space with</p>
<p>them and say, listen, that thing you just said about X, Y, or Z is completely false, and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why. But if somebody says it in front of me on some public dais where I&rsquo;m actually talking about</p>
<p>ideas, that&rsquo;s when there&rsquo;s a different responsibility that comes online.</p>
<p>The question is how you say it, how you say it.</p>
<p>Or even whether you say anything in those. I mean, there are moments, there are definitely</p>
<p>moments to privilege civility or just to pick your battles. I mean, sometimes it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>worth it to get into it with somebody out in real life.</p>
<p>I just believe in the power of empathy, both in the elevator and when a bunch of people are</p>
<p>listening, that when they see you willing to consider another human being&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>it just gives more power to your words after.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but until it doesn&rsquo;t. Because you can extend charity too far, right? It can be</p>
<p>absolutely obvious what someone&rsquo;s motives really are, and they&rsquo;re dissembling about that, right?</p>
<p>And so then you&rsquo;re taking at face value their representations, it begins to look like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just being duped and you&rsquo;re not actually doing the work of putting pressure on a bad actor.</p>
<p>And again, the mental illness component here makes it very difficult to think about</p>
<p>what you should or shouldn&rsquo;t have said to Kanye.</p>
<p>So I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. What&rsquo;s your view on</p>
<p>platforming controversial people? Let&rsquo;s start with the old, would you interview Hitler</p>
<p>on your podcast? And how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow-up question. Would you interview</p>
<p>him in 1935, 41, and then like 45? Well, I think we have an uncanny valley</p>
<p>problem with respect to this issue of whether or not to speak to bad people, right? So if a</p>
<p>person is sufficiently bad, right, if they&rsquo;re all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to</p>
<p>them and it&rsquo;s just totally unproblematic to talk to them. Because you don&rsquo;t have to spend any time</p>
<p>signaling to your audience that you don&rsquo;t agree with them. And if you&rsquo;re interviewing Hitler,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to say, listen, I just got to say before we start, I don&rsquo;t agree with the whole</p>
<p>genocide thing. And I just think you&rsquo;re killing mental patients in vans and all that. That was</p>
<p>all bad. It&rsquo;s a bad look, Adolf. So you just, it can go without saying that you don&rsquo;t agree with</p>
<p>this person and you&rsquo;re not platforming them to signal boost their views. You&rsquo;re just trying to,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re sufficiently evil, you can go into it very much as an anthropologist would.</p>
<p>You just want to understand the nature of evil, right? You just want to understand</p>
<p>this phenomenon, like how is this person who they are, right? And that strikes me as a</p>
<p>intellectually interesting and morally necessary thing to do, right? So yes,</p>
<p>I think you always interview Hitler. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Well, when you know, once he&rsquo;s Hitler. But when do you know it?</p>
<p>Once he&rsquo;s legitimately Hitler. But when do you know it?</p>
<p>Is genocide really happening? It&rsquo;s not 42, 43?</p>
<p>No, if you&rsquo;re on the cusp of it where it&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s gaining power and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to help facilitate that, then there&rsquo;s a question of whether you can undermine him while</p>
<p>pushing back against him in that interview, right? So there are people I wouldn&rsquo;t talk to just</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to give them oxygen. And I don&rsquo;t think that in the context of my interviewing</p>
<p>them, I&rsquo;m going to be able to take the wind out of their sails at all, right? So it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>for whatever, either because an asymmetric advantage, because I just know that they can</p>
<p>do something within the span of an hour that I can&rsquo;t correct for. It&rsquo;s like they can light many</p>
<p>small fires and it just takes too much time to put them out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more like on the topic of vaccines, for example,</p>
<p>having a debate on the efficacy of vaccines.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant. I think it is.</p>
<p>Even these asymmetries aside, I mean, it is true that a person can always make a mess faster than</p>
<p>you can clean it up, right? But still there are debates worth having, even given that limitation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the right people to have those specific debates. And there&rsquo;s certain topics where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll debate someone just because I&rsquo;m the right person for the job and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how</p>
<p>messy they&rsquo;re going to be. It&rsquo;s just worth it because I can make my points land at least to</p>
<p>the right part of the audience.</p>
<p>So some of it is just your own skill and competence and also interest in preparing correctly?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. And the nature of the subject matter. But there are other people who just by default,</p>
<p>I would say, well, there&rsquo;s no reason to give this guy a platform. And there are also people</p>
<p>who are so confabulatory that they&rsquo;re making such a mess with every sentence that insofar as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>even trying to interact with what they&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re by definition going to fail and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to seem to fail to a sufficiently large uninformed audience where it&rsquo;s going to be a net</p>
<p>negative for the cause of truth, no matter how good you are. So for instance, I think</p>
<p>talking to Alex Jones on any topic for any reason is probably a bad idea because I just think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just neurologically wired to just utter a string of sentences. He&rsquo;ll get 20 sentences out,</p>
<p>each of which contains more lies than the last. And there&rsquo;s not time enough in the world</p>
<p>to run down and certainly not time enough in the span of a conversation to run down each of those</p>
<p>leads to bedrock so as to falsify it. I mean, he&rsquo;ll just make shit up or make shit up and then</p>
<p>weave it in with half-truths and micro-truths that give some semblance of credibility to somebody</p>
<p>out there. I mean, apparently millions of people out there. And there&rsquo;s just no way to untangle</p>
<p>that in real time with him. I have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to</p>
<p>confabularitization.</p>
<p>Yeah, confabulation.</p>
<p>Confabulation. That if somebody says something a little micro-untruth, it really stops your brain.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m not talking about micro-untruths. I&rsquo;m just talking about making up things out</p>
<p>of whole cloth. If someone says something, well, what about, and then the thing they put</p>
<p>at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo-facts that you can&rsquo;t possibly authenticate</p>
<p>or not in the span of that conversation, whether it&rsquo;s about UFOs or anything else.</p>
<p>They will seem to make you look like an ignoramus when, in fact, everything they&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>specious, whether they know it or not. I mean, there&rsquo;s some people who are just</p>
<p>crazy. There&rsquo;s some people who are just bullshitting, and they&rsquo;re not even tracking</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s true. It just feels good. And there&rsquo;s some people who are consciously lying</p>
<p>about things.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s just a kind of jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able</p>
<p>to just wave off by saying like, well, none of that is backed up by any evidence, and just almost</p>
<p>like take it to the humor place.</p>
<p>Well, but the thing is, the place I&rsquo;m familiar with doing this and not doing this is</p>
<p>on specific conspiracies like 9-11 truth. Because of what 9-11 did to my intellectual</p>
<p>life, it sent me down a path for the better part of a decade. I became a critic of religion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was ever going to be a critic of religion, but it happened to be in my wheelhouse</p>
<p>because I spent so much time studying religion on my own. And I was also very interested in the</p>
<p>underlying spiritual concerns of every religion. And so I devoted more than a full decade of my</p>
<p>life to just what is real here? What is possible? What is the nature of subjective reality? And how</p>
<p>does it relate to reality at large? And is there anything to&hellip; Who was someone like Jesus or Buddha?</p>
<p>And are these people frauds? Or are these just myths? Or is there really a continuum of insight</p>
<p>to be had here that is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that question through the full</p>
<p>decade of my 20s.</p>
<p>And that was launched in part by 9-11 truth there?</p>
<p>No, but then when 9-11 happened, I had spent all this time reading religious books,</p>
<p>empathically understanding the motivations of religious people,</p>
<p>knowing just how fully certain people believe what they say they believe. So I took religious</p>
<p>convictions very seriously. And then people started flying planes into our buildings. So I knew that</p>
<p>there was something to be said about that.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>The core doctrines of Islam. Yeah, exactly. So that became my wheelhouse for a time,</p>
<p>terrorism and jihadism and related topics. And so the 9-11 truth conspiracy thing</p>
<p>kept getting aimed at me. And the question was, well, do I wanna debate these people?</p>
<p>Yeah. Alex Jones, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah. So Alex Jones, I think, was an early purveyor of it, although I don&rsquo;t think I knew</p>
<p>who he was at that point. And privately, I had some very long debates with people who&hellip; One</p>
<p>person in my family went way down that rabbit hole. And every six months or so, I&rsquo;d literally</p>
<p>write the two-hour email that would try to deprogram him, however ineffectually.</p>
<p>And so I went back and forth for years on that topic in private with people. But I could see</p>
<p>the structure of the conspiracy. I could see the nature of how impossible it was to play whack-a-mole</p>
<p>sufficiently well so as to convince anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic</p>
<p>structure of that way of thinking. I mean, it&rsquo;s not actually a thesis. It&rsquo;s a proliferation of</p>
<p>anomalies that you can&rsquo;t actually connect all the dots that are being pointed to. They don&rsquo;t connect</p>
<p>in a coherent way. They&rsquo;re incompatible theses, and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re running this algorithm of things are never what they seem. There&rsquo;s always malicious</p>
<p>conspirators doing things perfectly. We see evidence of human incompetence everywhere else.</p>
<p>No one can tie their shoes expertly anywhere else. But over here, people are perfectly</p>
<p>competent. They&rsquo;re perfectly concealing things. Thousands of people are collaborating</p>
<p>inexplicably. I mean, incentivized by what? Who knows? They&rsquo;re collaborating to murder</p>
<p>thousands of their neighbors, and no one is breathing a peep about it. No one&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>caught on camera. No one&rsquo;s breathed a word of it to a journalist. And so I&rsquo;ve dealt with</p>
<p>that style of thinking, and I know what it&rsquo;s like to be in the weeds of a conversation like that,</p>
<p>and the person will say, okay, well, but what do you make of the fact that all those F-16s</p>
<p>were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9-11 doing an exercise that hadn&rsquo;t even been</p>
<p>scheduled for that day, but it was&hellip; And now all of these are&hellip; I dimly recall some thesis of that</p>
<p>kind, but I&rsquo;m just making these things up now, right? So that detail hadn&rsquo;t even been scheduled</p>
<p>for that day. It was inexplicably run that day. So how long would it take to track that down,</p>
<p>the idea that this is anomalous? There was an F-16 exercise run, and it wasn&rsquo;t even supposed</p>
<p>to have been run that day. Someone like Alex Jones, their speech pattern is to pack as much</p>
<p>of that stuff in as possible at the highest velocity that the person can speak. And unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re knocking down each one of those things to that audience, you appear to just be uninformed.</p>
<p>You appear to just not be&hellip; Wait a minute, he didn&rsquo;t know about the F-16s?</p>
<p>Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know about Project Mockingbird? You haven&rsquo;t heard about Project Mockingbird? I just</p>
<p>made up Project Mockingbird. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that comes</p>
<p>tumbling out in a conversation like that. That&rsquo;s the kind of thing, frankly, I was worried about</p>
<p>in the COVID conversation, because not that someone like Brett would do it consciously,</p>
<p>but someone like Brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation, living on Twitter,</p>
<p>getting people sending the blog post and the study from the Philippines that showed that</p>
<p>in this cohort, ivermectin did X. To actually run anything to ground, you have to actually</p>
<p>do the work, journalistically and scientifically, and run it to ground. So for some of these</p>
<p>questions, you actually have to be a statistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics in</p>
<p>this experiment. Now, yes, we could take all the time to do that, or we could at every stage along</p>
<p>the way, in a context where we have experts we can trust, go with what 97% of the experts are</p>
<p>saying about X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to</p>
<p>wear masks or not wear masks. And I completely agree that that broke down unacceptably over the</p>
<p>last few years. But I think that&rsquo;s largely&hellip; Social media and blogs and the efforts of</p>
<p>podcasters and sub-stack writers were not just a response to that, I think it was a</p>
<p>symptom of that and a cause of that. And I think we&rsquo;re living in an environment where</p>
<p>people&hellip; We&rsquo;ve basically&hellip; We have trained ourselves not to be able to agree about facts</p>
<p>on any topic, no matter how urgent. What&rsquo;s flying in our sky? What&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine?</p>
<p>Is Putin just denazifying Ukraine? There are people who we respect</p>
<p>who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole. This is&hellip; Maybe there are a lot</p>
<p>of Nazis in Ukraine and that&rsquo;s the real problem. Maybe Putin&rsquo;s not the bad actor here.</p>
<p>How much time do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to the point of thinking, well,</p>
<p>maybe Putin&rsquo;s got a point and it&rsquo;s like, well, what about the polonium and the nerve agents and</p>
<p>the killing of journalists and Navalny? And does that count? Well, no. Listen, I&rsquo;m not paying so</p>
<p>much attention to that because I&rsquo;m following all these interesting people on Twitter and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving me some pro-Putin material here. And there are some Nazis in Ukraine. It&rsquo;s not like there are</p>
<p>no Nazis in Ukraine. How am I going to weight these things? I think people are being driven</p>
<p>crazy by Twitter. Yeah. But you&rsquo;re kind of speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute</p>
<p>everything. But every example you gave is kind of a bad faith style of conversation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not necessarily knowingly bad faith. I mean, the people who are worried about</p>
<p>Ukrainian Nazis, I mean, they&rsquo;re some of the same people. They&rsquo;re the same people who are</p>
<p>worried about ivermectin got suppressed. Ivermectin is really a panacea, but it got</p>
<p>suppressed because no one could make billions on it. It&rsquo;s literally, in many cases, the same people</p>
<p>and the same efforts to unearth those facts. You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s very difficult to have</p>
<p>conversations with those kinds of people. What about a conversation with Trump himself?</p>
<p>Would you do a podcast with Trump? No. I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be learning</p>
<p>anything about him. It&rsquo;s like with Hitler, and I&rsquo;m not comparing Trump to Hitler, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Clipse guy, here&rsquo;s your chance. You got this one.</p>
<p>With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like, okay, this is an opportunity</p>
<p>to learn something that I&rsquo;m not going to learn. I think Trump is among the most superficial people</p>
<p>we have ever laid eyes on. He is in public view. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some distance between who he is</p>
<p>in private and who he is in public, but it&rsquo;s not going to be the kind of distance that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to blow my mind. For instance, I think Joe Rogan was very wise not to have Trump on his</p>
<p>podcast. I think all he would have been doing is he would have put himself in a situation where he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t adequately contain the damage Trump was doing, and he was just going to make Trump seem</p>
<p>cool to a whole new, potentially new cohort of his massive audience. They would have had a lot</p>
<p>of laughs. Trump&rsquo;s funny. The entertainment value of things is so influential. There was</p>
<p>that one debate where Trump got a massive laugh on his line, only Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell.</p>
<p>The truth is we&rsquo;re living in a political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political</p>
<p>debate, you win. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are. That&rsquo;s the level of&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t matter how</p>
<p>uninformed you are. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that half the debate was about what the hell we should do</p>
<p>about a threat of nuclear war or anything else. We&rsquo;re monkeys, and we like to laugh.</p>
<p>Because you brought up Joe. He&rsquo;s somebody like you I look up to. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from him</p>
<p>because I think who he is privately as a human being. Also, he&rsquo;s kind of the voice of curiosity</p>
<p>to me. He inspired me. That&rsquo;s an unending open-minded curiosity, much like you are the</p>
<p>voice of reason. They recently had a podcast. Joe had recently had a podcast with Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>and he brought you up saying they still have a hope for you. Any chance you talk to Joe again and</p>
<p>reinvigorate your friendship? I reached out to him privately when I saw that.</p>
<p>Did you use the power of love? Joe knows I love him and consider him a friend,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no issue there. He also knows I&rsquo;ll be happy to do his podcast</p>
<p>when we get that together. I&rsquo;ve got no policy of not talking to Joe or not doing his podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we got a little sideways along these same lines where we&rsquo;ve talked about Brett</p>
<p>and Elon and other people. It was never to that degree with Joe because</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s in a very different lane, and consciously so. I mean, Joe is a stand-up comic who interviews,</p>
<p>is interested in everything, interviews the widest conceivable variety of people,</p>
<p>and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or lack of expertise. I mean,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s a super wide variety of people. He&rsquo;ll talk about anything, and he can always</p>
<p>pull the ripcord saying, I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;m a comic. I&rsquo;m stoned.</p>
<p>We just drank too much, right? It&rsquo;s very entertaining. To my eye, it&rsquo;s all in good</p>
<p>faith. I think Joe is an extraordinarily ethical, good person. Also doesn&rsquo;t use Twitter.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really use Twitter. Yeah, yeah. The crucial difference, though,</p>
<p>is that because he is an entertainer first, I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s not smart and doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand things. I mean, what&rsquo;s potentially confusing is he&rsquo;s very smart, and he&rsquo;s also very</p>
<p>informed. His full-time job is taught. When he&rsquo;s not doing stand-up or doing color commentary for</p>
<p>the UFC, his full-time job is talking to lots of very smart people at great length. He&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>the Joe Rogan University for himself, and he&rsquo;s gotten a lot of information crammed into his head.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s uninformed, but he can always, when he feels that he&rsquo;s uninformed or</p>
<p>when it turns out he was wrong about something, he can always pull the ripcord and say, I&rsquo;m just a</p>
<p>comic. We were stoned. It was fun. Don&rsquo;t take medical advice from me. I don&rsquo;t play a doctor</p>
<p>on the internet, right? I can&rsquo;t quite do that, right? You can&rsquo;t quite do that. We&rsquo;re in different</p>
<p>lanes. I&rsquo;m not saying you and I are in exactly the same lane, but for much of Joe&rsquo;s audience,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just this establishment shill who&rsquo;s just banging on about the universities and medical</p>
<p>journals. And it&rsquo;s not true, but that would be the perception. And as a counterpoint to a lot</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s being said on Joe&rsquo;s podcast, or certainly Brett&rsquo;s podcast on these topics,</p>
<p>I can see how they would form that opinion. But in reality, if you listen to me long enough,</p>
<p>you hear that I&rsquo;ve said as much against the woke nonsense as anyone, even any lunatic on the right</p>
<p>who can only keep that bright shining object in view, right? So there&rsquo;s nothing that Candace</p>
<p>Owens has said about wokeness that I haven&rsquo;t said about wokeness insofar as she&rsquo;s speaking</p>
<p>rationally about wokeness. But we have to be able to keep multiple things in view, right?</p>
<p>If you could only look at the problem of wokeness and you couldn&rsquo;t acknowledge the problem of Trump</p>
<p>and Trumpism and QAnon and the explosion of irrationality that was happening on the right</p>
<p>and bigotry that was happening on the right, you were just disregarding half of the landscape.</p>
<p>And many people took half of the problem in recent years. The last five years is a story</p>
<p>of many people taking half of the problem and monetizing that half of the problem and getting</p>
<p>captured by an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about in that way.</p>
<p>And this is the larger issue of audience capture, which I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s an ancient problem, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy of our mutual friend, Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>And audience captures a thing, and I believe I&rsquo;ve witnessed many casualties of it. And if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;ve been on guard against in my life professionally, it&rsquo;s been that. And when</p>
<p>I noticed that I had a lot of people in my audience who didn&rsquo;t like my criticizing Trump,</p>
<p>I really leaned into it. And when I noticed that a lot of the other cohort in my audience</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like me criticizing the far left and wokeness, they thought I was exaggerating that</p>
<p>problem, I leaned into it because I thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t care about whether I was going to lose those parts of my audience.</p>
<p>There are people who have created, knowingly or not, there are people who&rsquo;ve created different</p>
<p>incentives for themselves because of how they&rsquo;ve monetized their podcasts and because of the kind</p>
<p>of signal they&rsquo;ve responded to in their audience. And I worry about&hellip; Brett would consider this a</p>
<p>totally invidious ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that that&rsquo;s happened to Brett.</p>
<p>I think I cannot explain how you do 100&hellip; With all the things in the universe to be interested</p>
<p>in, and of all the things he&rsquo;s competent to speak intelligently about, I don&rsquo;t know how you do 100</p>
<p>podcasts in a row on COVID, right? It&rsquo;s just, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>You think, in part, audience capture can explain that?</p>
<p>I absolutely think it can, yeah.</p>
<p>What about, do you, for example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake</p>
<p>on COVID or made a mistake on Trump? I&rsquo;m not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this</p>
<p>pressure? So you&rsquo;ve attacked audience capture within the way you do stuff, so you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>as much pressure from the audience, but within your own ego?</p>
<p>I mean, again, the people who think I&rsquo;m wrong about any of these topics are gonna think,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re just not admitting that you&rsquo;re wrong. But now we&rsquo;re having a dispute about specific</p>
<p>facts. There are things that I believed about COVID or worried might be true about COVID two</p>
<p>years ago that I no longer believe or I&rsquo;m not so worried about now, and vice versa. I mean,</p>
<p>things have flipped. Certain things have flipped upside down. The question is, was I wrong?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the cartoon version of it, but this is something I said probably 18 months ago,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still true. When I saw what Brett was doing on COVID, let&rsquo;s call it two years ago,</p>
<p>I said, even if he&rsquo;s right, even if it turns out that ivermectin is a panacea and the mRNA vaccines</p>
<p>kill millions of people, he&rsquo;s still wrong right now. His reasoning is still flawed right now.</p>
<p>His facts still suck right now, and his confidence is unjustified now. That was true then,</p>
<p>that was true then, that will always be true then. And not much has changed for me to revisit</p>
<p>any of my time points along the way. Again, I will totally concede that if I had teenage boys</p>
<p>and their schools were demanding that they be vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine,</p>
<p>I would be powerfully annoyed. I wouldn&rsquo;t know what I was going to do, and I would be doing more</p>
<p>research about myocarditis, and I&rsquo;d be badgering our doctors, and I would be worried that we have</p>
<p>a medical system and a pharmaceutical system and a healthcare system and a public health system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not incentivized to look at any of this in a fine-grained way, and they just want one</p>
<p>blanket admonition to the entire population, just take the shot, you idiots.</p>
<p>I view that largely as a result, a panicked response to the misinformation explosion that</p>
<p>happened and the populist resistance animated by misinformation that just made it impossible to get</p>
<p>anyone to cooperate. Part of it is, again, a pendulum swing in the wrong direction,</p>
<p>somewhat analogous to the woke response to Trump and the Trumpist response to woke. A lot of people</p>
<p>have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons, but understandable reasons. But yes, there are</p>
<p>caveats. Things have changed about my view of COVID, but the question is, if you roll back the</p>
<p>clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform Eric Topol, a very well-respected cardiologist on</p>
<p>this topic, or Nicholas Christakis to talk about the network effects of whether we should close</p>
<p>schools, right? He&rsquo;s written a book on COVID, his network effects are his wheelhouse, both as an MD</p>
<p>and as a sociologist. There was a lot that we believed we knew about the efficacy of closing</p>
<p>schools during pandemics, during the Spanish flu pandemic and others, but there&rsquo;s a lot we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know about COVID. We didn&rsquo;t know how negligible the effects would be on kids compared</p>
<p>to older people. We didn&rsquo;t know. My problem, I really enjoyed your conversation with Eric Topol,</p>
<p>but also didn&rsquo;t. So he&rsquo;s one of the great communicators in many ways on Twitter,</p>
<p>like distillation of the current data, but he, I hope I&rsquo;m not overstating it, but there is a bit</p>
<p>of an arrogance from him that I think could be explained by him being exhausted by being</p>
<p>constantly attacked by conspiracy theory, like anti-vaxxers. To me, the same thing happens with</p>
<p>people that start drifting to being right-wing, is they get attacked so much by the left,</p>
<p>they become almost irrational and arrogant in their beliefs. And I felt your conversation</p>
<p>with Eric Topol did not sufficiently empathize with people that have skepticism, but also did</p>
<p>not sufficiently communicate uncertainty we have. So many of the decisions you made, many of the</p>
<p>things you were talking about, were kind of saying there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty, but this is the best</p>
<p>thing we could do now. Well, it was a forced choice. You&rsquo;re going to get COVID. Do you want to be</p>
<p>vaccinated when you get it? Right. That was always, in my view, an easy choice. And it&rsquo;s up until you</p>
<p>start breaking apart the cohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute, there is this myocarditis</p>
<p>issue in young men. Let&rsquo;s talk about that. Before that story emerged, it was just clear that</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped,</p>
<p>it is still mitigating severe illness and death. And I still believe that it is the</p>
<p>current view of most people competent to analyze the data that we lost something like 300,000</p>
<p>people unnecessarily in the U.S. because of vaccine hesitancy. But I think there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to communicate with humility about the uncertainty of things that would increase the vaccination rate.</p>
<p>I do believe that it is rational and sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain</p>
<p>bad ideas and certain conspiracy theories and certain forms of misinformation.</p>
<p>I think so. I just think it makes you look a douchebag most times.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, certain people are persuadable, certain people are not persuadable, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s&hellip; No, because there&rsquo;s not enough&hellip; It&rsquo;s the opportunity cost. Not everything can be</p>
<p>given a patient hearing. So you can&rsquo;t have a physics conference and then let people in to</p>
<p>just trumpet their pet theories about the grand unified vision of physics when they&rsquo;re obviously</p>
<p>crazy or they&rsquo;re obviously half crazy or they&rsquo;re just not&hellip; You begin to get a sense for this</p>
<p>when it is your wheelhouse. But there are people who declare their irrelevance to the conversation</p>
<p>fairly quickly without knowing that they have done it. And the truth is, I think I&rsquo;m one of</p>
<p>those people on the topic of COVID. It&rsquo;s never that I felt, listen, I know exactly what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on here. I know these mRNA vaccines are safe. I know exactly how to run a lockdown.</p>
<p>No, this is a situation where you want the actual pilots to fly the plane, right? We needed experts</p>
<p>who we could trust. And insofar as our experts got captured by all manner of thing, I mean,</p>
<p>some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous just standing next</p>
<p>to Trump while he was bloviating about whatever, that it&rsquo;s just going to go away. There&rsquo;s just 15</p>
<p>people. There&rsquo;s 15 people in a cruise ship and it&rsquo;s just going to go away. There&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>no problem. Or it&rsquo;s like when he said, many of these doctors think I understand this better</p>
<p>than them. They&rsquo;re just amazed at how I understand this. And you&rsquo;ve got doctors, real doctors,</p>
<p>the heads of the CDC and NIH standing around just ashen faced while he&rsquo;s talking.</p>
<p>All of this was deeply corrupting of the public communication of science. And then again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve banged on about the depredations of wokeness. The woke thing was a disaster,</p>
<p>right? It still is a disaster. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that&hellip; But the thing is, there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>difference between me and Brett in this case. I didn&rsquo;t do a hundred podcasts on COVID. I did</p>
<p>two podcasts on COVID. The measure of my concern about COVID can be measured in how many podcasts</p>
<p>I did on it, right? It&rsquo;s like, once we had a sense of how to live with COVID,</p>
<p>I was just living with COVID, right? Like, okay, get vaxxed or don&rsquo;t get vaxxed. Wear a mask or</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wear a mask. Travel or don&rsquo;t travel. You&rsquo;ve got a few things to decide, but my kids were stuck</p>
<p>at home on iPads for too long. I didn&rsquo;t agree with that. It was obviously not functional.</p>
<p>Like, I criticized that on the margins, but there was not much to do about it. But the thing I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do is make this my life and just browbeat people with one message or another. We need a</p>
<p>public health regime where we can trust what competent people are saying to us about what</p>
<p>medicines are safe to take. And in the absence of that, craziness is going to&hellip; Even in the presence</p>
<p>of that, craziness is going to proliferate given the tools we&rsquo;ve built. But in the absence of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to proliferate for understandable reasons. And that&rsquo;s going to&hellip; It&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be good next time when something orders of magnitude more dangerous hits us. And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I spent, you know&hellip; And so far as I think about this issue, I think much more about next time than</p>
<p>this time. Before this COVID thing, you and Brad had some good conversations. I would say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>friends. What do you admire most about Brett outside of all the criticism we&rsquo;ve had about this</p>
<p>COVID topic? Well, I think Brett is very smart, and he&rsquo;s a very ethical person who wants good</p>
<p>things for the world. I mean, I have no reason to doubt that. So the fact that we&rsquo;re crosswise on</p>
<p>this issue does not mean that I think he&rsquo;s a bad person. I mean, the thing that worried me about</p>
<p>what he was doing, and this was true of Joe, and this was true of Elon, and this was true of many</p>
<p>other people, is that once you&rsquo;re messaging at scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain</p>
<p>kind of responsibility not to get people killed. And I did worry that, yeah, people were making</p>
<p>decisions on the basis of the information that was getting shared there. And that&rsquo;s why I was,</p>
<p>I think, fairly circumspect. I just said, okay, give me the center of the fairway expert opinion</p>
<p>at this time point, and at this time point, and at this time point, and then I&rsquo;m out. Right? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any more to say about this. I&rsquo;m not an expert on COVID. I&rsquo;m not an expert on the safety of MRNA</p>
<p>vaccines. If something changes so as to become newsworthy, then maybe I&rsquo;ll do a podcast. I just</p>
<p>did a podcast on the lab leak. Right? I was never skeptical of the lab leak hypothesis.</p>
<p>Brett was very early on saying, this is a lab leak. Right? At a point where my only position was,</p>
<p>who cares if it&rsquo;s a lab leak? Right? The thing we have to get straight is, what do we do given</p>
<p>the nature of this pandemic? But also we should say that you&rsquo;ve actually stated that it is a</p>
<p>possibility. You just said it doesn&rsquo;t quite matter. I mean, the time to figure that out.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve actually, I have had my podcast guest on this topic changed my view of this, because</p>
<p>one of the guests, Elena Chan, made the point that, no, actually the best time to figure out</p>
<p>the origin of this is immediately. Right? Because you lose touch with the evidence. And I hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really been thinking about that. If you come back after a year, there are certain facts you</p>
<p>might not be able to get in hand. But I&rsquo;ve always felt that it didn&rsquo;t matter for two reasons. One is</p>
<p>we had the genome of the virus and we could design, we&rsquo;re very quickly design, immediately</p>
<p>designing vaccines against that genome. And that&rsquo;s what we had to do. And then we had to figure out</p>
<p>how to vaccinate and to mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that. So the origin story</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter. Generically speaking, either origin story was politically inflammatory</p>
<p>and made the Chinese look bad, right? And the Chinese response to this looked bad,</p>
<p>whatever the origin story, right? They&rsquo;re not cooperating. They&rsquo;re stopping their domestic</p>
<p>flights, but letting their international flights go. I mean, it&rsquo;s just, they were bad actors and</p>
<p>they should be treated as such regardless of the origin, right? And I would argue that the wet</p>
<p>market origin is even more politically invidious than the lab leak origin. I mean-</p>
<p>Why do you think?</p>
<p>Because lab leak, to my eye, the lab leak could happen to anyone, right? We&rsquo;re all running,</p>
<p>all these advanced countries are running these dangerous labs. That&rsquo;s a practice that we should</p>
<p>be worried about in general. We know lab leaks are a problem. There&rsquo;ve been multiple lab leaks of</p>
<p>even worse things that haven&rsquo;t gotten out of hand in this way, but worse pathogens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wise to be worried about this. And on some level, it could happen to anyone, right?</p>
<p>The wet market makes them look like barbarians living in another century. You got to clean up</p>
<p>those wet markets. Like, what are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin on top of a</p>
<p>duck? It&rsquo;s like, get your shit together. So like, if anything, the wet market makes them look worse</p>
<p>in my view. Now, I&rsquo;m sure that what they actually did to conceal a lab leak, if it was a lab leak,</p>
<p>all of that&rsquo;s going to look odious.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever get to the bottom of that? I mean, one of the big negative,</p>
<p>I would say, failures of Anthony Fauci and so on is to be transparent and clear and just a good</p>
<p>communicator about gain-and-function research, the dangers of that, why it&rsquo;s a useful way of</p>
<p>research, but it&rsquo;s also dangerous. Just being transparent about that, as opposed to just coming</p>
<p>off really shady. Of course, the conspiracy theorists and the politicians are not helping,</p>
<p>politicians are not helping, but this just created a giant mess.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I would agree. So that exchange with Fauci and Rand Paul that went viral,</p>
<p>I would agree that Fauci looked like he was taking refuge in kind of very lawyered language</p>
<p>and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it. So yeah,</p>
<p>I think it looked shady, it played shady, and it probably was shady. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>personally entangled he is with any of this, but yeah, the gain-of-function research is something</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re wise to be worried about. And insofar as I judge myself adequate to have an</p>
<p>opinion on this, I think it should be banned, right? Like probably a podcast I&rsquo;ll do if you</p>
<p>or somebody else doesn&rsquo;t do it in the meantime. I would like a virologist to defend it against a</p>
<p>virologist who would criticize it. Forget about just the gain-of-function research.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand virus hunting at this point. It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t even know why you need</p>
<p>to go into a cave to find this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump</p>
<p>zoonotically at us. Why do that when we can sequence in a day and make vaccines in a weekend?</p>
<p>I mean, what kind of head start do you think you&rsquo;re getting? That&rsquo;s a surprising new thing,</p>
<p>how quickly you can develop a vaccine. Exactly. Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting. But the shadiness</p>
<p>around LabLeak. I think the point I didn&rsquo;t make about Brett&rsquo;s style of engaging in this issue is</p>
<p>people are using the fact that he was early on LabLeak to suggest that he was right about</p>
<p>ivermectin and about mRNA vaccines and all the rest. No, none of that connects.</p>
<p>And it was possible to be falsely confident. You shouldn&rsquo;t have been confident about LabLeak.</p>
<p>No one should have been confident about LabLeak early, even if it turns out to be LabLeak, right?</p>
<p>It was always plausible. It was never definite. It still isn&rsquo;t definite. Zoonotic is also quite</p>
<p>plausible. It certainly was super plausible then. Both are politically uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Both at the time were inflammatory to be banging on about when we were trying to secure some kind</p>
<p>of cooperation from the Chinese, right? So there&rsquo;s a time for these things. And it&rsquo;s possible to be</p>
<p>right by accident, right? Your reasoning, the style of reasoning matters whether you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>or not. It&rsquo;s like because your style of reasoning is dictating what you&rsquo;re going to do on the next</p>
<p>topic. Sure. But this multivariate situation here, it&rsquo;s really difficult to know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right on COVID, given all the uncertainty, all the chaos, especially when you step outside the</p>
<p>pure biology, virology of it, and you start to get into policy. It&rsquo;s really-</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just trade-offs, yeah.</p>
<p>Like transmissibility of the virus. Just knowing if 65% of the population gets vaccinated,</p>
<p>what effect would that have? Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those things.</p>
<p>Given all the other incentives, I mean, Pfizer, I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>But you had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that conversation feeling like</p>
<p>this is a person who is consciously</p>
<p>reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk? Or do</p>
<p>you think this person was making a good faith attempt to save lives and had no</p>
<p>taint of bad incentives or something?</p>
<p>The thing I sensed, and I felt in part it was a failure on my part,</p>
<p>but I sensed that I was talking to a politician. So it&rsquo;s not thinking of there was malevolence</p>
<p>there or benevolence. There was a-</p>
<p>He just had a job to do.</p>
<p>He put on a suit, and I was talking to a suit, not a human being. Now,</p>
<p>he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast, which is why he wanted to do it.</p>
<p>So I thought I would be talking to a human being. And I asked challenging questions,</p>
<p>what I thought the internet thinks otherwise. Every single question in that interview</p>
<p>was a challenging one, but it wasn&rsquo;t grilling, which is what people seem to want to</p>
<p>do with pharmaceutical companies. There&rsquo;s a deep distrust of pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the alternative? I mean, I totally get that windfall profits at a time of public</p>
<p>health emergency looks bad. It is a bad look, right? But how do we reward and return capital</p>
<p>to risk takers who will spend a billion dollars to design a new drug for a disease</p>
<p>that maybe only harms a single digit percentage of the population? It&rsquo;s like, well, what do we</p>
<p>want to encourage? And who do we want to get rich? I mean, so the person who cures cancer,</p>
<p>do we want that person to get rich or not? We want the person who gave us the iPhone to get</p>
<p>rich, but we don&rsquo;t want the person who cures cancer to get rich. I mean, what are we trying</p>
<p>to do? I think it&rsquo;s a very gray area. So what we want is the person who declares that they have a</p>
<p>cure for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. I think we&rsquo;re good now as a</p>
<p>population smelling bullshit. And there is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example,</p>
<p>just CEOs of pharmaceutical companies in general, just because they&rsquo;re so lawyered up,</p>
<p>so much marketing and PR people, that they are, you just smell bullshit. You&rsquo;re not talking to</p>
<p>a real human. It just feels like none of it is transparent to us as a public. So this whole</p>
<p>talking point that Pfizer&rsquo;s only interested in helping people just doesn&rsquo;t ring true,</p>
<p>even though it very well could be true. It&rsquo;s the same thing with Bill Gates,</p>
<p>who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in the world. And yet there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the way he delivers that message where people like, this seems suspicious. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening underneath this? There&rsquo;s certain kinds of communication styles that seem to be more,</p>
<p>serve as better catalysts for conspiracy theories. And I&rsquo;m not sure what that is,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an alternative for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people.</p>
<p>But also at the same time, there seems to need to be more transparency. And plus regulation,</p>
<p>that actually makes sense, versus it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible</p>
<p>to corruption. Yeah, I worry about all that. But I also do think that most of the people</p>
<p>going into those fields and most of the people going into government-</p>
<p>Yeah, they want to do good.</p>
<p>Doing it for good. And they&rsquo;re non-psychopaths trying to get good things done and trying to</p>
<p>solve hard problems. And they&rsquo;re not trying to get rich. I mean, many of the people are&hellip;</p>
<p>Bad incentives are something&hellip; Again, I&rsquo;ve uttered that phrase 30 times on this podcast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just almost everywhere it explains normal people creating terrible harm. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that there are that many bad people. And yes, it makes the truly bad people that much more</p>
<p>remarkable and worth paying attention to. But the bad incentives and the power of bad ideas</p>
<p>do much more harm. Because I mean, that&rsquo;s what gets good people running in the wrong direction,</p>
<p>or doing things that are clearly creating unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had, and I hope still have, a friendship with Elon Musk,</p>
<p>especially over the topic of AI. You have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share,</p>
<p>concerns you both share. Well, let me first ask, what do you admire most about Elon?</p>
<p>Well, I had a lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon, I knew as a friend, I like</p>
<p>a lot. And it&rsquo;s not going to surprise anyone. I mean, he&rsquo;s done and he&rsquo;s continuing to do</p>
<p>amazing things. And I think many of his aspirations are realized, the world will be a</p>
<p>much better place. I think it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s amazing to see what he&rsquo;s built and what he&rsquo;s attempted to</p>
<p>build and what he may yet build. So with Tesla, with SpaceX, with-</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m a fan of almost all of that. I mean, there are wrinkles to a lot of that,</p>
<p>or some of that. All humans are full of wrinkles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very Trumpian about how he&rsquo;s acting on Twitter. I mean, Twitter, I think</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s, he thinks Twitter&rsquo;s great. He bought the place because he thinks it&rsquo;s so great. I think</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s driving him crazy, right? I think he&rsquo;s needlessly complicating his life and harming his</p>
<p>reputation and creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of other people. I mean, so like he,</p>
<p>the thing that I objected to with him on Twitter is not that he bought it and made changes to it.</p>
<p>I mean, that was not, again, I remain agnostic as to whether or not he can improve the platform.</p>
<p>It was how he was personally behaving on Twitter, not just toward me, but toward the world.</p>
<p>I think when you forward an article about Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s husband being attacked,</p>
<p>not as he was by some lunatic, but that it&rsquo;s just some gay trist gone awry, right? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what it seems. You link to a website that previously claimed that Hillary Clinton was dead</p>
<p>and that a body double was campaigning in her place. That thing was exploding in Trumpistan</p>
<p>as a conspiracy theory, right? It was having its effect. It matters that he was signal boosting it</p>
<p>in front of 130 million people. It is with saying that your former employee, Yoel Roth, is a</p>
<p>pedophile, right? I mean, it&rsquo;s like that has real consequences. It appeared to be complete bullshit.</p>
<p>And now this guy&rsquo;s getting inundated with death threats, right? And Elon, all of that&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>predictable, right? And so he&rsquo;s behaving quite recklessly. And there&rsquo;s a long list of things</p>
<p>like that that he&rsquo;s done on Twitter. It&rsquo;s not ethical. It&rsquo;s not good for him. It&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>for the world. It&rsquo;s not serious. It&rsquo;s a very adolescent relationship to real problems</p>
<p>in our society. And so my problem with how he&rsquo;s behaved is that he&rsquo;s purported to touch</p>
<p>real issues by turns. Like, okay, do I give the satellites to Ukraine or not? Do I minimize</p>
<p>their use of them or not? Should I publicly worry about World War III or not, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing this shit on Twitter, right? And at the same moment, he&rsquo;s doing these other very</p>
<p>impulsive, ill-considered things, and he&rsquo;s not showing any willingness to really clean up the</p>
<p>mess he makes. He brings Kanye on, knowing he&rsquo;s an anti-Semite who&rsquo;s got mental health problems,</p>
<p>and then kicks him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have kicked him off for a swastika.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even‚Äîcan you really kick people off for swastikas? Is that something that you get banned</p>
<p>for‚ÄîI mean, are you a free speech absolutist if you can&rsquo;t let a swastika show up? I&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>sure that&rsquo;s an enforceable terms of service, right? There are moments to use swastikas that</p>
<p>are not conveying hate and not raising the risk of violence.</p>
<p>Clip that.</p>
<p>Yeah. But so much of what he&rsquo;s doing, given that he&rsquo;s‚Äîagain, scale matters. He&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>this in front of 130 million people. That&rsquo;s very different than a million people, and that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>different than 100,000 people. And so when I went off the tracks with Elon, he was doing this about</p>
<p>COVID, and again, this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend&rsquo;s behavior,</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t work out very well.</p>
<p>Did you try to correct him, sort of highlighting things he might be wrong on?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or did you use the Lex Powell love method? I should write a pamphlet for Sam Harris to follow.</p>
<p>Well, no, but it was totally coming from a place of love because I was concerned about his</p>
<p>reputation. I was concerned about what he‚ÄîI mean, there was a twofold concern. I could see what was</p>
<p>happening with the tweet. I mean, he&rsquo;d had this original tweet that was, I think it was,</p>
<p>panic over COVID is dumb, or something like that, right? This is in March. This is early March 2020.</p>
<p>Oh, super early days of COVID.</p>
<p>Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we knew we saw what was happening in Italy,</p>
<p>right? It was totally kicking off.</p>
<p>God, that was a wild time. That&rsquo;s when the toilet paper‚Äî</p>
<p>It was totally wild, but that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week. I</p>
<p>mean, it had more engagement than any other tweet, more than any crazy thing Trump was tweeting. I</p>
<p>mean, it went off, again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. And I could see that people</p>
<p>were responding to it like, wait a minute, okay, here&rsquo;s this genius technologist who must have</p>
<p>inside information about everything, right? Surely he knows something that is not on the surface</p>
<p>about this pandemic. And they were reading into it a lot of information that I knew wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>right? And at the time, I didn&rsquo;t think he had any reason to be suggesting that. I think he was</p>
<p>just firing off a tweet, right? So I reached out to him in private, and I mean, because it was a</p>
<p>private text conversation, I won&rsquo;t talk about the details, but I&rsquo;m just saying, that&rsquo;s a case,</p>
<p>you know, among the many cases of friends who have public platforms and who did something that I</p>
<p>thought was dangerous and ill-considered, this was a case where I reached out in private</p>
<p>and tried to help, genuinely help, because it was just, I thought it was harmful in every sense,</p>
<p>because it was being misinterpreted. And it was like, okay, you can say that panic over anything</p>
<p>is dumb, fine, but this was not how this was landing. This was like, non-issue conspiracy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be no COVID in the US, it&rsquo;s gonna peter out, it&rsquo;s just gonna become a cold. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how this was getting received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely obvious how</p>
<p>big a deal this was gonna be, or that it was gonna, at minimum, going to be a big deal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was obvious, but it was obvious there was a significant probability</p>
<p>that it could be a big deal. I remember in March, it wasn&rsquo;t unclear, like, how big,</p>
<p>because there were still stories of it, like, it&rsquo;s probably going to, like, the big concern,</p>
<p>the hospitals might overfill, but it&rsquo;s gonna die out in, like, two months or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but there was no way we weren&rsquo;t going to have tens of thousands of deaths</p>
<p>at a minimum at that point. And it was totally rational to be worried about hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands. And when Nicholas Christakis came on my podcast very early, he predicted quite</p>
<p>confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the US, right? And that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem, you know, it was, I think, appropriately hedged, but, I mean, it was still, it was just,</p>
<p>like, okay, it&rsquo;s just gonna, you just look at the, we&rsquo;re just kind of riding this exponential,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re, and it&rsquo;s gonna be, you know, it&rsquo;d be very surprising not to have that order of</p>
<p>magnitude and not something much less. And so anyway, I mean, again, to close the story on Elon,</p>
<p>I could see how this was being received, and I tried to get him to walk that back. And then we</p>
<p>we had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue. And that, so that intervention didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. And it was not done, you know, I was not an asshole. I was not, I was just concerned,</p>
<p>concerned, you know, for him, for the world, for, and, you know.</p>
<p>And then there are other relationships where I didn&rsquo;t take the, again, that&rsquo;s an example where</p>
<p>taking the time didn&rsquo;t work, right, privately. There are other relationships where I thought,</p>
<p>okay, this is just gonna be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth, and I just ignored it, you know. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of that. And I, again, I&rsquo;m not comfortable with how this is all netted out,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if, you know, and I&rsquo;m not, you know, frankly, I&rsquo;m not comfortable with how</p>
<p>much time in this conversation we&rsquo;ve spent talking about these specific people. Like,</p>
<p>what good is it for me to talk about Elon or Brett or any of these people in public?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of good, because those friendships, listen, as a fan,</p>
<p>these are the conversations I loved, love as a fan, and it feels like COVID has robbed the</p>
<p>world of these conversations, because you are exchanging back and forth on Twitter,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what I mean by conversations, like long-form discussions, like a debate about COVID,</p>
<p>like a normal debate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no, there is no, Elon and I shouldn&rsquo;t be debating COVID.</p>
<p>You should be. Here&rsquo;s the thing, with humility, like basically saying, we don&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>like the Rogan method, we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re just a bunch of idiots, like one is an engineer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a neuroscientist, but like, it just kind of, okay, here&rsquo;s the evidence, and be like normal</p>
<p>people. That&rsquo;s what everybody was doing. The whole world was like trying to figure out what the hell,</p>
<p>what&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but the issue was that at that, so at the moment I had this collision with Elon,</p>
<p>certain things were not debatable, right? It was just, it was absolutely clear where this was</p>
<p>going. It wasn&rsquo;t clear how far it was going to go or how quickly we would mitigate it, but</p>
<p>it was absolutely clear that it was going to be an issue, right? The train had come off the tracks</p>
<p>in Italy. We knew we weren&rsquo;t going to seal our borders. There were already people, you know,</p>
<p>who, there are already cases known to many of us personally in the U.S. at that point.</p>
<p>And he was operating by a very different logic that I couldn&rsquo;t engage with.</p>
<p>Sure, but that logic represents a part of the population, and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>interesting topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks,</p>
<p>like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, but where things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about,</p>
<p>a lot to debate, this is all very interesting, and who knows what&rsquo;s what. It broke down very early</p>
<p>at, this is, you know, there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about here. Like, either there&rsquo;s a water bottle</p>
<p>on the table or there isn&rsquo;t, right? Like, it&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, technically, there&rsquo;s only one-fourth of a water bottle.</p>
<p>So what defines a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle,</p>
<p>or is it the water bottle? What I&rsquo;m giving you is an example of it&rsquo;s worth a conversation.</p>
<p>This is difficult because this is, we had an exchange in private, and I want to&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure, sure, sure.</p>
<p>I want to honor not exposing the details of it, but, you know, the details convinced me</p>
<p>that there was not a follow-up conversation on that topic.</p>
<p>On this topic. That said, I hope, and I hope to be part of helping that happen,</p>
<p>that the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics I care a lot about,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, you&rsquo;ve had great public and private conversations about this topic.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. I mean, he and I went to</p>
<p>that initial conference in Puerto Rico together, and it was only because he was going and I found</p>
<p>out about it through him, and I just wrote his coattails to it, you know, that I got</p>
<p>dropped in that side of the pool to hear about these concerns at that point.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to hear how has your concern evolved with the coming out of Chad GPT</p>
<p>and these new large language models that are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and</p>
<p>seemingly to be able to do some incredible human-like things. There&rsquo;s two questions. One,</p>
<p>how has your concern in terms of AGI and superintelligence evolved, and how impressed</p>
<p>are you with Chad GPT as a student of the human mind and mind in general?</p>
<p>Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. I&rsquo;ve spoken about it a bunch on my podcast, but I did</p>
<p>a TED Talk in 2016, which was the kind of summary of what that conference and various conversations</p>
<p>I had after that did to my brain on this topic. Basically, that once superintelligence is</p>
<p>achieved, there&rsquo;s a takeoff. It becomes exponentially smarter, and in a matter of</p>
<p>time, we&rsquo;re ants and they&rsquo;re gods. Well, yeah, unless we find some way of</p>
<p>permanently tethering a superintelligent, self-improving AI to our value system,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t believe anyone has figured out how to do that or whether that&rsquo;s even possible in</p>
<p>principle. I mean, I know people like Stuart Russell, who I just had on my podcast, are&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, really? Have you released it yet?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t released it yet, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on a previous podcast, but we just recorded this week.</p>
<p>Because you haven&rsquo;t done an AI podcast in a while, so it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. He&rsquo;s a good person to talk about alignment with.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Stuart has been probably more than anyone my guru on this topic. I mean,</p>
<p>just reading his book and doing, I think I&rsquo;ve done two podcasts with him at this point.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called The Control Problem or something like that.</p>
<p>His book is human compatible.</p>
<p>Human compatible.</p>
<p>He talks about the control problem. And yeah, so I just think the idea that we can</p>
<p>define a value function in advance that permanently tethers a self-improving,</p>
<p>superintelligent AI to our values as we continue to discover them, refine them, extrapolate them,</p>
<p>in an open-ended way, I think that&rsquo;s a tall order. And I think there are many more ways,</p>
<p>there must be many more ways of designing superintelligence that is not aligned in that way,</p>
<p>and is not ever approximating our values in that way. So I mean, Stuart&rsquo;s idea to</p>
<p>put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don&rsquo;t want to specify the value function up front.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to imagine you could ever write the code in such a way as to admit of no</p>
<p>loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain as to what human values are, and perpetually uncertain,</p>
<p>and always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by hewing more and more closely to what our</p>
<p>professed values are. So it&rsquo;s always interested in saying, oh no, no, that&rsquo;s not what we want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we intend. Stop doing that. No matter how smart it gets, all it wants to do is</p>
<p>more perfectly approximate human values. Now I think there are a lot of problems with that,</p>
<p>you know, at a high level. I&rsquo;m not a computer scientist, so I&rsquo;m sure there are many problems</p>
<p>at a low level that I don&rsquo;t understand. Like how to force a human into the loop always,</p>
<p>no matter what. There&rsquo;s that, and like what humans get a vote, and just what is, you know,</p>
<p>what do humans value, and what is the difference between what we say we value and our revealed</p>
<p>preferences, which, I mean, if you just, if you were a super intelligent AI that could look at</p>
<p>humanity now, I think you could be forgiven for concluding that what we value is driving</p>
<p>ourselves crazy with Twitter, and living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war,</p>
<p>and, you know, just watching, you know, hot girls in yoga pants on TikTok again, and again,</p>
<p>and again. It&rsquo;s like- And you&rsquo;re saying that is not?</p>
<p>This is all revealed preference, and it&rsquo;s what is an AI to make of that, right? And what should</p>
<p>it optimize? Like, so, part of, this is also Stuart&rsquo;s observation that one of the insidious</p>
<p>things about like the YouTube algorithm is it&rsquo;s not that it just caters to our preferences,</p>
<p>it actually begins to change us in ways so as to make us more predictable. Like it finds ways to</p>
<p>make us a better reporter of our preferences, and to trim our preferences down so that it can</p>
<p>further train to that signal. So, the main concern is that most of the people in the field</p>
<p>seem not to be taking intelligence seriously. Like, as they design</p>
<p>more and more intelligent machines, and as they profess to want to design true AGI,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not, again, they&rsquo;re not spending the time that Stuart is spending trying to figure out how</p>
<p>to do this safely, above all. They&rsquo;re just assuming that these problems are going to</p>
<p>solve themselves as we make that final stride into the end zone. Or they&rsquo;re saying very,</p>
<p>you know, Pollyanna-ish things like, you know, an AI would never form a motive to harm human-</p>
<p>like, why would it ever form a motive to be malicious toward humanity, right, unless we</p>
<p>put that motive in there, right? And that&rsquo;s not the concern. The concern is that in the presence of</p>
<p>vast disparities in competence, and certainly in a condition where the machines are improving</p>
<p>themselves, they&rsquo;re improving their own code, they could be developing instrumental goals</p>
<p>that are antithetical to our well-being without any intent to harm us, right? It&rsquo;s analogous to</p>
<p>what we do to every other species on Earth. I mean, you and I don&rsquo;t consciously form the intention</p>
<p>to harm insects on a daily basis, but there are many things we could intend to do that</p>
<p>would, in fact, harm insects, because, you know, you decide to repave your driveway,</p>
<p>or whatever you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re just not taking the interest of insects into account,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so far beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons. And</p>
<p>so the real challenge here is that if you believe that intelligence, you know, scales up on a</p>
<p>continuum toward heights that we can only dimly imagine, and I think there&rsquo;s every reason to</p>
<p>believe that. There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that we&rsquo;re near the summit of intelligence.</p>
<p>And you can define, you know, define, maybe there&rsquo;s some forms of intelligence for which</p>
<p>this is not true, but for many relevant forms, you know, like the top hundred things we care</p>
<p>about cognitively, I think there&rsquo;s every reason to believe that many of those things, most of those</p>
<p>things, are a lot like chess or Go, where once the machines get better than we are, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>stay better than we are. Although they&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know if you caught the recent thing with</p>
<p>Go, where this guy actually came out of Stuart&rsquo;s lab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One time a human beat a</p>
<p>machine in Go. Yeah, they found a hack for that. But anyway, ultimately,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be no looking back. And then the question is,</p>
<p>what do we do in relationship to these systems that are more competent than we are in every</p>
<p>relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship. The people who think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to figure this all out without thinking about it in advance, the solutions</p>
<p>are just going to find themselves, seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating</p>
<p>autonomous superintelligence seriously. What does that mean? It&rsquo;s every bit as</p>
<p>independent and ungovernable, ultimately, as us having created&hellip; I mean, just imagine if we</p>
<p>created a race of people that were 10 times smarter than all of us. How would we live with</p>
<p>those people? They&rsquo;re 10 times smarter than us, right? They begin to talk about things we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand. They begin to want things we don&rsquo;t understand. They begin to view us as obstacles</p>
<p>to their solving those problems or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the</p>
<p>monkeys in their presence. And I think that it&rsquo;s&hellip; But for some amazing solution of the sort that</p>
<p>Stuart is imagining, that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently,</p>
<p>no matter how intelligent scales, I think it&rsquo;s really worth worrying about this. I do buy the</p>
<p>sci-fi notion that this is an existential risk if we don&rsquo;t do it well.</p>
<p>I worry that we don&rsquo;t notice it. I&rsquo;m deeply impressed with Chad GPT, and I&rsquo;m worried</p>
<p>that it will become superintelligent. These language models will become superintelligent</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re basically trained in the collective intelligence of the human species.</p>
<p>And they will start controlling our behavior if they&rsquo;re integrated into our algorithms,</p>
<p>the recommender systems. And then we just won&rsquo;t notice that there is a superintelligent system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s controlling our behavior. Well, I think that&rsquo;s true even before, far before superintelligence,</p>
<p>even before general intelligence. I mean, I think just the narrow intelligence</p>
<p>of these algorithms and of what something like Chad GPT can do,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just far short of it developing its own goals that are at cross purposes with ours.</p>
<p>Just the unintended consequences of using it in the ways we&rsquo;re going to be incentivized to use it,</p>
<p>and the money to be made from scaling this thing, and what it does to our information space and our</p>
<p>sense of just being able to get to ground truth on any facts, it&rsquo;s super scary.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a giant leap in terms of the development towards AGI, Chad GPT, or</p>
<p>we still, is this just an impressive little toolbox? So when do you think the singularity</p>
<p>is coming? Or is it T, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s eventually?</p>
<p>I have no intuitions on that front apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress,</p>
<p>it will come. So it&rsquo;s just, you just have to assume we continue to make progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only two assumptions. You have to assume substrate independence. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no reason why this can&rsquo;t be done in silico. It&rsquo;s just, we can build arbitrarily intelligent</p>
<p>machines. There&rsquo;s nothing magical about having this done in the wetware of our own brains.</p>
<p>I think that is true. And I think that&rsquo;s scientifically parsimonious to think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true. And then you just have to assume we&rsquo;re going to keep making progress. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be any special rate of progress. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be Moore&rsquo;s law. It can just be,</p>
<p>we just keep going. At a certain point, we&rsquo;re going to be in relationship to minds leaving</p>
<p>consciousness aside. I don&rsquo;t have any reason to believe that they&rsquo;ll necessarily be conscious</p>
<p>by virtue of being super intelligent. And that&rsquo;s its own interesting ethical question. But</p>
<p>leaving consciousness aside, they&rsquo;re going to be more competent than we are. And then that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, the aliens have landed, you know, that&rsquo;s literally, that&rsquo;s an encounter with, again,</p>
<p>leaving aside the possibility that something like Stewart&rsquo;s path is actually available to us.</p>
<p>Actually available to us. But it is hard to picture</p>
<p>if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered, and it&rsquo;s truly general, if that scales</p>
<p>and, you know, begins to build upon itself, how you maintain that perfect,</p>
<p>slavish devotion until the end of time- The tether.</p>
<p>In those systems. The tether to humans.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think my gut says that that tether is not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to do it. So it&rsquo;s not this increasingly impossible problem.</p>
<p>Right. So I have no, you know, as you know, I&rsquo;m not a computer scientist. I have no intuitions</p>
<p>about just algorithmically how you would approach that and what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>My main intuition is maybe deeply flawed, but the main intuition is based on the fact that</p>
<p>most of the learning is currently happening on human knowledge. So even Chad GPT is just</p>
<p>trained on human data. Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see where the takeoff happens where you completely go above human wisdom. The current</p>
<p>impressive aspect of Chad GPT is that&rsquo;s using collective intelligence of all of us.</p>
<p>Well, from what I gleaned from, again, from people who know much more about this than I do,</p>
<p>I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of deep learning are actually going to</p>
<p>be sufficient to push us into AGI. Right. So it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re not generalizing in the way they</p>
<p>need to. They&rsquo;re certainly not learning like human children. And so they&rsquo;re, there&rsquo;s brittle</p>
<p>in strange ways. It&rsquo;s not to say that the human path is the only path, you know, and maybe there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we might learn better lessons by ignoring the way brains work, but we know that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>generalize and use abstraction the way we do. And so they have strange holes in their competence.</p>
<p>But the size of the holes is shrinking every time. And that&rsquo;s, so the intuition starts to</p>
<p>slowly fall apart. You know, the intuition is like, surely it can&rsquo;t be this simple</p>
<p>to achieve super intelligence. But it&rsquo;s becoming simpler and simpler. So I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the progress is quite incredible. I&rsquo;ve been extremely impressed with Chad GPT and the</p>
<p>new models, and there&rsquo;s a lot of financial incentive to make progress in this regard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re going to be living through some very interesting times.</p>
<p>In raising a question that I&rsquo;m going to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up this topic,</p>
<p>probably because Eric Weinstein talked to Joe Rogan recently, and said that he and you were</p>
<p>contacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the nature of this contact? Can you, that you were</p>
<p>contacted by? Well, I mean, I&rsquo;ve got very little to say on this. I mean, he has much more to say.</p>
<p>I think he went down this rabbit hole further than I did, which wouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got much more of a taste for this sort of thing than I do. But I think we were contacted</p>
<p>by the same person. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me who this person was, or how this person got my</p>
<p>cell phone number. They didn&rsquo;t seem, it didn&rsquo;t seem like we were getting punked. I mean,</p>
<p>the person seemed credible to me. And they were talking to you about the release of different</p>
<p>videos on UFOs. Yeah, and this is when there was a flurry of activity around this. So there was like,</p>
<p>there was a big New Yorker article on UFOs, and there was rumors of congressional hearings,</p>
<p>I think, coming, and there were the videos that were being debunked or not.</p>
<p>And so this person contacted both of us, I think, around the same time. And I think</p>
<p>he might have contacted Rogan or other&hellip; Eric is just the only person I&rsquo;ve spoken to about it,</p>
<p>I think, who I know was contacted. And what happened is the person kept writing a check</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t cash. Like, he kept saying, okay, next week, I&rsquo;m going to, you know, I understand</p>
<p>this is sounding spooky, and, you know, you have no reason to really trust me. But next week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put you on a Zoom call with people who you will recognize. And they&rsquo;re going to be,</p>
<p>you know, former heads of the CIA, and, you know, people who just, you&rsquo;re going to, within five</p>
<p>seconds of being on the Zoom call, you&rsquo;ll know this is not a hoax. And I said, great, just let</p>
<p>me know, just send me the Zoom link, right? And I went, that happened maybe three times,</p>
<p>you know, there was just one phone conversation, and then it was just texts,</p>
<p>you know, just a bunch of texts. And I think Eric spent more time with this person,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to him about it, I know he&rsquo;s spoken about it publicly, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So I, you know, it&rsquo;s not that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the thing never happened, and so I lost interest.</p>
<p>So you made a comment, which is interesting, that you ran the, which I really appreciate,</p>
<p>you ran the thought experiment of saying, okay, maybe we do have alien spacecraft,</p>
<p>or just the thought experiment the aliens did visit, and then this very kind of nihilistic,</p>
<p>sad thought that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter, it wouldn&rsquo;t affect your life. Can you explain that?</p>
<p>Well, no, I was, I think many people noticed this, I mean, this was a sign of how crazy</p>
<p>the news cycle was at that point, right? Like we had COVID, and we had Trump, and I forget when</p>
<p>this, the UFO thing was really kicking off, but it just seemed like no one had the bandwidth</p>
<p>to even be interested in this. It&rsquo;s like, I was amazed to notice in myself</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t more interested in figuring out what was going on. It&rsquo;s like, and I considered,</p>
<p>okay, wait a minute, this is, if this is true, this is the biggest story in anyone&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>I mean, contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest story in anyone&rsquo;s lifetime,</p>
<p>in human history. Why isn&rsquo;t this just totally captivating? And not only was it not totally</p>
<p>captivating, it was just barely rising to the level of my being able to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>And I view that, I mean, one as a, to some degree, an understandable defense mechanism against</p>
<p>the bogus claims that have been made about this kind of thing in the past.</p>
<p>The general sense is probably bullshit, or it probably has some explanation that is purely</p>
<p>terrestrial and not surprising. And there is somebody who, what&rsquo;s his name, Mick West,</p>
<p>I forget, is it a YouTuber? Yeah, Mick West, yeah. He debunks stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I have since seen some of those videos, I mean, now this is going back still at least a</p>
<p>year, but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the optical</p>
<p>evidence. And I&rsquo;m surprised we haven&rsquo;t seen more of that. Like there was a</p>
<p>fairly credulous 60 minutes piece that came out around that time looking at some of that video,</p>
<p>and it was the very video that he was debunking on YouTube. And his video only had like</p>
<p>50,000 views on it or whatever. But again, it seemed like a fairly credible debunking. I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen debunkings of his debunkings, but&hellip; I think there is, but he&rsquo;s basically saying that there is</p>
<p>possible explanations for it. Right.</p>
<p>And usually in these kinds of contexts, if there&rsquo;s a possible explanation,</p>
<p>even if it seems unlikely, it&rsquo;s going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle,</p>
<p>which I think is generally true.</p>
<p>Well, with aliens, I think generally, I think there should be some humility about what</p>
<p>they would look like when they show up. I tend to think they&rsquo;re already here.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about this AI conversation though, is that we&rsquo;re talking about a circumstance</p>
<p>where we would be designing the aliens, and there&rsquo;s every reason to believe that eventually</p>
<p>this is going to happen. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not at all skeptical about the coming reality of the</p>
<p>aliens that we&rsquo;re going to build them.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the thing. Does this apply to when superintelligence shows up?</p>
<p>Will this be trending on Twitter for a day? And then we&rsquo;ll go on to complain about</p>
<p>something Sam Harris once again said in his podcast the next day. You tend to trend on Twitter,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re not on Twitter, which is great.</p>
<p>Yeah. I haven&rsquo;t noticed. I did notice when I was on, but&hellip;</p>
<p>You have this concern about AGI basically, same kind of thing, that we would just look the other</p>
<p>way. Is there something about this time where even World War III, which has been throwing around</p>
<p>very casually, concerningly so, even that, the news cycle wipes that away?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think we have this general problem that we can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>certain information, even unequivocally certain information, emotionally salient. Like we respond</p>
<p>quite readily to certain things. I mean, as we talked about, we respond to the little girl who</p>
<p>fell down a well. I mean, that gets 100% of our emotional resources. But the abstract probability</p>
<p>of nuclear war, even a high probability, even an intolerable probability, even if we put it at</p>
<p>30%, right? It&rsquo;s just like that&rsquo;s Russian roulette with a gun with three chambers. And it&rsquo;s aimed at</p>
<p>the heads, not only your head, but your kid&rsquo;s head and everyone&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s head. And it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>24 hours a day. And I mean, I think people who&hellip; This is pre-Ukraine. I think the people who have</p>
<p>made it their business to&hellip; Professionally, to think about the risk of nuclear war and to</p>
<p>mitigate it, people like Graham Allison or William Perry. I mean, I think they were putting</p>
<p>the ongoing risk. I mean, just the risk that we&rsquo;re going to have a proper nuclear war at some point</p>
<p>in the next generation, people were putting it at something like 50%, right? They were living</p>
<p>with this sort of Damocles over our heads. Now, you might wonder whether anyone can have</p>
<p>reliable intuitions about the probability of that kind of thing, but the status quo is truly</p>
<p>alarming. I mean, we&rsquo;ve got ICBMs on. I mean, leave aside smaller exchanges and tactical nukes</p>
<p>and how we could have a world war based on incremental changes. We&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest cities in both directions. And it&rsquo;s old technology,</p>
<p>right? And it&rsquo;s vulnerable to some lunatic deciding to launch or misreading bad data.</p>
<p>And we know we&rsquo;ve been saved from nuclear war, I think at least twice by</p>
<p>Soviet submarine commanders deciding, I&rsquo;m not going to pass this up the chain of command,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s like, this is almost certainly an error. And it turns out it was an error.</p>
<p>And we need people to&hellip; I mean, in that particular case, he saw, I think it was five,</p>
<p>what seemed like five missiles launched from the US to Russia. And he reasoned if America was going</p>
<p>to engage in a first strike, they&rsquo;d launch more than five missiles, right? So this has to be</p>
<p>fictional. And then he waited long enough to decide that it was fictional. But</p>
<p>the probability of a nuclear war happening by mistake or some other species of inadvertence,</p>
<p>misunderstanding, technical malfunction, that&rsquo;s intolerable. Forget about the intentional use</p>
<p>of it by people who are driven crazy by some ideology.</p>
<p>And more and more technologies are enabled to kind of scale destruction.</p>
<p>And misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is especially scary. I mean,</p>
<p>once you can get a deep fake of any current president of the United States claiming to</p>
<p>have launched a first strike, and just send that everywhere.</p>
<p>But that could change the nature of truth. And then that might change the</p>
<p>engine we have for skepticism, sharpen it, the more you have deep fakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we might have AI and digital watermarks that help us. Maybe we&rsquo;ll not trust any</p>
<p>information that hasn&rsquo;t come through specific channels, right? I mean, so in my world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I no longer feel the need to respond to anything other than what I put out in my</p>
<p>channels of information. It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s so many people who have clipped stuff of me</p>
<p>that shows the opposite of what I was actually saying in context. I mean, the people have</p>
<p>like re-edited my podcast audio to make it seem like I said the opposite of what I was saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, unless I put it out, you can&rsquo;t be sure that I actually said it. I mean, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to live like that for all forms of information. And</p>
<p>I mean, strangely, I think it may require a greater siloing of information in the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re living through this sort of Wild West period where everyone&rsquo;s got a newsletter,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s got a blog, and everyone&rsquo;s got an opinion. But once you can fake everything&hellip;</p>
<p>There might be a greater value for expertise, for experts, but a more rigorous system for</p>
<p>identifying who the experts are.</p>
<p>Yeah, or just knowing that it&rsquo;s gonna be an arms race to authenticate information. So it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you can never trust a photograph unless it has been vetted by Getty Images,</p>
<p>because only Getty Images has the resources to authenticate the provenance of that photograph,</p>
<p>and attest that it hasn&rsquo;t been meddled with by AI. And again, I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>technically possible. I mean, maybe whatever the tools available for this will be commodified,</p>
<p>and the cost will be driven to zero so quickly that everyone will be able to do it. It could</p>
<p>be like encryption, but&hellip;</p>
<p>And it would be proven and tested most effectively first, of course, as always in porn.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Which is where most of human innovation technology happens first.</p>
<p>Well, I have to ask, because Ron Howard, the director, asked us on Twitter,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re talking about the threat of nuclear war and otherwise, he asked,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in both your expectations for human society if, when we move beyond Mars.</p>
<p>Will those societies be industrial-based? How will it be governed? How will criminal</p>
<p>infractions be dealt with? When you read or watch sci-fi, what comes closest to sounding</p>
<p>logical? Do you think about our society beyond Earth? If we colonize Mars, if we colonize space?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think I have a pretty&hellip;</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>&hellip;humbling picture of that, because we&rsquo;re still going to be the apes that we are. So,</p>
<p>when you imagine colonizing Mars, you have to imagine a first fistfight on Mars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have to imagine a first murder on Mars.</p>
<p>Also, infidelity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Somebody&hellip;</p>
<p>Extramarital affairs on Mars. So, it&rsquo;s going to get really homely and boring really fast,</p>
<p>I think. It&rsquo;s like only the spacesuits or the other exigencies of just living in that</p>
<p>atmosphere or lack thereof will limit how badly we can behave on Mars.</p>
<p>But do you think most of the interaction will be still in meatspace versus digital?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be&hellip; Do you think we&rsquo;re living through a transformation of a kind</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to be doing more and more interaction in digital space?</p>
<p>Like, everything we&rsquo;ve been complaining about Twitter, is it possible that Twitter&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>early days of a broken system that&rsquo;s actually giving birth to a better working system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ultimately digital?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>experience a pendulum swing back into the real world. I mean, I think many of us are experiencing</p>
<p>that now anyway. I mean, just wanting to have face-to-face encounters and spend less time</p>
<p>on our phones and less time online. I mean, I think maybe everyone isn&rsquo;t going in that direction, but</p>
<p>I do notice it myself. And I notice&hellip; I mean, once I got off Twitter, then I noticed the people</p>
<p>who were never on Twitter, right? And the people who were never&hellip; I mean, I know I have a lot of</p>
<p>friends who are never on Twitter, and they actually never understood what I was doing on</p>
<p>Twitter. It&rsquo;s like they just&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t that they were seeing it and then reacting to it,</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s like being on&hellip; It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not on Reddit either, but I don&rsquo;t spend</p>
<p>any time thinking about not being on Reddit, right? It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just not on Reddit.</p>
<p>Do you think the pursuit of human happiness is better achieved,</p>
<p>more effectively achieved outside of Twitter world?</p>
<p>Well, I think all we have is our attention in the end, and we just have to notice what</p>
<p>these various tools are doing to it. And it&rsquo;s just&hellip; It became very clear to me that</p>
<p>it was an unrewarding use of my attention. Now, it&rsquo;s not to say there isn&rsquo;t some digital</p>
<p>platform that&rsquo;s conceivable that would be useful and rewarding, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we just have&hellip; Our life is doled out to us in moments, and we have&hellip; And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>continually solving this riddle of what is going to suffice to make this moment engaging and</p>
<p>meaningful and aligned with who I want to be now and how I want the future to look, right?</p>
<p>And we have this tension between being in the present and becoming in the future.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a seeming paradox. Again, it&rsquo;s not really a paradox, but it can seem like&hellip;</p>
<p>I do think the ground truth for personal well-being is to find a mode of being where</p>
<p>you can pay attention to the present moment. And this is meditation by another name.</p>
<p>You can pay attention to the present moment with sufficient gravity that</p>
<p>you recognize that just consciousness itself in the present moment, no matter what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>is already a circumstance of freedom and contentment and tranquility. You can be happy</p>
<p>now before anything happens, before this next desire gets gratified, before this next problem</p>
<p>gets solved. There&rsquo;s this kind of ground truth that you&rsquo;re free, that consciousness is free and</p>
<p>open and unencumbered by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the problems</p>
<p>that may yet be real for you. So the ability to catch and observe consciousness, that in itself</p>
<p>is a source of happiness. Yeah, without being lost in thought. And so this happens haphazardly</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t meditate because they find something in their life that&rsquo;s so captivating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so pleasurable, it&rsquo;s so thrilling. It can even be scary, but even being scared is</p>
<p>captivating. It gets their attention, whatever it is. Sebastian Junger wrote a great book about</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s experience in war here. Strangely, it can be the best experience anyone&rsquo;s ever had</p>
<p>because everything, it&rsquo;s like only the moment matters, right? The bullet is whizzing by your</p>
<p>head. You&rsquo;re not thinking about your 401k or that thing that you didn&rsquo;t say last week to the person</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have been talking about. You&rsquo;re not thinking about Twitter. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fully immersed in the present moment. Meditation is the only way&hellip; I mean, that word can mean</p>
<p>many things to many people, but what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a</p>
<p>a way to engage the present moment directly, regardless of what&rsquo;s happening. You don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be in a war. You don&rsquo;t need to be having sex. You don&rsquo;t need to be on drugs. You don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>be surfing. There doesn&rsquo;t have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary,</p>
<p>but you can recognize that in some basic sense, there&rsquo;s only this, and everything else is</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re thinking. You&rsquo;re thinking about the past. You&rsquo;re thinking about the future.</p>
<p>Thoughts themselves have no substance. It&rsquo;s fundamentally mysterious that any thought</p>
<p>ever really commandeers your sense of who you are and makes you anxious or afraid or angry or</p>
<p>whatever it is. The more you discover that, the half-life of all these negative emotions that</p>
<p>blow all of us around get much, much shorter. You can literally just&hellip; The anger that would</p>
<p>have kept you angry for hours or days lasts four seconds, because the moment it arises,</p>
<p>you recognize it, and you can get off that. You can decide. At minimum, you can decide whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to stay angry at that moment. Obviously, it usually isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the illusion of free will is one of those thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s all just happening. Even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like even the moments where you recognize or not recognize is just happening.</p>
<p>This does open up a degree of freedom for a person, but it&rsquo;s not a freedom that gives any</p>
<p>motivation to the notion of free will. It&rsquo;s just a new way of being in the world.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will is an illusion and</p>
<p>really experiencing it? What&rsquo;s the longest you&rsquo;ve been able to experience?</p>
<p>The escape, the illusion of free will.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s always obvious to me when I pay attention. Whenever I&rsquo;m mindful, the term of</p>
<p>jargon in the Buddhist and increasingly outside the Buddhist context is mindfulness, right? But</p>
<p>there are different levels of mindfulness, and there&rsquo;s different degrees of insight into this.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m calling evidence of lack of free will and lack of the self, I&rsquo;ve got two sides of the</p>
<p>same coin. There&rsquo;s a sense of being a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience</p>
<p>refers, a sense of I, a sense of me. And that&rsquo;s almost everybody&rsquo;s starting point when they start</p>
<p>to meditate. And that&rsquo;s almost always the place people live most of their lives from. I do think</p>
<p>that gets interrupted in ways they get unrecognized. I think people are constantly losing</p>
<p>the sense of I. They&rsquo;re losing the sense of subject, object, distance, but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>recognizing it. And meditation is the mode in which you can recognize. You can both consciously</p>
<p>precipitate it. You can look for the self and fail to find it and then recognize its absence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the flip side of the coin of free will. The feeling of having free will is</p>
<p>what it feels like to feel like a self who&rsquo;s thinking his thoughts and doing his actions</p>
<p>and intending his intentions. And the man in the middle of the boat who&rsquo;s rowing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the false starting point. When you find that there&rsquo;s no one in the middle of the boat,</p>
<p>or in fact, there&rsquo;s no boat, there&rsquo;s just the river, there&rsquo;s just the flow of experience,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no center to it, and there&rsquo;s no place from which you would control it.</p>
<p>Again, even when you&rsquo;re doing things, this does not negate the difference between voluntary</p>
<p>and involuntary behavior. It&rsquo;s like, I can voluntarily reach for this, but when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>paying attention, I&rsquo;m aware that everything is just happening. The intention to move is just</p>
<p>arising. And I&rsquo;m in no position to know why it didn&rsquo;t arise a moment before or a moment later,</p>
<p>or a moment 50% stronger or weaker, or so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective,</p>
<p>where I lurched for it versus I move slow. I can never run the counterfactuals.</p>
<p>All of this opens the door to an even more disconcerting picture along the same lines,</p>
<p>which subsumes this conversation about free will. And it&rsquo;s the question of whether</p>
<p>anything is ever possible. This is a question I haven&rsquo;t thought a lot about it, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a few years I&rsquo;ve been kicking this question around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, what if only the actual is possible? So we live with this feeling of possibility. We</p>
<p>live with the sense that, let me tell you, so I have two daughters. I could have had a third</p>
<p>child. So what does it mean to say that I could have had a third child? You don&rsquo;t have kids,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think. So- Not that I know of.</p>
<p>So the possibility might be there. Right. So what do we mean when we say</p>
<p>you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future? What is the space in reality?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality? Is there a reality in which</p>
<p>non-actual things are nonetheless real? And so we have other categories of non-concrete things.</p>
<p>We have things that don&rsquo;t have spatial, temporal dimension, but they&rsquo;re nonetheless,</p>
<p>they nonetheless exist. So like, you know, the integers, right? So numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reality, there&rsquo;s an abstract reality to numbers. And this is, it&rsquo;s philosophically</p>
<p>interesting to think about these things. So they&rsquo;re not like, in some sense, they&rsquo;re real</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not merely invented by us, they&rsquo;re discovered because they have structure that we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t impose upon them, right? It&rsquo;s not like, they&rsquo;re not fictional characters like, you know,</p>
<p>Hamlet and Superman also exist in some sense, but they exist at a level of our own fiction and</p>
<p>abstraction. But it&rsquo;s like, there are true and false statements you can make about Hamlet.</p>
<p>There are true and false statements you can make about Superman, because our fiction,</p>
<p>the fictional worlds we&rsquo;ve created have a certain kind of structure. But again,</p>
<p>this is all abstract. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s all abstractable from any of its concrete instantiations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just in the comic books and just in the movies. It&rsquo;s in our, you know, ongoing ideas about</p>
<p>these characters. But natural numbers or the integers don&rsquo;t function quite that way. I mean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re similar, but they also have a structure that&rsquo;s purely a matter of discovery. It&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just make up whether numbers are prime. You know, if you give me two integers,</p>
<p>you know, of a certain size, you mentioned two enormous integers. If I were to say,</p>
<p>okay, well, between those two integers, they&rsquo;re exactly 11 prime numbers, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very specific claim about which I can be right or wrong, whether or not anyone knows</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right or wrong. It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a domain of facts there, but these are</p>
<p>abstract. It&rsquo;s an abstract reality that relates in some way that&rsquo;s philosophically interesting,</p>
<p>you know, metaphysically interesting to what we call real reality, you know, the spatial,</p>
<p>temporal order, the physics of things. But possibility, at least in my view,</p>
<p>occupies a different space. And this is something, again, my thoughts on this are pretty</p>
<p>inchoate, and I think I need to talk to a philosopher of physics and or physicist about</p>
<p>how this may interact with things like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting, right, exactly. So, I wonder if discoveries in physics,</p>
<p>like further proof or more concrete proof that many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>has some validity, if that completely starts to change things.</p>
<p>But even, that&rsquo;s just more actuality. So, if I took that seriously,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a case of, and truth is, that happens even if the many worlds interpretation isn&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>but we just imagine we have a physically infinite universe, the implication of infinity is such that</p>
<p>things will begin to repeat themselves, you know, the farther you go in space, right? So,</p>
<p>if you just head out in one direction, eventually you&rsquo;re going to meet two people just like us</p>
<p>having a conversation just like this, and you&rsquo;re going to meet them an infinite number of times</p>
<p>in every, you know, infinite variety of permutations slightly different from this</p>
<p>conversation, right? So, I mean, infinity is just so big that our intuitions of probability</p>
<p>completely break down. But what I&rsquo;m suggesting is maybe probability isn&rsquo;t a thing, right? Maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only actuality. Maybe there&rsquo;s only what happens, and at every point along the way,</p>
<p>our notion of what could have happened or what might have happened is just that, it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>thought about what could have happened or might have happened.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a fundamentally different thing. If you can imagine a thing, that doesn&rsquo;t make it real.</p>
<p>So, because that&rsquo;s where that possibility exists, it&rsquo;s in your imagination, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and possibility itself is a kind of spooky idea because it too has a sort of structure,</p>
<p>right? So, like if I&rsquo;m going to say,</p>
<p>you know, you could have had a daughter, right, last year.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s possible but not actual, right? That is a claim. There are things that</p>
<p>are true and not true about that daughter, right? Like, it has a kind of structure. It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of fog around the possibility. It feels like almost like a useful</p>
<p>narrative.</p>
<p>But what does it mean? So, like, what does it mean if we say, you know, I just did that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s conceivable that I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that, right? Like, it&rsquo;s possible that I just</p>
<p>threw this cap, but I might not have done that.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re taking it very temporally close to the original, like what would appear as a decision.</p>
<p>Whenever we&rsquo;re saying something is possible but not actual, right? Like this thing just happened,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s conceivable, it&rsquo;s possible that it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened or that it would have</p>
<p>happened differently. In what does that possibility consist? Like, where is that?</p>
<p>For that to be real, for the possibility to be real, what claim are we making about the universe?</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion,</p>
<p>that all we have is actuality, that the possibility is an illusion?</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, I&rsquo;m just extending it beyond human action.</p>
<p>This goes to the physics of things. This is just everything. Like, we&rsquo;re always telling</p>
<p>ourselves a story that includes possibility.</p>
<p>Possibility is really compelling for some reason.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, because it&rsquo;s&hellip; I mean, so this&hellip; Yeah, I mean, this could sound just academic,</p>
<p>but every backward-looking regret or disappointment and every forward-looking worry</p>
<p>is completely dependent on this notion of possibility. Like, every regret is based</p>
<p>on the sense that something else&hellip; I could have done something else, something else could</p>
<p>have happened. Every disposition to worry about the future is based on the feeling that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this range of possibilities. It could go either way. And whether or not there&rsquo;s such a thing as</p>
<p>possibility, I&rsquo;m convinced that worry is almost never psychologically appropriate, because the</p>
<p>reality is that in any given moment, either you can do something to solve the problem you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried about or not. So if you can do something, just do it. And if you can&rsquo;t, your worrying is</p>
<p>just causing you to suffer twice over, right? You&rsquo;re going to get the medical procedure next</p>
<p>week anyway. How much time between now and next week do you want to spend worrying about it,</p>
<p>right? The worry doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything.</p>
<p>How much do physicists think about possibility?</p>
<p>Well, they think about it in terms of probability more often, but probability just describes&hellip;</p>
<p>And again, this is a place where I might be out of my depth and need to</p>
<p>talk to somebody to debunk this, but the&hellip;</p>
<p>To do therapy with a physicist.</p>
<p>Yeah. But probability, it seems, just describes a pattern of actuality that we&rsquo;ve observed,</p>
<p>right? I mean, there are certain things we observe, and those are the actual things that</p>
<p>have happened. And we have this additional story about probability. I mean, we have the frequency</p>
<p>with which things happen, have happened in the past. I can flip a fair coin and know in the</p>
<p>abstract that I have a belief that in the limit, those flips, those tosses should converge on 50%</p>
<p>heads and 50% tails. I know I have a story as to why it&rsquo;s not going to be exactly 50% within any</p>
<p>arbitrary timeframe. But in reality, all we ever have are the observed tosses, right? And then we</p>
<p>have an additional story that, oh, it came up heads, but it could have come up tails.</p>
<p>Why do we think that about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true about the physics</p>
<p>of things if we say it could have been otherwise? I think we&rsquo;re claiming that probability is true,</p>
<p>that it allows us to have a nice model about the world, gives us hope about the world.</p>
<p>Yeah. It seems that possibility has to be somewhere to be effective. It&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s happening with the laws of&hellip; There&rsquo;s something metaphysically interesting about the</p>
<p>laws of nature too, because the laws of nature&hellip; So the laws of nature impose their work on the</p>
<p>world, right? We see their evidence. But they&rsquo;re not reducible to any specific set of instances,</p>
<p>right? So there&rsquo;s some structure there, but the structure isn&rsquo;t just a matter of the actual</p>
<p>things. We have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each other. All of that actuality can</p>
<p>be explained by what actual things are actually doing. But then we have this notion that in</p>
<p>addition to that, we have the laws of nature that are explaining this act. But how are the laws of</p>
<p>nature an additional thing in addition to just the actual things that actually affect causally?</p>
<p>And if they are an additional thing, how are they effective if they&rsquo;re not among the actual</p>
<p>things that are just actually banging around? And so to some degree&hellip;</p>
<p>For that&hellip; Possibly it has to be hiding somewhere for the laws of nature to be&hellip;</p>
<p>To be possible. For anything to be possible, it has to be&hellip;</p>
<p>It has to have&hellip;</p>
<p>Closet somewhere, I&rsquo;m sure, is where all the possibility goes.</p>
<p>It has to be attached to something. So&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think many worlds is that? Because many worlds still exist.</p>
<p>Well, because we&rsquo;re in this strand of that multiverse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right? So still you have just a local instance of what is actual.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can&rsquo;t be affected by it, there&rsquo;s more actuality.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really connect with the other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so many worlds are just a statement of</p>
<p>basically everything that can happen, happens somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s not an entirely kosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s whatever happens, right? In fact, relativistically, there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s original notion of a block universe seems to suggest this. And it&rsquo;s been a while</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;ve been in a conversation with a physicist where I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to ask about the</p>
<p>standing of this concept in physics currently. I don&rsquo;t hear it discussed much, but the idea of a</p>
<p>block universe is that space-time exists as a totality. And our sense that we are traveling</p>
<p>through space-time where there&rsquo;s a real difference between the past and the future,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s an illusion of just the weird slice we&rsquo;re taking of this larger object.</p>
<p>But on some level, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re reading a novel. The last page of the novel exists</p>
<p>just as much as the first page when you&rsquo;re in the middle of it. And they&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re living in anything like that, then there&rsquo;s no such thing as possibility. It would</p>
<p>seem there&rsquo;s just what is actual. So as a matter of our experience moment to moment,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s totally compatible with that being true, that there is only what is actual. And</p>
<p>that sounds to the naive ear, that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and</p>
<p>confining, but it&rsquo;s anything but. It&rsquo;s actually&hellip; It&rsquo;s a circumstance of pure discovery. You have</p>
<p>no idea what&rsquo;s going to happen next. You don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re going to be tomorrow. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only by tendency seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. There&rsquo;s way more freedom in all</p>
<p>of that than it seems true to many people. And yet, the basic insight is that you&rsquo;re not&hellip;</p>
<p>The real freedom is the recognition that you&rsquo;re not in control of anything. Everything is just</p>
<p>happening, including your thoughts and intentions and moods.</p>
<p>So life is a process of continuous discovery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part of the universe. You are just this&hellip; It&rsquo;s the miracle that the universe is illuminated</p>
<p>to itself as itself where you sit, and you&rsquo;re continually discovering what your life is.</p>
<p>And then you have this layer at which you&rsquo;re telling yourself a story that you already know</p>
<p>what your life is, and you know exactly who you should be and what&rsquo;s about to happen, or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that. And yet, there is this</p>
<p>fundamental mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all NPCs in a most marvelous video game.</p>
<p>Maybe, although my sense of gaming does not run as deep as to know what I&rsquo;m committing to. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a non-playing character.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more&hellip; Yeah. Oh, wow. Yes. You&rsquo;re more of a Mario Kart guy, I can tell.</p>
<p>I was an original video gamer, but it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&hellip; I was there for Pong.</p>
<p>I remember when I saw the first Pong in a restaurant in&hellip; I think it was like</p>
<p>Benihana&rsquo;s or something. They had a Pong table, and that was just an amazing moment when you&hellip;</p>
<p>You, Sam Harris, might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a superintelligent</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that happened fast, if it happens any time in my lifetime.</p>
<p>From Pong to AGI.</p>
<p>What kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider a waste of time?</p>
<p>Purely for fun?</p>
<p>Because meditation doesn&rsquo;t count, because most people would say that&rsquo;s not a waste of time.</p>
<p>Is there something like Pong that&rsquo;s a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think&hellip; Well, I mean, once or twice a year, I will play a round of golf,</p>
<p>which many people would find embarrassing. They might even find my play embarrassing, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you find it embarrassing?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I love&hellip; Golf just takes way too much time,</p>
<p>so I can only squander a certain amount of time on it. I do love it. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But you have no control over your actual performance. You&rsquo;re ever discovering&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I do have control over my mediocre performance, but I don&rsquo;t have enough control</p>
<p>as to make it really good. But happily, I&rsquo;m in the perfect spot, because I don&rsquo;t invest</p>
<p>enough time in it to care how I play, so I just have fun when I play.</p>
<p>Well, I hope there&rsquo;ll be a day where you play around golf with the former president,</p>
<p>Donald Trump, and I would love to be&hellip;</p>
<p>I would bet on him if we played golf. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a better golfer.</p>
<p>I miss the chaos of human civilization in modern times, as we&rsquo;ve talked about. What gives you hope</p>
<p>about this world in the coming year, in the coming decade, in the coming 100 years,</p>
<p>maybe 1,000 years? What&rsquo;s the source of hope for you?</p>
<p>Well, it comes back to a few of the things we&rsquo;ve talked about. I think I&rsquo;m hopeful. I know that</p>
<p>most people are good and are mostly converging on the same core values. We&rsquo;re not surrounded by</p>
<p>psychopaths. The thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was how different life</p>
<p>was seeming through the lens of Twitter. I just got the sense that there are way more psychopaths</p>
<p>or effective psychopaths than I realized, and then I thought, okay, this isn&rsquo;t real. This is</p>
<p>either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving like psychopaths,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a bot army or something that I don&rsquo;t have to take seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just think most people&hellip; If we can get the incentives right,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t really thrive collectively. There&rsquo;s enough wealth to go</p>
<p>around. There&rsquo;s no effective limit. I mean, again, within the limits of what&rsquo;s physically possible,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re nowhere near the limit on abundance. Forget about going to Mars. On this, the one</p>
<p>rock. We could make this place incredibly beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to</p>
<p>solve some rather longstanding political problems.</p>
<p>The problem of incentives. To you, the basic characteristics of human nature are such that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be okay if the incentives are okay. We&rsquo;ll do pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about the asymmetries, that it&rsquo;s easier to break things than to fix them. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easier to light a fire than to put it out. I do worry that as technology gets more and more</p>
<p>powerful, it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw</p>
<p>things up for everybody. It&rsquo;s easier. A thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person</p>
<p>to range the lives of millions, much less billions. Now that&rsquo;s getting to be possible.</p>
<p>On the assumption that we&rsquo;re always going to have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or</p>
<p>malevolent individuals, we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our heads screwed on straight</p>
<p>about, so gain-of-function research. Just how much do we want to democratize</p>
<p>all the relevant technologies there? Do we really want to</p>
<p>give everyone the ability to order nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for</p>
<p>viruses online because you&rsquo;re a free-speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be</p>
<p>exportable everywhere?</p>
<p>There are limits to&hellip; Many people are confused about my take on free speech because I&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>down on the unpopular side of some of these questions. My overriding concern</p>
<p>is that in many cases, I&rsquo;m worried about the free speech of individual businesses or individual</p>
<p>platforms or individual media people to decide that they don&rsquo;t want to be associated with certain</p>
<p>things. If you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the</p>
<p>Nazi you don&rsquo;t want to be associated with because it&rsquo;s your platform, you own it. That&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>free speech. That&rsquo;s the side of my free speech concern for Twitter. It&rsquo;s not that every Nazi has</p>
<p>the right to algorithmic speech on Twitter. I think if you own Twitter, you should be&hellip; Whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just Elon or in the world where it wasn&rsquo;t Elon, just the people who own Twitter and the</p>
<p>board and the shareholders and the employees, these people should be free to decide what they</p>
<p>want to promote or not. I view them as publishers more than as platforms in the end, and</p>
<p>that has other implications. But I do worry about this problem of misinformation</p>
<p>and algorithmically and otherwise supercharged misinformation.</p>
<p>And I do think we&rsquo;re at a bottleneck now. I guess it could be the hubris of every present</p>
<p>generation to think that their moment is especially important. But I do think with</p>
<p>the emergence of these technologies, we&rsquo;re at some kind of bottleneck where we really have to</p>
<p>figure out how to get this right. And if we do get this right, if we figure out how to not drive</p>
<p>ourselves crazy by giving people access to all possible information and misinformation at all</p>
<p>times, I think, yeah, we could&hellip; There&rsquo;s no limit to how happily we could collaborate with</p>
<p>billions of creative, fulfilled people. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>And trillions of robots, some of them sex robots, but that&rsquo;s another topic.</p>
<p>Robots that are running the right algorithm, whatever that algorithm is.</p>
<p>Whatever you need in your life to make you happy. Sam, the first time we talked is one of the huge</p>
<p>honors of my life. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for a long time. The few times you were respectful</p>
<p>but critical to me means the world. And thank you so much for helping me and caring enough about the</p>
<p>world and for everything you do. But I should say that the few of us that try to put love in the</p>
<p>world on Twitter miss you on Twitter, but&hellip; Well, enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t break anything, kids. Have a good party without me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Very happy to do this. Thanks for the invitation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Great to see you again.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening. I&rsquo;d hope to see you next time.</p>
