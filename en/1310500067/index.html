    <p>The following is a conversation with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner in economics,</p>
<p>professor at CUNY, and columnist at the New York Times. His academic work centers around</p>
<p>international economics, economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises. But he</p>
<p>also is an outspoken writer and commentator on the intersection of modern day politics</p>
<p>and economics, which places him in the middle of the tense, divisive, modern day political discourse.</p>
<p>If you have clicked dislike on this video and started writing a comment of derision before</p>
<p>listening to the conversation, I humbly ask that you please unsubscribe from this channel</p>
<p>and from this podcast. Not because you&rsquo;re conservative, a libertarian, a liberal,</p>
<p>a socialist, an anarchist, but because you&rsquo;re not open to new ideas, at least in this case,</p>
<p>especially at its most difficult, from people with whom you largely disagree.</p>
<p>I do my best to stay away from politics of the day because political discourse is filled</p>
<p>with a degree of emotion and self assured certainty that to me is not conducive to exploring</p>
<p>questions that nobody knows the definitive right answer to. The role of government,</p>
<p>the impact of automation, the regulation of tech, the medical system, guns, war, trade,</p>
<p>foreign policy, are not easy topics and have no clear answers, despite the certainty of the so</p>
<p>called experts, the pundits, the trolls, the media personalities, and the conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Please listen, empathize, and allow yourself to explore ideas with curiosity and without judgment</p>
<p>and without derision. I will speak with many more economists and political thinkers, trying to stay</p>
<p>away from the political battles of the day and instead look at the long arc of history</p>
<p>and the lessons it reveals. In this, I appreciate your patience and support.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>fractional share trading, allowing you to buy one dollars worth of a stock no matter what the stock</p>
<p>price is. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>Get Cash App from the App Store and Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST. You&rsquo;ll get ten dollars</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping</p>
<p>to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. Since Cash App does</p>
<p>fractional share trading, let me say that to me, it&rsquo;s a fascinating concept. The order execution</p>
<p>algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders for the</p>
<p>investor is an algorithmic marvel, so big props to the Cash App engineers for that. I like it when</p>
<p>tech teams solve complicated problems to provide, in the end, a simple, effortless interface that</p>
<p>abstracts away all the details of the underlying algorithm. And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with</p>
<p>Paul Krugman. What does a perfect world, a utopia, from an economics perspective look like?</p>
<p>Wow, I don&rsquo;t really, I don&rsquo;t believe in perfection. I mean, somebody once once said</p>
<p>that his ideal was slightly imaginary Sweden. I mean, I like an economy that has a really high</p>
<p>safety net for people, good environmental regulation, and something that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>some of the better run countries in the world, but with fixing all of the smaller things that</p>
<p>are wrong with them. What about wealth distribution? Well, obviously, you know, total equality is</p>
<p>neither possible nor, I think, especially desirable, but I think you want one where,</p>
<p>basically one where nobody is hurting and where everybody lives in the same material universe.</p>
<p>Everybody is basically living in the same society, so I think it&rsquo;s a bad thing to have</p>
<p>people who are so wealthy that they&rsquo;re really not in the same world as the rest of us.</p>
<p>What about competition? Do you see the value of competition? What may be its limits?</p>
<p>Oh, competition is great when it can work. I mean, I remember, I&rsquo;m old enough to remember</p>
<p>when there was only one phone company and there was really limited choice, and I think the</p>
<p>arrival of multiple phone carriers and all that has actually, you know, it&rsquo;s been a really good</p>
<p>thing, and that&rsquo;s true across many areas, but not every industry is, not every activity is suitable</p>
<p>for competition. So, there are some things like healthcare where competition actually</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work, and so it&rsquo;s not one size fits all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. Why does competition not work in healthcare?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a long list. I mean, there&rsquo;s a famous paper by Kenneth Arrow from 1963,</p>
<p>which still holds up very well, where he kind of runs down the list of things you need for</p>
<p>competition to work well. Basically, both sides to every transaction being well informed,</p>
<p>having the ability to make intelligent decisions, understanding what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>and healthcare fails on every dimension.</p>
<p>Healthcare, so not health insurance, healthcare.</p>
<p>Well, both healthcare and health insurance, health insurance being part of it, but no,</p>
<p>health insurance is really the idea that there&rsquo;s effective competition between health insurers is</p>
<p>wrong, and healthcare, I mean, the idea that you can comparison shop for major surgery is just,</p>
<p>you know, when people say things like that, you wonder, are you living in the same world I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>living in?</p>
<p>You know, that piece of well informed, that was always an interesting piece for me,</p>
<p>just observing as an outsider, because so much beautiful, such a beautiful world is</p>
<p>possible when everybody&rsquo;s well informed. My question for you is, how hard is it to be</p>
<p>well informed about anything, whether it&rsquo;s healthcare, or any kind of purchasing decisions,</p>
<p>or just life in general in this world?</p>
<p>Oh, information, you know, it varies hugely. I mean, there&rsquo;s more information at your</p>
<p>fingertips than ever before in history. The trouble is, first of all, that some of that</p>
<p>information isn&rsquo;t true. So it&rsquo;s really hard. And then some of it is just too hard to understand.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m buying a car, I can actually probably do a pretty good job of looking up, you know,</p>
<p>going to consumer reports, reviews, you can get a pretty good idea of what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>when you get a car. If I&rsquo;m going in for surgery, first of all, you know, fairly often it happens</p>
<p>without your being able to plan it. But also, there&rsquo;s a, you know, medical school takes</p>
<p>many, many years, and going on the internet for some advice is not usually a very good</p>
<p>substitute.</p>
<p>So speaking about news and not being able to trust certain sources of information,</p>
<p>how much disagreement is there about, I mentioned utopia, perfection in the beginning, but how much</p>
<p>disagreement is there about what utopia looks like? Or is most of the disagreement simply about the</p>
<p>path to get there?</p>
<p>Oh, I think there&rsquo;s two levels of disagreement. One, maybe not utopia, but justice. You know,</p>
<p>what is a just society? And that&rsquo;s, there are different views. I mean, I teach my students</p>
<p>that there are, you know, broadly speaking, two views of justice. One focuses on outcomes.</p>
<p>You ask yourself, a just society is the one you would choose if you were trying to,</p>
<p>the one that you would choose to live in if you didn&rsquo;t know who you were going to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of John Rawls. And the other focuses on process, that a just society is one in which</p>
<p>there is no coercion except where absolutely necessary. And there&rsquo;s no objective way to choose</p>
<p>between those. I&rsquo;m pretty much a Rawlsian, and I think many people are. But anyway, so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legitimate dispute about what we mean by a just society anyway. But then there&rsquo;s also a lot of</p>
<p>a lot of dispute about what actually works. There&rsquo;s a range of legitimate dispute. I mean, any</p>
<p>card carrying economist will say that incentives matter, but how much do they matter? How much does</p>
<p>a higher tax rate actually deter people from working? How much does a stronger safety net</p>
<p>actually lead people to get lazy? I have a pretty strong view that the evidence points to conclusions</p>
<p>that are considerably to the left of where most of our politicians are. But there is legitimate</p>
<p>room for disagreement on those things. So you&rsquo;ve mentioned outcomes. What are some metrics you</p>
<p>think about that you keep in mind, like the Gini coefficient, but really anything that measures</p>
<p>how good we&rsquo;re doing, whatever we&rsquo;re trying to do? What are the metrics you keep an eye on?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m actually I&rsquo;m not a fan of the Gini coefficient, not because what is the Gini</p>
<p>coefficient? Yeah, the Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, and it is commonly used</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a single number. It usually tracks with other measures, but the trouble is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no sort of natural interpretation of it. If you ask me what does a society with a Gini of 0.45</p>
<p>look like as opposed to a society with a Gini of 0.25? And I can kind of tell you, you know,</p>
<p>when 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is Brazil, but there&rsquo;s no sort of easy way to do that mapping.</p>
<p>I mean, I look at things like what is, first of all, things like what is the income of the</p>
<p>median family? What is the income of the top 1%? How many people are in poverty by</p>
<p>various measures of poverty? And then I think you want to look at questions like</p>
<p>how healthy are people? How is life expectancy doing? And how satisfied are people with their</p>
<p>lives? Because there is that sounds like a squishy number, not so much happiness. It</p>
<p>turns out that life satisfaction is a better measure than happiness. But life satisfaction,</p>
<p>that varies quite a lot. And I think it&rsquo;s meaningful, if not too rigorous to say, look,</p>
<p>according to polling, people in Denmark are pretty satisfied with their lives and</p>
<p>people in the United States, not so much so. And of course, Sweden wins every time.</p>
<p>No, actually Denmark wins these days. Denmark and Norway tend to win these days. Sweden doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>badly. None of these are perfect. But look, I think by and large, there&rsquo;s a bit of a</p>
<p>pornography test. How do you know a decent society? Well, you kind of know it when you see it.</p>
<p>Right. Where does America stand on that?</p>
<p>We have a remarkable&hellip; There are a lot of virtues to America, but there&rsquo;s a level of harshness,</p>
<p>brutality, an ability for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge, that is really,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be happening in a country as rich as ours. So we have somehow managed to produce a</p>
<p>a crueller society than almost any other wealthy country for no good reason.</p>
<p>What do you think is lacking in the safety net that the United States provides? You said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a harshness to it. And what are the benefits and maybe limits of a safety net</p>
<p>in a country like ours? Well, every other advanced country has some</p>
<p>universal guarantee of adequate healthcare. The United States is the only place where</p>
<p>citizens can actually fail to get basic healthcare because they can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to do. Everybody else does it, but we don&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve gotten a little bit better at it</p>
<p>than we were, but still, that&rsquo;s a big deal. We have remarkably weak support for children.</p>
<p>Most countries have substantial safety&hellip; Parents of young children get much more support elsewhere.</p>
<p>They get often nothing in the US. We have limited care for people. Long term care for the elderly</p>
<p>is a very hit and miss thing. But I think that the really big issues are that we don&rsquo;t take care of</p>
<p>children who make the mistake of having the wrong parents, and we don&rsquo;t take care of people who make</p>
<p>the mistake of getting sick. And those are things that a rich country should be doing.</p>
<p>Sorry for sort of a difficult question, but what you just said kind of feels like the right thing</p>
<p>to do in terms of a just society. But is it also good for the economic health of society to take</p>
<p>care of the people who are the unfortunate members of society?</p>
<p>By and large, it looks like doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the right thing in</p>
<p>terms of economics. If we&rsquo;re talking about a society that has extremely high tax rates that</p>
<p>deter, remove all incentives to provide a safety net that is so generous that why bother working</p>
<p>or striving, that could be a problem. But I don&rsquo;t actually know any society that looks like that.</p>
<p>Even in European countries with very generous safety nets, people work and innovate and do all</p>
<p>of these things. And there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence now that lacking those basics is actually destructive,</p>
<p>that children who grow up without adequate health care, without adequate nutrition,</p>
<p>are developmentally challenged. They don&rsquo;t live up to their potential as adults. So the United</p>
<p>States actually probably pays a price. We&rsquo;re harsh, we&rsquo;re cruel, and we actually make ourselves poorer</p>
<p>as a society, not just the individuals, by being so harsh and cruel.</p>
<p>Okay, so Invisible Hand, Smith, where does that fit in? The power of just people acting selfishly</p>
<p>and somehow everything taking care of itself to where the economy grows,</p>
<p>nobody, there&rsquo;s no cruelty, no injustice, that the markets regulate themselves. Is there power</p>
<p>to that idea and what are its limits? There&rsquo;s a lot of power to that. I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think sensible people want the government running steel mills or they want the government</p>
<p>to own the farms, right? The markets are a pretty effective way of getting incentives aligned,</p>
<p>of inducing people to do stuff that works. And the Invisible Hand is saying that farmers aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>growing crops because they want to feed people, they&rsquo;re growing crops because they can make money</p>
<p>by it, but it actually turns out to be a pretty good way of getting an agrarian</p>
<p>of getting agricultural products grown. So the Invisible Hand is an important part,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing mystical about it. It&rsquo;s a mechanism, it&rsquo;s a way to organize economic</p>
<p>activity, which works well given a bunch of preconditions, which means that it actually</p>
<p>works well for agriculture, it works well for manufacturing, it works well for many services,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work well for healthcare, it doesn&rsquo;t work well for education. So having a society</p>
<p>which is kind of three quarters Invisible Hand and one quarter Visible Hand, something on that</p>
<p>order seems to be the balance that works best. You don&rsquo;t want to romanticize or make something</p>
<p>mystical out of it. This is one way to organize stuff that happens to have broad but not universal</p>
<p>application. So then forgive me for romanticizing it, but it does seem pretty magical. I kind of</p>
<p>have an intuitive understanding of what happens when you have like five, ten, maybe even a hundred</p>
<p>people together, the dynamics of that. But the fact that these large society of people for the</p>
<p>most part acting in a self interested way and maybe electing representatives for themselves,</p>
<p>that it all kind of seems to work, it&rsquo;s pretty magical. The fact that right now there&rsquo;s a wide</p>
<p>assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables in the local markets up and down the street, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>planning that? And the answer is nobody. That&rsquo;s the Invisible Hand at work and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lesson that Adam Smith figured out more than 200 years ago and it continues to apply.</p>
<p>But even Adam Smith has a section in his book about why it&rsquo;s important to regulate banks.</p>
<p>So the Invisible Hand has its limits. And that example is actually a powerful one in terms of</p>
<p>the supermarket and fruit. That was my experience coming from Russia from the Soviet Union is when</p>
<p>I first entered a supermarket and just seeing the assortment of fruit, bananas. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen bananas before, first of all, but just the selection of fresh fruit was just mind blowing.</p>
<p>Beyond words and the fact that, like you said, I don&rsquo;t know what made that happen.</p>
<p>Well, there is some magic to the market. As showing my age, but the old movie quote,</p>
<p>sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. And you have to have some idea of when</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t. So how do you get regulation? What can government at its best do? Government,</p>
<p>strangely enough in this country today, seems to get a bad rap. Everybody&rsquo;s against the government.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, a lot of money has been spent on making people hate the government.</p>
<p>But the reality is government does some things pretty well. I mean, government does health</p>
<p>insurance pretty well. So much so, I mean, given our anti government bias, it really is true that</p>
<p>there are people out there saying, don&rsquo;t let the government get its hands on Medicare. So</p>
<p>people actually love the government health insurance program far more than they love</p>
<p>private health insurance. Basic education. It turns out that your local public high school</p>
<p>is the right place to have students trained and private for, certainly for profit education is</p>
<p>by and large a nightmare of rip offs and grift and people not getting what they thought they</p>
<p>were paying for. It&rsquo;s a judgment case. And it&rsquo;s funny, there are things, I mean, everybody talks</p>
<p>about the DMV as being, do you want the economy? Actually, my experience is that the DMV have</p>
<p>always been positive. Maybe I&rsquo;m just going to the right DMVs, but in fact, a lot of government works</p>
<p>pretty well. So to some extent, you can do these things on a priori grounds. You can talk about the</p>
<p>logic of why healthcare is not going to be handled well by the market, but partly it&rsquo;s just experience.</p>
<p>We tried, or at least some countries have tried nationalizing their steel industries,</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t go well. But we&rsquo;ve tried privatizing education and that didn&rsquo;t go well. So you find</p>
<p>out what works. What about this new world of tech? How do you see, what do you think works for tech?</p>
<p>Is it more regulation or less regulation? There are some things that need more regulation. I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re finding out that the world of social media is one in which competitive forces aren&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>very well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn&rsquo;t working very well. But I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>whole a tech skeptic, not in the sense that I think the tech doesn&rsquo;t work and it doesn&rsquo;t do stuff,</p>
<p>but the idea that we&rsquo;re living through greater technological change than ever before</p>
<p>is really an illusion. Ever since the beginning of the industrial revolution,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a series of epical shifts in the nature of work and in the kinds of jobs that are available.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not at all clear that what&rsquo;s happening now is any bigger or faster or harder to cope</p>
<p>with than past shocks. It is a popular notion in today&rsquo;s sort of public discourse that automation</p>
<p>is going to have a huge impact on the job market now. There is something transformational happening</p>
<p>now. Can you talk about that, maybe elaborate a little bit more? Do you not see the software</p>
<p>revolutions happening now with machine learning, availability of data, that kind of automation,</p>
<p>being able to sort of process, clean, find patterns in data, and you don&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>disrupting any one sector to a point where there&rsquo;s a huge loss of jobs? There may be some things. I</p>
<p>mean, actually, you know, translators, there&rsquo;s really reduced demand for translators because</p>
<p>machine translation ain&rsquo;t perfect, but it ain&rsquo;t bad. There are some kinds of things that are</p>
<p>changed, but overall productivity growth has actually been slow in recent years. It&rsquo;s been much</p>
<p>slower than in some past periods. So the idea that automation is taking away all the jobs,</p>
<p>the counterpart would be that we would be able to produce stuff with many fewer workers than before,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not happening. There are a few isolated sectors. There are some kinds of jobs that are</p>
<p>going away, but that keeps on happening. I mean, New York City used to have thousands and thousands</p>
<p>of longshoremen taking stuff off ships and putting them on ships. They&rsquo;re almost all gone now. Now</p>
<p>you have the giant cranes taking containers on and off ships in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not robots. It doesn&rsquo;t sound high tech, but it actually pretty much destroyed an</p>
<p>occupation. Well, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t fun for the longshoremen, to say the least. But it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>we coped, we moved on, and that sort of thing happens all the time. You mean farmers.</p>
<p>We used to be a nation which was mostly farmers. There are now very few farmers left. And the</p>
<p>reason is not that we&rsquo;ve stopped eating, it&rsquo;s that farming has become so efficient that we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>a lot of farmers, and we coped with that too. So the idea that there&rsquo;s something qualitatively</p>
<p>different about what&rsquo;s happening now so far isn&rsquo;t true. So your intuition is there is going to be</p>
<p>lots of jobs, but it&rsquo;s just the thing that just continues. There&rsquo;s nothing qualitatively different</p>
<p>about this moment. Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, as has always been the case so</p>
<p>far. I mean, maybe there&rsquo;s a singularity. Maybe there&rsquo;s a moment when the machines get smarter</p>
<p>than we are, and sky tech kills us all or something, right? But that&rsquo;s not visible in</p>
<p>anything we&rsquo;re seeing now. You mentioned the metric of productivity. Could you explain that</p>
<p>a little bit? Because it&rsquo;s a really interesting one. I&rsquo;ve heard you mention that before in</p>
<p>connection with automation. So what is that metric? And if there is something qualitatively</p>
<p>different, what should we see in that metric? Well, okay, productivity. First of all, production.</p>
<p>We do have a measure of the economy&rsquo;s total production, you know, real GDP, which is</p>
<p>itself, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a construct because it&rsquo;s quite literally, it&rsquo;s adding apples and</p>
<p>oranges. So we have to add together various things, which we basically do by using market prices,</p>
<p>but we try to adjust for inflation. But it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s a reasonable measure of how much</p>
<p>the economy is producing. Sorry to interrupt. Is it goods and services? It&rsquo;s goods and services.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything. Okay. Productivity is, you divide that total output by the number of hours worked.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically asking how much stuff does the average worker produce in an hour of work.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re seeing really rapid technological progress, then you&rsquo;d expect to see productivity</p>
<p>rising at a rapid clip, which we did, you know, for the generation after World War II, productivity</p>
<p>rose, you know, 2% a year on a sustained basis. Then it dropped down for a while. Then there was</p>
<p>a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid nineties to the mid two thousands.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s, it dropped off again and it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not impressive right now. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just not seeing an epical shift in, in, in the economy. So let me then ask you about</p>
<p>the psychology of blaming automation. A few months ago, you wrote in the New York Times,</p>
<p>quote, the other day I found myself, as I often do at a conference, discussing lagging wages and</p>
<p>soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion, but one thing that struck me was how</p>
<p>many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem, that machines are</p>
<p>taking away the good jobs or even jobs in general. For the most part, this wasn&rsquo;t even presented as</p>
<p>a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows. So why is, maybe can you psychoanalyze our,</p>
<p>the public intellectuals or economists or us actually in the general public, why this is</p>
<p>happening? Why this assumption has just infiltrated public discourse? There&rsquo;s a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot more visible</p>
<p>to the chattering class. When containerization did away with the jobs of longshoremen, well,</p>
<p>not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with longshoremen. And so we see this one.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a second thing, which is, we just went through a severe financial crisis</p>
<p>and a period of very high unemployment. It&rsquo;s finally come down. There&rsquo;s really no question</p>
<p>that that high unemployment was about macroeconomics. It was about a failure of demand.</p>
<p>But macroeconomics is really not intuitive. I mean, people just have a hard time wrapping</p>
<p>their minds around it. And among other things, people have a hard time believing that something</p>
<p>as trivial as, well, people who just aren&rsquo;t spending enough can lead to the kind of mass</p>
<p>misery that we saw in the 1930s or the not quite so severe, but still serious misery that we saw</p>
<p>after 2008. And there&rsquo;s always a tendency to say it must be something big. It must be technological</p>
<p>change. That means we don&rsquo;t need workers anymore. There was a lot of that in the 30s. And that same</p>
<p>thing happened after 2008, the assumption that it has to be some deep cause, not something as trivial</p>
<p>as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response.</p>
<p>And the last thing on wages. A lot of what&rsquo;s happened on wages is at some level political.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the collapse of the union movement. It&rsquo;s policies that have squeezed workers bargaining</p>
<p>power. And for kind of obvious reasons, there are a lot of influential people who don&rsquo;t want to hear</p>
<p>that story. They want it to be an inevitable force of nature. Technology has made it impossible to</p>
<p>have people earn middle class wages. And so they don&rsquo;t like the story that says,</p>
<p>actually, no, it&rsquo;s kind of the political decisions that we made that have caused this income</p>
<p>stagnation. And so they&rsquo;re a receptive audience for technological determinism.</p>
<p>LW. So what comes first in your view, the economy or politics in terms of what has impact on the</p>
<p>other?</p>
<p>RL. Oh, look, everything interacts. That&rsquo;s one of the rules that I was taught in economics.</p>
<p>Everything affects everything else in at least two ways. I mean, clearly the economy drives a</p>
<p>lot of political stuff. But also clearly politics has a huge impact on the economy. We look at the</p>
<p>decline of unions in America and say, well, the world has changed and unions don&rsquo;t have a role.</p>
<p>But two thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized. And Denmark has the same technology</p>
<p>and faces the same global economy that we do. It&rsquo;s just a difference in political choices that leads</p>
<p>to that difference. So I actually teach a course here at CUNY called Economics of the Welfare</p>
<p>State, which is about things like healthcare and retirement and to some extent wage policy and so</p>
<p>on. And the message I keep on trying to drive home is that, look, all advanced countries have</p>
<p>got roughly equal competence. We all have the same technology, but we make very different choices.</p>
<p>Not that America always makes the wrong choices. We do some things pretty well. Our retirement</p>
<p>system is one of the better ones. But the point is that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of political choice</p>
<p>involved in the shape of the economy. What is a welfare state? Well, welfare state is the old</p>
<p>term, but it basically refers to all the programs that are there to mitigate, if you like, the</p>
<p>risks and injustices of the market economy. So in the US, the welfare state is Social Security,</p>
<p>Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wages, food stamps. When you say welfare state, my first sort of</p>
<p>feeling is a negative one. Even though I like all, I probably generally, at least theoretically,</p>
<p>like all the welfare programs. Well, it&rsquo;s been demonized. And to some extent, I&rsquo;m doing a little</p>
<p>bit of thumbing my nose at all of that by just using the term welfare state. Although it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I see. Yeah, I got you. But everybody, every advanced country actually has a lot of welfare</p>
<p>state, even the US. I mean, that&rsquo;s a fundamental part of the fabric of our society. Social Security,</p>
<p>Medicare, Medicaid are just things we take for granted as part of the scene. There&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people on the right wing who are saying, oh, it&rsquo;s all socialism. And well,</p>
<p>words, I guess, mean what you want them to mean. And just today, I told my class about the</p>
<p>record that Ronald Reagan made in 1961, warning that Medicare would destroy American freedom.</p>
<p>And but that sort of didn&rsquo;t happen on the topic of welfare state. What are your thoughts on</p>
<p>universal basic income? And that&rsquo;s sort of a not a generic, but a universal safety net of this kind?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a trade off when we talk about social safety net programs. There&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>trade off between universality, which is clean, but means that you&rsquo;re giving a lot of money to</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t necessarily need it and some kind of targeting, which makes it easier to</p>
<p>get to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources. But both has incentive</p>
<p>problems and kind of political and I would say even psychological issues. So the great thing</p>
<p>about Social Security and Medicare is no questions asked. You don&rsquo;t have to prove that you need them.</p>
<p>It just comes. I&rsquo;m on Medicare, allegedly. I mean, it&rsquo;s run through my New York Times health</p>
<p>insurance, but I didn&rsquo;t have to file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed it.</p>
<p>It just happened when I turned 65. That&rsquo;s good for dignity and it&rsquo;s also good for</p>
<p>the political support because everybody gets Medicare. On the other hand, if you</p>
<p>and we can do that with health care to give everybody a guarantee of an income that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enough to live on comfortably. That&rsquo;s a lot of money. What about enough income to carry you over</p>
<p>through difficult periods, like if you lose a job or that kind of? Well, we have unemployment</p>
<p>insurance and I think our unemployment insurance is too short lived and too stingy. It would be</p>
<p>better to have a more comprehensive unemployment insurance benefit. But the trouble with something</p>
<p>like universal basic income is that either the bar is too low, so it&rsquo;s really not something you</p>
<p>can live on, or it&rsquo;s an enormously expensive program. And so at this point, I think that</p>
<p>we can do far better by building on the kinds of safety net programs we have. I mean, food stamps,</p>
<p>earned income tax credit. We should have a lot more family support policies.</p>
<p>Those things can do a lot more to really diminish the amount of misery in this country.</p>
<p>UBI is something that is being&hellip; I mean, it goes kind of hand in hand with this belief that</p>
<p>the robots are going to take all of our jobs. And if that was really happening, then I might</p>
<p>reconsider my views on UPI, but I don&rsquo;t see that happening. So are you happy with discourse that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now in terms of politics? So you mentioned a few political candidates. Is the kind of thing</p>
<p>going on both on Twitter and debates and the media through the written word, through the spoken word,</p>
<p>how do you assess the public discourse now in terms of politics? We&rsquo;re in a fragmented world.</p>
<p>More so than before.</p>
<p>More so than ever before. So at this point, the public discourse that you see if Fox News is your</p>
<p>principal news source is very different from the one you get if you read the New York Times.</p>
<p>On the whole, my sense is that mainstream political reporting, policy reporting is a,</p>
<p>not too great, but b, better than it&rsquo;s ever been. Because when I first got into the pundit business,</p>
<p>it was just awful. Lots of things just never got covered. And if things did get covered,</p>
<p>it was always both sides. It&rsquo;s the line that comes back from me writing during the 2000</p>
<p>campaign was that if one of the candidates said that the earth was flat, the headline would</p>
<p>be views differ on shape of planet. I mean, that&rsquo;s less true. There&rsquo;s still a fair bit of</p>
<p>that out there, but it&rsquo;s less true than there used to be. And there are more people reporting,</p>
<p>writing on policy issues who actually understand them than ever before. So though that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But still, how much the typical voter is actually informed is unclear. I mean, the Democratic</p>
<p>debates, I&rsquo;m hoping that we finally get down to not having 27 people on the stage or whatever it</p>
<p>is they have, but they&rsquo;re reasonably substantive, certainly better than before. And while there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of still theater criticism instead of actual analysis and the reporting, it&rsquo;s not as totally</p>
<p>dominant as in the past. Can I ask maybe a dumb question, but from an open minded perspective,</p>
<p>when people on the left and people on the right, I think view the others as sometimes complete</p>
<p>idiots. What do we do with that? Is it possible that the people on the right are correct about</p>
<p>their what they currently believe? Is that kind of open mindedness helpful or is this division</p>
<p>long term productive for us to sort of have this food fight?</p>
<p>Well, the trouble you have to confront is that there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that just is false out</p>
<p>there but commands extensive political allegiance. So the idea, well, both sides need to listen to</p>
<p>each other respectfully. I&rsquo;m happy to do that when there&rsquo;s a view that is worthy of respect,</p>
<p>but a lot of stuff is not. And so take economics is something where I think I know something,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;m always right. In fact, I know I&rsquo;ve been wrong plenty of times. But I</p>
<p>think that there is a difference between economic views that are within the realm of we can actually</p>
<p>have an interesting discussion and those that are just crank doctrines or things that are purely</p>
<p>being disseminated because people are being paid to disseminate them. So there are plenty of good,</p>
<p>serious center right economists that I&rsquo;m happy to talk to. None of those center right economists</p>
<p>has any role in the Trump administration. The Trump administration and by and large Republicans</p>
<p>in Congress only want to listen to people who are cranks. And so I think it&rsquo;s being dishonest with</p>
<p>my readers to pretend otherwise. There&rsquo;s no way I can reach out to people who think that</p>
<p>reading Ayn Rand novels is how you learn about monetary economics.</p>
<p>Let me linger on that point. So if you look at Ayn Rand, okay, so you said center right. What</p>
<p>about extreme? People who have like radical views, you think they&rsquo;re not grounded in any kind of data,</p>
<p>in any kind of reality. I&rsquo;m just sort of curious about how open we should be</p>
<p>to ideas that seem radical. Oh, radical ideas is fine, but then you have to ask, is there some</p>
<p>basis for the radicalism? And if it&rsquo;s something that is not grounded in anything,</p>
<p>then, and particularly, by the way, if it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been refuted by evidence again</p>
<p>and again, and the people just keep saying it, if it&rsquo;s a zombie, if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>zombie idea, and there&rsquo;s a lot of those out there, then there comes a point when it&rsquo;s not worth</p>
<p>trying to fake respect for it. I see. So there&rsquo;s a, through the scientific process,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve shown that this idea does not hold water, but I like the idea of zombie ideas,</p>
<p>but they live on through, it&rsquo;s like the idea that the earth is flat, for example,</p>
<p>has been for the most part, disproven. Yeah.</p>
<p>But it lives on, actually, and growing in popularity currently. Yeah. And there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of that out there, and you can&rsquo;t wish it away, and you&rsquo;re not being fair to either yourself,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re somebody who writes for the public, you&rsquo;re not being fair to your readers to pretend</p>
<p>otherwise. So quantum mechanics is a strange theory, but it&rsquo;s testable, and so while being</p>
<p>strange, it&rsquo;s widely accepted amongst physicists. How robust and testable are economics theories</p>
<p>if we compare them to quantum mechanics and physics and so on? Okay, economics, look, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>complex system, and it&rsquo;s also one in which, by and large, you don&rsquo;t get to do experiments,</p>
<p>and so economics is never going to be like quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>That said, you get natural experiments, you get tests of rival doctrines. In the immediate</p>
<p>aftermath of the financial crisis, there was one style, one basic theory of macroeconomics, which</p>
<p>ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions. It said, under these</p>
<p>circumstances, the economy is going to collapse. It&rsquo;s going to collapse. It&rsquo;s going to collapse.</p>
<p>Printing money will not be inflationary. Running big budget deficits will not cause a rise in</p>
<p>interest rates. Slashing government spending austerity policies will lead to depressions if</p>
<p>tried. Other people had exactly the opposite predictions, and we got a fairly robust test,</p>
<p>and one theory won. Interest rates stayed low. Inflation stayed low. Austerity, countries that</p>
<p>implemented harsh austerity policies suffered severe economic downturns. You don&rsquo;t get much,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s pretty clear, and that&rsquo;s not going to be true on everything,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of empirical. I mean, the younger economists these days are very heavily</p>
<p>data based, and that&rsquo;s great, and I think that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie What theories of economics are there? Is there currently a lot of disagreement about, would you say?</p>
<p>John Ligato Oh, first of all, there&rsquo;s just a lot less disagreement, really, among serious</p>
<p>researchers in economics than people imagine. We actually, we can track that. The Chicago Booth</p>
<p>School has a panel, an ideologically diverse panel, and they pose regularly posed questions,</p>
<p>and on most things, there&rsquo;s a huge, there&rsquo;s remarkable consensus. There&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>where people imagine that there&rsquo;s dispute, but the illusion of dispute is something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically being fed by political forces, and there isn&rsquo;t really. I mean, there are, I think,</p>
<p>questions about what are effective ways to regulate technology industries. We really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the answers there. There&rsquo;s a, or, look, I don&rsquo;t follow every part. Minimum wages. I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty overwhelming evidence that a modest increase in the minimum wage from current levels</p>
<p>would be, would not have any noticeable adverse effect on jobs. But if you ask, how high could it</p>
<p>go? $12 seems pretty safe, given what we know. Is $15 okay? There&rsquo;s some legitimate disagreement</p>
<p>there, I think probably, but people have a point. $20, where is the line at which it starts to</p>
<p>become a problem, and the answer is, truly, we don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s fascinating to try to,</p>
<p>such a cool, economics is cool in that sense, because you&rsquo;re trying to predict something that</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been done before, the impact, the effects of something that hasn&rsquo;t been done before.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re trying, you&rsquo;re going out of sample, and we have good reason to believe that there are,</p>
<p>you know, that it&rsquo;s nonlinear, that there comes a point at which it doesn&rsquo;t work the way it has</p>
<p>in the past. So, as an economist, how do you see science and technological innovation? When I</p>
<p>took various economics courses in college, technological innovation seemed like a</p>
<p>no brainer way of growing an economy, and we should invest in it aggressively. I may be biased,</p>
<p>but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy, it seems like the easiest way,</p>
<p>especially long term. Is that correct? And if so, why aren&rsquo;t we doing it more?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, okay, the first question is, yeah, I mean, all, it&rsquo;s pretty much overwhelming.</p>
<p>We think we can more or less measure this, although there are some assumptions involved,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something like 70 to 80% of the growth in per capita income is basically the advance</p>
<p>of knowledge. It&rsquo;s not just, it&rsquo;s not just the crude accumulation of capital. It is the fact</p>
<p>that we get smarter. A lot of that, by the way, is more prosaic kinds of technology. So, you know,</p>
<p>I like to talk about things like containerization, or, you know, in an earlier period,</p>
<p>the invention of the flat pack cardboard box. That had to be invented, and now all of your</p>
<p>deliveries from Amazon are made possible by the existence of that technology. The web stuff is</p>
<p>important too, but what would we do without cardboard boxes?</p>
<p>But all of that stuff is really important in driving economic progress. Well, why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>invest more? Why don&rsquo;t we invest more in, again, more prosaic stuff? Why haven&rsquo;t we built another</p>
<p>goddamn rail tunnel under the Hudson River, for which the need is so totally overwhelmingly</p>
<p>obvious? How do you think about, first of all, I don&rsquo;t even know what the word prosaic means,</p>
<p>but I inferred it, but how do you think about prosaic? Is it the really most basic, dumb</p>
<p>technology innovation, or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of where benefit can be</p>
<p>gained? When I say prosaic, I mean stuff that is not sexy and fancy and high tech. It&rsquo;s building</p>
<p>bridges and tunnels, inventing the cardboard box, or the, I don&rsquo;t know, where do we put</p>
<p>EasyPass in there? It is actually using some modern technology and all that, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to have, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to make a movie about the guy, whoever it was that invented</p>
<p>EasyPass, but it&rsquo;s actually a pretty significant productivity booster. To me, it always seemed like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that everybody should be able to agree on and just invest. So in the same way,</p>
<p>the investment in the military and the DOD is huge. So everyone kind of, not everyone, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an agreement amongst people that somehow that a large defense is important. It always</p>
<p>seemed to me like that should be shifted towards, if you want to grow prosperity of the nation,</p>
<p>you should be investing in knowledge. Yes, prosaic stuff, investing in infrastructure and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, sorry to linger on it, but do you have any intuition? Do you have a hope that that changes?</p>
<p>Do you have intuition why it&rsquo;s not changing? It&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>More than intuition, I have a theory. I&rsquo;m reasonably certain that I understand why</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do it. And it&rsquo;s because we have a real values dispute about the welfare state,</p>
<p>about how much the government should do to help the unfortunate. And politicians believe,</p>
<p>probably rightly, that there&rsquo;s a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind of government</p>
<p>intervention. That even though providing people with enhanced social security benefits is really</p>
<p>very different from building a tunnel under the Hudson River, politicians of both parties seem</p>
<p>to believe that if the government is seen to be successful at doing one kind of thing,</p>
<p>it will make people think more favorably on doing other kinds of things. And so we have</p>
<p>conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spending, except military,</p>
<p>no matter how obviously a good idea it is, because they fear that it&rsquo;s the thin end of</p>
<p>the wedge for bigger government in general. And to some extent, liberals tend to favor</p>
<p>spending on these things, partly because they see it as a way of proving that government can</p>
<p>do things well, and therefore it can turn to broader social goals. What you might have thought</p>
<p>would be a technocratic discussion about government investment, both in research and</p>
<p>in infrastructure, is contaminated by the fact that government is government and people link it</p>
<p>to other government actions. Perhaps a silly question, but as a species, we&rsquo;re currently</p>
<p>working on venturing out into space, one day colonizing Mars. So when we start a society</p>
<p>on Mars from scratch, what political and economic system should it operate under?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a big believer in&hellip; First of all, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re actually going to do that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s hypothesize that we colonize Mars or something. Look, representative democracy</p>
<p>versus pure democracy. Well, yeah, pure democracy where people vote directly on everything is really</p>
<p>problematic, because people don&rsquo;t have time to try and master every issue. I mean, we can see</p>
<p>what government by referendum looks like. There&rsquo;s a lot of that in California, and it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so good because it&rsquo;s hard to explain to people that the various things they vote for may conflict.</p>
<p>So representative democracy, it&rsquo;s got lots of problems. And kind of the Winston Churchill thing,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s the worst system we know, except for all the others. So yeah, sticking with the</p>
<p>representative and basically the American system of regulation and markets and the economy we have</p>
<p>going on is a pretty good one for Mars. If you start from scratch. If you&rsquo;re gonna start from</p>
<p>scratch, you wouldn&rsquo;t want a Senate where 16% of the population has half the seats.</p>
<p>You probably would want one which is actually more representative than what we have.</p>
<p>And the details, it&rsquo;s unclear. When times are good, all of the various representative</p>
<p>democracy systems, whether it&rsquo;s parliamentary democracies or a US style system, whether you</p>
<p>have a prime minister or the head of state as an elected president, they all kind of work well,</p>
<p>when times are good, and they all have different modes of breakdown. So I&rsquo;m not sure I know what</p>
<p>the answer is. But something like that is given what we&rsquo;ve seen through history, it&rsquo;s the least</p>
<p>bad system out there. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the TV series The Expanse, and it&rsquo;s kind of gratifying</p>
<p>that out there, it&rsquo;s the Martian Congressional Republic. In a brief sense, so amongst many things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also an expert at international trade. What do you make of the complexity? So I can</p>
<p>understand trade between two people, say two neighboring farmers. It seems pretty straightforward</p>
<p>to me. But internationally, we need to start talking about nations and nations trading seems</p>
<p>to be very complicated. So from a high level, why is it so complicated? What are all the different</p>
<p>factors that weigh the objectives that need to be considered in international trade? And maybe</p>
<p>feeding that into a question of, do you have concerns about the two giants right now of the</p>
<p>U.S. and China, and the tension that&rsquo;s going on with the international trade there with the trade</p>
<p>war? Well, first of all, international trade is not really that different from trade among</p>
<p>individuals. It&rsquo;s vastly more complex, and there are many more players. But in the end, the reasons</p>
<p>why countries trade are pretty much the same as the reasons why individuals trade. Countries trade</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re different, and they can derive mutual advantage from concentrating on the things</p>
<p>they do relatively well. And also, there are economies of scale. Individuals have to decide</p>
<p>whether to be a surgeon or an accountant. It&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to try and be both,</p>
<p>and countries benefit from specializing just because of the inherent advantages of specialization.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that it&rsquo;s a big world, and we&rsquo;re talking about millions of products being traded,</p>
<p>and in today&rsquo;s world, often trade involves many stages. So that made in China iPhone is actually</p>
<p>assembled from components that are made all over the world. But it doesn&rsquo;t really change the</p>
<p>fundamentals all that much. There&rsquo;s a recurrent&hellip; I mean, the dirty little secret of international</p>
<p>trade conflict is that actually it&rsquo;s not&hellip; Conflicts among countries are really not that</p>
<p>important. Most trade is beneficial to both sides and to both countries, but it has big impacts on</p>
<p>the distribution of income within countries. So the growth of US trade with China has made both</p>
<p>US and China richer, but it&rsquo;s been pretty bad for people who were employed in the North Carolina</p>
<p>furniture industry, who did find that their jobs were displaced by a wave of imports from China.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where the complexity comes in. Not at all clear to me. We have some real problems</p>
<p>with China, although they don&rsquo;t really involve trade so much as things like respect for intellectual</p>
<p>property. Not clear that those real problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the</p>
<p>current trade war. The current trade war seems to be driven instead by a fundamentally wrong notion</p>
<p>that when we sell goods to China, that&rsquo;s good, and when we buy goods from China, that&rsquo;s bad. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s misunderstanding the whole point. Is trade with China in both directions a good thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, we would be poorer if it wasn&rsquo;t for it. But there are downsides, as there are for any economic</p>
<p>change. It&rsquo;s like any new technology makes us richer, but often hurts some people. Trade with</p>
<p>China makes us richer, but hurts some people. And I wouldn&rsquo;t undo what has happened, but I wish we</p>
<p>had had a better policy for supporting and compensating the losers from that growth.</p>
<p>So we live in a time of radicalization of political ideas, Twitter mobs, and so on.</p>
<p>And yet here you are in the midst of it, both tweeting and writing in the New York Times articles</p>
<p>with strong opinions, riding this chaotic wave of public discourse. Do you ever hesitate or feel</p>
<p>a tinge of fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically?</p>
<p>Oh, I feel fear all the time. It&rsquo;s not too hard to imagine scenarios in which this is going to,</p>
<p>you know, I might personally find myself kind of in the crosshairs. And I mean, I am the</p>
<p>king of hate mail. I get amazing correspondence. Does it affect you?</p>
<p>It did. It did when it started. These days I&rsquo;ve developed a very thick skin.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t usually get, in fact, if I don&rsquo;t get a wave of hate mail after a column, then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably wasted that day.</p>
<p>So what do you make of that as a person who&rsquo;s putting ideas out there? If you look at the</p>
<p>history of ideas, the way it works is you write about ideas, you put them out there. But now</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so much hate mail, so much division, what advice do you have for yourself and for</p>
<p>others trying to have a discussion about ideas, difficult ideas?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about advice for others. I mean, for most economists, you know, just</p>
<p>do your research. We can&rsquo;t all be public intellectuals and we shouldn&rsquo;t try to be.</p>
<p>And in fact, I&rsquo;m glad that I didn&rsquo;t get into this business until I was in my late 40s. I mean,</p>
<p>this is probably best to spend your decades of greatest intellectual flexibility addressing</p>
<p>deep questions, not confronting Twitter mobs. And as for the rest, I think when you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>about stuff, the answers like no one&rsquo;s watching, write like nobody&rsquo;s reading. Write what you think</p>
<p>is right. Trying to make it, obviously, trying to make it comprehensible and persuasive. But</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some people are going to say nasty things.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do your job if you are worried about criticism.</p>
<p>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that I hope that you keep dancing like</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s watching on Twitter and New York Times and books. So Paul, it&rsquo;s been an honor. Thank you</p>

<p>from Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, one of the most influential philosophers and economists</p>
<p>in our history. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we</p>
<p>expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their</p>
<p>humanity, but to their self love and never talk to them of our necessities, but of their advantages.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
