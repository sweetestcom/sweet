    <p>Hey guys, I got a little friend here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m going to start a new podcast.</p>
<p>Is that a bulldog?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to have a bulldog as my mascot.</p>
<p>You bought a bulldog?</p>
<p>Oh my god, you got my mascot!</p>
<p>Yeah, I took over your mascot.</p>
<p>Well look at that, now you&rsquo;re actually likable, Sax.</p>
<p>Sax, are you trying to improve your image?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was about to say,</p>
<p>Sax is so unlikable</p>
<p>that he has gotten a bulldog.</p>
<p>Oh my god, Sax, show me his face again.</p>
<p>Is it him or her?</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>His name is Moose.</p>

<p>The name of the other podcast is This Week in Startups.</p>
<p>Thanks for the free promo, guys.</p>
<p>It is a huge day today in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen a Black Swan</p>
<p>like event happen here in a long time</p>
<p>since 2008.</p>
<p>I thought the last time was when you published the book Angel.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>We have to get to work.</p>
<p>Chamath, save the jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give you a cold open.</p>
<p>We did that already. Okay, here we go. Three, two&hellip;</p>
<p>Rain Man David Sackett.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody. It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>36 hours here. We&rsquo;re going to get into</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank imploding.</p>
<p>The FDIC has shut down Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many different things we have to discuss</p>
<p>with me today. As always,</p>
<p>the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>the Rain Man David Sacks, and</p>
<p>the prince of panic attacks no more.</p>
<p>His wires cleared, David Freeberg,</p>
<p>the sultan of science. Welcome, boys.</p>
<p>How is everybody, just to</p>
<p>start this off, contextually,</p>
<p>the last 24 hours,</p>
<p>can you recall a time</p>
<p>in our careers where it&rsquo;s felt</p>
<p>this acute or</p>
<p>insane or intense?</p>
<p>2008 and COVID.</p>
<p>Okay, and I think that this</p>
<p>is right up there. Could be two,</p>
<p>probably three, in terms of the</p>
<p>level of panic and concern. The problem</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re in the middle of it. We don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen this weekend, so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of anxiety right now, a lot of panic</p>
<p>going on. And a lot</p>
<p>of, like, unlike COVID and</p>
<p>08, really acute</p>
<p>effects that many companies</p>
<p>and investors are actively</p>
<p>dealing with right now, like not just a few,</p>
<p>thousands of companies</p>
<p>that are really in a state of, like, distress</p>
<p>right now. So it is</p>
<p>potentially, from a Silicon Valley perspective,</p>
<p>worse than 08 or COVID.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure. For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, this is basically a Lehman</p>
<p>sized event for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Remember when Lehman Brothers went out to</p>
<p>basically file for bankruptcy in 2008,</p>
<p>started the whole financial crisis.</p>
<p>The federal authorities thought</p>
<p>that the best plan</p>
<p>for Lehman was to file for bankruptcy. They</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t try to save it. And that basically</p>
<p>led to a cascade where the whole</p>
<p>financial system almost collapsed. I think</p>
<p>that SVB, this is a Lehman sized event</p>
<p>for Silicon Valley. And there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>big things happening. One is</p>
<p>the impact on the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>probably thousands of companies now</p>
<p>cannot make payroll in the next few weeks</p>
<p>because their money is trapped</p>
<p>and tied up at Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank, which is now under receivership.</p>
<p>So if you wired</p>
<p>your money out yesterday, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>And a lot of people managed to do that.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of people who</p>
<p>had wires in the hopper,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make it today,</p>
<p>logged into the website, can&rsquo;t log in.</p>
<p>Their money is just frozen.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be able to get their money out, or</p>
<p>how many cents of the dollar you&rsquo;re going to get.</p>
<p>So basically, the whole startup ecosystem</p>
<p>is in peril.</p>
<p>I think Gary Tan called it an&hellip; Extinction level</p>
<p>event. Yes, exactly. That was a good term.</p>
<p>And just to be really clear, this is</p>
<p>not big tech at risk. I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>out there who don&rsquo;t like the idea of bailing out</p>
<p>big tech. This is not Google.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Amazon. Exactly. Those companies have</p>
<p>plenty of cash. They&rsquo;re fine. This is small companies.</p>
<p>Companies with 10 to 100</p>
<p>employees. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at maybe thousands of them just</p>
<p>being wiped out for no reason.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong because of this.</p>
<p>This could have a very damaging effect</p>
<p>on the startup economy and the</p>
<p>whole United States economy. This is little</p>
<p>tech. These are the future</p>
<p>companies that will keep the United States</p>
<p>competitive versus</p>
<p>China and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And then the other big thing that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>and this is all happening in real time, is</p>
<p>a regional banking crisis.</p>
<p>Because when</p>
<p>depositors see that their money</p>
<p>was not safe at SVB, which</p>
<p>was a top 20 bank,</p>
<p>that, as far as everyone knows, was in regulatory</p>
<p>compliance. Nobody has said</p>
<p>that SVB wasn&rsquo;t compliant.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they had a regulator</p>
<p>deal of approval.</p>
<p>Now you find out your money</p>
<p>was not safe and it&rsquo;s not FDIC insured</p>
<p>above $250,000.</p>
<p>The conversations we&rsquo;re all seeing</p>
<p>in our chat groups with leading investors</p>
<p>is, why the hell would you keep</p>
<p>your money anywhere but</p>
<p>JP Morgan or a top four bank?</p>
<p>I think that unless</p>
<p>the Fed steps in here over</p>
<p>the weekend, we&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>potentially a run on</p>
<p>the regional banking system, a</p>
<p>cascade like we saw in 2008.</p>
<p>Well, Sax, let&rsquo;s just take a step back</p>
<p>before, because I think you&rsquo;re right, but we</p>
<p>should talk about why that happens,</p>
<p>the contagion drivers. And just so people</p>
<p>know, Silicon Valley Bank is used</p>
<p>by 50% of venture-backed</p>
<p>startups, and</p>
<p>I would say the majority of venture firms</p>
<p>also have their money there.</p>
<p>So this morning I got a note from</p>
<p>a fund I&rsquo;m an LPN. They have</p>
<p>millions of dollars that</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t access to invest in startups.</p>
<p>So Chamath, there are</p>
<p>many products and services</p>
<p>that Silicon Valley provides.</p>
<p>One is, you know, banking</p>
<p>services to startups. Another is to</p>
<p>venture capitalists. They do the mortgages</p>
<p>for banker,</p>
<p>for venture capitalists, and for</p>
<p>founders as well. They provide those kind of white</p>
<p>glove services. But you also mentioned</p>
<p>in our group chat, they also provide</p>
<p>loans to GPs, general partners, to people</p>
<p>who run venture firms.</p>
<p>So the impact could also hit there. Maybe you</p>
<p>can talk a little bit about what that is,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get into what happened here.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s important maybe actually</p>
<p>just for Friedberg to just explain</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Maybe let me just do the lead-in and then</p>
<p>Friedberg can do the details. But for</p>
<p>those that are far away and</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t even sure what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>the basic problem that we have</p>
<p>right now is in the last 36</p>
<p>hours, a key part</p>
<p>of the financial plumbing of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>has basically been turned off.</p>
<p>As a result, billions of dollars</p>
<p>of deposits have basically</p>
<p>been frozen.</p>
<p>It means that people can&rsquo;t pay their</p>
<p>bills. It means that people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>access their deposits. It means</p>
<p>that credit lines could be in default.</p>
<p>It means that payroll can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>met. And so as a result, we have</p>
<p>this potential contagion on</p>
<p>our hands. But in order to understand it</p>
<p>and unpack it, I think it&rsquo;s important to explain</p>
<p>exactly how this came</p>
<p>to pass. So let me just hand the ball to</p>
<p>Friedberg, and then we can talk about some of the</p>
<p>implications, of which there are many.</p>
<p>Yeah. Before Friedberg starts with the why,</p>
<p>just the what that&rsquo;s happened as well.</p>
<p>This all started on Wednesday evening when</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank&rsquo;s CEO published a letter</p>
<p>to shareholders announcing that the bank</p>
<p>was rebalancing its balance sheet</p>
<p>by selling tens of billions of dollars</p>
<p>worth of mostly U.S. securities</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, treasuries. And then</p>
<p>they announced they would raise some money and sell</p>
<p>some shares in Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>Then the shares in Silicon Valley Bank</p>
<p>entity dropped 60% on Thursday,</p>
<p>then another 60% on Friday.</p>
<p>Of course, then the entire world got focused</p>
<p>on this. And then every venture</p>
<p>capitalist started telling, or</p>
<p>I would say the overwhelming majority of venture capitalists</p>
<p>told their founders</p>
<p>to get their money out of SVB.</p>
<p>Then you had a classic run on the bank. A small number</p>
<p>of venture capitalists gave advice to say, hey, we should</p>
<p>support Silicon Valley Bank. I understand that,</p>
<p>but it turned out to be really bad advice.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>trading was halted on Friday</p>
<p>morning, pending news. And then finally, the</p>
<p>FDIC shut down</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank at noon on Friday.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation of what will happen</p>
<p>over the weekend. But maybe you could</p>
<p>walk us through technically</p>
<p>what happened to Silicon Valley Bank</p>
<p>and why they had this cash shortfall</p>
<p>and this run. We explained the run on the</p>
<p>bank, basically. But what led up to this?</p>
<p>The irony is, it really was</p>
<p>and is, prior to</p>
<p>the quote run, a financially solvent</p>
<p>business. So I have a few slides</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on YouTube, you can see it.</p>
<p>We pulled one slide that was kind of made</p>
<p>by us and the other set that come from</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank&rsquo;s actual presentations.</p>
<p>But if you look at their balance sheet,</p>
<p>this is from the end of the year, 2022.</p>
<p>You can kind of</p>
<p>look at the stuff that they owe,</p>
<p>their liabilities, which is what they owe their</p>
<p>customers that sits in deposits.</p>
<p>Because when customers give you cash in a deposit,</p>
<p>you owe them that money back.</p>
<p>So that sits as a liability. And then</p>
<p>they had some other debt. So in total,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank at the end of the year had about</p>
<p>$195 billion in</p>
<p>liabilities, $173 billion</p>
<p>of customer deposits that they owe</p>
<p>to customers and $22 billion of other debt.</p>
<p>And then they take those customer</p>
<p>deposits and they invest it</p>
<p>in a number of securities. And the way that a balance</p>
<p>sheet business like this bank would operate</p>
<p>is, you know, the customers have</p>
<p>access to their cash</p>
<p>anytime they want. But in order for the</p>
<p>bank to make money, they make longer duration</p>
<p>investments. And those longer duration</p>
<p>investments give them the ability to earn</p>
<p>money on those longer duration investments</p>
<p>more than they&rsquo;re paying the customers</p>
<p>for the deposit. So if you look at their longer</p>
<p>duration investments, they had about $208</p>
<p>billion</p>
<p>of total assets</p>
<p>sitting on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>So compare that to the $195 billion</p>
<p>that they owe customers</p>
<p>and other debt holders. So</p>
<p>the difference here between</p>
<p>$208 and $195</p>
<p>is about $13 billion. That&rsquo;s kind of the</p>
<p>what people would call book value</p>
<p>of Silicon Valley Bank</p>
<p>at the end of the year. And of the $208</p>
<p>billion of assets that they had, $74</p>
<p>billion were loans, and they&rsquo;ve got a breakdown</p>
<p>of the loan portfolio here in a minute.</p>
<p>$91 billion were these hold to maturity</p>
<p>securities, where they don&rsquo;t actually adjust</p>
<p>the value of these on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>And $26 billion is what triggered</p>
<p>this panic, which is available for sale</p>
<p>securities, mostly treasuries.</p>
<p>And what happened is Silicon Valley Bank&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deposits came in so quickly</p>
<p>over the last couple of years that</p>
<p>they went out and they bought a bunch of treasuries, you know,</p>
<p>with the cash that they got. And the problem is</p>
<p>that very quickly&hellip;</p>
<p>Freedberg, it&rsquo;s actually MBS. They bought a bunch of MBS.</p>
<p>10-year duration MBS.</p>
<p>And important to note, of the $208</p>
<p>billion that they have, the book</p>
<p>value, Freedberg, there was a</p>
<p>whatever, 10% if it&rsquo;s in cash or</p>
<p>something. So they do have some cash there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good point. If you go back, so like, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that of the</p>
<p>$173 billion of customer deposits,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ve got $14 billion of</p>
<p>cash, and then they&rsquo;ve got all these</p>
<p>treasury securities they can sell, call it</p>
<p>$40 billion. So if 25%</p>
<p>of customers said tomorrow, hey, we want</p>
<p>our cash back, theoretically, they</p>
<p>could just dump those treasury securities, distribute</p>
<p>the cash, and give it all back to customers.</p>
<p>The problem is, if suddenly more than 25%</p>
<p>want to get their cash back, well</p>
<p>now they have a problem. And that is</p>
<p>effectively what triggers the run on the bank.</p>
<p>As soon as some folks think that others</p>
<p>might be pulling money out, then everyone</p>
<p>rushes to be the first money out the</p>
<p>door. And that&rsquo;s what triggers a classic</p>
<p>run on the bank. There&rsquo;s a statistic</p>
<p>I think, in the 1920s,</p>
<p>there were several hundred banks that</p>
<p>had runs every year for</p>
<p>almost the entire decade. And</p>
<p>this was like a regular kind of occurrence that happened</p>
<p>in the 1920s that ushered in</p>
<p>a lot of our modern securities laws that are meant</p>
<p>to kind of create the necessary liquidity</p>
<p>provisions, and how these banks are</p>
<p>able to operate to make cash available to</p>
<p>customers. But what happened is</p>
<p>So much so, by the way, Freeberg, that they made a movie</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life about a</p>
<p>bank run. So basically,</p>
<p>one of the bigger problems that Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank, they ran into two big problems. Number one</p>
<p>is deposit decline</p>
<p>where VCs</p>
<p>were not investing new money.</p>
<p>And when they were not investing new money, and startups</p>
<p>were burning more money than Silicon</p>
<p>Valley had modeled they would be burning, because</p>
<p>they thought everyone was going to reduce spend and reduce burn, and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t. So deposits</p>
<p>were going down while all these startups were burning</p>
<p>money. No VCs were investing.</p>
<p>So total deposits were on the decline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their bond portfolio,</p>
<p>the assets that they hold on the balance sheet</p>
<p>also declined in value.</p>
<p>And I kind of just put a really simple illustration</p>
<p>here on why if you have $100</p>
<p>kind of face value bond that</p>
<p>earns 2%, which</p>
<p>is basically, you know, where these treasuries were</p>
<p>a year ago, and you and you hold that for 10 years</p>
<p>that 10 year bond yields</p>
<p>$122. If the interest</p>
<p>rate goes up to 5%, then</p>
<p>that that that bond should yield</p>
<p>$163. So</p>
<p>the value of the first bond actually</p>
<p>goes down by 25% because</p>
<p>of the market conditions. That&rsquo;s how significant</p>
<p>the value changes with</p>
<p>just a 3% change in the interest rates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively what happened with that</p>
<p>available for security segment</p>
<p>of the Silicon Valley Bank portfolio</p>
<p>balance sheet. They had this bond</p>
<p>portfolio that suddenly got devalued</p>
<p>and they had declining</p>
<p>deposits. So when deposits start</p>
<p>to decline, you got to make sure you have enough</p>
<p>assets sitting on the balance sheet. So they sold a bunch</p>
<p>of them said we&rsquo;re going to raise more money. And at that</p>
<p>point, everyone kind of perked their head up and said,</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, what&rsquo;s crazy is in q4</p>
<p>by the way, seeking alpha</p>
<p>this website, you guys know, they had actually</p>
<p>done an analysis and said is</p>
<p>SVB about to blow up and they put together a</p>
<p>bunch of slides that highlighted why this might be the</p>
<p>case because they saw that deposits were declining</p>
<p>that their their assets</p>
<p>that they hold were basically declining</p>
<p>in value because of the massive and very</p>
<p>quick rise in interest rates. And that</p>
<p>SVB had bought a bunch of bonds that were long</p>
<p>long durated bonds. So</p>
<p>it led to a, you know, obviously a real short term</p>
<p>problem. If you look at the rest of SVB</p>
<p>his loan portfolio, there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a question of how distressed that all is.</p>
<p>So 10% of their 70</p>
<p>billion plus dollars of loans</p>
<p>is in venture debt. And</p>
<p>venture debt is very questionable in this market,</p>
<p>right? Because historically, the way venture</p>
<p>debt makes money is that they assume</p>
<p>that VCs are going to keep funding the companies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re providing debt to. And if the</p>
<p>VCs stop funding the companies, then the venture debt</p>
<p>defaults. And so if you go to the last slide</p>
<p>in this deck, you&rsquo;ll kind of see SVB&rsquo;s</p>
<p>performance on their venture debt portfolio.</p>
<p>Yeah, so look at this. This is the performance</p>
<p>results on just the warrants</p>
<p>that they get on their venture debt. So when you</p>
<p>when you issue venture debt, you take a write</p>
<p>down or you get paid back.</p>
<p>And then you also get some warrants,</p>
<p>you get some right to buy shares</p>
<p>in the winners in the startups at work.</p>
<p>And so the way that SVB&rsquo;s made money</p>
<p>on their venture debt portfolio historically</p>
<p>is hopefully they get paid back</p>
<p>on all their loans, some of them they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;ll make a bunch of money on selling</p>
<p>their warrants or the companies going public</p>
<p>or getting bought. And in Q4</p>
<p>of 2022, it just fell off a cliff</p>
<p>and their venture debt portfolio really</p>
<p>started to show distress. And that&rsquo;s 10%.</p>
<p>Are these realized gains or these are mark</p>
<p>to market gains? This is the net gains</p>
<p>on their warrants. So they don&rsquo;t mark to market</p>
<p>warrants. I think this is what they actually exercised</p>
<p>and got out. So there was</p>
<p>there was obviously a ton of exits in 2021.</p>
<p>So they made $560 million</p>
<p>in profit on their warrants that they</p>
<p>had in their venture debt portfolio in 2021.</p>
<p>That number collapsed to 148</p>
<p>in 2022. And you better believe most of that</p>
<p>was in the early part of 2022.</p>
<p>So, you know, they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do a quarterly breakdown on this. This was</p>
<p>like their full year numbers, but</p>
<p>their venture debt portfolio, which is another $7</p>
<p>billion of capital, also</p>
<p>distressed, certainly wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to perform as everyone had modeled. So when you kind</p>
<p>of start to add this all up, and remember, you</p>
<p>go back to the beginning, they only had $15 billion</p>
<p>of true net book</p>
<p>value, which is the difference between their</p>
<p>assets and their liabilities. And so</p>
<p>if you really start to adjust, what are those assets really</p>
<p>worth? Are they really worth what they&rsquo;re holding them at the</p>
<p>book at? And if people start to pull money</p>
<p>out, and you got to sell them at a distressed price</p>
<p>in order to give people their cash</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re owed on deposits, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you have a classic run on the bank problem.</p>
<p>And then everyone tries to be the first out the door.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically like what triggered</p>
<p>us this week. Can I give you guys my little</p>
<p>version of all of this, I</p>
<p>think there are three buckets. But before I go into</p>
<p>the three buckets, I just want to say,</p>
<p>to all of the employees</p>
<p>at these companies, I think</p>
<p>we, the four of us</p>
<p>are so truly sorry for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, and what you guys are</p>
<p>going through. And then to founders that are</p>
<p>trying to navigate this, it must be unbelievably</p>
<p>tough. There are a few founders</p>
<p>in our portfolio. So</p>
<p>you know, from all of us, just know</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re thinking of you guys, and</p>
<p>hopefully everybody</p>
<p>ends up on the other side of this by Monday</p>
<p>or Tuesday, with not a lot</p>
<p>of damage. So let&rsquo;s just put that out there</p>
<p>as sort of like goodwill</p>
<p>and kind of good juju</p>
<p>in the world for the next couple of days here. This is going to be a really difficult</p>
<p>weekend for people who are trying to navigate this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s well said, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got founders who are</p>
<p>in really, really tough shape</p>
<p>right now trying to figure out how do I make payroll?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>Okay, so just putting</p>
<p>a pin in that because we&rsquo;ll come back to it.</p>
<p>I think that this</p>
<p>whole debacle, I guess,</p>
<p>is maybe the best word.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of blame</p>
<p>that you can put at the feet</p>
<p>of three different groups</p>
<p>of actors, and I just want to get your guys</p>
<p>reaction to this. So</p>
<p>group number one, and Freeberg just</p>
<p>mentioned this, is</p>
<p>we, the four of us,</p>
<p>have been talking for the last 18 months</p>
<p>about the impact of rising rates.</p>
<p>And, you know, we</p>
<p>talked a lot about, for example, like in our portfolio,</p>
<p>my partners and I</p>
<p>walked into every company and made</p>
<p>them have at least</p>
<p>enough money to get through mid</p>
<p>2025, right? I&rsquo;ve said this</p>
<p>a bunch of times.</p>
<p>And so that was about having very</p>
<p>difficult conversations about</p>
<p>making sure that you were husbanding</p>
<p>cash so that</p>
<p>you had enough to weather any storm</p>
<p>that came on the horizon.</p>
<p>But it turns out</p>
<p>that there was some group of</p>
<p>VCs and companies that just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get that memo and just kept</p>
<p>spending like nothing</p>
<p>had changed.</p>
<p>But when other VCs</p>
<p>have stopped giving you money</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re continuing to spend like</p>
<p>it was 2020,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what caused this mismatch</p>
<p>and it was really the spark that</p>
<p>lit the fuse. So</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really sad commentary</p>
<p>at some level about the lack of</p>
<p>governance that we have inside of some of these</p>
<p>companies where</p>
<p>folks are just not doing the job that they&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to at these board levels. I think</p>
<p>people, and we&rsquo;ve talked about this, have</p>
<p>made venture too much of a popularity</p>
<p>contest where they are</p>
<p>you know, glad-handing</p>
<p>and smiling and</p>
<p>not doing the hard work of holding folks</p>
<p>accountable. And so some handful of</p>
<p>VCs and some handful of founders</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t get this memo</p>
<p>and it made what could have</p>
<p>been a slower train wreck</p>
<p>faster unnecessarily. So</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s worth talking about.</p>
<p>Then, I think</p>
<p>if you look at what actually practically</p>
<p>happened over the last</p>
<p>year and a half at SVB was that</p>
<p>they were so</p>
<p>desirous of profits</p>
<p>that they basically had a duration</p>
<p>mismatch. So what is that?</p>
<p>Imagine you get a job</p>
<p>and, you know, somebody&rsquo;s like, hey,</p>
<p>Freeberg, I&rsquo;ll pay you $100,000</p>
<p>monthly over</p>
<p>some number of months, right, in normal</p>
<p>pay every two weeks, or I&rsquo;ll pay you</p>
<p>$200,000 but you only get paid once a year.</p>
<p>Well, the problem with that</p>
<p>second thing is you still have monthly bills</p>
<p>that you have to make up for before you get paid.</p>
<p>And so most people wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take that job even if they paid</p>
<p>you a lot more because you have this</p>
<p>durational mismatch. You have to pay rent</p>
<p>every month, you have to pay bills on a</p>
<p>monthly basis, you have credit card bills,</p>
<p>all these things. And so</p>
<p>you need to match</p>
<p>the timing of your cash flows.</p>
<p>And so I think somewhere along</p>
<p>the way, the risk folks</p>
<p>at SVB just</p>
<p>made a really large miscalculation.</p>
<p>They basically went and bought</p>
<p>10-year risk</p>
<p>in order to pay back money that could</p>
<p>be called on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p>That, obviously in hindsight,</p>
<p>was not a good idea.</p>
<p>But more importantly, Chamath, they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>adjust fast enough. Well, they can&rsquo;t because they</p>
<p>have these mark-to-market assets that were just getting</p>
<p>clobbered in the head as rates got raised.</p>
<p>And then the third</p>
<p>thing is around regulators. You know, after</p>
<p>the great financial crisis, we went through a</p>
<p>period where there was hundreds of bank failures.</p>
<p>And then for the last</p>
<p>decade, they&rsquo;ve been virtually none.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been like a few here or there.</p>
<p>And the last one was just during COVID.</p>
<p>And so the regulators</p>
<p>I think have done a really good job with</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank and all of these other things</p>
<p>to clean up</p>
<p>the banking laws</p>
<p>and the reporting requirements and the capital</p>
<p>structures so that runs on banks</p>
<p>are more and more infrequent.</p>
<p>But they kept</p>
<p>this crazy loophole</p>
<p>around the accounting treatment of</p>
<p>assets, and they allow</p>
<p>these durational mismatches</p>
<p>to appear in a</p>
<p>bank&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a piece</p>
<p>here for the regulators, which</p>
<p>is here&rsquo;s an opportunity that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>glaring and obvious now</p>
<p>and screaming about how we need</p>
<p>to tighten some more of the transparency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required. It shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>a group of armchair</p>
<p>sleuths on Seeking Alpha</p>
<p>that sniffed this out three months before</p>
<p>it happened. It should have actually</p>
<p>been a regulator that said, Hey, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Something is happening here that we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And so we, I think, need to figure</p>
<p>it out. But I think those are the three actors that</p>
<p>are in play, and they each share</p>
<p>a bit of the blame here.</p>
<p>Freeberg, Sachs, what do you think?</p>
<p>Who is to blame here most for</p>
<p>this blow up? Or is this just the</p>
<p>extrogenous event of</p>
<p>the rate hikes happening in such a short,</p>
<p>compressed period of time?</p>
<p>No, I mean, look, I think that</p>
<p>SVB&rsquo;s risk management was</p>
<p>terrible, obviously. They</p>
<p>signed up for these long-dated securities</p>
<p>when the</p>
<p>market they serve is incredibly</p>
<p>volatile. Like Jamal says, duration mismatch.</p>
<p>Really good point. I would also</p>
<p>say that there&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>regulatory treatment</p>
<p>where apparently if you buy these</p>
<p>10-year bonds, these</p>
<p>10-year mortgage-backed securities</p>
<p>or 10-year treasuries, you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>recognize the loss</p>
<p>until you sell them, which is just</p>
<p>bizarre. So in other words,</p>
<p>they should have been marking the positions</p>
<p>to market. And</p>
<p>instead, they just were allowing</p>
<p>these losses to accrue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how the regulators can allow that kind of</p>
<p>system. I also don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how the regulators can allow</p>
<p>a bank to</p>
<p>take customer deposits</p>
<p>and loan them out to startups</p>
<p>with this venture debt that we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>talking about on the show, where 10%</p>
<p>of their portfolio is basically being loaned out</p>
<p>to startups who have no credit?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy. We talked on the show a few</p>
<p>months ago. Actually, it&rsquo;s a good time to play the clip</p>
<p>here because what we saw,</p>
<p>Sachs and I, seeing at the Series A</p>
<p>level, you have a lot of times</p>
<p>founders would get this</p>
<p>basically free money in their minds.</p>
<p>I raise 10, I get 5 in venture</p>
<p>debt, I can extend my runway.</p>
<p>But that money comes due</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the clip for when Sachs and I</p>
<p>were talking about it just a couple episodes ago.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>is whether the</p>
<p>return models on venture debt that were</p>
<p>created over the last 5 to</p>
<p>10 years will be a good predictor</p>
<p>of what the returns will be in the next 5 to 10 years</p>
<p>when a lot of the mortality</p>
<p>that should have happened in the past</p>
<p>now happens in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is just</p>
<p>4 or 5 episodes ago</p>
<p>we kind of nailed it. Startups have no collateral</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no security for that loan.</p>
<p>How does that make sense to make a</p>
<p>loan to a creditless startup?</p>
<p>Not true. Guys, look, I</p>
<p>disagree with you on this point. Look, if you</p>
<p>pull up the slide that breaks down</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s talk about venture debt for a second</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually invested in a venture debt fund</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen the economics on it. The way that</p>
<p>the venture debt model typically</p>
<p>works is the lender</p>
<p>loans money to the startup</p>
<p>and what they underwrite is what the</p>
<p>current VCs in the startup</p>
<p>say they&rsquo;re going to do to support the company in the future.</p>
<p>So their ability to get paid back</p>
<p>in the future is largely predicated</p>
<p>not on underwriting the company and the performance</p>
<p>of the business or the assets they have, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underwrited by the fact that the VCs are committed</p>
<p>to continuing to put money in and</p>
<p>hopefully see that this thing has a big outcome.</p>
<p>There is no commitment.</p>
<p>No, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me just finish.</p>
<p>I get it, but the</p>
<p>asset as an asset class</p>
<p>we can make fun of it all we want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually performed pretty well. These guys</p>
<p>have generated typically 18% as an industry</p>
<p>kind of returns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as venture.</p>
<p>And the way that they generate those returns</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re loaning money to the startups.</p>
<p>If the startups fail, they don&rsquo;t get paid back.</p>
<p>And then the ones that succeed, they actually</p>
<p>take warrants in the startups.</p>
<p>So they have some equity upside in the startup.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way the model works. We can make fun of it all we want.</p>
<p>It actually works as an industry.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why that broke.</p>
<p>It goes back to the point</p>
<p>you made earlier in the show, which is</p>
<p>the lender has this expectation</p>
<p>that the VCs are going to keep investing.</p>
<p>Well, what if they don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been in a generally up and to the right bull market</p>
<p>since the last crash in 2009.</p>
<p>So I believe that the data</p>
<p>for all these models is</p>
<p>skewed because it assumes</p>
<p>again an environment in which</p>
<p>companies keep raising up rounds.</p>
<p>And as soon as you get into a crisis</p>
<p>in which that breaks, then the whole</p>
<p>asset class breaks. And I think this was</p>
<p>completely predictable. But even if you</p>
<p>think that this asset class is legitimate,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why</p>
<p>banking deposits could ever be</p>
<p>used to fund it. If you want to be a</p>
<p>venture debt fund, go out and raise money</p>
<p>from LPs. Because</p>
<p>what happens is when you raise it with</p>
<p>customer deposits, you&rsquo;re creating systemic</p>
<p>risk for the banking system. 100%.</p>
<p>And the regulators should never have allowed that.</p>
<p>Even worse, the two assets are correlated</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>loaning it to people</p>
<p>who are depositing it.</p>
<p>And in every other part of the</p>
<p>private credit market, that is exactly</p>
<p>what you do, what Zach said.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use customer</p>
<p>deposits to</p>
<p>do some CLO deal</p>
<p>or to do like, you know, to back a</p>
<p>PE play. These are all</p>
<p>LP capital that goes towards that.</p>
<p>This is the only sliver, as</p>
<p>far as I know, where you take customer</p>
<p>deposits to create very risky</p>
<p>loans</p>
<p>wrapped with warrant coverage. And by the way,</p>
<p>this stuff is never free, right? So</p>
<p>they make you keep your money there.</p>
<p>They make you have enough money to cover the</p>
<p>size of the loan in the first place. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even that valuable because if they gave you</p>
<p>$8 million loan, you have to have $8 million</p>
<p>always on deposit. Otherwise, you violate</p>
<p>the, otherwise, you know,</p>
<p>you breach the loan. So there</p>
<p>is no free lunch in venture debt. There has</p>
<p>never been. And I still think</p>
<p>venture debt is very much like</p>
<p>venture capital, which is most of these</p>
<p>gains are on paper. Most</p>
<p>of these gains haven&rsquo;t really been realized.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to go through</p>
<p>this sorting process when all of this stuff gets</p>
<p>whacked. I do want, Zach,</p>
<p>your reaction to this, though, which is</p>
<p>the thing that started this</p>
<p>was the fact that VCs, seeing</p>
<p>the markets imploding, stopped</p>
<p>giving companies money, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do enough work to help</p>
<p>founders cut burn.</p>
<p>SVB said it themselves. The</p>
<p>burn stayed the same. What</p>
<p>is going on inside of these boards? Well, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy because, listen, I mean, we</p>
<p>started doing portfolio updates</p>
<p>with our entire portfolio</p>
<p>of founders in February last</p>
<p>year, saying this is a regime change.</p>
<p>You got to cut costs. We did another</p>
<p>one in May. You can watch them both on YouTube.</p>
<p>Okay? And we were telling founders</p>
<p>cut your burn. Do it now. Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait. We were beating the drum on this</p>
<p>so hard in every board meeting</p>
<p>and privately. And I</p>
<p>like, you know, and it takes multiple times, frankly,</p>
<p>to get through. I think your point,</p>
<p>Chamath, about not wanting to be unpopular</p>
<p>with the founder crowd</p>
<p>led some young capital</p>
<p>allocators to maybe say, okay,</p>
<p>yeah, let&rsquo;s try this ditch effort before we do</p>
<p>another riff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this new product. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>change our sales strategy. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>young versus old. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>experienced versus unexperienced. No, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>experience. Okay, that&rsquo;s better. I think that&rsquo;s more accurate.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Listen, if you&rsquo;ve never lived through a bear market,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how bad it can get. And</p>
<p>tech is a boom-bust cycle, and the busts</p>
<p>are really hard. Really hard.</p>
<p>Really hard. And if you&rsquo;ve never lived through a regime</p>
<p>change before, like there was in 2008,</p>
<p>2009, or in</p>
<ol start="2001">
<li>That was the worst.</li>
</ol>
<p>2001 to 3. Then you&rsquo;re totally unprepared and you have no</p>
<p>idea. And I think experience</p>
<p>does matter, and</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t that many VCs around who live</p>
<p>through the dot-com crash. No, probably 85%</p>
<p>of not. By the way, if you guys pull up</p>
<p>just that slide on the loan portfolio</p>
<p>at SVB, I just want to make the case.</p>
<p>Sax, I hear you. It&rsquo;s a risky, it</p>
<p>seems like a risky investment to make.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you guys agree</p>
<p>that a balance sheet business</p>
<p>like SVB, or an insurance company,</p>
<p>or any business that has</p>
<p>some amount of money coming in that sits</p>
<p>on the balance sheet, and then they invest it for a period</p>
<p>of time. There&rsquo;s a laddering of</p>
<p>risk, and there&rsquo;s a laddering of duration</p>
<p>that you have. So if</p>
<p>you look at Silicon Valley Bank from</p>
<p>the update they did last week that triggered all of this.</p>
<p>If you look at SVB&rsquo;s loan portfolio,</p>
<p>70% are really these</p>
<p>asset-backed loans, which are</p>
<p>56% of the portfolio</p>
<p>is like prepayments</p>
<p>on LP commitments, and then</p>
<p>14% is private banking</p>
<p>loans, which is loans against</p>
<p>public securities that people have.</p>
<p>Only 10% of the portfolio</p>
<p>is venture debt, which is $7 billion.</p>
<p>And look, if the asset</p>
<p>historically has performed at an 18%</p>
<p>rate of return, what is the</p>
<p>venture debt portfolio going to look like in</p>
<p>a distressed environment? Is it negative 100%?</p>
<p>Is it negative 50%? Negative 40%?</p>
<p>Negative 30%? I mean, you guys can have a</p>
<p>point of view on this. But look,</p>
<p>for any business that&rsquo;s managing a</p>
<p>large balance sheet</p>
<p>of assets against, you know, a short</p>
<p>kind of liability tree,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have some riskier assets.</p>
<p>I think, you know, the question is, was 10%</p>
<p>too much of the loan portfolio?</p>
<p>I think 1% is too much.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll add to that. You know, one of</p>
<p>the issues here that we saw qualitatively,</p>
<p>and Saxe and I both</p>
<p>saw qualitatively, is the</p>
<p>standard for giving these and the size</p>
<p>of them got lower and lower. In fact,</p>
<p>the covenants went away, and this is what we</p>
<p>kept having hundreds say to us, it has no</p>
<p>covenants, they offer me no covenants, I don&rsquo;t have to have</p>
<p>a certain amount of cash, I don&rsquo;t have to have a certain amount of</p>
<p>revenue. Those covenants were there for a reason</p>
<p>to filter out the people who can&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>the house, right?</p>
<p>And this is exactly what happened in 2008</p>
<p>when people started giving those</p>
<p>no recourse or no</p>
<p>background check mortgages. Remember those?</p>
<p>Where like you didn&rsquo;t have to do a background check to get a</p>
<p>mortgage? That&rsquo;s what happened in venture. They</p>
<p>just gave these, I saw it firsthand</p>
<p>willy nilly, I begged founders to not take</p>
<p>them. And I</p>
<p>only won that discussion Saxe</p>
<p>one out of five times because founders are like</p>
<p>money. We&rsquo;re having this debate, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no indication and there were no losses in this</p>
<p>portfolio to date that show that venture debt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underperforming. We&rsquo;re saying that this is stupid</p>
<p>and no one should do it. What&rsquo;s the expression, past performance</p>
<p>is no guarantee of future performance?</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s obvious to us on</p>
<p>this podcast. You guys are arguing about</p>
<p>venture debt when the real loss</p>
<p>that happened at SVB was the fact</p>
<p>that they bought a bunch of treasuries and</p>
<p>went from 2% to 5%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things going on here. Okay, Freeberg, when</p>
<p>I see your chart, you talk about laddering this</p>
<p>and laddering that and X percent</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff. I think about the smartest</p>
<p>guys in the room. Okay, this is long</p>
<p>term capital management. This is Enron.</p>
<p>This is the 2008</p>
<p>bank failure. They think they can basically</p>
<p>do financial engineering to make this work.</p>
<p>You know why it doesn&rsquo;t work? It&rsquo;s because number one,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not in fully liquid assets. Number</p>
<p>two, they&rsquo;re not marking to market every day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a deposit bank,</p>
<p>you should be required to keep all of your</p>
<p>assets in fully liquid</p>
<p>securities that you mark to market</p>
<p>every day. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>What do they do? They put it in 10</p>
<p>year duration</p>
<p>mortgage bonds. We need to explain this.</p>
<p>Hold on. Where the value got devastated</p>
<p>with the rise in interest rates, they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to mark that to market. Second, they</p>
<p>put 10% of their portfolio in</p>
<p>basically loans to</p>
<p>creditless startups.</p>
<p>When there is a</p>
<p>run on the bank, you have a roughly</p>
<p>30% gap between</p>
<p>deposits and</p>
<p>the value of their</p>
<p>portfolio.</p>
<p>That shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed. The reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s allowed is, frankly, I think regulators are</p>
<p>completely asleep at the wheel. Where&rsquo;s Powell?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Yellen? Two days</p>
<p>ago, Powell was</p>
<p>testifying in front of the banking committee.</p>
<p>They asked him, do you see any systemic</p>
<p>risk in the banking system because of the</p>
<p>rapid rise in interest rates? He said no.</p>
<p>No systemic risk. Sachs is right.</p>
<p>I agree. The rise</p>
<p>in interest rates is the key driver here.</p>
<p>It drove down venture investing.</p>
<p>It drove down valuations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s driving down the value of</p>
<p>long-durated bond portfolios, which, by the way, is</p>
<p>the mainstay and the standard of how a lot of these</p>
<p>businesses invest and operate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s caused distress and stress on the system.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is the contagion</p>
<p>effect that arises next. If you go in</p>
<p>and you continue to assume interest rates climb</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s holding onto these bonds and they&rsquo;re getting written down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you owe people all this money and cash.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s happening, if you hold cash</p>
<p>today, you&rsquo;re likely one of</p>
<p>higher interest rates to compete with treasuries</p>
<p>because you can invest in treasuries today and make 4 or 5%.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pause for a second here. I just want to make sure that the</p>
<p>audience understands. Yellen put out a statement today,</p>
<p>Jake, just to finish the thought,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Yes. She&rsquo;s sitting there like a bump</p>
<p>on a log. I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>They need to be out front on this.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand that this is a</p>
<p>cascading situation.</p>
<p>So listen, either this weekend,</p>
<p>either this weekend,</p>
<p>they place SVB in the hands</p>
<p>of a JP Morgan, they do basically a</p>
<p>Bear Stearns or a WAMU.</p>
<p>They either do that this weekend</p>
<p>or this thing keeps cascading next week.</p>
<p>And look, I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re working on it right now behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If they are, kudos to them. They&rsquo;ll have an</p>
<p>announcement before the market opens on Monday.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re not, and Yellen&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re monitoring the situation,</p>
<p>three days ago, she was in Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is incompetence at work.</p>
<p>All right, hold on. We&rsquo;ll figure out a way</p>
<p>for you to dump this into January 6th next.</p>
<p>Take a playa.</p>
<p>He connected Silicon Valley Bank to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>What is our Secretary of the Treasury doing in Ukraine?</p>
<p>I mean, seriously.</p>
<p>Take it easy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened, just so people understand.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were at</p>
<p>102, you get like 2% a year.</p>
<p>They bought a bunch of those.</p>
<p>That was actually, when you think about it,</p>
<p>you would say, that&rsquo;s a safe bet.</p>
<p>The problem is, those are locked up</p>
<p>for 10 years. And nobody anticipated</p>
<p>on the Silicon Valley Bank team</p>
<p>that the rate hike would happen so</p>
<p>quickly, so violently.</p>
<p>Remember we saw the 25, 25, 50, 50,</p>
<p>75, 75, all those increases.</p>
<p>Now, what happens to</p>
<p>a 2% U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>when the interest</p>
<p>rate goes up is they get devalued.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not worth as much. So if you did need to sell them,</p>
<p>you would have to sell them at a discount.</p>
<p>If you held them to maturity, you would get that</p>
<p>complete return. And what happened</p>
<p>here is they needed to sell these</p>
<p>early. And they sold them early, and they</p>
<p>took a massive loss, billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what lit the fuse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the slide I showed, like the price basically goes down.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure the audience understands that. If they had sold these</p>
<p>earlier, or if they hadn&rsquo;t bought these,</p>
<p>they would have not had this problem.</p>
<p>Now, why in that</p>
<p>meeting did they have to decide</p>
<p>to emergency sell? It&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>VCs</p>
<p>stopped giving startups money.</p>
<p>So startups couldn&rsquo;t deposit</p>
<p>more money into the bank,</p>
<p>but they kept spending at the same rate that they</p>
<p>were spending. In other words, the deposits</p>
<p>went down. In the last</p>
<p>18 months, not enough folks read</p>
<p>the memo.</p>
<p>And by the way, the tragedy of</p>
<p>that is, let&rsquo;s just say that you did get</p>
<p>the memo, and you did make the</p>
<p>hard cuts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re working on something, and</p>
<p>you can fill in the blank on the thing that you</p>
<p>care about. So for the listeners, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s climate</p>
<p>change, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s breast cancer research, whatever it is.</p>
<p>This had nothing to do</p>
<p>with you four days ago.</p>
<p>You had your money in the bank, you</p>
<p>did everything you needed to do to go and</p>
<p>figure out product market fit,</p>
<p>try to get to market, try to sell your product.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>because of some other set</p>
<p>of folks and actors who</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get their act together,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re on the precipice of</p>
<p>bankruptcy in 3648</p>
<p>hours. That&rsquo;s crazy to me.</p>
<p>This is the challenge. Saks, I think you could speak to this as</p>
<p>well, is we did all this portfolio</p>
<p>management over the last year.</p>
<p>These were the troubled companies. And then you</p>
<p>have the companies, a large portion who</p>
<p>did the right thing. They had a big</p>
<p>war chest, and they had</p>
<p>set the burn at the right pace.</p>
<p>And now they, the other</p>
<p>portion of our portfolio that had</p>
<p>big war chests, they&rsquo;re now at risk.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a capital allocator right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at a group of companies that you tried</p>
<p>your best to save, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ankled, and they&rsquo;re wounded. And now</p>
<p>the strong ones are wounded too.</p>
<p>This is cataclysmic for Silicon</p>
<p>Valley. If this does not get stopped this weekend,</p>
<p>not only&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be hysterical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. This is a meteor hitting the dinosaur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extinction-level event. You&rsquo;re right, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Listen, we have portfolio companies</p>
<p>that had tens</p>
<p>or millions or</p>
<p>more in Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>And their account showed</p>
<p>that their money was</p>
<p>in the safest money market funds. Money</p>
<p>market funds with a publicly traded ticker</p>
<p>symbol that were managed by</p>
<p>BlackRock or Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Okay? That&rsquo;s what their account</p>
<p>showed them they had. And then, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>told all of a sudden, no, you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>protected up to $250,000.</p>
<p>Everything above that, that your</p>
<p>money market fund is just an asset</p>
<p>of SVB, which is in receivership.</p>
<p>You get a certificate. Yeah, and you</p>
<p>get a certificate. Do you see this announcement?</p>
<p>I mean, the California regulator made things</p>
<p>worse. The California regulator</p>
<p>stepped in and they froze everything.</p>
<p>Our companies were in the process. We have</p>
<p>companies that submitted a wire yesterday.</p>
<p>By the way, we spent all day yesterday</p>
<p>on the phone with our portfolio companies trying to</p>
<p>get them out. We had wire</p>
<p>requests that went in before the deadline. And for some reason,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a queue. They didn&rsquo;t get through.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t get out. They didn&rsquo;t get through.</p>
<p>And then, the California regulator steps in</p>
<p>this morning and freezes everything.</p>
<p>And what did they announce? They said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good. You&rsquo;re good for your insured amounts.</p>
<p>How much is that? $250,000.</p>
<p>For your uninsured amounts, which is everything</p>
<p>above $250,000, you&rsquo;re going to get a certificate.</p>
<p>A certificate? What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re a creditor in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>So, the mutual fund that</p>
<p>you thought you owned was actually</p>
<p>not hypothecated in your name.</p>
<p>It was in SVB&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>at BlackRock. And so, our companies have</p>
<p>been calling BlackRock and calling Morgan Stanley</p>
<p>saying, hey, do you have my money market fund?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, sorry, that&rsquo;s SVB.</p>
<p>This is the crazy thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting in a creditor line</p>
<p>in bankruptcy. We&rsquo;ve got to explain this.</p>
<p>These were called sweep accounts.</p>
<p>So, what Silicon Valley Bank did with</p>
<p>some of these large portfolio holders,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Saks and a bunch of other VCs</p>
<p>gave you $30 million.</p>
<p>Yes. And they took</p>
<p>your money and they said, you know what, just to be</p>
<p>safe, we&rsquo;re going to take your money,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll automatically sweep it and distribute it across</p>
<p>two other accounts. So, we got this</p>
<p>BlackRock over here for you. Great. We got this</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley over here. Great. Whatever it is.</p>
<p>You could only get</p>
<p>to those through the Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank interface. And so, it was</p>
<p>supposed to protect you, but there</p>
<p>is no recourse, it seems. Those are</p>
<p>frozen too. So, the only thing you</p>
<p>can do that&rsquo;s logical, and I had a mentor</p>
<p>30 years ago when I had the magazine and we started</p>
<p>hitting millions of dollars in revenue. And he</p>
<p>said, I said, how much money do we have in the bank? He&rsquo;s like, which</p>
<p>bank account? And he had four bank accounts</p>
<p>and he would load balance them. And he did</p>
<p>it every Friday. God bless Elliot</p>
<p>Cook. He did it every Friday for me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always done that. I&rsquo;ve always had multiple bank</p>
<p>accounts and load balanced them. But in this case,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank did it through</p>
<p>one interface. I have multiple startups</p>
<p>today who did this exact thing, Sax.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even log into Silicon Valley Bank today to even</p>
<p>see where they&rsquo;re at. I mean, I think you</p>
<p>can log in now. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. Everything got frozen. And the</p>
<p>California regulator froze them and they brought in the FDIC.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a couple of problems now with the</p>
<p>working out of this. This is basically a bankruptcy</p>
<p>process, a receivership process. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got all these companies that need to make payroll</p>
<p>in the next few weeks, right? And so</p>
<p>these processes don&rsquo;t work at startup</p>
<p>time. If you could just figure out</p>
<p>like over the weekend, okay,</p>
<p>SVB lost 30 cents on the dollar</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s just going to be prorated</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to get 70 cents on the dollar and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get your money on Monday, it would</p>
<p>be a hit to the startup ecosystem</p>
<p>but people would recover and move on. But the</p>
<p>fact of the matter is it&rsquo;s not going to be on</p>
<p>Monday. It could take weeks or months to</p>
<p>figure out how many cents on the dollar you have.</p>
<p>Are they liquidating Silicon Valley Bank?</p>
<p>Are they selling the desk? Is everybody getting laid off?</p>
<p>FDIC is going to liquidate</p>
<p>everything. Well, you have two paths here.</p>
<p>Path number one is if you actually</p>
<p>try to sell these assets. But the problem</p>
<p>is who do you think the buyer is?</p>
<p>The buyer are the sharpest</p>
<p>sharps on Wall Street</p>
<p>who will purposefully</p>
<p>underbid these assets.</p>
<p>And so that then takes you to</p>
<p>path two, which is then the only</p>
<p>other real solution is for the Fed to</p>
<p>warehouse them and guarantee them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an equivalent version of</p>
<p>what they had to do during the Great Financial</p>
<p>Crisis, which was this thing called TARP,</p>
<p>which is the Troubled Asset Relief Plan.</p>
<p>It was just a backstop and a mechanism</p>
<p>so that these,</p>
<p>at the time, those toxic assets, which</p>
<p>were a bunch of mortgage-backed loans,</p>
<p>could be cleared through the system</p>
<p>over time, which effectively meant that the Fed</p>
<p>basically warehoused that risk.</p>
<p>So I think what we need to see now</p>
<p>is, Sachs, it could be</p>
<p>50 cents on the dollar. It could be</p>
<p>60 cents if you want immediate</p>
<p>liquidity. You know, a friend in our</p>
<p>group chat was mentioning that there was one</p>
<p>claim, a company that had</p>
<p>100 million dollars inside of SVB,</p>
<p>was offered</p>
<p>60 cents on the dollar</p>
<p>today for that claim.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a really&hellip; From a third party.</p>
<p>From a third party who said,</p>
<p>I will give you 60 million today</p>
<p>in return for that certificate</p>
<p>plus the 250,000</p>
<p>that says you&rsquo;re owed 100 million</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re willing to take</p>
<p>the risk that they&rsquo;ll get, you know,</p>
<p>80 million, right? And then they take the</p>
<p>difference. Now, the point is that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing today that kind of a discount,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good sign, I think. And it</p>
<p>does speak to the fact that regulators have</p>
<p>to step in. Now, here&rsquo;s the other reason why I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important. I think</p>
<p>what regulators, and I think the people,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of them in Washington that listen to this,</p>
<p>what this does is it</p>
<p>torches years</p>
<p>of US innovation.</p>
<p>And you should not let that happen.</p>
<p>There are companies</p>
<p>working on really</p>
<p>important things for the</p>
<p>United States and for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>If the company fails</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t make the product work,</p>
<p>so be it. We take that risk every day.</p>
<p>If the company fails because customers don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to buy it, so be it. If the</p>
<p>product fails because a better product</p>
<p>comes out, so be it.</p>
<p>But it shouldn&rsquo;t fail because</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t get money</p>
<p>that is in a deposit.</p>
<p>That should not be why</p>
<p>we torch hundreds of</p>
<p>startups and what they&rsquo;re working on. Maybe</p>
<p>thousands. This would be a</p>
<p>lost decade for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Jake, first of all, do you guys want to talk about</p>
<p>second and third order effects</p>
<p>just so folks really understand those? Because I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s important to highlight why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about a couple</p>
<p>hundred tech bros in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>not being able to make payroll, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important downstream consequences.</p>
<p>For example, there are payment processing</p>
<p>companies in Silicon Valley that use</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank to</p>
<p>store their capital and to move</p>
<p>money around. There are payroll companies</p>
<p>that do payroll for many</p>
<p>businesses, not just tech businesses,</p>
<p>but many businesses in different parts of the economy</p>
<p>that store their cash at Silicon</p>
<p>Valley Bank and process money through Silicon</p>
<p>Valley Bank. Today it was announced that Rippling,</p>
<p>one of those companies, could not hit their</p>
<p>payroll cycle today because they had money</p>
<p>tied up at Silicon Valley Bank. Fortunately, they</p>
<p>announced that they also have money at JPMorgan</p>
<p>and other places, so they will be able</p>
<p>to kind of get the payroll processed</p>
<p>early next week and get everyone back</p>
<p>on track. But this is hundreds and potentially</p>
<p>thousands of companies that</p>
<p>use their payroll software</p>
<p>to process and pay</p>
<p>their employees. And then there&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>payment processors. We don&rsquo;t know how many of them</p>
<p>have what level of exposure and a lot</p>
<p>of infrastructure companies that move money</p>
<p>in and through Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>And so if they start to go down</p>
<p>and then payroll doesn&rsquo;t hit the air conditioning</p>
<p>company that&rsquo;s using the tool</p>
<p>in some, you know, in Arizona</p>
<p>and then, you know, the stripe</p>
<p>service isn&rsquo;t able to process e commerce</p>
<p>payments for a small business owner that runs a website,</p>
<p>you can start to see how there can be very</p>
<p>significant trickling effects. And more</p>
<p>importantly, like we saw in 08, perhaps</p>
<p>to a different degree, but still a</p>
<p>significant concern is the</p>
<p>contagion of panic, where</p>
<p>people say if there isn&rsquo;t reliability in the</p>
<p>things that I thought were reliable before,</p>
<p>I start to have real</p>
<p>questions in the soundness of the system</p>
<p>overall. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to</p>
<p>sack said to step in</p>
<p>shore up the problem this weekend. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about bidding 50 cents or 60 cents on the</p>
<p>dollar. Every depositor needs</p>
<p>to get paid 100% of their money. And that</p>
<p>cash needs to be made available to them by</p>
<p>early next week. And if that money is not available</p>
<p>to them within the first</p>
<p>48 or 72 hours of the end of</p>
<p>this weekend, then we&rsquo;re going to have a real</p>
<p>crisis on our hands, because then you will see a</p>
<p>lot of people trying to move money away</p>
<p>from any institution that stores their money</p>
<p>in some sort of security that&rsquo;s not 100%</p>
<p>liquid like cash. And that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s going to cause a</p>
<p>massive run. And so some what</p>
<p>has to happen, the only way this can</p>
<p>happen is if someone takes over</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank this weekend,</p>
<p>and that the federal government</p>
<p>unfortunately, as much as I hate to say</p>
<p>because I absolutely hate the federal government</p>
<p>having a role in this stuff has to say</p>
<p>we will guarantee 100% of those deposits</p>
<p>to the company that takes over</p>
<p>the bank that takes over this portfolio, and</p>
<p>says let the portfolio of assets run its</p>
<p>lifetime, see what you get paid,</p>
<p>whatever the delta is, we&rsquo;ll make it up to you.</p>
<p>But we need to make sure that there&rsquo;s cash here</p>
<p>today for all of these depositors to</p>
<p>get you had something you want to say. If not, I have</p>
<p>something I want to say. Yeah. The other</p>
<p>big thing that SVB</p>
<p>was, was an</p>
<p>on ramp for a lot of</p>
<p>investors, including many US</p>
<p>investors to get money into China.</p>
<p>And without commenting on whether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right, wrong or indifferent. The point is that</p>
<p>China has a very complicated capital market</p>
<p>structure, which requires</p>
<p>you to basically use</p>
<p>an offshore bank, ie non</p>
<p>domesticated Chinese bank, and</p>
<p>to be able to get those dollars. And so what would happen</p>
<p>is Chinese startups that raise money would</p>
<p>raise money from US investors and</p>
<p>abroad using these bank accounts.</p>
<p>And so this issue now doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just touch the United States innovation economy,</p>
<p>it also touches China&rsquo;s innovation economy,</p>
<p>which, you know, creates actually</p>
<p>a complicated set</p>
<p>of trade offs for the US government and Treasury</p>
<p>as they think about what they want to do in this</p>
<p>heightening great power conflict that Saks</p>
<p>talked about last week. And I want to just make a very</p>
<p>important nuance point here. I know there is</p>
<p>no bank that the public</p>
<p>specifically, you</p>
<p>know, people who don&rsquo;t want to support</p>
<p>you know, rich people already like big tech</p>
<p>or billionaires. The</p>
<p>reason to backstop this with</p>
<p>public money is because we</p>
<p>have a roadmap for this. People</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know this widely, but TARP</p>
<p>was just over $400 billion.</p>
<p>It actually returned</p>
<p>a $15 billion profit to</p>
<p>the American people. This</p>
<p>would require maybe 25</p>
<p>or $50 billion.</p>
<p>10%, maybe 510%</p>
<p>of the totality of TARP would be</p>
<p>enough to cover what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>here with Silicon Valley Bank and work this</p>
<p>out. That&rsquo;s $50 billion for the people</p>
<p>listening in Washington or for the people who will say</p>
<p>hey, why are we, you know</p>
<p>bailing out big tech?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bailing out small tech. As</p>
<p>Chamath said, you&rsquo;re bailing out innovation on</p>
<p>breast cancer on, you know,</p>
<p>renewable energy. But</p>
<p>most importantly, this can easily be</p>
<p>structured so that the American</p>
<p>people return 20%,</p>
<p>30%, maybe even double their money. You</p>
<p>could structure this so</p>
<p>it is senior to everything else</p>
<p>and is exactly what the government is supposed</p>
<p>to do when there is a crisis.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean the people who run</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank should have their equity worth</p>
<p>a lot. They should get wiped out.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do their job properly.</p>
<p>The equity, the people who ran the management</p>
<p>team there, if they don&rsquo;t get anything, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>They understand that.</p>
<p>But the people who had their money at deposit</p>
<p>to pay the salaries and to</p>
<p>pay for this innovation, it is unconscionable</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t backstop it.</p>
<p>I guarantee you the</p>
<p>US government could get some warrants</p>
<p>on those companies or</p>
<p>warrants and ownership in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank and make at least 50</p>
<p>cents on the dollar, maybe even</p>
<p>double. And that&rsquo;s the way this bailout</p>
<p>should be structured. And it has to be done this</p>
<p>weekend. You bring up a great idea.</p>
<p>I think I think if the US</p>
<p>balance sheet</p>
<p>does step in over the weekend,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say on behalf of the</p>
<p>US taxpayer, you must</p>
<p>get a piece of these</p>
<p>companies. And the</p>
<p>reason why is that that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>to make it fair for</p>
<p>everybody that&rsquo;s not in tech who&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>the outside looking in. And</p>
<p>if you look inside of Twitter as an example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of negative</p>
<p>sentiment around even</p>
<p>the idea of a bailout happening.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s for this exact reason because I think</p>
<p>people believe</p>
<p>that it will benefit just a small</p>
<p>sliver of people, right? So</p>
<p>to step in and to save these companies, Jason</p>
<p>would still be, you know, really only helping</p>
<p>say several hundred</p>
<p>thousand or several, you know, and</p>
<p>and the thing that that gets wrong, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>these companies, if they&rsquo;re if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to germinate,</p>
<p>should be building things that actually help everybody.</p>
<p>And so if you can</p>
<p>do it that way,</p>
<p>including and so if you can view it that way, and if</p>
<p>you can view a share of it now, obviously, look, we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>we have a very deep incentive</p>
<p>for that to happen.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>present the other side of it. And the other side would say</p>
<p>this industry</p>
<p>has a little bit run amok.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>well regulated.</p>
<p>You know, you guys push the boundaries</p>
<p>and get away with a lot.</p>
<p>And there haven&rsquo;t been a lot of consequences.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the banking industry. No, I&rsquo;m saying the</p>
<p>tech industry. No, no, I&rsquo;m saying that the average</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s on the outside looking into the tech</p>
<p>industry can make that claim.</p>
<p>And now they would be pointing at big</p>
<p>tech. But the problem is we all get swept</p>
<p>in together under the same thing. And</p>
<p>then what they would say is, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right to step in.</p>
<p>And I think that you have to give the US taxpayer</p>
<p>an incentive if they are going to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the incentive should</p>
<p>be that they should just get a share in all this innovation</p>
<p>if they take over the</p>
<p>venture debt portfolio, then they would have that</p>
<p>right, the venture debt portfolio comes with warrants</p>
<p>so they would have that I think there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>risk here that precisely because</p>
<p>tech is unpopular</p>
<p>and people I think are confusing big tech with</p>
<p>small tech that the government</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t step in here and</p>
<p>the dominoes start falling</p>
<p>and we start getting all the systemic</p>
<p>risk playing out. Remember the</p>
<p>beneficiaries here aren&rsquo;t just these</p>
<p>the sort of current generation of tech companies</p>
<p>and everyone they do business</p>
<p>with. It&rsquo;s also wherever</p>
<p>the contagion goes next</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re already seeing</p>
<p>I think multiple regional banks under</p>
<p>pressure their stock down people</p>
<p>asking questions. We know people</p>
<p>in our chat groups who are wiring</p>
<p>money out as fast as they can</p>
<p>just because why take a chance</p>
<p>you know that and by</p>
<p>the way, you have to understand that the game theory</p>
<p>around these bank runs people</p>
<p>describe them as a panic, but</p>
<p>that implies that it&rsquo;s irrational. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>irrational. It&rsquo;s actually rational.</p>
<p>And what this what this is really</p>
<p>highlighted is that what you said earlier</p>
<p>at the beginning sacks, which is that</p>
<p>the regulatory oversight</p>
<p>is actually extremely pristine</p>
<p>at the biggest</p>
<p>banks, but the smaller</p>
<p>and smaller you get there&rsquo;s a level</p>
<p>of opacity and</p>
<p>a lack of regulatory follow</p>
<p>through that allows this stuff to build to the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal right now is reporting that US banks</p>
<p>have 620 billion of unrealized</p>
<p>losses just on Treasuries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the unrealized losses are</p>
<p>on these long dated mortgage backed securities.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have no idea why regulators</p>
<p>allow banks to hold</p>
<p>these bonds at</p>
<p>their book value instead of marking</p>
<p>them to market every day. That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And on the equity side, you have to do it.</p>
<p>Buffett talks about this all the time. The</p>
<p>equity side, you have to mark to market</p>
<p>the equity portfolio at the end of every</p>
<p>quarter and he sees these wild</p>
<p>swings and he complains about it, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the right thing to do for exactly this</p>
<p>reason, right? So think about the game theory</p>
<p>here. Okay, the banking system, the bank</p>
<p>regulators have created this opacity</p>
<p>in the system. You&rsquo;ve got all</p>
<p>of these assets are being held by these banks</p>
<p>that are not marked to market. So nobody</p>
<p>really knows what the true level of</p>
<p>exposure is. So what&rsquo;s the response?</p>
<p>Why take a chance? Just move your money to JP</p>
<p>Morgan. So I think there&rsquo;s a chance that</p>
<p>if the federal government doesn&rsquo;t step in here,</p>
<p>the whole regional banking system could be</p>
<p>decimated and just be left with four</p>
<p>too big to fail banks. How&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>benefit anybody that doesn&rsquo;t benefit</p>
<p>the little guy guys, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>good set of regulatory disclosures that</p>
<p>happen. But I do think that the real</p>
<p>question is, you know, are the ratios</p>
<p>right? Do they should they really be allowed</p>
<p>to invest in these types of assets</p>
<p>with depositor capital? And</p>
<p>if so, with what percent of the</p>
<p>depositor capital should they be allowed to do it?</p>
<p>And maybe, you know, that seems to be where</p>
<p>the biggest, you know, issue is we&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>a long way. I mean, I just pulled up the</p>
<p>statistic. It&rsquo;s insane. There were</p>
<p>505 banks that failed</p>
<p>in 1921. Failures</p>
<p>continue to rise in the early</p>
<p>20s, and averaged</p>
<p>680 banks per year</p>
<p>failed between 1923</p>
<p>and 1929. So obviously,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming out of a wait, there</p>
<p>was a lot of controversy around, hey, banks can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>money anymore. It&rsquo;s too restrictive, the disclosures</p>
<p>and so on. The disclosures are actually quite</p>
<p>good. You know, you guys can go to these</p>
<p>sites that regulate the banks, you</p>
<p>can go to the SEC site, you can get a</p>
<p>very detailed schedule of every asset held</p>
<p>by every one of these banks. It&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>transparency, I would argue, but should</p>
<p>they be allowed to invest in</p>
<p>securities that are effectively not fully</p>
<p>liquid, that are risky, that are</p>
<p>long dated, with short dated</p>
<p>deposits, right? It seems it&rsquo;s a fundamental</p>
<p>question about what banks are supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>In a world of computers that can calculate</p>
<p>everything, the idea that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>solve duration matching doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem like one of those problems that&rsquo;s intractable</p>
<p>in 2023. I mean, if people can</p>
<p>make an AI version of the podcast,</p>
<p>they could do that.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, Freiburger also, like,</p>
<p>take this, I think venture debt&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most extreme example. How do you</p>
<p>mark to market a loan to a Series</p>
<p>A startup? I mean, that just 100%</p>
<p>depends on whether you&rsquo;re going to raise a Series B or not.</p>
<p>I actually, I&rsquo;m a believer you can underwrite anything.</p>
<p>I think you can under, for the right interest</p>
<p>rate, for the right premium, you can underwrite insurance,</p>
<p>you can underwrite loans. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways that you</p>
<p>could kind of invest. But how do you mark that to market on a daily</p>
<p>basis? You&rsquo;re right. No, you cannot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s my point. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so from a reporting perspective,</p>
<p>So you disclose it, how does that solve the problem?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got different</p>
<p>tiers of regulatory capital, guys.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there are rules around what the ratios need</p>
<p>to be and where you need to fall.</p>
<p>And so they bucket this stuff up differently, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a bank and you want to</p>
<p>buy securities, you want to invest</p>
<p>in something that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>liquid and mark to market every day,</p>
<p>you should have to package it up</p>
<p>in some period of time and sell it.</p>
<p>If you want to make a loan to a</p>
<p>venture backed startup,</p>
<p>package those up and syndicate</p>
<p>that and sell it as a security. And if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be investing in the asset</p>
<p>class anyway. Same thing with</p>
<p>mortgages. These mortgages already get packaged</p>
<p>up and sold, right? So it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me that customer</p>
<p>deposits, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about, which</p>
<p>you assume should always be</p>
<p>100% safe, right?</p>
<p>This is not a source of capital where anyone&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>expecting to lose money. If you want</p>
<p>to use risk capital to get</p>
<p>some sort of outsized return,</p>
<p>go raise that from LPs.</p>
<p>But to like take customer deposits</p>
<p>and use it on on</p>
<p>risky non liquid investments.</p>
<p>It makes sense. There&rsquo;s one thing I could</p>
<p>I could just help people frame this.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>aggregate amount of dollars in</p>
<p>these bank accounts, I would estimate</p>
<p>equals 10% of the value</p>
<p>of the startups they represent. Would we</p>
<p>all agree on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 10% of the value of those startups,</p>
<p>maybe 20. If you</p>
<p>were like, how do you how do you calculate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the startups who recently</p>
<p>did a round of funding, they diluted</p>
<p>10%. That represents</p>
<p>all of their treasury or half of</p>
<p>their treasury. So if that cash</p>
<p>for the startup portion of this equals</p>
<p>10% of the value of startups, I can guarantee</p>
<p>you those startups with access to that capital</p>
<p>again, Monday, will be able</p>
<p>to outperform the backstop</p>
<p>that the government provides. This sounds like</p>
<p>Enron math to me. No.</p>
<p>Okay, if you want to start</p>
<p>to take any of your startups, they have 30 million</p>
<p>have time. Listen, we don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>here for the government to figure out how to be</p>
<p>a partner in or an investor</p>
<p>in all these startups. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry, we don&rsquo;t step</p>
<p>in or they don&rsquo;t. If they don&rsquo;t step</p>
<p>in, you&rsquo;ll have systemic failure. No,</p>
<p>no, but do the math with me here of</p>
<p>one of the companies pick one of the companies that has</p>
<p>20 you have a company that has 20 million there</p>
<p>or 30 million there. What does that represent?</p>
<p>If you were to take their valuation from last year when they</p>
<p>raised that money, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s the depositor.</p>
<p>It does not matter. It matters for people</p>
<p>to understand how much</p>
<p>value is going to be lost.</p>
<p>And how easily</p>
<p>recoverable it is if these companies are allowed</p>
<p>in aggregate to deploy that capital.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point you&rsquo;re not getting, or I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not explaining to properly. If allowed</p>
<p>to deploy that, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to return a multiple,</p>
<p>an adventure</p>
<p>multiple 2345x.</p>
<p>But if we destroy that money,</p>
<p>these companies are going out of business next month.</p>
<p>That money is their money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their deposits. I agree with you. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to create a framing here for people to understand</p>
<p>exactly how much value is going to</p>
<p>be lost. I think the better framing is that when you put</p>
<p>your money in a FDIC</p>
<p>insured bank and you put it in a customer</p>
<p>deposit that&rsquo;s supposed to be completely safe,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s paying you a couple of percent interest</p>
<p>and that is reflected even as a</p>
<p>money market fund on your account, you</p>
<p>do not expect that money to be turned around</p>
<p>by the bank and</p>
<p>put in risk assets. So you&rsquo;re saying raise the FDIC limits.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Banks should not work that way.</p>
<p>Look, I think it&rsquo;s crazy that you could set up</p>
<p>a bank account because you just want to</p>
<p>write checks and you could lose that</p>
<p>money because the bankers decided to</p>
<p>loan it to some startup. That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Or the bankers decided to buy a 10-year</p>
<p>mortgage-backed security who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand interest rate risk. That&rsquo;s not the way the system</p>
<p>is supposed to work. And you got all these people on</p>
<p>Twitter pushing back no bailouts or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the depositor&rsquo;s money. I agree.</p>
<p>No bailout for SVB. They should lose everything.</p>
<p>Executives, their stock options are worthless.</p>
<p>All the stockholders of that company,</p>
<p>their shares are worthless. But the</p>
<p>question is, should depositors lose money</p>
<p>in these banks? They just thought they were</p>
<p>signing for a checking account. I mean, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>And if you let that happen,</p>
<p>there will be a cascade here because</p>
<p>the logical</p>
<p>consequence will be everybody&rsquo;s going to say,</p>
<p>put my money in JP Morgan or</p>
<p>Wells Fargo or Bank of America. There&rsquo;ll be four banks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. And all the regional banks are going to</p>
<p>shut down. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed to.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of highly paid</p>
<p>workers and not just tech workers</p>
<p>are going to be out of jobs and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have jobs waiting for them at Amazon</p>
<p>or Google to bail them out. And this</p>
<p>is the start of a</p>
<p>contagion if it doesn&rsquo;t get stopped.</p>
<p>What did they do wrong?</p>
<p>They used what is considered</p>
<p>one of the most reputable banks in the world.</p>
<p>They used a top 20 bank that the regulators said</p>
<p>was in compliance. So</p>
<p>did they do something wrong or were the regulators</p>
<p>asleep at the wheel?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Some way I think</p>
<p>this is Biden&rsquo;s fault or</p>
<p>Zelensky&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Biden or Zelensky&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>What do you guys think this means for VC?</p>
<p>It is a chilling</p>
<p>effect. I talked with some LPs</p>
<p>in the last two days in the VC world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple anecdotes.</p>
<p>I have a friend</p>
<p>runs a fund. He looked at</p>
<p>his portfolio. They have $270</p>
<p>million or sorry $350</p>
<p>million tied up at Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>They need $27 million</p>
<p>for cash for the next 30</p>
<p>days. So he&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>his LPs and he&rsquo;s trying to get his LPs</p>
<p>to front him money</p>
<p>to wire money so that he can</p>
<p>front his company&rsquo;s money so they</p>
<p>can actually pay their operating expenses</p>
<p>and cover their payroll. And then I</p>
<p>spoke with a couple of LPs in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>They have gotten dozens</p>
<p>of calls from</p>
<p>various venture funds. Everyone is asking</p>
<p>the same question. Can we do a capital call?</p>
<p>Can we get money delivered early? Can we</p>
<p>use that money to support our companies because</p>
<p>their cash is stuck? Coming out</p>
<p>of this, the uncertainty</p>
<p>that this creates in the investment</p>
<p>environment, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have a real chilling effect.</p>
<p>Not just with the GPs and their</p>
<p>proclivity to sign term sheets</p>
<p>right now and wire new money over,</p>
<p>but also with the LPs as they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>capital commitments and actually following</p>
<p>through with capital commitments that have</p>
<p>already been made.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the capital actually going to land up?</p>
<p>That was never a question mark before.</p>
<p>It was never anything that anyone even considered</p>
<p>that capital could be disappeared or locked up</p>
<p>or tied up. And the fact that</p>
<p>this is adding this unique</p>
<p>friction in the market</p>
<p>is a layer on top of an already</p>
<p>distressed and challenged environment</p>
<p>for fundraising, for GPs,</p>
<p>for LPs. And it seems</p>
<p>to be exactly</p>
<p>the icing on the cake we did not need right now</p>
<p>no matter how this gets resolved.</p>
<p>I think private markets and VC</p>
<p>could seize. I think you&rsquo;re going to see people</p>
<p>pull term sheets, maybe</p>
<p>half as many fundings are going to occur</p>
<p>as people try to do triage. Another</p>
<p>VC friend of mine just sent me a text. He can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>payroll next week. He has a fund. For his</p>
<p>VC fund. His VC fund,</p>
<p>their employees cannot, he cannot pay</p>
<p>his employees on Monday. Oh, lord.</p>
<p>And so, yes,</p>
<p>I do think funds could shut down</p>
<p>coming out of this. I think</p>
<p>that companies that were, call it</p>
<p>you know, 75% distressed</p>
<p>are done for now. No one&rsquo;s going to step in</p>
<p>and bridge them and fund them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to accelerate a lot of shutdowns</p>
<p>because people are now, cash is king</p>
<p>now cash is kinger. Right? It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a big shift. I think that</p>
<p>was really well said. I think you&rsquo;re right about all that.</p>
<p>Jake, you tweeted that you think this is going to cause a 60 day</p>
<p>freeze in deal making activity.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more or less right. You&rsquo;re right because, you know,</p>
<p>all the VCs out there have to think about shoring up</p>
<p>their existing portfolios. Exactly.</p>
<p>What if you got companies that are now in distress</p>
<p>that are perfectly good companies?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to focus on, maybe you&rsquo;re going to make new investments.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re picking a few winners. You&rsquo;re picking one or two winners</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to focus on that and you&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>you know what, the rest of them could be good, but I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a tough decision.</p>
<p>I have three open deals right now</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I now have to figure out how to get those deals done</p>
<p>and I have four companies</p>
<p>that are in this payroll situation</p>
<p>in a major way. So now I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>capital and I&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not personally affected</p>
<p>by the Silicon Valley bank thing, thank God.</p>
<p>But now we have to</p>
<p>do triage the known winners</p>
<p>in your portfolio that did nothing</p>
<p>wrong or do you make the</p>
<p>next three investments or four investments and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make good on</p>
<p>those three investments, but next month,</p>
<p>maybe not. Maybe next month I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>off and I&rsquo;m focusing on the portfolio</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen writ large.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in triage mode now. Full on triage</p>
<p>mode.</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t get resolved, if they can&rsquo;t get those.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark. I had a meeting</p>
<p>three weeks ago with a US</p>
<p>LP and</p>
<p>you know, you guys know how</p>
<p>I run this business here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s like a lot of</p>
<p>risk management, you know, we think about</p>
<p>this stuff a lot and</p>
<p>the message that came back</p>
<p>to me was, I don&rsquo;t think risk</p>
<p>management is worthwhile in venture.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand where that was coming</p>
<p>from because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re investing your money across</p>
<p>a very risky asset class,</p>
<p>you have to be always</p>
<p>thinking about how you could lose money</p>
<p>and I think that venture has always</p>
<p>romantically been described as like</p>
<p>buying lottery tickets and</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you lose, but</p>
<p>when you have that kind of attitude,</p>
<p>you just become super</p>
<p>complacent and you don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>left tail risk. You only think about right</p>
<p>and this is an example of like</p>
<p>left tail risk that came out of</p>
<p>nowhere that could wipe out</p>
<p>entire portfolios. So you</p>
<p>had, you know, folks invest</p>
<p>into funds that</p>
<p>spent a few years, probably</p>
<p>2019, 2020,</p>
<p>2021, really</p>
<p>misallocating money, right?</p>
<p>Writing ginormous checks into</p>
<p>companies at valuations that didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>who then went and burned it</p>
<p>and now what little</p>
<p>cash they had left may also be gone,</p>
<p>which means those valuations are even more</p>
<p>impaired, which means that the LPs that</p>
<p>gave them the money are even more underwater</p>
<p>and that cycle I think is</p>
<p>really terrible. That&rsquo;ll take a, so</p>
<p>maybe this is the wake up call</p>
<p>where now risk management</p>
<p>is actually in vogue and cool and it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to know this stuff. I don&rsquo;t know. We have</p>
<p>breaking news while we&rsquo;re taping</p>
<p>this. The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation</p>
<p>of the State of California has published</p>
<p>findings on SVB. We&rsquo;ll pull it up</p>
<p>on the screen for the besties to respond</p>
<p>to. On March 8, 2023,</p>
<p>the bank announced a loss of</p>
<p>approximately 1.8 billion from the sale of</p>
<p>investments. We&rsquo;ve talked about that already.</p>
<p>On March 8,</p>
<p>2023, the bank&rsquo;s holding company announced</p>
<p>it was conducting a capital raise despite the</p>
<p>bank being in sound financial condition</p>
<p>prior to March 9, 2023. Investors</p>
<p>and depositors reacted</p>
<p>by initiating withdrawals of</p>
<p>$42 billion in</p>
<p>deposits. So that would be over</p>
<p>1, I think, of the total deposits</p>
<p>from the bank on March 9, or</p>
<p>even more, 2023, causing</p>
<p>a run on the bank. As</p>
<p>of the close of business on March 9, the bank</p>
<p>had a negative cash balance of approximately</p>
<p>$958 million despite</p>
<p>attempts from the bank with the</p>
<p>assistance of regulators to transfer collateral</p>
<p>from various sources. The bank did not meet</p>
<p>its cash letter with the</p>
<p>Federal Reserve. The precipitous</p>
<p>deposit withdrawal has caused the bank to be</p>
<p>incapable of paying its obligations as they come due</p>
<p>and the bank is now insolvent.</p>
<p>$42 billion of withdrawals</p>
<p>is 25%</p>
<p>of total deposits. But</p>
<p>$42 billion is greater</p>
<p>than the $14 billion of cash they had on hand</p>
<p>and the $26 billion of</p>
<p>liquid securities that they had.</p>
<p>So you add those two up together, you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>$40 billion. And then to get</p>
<p>more cash, they&rsquo;re going to have to sell a bunch of loan</p>
<p>portfolios. And selling loan portfolios,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to package them up. It takes weeks or</p>
<p>months to do that, and they&rsquo;re going to be sold at distressed</p>
<p>prices. So this is where a classic</p>
<p>run on the bank problem actually</p>
<p>causes a decline in</p>
<p>the asset value of the business</p>
<p>and the assets that they own. Because if you have</p>
<p>to go and turn around and sell those assets in the market</p>
<p>super fast, you&rsquo;re going to take a huge</p>
<p>loss. You guys remember that movie Margin Call</p>
<p>with Demi Moore and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name? And they</p>
<p>make this plan to go in market and they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to sell&hellip; Patrick Swayze?</p>
<p>No, not Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p>Jeremy Irons. He plays</p>
<p>Patrick Swayze. He&rsquo;s like the chairman of the bank.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, we have to sell all this, but we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>take a huge loss. And they make this</p>
<p>big trade that happens at the beginning of the morning.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what happens when you have to sell a lot</p>
<p>of assets very fast. As you guys know,</p>
<p>you end up selling them at a discount. So</p>
<p>the rate at which deposits are coming out</p>
<p>of the bank can actually impact</p>
<p>the asset value held at the bank.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally what a run on the bank</p>
<p>causes. And the irony is, as</p>
<p>they point out, the company was fundamentally</p>
<p>financially sound. They had enough assets</p>
<p>at the current market value or whatever to meet</p>
<p>all of their obligations. But the rate at which</p>
<p>assets started to get pulled out is what</p>
<p>drove the company, the</p>
<p>bank into distress. And if</p>
<p>you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ironic point of view on</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. Because Silicon</p>
<p>Valley operates with such, we</p>
<p>all joke about what a herd mentality</p>
<p>and what an incredibly tied</p>
<p>and deep network Silicon Valley</p>
<p>is. We all got dozens and hundreds</p>
<p>of texts and messages from friends,</p>
<p>colleagues, coworkers yesterday,</p>
<p>all relaying the</p>
<p>news about what they were going to do.</p>
<p>And as soon as that happened, that&rsquo;s how tightly</p>
<p>intertwined Silicon Valley is.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, every</p>
<p>CEO and every venture capitalist</p>
<p>was on a chat group or on</p>
<p>a message group with other people in the Valley.</p>
<p>And once there was any indication</p>
<p>of panic, the entire market</p>
<p>flipped. And you guys saw this, we all saw</p>
<p>this within 24 hours. At the beginning of the day yesterday,</p>
<p>it was like, they&rsquo;ll get through it, it&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>They just took a little markdown on their portfolio.</p>
<p>They got plenty of assets. But</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like, well, Founders Fund said we should</p>
<p>probably get out. Okay, well, Founders Fund is getting out.</p>
<p>Maybe we should get out before everyone else does.</p>
<p>We got to get out before everyone else does. Let&rsquo;s do it now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting out right now. I&rsquo;m telling my best friend I&rsquo;m getting out right</p>
<p>now. And then everyone tells their second best friend.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, the whole Valley knows it.</p>
<p>And then the whole Valley is running for the door.</p>
<p>And this is a really interesting and unique</p>
<p>scenario. It&rsquo;s not like the classic</p>
<p>consumer run on the bank</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to pull cash out. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>of we all got to do it because everyone</p>
<p>else is doing like what we&rsquo;re seeing with investing</p>
<p>cycles in Silicon Valley, where everyone chases</p>
<p>and these bubbles emerge. The reverse</p>
<p>I think happened yesterday, where the</p>
<p>herd mentality drove us all to</p>
<p>rush for the door as quickly as possible. You know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that that might be why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as much of a contagion,</p>
<p>you know, as you might expect elsewhere</p>
<p>because places, other kind of</p>
<p>regional banks don&rsquo;t have the same sort of</p>
<p>inter windedness, as we saw with</p>
<p>depositors here in Silicon Valley Bank. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is where</p>
<p>I think that describing what happened is a panic</p>
<p>kind of misses the fundamental</p>
<p>rationality of the response.</p>
<p>So true, by the way. Yeah.</p>
<p>So it does seem like a panic, but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that each individual decision makers</p>
<p>motivation is panic. I actually</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a rational upside</p>
<p>downside calculation. I</p>
<p>mean, this is all game theory. So</p>
<p>if you think that there&rsquo;s a risk</p>
<p>of other people pulling out their assets,</p>
<p>and in fact, you&rsquo;re hearing that they are,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to wait and</p>
<p>be the last one to leave. And so</p>
<p>you think about it, there&rsquo;s no penalty</p>
<p>or downside to taking your money out,</p>
<p>right? So the</p>
<p>downside of taking your</p>
<p>funds out immediately is zero. And the upside</p>
<p>is you might save 100% of your money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a rational decision</p>
<p>when confidence is lost</p>
<p>to take out your money. And in</p>
<p>fact, it was rational. There were a bunch of</p>
<p>VCs, not a lot, but some of them</p>
<p>tweeting yesterday that, you know,</p>
<p>SVB has been a great player in the ecosystem</p>
<p>for 30 years. We should show our support</p>
<p>right now by not taking our money out.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? What happened to them?</p>
<p>They got stuck, and now their</p>
<p>money is frozen, and they&rsquo;re not sure whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to get pennies on the dollar</p>
<p>or not. Whereas the people who rushed for the exits</p>
<p>yesterday got their money out. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. It is a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even about anymore</p>
<p>whether the institution</p>
<p>is solvent. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s confidence. And</p>
<p>I think there is a risk now of contagion</p>
<p>spreading to these other regional</p>
<p>banks because people aren&rsquo;t sure, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already huge cash outflows</p>
<p>leaving these other banks, because why take a chance?</p>
<p>The game theory of it is</p>
<p>move your money out until this is over,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>with moving it back in a few</p>
<p>weeks, if it turns out not to be around the bank,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine. So a lot of this can be self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>You have to remember that</p>
<p>runs on the bank, Friedberg, you said this 100</p>
<p>years ago, were extremely common.</p>
<p>Every decade, there would be a</p>
<p>giant financial panic, and there&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>a run on the bank, run on many banks.</p>
<p>And the only way that the federal government stopped it</p>
<p>was by introducing FDIC,</p>
<p>and they said to depositors,</p>
<p>your money is safe. And at that time,</p>
<p>$250,000 was enough. The problem</p>
<p>we have is that with these business banks,</p>
<p>$250,000 is not enough.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden, there&rsquo;s going to be a crisis</p>
<p>of confidence. If you think a business</p>
<p>bank can go under, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to leave all these regional banks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go to the top four, and that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>it. So I think that</p>
<p>the situation right now is</p>
<p>really dynamic, and</p>
<p>if the Fed</p>
<p>does nothing and just says,</p>
<p>these depositors</p>
<p>should have known better,</p>
<p>the losses on them, then</p>
<p>I think the rational reaction</p>
<p>for depositors at all of these other banks</p>
<p>would be just to leave.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think depositors are in a good position</p>
<p>to assess</p>
<p>the liquidity</p>
<p>and creditworthiness of a bank. I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think they are. I think stockholders are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the people who should lose all their money</p>
<p>if the bank goes under, but not depositors.</p>
<p>Any advice or takeaways for</p>
<p>founders and capital allocators going</p>
<p>forward? Obviously, have your money</p>
<p>in multiple bank accounts.</p>
<p>I sent you guys a list that was just published</p>
<p>of all of the funds that custody</p>
<p>at SVB, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unbelievable, the list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every single major</p>
<p>VC in Silicon Valley. Wow. Where&rsquo;d you</p>
<p>get this? I have my ways.</p>
<p>Oh, extracted from SEC filings. Got it.</p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. Yeah. This is</p>
<p>amazing. Wow. Holy shit.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>Excel, Gleason, Sequoia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going pretty fast</p>
<p>here, but yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate</p>
<p>that we were out.</p>
<p>A few months ago, when we were talking about</p>
<p>venture debt on the pod,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe that SVB should be in</p>
<p>this business, so I told&hellip; Well, look, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Kraft. There&rsquo;s Kraft.</p>
<p>Well, hold on. I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>Does it say how much money we got in there?</p>
<p>Yeah. Go to the right. I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened</p>
<p>is, so after the conversation we had on this</p>
<p>show about venture debt, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like that SVB&rsquo;s in this business,</p>
<p>so I told my guys, set up an account somewhere</p>
<p>else, so we did that. So we moved our firm</p>
<p>accounts over, and we were just using</p>
<p>SVB to make warehouse</p>
<p>loans or whatever.</p>
<p>So I thought they were just a lender to us.</p>
<p>So yesterday, when all this stuff went</p>
<p>down, I said</p>
<p>to our guys, we&rsquo;re out of there. They&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, actually, we had about $45 million</p>
<p>that we were about to distribute to LPs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, whoa, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So we were able to sweep that to</p>
<p>an account we used to make</p>
<p>in-kind distributions, and then we got</p>
<p>on the phone, and we called as many</p>
<p>companies as we could to get them out.</p>
<p>And we got a huge number of them out.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, some of them didn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that I think people in Washington don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing this with the next set of banks.</p>
<p>The triage is still happening.</p>
<p>Guys, I will tell you, look,</p>
<p>Sax, I appreciate the siren call,</p>
<p>but I think the only</p>
<p>way that what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>triggers the next siren call</p>
<p>and the contagion spreads, I&rsquo;m not blaming</p>
<p>you, I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s a reality, and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The game theory optimal way to play this</p>
<p>as a depositor is to move your money</p>
<p>out and get it somewhere that it&rsquo;s completely safe</p>
<p>and you know you have your cash secured or</p>
<p>buy a security in a brokerage account where it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>safe and it&rsquo;s registered with a</p>
<p>securities exchange or something.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>for this to get resolved,</p>
<p>there has to be a bear hug</p>
<p>solution offered up this weekend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>In order to stop the next set of siren calls,</p>
<p>to drive the next panic&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the thing I hate</p>
<p>about the run</p>
<p>on the bank conversation, is that if you warn</p>
<p>people that there&rsquo;s a possible</p>
<p>run on the bank happening, you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>creating the run on the bank. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>pernicious when these things get started.</p>
<p>And yesterday,</p>
<p>we were calling all of our portfolio companies</p>
<p>because we were warning them, because our obligation</p>
<p>was to them, but we weren&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we were putting out</p>
<p>a siren to the world.</p>
<p>By the afternoon, it was really clear that</p>
<p>if they listened and got their money out, they were in much better</p>
<p>shape than the ones who didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>This is the pernicious thing, is that</p>
<p>every individual actor has to do what&rsquo;s in their</p>
<p>best interest, and we&rsquo;re not trying</p>
<p>to start another run.</p>
<p>Hold on, but we know</p>
<p>things. We know</p>
<p>that people very close to us, big players,</p>
<p>are withdrawing their money from other banks</p>
<p>right now out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>Let me just finish my point. My point</p>
<p>is, what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to cause</p>
<p>this, as you described, pernicious,</p>
<p>escalatory problem.</p>
<p>The only way to stop it is a bear hug,</p>
<p>which may not cost the taxpayer anything</p>
<p>if the Fed or some</p>
<p>federal agency stepped in</p>
<p>and said, we are going to backstop</p>
<p>all of these banks with all of these</p>
<p>deposits with cash, and we&rsquo;re going to guarantee</p>
<p>it today, and here&rsquo;s a $500 billion</p>
<p>facility. Just by</p>
<p>saying that, everyone stops</p>
<p>trying to pull their money out.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t actually need to backstop it with any money.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>started. So, Nick, if you just</p>
<p>the link that I sent you in the</p>
<p>group chat, can you just throw that link up</p>
<p>there? I think this is the best</p>
<p>proxy for what Sax is talking about.</p>
<p>So, sort of, I think, very unemotionally,</p>
<p>how would we know that there</p>
<p>is a contagion that&rsquo;s afoot?</p>
<p>You would look at the equity</p>
<p>layer of all these regional</p>
<p>banks. So what is this? This is the</p>
<p>iShares regional banks ETF.</p>
<p>And what you start to see is</p>
<p>this decay, and go to the</p>
<p>one-week view, Nick, please. It just</p>
<p>starts to fall off of a cliff.</p>
<p>And so, why is this happening? Well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening because the equity</p>
<p>tier of these banks</p>
<p>are now increasingly worried</p>
<p>that their equity will get wiped out.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>And so, I think what</p>
<p>David said is already afoot, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It starts at SVB,</p>
<p>but forget the name for a</p>
<p>second, and take Silicon Valley out of it.</p>
<p>This is a top 20 bank that</p>
<p>now is in the receivership</p>
<p>of, you know, the authorities.</p>
<p>And so, there does need to be</p>
<p>something that needs to happen in really short order</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s to prevent bank number</p>
<p>35? Let me just say it again.</p>
<p>If a federal agency comes in, if the</p>
<p>Fed comes in and says, you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to backstop all of these banks.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to put $500 billion</p>
<p>behind it, and we&rsquo;re going to guarantee that all these deposits</p>
<p>are going to be made whole.</p>
<p>It stops the panic. At that point,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to put up any money</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a first derivative problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feedback loop. As soon as you stop</p>
<p>people from doing the withdrawals, the whole</p>
<p>market subsides. You unplug it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what needs to happen</p>
<p>this weekend. That&rsquo;s what should happen today</p>
<p>is they, number one, need to go</p>
<p>get Silicon Valley Bank,</p>
<p>hand it over to a big balance sheet, and guarantee</p>
<p>that balance sheet that they&rsquo;re going to make money by taking this thing</p>
<p>on. And number two, they&rsquo;ve got to make a statement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got another $500 billion for you.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the president? Where&rsquo;s Yellen?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make a profit on it, too.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to use any money to do it.</p>
<p>Right. The thing that&rsquo;s missing in our system</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no FDIC</p>
<p>for $25 million accounts.</p>
<p>$250 is not an effective</p>
<p>amount for a business bank.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for a small business.</p>
<p>Businesses need confidence in our economy,</p>
<p>in our banking system, or the whole thing starts to unspool.</p>
<p>So what the quid pro quo</p>
<p>should be is you can get a $25 million</p>
<p>FDIC business banking account,</p>
<p>and the bank is highly restricted</p>
<p>in what it can do with that money.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put that money in Fugazi Venture debt.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put that money in laddered</p>
<p>10-year bonds that don&rsquo;t get mark-to-market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only highly liquid,</p>
<p>secure, mark-to-market assets.</p>
<p>And the downside of that for the bank</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll make less money and pass on</p>
<p>less interest to</p>
<p>the business, to the depositor.</p>
<p>The shareholders. I agree with that.</p>
<p>So what? That&rsquo;s the way it should work.</p>
<p>How are stablecoins looking like a better option right now?</p>
<p>Even the crypto guys right now are like,</p>
<p>what did you listen to?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, J. Cal. They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It was a joke.</p>
<p>Nothing can revive the crypto market as we&rsquo;re seeing today.</p>
<p>Even in a run on the bank, which is exactly what</p>
<p>everybody was afraid of in a Bitcoin world,</p>
<p>that thing is down 10%.</p>
<p>I just want to recap the end of the show here.</p>
<p>The reason for that, Chamath,</p>
<p>is just that what we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is that liquidity is all correlated.</p>
<p>So when people are panicking</p>
<p>about the state of their finances</p>
<p>and the state of their cash,</p>
<p>the first thing they dump is crypto</p>
<p>because it is very liquid.</p>
<p>So everyone is trying to free up cash right now.</p>
<p>I just want to be clear as the end of the show here.</p>
<p>We were dancing around,</p>
<p>is this going to be a contagion?</p>
<p>And I think what we know</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re seeing is</p>
<p>the next dominoes</p>
<p>are already falling.</p>
<p>It cannot be a contagion.</p>
<p>We have to stop it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>We started this.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t want to go there.</p>
<p>I think with some reticence</p>
<p>to going there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>If you have initiated a wire</p>
<p>in the last 24 hours,</p>
<p>you are worried about contagion.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Risk management matters.</p>
<p>And if you have any ability</p>
<p>to influence what&rsquo;s going to happen this weekend,</p>
<p>we strongly advise</p>
<p>that someone comes in</p>
<p>and bear hugs</p>
<p>the market this weekend and says</p>
<p>we will not let contagion happen</p>
<p>with a very big slug of capital</p>
<p>to support it that will likely</p>
<p>not even be needed to support it.</p>
<p>Because once you say that,</p>
<p>the contagion will stop.</p>
<p>Freeberg, we&rsquo;re going to know on Monday</p>
<p>whether these regulators and the administration</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing at all.</p>
<p>The other black swan problem</p>
<p>is that this weekend we will find out</p>
<p>what some of the unintended second</p>
<p>order consequences are going to be</p>
<p>of SVB being in receivership</p>
<p>this weekend. We talked a little bit about</p>
<p>the pipes problem, but there may be</p>
<p>several other businesses and other</p>
<p>institutions and companies that we don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>that may trigger another</p>
<p>set of cascading effects that are unrelated</p>
<p>to a banking problem but could drive</p>
<p>some more significant business and economic</p>
<p>problems that we&rsquo;re going to probably</p>
<p>end up talking about next week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re obsessed with payroll,</p>
<p>but there are other things</p>
<p>that this money goes towards,</p>
<p>mortgages or rents.</p>
<p>The cascading effect of this, if people</p>
<p>stop paying their rents, if people stop paying</p>
<p>mortgages, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Real estate.</p>
<p>Biden visited Kyiv instead of</p>
<p>East Palestine. Yellen visited</p>
<p>Kyiv instead of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Do these people know what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>They promised more financial assistance</p>
<p>for Ukraine, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re monitoring the situation</p>
<p>here. We&rsquo;re in the process</p>
<p>of what could be a run of banking failure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bill for Ukraine this month?</p>
<p>Get on the case.</p>
<p>The bill for Ukraine this month versus</p>
<p>this bailout is, you know,</p>
<p>probably the same, so I think we have to</p>
<p>really think this through, folks.</p>
<p>Well, no on Monday,</p>
<p>whether these people have a clue or not.</p>
<p>No, they have to be on TV tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>This has to be a presser on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hold on. I think a lot</p>
<p>of these guys do know what they&rsquo;re doing, so let</p>
<p>me just say it to them in language they understand.</p>
<p>Folks, when you look</p>
<p>at the equity tier of these regional</p>
<p>banks, people are</p>
<p>liquidating the equity tier</p>
<p>because they know that that is the first</p>
<p>domino to fall if banks</p>
<p>go into receivership. Please</p>
<p>act accordingly. You can</p>
<p>see it in the ETFs. You can</p>
<p>see it in the trade flows. This is not</p>
<p>a Silicon Valley problem anymore.</p>
<p>It is a regional bank</p>
<p>problem, and it will get worse</p>
<p>unless you do something to make it better.</p>
<p>Right, and Jake, I&rsquo;ll just use the</p>
<p>word bailout. I don&rsquo;t like that word because&hellip;</p>
<p>No, not bailout. Backstop.</p>
<p>There were two big-to-fail banks</p>
<p>in 2008 in the financial crisis</p>
<p>who did get bailed out. Those people should have lost</p>
<p>the value of their stock. Okay, that</p>
<p>was wrong. That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>SVB is wiped out already.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is protecting depositors.</p>
<p>These are people who trusted that when</p>
<p>they put their money in a top-20 bank</p>
<p>that our regulatory system is</p>
<p>compliant, that they will not</p>
<p>lose their money. When it says on their computer screen</p>
<p>that my money is in a</p>
<p>BlackRock or a Morgan Stanley Mutual</p>
<p>fund, or money market fund rather,</p>
<p>the safest instrument there is,</p>
<p>that that money is where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be. And if regulators</p>
<p>allow that bank to put their money</p>
<p>in stupid assets that are not mark-to-market</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they shut down,</p>
<p>that is not a good reason for depositors</p>
<p>to not get their money. 100%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking care of depositors</p>
<p>here and not bailing out stockholders. Yes.</p>
<p>This is not for the executives at the banks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the depositors who did</p>
<p>nothing wrong, and nor did their employees</p>
<p>and their customers, and the innovation</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working on. All right, this has been a great all-in podcast.</p>
<p>Sorry we didn&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to talk about the</p>
<p>shaman, QAnon shaman.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a passion project for Hugh Sachs,</p>
<p>but you can announce your Kickstarter</p>
<p>for him and your GoFundMe</p>
<p>for the QAnon shaman.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the bulldog?</p>
<p>Give me that bulldog one more time.</p>
<p>The shaman</p>
<p>is an intersection of three,</p>
<p>of a very interesting Venn diagram.</p>
<p>He is very athletically</p>
<p>fit, incredibly</p>
<p>hairy, and oddly tattooed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trifecta</p>
<p>that you rarely see.</p>
<p>You rarely see that. Also,</p>
<p>cultural appropriation, so yeah, we have to keep that</p>
<p>in mind, and conspiracy theories. I mean, this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got it all. Are we</p>
<p>going to play poker this weekend and just,</p>
<p>like, as the meteor is coming</p>
<p>towards Silicon Valley? He&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>an odd, seriously, the shaman,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name? Jake?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s all that.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s a guy who has</p>
<p>diagnosed mental illness, but he&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>non-violent. He&rsquo;s completely non-violent.</p>
<p>He actually believes in the philosophy</p>
<p>of Mahatma Gandhi of no violence</p>
<p>towards any creatures.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a vegetarian.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s a bit of an odd duck. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freeberg of QAnon. And he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t assault anyone. He just</p>
<p>wandered through the Capitol, apparently getting a</p>
<p>tour from police</p>
<p>officers who were just guiding him through it. He&rsquo;s the January</p>
<p>6th freeberg. And he got four years, hold on a second,</p>
<p>he got four years in jail for that because he</p>
<p>became the face of an insurrection</p>
<p>because he just looks so weird</p>
<p>with the Viking horns and the face pain</p>
<p>or whatever. He also made some threats to the</p>
<p>politicians too, but yeah. I mean, it</p>
<p>does seem like it might not be the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>He wrote a note saying, we&rsquo;re coming for you,</p>
<p>I think, on, you have to look into the case,</p>
<p>but he was sentenced by a Republican judge</p>
<p>from Texas. And he had made threats,</p>
<p>written threats, and put them on the desks of folks.</p>
<p>And he was one of the first people</p>
<p>into the building. So I think they got him for that.</p>
<p>But I agree with you.</p>
<p>Listen, it depends how he got into the building. If he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break a door down or didn&rsquo;t smash a window,</p>
<p>if he damaged property, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>If he assaulted someone, that&rsquo;s one thing. But if he just</p>
<p>wandered through the Capitol,</p>
<p>I think four years is kind of excessive. And I think the</p>
<p>reason why the guy got four years is because</p>
<p>of his mental illness, he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>able to defend himself the way that he should be.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental civil liberties issue.</p>
<p>If you have any compassion at all, you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let a guy like that get scapegoated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 400 people who, of</p>
<p>the thousands of people who broke in,</p>
<p>who were violent and who got sentences</p>
<p>of some degree, they were all</p>
<p>settled, like, plea</p>
<p>bargained, including his.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t go to trial. And if,</p>
<p>you know, I think we can all agree, the</p>
<p>violence that occurred that day is,</p>
<p>you know, should be punished, and the non-violent</p>
<p>stuff should be a speeding</p>
<p>ticket, you know, and we don&rsquo;t need to&hellip;</p>
<p>I think three categories, Jason. I think violence, the</p>
<p>assault on cops, and so forth,</p>
<p>punished most severely.</p>
<p>Then damage of property, and then</p>
<p>people who just</p>
<p>trespassed or wandered through, who may not even</p>
<p>have known they were trespassing.</p>
<p>Probation. That&rsquo;s not jail time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a felony. Yeah, I mean, we want to</p>
<p>promote peaceful protest. If they</p>
<p>had come with guitars and saying</p>
<p>kumbaya, and we shall overcome,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be having a different discussion here. Instead,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t beat cops, you know, and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>beat cops up. Sorry. Those ones go to jail.</p>
<p>Yeah, period. Full stop. We&rsquo;re in agreement. Okay,</p>
<p>everybody, this has been another amazing</p>
<p>All In podcast. Sorry we couldn&rsquo;t get to all the</p>
<p>news, but we felt that this required</p>
<p>a big unpacking for</p>
<p>the sultan of science,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>dictator, and the rain man.</p>
<p>I am the undisputed world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest moderator. We&rsquo;ll see you next time on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Not this week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain man</p>
<p>David Saks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And instead, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this, like,</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet your</p>
<p>feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
