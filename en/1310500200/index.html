    <p>The following is a conversation with Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, human rights activist,</p>
<p>and author of the book, In Order to Live. Quick mention of our sponsors, Belcampo, Gala Games,</p>
<p>Batter Help, and Aid Sleep. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Let me say a few words about North Korea. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea went through a famine.</p>
<p>Mass starvation, caused primarily by King Jong Il, who at the time was the new leader of North</p>
<p>Korea after his father&rsquo;s death in 1994. Somewhere between 600,000 and 3 million people died due to</p>
<p>starvation. From all the stories of famine in history, including my own family history, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come to understand that hunger tortures the human mind in a way that can break everything we stand</p>
<p>for. In North Korea, during the 90s famine, many were driven to cannibalism. Imagine more than 10</p>
<p>million people suffering starvation for months and years, always on the brink of death. We don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the exact numbers of people who died because the suffering was done in silence, in darkness. Very</p>
<p>little information in or out. Most people had to survive without electricity, without clean water,</p>
<p>medical supplies, sanitation, and food. The North Korean propaganda machine called this</p>
<p>the Arduous March, or the March of Suffering, and words such as famine and hunger were banned</p>
<p>because they implied government failure. And once again, now, in 2021, King Jong Un,</p>
<p>the current leader of North Korea, is calling for his country to prepare for another Arduous March,</p>
<p>or March of Suffering. Another period of mass starvation as the country closes its borders.</p>
<p>Looking at atrocities of the past decades and the encroaching atrocity there now, I think about the</p>
<p>quiet suffering of millions of North Koreans. I think about the torture of the human spirit.</p>
<p>I think about a North Korean child who could be a scientist, an artist, a writer, but who instead</p>
<p>grows impossibly thin without food, their bodies slowly rotting away as their parents watch</p>
<p>helplessly. I got emotional in this conversation with you and me, in part because I remembered my</p>
<p>grandmother, who survived Khaldamur, the famine in Ukraine, intentionally created by Stalin,</p>
<p>where 4 to 10 million people died and many, many more suffered. Imagine knowing that if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>engage in cannibalism, you will die before your children did, and then they will be eaten.</p>
<p>Imagine, because of this, deciding to murder and eat your own children,</p>
<p>as many people did. Imagine the kind of desperation, torture, that leads up to a decision</p>
<p>like that. I&rsquo;m not smart enough to know what evil is, nor where to draw the line between good and</p>
<p>evil. But Stalin, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, are men who in the name of power are willing to make</p>
<p>millions of people, of children, suffer and die from starvation. I rarely have hate in my heart,</p>
<p>but I hate these men. I hate that such men exist in this world. I hate that the beauty I love about</p>
<p>this life exists amidst such unimaginable cruelty. I have been haunted by this conversation,</p>
<p>by memories of my grandmother&rsquo;s pain. But I&rsquo;ve also been warmed by memories of her love.</p>
<p>Love gives me hope. Hope for the perseverance of the human spirit, even in the face of evil.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with you and me, Park.</p>
<p>Park. Can you tell your story from North Korea to today as you describe in your 2015 book,</p>
<p>and with the extra perspective on life, love and freedom you&rsquo;ve gained since then?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a long story. So I was born in the northern part of North Korea initially.</p>
<p>And my father was a party member. And my mom was housewife. I had one older sister.</p>
<p>And I remember born in that country. I never thought I was in an unusual country. Now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking of what is literally called the Hermit Kingdom. But I thought I believed that I was</p>
<p>living in the best country on earth. It was a socialist paradise. And everybody in the rest</p>
<p>of the world worshiped my ideal leader. And there was nothing to envy for me. So I had this</p>
<p>enormous pride in my heart. And grateful to be in that country.</p>
<p>So it was love for the leader, not fear?</p>
<p>For me at least, it was love. Yeah, it was all the moderation and gratitude.</p>
<p>It changed lately, but for me was pure, pure like love.</p>
<p>Was there any, like looking back with the perspective you have now,</p>
<p>would you describe some of those moments growing up as full of happiness? Or was that</p>
<p>delusion at the time? So not knowing the alternative, will you still be able to be happy?</p>
<p>The fact that I did not know, like in North Korea, this is the only country in this 21st century</p>
<p>has no internet. And they don&rsquo;t even know the existence of internet. Not only that,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even have this 24 hour electricity. So not knowing definitely helped, I think,</p>
<p>to be sane. So as a human being, you&rsquo;re still able to find moments of happiness?</p>
<p>I think my happiness was from family, nothing else. Even though those days keep telling me</p>
<p>that they were our source of meaning and happiness, I don&rsquo;t think I ever got happy by that.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re here and they&rsquo;re in schools. And like when I was learning propaganda,</p>
<p>like, you know, the proud feeling, right? I mean, the greatest nation here and there,</p>
<p>but like actually true happiness came from laughing with my family, my friends.</p>
<p>Are there any childhood memories, pleasant or painful ones that stand out to you now?</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, whenever I think about my North Korea, the interesting is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no color. I mean, one is because North Korean country has no color, right? Most of</p>
<p>things are unpaved and trees all cut down. We have no fear. So people cut down trees to</p>
<p>make food. So but only that, like, even what we are wearing was like no color. So it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting memory to look back.</p>
<p>What about fashion? I&rsquo;ve noticed from sort of you now, you have quite an incredible sense of</p>
<p>fashion. So contrast that with your time in North Korea. How do you remember fashion? Just</p>
<p>ways that people could express themselves visually. Was it all bland?</p>
<p>There was no word for fashion in North Korea. We didn&rsquo;t even know. It was not even in our</p>
<p>dictionary. So of course, I did not know what Victoria&rsquo;s Secret models were. I didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what models were. So when I came out, I learned the model was a job. And like, what</p>
<p>is that? And I&rsquo;m still confused. So there&rsquo;s so many jobs that we have here doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>in North Korea.</p>
<p>What was life like in North Korea as compared to the rest of the world? So maybe you said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no internet. 24 hour electricity is a luxury you do not have. What about food?</p>
<p>What about water? What about basic human rights?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a thing like when people were asking me, can you tell me about like life</p>
<p>in North Korea? And in the past, I was like, I cannot describe it to you. And initially</p>
<p>I thought, oh, because of my English that I cannot find the words. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different planet. The common sense that we have doesn&rsquo;t exist there. Like people literally</p>
<p>do not know the concept of romantic love, or human rights or liberty. So when I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>back to my country, it&rsquo;s, you know, like, as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right</p>
<p>now. It&rsquo;s like that kind of difference. I grew up never seen the map of the world. I</p>
<p>never knew that I was Asian. Like the regime told me that I was Kim Il Sung, the first</p>
<p>Kim race. And then our calendar doesn&rsquo;t begin when Jesus Christ was born. Our calendar begins</p>
<p>where Kim was born. So we, and history was forgotten to us. They didn&rsquo;t teach us about</p>
<p>of course, Christianity or like the Big Bang. Like our history began when Kim was born.</p>
<p>So everything was forgotten to us. And it was a different meaning. I mean, feeling of</p>
<p>existence, you know, it&rsquo;s not even like same life. I literally think that was almost like</p>
<p>my past life. And this is like a new life that I began.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost like a different human being now.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve, I have to say, I often say that my favorite book is Animal Farm by George</p>
<p>Orwell. I&rsquo;ve read it, I don&rsquo;t know how many times. And so I was really happy to hear that</p>
<p>that was of the many books, excellent books that we&rsquo;ll hopefully talk about. You&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>that Animal Farm had a big impact on you. It was the book that kind of led to a kind</p>
<p>of awakening for you. Maybe can you describe what impact it had?</p>
<p>So after going through what I went through, and I arrived in South Korea after many years</p>
<p>of journey, they were saying, so Kims were dictators, and South Korea is not colonized</p>
<p>by American bastards. And Americans, first of all, not bastards, they&rsquo;re good people.</p>
<p>And then they say everything that you believe in North Korea was a lie. It was a propaganda.</p>
<p>Then at 15, I was thinking, so if everything that I believe was a lie, how do I know what</p>
<p>I believe is not a lie? That was so hard. How do I trust ever again? And I just, it</p>
<p>was chaos in belief. I did not know what was true anymore. And that&rsquo;s the moment, a few</p>
<p>years later, I read this book, like Animal Farm, just by mistake. It was a very short</p>
<p>book in the library. I was like, okay, I can finish that quickly. And when they&rsquo;re ending</p>
<p>that, like last chapter, they could not see between the pigs and humans anymore. That</p>
<p>sentence, I just understood everything that happened. It made every sense to me, what</p>
<p>happened to me, my people, and to my country.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so many things I could say about that book. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a haunting nature</p>
<p>to the end. And I guess spoiler alert, but you should have read this already. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>listening to this. At the end, the animals were looking to the humans and to the pigs</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t see the difference. And then there&rsquo;s this kind of gradual transition</p>
<p>from the initial revolutionary steps of animals fighting for their freedom to slowly the pigs</p>
<p>gaining control, went from four legs good, two legs bad, to four legs good, two legs</p>
<p>better, I believe. Two legs even better, I think, something like that. So like gradually</p>
<p>transitioning the ideology under which the farm operates. And I think the gradual nature</p>
<p>of that, where basically you have generations born not knowing how things were in the past.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes the most kind of, for me, haunting transition from freedom to slavery</p>
<p>to suffering to injustice, all those things. And the animals don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re part of</p>
<p>that. And also for me personally, I always kind of found a kinship with Boxer the horse</p>
<p>because I just, I&rsquo;m kind of an idiot, I just work really hard. And I just love the idea</p>
<p>of working hard for an ideal. And the tragic nature of, to the end, that horse, Boxer,</p>
<p>working his ass off for the pride for others. But yeah, for the pride of the farm, you know.</p>
<p>And then the pigs giving him, sort of using that, but then just sending him to the slaughterhouse</p>
<p>anyway, when he was no longer useful. I mean, there&rsquo;s so many tragic elements that echo</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve seen in the Soviet Union. And many of the elements that you see in even</p>
<p>harsher, more drastic way in North Korea. If there&rsquo;s something hopeful you pull from</p>
<p>that book, like within the suffering, within the gradual decline, the taking away the freedom,</p>
<p>there were still moments of beauty, it seemed like.</p>
<p>It can be. But I think for me was when I was ending the last page of the book. Until that</p>
<p>point, I was angry towards the dictator. Why do you do this as a human being? I was so</p>
<p>angry, dreaming of killing him, right? Revenge on my father, the people that he killed.</p>
<p>But when I was ending the last chapter, actually everybody was responsible to create this dystopia</p>
<p>in my country. The initial animals, when they&rsquo;re scared, when they see the first execution,</p>
<p>and then they were not doing their job, speaking out and keep questioning. They had a question</p>
<p>and then as soon as they see a fear, they silence. Because of that, that&rsquo;s when I was</p>
<p>like, my grandma knew life could be different. I think the one thing about North Koreans</p>
<p>are unique is that they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re oppressed. They don&rsquo;t know that they are slaves</p>
<p>to the dictator. And the fact that other people know they&rsquo;re oppressed, like in America, a</p>
<p>lot of people think they are oppressed, like you are not oppressed. You don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>the definition of oppression. And that&rsquo;s like when the new animals came, the new animals</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know what the life could be like. There&rsquo;s no alternative for them to compare</p>
<p>even. And I was like, my grandmother knew. Why didn&rsquo;t they not do anything about it?</p>
<p>And they were just scared. They kept silent. And everybody was responsible.</p>
<p>So the people who knew were too afraid to say. And then there&rsquo;s people that just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know. And I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s more terrifying about human nature, looking at this group</p>
<p>of people who are afraid to say that things could be otherwise, and then the group of</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t even know it could be better.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s the reason I return to that book often, because it&rsquo;s such, maybe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interesting using animals to represent ideas that were very human. It almost</p>
<p>allows you to explore the darkness of human nature without sort of being broken by it.</p>
<p>So you mentioned anger. When I watch your interviews, you&rsquo;re really calm and collected.</p>
<p>Not just your interviews, you know, Instagram, the way you present yourself. You, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, it seems like you&rsquo;re almost at peace with the world. Is there in private times</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just angry? Do you feel fear? Do you go to dark places, depression, all</p>
<p>those kinds of things? Are you, are you able to put that world that you were in behind</p>
<p>you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke because I talk about North Korea every single day and I still rescue people</p>
<p>like from China and Russia and other countries, right? And sometimes I&rsquo;ll rescue mission</p>
<p>figures and they get captured and sent back. I still have people in North Korea report</p>
<p>to me. So like when I talked to my sister who chose to not be in this life, activist</p>
<p>life, she forgot most of things. And like for the other hand, I like to remember everything.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s a blessing to keep reminded of how, because it&rsquo;s, you know, they say happiness</p>
<p>is a relative thing. It is sometimes. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s also people say because nobody</p>
<p>was foreign when you&rsquo;re growing up, everybody was suffering. You should have been okay,</p>
<p>right? But no, like if you are suffering in that degree, no matter, even if there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>comparison, like if you&rsquo;re in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, right? In the concentration</p>
<p>camp, I&rsquo;m sure nobody was better than them. I&rsquo;m sure they were suffering. It&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing. I suffered. But now because I&rsquo;m in this place, I can compare easily, right? Getting</p>
<p>that perspective. But it is true, like I still have days that I cannot get out of bed. And</p>
<p>I really hoping like that when it was Elon Musk talking about downloading your brain,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah. Maybe technology develops that I can download some part of my memory</p>
<p>and then I can erase it or delete it. And that&rsquo;d be so much better.</p>
<p>What I, this is a, sorry for the tough question, but if I came to you, if Elon came to you</p>
<p>and said, we can erase that part of your memory, would you do it?</p>
<p>Some days I would do it for sure. And my mom would do 100%. My sister would do it. All</p>
<p>other defectors know they do 100%. For me, I hesitated because I&rsquo;m a witness. So if I</p>
<p>delete that part, I don&rsquo;t know how real that can be. But it is painful. After I talk, give</p>
<p>a speech, right? I mean, I&rsquo;m fine. But somehow I&rsquo;m depressed. Sometimes if the talk was very</p>
<p>intense, I&rsquo;m like depressed for three weeks. It takes a while for me to be recharged. But</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it is. I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also the, and there&rsquo;s a guy named Victor Franco who wrote the book, Man</p>
<p>Search for Meaning. And there&rsquo;s some aspect where, so he talks about the Holocaust and</p>
<p>that you can, in those moments of suffering, still discover meaning, still discover happiness</p>
<p>in the simplest of joys. Like while starving, a little piece of bread could be a source</p>
<p>of incredible joy. And there&rsquo;s some aspect in which that experience gives you a clarity</p>
<p>about the world. Like somehow experiencing suffering allows you to deeply experience</p>
<p>joy and love, and also empathize with the suffering of others. And it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>brings you closer to other humans. This double edged sword that the highest of joys sometimes</p>
<p>are catalyzed by suffering. And it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do with that. You see that</p>
<p>with World War II, the stories of soldiers that have suffered, but some of the closest</p>
<p>bonds of brotherhood, of just pure love was experienced by them. And it sucks that our</p>
<p>brains are like this. Love requires hardship. I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like that thing. Of course, in my journey, I learned how to survive, right?</p>
<p>When to not trust and when to run. But I think most of us keep learning what it means to</p>
<p>be a human being. I think that was like the ultimate thing I was keep learning. And I</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t know fully what it means. But I do think it seems like suffering is necessary</p>
<p>for people to be grateful and even be joyful too sometimes.</p>
<p>So I talk about love quite a bit. And you mentioned that romantic love. I&rsquo;m fascinated</p>
<p>about love in many aspects. But you mentioned romantic love was forbidden in North Korea.</p>
<p>What do you think about love now that you&rsquo;ve kind of discovered it? What&rsquo;s the role of</p>
<p>love in life? So why do you think it was forbidden in North Korea?</p>
<p>So the tragic thing about North Korea is not only just banning Shakespeare, like we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know what Romeo and Juliet is, right? Our movies is never about love stories. But</p>
<p>then also they banned the love between mother and daughter, wife and husband, and between</p>
<p>your friends. They deny you being a human. So only love that I knew was when I described</p>
<p>my feeling towards the leader and in a written form. That was the only love that people know</p>
<p>in North Korea. And now I&rsquo;m like, there are many loves you can experience. I think you</p>
<p>definitely love science, right? But imagine that if you&rsquo;re being denied that. So there</p>
<p>are so many loves in life. But in North Korea, all of those things are denied. And I think</p>
<p>for me, love is what makes you tick. Like, you know, love for your child, love for your</p>
<p>parents, love for your friends, love for even yourself. That is denied. So I mean, many</p>
<p>people say like, love is an option. But like, then why do you live? I think we live to love.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be romantic love. It can be anything. But finding love in any person</p>
<p>or in any subject, I think that&rsquo;s a goal. I think that&rsquo;s when people find meaning in</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think romantic love is just one sort of, one echo of some core thing. Yeah, science,</p>
<p>I love science, I love robots, all of those things. And it sounds like deliberately or</p>
<p>not, the North Korean regime wants to channel that very deep aspect of the human spirit</p>
<p>all towards the leader.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the only thing they allow us to fear and know about. So I remember,</p>
<p>I mean, you read 1984 by George Orwell, it talks about double think and double speak,</p>
<p>who controls the language, who controls thoughts. And why he does talk about as they go, they</p>
<p>eliminate a lot of words, right? Now, later one word can represent 10 different things.</p>
<p>And what fascinates me is how many vocabulary meaning people can have. And when I literally</p>
<p>came out, I remember I went to San Francisco, and someone came to me and hugged me. And</p>
<p>then he was a guy like, oh, baby, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m gay. I was like, what the heck is gay?</p>
<p>And then I literally had to go to a hotel room and Google the gay. And it&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you meant. And like that, like, they deny what that is. I&rsquo;m sure there are</p>
<p>gays in North Korea. I&rsquo;m sure there is. But you don&rsquo;t know what it is. And like that,</p>
<p>they eliminate words. So the fact that you know the concept, that stays much better than</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing a lot of people like when you&rsquo;re born, you somehow know what justice</p>
<p>is, what liberty is. And it&rsquo;s all somebody taught you that. And like, that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>why people say, oh, humans are inherently know what is right, what is wrong, what is</p>
<p>oppression. And like, no, that&rsquo;s like BS. You got to learn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that words give rise to ideas. So like, as a child, one of the ways</p>
<p>to learn about justice and freedom is to first learn the word, and then to ask, well, what</p>
<p>is it? Yeah, the concept. Yeah. And if you don&rsquo;t have the word for it, then you never</p>
<p>have the kind of first spark that leads to you trying to be curious about it. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting and controlling the words. And then, yeah, I mean, your thoughts, you control</p>
<p>the thoughts. There&rsquo;s so many echoes. I mean, I have, it&rsquo;s a very different, but perhaps</p>
<p>a very similar experience, which is the journey of my family through the Soviet Union. Because</p>
<p>there is a love of country. There is a pride of the people. Like you are proud of your</p>
<p>family in general. But I wonder how much of that is polluted by the propaganda.</p>
<p>I think a lot. For sure. Yeah. It is to this day, I&rsquo;m like, my father who died in China</p>
<p>and he was tortured and then he died. He wanted to go back before his death, right? And then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, dad, if you go back, you&rsquo;re going to be executed. And it&rsquo;s like, I want to be</p>
<p>executed. He wanted to go back to North Korea. To be executed. So he can be buried in his</p>
<p>own land. And then his last wish was, if I die, criminate me and then bring my ashes</p>
<p>back to my country. When I&rsquo;m dead, I still want to be in my country. And this is nationalism.</p>
<p>This is a propaganda, right? But now it&rsquo;s the same thing. It&rsquo;s the same thing. If I</p>
<p>die, I somehow buried in my land and I still feel like I&rsquo;m the outsider. I&rsquo;m always longing</p>
<p>for my home. It&rsquo;s a horrible home. People say, what&rsquo;s your dream? Do you want to be</p>
<p>a president? Do you want to run for office? I just want to go home. That&rsquo;s my dream.</p>
<p>And people here don&rsquo;t get it ever. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that. I love my country.</p>
<p>And I think for me, my country is the United States. And perhaps it will be for you too</p>
<p>one day. It is. I think it&rsquo;s becoming. US has been a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I think this is the first place I felt like I feel like home. And I mean, I was in South</p>
<p>Korea longer and I didn&rsquo;t feel that way. So I think we have very different life stories,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s almost two different people. For me, it&rsquo;s the person that was in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union and the person that&rsquo;s here. Those are two different people. That previous person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home in the Soviet Union and he&rsquo;s part of me. And I suppose in that same way, your first</p>
<p>maybe two decades of life are somehow longing for the home that is North Korea. And your</p>
<p>next two decades of life might be finding a home in the United States. Your dad, can</p>
<p>you tell the story of his struggle, of his death? I mean, first, do you miss him? Do</p>
<p>you think about it? Oh man, all the time. I had a son when I was 22 and I had IVF three</p>
<p>times. And as you see, I&rsquo;m like 80 pounds, but back then I was like 75 pounds. And because</p>
<p>of my severe malnutrition, somehow my body&rsquo;s very different. And so after three times of</p>
<p>IVF after 23, I was still wanting family. And the reason I wanted him is because I felt</p>
<p>so guilty for my father that he never seen this world. I somehow, when you&rsquo;re so desperate,</p>
<p>you become illogical. Like I want to believe in the, like Buddhist idea, right? You come</p>
<p>back to life. And I prayed, please come to me, like as my son, so I will take care of</p>
<p>you. Like come back. And when I was pregnant with my son, even though I planned to get</p>
<p>pregnant with a girl, doctor made a mistake. It became a boy. So I made his middle name,</p>
<p>like my father&rsquo;s name Jin Sik. I think he&rsquo;s the only American got North Korean name. It</p>
<p>is. So he&rsquo;s a part of your father&rsquo;s and your son. Yeah. That&rsquo;s how I, that&rsquo;s how I make</p>
<p>a sense of it. And that&rsquo;s how I move forward. Like if I, like as a logical human being,</p>
<p>you, you know, when you&rsquo;re dead, you&rsquo;re done. Maybe that&rsquo;s what I at least used to think,</p>
<p>but then life&rsquo;s become too unbearable. And somehow that&rsquo;s the thing, like we tell ourselves</p>
<p>stories in order to live. And that&rsquo;s how I came with my title of the book in order to</p>
<p>live. I had to tell myself a lot of stories to overcome a lot of things. I think I was</p>
<p>a part of it. Can you tell the story of you escaping North Korea to China? Yeah, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a thing. It&rsquo;s amazing. Even though I was like 13, my like life outside of North</p>
<p>Korea is almost like went by like one second and my life till that point was like eternity.</p>
<p>I remember being in China. I arrived there at the end of March at 13. And by October,</p>
<p>it was six months past. And I literally felt like I lived eternity. And one day living</p>
<p>in China felt like living one year. One day was a war like surviving through one day was</p>
<p>so hard. Every night I was like, I cannot believe I got done one day today. That was</p>
<p>a thing I was grateful for before I went to bed. Okay, I survived. I didn&rsquo;t get captured.</p>
<p>And I made it another day on earth. So the experience of the minutes is what fear, fear</p>
<p>of being captured, fear, loss, everything. Because I mean, I saw my own mom in China</p>
<p>to survive to. So it was more than that. And it&rsquo;s not feeling I think that&rsquo;s a thing in</p>
<p>China. I learned not to fear. And after my escape was a challenging, I didn&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>And it was hard. Not feeling anything is a torture. It&rsquo;s the biggest torture you can</p>
<p>ever feel like even you fear sadness. That&rsquo;s better than not feeling anything. And I felt</p>
<p>something when I had my son. That&rsquo;s when I started healing. So he was a miracle to save</p>
<p>me. But yeah, in China, it wasn&rsquo;t even fear like it was numb.</p>
<p>You were numb. It was like paralysis. Yeah. Just overwhelming on the uncertainty of your</p>
<p>future. Did you have a sense what your future held at the time?</p>
<p>Like what do you even even feature? I don&rsquo;t even know that word. Right? Like, a lot of</p>
<p>times I was looking at myself like I left my body and like just looking at me. And just</p>
<p>not feeling it. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m scared for her. I&rsquo;m like sad for her just looking at</p>
<p>me like, huh, that&rsquo;s interesting. Wow. Not feeling anything. And me like being raped,</p>
<p>going through every emotion of life to survive, right? But like, somehow, I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you say so or something like looking at it just like, you feel nothing. You don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>anything for that person. So even with your mom, like what was, was there some, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, some warmth that you were able to extract from the connection with your mom? Yeah, of</p>
<p>course. I think that made me survive. I had a very strong connection with my family. And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what kept me going to do all of that. I think, as you said, I escaped at</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>My sister at the age of 16 escaped with her friend first. And I was going to escape</li>
</ol>
<p>with her. But one day I got like really bad stomach ache. And my parents took me to hospital.</p>
<p>And in North Korean hospital, they don&rsquo;t have like X ray machines. They don&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>electricity. They literally using one needle to inject everybody. And people don&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>from cancer in North Korea. You die from infection and fever and hunger, right? So most likely</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to die more by being treated by doctor than not being treated. I think</p>
<p>I was lucky. Even though they thought I had appendix, they operated on me without any</p>
<p>painkiller. And I didn&rsquo;t get infection. I survived. So that&rsquo;s how I got delayed to escape</p>
<p>with my sister. And she left me a note in my bedside saying like, follow this lady.</p>
<p>And this is like another trick about human trafficking, right? She sold me to China as</p>
<p>a sexual slave. And she executed for it later. She was executed for that later. She had five</p>
<p>daughters and she sold all her children to China. And we can now sitting here judging</p>
<p>on like how heartless you are selling your own children to China. And as a sexual slave,</p>
<p>they were like her children were seven, 10 years old. But that was the only way for her</p>
<p>to save her children. And if she didn&rsquo;t sell me that day, I would be dead right now. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that she sold me. And I think that&rsquo;s the thing is like, life is so crazy.</p>
<p>You cannot judge. It is so complex. And yeah, that&rsquo;s how she changed my life by selling</p>
<p>me. She sold my mom and myself in 2007 to China.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re grateful for that. You&rsquo;re grateful for that suffering.</p>
<p>Of course I am grateful.</p>
<p>Because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>I would not be here with you. You would never knew I existed.</p>
<p>What do you make of the others suffering in the world today? The people there in North</p>
<p>Korea. So that is part of your life&rsquo;s work is helping those people. What do you think</p>
<p>about them? What should people know about them?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when I get angry. Whenever I think about them.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your anger directed at?</p>
<p>At the heartlessness of people, the ignorance of people. So when I got out of North Korea,</p>
<p>I went through all of that. And I went to South Korea one day. I was watching television</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like famous Korean Kpop stars crying and doing some fundraising concert.</p>
<p>And I literally thought, oh my God, something is horribly going wrong in this country. Why</p>
<p>are these people crying? It was a cheery campaign. And then later it was showing that it was</p>
<p>an animal rights campaign to helping out cats and puppies in the shelters.</p>
<p>Do you know anybody sheds their tears like that to another human being right now? No,</p>
<p>right? People rather give millions of dollars to save some dolphins than saving these children</p>
<p>right now being raped in China. And I think I love Elon Musk. I love his voice. I love</p>
<p>these people want to go to the moon, Mars. And then people told him like, yeah, we went</p>
<p>to the moon like I did not know in North Korea.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what upsets me. Why there is not even one single human with that kind</p>
<p>of brilliance in their brain. They can save so much suffering, but nobody does anything.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when I feel like hard to find hope in humanity. And that&rsquo;s when I get so</p>
<p>upset. Because think about like even Biden or Trump or Obama. They know what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in North Korea exactly, right? I mean, we see satellite photos. There&rsquo;s public executions.</p>
<p>I mean, the UN says this is a Holocaust happening again. And it&rsquo;s happening. If the Holocaust</p>
<p>is happening again, how, why, how are you okay doing nothing about it? But somehow humans</p>
<p>are able to okay nothing, anything. And this is like, this is hard. Like when people say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to change the world. I want to make a difference. Like it&rsquo;s hard to believe it,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, that we can turn our back to human suffering at scale when it&rsquo;s right in front of us. I</p>
<p>mean, that makes you think about the Holocaust. This is just, everybody was looking the other</p>
<p>way because it was almost too hard to look at it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s an easier thing. Like that&rsquo;s the thing. I was like here to speak at the</p>
<p>South by Southwest a few years ago. And like they&rsquo;re, everybody&rsquo;s talking about like Elon</p>
<p>Musk project going to the moon, right? We&rsquo;re going to be multi, like species. I was like</p>
<p>back then I didn&rsquo;t even know who he was. So if you guys are trying to go out to this earth,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t even explored our earth yet. You cannot go to North Korea right now. You haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>explored that part of our, our like planet. Can we do that first and then move on?</p>
<p>Explore the landscape of human suffering, like alleviate suffering in the world. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of suffering happening in Africa that has to do with disease. And for some reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, even though we turn our back to that kind of suffering too, we still can try to</p>
<p>do something about it. And there&rsquo;s still efforts in terms of healthcare, in terms of medicine,</p>
<p>in terms of bioengineering, in terms of like all these efforts to help people from disease.</p>
<p>But like, that&rsquo;s almost like converting it into an engineering problem and trying to</p>
<p>solve it. That somehow is easier for us humans. But when there&rsquo;s obvious sort of non disease</p>
<p>related torture of humans, we look the other way. Whether it&rsquo;s China or it&rsquo;s North Korea.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, that has to be changed somehow. We have to change that somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing right now, like the China, like they bring the Xinjiang riggers, right?</p>
<p>They say, oh, this is a vitamin, take it. And then it kills their sperm and make them</p>
<p>not reproduce. Their birth rate gone down something 47 to something 50% in the one year</p>
<p>time. It&rsquo;s a genocide in 21st century. And they get those people and get their like organs</p>
<p>out. Imagine if there&rsquo;s some people who do that with the cutie puppies and cats. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be insane amount of product. They&rsquo;re going to destroy everything. And this is like</p>
<p>a human nature that I don&rsquo;t get. Why there&rsquo;s so much anti human sentiment in this modern</p>
<p>world? We don&rsquo;t have to. The fact that I was saying like, the fact that you care about</p>
<p>animals rights is beautiful because you care about something who cannot speak for themselves.</p>
<p>The fact that we care about animals is because they cannot speak for themselves, right? They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that ability. And there are many people who cannot speak for themselves right</p>
<p>now. And why do you refuse to be the voice for them? Because they are simply being a</p>
<p>human. And maybe it connects to us not being proud of who we are. Like, I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it is. Why do they deny humans this way? Maybe they don&rsquo;t like themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost, we would have to acknowledge some dark things about ourselves in order</p>
<p>to start helping. What&rsquo;s the solution? So, you know, I see two solutions. One is in the</p>
<p>military side. It&rsquo;s assassination or the full on invasion. And then on the activism side,</p>
<p>which is figuring out ways to, like you said, sort of let people in North Korea understand</p>
<p>their situation, sort of from within try to reform. Or maybe there&rsquo;s others, obviously,</p>
<p>there could be activism from the outside to build up momentum for the entirety of the</p>
<p>world, especially the world that is not just the United States or Europe, but also is Russia</p>
<p>and China and so on. What are your ideas here? What we can do as individuals and as countries?</p>
<p>I think the first thing that we can do is speak about Chinese role in this sponsoring</p>
<p>dictatorship in North Korea. Like, I happen to have so much struggle talking about North</p>
<p>Korea, right? They say, how North Korea is possible? Why is it like the way like this</p>
<p>is 99% accountability going to CCP? Kim Jong Un cannot last without Chinese help even one</p>
<p>week. This is completely funded. This Holocaust is funded by CCP. But if you talk about in</p>
<p>the mainstream, of course, they don&rsquo;t buy it. And I think it&rsquo;s in a way North Korea</p>
<p>is a lot easier to solve than even in the Middle East. There&rsquo;s nothing conflict like</p>
<p>between people. There&rsquo;s no ideology, no religion, nothing. People are peaceful, right? There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even one civil, like any discontent among the people. Our problem is there&rsquo;s a dictator</p>
<p>funded by the second economic power in the world. And even any military, they know if</p>
<p>they kill Kim Jong Un, they&rsquo;re going to get killed by Chinese. Nobody can dare to stand</p>
<p>up against Kim Jong Un because China is backing it. So somehow here in the West, we collectively</p>
<p>acknowledging that China is the responsible person for these crimes against humanity in</p>
<p>North Korea. Then we can somehow, I don&rsquo;t know, talk to them.</p>
<p>Stand up to China.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re failing to do that in a way, in all kinds of avenues of life, of public life,</p>
<p>because for many reasons, they&rsquo;re probably primarily financial. But it also, I&rsquo;m against,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can correct me. I&rsquo;m against sort of making China this evil enemy</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen this with Russia as well. And I don&rsquo;t think that leads to progress.</p>
<p>I think you want to highlight, you basically want to help the Chinese people become the</p>
<p>best version of themselves. So speak to the Chinese people and not making the leaders</p>
<p>of China into these caricatures of devils. I feel like the Cold War, the way it was done</p>
<p>in Russia, both sides, they were caricaturing each other through propaganda and the result</p>
<p>was not productive at all. It did not help Russia become the best country it could be.</p>
<p>It did not help America become the best country it could be. And the same thing with China.</p>
<p>I feel like making them into this enemy, like being afraid of China, making them into the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s going to spy on us, that&rsquo;s going to destroy the rest of the world, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to help China reform themselves. They&rsquo;re going to plant their feet. The dictators,</p>
<p>the evil people will become more evil. The power hungry will become more, like they will</p>
<p>centralize the power more. It feels like, maybe naive, but it feels like it should be</p>
<p>like, again, love, not violence that solves this thing. Now, of course, in North Korea,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like long gone. 80 years, almost 80 years. Love is not going to solve that problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>They have tried that because of the sunshine policy, which is there&rsquo;s two people walking</p>
<p>down the street and the sun and the wind made a battle. So who can take off that man, take</p>
<p>off jacket? So wind tried to blow as much air as he could. And then that man was like</p>
<p>putting more like his jacket on, right? Not taking off, but sunshine came. Okay, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to give him a lot of warmth. And then he took his jacket out and came out. So that was the</p>
<p>theory. Let&rsquo;s give North Korea as much love as they want. Let&rsquo;s give them a lot of money,</p>
<p>whatever they want, let&rsquo;s give to them so they know that we are not here to attack them.</p>
<p>And North Korea, what they did was the guy who did the sunshine policy in South Korea</p>
<p>named Kim Dae Sung won the Nobel Peace Prize for that. And Kim Jong Il used the money to</p>
<p>build nuclear weapons. So that&rsquo;s how they came with the nukes. So I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing. I hope that love solves problems.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s got to be a way and the hope is with the 21st century is you can directly</p>
<p>speak to the people somehow. When there&rsquo;s no internet, when there&rsquo;s nothing like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hopeless. I think China, there&rsquo;s a hope that China is still connected to the internet.</p>
<p>I love your optimism. I have seen the actual dark side of China on the underground. I hope,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the thing. People in the West, right? They say, oh, how can it be that bad?</p>
<p>They ask me like, I walking passing this young teenager man and later the war with my sister.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like intestine coming out through his back, right? And even in that moment, what</p>
<p>he wanted was, please give me food. He was hungry.</p>
<p>His intestine is hanging out of his body and he&rsquo;s asking for food.</p>
<p>Do you know what humans demand when they die in North Korea? All they want is eating, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And people say, oh, nothing can be that bad. But people just here haven&rsquo;t seen an actual</p>
<p>true evil.</p>
<p>Would you say that the evil comes from a tiny minority of people or is it permeate much</p>
<p>larger parts of the population? Like if we look at sex trafficking, how many people,</p>
<p>like is it 99.9% of the people are longing to do good in the world? Or is there, is it,</p>
<p>or do we all have the capacity for evil in certain kinds of environments, certain kinds</p>
<p>of governmental structures inspire a large percent of the population to do bad things?</p>
<p>I think humans are capable of anything. There&rsquo;s no exception. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any saint</p>
<p>who born with that morality. I think in North Korea, you can say initially that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>few guys in the top wanted the power and then doing this, but eventually made a society</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t even know what compassion is. We don&rsquo;t know the concept of, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that you need to feel bad for another human being when they&rsquo;re suffering. The fact</p>
<p>that you know compassion is in your knowledge. That&rsquo;s why you do that. Humans need to learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anything bad about human nature. It&rsquo;s just saying humans are capable of everything.</p>
<p>We are the most adaptable species on the planet. That&rsquo;s why we created the internet, like</p>
<p>talking this way, right? No other animals have done it because we are so adaptable.</p>
<p>That is a good thing and that&rsquo;s a bad thing. So in the adaptive situation, they all can</p>
<p>be, I mean during the Holocaust, right? Those people, they could have been capable of good</p>
<p>too if they were exposed to different system. That&rsquo;s why when people underestimate evil,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what scares me. Evil is evil. It&rsquo;s a different thing. It&rsquo;s a completely different</p>
<p>thing. Of course, I get your idea. We don&rsquo;t want to isolate 1.3 billion human beings on</p>
<p>Earth by Chinese, but the thing is we are talking about this regime, not the people.</p>
<p>I love Chinese people. I speak Chinese. I love all about the country, but this system</p>
<p>does promote evil. Well, that&rsquo;s an optimistic view actually because we can fix systems.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s harder to fix people. So if we fix systems, then the people are adaptable,</p>
<p>as you said. Absolutely. I mean that, and then the question is, first of all, you have</p>
<p>to talk about it just as you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re right now like this little flame that burns</p>
<p>bright, and it&rsquo;s really important for North Korea, but just keep talking about it until</p>
<p>hopefully it leads to at the highest levels of power, revolutionizing the systems in the</p>
<p>world. And then in China and in North Korea, do you see North Korea being a potential instigator</p>
<p>in nuclear war? They will not start a nuclear war as long as they can do whatever they want</p>
<p>right now, right? North Korea&rsquo;s army is not designed to fight the enemy. They&rsquo;re designed</p>
<p>to prevent their own people, the coup d&rsquo;tetre and the revolution with their own citizens.</p>
<p>That is 1.6 million North Korea with a tiny country, the fourth largest armies in the</p>
<p>world. So this country is designed to fight with their own citizens. And the army, the</p>
<p>fourth largest in the world, is designed to basically fight its own people. Oppress their</p>
<p>own people. That&rsquo;s what North Korean military is about. Okay. Let me ask you some aspects</p>
<p>about North Korean life. Can you describe the songbun system of ascribed status used</p>
<p>in North Korea? Yeah. So that&rsquo;s a very interesting thing, right? Right now there are a lot of</p>
<p>people playing with this ideology of like democratic socialism, socialism, communism,</p>
<p>whatever you call it, Marxism, Leninism, right? They have all like these similar features</p>
<p>where we give collective power to a certain entity and they will make the decision for</p>
<p>bigger good, right? And North Korea came up with the idea, the Kim Il Sung. He was the</p>
<p>Leninist. He was a Marxist saying, I&rsquo;m going to create the most equal society on human</p>
<p>face. So it was communist North Korea. And then they came up with this songbun system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like family caste system. Three big categories, warrior, wavering, and hostile. And that in</p>
<p>between three classes, they divide into 50 different classes. So a lot of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know which exact class you belong to. That&rsquo;s a secret government document. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how they decide your future. So in a way, North Korea, before you&rsquo;re born, your life</p>
<p>is determined for you. And this is a joke, right? They dreamed of creating the most equal</p>
<p>society. They ended up with became most unequal society in the face of humanity. So there</p>
<p>are 50 different classes and where the one guy on the top became a god. So when this</p>
<p>animal farm, as we keep saying, like there&rsquo;s so many, all the animals are equal and some</p>
<p>of the animals are more equal than others. Exactly. But it&rsquo;s not only, it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>equal. One guy in North Korea became a god. So North Korea was born out of a Marxist ideals.</p>
<p>Yeah. From Stalin. Can you comment on Juche ideology, which seems to be its own kind of</p>
<p>socialism, but with unique aspects here, it really does ideologically says the importance</p>
<p>of having a great leader. Is there some interesting similarities or differences that you can comment</p>
<p>on between other implementations of communism throughout history, the Soviet Union, China,</p>
<p>elsewhere? So Juche is very unique. It came on around the 90s after Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
<p>So before that, North Korea was very still loyal to the Marxism and Leninism, which is</p>
<p>state takes care of you. We are going to give you the right education, healthcare, your</p>
<p>livelihood, everybody is going to be equal. You&rsquo;re going to have in the working collective</p>
<p>farm, collective worker place. Everybody collectively do things together and let&rsquo;s work for the</p>
<p>paradise. But 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. And until then, North Korea was heavily subsidized</p>
<p>by Soviet Union&rsquo;s aid. And then Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t give them anything. So not 3 million</p>
<p>people dying on the streets. The regime then came up with the idea, okay, our goal is what</p>
<p>is successful ruling for us is keeping the 10% of population alive, which is in the capital</p>
<p>Pyongyang. So they designed the hunger games. There is a capital, 13 other districts, everybody</p>
<p>on the countryside on purpose being starved. So those people who are starving cannot thinking</p>
<p>about meaning of life, cannot thinking about shooting to the moon, right? They&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to think about anything or they&rsquo;re going to think it&rsquo;s like finding next meal. All on</p>
<p>purpose. All on purpose is manmade famine. International community was begging to give</p>
<p>North Korea food. Why not? Still at the UN, they beg to give North Korea formula, medicine</p>
<p>and food. They are begging, can you please feed your people? And Kim Jong Un said, no,</p>
<p>thank you. Last year, like when North Korea had a horrible, horrible flooding, South Korean</p>
<p>president begging, can you get, can I give you please some medicines? Like, no, because</p>
<p>he wants to be the one provider. He doesn&rsquo;t want people to think other people giving him</p>
<p>the thing. So on purpose, other people are starving. And that Juche idea is that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from. So until that communism was about like state is being a father figure,</p>
<p>takes care of all your needs, right? Give the power to us and you&rsquo;re all good. But North</p>
<p>Korea regime says, okay, now we cannot give people&rsquo;s ration. So which means Juche means</p>
<p>self reliance. You need to take care of yourself while you&rsquo;re giving every right to us. So</p>
<p>now in the 90s, the regime told us, okay, we are not going to give you ration. You cannot</p>
<p>trade. That&rsquo;s illegal, but you find your own way to survive. So be self reliant. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what Juche is. But when you&rsquo;re a guy, you can do whatever you want. You don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>make a sense. That&rsquo;s the difference being a God and being a leader. When it is religion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for survival. You cannot challenge it. God&rsquo;s way is suspicious. God works in</p>
<p>a mysterious way. So when you&rsquo;re a God, people are not going to say, oh, this doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense, right? You&rsquo;re going to, okay, whatever God says, as a human being, we can never change</p>
<p>his thought. It&rsquo;s unbelievable what regimes can do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about famine that is another level of evil to me. What Stalin did in Ukraine</p>
<p>in the thirties, fuck them. This is what torture is. Cannibalism.</p>
<p>North Korea too, they eat humans right now in 21st century. 7 billion people on this</p>
<p>earth right now. You make enough food for 10 billion people. Nobody should be starving</p>
<p>right now. It&rsquo;s worrisome to me. The humanity is moving forward with the technological advance,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah. We are going so fast in advancement. And we are leaving this like</p>
<p>25 million human beings in the cage, completely leaving them behind. And North Korea is living</p>
<p>like 16 centuries. This morning I was taking shower, beautiful shower. One never knew what</p>
<p>shower was. I was bathing a few times a year, going to the river. How do they even know</p>
<p>what shampoo is? And this is how human beings in 21st century are living. And it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bother us. And rather, most people are obsessed being a vegan. How do you reconcile this?</p>
<p>I think we get used to stuff very quickly. We get used to comforts. That&rsquo;s just the way</p>
<p>of human life. You take the beautiful things for granted. So I try to appreciate everything</p>
<p>I have. So whether it&rsquo;s like the food I have now or like the luxury to have a diet and</p>
<p>be struggling with that. Or just the basic simple moments of being alive with the people</p>
<p>I love. Or actually I get like, I think I&rsquo;m on drugs all the time because I feel like</p>
<p>just even like this mug, everything on this table just brings me joy. But it&rsquo;s like filling</p>
<p>your life with joy in the full capitalistic American way, you can still at the same time</p>
<p>not feel too bad about yourself and still focus on the suffering in the world. And I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s some way that in trying to build a better world in America, it has ripple effects</p>
<p>elsewhere. Sort of like, so I&rsquo;m a fan of rockets in space. It sounds perhaps counterintuitive</p>
<p>but sending rockets to space will help solve the North Korea problem because it lets people</p>
<p>dream and build cool stuff. So it&rsquo;s not the rocket, it&rsquo;s the other people that are inspired</p>
<p>by the rocket and then look to other problems in the world. I mean, that&rsquo;s what Elon did</p>
<p>is like he saw problems in the world and thought like, what can I do to help it? And I think</p>
<p>the North Korea one is a tough one though, because that ultimately has to do with revolutionizing</p>
<p>government. We got to change China. That&rsquo;s what it takes. Changing China&rsquo;s Communist</p>
<p>Party is impossible. That&rsquo;s why we couldn&rsquo;t solve North Korea for that many decades. For</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s China, but it&rsquo;s China, it&rsquo;s Russia, it&rsquo;s certain aspects of the United States</p>
<p>and struggling with that. There&rsquo;s a bunch of technologies that are striving at this.</p>
<p>For example, I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts about cryptocurrencies. I love it. So like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a idea that money could be a way to destroy or to challenge the power centers</p>
<p>of the world. Yeah. So if you take away the power from fiat currency and give it to this</p>
<p>thing that can&rsquo;t be controlled by government, this cryptocurrency, whether it&rsquo;s Bitcoin,</p>
<p>Ethereum, all those kinds of things, that&rsquo;s a way to get money into the hands of people</p>
<p>to where the government can&rsquo;t take that money away. But North Koreans don&rsquo;t have electricity,</p>
<p>no internet. So we can do that with China. We can do it with a lot of African dictatorship</p>
<p>countries, right? I do think big cryptocurrency is such a fascinating technology, right? I</p>
<p>think this is an amazing experiment when that power is in our hands. I&rsquo;m a huge out of</p>
<p>game believer, but I think North Korea is too behind. I think that&rsquo;s what is unique</p>
<p>about North Korea is that most of the things that we talk about, it&rsquo;s a different planet</p>
<p>literally. The common law that we have is not applicable. What about Kim Jong Un?</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un, yeah. Is he intentionally evil or is he mindlessly propagating an evil system</p>
<p>created by his ancestors? What&rsquo;s your sense of the man?</p>
<p>So with Kim Il Sung, I can give him more benefit of that. He was a initial true believer of</p>
<p>communism. But then as later he gained the power, he realizing, I guess back then he</p>
<p>thought most of people are dumb, right? Individuals dumb. So therefore I need to make a decision</p>
<p>for all of you. That pure arrogance came from out of him. Even that I can tolerate. Okay,</p>
<p>fine. And Kim Jong Il, who never like, yeah, fine. He grew up in that system too. But Kim</p>
<p>Jong Un is very unique. This guy was educated in Switzerland in the heart of democracy.</p>
<p>He knew how human beings should be treated. As a child, he went, when you&rsquo;re a child,</p>
<p>your brain is very susceptible, right? It will change anybody. Like why the mall was</p>
<p>off, that&rsquo;s like changing young people&rsquo;s minds. Like that&rsquo;s every revolutionary they do, right?</p>
<p>They go change young people&rsquo;s minds first. This guy was so obsessed with power, him being</p>
<p>a God. Even starting in Switzerland didn&rsquo;t change him. And that&rsquo;s why I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a pure evil. I can give him more benefit of that to his grandfather and father. But when</p>
<p>it comes to Kim Jong Un, this is like what pure evil looks like. Pure selfish being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>Is there some sense where he&rsquo;s justifying everything he&rsquo;s doing to himself? Or do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a psychopathic aspect to where he enjoys the suffering?</p>
<p>I think in his life, right, I read a lot about like North Korea, a lot of CIA documents,</p>
<p>a lot of intelligence people worked there. And even like worked in North Korean type</p>
<p>elites and escaped. I could hear about them. So Kim Jong Un, when they are born, they treat</p>
<p>like gods. So they never have a sense of them being a human. They&rsquo;re like equal with the</p>
<p>others. For them, like we are just any kind of tool. Like that what Napoleon like thing</p>
<p>does, right? Anybody is a tool. Like once boxer dies, get him slaughtered for my cause.</p>
<p>And they do not even feel guilty about it because they don&rsquo;t view us that you deserve</p>
<p>your worthy of it. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. So it&rsquo;s not like he even feels, he doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>recognize that&rsquo;s a suffering. Like of course this is what you do serving me. Because I</p>
<p>am, I am this. So I think that&rsquo;s like beyond that. It&rsquo;s not like suffering enters his</p>
<p>mind. He doesn&rsquo;t even think what we go through. So he thinks of himself as a god. And then</p>
<p>everybody else is just tools that they&rsquo;re disposable. Right. There was rumors several</p>
<p>times of him dying. Yeah. Do you think he is, obviously his health is not good. Do you</p>
<p>think he will die soon? What happens if Kim Jong Un dies? Well, when it comes to North</p>
<p>Korea, anybody knows what they&rsquo;re going, what Kim Jong Un does is lie, right? Nobody knows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure CIA knows, but they may never reveal that. CIA has enough intelligence to can tell</p>
<p>where Kim Jong Un is, what he&rsquo;s doing. They just don&rsquo;t assassinate him because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see the means of it right now. Do you think they can assassinate him? They can. They do</p>
<p>have ability to get assassinated. Why the hell did they not assassinate him? Because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care. They don&rsquo;t care about the suffering of 25 million people. They got to</p>
<p>pay the price. If they assassinate Kim Jong Un, they got to pay the price afterwards.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be financial, there&rsquo;ll be political price to pay. It&rsquo;ll anger China. Absolutely.</p>
<p>That is a huge piece for them. And then they&rsquo;ll have to deal, obviously there&rsquo;ll be financial</p>
<p>and military consequences of having to deal with the turmoil, the uncertainty, the revolutions</p>
<p>that will spring up. Yeah. That&rsquo;s the thing. That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t want to take that risk.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to do anything. The US now became very passive when they pursue these</p>
<p>moral values to the rest of the world. They did the same thing with the Holocaust in the</p>
<p>early days, actually. Yeah. They didn&rsquo;t care. And that&rsquo;s what their policy has been. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care. So if Kim Jong Un dies, it&rsquo;s going to be very hard for North Korea to replace</p>
<p>anybody in his position because Kim&rsquo;s is a brand. It&rsquo;s not just a leader for us, right?</p>
<p>Whenever we think of Kim, who came with my mind, who&rsquo;s almost a God figure. North Korea</p>
<p>is the number 10 religion in the world. They copied the Bible. So if you believe that,</p>
<p>if there are people who believe in God and Jesus Christ, how do you not believe that</p>
<p>North Koreans believe in the same thing? So Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s grandfather and his parents</p>
<p>were devout Christians. So Kim Il Sung grew up this Christian like verses. So when he</p>
<p>finding his country, he said, I love my people so much that I&rsquo;m giving you my son Kim Jong</p>
<p>Il. His body dies, but his spirit is with us forever. Who can know how many here I have,</p>
<p>what I think. And when we suffer, we go to paradise with him. And when you block every</p>
<p>single information going to country, of course, people are going to believe it. So who would</p>
<p>be the successor if he dies? He has a son, first son born 2009 and not not old enough</p>
<p>if he dies now. So either his sister might rule for a short amount of time as not like</p>
<p>a leader, but like we like temporary placement. And then when the son is older enough, he</p>
<p>might take it off because it&rsquo;s a kingdom. That&rsquo;s most likely and China will do everything</p>
<p>they can to maintain that status quo for the North Korean regime. So North Korean people</p>
<p>have no option here. We just need some leader to courageously come up and do the right thing.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t just wait this out. No, we can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not something that takes its course</p>
<p>and then change. Like we not even know that economic freedom does not bring political</p>
<p>freedom. We know in China, it doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the unique thing about freedom. You got to</p>
<p>fight for it. Otherwise, you don&rsquo;t ever get it. Freedom is something that has to be fought.</p>
<p>And if nobody fighting for freedom, it&rsquo;s not going to be there.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about freedom? What does it mean to you? Having had, we talked</p>
<p>about love in that same way about freedom, having sort of discovered it later in life.</p>
<p>What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>I think every day I get a new definition of freedom. It is a never ending journey, having</p>
<p>this relationship with being free and what it means to be free, right? I think you definitely</p>
<p>can live life without being free and also happy life too. I saw a lot of North Korean</p>
<p>elites who are fat and have power, but didn&rsquo;t have freedom, were very happy. In a way, happier</p>
<p>than the people that I found in New York were like investment bankers and consultants in</p>
<p>Manhattan and 70% of them go like talk therapist. I was very confused. I remember writing my</p>
<p>book in New York. My editor was saying, Yami, you know you&rsquo;re traumatized. You need to go</p>
<p>talk to a therapist. I was like, what is therapy? What is trauma? Because in North Korea, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have word for stress or trauma because how can you be stressed in a socialist paradise?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t let you be knowing what that is. Then they were like, yeah, hearing people</p>
<p>having problems, go talk to therapist. I was like, how much is it? $200 per hour and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a discounted rate too. I was like, no, thank you. We know that freedom comes with responsibility</p>
<p>and in a way, it&rsquo;s not that easy to be free, thinking for yourself constantly. In a way,</p>
<p>I understand. Let&rsquo;s give government every power we have. Let them decide what education</p>
<p>that I get. Let them decide where I live. Let someone figure that out for me. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how North Korea began, hoping the government is going to represent my own interests, believing</p>
<p>that they were good. With that benefit of doubt and good faith, it began the nightmare.</p>
<p>Freedom is not like a gateway to be happy at all. In a way, it can make life a lot more</p>
<p>complex, but then it&rsquo;s fun, isn&rsquo;t it? You start thinking for yourself. You start making</p>
<p>mistakes. It&rsquo;s so fun to be free, even though you can be suffering way more than the people</p>
<p>who are not free.</p>
<p>The thing about freedom is when you have freedom, you also have the responsibility for your</p>
<p>actions. That could be a huge burden because if you succeed, it&rsquo;s you, but if you fail,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you. If you do horrible things, it&rsquo;s you. If you don&rsquo;t do something, for example,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t help people in North Korea, it&rsquo;s you. That&rsquo;s a huge burden. Living with that</p>
<p>burden is a kind of suffering. There&rsquo;s some aspect in which freedom is suffering.</p>
<p>It is suffering.</p>
<p>Because life is suffering, and then freedom is you as an individual fully living through</p>
<p>that. See, you talked, you&rsquo;re friends with Michael Malice. He believes, and so I want</p>
<p>to kind of ask you about government. He believes, he&rsquo;s an anarchist, and he believes kind of</p>
<p>in freedom fully implemented in human societies, meaning that humans should all be free to</p>
<p>choose how they, you know, transact with each other, how they live together. There shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be a centralized force that tells you what to do. Do you think there&rsquo;s some role for</p>
<p>government in a healthy society?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If we look at North Korea, there&rsquo;s the most horrible implementation of government, but</p>
<p>then if we look at what the United States strives to be, at least in principle, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an ideal of a government that represents the people and helps the people. Is there a place</p>
<p>for that kind of ideal, or is government always going to get us into trouble?</p>
<p>I am not, I mean, I spoke to Michael Malice. I kept asking why he&rsquo;s an anarchist, right?</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t even believe in military, none of that thing. And I was like, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I want to be in that world you&rsquo;re describing. That&rsquo;s pretty scary. I want the law enforcement.</p>
<p>I want like, I don&rsquo;t, in a way that, so why equality makes no sense is that the fact that</p>
<p>when you and I were born, we were born in a very different capability of thinking, different</p>
<p>intelligence, different capability in our physics, right? So equality is nonsense. You</p>
<p>can never achieve that, right? So to me, that&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s very scary in America.</p>
<p>When the government tries to enforce.</p>
<p>To make equality on everybody, that is impossible.</p>
<p>Specifically equality of outcome. So like, so given that we all started different places,</p>
<p>enforce, like measure in some kind of way where people stand, and if they&rsquo;re an equal,</p>
<p>enforce equality. And that&rsquo;s what leads to the kind of things that you mentioned with</p>
<p>the class system in North Korea.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I think that&rsquo;s why government can be bad. They can be very dumb. And another</p>
<p>thing is that they cannot know what you want. A lot of times people don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>they want as an individual. Like how the heck do you assume government is going to know</p>
<p>what is best for you? Nobody knows. We just all do our best. I do think though some governments</p>
<p>like in Switzerland, you know, have more power, give power to the different state can be good.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m more, you know, like giving power to the state and let individual decide where</p>
<p>they want to go in within states. Like, I mean, why did you choose Texas, right? There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no income tax, right? Like there&rsquo;s a lot of things people find Texas, like, you know,</p>
<p>charming and they come here. So in a way that I don&rsquo;t want to be in a one strong government</p>
<p>that makes every single thing the same way. In a way, I want to kind of experiment to</p>
<p>everything. We can have anarchy state. There&rsquo;s no police, nothing going on. You can be whatever</p>
<p>you want. And you can go to a state where it&rsquo;s like abortion is bad, blah, blah, this</p>
<p>is bad. All this like conservative values. And let the ideas compete and let them how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being practiced in real life. But I think it&rsquo;s very scary when the US government</p>
<p>is getting bigger and bigger and then they try to make every state under one big government.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like when I get really alarmed.</p>
<p>Are there things that you see in the United States in the current culture that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of has echoes of the same things you saw in North Korea that worry you?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It&rsquo;s in America now the meritocracy doesn&rsquo;t matter, right? It&rsquo;s evil. The white</p>
<p>man&rsquo;s idea of talking about if you&rsquo;re competent enough, they say, oh, if you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>rich white family, you are going to be competent. So other people don&rsquo;t have a chance. But look</p>
<p>at Asians who came from nothing as competent and go to Harvard Law School and medical school.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t almost is like there&rsquo;s no incentive for you to work hard anymore in the system</p>
<p>right now. That is North Korea. There&rsquo;s no incentive because you are born with your class</p>
<p>already. So no matter what you do, you can never. So the horrible thing about North Korean</p>
<p>system is that there&rsquo;s nothing holding Mary up. So if you&rsquo;re coming from other cultures</p>
<p>that like Meghan Markle joined the royal family and she became a lawyer, you go up by North</p>
<p>Korea. If someone from high class going to marry somebody down, you only go down with</p>
<p>them. That&rsquo;s how they prevent class mix.</p>
<p>Right. That kind of enforces the separation because there&rsquo;s a huge disincentives to go</p>
<p>to marry to integrate between classes. What do you do about this kind of, you know, especially</p>
<p>universities, but in companies, I&rsquo;m thinking about starting a company. So I&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>this very carefully. There&rsquo;s these ideas of diversity and meritocracy. That&rsquo;s a tension.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a big way in which diversity broadly defined is not at all in a tension</p>
<p>with meritocracy. So having a variety of people, backgrounds, way of thinking, all those kinds</p>
<p>of things is a huge benefit to any group. But the way diversity is often defined is</p>
<p>by sort of very crude classes of people, whether it&rsquo;s by skin color or gender or some very</p>
<p>kind of large group way. And that actually does two things in my mind. One, it drowns</p>
<p>out real diversity or not real, but the full spectrum of diversity, which is like within</p>
<p>class diversity of like, are you somebody who is exceptionally good at mathematics?</p>
<p>Are you somebody who&rsquo;s exceptionally good at psychology? Are you good with people? Are</p>
<p>you good with numbers? All that kind of stuff that I think spans or intersects in fascinating</p>
<p>ways with these kinds of groups. So that&rsquo;s diversity. And then meritocracy is this thing</p>
<p>that probably the reason I wanted to move to Silicon Valley and the reason I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is like having a fire to change the world within you. Like meritocracy is like, I want</p>
<p>to be the best in the world at this and I will strive and work hard, not stepping on</p>
<p>others, but like purely within yourself, be the best version of yourself. That idea is</p>
<p>in some ways being not celebrated or demonized. It&rsquo;s literally meritocracy is being demonized</p>
<p>right now in America. Working hard is a symbol of you coming from some established family.</p>
<p>The fact that you celebrate accomplishment, hard work is a sign of your patriarchal,</p>
<p>whatever thing they call it. And they want to abolish that. They want to like stop giving</p>
<p>kids grades. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re already doing, right? They want to stop. They want to like</p>
<p>we should abolish like SAT in America they take to go to college, right? They won&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>abolish that. Yeah, some kids have no ability to do math. So why do we have to force them</p>
<p>to learn math? And that&rsquo;s what comes with humans overcome challenges. That&rsquo;s what makes</p>
<p>us special. But then like, because it&rsquo;s kids coming from this family, let&rsquo;s find a reason</p>
<p>why they cannot, and then they don&rsquo;t have to do that thing. But they still deserve the</p>
<p>same job. They need to be a lawyer and doctors. And that&rsquo;s like what in North Korea was like</p>
<p>not, there was not even meritocracy beginning with, right? Did you born in the same family,</p>
<p>the family, the blood, right? Like if one person does something wrong, it&rsquo;s like collective</p>
<p>guilt. Because I spoke out, three generations of my family got punished, who I left behind.</p>
<p>And then in America, I see the same thing. Like if you&rsquo;re somehow great, great grandfather</p>
<p>on the slave, now you are privileged and you&rsquo;re guilty because you are white and guilt. But</p>
<p>how do you change your ancestor? How did you have a saying on it? And that is where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way out. There&rsquo;s no forgiving, there&rsquo;s no moving forwards. And this current culture</p>
<p>in America now, like I remember at Columbia, like before class, everybody had to go around</p>
<p>saying, tell us what your pronoun is. And my English, my third language, I learned as</p>
<p>an adult. Even saying he and she, I&rsquo;m confused. It&rsquo;s a pure mistake. And they say, call me</p>
<p>they, because I&rsquo;m gender fluid. Basically, I can be a girl, but next hour you talk to</p>
<p>me, I&rsquo;m a boy, right? And if you don&rsquo;t do it right, they like look at you, why are you</p>
<p>doing it? Right? It makes me so nervous. And this is where I come to, this is a regression</p>
<p>of civilization. We are regressing as a humanity here. Like the enlightenment, all of those</p>
<p>things made us so much brighter and looking forward. And now we are going backwards.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a pendulum aspect to it because it&rsquo;s my hope in terms of backwards.</p>
<p>So pendulum goes backwards too, but it just goes back and forth, I think. And then in</p>
<p>the long arc of history, we&rsquo;re making progress. I think all of the discussions of diversity</p>
<p>and inclusion and all those kinds of things, I always thought that they&rsquo;re healthy in moderation.</p>
<p>They should be a small part of the conversation amongst other things. The natural aspect,</p>
<p>it seems that they kind of have this way of just consuming all conversations. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the meetings, like diversity and inclusion meetings multiply somehow, where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the only thing that you&rsquo;re talking about. And it&rsquo;s very kind of absurd. And when I look</p>
<p>at, even at MIT, it&rsquo;s a strangely disproportionate amount of discussions about that. And also</p>
<p>to me as an engineer, those discussions are very frustrating because they don&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>actually do anything. So they want to bully people instead of creating systems that fix</p>
<p>definitive problems. And that in itself, that kind of bullying, that&rsquo;s the same kind of</p>
<p>thing you saw in terms of McCarthyism in America against the communists. You certainly saw</p>
<p>that in Soviet Union against everybody who&rsquo;s not communist. It creates hate, not progress.</p>
<p>When you talked to Jordan Peterson recently, and people should listen to that conversation,</p>
<p>it was a fascinating one. I think he almost got emotional on the discussion about universities</p>
<p>and your experience with Columbia because he, like myself, for perhaps different reasons,</p>
<p>have a hope for our academic institutions. Some of the most incredible people, some of</p>
<p>the most incredible engineering and idea development, innovation happens in universities. And so</p>
<p>we both deeply care about them. Is there something, so the reason he got emotional, the reason</p>
<p>he was kind of hurt is the fact that you did not, you were not deeply inspired by your</p>
<p>experience at Columbia.</p>
<p>It made me dumber. It made me scared. It made me terrified that I had to censor myself in</p>
<p>America. Are you seriously telling me that you don&rsquo;t ever censor yourself? Can you truly</p>
<p>say whatever you want about race, about anything, gender? We all censor ourselves. Let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>honest, right? We are all doing that. And that&rsquo;s what I learned. I thought I was coming</p>
<p>to a country where never needed, like first thing my mom taught me growing up in North</p>
<p>Korea was, don&rsquo;t even whisper because the birds and mice could hear you. And I thought,</p>
<p>okay, now America is truly the land of the free, home of the brave. You can say anything</p>
<p>you want, and then you have freedom to change your mind and evolve. But the people now demand</p>
<p>you to be the perfect version they demand you to be. You cannot change your mind. And</p>
<p>then what is the meaning of life if you cannot grow? You should feel safe to talk about anything,</p>
<p>and then later, okay, I was wrong. But now if you do that, you got to get penalized</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>I mean, censorship is a funny thing because you probably should not say dumb things. You</p>
<p>should try to say things you want to say in the most eloquent, the most effective way</p>
<p>you can. So, I mean, that&rsquo;s what editing is, right? So there&rsquo;s some level of like being</p>
<p>careful with what you say, not because you&rsquo;re afraid of some overarching kind of group of</p>
<p>bullies, but you want to be the best version of yourself when you express stuff. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some sense where in the university setting, you can put that self censorship like level</p>
<p>down more and say stupid stuff and explain and play because you should be forgiven for</p>
<p>that kind of play, especially when you&rsquo;re discussing difficult aspects of human history,</p>
<p>whether that include racism, that include atrocities. I&rsquo;m still nevertheless sort of</p>
<p>hopeful, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m surrounded by engineers. So I don&rsquo;t get to interact with</p>
<p>people in humanities much. And it seems like there&rsquo;s getting worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing. It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know. Well, I do sort of interact with psychologists, but they haven&rsquo;t touched</p>
<p>on those kinds of topics yet. I still, sort of in defense of psychology, I still, I wish</p>
<p>I had more numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I still feel like most psychology people don&rsquo;t partake in this kind of stuff either.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing excellent research. We&rsquo;re just highlighting, this is what America does</p>
<p>well. You&rsquo;re kind of highlighting anecdotal experiences and making a big deal out of them.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s good because like it&rsquo;s a slippery slope. If those things start to overtake all</p>
<p>of academia, it starts becoming a big problem, even in the engineering field. So we should</p>
<p>be concerned. But it is truly tragic that somebody who&rsquo;s exceptionally well read like</p>
<p>you, whose fire was stoked first with Orwell, that fire should burn bright. Like this should</p>
<p>not be, you should be writing many books. You know what I mean? Like, and you&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>you talk to Jordan, you know, it&rsquo;s very possible depending what you want to do with your life</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be a future Jordan Peterson, right? So like that, and Columbia should be a place</p>
<p>that enriches your mind. And the fact that it didn&rsquo;t is tragic.</p>
<p>I mean, I did the same. It&rsquo;s like I was there four years. It wasn&rsquo;t like I had a one class</p>
<p>that was bad in a one semester. That was the thing. When Dr. Piro was asking, is there</p>
<p>any one class that had no sentiment of this virtue, signoring, politically right? There</p>
<p>was none. Entire course, I think I took 126 credits total. Not even one class. Doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter we were talking about classic art. And that&rsquo;s the thing. I literally thought,</p>
<p>okay, I pushed the last semester to call like the art and music, right? So I thought this</p>
<p>is going to be the least politically correct class I can take. And then it begins with</p>
<p>who has problem with calling this course the Western civilization of art and music. And</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like raising their hands. Because like, why do we have to learning about this</p>
<p>Beethoven, Mozart, the bigots, and all the people, like, you know, everything ruined</p>
<p>by white men. And it&rsquo;s even music, even these paintings. And as I didn&rsquo;t raise my hand,</p>
<p>everyone was looking at me. How do you not have the problem with this? Like you should</p>
<p>hate this, you&rsquo;re Asian. So I think that&rsquo;s the thing is I think the problems are way</p>
<p>deeper than what people think. And that&rsquo;s what when I learned is like, it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>safe in America, we can go complete to the south. And looking at even Europe, that is</p>
<p>like, I used to be way more optimistic. But now I actually see, wow, this country can</p>
<p>go to south. And we might, if US forced them, right, this is the only country left to battle</p>
<p>with the Communist Party in China. We may lose the opportunity to be free ever again</p>
<p>as a humanity.</p>
<p>Wow. So I mean, that puts a lot of value on having these kinds of conversations. It</p>
<p>is, I mean, I&rsquo;m troubled. I&rsquo;m troubled by a lot of things. But like censorship on YouTube,</p>
<p>for example. Yeah, it was very annoying to have to listen to Donald Trump all the time.</p>
<p>Just like create drama, like news cycle was completely drowned out by Donald Trump. But</p>
<p>like banning him from Twitter, it was like, that was scary for me, because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a step towards a direction where you&rsquo;re going to, like, where does that take us? You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to silence people, then it&rsquo;s like Jordan Peterson is next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to promote freedom of thinking and speech, right? And the one thing that</p>
<p>I love about Dr. Peterson is, he&rsquo;s a psychologist, right? He talks about we think by talking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when you go to therapy, you talk and then you hear yourself and then you think</p>
<p>and you come up to the answer. It&rsquo;s so important for humans to talk so we can think. So when</p>
<p>they say you cannot talk means you cannot think. And they don&rsquo;t know the consequences</p>
<p>of that. And this is why I promote, I want the freedom of speech, even though it hurts,</p>
<p>ridiculous, you know, sometimes it can be dangerous. But the price, the alternative</p>
<p>is so bad that we should take the, you know, make this trade off. Everything has a trade</p>
<p>off in this world. And it comes with a sacrifice, right? So I think that&rsquo;s what I want to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to see in America. But it&rsquo;s unfortunately like the people like you</p>
<p>say, who decides what is hate speech? What is dangerous? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been getting</p>
<p>scared. Because everybody&rsquo;s imperfect. How do we want to give that power to them? And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to decide, today they might agree with me, say, okay, your speech is good,</p>
<p>promotes good, and then they might come back next year and say your speech is bad. What</p>
<p>are you going to do when that happens to you? We have to almost like get ideas out and then</p>
<p>play with them. I think what&rsquo;s a really important component of that is forgiving each other</p>
<p>for like realizing that we&rsquo;re a different person day by day and certainly years later.</p>
<p>And I think some of that is both cultural mechanisms of saying like we forgive each</p>
<p>other for wrong ideas or not wrong ideas, but for who we are, the full evolution of</p>
<p>the human being, for the steps we&rsquo;ve taken on that evolution, and also creating mechanisms</p>
<p>that allow you to allow us to forgive each other. Like, for example, on Twitter is like</p>
<p>horrible with this because one of the main viral ways that people create drama on Twitter</p>
<p>is like pulling up an old tweet that somebody said, right? And then saying, oh, this is</p>
<p>the guy that thinks that. But that&rsquo;s like the opposite of the mechanisms we need to</p>
<p>forgive ourselves, forgive each other for the things we&rsquo;ve said in the past. And so</p>
<p>part of that is the cultural, part of this is the technological mechanisms. You mentioned</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson. You had a great conversation with him. What was chatting with him like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious because he&rsquo;s deeply passionate, especially on the Soviet Union side about</p>
<p>the atrocities of these kinds of systems. What was it like? What did you agree with</p>
<p>him on? What did you disagree? What were some things you both kind of learned from each</p>
<p>other through that conversation, do you think? So here, so my story, the Jordan</p>
<p>Peterson, a very long one. So one day I was walking down in Chicago, and they were like</p>
<p>huge theater was sold out. It says a big letter, Jordan Peterson sold out. And then it was</p>
<p>a huge theater in the middle of Chicago, right? Like, this is my comedian, like who can be</p>
<p>selling this entire thing out at like 7pm? And then with my ex husband, we were walking</p>
<p>the street. And then we saw people were like selling this like tickets, like for a very</p>
<p>higher price, right? And then do you want to take it? And then he was like, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>We went in, it&rsquo;s packed. And then I was just happy birth or like, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to</p>
<p>understand his English that much. My English was still bad. And you didn&rsquo;t know who he</p>
<p>was really? No, no. You were just curious? Yeah, it was like 2018. Who&rsquo;s the guy that</p>
<p>sells out a thing? A theater? Yeah. Yes, I saw Dave Rubin came out before him and make</p>
<p>jokes. I still don&rsquo;t know who Dave Rubin is. Afterwards, I met them all. But back then</p>
<p>I had no clue what that is. And then he was giving lessons. But what I got from that night</p>
<p>was not what Jordan said, but what people did on the audience. These people like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, thousands of people in this big theater, crying like babies. And that was like, whatever</p>
<p>that guy is doing is very special, right? He wasn&rsquo;t like making any jokes. He had no</p>
<p>slides, just a one simple person standing in the huge, giant theater talk. And long</p>
<p>time too. And people cry as like, wow, okay, whatever that is, I gotta check it out. And</p>
<p>then I got home. And then later, many years later, I got a book. And I will start reading</p>
<p>his book. And it talks about, it explains so much, right? Like now at Columbia, I learned</p>
<p>like everything gender is like made up concept, construct, like the hierarchy is my man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>idea of making the hierarchy. And then he begins with the number one, the laughsers</p>
<p>had the hierarchies, evolution of history that is within us, that we want a hierarchy,</p>
<p>right? And then chapter five about socialization of child, you know, how do you raise them?</p>
<p>And all of it, and then what&rsquo;s why telling the truth is matters, right? And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>white, like in his entire 12 lessons, I read it and it&rsquo;s like, I was so grateful that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>alive with this. There&rsquo;s people always say, if Socrates is alive, how much would you pay</p>
<p>to have lunch with him? That kind of thing, right? So for me it was like, okay, I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>alive in the same contemporary world as one of the greatest thinkers of my entire generation.</p>
<p>And then like, how much money would I pay? No limit amount. And I like reached out to</p>
<p>Michaela on her podcast on Twitter and connected. And then one day she said, do you want to</p>
<p>be on Michaela&rsquo;s podcast? I was like, what? I was like, of course. And I was very nervous,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be like that connected. Cause I thought he was a psychologist, like</p>
<p>he saw so much suffering in the world. He studied Soviet Union, his hobbies collecting</p>
<p>those things to remind him of the suffering of a human being. So sometimes some people</p>
<p>hear so much atrocity, they become like very, you know, not engaged.</p>
<p>Yeah, desensitized.</p>
<p>Desensitized.</p>
<p>He felt, he was feeling, he was, it&rsquo;s almost like he was living through the experiences</p>
<p>with you as you were talking about it. It was an amazing conversation. So Jordan is</p>
<p>one of the great thinkers of our time, but I would say the greatest thinkers of our time</p>
<p>is Michael Malus. So you&rsquo;ve also got a chance to talk to him. So he wrote a book on North</p>
<p>Korea. It&rsquo;s an interesting style book. I learned a lot from it. I learned a lot from Michael</p>
<p>about it. And it&rsquo;s interesting that he chose North Korea as a thing to study. That he,</p>
<p>of all people, this fascinating human being that is Michael, chose this darkest of aspects</p>
<p>of humanity to study. What do you think of Michael? What do you think of his book on</p>
<p>North Korea called Dear Reader that people should definitely check out?</p>
<p>Absolutely. So back then, when I reached out to Michael through mutual friends in South</p>
<p>Korea, my English wasn&rsquo;t good. So I got a copy in my hand. I tried to read and a lot</p>
<p>of them I didn&rsquo;t understand. So, but I thought it was very fascinating how he explained North</p>
<p>Korea through the Dear Leader&rsquo;s perspective, right? Nobody has ever done that. And you</p>
<p>can reveal so much about the state and absurdity of the entire situation. And also through</p>
<p>humor. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s amazing about Michael. He knows the full gravity of tragedy. He knows</p>
<p>the full suffering. He&rsquo;s not just like people here in America on the BuzzFeed making fun</p>
<p>of Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s haircut. They don&rsquo;t care what people go through. Michael cares.</p>
<p>Deeply cares. And then he still does ridiculous jokes. So that kind of reveals in a dark way</p>
<p>the absurdity of evil. And he does that masterfully. Do you?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a genius. He is definitely a genius.</p>
<p>All right. If he watches this, let&rsquo;s not make his head too big here. But is there some</p>
<p>aspect to, I mean, there is an absurdity to the whole thing. Kim Jong Un is this, I mean,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s almost like a caricature of evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>A lot of people think it&rsquo;s a joke. They just think like, this is too, too absurd. They</p>
<p>just, they laugh. Like, can you imagine you laugh at Holocaust? This is that ridiculous.</p>
<p>Can you maybe psychoanalyze that a little bit? Because that&rsquo;s where my mind goes to.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s so ridiculous that you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s almost like hard to believe this is real.</p>
<p>Is that just, is that just my kind of and people&rsquo;s desire to escape the cruelty of reality</p>
<p>by just kind of making a joke out of it?</p>
<p>I think it is a few things, right? Like, so North Korea as a nation, number one or number</p>
<p>two smartest IQ people in the world, despite their malnutrition. So&hellip;</p>
<p>So there is, I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting point. So in your sense, the people&hellip;</p>
<p>Are not dumb.</p>
<p>Still carry the sort of the brilliance. There&rsquo;s a culture there that&rsquo;s like hungry to become</p>
<p>realized. Like the people that are silenced by the electricity, by the actually having</p>
<p>no food, all those kinds of things. Like, if you add the electricity, if you add the</p>
<p>food, you&rsquo;re going to have a cultural center of the world.</p>
<p>Like South Korea. That&rsquo;s what they exactly did, right? The exact same Korea. One became</p>
<p>like 11th largest economy. One became the world&rsquo;s most like poorest nation, right? And</p>
<p>this is a perfect example. Like if, I don&rsquo;t know if you read that book, Why Nation Fails.</p>
<p>The system. It&rsquo;s not about a culture. It is not about people. It is not about IQ. What</p>
<p>makes us too different is a system. South Korea, North Korea is a perfect example of</p>
<p>that. One is exact same capability. We are a homogeneous country, same language, tradition,</p>
<p>all of that. We gave them different system. One is free democracy, one is dictatorship</p>
<p>and came up with the biggest different result. And I think North Korea reveals that to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because we are great that we are living in this prosperity. Free market. The</p>
<p>ideas gave us to this. The system we built, our ancestors built, gave us this privilege.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not us. Nothing is about us being special here, right? The system that we have is quite</p>
<p>special. And North Korea proves that to us. It doesn&rsquo;t matter even if you&rsquo;re smart. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all irrelevant. And I think that&rsquo;s why people just keep denying that they want to feel special.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m awesome, I got all of this. No, it&rsquo;s not you, you got this. And when people</p>
<p>say, I hate capitalism. I was like, without capitalism, how do you came up with this thing?</p>
<p>Literally, how did you come up with this?</p>
<p>The systems matter. And they matter way more than this individualistic society would like</p>
<p>to imagine. It is the most important thing you can have in life. Choosing the right system.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people today? You&rsquo;ve lived an incredible life and you have,</p>
<p>I hope, an incredible life ahead of you. What advice would you give to young people today,</p>
<p>high schoolers, college students, how to be successful in their career or maybe successful</p>
<p>in life?</p>
<p>Last thing I want them to feel is guilty. It doesn&rsquo;t do anything, right? So I hate when</p>
<p>people talk about, oh, why guilt? It&rsquo;s like, that doesn&rsquo;t make even any sense, right? I</p>
<p>think the fact that they are born with freedom is a blessing for all of us. It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>I want them to want to do something because they are guilty. I want them to do something</p>
<p>because they are grateful. It is true. Like we are sitting here, the fact why I have children</p>
<p>is suffering, having kids you don&rsquo;t sleep, costly, like so much work. Like any like logical</p>
<p>rational mind, you should never want children, right? Why would you do that to yourself?</p>
<p>Especially as a woman, right? You don&rsquo;t want to do that to yourself. But think about like</p>
<p>we are sitting here today, two of us in this amazing technology, this country, because</p>
<p>somebody in Savannah hundreds of thousands of years ago, they&rsquo;re hunting berries and</p>
<p>surviving cold. Every suffering they can imagine, they fall for us. That&rsquo;s why we ended up here.</p>
<p>So life is ultimately bigger than us. And I think that&rsquo;s what I want them. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like I want them to do the right thing and be the best version of themselves. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I want them to feel grateful. And we should be grateful for the freedom and then take</p>
<p>full advantage of that. I mean, it starts with the freedom to experience everything</p>
<p>in life. And for your life, literally, like how my father, like, you know, working, dying</p>
<p>is a lot easier than living. Dying takes like few minutes, right? Maximum. And living takes</p>
<p>forever. So when I was facing this unbelievable challenge, I thought, okay, this most rational</p>
<p>thing I can do is killing myself right now. But the hardest thing I can choose is choose</p>
<p>to live. And my father did that. Even in the concentration camp, even no matter why he</p>
<p>said, life is a gift. You need to fight for it. And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing here,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t think life as a gift. It&rsquo;s a gift. Like, how many people had to fight</p>
<p>for me to be here today? Think about the sacrifice they made for many, many, many generations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what they went through. I can&rsquo;t even fathom what they went through.</p>
<p>They fought for life. Yeah. And that is my responsibility enough. So it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>them, their fight was not meaningless, right? It meant something because now I&rsquo;m carrying</p>
<p>on that fight. You mentioned considering suicide. Do you think about your mortality now? Now</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re perhaps in a slightly more comfortable place, do you still think about death? I do</p>
<p>because I was informed actually when I was 21 that I was on the killing list of Kim Jong</p>
<p>Un by South Korean intelligence. And then I had to live with that, right? But now I</p>
<p>actually feel more because, I don&rsquo;t know, you follow Jamal Khashoggi&rsquo;s story, the Saudi</p>
<p>journalist who got chopped off in Turkey embassy, right? His reason why he got killed was he</p>
<p>became very prominent on Twitter. He had a huge voice and Saudis followed him. Now I</p>
<p>became very first North Korean to have this many social media followings. And recently</p>
<p>North Korea started an investigation team to analyze whatever I do, even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first time for them. So they don&rsquo;t even know what to do at this point. They&rsquo;re like, this</p>
<p>is so new. What do we do? We do Kim Jong Nam. Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of Kim</p>
<p>Jong Un got killed in Malaysia. That is another tragedy that I feel so sorry for the US government</p>
<p>is that Kim Jong Nam was giving information to the CIA for the past like 10 years. That</p>
<p>trip, when he got killed in Malaysian airport, he was meeting up with the CIA agent for two</p>
<p>days on the Northern Ireland. CIA could have protected him. They didn&rsquo;t. They let him die.</p>
<p>Who killed him?</p>
<p>North Korean Kim Jong Un killed him. Do you know the Malaysian, the ladies, the VX, the</p>
<p>nerve agent. North Koreans killed him in Malaysian airport, in the international land. So I mean</p>
<p>North Korea, who was a US resident and the Washington Post journalist, when he got killed</p>
<p>in Saudi like a lamb, they chopped him into pieces. In that most inhumane death, what</p>
<p>was the consequences for the Saudis? Nothing. The word is we think we live in a country</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no justice. There is no accountability for killing any dissent, no matter how big</p>
<p>their names are.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think your vast and quickly growing social media presence protects you?</p>
<p>No, it does the opposite. Because Kim Jong Un, initially when I spoke out, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you went through it, they did everything they could to character assassinate me, saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a liar, I&rsquo;m a CIA spy, I get paid. And then they reached out to Penguin saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to blow up. You cannot write this book. And they did it with Sony. They</p>
<p>had a Sony studio for making that stupid movie interview. And then Penguin did their</p>
<p>investigation. They met every survivor that I went through in the desert. They got the</p>
<p>voice recordings of them because they don&rsquo;t want them to change their mind later. People</p>
<p>remember differently. So they got the voice recordings, the Penguin Regal team got all</p>
<p>the audios, and now we are ready for the lawsuit. We are going to publish this book because</p>
<p>we checked, verified every single thing that was going in the book. And North Korea couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything anymore.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s character assassination. Which by the way, that&rsquo;s a whole other conversation</p>
<p>that you were able to survive that. I appreciate the kind of strength it requires to survive</p>
<p>that because you don&rsquo;t know. And your character being assassinated is in some ways can be</p>
<p>as painful as actual assassination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse. It&rsquo;s worse. Everybody think you&rsquo;re a liar. Everybody think you&rsquo;re a liar. And</p>
<p>now everybody, like you said, this nature of internet is that as long as something is</p>
<p>written in the internet, they think that&rsquo;s a fact. Any stupid person can start a blog</p>
<p>and write about you. But they think, oh, because it&rsquo;s written on the internet, it&rsquo;s legit.</p>
<p>Especially negative stuff. That&rsquo;s the thing I was kind of trying to elaborate on. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a viral aspect to calling somebody a fraud or a liar that nobody questions whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true or not. It just spreads. And it&rsquo;s a dark side of our human nature that we want to destroy</p>
<p>the people who are rising.</p>
<p>We cannot stand it. Any change maker in this world who wasn&rsquo;t controversial, right? Martin</p>
<p>Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, he was called as a terrorist. So I just did not know.</p>
<p>The character assassination is the thing. It&rsquo;ll probably continue with you.</p>
<p>It will continue with me forever.</p>
<p>So you have to get stronger and stronger, I think, in the face of that. But actual assassination,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s me being hopeful because I have a situation with Russia that I hope I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>under. Well, I don&rsquo;t care actually. But there&rsquo;s some aspect in which social media presence,</p>
<p>I thought, protects you a little bit. Because just imagine the outrage from an attempted</p>
<p>assassination of you.</p>
<p>But what was the outrage when Jamal Khashoggi got killed like that?</p>
<p>Was the social media presence large?</p>
<p>Over one million people. I don&rsquo;t have that following. He was 1.6 million Twitter followers.</p>
<p>And the outrage wasn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>No. Because Saudis spoke to Amazon, to Prime Studio, Netflix. There were people who made</p>
<p>a documentary about him but told everybody cannot get that deal. So there was a huge</p>
<p>censorship on that. And people, of course, I mean, they can talk about it one day. Some</p>
<p>dissent from Saudi got killed. Horrible.</p>
<p>But it just dissipates.</p>
<p>They move on to the next cute puppy, right? The next cute cat. That&rsquo;s what the nature</p>
<p>of this new generation does. They desensitize. It doesn&rsquo;t affect them. They keep following</p>
<p>the instant pleasure, instant high. That&rsquo;s what Instagram does to you. It changes your</p>
<p>brain. That&rsquo;s what I was reading. We spoke about shallows. We became shallow and shallow</p>
<p>and our brain changed permanently. So this new generation, we can get them angry for</p>
<p>like 10 minutes, create hashtags for one day. But then as quick as that was, it goes down</p>
<p>like instantly. And I think that&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, that means that&hellip; Okay. So that means that there is&hellip; It&rsquo;s an effective way to</p>
<p>get rid of opposition is by murdering them. And that means United States, if it stands</p>
<p>for freedom, if it stands for the freedom of exchange of ideas, should be protecting</p>
<p>people like you.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t want to be involved. They didn&rsquo;t even protect Kim</p>
<p>Jong Nam who was giving information 10 years risking his life. That&rsquo;s what is so&hellip; I</p>
<p>mean, working for CIA is not bad. The thing is that he was giving information to bring</p>
<p>down the regime. That is valuable. That is something noble about him. But then you just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go extra miles to that. That&rsquo;s when I lost my faith in the US system as well.</p>
<p>Like this country just cares about saving face. What is most the minimum cost they pay</p>
<p>for anything? And when I was in South Korea, constantly, every single day intelligence</p>
<p>calling me. The North Korean agent going this place, where are you going? The US system</p>
<p>came to US, nobody. That&rsquo;s when people said, are you a CIA agent? I wish they called me.</p>
<p>I wish they called me. I really truly do. But nobody, nobody does here. I&rsquo;m sure they</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s going on. But the South Korean agent is more like, oh my gosh, we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you to get killed as a South Korean citizen, right? Yeah. And now I&rsquo;m trying to become</p>
<p>your citizen. So it&rsquo;s in a way, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s worse. Are you afraid for your</p>
<p>life? I was afraid. For the several, three, four years, I was afraid. But I had to come</p>
<p>to terms with it. Like my enemy is not some crazy psychopath. It&rsquo;s a state with nuclear</p>
<p>power to attack the most powerful country. If Kim Jong Un decides if I die, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to die. It&rsquo;s not up to me, right? So in a way, also it&rsquo;s liberating that you, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you are like afraid of some mobs or some like gangsters on the street, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like you have power over a little bit. You got to be like thinking that&rsquo;s my fault. I</p>
<p>went that way, right? But when it comes to Kim Jong Un, I know like my enemy is so much</p>
<p>bigger than me. It&rsquo;s in a ways of liberation. And also, you know, I just, I live a lot.</p>
<p>So I have seen a lot. I seen everything. I don&rsquo;t have that much regret left here. Like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m going too soon. You know, it&rsquo;s like, okay, maybe it&rsquo;s time. Like death is a part</p>
<p>of life. So. In some sense, you&rsquo;re willing to accept death to keep fighting for freedom</p>
<p>in your, in at least in part a place you call home. Yeah, it is. Do you hope that one day</p>
<p>you can return to North Korea? I hope so. I hope I bring my son and tell him this is</p>
<p>like where your ancestors from too. It would look very different than the place you came</p>
<p>from in your, as you hope. Do you hope that there&rsquo;s a democracy one day that North Korea</p>
<p>looks like South Korea? Well, that would be in paradise, right? But I&rsquo;m a rational optimist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like just optimistic because I have to be. I think as long as there are people</p>
<p>who have changed the world, right? Like who believed in something and worked for it. And</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, like there&rsquo;s like Alice Shroves, a few people holding entire this</p>
<p>world, right? I really believe in that. I think as long as that continues, that can</p>
<p>happen in my country. As long as people like you someday want to decide to do something</p>
<p>with North Korea and working for it, using your brainpower to solve this puzzle, how</p>
<p>fascinating would that be? That&rsquo;s why I continue to speak, continue to recruit. To inspire</p>
<p>millions to do something. The books you like are all the books I love. I have to mention</p>
<p>this. You mentioned briefly on the, with Jordan, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is an incredible</p>
<p>book. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I want to ask here, but there&rsquo;s some, I think</p>
<p>the book kind of, through telling a story, reveals that life is suffering and yet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beauty in it. The beauty in every moment that uses kind of a river to paint a metaphor.</p>
<p>Is there something that you could say, speak to like how that book impacted your life and</p>
<p>the way you live life, maybe the way you see life, whether it&rsquo;s on the life of suffering</p>
<p>side or that life is beautiful side.</p>
<p>I mean, he goes the entire journey, right? He goes in this state of, I&rsquo;m so enlightened</p>
<p>that I cannot deal with the people who are there in love and quiet about it. Right? They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, that&rsquo;s so like primitive. Once he has his own son, he actually being attached. He</p>
<p>actually cares. He actually really does whole thing, right? That&rsquo;s a thing that he used</p>
<p>to think not. Once his son comes find him, he looks at life differently. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing. I did have that kind of journey where, oh, nothing matters, right? So bitter.</p>
<p>So so like, so cynical. And after I met so many incredible people, I was talking about</p>
<p>that person who told me he was gay. He told me, I love you. And I was like, why do you</p>
<p>love me? In the past, people when they wanted me was because they want to rape me. Everybody</p>
<p>wanted something from me. That&rsquo;s why they wanted me. And I never understood. You can</p>
<p>love somebody unconditionally. And this gay guy, the last one was want to sleep with me,</p>
<p>right? And he loves me. And I think I had a blessing after my journey, meeting people</p>
<p>who loved me unconditionally because I was just being a human. And I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it is now for me that like him. I live for love now. I live for love. Any kinds of love.</p>
<p>Love for knowledge. I like, I read so many books because I love books, right? I love</p>
<p>what I do. I love my people. I love humanity. You know, even it sometimes annoys me. I love</p>
<p>myself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful too. The annoying parts are beautiful too. What do you, let me ask</p>
<p>the ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Well, I think at this point I stop questioning why I&rsquo;m here, right? Like it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>someone put the atom there or a big bang. I&rsquo;m here. That&rsquo;s truth, right? I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>accept that fully. So what, instead of me keep asking the impossible question, why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here. I&rsquo;m going to let you do that. Let the science do that, right? You guys go out in</p>
<p>the space and look for the evidence. I&rsquo;m conducting.</p>
<p>You accept that you&rsquo;re here and you&rsquo;re just going to enjoy it. Like you&rsquo;re here for love,</p>
<p>as you said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing. I think I&rsquo;m here for the process of pursuing something bigger than</p>
<p>me. Process of doing something. It&rsquo;s not like a model. It&rsquo;s not a virtue signal or anything.</p>
<p>It just makes me happy that I fight for something bigger. Like than me, right? How boring is</p>
<p>that? Every day you get up like, Oh my God, I&rsquo;m going to buy myself this. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>get this for myself. It&rsquo;s so boring, isn&rsquo;t it? So in a way, I think that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that I&rsquo;m in a state. I don&rsquo;t have to fight for myself anymore. But morning</p>
<p>people have to do that. And that&rsquo;s sometimes more than enough they have to do. And I salute</p>
<p>them. They are doing fighting, saving themselves every day. But now I&rsquo;m not there. I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>blessed. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very grateful.</p>
<p>Still fighting for something much bigger than you. But do you still believe that you can</p>
<p>change the world? That you can be a thing that, at least in part, helps North Korea</p>
<p>or even broader helps alleviate some suffering in the world?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing. I was reading this book before by randomness, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, you&rsquo;re so courageous. You&rsquo;re amazing. I was like, no, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>horrible. I know myself. You don&rsquo;t want to tell me that. It&rsquo;s random why I ended up here.</p>
<p>Like, why did I pick up English so quickly? Why do I love books? Right? I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s random.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask why. Just enjoy it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just random. I think I don&rsquo;t know how the history will remember me. I think</p>
<p>only thing I have to at this point to make sure is that the people after I consulting</p>
<p>a lot of security teams, like now North Korea became a lot smarter. Like you said, they</p>
<p>make it more disguised as a, like a suicide and a car accident. So when I die, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know I got killed. I think that&rsquo;s a higher chance. So I think that&rsquo;s a thing like people</p>
<p>are suffering, take it or not, it&rsquo;s your choice. And at least it&rsquo;s my responsibility for them</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s going on. I think if you did not know and didn&rsquo;t do anything, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>even guilty of a thing. But once you know, then you are not doing it. Then you, something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like not right. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing. Like I want people to know. And then what</p>
<p>they want to do is not my problem afterwards. Right? So my role is very small in that regards.</p>
<p>And I just hope that we&rsquo;re humanized North Koreans for the first time, because we have</p>
<p>been so dehumanized, right? Like we are like looking like robots. If you look at us marching</p>
<p>and cry, like when your leader dies, almost seems like we don&rsquo;t even have the same emotions.</p>
<p>People cannot connect us in the same level. And I think that&rsquo;s something is, that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>media have done it to us.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re shining a small light on this dark part of the world that I think,</p>
<p>and you make it, you&rsquo;re so modest, but I think, I think you will have that little light just</p>
<p>might be a big thing that changes that incredible amount of suffering that&rsquo;s happening on that</p>
<p>part of the world. You know what I mean? You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re an amazing person. I&rsquo;m so fortunate</p>
<p>to get a chance to talk with you. I can&rsquo;t wait what you do in the future. You&rsquo;re, I</p>
<p>hope you write many more books. I do hope you continue making videos, continue having</p>
<p>conversations. You&rsquo;re an inspiration to me and millions of others. I really appreciate</p>
<p>you talking with me today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so honored. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Yeonmi Park. And thank you</p>
<p>to Belcampo, Gala Games, BetterHelp, and 8th Sleep. Check them out in the description to</p>
<p>support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Bob Marley. Better</p>
<p>to die fighting for freedom than be a prisoner all the days of your life. Thank you for listening</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
