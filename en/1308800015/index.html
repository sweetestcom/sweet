    <p>For almost four decades, no one questioned Darlene&rsquo;s cause of death.</p>
<p>And honestly, at first, neither did we.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t set out to debunk the cause of death in Darlene&rsquo;s case, but when we went</p>
<p>through the pathologist&rsquo;s 1984 findings, a few things just didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that we thought the report was wrong or that we knew more than a trained</p>
<p>pathologist.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the opposite.</p>
<p>Surely, someone with more education than us just needs to explain a few things to me and</p>
<p>Emily in layman&rsquo;s terms.</p>
<p>But when we got the report translated from medical jargon to everyday speak, it proved</p>
<p>that everything that stood out to us should have.</p>
<p>And it should have stood out to people for the last 38 years.</p>
<p>But for some reason, it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And now, we&rsquo;re about to tear apart the very foundation on which Darlene&rsquo;s case was built.</p>
<p>So here goes nothing.</p>
<p>This is episode 14, A Massive Revelation.</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s official cause of death is listed as cranioscerebral blunt trauma.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an actor reading word for word Dr. Rick Hoover&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that Darlene R. Hulse, a 28-year-old white female, died as a result</p>
<p>of blunt head injuries, causing extensive deep tears and bruising about the face and</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>Diffuse hemorrhage was seen within the soft tissues of the scalp and hemorrhage was seen</p>
<p>over the surface of the brain as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, areas of blunt trauma were seen involving the neck, back, and extremities.</p>
<p>Now the conclusion was all fine and good, but it was some of his notes leading up to</p>
<p>the conclusion that we didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Subsequent internal examination demonstrates diffuse scalpline hemorrhage, but no evidence</p>
<p>of skull fracture with diffuse mild subarachnoid hemorrhage seen over the right parietal cerebral</p>
<p>cortex over an area measuring&hellip;</p>
<p>See what I mean about the medical jargon?</p>
<p>But the part that we honed in on was at the beginning.</p>
<p>But no evidence of skull fracture.</p>
<p>For someone who died of blunt force trauma, we thought that was strange.</p>
<p>But for all we knew, maybe this was common.</p>
<p>The other thing that stood out in the report where Dr. Hoover listed off Darlene&rsquo;s injuries</p>
<p>was a part that mentioned a quote,</p>
<p>focal fracture of hyoid bone.</p>
<p>A quick Google search will tell you that a fractured hyoid bone is super rare, and a</p>
<p>life in true crime will tell you that it&rsquo;s most commonly caused by strangulation.</p>
<p>But to be clear, there is nothing in Darlene&rsquo;s autopsy that mentions strangulation or asphyxiation.</p>
<p>So were these inconsistencies just the result of real life clashing with the tropes that</p>
<p>we see and read and hear in our true crime content?</p>
<p>Or was there something there?</p>
<p>We tried reaching Dr. Rick Hoover to ask.</p>
<p>He still works as a pathologist in Indiana today.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t super hopeful about getting a sit down with him.</p>
<p>He was actually someone that one of our other reporters, Delia D&rsquo;Ambra, wanted to speak</p>
<p>with a couple of years back about her investigation into the murder of the Pelley family.</p>
<p>That was for Counter Clock season three.</p>
<p>But he iced us out pretty hard back then.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t see this going much different.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>
<p>We never heard back from him or his office in response to our request.</p>
<p>So with Dr. Hoover not returning our calls, we turned to another expert to walk us through</p>
<p>the findings.</p>
<p>Dr. Bill Smock, police surgeon, Louisville Metro Police Department, medical director</p>
<p>of the Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention, consultant to local, state and</p>
<p>federal law enforcement agencies across the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Smock also served as assistant medical examiner in Kentucky and worked as a medical</p>
<p>advisor to the Louisville division of the FBI for years.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t dispute that Darlene&rsquo;s killer hit her in the head and other parts of her body</p>
<p>with the fireplace poker.</p>
<p>But he thinks she survived that.</p>
<p>The subarachnoid hemorrhage, it may not cap it, that&rsquo;s not what killed her.</p>
<p>What makes him so certain?</p>
<p>That same little line that bothered us, but no evidence of skull fracture.</p>
<p>There was evidence of what&rsquo;s called subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is hemorrhage right on the</p>
<p>surface of the brain.</p>
<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage does not kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evidence of an acceleration, deceleration injury within the skull, but it&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>to kill you.</p>
<p>It may render you unconscious, but you do not die of subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
<p>So if the findings are telling him that Darlene did not die of blunt force trauma, then what</p>
<p>did kill her?</p>
<p>She died of strangulation and then he kept squeezing.</p>
<p>Dr. Smock reached this conclusion because he honed in on the broken hyoid, same as we</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>But his expert eye also caught everything else around that.</p>
<p>The autopsy documented the presence of hemorrhage within the strap muscles of the neck.</p>
<p>The strap muscles of the neck are the muscles that turn our head back and forth and up and</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>So there is evidence of trauma to those muscles, which is absolutely consistent with strangulation.</p>
<p>Now I want to note that it isn&rsquo;t unusual for medical experts to come to different conclusions.</p>
<p>Often causes of death are subjective and totally dependent on the experience of the pathologist.</p>
<p>Back then, Dr. Hoover labeled the neck injuries on the autopsy as postmortem.</p>
<p>Dr. Smock said that he thinks the pressure on the neck started when Darlene was alive,</p>
<p>but then continued after she died.</p>
<p>Dr. Hoover said there was no evidence of hemorrhage associated with those fractures, which led</p>
<p>him to believe that those fractures occurred postmortem, meaning after her heart had stopped</p>
<p>beating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s certainly possible that she was strangled to death.</p>
<p>Then after her heart stopped beating, either pressure was again applied or continually</p>
<p>applied to her neck, resulting in the fracture of the hyoid bone, as well as the fracture</p>
<p>of the laryngeal cartilage.</p>
<p>But what does Dr. Smock&rsquo;s new findings mean for Darlene and the investigation?</p>
<p>Well, if he&rsquo;s right, it could potentially tell us a lot about the suspect, his behavior,</p>
<p>his motive, and his rage.</p>
<p>Based on the locations of Darlene&rsquo;s head wounds, Dr. Smock thinks that the man was</p>
<p>hitting Darlene with the fire poker at the house as she was trying to escape.</p>
<p>The blows are coming from Darlene&rsquo;s right, the suspect&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>If he is facing her back and she is attempting to get away and he&rsquo;s striking her head from</p>
<p>behind, then there is some evidence that she did sustain multiple blows from a rounded</p>
<p>linear object to the back of her thighs.</p>
<p>If she is attempting to run away, then it would be a strike with the suspect&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>hand.</p>
<p>We know from the blood in the house and the trail of blood to the car that some of the</p>
<p>violence happened inside the home.</p>
<p>But if Dr. Smock is right, then the question becomes, when did her killer strangle her?</p>
<p>The suspect was still in the house when Marie and Melissa ran to their grandparents.</p>
<p>And it was just a few minutes after that when police were called, and a few minutes after</p>
<p>that when an officer arrived and the suspect and Darlene were already gone.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t stay at the house long before deciding to take Darlene with him.</p>
<p>A human can be rendered unconscious from pressure, just 11 pounds of pressure on either side</p>
<p>of the neck, in less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>And if that pressure is maintained, they will cease breathing somewhere between one and</p>
<p>two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>So he might have had time to kill Darlene before even taking her out of the house.</p>
<p>But if this man was willing to manually strangle her, why beat her first?</p>
<p>In this case, the suspect displayed some degree of anger toward the patient.</p>
<p>The blows, multiple blows from an object.</p>
<p>Plus, when you strangle someone, that is an intimate type of assault because you are right</p>
<p>in their face, literally squeezing the life out of somebody who was in front of you.</p>
<p>All of this could help inform the investigation and what we know, or what we thought we knew,</p>
<p>about the man who killed Darlene.</p>
<p>If police hadn&rsquo;t been working with the wrong motive and the wrong cause of death from the</p>
<p>very beginning, it makes me wonder if Darlene&rsquo;s case could have been solved back in the 80s.</p>
<p>I mean, I honestly wish we could have the FBI agent who did the behavioral analysis</p>
<p>redo his report, knowing what we know now.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s more that Dr. Smock disagrees with Dr. Hoover on.</p>
<p>You have to assume, until proven otherwise, that a sexual assault also occurred.</p>
<p>It seems like a sexual assault kit was done after Darlene&rsquo;s body was found because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on an old evidence list, and it&rsquo;s even mentioned in the autopsy report.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t been able to find much context around it.</p>
<p>Aside from a mention in that coroner&rsquo;s report about a quote-unquote rape kit specimen being</p>
<p>collected by Dr. Hoover and sent off with a state police technician by the name of Harmon,</p>
<p>there are no results, no notes, nothing.</p>
<p>We just know that at some point authorities communicated to Darlene&rsquo;s family that she</p>
<p>was not sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a photo from her autopsy that perplexed us.</p>
<p>It shows blood drops on the top of Darlene&rsquo;s underwear.</p>
<p>But remember, she was found with her clothes on, which was one of the reasons authorities</p>
<p>back then said that they didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Now her skirt was covering this part of her underwear when her body was found.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no explanation in Dr. Hoover&rsquo;s report for the underwear bloodstains, so we wondered</p>
<p>if there were more injuries to her lower body that weren&rsquo;t documented.</p>
<p>But Dr. Smock said that those blood spots aren&rsquo;t from injuries.</p>
<p>He says they&rsquo;re transfer droplets.</p>
<p>Which means blood has to be coming vertically down onto the underwear.</p>
<p>She was in a skirt, based on the photographs from the scene.</p>
<p>So if the skirt were actually over the underwear, then you would not expect to see any blood</p>
<p>on the underwear.</p>
<p>So looking at the photo from the autopsy, it indicates to me that clearly the skirt</p>
<p>was up.</p>
<p>There are two likely scenarios where blood could have dropped down at that angle onto</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s underwear.</p>
<p>The first is that it&rsquo;s Darlene&rsquo;s own blood that dropped there.</p>
<p>Which for that to have happened means that Darlene would have had to have been in a seated</p>
<p>position with her skirt off or pushed way up, and blood from a higher part on her body,</p>
<p>likely her head, dripped down at that angle.</p>
<p>So when would Darlene have been in a seated position?</p>
<p>Well, probably when she was put in the suspect&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Now the second option is that it&rsquo;s not Darlene&rsquo;s blood at all, and instead it could be a large</p>
<p>sample of blood from our suspect.</p>
<p>For a long time, if you made me bet, I&rsquo;d have said that it was the suspect&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>purely based on the fact that for so long everyone believed that Darlene was pulled</p>
<p>from the house unconscious or already dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always envisioned the man having to lay her across the backseat of his car to</p>
<p>transport her from the house to Olive Trail.</p>
<p>But we recently found a witness statement that contradicted that idea.</p>
<p>And when we tracked this witness down 38 years later, her testimony made us even more</p>
<p>sure that police had it all wrong back in 1984.</p>
<p>This witness is a woman named Cindy Sellers.</p>
<p>She first came forward not long after Darlene&rsquo;s abduction and told police that she had seen</p>
<p>the killer in the green car with Darlene sitting up in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like police ever gave her statement too much weight back then, but her</p>
<p>account was pretty detailed, and it hadn&rsquo;t changed in almost four decades when we sat</p>
<p>down with her.</p>
<p>I happened to look out the window and saw them there on the road, and it was just a</p>
<p>really freaky thing.</p>
<p>In 1984, Cindy was a 21-year-old art student, and on August 17th, she was with her parents</p>
<p>and her brother driving from Culver to Rochester for some shopping.</p>
<p>The family was driving east on State Road 110 near Argus, with Cindy sitting in the</p>
<p>backseat on the driver&rsquo;s side next to her sleeping brother.</p>
<p>She said there was a black Cadillac that was in front of them going slow, so her dad had</p>
<p>to slow way down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when she looked out her window and saw a 1970s poorly painted olive green</p>
<p>rusty car with two people in it, a man driving and a woman in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>The description she gave of the man and the woman were a dead ringer for Darlene and the</p>
<p>suspect.</p>
<p>She said that the car was moving slowly on Olive Trail coming toward them on 110 as they</p>
<p>passed by.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what an officer wrote in a report after interviewing Cindy back in 84.</p>
<p>The passenger in the vehicle was female and slumped back in the seat with blood on her</p>
<p>and a grayish looking skin.</p>
<p>At this time, the driver placed something over the upper part of the body of the female</p>
<p>and the driver of the vehicle glared at the family.</p>
<p>Cindy said something about the people in the car seemed off.</p>
<p>So when they passed by, Cindy turned around to get a better look at the woman.</p>
<p>She was trying to grab the steering wheel and he swatted her away and she kind of crumpled</p>
<p>into the door and then that was the last of it.</p>
<p>He turned around, I turned around to look because I wondered what was going on and he</p>
<p>had turned the car around to go back down the road they were on.</p>
<p>Now we stopped her right there and had her re-explain this over and over because this</p>
<p>little detail was huge to us but not really included in the original report.</p>
<p>What Cindy described is that after the suspect realized he&rsquo;d been noticed, he did a U-turn</p>
<p>and went back north on Olive Trail.</p>
<p>And I hope I&rsquo;m making this clear because I think it is so important.</p>
<p>If what Cindy saw was Darlene and her captor, that means that Darlene was still alive inside</p>
<p>his car and that they were already on Olive Trail about to turn onto 110, like away from</p>
<p>the wooded area she was eventually found in.</p>
<p>But then for some reason he doubles back and does a U-turn to go back onto Olive Trail.</p>
<p>Now this is so important to me because authorities theorize, at least in recent years, that the</p>
<p>suspect knew the area and knew exactly where he was going to take Darlene, meaning that</p>
<p>he headed straight from her house right to that cutout in the woods where he dragged</p>
<p>her through and left her.</p>
<p>But now that doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense.</p>
<p>Maybe he was out looking for any place to take Darlene and then he realized that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been seen by witnesses so he turned around and just happened upon that opening in the</p>
<p>fence.</p>
<p>But really, if this is the moment where we reconsider everything, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where Darlene even entered the woods.</p>
<p>Recently we came across a photo that we had never seen before of the fence that went along</p>
<p>Olive Trail.</p>
<p>The way the cutout has always been described, we imagined a hole in the bottom of the fence,</p>
<p>like where it meets the ground so you could drag someone through it.</p>
<p>But actually, the cutout is from the top of the fence, halfway down, leaving a few feet</p>
<p>of fence from the ground up.</p>
<p>That would mean either Darlene was still alive and this man forced her to climb over the</p>
<p>fence herself and walk into the woods, or he somehow lifted her body over the cutout.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s if you take everyone&rsquo;s word for it that that is where they entered.</p>
<p>But what if he didn&rsquo;t bring her in right there?</p>
<p>Based on a statement from a hunter, it seems like there was an area where you could drive</p>
<p>a car back onto the land.</p>
<p>The hunter had told police during their canvassing efforts that he&rsquo;d seen a green nova back</p>
<p>in those same woods just two days before Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Now nothing ever came of that lead, but maybe however that person got in the woods is how</p>
<p>the suspect went in, which would have hidden his car as well in the critical hours that</p>
<p>they were looking for it right after Darlene was taken.</p>
<p>Until the suspect is in custody, we may never know the answer to why he made the moves he</p>
<p>did, which is why I think police need to hone in on the physical evidence left behind.</p>
<p>Like Darlene&rsquo;s underwear.</p>
<p>Cindy said that the woman she saw in the car was sitting up in the front seat but sort</p>
<p>of slumped back, so that&rsquo;s potentially when Darlene&rsquo;s head wounds could have dripped</p>
<p>blood down onto the front of her underwear.</p>
<p>But only if she wasn&rsquo;t wearing her skirt, or again, her skirt was pulled all the way</p>
<p>up so the whole thing was around her waist.</p>
<p>So if police haven&rsquo;t yet, they have to test her underwear and the sexual assault kit that</p>
<p>they took back in 1984.</p>
<p>The underwear is listed as evidence in this case, along with a number of other seemingly</p>
<p>vital pieces of evidence like fingernail clippings.</p>
<p>While Prosecutor Chipman does seem to understand the importance of new DNA testing, he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to be in a hurry.</p>
<p>He also said that the items they have to test are limited.</p>
<p>I mean, the last several years it was like, well, what else can we test?</p>
<p>Can we test that again?</p>
<p>When we asked for specific examples of what&rsquo;s been tested in those results, Nelson seemed</p>
<p>unsure.</p>
<p>For example, he said that they&rsquo;ve tested Darlene&rsquo;s fingernail clippings, but that</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t result in anything.</p>
<p>But when was that done, and using what method?</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the phone cord, and her other pieces of clothing, and the carpet and the</p>
<p>duct tape and the hairs that were found on her body and at the scene.</p>
<p>I mean, Darlene fought for her life so hard that she broke a finger.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to believe that Darlene didn&rsquo;t have some of this man under her fingernails.</p>
<p>For clarity, we tried to interview the lab director at ISP to help us figure out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been tested and when, but every single inquiry we made led back to gatekeeper Nelson.</p>
<p>Hey, Emily, it&rsquo;s Ron Gallows with the state police again.</p>
<p>After making a few phone calls and talking to a couple of different people, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to refer you to the Marshall County prosecutor for an answer to your inquiry about materials</p>
<p>being tested or items being tested, if any at all.</p>
<p>So I understand he&rsquo;s the one kind of heading this collaboration between us and the sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>department up there on this investigation.</p>
<p>So they said that the questions should go through him.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry to have to punt this elsewhere, but I hope you get the answer you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And good luck with the project.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>No shade toward Captain Galavis, by the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chief public information officer for ISP and only intercepted Emily&rsquo;s call</p>
<p>that she made directly to the lab after getting turned down by the state police investigators</p>
<p>who are technically assigned to Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But we had already asked those questions to Nelson, and he didn&rsquo;t know, so we figured</p>
<p>going directly to the source would help, but we&rsquo;re running around in circles.</p>
<p>I know that those people, talking about ISP and cold case, you know, they&rsquo;re not thrilled</p>
<p>that outsiders are prodding into this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not offended that the government officials in charge of Darlene&rsquo;s case see us as prodding</p>
<p>outsiders, but I am frustrated that they don&rsquo;t seem to have done much with the information</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve gathered over the last year, especially when the message we keep getting from them</p>
<p>is that the case was stalled for so long because they didn&rsquo;t have the resources to gather new</p>
<p>information themselves.</p>
<p>So we are left guessing or making assumptions about what was tested and what results came</p>
<p>of it, like with the sexual assault kit.</p>
<p>We know a kit was performed on Darlene.</p>
<p>It is noted in that coroner&rsquo;s report, but I don&rsquo;t know exactly what was collected because</p>
<p>in 1984, sexual assault kits varied.</p>
<p>Dr. Smock performed hundreds of them back in the 80s when he worked for the Kentucky</p>
<p>And he told us that the training and experience of the individual pathologists came into play</p>
<p>back then and affected how the kits were done.</p>
<p>Basically, a simple one could be done where they looked for foreign hairs and trauma and</p>
<p>took a blind swab, or a more sophisticated one could have been done where they would</p>
<p>have come away with a more detailed look at potential trauma and a specific sample of</p>
<p>semen if it was present.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, there was semen present.</p>
<p>Yeah, that doesn&rsquo;t feel like an, oh, by the way, kind of statement in episode 14, does</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly how we found out.</p>
<p>There is nothing about semen being found in the old reports or even in the coroner or</p>
<p>autopsy reports.</p>
<p>But when we asked former investigator Yocolette and prosecutor Chipman if they knew how it</p>
<p>had been determined that Darlene wasn&rsquo;t sexually assaulted, they revealed this pretty</p>
<p>casually.</p>
<p>I think they did, well, I know they did a red kit per se, and it was sent off to the</p>
<p>lab, but there was nothing in it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s semen, but they figured it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Rot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Did they do tests and determine it was rot?</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Are you screaming yet?</p>
<p>Emily and I were past the screaming phase and to the speechless phase.</p>
<p>So clearly, we don&rsquo;t have everything, or maybe there is some stuff that only lives</p>
<p>in the original investigators&rsquo; brains, which is a terrifying thought because how much has</p>
<p>been lost as people associated with this case have retired or died.</p>
<p>So they tell us we know there is semen, but it&rsquo;s Ron&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know exactly how that was decided or by whom.</p>
<p>Nelson and Yokelet said something about Ron telling them that they had sex like a day</p>
<p>before or a couple days before, again, something we can&rsquo;t find documented anywhere.</p>
<p>In 1984, they could have done an acid-phosphate test and determined the blood type of the</p>
<p>person that the semen belonged to, and we have no idea if that was done or if they just</p>
<p>went off of Ron&rsquo;s statement about having sex and since Hoover said that there was no</p>
<p>sexual assault, they thought that the semen was irrelevant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it seems like something you&rsquo;d want to be sure of, right?</p>
<p>The technology is available today to get a DNA profile from the semen sample as long</p>
<p>as they preserve the seminal fluid on a glass slide after the sexual assault kit was done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of ifs, but let&rsquo;s say they don&rsquo;t still have the semen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty sure ISP still has her underwear, which Dr. Smock said could also lead to answers</p>
<p>through the blood or potential seminal fluid or both.</p>
<p>The state police or the prosecutor&rsquo;s office have asked me to consult on this case.</p>
<p>I think the most important evidence at this point is submitting whatever evidence we have,</p>
<p>the sexual assault kit, the underwear, for DNA testing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I think the answer to who the murderer is lies.</p>
<p>Another interesting observation Dr. Smock pointed out was in a photo of Darlene&rsquo;s wrists.</p>
<p>He asked us if investigators had ever said if Darlene had been bound, which they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We know her killer had duct tape because there were pieces of tape found at the house, but</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t found with any duct tape on her.</p>
<p>But Dr. Smock pointed out that the skin on her wrists is lighter as if she had been bound</p>
<p>there with tape.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true, the suspect likely ripped off the tape before leaving the woods.</p>
<p>And that tape would have been loaded with DNA if it had ever been found.</p>
<p>Even if it was found today, there could still be traces of Darlene or her killer on it.</p>
<p>After Emily left Dr. Smock&rsquo;s, she called Prosecutor Chipman.</p>
<p>Not only did we want to share Dr. Smock&rsquo;s findings, but we also wanted to ask if Darlene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underwear had ever been tested.</p>
<p>She tried calling, texting, no answer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>For us, it was even more important to tell Darlene&rsquo;s daughters what we had just heard.</p>
<p>We kept them in the loop during our reporting and shared every bit of new information that</p>
<p>we found along the way.</p>
<p>And while this news about strangulation and a possible sexual assault was a lot to take</p>
<p>in and it made them rethink everything they&rsquo;d been told for 38 years about their mom&rsquo;s death,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a shock, especially not to Marie.</p>
<p>I believe she was raped.</p>
<p>No one can tell me otherwise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they say they were seen or not found.</p>
<p>I just feel like it was sexually motivated because it&rsquo;s never made sense.</p>
<p>Any other reason, like Melissa and I were talking about it, like when Melissa came out,</p>
<p>he had her on the ground, you know, he was on his knees in a position to do something.</p>
<p>And so, you know, he never took anything, you know, for years we&rsquo;ve been told, oh, she</p>
<p>was not raped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you don&rsquo;t know, you messed everything up.</p>
<p>And so I just feel like it was sexually motivated.</p>
<p>It makes so much more sense to me.</p>
<p>It makes the pieces fit better.</p>
<p>And I want to know what made them originally say that she was not raped.</p>
<p>Like, I definitively, like, how did they miss the strangulation is what I want to know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know this same thing, but I don&rsquo;t get too caught up in what should have been.</p>
<p>Investigators and pathologists are human.</p>
<p>They work with what they have and what they know, and in a small town like Argus, resources</p>
<p>are limited.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t hold investigators now responsible for how the investigation was handled back</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>Here is what I do hold them responsible for.</p>
<p>Doing everything humanly possible to solve the case today.</p>
<p>And doing it soon, so someone can be held accountable.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not waiting for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for my people.</p>
<p>I, I gotta do, I got work to cut out.</p>
<p>I mean, I got work to do.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re too early.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 40 years.</p>
<p>We are running out of time.</p>
<p>And every day, Emily and I are still uncovering new information.</p>
<p>So what are the next steps for investigators and where do Emily and I go from here?</p>
<p>All of that is in our final episode, episode 15.</p>
<p>Next in the investigation.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
