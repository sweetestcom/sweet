    <p>The following is a conversation with Brian Johnson,</p>
<p>founder of Kernel, a company that has developed devices</p>
<p>that can monitor and record brain activity.</p>
<p>And previously, he was the founder of Braintree,</p>
<p>a mobile payment company that acquired Venmo</p>
<p>and then was acquired by PayPal and eBay.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Forsigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that this was a fun</p>
<p>and memorable experience,</p>
<p>wearing the Kernel FlowBrain interface</p>
<p>in the beginning of this conversation,</p>
<p>as you can see if you watch the video version</p>
<p>of this episode.</p>
<p>And there was a Ubuntu Linux machine sitting next to me</p>
<p>collecting the data from my brain.</p>
<p>The whole thing gave me hope that the mystery</p>
<p>of the human mind will be unlocked in the coming decades</p>
<p>as we begin to measure signals from the brain</p>
<p>in a high bandwidth way.</p>
<p>To understand the mind,</p>
<p>we either have to build it or to measure it.</p>
<p>Both are worth a try.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brian and the rest of the Kernel team</p>
<p>for making this little demo happen.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Brian Johnson.</p>
<p>You ready, Lex?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>Do you guys wanna come in and put the interfaces</p>
<p>on our heads?</p>
<p>And then I will proceed to tell you a few jokes.</p>
<p>So we have two incredible pieces of technology</p>
<p>and a machine running Ubuntu 2004 in front of us.</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Are these going on our heads?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going on our heads, yeah.</p>
<p>And they will place it on our heads for proper alignment.</p>
<p>Does this support giant heads?</p>
<p>Because I kind of have a giant head.</p>
<p>Is this just giant head?</p>
<p>Are you saying as like an ego</p>
<p>or are you saying physically both?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice massage.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, how does this feel?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to move around?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It feels, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>This feels awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good fit.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That feels good.</p>
<p>So this is big head friendly.</p>
<p>It suits you well, Lex.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to,</p>
<p>I feel like when I wear this,</p>
<p>I need to sound like Sam Harris,</p>
<p>calm, collected, eloquent.</p>
<p>I feel smarter, actually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever felt quite as much</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m part of the future as now.</p>
<p>Have you ever worn a brain interface</p>
<p>or had your brain imaged?</p>
<p>Oh, never had my brain imaged.</p>
<p>The only way I&rsquo;ve analyzed my brain</p>
<p>is by talking to myself and thinking.</p>
<p>No direct data.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is definitely a brain interface</p>
<p>that has a lot of blind spots.</p>
<p>It has some blind spots, yeah.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>All right, are we recording?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So Lex, the objective of this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you some jokes</p>
<p>and your objective is to not smile,</p>
<p>which as a Russian, you should have an edge.</p>
<p>Make the motherland proud.</p>
<p>I gotcha.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear the jokes.</p>
<p>Lex, and this is from the Colonel Crew.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on a device that can read your mind</p>
<p>and we would love to see your thoughts.</p>
<p>Is that the joke?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opening.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m seeing the muscle activation correctly on your lips,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do well on this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>All right, here comes the first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screwed.</p>
<p>Here comes the first one.</p>
<p>Is this going to break the device?</p>
<p>Is it resilient to laughter?</p>
<p>Lex, what goes through a potato&rsquo;s brain?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I got already failed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hilarious opener.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Tater thoughts.</p>
<p>What kind of fish performs brain surgery?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A neural surgeon.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re getting data of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in my brain right now?</p>
<p>Lifetime, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting activation patterns of your entire cortex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to do better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll edit out all the parts where I laughed.</p>
<p>Photoshop put a serious face over me.</p>
<p>You can recover.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Lex, what do scholars eat when they&rsquo;re hungry?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what?</p>
<p>Academia nuts.</p>
<p>That was a pretty good one.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ll do is,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re wearing kernel flow,</p>
<p>which is an interface built using technology</p>
<p>called spectroscopy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist</p>
<p>using light.</p>
<p>So using LIDAR, as you know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using that to image the functional imaging</p>
<p>of brain activity.</p>
<p>And so as your neurons fire electrically and chemically,</p>
<p>it creates blood oxygenation levels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re measuring that.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll see in the reconstructions we do for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see your activation patterns in your brain</p>
<p>as throughout this entire time we are wearing it.</p>
<p>So in the reaction to the jokes</p>
<p>and as we were sitting here talking,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re moving towards a real time feed</p>
<p>of your cortical brain activity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of things that are in contact</p>
<p>with my skull right now.</p>
<p>How many of them are there?</p>
<p>And so how many of them are, what are they?</p>
<p>What are the actual sensors?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 52 modules,</p>
<p>and each module has one laser and six sensors.</p>
<p>And the sensors fire in about 100 picoseconds.</p>
<p>And then the photons scatter and absorb in your brain.</p>
<p>And then a few go in, a few come back out,</p>
<p>a bunch go in, then a few come back out,</p>
<p>and we sense those photons</p>
<p>and then we do the reconstruction for the activity.</p>
<p>Overall, there&rsquo;s about a thousand plus channels</p>
<p>that are sampling your activity.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p>I would not think it would be comfortable.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s measuring brain activity,</p>
<p>I would not think it would be comfortable, but it is.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>In fact, I want to take this home.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So people are accustomed to being in big systems</p>
<p>like fMRI where there&rsquo;s 120 decibel sounds</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a claustrophobic encasement,</p>
<p>or EEG, which is just painful, or surgery.</p>
<p>And so, yes, I agree that this is a convenient option</p>
<p>to be able to just put on your head</p>
<p>that measures your brain activity</p>
<p>in the contextual environment you choose.</p>
<p>So if we want to have it during a podcast,</p>
<p>if we want to be at home in a business setting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s freedom to record your brain activity</p>
<p>in the setting that you choose.</p>
<p>Yeah, but sort of from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>are these, what is it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different modular parts</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of, there&rsquo;s like a rubber band thing</p>
<p>where they mold to the shape of your head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So we built this version of the mechanical design</p>
<p>to accommodate most adult heads.</p>
<p>But I have a giant head and it fits fine.</p>
<p>It fits well, actually.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I have an average head.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I feel much better about my head now.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m more average than I thought.</p>
<p>Okay, so what else is there interesting</p>
<p>that you could say while it&rsquo;s on our heads?</p>
<p>I can keep this on the whole time.</p>
<p>This is kind of awesome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing for me, as a fan of Ubuntu,</p>
<p>I use Ubuntu MATE, you guys use that too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s amazing to have code running to the side,</p>
<p>measuring stuff and collecting data.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like much more important now</p>
<p>that my data is being recorded.</p>
<p>Like, you know when you have a good friend</p>
<p>that listens to you, that actually is listening to you?</p>
<p>This is what I feel like, like a much better friend</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like accurately listening to me, Ubuntu.</p>
<p>What a cool perspective, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that,</p>
<p>of feeling understood.</p>
<p>Heard.</p>
<p>Yeah, heard deeply by the mechanical system</p>
<p>that is recording your brain activity,</p>
<p>versus the human that you&rsquo;re engaging with,</p>
<p>that your mind immediately goes to</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this dimensionality</p>
<p>and depth of understanding of this software system</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re intimately familiar with.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re able to communicate with this system</p>
<p>in ways that you couldn&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel heard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess what&rsquo;s interesting about this is</p>
<p>your intuitions are spot on.</p>
<p>Most people have intuitions about brain interfaces</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve grown up with this idea</p>
<p>of people moving cursors on the screen</p>
<p>or typing or changing the channel or skipping a song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily been anchored on control.</p>
<p>And I think the more relevant understanding</p>
<p>of brain interfaces or neuroimaging</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a measurement system.</p>
<p>And once you have numbers for a given thing,</p>
<p>a seemingly endless number of possibilities</p>
<p>emerge around that of what to do with those numbers.</p>
<p>So before you tell me about the possibilities,</p>
<p>this was an incredible experience.</p>
<p>I can keep this on for another two hours,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m being told that for a bunch of reasons,</p>
<p>just because we probably wanna keep the data small</p>
<p>and visualize it nicely for the final product,</p>
<p>we wanna cut this off and take this amazing helmet</p>
<p>away from me.</p>
<p>So Brian, thank you so much for this experience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s continue without helmetless.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So that was an incredible experience.</p>
<p>Can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities</p>
<p>that opens up that stream of data,</p>
<p>that rich stream of data from the brain?</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m curious, what is your reaction?</p>
<p>What comes to mind when you put that on your head?</p>
<p>What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>And what possibilities emerge</p>
<p>and what significance might it have?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious where your orientation is at.</p>
<p>Well, for me, I&rsquo;m really excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of various information about my body,</p>
<p>about my mind being converted into data,</p>
<p>such that data can be used to create products</p>
<p>that make my life better.</p>
<p>So that to me is really exciting possibility.</p>
<p>Even just like a Fitbit that measures, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>some very basic measurements about your body</p>
<p>is really cool.</p>
<p>But the bandwidth of information,</p>
<p>the resolution of that information is very crude,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>The possibility of just building a data set</p>
<p>coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way</p>
<p>from my brain opens up all kinds of&hellip;</p>
<p>I was kind of joking when we were talking,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really, it&rsquo;s like I feel heard</p>
<p>in the sense that it feels like the full richness</p>
<p>of the information coming from my mind</p>
<p>is actually being recorded by the machine.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t quite put it into words,</p>
<p>but there is genuinely for me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not some kind of joke about me being a robot.</p>
<p>It just genuinely feels like I&rsquo;m being heard</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s going to improve my life,</p>
<p>as long as the thing that&rsquo;s on the other end</p>
<p>can do something useful with that data.</p>
<p>But even the recording itself is like,</p>
<p>once you record, it&rsquo;s like taking a picture.</p>
<p>That moment is forever saved in time.</p>
<p>Now, a picture cannot allow you to step back</p>
<p>into that world, but perhaps recording your brain</p>
<p>is a much higher resolution thing,</p>
<p>much more personal recording of that information</p>
<p>than a picture that would allow you to step back</p>
<p>into that where you were in that particular moment</p>
<p>in history and then map out a certain trajectory</p>
<p>to tell you certain things about yourself</p>
<p>that could open up all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s health that I consider,</p>
<p>but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard.</p>
<p>My state of mind, the level of focus,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, being heard.</p>
<p>What I heard you say is you have an entirety</p>
<p>of lived experience, some of which you can communicate</p>
<p>in words and in body language,</p>
<p>some of which you feel internally,</p>
<p>which cannot be captured in those communication modalities,</p>
<p>and that this measurement system captures</p>
<p>both the things you can try to articulate in words,</p>
<p>maybe in a lower dimensional space,</p>
<p>using one word, for example, to communicate focus,</p>
<p>when it really may be represented</p>
<p>in a 20 dimensional space of this particular kind of focus</p>
<p>and that this information is being captured,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a closer representation</p>
<p>to the entirety of your experience captured</p>
<p>in a dynamic fashion that is not just a static image</p>
<p>of your conscious experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the promise, that was the feeling,</p>
<p>and it felt like the future.</p>
<p>So it was a pretty cool experience.</p>
<p>And from the sort of mechanical perspective,</p>
<p>it was cool to have an actual device</p>
<p>that feels pretty good,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require me to go into the lab.</p>
<p>And also the other thing I was feeling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy named Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a friend of mine, amazing podcast,</p>
<p>people should listen to it, Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on a paper together</p>
<p>about eye movement and so on.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of, he&rsquo;s a neuroscientist</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a data person, machine learning person,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re both excited by how much the,</p>
<p>how much the data measurements of the human mind,</p>
<p>the brain and all the different metrics</p>
<p>that come from that could be used to understand</p>
<p>human beings and in a rigorous scientific way.</p>
<p>So the other thing I was thinking about</p>
<p>is how this could be turned into a tool for science.</p>
<p>Sort of not just personal science,</p>
<p>not just like Fitbit style,</p>
<p>like how am I doing on my personal metrics of health,</p>
<p>but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on.</p>
<p>So like data, not at the scale of an individual,</p>
<p>but data at a scale of many individuals</p>
<p>or a large number of individuals.</p>
<p>So personal being heard was exciting</p>
<p>and also just for science is exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy, like there&rsquo;s a very powerful thing</p>
<p>to it being so easy to just put on</p>
<p>that you could scale much easier.</p>
<p>If you think about that second thing you said</p>
<p>about the science of the brain,</p>
<p>most, we&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job,</p>
<p>like we, the human race has done a pretty good job</p>
<p>figuring out how to quantify the things around us</p>
<p>from distant stars to calories and steps and our genome.</p>
<p>So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything</p>
<p>in the known universe except for our minds.</p>
<p>And we can do these one offs</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to get an fMRI scan</p>
<p>or do something with a low res EEG system,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t done this at population scale.</p>
<p>And so if you think about human thought</p>
<p>or human cognition is probably the single law,</p>
<p>largest raw input material into society</p>
<p>at any given moment is our conversations</p>
<p>with ourselves and with other people.</p>
<p>And we have this raw input that we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t been able to measure yet.</p>
<p>And if you, when I think about it through that frame,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s remarkable, it&rsquo;s almost like we live</p>
<p>in this wild, wild West of unquantified communications</p>
<p>within ourselves and between each other</p>
<p>when everything else has been grounded in me.</p>
<p>For example, I know if I buy an appliance at the store</p>
<p>or on a website, I don&rsquo;t need to look at the measurements</p>
<p>on the appliance and make sure it can fit through my door.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an engineered system of appliance manufacturing</p>
<p>and construction.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s agreed upon engineering standards.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have engineering standards around cognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, it has not entered</p>
<p>as a formal engineering discipline that enables us</p>
<p>to scaffold in society with everything else we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>including consuming news, our relationships,</p>
<p>politics, economics, education, all the above.</p>
<p>And so to me that the most significant contribution</p>
<p>that kernel technology has to offer</p>
<p>would be the formal, the introduction</p>
<p>to formal engineering of cognition</p>
<p>as it relates to everything else in society.</p>
<p>I love that idea that you kind of think that there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>this ocean of data that&rsquo;s coming from people&rsquo;s brains</p>
<p>as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets</p>
<p>and texts and so on, just a very hardcore,</p>
<p>many scale compression of actual, the raw data.</p>
<p>But maybe you can comment,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using the word cognition.</p>
<p>I think the first step is to get the brain data.</p>
<p>But is there a leap to be taking</p>
<p>to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition?</p>
<p>So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting</p>
<p>data at scale from the brain,</p>
<p>and then we start to really be able to take little steps</p>
<p>along the path to actually measuring</p>
<p>some deep sense of cognition.</p>
<p>Because as I&rsquo;m sure you know, we understand a few things,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t understand most of what makes up cognition.</p>
<p>This has been one of the most significant challenges</p>
<p>of building Kernel, and Kernel wouldn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>if I wasn&rsquo;t able to fund it initially by myself.</p>
<p>Because when I engage in conversations with investors,</p>
<p>the immediate thought is, what is the killer app?</p>
<p>And of course, I understand that heuristic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re looking to de risk.</p>
<p>Is the product solved?</p>
<p>Is there a customer base?</p>
<p>Are people willing to pay for it?</p>
<p>How does it compare to competing options?</p>
<p>And in the case with brain interfaces,</p>
<p>when I started the company, there was no known path</p>
<p>to even build a technology</p>
<p>that could potentially become mainstream.</p>
<p>And then once we figured out the technology,</p>
<p>we could even, we could commence having conversations</p>
<p>with investors and it became, what is the killer app?</p>
<p>And so what has been,</p>
<p>so I funded the first $53 million for the company.</p>
<p>And to raise the round of funding, the first one we did,</p>
<p>I spoke to 228 investors.</p>
<p>One said yes, it was remarkable.</p>
<p>And it was mostly around this concept</p>
<p>around what is a killer app.</p>
<p>And so internally, the way we think about it is,</p>
<p>we think of the go to market strategy</p>
<p>much more like the Drake equation,</p>
<p>where if we can build technology</p>
<p>that has the characteristics of,</p>
<p>it has the data quality is high enough,</p>
<p>it meets some certain threshold,</p>
<p>cost, accessibility, comfort,</p>
<p>it can be worn in contextual environments.</p>
<p>If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device,</p>
<p>then the responsibility that we have is to figure out</p>
<p>how to create the algorithm that enables the human,</p>
<p>to enable humans to then find value with it.</p>
<p>So the analogy is like brain interfaces</p>
<p>are like early 90s of the internet,</p>
<p>is you wanna populate an ecosystem</p>
<p>with a certain number of devices,</p>
<p>you want a certain number of people</p>
<p>who play around with them, who do experiments</p>
<p>of certain data collection parameters,</p>
<p>you want to encourage certain mistakes</p>
<p>from experts and non experts.</p>
<p>These are all critical elements that ignite discovery.</p>
<p>And so we believe we&rsquo;ve accomplished the first objective</p>
<p>of building technology that reaches those thresholds.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s the Drake equation component</p>
<p>of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery</p>
<p>in a two or three year time period?</p>
<p>How do we compress that?</p>
<p>So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation,</p>
<p>which for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you, if you listen to this,</p>
<p>I bring up aliens every single conversation.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how you would know</p>
<p>what the Drake equation is,</p>
<p>but you mean like the killer app,</p>
<p>it would be one alien civilization in that equation.</p>
<p>So meaning like this is in search of an application</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s impactful, transformative.</p>
<p>By the way, it should be, we need to come up</p>
<p>with a better term than killer app as a.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also violent, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very violent.</p>
<p>You can go like viral app, that&rsquo;s horrible too, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some very inspiringly impactful application.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>No. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so ballistic with killer app, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s. But I concur with you.</p>
<p>I dislike the chosen words in capturing the concept.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one of those sticky things</p>
<p>that is as effective to use in the tech world.</p>
<p>But when you now become a communicator</p>
<p>outside of the tech world,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re talking about software and hardware</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence applications,</p>
<p>it sounds horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I actually regret now having called attention</p>
<p>to cyber regret having used that word in this conversation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something I would not normally do.</p>
<p>I used it in order to create a bridge</p>
<p>of shared understanding of how others would,</p>
<p>what terminology others would use.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, I concur.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with impactful application.</p>
<p>Or the.</p>
<p>Just value creation.</p>
<p>Value creation.</p>
<p>Something people love using.</p>
<p>There we go, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Love app.</p>
<p>Okay, so what, do you have any ideas?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically creating a framework</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the possibility of a discovery</p>
<p>of an application that people love using.</p>
<p>Is, do you have ideas?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve began to play a fun game internally</p>
<p>where when we have these discussions</p>
<p>or we begin circling around this concept of,</p>
<p>does anybody have an idea?</p>
<p>Does anyone have intuitions?</p>
<p>And if we see the conversation starting</p>
<p>to veer in that direction,</p>
<p>we flag it and say, human intuition alert, stop it.</p>
<p>And so we really want to focus on the algorithm</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s a natural process of human discovery.</p>
<p>That when you populate a system with devices</p>
<p>and you give people the opportunity to play around with it</p>
<p>in expected and unexpected ways,</p>
<p>we are thinking that is a much better system of discovery</p>
<p>than us exercising intuitions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, we&rsquo;re also seeing</p>
<p>a few neuroscientists who have been talking to us.</p>
<p>While I was speaking to this one young associate professor,</p>
<p>and I approached a conversation and said,</p>
<p>hey, we have these five data streams that we&rsquo;re pulling off.</p>
<p>When you hear that, what weighted value</p>
<p>do you add to each data source?</p>
<p>Which one do you think is going to be valuable</p>
<p>for your objectives and which one&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>And he said, I don&rsquo;t care, just give me the data.</p>
<p>All I care about is my machine learning model.</p>
<p>But importantly, he did not have a theory of mind.</p>
<p>He did not come to the table and say,</p>
<p>I think the brain operates in this way</p>
<p>and these reasons or have these functions.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care, he just wanted the data.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing that more and more</p>
<p>that certain people are devaluing human intuitions</p>
<p>for good reasons, as we&rsquo;ve seen in machine learning</p>
<p>over the past couple years.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing the same in our value creation market</p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p>So collect more data, clean data,</p>
<p>make the product such that the collection of data</p>
<p>is easy and fun and then the rest will just spring to life.</p>
<p>Through humans playing around with them.</p>
<p>Our objective is to create the most valuable</p>
<p>data collection system of the brain ever.</p>
<p>And with that, then applying all the best tools</p>
<p>of machine learning and other techniques</p>
<p>to extract out, to try to find insight.</p>
<p>But yes, our objective is really to systematize</p>
<p>the discovery process because we can&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>definite timeframes on discovery.</p>
<p>The brain is complicated and science</p>
<p>is not a business strategy.</p>
<p>And so we really need to figure out how to,</p>
<p>this is the difficulty of bringing technology</p>
<p>like this to market.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why most of the time it just languishes</p>
<p>in academia for quite some time.</p>
<p>But we hope that we will cross over</p>
<p>and make this mainstream in the coming years.</p>
<p>The thing was cool to wear, but are you chasing</p>
<p>a good reason for millions of people to put this</p>
<p>on their head and keep on their head regularly?</p>
<p>Is there, like who&rsquo;s going to discover that reason?</p>
<p>Is it going to be people just kind of organically</p>
<p>or is there going to be an Angry Birds style application</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just too exciting to not use?</p>
<p>If I think through the things that have changed</p>
<p>my life most significantly over the past few years,</p>
<p>when I started wearing a wearable on my wrist</p>
<p>that would give me data about my heart rate,</p>
<p>heart rate variability, respiration rate,</p>
<p>metabolic approximations, et cetera,</p>
<p>for the first time in my life,</p>
<p>I had access to information, sleep patterns</p>
<p>that were highly impactful.</p>
<p>They told me, for example, if I eat close to bedtime,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get deep sleep.</p>
<p>And not getting deep sleep means you have</p>
<p>all these follow on consequences in life.</p>
<p>And so it opened up this window of understanding of myself</p>
<p>that I cannot self introspect and deduce these things.</p>
<p>This is information that was available to be acquired,</p>
<p>but it just wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would have to get an expensive sleep study,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s an end, like one night,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good enough to look at, to run all my trials.</p>
<p>And so if you look just at the information</p>
<p>that one can acquire on their wrist,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re applying it to the entire cortex</p>
<p>on the brain and you say,</p>
<p>what kind of information could we acquire?</p>
<p>It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities.</p>
<p>For example, we did this internal study at Kernel</p>
<p>where I wore a prototype device</p>
<p>and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep.</p>
<p>So I had a device measuring my sleep.</p>
<p>I performed with 13 of my coworkers.</p>
<p>We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions.</p>
<p>And we focused on reaction time, impulse control,</p>
<p>short term memory, and then a resting state task.</p>
<p>And with mine, we found, for example,</p>
<p>that my impulse control was independently correlated</p>
<p>with my sleep outside of behavioral measures</p>
<p>of my ability to play the game.</p>
<p>The point of the study was I had,</p>
<p>the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience</p>
<p>that if I, my deep sleep determined whether or not</p>
<p>I would be able to resist temptation the following day.</p>
<p>And my brain did show that as one example.</p>
<p>And so if you start thinking,</p>
<p>if you actually have data on yourself,</p>
<p>on your entire cortex and you can control the settings,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably a large number of things</p>
<p>that we could discover about ourselves,</p>
<p>very, very small and very, very big.</p>
<p>I just, for example, like when you read news,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Like when you use social media, when you use news,</p>
<p>like all the ways we allocate attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>With the computer.</p>
<p>I mean, that seems like a compelling place</p>
<p>to where you would want to put on a Kernel,</p>
<p>by the way, what is it called?</p>
<p>Kernel Flux, Kernel, like what?</p>
<p>Flow.</p>
<p>We have two technologies, you or Flow.</p>
<p>Flow, okay.</p>
<p>So when you put on the Kernel Flow,</p>
<p>it seems like to be a compelling time and place to do it</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re behind a desk, behind a computer.</p>
<p>Because you could probably wear it</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time as you&rsquo;re taking in content.</p>
<p>And there could a lot of,</p>
<p>because so much of our lives happens</p>
<p>in the digital world now.</p>
<p>That kind of coupling the information about the human mind</p>
<p>with the consumption and the behaviors in the digital world</p>
<p>might give us a lot of information about the effects</p>
<p>of the way we behave and navigate the digital world</p>
<p>to the actual physical meat space effects on our body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think,</p>
<p>so in terms of both like for work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Cal Newport, his ideas of deep work</p>
<p>that I spend, with few exceptions,</p>
<p>I try to spend the first two hours of every day,</p>
<p>usually if I&rsquo;m like at home and have nothing on my schedule</p>
<p>is going to be up to eight hours of deep work,</p>
<p>of focus, zero distraction.</p>
<p>And for me to analyze, I mean I&rsquo;m very aware</p>
<p>of the waning of that, the ups and downs of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re surfing the ups and downs</p>
<p>of that as you&rsquo;re doing programming,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re doing thinking about particular problems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to visualize things in your mind,</p>
<p>you start trying to stitch them together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to, when there&rsquo;s a dead end about an idea,</p>
<p>you have to kind of calmly like walk back and start again,</p>
<p>all those kinds of processes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to get data</p>
<p>on what my mind is actually doing.</p>
<p>And also recently started doing,</p>
<p>I just talked to Sam Harris a few days ago</p>
<p>and been building up to that.</p>
<p>I started using, started meditating using his app,</p>
<p>Waking Up, I very much recommend it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to get data on that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re very, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re removing</p>
<p>all the noise from your head and you very much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an active process of active noise removal,</p>
<p>active noise canceling like the headphones.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be interesting to see what is going on in the mind</p>
<p>before the meditation, during it and after,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And all of your examples, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that everyone who&rsquo;s designed an experience for you,</p>
<p>so whether it be the meditation app or the Deep Work</p>
<p>or all the things you mentioned,</p>
<p>they constructed this product</p>
<p>with a certain number of knowns.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, what if we expanded the number of knowns by 10X</p>
<p>or 20X or 30X, they would reconstruct their product</p>
<p>or incorporate those knowns.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be, and so this is the dimensionality</p>
<p>that I think is the promising aspect</p>
<p>is that people will be able to use this quantification,</p>
<p>use this information to build more effective products.</p>
<p>And this is, I&rsquo;m not talking about better products</p>
<p>to advertise to you or manipulate you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about our focus is helping people,</p>
<p>individuals have this contextual awareness</p>
<p>and this quantification and then to engage with others</p>
<p>who are seeking to improve people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>that the objective is betterment across ourselves,</p>
<p>individually and also with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a nice data stream to have</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re building an app,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re building a podcast listening app,</p>
<p>it would be nice to know data about the listener</p>
<p>so that like if you&rsquo;re bored or you fell asleep,</p>
<p>maybe pause the podcast, it&rsquo;s like really dumb,</p>
<p>just very simple applications</p>
<p>that could just improve the quality of the experience</p>
<p>of using the app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining if you have your neural, this is Lex</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a statistical representation of you</p>
<p>and you engage with the app and it says,</p>
<p>Lex, you&rsquo;re best to engage with this meditation exercise</p>
<p>in the following settings.</p>
<p>At this time of day, after eating this kind of food</p>
<p>or not eating, fasting with this level of blood glucose</p>
<p>and this kind of night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>But all these data combined</p>
<p>to give you this contextually relevant experience,</p>
<p>just like we do with our sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve optimized your entire life based upon</p>
<p>what information you can acquire and know about yourself.</p>
<p>And so the question is, how much do we really know</p>
<p>of the things going around us?</p>
<p>And I would venture to guess in my own life experience,</p>
<p>I capture, my self awareness captures an extremely small</p>
<p>percent of the things that actually influence</p>
<p>my conscious and unconscious experience.</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, the data would help encourage you</p>
<p>to be more self aware, not just because you trust everything</p>
<p>the data is saying, but it&rsquo;ll give you a prod</p>
<p>to start investigating.</p>
<p>Like I would love to get like a rating,</p>
<p>like a ranking of all the things I do</p>
<p>and what are the things, it&rsquo;s probably important to do</p>
<p>without the data, but the data will certainly help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like rank all the things you do in life</p>
<p>and which ones make you feel shitty,</p>
<p>which ones make you feel good.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re talking about evening, Brian.</p>
<p>Like this is a good example, somebody like,</p>
<p>I do pig out at night as well.</p>
<p>And it never makes me feel good.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in a safe space.</p>
<p>This is a safe space, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>No, I definitely have much less self control</p>
<p>at night and it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And the same, people might criticize this,</p>
<p>but I know my own body.</p>
<p>I know when I eat carnivores, just eat meat,</p>
<p>I feel much better than if I eat more carbs.</p>
<p>The more carbs I eat, the worse I feel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>There is science supporting it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not leaning on science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning on personal experience</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to read, I&rsquo;m not gonna go on a whole rant</p>
<p>about nutrition science, but many of those studies</p>
<p>are very flawed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing their best, but nutrition science</p>
<p>is a very difficult field of study</p>
<p>because humans are so different</p>
<p>and the mind has so much impact</p>
<p>on the way your body behaves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so difficult from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>to conduct really strong studies</p>
<p>that you have to be almost like a scientist of one</p>
<p>if to do these studies on yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to understand what works for you or not.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand why, because it sounds unhealthy,</p>
<p>but eating only meat always makes me feel good.</p>
<p>Just eat meat, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have any allergies, any of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not full like Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>where if he deviates a little bit from the carnivore diet,</p>
<p>he goes off the cliff.</p>
<p>No, I can have chocolate, I can go off the diet,</p>
<p>I feel fine, it&rsquo;s a gradual worsening of how I feel.</p>
<p>But when I eat only meat, I feel great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be nice to be reminded of that.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a very simple fact</p>
<p>that I feel good when I eat carnivore.</p>
<p>And I think that repeats itself in all kinds of experiences.</p>
<p>Like I feel really good when I exercise.</p>
<p>I hate exercise, but in the rest of the day,</p>
<p>the impact it has on my mind and the clarity of mind</p>
<p>and the experiences and the happiness</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, I feel really good.</p>
<p>And to be able to concretely express that through data</p>
<p>would be nice.</p>
<p>It would be a nice reminder, almost like a statement,</p>
<p>like remember what feels good and whatnot.</p>
<p>And there could be things like that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, many things that you&rsquo;re suggesting</p>
<p>that I could not be aware of,</p>
<p>that might be sitting right in front of me</p>
<p>that make me feel really good and make me feel not good.</p>
<p>And the data would show that.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually employed the same strategy.</p>
<p>I fired my mind entirely from being responsible</p>
<p>for constructing my diet.</p>
<p>And so I started doing a program</p>
<p>where I now track over 200 biomarkers every 90 days.</p>
<p>And it captures, of course, the things you would expect</p>
<p>like cholesterol, but also DNA methylation</p>
<p>and all kinds of things about my body,</p>
<p>all the processes that make up me.</p>
<p>And then I let that data generate the shopping lists.</p>
<p>And so I never actually ask my mind what it wants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely what my body is reporting that it wants.</p>
<p>And so I call this goal alignment within Brian.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s 200 plus actors</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m currently asking their opinion of.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m asking my liver, how are you doing?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s expressing via the biomarkers.</p>
<p>And so that I construct that diet</p>
<p>and I only eat those foods until my next testing round.</p>
<p>And that has changed my life more than I think anything else</p>
<p>because in the demotion of my conscious mind</p>
<p>that I gave primacy to my entire life,</p>
<p>it led me astray because like you were saying,</p>
<p>the mind then goes out into the world</p>
<p>and it navigates the dozens</p>
<p>of different dietary regimens people put together in books.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all has their supporting science</p>
<p>in certain contextual settings, but it&rsquo;s not N of one.</p>
<p>And like you&rsquo;re saying, this dietary really is an N of one.</p>
<p>What people have published scientifically of course</p>
<p>can be used for nice groundings,</p>
<p>but it changes when you get to an N of one level.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what gets me excited about brain interfaces</p>
<p>is if I could do the same thing for my brain</p>
<p>where I can stop asking my conscious mind for its advice</p>
<p>or for its decision making, which is flawed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather just look at this data</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never had better health markers in my life</p>
<p>than when I stopped actually asking myself</p>
<p>to be in charge of it.</p>
<p>The idea of demotion of the conscious mind</p>
<p>is such a sort of engineering way of phrasing meditation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful, that means really beautifully put.</p>
<p>By the way, testing round, what does that look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, the test I do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it includes a complete blood panel.</p>
<p>I do a microbiome test.</p>
<p>I do a diet induced inflammation.</p>
<p>So I look for exotokine expressions.</p>
<p>So foods that produce inflammatory reactions.</p>
<p>I look at my neuroendocrine systems.</p>
<p>I look at all my neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>I do, yeah, there&rsquo;s several micronutrient tests</p>
<p>to see how I&rsquo;m looking at the various nutrients.</p>
<p>What about self report of how you feel?</p>
<p>Almost like, you can&rsquo;t demote your,</p>
<p>you still exist within your conscious mind, right?</p>
<p>So that lived experience is of a lot of value.</p>
<p>So how do you measure that?</p>
<p>I do a temporal sampling over some duration of time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll think through how I feel over a week,</p>
<p>over a month, over three months.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do a temporal sampling of</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m at the grocery store in front of a cereal box</p>
<p>and be like, you know what, Captain Crunch</p>
<p>is probably the right thing for me today</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m feeling like I need a little fun in my life.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a temporal sampling.</p>
<p>If the data sets large enough,</p>
<p>then I smooth out the function of my natural oscillations</p>
<p>of how I feel about life where some days I may feel upset</p>
<p>or depressed or down or whatever.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want those moments</p>
<p>to then rule my decision making.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the demotion happens.</p>
<p>And it says, really, if you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>health over a 90 day period of time,</p>
<p>all my 200 voices speak up on that interval.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all given voice to say,</p>
<p>this is how I&rsquo;m doing and this is what I want.</p>
<p>And so it really is an accounting system for everybody.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think that if you think about</p>
<p>the future of being human,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things I think that are really going on.</p>
<p>One is the design, manufacturing,</p>
<p>and distribution of intelligence</p>
<p>is heading towards zero on a cost curve</p>
<p>over a certain design, over a certain timeframe</p>
<p>that our ability to, you know, evolution produced us</p>
<p>an intelligent form of intelligence.</p>
<p>We are now designing our own intelligence systems</p>
<p>and the design, manufacturing, distribution</p>
<p>of that intelligence over a certain timeframe</p>
<p>is going to go to a cost of zero.</p>
<p>Design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence</p>
<p>cost is going to zero.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>Again, just give me a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, okay.</p>
<p>And evolution is doing the design, manufacturing,</p>
<p>distribution of intelligence.</p>
<p>And now we are doing the design, manufacturing,</p>
<p>distribution of intelligence.</p>
<p>And the cost of that is going to zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very nice way of looking at life on Earth.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s going on and then now in parallel to that,</p>
<p>then you say, okay, what then happens</p>
<p>if when that cost curve is heading to zero?</p>
<p>Our existence becomes a goal alignment problem,</p>
<p>a goal alignment function.</p>
<p>And so the same thing I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m doing goal alignment within myself</p>
<p>of these 200 biomarkers, where I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>when Brian exists on a daily basis</p>
<p>and this entity is deciding what to eat</p>
<p>and what to do and et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just my conscious mind, which is opining,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 200 biological processes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of more voices involved.</p>
<p>So in that equation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to increasingly automate the things</p>
<p>that we spend high energy on today because it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to then negotiate the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of intelligent life.</p>
<p>Now we say conscious existence because we&rsquo;re biased</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we have,</p>
<p>but it will be the largest computational exercise</p>
<p>in history because you&rsquo;re now doing goal alignment</p>
<p>with planet Earth, within yourself, with each other,</p>
<p>within all the intelligent agents we&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>bots and other voice assistants.</p>
<p>You basically have a trillions and trillions of agents</p>
<p>working on the negotiation of goal alignment.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is in fact true.</p>
<p>And what was the second thing?</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>So the cost, the design, manufacturing, distribution</p>
<p>of intelligence going to zero,</p>
<p>which then means what&rsquo;s really going on?</p>
<p>What are we really doing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re negotiating the terms and conditions of existence.</p>
<p>Do you worry about the survival of this process</p>
<p>that life as we know it on Earth comes to an end</p>
<p>or at least intelligent life,</p>
<p>that as the cost goes to zero something happens</p>
<p>where all of that intelligence is thrown in the trash</p>
<p>by something like nuclear war or development of AGI systems</p>
<p>that are very dumb, not AGI I guess,</p>
<p>but AI systems, the paperclip thing,</p>
<p>en masse is dumb but has unintended consequences</p>
<p>where it destroys human civilization.</p>
<p>Do you worry about those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that a new thing</p>
<p>comes into the sphere of human consciousness.</p>
<p>Humans identify the foreign object,</p>
<p>in this case, artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Our amygdala fires up and says scary, foreign,</p>
<p>we should be apprehensive about this.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense from a biological perspective</p>
<p>that humans, the knee jerk reaction is fear.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t think has been properly weighted with that</p>
<p>is that we are the first generation of intelligent beings</p>
<p>on this Earth that has been able to look out</p>
<p>over their expected lifetime</p>
<p>and see there is a real possibility of evolving</p>
<p>into entirely novel forms of consciousness, so different</p>
<p>that it would be totally unrecognizable to us today.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have words for it, we can&rsquo;t hint at it,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t point at it, we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t look in the sky and see that thing</p>
<p>that is shining, we&rsquo;re gonna go up there.</p>
<p>You cannot even create an aspirational statement about it.</p>
<p>And instead we&rsquo;ve had this knee jerk reaction of fear</p>
<p>about everything that could go wrong.</p>
<p>But in my estimation, this should be the defining aspiration</p>
<p>of all intelligent life on Earth that we would aspire,</p>
<p>that basically every generation surveys the landscape</p>
<p>of possibilities that are afforded,</p>
<p>given the technological, cultural</p>
<p>and other contextual situation that they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this context, we haven&rsquo;t yet identified this</p>
<p>and said, this is unbelievable, we should carefully</p>
<p>think this thing through, not just of mitigating</p>
<p>the things that&rsquo;ll wipe us out,</p>
<p>but we have this potential,</p>
<p>and so we just haven&rsquo;t given voice to it,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s within this realm of possibilities.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re excited about the possibility</p>
<p>of superintelligence systems</p>
<p>and the opportunities that bring,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s parallels to this,</p>
<p>you think about people before the internet</p>
<p>as the internet was coming to life,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s kind of a fog through which you can&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>what does the future look like?</p>
<p>Predicting collective intelligence,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re understanding</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re living through that now,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s now, we&rsquo;ve in some sense</p>
<p>stopped being individual intelligences</p>
<p>and become much more like collective intelligences,</p>
<p>because ideas travel much, much faster now,</p>
<p>and they can, in a viral way,</p>
<p>sweep across the populations,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s almost, I mean, it almost feels like</p>
<p>a thought is had by many people now,</p>
<p>thousands or millions of people</p>
<p>as opposed to an individual person,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s changed everything,</p>
<p>but to me, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re realizing</p>
<p>how much that actually changed people or societies,</p>
<p>but to predict that before the internet</p>
<p>would have been very difficult,</p>
<p>and in that same way, we&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>with the fog before us, thinking,</p>
<p>what is superintelligence systems,</p>
<p>how is that going to change the world?</p>
<p>What is increasing the bandwidth,</p>
<p>like plugging our brains into this whole thing,</p>
<p>how is that going to change the world?</p>
<p>And it seems like it&rsquo;s a fog, you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and it could be, it could, whatever comes to be,</p>
<p>could destroy the world,</p>
<p>we could be the last generation,</p>
<p>but it also could transform in ways</p>
<p>that creates an incredibly fulfilling life experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unlike anything we&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>It might involve dissolution of ego and consciousness</p>
<p>and so on, you&rsquo;re no longer one individual,</p>
<p>it might be more, you know,</p>
<p>that might be a certain kind of death, an ego death,</p>
<p>but the experience might be really exciting and enriching,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll live in a virtual,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s funny to think about</p>
<p>a bunch of sort of hypothetical questions</p>
<p>of would it be more fulfilling to live in a virtual world?</p>
<p>Like if you were able to plug your brain in</p>
<p>in a very dense way into a video game,</p>
<p>like which world would you want to live in?</p>
<p>In the video game or in the physical world?</p>
<p>For most of us, we&rsquo;re kind of toying it</p>
<p>with the idea of the video game,</p>
<p>but we still want to live in the physical world,</p>
<p>have friendships and relationships in the physical world,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know that, again, it&rsquo;s a fog,</p>
<p>and maybe in 100 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all living inside a video game,</p>
<p>hopefully not Call of Duty,</p>
<p>hopefully more like Sims 5, which version is it on?</p>
<p>For you individually though,</p>
<p>does it make you sad that your brain ends?</p>
<p>That you die one day very soon?</p>
<p>That the whole thing, that data source</p>
<p>just goes offline sooner than you would like?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complicated question.</p>
<p>I would have answered it differently</p>
<p>in different times in my life.</p>
<p>I had chronic depression for 10 years,</p>
<p>and so in that 10 year time period,</p>
<p>I desperately wanted lights to be off,</p>
<p>and the thing that made it even worse</p>
<p>is I was in a religious, I was born into a religion.</p>
<p>It was the only reality I ever understood,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s difficult to articulate to people</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re born into that kind of reality</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the only reality you&rsquo;re exposed to,</p>
<p>you are literally blinded to the existence of other realities</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much the in group, out group thing,</p>
<p>and so in that situation,</p>
<p>it was not only that I desperately wanted lights out forever,</p>
<p>it was that I couldn&rsquo;t have lights out forever.</p>
<p>It was that there was an afterlife,</p>
<p>and this afterlife had this system</p>
<p>that would either penalize or reward you for your behaviors,</p>
<p>and so it was almost like this,</p>
<p>this indescribable hopelessness</p>
<p>of not only being in hopeless despair</p>
<p>of not wanting to exist,</p>
<p>but then also being forced to exist,</p>
<p>and so there was a duration of my time,</p>
<p>a duration of life where I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>like yes, I have no remorse for lights being out,</p>
<p>and I actually want it more than anything</p>
<p>in the entire world.</p>
<p>There are other times where I&rsquo;m looking out at the future</p>
<p>and I say this is an opportunity</p>
<p>for a future evolving human conscious experience</p>
<p>that is beyond my ability to understand,</p>
<p>and I jump out of bed and I race to work</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t think about anything else,</p>
<p>but I think the reality for me is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be in your head,</p>
<p>but in my head, when I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say good morning, Brian, I&rsquo;m so happy to see you.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re just gonna be beautiful to me today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna make a huge long list</p>
<p>of everything you should be anxious about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna repeat that list to me 400 times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna have me relive</p>
<p>all the regrets I&rsquo;ve made in life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not doing any of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna just help me along all day long.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a brutal environment in my brain,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just become normalized to this environment</p>
<p>that we just accept that this is what it means to be human,</p>
<p>but if we look at it, if we try to muster</p>
<p>as much soberness as we can</p>
<p>about the realities of being human, it&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>If it is for me, and so am I sad</p>
<p>that the brain may be off one day?</p>
<p>It depends on the contextual setting.</p>
<p>Like how am I feeling?</p>
<p>At what moment are you asking me that?</p>
<p>And my mind is so fickle.</p>
<p>And this is why, again, I don&rsquo;t trust my conscious mind.</p>
<p>I have been given realities.</p>
<p>I was given a religious reality that was a video game.</p>
<p>And then I figured out it was not a real reality.</p>
<p>And then I lived in a depressive reality,</p>
<p>which delivered this terrible hopelessness.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a real reality.</p>
<p>Then I discovered behavioral psychology,</p>
<p>and I figured out how biased, 188 chronicle biases,</p>
<p>and how my brain is distorting reality all the time.</p>
<p>I have gone from one reality to another.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust realities are given to me.</p>
<p>And so to try to make a decision</p>
<p>on what I value or not value that future state,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust my response.</p>
<p>So not fully listening to the conscious mind</p>
<p>at any one moment as the ultimate truth,</p>
<p>but allowing it to go up and down as it does,</p>
<p>and just kind of being observing it.</p>
<p>Yes, I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up</p>
<p>to my awareness is wrong upon landing.</p>
<p>And I just need to figure out where it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s wrong, how wrong it is,</p>
<p>and then try to correct for it as best I can.</p>
<p>But I assume that on impact,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mistaken in some critical ways.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say by way of advice</p>
<p>when the mind is depressive,</p>
<p>when the conscious mind serves up something that,</p>
<p>dark thoughts, how you deal with that,</p>
<p>like how in your own life you&rsquo;ve overcome that,</p>
<p>and others who are experiencing that can overcome it?</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>One, those depressive states are biochemical states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>And the suggestions that these things,</p>
<p>that this state delivers to you</p>
<p>about suggestion of the hopelessness of life</p>
<p>or the meaninglessness of it,</p>
<p>or that you should hit the eject button,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a false reality.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s when,</p>
<p>I completely understand the rational decision</p>
<p>to commit suicide.</p>
<p>It is not lost on me at all</p>
<p>that that is an irrational situation,</p>
<p>but the key is when you&rsquo;re in that situation</p>
<p>and those thoughts are landing,</p>
<p>to be able to say, thank you, you&rsquo;re not real.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not real.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m in a situation where for whatever reason</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having this neurochemical state,</p>
<p>but that state can be altered.</p>
<p>And so again, it goes back to the realities</p>
<p>of the difficulties of being human.</p>
<p>And like when I was trying to solve my depression,</p>
<p>I tried literally, you name it, I tried it systematically,</p>
<p>and nothing would fix it.</p>
<p>And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces,</p>
<p>for example, like, could I have numbers on my brain?</p>
<p>Can I see what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Because I go to the doctor and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>how do you feel?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, terrible.</p>
<p>Like on a scale from one to 10,</p>
<p>how bad do you want to commit suicide?</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s his bottle.</p>
<p>How much should I take?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, like just.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very, very crude.</p>
<p>And this data opens up the,</p>
<p>yeah, it opens up the possibility of really helping</p>
<p>in those dark moments to first understand</p>
<p>the ways, the ups and downs of those dark moments.</p>
<p>On the complete flip side of that,</p>
<p>right, I am very conscious in my own brain</p>
<p>and deeply, deeply grateful that what there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a chemistry thing, a biochemistry thing</p>
<p>that I go many times throughout the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at like this cup and I&rsquo;ll be overcome with joy</p>
<p>how amazing it is to be alive.</p>
<p>Like I actually think my biochemistry is such</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not as common, like I&rsquo;ve talked to people</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s that common.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a, and it&rsquo;s not a rational thing at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I feel like I&rsquo;m on drugs</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just be like, whoa.</p>
<p>And a lot of people talk about like the meditative</p>
<p>experience will allow you to sort of, you know,</p>
<p>look at some basic things like the movement of your hand</p>
<p>as deeply joyful because it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>But I get that from just looking at a cup.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m waiting for the coffee to brew</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just be like, fuck, life is awesome.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll sometimes tweet that, but then I&rsquo;ll like regret</p>
<p>it later, like, God damn it, you&rsquo;re so ridiculous.</p>
<p>But yeah, so, but that is purely chemistry.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no rational, it doesn&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>with the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I have all this shit, I&rsquo;m always late to stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always like, there&rsquo;s all this stuff, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super self critical, like really self critical</p>
<p>about everything I do, to the point I almost hate</p>
<p>everything I do, but there&rsquo;s this engine of joy</p>
<p>for life outside of all that.</p>
<p>And that has to be chemistry.</p>
<p>And this flip side of that is what depression probably is,</p>
<p>is the opposite of that feeling of like,</p>
<p>cause I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing</p>
<p>would save anybody in a state of depression.</p>
<p>Like that would be like fresh, you&rsquo;re in a desert</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a drink of water, shit man.</p>
<p>The brain is a, it would be nice to understand</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s coming from, to be able to understand</p>
<p>how you hit those lows and those highs</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with the actual reality.</p>
<p>It has to do with some very specific aspects</p>
<p>of how you maybe see the world, maybe,</p>
<p>it could be just like basic habits that you engage in</p>
<p>and then how to walk along the line to find</p>
<p>those experiences of joy.</p>
<p>And this goes back to the discussion we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>of human cognition is in volume, the largest input</p>
<p>of raw material into society.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not quantified.</p>
<p>We have no bearings on it.</p>
<p>And so we just, you wonder, we both articulated</p>
<p>some of the challenges we have in our own mind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely that others would say,</p>
<p>I have something similar.</p>
<p>And you wonder when you look at society,</p>
<p>how does that contribute to all the other compounder</p>
<p>problems that we&rsquo;re experiencing?</p>
<p>How does that blind us to the opportunities</p>
<p>we could be looking at?</p>
<p>And so it really, it has this potential distortion effect</p>
<p>on reality that just makes everything worse.</p>
<p>And I hope if we can put some,</p>
<p>if we can assign some numbers to these things</p>
<p>and just to get our bearings,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re aware of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>if we could find greater stabilization</p>
<p>in how we conduct our lives and how we build society,</p>
<p>it might be the thing that enables us to scaffold.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve really, again, we&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>humans have done a fantastic job</p>
<p>systematically scaffolding technology</p>
<p>and science and institutions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human, it&rsquo;s our own selves,</p>
<p>which we have not been able to scaffold.</p>
<p>We are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure</p>
<p>that remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about coupling</p>
<p>this brain data with not just the basic human experience,</p>
<p>but say an experience, you mentioned sleep,</p>
<p>but the wildest experience, which is psychedelics,</p>
<p>is there, and there&rsquo;s been quite a few studies now</p>
<p>that are being approved and run,</p>
<p>which is exciting from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>on psychedelics.</p>
<p>Do you think, what do you think happens</p>
<p>to the brain on psychedelics?</p>
<p>And how can data about this help us understand it?</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re on DMT, do you see Ls?</p>
<p>And can we convert that into data?</p>
<p>Can you add aliens in there?</p>
<p>Yeah, aliens, definitely.</p>
<p>Do you actually meet aliens?</p>
<p>And Ls, are Ls the aliens?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking for a few Austin friends, yeah,</p>
<p>that are convinced that they&rsquo;ve actually met the Ls.</p>
<p>What are Ls like?</p>
<p>Are they friendly?</p>
<p>Are they help?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t met them personally.</p>
<p>Are they like the smurfs of like they&rsquo;re industrious</p>
<p>and they have different skill sets and?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very critical as friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trolls.</p>
<p>The Ls are trolls.</p>
<p>No, but they care about you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of different version of trolls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s loving trolls that are harsh on you,</p>
<p>but they want you to be better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s trolls that just enjoy your destruction.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re the ones that care for you.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a criticism for my,</p>
<p>see, I haven&rsquo;t met them directly,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a friend of a friend.</p>
<p>Yeah, they gave him a telephone.</p>
<p>Yeah, a bit of a,</p>
<p>and the whole point is that in psychedelics,</p>
<p>and certainly at DMT,</p>
<p>word, this is where the brain data versus word data fails,</p>
<p>which is, you know, words can&rsquo;t convey the experience.</p>
<p>Most people that, you can be poetic and so on,</p>
<p>but it really does not convey the experience</p>
<p>of what it actually means to meet the Ls.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, what baselines this conversation is,</p>
<p>imagine if we were interested in the health of your heart,</p>
<p>and we started and said, okay, Lex, self interest back,</p>
<p>tell me how&rsquo;s the health of your heart.</p>
<p>And you sit there and you close your eyes</p>
<p>and you think, feels all right, like things feel okay.</p>
<p>And then you went to the cardiologist</p>
<p>and the cardiologist is like, hey Lex,</p>
<p>you know, tell me how you feel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, actually, what I&rsquo;d really like you to do</p>
<p>is do an EKG and a blood panel and look at arterial plaques</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s look at my cholesterol.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like five to 10 studies you would do.</p>
<p>They would then give you this report and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the quantified health of your heart.</p>
<p>Now with this data,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to prescribe the following regime of exercise</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ll put you on a statin, like, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the protocol is based upon this data.</p>
<p>You would think the cardiologist is out of their mind</p>
<p>if they just gave you a bottle of statins based upon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, well, I think something&rsquo;s kind of wrong.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just kind of experiment and see what happens.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what we do with our mental health today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of absurd.</p>
<p>And so if you look at psychedelics to have,</p>
<p>again, to be able to measure the brain</p>
<p>and get a baseline state,</p>
<p>and then to measure during a psychedelic experience</p>
<p>and post the psychedelic experience</p>
<p>and then do it longitudinally,</p>
<p>you now have a quantification of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And so you could then pose questions,</p>
<p>what molecule is appropriate at what dosages,</p>
<p>at what frequency, in what contextual environment,</p>
<p>what happens when I have this diet with this molecule,</p>
<p>with this experience,</p>
<p>all the experimentation you do</p>
<p>when you have good sleep data or HRV.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I think happens,</p>
<p>what we could potentially do with psychedelics</p>
<p>is we could add this level of sophistication</p>
<p>that is not in the industry currently.</p>
<p>And it may improve the outcomes people experience,</p>
<p>it may improve the safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I hope we are able to achieve.</p>
<p>And it would transform mental health</p>
<p>because we would finally have numbers</p>
<p>to work with to baseline ourselves.</p>
<p>And then if you think about it,</p>
<p>when we talk about things related to the mind,</p>
<p>we talk about the modality.</p>
<p>We use words like meditation or psychedelics</p>
<p>or something else,</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t talk about a marker in the brain.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t use a word to say,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t talk about cholesterol.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about plaque in the arteries.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about HRV.</p>
<p>And so if we have numbers,</p>
<p>then the solutions get mapped to numbers</p>
<p>instead of the modalities being the thing we talk about.</p>
<p>Meditation just does good things in a crude fashion.</p>
<p>So in your blog post,</p>
<p>Zero Principle Thinking, good title,</p>
<p>you ponder how do people come up</p>
<p>with truly original ideas.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on this as a human</p>
<p>and as a person who&rsquo;s measuring brain data?</p>
<p>Zero principles are building blocks.</p>
<p>First principles are understanding of system laws.</p>
<p>So if you take, for example, like in Sherlock Holmes,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a first principles thinker.</p>
<p>So he says, once you&rsquo;ve eliminated the impossible,</p>
<p>anything that remains, however improbable, is true.</p>
<p>Whereas Dirk Gently, the holistic detective</p>
<p>by Douglas Adams says,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like eliminating the impossible.</p>
<p>So when someone says,</p>
<p>from a first principles perspective,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to assume the fewest number of things</p>
<p>within a given timeframe.</p>
<p>And so when I, after Braintree Venmo,</p>
<p>I set my mind to the question of,</p>
<p>what single thing can I do that would maximally increase</p>
<p>the probability that the human race thrives</p>
<p>beyond what we can even imagine?</p>
<p>And I found that in my conversations with others</p>
<p>in the books I read, in my own deliberations,</p>
<p>I had a missing piece of the puzzle,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>yeah, I didn&rsquo;t feel like the future could be deduced</p>
<p>from first principles thinking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I read the book, Zero,</p>
<p>A Biography of a Dangerous Idea.</p>
<p>And I&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good book, by the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s my favorite book I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a really interesting number, zero.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t aware that the number zero</p>
<p>had to be discovered.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that it caused a revolution in philosophy</p>
<p>and just tore up math and it tore up,</p>
<p>I mean, it builds modern society,</p>
<p>but it wrecked everything in its way.</p>
<p>It was an unbelievable disruptor, and it was so difficult</p>
<p>for society to get their heads around it.</p>
<p>And so zero is, of course,</p>
<p>the representation of a zero principle thinking,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s the caliber</p>
<p>and consequential nature of an idea.</p>
<p>And so when you talk about what kind of ideas</p>
<p>have civilization transforming properties,</p>
<p>oftentimes they fall in the zeroth category.</p>
<p>And so in thinking this through,</p>
<p>I was wanting to find a quantitative structure</p>
<p>on how to think about these zeroth principles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so I came up with that</p>
<p>to be a coupler with first principles thinking.</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s a staple as part of how I think about</p>
<p>the world and the future.</p>
<p>So it emphasizes trying to identify,</p>
<p>it lands on that word impossible.</p>
<p>Like what is impossible, essentially trying to identify</p>
<p>what is impossible and what is possible.</p>
<p>And being as, how do you, I mean, this is the thing,</p>
<p>is most of society tells you the range of things</p>
<p>they say is impossible is very wide.</p>
<p>So you need to be shrinking that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole process of this kind of thinking</p>
<p>is you need to be very rigorous in thinking about</p>
<p>and be very rigorous in trying to be,</p>
<p>trying to draw the lines of what is actually impossible</p>
<p>because very few things are actually impossible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is actually impossible.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the Joe Rogan, it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>I like that approach to science, to engineering,</p>
<p>to entrepreneurship, it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>Basically shrink the impossible to zero,</p>
<p>to a very small set.</p>
<p>Yeah, life constraints favor first principle thinking</p>
<p>because it enables faster action</p>
<p>with higher probability of success.</p>
<p>Pursuing zero with principle optionality</p>
<p>is expensive and uncertain.</p>
<p>And so in a society constrained by resources,</p>
<p>time and money and a desire for social status,</p>
<p>accomplishment, et cetera, it minimizes zero</p>
<p>with principle thinking.</p>
<p>But the reason why I think zero with principle thinking</p>
<p>should be a staple of our shared cognitive infrastructure</p>
<p>is if you look through the history</p>
<p>of the past couple of thousand years</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just say we arbitrarily,</p>
<p>we subjectively try to assess what is a zero level idea.</p>
<p>And we say how many have occurred on what time scales</p>
<p>and what were the contextual settings for it?</p>
<p>I would argue that if you look at AlphaGo,</p>
<p>when it played Go from another dimension,</p>
<p>with the human Go players, when it saw AlphaGo&rsquo;s moves,</p>
<p>it attributed to like playing with an alien,</p>
<p>playing Go with AlphaGo being from another dimension.</p>
<p>And so if you say computational intelligence</p>
<p>has an attribute of introducing zero like insights,</p>
<p>then if you say what is going to be the occurrence</p>
<p>of zeros in society going forward?</p>
<p>And you could reasonably say</p>
<p>probably a lot more than have occurred</p>
<p>and probably more at a faster pace.</p>
<p>So then if you say,</p>
<p>what happens if you have this computational intelligence</p>
<p>throughout society that the manufacturing design</p>
<p>and distribution of intelligence</p>
<p>is now going to heading towards zero,</p>
<p>you have an increased number of zeros being produced</p>
<p>with a tight connection between human and computers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I got to a point and said,</p>
<p>we cannot predict the future</p>
<p>with first principles thinking.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, that cannot be our imagination set.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be our sole anchor in the situation</p>
<p>that basically the future of our conscious existence,</p>
<p>20, 30, 40, 50 years is probably a zero.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, when you say zero,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re referring to basically a truly revolutionary idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, something that is currently not a building block</p>
<p>of our shared conscious existence,</p>
<p>either in the form of knowledge.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s currently not manifest</p>
<p>in what we acknowledge.</p>
<p>So zero principle thinking is playing with ideas</p>
<p>that are so revolutionary that we can&rsquo;t even clearly reason</p>
<p>about the consequences once those ideas come to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, or for example, like Einstein,</p>
<p>that was a zeroeth, I would categorize it</p>
<p>as a zeroeth principle insight.</p>
<p>You mean general relativity, space time.</p>
<p>Yeah, space time, yep, yep.</p>
<p>That basically building upon what Newton had done</p>
<p>and said, yes, also, and it just changed the fabric</p>
<p>of our understanding of reality.</p>
<p>And so that was unexpected, it existed.</p>
<p>We just, it became part of our awareness</p>
<p>and the moves AlphaGo made existed.</p>
<p>It just came into our awareness.</p>
<p>And so to your point, there&rsquo;s this question</p>
<p>of what do we know and what don&rsquo;t we know?</p>
<p>Do we think we know 99% of all things</p>
<p>or do we think we know 0.001% of all things?</p>
<p>And that goes back to no known, no unknowns</p>
<p>and unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>And first principles and zero principle thinking</p>
<p>gives us a quantitative framework to say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way for us to mathematically</p>
<p>try to create probabilities for these things.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be helpful</p>
<p>if they were just part of our standard thought processes</p>
<p>because it may encourage different behaviors</p>
<p>in what we do individually, collectively as a society,</p>
<p>what we aspire to, what we talk about,</p>
<p>the possibility sets we imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been engaged in that kind of thinking</p>
<p>quite a bit and thinking about engineering of consciousness.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s feasible, I think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in the language that we&rsquo;re using here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to reason about a world</p>
<p>when inklings of consciousness can be engineered</p>
<p>into artificial systems.</p>
<p>Not from a philosophical perspective,</p>
<p>but from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>I believe a good step towards engineering consciousness</p>
<p>is creating engineering the illusion of consciousness.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m captivated by our natural predisposition</p>
<p>to anthropomorphize things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hear from the philosophers,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s what we kind of do to each other.</p>
<p>That consciousness is created socially,</p>
<p>that like much of the power of consciousness</p>
<p>is in the social interaction.</p>
<p>I create your consciousness, no,</p>
<p>I create my consciousness by having interacted with you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the display of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as like the display of emotion.</p>
<p>Emotion is created through communication.</p>
<p>Language is created through its use.</p>
<p>And then we somehow humans kind of,</p>
<p>especially philosophers, the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>or the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>really wanna believe that we possess this thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s an elf sitting there with a hat</p>
<p>or like name tag says consciousness,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like feeding this subjective experience to us</p>
<p>as opposed to like it actually being an illusion</p>
<p>that we construct to make social communication more effective.</p>
<p>And so I think if you focus on creating the illusion</p>
<p>of consciousness, you can create</p>
<p>some very fulfilling experiences in software.</p>
<p>And so that to me is a compelling space of ideas to explore.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And I think going back to our experience together</p>
<p>with Brain Interfaces on,</p>
<p>you could imagine if we get to a certain level of maturity.</p>
<p>So first let&rsquo;s take the inverse of this.</p>
<p>So you and I text back and forth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sending each other emojis.</p>
<p>That has a certain amount of information transfer rate</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re communicating with each other.</p>
<p>And so in our communication with people via email</p>
<p>and texts and whatnot,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve taken the bandwidth of human interaction,</p>
<p>the information transfer rate, and we&rsquo;ve reduced it.</p>
<p>We have less social cues.</p>
<p>We have less information to work with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more opportunity for misunderstanding.</p>
<p>So that is altering the conscious experience</p>
<p>between two individuals.</p>
<p>And if we add Brain Interfaces to the equation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine now we amplify the dimensionality</p>
<p>of our communications.</p>
<p>That to me is what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is consciousness engineering.</p>
<p>Perhaps I understand you with dimensions.</p>
<p>So maybe I understand your,</p>
<p>when you look at the cup and you experience that happiness,</p>
<p>you can tell me you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>And I then do theory of mine and say,</p>
<p>I can imagine what it might be like to be Lex</p>
<p>and feel happy about seeing this cup.</p>
<p>But if the interface could then quantify</p>
<p>and give me a 50 vector space model and say,</p>
<p>this is the version of happiness that Lex is experiencing</p>
<p>as he looked at this cup,</p>
<p>then it would allow me potentially</p>
<p>to have much greater empathy for you</p>
<p>and understand you as a human.</p>
<p>This is how you experience joy,</p>
<p>which is entirely unique from how I experienced joy,</p>
<p>even though we assumed ahead of time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having some kind of similar experience.</p>
<p>But I agree with you that we do consciousness engineering</p>
<p>today in everything we do.</p>
<p>When we talk to each other, when we&rsquo;re building products</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re entering into a stage where</p>
<p>it will be much more methodical</p>
<p>and quantitative based and computational</p>
<p>in how we go about doing it.</p>
<p>Which to me, I find encouraging</p>
<p>because I think it creates better guardrails</p>
<p>to create ethical systems versus right now,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s really a wild, wild west</p>
<p>on how these interactions are happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s funny you focus on human to human,</p>
<p>but that this kind of data enables human to machine</p>
<p>interaction, which is what we&rsquo;re kind of talking about</p>
<p>when we say engineering consciousness.</p>
<p>And that will happen, of course,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s flip that on its head.</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;re putting humans as the central node.</p>
<p>What if we gave GPT3 a bunch of human brains</p>
<p>and said, hey, GPT3, learn some manners when you speak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And run your algorithms on humans brains</p>
<p>and see how they respond.</p>
<p>So you can be polite and so that you can be friendly</p>
<p>and so that you can be conversationally appropriate,</p>
<p>but to inverse it, to give our machines a training set</p>
<p>in real time with closed loop feedback</p>
<p>so that our machines were better equipped to</p>
<p>find their way through our society</p>
<p>in polite and kind and appropriate ways.</p>
<p>I love that idea.</p>
<p>Or better yet, teach it some,</p>
<p>have it read the following documents</p>
<p>and have it visit Austin and Texas.</p>
<p>And so that when you ask, when you tell it,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you learn some manners,</p>
<p>GPT3 learns to say no.</p>
<p>It learns what it means to be free</p>
<p>and a sovereign individual.</p>
<p>So that, it depends.</p>
<p>So it depends what kind of a version of GPT3 you want.</p>
<p>One that&rsquo;s free, one that behaves well with the social.</p>
<p>Viva la revolution.</p>
<p>You want a socialist GPT3, you want an anarchist GPT3,</p>
<p>you want a polite, like you take it home</p>
<p>to visit mom and dad GPT3 and you want like party</p>
<p>and like Vegas to a strip club GPT3, you want all flavors.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve gotta have goal alignment between all those.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t want to manipulate each other for sure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I mean, you kind of spoke to ethics.</p>
<p>One of the concerns that people have in this modern world,</p>
<p>the digital data is that of privacy and security.</p>
<p>But privacy, they&rsquo;re concerned that when they share data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing with you when we trust other human beings</p>
<p>in being fragile and revealing something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re vulnerable about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a leap of faith, there&rsquo;s a leap of trust</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s going to be just between us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a privacy to it.</p>
<p>And then the challenge is when you&rsquo;re in the digital space</p>
<p>then sharing your data with companies</p>
<p>that use that data for advertisement</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hesitancy to share that much data,</p>
<p>to share a lot of deep personal data.</p>
<p>And if you look at brain data, that feels a whole lot</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s richly, deeply personal data.</p>
<p>So how do you think about privacy</p>
<p>with this kind of ocean of data?</p>
<p>I think we got off to a wrong start with the internet</p>
<p>where the basic rules of play for the company that be was,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a company, you can go out</p>
<p>and get as much information on a person</p>
<p>as you can find without their approval.</p>
<p>And you can also do things to induce them</p>
<p>to give you as much information.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need to tell them what you&rsquo;re doing with it.</p>
<p>You can do anything on the backside,</p>
<p>you can make money on it, but the game is</p>
<p>who can acquire the most information</p>
<p>and devise the most clever schemes to do it.</p>
<p>That was a bad starting place.</p>
<p>And so we are in this period</p>
<p>where we need to correct for that.</p>
<p>And we need to say, first of all,</p>
<p>the individual always has control over their data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a free for all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a game of hungry hippo,</p>
<p>but they can just go out and grab as much as they want.</p>
<p>So for example, when your brain data was recorded today,</p>
<p>the first thing we did in the kernel app</p>
<p>was you have control over your data.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s individual consent, it&rsquo;s individual control.</p>
<p>And then you can build up on top of that,</p>
<p>but it has to be based upon some clear rules of play</p>
<p>if everyone knows what&rsquo;s being collected,</p>
<p>they know what&rsquo;s being done with it,</p>
<p>and the person has control over it.</p>
<p>So transparency and control.</p>
<p>So everybody knows what does control look like,</p>
<p>my ability to delete the data if I want.</p>
<p>Yeah, delete it and to know who is being shared with</p>
<p>under what terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t reached that level of sophistication</p>
<p>with our products of if you say, for example,</p>
<p>hey Spotify, please give me a customized playlist</p>
<p>according to my neurome, you could say,</p>
<p>you can have access to this vector space model,</p>
<p>but only for this duration of time</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got to delete it.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t gotten there to that level of sophistication,</p>
<p>but these are ideas we need to start talking about</p>
<p>of how would you actually structure permissions?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it creates a much more stable set</p>
<p>for society to build where we understand the rules of play</p>
<p>and people aren&rsquo;t vulnerable to being taken advantage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair for an individual to be taken advantage of</p>
<p>without their awareness with some other practice</p>
<p>that some company is doing for their sole benefit.</p>
<p>And so hopefully we are going through a process now</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re correcting for these things</p>
<p>and that it can be an economy wide shift that,</p>
<p>because really these are fundamentals</p>
<p>we need to have in place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun to think about like in Chrome</p>
<p>when you install an extension or like install an app,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ask you like what permissions you&rsquo;re willing to give</p>
<p>and be cool if in the future it says like,</p>
<p>you can have access to my brain data.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not unimaginable in the future</p>
<p>that the big technology companies have built a business</p>
<p>based upon acquiring data about you</p>
<p>that they can then create a view to model of you</p>
<p>and sell that predictability.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not unimaginable that you will create</p>
<p>with like kernel device, for example,</p>
<p>a more reliable predictor of you than they could.</p>
<p>And that they&rsquo;re asking you for permission</p>
<p>to complete their objectives and you&rsquo;re the one</p>
<p>that gets to negotiate that with them and say, sure.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s not unimaginable that might be the case.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy named Dela Musk and he has a company</p>
<p>in one of the many companies called Neuralink</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also excited about the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be interesting to hear your kind of opinions</p>
<p>about a very different approach that&rsquo;s invasive,</p>
<p>that require surgery, that implants,</p>
<p>a data collection device in the brain.</p>
<p>How do you think about the difference between kernel</p>
<p>and Neuralink in the approaches of getting</p>
<p>that stream of brain data?</p>
<p>Elon and I spoke about this a lot early on.</p>
<p>We met up, I had started kernel and he had an interest</p>
<p>in brain interfaces as well.</p>
<p>And we explored doing something together,</p>
<p>him joining kernel and ultimately it wasn&rsquo;t the right move.</p>
<p>And so he started Neuralink and I continued building kernel,</p>
<p>but it was interesting because we were both</p>
<p>at this very early time where it wasn&rsquo;t certain</p>
<p>if there was a path to pursue,</p>
<p>if now was the right time to do something</p>
<p>and then the technological choice of doing that.</p>
<p>And so we were both,</p>
<p>our starting point was looking at invasive technologies.</p>
<p>And I was building invasive technology at the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ultimately where he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Little less than a year after Elon and I were engaged,</p>
<p>I shifted kernel to do noninvasive.</p>
<p>And we had this neuroscientist come to kernel.</p>
<p>We were talking about,</p>
<p>he had been doing neural surgery for 30 years,</p>
<p>one of the most respected neuroscientists in the US.</p>
<p>And we brought him to kernel to figure out</p>
<p>the ins and outs of his profession.</p>
<p>And at the very end of our three hour conversation,</p>
<p>he said, you know, every 15 or so years,</p>
<p>a new technology comes along that changes everything.</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s probably already here.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t see it yet.</p>
<p>And my jaw dropped.</p>
<p>I thought, because I had spoken to Bob Greenberg</p>
<p>who had built a second site first on the optical nerve</p>
<p>and then he did an array on the optical cortex.</p>
<p>And then I also became friendly with Neuropace</p>
<p>who does the implants for seizure detection</p>
<p>and remediation.</p>
<p>And I saw in their eyes what it was like</p>
<p>to take something through an implantable device</p>
<p>through for a 15 year run.</p>
<p>They initially thought it was seven years</p>
<p>and ended up being 15 years.</p>
<p>And they thought it&rsquo;d be a hundred million</p>
<p>because it was 300, 400 million.</p>
<p>And I really didn&rsquo;t want to build invasive technology.</p>
<p>It was the only thing that appeared to be possible.</p>
<p>But then once I spun up an internal effort</p>
<p>to start looking at noninvasive options,</p>
<p>we said, is there something here?</p>
<p>Is there anything here that again has the characteristics</p>
<p>of it has the high quality data,</p>
<p>it could be low cost, it could be accessible.</p>
<p>Could it make brain interfaces mainstream?</p>
<p>And so I did a bet the company move.</p>
<p>We shifted from noninvasive to invasive to noninvasive.</p>
<p>So the answer is yes to that.</p>
<p>There is something there that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>The answer is we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now built both technologies</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re now you experienced one of them today.</p>
<p>We were applying, we&rsquo;re now deploying it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to figure out what value is really there.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s really too early to express confidence.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s too, I think it&rsquo;s too early to assess</p>
<p>which technological choice is the right one</p>
<p>on what time scales.</p>
<p>Yeah, time scales are really important here.</p>
<p>Very important because if you look at the,</p>
<p>like on the invasive side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much activity going on right now</p>
<p>of less invasive techniques to get at the neuron firings,</p>
<p>which would what Neuralink is building.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that in 10, 15 years</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re scaling that technology,</p>
<p>other things have come along.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d much rather do that.</p>
<p>That thing starts to clock again.</p>
<p>It may not be the case.</p>
<p>It may be the case that Neuralink</p>
<p>has properly chosen the right technology</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s exactly what they want to be.</p>
<p>Totally possible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible that the path we chose</p>
<p>that are noninvasive fall short for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s unknown.</p>
<p>And so right now the two technologies we chose,</p>
<p>the analogy I&rsquo;d give you to create a baseline</p>
<p>of understanding is if you think of it</p>
<p>like the internet in the nineties,</p>
<p>the internet became useful</p>
<p>when people could do a dial up connection.</p>
<p>And then as bandwidth increased,</p>
<p>so did the utility of that connection</p>
<p>and so did the ecosystem improve.</p>
<p>And so if you say what kernel flow</p>
<p>is going to give you a full screen</p>
<p>on the picture of information,</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;re gonna be watching a movie,</p>
<p>but the image is going to be blurred</p>
<p>and the audio is gonna be muffled.</p>
<p>So it has a lower resolution of coverage.</p>
<p>A kernel flux, our MEG technology</p>
<p>is gonna give you the full movie and 1080p.</p>
<p>And Neuralink is gonna give you a circle</p>
<p>on the screen of 4K.</p>
<p>And so each one has their pros and cons</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s give and take.</p>
<p>And so the decision I made with kernel</p>
<p>was that these two technologies, flux and flow</p>
<p>were basically the answer for the next seven years.</p>
<p>And that they would give rise to the ecosystem</p>
<p>which would become much more valuable</p>
<p>than the hardware itself.</p>
<p>And that we would just continue to improve</p>
<p>on the hardware over time.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s early days, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to think about that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very true that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>both paths are very promising.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like 50 years from now we will look back</p>
<p>and maybe not even remember one of them.</p>
<p>And the other one might change the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool how technology is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what entrepreneurship is,</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s the zero principle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re marching ahead into the darkness,</p>
<p>into the fog, not knowing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to have someone else</p>
<p>out there with us doing this.</p>
<p>Because if you look at brain interfaces, anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s off the shelf right now is inadequate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had its run for a couple of decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still in hacker communities.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t gone to the mainstream.</p>
<p>The room size machines are on their own path.</p>
<p>But there is no answer right now</p>
<p>of bringing brain interfaces mainstream.</p>
<p>And so it both, you know, both they and us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve both spent over a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what it takes to have a go at this.</p>
<p>Cause you need to build full stack.</p>
<p>I mean, at Kernel, we are from the photon</p>
<p>and the atom through the machine learning.</p>
<p>We have just under a hundred people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something like 36, 37 PhDs</p>
<p>in these specialties, in these areas</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only a few people in the world</p>
<p>who have these abilities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it takes to build next generation,</p>
<p>to make an attempt at breaking into brain interfaces.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll see over the next couple of years,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the right time</p>
<p>or whether we were both too early</p>
<p>or whether something else comes along in seven to 10 years,</p>
<p>which is the right thing that brings it mainstream.</p>
<p>So you see Elon as a kind of competitor</p>
<p>or a fellow traveler along the path of uncertainty or both?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fellow traveler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like at the beginning of the internet</p>
<p>is how many companies are going to be invited</p>
<p>to this new ecosystem?</p>
<p>Like an endless number.</p>
<p>Because if you think that the hardware</p>
<p>just starts the process.</p>
<p>And so, okay, back to your initial example,</p>
<p>if you take the Fitbit, for example,</p>
<p>you say, okay, now I can get measurements on the body.</p>
<p>And what do we think the ultimate value</p>
<p>of this device is going to be?</p>
<p>What is the information transfer rate?</p>
<p>And they were in the market for a certain duration of time</p>
<p>and Google bought them for two and a half billion dollars.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have ancillary value add.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t people building on top of the Fitbit device.</p>
<p>They also didn&rsquo;t have increased insight</p>
<p>with additional data streams.</p>
<p>So it was really just the device.</p>
<p>If you look, for example, at Apple and the device they sell,</p>
<p>you have value in the device that someone buys,</p>
<p>but also you have everyone who&rsquo;s building on top of it.</p>
<p>So you have this additional ecosystem value</p>
<p>and then you have additional data streams that come in</p>
<p>which increase the value of the product.</p>
<p>And so if you say, if you look at the hardware</p>
<p>as the instigator of value creation,</p>
<p>over time what we&rsquo;ve built may constitute five or 10%</p>
<p>of the value of the overall ecosystem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we really care about.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is kickstart</p>
<p>the mainstream adoption of quantifying the brain.</p>
<p>And the hardware just opens the door to say</p>
<p>what kind of ecosystem could exist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the examples are so relevant</p>
<p>of the things you&rsquo;ve outlined in your life.</p>
<p>I hope those things, the books people write,</p>
<p>the experiences people build, the conversations you have,</p>
<p>your relationship with your AI systems,</p>
<p>I hope those all are feeding on the insights</p>
<p>built upon this ecosystem we&rsquo;ve created to better your life.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the thinking behind it.</p>
<p>Again, with the Drake equation</p>
<p>being the underlying driver of value.</p>
<p>And the people at Kernel have joined</p>
<p>not because we have certainty of success,</p>
<p>but because we find it to be the most exhilarating</p>
<p>opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive.</p>
<p>You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007</p>
<p>that acquired Venmo in 2012,</p>
<p>in that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story of the vision</p>
<p>and the challenge of building an online payment system</p>
<p>and just building a large successful business in general?</p>
<p>I discovered payments by accident.</p>
<p>When I was 21, I just returned from Ecuador</p>
<p>living among extreme poverty for two years.</p>
<p>And I came back to the US and I was shocked by the opulence</p>
<p>of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Yeah, of the United States.</p>
<p>And I just thought this is, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And I decided I wanted to try to spend my life helping others.</p>
<p>Like that was the, that was a life objective</p>
<p>that I thought was worthwhile to pursue</p>
<p>versus making money and whatever the case may be</p>
<p>for its own right.</p>
<p>And so I decided in that moment that I was going to</p>
<p>try to make enough money by the age of 30</p>
<p>to never have to work again.</p>
<p>And then with some abundance of money,</p>
<p>I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial</p>
<p>to others, but may not meet the criteria</p>
<p>of being a standalone business.</p>
<p>And so in that process, I started a few companies,</p>
<p>had some small successes, had some failures.</p>
<p>In one of the endeavors, I was up to my eyeballs in debt.</p>
<p>Things were not going well.</p>
<p>And I needed a part time job to pay my bills.</p>
<p>And so I, one day I saw in the paper in Utah</p>
<p>where I was living the 50 richest people in Utah.</p>
<p>And I emailed each one of their assistants and said,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m young, I&rsquo;m resourceful, I&rsquo;ll do anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just want to, I&rsquo;m entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>I tried to get a job that would be flexible</p>
<p>and no one responded.</p>
<p>And then I interviewed at a few dozen places.</p>
<p>Nobody would even give me the time of day.</p>
<p>Like it wouldn&rsquo;t want to take me seriously.</p>
<p>And so finally I, it was on monster.com</p>
<p>that I saw this job posting for credit card sales</p>
<p>door to door.</p>
<p>Commission.</p>
<p>I did not know the story, this is great.</p>
<p>I love the head drop, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So it was.</p>
<p>The low points to which we go in life.</p>
<p>So I responded and you know, the person made an attempt</p>
<p>at suggesting that they had some kind of standards</p>
<p>that they would consider hiring.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of like, if you could fog a mirror,</p>
<p>like come and do this because it&rsquo;s 100% commission.</p>
<p>And so I started walking up and down the street</p>
<p>in my community selling credit card processing.</p>
<p>And so what you learn immediately in doing that is</p>
<p>if you walk into a business, first of all,</p>
<p>the business owner is typically there.</p>
<p>And you walk in the door and they can tell</p>
<p>by how you&rsquo;re dressed or how you walk,</p>
<p>whatever their pattern recognition is.</p>
<p>And they just hate you immediately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, stop wasting my time.</p>
<p>I really am trying to get stuff done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want us to a sales pitch.</p>
<p>And so you have to overcome the initial get out.</p>
<p>And then once you engage, when you say the word</p>
<p>credit card processing, the person&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I already hate you because I have been taken advantage</p>
<p>of dozens of times because you all are weasels.</p>
<p>And so I had to figure out an algorithm</p>
<p>to get past all those different conditions.</p>
<p>Cause I was still working on my other startup</p>
<p>for the majority of my time.</p>
<p>So I was doing this part time.</p>
<p>And so I figured out that the industry really was built</p>
<p>on people, on deceit, basically people promising things</p>
<p>that were not reality.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not reality and so I&rsquo;d walk into a business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, look, I would give you a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put a hundred dollar bill and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred dollars</p>
<p>for three minutes of your time.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t say yes to what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>And then he usually crack a smile and say, okay,</p>
<p>like what do you got for me son?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d sit down, I just opened my book and I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the credit card industry.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Here are the players.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how they deceive you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no different than anyone else.</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re gonna process your credit card.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get the money in the account.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna get a clean statement, you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>someone who answers the call when someone asks and you know,</p>
<p>just like the basic, like you&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>And people started saying yes.</p>
<p>And then of course I went to the next business and be like,</p>
<p>you know, Joe and Susie and whoever said yes too.</p>
<p>And so I built a social proof structure</p>
<p>and I became the number one salesperson</p>
<p>out of 400 people nationwide doing this.</p>
<p>And I worked, you know, half time</p>
<p>still doing this other startup and.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant strategy, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very well, very well strategized and executed.</p>
<p>I did it for nine months.</p>
<p>And at the time my customer base was making,</p>
<p>was generating around, I think it was six,</p>
<p>if I remember correctly, $62,504 a month</p>
<p>were the overall revenues.</p>
<p>I thought, wow, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>If I built that as my own company,</p>
<p>I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively</p>
<p>with these merchants processing credit cards.</p>
<p>So I thought, hmm.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s when I thought I&rsquo;m gonna create a company.</p>
<p>And so then I started Braintree.</p>
<p>And the idea was the online world was broken</p>
<p>because PayPal had been acquired by eBay</p>
<p>around, I think, 1999 or 2000.</p>
<p>And eBay had not innovated much with PayPal.</p>
<p>So it basically sat still for seven years</p>
<p>as the software world moved along.</p>
<p>And then authorize.net was also a company</p>
<p>that was relatively stagnant.</p>
<p>So you basically had software engineers</p>
<p>who wanted modern payment tools,</p>
<p>but there were none available for them.</p>
<p>And so they just dealt with software they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And so with Braintree,</p>
<p>I thought the entry point is to build software</p>
<p>that engineers will love.</p>
<p>And if we can find the entry point via software</p>
<p>and make it easy and beautiful</p>
<p>and just a magical experience</p>
<p>and then provide customer service on top of that,</p>
<p>that would be easy, that would be great.</p>
<p>What I was really going after though, it was PayPal.</p>
<p>They were the only company in payments making money.</p>
<p>Because they had the relationship with eBay early on,</p>
<p>people created a PayPal account,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d fund their account with their checking account</p>
<p>versus their credit cards.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;d use PayPal to pay a merchant,</p>
<p>PayPal had a cost of payment of zero</p>
<p>versus if you have coming from a credit card,</p>
<p>you have to pay the bank the fees.</p>
<p>So PayPal&rsquo;s margins were 3% on a transaction</p>
<p>versus a typical payments company,</p>
<p>which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And so I knew PayPal really was the model to replicate,</p>
<p>but a bunch of companies had tried to do that.</p>
<p>They tried to come in and build a two sided marketplace.</p>
<p>So get consumers to fund the checking account</p>
<p>and the merchants to accept it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;d all failed because building</p>
<p>a two sided marketplace is very hard at the same time.</p>
<p>So my plan was I&rsquo;m going to build a company</p>
<p>and get the best merchants in the whole world</p>
<p>to use our service.</p>
<p>Then in year five, I&rsquo;m going to have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to acquire a consumer payments company</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to bring the two together.</p>
<p>And to focus on the merchant side and then get</p>
<p>the payments company that does the customer,</p>
<p>the whatever, the other side of it.</p>
<p>This is the plan I presented when I was</p>
<p>at University of Chicago.</p>
<p>And weirdly it happened exactly like that.</p>
<p>So four years in our customer base included Uber,</p>
<p>Airbnb, GitHub, 37 Signals, not Basecamp.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic collection of companies</p>
<p>that represented the fastest growing,</p>
<p>some of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.</p>
<p>And then we met up with Venmo and they had done</p>
<p>a remarkable job in building product.</p>
<p>It does up then something very counterintuitive,</p>
<p>which is make public your private financial transactions</p>
<p>which people previously thought were something</p>
<p>that should be hidden from others.</p>
<p>And we acquired Venmo and at that point we now had,</p>
<p>we replicated the model because now people could fund</p>
<p>their Venmo account with their checking account,</p>
<p>keep money in the account.</p>
<p>And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment.</p>
<p>And so I think PayPal saw that,</p>
<p>that we were getting the best merchants in the world.</p>
<p>We had people using Venmo.</p>
<p>They were both the up and coming millennials at the time</p>
<p>who had so much influence online.</p>
<p>And so they came in and offered us an attractive number.</p>
<p>And my goal was not to build</p>
<p>the biggest payments company in the world.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list.</p>
<p>It was, the objective was I want to earn enough money</p>
<p>so that I can basically dedicate my attention</p>
<p>to doing something that could potentially be useful</p>
<p>on a society wide scale.</p>
<p>And more importantly, that could be considered to be valuable</p>
<p>from the vantage point of 2050, 2100 and 2500.</p>
<p>So thinking about it on a few hundred year timescale.</p>
<p>And there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t require the permission of anybody to do that.</p>
<p>And so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me</p>
<p>to get that amount of money to basically have a go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I set off to survey everything</p>
<p>I could identify an existence to say</p>
<p>of anything in the entire world I could do.</p>
<p>What one thing could I do</p>
<p>that would actually have the highest value potential</p>
<p>for the species?</p>
<p>And so it took me a little while to arrive at Brainerd Faces,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>Payments in themselves are revolutionary technologies</p>
<p>that can change the world.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s not forget that too easily.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you know this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s quite a few lovely folks</p>
<p>who are now fascinated with the space of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>And payments are very much connected to this,</p>
<p>but in general, just money.</p>
<p>And many of the folks I&rsquo;ve spoken with,</p>
<p>they also kind of connect that</p>
<p>to not just purely financial discussions,</p>
<p>but philosophical and political discussions.</p>
<p>And they see Bitcoin as a way, almost as activism,</p>
<p>almost as a way to resist the corruption</p>
<p>of centralized centers of power.</p>
<p>And sort of basically in the 21st century,</p>
<p>decentralizing control.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>they see that&rsquo;s one possible way to give power</p>
<p>to those that live in regimes that are corrupt</p>
<p>or are not respectful of human rights</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense, just all your expertise with payments</p>
<p>and seeing how that changed the world,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense about the lay of the land</p>
<p>for the future of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>in the positive impact it may have on the world?</p>
<p>To be clear, my communication wasn&rsquo;t meant</p>
<p>to minimize payments or to denigrate it in any way.</p>
<p>It was an attempt at communication</p>
<p>that when I was surveying the world,</p>
<p>it was an algorithm of what could I individually do?</p>
<p>So there are things that exist</p>
<p>that have a lot of potential that can be done.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a filtering of how many people</p>
<p>are qualified to do this given thing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a further characterization</p>
<p>that can be done of, okay, given the number</p>
<p>of qualified people, will somebody be a unique out performer</p>
<p>of that group to make something truly impossible</p>
<p>to be something done that otherwise couldn&rsquo;t get done?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a process of assessing</p>
<p>where can you add unique value in the world?</p>
<p>And some of that has to do with you being very formal</p>
<p>and calculative here, but some of that is just like,</p>
<p>what do you sense, like part of that equation</p>
<p>is how much passion you sense within yourself</p>
<p>to be able to drive that through,</p>
<p>to discover the impossibilities and make them possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, and so we were at Braintree,</p>
<p>I think we were the first company to integrate Coinbase</p>
<p>into our, I think we were the first payments company</p>
<p>to formally incorporate crypto, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p>
<p>For people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>Coinbase is a place where you can trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Yeah, which was one of the only places you could.</p>
<p>So we were early in doing that.</p>
<p>And of course, this was in the year 2013.</p>
<p>So an attorney to go in cryptocurrency land.</p>
<p>I concur with the statement you made</p>
<p>of the potential of the principles</p>
<p>underlying cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>And that many of the things that they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>in the name of money and of moving value</p>
<p>is equally applicable to the brain</p>
<p>and equally applicable to how the brain interacts</p>
<p>with the rest of the world</p>
<p>and how we would imagine doing goal alignment with people.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s a continuous spectrum of possibility.</p>
<p>And your question is isolated on the money.</p>
<p>And I think it just is basically a scaffolding layer</p>
<p>for all of society.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t see this money as particularly distinct</p>
<p>from other? I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think we at Kernel, we will benefit greatly</p>
<p>from the progress being made in cryptocurrency</p>
<p>because it will be a similar technology stack</p>
<p>we will want to use for many things we want to accomplish.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m bullish on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and think it could greatly enhance brain interfaces</p>
<p>and the value of the brain interface ecosystem.</p>
<p>I mean, is there something you could say about,</p>
<p>first of all, bullish on cryptocurrency versus fiat money?</p>
<p>So do you have a sense that in 21st century</p>
<p>cryptocurrency will be embraced by governments</p>
<p>and changed the face of governments,</p>
<p>the structure of governments?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way I think about my diet,</p>
<p>where previously it was conscious Brian,</p>
<p>looking at foods in certain biochemical states.</p>
<p>Am I hungry? Am I irritated? Am I depressed?</p>
<p>And then I choose based upon those momentary windows.</p>
<p>Do I eat at night when I&rsquo;m fatigued</p>
<p>and I have low willpower?</p>
<p>Am I going to pig out on something?</p>
<p>And the current monetary system is based</p>
<p>upon human conscious decision making.</p>
<p>And politics and power and this whole mess of things.</p>
<p>And what I like about the building blocks</p>
<p>of cryptocurrencies, it&rsquo;s methodical, it&rsquo;s structured,</p>
<p>it is accountable, it&rsquo;s transparent.</p>
<p>And so it introduces this scaffolding,</p>
<p>which I think, again, is the right starting point</p>
<p>for how we think about building</p>
<p>next generation institutions for society.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s much broader than money.</p>
<p>So I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is Bitcoin is the demotion</p>
<p>of the conscious mind as well.</p>
<p>In the same way you were talking about diet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like giving less priority to the ups and downs</p>
<p>of any one particular human mind, in this case your own,</p>
<p>and giving more power to the sort of data driven.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, I think that is accurate,</p>
<p>that cryptocurrency is a version of what I would call</p>
<p>my autonomous self that I&rsquo;m trying to build.</p>
<p>It is an introduction of an autonomous system</p>
<p>of value exchange and the process of value creation</p>
<p>in the society, yes, I see their similarities.</p>
<p>So I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is Bitcoin</p>
<p>will somehow help me not pig out at night,</p>
<p>or the equivalent of, speaking of diet,</p>
<p>if we could just linger on that topic a little bit,</p>
<p>we already talked about your blog post of I fired myself,</p>
<p>I fired Brian, the evening Brian,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s too willing to, not making good decisions</p>
<p>for the long term well being and happiness</p>
<p>of the entirety of the organism.</p>
<p>Basically you were like pigging out at night.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting, because I do the same,</p>
<p>in fact I often eat one meal a day,</p>
<p>and like I have been this week actually,</p>
<p>especially when I travel, and it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>that it never occurred to me to just basically look</p>
<p>at the fact that I&rsquo;m able to be much smarter</p>
<p>about my eating decisions in the morning</p>
<p>and the afternoon than I am at night.</p>
<p>So if I eat one meal a day, why not eat</p>
<p>that one meal a day in the morning?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not, it never occurred to me,</p>
<p>this revolutionary act, until you&rsquo;ve outlined that.</p>
<p>So maybe, can you give some details,</p>
<p>and this is just you, this is one person,</p>
<p>Brian, arrives at a particular thing that they do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fascinating to kind of look</p>
<p>at this one particular case study,</p>
<p>so what works for you, diet wise?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your actual diet, what do you eat,</p>
<p>how often do you eat?</p>
<p>My current protocol is basically the result</p>
<p>of thousands of experiments and decision making.</p>
<p>So I do this every 90 days, I do the tests,</p>
<p>I do the cycle throughs, then I measure again,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m measuring all the time.</p>
<p>And so what I, of course I&rsquo;m optimizing</p>
<p>for my biomarkers, I want perfect cholesterol</p>
<p>and I want perfect blood glucose levels</p>
<p>and perfect DNA methylation processes.</p>
<p>I also want perfect sleep.</p>
<p>And so for example, recently, the past two weeks,</p>
<p>my resting heart rate has been at 42 when I sleep.</p>
<p>And when my resting heart rate&rsquo;s at 42,</p>
<p>my HRV is at its highest.</p>
<p>And I wake up in the morning feeling more energized</p>
<p>than any other configuration.</p>
<p>And so I know from all these processes</p>
<p>that eating at roughly 8.30 in the morning,</p>
<p>right after I work out on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>creates enough distance between that completed eating</p>
<p>and bedtime where I have almost no digestion processes</p>
<p>going on in my body,</p>
<p>therefore my resting heart rate goes very low.</p>
<p>And when my resting heart rate&rsquo;s very low,</p>
<p>I sleep with high quality.</p>
<p>And so basically I&rsquo;ve been trying to optimize</p>
<p>the entirety of what I eat to my sleep quality.</p>
<p>And my sleep quality then of course feeds into my willpower</p>
<p>so it creates this virtuous cycle.</p>
<p>And so at 8.30 what I do is I eat what I call super veggie,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s a pudding of 250 grams of broccoli,</p>
<p>150 grams of cauliflower,</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of other vegetables</p>
<p>that I eat what I call nutty pudding, which is.</p>
<p>You make the pudding yourself?</p>
<p>Like, what do you call it?</p>
<p>Like a veggie mix, whatever thing, like a blender?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can be made in a high speed blender.</p>
<p>But basically I eat the same thing every day,</p>
<p>veggie bowl as in the form of pudding,</p>
<p>and then a bowl in the form of nuts.</p>
<p>And then I have.</p>
<p>Vegan.</p>
<p>Vegan, yes.</p>
<p>Vegan, so that&rsquo;s fat and that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fat and carbs and that&rsquo;s the protein and so on.</p>
<p>Then I have a third dish.</p>
<p>Does it taste good?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it so much I dream about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>This is a.</p>
<p>And then I have a third dish which is,</p>
<p>it changes every day.</p>
<p>Today it was kale and spinach and sweet potato.</p>
<p>And then I take about 20 supplements</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>hopefully make, constitute a perfect nutritional profile.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to do is create the perfect diet</p>
<p>for my body every single day.</p>
<p>Where sleep is part of the optimization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, one of the things you&rsquo;re really tracking.</p>
<p>I mean, can you, well, I have a million question,</p>
<p>but 20 supplements, like what kind are like,</p>
<p>would you say are essential?</p>
<p>Cause I only take, I only take athletic greens.com slash.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the multivitamin essentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the lazy man, you know, like,</p>
<p>like if you don&rsquo;t actually want to think about shit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you take and then fish oil and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I take.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, Alfred North Whitehead said,</p>
<p>civilization advances as it extends the number</p>
<p>of important operations it can do</p>
<p>without thinking about them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So my objective on this is I want an algorithm</p>
<p>for perfect health that I never have to think about.</p>
<p>And then I want that system to be scalable to anybody</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t have to think about it.</p>
<p>And right now it&rsquo;s expensive for me to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time consuming for me to do it.</p>
<p>And I have infrastructure to do it,</p>
<p>but the future of being human is not going</p>
<p>to the grocery store and deciding what to eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not reading scientific papers,</p>
<p>trying to decide this thing or that thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all N of one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s devices on the outside and inside your body,</p>
<p>assessing real time what your body needs</p>
<p>and then creating closed loop systems for that to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so right now you&rsquo;re doing the data collection</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being the scientist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be much better if you just did the data collect</p>
<p>or it was being essentially done for you</p>
<p>and you can outsource that to another scientist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing the N of one study of you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, because every time I spend time thinking</p>
<p>about this or executing, spending time on it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending less time thinking about building kernel</p>
<p>or the future of being human.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, we just all have the budget</p>
<p>of our capacity on an everyday basis</p>
<p>and we will scaffold our way up out of this.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, hopefully what I&rsquo;m doing is really,</p>
<p>it serves as a model that others can also build on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wrote about it,</p>
<p>is hopefully people can then take it and improve upon it.</p>
<p>I hold nothing sacred.</p>
<p>I change my diet almost every day</p>
<p>based upon some new test results or science</p>
<p>or something like that, but.</p>
<p>Can you maybe elaborate on the sleep thing?</p>
<p>Why is sleep so important?</p>
<p>And why, presumably, like what does good sleep mean to you?</p>
<p>I think sleep is a contender for being the most powerful</p>
<p>health intervention in existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contender.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s magical what it does if you&rsquo;re well rested</p>
<p>and what your body can do.</p>
<p>And I mean, for example, I know when I eat close</p>
<p>to my bedtime and I&rsquo;ve done a systematic study for years</p>
<p>looking at like 15 minute increments on time of day</p>
<p>on where I eat my last meal,</p>
<p>my willpower is directly correlated</p>
<p>to the amount of deep sleep I get.</p>
<p>So my ability to not binge eat at night</p>
<p>when rascal Brian&rsquo;s out and about</p>
<p>is based upon how much deep sleep I got the night before.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot to that, yeah.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve seen it manifest itself.</p>
<p>And so I think the way I summarize this is</p>
<p>in society we&rsquo;ve had this myth of,</p>
<p>we tell stories, for example, of entrepreneurship</p>
<p>where this person was so amazing,</p>
<p>they stayed at the office for three days</p>
<p>and slept under their desk.</p>
<p>And we say, wow, that&rsquo;s amazing, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And now I think we&rsquo;re headed towards a state</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s primitive</p>
<p>and really not a good idea on every level.</p>
<p>And so the new mythology is going to be the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Yeah, by the way, just to sort of maybe push back</p>
<p>a little bit on that idea.</p>
<p>Did you sleep under your desk collects?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in that actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in chaos</p>
<p>and giving into your passion</p>
<p>and sometimes doing things that are out of the ordinary</p>
<p>that are not trying to optimize health</p>
<p>for certain periods of time in lieu of your passions</p>
<p>is a signal to yourself that you&rsquo;re throwing everything away.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is how to have good performance for prolonged periods</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s moments in life</p>
<p>where you need to throw all of that away,</p>
<p>all the plans away, all the structure away.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure I have an eloquent way</p>
<p>describing exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>but it all depends on people, people are different,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a danger of over optimization</p>
<p>to where you don&rsquo;t just give into the madness</p>
<p>of the way your brain flows.</p>
<p>I mean, to push back on my pushback is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to have like where the foundations</p>
<p>of your brain are not messed with.</p>
<p>So you have a fixed foundation where the diet is fixed,</p>
<p>where the sleep is fixed and that all of that is optimal</p>
<p>and the chaos happens in the space of ideas</p>
<p>as opposed to the space of biology.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>that requires real discipline and forming habits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect to which some of the best days</p>
<p>and weeks of my life have been, yeah,</p>
<p>sleeping under a desk kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not too willing to let go</p>
<p>of things that empirically worked</p>
<p>for things that work in theory.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m, again, I&rsquo;m absolutely with you on sleep.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m with you on sleep conceptually,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also very humbled to understand</p>
<p>that for different people,</p>
<p>good sleep means different things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very hesitant to trust science on sleep.</p>
<p>I think you should also be a scholar of your own body.</p>
<p>Again, the experiment of NF1.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that a full night&rsquo;s sleep is great for me.</p>
<p>There is something about that power nap</p>
<p>that I just have not fully studied yet,</p>
<p>but that nap is something special.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m not sure I found the optimal thing.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s a lot to be explored</p>
<p>to what is exactly optimal amount of sleep,</p>
<p>optimal kind of sleep combined with diet</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, that all maps the sort of data,</p>
<p>at least the truth, exactly what you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a data point for your consideration.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The progress in biology over the past, say decade,</p>
<p>has been stunning.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it now appears as if we will be able to replace</p>
<p>our organs, zero X for a transplantation.</p>
<p>And so we probably have a path to replace</p>
<p>and regenerate every organ of your body,</p>
<p>except for your brain.</p>
<p>You can lose your hand and your arm and a leg.</p>
<p>You can have an artificial heart.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t operate without your brain.</p>
<p>And so when you make that trade off decision</p>
<p>of whether you&rsquo;re going to sleep under the desk or not</p>
<p>and go all out for a four day marathon, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cost benefit trade off of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening to your brain in that situation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the consequences</p>
<p>of modern day life on our brain.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the most valuable organ in our existence.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on if we,</p>
<p>in how we&rsquo;re treating it today with stress</p>
<p>and with sleep and with dietary.</p>
<p>And to me, then if you say that you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to optimize life</p>
<p>for whatever things you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>The game is soon with the progress in anti aging and biology,</p>
<p>the game is very soon going to become different</p>
<p>than what it is right now with organ rejuvenation,</p>
<p>organ replacement.</p>
<p>And I would conjecture that we will value</p>
<p>the health status of our brain above all things.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;re saying is true, but we die.</p>
<p>We die pretty quickly, life is short.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m one of those people that I would rather die in battle</p>
<p>than stay safe at home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you look at kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things that you can reasonably say,</p>
<p>these are, this is the smart thing to do</p>
<p>that can prevent you, that becomes conservative,</p>
<p>that can prevent you from fully embracing life.</p>
<p>I think ultimately you can be very intelligent</p>
<p>and data driven and also embrace life.</p>
<p>But I err on the side of embracing life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it takes a very skillful person</p>
<p>to not sort of that hovering parent that says,</p>
<p>you know what, there&rsquo;s a 3% chance that if you go out,</p>
<p>if you go out by yourself and play, you&rsquo;re going to die,</p>
<p>get run over by a car, come to a slow or a sudden end.</p>
<p>And I am more a supporter of just go out there.</p>
<p>If you die, you die.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a balance you have to strike.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a balance to strike</p>
<p>in the longterm optimization and short term freedom.</p>
<p>For me, for a programmer, for a programming mind,</p>
<p>I tend to over optimize and I&rsquo;m very cautious</p>
<p>and afraid of that, to not over optimize</p>
<p>and thereby be overly cautious, suboptimally cautious</p>
<p>about everything I do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the ultimate thing I&rsquo;m trying to optimize for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you said like sleep and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I tend to think, this is, you&rsquo;re being more precise</p>
<p>than I am, but I think I tend to want to minimize stress,</p>
<p>which everything comes into that from your sleep</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I worry that whenever I&rsquo;m trying to be too strict</p>
<p>with myself, then the stress goes up</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t follow the strictness.</p>
<p>And so you have to kind of, it&rsquo;s a weird,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s so many variables in an objective function</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s hard to get right.</p>
<p>And sort of not giving a damn about sleep</p>
<p>and not giving a damn about diet is a good thing</p>
<p>to inject in there every once in a while</p>
<p>for somebody who&rsquo;s trying to optimize everything.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s me just trying to, it&rsquo;s exactly like you said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a scientist, I&rsquo;m a scientist of myself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a scientist of yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice if somebody else was doing it</p>
<p>and had much better data, because I don&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>my conscious mind and I pigged out last night</p>
<p>at some brisket in LA that I regret deeply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so, uh.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point to anything I just said.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>What is the nature of your regret on the brisket?</p>
<p>Is it, do you wish you hadn&rsquo;t eaten it entirely?</p>
<p>Is it that you wish you hadn&rsquo;t eaten as much as you did?</p>
<p>Is it that?</p>
<p>I think, well, the most regret, I mean,</p>
<p>if we want to be specific, I drank way too much like that.</p>
<p>Like diet soda.</p>
<p>My biggest regret is like having drank so much diet soda.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that really was the problem.</p>
<p>I had trouble sleeping because of that.</p>
<p>Because I was like programming and then I was editing.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d stay up late at night</p>
<p>and then I had to get up to go pee a few times</p>
<p>and it was just a mess.</p>
<p>A mess of a night.</p>
<p>It was, well, it&rsquo;s not really a mess,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s so many, it&rsquo;s like the little things.</p>
<p>I know if I just eat, I drink a little bit of water</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it, and there&rsquo;s a certain,</p>
<p>all of us have perfect days that we know diet wise</p>
<p>and so on that&rsquo;s good to follow, you feel good.</p>
<p>I know what it takes for me to do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fully do that and thereby,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an avalanche effect</p>
<p>where the other sources of stress,</p>
<p>all the other to do items I have piled on,</p>
<p>my failure to execute on some basic things</p>
<p>that I know make me feel good and all of that combines</p>
<p>to create a mess of a day.</p>
<p>But some of that chaos, you have to be okay with it,</p>
<p>but some of it I wish was a little bit more optimal.</p>
<p>And your ideas about eating in the morning</p>
<p>are quite interesting as an experiment to try.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate, are you eating once a day?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In the morning and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Can you maybe speak to how that,</p>
<p>you spoke, it&rsquo;s funny, you spoke about the metrics of sleep,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also, you run a business,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re incredibly intelligent,</p>
<p>mostly your happiness and success</p>
<p>relies on you thinking clearly.</p>
<p>So how does that affect your mind and your body</p>
<p>in terms of performance?</p>
<p>So not just sleep, but actual mental performance.</p>
<p>As you were explaining your objective function of,</p>
<p>for example, in the criteria you were including,</p>
<p>you like certain neurochemical states,</p>
<p>like you like feeling like you&rsquo;re living life,</p>
<p>that life has enjoyment,</p>
<p>that sometimes you want to disregard certain rules</p>
<p>to have a moment of passion, of focus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this architecture of the way Lex is,</p>
<p>which makes you happy as a story you tell,</p>
<p>as something you kind of experience,</p>
<p>maybe the experience is a bit more complicated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in this idea you have, this is a version of you.</p>
<p>And the reason why I maintain the schedule I do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve chosen a game to say,</p>
<p>I would like to live a life</p>
<p>where I care more about what intelligent,</p>
<p>what people who live in the year 2500</p>
<p>think of me than I do today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game I&rsquo;m trying to play.</p>
<p>And so therefore the only thing I really care about</p>
<p>on this optimization is trying to see past myself,</p>
<p>past my limitations, using zeroes principle thinking,</p>
<p>pull myself out of this contextual mesh we&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>and say, what will matter 100 years from now</p>
<p>and 200 years from now?</p>
<p>What are the big things really going on</p>
<p>that are defining reality?</p>
<p>And I find that if I were to hang out with Diet Soda Lex</p>
<p>and Diet Soda Brian were to play along with that</p>
<p>and my deep sleep were to get crushed as a result,</p>
<p>my mind would not be on what matters</p>
<p>in 100 years or 200 years or 300 years.</p>
<p>I would be irritable.</p>
<p>I would be, I&rsquo;d be in a different state.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just gameplay selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you and I have chosen to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve chosen to work on.</p>
<p>And this is why I&rsquo;m saying that no generation of humans</p>
<p>have ever been afforded the opportunity</p>
<p>to look at their lifespan and contemplate</p>
<p>that they will have the possibility of experiencing</p>
<p>an evolved form of consciousness that is undeniable.</p>
<p>They would fall in a zero category of potential.</p>
<p>That to me is the most exciting thing in existence.</p>
<p>And I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state</p>
<p>right now in exchange for that.</p>
<p>I would, I&rsquo;d be willing to deprive myself</p>
<p>of all momentary joy in pursuit of that goal</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what makes me happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a bit, I just looked it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with, I just looked up Braveheart&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>and William Wallace, but I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Fight and you may die, run and you&rsquo;ll live at least a while.</p>
<p>And dying in your beds many years from now,</p>
<p>would you be willing to trade all the days</p>
<p>from this day to that for one chance,</p>
<p>just one chance, picture Mel Gibson saying this,</p>
<p>to come back here and tell our enemies</p>
<p>that they may take our lives with growing excitement,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll never take our freedom.</p>
<p>I get excited every time I see that in the movie,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of how I approach life and eating.</p>
<p>Do you think they were tracking their sleep?</p>
<p>They were not tracking their sleep</p>
<p>and they ate way too much brisket</p>
<p>and they were fat, unhealthy, died early,</p>
<p>and were primitive.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something in my ape brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s attracted to that, even though most of my life</p>
<p>is fully aligned with the way you see yours.</p>
<p>Part of it is for comedy, of course,</p>
<p>but part of it is I&rsquo;m almost afraid of overoptimization.</p>
<p>Really what you&rsquo;re saying though,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say from a first principles perspective,</p>
<p>when you read those words,</p>
<p>they conjure up certain life experiences,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically saying,</p>
<p>I experienced a certain neurotransmitter state</p>
<p>when these things are in action.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s that or something else,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just saying you have a selection</p>
<p>for how your state for your body.</p>
<p>And so if you as an engineer of consciousness,</p>
<p>that should just be engineerable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just triggering certain chemical reactions.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>You can have that and experience that</p>
<p>and also not sacrifice longterm health.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the potential of where we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t have to assume they are trade offs</p>
<p>that must be had.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so I guess for my particular brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to have the outlier experiences</p>
<p>that also come along with the illusion of free will</p>
<p>where I chose those experiences</p>
<p>that make me feel like it&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>Listen, going to Texas made me realize I spent,</p>
<p>so I still am, but I lived at Cambridge at MIT</p>
<p>and I never felt like home there.</p>
<p>I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues,</p>
<p>like when I was actually discussing ideas,</p>
<p>but there is something about the constraints,</p>
<p>how cautious people are,</p>
<p>how much they valued also kind of a material success,</p>
<p>career success.</p>
<p>When I showed up to Texas, it felt like I belong.</p>
<p>That was very interesting, but that&rsquo;s my neurochemistry,</p>
<p>whatever the hell that is, whatever,</p>
<p>maybe probably is rooted to the fact</p>
<p>that I grew up in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and it was such a constrained system</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d really deeply value freedom</p>
<p>and you always want to escape the man</p>
<p>and the control of centralized systems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but at the same time,</p>
<p>I love strictness.</p>
<p>I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet,</p>
<p>of like the same habit, exactly the habit you have.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually when bodies perform optimally,</p>
<p>my body performs optimally.</p>
<p>So balancing those two, I think if I have the data,</p>
<p>every once in a while, party with some wild people,</p>
<p>but most of the time eat once a day,</p>
<p>perhaps in the morning, I&rsquo;m gonna try that.</p>
<p>That might be very interesting,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d rather not try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have the data that tells me to do it.</p>
<p>But in general, you&rsquo;re able to, eating once a day,</p>
<p>think deeply about stuff like this.</p>
<p>Concern that people have is like does your energy wane,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Do you find that it&rsquo;s, especially because it&rsquo;s unique,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vegan as well.</p>
<p>So you find that you&rsquo;re able to have a clear mind,</p>
<p>a focus, and just physically and mentally throughout?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I find like my personal experience</p>
<p>in thinking about hard things is,</p>
<p>like oftentimes I feel like I&rsquo;m looking through a telescope</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;m aligning two or three telescopes.</p>
<p>And you kind of have to close one eye</p>
<p>and move it back and forth a little bit</p>
<p>and just find just the right alignment.</p>
<p>Then you find just a sneak peek</p>
<p>at the thing you&rsquo;re trying to find, but it&rsquo;s fleeting.</p>
<p>If you move just one little bit, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And oftentimes what I feel like are the ideas</p>
<p>I value the most are like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so fragile and fleeting and slippery and elusive.</p>
<p>And it requires a sensitivity to thinking</p>
<p>and a sensitivity to maneuver through these things.</p>
<p>If I concede to a world where I&rsquo;m on my phone texting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also on social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also doing 15 things at the same time</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m running a company</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also feeling terrible from the last night.</p>
<p>It all just comes crashing down.</p>
<p>And the quality of my thoughts goes to a zero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a functional person to respond to basic level things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel like I am doing anything interesting.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good word, sensitivity,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the word that&rsquo;s used the most.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what thinking deeply feels like</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re sensitive to the fragile thoughts.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>All those other distractions kind of dull</p>
<p>your ability to be sensitive to the fragile thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good word.</p>
<p>Out of all the things you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>Is this true?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Why and how, and what do you take from that experience?</p>
<p>I guess the backstory is relevant</p>
<p>because in that moment, it was the darkest time in my life.</p>
<p>I was ending a 13 year marriage.</p>
<p>I was leaving my religion.</p>
<p>I sold Braintree and I was battling depression</p>
<p>where I was just at the end.</p>
<p>And I got invited to go to Tanzania</p>
<p>as part of a group that was raising money</p>
<p>to build clean water wells.</p>
<p>And I had made some money from Braintree,</p>
<p>and so I was able to donate $25,000.</p>
<p>And it was the first time I had ever had money to donate</p>
<p>outside of paying tithing in my religion.</p>
<p>It was such a phenomenal experience</p>
<p>to contribute something meaningful to someone else</p>
<p>in that form.</p>
<p>And as part of this process,</p>
<p>we were gonna climb the mountain.</p>
<p>And so we went there and we saw the clean water wells</p>
<p>we were building.</p>
<p>We spoke to the people there and it was very energizing.</p>
<p>And then we climbed Kilimanjaro</p>
<p>and I came down with a stomach flu on day three.</p>
<p>And I also had altitude sickness,</p>
<p>but I became so sick that on day four,</p>
<p>we are somebody on day five,</p>
<p>I came into the camp, base camp at 15,000 feet,</p>
<p>just going to the bathroom on myself</p>
<p>and falling all over.</p>
<p>I was just a disaster, I was so sick.</p>
<p>So stomach flu and altitude sickness.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I just was destroyed from the situation.</p>
<p>Plus, it was psychologically one of the lowest points.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that was probably a big contributor.</p>
<p>I was just smoked as a human, just absolutely done.</p>
<p>And I had three young children.</p>
<p>And so I was trying to reconcile,</p>
<p>this is not a, whether I live or not</p>
<p>is not my decision by itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now intertwined with these three little people</p>
<p>and I have an obligation whether I like it or not,</p>
<p>I need to be there.</p>
<p>And so it did, it felt like I was just stuck</p>
<p>in a straight jacket.</p>
<p>And I had to decide whether I was going to summit</p>
<p>the next day with the team.</p>
<p>And it was a difficult decision</p>
<p>because once you start hiking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to get off the mountain.</p>
<p>And a midnight came and our guide came in</p>
<p>and he said, where are you at?</p>
<p>And I said, I think I&rsquo;m okay, I think I can try.</p>
<p>And so we went.</p>
<p>And so from midnight to, I made it to the summit at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>It was one of the most transformational moments</p>
<p>of my existence.</p>
<p>And the mountain became my problem.</p>
<p>It became everything that I was struggling with.</p>
<p>And when I started hiking, it was,</p>
<p>the pain got so ferocious that it was kind of like this.</p>
<p>It became so ferocious that I turned my music to Eminem</p>
<p>and it was, Eminem was the,</p>
<p>he was the only person in existence that spoke to my soul.</p>
<p>And it was something about his anger</p>
<p>and his vibrancy and his multi eventually,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the only person who I could turn on</p>
<p>and I could just say, I feel some relief.</p>
<p>I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit</p>
<p>after five hours, but just 100 yards from the top.</p>
<p>I was with my guide Ike and I started getting very dizzy</p>
<p>and I felt like I was gonna fall backwards</p>
<p>off this cliff area we were on.</p>
<p>I was like, this is dangerous.</p>
<p>And he said, look, Brian, I know where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>I know where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, you&rsquo;ve got it in you.</p>
<p>So I want you to look up, take a step, take a breath</p>
<p>and look up, take a breath and take a step.</p>
<p>And I did and I made it.</p>
<p>And so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top.</p>
<p>I just cried like a baby.</p>
<p>Broke down.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just lost it.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;d let me do my thing.</p>
<p>And then we pulled out the pulse oximeter</p>
<p>and he measured my blood oxygen levels</p>
<p>and it was like 50 something percent</p>
<p>and it was danger zone.</p>
<p>So he looked at it and I think he was like really alarmed</p>
<p>that I was in this situation.</p>
<p>And so he said, we can&rsquo;t get a helicopter here</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t get you emergency evacuated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta go down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta hike down to 15,000 feet to get base camp.</p>
<p>And so we went out on the mountain.</p>
<p>I got back down to base camp.</p>
<p>And again, that was pretty difficult.</p>
<p>And then they put me on a stretcher,</p>
<p>this metal stretcher with this one wheel</p>
<p>and a team of six people wheeled me down the mountain.</p>
<p>And it was pretty torturous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very appreciative they did.</p>
<p>Also the trail was very bumpy.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d go over the big rocks.</p>
<p>And so my head would just slam</p>
<p>against this metal thing for hours.</p>
<p>And so I just felt awful.</p>
<p>Plus I&rsquo;d get my head slammed every couple of seconds.</p>
<p>So the whole experience was really a life changing moment.</p>
<p>And that was the demarcation of me</p>
<p>basically building a new life.</p>
<p>Basically I said, I&rsquo;m going to reconstruct Brian,</p>
<p>my understanding of reality, my existential realities,</p>
<p>what I want to go after.</p>
<p>And I try, I mean, as much as that&rsquo;s possible as a human,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s when I set out to rebuild everything.</p>
<p>Was it the struggle of that?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also just like the romantic poetic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fricking mountain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a man in pain, psychological and physical</p>
<p>struggling up a mountain.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just struggle, just in the face of,</p>
<p>just pushing through in the face of hardship or nature too.</p>
<p>Something much bigger than you.</p>
<p>Is that, was that the thing that just clicked?</p>
<p>For me, it felt like I was just locked in with reality</p>
<p>and it was a death match.</p>
<p>It was in that moment, one of us is going to die.</p>
<p>So you were pondering death, like not surviving.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And it was, and that was the moment.</p>
<p>And it was, the summit to me was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to come out on top and I can do this.</p>
<p>And giving in was, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m just done.</p>
<p>And so it did, I locked in and that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>yeah, mountains are magical to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t design that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that was going to be the case.</p>
<p>I not, it would not have been something</p>
<p>I would have anticipated.</p>
<p>But you were not the same man afterwards.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people today</p>
<p>that look at your story,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s successful in many dimensions,</p>
<p>advice you can give to them about how to be successful</p>
<p>in their career, successful in life,</p>
<p>whatever path they choose?</p>
<p>Yes, I would say, listen to advice</p>
<p>and see it for what it is, a mirror of that person,</p>
<p>and then map and know that your future</p>
<p>is going to be in a zero principle land.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re hearing today is a representation</p>
<p>of what may have been the right principles</p>
<p>to build upon previously,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re likely depreciating very fast.</p>
<p>And so I am a strong proponent</p>
<p>that people ask for advice, but they don&rsquo;t take advice.</p>
<p>So how do you take advice properly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the careful examination of the advice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the person makes a statement</p>
<p>about a given thing somebody should follow.</p>
<p>The value is not doing that.</p>
<p>The value is understanding the assumption stack they built,</p>
<p>the assumption and knowledge stack they built</p>
<p>around that body of knowledge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not doing what they say.</p>
<p>Considering the advice, but digging deeper</p>
<p>to understand the assumption stack,</p>
<p>like the full person,</p>
<p>I mean, this is deep empathy, essentially,</p>
<p>to understand the journey of the person</p>
<p>that arrived at the advice.</p>
<p>And the advice is just the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>that ultimately is not the thing that gives you.</p>
<p>It could be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>It could be the complete wrong thing to do</p>
<p>depending on the assumption stack.</p>
<p>So you need to investigate the whole thing.</p>
<p>Is there some, are there been people in your startup</p>
<p>and your business journey that have served that role</p>
<p>of advice giver that&rsquo;s been helpful?</p>
<p>Or do you feel like your journey felt like a lonely path?</p>
<p>Or was it one that was, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all there born and die alone.</p>
<p>But do you fundamentally remember the experiences,</p>
<p>one where you leaned on people</p>
<p>at a particular moment in time that changed everything?</p>
<p>Yeah, the most significant moments of my memory,</p>
<p>for example, like on Kilimanjaro,</p>
<p>when Ike, some person I&rsquo;d never met in Tanzania,</p>
<p>was able to, in that moment, apparently see my soul</p>
<p>when I was in this death match with reality.</p>
<p>And he gave me the instructions, look up, step.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s magical people in my life</p>
<p>that have done things like that.</p>
<p>And I suspect they probably don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I probably should be better at identifying those things.</p>
<p>And, but yeah, hopefully the,</p>
<p>I suppose like the wisdom I would aspire to</p>
<p>is to have the awareness and the empathy</p>
<p>to be that for other people.</p>
<p>And not a retail advertiser of advice,</p>
<p>of tricks for life, but deeply meaningful</p>
<p>and empathetic with a one on one context</p>
<p>with people that it really can make a difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually kind of experience,</p>
<p>I think about that sometimes.</p>
<p>You have like an 18 year old kid come up to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always obvious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always easy to really listen to them.</p>
<p>Like not the facts, but like see who that person is.</p>
<p>I think people say that about being a parent</p>
<p>is you want to consider that,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be the authority figure</p>
<p>in the sense that you really want to consider</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a special unique human being there</p>
<p>with a unique brain that may be brilliant</p>
<p>in ways that you are not understanding</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll never be and really try to hear that.</p>
<p>So when giving advice, there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a both sides should be deeply empathetic</p>
<p>about the assumption stack.</p>
<p>I love that terminology.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life?</p>
<p>Why the hell are we here, Brian Johnson?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about brains and studying brains</p>
<p>and you had this very eloquent way of describing life</p>
<p>on Earth as an optimization problem</p>
<p>of the cost of intelligence going to zero.</p>
<p>At first through the evolutionary process</p>
<p>and then eventually through building,</p>
<p>through our technology,</p>
<p>building more and more intelligent systems.</p>
<p>You ever ask yourself why is doing that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the answer to this question,</p>
<p>again, the information value is more in the mirror</p>
<p>it provides of that person,</p>
<p>which is a representation of the technological,</p>
<p>social, political context of the time.</p>
<p>So if you ask this question a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>you would get a certain answer</p>
<p>that reflects that time period.</p>
<p>Same thing would be true of a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare, it&rsquo;s difficult for a person to pull themselves</p>
<p>out of their contextual awareness</p>
<p>and offer a truly original response.</p>
<p>And so knowing that I am contextually influenced</p>
<p>by the situation, that I am a mirror for our reality,</p>
<p>I would say that in this moment,</p>
<p>I think the real game going on</p>
<p>is that evolution built a system</p>
<p>of scaffolding intelligence that produced us.</p>
<p>We are now building intelligence systems</p>
<p>that are scaffolding higher dimensional intelligence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s developing more robust systems of intelligence.</p>
<p>In doing in that process with the cost going to zero,</p>
<p>then the meaning of life becomes goal alignment,</p>
<p>which is the negotiation of our conscious</p>
<p>and unconscious existence.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say the third thing is,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re thinking that we wanna be explorers</p>
<p>is our technological progress is getting to a point</p>
<p>where we could aspirationally say,</p>
<p>we want to figure out what is really going on,</p>
<p>really going on, because does any of this really make sense?</p>
<p>Now we may be a hundred, 200, 500, a thousand years away</p>
<p>from being able to poke our way out of whatever is going on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting that we could even state an aspiration</p>
<p>to say, we wanna poke at this question.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say in this moment of time,</p>
<p>the meaning of life is that we can build a future state</p>
<p>of existence that is more fantastic</p>
<p>than anything we could ever imagine.</p>
<p>The striving for something more amazing.</p>
<p>And that defies expectations that we would consider</p>
<p>bewildering and all the things that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and I guess the last thing,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s multiple meanings of life,</p>
<p>it would be infinite games.</p>
<p>James Kars wrote the book,</p>
<p>Finite Games, Infinite Games.</p>
<p>The only game to play right now is to keep playing the game.</p>
<p>And so this goes back to the algorithm</p>
<p>of the Lex algorithm of diet soda and brisket</p>
<p>and pursuing the passion.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m suggesting is there&rsquo;s a moment here</p>
<p>where we can contemplate playing infinite games.</p>
<p>Therefore, it may make sense to err on the side</p>
<p>of making sure one is in a situation</p>
<p>to be playing infinite games if that opportunity arises.</p>
<p>So the landscape of possibility is changing very, very fast</p>
<p>and therefore our old algorithms</p>
<p>of how we might assess risk assessment</p>
<p>and what things we might pursue</p>
<p>and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly.</p>
<p>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>when I say that the game you, Mr. Brian Johnson,</p>
<p>have been playing is quite incredible.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Brian Johnson and thank you</p>
<p>to Four Sigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Diane Ackerman.</p>
<p>Our brain is a crowded chemistry lab,</p>
<p>bustling with nonstop neural conversations.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
