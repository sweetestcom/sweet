    <p>Our card this week is Oki Al Kite, The Nine of Hearts from Colorado.</p>
<p>This is part two.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t listened to part one, pause here and go back so you can follow along.</p>
<p>In part one, we unpack the beginning of the investigation into the murder of Oki Al Kite</p>
<p>in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
<p>Al was tortured and murdered in 2004, shaking that quiet community to its core.</p>
<p>But early on, detectives had a suspect, Robert Cooper, a man who had rented out Al&rsquo;s basement</p>
<p>and then disappeared, leaving a trail of phone numbers, addresses, and other identifying</p>
<p>markers behind, except they were all fake.</p>
<p>When we left off, Agent Tom Sobieski with the Aurora Police Department was digging through</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s phone records and tracking down all of the people he had called, and he was about</p>
<p>to make a discovery that left investigators scratching their heads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>As Agent Sobieski started working his way down the list of people Robert had contacted</p>
<p>before Al&rsquo;s murder, he noticed a pattern.</p>
<p>A bunch of them had ties to the University of Colorado Hospital.</p>
<p>Some of the renters only had placed ads, like, in the library at the University of Colorado</p>
<p>Hospital.</p>
<p>It was at 9th and Colorado, or nearby businesses, or in printed, like, directories for people</p>
<p>that were renting to students at the teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Some people only had their ads in those.</p>
<p>So the killer had to be down there at the hospital, had to be going in the library,</p>
<p>had to be going to nearby businesses to get the phone numbers to call the numbers he called.</p>
<p>Out of everyone he called, Agent Sobieski discovered that Robert only met three other</p>
<p>people in person.</p>
<p>Two of them weren&rsquo;t really interested in talking with investigators or didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anything helpful to add.</p>
<p>But the last one, a professor at the University of Denver who was renting out part of her</p>
<p>home, described the unnerving feeling she got when she was giving this Robert guy a</p>
<p>tour.</p>
<p>She said as soon as he walked in the door, the hair on the back of her neck stood up,</p>
<p>and she thought something horrible was going to happen to her.</p>
<p>He made comments about how he&rsquo;d seen her ad for this townhome in a ice cream restaurant</p>
<p>called Licks, and he made some comment about, sexual comment about it being Licks.</p>
<p>And he never really answered, asked any questions that would be appropriate for if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to rent someplace.</p>
<p>And so she felt that she was lucky that she survived.</p>
<p>After the visit, she said that Robert left and never contacted her again.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t see if he&rsquo;d left in a car or anything identifiable like that.</p>
<p>She was just happy to be alive.</p>
<p>It was an eerie story for sure.</p>
<p>And it confirmed for investigators that Al&rsquo;s murder wasn&rsquo;t committed by someone he knew.</p>
<p>This was probably completely random, and Robert could have just as easily picked someone else.</p>
<p>There were older women that would have been easier to subdue.</p>
<p>Older men, better locations, I feel, to murder someone.</p>
<p>For some reason, he picked Al Kite.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not really sure why.</p>
<p>Now the woman was able to give Agent Sobieski a description of Robert, and much of it they</p>
<p>had heard before, but she also said that he had a distinct voice.</p>
<p>She noticed an accent as she&rsquo;s talking to him, and she teaches English and had done</p>
<p>it for years, and she noticed a Romanian accent that he had.</p>
<p>And he confirmed to her that he was Romanian.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>No one else had mentioned any accent, much less something as specific as Romanian.</p>
<p>But most of the other testimonies had come from people who didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk</p>
<p>to this guy, and this woman was actually an English professor.</p>
<p>She spent her life studying language, so of course she picked up on it right away.</p>
<p>From her description and some of the other testimonies, Agent Sobieski was able to get</p>
<p>enough for a composite sketch.</p>
<p>But since the description of Robert&rsquo;s age varied so much, he actually had two composites</p>
<p>made.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski thought that this guy was most likely changing his appearance between each</p>
<p>meeting on purpose so that no one would really be able to get an accurate description of</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Sometimes he acted and dressed like he was in his 30s, other times his 50s.</p>
<p>So when making these sketches, he wanted to cover all of the bases, just in case someone</p>
<p>recognized him as one version versus the other.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s something you might already be thinking about that just keeps sticking out</p>
<p>in my mind.</p>
<p>Some of these conflicting descriptions actually come from times when Robert was going to visit</p>
<p>Al.</p>
<p>So wouldn&rsquo;t Al have noticed?</p>
<p>Like, oh, this guy looks different every time he comes over.</p>
<p>While we can&rsquo;t know what Al thought at the time, Agent Sobieski told our reporter that</p>
<p>his theory is the description of Robert we get from the neighbor, which is the one who</p>
<p>says that he looks older and had a cane.</p>
<p>That one might not be as accurate as some of the others, but it was early in the investigation</p>
<p>and they were desperate to find this guy, so they wanted to include it just to cover</p>
<p>all of their bases.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get any hits from the composites right away, but that was okay because they</p>
<p>still had plenty of other leads.</p>
<p>I mean, they weren&rsquo;t even done with the phone records yet.</p>
<p>As Agent Sobieski was speaking to the woman, other investigators tracked down the serial</p>
<p>number and the model of the phone to a company called Kyocera in Florida.</p>
<p>When Agent Sobieski called that company to inquire about it, they were able to tell him</p>
<p>where Robert bought the phone.</p>
<p>It was purchased at a 7-Eleven about 23 minutes from Al&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>And when officers went to the convenience store, they were immediately hopeful that</p>
<p>they would get something on this guy because there were security cameras.</p>
<p>But as you all know, it is never that easy.</p>
<p>7-Eleven at that time maintained surveillance video for 30 days and he waited 31 days to</p>
<p>activate the phone.</p>
<p>Whether he knew that or was just lucky, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So there was no surveillance of him buying the phone.</p>
<p>There was no record.</p>
<p>They also couldn&rsquo;t track Robert&rsquo;s financial trail because the store&rsquo;s records showed</p>
<p>that he paid cash for the phone.</p>
<p>So they honed back in on the data from the phone, specifically the location data.</p>
<p>That proved that he traveled as much as possible to leave a harder trail to follow.</p>
<p>But investigators were still able to tell that he had spent a lot of time near the hospital,</p>
<p>which stuck out in Agent Sobieski&rsquo;s mind, thinking maybe this guy has some connection</p>
<p>to the hospital.</p>
<p>He knew about cell sites.</p>
<p>Like I said, he traveled from Golden to, you know, far east Aurora and north to south to</p>
<p>make calls.</p>
<p>So he had that kind of knowledge back in 2004 that the police would use a cell site</p>
<p>location to try to pinpoint where he lived or where he was calling from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something a lot of people didn&rsquo;t know back then.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It seemed Robert was outsmarting investigators at every turn.</p>
<p>He thought of everything, including thinking ahead of his time.</p>
<p>But there was something the records told them that probably wasn&rsquo;t fake.</p>
<p>And it gave them a clue as to what Robert&rsquo;s daily life may have looked like.</p>
<p>You see, he didn&rsquo;t make any calls between 8 and 5, Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d do a lot of calls on weekends.</p>
<p>It was evenings.</p>
<p>So our theory is that he had some kind of a job where he was around people and couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make calls on that phone and discuss, you know, anything about renting.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want any witnesses to that.</p>
<p>There were also two to three weeks where no calls were made at all, which just brought</p>
<p>police back to their hospital theory.</p>
<p>If he were a student or faculty member at the teaching hospital, and maybe they had</p>
<p>a spring break or a vacation or something, he might not have been in the area.</p>
<p>But there could have been another reason for the break in calls.</p>
<p>Maybe he was incarcerated.</p>
<p>So they decided to pore over records from all the jails in the area.</p>
<p>But no one they came across fit.</p>
<p>Now to me, the timing of this gap is really important.</p>
<p>And we know that it took place right in the middle of the phone records.</p>
<p>But investigators couldn&rsquo;t tell our reporter when that was or even the exact number of</p>
<p>days that the break lasted.</p>
<p>Anyways, just as they were closing the door on the phone records, an investigative window</p>
<p>opened.</p>
<p>It took them 10 days to fully process Al&rsquo;s townhome, but the results were finally coming</p>
<p>in and proving to be helpful.</p>
<p>Luminol testing revealed blood residue in the shower, confirming that Robert cleaned</p>
<p>off after the murder.</p>
<p>But most importantly, they determined that the blood that they had found on the step</p>
<p>in Al&rsquo;s basement wasn&rsquo;t Al&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So it had to be the killer&rsquo;s, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not.</p>
<p>The main thing that the investigation had proven to Agent Sobieski and his team was</p>
<p>that the killer was smart.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d outmaneuvered them far before he&rsquo;d even committed the crime in the first place.</p>
<p>And so to think that he&rsquo;d be so sloppy as to leave his own blood at the crime scene,</p>
<p>it seemed almost too easy.</p>
<p>And so a new concerning theory started to develop.</p>
<p>We thought, if this guy&rsquo;s this smart to go through all this to plan this homicide,</p>
<p>and he had some association with the hospital, what&rsquo;s to say he doesn&rsquo;t bring somebody</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s blood and smear it on the step going out of the basement?</p>
<p>So that was a thought that we had, but we know that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>The thought that someone would bring another person&rsquo;s blood to the scene specifically</p>
<p>to throw investigators off was chilling, to say the least.</p>
<p>But just as quickly as that theory popped up, they put it to bed, because the mystery</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s blood wasn&rsquo;t just found on the step.</p>
<p>They also had other samples from the bedroom that weren&rsquo;t Al&rsquo;s, samples that not only</p>
<p>matched the blood on the step, but that were too mixed in with the rest of the blood to</p>
<p>have been planted.</p>
<p>There was so much blood evidence, and at the time, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations</p>
<p>told us they were only going to test 10 areas.</p>
<p>And with a whole room full of blood and walls and ceilings, we wanted to make sure one of</p>
<p>those 10 was a suspect.</p>
<p>So we had CBI actually come out, we removed the whole carpeting from the basement, we</p>
<p>laid it out in an evidence bay, and we went through it, and it was fairly quickly.</p>
<p>We had a profile, and then we ran it through CODIS, and we didn&rsquo;t get any matches in CODIS.</p>
<p>How had they gotten here?</p>
<p>One of the most brutal crimes that these seasoned detectives had ever seen was committed by</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>A ghost?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s feeling like, right?</p>
<p>Like he was invisible.</p>
<p>How had no one seen or heard a thing when a crime scene was this vicious?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what kept bothering Agent Sobieski.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been stuck on the fact that none of Al&rsquo;s neighbors said they heard any disturbances</p>
<p>despite the hours of torture that they knew Al endured.</p>
<p>And sure, he could have been gagged, but investigators didn&rsquo;t find any evidence that he was.</p>
<p>So they decided to try and recreate the attack and see what they could hear.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski went out and stood in the yard and on the sidewalk while other detectives</p>
<p>stood in the basement and screamed.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t hear a thing.</p>
<p>He even went into the home that shared a wall with Al&rsquo;s and tried the test again.</p>
<p>I had a detective stand in where he was killed and scream on top of his lungs and hit the</p>
<p>walls and I couldn&rsquo;t tell anything was going on, so it&rsquo;s just well built.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a little hard to go in order because so many things were happening all at the same</p>
<p>time in this investigation.</p>
<p>But earlier, like in the first week of the investigation, Agent Sobieski had a fraud</p>
<p>detective looking into Al&rsquo;s financials since his wallet was missing from the scene.</p>
<p>And now that was finally paying off.</p>
<p>The detective had got a hit from Saturday night.</p>
<p>Al&rsquo;s credit card was used at an ATM at the Wells Fargo Bank, which just so happens to</p>
<p>be the same Wells Fargo Bank where, if you remember from episode one, Robert had told</p>
<p>Al he worked at, like that was his whole reason for coming to town and needing the</p>
<p>new place.</p>
<p>Investigators rushed to the location and asked them if their ATM had a security camera.</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>And yes, it was working that night.</p>
<p>Investigators had finally caught a break.</p>
<p>And when they got their hands on the still images from the ATM, they were over the moon</p>
<p>because they finally had an image of Robert Cooper.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>He was wearing gloves and a ski mask that only showed the bridge of his nose and his</p>
<p>eyes.</p>
<p>So really it just confirmed that he was a white guy with, they think, dark eyes.</p>
<p>But this is better than what they had before, which was basically nothing.</p>
<p>You can actually take a look at that photo on our blog post for this episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The video showed that Robert pulled up to the ATM at 9.59 p.m. in Al&rsquo;s truck and used</p>
<p>his card to withdraw $1,000 from his account before pulling away.</p>
<p>And it was interesting because he went to the Wells Fargo at 9.99 at South Sable, where</p>
<p>he used the victim&rsquo;s credit cards.</p>
<p>And one of the transactions he did was Okie Kite would direct deposit his paycheck.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Wells Fargo customer, you can get a loan advance on your paycheck being</p>
<p>deposited prior to the paycheck being deposited.</p>
<p>The suspect knew that transaction and got money from Al&rsquo;s account, even though it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there based on the fact that he had an upcoming deposit of his paycheck.</p>
<p>So that was some knowledge of the Wells Fargo system there as well.</p>
<p>Pieces of the puzzle were falling in place.</p>
<p>Slowly they were learning more about Robert Cooper while also finally narrowing in on</p>
<p>their timeline.</p>
<p>They thought the attack on Al took place between 6 and 10 p.m. on Saturday night.</p>
<p>And this includes everything, like the attack and cleanup.</p>
<p>Then they believe Robert went straight to the ATM and then came back to ditch the car.</p>
<p>But what really stood out to Agent Sobieski from the ATM visit was the amount of money</p>
<p>Robert took.</p>
<p>Any armchair sleuths out there want to check your notes?</p>
<p>This guy could have borrowed against Al&rsquo;s full direct deposit, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He took just $1,000, the exact amount that he paid Al for the rental agreement.</p>
<p>He basically got his money back, but robbery wasn&rsquo;t the motive.</p>
<p>You know, going to the ATM machine, driving the victim&rsquo;s truck, knowing that we&rsquo;d see</p>
<p>him was, I think, was all part of his planned out murder.</p>
<p>The further we went in the investigation, the more we, I don&rsquo;t want to say we were amazed</p>
<p>by his, what he had done and the thought that went into it, but it kind of made us all step</p>
<p>back and think, you know, how long ago did this guy start planning this, this crime to</p>
<p>come up with the phone?</p>
<p>You know how he&rsquo;s going to pick a victim to go to meeting people and picking the victim</p>
<p>and then planning his crime, then doing the crime and then the ATM and then the, you know,</p>
<p>on and on and on.</p>
<p>It was a well orchestrated homicide, but there were a lot of thought went into it.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of 2004, they did everything in their power to follow every clue they could.</p>
<p>They worked with Wells Fargo security from Aurora all the way to the East Coast, trying</p>
<p>to determine if Robert really could be an employee, but they never identified a potential</p>
<p>match.</p>
<p>They also looked into students and teachers, basically anyone involved with the hospital.</p>
<p>And there were a few leads that looked promising, specifically doctors from Romania who were</p>
<p>visiting around the times of the murders or even foreign exchange students.</p>
<p>But eventually all of them were ruled out by DNA.</p>
<p>I thought maybe he came in and went to school for a few months and then did this murder</p>
<p>while he was here for school.</p>
<p>But we looked at people who delivered coffee, everything we could think of, you know, the</p>
<p>hospital, security guards, the police department there, they were great helps.</p>
<p>All the instructors, professors got the composite drawings.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t have any luck.</p>
<p>Based on how spread out all the call sites were, Agent Sobieski thought Robert had to</p>
<p>have had a method of transportation.</p>
<p>But in all their witness sightings, no one had ever seen him with his own vehicle.</p>
<p>We thought maybe he came there in a bus.</p>
<p>We contacted RTD, all the bus drivers, we hit them all up with composites.</p>
<p>We did a lot of work on this case.</p>
<p>Anybody we thought, we checked every dumpster within miles of, you know, the bank up there,</p>
<p>thinking that he may have dumped some clothing or whatever, but we never found any evidence.</p>
<p>But we spent a lot of work on this case.</p>
<p>Eventually, the leads they had all dried up, and the case went cold.</p>
<p>But Agent Sobieski and the other detectives never forgot about it.</p>
<p>In 2006, they consulted with the FBI, who put together a case bulletin that was uploaded</p>
<p>to VICAP.</p>
<p>VICAP is a nationwide database of evidence and other relevant resources from violent</p>
<p>crimes overseen by the FBI.</p>
<p>It has a lot of information stored up, but Agent Sobieski didn&rsquo;t get any positive hits</p>
<p>with his case, meaning that Robert&rsquo;s DNA didn&rsquo;t match up with DNA samples from any</p>
<p>other cases stored in the system.</p>
<p>That same year, though, the FBI sent profilers from the Behavioral Analysis Unit to try and</p>
<p>give investigators a little more insight into who this Robert guy could be.</p>
<p>I kind of agree with the FBI that this guy is a normal guy during the daytime, and he</p>
<p>has a job from 8 to 5, Monday through Friday, which the phone records kind of show, and</p>
<p>that you would not know he&rsquo;s a killer, and that he was looking for somebody to kill,</p>
<p>and he planned this perfect murder, and he had some knowledge he&rsquo;d be really interested</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>Like, crime shows that he possibly was a police officer, or maybe was fired from a police</p>
<p>department, or a security guard who couldn&rsquo;t get hired as a police officer, who wants to</p>
<p>challenge the police to catch him.</p>
<p>You know, some kind of a, maybe a minor criminal history, and that he&rsquo;s definitely worked his</p>
<p>way up to this, because you don&rsquo;t start a crime like this.</p>
<p>This would not be a beginner&rsquo;s luck murder.</p>
<p>This was very well planned out, and months of planning, and very patient.</p>
<p>In 2008, Agent Sobieski was contacted by some officers in Omaha, Nebraska, who had a possible</p>
<p>lead.</p>
<p>They had been dealing with a string of murders that had some striking similarities to Al&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>Two people had been murdered that year in their homes, and investigators thought that</p>
<p>they might be connected because both victims were related to doctors and teachers at the</p>
<p>local university, and they were stabbed excessively, one more than 15 times.</p>
<p>None of the four people in Omaha had been tortured, but even though the MO wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exactly the same, Agent Sobieski looked into the possible connection because it would fit</p>
<p>in with his theory that Robert was connected to the hospital in some way, and, you know,</p>
<p>maybe Robert had been transferred there, or was continuing his studies at that university.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about all the details regarding that investigation, but what I do know is</p>
<p>that ultimately that lead turned into yet another dead end.</p>
<p>They made an arrest in theirs, and it wasn&rsquo;t, wasn&rsquo;t, the motive was different.</p>
<p>The suspect in their case had been terminated by these people, and his career was ruined,</p>
<p>he felt, so that&rsquo;s why he was the motive for their killings.</p>
<p>It would turn out that that wasn&rsquo;t the end of strange coincidences, because in 2009,</p>
<p>there was another suspicious murder.</p>
<p>This time, it was out in California, where a man was found in his home with his hands</p>
<p>bound and multiple stab wounds, but what really grabbed Agent Sobieski&rsquo;s attention was that</p>
<p>this man had a connection to Al.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s name was Lee Scott Hall, and he had worked in the same building as Al back</p>
<p>when Al lived in California prior to 2000.</p>
<p>Now they didn&rsquo;t work for the same company, but still, it was a weird coincidence, weird</p>
<p>enough for Agent Sobieski to look into it.</p>
<p>We talked to all Mr. Hall&rsquo;s co-workers, we were interviewed, he never mentioned Oki Kite,</p>
<p>we interviewed all, re-interviewed all of Oki&rsquo;s family, friends, he never mentioned</p>
<p>any Mr. Hall, or the fact that he was murdered, or that he knew him, or anything.</p>
<p>Investigators at the Livermore Police Department then told Agent Sobieski that they had confirmed</p>
<p>sightings of a suspect and a motive which actually didn&rsquo;t match in Al&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was a whistleblower on a government project where possibly billions of dollars</p>
<p>had been wasted, and they thought he was murdered because he was a whistleblower, that type</p>
<p>of thing, that case has never been solved.</p>
<p>The suspect in that case, they don&rsquo;t have DNA, but the suspect in that case seen in</p>
<p>the driveway of the victim, Mr. Hall&rsquo;s residence that day, was a black male, which</p>
<p>would eliminate him from our crime.</p>
<p>The years dragged on with fewer and fewer leads, and by the 10-year anniversary, this</p>
<p>case was ice cold.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski still did his due diligence, though.</p>
<p>He updated VICAP every year and followed every new lead that came his way.</p>
<p>The case was featured countless times in local media and got spots on TV shows like America&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Most Wanted and Sensing Murder.</p>
<p>Over the years, it gained some notoriety and everyone who heard about it developed their</p>
<p>own theories, one of the most popular being that maybe Al was a victim of the serial killer</p>
<p>Israel Keyes.</p>
<p>Israel, who we actually did an episode on for Crime Junkie back in 2019, was a notorious</p>
<p>serial killer who murdered at least three people across the U.S., although the true</p>
<p>number of his victims isn&rsquo;t really known because he never left any substantial evidence</p>
<p>behind, just like Al&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>He was arrested in 2012 and died by suicide that December while in custody, before he</p>
<p>was ever tried.</p>
<p>Despite similarities, though, Israel&rsquo;s DNA wasn&rsquo;t a match to Robert&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Another theory from a lot of the online chatter was that Al&rsquo;s killer was connected to the</p>
<p>murder of a man named Mike Emmert.</p>
<p>Mike was a real estate agent killed in the home that he was hired to sell in Washington</p>
<p>in 2001.</p>
<p>And this one, this one has eerie similarities.</p>
<p>Mike was stabbed multiple times, and while it doesn&rsquo;t seem like he was bound in any</p>
<p>way, his wallet and his car were stolen.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the eerie part.</p>
<p>Officer&rsquo;s main person of interest was an unknown man who had met Mike&rsquo;s family a few</p>
<p>times and walked with a cane that they believed was fake and part of a ruse.</p>
<p>But once again, they would hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>His investigators had a DNA sample from Mike&rsquo;s crime scene to compare with Robert&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski still kept pressing on.</p>
<p>And as DNA technology continued to advance, he finally got something solid.</p>
<p>In 2017, the CBI was able to use new methods called phenotyping and genetic genealogy to</p>
<p>build a better profile of Robert.</p>
<p>So Parabon Nanolabs can take a DNA profile, put it in their database, and they can tell</p>
<p>you with quite a high degree of certainty what color skin your suspect will have, what</p>
<p>color his eyes will be, what color his hair will be.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;ll have freckles, they can tell you what part of the world he came from.</p>
<p>And they can put all that information into a computer and they can give you a composite</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>The results said that Robert was most likely Romanian, with brown hair and brown or hazel</p>
<p>eyes.</p>
<p>They created and released a new digital composite of Robert and even made an age-progressed</p>
<p>version to show what he would have looked like at the time they were made in 2017.</p>
<p>But the new composites didn&rsquo;t bring any new leads, and they couldn&rsquo;t find any trace</p>
<p>of anyone in Robert&rsquo;s family using genealogy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking not even distant relatives, which, for Agent Sobieski, confirmed that</p>
<p>Robert and his family most likely lived outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>So even though this didn&rsquo;t pan out and point directly to their killer, maybe their</p>
<p>theory that he was a foreign exchange student or a visiting doctor did have some weight</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski worked with Interpol and Homeland Security to get the DNA uploaded into some</p>
<p>of their international systems, hoping that they&rsquo;d get some sort of hit there.</p>
<p>But they still ended up with nothing.</p>
<p>Which means, you guys, this man&rsquo;s DNA hasn&rsquo;t shown up in any other crime scenes anywhere</p>
<p>else in the world, or at least it hasn&rsquo;t been uploaded to any systems.</p>
<p>It seems unreal, right?</p>
<p>Was this some perfectly planned-out crime, just one and done, or did he get better and</p>
<p>leave even less behind?</p>
<p>If he was smart enough to know about cell phone pings and the window of surveillance</p>
<p>footage and burner phones, maybe he was smart enough to completely change his MO altogether.</p>
<p>You understand now why this case gnaws at me, right?</p>
<p>Because you can see Robert Cooper in any unsolved case if you really want to, if he really is</p>
<p>that clever.</p>
<p>In 2019, with not a whole lot to lose, investigators allowed Al&rsquo;s case to be featured on the Oxygen</p>
<p>Network show The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes.</p>
<p>Their production team traveled to Aurora, and it was actually a member of their team</p>
<p>that stumbled upon an interesting piece of information.</p>
<p>They learned about a group called the Turkish Hezbollah, which is a mostly disbanded terrorist</p>
<p>group in Turkey.</p>
<p>But while they were active, they had some gruesome torture techniques.</p>
<p>That came up as part of the falaka, is what the term is for the beating in the bottom</p>
<p>of the feet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a theory that I haven&rsquo;t ruled out.</p>
<p>They use that type of torture, and it&rsquo;s from that area of the world, so I certainly haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ruled it out.</p>
<p>The idea that Robert could have been affiliated with this group in some way, or at least taken</p>
<p>inspiration from them, was definitely interesting.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the theory didn&rsquo;t help push the case forward.</p>
<p>It ended up becoming another bit of information to add to the 17 three-ring binders Agent</p>
<p>Sobieski had filled out over the course of his investigation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really all he has, bits of information that have never quite fit together to form</p>
<p>a full picture of Al&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>The case remained frozen as Agent Sobieski retired in 2021, after more than three decades</p>
<p>with the department, almost half of which he spent on Al&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of the road for the investigation.</p>
<p>In January 2022, Detective Jason McDonald became a cold case detective for the Aurora</p>
<p>police, and he was assigned Al&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>He hit the ground running trying to dig up new leads, and it wasn&rsquo;t long before an interesting</p>
<p>one found its way to him.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2022, he was contacted by the FBI about a 2009 murder that took place</p>
<p>in Lincolnshire, England.</p>
<p>And that case matched Al&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s name was Alan Wood, and he was in his 50s when he was found murdered</p>
<p>in his home.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been stabbed, tortured, even had a knife wound to his head, just like Al Kite.</p>
<p>His cause of death was also a cut to his throat.</p>
<p>Not only did they find some of his killer&rsquo;s DNA, but the man had even been photographed</p>
<p>around the region wearing a mask and using Alan&rsquo;s credit card at ATMs.</p>
<p>We have a picture in the blog post for this episode of all that as well.</p>
<p>Now that crime was still unsolved, and Detective McDonald was over the moon when he learned</p>
<p>that they had Alan&rsquo;s killer&rsquo;s DNA on file.</p>
<p>So they went ahead and compared that sample with Robert&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The test took a few weeks, and Detective McDonald was shocked to learn that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a match.</p>
<p>But he was just getting started.</p>
<p>Since then, he&rsquo;s been able to once again utilize updated technology to inch the investigation</p>
<p>ever so slightly closer to the finish line.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s connected with a local organization called United Data Connect, and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been retesting Robert&rsquo;s DNA and digging deeper into his genealogy.</p>
<p>So when you upload your DNA to FamilyTreeDNA.com, and you opt in for it being accessible to</p>
<p>law enforcement, and say we have a suspect DNA profile that we&rsquo;re trying to find in</p>
<p>that database, and we get something that has a relative match to it, it&rsquo;ll give a value.</p>
<p>Like on a scale of one to a hundred, for example, a hundred would be a very high number, as</p>
<p>an example.</p>
<p>Using this process, United Data Connect was able to find what Detective McDonald says</p>
<p>is a high value match to Robert&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>About 41 percent.</p>
<p>There is some relation to our killer&rsquo;s DNA, but it&rsquo;s not super high.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking in the third to fourth cousin range, which would mean our killer</p>
<p>and this person who&rsquo;s uploaded their DNA into FamilyTreeDNA.com have about, they probably</p>
<p>have the same great, great grandparents.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be a pretty big family tree to map out, but there is a relation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been working on contacting them to try to map out their family tree and get</p>
<p>more people, more males in their family tested with DNA kits to narrow down this killer profile.</p>
<p>There is some hesitancy, and I think it&rsquo;s understandable when you get a cold call from</p>
<p>a person saying they&rsquo;re a detective in another state who has seen your profile and wants</p>
<p>to dig more about your family history to find a killer in your family.</p>
<p>I think that cold call can be quite intimidating and cause some hesitancy in some people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of roadblock I face with this part of the job.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Detective McDonald says that he will most likely have to travel to this family</p>
<p>and get additional samples himself in order to complete their family tree and bring them</p>
<p>one step closer to Al&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just about finding the time in his schedule.</p>
<p>I mean, Al is only one of dozens of cold cases on his plate.</p>
<p>The DNA is the key to unlocking the mystery of Robert&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beyond important because not only did this guy end Al&rsquo;s life in such a horrific</p>
<p>way, but investigators believe he&rsquo;s done something similar before.</p>
<p>And the longer he is able to be free out in the world, the more likely he is to do it again.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been an officer for 35 years here with the ROAR PD, and this is the biggest</p>
<p>case I&rsquo;ve ever had here.</p>
<p>And I think about this case quite often.</p>
<p>I could honestly say that this case comes to mind even though I&rsquo;m retired for a year,</p>
<p>probably once a week.</p>
<p>Al was such a nice guy, and he was targeted for no reason and murdered, you know, he had</p>
<p>family and I met Al&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>And I mean, the family&rsquo;s just crushed beyond, if you can imagine, your brother being found</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>We all feel kind of guilty that we can&rsquo;t solve it because that was our job.</p>
<p>And Al was such a nice guy.</p>
<p>If you have any information about Al&rsquo;s case or Robert&rsquo;s real identity and whereabouts,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>If you were in or around Aurora in 2004, you may have seen this guy, even if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize it before.</p>
<p>He was white with brown hair and brown eyes, likely.</p>
<p>And while he didn&rsquo;t have any tattoos or markings that would make him stand out, he did have</p>
<p>that recognizable Romanian accent.</p>
<p>And he may have frequented Wells Fargo locations or the University Hospital.</p>
<p>If this information jogs your memory even a little bit, you can call Detective McDonald</p>
<p>at the Aurora Police Department at 303-739-6013.</p>
<p>Metro Denver Crime Stoppers is also offering a reward of up to $2,000 for tips, and you</p>
<p>can call them at 720-913-7867.</p>
