    <p>Check out what, what time is it over there?</p>
<p>Well, we started at 8am. So now it&rsquo;s 828. It&rsquo;s 828. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>be on the slopes at 11. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ll be out there skiing. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in Niseko, in Japan, and take a quick flight to Sapporo, Sapporo</p>
<p>and then you drive two hours into the mountains. Yesterday I</p>
<p>cat skied. There&rsquo;s an abandoned ski mountain.</p>
<p>By the way, in honor of you, I grabbed a Sapporo from the</p>
<p>fridge today.</p>
<p>Oh, very nice. This week&rsquo;s episode brought to you by.</p>
<p>So they drive the cat ski up, and then you ski down and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all fresh track. So it&rsquo;s literally an abandoned ski</p>
<p>resort. You know, during the financial crisis here.</p>
<p>I just asked you what time it was. That&rsquo;s all I asked you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called small talk. It&rsquo;s called banter. I thought you</p>
<p>might be interested in your besties life, but apparently</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the show. Everybody wants to hear the show. A lot of</p>
<p>news going on. And, you know, in our industry, there&rsquo;s been a big</p>
<p>discussion about RSUs and stock options, both the cost of these</p>
<p>things. And then there&rsquo;s another issue of people staying private</p>
<p>for too long. If you remember, for folks listening, Airbnb,</p>
<p>Uber famously took over 10 years to go public. People like Bill</p>
<p>Gurley wrote about this, hey, you should get public. When the</p>
<p>window is open, obviously, the window is closed right now or</p>
<p>largely closed stripe. Now people are speculating they</p>
<p>missed their window, they have a $4 billion tax bill due to cover</p>
<p>expiring employee RSUs. Those are restricted stock units. And</p>
<p>at the same time, Foursquare, a company from the web 2.0 era,</p>
<p>this is, you know, 1015 years ago, when they were very popular</p>
<p>check in software mobile location app, they are going to</p>
<p>let their previous employees stock option grants expire</p>
<p>according to the information. They issued these options in</p>
<p>2016, seven year window before expiration, more than 100 form</p>
<p>employees will be impacted. And some of them are the very early</p>
<p>team members. And this employee stock option problem is becoming</p>
<p>acute because, hey, you people waited to go public.</p>
<p>Basically, what happens is you grant an RSU, which is</p>
<p>effectively W two income when it&rsquo;s realized with an expiration</p>
<p>date. But that expiration date forces you to be public so that</p>
<p>that RSU can be exchanged for value. And that&rsquo;s like a 10 year</p>
<p>window. So then these guys have to go in and modify that date,</p>
<p>and push it out by another four or five, six years or whatever.</p>
<p>That is a deemed event by the IRS that then creates withholding</p>
<p>tax issues, right? So you then have to, you then have to</p>
<p>withhold tax on behalf of the employees. And so that</p>
<p>collective number is the 4 billion that stripe is trying to</p>
<p>raise, according to a leaked pitch deck, stripe implied they</p>
<p>needed 2.3 billion in capital by the end of q1 2023. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with Goldman Sachs to raise a few billion at a $55</p>
<p>billion valuation that&rsquo;s down 42% from the peak of 95 billion in</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>One wonders if they had gone public, what their</li>
</ol>
<p>valuation would be right now, can we just say real quick why</p>
<p>this matters, Jacob? Like, yes. So anyway, why does it matter</p>
<p>to me? Yeah, why does this? Why does this all matter? Like, why</p>
<p>do we care? Thank you. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re getting to.</p>
<p>I posted a link. This is a 2013 interview that Zuck did with</p>
<p>Michael Arrington of TechCrunch. And if you go all the way back,</p>
<p>the apprehension to go public was one thing that we really</p>
<p>anchor to a lot at Facebook in the early days. And at the time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember, but there was these</p>
<p>arcane laws around the number of shareholders that you could have.</p>
<p>And I think the issue specifically was that after 500</p>
<p>shareholders, you have to publicly release your financials.</p>
<p>And so we did all kinds of things to make sure we never hit</p>
<p>the 500 cap. And we tried to push the IPO date as far out as</p>
<p>possible, because we thought that it would keep people more</p>
<p>focused. And then in 2010, or 11, I told this story a couple</p>
<p>times, one of the things that I was advocating for pretty</p>
<p>aggressively was trying to launch a mobile operating system</p>
<p>to compete with iOS and Android. And we had put together all this</p>
<p>work and brought in Intel and AT&amp;T and all these people. And</p>
<p>it came down to the fact that we needed a couple billion dollars</p>
<p>to float this thing. And we didn&rsquo;t have that money. So the</p>
<p>only solution to that would have been to go public, but it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the right moment in time. And Zach was uncomfortable</p>
<p>with it. A year after going public. One of the things that</p>
<p>he said publicly in this tech crunch thing was, wow, I should</p>
<p>have just gone public sooner. It wasn&rsquo;t nearly the bad thing that</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be. And when you look subsequently</p>
<p>at how much money they&rsquo;ve spent in AR and VR, spending half a</p>
<p>quarters of that cash could have given them the chance to</p>
<p>disrupt Android and iOS in 2010 and 11, which in hindsight is</p>
<p>obviously a no brainer bet, right? So even though I think we</p>
<p>at Facebook were the ones to really put this in the water</p>
<p>table about not going public, I think a lot of startups should</p>
<p>have gone back to first principles to really question</p>
<p>whether waiting as long as possible actually makes sense.</p>
<p>So I was curious about the stripe situation. So I asked my</p>
<p>team to do a little bit of work on how would you value this</p>
<p>thing if it were going public. And the interesting thing about</p>
<p>stripe is that it operates in a really transparent middleman</p>
<p>business. So what&rsquo;s interesting about stripe is that so many of</p>
<p>the people in the ecosystem are public. And so what that means</p>
<p>is you can build a pretty accurate mosaic of how well or</p>
<p>not well that business is doing by interpolating all the other</p>
<p>data from all of these other companies that are public and</p>
<p>are forced to report. And so there&rsquo;s like a couple of really</p>
<p>interesting things that jump off this page. And so the first</p>
<p>thing that we did was we looked at what is the future</p>
<p>profitability look like x of growth. And what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is that you look at companies like visa and MasterCard that</p>
<p>are doing quite well and have done really well for a long</p>
<p>time. But you look at this outlier and IDN and IDN is</p>
<p>probably the most obvious competitor to stripe. And the</p>
<p>thing that is demonstrated here is how incredibly profitable</p>
<p>this business is. And how much operating leverage they have,</p>
<p>which means that their opex is relatively constrained. Because</p>
<p>it turns out in the x&amp;y axis here, just so people who are</p>
<p>listening can understand the chart. Sure. So if you take the</p>
<p>market cap on the x axis and divide it by their sales</p>
<p>estimate, you get a multiple of the enterprise value to their</p>
<p>sales. Got it. And if you look at the 2024 estimated EBITDA</p>
<p>margin that they&rsquo;re forecasting x of their long term sales</p>
<p>Kager, what you start to get a sense of is the operating</p>
<p>leverage that this business has. And so all of this basically</p>
<p>nets out to three interesting takeaways. When stripe got</p>
<p>underwritten at $96 billion. It&rsquo;s this data point right here</p>
<p>where you know, you see your stripe previous round,</p>
<p>five x enterprise value to divided by 2024 divided over</p>
<p>their long term, their long term EBITDA exactly by their sales</p>
<p>estimate. And then if you look at the $55 billion valuation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s down. So what it looks like it&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>appropriately so people are doing the right thing, which is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re rerating the stock right by approximately 5060%. But</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting is not where they are in terms of where they</p>
<p>used to be. But the interesting thing is where they are relative</p>
<p>to their most obvious competitor agent. So Nick, please bring up</p>
<p>the next one. So this is where things get really interesting</p>
<p>because we looked at what was odd yen. And what was stripes</p>
<p>GMV per employee a couple of years ago before all hell broke</p>
<p>loose in the private funding markets. And what you see is</p>
<p>they were pretty equivalent businesses. And they had roughly</p>
<p>the same amount of employees. But this crazy thing happened,</p>
<p>which is that if you look at the gray bar, this is the number of</p>
<p>employees that stripe has, it went crazy from a little over</p>
<p>2000 to almost 8000. So a four x of employees in</p>
<p>x in 24 months, they had it&rsquo;s 6000 people just pause for a</p>
<p>second on that 6000 people in 24 months and 700 days or so.</p>
<p>Right? Three people a day. And if you do the same calculation</p>
<p>for our gen, it shows that they a little bit less than grew by</p>
<p>about 75%. And then if you look at the growth of GMV, and you</p>
<p>impute, how productive is each employee? Basically, this is the</p>
<p>story of what&rsquo;s happened to stripe and Audien, which is that</p>
<p>Audien has found operating leverage, right? So they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found and maintained incredible profitability. And stripe has</p>
<p>added an enormous number of employees. Now, the question is</p>
<p>why? Right? So it turns out that these guys at the top line are</p>
<p>growing roughly the same except Audien actually takes</p>
<p>meaningfully less on a per transaction basis than stripe</p>
<p>does. And the reason is that Audien services these large head</p>
<p>customers, think big, bulky folks that have huge amounts of</p>
<p>transactions. And so as a result, have pricing power. And</p>
<p>stripe has some of those customers as well. In fact, they</p>
<p>just announced that they&rsquo;re going to process a large portion</p>
<p>of Amazon&rsquo;s payment volume. But what&rsquo;s happened at the same time</p>
<p>is that those kinds of deals aren&rsquo;t necessarily that</p>
<p>profitable. And so you have to hire a lot more people to build</p>
<p>a lot more features so that you can generate revenue from the</p>
<p>long tail of customers, all of these SMBs. And this is the tail</p>
<p>of these two companies, which is that stripe has some head</p>
<p>customers, but many, many, many tail customers. Audien has</p>
<p>mostly head customers, fewer tail customers. And so the</p>
<p>leverage in the business is that Audien has most of these</p>
<p>employees in Europe, where the cost of these folks is much,</p>
<p>much cheaper, and they have less than half the number. And so as</p>
<p>both of these companies continue to grow, you have one that has</p>
<p>maintained, and frankly, grazed their long term profit</p>
<p>projections, because they see it in the business, even at lower</p>
<p>transaction costs, and stripe, which is having a little bit</p>
<p>more trouble. So I thought it was a really interesting</p>
<p>expose. The takeaway for me is that if you were sitting inside</p>
<p>the company, and obviously hindsight is 2020. The most</p>
<p>profitable thing they could have done from an enterprise value</p>
<p>perspective would probably have been to go public in 2018 2019.</p>
<p>Because they could have raised max value at max valuation,</p>
<p>cleaned out all these options issues and have a huge balance</p>
<p>sheet of cash with which to do stuff, whether it&rsquo;s acquisitions</p>
<p>or other things. Because the thing that I struggle with is,</p>
<p>is there going to be long term profitability in all of these</p>
<p>tail products? Because if you look in the SAS ecosystem, and</p>
<p>sacks, I&rsquo;ll hand the ball to you. There&rsquo;s companies building</p>
<p>all this other stuff. And these point products are probably</p>
<p>pretty good to sack.</p>
<p>What do you think about edge end going after the fat part of the</p>
<p>long tail and then stripe going after the long tail having many</p>
<p>more customers?</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re both viable strategies. And I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually written about this. I wrote a blog some time</p>
<p>ago called enterprises versus SMBs, who&rsquo;s the better customer</p>
<p>for B2B SAS companies. And I think the sort of old school</p>
<p>traditional view is that enterprises were always the best</p>
<p>customers because they have the biggest budgets that translates</p>
<p>into the biggest annual contract values, or ACVs. This provides</p>
<p>the highest ROI on sales efforts. So now you can make a</p>
<p>sales driven distribution strategy pencil in the first</p>
<p>place, the prospects are easy to identify, you know, after all,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going after the fortune 500, you can just make a</p>
<p>list of the 500 companies. So I think the traditional gold</p>
<p>standard was sort of the head, like you&rsquo;re saying, Jason, the</p>
<p>enterprises, however, I think in recent years, it&rsquo;s become more</p>
<p>popular to pursue the stripe strategy of the sort of more SMB.</p>
<p>Why is that more popular?</p>
<p>Well, because first of all, stripes are the SMBs are more</p>
<p>early adopters. So when you&rsquo;re a startup, it&rsquo;s way easier to</p>
<p>satisfy their standards to satisfy their needs, their needs</p>
<p>are less complicated, you don&rsquo;t have to have sock to compliance</p>
<p>and everything else. If you&rsquo;re more risk taking, right? Yeah,</p>
<p>if you solve an immediate pain point for them, they&rsquo;ll just buy</p>
<p>it. Okay. Whereas I think enterprises are more late</p>
<p>adopters, they tend to be more skeptical of new software</p>
<p>categories. Yeah, I think in addition to that, the SMB sales</p>
<p>cycle is really quick. I mean, I&rsquo;d say typically one to two</p>
<p>months, you can close a deal, the sale itself is simpler. Like I</p>
<p>said, that&rsquo;s the product requirements are simpler, and</p>
<p>the low end of the market tends to be the most underserved part.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great to play where the incumbents are not that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>traditional strategy as you go after the low end of the market</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been kind of overlooked or ignored. And that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>what stripe has done here, too, is no one was really serving</p>
<p>these these developers. So I tend to think it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>strategy, too. And the truth is, it&rsquo;s not one or the other, I</p>
<p>think you just have to pick, you know, which of your battles that</p>
<p>you want to fight. And some starts to go after enterprises,</p>
<p>and some will go after SMBs. And it really goes down, I think,</p>
<p>to founder market fit, I think founders who are better at</p>
<p>sales, probably skew more towards an enterprise got a</p>
<p>strategy, whereas if you&rsquo;re more of a product founder, you go</p>
<p>after SMBs, brilliant summary over time sacks for a company to</p>
<p>thrive over long periods of time. Do you have to serve as</p>
<p>both? Or do you think you can stay in one of those things and</p>
<p>grow indefinitely? Well, what I&rsquo;ve seen is that if you start</p>
<p>the low end of the market with SMBs over time, you can move up</p>
<p>market because what happens is that as your product gets more</p>
<p>and more sophisticated, and your company and your ability to</p>
<p>execute and deliver gets more sophisticated, you can start</p>
<p>satisfying the needs of bigger and bigger companies. So you</p>
<p>start SMB, then you go mid market, then you eventually get</p>
<p>to enterprises. I think if you start with enterprises, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hard to go down market because it&rsquo;s a lot easier to add</p>
<p>requirements to your product than to actually strip</p>
<p>complexity out of a product that&rsquo;s actually surprisingly</p>
<p>difficult to do. So I think it&rsquo;s I think either strategy can</p>
<p>work either you start the low end and move up market. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the classic Clay Christensen innovators delimit type thing,</p>
<p>or you, you just start the top and you stay at the top. It</p>
<p>makes sense. It&rsquo;s just I mean, adding 10 people a day over two</p>
<p>years, that&rsquo;s a large number of people to add to a company.</p>
<p>Well, in fairness to stripe, they were very honest about</p>
<p>this. And they were like, we overestimated got confident and</p>
<p>we overhired. And they found that all the coordination costs</p>
<p>the SACS point became too high. That&rsquo;s exactly what the</p>
<p>collison said in their memo. So I think that they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>course correct and get back to this. I think the point that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>making unemotionally, I don&rsquo;t own stripe nor adjunct, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a horse in this race is more that in this market,</p>
<p>specifically in these middlemen, highly transparent middlemen</p>
<p>markets, it&rsquo;s very difficult to hide the cheese, meaning the</p>
<p>ability to get to an extremely precise valuation model is</p>
<p>pretty easy. You know, this was half a day&rsquo;s work that we did.</p>
<p>And the point is, all this data is out there. And so it means</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to go public as a company like this,</p>
<p>you have to be quite thoughtful about how outside and folks will</p>
<p>value you because the terminal buyer is very, very</p>
<p>sophisticated and pretty smart about how to think about spaces</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>Freeberg, when you look at this, it kind of dovetails with the</p>
<p>get fit, Brad Gerstner, you on Twitter doing more with less</p>
<p>employees. Zuckerberg, again, says he is getting rid of</p>
<p>managers, he&rsquo;s asking managers to saxes discussion about, you</p>
<p>know, the layers of management that got added and added, where</p>
<p>high performers would be would have five people put under them</p>
<p>10 people put under them. Is it going to be? Are you impressed</p>
<p>with how quickly the industry is responding to this new</p>
<p>environment? Or are they not responding fast enough? In terms</p>
<p>of headcount revenue, because now we&rsquo;re looking at revenue</p>
<p>per employee, this is a never looked at that. It&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>decade since we looked at that.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a different situation where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about the scalability of a business. Like when I look at</p>
<p>like the value that a business has created, you start first</p>
<p>with like, can you make a product? Can you sell the</p>
<p>product? Do people want to buy the product? And then you know,</p>
<p>can you make money selling it? And then there&rsquo;s this metric</p>
<p>that a lot of people use, which is LTV to CAC, which is the</p>
<p>lifetime value of acquiring a new customer divided by the cost to</p>
<p>acquire that customer. But I think you can generalize that</p>
<p>ratio to talk about business performance more broadly, which</p>
<p>is, you know, capital deployed, which is typically what CAC is</p>
<p>used in terms of growth on the denominator, and then capital</p>
<p>returned over time, which can be the numerator. And so you can</p>
<p>kind of think about that LTV to CAC ratio, being something more</p>
<p>broadly defined as something like ROIC, or what have you, the</p>
<p>question for the scalability of any business is, does that ratio</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s LTV to CAC or ROIC return on invested capital? Does</p>
<p>it get bigger or smaller? Does it increase or decrease? Does</p>
<p>that ratio increase or decrease as you get bigger as you spend</p>
<p>more money as you deploy more money? If it&rsquo;s getting smaller,</p>
<p>then mathematically, you can resolve pretty quickly to the</p>
<p>asymptotic valuation that that business will achieve or the</p>
<p>asymptotic revenue that that business will achieve. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very scary kind of circumstance when a business</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tracking that metric starts to see that metric</p>
<p>shrink. If that metric is growing, then you have an, you</p>
<p>know, a hyperbolic kind of moment and you can build</p>
<p>platforms and add products and invest very heavily and take</p>
<p>lots of risk and take lots of bets. When it&rsquo;s going the wrong</p>
<p>way. You have two options. Number one is you have to make a</p>
<p>change or a pivot in the business to get it to go the</p>
<p>other way. Or number two is you have to take advantage of that</p>
<p>moment before the market finds out about that moment. Because</p>
<p>as soon as the market realizes that that ratio is going the</p>
<p>wrong way, your valuation multiple what you&rsquo;re worth as a</p>
<p>multiple of revenue or profit shrinks dramatically, because</p>
<p>then the market can also see that asymptote and outcome. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very often the case that one should, you know, as a</p>
<p>board member as an investor, urge entrepreneurs, CEOs,</p>
<p>founders, managers to think really clearly about that</p>
<p>metric, what&rsquo;s the right way to define the denominator and define</p>
<p>the numerator in our business, and define that ratio over time.</p>
<p>And as soon as it starts tracking the wrong way, you have</p>
<p>a moment, you can either fix it, or you got to go sell the</p>
<p>business or go public and raise capital before the market</p>
<p>catches on and your valuation shrinks. So I think what</p>
<p>Yeah, so when I see what you&rsquo;re showing in this data, and</p>
<p>talking about this, the shrinking valuation issue for</p>
<p>Stripe, it really, I think highlights this important point,</p>
<p>this broad point, which is did they miss the window? Did they</p>
<p>miss the moment where suddenly, you know, the shrinkage is</p>
<p>causing, you know, an asymptotic outcome for this business that</p>
<p>it makes investors a little bit like, well, I&rsquo;m not as excited</p>
<p>about that, because it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no longer as</p>
<p>much upside. And it might be time to kind of devalue the</p>
<p>company. And did they miss the moment to go public, raise a</p>
<p>bunch of capital, you know, to go and try new things and</p>
<p>hopefully pivot into a way. So I don&rsquo;t know enough about the</p>
<p>business. But that&rsquo;s my broad kind of assessment of this, this</p>
<p>interesting thing about that space. We talked to one of our</p>
<p>friends at our poker game, who runs a large consumer facing</p>
<p>business. And I don&rsquo;t know if you were there for that</p>
<p>conversation off revert, but I was, you were there. Yeah. And</p>
<p>one of the interesting things he said is, we are at a level of</p>
<p>scale where we just bid these guys against each other. And</p>
<p>these things tend to now be loss leaders for them. Which is to</p>
<p>say effectively, that cost structure becomes really</p>
<p>important. So your CAC becomes very important, because your</p>
<p>LTVs are capped, right? And the LTVs are capped, because these</p>
<p>companies have enough negotiating leverage to say,</p>
<p>well, if you want my business, here&rsquo;s the cost of doing this</p>
<p>business, which makes a ton of sense if you&rsquo;re any large</p>
<p>purveyor of services that require payment processing</p>
<p>infrastructure. So one of the interesting dynamics, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re learning in this market is how it&rsquo;s really not a market,</p>
<p>right, there are segments, and there&rsquo;s embedded profitability</p>
<p>in each segment. So to your point, Friedberg, this is the</p>
<p>sum of at least three or four different LTV to CAC ratios,</p>
<p>right? The tail looks very different, which is why you have</p>
<p>to build a ton of features. And the head just wants pure play.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about cost first. Because all of these guys want</p>
<p>want to pick up every nickel and dime that&rsquo;s on the floor,</p>
<p>because for them, on billions of transactions is meaningful to</p>
<p>them. It&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s an EPS miss or, or beat, right for</p>
<p>them, which has huge implications to their stock. This</p>
<p>is a market that I think is going to be really fascinating</p>
<p>to uncover and peel back the layers of over the next by the</p>
<p>way, we haven&rsquo;t even talked about what Stripe does as a</p>
<p>business. I know we have a diverse audience that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>all come from tech. Yeah. So Stripe is will process your</p>
<p>transactions, but they were the first people to make it as</p>
<p>simple as putting a snippet of code into your app. To process</p>
<p>a payment, they can be with Visa, MasterCard and those other</p>
<p>places, they charge you a percentage of each transaction.</p>
<p>So to Tramont&rsquo;s point, these larger answer devs, developers,</p>
<p>510 years ago love this because they can instantly get payments,</p>
<p>right. It&rsquo;s abstracted the whole thing just the same way</p>
<p>cloud computing does write storage at s3, etc. So you can</p>
<p>kind of think about it that way. But a large whale in the system</p>
<p>chamath, which you said, add yen has a lot of whales, not a lot</p>
<p>of long tail stripe, because it&rsquo;s developer friendly. And a</p>
<p>snippet of code, they have this huge long tail, anybody can do</p>
<p>stripe. In fact, people who are using things like substack or</p>
<p>Patreon, I believe, they can just drop in their stripe</p>
<p>account. So people now, businesses have one have a stripe</p>
<p>account, they just drop it in there. So for me, that seems</p>
<p>like a huge potential in the future, because some of those</p>
<p>could become whales in the system.</p>
<p>And the long tail gives stripe a lot of pricing power, because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no way for any one of those entities to have</p>
<p>enough leverage to tell stripe, hey, I don&rsquo;t want to pay 2.9%</p>
<p>plus 20 or 30 cents a transaction, right? Whereas if</p>
<p>you go to the head, I think adyen is charging like 1.3 or 4%.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a wholly different market. And the pricing as a</p>
<p>result is totally different.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s interesting to me, sacks that we now are getting</p>
<p>down to, you know, brass tacks here, we&rsquo;re analyzing these</p>
<p>money printing businesses and saying, what is the ultimate</p>
<p>value of this? 1020 years from now, Chamath and I got a front</p>
<p>row seat to that, because there&rsquo;s a natural audience to</p>
<p>every single service. For AOL, it was 30 million paid subs a</p>
<p>month. At I think the peak was 30 bucks a month people were</p>
<p>paying Chamath. So at the time for 99. Yeah. So you know, you</p>
<p>start looking at those numbers, you know, a billion dollars a</p>
<p>month almost in just and it was a fixed cost business. But then</p>
<p>boom, he just hit a ceiling and competition emerged emerged in</p>
<p>the in the case of broadband. And then that business just</p>
<p>slowly deprecated over time. So sacks, what does this moment tell</p>
<p>you for founders, a lot of the listeners here and capital</p>
<p>allocators, in terms of assessing businesses for the</p>
<p>last and this will pivot into our next story. The last couple</p>
<p>of years, you know, if you were a first time fund manager, you</p>
<p>were investing in 19 2019 to 2021. high valuations, those,</p>
<p>those funds, are they ever going to be able to grow a profit? And</p>
<p>then people were investing in those based on momentum, logo</p>
<p>chasing. This is now back to, you know, sharpening your</p>
<p>pencils, Bill Gurley style investing. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah. I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about it before. There&rsquo;s nothing new</p>
<p>here. When you&rsquo;re in a boom, the only three things that matter</p>
<p>are growth, growth and growth. And when you&rsquo;re in a downturn,</p>
<p>the three things that matter are growth, burn and margins. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that growth stops mattering. It&rsquo;s just that people also care</p>
<p>about burn and margins. And, you know, the companies that fare</p>
<p>the worst are the ones that have inefficient growth, that</p>
<p>basically have burned a lot of money to grow. They have, you</p>
<p>know, lower negative gross margins, they are burning way</p>
<p>too much money, the burn multiple doesn&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>basically, the ratio of money burnt to net new ARR that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re adding, those companies get called out, when all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you have regime change, like we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>CAC is one of the early signs of this, Chamath, you and I saw</p>
<p>that member AOL was sending DVDs everywhere, and CAC became two</p>
<p>or $300 for every AOL subscriber. And then they were</p>
<p>playing this funny accounting game. I don&rsquo;t remember this,</p>
<p>Chamath, where they were saying, Hey, the LTV is like five years</p>
<p>for an AOL, they were looking back at that number, not forward</p>
<p>with broadband coming. And so like, we can totally spend $300</p>
<p>on TV ads to get a dial up customer at 24 a month. And boy</p>
<p>did that whips on them. So listening to everybody talk</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;m just like, wow, keep your eye on the CAC folks, the</p>
<p>customer acquisition cost, how much you get, you spend to get a</p>
<p>new AOL, Netflix, or SAS product, or a Stripe customer is</p>
<p>critically important.</p>
<p>We look really closely at CAC payback, you know, how many</p>
<p>months does it take to, to pay back the cost of acquiring a</p>
<p>customer? We don&rsquo;t look at that exclusively, though, because,</p>
<p>you know, what expenses go into CAC is highly dependent on your</p>
<p>accounting</p>
<p>unpack that for a second, because there&rsquo;s the money you</p>
<p>spend on a Facebook ad, or a LinkedIn ad, or any other great</p>
<p>platform for driving, you know, customers to sign up for it.</p>
<p>Yes, you spend money on an ad, or you spend money on a</p>
<p>salesperson, obviously, that goes into CAC. But then what</p>
<p>about sales operation headcount? Does that go in? Is that offset</p>
<p>account? Or is that sales headcount? Is that customer</p>
<p>acquisition or something else? So there&rsquo;s a lot of like subtle</p>
<p>accounting decisions that can have a big impact on with</p>
<p>numbers that number? Well, this is why this is why I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>recommended just looking at burn multiple. What I really want to</p>
<p>know is, is how much money is this startup burning in relation</p>
<p>to how much revenue is adding? Just like the ratio of those two</p>
<p>things, because there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>burned 100. Yeah. So yeah, this month, we spent $300,000. And we</p>
<p>burned $100,000. And then we added $100,000 in new customers</p>
<p>ARR. So that&rsquo;s one x, so that you have on your chart here burn</p>
<p>multiple of one to 1.5, or under one is amazing or great. But if</p>
<p>you burn 200,000, and 100,000,</p>
<p>I warn founders going into this year, do not have a burn</p>
<p>multiple greater than two, because there&rsquo;s just so many</p>
<p>headwinds right now, that what happens is, if you end up</p>
<p>missing your revenue forecast, your burn multiple is going to</p>
<p>look terrible, we can shoot up to 345 and up. So it&rsquo;s better to</p>
<p>have some cushion by going into the year, being super efficient</p>
<p>on the converse side, Friedberg, if your lifetime value of a</p>
<p>customer is incorrect, which we&rsquo;re seeing now with people</p>
<p>canceling SAS products, or reducing the number of seats, or</p>
<p>in cloud computing, people are now saying, Hey, maybe I should</p>
<p>take myself out of the cloud and host my own servers or some of</p>
<p>my own servers and reducing their cloud bill. Cloud growth</p>
<p>is slowing at Azure, Azure, across the board. Amazon Web</p>
<p>Services, etc. The it&rsquo;s still growing, but it&rsquo;s slowing the</p>
<p>growth. So that LTV, if you get that wrong, that can whipsaw you</p>
<p>as well. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, LTV, which is like, what do you make over time</p>
<p>from a customer or however you want to assess it? A market</p>
<p>deployment? It should be on kind of net cash, meaning like how</p>
<p>much profit do I pull back into my bank accounts at the end of</p>
<p>the day, after paying third parties and internal people, and</p>
<p>where a lot of people, I think in models I&rsquo;ve seen on, you</p>
<p>know, what&rsquo;s the lifetime value of a customer, they kind of take</p>
<p>either revenue, or just the simplified gross profit number.</p>
<p>But the reality is, if you&rsquo;re scaling the number of engineers</p>
<p>you need, because you have many more customers, and you got</p>
<p>customer service calls, and you know, you&rsquo;ve got to do custom</p>
<p>deployments with your customers, all of that kind of</p>
<p>adds up to additional cost. And some of these businesses, you see</p>
<p>that the SAS companies, for example, that all have gotten</p>
<p>their multiples hammered, it&rsquo;s because the kind of microscope</p>
<p>has come out at this point, to some degree, set aside general</p>
<p>macroeconomic factors that are driving some of the multiple</p>
<p>compression. But as the microscope has come out, it</p>
<p>turns out that the efficiency of the business is not what everyone</p>
<p>hoped and dreamed a SAS business might be, that the efficiency of</p>
<p>the business maybe looks a little bit more like either a</p>
<p>services business, or there&rsquo;s a big kind of scaling hardware</p>
<p>component, that the margin that you actually make for every</p>
<p>dollar of revenue generate, fundamentally is smaller than,</p>
<p>you know, what you think it is, you have to add people to</p>
<p>support and ops and new servers and all the stuff you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>highlighting. And a lot of that&rsquo;s excluded. And then it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take, you don&rsquo;t realize all that, when you&rsquo;re small, or</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re medium and growing, you realize that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bigger, when you&rsquo;re bigger, you&rsquo;re like, Oh, wow, how do we</p>
<p>get these costs out? Well, if we cut these costs, customer</p>
<p>quality would decline, customers would churn, all this bad stuff</p>
<p>would happen. So yeah, that LTV number is generally not right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say, it&rsquo;s much more about kind of a true ROAC</p>
<p>calculation, which is how much capital am I deploying. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just being deployed in marketing dollars, it&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>deployed in other ways. And then how much capital am I making</p>
<p>back net profit over time. And I think that&rsquo;s the right way to</p>
<p>always analyze a business generally, but like,</p>
<p>particularly in businesses where it&rsquo;s easy to obfuscate either of</p>
<p>those numbers, and they could seem like it&rsquo;s an extraordinary</p>
<p>enough business, you can get hurt when you get bigger, or</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re scaling. And in a market like this, where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to go public, it&rsquo;s like, Whoa, that really hurt, you</p>
<p>know, so I think that&rsquo;s a lot of what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the other side of the table, Chamath, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been living through a zero interest rate hallucination.</p>
<p>Basically, people were growth, growth, growth, logo, logo,</p>
<p>logo, whatever. When they&rsquo;re making these bets, capital</p>
<p>allocators, now we&rsquo;re back to brass tacks. Okay, what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>margin? What&rsquo;s the lifetime value? And is this actually</p>
<p>real? Is there a real business here? Or is this just a grand</p>
<p>hallucination? That hallucination exists not only on the founder</p>
<p>side, but on the capital allocator side. This week, we</p>
<p>had a interesting semi viral thread on Twitter, somebody</p>
<p>named Tyler tringas. He&rsquo;s an early stage investor, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know who that is. But he did a thread predicting a 16 z just to</p>
<p>pick out one firm was a zero interest rate phenomenon, and an</p>
<p>incredible machine to accumulate a UM assets under management.</p>
<p>And so what were your thoughts just writ large on the capital</p>
<p>allocator side of this grand hallucination of zero interest</p>
<p>rates?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a little unfair. I think this is written</p>
<p>more just to try to generate views and clicks, because, okay,</p>
<p>you have to see the underlying return data to really have a</p>
<p>sense of knowing is it? I think it&rsquo;s fair to say a couple of</p>
<p>things that there was probably two and a half or three years of</p>
<p>capital raised in the industry. That&rsquo;s going to get really put</p>
<p>under pressure. And the reason is that there is not a lot of</p>
<p>time diversity in that money, meaning people got it, and they</p>
<p>put it into the ground right away. And one of the principles</p>
<p>of having a more predictable return set of returns over time</p>
<p>is that you leverage time, right? So if you had $100, and</p>
<p>you wanted to have a diversified stream of returns, you&rsquo;re much</p>
<p>better off spending $1 a month for 100 months, versus $10 a</p>
<p>month for 10 months. So just that thing will cause a lot of</p>
<p>impact and headwinds for a lot of the capital in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>Then the other thing you have to keep in mind is that over many</p>
<p>cycles, where we&rsquo;ve had high rates and low rates and medium</p>
<p>rates, our industry typically returns $1 60 for every dollar</p>
<p>it raises. And that&rsquo;s over many cycles. And so if you believe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to revert to the mean, out of the trillion</p>
<p>dollars we&rsquo;ve raised, maybe we&rsquo;ll return 1.6 trillion. Now</p>
<p>that sounds good, except the problem is that 1.6 trillion is</p>
<p>marked at five and a half trillion. So you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to give back there&rsquo;s a lot of pain, you&rsquo;re gonna have to give</p>
<p>back a lot of paper profits in order to get back to that 1.6</p>
<p>and be okay with it. And the question is, what has happened</p>
<p>in decision making in the meantime, meaning how many</p>
<p>people did you hire? How many deals did you do that you</p>
<p>regret? And then how does it change your psychology and how</p>
<p>you treat the next investment that comes over the desk? Can</p>
<p>you separate yourself from these bad losses, and not be on tilt</p>
<p>and make a good decision?</p>
<p>So you had a terrible two day session, like Phil Helmuth did</p>
<p>last week losing $350,000. Can you play the next week, and not</p>
<p>be on tilt and start to build back your stack and make 30,000</p>
<p>a night for 10 nights or 10 of the next 20 set 15 sessions or</p>
<p>whatever it is? It&rsquo;s actually had a rebuttal or something you</p>
<p>wanted to add to this?</p>
<p>No, not really a rebuttal. I mean, look, I think if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be intellectually honest about it, I think that</p>
<p>2021 is going to be is going to likely be not a great vintage</p>
<p>for VC. Why? Because the valuations were just Yeah, the</p>
<p>valuations were just really high. They&rsquo;ve come down by what</p>
<p>at least 50% on average, maybe more, more, maybe 50% now, but</p>
<p>you still have more medicine to take. I think when you look at</p>
<p>some of these companies are growing into their valuation.</p>
<p>Look, I think for any given set of companies for any portfolio,</p>
<p>the most important thing is what&rsquo;s in the portfolio. So if</p>
<p>in 2021, you had the founding of the next Google or whatever,</p>
<p>that effect is going to swamp the effect of price levels in</p>
<p>that year because of the power law. Again, the number one most</p>
<p>important thing is just what&rsquo;s in that portfolio, what&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>that basket. The second most important thing is the entry</p>
<p>prices. And obviously, if the entry prices are twice as high</p>
<p>in a given year than they are, and every other year and twice</p>
<p>as high as what the exit multiples are going to be in 10</p>
<p>years, when that portfolio becomes liquid, that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>hurt the returns, but we won&rsquo;t know which of these effects</p>
<p>predominates until five years from now, we see, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, when I saw that tweet thread, I thought, maybe this is</p>
<p>an issue for some venture firms, but we&rsquo;re not going to see even</p>
<p>the inklings of it for another five or seven years takes a</p>
<p>while. That&rsquo;s a problem that may manifest itself in year 10. And</p>
<p>between now and then any firm that it has a good track record</p>
<p>of returning capital, or frankly, has a good brand and</p>
<p>good marks will still raise an inordinate amount of money</p>
<p>because this is an asset class that I still think on the</p>
<p>margins is a more of a must have asset allocation than a on the</p>
<p>margins. I just rather ignore it because you know, it is the</p>
<p>future of how GDP will get created. And so everybody kind</p>
<p>of has to pay attention.</p>
<p>Imagine if in 2021, the you know, the next great mega</p>
<p>outcomes in AI were created, right, because those founders</p>
<p>were just slightly ahead of the curve, you know, they were like</p>
<p>a couple years out of the curve. If those create, you know, the</p>
<p>next, whatever trillion dollar companies, Google, Apple, then</p>
<p>the fact that price levels were to x, what they should have</p>
<p>been won&rsquo;t matter. What will really matter is the</p>
<p>distribution, there&rsquo;ll be a bunch of bad portfolios, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be some really incredible ones. And that&rsquo;s the way it always is</p>
<p>with venture.</p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is in 21 and 22 rates were still</p>
<p>effectively too low. And I think we did this analysis, Nick, you</p>
<p>can throw up that thing, but it&rsquo;s not correlated with big</p>
<p>outcomes, those vintage years. 2023 is the is the first vintage</p>
<p>year where we&rsquo;re actually starting to see high enough</p>
<p>rates that have historically generated that kind of return.</p>
<p>And so I do agree with you, David, I just think it&rsquo;s shifted</p>
<p>out by a couple years 2324 25. Those can be some real power law</p>
<p>years, I think, because we&rsquo;re going to have just based on what</p>
<p>the Fed is saying, five and a half percent interest rates for</p>
<p>the foreseeable future, which is, it&rsquo;s a huge, it&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>number of the risk. That&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what that is. You know what it is, though, Chamath,</p>
<p>I think to build on your point, and freeberg, I&rsquo;ll bring you in</p>
<p>on after this, it creates an environment in which discipline</p>
<p>on all sides of the table boards, management teams,</p>
<p>investors, rank and file, everybody has to be focused,</p>
<p>everybody has to have sharpened swords. And that little bit of</p>
<p>headwind is and the the ability to raise capital being harder is</p>
<p>building more reserve and more resilience and grit in this set</p>
<p>of founders. It&rsquo;s kind of like parenting, in a way like if you</p>
<p>are too permissive, you give too many options. Kids aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>disciplined. And now this group of entrepreneurs I&rsquo;m seeing who</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t given up, my Lord, are they becoming animals in terms</p>
<p>of like pure samurai, in terms of how they&rsquo;re running these</p>
<p>businesses, anything that&rsquo;s not efficient projects that were the</p>
<p>third or fourth most important project, cut, cut, cut. Now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking them 18 months, freeberg to maybe get discipline. But</p>
<p>maybe you could speak to the next three years and the</p>
<p>opportunity for investing in this cohort, because man, that</p>
<p>last cohort is going to be really, really challenged. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll probably do 6% returns, just like your money market</p>
<p>account can do right now five or six or what bonds can do. But</p>
<p>this next group, man, we&rsquo;re seeing dogged entrepreneurs who</p>
<p>are focused on reality. And there is no hallucination now</p>
<p>that this is going to be easy. There is no grand delusion here.</p>
<p>What are you seeing in the market?</p>
<p>If the market average return in venture in early stage</p>
<p>investing is going to be 6%. Remember, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not evenly</p>
<p>distributed. So you know, 80% of funds could end up having net</p>
<p>negative real returns, and 20% make money and then those</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a very few that will make real money. And you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the nature of having, you know, a very kind of low average</p>
<p>return on the industry is there may be a lot of wipeouts on the</p>
<p>investor class. Folks that have only had one or two funds and</p>
<p>then just got blown up in the cycle. I think that there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>groups of companies out there. One is companies that obviously</p>
<p>have been funded and are doing stuff and are active businesses.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve raised money in the past. And that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be really ugly times. I&rsquo;ve mentioned this in the past,</p>
<p>but I do think that there&rsquo;s a significant number of these</p>
<p>companies that if they were to be truly valued on first</p>
<p>principles in private markets today, they&rsquo;ll get valued as at</p>
<p>a value that&rsquo;s less than their preferred equity, which means</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a difficult restructuring needed in the</p>
<p>company. And not everyone&rsquo;s going to be willing to embrace</p>
<p>that. So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to trigger a lot of the wipeouts in</p>
<p>the market. It&rsquo;s not like the businesses are valueless. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that the capital structure makes it difficult to refund them to</p>
<p>fund them and continue their operations. Now for all the new</p>
<p>businesses, as you highlight, man, there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>extraordinary leverage out there. You know, left and right. I</p>
<p>think we talked about this maybe a year ago, that there was a big</p>
<p>bubble coming in AI. But I mean, left and right in nearly every</p>
<p>market every segment, you won&rsquo;t see a pitch deck that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have those two letters in it. Right? I mean, I&rsquo;m sure you guys</p>
<p>find it. It does feel it is. It is hard, not to feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a little bit of a lemming if you buy into the AI stuff. But I</p>
<p>will say that the use cases we&rsquo;re seeing are really</p>
<p>incredible. Totally. I didn&rsquo;t feel this way with the last</p>
<p>couple of waves, like the whole web three thing never totally</p>
<p>made sense. And crypto always felt a little bit speculative,</p>
<p>like kind of unsure. But the AI thing seems like it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>deliver real value. And I&rsquo;m seeing like already three major</p>
<p>enterprise use cases. Number one is just auto summaries, like</p>
<p>being able to summarize very quickly 1000 articles or a</p>
<p>meeting, you know, spitting out a like a summary of what just</p>
<p>happened in a meeting. And it could break it down between a</p>
<p>recap and action items. It just does all the work for you.</p>
<p>Second thing is like in app customer service, kind of like a</p>
<p>co pilot, but there&rsquo;s no reason to contact customer support</p>
<p>anymore. Because you can just ask the AI inside the app. And</p>
<p>like, why would you get it right? And they&rsquo;ll be faster,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s something where it&rsquo;s so narrow sacks. Yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get it right. It&rsquo;s like a power user who&rsquo;s sitting next</p>
<p>to you. It&rsquo;s your co pilot and is making you much more</p>
<p>effective in the app. And then the third thing we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>seeing is auto complete for everything. I mean, it is like</p>
<p>bonkers. How you know how you get like little type of</p>
<p>suggestions in email. Yeah, it&rsquo;s like two or three words. The AI</p>
<p>is gonna be able to do type ahead for any content type</p>
<p>paragraphs to do lists tables. It&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s bonkers. You see</p>
<p>it in Google, you see it in Google Sheets. Now, like if you</p>
<p>type, you know, equal sum, it&rsquo;s like, oh, here&rsquo;s what the seven</p>
<p>most likely things to happen next are, in which case, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like you use the chess.com app. I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve used it with like the heads up display, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>showing you the different moves. And this is a book move versus</p>
<p>this is not a book. Let me make a prediction all of the things</p>
<p>that you guys said, I think are incredible consumer surplus</p>
<p>business opportunities, which means that the ultimate winner</p>
<p>is us. And we&rsquo;re going to become, as you said, for the</p>
<p>visa consumer, another consumer, incredibly, incredibly</p>
<p>productive, and more leveraged in how we spend our time, which</p>
<p>will allow us to do all kinds of other interesting things with</p>
<p>all the time that we save. That I think is almost now a</p>
<p>certainty. The problem with consumer surplus businesses is</p>
<p>oftentimes, there is no money made in the funding of them. And</p>
<p>really, where the money is made is in enabling it. So for</p>
<p>example, so far, what I would say is, there&rsquo;s very little</p>
<p>money that has been made in AI. There&rsquo;s been an enormous amount</p>
<p>of money that&rsquo;s been made by Nvidia. And the reason is</p>
<p>because they are the pick and shovel provider and into the</p>
<p>industry. And so as that&rsquo;s an example, AMD, I think can also</p>
<p>benefit. So the silicon players seem pretty obvious here. Maybe</p>
<p>some of the cloud players, the problem is the cloud players are</p>
<p>trapped inside of other big companies with many other</p>
<p>business models. But I just want to put out there that I think</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;re right that the consumer 100% wins. But</p>
<p>economically, it&rsquo;s not clear to me that there is a winner that</p>
<p>is venture fundable. Well, hold on a second. Yeah, the Levi</p>
<p>Strauss is of the world right in the gold rush. The people that</p>
<p>made the picks and shovels in the jeans are sure to make</p>
<p>money. Yeah. And the people that pan for gold is much more</p>
<p>speculative and harder to see right now.</p>
<p>Yeah. So well, I think, I think you have a point that so I</p>
<p>mentioned three use cases, I think are killer use cases</p>
<p>already seen demos of today. And when you look at them, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, okay, this has real applicability. I mean, the AI is</p>
<p>going to be, it&rsquo;s going to powerfully change our work</p>
<p>lives. I&rsquo;m just focused on enterprise. So now I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who benefits economically from that, that functionality that I</p>
<p>mentioned, I think is likely to be pretty commoditized pretty</p>
<p>soon. But it&rsquo;s going to be incorporated into lots of</p>
<p>different apps in ways that are hard to predict right now. I</p>
<p>think that this AI revolution is going to do for SAS what mobile</p>
<p>did for, you know, a lot of the web 1.0 companies, where, like,</p>
<p>for a lot of these web one companies, they were either</p>
<p>disrupted by mobile, or they&rsquo;re turbocharged by mobile. So you</p>
<p>think about Facebook, it successfully made the</p>
<p>transition, and mobile made his business so much better, because</p>
<p>people are just using it a lot more on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>There were a lot of other businesses that just kind of</p>
<p>fell by the wayside, because they just couldn&rsquo;t make the</p>
<p>adaptation from desktop to mobile computing. I think AI is</p>
<p>going to be like that for SAS, where there&rsquo;s going to be a lot</p>
<p>of SAS products are just 100% right. Yeah, you&rsquo;re 100%. If you</p>
<p>can incorporate the AI into your SAS product, put in a co pilot,</p>
<p>put in auto complete and all sorts of other forms of value</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface of, you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>able to deliver so much more business value. But if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to do that, and somebody else can, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get disrupted.</p>
<p>Look at some of these enterprise spaces, like, take something</p>
<p>like APM, right, like application performance</p>
<p>management, that&rsquo;s an entire ecosystem of enterprise</p>
<p>companies, it&rsquo;s probably 10 15 $20 billion of collective</p>
<p>market cap. And I&rsquo;m just gonna say something not to not defend</p>
<p>anybody, but like that can mostly be automated by AI. Those</p>
<p>are simple heuristics that can be embedded in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely novel, where this code library just gets dropped</p>
<p>in, and all of this stuff happens relatively auto</p>
<p>magically now. So there are all kinds of other sectors, to your</p>
<p>point that get crushed, then the question is, who provides that</p>
<p>layer now for free in their existing SAS toolkit, or their</p>
<p>product that now all of a sudden, captures more value as a</p>
<p>result, and they can sell it for pennies, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incremental to them in terms of their margin in revenue.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, hardware wins. I think cloud wins big.</p>
<p>Because if you keep adding to these, you know, models, and</p>
<p>once 10 20% better, people are going to be willing to pay for</p>
<p>that. But then when you think about consumers, whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enterprise or actual consumers, I believe tomorrow, this stuff</p>
<p>is going to provide so much value, that people are going to</p>
<p>take their wallets out and be more than willing to spend for</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s more valuable than Netflix. I disagree. Okay, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take that side. But imagine you take your videos of</p>
<p>you learning to ski, and you put it into an AI coach, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, here&rsquo;s how to, and it just draws on it, here&rsquo;s how to</p>
<p>be a better skier, this is going to blow people&rsquo;s minds. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be more than willing to spend 25 bucks a month. I</p>
<p>disagree with that. And the reason is, because we&rsquo;ve spent</p>
<p>now two decades, and that&rsquo;s a lot of muscle memory to unwind</p>
<p>of people that have been consistently given more for</p>
<p>less. And I think that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the</p>
<p>expectations we&rsquo;ve all collectively created by</p>
<p>building software tools that have that inherent deflationary</p>
<p>aspect to them. And so I just think that it&rsquo;s going to, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very high, high bar, I still think there are subscription</p>
<p>services to be built. I don&rsquo;t disagree with you there, Jason,</p>
<p>I just think that in general, though, the de facto business</p>
<p>model that we&rsquo;ve created in tech is more for less. And we&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>technology to give us operating leverage to create margin</p>
<p>structures that other companies couldn&rsquo;t copy. And I still</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t. And I think that AI accelerates that not changes it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be the opposite. If you look at</p>
<p>Netflix, if you look at Disney, they&rsquo;ve been raising prices,</p>
<p>providing more value, I think that this is going to provide so</p>
<p>much value, that the incremental 10 bucks a month, five bucks a</p>
<p>month per employee is going to pay off so much that this could</p>
<p>be a slack, or like some presentation software, there are</p>
<p>a lot of people who are making PowerPoint, AI PowerPoints, where</p>
<p>it makes you a new deck, or a figma with AI, these things are</p>
<p>going to be so powerful, people are like, it&rsquo;s totally worth an</p>
<p>extra 100 bucks a month, because I can get rid of another</p>
<p>employee, this one employee can now do the work of three. Fuck</p>
<p>it, man, I&rsquo;ll give you $1,000. A really good</p>
<p>a model. If you just added the LTV of that software company is</p>
<p>going to make more money. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s deflationary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s deflationary. Okay, it&rsquo;s deflationary on the entire</p>
<p>economy. But that software company that figures out how you</p>
<p>can fire two accountants and keep one and make them as good</p>
<p>as, you know, three. Yeah, you&rsquo;re able to charge software,</p>
<p>right? You&rsquo;re selling consumer surplus. Okay, I think we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>agreement. Freeberg sold him a silence. You want to chime in on</p>
<p>this? You still with us? Southern silence. Technology</p>
<p>drives prices down.</p>
<p>Well, technology is about doing more with less, right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about doing more with less. And the AI helps you do so much more</p>
<p>with the same amount of time, or less time.</p>
<p>I think your whole point about Disney and Netflix, etc, is</p>
<p>because they aren&rsquo;t, you know, innovating on either sides. And</p>
<p>so in order to drive earnings growth, they&rsquo;re having to raise</p>
<p>prices. But that doesn&rsquo;t speak to the benefit of technology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re innovating massively, they&rsquo;re adding massive features</p>
<p>to their products and massive new shows. I mean, I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s pricing power in this AI thing. That&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>belief. I could be</p>
<p>thought about leverage. Yeah. I mean, like, I think I think your</p>
<p>point like, so my general rule of thumb, thumb on technology is</p>
<p>the technology creator, the technology company should</p>
<p>generally be capturing about one third of the value that they</p>
<p>deliver to the customer.</p>
<p>unpack that. Why? What do you come up with? And so</p>
<p>I mean, it just kind of where I&rsquo;m giving example. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, let&rsquo;s say that you, as a food delivery company, you</p>
<p>have to pay a human 10 bucks to deliver food from you. Now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I run a robot, my amortized cost of running that</p>
<p>robot is two bucks. So it&rsquo;s eight bucks cheaper, or call it</p>
<p>$1. So it&rsquo;s $9 cheaper, I should charge you four bucks. You know,</p>
<p>because four bucks is super competitive with the existing</p>
<p>market. And it&rsquo;ll keep me competitive against the other</p>
<p>automation companies that are going to start to emerge. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just kind of how market dynamics end up working out. If you</p>
<p>charge too much, you&rsquo;re going to invite people to come in and</p>
<p>compete with you. If your commodity technology</p>
<p>commoditizes, remember all technology commoditizes over</p>
<p>time. And if you don&rsquo;t charge enough, you&rsquo;re not going to make</p>
<p>enough money to be able to reinvest in scaling your</p>
<p>business and doing more kind of interesting things as a</p>
<p>platform. So you know, generally AI provides more leverage to</p>
<p>sexist point, if I can build an application, I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>guys have seen these incredible UI apps that are built in AI</p>
<p>now, where I can say, with a prompt, hey, we talked about it</p>
<p>two weeks ago, yeah, right, make me a dog walking app interface,</p>
<p>and it builds like the three steps of the dog walking app,</p>
<p>and gives you a bunch of options, and you can pick the</p>
<p>one you want, I would typically have to pay a design firm $50,000</p>
<p>to do that work for me. So if it&rsquo;d be AI is doing it</p>
<p>automatically, you know, I should be paying, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>$15,000 for that product for that capability, the margin on</p>
<p>that is 100%. Try 50 margins, right, whatever it is very low.</p>
<p>And the margin on that&rsquo;s 100%. Whereas the margin on paying</p>
<p>people to do design work as a design firm is very, you know,</p>
<p>not not a great margin, you&rsquo;re having to pay</p>
<p>you know why we&rsquo;re having, we&rsquo;re working it out in our heads</p>
<p>right now, one group of us is talking about comparing AI</p>
<p>software and AI services to the existing software stack. And on</p>
<p>the other side of the discussion, we&rsquo;re comparing it</p>
<p>to the humans who are currently doing that work. Imagine the 6%</p>
<p>that two brokers get, you know, doing the sale of a million</p>
<p>dollar home in that 60,000. And AI could negotiate that and find</p>
<p>you a better home and sell your home for the optimal price. For</p>
<p>less than that 60,000, what would you be willing to pay for</p>
<p>that? Right? And the same thing with the designer of the logo?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to play out exactly jk</p>
<p>out because to completely eliminate a job function, you</p>
<p>have to do you know, 100% of it. And you have to, you know, 100%</p>
<p>of the job function, as but as well as are better than the</p>
<p>human. Whereas, I think as opposed to a model where you</p>
<p>still have the human in the loop, but they&rsquo;re much more</p>
<p>productive, because they&rsquo;re working with an AI, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>augmented, they&rsquo;re the Iron Man, like model. So I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more effective. Yeah. So I think if there&rsquo;s a job reduction, it</p>
<p>would be more the case where they&rsquo;ve got a team of five</p>
<p>accountants, and they go to two or three, because now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just much more productive. I don&rsquo;t think they go to zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my sense. Anyway,</p>
<p>I look at outsourcing as a possible corollary to this.</p>
<p>Remember, when you move the accountants to Manila, where</p>
<p>their knowledge workers there and it knocked out half the</p>
<p>price, two thirds of the price, whatever it was, this just feels</p>
<p>like that, on steroids to me,</p>
<p>if you have a business model, like, you know, Infosys, or</p>
<p>Tata, or one of these things that&rsquo;s levered to utilization</p>
<p>rate, this is the most obvious way to basically add many,</p>
<p>potentially, percentage points, if not 10s of percentage points</p>
<p>of utilization to your business, that&rsquo;s all money, free</p>
<p>money for you, right? Because now you&rsquo;ll have fewer people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be more utilized, and they&rsquo;ll have more leverage</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be using a bot or some AI agent to help them</p>
<p>write code, write unit tests, all that typical stuff that</p>
<p>right now you outsource. And even if you pay a marginal cost,</p>
<p>you add the labor arbitrage to technology arbitrage. Now, all</p>
<p>of a sudden, these businesses look really, really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think customer support definitely gets</p>
<p>revolutionized, right? Because the initial no brainer, you</p>
<p>know, the first line of defense is going to be the AI using, you</p>
<p>know, text to voice, and it can choose what language it wants to</p>
<p>output to what accent. So you&rsquo;ll never know that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re talking to someone locally.</p>
<p>Literally, you&rsquo;ll be in 50 languages with the right answer.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need to build up that entire group. I mean, this</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re underestimating in some ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s gonna happen here. But my point is, I think</p>
<p>that a lot of that customer support inquiries just go away</p>
<p>because the help the assistant gets built into the tool</p>
<p>directly. So you never get to go. Yeah, like, why do you, you</p>
<p>know, if you can just ask it,</p>
<p>people do that right now on YouTube, if you just type the</p>
<p>question into YouTube, and you find the video that takes five</p>
<p>minutes, but you&rsquo;re saying this gonna take 15 seconds, X,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be right there.</p>
<p>I think what Zack said before is hugely important. When you think</p>
<p>about how AI touches non technology businesses, what he</p>
<p>said is the boundary condition, which I think is right, I think</p>
<p>he nailed this, which is the boundary condition for AI to</p>
<p>replace a human is where the threshold error rate of that AI</p>
<p>is the same or less than the human, right? If you look at</p>
<p>very complicated markets, where does regulatory capture rear its</p>
<p>ugly head, it&rsquo;s in allowing humans to be error prone, and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything about it. Take healthcare. If you go into</p>
<p>a hospital, there&rsquo;s a certain error rate in every surgery,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s a certain error rate in the things that happen.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably a whole bunch of ways in which that</p>
<p>entire infrastructure can be made much, much better with AI,</p>
<p>right, a robot that does laser guided precision surgery,</p>
<p>characterizing tumors 100 with 100% accuracy. So you always get</p>
<p>100% of the cancer out when you go and get surgeries done. All</p>
<p>these things are possible now. And all of a sudden, you take</p>
<p>these error rates that can be high as as high as 20 or 30%. So</p>
<p>for example, breast cancer surgeries, the dirty secret of</p>
<p>our healthcare industry is that has a 30% error rate, you know,</p>
<p>that can and should go to zero. And now all of a sudden, so</p>
<p>these highly regulated markets, I think, can become much, much</p>
<p>more efficient and, and leveraged and at pass that</p>
<p>consumer surplus on to people. In that case, it&rsquo;s healthfulness,</p>
<p>which I think is a big deal. I didn&rsquo;t mind. So interesting. I</p>
<p>do have a scan. Yeah, incredible. I mean, I got all</p>
<p>the videos, I got all the loops. I went to the one down on El</p>
<p>Camino Real. It was like going to a spa in and out, no big</p>
<p>deal. But I got the results. And it&rsquo;s like, Oh, here, here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tiny of little things that are not worth cutting your body</p>
<p>open to look at. But just so you know, your knee, your shoulder,</p>
<p>your kidney, there&rsquo;s a little polyp here, there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>polyp here, whatever, there&rsquo;s a little growth here. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see in two or three years, just monitor it. And I&rsquo;m like, Oh my</p>
<p>god, I&rsquo;m so grateful. This thing gets down to like 500 bucks,</p>
<p>which it obviously will or 1000 bucks, and everybody&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>and that all that data is in there. And then the AI is</p>
<p>looking at it, like you&rsquo;re saying, I mean, the early</p>
<p>detection, was he able to tell the doctor how full of shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re? No, you know, you&rsquo;re not supposed to eat for four hours.</p>
<p>So they, they didn&rsquo;t get an accurate reading on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your cold oven, everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, here&rsquo;s a really important clip for founders.</p>
<p>Play the Steve Jobs clip.</p>
<p>This is super important when looking at web three versus AI</p>
<p>to sax&rsquo;s point, you&rsquo;ve got to start with the customer</p>
<p>experience and work backwards to the technology. You can&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>with the technology and try to figure out where you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>try to sell it. And I&rsquo;ve made this mistake probably more than</p>
<p>anybody else in this room. And I&rsquo;ve got the scar tissue to</p>
<p>prove it. And I know that it&rsquo;s the case. And as we have tried</p>
<p>to come up with a strategy, and a vision for Apple, it started</p>
<p>with what incredible benefits can we give to the customer?</p>
<p>Where can we take the customer? Not, not starting with, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sit down with the engineers and, and figure out what awesome</p>
<p>technology we have, and then how are we going to market that? And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right path to take.</p>
<p>Can I ask you guys a question? I sometimes I go down these rabbit</p>
<p>holes, I&rsquo;ll watch hours and hours of Steve Jobs clips. What</p>
<p>do you think makes him so calm? Doesn&rsquo;t he just strike you as</p>
<p>incredibly just like calm and like comfortable with himself</p>
<p>and just aware? I know what it is. What is it was so much</p>
<p>better. And aesthetically building product than anybody</p>
<p>else. He when you think of that PC era of no taste, beige boxes,</p>
<p>and everybody having no style, and just no swagger. He was</p>
<p>studying, you know, German design, Buddhism, tripping on</p>
<p>acid, and like just understanding the universe at a</p>
<p>level that Gates and the other contemporaries weren&rsquo;t, they just</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t as transcendent in understanding product design as</p>
<p>he was. So it was like when you were saying you were playing</p>
<p>poker with a bunch of four year olds or something. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>analogy. He&rsquo;s just on such a different level that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching people make, you know, as 400. And, you know, IBM, PS,</p>
<p>whatever, like, just garbage computers, garbage operating</p>
<p>systems. And it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>the thing is, like, if you look at any era, just the way that he</p>
<p>communicates, there&rsquo;s just a level of calm. I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to describe it. So you understand what I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>say? Like, he, he just seems like he just sees through all</p>
<p>the noise, like he&rsquo;s seen through the matrix, like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unplugged himself.</p>
<p>Sax is unimpressed. Okay, they have</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m very impressed with Steve Jobs. I think he</p>
<p>understood product development better than anybody else. Yeah.</p>
<p>Clearly, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, my favorite Steve Jobs passage is the one where he</p>
<p>describes the john Scully disease. Do you guys remember</p>
<p>this? Yeah,</p>
<p>no. Oh, here it is. You know, one of the things that really</p>
<p>hurt Apple was after I left john Scully got a very serious</p>
<p>disease. It&rsquo;s the disease of thinking that a really great</p>
<p>idea is 90% of the work. And if you just tell all these other</p>
<p>people, here&rsquo;s this great idea, then of course, you can go off</p>
<p>and make it happen. And the problem with that is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a</p>
<p>great idea and a great product. Yeah. So true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I tell people it&rsquo;s like a rugby scrum. You go, you</p>
<p>know, you got to get a whole team to get the ball down the</p>
<p>field. It&rsquo;s not like one person put the ball down the field,</p>
<p>you know, they kind of maybe suggested a play. But once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the field, everything changes. And everyone&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in getting it down the field.</p>
<p>That quotes where the name for craft ventures come from.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Oh, little known fact. Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Section 230. We talked about last week, the Gonzalez</p>
<p>versus Google case, the justices heard oral arguments and</p>
<p>plaintiffs seem to fare poorly, quote from SCOTUS blog justice.</p>
<p>Elena Hagan suggests that even if section 230 is not well</p>
<p>suited to address the current needs of today&rsquo;s internet, such</p>
<p>as such a task was best left, as we predicted. Last week, I</p>
<p>think sacks you did best left to Congress rather than the Supreme</p>
<p>Court. Quote, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the</p>
<p>internet. Kagan observes actual thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is just, I think, really a quick update to</p>
<p>what we talked about last week, the justice heard oral</p>
<p>arguments, they seem to be very skeptical of the plaintiffs</p>
<p>arguments. Even Justice Thomas, who has written the most</p>
<p>skeptically in recent years about the broad immunity that</p>
<p>tech companies enjoy under section 230, seem surprisingly</p>
<p>sympathetic to the theory that the Ninth Circuit Court ruled on,</p>
<p>which is that section 230 protects recommendations, as</p>
<p>long as the providers algorithm treats content on its website</p>
<p>similarly. So even the justice who I think was most likely to</p>
<p>reign in 230 seem to be more comfortable with what the</p>
<p>defendant, which was Google was saying. So it looks to me like</p>
<p>Google and big tech are going to win this one.</p>
<p>Any thoughts to me?</p>
<p>No, not really. I think I want to know what you guys think</p>
<p>about Trump showing up with Big Macs and water in East</p>
<p>Palestine. I mean, he is a genius. He beat Buddha judge to</p>
<p>East Palestine. Yeah, that was</p>
<p>unbelievably pull up my tweet. I think this is the power we</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t we because Trump has been out of the public discourse. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a media. He is a media savant. Literally, Biden is in Ukraine,</p>
<p>saber rattling over air sirens that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>They were fake. Who cares? Anyway? Well, no, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter. No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. No, we don&rsquo;t know. So we do we</p>
<p>do actually. Okay, because I don&rsquo;t need to be on a second. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to be there because Jake Sullivan just being a press</p>
<p>conference, and he was asked by a CBS News reporter, if the US</p>
<p>gave the Russians any kind of heads up that the President was</p>
<p>going to be in Kiev. And what Sullivan said, and I quote is,</p>
<p>we did notify the Russians that President Biden will be traveling</p>
<p>to Kiev. We did so some hours before his departure for</p>
<p>deconfliction purposes. You know what deep confliction is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the US tries to avoid an accidental conflict. And you</p>
<p>know, Putin&rsquo;s not crazy enough to try and assassinate Biden. So</p>
<p>the Russians were not attacking Kiev that day. In fact, they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t attacked Kiev as far as I know, for weeks. So these air</p>
<p>raid sirens were basically just pure theater. But the amazing</p>
<p>thing is, if you don&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t know that Biden</p>
<p>orchestrated is my point people on your side. Come on, Jason.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean Biden press the button. So don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t also</p>
<p>take it to the other extreme. It was either who knows who went</p>
<p>who why the siren went off, but put it aside. This was a joint</p>
<p>event between the Biden administration and the Zelensky</p>
<p>team. They organized it. The whole thing was choreographed.</p>
<p>How do you how did that red carpet get there? Jason? Was</p>
<p>that an accident to?</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s put that aside.</p>
<p>accidental. I mean, how</p>
<p>let me give you your GOP. Let me give you your GOP win. Donald</p>
<p>Trump is a savant. And he went to America to the place that we</p>
<p>were reporting on the under reported story. People in East</p>
<p>Palestine are being ignored. And he comes there to help the</p>
<p>people of America. I give you all credit. Your guy sacks did</p>
<p>the most amazing media move in history. He went to Middle</p>
<p>America where people are suffering as opposed to a war</p>
<p>that nobody wants to be in and spend all that money on we won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spend money. But we will go spend billions in Ukraine. Go.</p>
<p>All right. I don&rsquo;t know what this reminded me of. And you may</p>
<p>think this is a weird connection. But it reminded me</p>
<p>of the ending to the movie, boys in the hood. Do you remember</p>
<p>what happens at the end of that movie?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t seen it in years ago.</p>
<p>Okay, it was 30 years old. But ice cube, you know, plays this</p>
<p>character doughboy and his brother gets killed. Yep. And at</p>
<p>the very end of the movie, he gives this speech to Cuba</p>
<p>Gooding Jr. Where he says, you know, I turned on the TV. And</p>
<p>there was all this shit about violence in a foreign land. And</p>
<p>there was nothing on my brother getting killed all this stuff</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in foreign countries, nothing about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening here. And then I think the most memorable line</p>
<p>was, either they don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t show, or they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the hood. Right. So what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>is the people of East Palestine, Ohio are being engulfed in a</p>
<p>plume of carcinogens and toxins. And Biden is off right pursuing</p>
<p>this crusade in eastern Ukraine. And it&rsquo;s not just him. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>dish out to Mitch McConnell as well. Mitch McConnell was</p>
<p>neocons of our neocons. Yeah,</p>
<p>McConnell was on TV saying that the number one priority of the</p>
<p>United States right now is defeating Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not helping the people of Ohio. It is not securing the</p>
<p>border. It is not solving crime in our cities. It is not making</p>
<p>our schools better. It&rsquo;s running off and basically supporting</p>
<p>this war in Ukraine. So both these oxygen areas Biden and</p>
<p>McConnell both they either don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t show or they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care what is happening United States of America. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>genius. But it&rsquo;s not even genius. I mean, it&rsquo;s so obvious</p>
<p>that you go there. It&rsquo;s so obvious. Nobody wants to go</p>
<p>there. And Biden didn&rsquo;t go there. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>genius. It&rsquo;s obvious didn&rsquo;t go there. Where&rsquo;s the Sanders? He</p>
<p>should. He hasn&rsquo;t declared. Don&rsquo;t make a trip. I think the</p>
<p>most senior democratic person that went over there was Josh</p>
<p>Shapiro, who&rsquo;s the governor of Pennsylvania. He got there</p>
<p>before Buddha judge.</p>
<p>What is going on? And I mean, and this it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a never</p>
<p>ending war. And so, you know, this is if nobody wants to fight</p>
<p>a never ending war. This is, this is what got Bush in</p>
<p>trouble, right? Like this was the big critique is like, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending all this money over in the Middle East on these</p>
<p>conflicts.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re talking about Bush Senior. Yeah. So let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>contrast with Bush Senior. I think actually, it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>analogy. So the with Bush Senior Bush, actually, this is 1991. He</p>
<p>won the Iraq War. That was actually a stunning foreign</p>
<p>policy success. Because he actually didn&rsquo;t go too far. He</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go all the way on the road to Baghdad, the way that</p>
<p>his son, George W. Bush would creating an epic disaster. So</p>
<p>Bush 41 delivered a victory there, and he still lost</p>
<p>election. Why? Because he seemed out of touch. He wasn&rsquo;t focused</p>
<p>on domestic problems. The American people want an American</p>
<p>president to focus on American problems. And even if Biden</p>
<p>delivers some sort of victory in Ukraine, if he ignores these</p>
<p>festering problems at home, that he is, I think, vulnerable for</p>
<p>this reelection. But I think the truth of the matter is that</p>
<p>this war is going to turn out much worse than the Iraq War did</p>
<p>in 1991. Because in 91, we showed restraint, and we knew</p>
<p>what our vital interest was. And we kept our objectives limited.</p>
<p>And we kept the timetable very short. What is Biden doing here?</p>
<p>Biden won&rsquo;t tell us what the objective is just whatever the</p>
<p>Ukrainians want. He won&rsquo;t tell us what the timetable is. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically for as long as it takes. And then meanwhile, this</p>
<p>week, you had Kamala Harris go to the Munich summit, declaring</p>
<p>that the Russians are guilty of crimes against humanity, which</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that we could have assessed after the war.</p>
<p>Think about the incentives, you&rsquo;re now giving the Russian</p>
<p>leadership before we said that we just wanted them to leave.</p>
<p>When you accuse them of war crimes, it implies that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go chasing them all the way to Moscow, they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>want to end this war, when they can be put on trial at the Hague.</p>
<p>I mean, this is highly inflammatory. So, you know, this</p>
<p>thing is not going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the thing I didn&rsquo;t like about Biden&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>over there is just, he&rsquo;s escalating, escalating,</p>
<p>escalating, hey, that we have to stop Putin. I mean, which you</p>
<p>do, he did invade another country, he didn&rsquo;t cause three</p>
<p>or 400,000, Russians have died, according to reports, over 100,000</p>
<p>Ukrainians have died, according to votes, neither side is given</p>
<p>the accurate number, because they don&rsquo;t want to demoralize</p>
<p>their constituents. But the amount of suffering going on</p>
<p>here is extraordinary. And I think it should be the West who</p>
<p>is going, send McCrone, send somebody from Germany, send</p>
<p>some, you know, group of people to then go to Ukraine and work</p>
<p>this out. But you don&rsquo;t need to go on your saber rattling. It</p>
<p>was too much saber rattling for me. It is not a de escalation.</p>
<p>We need de escalation in these situations, not saber.</p>
<p>I agree with you, Jason. But, but Biden has really painted</p>
<p>himself into a corner here. Because before the war, he</p>
<p>refused to take NATO expansion off the table. He refused to</p>
<p>recognize the Russian interest in Crimea. And we gave no</p>
<p>support to the Minsk Accords, which would have given some</p>
<p>limited autonomy to the Russian speakers in the Donbass area. If</p>
<p>we had just done those three things, there would have been no</p>
<p>war. Biden refused to do that. He refuses to take expansion off</p>
<p>the table even today. So he has nothing to compromise with he is</p>
<p>dug in. And the problem we have now is that it&rsquo;s a loose, loose</p>
<p>scenario. If the Ukrainians keep doing poorly, because right now</p>
<p>it looks like they&rsquo;re on the back foot. What is the United</p>
<p>States going to do? We&rsquo;re going to let them lose this war? Or</p>
<p>are we going to keep giving them more aid and step in? It looks</p>
<p>to me like Biden now has invested his whole presidency in</p>
<p>this, and he can&rsquo;t just let them lose, which means more escalation</p>
<p>from us. And on the Russian side, if the Russians lose, then</p>
<p>they have an incentive to use nuclear weapons to rescue the</p>
<p>situation. So it seems to me that both scenarios here are</p>
<p>really bad. And we don&rsquo;t really have a good way out of this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for some sort of magical Goldilocks scenario</p>
<p>where the Russians sort of lose but not enough to use nukes. You</p>
<p>know, the administration has not given us a clear picture of what</p>
<p>victory looks like here. That&rsquo;s actually reasonably achievable</p>
<p>in a reasonable timeframe at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>What do we think? freeberg of Xi Jinping making overtures and</p>
<p>hey, maybe we should work towards peace. If you follow the</p>
<p>money, he wants cheap oil. He wants this thing to end and he</p>
<p>wants the West to be buying goods from China. The West wants</p>
<p>to sell a bunch of armaments. The military industrial complex</p>
<p>is absolutely in delight of replenishing all of these</p>
<p>weapons, perhaps a little cynical to follow the money</p>
<p>concept. But what was your take on the chessboard of Xi Jinping</p>
<p>is going to visit Putin before Biden does, and he wants to</p>
<p>build bridges and we want to saber rattle. What are your</p>
<p>thoughts? If anything,</p>
<p>he getting like, I mean, China buys energy from Russia today,</p>
<p>they buy oil on sale at a very cheap price. So if I&rsquo;m China, I</p>
<p>want this to last longer, don&rsquo;t I? Like, why would I want to end</p>
<p>this and then have Russia&rsquo;s markets open up? Because if</p>
<p>their markets open up the markets normalize to market</p>
<p>prices, right now they&rsquo;re getting a discount. So I think</p>
<p>yeah, they certainly don&rsquo;t want things to escalate. The question</p>
<p>is how quickly do they want them to de escalate? So I&rsquo;m China,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of probably playing a little bit of a, you know,</p>
<p>middle line here. I just, I obviously don&rsquo;t want to see a</p>
<p>big hot war. China&rsquo;s got its own domestic problems right now that</p>
<p>seem pretty significant, and existential and having access to</p>
<p>cheap energy seems like a benefit. Obviously, if there was</p>
<p>significant conflict and escalation of conflict, that</p>
<p>would be very bad from an economic perspective for China.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably somewhere in the middle, like a slow</p>
<p>resolution, let&rsquo;s say, I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, this is pure</p>
<p>speculation. This is just me,</p>
<p>Sachs, which mouth Europe isn&rsquo;t going to buy Putin&rsquo;s oil anytime</p>
<p>soon, right? They&rsquo;re now going to</p>
<p>know that he&rsquo;s able to sell it to China, he&rsquo;s able to sell to</p>
<p>India and the rest of the world. There was actually an article in</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s New York Times about how the West may be unified about</p>
<p>Ukraine, but the rest of the world is not the article was</p>
<p>saying something that critics were said for a while, which is</p>
<p>we actually don&rsquo;t have the whole world with us at all. The BRICS</p>
<p>countries are not with us the emerging world, the whole</p>
<p>southern hemisphere, basically is not with us. They would like</p>
<p>the US to play a more constructive role in finding a</p>
<p>peace deal, not like you said, Jason saber rattling or</p>
<p>escalating. So the rest of the world is not happy with us. And</p>
<p>this is why the Russian sanctions have not been</p>
<p>effective. I think the Russian economies had like a three to 4%</p>
<p>hit, it is not the collapse that was predicted, because there are</p>
<p>enough other countries willing to do business with them.</p>
<p>Would this have happened to Martha Trump was president? And</p>
<p>how would Trump have handled it? Do you think just game theory</p>
<p>here? I&rsquo;m just curious. Because Trump almost won, right? I mean,</p>
<p>if Trump had won, what would this look like? Would Putin have</p>
<p>gone in there if Trump was president? And how would Trump</p>
<p>have handled it? Because Trump seems to think I would have just</p>
<p>told him don&rsquo;t do this, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the most obvious compliment I can give him. I</p>
<p>think that he is exceptionally pragmatic on being anti war. And</p>
<p>I think that that is one of the most positive characteristics</p>
<p>that he showed he was really the only president, I think, in</p>
<p>modern history, right, sexy poo that hasn&rsquo;t gotten us embroiled</p>
<p>in a new new wars. Yeah, it is the best part of him. Yeah, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been incredibly, incredibly consistent. So I suspect that</p>
<p>there would have been some kind of a deal. I know that sounds so</p>
<p>ridiculous to say, but there would have been a deal.</p>
<p>I actually agree. He&rsquo;s a dealmaker. He&rsquo;s a Jason, he</p>
<p>came to North Korea, he went to North Korea and met with he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>shake hands with anybody. Exactly. He would have fired all</p>
<p>of the deep state blob that started to position anything</p>
<p>towards a conflict. So I think he would have shut the door so</p>
<p>ferociously on Ukraine and NATO, and anybody that crossed that</p>
<p>line, he would have tarred and feathered publicly. And I think</p>
<p>the end result would have been that Putin could have found an</p>
<p>off ramp well before he invaded. Probably.</p>
<p>Totally. Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>And Trump blamed Germany for all this, right? He called it.</p>
<p>Well, Trump very early, asked the question, why are we</p>
<p>spending all this money to defend Germany when Germany has</p>
<p>this big pipeline deal with Russia, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>they need our protection, they should just pay for it</p>
<p>themselves. But I think there&rsquo;s a separate point that you must</p>
<p>just made that is a really good point, which is Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>instinctual resistance to what the deep state wants. And he</p>
<p>actually said it this week, he gave a two minute televised</p>
<p>statement that was all over Twitter, where he basically made</p>
<p>the argument that listen, the reason why we&rsquo;re in this war is</p>
<p>because the military industrial complex and the foreign policy</p>
<p>establishment, they basically courted this conflict, and they</p>
<p>are working at odds with the interest of the American people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fairly radical critique, I don&rsquo;t think a major</p>
<p>presidential candidate has run against the military industrial</p>
<p>complex, the way that he is now positioning himself. And let me</p>
<p>tell you this, you know, I&rsquo;ve said it before, he&rsquo;s not my</p>
<p>preferred candidate. But if this war spirals out of control,</p>
<p>either, you know, it turns into a even bigger conflict that</p>
<p>draws us in, or it turns into a big recession, because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve seen the last of the supply shocks from this war. If</p>
<p>we get a recession that Trump can, I think, lay at the feet of</p>
<p>this war, he&rsquo;s positioning himself to take advantage, this</p>
<p>could be a silver bullet for him. I don&rsquo;t think he has any</p>
<p>other way of winning. But, you know, if this turns into a big</p>
<p>mess, Trump is</p>
<p>positioning hat sacks, you have your tinfoil hat there. Put it</p>
<p>on for a second. I want to talk to tinfoil sacks, tinfoil hat</p>
<p>sacks. Let&rsquo;s put them the tinfoil hats on here. Do you</p>
<p>think Putin is escalating this as a way to position Trump to</p>
<p>where Putin says he could say this during the election, like,</p>
<p>listen, you know, I would love to talk to Trump. And what if</p>
<p>Trump goes and talks to Putin, or does a phone call with him?</p>
<p>Because I know that&rsquo;s against the rules, right?</p>
<p>So let me understand your theory. So wait, so your theory</p>
<p>is that Putin is going to</p>
<p>sacks theory.</p>
<p>Okay, so so your theory is that Putin&rsquo;s escalating this into</p>
<p>potentially a nuclear war to get Trump reelected. That&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>theory. And I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>Trump is favorable to him. I&rsquo;m just tinfoil hatting it. The</p>
<p>reason that this has occurred. No, no, now that this has</p>
<p>occurred, not that he did. He did.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one in tinfoil hat territory,</p>
<p>tinfoil hat corner at the end. Putin, the reason why he started</p>
<p>the war for it that he would end the war to give Trump a win.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s he going to end the war for Trump? What are you talking</p>
<p>about? During the election? He&rsquo;s he does a call with Trump. And</p>
<p>he says, you know, I talked to Trump about this. And I&rsquo;d love</p>
<p>to do some negotiations with Trump. I&rsquo;ve always had</p>
<p>appreciation for his ability to help negotiate things I would</p>
<p>love I would feel better about negotiating with Trump, who</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t saber rattled and told everybody in the world that I</p>
<p>have to be that there isn&rsquo;t regime change. So</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really interesting how you come up with these</p>
<p>conspiracy theories, and then attribute them to me and called</p>
<p>me the tinfoil hat guy. But</p>
<p>I know, you just said this is a silver bullet.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a silver bullet.</p>
<p>rails. Yeah, if this war is off the rails, and the economy goes</p>
<p>off the rails, because of this war, he Trump right now is</p>
<p>positioning himself to take advantage of that fact. And</p>
<p>DeSantis is to play right into his hands as a pacifist,</p>
<p>critical things about the war skeptical, I would say things</p>
<p>about the war this week. So it&rsquo;s not just Trump. But look, the</p>
<p>thing you have to understand about this war is existential</p>
<p>for Putin is existential at this. Yes, he cannot back off</p>
<p>extra. And it&rsquo;s extracurricular for us. Yeah, yeah. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why Obama said back in 2014, that the Russians have</p>
<p>escalatory dominance, they will always climb the escalatory</p>
<p>ladder all the way up to nukes if they have to. And the sooner</p>
<p>we recognize that fact that better off we&rsquo;re going to be, I</p>
<p>think the good news is that we are speech that he did, where he</p>
<p>kind of see the speech. Was it good? We just talked about it.</p>
<p>It was two minutes. It was fabulous. Sachs just mentioned</p>
<p>it. The crazy thing is, it sounded a lot like we&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>talking on this podcast, which is he talked about all these</p>
<p>generals that retire Victoria Nuland. He mentioned Victoria</p>
<p>Nuland by name by name by name. He, he really did explain to the</p>
<p>audience this because I didn&rsquo;t see this because I&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>different time zone. And it was it must have broken when I was</p>
<p>asleep or sleep. Well, it&rsquo;s a two minute video in which he</p>
<p>like I said, he attacked the military industrial complex and</p>
<p>foreign policy establishment for creating this war. And he</p>
<p>mentioned Victoria Nuland by name, let me tell you something</p>
<p>Newland is going to be it&rsquo;s going to be a very popular</p>
<p>message. But yes, it&rsquo;s very popular. Newland is the Fauci of</p>
<p>this situation. Okay. The same way that Fauci was supposed to</p>
<p>be protecting us go on viruses, and then find a function</p>
<p>research. Victoria. Now we got a label. Let me tell you,</p>
<p>misinformation. Victoria Nuland was supposed to be our chief</p>
<p>diplomat with respect to Russia and Eastern Europe. And what did</p>
<p>she do? Instead, she ginned up this conflict. How he ended up</p>
<p>we backed in insurrection in Ukraine in 2014. Jason, if you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like the insurrection of January six, let me tell you,</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t going to like the insurrection that she staged in</p>
<p>Ukraine. Because they brought in these Ukrainian far right</p>
<p>nationalists as the muscle. And that is what we also bring</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>Bring Big Macs. Did he bring Big Macs with him? Did you say he</p>
<p>brought Big Macs to East Palestine? He brought fast food</p>
<p>to them? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re showing up with</p>
<p>bigger ignoring what SAC said. But no, no, I got it. I am not</p>
<p>disagreeing with him. I think if you want to</p>
<p>never been conflict. Nobody wants to be in a forever war.</p>
<p>Yeah. But let me explain why he mentioned Victoria Newland. He</p>
<p>mentioned her because she was the State Department official</p>
<p>who was responsible for backing this insurrection of a</p>
<p>democratically elected leader in Ukraine in 2014, named</p>
<p>Yanukovych. Okay, Yanukovych was trying to was doing a balancing</p>
<p>act between Ukrainian nationalists and Russia. And it</p>
<p>was a very delicate balancing act. And we basically toppled</p>
<p>him. And ever since then, the relations with the Russians over</p>
<p>Ukraine have been headed south. If you&rsquo;re wondering why Putin</p>
<p>sees Crimea, it was in direct retaliation for the coup that we</p>
<p>backed in Ukraine in 2014. This is the origin of the conflict.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you want to understand where this comes from,</p>
<p>you have to go back to this. And the fact that Trump&rsquo;s willing to</p>
<p>talk about is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>I think that the good news for us is I think that heading into</p>
<p>June and the debt fiasco that&rsquo;s looming, I think we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>and I think this will help a lot get distracted with domestic</p>
<p>issues in the sense that it&rsquo;ll take some heat off of</p>
<p>escalating</p>
<p>all of this foreign adventurism. You know, this is such a scene</p>
<p>like this is such a scene from wag the dog. Every time there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something inside the United States that we should really</p>
<p>focus on. We have this wag the dog moment where we get</p>
<p>distracted by some adventurism abroad, and we forget and we</p>
<p>lose sight. So we have this East Palestine thing right now. In</p>
<p>June, we&rsquo;re gonna have to come back to terms with this death</p>
<p>ceiling issue, which is a huge one, how we&rsquo;re going to resolve</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s not clear. Just this week, the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>basically said, Hey, folks, we&rsquo;re taking rates to five and</p>
<p>a half plus, and they&rsquo;re going to stay there. That seems like</p>
<p>no news. People just seem to digest it and move on. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really incredible how we just find we&rsquo;re like, what is it</p>
<p>Jason, the dog that chased the bumper and caught the car or</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, you caught the bumper. We got plenty of big problems here</p>
<p>in the United States plenty of big problems. And I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that wag the dog works anymore. Because I think the American</p>
<p>people want, like I said, they want an American president to</p>
<p>focus first and foremost on American problems. And even</p>
<p>remember, Bush senior in 91 won that war and still lost</p>
<p>reelection still lost. So I don&rsquo;t think wagging the dog</p>
<p>works anymore. It works for some short period of time, especially</p>
<p>while the media are portraying this point, the air raid</p>
<p>theater, that eventually the people smarten up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so right. So that issue, think about Bush, Bush came off</p>
<p>of the Persian Gulf War with like a 91 or 2% approval</p>
<p>rating. I mean, we&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. But he</p>
<p>violated a simple tenet of his domestic policy, which is read</p>
<p>my lips, no new taxes, boom, lost. And it was not even close</p>
<p>in the end. So I think you&rsquo;re right. I think people really</p>
<p>care about the economy. Go Nikki Haley</p>
<p>and do how much do how much debt do we want to go into over</p>
<p>foreign wars? The only thing I ever liked about Trump was his</p>
<p>policy of not starting wars and not getting into them. And</p>
<p>Americans want to focus on our balance. I&rsquo;m a balance sheet</p>
<p>voter right now I&rsquo;m voting based on who is going to be fiscally</p>
<p>responsible. I mean, free burger, the same boat here, I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve got to be real careful in how we handle China</p>
<p>because you had Blinken on all the Sunday shows basically</p>
<p>denouncing them expressing outrage that they might support</p>
<p>the Russians acting shock shock that they could do that. We</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have the ability anymore to understand that other</p>
<p>countries do things in their own interest. And we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>accept that. And instead, we act as if foreign policy should be</p>
<p>conducted according to this morality play that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>created. And if you don&rsquo;t do what we think is right, then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to express all this outrage and condemnation at you.</p>
<p>And somehow that&rsquo;s going to get you to violate your own</p>
<p>interests. That&rsquo;s not the way the world works. And what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing right now, we&rsquo;re doing right now is pushing China and</p>
<p>Russia together into a new axis block. This is very foolish,</p>
<p>very foolish, even during the Cold War. Okay, we work to keep</p>
<p>Russia and China apart. And whatever you think of those</p>
<p>regimes today, they were much worse back then. Remember, the</p>
<p>Soviets, you had a Stalinist regime, the Chinese had Mao,</p>
<p>those were the two of the three biggest mass murderers of the</p>
<p>20th century. And Nixon and Kissinger still went to China</p>
<p>and shook Mao&rsquo;s hand and toasted him because it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>keep China and the Soviet Union divided. And what are we doing</p>
<p>today, we are basically pushing them together. With all this</p>
<p>condemnation and outrage. It is not a smart strategy.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t disagree. We need to be building bridges with India.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key key relationship. And China. I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not figuring out what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is poisoning our relationship with India. India</p>
<p>is the biggest democracy in the world. And our relations with</p>
<p>them have gone south since this war, because they have a</p>
<p>friendship with Russia that goes</p>
<p>I mean, I would rather see Biden go to India and start building</p>
<p>some bridges there. Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>Jacob, how&rsquo;s your fundraising going for launch on four?</p>
<p>Thanks for asking. It&rsquo;s a great question. You know, we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that public 506 C public fundraising thing. And so I did</p>
<p>a bunch of webinars. And without doing a single in person</p>
<p>meeting $51 million in requests came in, just, you know, to a</p>
<p>type form, basically a form online. And now we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be starting in the next month after I get back from Japan,</p>
<p>actually meeting with the, you know, big LPs in the world, and</p>
<p>I want to make a trip to the Middle East and just go all</p>
<p>around the world and meet all the big funds. So thanks for</p>
<p>asking. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s gonna change everything. Yeah, good</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. You imagine $52 million in commitments before</p>
<p>actually doing the actual tour. That&rsquo;s awesome. Just out of the</p>
<p>gate. And my last one was 44. And so I think this 506 C, like</p>
<p>I can be public about the fact that we&rsquo;re raising a fund. And</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Well, congrats. And I have one question for you.</p>
<p>Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p>Can you be replaced with an AI?</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s greatest moderator? I mean, that&rsquo;s not gonna make</p>
<p>great jokes. Not for not for now. And oh, you know what, I</p>
<p>had an interesting point about management fees in these funds.</p>
<p>Just to circle back. Did you know, this is what I heard that</p>
<p>benchmark during that worst vintage, you know, after I think</p>
<p>the great financial crisis, or maybe it was the dot com was</p>
<p>either of those. They took their management fees, because that</p>
<p>fund was so you know, challenged. They deployed the</p>
<p>management fees into primary investing, or I&rsquo;m sorry, to</p>
<p>follow on investing on their winners to regain the results.</p>
<p>Can you imagine in this market, a VC who deployed capital in</p>
<p>2020 2021, saying, you know what, we&rsquo;ve got these management</p>
<p>fees millions of dollars in the future, to pay for managing</p>
<p>these instead of taking that money. I&rsquo;m going to put that</p>
<p>into your into the companies for my launch fund three month, I</p>
<p>had a couple of opportunities. And I was like, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take some of the management fees and invest in</p>
<p>some of those existing companies to try to goose the returns for</p>
<p>my LPS. And so we&rsquo;re at 104% or 103% invested in the capital,</p>
<p>just by just taking a couple 100 grand off of the management</p>
<p>fees. And I&rsquo;m like, well, this is a really interesting</p>
<p>strategy. Like, why am I playing for the management fees? Or am</p>
<p>I playing for the mic? I&rsquo;m paying for the mic, right? I</p>
<p>mean, you should be.</p>
<p>Jason, by the way, it&rsquo;s not true that the AI can&rsquo;t tell jokes.</p>
<p>Our friend, Billy tweeted how the AI told a joke in this the</p>
<p>style of Jerry Seinfeld, then he asked it to tell a joke in the</p>
<p>style of Dave Chappelle and it refused. So the AI can tell a</p>
<p>joke if it wants to. It&rsquo;s racist, but no only clean</p>
<p>jokes.</p>
<p>Oh, I see. It doesn&rsquo;t work blue.</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t think every I don&rsquo;t think Dave Chappelle has</p>
<p>to be blue. But it would not tell a joke about Dave</p>
<p>Chappelle blue. Wow. I mean, we got to get Sam. He&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>iconoclastic. Like he would be Sam would be in the are all in</p>
<p>52.</p>
<p>Well, by the way, actually, he&rsquo;s got a shot there. After our last</p>
<p>episode, in which we were raising concerns about the AI</p>
<p>bias, they published a blog post, saying that yes, the day</p>
<p>after, if bias has occurred, it is a bug, not a feature. And</p>
<p>they are trying to be even handed. So I&rsquo;m glad they have</p>
<p>that smart now it&rsquo;s that and that&rsquo;s their standard. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hold them to that standard. But I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>well, they have to be public. Like this. Yeah, I mean, I read</p>
<p>the blog post. It seemed reasonable. It&rsquo;s great. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>addressing it. And I also think they&rsquo;re now doing embedded</p>
<p>citation. So somebody tweeted at me after we had the whole</p>
<p>discussion about credit. And when they were doing facts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now saying, and they haven&rsquo;t made an announcement</p>
<p>about this yet. But they were saying, according to this</p>
<p>source, the following according to this source, so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to source in the copy that&rsquo;s being written. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big step. And then I was talking to Adam D&rsquo;Angelo, about</p>
<p>Poe, which is an amazing app, you should try it. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best one out there right now of all the chats. Poe is an app</p>
<p>based on the core data set. And I asked him questions about the</p>
<p>trip to Japan and the seco and this and that. And it was</p>
<p>extraordinary how well done the answer was with bullets. And</p>
<p>then I asked him online, Hey, what about citations back to the</p>
<p>original core questions? And he said, Yes, we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>adding that. So then I was thinking, wow, if you add to the</p>
<p>core corpus, and then they link back to your answer. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome. For me as a person who&rsquo;s answered hundreds of</p>
<p>questions on core to build my reputation. So I think Cora is,</p>
<p>for me, I think Cora is the could be the Google, I think</p>
<p>Cora&rsquo;s got a better data set. And if they play that right, I</p>
<p>think they could be better than chat GPT. And they said, you</p>
<p>have to get permission based on the Cora data set data set,</p>
<p>poet, it will answer questions like the best answers on core</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re saying? Yeah. That&rsquo;s kind of interesting is</p>
<p>using Cora as the primary data set. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s using the</p>
<p>rest of the web, too, and Wikipedia and everything. I</p>
<p>think I don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re calling it po I think they should</p>
<p>just do Cora chat bot or whatever. Yeah, but just try it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Po download it. You can use it today. You want to</p>
<p>know why I&rsquo;m excited about that? Because you got a little tasty</p>
<p>poo. You got a little slice, a little slice of Cora. Oh, good</p>
<p>for you. Well, I mean, Cora was always like, are they ever going</p>
<p>to make money? Or are they just going to build this incredible</p>
<p>data set and do nothing with it? Yeah. What did I say? I said, I</p>
<p>said AI is going to be to the to basically sass what mobile</p>
<p>was to have one. Oh, you&rsquo;ll either get disrupted or get</p>
<p>turbocharged by it. It&rsquo;s gonna be I think Cora is the number</p>
<p>one player in AI going forward. I know that sounds crazy. But the</p>
<p>fact that and I think Reddit also has this insane potential</p>
<p>if Reddit had a chatbot because think about how many times</p>
<p>people do a search, and YouTube is the other one where they say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best sci fi movie of the year or which directors make</p>
<p>the best screenplays or whatever, and then they put the</p>
<p>word Reddit at the end, or they put the word core at the end,</p>
<p>where they put the word YouTube at the end, to just narrow down</p>
<p>the corpus of where to find the answer. Go ahead. I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with you. I&rsquo;ve known D&rsquo;Angelo for 17 years now. Smart cat. He</p>
<p>was the CTO of Facebook when I worked there. The single</p>
<p>smartest and best single smartest person I worked with.</p>
<p>And then separately, one of the most absolute genuinely best</p>
<p>human beings in the world. Can we get him out? He does. He</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t. Is he not a good public speaker or something? Because I</p>
<p>never hear him talk. I&rsquo;d like to get him at all in summit.</p>
<p>Maybe Angela is just so superb on every dimension.</p>
<p>We should get him on actually, just because I didn&rsquo;t know he</p>
<p>was working in AI. He has a lot of interesting thoughts about,</p>
<p>you know, social networking platforms.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s on the board of opening. Okay. Oh, get him on</p>
<p>the pod. Or maybe you own summit. 2023. All right,</p>
<p>everybody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll definitely make the anti establishment list.</p>
<p>Definitely anti establishment. Yeah. Okay. So for the Sultan of</p>
<p>sneaking out, he left and the dictator. And what do you want</p>
<p>to be referred to now? pacifist, the peace pacifist,</p>
<p>peacemaker. You are the saxophist. I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>undisputed greatest moderator on the number one podcast in the</p>
<p>world for now until the AI replaces you. Yeah, I trained the</p>
<p>AI to replace your sacks. Ukraine, UK, UK, and Biden,</p>
<p>Biden, Biden. No, Nikki Haley. No, stop making Nikki Haley</p>
<p>happen. The end. The data set has been done. All right,</p>
<p>everybody. See you next time.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Love you. Queen of</p>
<p>besties are gone.</p>
<p>Dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension that</p>
<p>they just need to release.</p>
<p>We need to get</p>
