    <p>Humans are fascinated by violence and you&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself. Why is it the rash guard? Yes</p>
<p>And I talk so much shit that I&rsquo;m like man if I lose this is gonna be rough. You&rsquo;re learning this shut the fuck up</p>
<p>I got you man. You were powered by McDonald&rsquo;s and Coca Cola</p>
<p>I want more and then I expect them and he didn&rsquo;t want to fight anymore. I&rsquo;m not impressed by</p>
<p>if George st. Pierre and</p>
<p>And Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Here with three individuals each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective disciplines</p>
<p>The greatest MMA fighter of all time George st. Pierre the greatest martial arts coach of all time</p>
<p>John Donahue and</p>
<p>the greatest submission grappler of all time</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>So, let me ask the first question. You guys didn&rsquo;t see the question. No preparation here</p>
<p>What is the key to your success each of you one thing or multiple things that come to mind?</p>
<p>John go first</p>
<p>Is it the rash guard</p>
<p>Yes, I</p>
<p>I like that you choose John right off the bat. I seem the most nervous</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>Finding a way to work in</p>
<p>A world where most of the answers are already known</p>
<p>Okay, and in any developed sport by the time you enter that sport most of the basic precepts the</p>
<p>the the major techniques that the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>in a highly developed world</p>
<p>The key to success is to be able to identify</p>
<p>Some area of the industry that you&rsquo;re in which is currently undervalued</p>
<p>To do what the other people are not doing</p>
<p>deeper than that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Everyone has a view of okay. These are the the main skills of the industry. I work in</p>
<p>at any given time</p>
<p>some set of skills attributes</p>
<p>Will always be somewhat undervalued they&rsquo;re underappreciated by the people in the game</p>
<p>You see that at any in any given industry there are always trends which change</p>
<p>The nature of the industry over time so</p>
<p>fashion trends in the clothing industry, you&rsquo;ll see at any given time is a</p>
<p>General wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time</p>
<p>What makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say here is something which is genuinely</p>
<p>useful, but which is currently being underused underutilized and I want to bring that back in and</p>
<p>develop it and</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s an inherently useful product</p>
<p>It will be very very successful in its initial applications against people who aren&rsquo;t currently using it</p>
<p>If you can do this in whatever industry you&rsquo;re in I believe you&rsquo;ll be highly successful</p>
<p>successful to the supplies both for actual specific like techniques and</p>
<p>the also tactics as well in the case of</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu, so for example in my sport leg locks have always been around</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no shortage of people you can look back in history who applying leg locks</p>
<p>Nonetheless as in across the industry</p>
<p>Leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. There was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport</p>
<p>For most of the history of the sport of Jiu Jitsu tended to deemphasize leg locks and</p>
<p>When I looked at them I said there was immense potential but it wasn&rsquo;t being realized and needed to be changed</p>
<p>Since then that has more or less occurred now most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important</p>
<p>Aspect and they&rsquo;re no longer undervalued if anything it&rsquo;s gone too far the other way and now perhaps they&rsquo;re a little overvalued</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>this kind of</p>
<p>fashion trend exists in every industry and</p>
<p>The job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify</p>
<p>okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued and then</p>
<p>Look at what is their actual objective value and then work</p>
<p>To to to bring them back to the forefront. So John brought up fashion</p>
<p>George is wearing a really sexy shirt. So</p>
<p>Assuming that&rsquo;s not the reason is there</p>
<p>Is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career?</p>
<p>Well, of course everybody knows the famous and sort of every athletes are saying oh, it&rsquo;s could be genetic</p>
<p>I was maybe gifted that certain predisposition. I worked really hard</p>
<p>but I think</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t talk enough is when everybody sometime go, right? I</p>
<p>Was never afraid to try to go left and I felt many time trying to do things that were not</p>
<p>Known to be things that would bring me brought me success, but I tried it, you know</p>
<p>I was very often I was the first of trying new things and I felt many time but certain times</p>
<p>it gives me a certain advantage and</p>
<p>for example, I</p>
<p>was sometime fighting guys that add much better wrestling background and than me on paper and</p>
<p>nobody before that fought those guys never nobody had there to try to</p>
<p>Take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good and I didn&rsquo;t have on paper</p>
<p>the wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight, but when everybody</p>
<p>Tried to go right I was going left I fought them in a different way and that was</p>
<p>The blueprint to beat certain some of these guys, you know what I mean? You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yeah, so we&rsquo;ll actually talk about a few fights where that you did just that this is fascinating</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say at the high level so Gordon again sticking on fashion</p>
<p>I may compliment your incredible badass hat trying to fit in here</p>
<p>We should say we&rsquo;re in Texas now, so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Become a Texan overnight. So what is there something you can speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success?</p>
<p>yeah, so first of all, it has to be a role where you don&rsquo;t ask us all those same questions because</p>
<p>How am I supposed to compete with the answer? John just gave</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I can do that&rsquo;s gonna top that. Yeah, but uh, I think it&rsquo;s uh, there&rsquo;s many things</p>
<p>But I think the number one thing is just is John</p>
<p>When I came in, I was a blue belt and I was beating brown and black belts in competition already</p>
<p>But he really changed my way of thinking about the sport</p>
<p>I would just come in and if something wasn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>I would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively and that just degenerated me into a degenerated into me</p>
<p>spastically knee sliding into cross hashi garami against Eddie Cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is not working and Eddie like when I met him was like a chubby</p>
<p>Librarian looking guy and I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s no I&rsquo;m like six to like a jacked like 170 and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m losing to a guy who looks like this, but he just kept heel hooking me</p>
<p>So I would just go harder and harder and it wouldn&rsquo;t work and then John&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>If you learned leg locks, you might you might have some more success</p>
<p>And then I was like, yeah, that probably makes sense</p>
<p>And from then on I kind of just changed the way I thought about the sport instead of doing doing things harder</p>
<p>I would actually try to get better at jujitsu. Do you remember like a turning point where?</p>
<p>You became as opposed to being mediocre not just in technique but an approach to</p>
<p>To great. Um, I think it was somewhere around brown belt level when I was training consistently</p>
<p>So I trained full time with John when I was purple belt mid level purple belt and towards the end of my brown belt</p>
<p>Days, I was beating up like legitimate like ADCC champions in the gym. Um,</p>
<p>so I think like</p>
<p>Brown to black belt was a big thing for me</p>
<p>And then when I won my first EBI and I was I submitted Yuri who won ADCC and I beat roost them</p>
<p>Um, so I think that was like my turning point as a competitor</p>
<p>But I think I started to to reach world level a little bit before that</p>
<p>I think somewhere around brown belt mid level to late level brown belt</p>
<p>It was some of that mental like it was there a moment when you like after a training session you realize</p>
<p>I can actually do this</p>
<p>Like I could be at the top of the world world class</p>
<p>The critical moment for me was when I think it was right</p>
<p>Right when I got my black belt, maybe a few months before I got my black belt</p>
<p>we had a former ADCC champion come into the gym and</p>
<p>we did a hard round together and I think I submitted them like four or five times and</p>
<p>No one knew who I was. I never won anything up into that point and I was like, okay</p>
<p>Like if this is like one of the best guys in the world and I could submit him multiple times around</p>
<p>I think that this is like something that I actually could do professionally and make a make a career out of this</p>
<p>Okay. So the actual performance was the like you don&rsquo;t need to believe before you could perform like a lot of Olympic gold medalists</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>They have to believe before they can perform because like they&rsquo;re getting their ass kicked for a long long long time</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>I think but the best way for me to believe in something is to have</p>
<p>Repeated success doing it against high level guys</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not gonna just believe I can do a double leg if I can&rsquo;t a double leg on anybody</p>
<p>So for me the the belief came from the repeated success in the gym</p>
<p>Yeah, but to get to the point where you&rsquo;re submitting somebody like your ASMO is like one of the the greatest grapplers ever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a long journey</p>
<p>Yeah, but I had the confidence</p>
<p>I had the belief in myself because of the success that I had in the gym prior to that got it</p>
<p>Even and it&rsquo;s one step at a time first. It&rsquo;s the brown belts then it&rsquo;s the black belts and it&rsquo;s world class. Okay</p>
<p>George was there a turning point for you when you you thought like I can actually do this</p>
<p>Yes, I I always dreamed to become champion</p>
<p>but I think the turning point that there was that there was two turning point and</p>
<p>And there were my two losses</p>
<p>First my losses to Matt Hughes I went into that fight</p>
<p>Just to not lose I was not fighting to win and it&rsquo;s after the fight when I watched the</p>
<p>Replay of the fight. I realized I was like I was doing pretty well</p>
<p>But during the fight in my own mind, I was not seeing it that way</p>
<p>I I thought I was getting dominated by Hughes like a hundred percent, but when I watched the replay I</p>
<p>Was like man, I can I can beat this guy. I was beating him until I made that stupid mistake</p>
<p>so I was very frustrating but but I</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gave me the mentally the the championship level</p>
<p>mentality and then I became a little bit overconfident because I start beating everybody after that and</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Start to believe the hype of people when they look at me. They were like, oh, he&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>Upcoming superstar and he&rsquo;s gonna be unstoppable and and then when I became champion, I I</p>
<p>lost to to to Matt to Matt Sarah, so</p>
<p>before I believe</p>
<p>my first failure was because I had a lack of confidence and</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>My second failure was I was because I was overconfidence. So I think it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a perfect</p>
<p>Center of confidence. I mean, I mean it&rsquo;s good to be confident because John taught me like confidence</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like money in your bank account if you you can have all the skills in the world, right?</p>
<p>and and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the confidence, it&rsquo;s like you it&rsquo;s like you can you can be a millionaire?</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have access to your bank account. So it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a little bit the analogy that John told me</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I feel a confidence plays for Natalie but to be overconfident</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s always good to to be aware to be afraid of what can happen</p>
<p>So to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what mentally gave me the edge to become I believe successful in my sport playing off that</p>
<p>John gave me a speech one time and he was like you have to be able to</p>
<p>like flip a switch and turn it off where like a guy like Mayweather or someone who goes out who&rsquo;s super confident and</p>
<p>He plays the character of someone who&rsquo;s like no one can beat me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best that there ever was and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>But if you look at me actually trained very hard</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t play the persona of no one can beat me and have it translate into your life and just think that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>So good that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything and no one can ever beat you</p>
<p>You have to be able to play that public persona of no one can beat me</p>
<p>But then you have to actually do the training to make that happen</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just you can&rsquo;t believe your own hype and say say that you know, I can just do whatever I want</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s ever gonna beat me if the able to switch between the persona and the actual athlete and that made a big difference for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tough because</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re you you dominate such a large fraction of the world and</p>
<p>grappling and</p>
<p>The George to just the perfect dominance after those two</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for the confidence not to just</p>
<p>Like how do you avoid the confidence not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely</p>
<p>deludes your mind</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s just number one the guys in the gym are so tough</p>
<p>So the guys in the guys in the gym that I train with are always like nipping at my butt and always giving me new</p>
<p>New problems to solve and for me, it&rsquo;s really just about trying to learn new stuff over time</p>
<p>So that keeps it interesting for me and it&rsquo;s not really about</p>
<p>You know, no one could beat me I don&rsquo;t have to train or have to do it I could do whatever I want</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more what keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that I&rsquo;m learning new stuff all the time of working on something</p>
<p>new and progressing to new levels at all times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t just come in and do the same thing over and over again and</p>
<p>That gets boring you just come in and you don&rsquo;t learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time</p>
<p>And okay, okay</p>
<p>This is boring</p>
<p>But when you have new stuff to work on and new goals short term and long term goals to reach then it makes it interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s a little bit like Gordon says is the fear because sometime in the gym even before I when it was competing</p>
<p>I was I was getting my butt kicked</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t care what happened in the gym</p>
<p>I mean it hit my ego, of course because I&rsquo;m a proud person I&rsquo;m a competitor even in the gym</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a malicious competition competition in between each other when you fight you have to be malicious you go there to hurt the</p>
<p>guy</p>
<p>but it it hit it hit me in terms of my pride when I get</p>
<p>beat in a gym, of course, but</p>
<p>that fear</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t want it to happen in public</p>
<p>especially not during a fight that what keeps help me keeps the balance between confidence and and and and fear</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? It&rsquo;s kind of weird. It&rsquo;s a mix</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mixture of both that I believe I to me</p>
<p>Help me</p>
<p>Succeed to have the right mindset to fight and I talk so much shit that I&rsquo;m like man if I lose this</p>
<p>This is gonna be rough. So yeah, you put a lot of I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the hard thing to do when you talk shit when you when you play the heel is</p>
<p>Is so massive perform. He&rsquo;s the pressure is I mean you have to be good under pressure</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Conor McGregor thing, you know, the reason I actually started talking shit was actually like indirectly because of George</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>Because I will become the opposite of George</p>
<p>I won I won my first DBI and I I didn&rsquo;t talk shit and everyone was like being like, oh, you know</p>
<p>you only beat Yuri because because he was tired or</p>
<p>you know this or that and if they have a rematch under any of the rules that he would have lost and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like trying to figure out what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m strolling through George&rsquo;s feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone and I look at the comments</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m with this in mind. I&rsquo;m like George is the nicest person of all time</p>
<p>and if you look at the comments, it&rsquo;s like 10,000 comments and like</p>
<p>9,000 and 900 are just people calling him like all you do is lay and pray you pussy</p>
<p>You suck you can&rsquo;t finish anybody and I&rsquo;m just like I&rsquo;m looking at this and I&rsquo;m like people are gonna say</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re gonna say regardless, they&rsquo;re gonna talk shit regardless. So you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself</p>
<p>Is there some aspect that&rsquo;s I mentioned Conor McGregor. He he crossed the line with Khabib</p>
<p>At least in the eyes of Khabib</p>
<p>Is there something you ever regret about crossing a line or does that you ever feel like there&rsquo;s a line?</p>
<p>Or do you just keep pushing the line?</p>
<p>Uh, I basically play it per per person</p>
<p>I just I basically fire back with like one step above what what they do. It&rsquo;s always plus one. Yeah. Yeah, okay</p>
<p>So I go I usually go hard like they fire a bullet then I drop a Duke</p>
<p>And then and then after that initial shot then we go back and forth and I&rsquo;ll just keep one upping them</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that love you, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of people that love to hate you. Yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so like what do those people like energize you or do you just</p>
<p>Or is it funny to you? Like what as an athlete as a performer? You should not think about them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fun thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just like a fun thing that keeps me occupied</p>
<p>Like because like because most of them that like talk shit they like just say stuff that&rsquo;s factually incorrect</p>
<p>So then I just argue with like actual statistics. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>You suck or you&rsquo;re not gonna beat this person. I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve already submitted that guy</p>
<p>Yeah, so I just it riles them up and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just a fun thing for me to do my my downtime</p>
<p>Yeah, your responses are usually very factual. It&rsquo;s very scientific. I appreciate</p>
<p>Thank you. You actually you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. Okay. It&rsquo;s good mix. That&rsquo;s a good mix</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Mean a topic of haters are more specifically sort of doubts within yourself of doubts around you as you&rsquo;re coming up</p>
<p>Maybe George you can comment. Oh, we&rsquo;re just ignoring John completely in this conversation. I</p>
<p>Was gonna ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this on this topic</p>
<p>Are there times in your life yet?</p>
<p>You were surrounded by people that that doubted you all the time</p>
<p>And so what is there something you could say as in by way of advice how you overcome?</p>
<p>The doubt either yourself or others around you all the time the first time I</p>
<p>Manifest my desire to become a professional</p>
<p>Mixed martial art athlete everybody doubt me</p>
<p>Just not even I&rsquo;m not talking about the UFC just to become a professional fighter</p>
<p>Everybody doubt me and I became a I became a professional fighter. I had few amateur fight</p>
<p>I won them all then I I fought my first fight in</p>
<p>In Montreal, I won and I became a professional</p>
<p>Then I I told people that I wanted to fight in UFC. Everybody doubt me again. So it&rsquo;s a normal thing</p>
<p>So I work my way up beat a few guys then I at the time Pete Spratt was</p>
<p>just knocked knocked out Robbie Lawler with leg kick and</p>
<p>The person who was my agent at the time did a great move</p>
<p>For me, so he brought Pete Spratt in Montreal to fight me Pete Spratt came to Montreal</p>
<p>I and I believe he didn&rsquo;t know who I was</p>
<p>So he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and I and I end up beating him</p>
<p>So that gave me the opportunity to fight in UFC</p>
<p>Then after I was in UFC, I wanted to become champion of the world, you know</p>
<p>but Matthews was there and he seems invincible at the time so</p>
<p>Everybody doubt me again, and I became world champion and after when you when I was world champion, I wanted to be I</p>
<p>was competing against other world champion of other weight class</p>
<p>For the title, you know for the legacy and everything. So it&rsquo;s not no longer competing against my opponent</p>
<p>I was you know as a competitor you always you never wanted to be you never want to be satisfied because when</p>
<p>Satisfaction is the death, you know when you&rsquo;re satisfied you better retire because it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>So always I have to find motivation what you can have more. I want more don&rsquo;t be satisfied in life. So I wanted to be</p>
<p>Like the best, you know, I want as I was competing, you know</p>
<p>Like to become the best and and you know, of course that people doubt doubt you all the time</p>
<p>Every time you say something that it&rsquo;s outside of the norm of the normality</p>
<p>I want to say there there&rsquo;s nothing normal, but I&rsquo;m talking about when you you manifest your desire to do something that</p>
<p>takes</p>
<p>Special attribute to to to succeed or that is something that is hard to to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for sure you&rsquo;re gonna always have people that doubt you it&rsquo;s so strange that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t lean into supporting like people that love you, too</p>
<p>yeah, even people that love me used to doubt me and I believe I I you need to use that as</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>Positive positive thing as a motivation to prove them wrong</p>
<p>Yeah, so for me that that was a thing when someone doubt me nothing gave me more</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more energy because I want to prove him wrong</p>
<p>I want to look at him in the face and say hey, you see I got you man. I I did it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>John do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying I don&rsquo;t think you can do this to motivate them to</p>
<p>prove you wrong or more general question of</p>
<p>You know the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s your role as a coach when you have these two athletes with regards to your your first question?</p>
<p>Would I ever say to someone you can&rsquo;t do this as a kind of reverse psychology? I know</p>
<p>My job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills and</p>
<p>as Gordon pointed out earlier if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>In any way a rational human being and you&rsquo;re noticing that you&rsquo;re getting tremendous success</p>
<p>with a given move in the gym against high level opponents who</p>
<p>Give a good read on what your actual opponent in a competition is like</p>
<p>You would have to be a moron to not</p>
<p>Recognize that kind of success and say this is something I should be building into my game and you will carry the confidence that</p>
<p>You earned in the gym into the arena</p>
<p>So I never try to use reverse psychology. I build up</p>
<p>Everything I do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills</p>
<p>I know people say all this physicality on the one hand is mentality on the other and confidence is squarely in the the mental</p>
<p>Aspect of the game, but all the underpinnings and beginnings of confidence are physical</p>
<p>okay, a rational human being will see where they&rsquo;re having success and where they&rsquo;re having failure and</p>
<p>confidence will</p>
<p>Surround those areas where they&rsquo;re having success and will degenerate in cases where they&rsquo;re having failure</p>
<p>so my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do anything</p>
<p>psychologically after that I just</p>
<p>If I can set you up to be highly successful</p>
<p>With a given move or a set of tactics ten times in a row against quality opposition in the gym</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. I</p>
<p>Will tell people hey, you&rsquo;re doing a really good job with that move. It&rsquo;s working well for you</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>When they nod in agreement, I&rsquo;m not trying to force anything on them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re recognized they or they already recognized that long before the words came out of my mouth</p>
<p>but on the other hand intelligent rational people will recognize when they&rsquo;re failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part can</p>
<p>ever change that if</p>
<p>I teach Gordon</p>
<p>a given arm lock and</p>
<p>15 times in a row. It tries it over a month and all 15 of failures</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I can say verbally to come up to go and say hey, you&rsquo;re really good at that move</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna look at me say bullshit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible at it and that will create a crisis of confidence where Gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth</p>
<p>So I will never compromise that but isn&rsquo;t there a lot you just said 15 there you have to believe</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Doing this arm lock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it</p>
<p>I think yeah, that&rsquo;s a separate issue that that&rsquo;s a separate issue</p>
<p>There are times where I&rsquo;ve more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction for example</p>
<p>When I first met Gary tone and he never had a guillotine</p>
<p>Strangle and I I would say don&rsquo;t carry, you know, you&rsquo;re a scrambler</p>
<p>like one of the greatest weapons of scramble can ever develop as a guillotine like it should be in your arsenal and</p>
<p>He was like, yeah, I just grab off of the back and I said, well, there&rsquo;s gonna be a day</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take someone&rsquo;s back and it&rsquo;s always good to better strangle from front and back</p>
<p>Okay, of course, we all prefer a strangles on the back that makes sense</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s gonna come a day where it&rsquo;s gonna be useful for you</p>
<p>and so that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said you&rsquo;re learning this shut the fuck up and</p>
<p>Like literally wouldn&rsquo;t teach him any anything else until you got a guillotine. Yeah, Gary like asked him a question</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re guillotine and</p>
<p>For the first three months as gifted as as Gary tone it is and learning most moves most moves Gary gets it like</p>
<p>in minutes, there was something going on with Gary just couldn&rsquo;t get a guillotine on people and</p>
<p>Finally after around three months, he started having some success until ultimately became one of his best weapons</p>
<p>We had to go through like 15 different variations of guillotine</p>
<p>until he found one which actually worked reliably for him and</p>
<p>That was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said no</p>
<p>Do you have to learn this the long search had to do more with the physical characteristics?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out the right like it made sense. It made sense in the case of Gary tone because there were more opportunities per minute</p>
<p>Of his grappling for guillotines</p>
<p>The investment and time was worth it for another athlete. I might have said well</p>
<p>He hardly ever gets in the situation the front headlong so guillotine so it&rsquo;s not even worth investing the training time</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question on the on the competition side mentioned haters</p>
<p>And do you think about this aspect of the competition with athletes?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a great question and the answer is no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>You can see that you could you couldn&rsquo;t find two more polar opposites</p>
<p>psychologically than than George St. Pierre and this monstrosity on my left and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve never said to my athletes. Hey, I think this is the sort of demeanor you should carry yourself with</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m myself a very flawed character and I&rsquo;m the last person on earth</p>
<p>Who should be delving out moral advice to other people?</p>
<p>The only thing is that I you know, of course, I believe some things are off limits</p>
<p>But as long as it&rsquo;s done in the context of sport with no one&rsquo;s physically attacking people or do anything crazy</p>
<p>Where it just goes completely over the top then I give almost zero</p>
<p>Moral advice to my athletes. I&rsquo;m a jiu jitsu coach not a preacher</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>If I can if I may</p>
<p>We are entertainers</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re athletes or professional athletes, but we make</p>
<p>We make a living because of people or want to see us perform</p>
<p>Same thing an actor or something a singer and a lot of the time</p>
<p>especially in the fight game</p>
<p>An event is promoted. It needs to be with emotion</p>
<p>Love me hate me, but do not ignore me</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You know it</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s authentic and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done. Well, I think me my personally my my favorite fighters to watch are the one that are that</p>
<p>That I that have a sort of some sort of a bad persona</p>
<p>I really enjoy watching those guys because</p>
<p>They bring an emotion element into a fight, which is great</p>
<p>You know, I I feel to me it&rsquo;s more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved and I believe that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>Some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>They would that&rsquo;s the reason why we may we can make a living out of this</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re better entertainers, but you&rsquo;re right. The authenticity seems to be really important. There&rsquo;s actually something very interesting there</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to break out some some secrets</p>
<p>Do you know who like you think of George St. Pierre you think of like the highly technical polished</p>
<p>Martial artists. Oh, this is gonna be great. Do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably be thinking of probably someone who&rsquo;s really technically advanced</p>
<p>Actually, it was Mark Coleman. Oh, no, Kevin Randleman and Phil Barone</p>
<p>He used to love watching that was a hammer house. That was his favorite. He would love those guys and</p>
<p>whenever their fights were on georgie watching the hammer house crew and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny what you said about how those guys bought an intensity to</p>
<p>To MMA that was off the charts. Have you ever met those guys in?</p>
<p>And in their prime, let me tell you it was it was something to behold and</p>
<p>I had this crazy larger than life personality</p>
<p>Most of the things I did made no sense whatsoever</p>
<p>But I mean technically but that was their appeal and they were these guys and George loved to watch them more than anyone else</p>
<p>You never know what what could happen with these guys. I remember when Mark Coleman won the Pride Grand Prix</p>
<p>I was in my living room. I was jumping I was so happy. I was like, yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, he beat Igor Vorchevchin. That was like I like for to me. It was amazing. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because of the emotion that they brought into the fight George is actually very</p>
<p>interested by something you said that normally when I</p>
<p>Ask what is the appeal of a given fighter?</p>
<p>And what makes people watch a fight you talked about the idea that fighters entertain us and that&rsquo;s absolutely correct that they are</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird weird industry where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become</p>
<p>financially successful insofar as</p>
<p>Your favorite athletes to watch at least were people who are almost like the polar opposite of who you are</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that most people if you look at</p>
<p>Say a million people watch a pay per view event</p>
<p>What percentage of those million people have a genuine?</p>
<p>technical understanding of what&rsquo;s happening as they watch a fight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tiny</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely tiny the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no</p>
<p>technical understanding of</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in front of them? So how do they relate to the fight? What&rsquo;s the only way they can?</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s through emotion and</p>
<p>So when they get a sense that these two don&rsquo;t like each other then they can relate to the fight</p>
<p>But only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority will always form an emotional attachment to the fight</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when you see things shows that USC primetime, they never focus on</p>
<p>tactics and the techniques of the fight they focus on the emotional elements the</p>
<p>Preparation the view of their own family members as athletes get ready</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always an emotional pull because that&rsquo;s how 99 percent of the viewers</p>
<p>Relate to the fight if I haven&rsquo;t think about chess, okay, if I have minimal knowledge of two world champions</p>
<p>Coming to fight each other in it or match up against each other in a game of chess</p>
<p>I know so little about chess tactics and I can&rsquo;t really form any kind of technical</p>
<p>appreciation of what&rsquo;s going on on the board</p>
<p>But if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other&rsquo;s guts and they&rsquo;ve got a rivalry which goes back five years</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve said this and that about each other in public then suddenly on my ears break up and I&rsquo;m like, oh, okay</p>
<p>This sounds interesting</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t have the the knowledge to appreciate what&rsquo;s going on on the board and a chess game to be able to</p>
<p>to appreciate the</p>
<p>The technical nuances of what they&rsquo;re doing. So any</p>
<p>Interest that I have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because I&rsquo;m just not qualified</p>
<p>To make technical assessments and that&rsquo;s exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal</p>
<p>Conor McGregor was the all time master of this. I</p>
<p>believe also</p>
<p>Emotion can be used as a weapon</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve learned I&rsquo;ve learned this from my favorite boxer is sugar a Leonard</p>
<p>Sugar a Leonard. I remember I was very young</p>
<p>So I watched his fight later when I was older, but I know that sugar a Leonard</p>
<p>Was the best boxer of his era to me personally and I don&rsquo;t think nobody could beat him</p>
<p>I think it was skill skill wise it was the best. However, when he fought in Montreal Roberto Duran</p>
<p>Roberto Duran</p>
<p>Made it in a way that Leonard became very emotional he wanted to stand in front of Duran and</p>
<p>fight a different fight that that he normally does because he wanted to show that he&rsquo;s a man and</p>
<p>He lost that fight, which was a mistake</p>
<p>so by</p>
<p>Then later on he beat Roberto Duran in quite easy, you know, the if the fair everybody remember the no mask thing</p>
<p>but my point is</p>
<p>Emotion can be used in a way that it can make your derail your opponent out of his game plan</p>
<p>And I felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me. So that&rsquo;s why I never got involved</p>
<p>that was my way to defend myself against</p>
<p>Some kind of bullying is to put like a like a shield in front but some other guy like</p>
<p>Gordon he expressed himself differently. Of course, there&rsquo;s a language barrier, but for him he&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>Given giving giving back that says he&rsquo;s a better counter attacker, you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way you respond to to to the aggression of</p>
<p>An emotional attack. I think everybody is different in that regards. What&rsquo;s interesting that John said that he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Study the tactics of this game or maybe you&rsquo;re not interested in the tactics of this game</p>
<p>Because it seems like this is more than just being an entertainer</p>
<p>It seems like it could be an effective part of the match. Yeah, I just feel like whatever investment you make in that is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get negligible rewards first of all, it&rsquo;s probably only going to pertain to one match in front of you rather than the</p>
<p>totality of your career and</p>
<p>Whatever gains you get out of psychological trickery and play</p>
<p>Typically</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t last long you you&rsquo;ve raised an excellent example with sugar rate Leonard. He did fight outside of his usual</p>
<p>manner in that regard, but rather than me try to tell someone hey</p>
<p>Behave like this before a fight</p>
<p>I would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and say no</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re fighting this fight the wrong way and that would have a much</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>beneficial impact on my athletes and</p>
<p>Psychological trickery before a fight. I believe another example of</p>
<p>Emotion that leads to failure is a</p>
<p>Jose Aldo against Connor McGregor. I think it was it was on purpose that Connor McGregor</p>
<p>Did this try to bait Aldo to become over aggressive to open himself because he&rsquo;s an excellent counter puncher puncher</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I believe. It made a mistake</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another great one my match against cyborg</p>
<p>2018 no gi worlds where he didn&rsquo;t even try to win</p>
<p>He just like wanted to smack me in the face the whole time cuz he was so angry</p>
<p>I was talking shit to him before the match and</p>
<p>It was like the finals of the absolute it was like the biggest</p>
<p>Match of the weekend and he just didn&rsquo;t even try to pass my guard or do anything</p>
<p>He just wanted to hit me in the face and I was like sick. I just won</p>
<p>It was incredibly fresh. It&rsquo;s fascinating to watch like a grown man sort of lose</p>
<p>composure</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Gordon one thing I&rsquo;ve always been very impressed with you and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>No matter how heated talk gets</p>
<p>Before a match with you when you go out to grapple. You&rsquo;re absolutely cold</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve never gone into a match</p>
<p>carrying anything other than just cold blooded calculation and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always been able to separate very well the idea of words and deeds. And I think that&rsquo;s always been one of your</p>
<p>One of your strongest assets a way I often measure this is when a match is over</p>
<p>I will ask the athlete questions about the match and</p>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute? Okay</p>
<p>What was that set up you used in in the third minute?</p>
<p>They got you into the Kimura law if they can&rsquo;t answer that that tells me they were just fighting on instincts and emotion</p>
<p>But with Gordon, it&rsquo;s like a logbook</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like okay in the seventh minute you went for that</p>
<p>Judy Gatami set up from from on the left side</p>
<p>What were you thinking? He can always give an answer. He&rsquo;s absolutely stone cold</p>
<p>Speaking of emotion</p>
<p>Speaking of emotion Gordon you will potentially if you&rsquo;re healthy face Andre Galvao and the ADCC</p>
<p>coming up super fight</p>
<p>Who is Andre Galvao for people who don&rsquo;t know? Can you tell the story of your beef with?</p>
<p>The the emotional interaction with a man. Yeah, so Andre is</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s considered the greatest ADCC competitor of all time</p>
<p>multiple time black belt world champion</p>
<p>winningest ADCC champion ever he has six six gold medals and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to compete against him</p>
<p>Pretty much forever like since I got my black belt in 2016. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get matches with him</p>
<p>he was in the first DBI that I did and he ended up pulling out and that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get matches with him and</p>
<p>He would always say no and give one reason or another and then</p>
<p>After the last ADCC, I was like, hey Andre said he was retiring after this after this</p>
<p>This competition so if he wants to retire, you know, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s the greatest ADCC competitor of all time</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s great. But if he wants to compete and that&rsquo;s great. I was like super nice and then he started like</p>
<p>posting like passive aggressive Instagram</p>
<p>Captions and</p>
<p>then we started going back and forth in the internet and there was like one point where I saw him in person when he</p>
<p>Acknowledged he&rsquo;s like I understand like what you&rsquo;re doing like we&rsquo;re gonna pump this fight up and he was like totally on board</p>
<p>but then there must have been something that happened where like it changed from like him like going along with it to being like</p>
<p>Actually pissed and then there was that one night at flow where I went to go shake his hand</p>
<p>I mean he flipped me off and then he followed me backstage and started to try to fight me and then I smacked him and</p>
<p>Then he didn&rsquo;t want to fight anymore and then we&rsquo;ve been going back. He&rsquo;s actually blocked me on Instagram now</p>
<p>So he just won&rsquo;t engage no one from Atos will engage now</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting how he how he shows up if he can keep it under control or not</p>
<p>Do you think how do you explain that level of emotion? Is this fear of losing your throne?</p>
<p>Is it or is it just a human being like with the cyborg just</p>
<p>Just becoming emotionally unstable. Well, it might just be me</p>
<p>I just have a way to get and get under people&rsquo;s skin. It&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he was he was cool for a while and then I just I don&rsquo;t know it just</p>
<p>Then everyone gets like this. They&rsquo;re all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to read them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and and beat me like like Tim Sprague&rsquo;s is a perfect example at</p>
<p>ADCC I posted like</p>
<p>On my story on Instagram like ten minutes before a match</p>
<p>I said like what I&rsquo;m gonna do to Tim Sprague&rsquo;s is gonna be criminal and he&rsquo;s like a very stally guy and he came</p>
<p>He saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me</p>
<p>Like he came and actually engaged my guard and I ended up submitting him</p>
<p>So it either has that effect or it has the effect where they know I&rsquo;ve talked so much shit leading up to the match</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re so afraid to lose that they just get super stally and they move away</p>
<p>So either has one effect where they come forward and they want to they want to beat me beat me or they want to just</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage they&rsquo;re super cagey and they just back away and don&rsquo;t really do anything</p>
<p>Do you think this match happens?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of variables and what I have to see how my stomach is and to if I&rsquo;m actually gonna show up and compete</p>
<p>My stomach&rsquo;s healthy. I doubt that Andre will actually show up to compete</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to compete against him for six years and he hasn&rsquo;t done it</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason to think he would now is it possible for you to speak to where like your estimates are about your stomach?</p>
<p>Or is it too unclear for now still too early to tell I have this round of treatment that I&rsquo;m doing until late February</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I need to do the same test</p>
<p>They did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been feeling a little bit better. Like it&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as it used to be</p>
<p>I was explaining to someone the other day like for the last four years</p>
<p>I would be so nauseous that every time I would walk into a new room</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to actively locate a garbage can in case I have to throw up</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like one step above that right now. I&rsquo;m like doing a little bit better than that</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely getting a little bit better, but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not where it needs to be</p>
<p>Can we talk about diet for just a sec because both of you George and and Gordon?</p>
<p>Like suffered from stomach issues different kind and have arrived for now for different places</p>
<p>so can you maybe George speak to</p>
<p>The general question of what is the best diet for performance for training like what have you learned through your career about this?</p>
<p>Well, I think everybody is different</p>
<p>to me personally</p>
<p>I implement fasting</p>
<p>Time restricted eating and and prolonged fasting</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the longest you&rsquo;ve done so far? The longest I&rsquo;ve done is five days. I do it quite often</p>
<p>I do I do four times a year. I do</p>
<p>three to five days</p>
<p>water fast</p>
<p>And I liked it. It helps me with inflammation. I think it boosts the immune system and</p>
<p>That this about the I read papers about about this and I it helps me also feel</p>
<p>Feel good. It&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>Tera very therapeutic to physical and mental just mental</p>
<p>It meant mental and physical because when I eat my when I break my fast and I sit at the table with with other people</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I eat if we all eat the same thing. I always tell them</p>
<p>I said my food right now tastes better than all of yours, you know, because I you know, I I have that this</p>
<p>thing that I think I believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how</p>
<p>How</p>
<p>Pleasurable something is and I</p>
<p>Tent</p>
<p>Personally like diet wise I eat whatever I want</p>
<p>Whenever I want, I don&rsquo;t I no longer have any problem with this</p>
<p>but if I would have a competition coming up like</p>
<p>Knowing that I what I know now about my body I would</p>
<p>orient myself</p>
<p>more towards an animal based diet</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve tried different things and that&rsquo;s the kind of diet that I believe helped me</p>
<p>Having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for for for doing something physical</p>
<p>So high protein high fat low carbs</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>This is is different between animal based diet and keto. I mean there is carbs. There is a lot of fruit</p>
<p>I got a lot of the the carbs from the fruit</p>
<p>Okay, a lot of organs organs. I</p>
<p>Know a little bit about paleontology and in the past</p>
<p>About you a prehistoric human and and I I know that</p>
<p>And not not only about that. I know because I have travels a certain place in the world</p>
<p>I want to visit the Maasai in Africa the hunter gatherer tribe and I know that when they kill an animal</p>
<p>They go for the organs first and I know a pretty most predatory animal. They do the same thing</p>
<p>So organs I believe is something that normally in our culture in the western part of the world</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really eat but it&rsquo;s something that is very nutritious</p>
<p>Have you been able to convince Gordon to try fasting?</p>
<p>Talk about diets</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different situation. I think for Gordon because he&rsquo;s an heavyweight. He doesn&rsquo;t want to lose weight</p>
<p>You know when the heavyweight the range of like my range was like I was a welterweight and middleweight</p>
<p>But the heavyweight it&rsquo;s like some of the guys that you compete can compete against their it might be 300 pounds. So if you lose weight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a big problem. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So and there is things that will work for me that might not works for Gordon, you know</p>
<p>So we have to make his own experience and and I told Gordon sometime when everybody goes left</p>
<p>You try to go right see how you feel with certain things experiment</p>
<p>Not not a topic</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of your optimization</p>
<p>Optimal performance formula. Well what I used to do before my stomach issues and for those of you listening who don&rsquo;t know I had</p>
<p>recurring staph infections in</p>
<p>2018 and I took a bunch of oral antibiotics and it just completely wiped out my stomach</p>
<p>So I just was diagnosed. It was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis</p>
<p>So for those of you messaging me on Instagram who are just watching Rogan asking me about my gastroparesis. That&rsquo;s not what I have</p>
<p>They misdiagnosed it and I did some other tests and for four years</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know what it was and then I got this I went to this doctor in California who?</p>
<p>Diagnosed me with H. Pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestines. So the issues in the small intestines</p>
<p>so what I used to do was I used to do like</p>
<p>Seasons where I&rsquo;d have a very clean season where I was competing and I would have a lower body weight</p>
<p>And I would do like an offseason kind of like a bodybuilder where I would eat a lot more food and a little bit</p>
<p>Dirtier food and I would have cheeseburgers and pizza at nighttime to have the extra calories</p>
<p>But now I can&rsquo;t eat those foods because they upset my stomach</p>
<p>So now I pretty much just try to eat whatever I can and maintain the weight the best I can</p>
<p>Based on how my stomach feels. So right now it&rsquo;s like rice chicken eggs fish</p>
<p>vegetables fruits and</p>
<p>Pretty much nothing else like anything hard to digest</p>
<p>Anything spicy red meat fast food all that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s hard for me</p>
<p>Which sucks because in Texas things? Yeah barbecue</p>
<p>And I mean this diet is really important for you John I can tell</p>
<p>Like is it is that something you think about for athletes at all again, that&rsquo;s part of the I&rsquo;ve to be honest with you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any</p>
<p>measurable</p>
<p>Improvement in sports performance in jiu jitsu by change of diet. I do believe that diet is important for longevity and</p>
<p>Human beings and I do think it makes a difference, especially once you get past the age of 40</p>
<p>with regards longevity</p>
<p>For older athletes. I do believe it makes some difference. But my observation is in athletes and</p>
<p>In their youth and working up into their prime. I&rsquo;ve seen athletes have the worst</p>
<p>diets</p>
<p>God bless Travis Stevens for that guy won Olympic silver medal basically on McDonald&rsquo;s and candy. Yeah</p>
<p>George St. Pierre for 80% of your career. You were powered by McDonald&rsquo;s and coca cola</p>
<p>To Gina Alfredo. That was my yeah, my meal of choice before a championship fight</p>
<p>Gordon for him his youth was just five guys hamburgers Gary Tonin the same thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won Olympic gold medals</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Russian wrestlers who just ate</p>
<p>Whatever was put in front of them and their athletic performance was outstanding</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and</p>
<p>Their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. So I&rsquo;ve never I&rsquo;ve never seen someone say</p>
<p>Okay, I changed my diet and because of that there was a measurable</p>
<p>Improvement, you know in sports performance another way to phrase it though is I have noticed with a lot of lead athletes what they eat</p>
<p>They begin to believe that that either is not a hindrance or it&rsquo;s actually good</p>
<p>Like Travis Stevenson is an example of somebody who eats shitty</p>
<p>Because he believes it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a power because whatever he&rsquo;s traveling across the world</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t rely on healthy good food to be there</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to eat shitty so that that&rsquo;s the like my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever</p>
<p>Everywhere&rsquo;s got McDonald&rsquo;s everywhere&rsquo;s got McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>So that makes like and they&rsquo;ve convinced themselves and you talk about Russian athletes. A lot of them have very</p>
<p>Strong beliefs about like this</p>
<p>Particular food being good for them, but there&rsquo;s no agreement among them. Exactly. No agreement. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so believe is more important than the actual time. Yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I can after</p>
<p>You know after a night out when you&rsquo;re hanging over I</p>
<p>Think the best thing and and I&rsquo;m saying this and all certain sincerity</p>
<p>I think the best thing to eat to me was like like a cheese cheeseburgers with</p>
<p>We call that a puts in back home because it&rsquo;s very fat. It&rsquo;s greasy. So it up so the next day</p>
<p>When you wake up, I think you feel better because it absorbed the outcome. There you go. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>My mom told me the same story once and then I try it was like I was hung over for some party and</p>
<p>I woke up. I was like probably I don&rsquo;t know 19 or 20 I woke up and</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s like, yeah, just have it have a cheeseburger go go eat something greasy and I did and I was like</p>
<p>Oh, I feel kind of better now. I do not know that science the exact science behind it</p>
<p>but I I always notice and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s placebo, but I always notice that if I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m if I party hard and I&rsquo;ve been drinking a lot</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t eat before I go into bed if I don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>Shitty food the next day will wake up and feel worse than if I eat shitty food. I feel better</p>
<p>I know it sounds crazy. I don&rsquo;t know why but it works for me</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s also hard to do science on extreme performers so the discussions we&rsquo;re having is amongst the very</p>
<p>You know that this might not apply to a general like recreational athlete, but for the elite</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just seen champions in every kind of combat sport and I&rsquo;ve never seen a</p>
<p>Correlation between dietary habit and performance and people under the age of 30. I do believe that diet is important for longevity. However, and</p>
<p>For that alone it may well be worth investing time in it</p>
<p>But with regards sports performance at least in jiu jitsu, I&rsquo;ve never seen any significant difference</p>
<p>Well, we had a little bit of a difference of opinion on this</p>
<p>I think what about strength training and muscle building or at least we had a discussion about this</p>
<p>So what do you believe is the value of?</p>
<p>Of you know training outside of the sport so fitness</p>
<p>Lifting heavy lifting explosive all kinds of lifting</p>
<p>Personally for me, I believe and I&rsquo;ve learned that from from John</p>
<p>I used to do like</p>
<p>To train like a bodybuilder before because I thought in my early days of competition</p>
<p>That was the most efficient way to do things to because it was like I was watching Jean Claude Van Damme</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, we thought back back in the day. That was the thing</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s how we should do it, you know for to get ready for a fight</p>
<p>But I realized later on</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s all about efficiency and some guys they don&rsquo;t lift at all and they&rsquo;re doing pretty well, so I</p>
<p>Do cross training mostly for longevity</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly for a therapeutic</p>
<p>Like a therapy. It&rsquo;s more therapeutic than</p>
<p>For performance is to keep my body healthy to do a certain movement that are different than what I do every day in the gym</p>
<p>in combat sport to keep me</p>
<p>Healthy and and athletic so all the interesting movement stuff that you&rsquo;ve done outside the sport that was for</p>
<p>Therapeutic mostly therapeutic. I think it does it could</p>
<p>Transcend to performance, but it&rsquo;s mostly therapeutic. I do not believe that</p>
<p>Squatting five plates or bench bench pressing three plate will make me a better fighter</p>
<p>I do not I believe actually it could hurt me more. It could damage me more than than benefit me</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Gordon as somebody who on instagram posts</p>
<p>A lot of pictures of you being shredded and huge</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of of strength? So I do like a combination</p>
<p>John got us big into like gymnastics type movements like toes to bar and muscle ups and things like that when we were young</p>
<p>Like toes to bar because that&rsquo;s like the exact motion you have to do when you&rsquo;re retaining guard it needs to chest</p>
<p>So I do a lot of that stuff</p>
<p>In combination with I do a lot of</p>
<p>Opposite of george. I do a lot of bodybuilding workouts</p>
<p>Where I do like a basic split like a chest to chest</p>
<p>Triceps back and biceps day. Um, and my idea is that</p>
<p>Weight lifting should always be a supplement to jiu jitsu. So you shouldn&rsquo;t be missing a jiu jitsu session to lift weights</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t do I do probably I train jiu jitsu every day and I lift three to four times a week</p>
<p>Um, I feel like lifting seven days a week for me is is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy</p>
<p>When you do like hard lifts like that, um, but my idea is if you want to get good at jiu jitsu</p>
<p>Do jiu jitsu and if you want to be bigger and stronger lift weights and uh, and eat food and um,</p>
<p>I I generally don&rsquo;t go super heavy when I lift because you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff</p>
<p>Um, so I usually do moderate weights with a with a very high rep rep range like four sets of 20 with</p>
<p>a drop set at the end to fatigue the muscles break the fibers and</p>
<p>grow</p>
<p>Okay, so four sets of 20 that&rsquo;s interesting. So that that&rsquo;s more for endurance and raw strength</p>
<p>yeah, and also I think</p>
<p>close to the competition i&rsquo;ll pick the intensity up and</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max. I think that lifting</p>
<p>And just getting used to mentally redlining</p>
<p>Um gets me kind of in competition shape because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the guys i&rsquo;m training with</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not on a technical level</p>
<p>where they can</p>
<p>Physically exhaust me to the point where I feel like i&rsquo;m going to die</p>
<p>But uh, I get most of that like when i&rsquo;m wrestling because i&rsquo;m not as efficient in wrestling</p>
<p>So I get a lot more tired</p>
<p>Um and lifting when you do like if you do like four sets of 20</p>
<p>Leg press to squat and you go back and forth like you&rsquo;re like about to die at the end</p>
<p>And I think I feel like gets me in the mental habit of redlining before competition. But does muscle help you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the actual mass of muscle</p>
<p>Like the actual mass of muscle like this. So I think being stronger will always help in a combo will always help. Yeah</p>
<p>To some degree. It&rsquo;s not going to be to a degree where</p>
<p>It overrides efficiency, but I think that</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t help being strong or can&rsquo;t hurt being stronger. There&rsquo;s a bunch of people who believe depending on the sport that</p>
<p>The strength can quickly become a</p>
<p>That have detrimental effects to efficiency</p>
<p>Yeah, like I agree that certain kind of I mean if strength is purely is like very cleanly</p>
<p>Purely applied to the exact movements of the sport. So in judo the explosiveness you need</p>
<p>Is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>for us, uh</p>
<p>You always have to understand there&rsquo;s only so much technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength</p>
<p>Like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla, it&rsquo;s gonna kill us</p>
<p>Um, but that that being said, um, I do think that</p>
<p>Like for example heavyweights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size and strength to beat smaller people</p>
<p>Um, but I think that if you stay with this with the discipline of doing everything very precise</p>
<p>And I train with a lot smaller people most of the time so I get out of the habit of using uh using my strength</p>
<p>Um, I think if you&rsquo;re very precise with the way that you train I think that the the extra size and strength can help you</p>
<p>A quick question. How would you fight a silverback gorilla?</p>
<p>I mean, is there which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive that most people would say you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know, I actually</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an uh an answer to this</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna say I want I want I want to say that me and john had like a four hour discussion on</p>
<p>This one time i&rsquo;m like, what would win bear or gorilla?</p>
<p>Uh, and he went into like this whole dissertation about how like jaguars spin underneath and like berimbolo silverbacks and kill them and like rip</p>
<p>Their rip their artery and their legs out. It was amazing. I guess. Okay, so before we talk about strength john, let me ask you what</p>
<p>Do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced?</p>
<p>One of them would win and people wouldn&rsquo;t predict that</p>
<p>So they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting in the whether it&rsquo;s in the forest in the jungle</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s slow down here. Okay, so there&rsquo;s two animals of different species fighting</p>
<p>And and most people would pick</p>
<p>So for example, the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason i&rsquo;m not exactly sure why the king of the jungle</p>
<p>well, I</p>
<p>You know a lot of people told me that the lion</p>
<p>for example, the tiger can</p>
<p>Be a lion. Yeah, this is one of those age old debates</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay. Yeah. Well in grappling in fighting it feels like some animals use</p>
<p>teeth</p>
<p>And some use other parts of their body also like bear actually, I don&rsquo;t even know how they</p>
<p>They have extraordinarily powerful</p>
<p>And long claws and in addition, they&rsquo;re powerful biters as well. So I wonder and the same with the silverback</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much they&rsquo;re I love that we&rsquo;re having this discussion</p>
<p>I think we need joe rogan for this discussion. I think so. Yeah, I think so. Um, so</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Your your question has gone in about five different. So it started with strength. Uh, and let&rsquo;s go back there, which is</p>
<p>Do you think for for an athlete in jiu jitsu? Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s stick to grappling</p>
<p>All right. Do you think strength strength is helpful or detrimental? Uh, i&rsquo;ve always believed that</p>
<p>two things will</p>
<p>Uh create whatever</p>
<p>Whatever effectiveness you have in grappling those are your skill set and your attributes</p>
<p>And the best athletes are those who excel in both</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself if someone gets twice as strong</p>
<p>By some kind of magic potion they&rsquo;re going to be a more effective grappler if someone gets</p>
<p>Twice the level of endurance that they had previously they will be a more effective grappler</p>
<p>These physical attributes have a very important outcome on the uh, sorry</p>
<p>A very important effect upon the outcome of matches</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s always a good thing to be stronger. It&rsquo;s always a good thing to have better endurance</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there. Um</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s point was okay. Everyone agrees on that but there&rsquo;s a problem in order to build these things</p>
<p>You have to carve into other elements of your training regimen and then it becomes well, which becomes more important</p>
<p>increases in strength or increases in skill</p>
<p>There comes a point where</p>
<p>Investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell the difference between someone who bench presses</p>
<p>300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds, but that&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hundred pound difference and for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds</p>
<p>That would require a great deal of uh of training effort and focus</p>
<p>But if I can&rsquo;t tell the difference when I grapple and then why bother?</p>
<p>Okay, once you get to a certain strength level</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the stage you you&rsquo;re really getting a diminishing in returns on your training investment</p>
<p>um now skills on the other hand</p>
<p>Experience far far less in terms of diminishing returns every new skill you develop</p>
<p>can translate</p>
<p>Very very well into big increases in performance. Look at the example of gary tonin that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>investments in guillotine</p>
<p>Made a significant improvement in his uh effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But if he had invested the same amount of training time in</p>
<p>Developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously that would have had no outcome no</p>
<p>Influence on the outcome of those matches</p>
<p>So the question always becomes yep. Everyone acknowledges that these physical</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a desirable thing and every athlete should work on them</p>
<p>The interesting question becomes okay at what point?</p>
<p>Do you start to say i&rsquo;m not going to be helped by further increases?</p>
<p>in in strength training or endurance training, um</p>
<p>And my point with my athletes is in the overwhelming majority of cases</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any kind of doubt invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training</p>
<p>Especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing that I think you should account for with strength training</p>
<p>is um</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s instagram</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the world. It&rsquo;s uh, it seems to be more fun to build muscle mass</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s like an addiction that people have there&rsquo;s also economic elements too</p>
<p>Like most people I I hate to say this but it&rsquo;s true. Most people are more concerned with image</p>
<p>than function and uh</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s hard to sell</p>
<p>A fighter or a jiu jitsu athlete who doesn&rsquo;t look like one looks like fedor</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough sell now</p>
<p>You can do it in fighting and jiu jitsu because ultimately it&rsquo;s about whose hand is raised at the end of the match</p>
<p>And you could even use it as a selling point</p>
<p>You can be a guy that doesn&rsquo;t look like he should be winning but he is winning that is a selling point</p>
<p>but if you give most people a choice between</p>
<p>Looking like arnold schwarzenegger and winning matches versus looking like fedor and when he matches most people will select</p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d rather look like arnold schwarzenegger</p>
<p>And so most athletes feel almost like an economic compulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability</p>
<p>Yeah, nike&rsquo;s not going to sponsor fedor or tank abbott. Yeah tank abbott</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Fedor, maybe</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we need at the very top. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something about uh aesthetic</p>
<p>Like image of strength and power. It&rsquo;s also and also a personal thing if you look at yourself in the mirror</p>
<p>Do you like what what you see? You know what I mean? Yeah, you find yourself attractive</p>
<p>You know, what what can you do to make you look better?</p>
<p>And I think to me to me it was something that one of the reason I work out it&rsquo;s also for for that</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m sure if fedor looks in the mirror. He says I look damn good today</p>
<p>Yeah, you could be too. It&rsquo;s also a genetic factor some people, you know, it&rsquo;s harder for them. I mean, yeah</p>
<p>All right. So the question on training you guys john gordon train</p>
<p>Often three times a day every day</p>
<p>um, georgia had a different like, um</p>
<p>a different approach to training so like what is uh</p>
<p>For for no, I don&rsquo;t mean that in a kind of the opposite or something. It&rsquo;s just not every single day</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and obviously you are</p>
<p>legitimately at the very top</p>
<p>Uh in terms of performance accomplishment in the field. So what have you learned about?</p>
<p>What it takes to train to become not just the lead but the best well, I I um</p>
<p>A lot of people when you say train they they see training hard. I believe you need to be very constant</p>
<p>Uh, and uh, very disciplined you need to train but you don&rsquo;t need to train hard every day</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what john, uh taught me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>For me is the nervous system. Sometimes I feel if I load it up too much it comes to a point that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much. There is no no more information that I can absorb</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Uh, and I do believe that it&rsquo;s something that you can train to your the capacity your capacity of being able to learn of</p>
<p>absorbing certain thing</p>
<p>and uh, I did a lot of volume of training but when I when I</p>
<p>Was getting ready for a fight, especially during sparring day</p>
<p>I like to do it quick because my when I fight it&rsquo;s five round of five minutes</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to to spend</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh an hour or two hours in a gym because</p>
<p>I need to know how hard I can be</p>
<p>Going for 25 minutes, you know when I not for two hours for 25 minutes and at my last fight</p>
<p>john and I we we we</p>
<p>We were thinking of how could we</p>
<p>make me more</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Of a better finisher, you know more opportunists</p>
<p>And then john I remember we we when we were training with gordon jake shill came gary tonin</p>
<p>my round of grappling were different than if I would be training for uh</p>
<p>Abu dhabi, you know for for abi or like some like in grappling the round or longer but</p>
<p>in a mixed martial art fight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare that you&rsquo;re gonna spend</p>
<p>more than</p>
<p>Four minutes or four minutes and a half on the ground. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very unlikely. I mean it could it can happen but</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Do you remember we did the round three minutes? We did all the round I was doing were three minute round</p>
<p>So it gives a different</p>
<p>Uh rhythm to the training it forced me to be more opportunist</p>
<p>To be more of a finisher because I had only three minutes to to do what I needed to do</p>
<p>So if I if I see something I need to to go for the kill right away. I cannot be too over patient</p>
<p>You know what? I mean?</p>
<p>And it it served me well in my last fight and I think it that&rsquo;s a good blueprint to follow</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re a mixed martial art fighter, I if I would if</p>
<p>the result was great and I think</p>
<p>Maybe I should have done that before it was a great great idea that we had not to do</p>
<p>Be very careful on doing too much volume</p>
<p>Yes, try to get out and then try to focus on finishing and getting getting out as quickly as possible</p>
<p>To build up your foundation. I believe you need a lot of volume</p>
<p>But when you get ready for a competition, you need some to be something that replicate</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re gonna be facing? What do you what are we talking about? What do you think?</p>
<p>Like is there rest days five days a week?</p>
<p>Twice a day once a day. Is there any one formula like that? I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>This this I don&rsquo;t I do not believe in overtraining. I believe in under arrest</p>
<p>I believe</p>
<p>You can be under arrest and</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>Always link that immediately to the volume of their how much volume they they train</p>
<p>Which it could be something else. How are you feeling? I&rsquo;m emotionally. Are you you having uh,</p>
<p>Problems, uh personal problem. Do you have a have a hard time sleeping because you have a like someone died or I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Like you you hold money you&rsquo;re broke or what like, you know what I mean could be anything</p>
<p>There is something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally</p>
<p>That made it in a way that you cannot sleep. Well because your your stress your cortisol level is high</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you know what? I mean all these factors need to be take taken in consideration. It&rsquo;s not only about the volume of training people</p>
<p>always think</p>
<p>The volume of the training is the only thing that can affect</p>
<p>Recuperation which is not you know. Yeah, you have to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of factors</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very stressful job to be a professional</p>
<p>combat athlete whether you&rsquo;re a grappler a boxer a kickboxer a fighter and you need to be taking</p>
<p>as a</p>
<p>Into account is it more or less stressful than marriage? Just kidding</p>
<p>Uh next question, uh</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know how to ask this question given what george just said but you&rsquo;re training three times a day</p>
<p>And finishing</p>
<p>And what what have you learned about what what brings out the best in you as as the elite level grappler?</p>
<p>Um, so over the recent years have actually changed it up a little bit</p>
<p>um when I was</p>
<p>Coming up through from white to black belt</p>
<p>Uh, I felt that the volume was the most important so it would be anywhere from like three</p>
<p>To seven sessions a day</p>
<p>Um going from school to school from new york to new jersey. Um, and I think that the volume was very important to build the skills</p>
<p>um where I just</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t know how to move my body at purple belt the way that I should. Um, so I think that building the skills</p>
<p>Is uh is super important. I think that early on volume is very important</p>
<p>Uh now that I already have the skills built. I think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important</p>
<p>Um, so I think that the volume is the most important</p>
<p>Is the most important um, so I find that if I do</p>
<p>So many sessions a day like if I do three sessions a day</p>
<p>Um, I feel sometimes by the third session i&rsquo;m just like so mentally like there&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s so much information</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s went through my head the first two sessions that I feel like i&rsquo;m not even there mentally on the third session</p>
<p>Um, so I feel like doing less volume now</p>
<p>But having more mental clarity per session is more important because I already have the foundational skills acquired</p>
<p>So a lot of your training is almost like</p>
<p>Just thinking like learning a lot of it. Yeah, so i&rsquo;ll do like</p>
<p>I mean our schedule has been messed up since the pandemic because henzos got shut down</p>
<p>And they were using a french gym in puerto rico and now we&rsquo;re using a french gym in our and in austin</p>
<p>Um, but once we have our own school</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have a setup schedule where I can pretty much just be there all day long</p>
<p>But right now I do like a lifting session in the morning and then i&rsquo;ll come in and help teach</p>
<p>At henzos, so i&rsquo;m there mentally i&rsquo;m seeing what&rsquo;s going on and i&rsquo;m playing around with ideas in my head</p>
<p>Uh, and then i&rsquo;m there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class during the 1 p.m</p>
<p>Session and then after that i&rsquo;ll go home i&rsquo;ll rest and get ready for the next day</p>
<p>What have you learned on seeing all these different athletes is there a</p>
<p>A universal rule that applies or is it um, athlete specific? Yeah, uh, first one thing</p>
<p>It needs to be addressed is that george and gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands</p>
<p>Gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six</p>
<p>minutes to literally hours long</p>
<p>um as a result, uh the overall</p>
<p>Pacing and intensity of matches is massively different most obviously there is no striking in gordon&rsquo;s sport</p>
<p>Um striking by its very nature is a much more explosive physical action than grappling is grappling is primarily an isometric</p>
<p>kind of uh sport based around isometric tension and endurance</p>
<p>um george&rsquo;s sport is</p>
<p>It does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but</p>
<p>The majority of it is based around explosion. So the physical demands of the two sports are radically different</p>
<p>different in addition the time of application is is radically different</p>
<p>George raised a very interesting point his matches seem long 25 minutes for a championship match</p>
<p>Um, but always understand it</p>
<p>It makes martial arts fight</p>
<p>at championship level</p>
<p>if it goes the distance is really</p>
<p>five five minute matches each round</p>
<p>Is a match in itself and that&rsquo;s exactly how you&rsquo;re scored. You&rsquo;re scored by who wins the most matches over five matches</p>
<p>As a result the application of the techniques, especially the grappling techniques has to be done at a certain pace as george pointed out</p>
<p>realistically</p>
<p>the maximum application time you&rsquo;re going to get in most situations is somewhere between</p>
<p>15 seconds and three minutes</p>
<p>Even for a specialized grappler like damien meyer. There&rsquo;s still a significant part of each round which is</p>
<p>Spent in set up time to actually get the match to the ground</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you&rsquo;ll have to reinitiate the entire process again</p>
<p>So that even for specialized grapplers, you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round</p>
<p>Uh on the ground and as a result, you&rsquo;ve got to get your work done in a very short time frame</p>
<p>gordon ryan</p>
<p>Once it goes to the ground and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground</p>
<p>Uh may spend the entire match in ground positions. Um</p>
<p>As a result the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands and the preparation that the two athletes go through will reflect that</p>
<p>If george saint pierre in training for mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a point</p>
<p>Where he&rsquo;s no longer physically effective and able to defend himself the consequences for that in mma training can be very deep and deep</p>
<p>Okay, if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you&rsquo;re fatigued and tired and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some deep consequences. A grappler doesn&rsquo;t have to face that you can be completely</p>
<p>Exhausted and grappling and just sit in the bottom of the mountain. Just practice just survival skills</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t get submitted from bottom out and that can still be an effective training session</p>
<p>complete and utter physical breakdown and fatigue can be</p>
<p>Can end an athlete&rsquo;s career in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>the consequences of</p>
<p>training through fatigue and mma</p>
<p>Potentially very deep and very disturbing</p>
<p>Um, the consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren&rsquo;t really that severe</p>
<p>Okay, you just tap whenever there&rsquo;s a problem just tap</p>
<p>Um, and so they&rsquo;re very very different sports in the way you you prepare for them</p>
<p>And a grappling</p>
<p>Athlete like gordon ryan, we can take</p>
<p>Many more liberties with physical exhaustion and the amount of hours a day you spend training</p>
<p>Than you could with a mixed martial arts athlete like that should be a benefit. Uh exhaustion as a</p>
<p>As a framework of learning so like from a place of exhaustion</p>
<p>Is there any benefit to the you on the you said being at the bottom of mouth sort of understanding?</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu or grappling somehow deeper because you&rsquo;re physically absolutely</p>
<p>Absolutely, because then the only thing you have left in your favor is the training and the training</p>
<p>Absolutely, because then the only thing you have left in your favor is your technique and then you&rsquo;ll see how technical you are</p>
<p>In addition you&rsquo;ll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time in</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to endure which will</p>
<p>have uh</p>
<p>Potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. Yeah, there&rsquo;s uh, I mean for me for a recreational person</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>Exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels like to really get dominated</p>
<p>At an even greater frequency than you otherwise would</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something there. There&rsquo;s some animalistic thing. That&rsquo;s very unpleasant</p>
<p>and then afterwards it takes you to a nice to a place of</p>
<p>like, um humility and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you get it forces you to rethink life</p>
<p>in positive ways</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about dominance. It can mean if you get dominated a few times you can uh, rationalize it somehow</p>
<p>You say okay</p>
<p>Well, I screwed this up</p>
<p>But with when you&rsquo;re exhausted and you have to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of just being dominant</p>
<p>Over and over and over being submitted</p>
<p>It uh, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very good process for</p>
<p>For other avenues of life I find it&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t explain why because i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>uh driving home crying afterwards listening to bruce springsteen, but afterwards</p>
<p>yeah, this</p>
<p>Afterwards somehow you can think clearer you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life</p>
<p>Like relationships work, but also the grappling</p>
<p>Actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do</p>
<p>It clarifies other avenues the humility. It&rsquo;s the it removes the bullshit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we see</p>
<p>The world through some kind of fog and it just removes it and now you can see things clearly. I don&rsquo;t know what that is</p>
<p>I think I think it&rsquo;s important like you mentioned to push yourself like sometimes</p>
<p>to see</p>
<p>How far you can go because sometimes you you can go further than where you think and it can boost your confidence</p>
<p>You know, you can push yourself through a certain limit</p>
<p>And maybe you thought your limit were was before that point and you push through it</p>
<p>But like john just mentioned</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risky thing to do in</p>
<p>Striking because if you&rsquo;re exhausted you&rsquo;re gonna get brain damage</p>
<p>In grappling it&rsquo;s you know, you tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning</p>
<p>I like to run track. I do it all the time and track and feel</p>
<p>it it helps me to</p>
<p>To to know myself better. I think it&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good point</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do. It&rsquo;s like, you know, if you stop moving</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re gonna get scored on and you know in your mind like there&rsquo;s no mechanical reason</p>
<p>Why I am why I should give up a score here, but you&rsquo;re so exhausted that you&rsquo;re like, oh man, this is terrible</p>
<p>If I if I stop moving i&rsquo;m a pussy</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t stop move if I don&rsquo;t stop moving i&rsquo;m gonna be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s an interesting game. You have to play inside your mind. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>That keep you that keep you uh sharp, you know what I mean? Because you just want to lay down and beat it</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re completely exhausted, you know</p>
<p>What do you think uh is the connection john between this ego pride thing?</p>
<p>Martial arts and actual violence in our with our ancestors. Do you think</p>
<p>You ever plug into that? Do you think that&rsquo;s a good thing?</p>
<p>With our ancestors. Do you think you ever plug into that?</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s echoes of something going on there or like you mentioned you have flaws and demons</p>
<p>Is it deep in there somewhere? Do you think we&rsquo;re struggling with those demons?</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, you&rsquo;ll need to patch up your question a little bit though. It&rsquo;s going to say we&rsquo;re different donations. Wow, that was</p>
<p>Not only might be dominating just I mean dominating interviewing. No, no, no, but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>Patched up that question. Uh, it&rsquo;s not brother seeing where they&rsquo;re like, okay now we interview you</p>
<p>But you you went down the evolution</p>
<p>I mean, do you think do you um, I don&rsquo;t mean just the line between what is what is martial arts and what is violence?</p>
<p>I mean there there seems to be a gray area</p>
<p>And that connects us to the the evolutionary ancestors. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I think there&rsquo;s a deep</p>
<p>recognition in all of us that</p>
<p>um, and this is</p>
<p>The evidence for this is is so easy to uh to see in in in daily life. Um</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting</p>
<p>You will see literally everyone on that street stop whatever they&rsquo;re doing and watch the fight</p>
<p>Humans are fascinated by violence</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself why and of course, it&rsquo;s a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history</p>
<p>Violence was one of the most important elements in human existence</p>
<p>As much as we curse it as much as we talk badly of it. Um</p>
<p>Um, the juxtaposition between humans social nature and their their need to for each other to get along and to express</p>
<p>love amongst the</p>
<p>the various members of a given community</p>
<p>there are</p>
<p>Disputes between humans that can&rsquo;t be resolved and ultimately</p>
<p>throughout history violence has been the number one method of</p>
<p>conflict resolution</p>
<p>um for better or for worse and there&rsquo;s a recognition in all of us that</p>
<p>This is where we come from and there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>combat sports have this</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>People will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them, but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it</p>
<p>and um, uh</p>
<p>I do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense</p>
<p>of their</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s on a subconscious level this kind of belief that</p>
<p>This is who we are. Um george used the word pride and I believe that&rsquo;s a big part of it. I believe that um,</p>
<p>Most</p>
<p>Humans have this sense of self worth and pride which they&rsquo;re willing to fight for</p>
<p>And uh, if it gets crossed by someone else they&rsquo;re willing to stand that</p>
<p>Some people will stand more early and some people will be pushed further back, but everyone&rsquo;s got that</p>
<p>That line beyond which they won&rsquo;t be pushed</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some kind of deep recognition in all of us that we have that somewhere within us</p>
<p>No matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I believe there will always be this eternal</p>
<p>interest in combat sports</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or</p>
<p>non consensual violence</p>
<p>um, I think most people most good people are repulsed by that now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that as humanity</p>
<p>Improves out into the future that will become more and more widespread</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say we we can&rsquo;t exercise these these</p>
<p>old evolutionary demons inside of us and um, uh and</p>
<p>sometimes there are just disputes between different people different cultures different nations where</p>
<p>ultimately it&rsquo;s going to come to</p>
<p>Into into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence. There&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>a need for humans to be able to</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>express themselves</p>
<p>Through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their their goals and objectives</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>Our need as humans is always to find a balance between</p>
<p>The two forces of conflict and cooperation</p>
<p>We need cooperation because humans isolated from each other are more or less helpless and useless</p>
<p>uh in order to</p>
<p>advance human communities need to build and grow</p>
<p>And so that sense of cooperation</p>
<p>occurs in most of our daily lives</p>
<p>But there will also be irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to to form a resolution</p>
<p>more resolution and so most human beings find themselves</p>
<p>swinging like a pendulum between conflict and cooperation</p>
<p>and um, uh, and that is something which</p>
<p>Really gives birth I think to combat sports because sorry. I really have to ask you about this then. There&rsquo;s a guy even harvard</p>
<p>uh named richard rangham</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people that believe this he wrote this book that um</p>
<p>Um, basically, there&rsquo;s a lot of people studying is what happened? How did we get from apes to humans?</p>
<p>Like what was the magic thing? Right a lot of people attributed to fire and ability to cook meat</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different theories</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>he actually um</p>
<p>His theory</p>
<p>How do I describe this is basically that that the beta males won?</p>
<p>that the the</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Apes that were able to cooperate so you though the way you develop cooperation is that there&rsquo;s a big bad leader</p>
<p>that uh, the the alpha male</p>
<p>that you can only</p>
<p>um knock off their throne if you cooperate</p>
<p>And so we build big tribes that just excel the cooperation by practicing the overthrowing the leader</p>
<p>and so and anytime an alpha male would rise up they would get would we would uh</p>
<p>Develop our skill further and further of cooperation</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re all just beta males, uh, the descendants of beta males</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s this uh kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental and it&rsquo;s so distinct to the the rest of the</p>
<p>neighboring animal kingdom</p>
<p>So fascinating. I wonder what you think about this tension of violence of cooperation</p>
<p>And how important is this cooperation to the core of yeah, uh who if you you can look at it in the uh,</p>
<p>in a given training room, um</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat</p>
<p>but all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers and</p>
<p>Uh as much as it&rsquo;s an individual sport</p>
<p>All of your preparation is done in as part of a group. Um</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which uh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting metaphor for humanity itself everything we do in life. We do alone, but we grow up in this</p>
<p>Given community and and what have you?</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>With regards to the the whole alpha male beta male thing, um</p>
<p>Humans are it&rsquo;s true. This fellow&rsquo;s correct. We you know, most</p>
<p>Primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the um, uh,</p>
<p>of of uh</p>
<p>The community they they build around themselves</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Humans on the other hand</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have an alpha male in that strict biological sense of someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Responsible for the next generation dominates all the female population, etc</p>
<p>Physically dominates, but we do on the other hand have our own version of alpha males insofar as we have political and sociological</p>
<p>Leaders who have a disproportionate impact on the direction of a of a community. Um</p>
<p>uh, so was the cooperation allowed us to</p>
<p>To have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a fascinating theory</p>
<p>In in nature, we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re very weak as a species</p>
<p>So we needed to cooperate cooperate in order to to evolve that I think</p>
<p>Made us uh, the the top of the food chain if you look at um,</p>
<p>Humanity in in nature, really the two things that seem to</p>
<p>More than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be</p>
<p>Successful in a predatory world are numbers and technology</p>
<p>Okay, the more your numbers increase and the the higher the technology of the weapons and support systems you have around you the more successful</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be in a predatory world</p>
<p>um, so it&rsquo;s not clear that just killing off the idea of an alpha male was the</p>
<p>The the single biggest thing. Um, the rise of technology</p>
<p>Uh and the growth of community</p>
<p>After the imposition of language, these are other things that would have been</p>
<p>Very very important factors and and humanity&rsquo;s rise george. You made an interesting point if you look at humans</p>
<p>Just the raw material of humans. We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fucking pathetic. We did and a predatory animal kingdom. We&rsquo;re just the absolute bottom of the food chain</p>
<p>Um, we don&rsquo;t have a single</p>
<p>effective</p>
<p>Weapon other than better than average endurance. That&rsquo;s about it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But you put us in a community who can talk to each other with language and give us the time</p>
<p>To come up with technological advances such as metal</p>
<p>um, and suddenly a human will go from no combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom to a</p>
<p>A human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill</p>
<p>damn near any animal in the uh,</p>
<p>In the animal kingdom and working as a group</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll beat your silver back. You know how i&rsquo;ll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have to touch him</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be in a</p>
<p>Because he cannot swim so I don&rsquo;t have to touch him you&rsquo;ll drown and I&rsquo;ll get him into the pool</p>
<p>You know why because someone told me because we live in a community someone told me that information. So I know he passed it on to me</p>
<p>Yeah, he taught you</p>
<p>Well, you have to convince him to you have to somehow convince them to join you in the pool, which is very difficult</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very problem. Very very difficult. Um</p>
<p>From a</p>
<p>technical perspective john you&rsquo;ve looked at</p>
<p>Martial arts fighting in general and grappling. What&rsquo;s the difference between fighting and grappling?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something i&rsquo;d love to</p>
<p>Ask all of you. Maybe john you can start like, um, well, uh when you talk about fighting you mean unrestricted</p>
<p>Uh mma top type fighting. Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny. You said unrestricted mma type fight mma type fighting</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s this street fighting. Yep. Yeah, there&rsquo;s mma fighting and then there&rsquo;s grappling</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the sport of grappling. You&rsquo;re saying okay. What&rsquo;s the difference between mma and grappling? Yes. Okay</p>
<p>Um, see that would have been a much better question to ask. Um, well the uh, uh the single</p>
<p>When you talk about grappling you&rsquo;re talking about jujitsu rules or yeah</p>
<p>I mean you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally challenge change the sport, you know</p>
<p>Um in the sport of mixed martial arts</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got two</p>
<p>Ways to inflict damage on the human body. You&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve got kinetic energy which is done through striking</p>
<p>kicking knees elbows fists, um</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>uh isometric tension used along the lines of</p>
<p>lever and fulcrum</p>
<p>Which can be used for strangulation and and joint breaking</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>In grappling you lose one of those you&rsquo;re no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy</p>
<p>you can do it accidentally through a throw, but you&rsquo;re not allowed to just</p>
<p>You know knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports it can happen</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s relatively rare and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not encouraged by the rule set</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Yeah, you got close, um, uh, so</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which in mixed martial arts you got twice as many problems to deal with and um, uh, and they occur</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>A much shorter time frame the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon</p>
<p>In human combat versus striking technique is time</p>
<p>Grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>The great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome once you get there</p>
<p>It takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown</p>
<p>Physically take them down</p>
<p>Work their way work your way towards a dominant position culminating in your opponent&rsquo;s back and then apply a strangle hold</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a long chain of events as opposed to</p>
<p>A strong punch or kick which can take</p>
<p>A quarter of a second an application from start to finish and the match is over</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense in which uh grappling is is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fighting for the patient and the calculating</p>
<p>Whereas striking is much more for</p>
<p>In this short time frame where everything gets done in the in the blink of an eye</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. You can make a terrible mistake</p>
<p>End up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts, it&rsquo;s much much less forgiving</p>
<p>If you get hit and stunned your chances of recovery</p>
<p>Are minimal you&rsquo;re going to get swarmed on and unless it&rsquo;s right at the end of the round you it&rsquo;s very very hard to recover</p>
<p>From getting hit and swarmed on. Um</p>
<p>uh, so there&rsquo;s a sense in which</p>
<p>The biggest difference between them is time of application of technique</p>
<p>Uh in mixed martial arts, it&rsquo;s incredibly unforgiving in terms of time</p>
<p>Even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences</p>
<p>In grappling you can make massive errors and still come back and win</p>
<p>um grappling will typically be won</p>
<p>In a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler. Whereas there is</p>
<p>much more of what they call a punches chance in mixed martial arts where</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete</p>
<p>Defeating a greater athlete in mma than there is in grappling simply because of time of application of the techniques</p>
<p>Even the smallest period of inattention</p>
<p>In mma and the match is over gordon ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds</p>
<p>Have his opponent mounted on and wake up and finish him five minutes later. It&rsquo;s not going to happen in mma</p>
<p>Okay, so the the stakes are much higher</p>
<p>You can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time and just the dynamic temporal dynamics of how things happen</p>
<p>Is very different everything you&rsquo;ll see will be a reflection of that then you go further into things like rule sets</p>
<p>In the sport of grappling if gordon ryan comes out and sits down in the middle of the mat</p>
<p>His opponent must follow him to the ground and engage</p>
<p>in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>If you come to the center of the cage and sit down</p>
<p>The other guy can just walk away from you. They&rsquo;re completely</p>
<p>Oriented in different directions grappling is ground centered</p>
<p>Mma is typically standing centered at the beginning of every round you have to start standing again</p>
<p>If I disengage from a ground grappling situation stand up and walk away from my opponent</p>
<p>My opponent must follow me up to the feet</p>
<p>In grappling it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. If I sit to the ground my opponent must follow me to the ground</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written into the rule set and so one is inherently ground or oriented and one is inherently standing oriented</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>Yes, you have to be able to impose where the fight is whereas in grappling you can simply choose it. So</p>
<p>George, what is uh your sense of the the difference in terms of how you approached it?</p>
<p>Uh between the two sports so you also are a student of wrestling and grappling so in preparing for fights</p>
<p>What parts of grappling purely the sport that you have to leave behind</p>
<p>well, I I uh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, very lucky. I had the opportunity to I train with I consider the best</p>
<p>mentor trainer I ever ever had</p>
<p>and I have</p>
<p>Some of the best grapplers that I can train with they were they were there to help me through my career</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>uh for my training is</p>
<p>Of course because I do not dedicate as much time in one specific area. It&rsquo;s hard to be</p>
<p>You know a world class athlete and that in in only one particular area always</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>Like the idea to be more well rounded to be very competent in every of those areas striking grappling</p>
<p>Take downs and and all those areas then being just very good at one</p>
<p>And not as good at as as others, you know, because I like the idea that</p>
<p>It gives me more option when I fight someone I can</p>
<p>Mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to a that person better if i&rsquo;m more well rounded</p>
<p>If I do not have those well rounded skill</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that option, you know</p>
<p>You have less tools to work with less technology. What about you gordon? What um,</p>
<p>You know, what do you think is very distinct about grappling in the way you approach it versus fighting? I think most of it was covered</p>
<p>But I think that the the one one of the big things is the fact that when you&rsquo;re looking at mma</p>
<p>You have a pretty general agreed upon and unified rule set where if you look at ufc versus bellator</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they have slight differences in the rules maybe um, but it&rsquo;s pretty much the same thing</p>
<p>Whereas in grappling you have ebi rules, then you have adcc rules. You have ibgf rules. You have no time limit rules</p>
<p>um, and</p>
<p>Each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes. Um, if you have if you do adcc rules</p>
<p>Uh, it generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers or if they can stall to the overtime</p>
<p>And then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really doing jiu jitsu, but they score a takedown. They&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>Whereas if you have like a jiu jitsu</p>
<p>Takedown they&rsquo;re gonna win whereas if you have like an ebi for example</p>
<p>You have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu jitsu position with your back taken or in an armbar</p>
<p>um, so I think that you have</p>
<p>certain rule sets that play in the favor of certain athletes, um and</p>
<p>Certain athletes can win in one rule set, but then they just have no chance of winning in the other</p>
<p>Like when I fought yuri the first time in ebi</p>
<p>I beat him in ebi the chances of me beating him on that night under an adcc rule set were probably pretty low</p>
<p>Um when I fought liandra low under an adcc rule set</p>
<p>He beat me that day, but the chances of him beating me on the same day in an ebi rules that were like next to zero</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s interesting that</p>
<p>In mma you have one unified rule set which have small differences, but they&rsquo;re all generally the same</p>
<p>um, and in jiu jitsu, you have a wide variety of different rule sets that um have</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>biases towards</p>
<p>a certain athlete skill sets you mentioned liandra low</p>
<p>I gotta ask you again about adcc</p>
<p>You have lost very very few times in your career</p>
<p>Uh one</p>
<p>I mean this is the same is true for george and uh, the only person who has ever submitted you is philippe penya black belt</p>
<p>Yeah at black belt</p>
<p>Um, he is adcc world champion multiple time abby jjf gi and no gi world champion</p>
<p>You may face him adcc or elsewhere in the future</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Will you beat him?</p>
<p>uh, yes, I mean I have to say yes, right, um, but uh</p>
<p>I fought him initially when I first got my black belt, um that I fought him a year later. So 2016 and 2017</p>
<p>Um, and despite what people remember about the match</p>
<p>And whenever people talk about it&rsquo;s like oh, yeah, the guy who strangled gordon, but no one remembers that the first match was like a 45 minute</p>
<p>war</p>
<p>Um, and then the second match with the full 20 minutes of adcc and if I didn&rsquo;t get my back taken in like the last</p>
<p>Minute and a half two minutes, it would have went into an overtime. Um that could change the outcome of the match</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think that if you look at philippe&rsquo;s performances</p>
<p>Especially nogi specifically nogi since then it looks like he&rsquo;s almost gotten worse</p>
<p>Whereas since that match</p>
<p>uh in 2017</p>
<p>Uh, the only match I lost after that was against vinnie, uh, magalesh by by points and uh, i&rsquo;m on like a 55</p>
<p>match win streak</p>
<p>um over the course of four years, um winning all the major tournaments nogi and uh philippe since that match I think is like five and two</p>
<p>uh, nogi</p>
<p>Um, and he&rsquo;s lost his last two match matches one was convincingly where he was dominated by andre and one was by submission</p>
<p>Um, so I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s progressed nearly as fast if anything</p>
<p>He looks like he&rsquo;s worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances</p>
<p>Um that being said, I know he&rsquo;s going to come in training very hard for this one and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s going to be prepared</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>In terms of technical ability. He&rsquo;s anywhere near my level and um, he was much bigger than me both times</p>
<p>We fought um the first time he was much bigger than me the second time. He was one weight class above me</p>
<p>um, so now there&rsquo;s not going to be an advantage in</p>
<p>Technicality and it&rsquo;s also not going to be a physicality advantage. So I think he&rsquo;s just going to be beat everywhere</p>
<p>This is uh, this is a good example of the scientific response to a um,</p>
<p>Um to a comment to a to a question. Yeah, so he&rsquo;s not um,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a match you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not deeply concerned with</p>
<p>And in terms of the set of opponents because you you have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually in my opinion one of the easier matches because of the fact that we&rsquo;re relatively the same size</p>
<p>um, if I show up at 230 pounds like a lot of the guys are</p>
<p>260 270 plus so that extra weight does make a difference. I think out of that entire bracket. Um,</p>
<p>Felipe is probably going to be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that I can easily take him down</p>
<p>And if I take him down i&rsquo;m going to pass his guard</p>
<p>Whereas I feel like the other guys because they&rsquo;re so much bigger and they&rsquo;re very cagey. Um, it may take me a while to actually</p>
<p>Take them to the ground. Um</p>
<p>And get on top of them</p>
<p>And I think it may be they may be longer drawn out matches because of the fact that they&rsquo;re so much bigger and</p>
<p>And stally it&rsquo;s hard to take them down, but flea based relatively my size and as wrestling is atrocious</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;ve already taken them down in the last adcc match</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m pretty sure I can just easily put them down pass them and then finish them</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m, not sure what response I was expecting but uh, that was that was that was phrased beautifully</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>We talked about the tiago alves fight that george had and john borrowed up in class yesterday</p>
<p>I believe but the point is we&rsquo;re talking about wrestling and I think that that&rsquo;s a fascinating fight</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible display of strategy of skill of heart</p>
<p>Uh, george, could you maybe talk about that fight john? Maybe two what lessons you gained from that fight?</p>
<p>Go ahead. It was you&rsquo;re fighting on mine</p>
<p>Well, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury I think third round. Oh, yeah. Um</p>
<p>Um, so I was fighting tiago alves and uh in the third round I um</p>
<p>Tear my adductor muscle</p>
<p>Um, it happened when I was on the bottom and he I think he pushed my knee down tried to pass my guard and I</p>
<p>Heard a pop</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I think you were going for an armbar</p>
<p>You were on his back you switched to armbar and he cleared the leg by pushing on your leg</p>
<p>And you went in with a preexisting injury and it tore</p>
<p>Yes, and and it it it get worse and and I heard a pop</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but I know it really hurt. So I came back standing up and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>A famous video one that goes on the internet about when I go back in the corner</p>
<p>And I tell my my coach i&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I think I tore my my my adductor muscle and</p>
<p>Greg jackson is like, I don&rsquo;t care hit him with your groin</p>
<p>I was very worried because I I wasn&rsquo;t pain, but I didn&rsquo;t know I didn&rsquo;t know what what I had</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know the gravity of it and it it it plays on your mind</p>
<p>So but I had to buy to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight, you know</p>
<p>I knew I was ahead on the on the scorecard and uh, I needed to finish finish strong</p>
<p>So what was your strategy there in terms of strikes in terms of wrestling so he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>Exceptionally difficult opponent to take down. Yeah. Well at at first I I I knew I would add a good jab a good</p>
<p>You know to stay always</p>
<p>From the outside, you know fight him from the outside and and use my footwork because he was like a tank</p>
<p>He was much bigger and much</p>
<p>stronger than me and uh</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want never wanted to stay in front of him</p>
<p>So he was all the way out or all the way in and when I was coming all the way in</p>
<p>It was with my uh proactive or reactive takedown where I myself</p>
<p>initiated the takedown by uh, using a distraction like a jab to make it is is and goes up and then I go</p>
<p>with a single double leg or uh to react like baiting him for him to come hit me and then</p>
<p>While he&rsquo;s coming to hit me I go change level and and that&rsquo;s the way I like to take my time</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way I like to take my opponent down, you know some guys for example, like like uh, cabbie</p>
<p>for example, he&rsquo;s very good at at</p>
<p>Bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to to take his opponent down. I find it for me for myself. I specialize more into</p>
<p>Explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because I found it</p>
<p>more economical for me</p>
<p>What what did you see you were you&rsquo;re commenting john about the wrestling</p>
<p>That was that was quite interesting. I mean also, can you generally comment on the fact that george sanpia who don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think you wrestled</p>
<p>I wrestle I started wrestling. I was 19 years old, but I wrestled some very good russian guys. So they took me underneath their wing and</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>My ability to cover distance</p>
<p>Come from karate does not come from wrestling wrestling is how I finish once I got the leg how I finish the takedown</p>
<p>Uh, so the the timing and the movement and the explosion required for this karate. Yeah</p>
<p>I think an important distinction to make here is um one which george</p>
<p>uh made throughout his career and I</p>
<p>Believe george you were the greatest innovator in mma history</p>
<p>um with regards to this</p>
<p>and this is uh</p>
<p>The creation of what george calls shoot boxing which is the amalgamation</p>
<p>Of striking technique in george&rsquo;s case mostly karate because that was his martial arts background</p>
<p>um into grappling and in particular takedowns</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>when most people say</p>
<p>So and so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>You have to be very careful what they mean by this there are many highly credentialed wrestlers</p>
<p>In the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and truly struggled to hit a takedown</p>
<p>Now these are very very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>In a striking situation where the ranges are completely different and the setups are entirely different</p>
<p>The stances are different even the the overall conditions are different. You&rsquo;re no longer wearing shoes</p>
<p>People underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off</p>
<p>You lose like 20 of your forward drive the minute you take off the shoes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Uh, all of these make massive differences in whether or not you&rsquo;re going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown</p>
<p>As george pointed out the true value of wrestling in mma is finishing the takedown once you&rsquo;ve established contact</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only about 20 of the action of a of a mixed martial arts takedown 80 of it is an understanding range</p>
<p>rhythm setup</p>
<p>opportunity, etc, etc, and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not part of wrestling at all</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re even the overall conditions are completely different in the sport of wrestling</p>
<p>You start a very close range in a very bent over stance and you&rsquo;re expected to wrestle for</p>
<p>In international stars for three minutes at a time</p>
<p>Um now suddenly you&rsquo;re completely upright</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not wearing shoes all the conditions the the the rhythm and speed of it is different</p>
<p>The counters are completely different. It&rsquo;s just an entirely different animal</p>
<p>And so george was an early recognizer of this</p>
<p>And started to put the emphasis on direct training for shoot boxing</p>
<p>In addition to wrestling so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the montreal wrestling club</p>
<p>Just the sport of wrestling and that&rsquo;s what made him very good at finishing takedowns, but it was in his shoot boxing training</p>
<p>Which he himself largely developed remember george started at a time when mma was pretty damn young</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>Um, he we were when when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts george, it wasn&rsquo;t even allowed on tv</p>
<p>Like it was completely banned. It was in his country. It was</p>
<p>physically banned</p>
<p>Uh, they had to fight on indian reservations and you know, and this is way back in the wild west days of mma</p>
<p>and so as a as a young developing athlete he had to</p>
<p>More or less do this by himself</p>
<p>If you ever want to hear some incredible stories talk about teenage george saint pierre</p>
<p>Who had a coach who used to make him put on boxing gloves now?</p>
<p>He was 16 17 years old and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his</p>
<p>Late 20s at the peak of his career and he said george you&rsquo;re not allowed to punch</p>
<p>You just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out</p>
<p>And it was and it was crazy</p>
<p>darwinism, he was like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>Adapt or you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>Literally and he had that it could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s admitted</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sense here in which</p>
<p>People think oh, you know what determines your takedown ability in mma as your wrestling skill</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns, but there&rsquo;s so much more to it than that</p>
<p>Whenever people say, you know, what what are the broad</p>
<p>elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight</p>
<p>Okay on the broadest possible level. I always give the same three things</p>
<p>The athlete who can dominate the pace</p>
<p>of the match</p>
<p>The athlete who can dominate the direction of the match and the athlete who can dominate the setups will win the vast majority of fights</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in those three things</p>
<p>The direction the pace and the setups you dominate all three of those</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to win 90 of the matches. You&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>Um, george could always dominate the direction of the fight because he could stop the other guy taking him down</p>
<p>And he could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match</p>
<p>So whether it went to ground or whether it stayed standing was always up to him</p>
<p>George had the most sophisticated array of setups into takedowns</p>
<p>That i&rsquo;ve personally ever witnessed</p>
<p>um, the whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in george&rsquo;s career and</p>
<p>He excelled in both most people tend to favor one or the other</p>
<p>Most athletes have a very hard time</p>
<p>imposing</p>
<p>Their setups on an opponent and as a result they have to use</p>
<p>The cage as a crutch for their for their setups where they just bully someone towards the cage and then put them down on the cage</p>
<p>George is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open</p>
<p>And could do so in both proactive and reactive</p>
<p>situations</p>
<p>And the scary thing is that as good as</p>
<p>All of you saw him look in the octagon</p>
<p>Um, anyone who knows george as a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that</p>
<p>In the gym where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself</p>
<p>I could sit here all day. I won&rsquo;t name names, but I always laugh when people say oh, this is the greatest</p>
<p>Uh pound for pound guy of all time and i&rsquo;ve personally seen george</p>
<p>Take that guy down and crush him in the gym</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t say anything because it&rsquo;s rude to talk about that in public because it&rsquo;s just training</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;ve seen george go with people all the way up to light heavyweight some of the greatest names in the history of the sport</p>
<p>Put them down</p>
<p>Advanced position on the ground and dominate them in training. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s what he did during that time. I uh, george</p>
<p>I I got to say I deeply admire many of the things I saw you do not just in the octagon but</p>
<p>in training as well as um</p>
<p>The the impact that you had on</p>
<p>uh, the</p>
<p>the degree to which</p>
<p>Takedowns were used in the sport was absolutely inspirational</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why one of one of the reasons why I always say you&rsquo;re one of the the only athlete I ever met who taught me</p>
<p>more than than I taught you because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of of shoot boxing and how</p>
<p>I grew up in a time when uh, you I was laughing before when you talked about sugar ray lennard</p>
<p>I was a kid watching that match and um, I grew up in a time where there was</p>
<p>Boxing and there was kickboxing and then I came to america and I learned grappling and</p>
<p>This young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two</p>
<p>Well, then I have to ask because george sits here uncomfortably being complimented</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if george saint pierre</p>
<p>And kabib nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins</p>
<p>Who that&rsquo;s a very very loaded question how yeah, like what are the different trajectories you see?</p>
<p>Oh, okay. How does each one win in your view if one wins or the other one wins what happened interestingly they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>very similar in size despite the fact that</p>
<p>George fought at welterweight and kabib fought it</p>
<p>Lightweight if you actually see them standing next to each other the of similar height. Kabib&rsquo;s actually a little more thick set</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s actually heavier than you walking around. Um, uh, george walked around most of his career between 188 and 191</p>
<p>191 pounds</p>
<p>And so kabib actually would ironically have</p>
<p>a kind of size and strength advantage</p>
<p>Uh despite being in the lighter weight division that&rsquo;s been the general trend as mma</p>
<p>Has grown is that athletes will come further down and wait to make weight divisions. Um,</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>I believe that george has the best takedowns in history, uh in the open in the cage</p>
<p>Um, kabib was his great strength was using the fence to facilitate takedowns. Um,</p>
<p>Kabib&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Other great strength was not only his ability to take people down but to keep people down for extended periods of time</p>
<p>both of them were</p>
<p>Powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents, uh on the floor</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re both very similar in that regard</p>
<p>Um, kabib was mostly a uh, a puncher from the back george was mostly an elbow from the front</p>
<p>Um, but both of them could lay waste to opponents with strikes on the floor</p>
<p>Um, both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t submission specialists in the sense of someone like gordon ryan, but uh, they were</p>
<p>certainly, um</p>
<p>No slouches with submission holds. Um</p>
<p>Um, yeah, it&rsquo;s just a fascinating idea. So it&rsquo;s almost like who gets the first takedown. Yeah, I do believe</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>They could probably stand up on each other</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round</p>
<p>Um, both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>Um, I do believe that george would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management</p>
<p>um, the few times that kabib did look shaky is</p>
<p>when he</p>
<p>Kabir was either advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to fight moving backwards</p>
<p>There was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards, which is very good and his ability to fight going backwards</p>
<p>Which was noticeably?</p>
<p>weaker</p>
<p>Um, george would often fight both forwards and backwards. It was the giago elvis fight</p>
<p>Most of the standing time. Yeah, it was was going backwards. Um</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the single biggest difference between the two athletes and skill level would be in the standing position</p>
<p>um on the ground, uh</p>
<p>Kabib slight edge and takedowns on the fence george slight edge and takedowns in the center</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Ability to inflict damage on the floor roughly equal ability to fight off the back roughly equal</p>
<p>Ability to stand up from bottom roughly equal. It&rsquo;s a very very hard match</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>In terms of the biggest</p>
<p>difference in skill level is going to be in a standing position and so it would come down to</p>
<p>um, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that kabib would lose in the standing position. He might just push it to the fence and just</p>
<p>use match tactics where he</p>
<p>Kept the fight on the fence for significant periods of time</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Uh, and you can win rounds in that fashion. So it&rsquo;s a match that could go either way</p>
<p>Both of them are absolutely the best that you&rsquo;ll ever see</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life were george saint pierre kabib. Noam, get off and john jones</p>
<p>Um, the three of them have some interesting similarities and differences</p>
<p>all three</p>
<p>Uh beat every single person they ever faced</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I I know john jones officially has a loss by dq, but no one believes that was a loss</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh, george does have two losses, but he</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Defeated both athletes decisively</p>
<p>Uh in rematches kabib did it by having no losses</p>
<p>Interestingly all three athletes have at least one match which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>John jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judge&rsquo;s scorecard kabib&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Uh match against glaceon t bell could have gone either way</p>
<p>Uh george&rsquo;s match with hendrix was could have gone either way</p>
<p>They they all had matches that they won which people would dispute the outcome. So that was a similarity between the three of them. Um,</p>
<p>all three of them</p>
<p>Have had the ability</p>
<p>To dominate the direction of fights when they want it to go down it goes down when they don&rsquo;t want it to go down</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that a mixed martial arts champion</p>
<p>Must be able to determine the direction of a fight. It&rsquo;s the single most important attribute that they all must have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>As to which of the three is the best it&rsquo;s going to come down to criteria</p>
<p>You you can&rsquo;t pull them apart</p>
<p>Which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use</p>
<p>Okay, is it being undefeated?</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Uh, is it the amount of time was it the quality of the opponents that they had if you do it by quality of opponents?</p>
<p>I think you probably have to give it to george if you do it by um</p>
<p>Uh measured dominance through not being defeated and it has to go to compete</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Arguably you could say the same with john jones since his one</p>
<p>losses</p>
<p>By dq</p>
<p>But then you could also say the last three or four fights that john&rsquo;s had haven&rsquo;t been the same measure of dominance as we saw</p>
<p>previously</p>
<p>so ultimately</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got those three guys in my opinion</p>
<p>And which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about</p>
<p>The respective label of the athletes you could throw a blanket over them. The three of them are just that good and um</p>
<p>Uh, and which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes</p>
<p>I I believe the best fighter the goat is not even born</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>the generation</p>
<p>That is present</p>
<p>Benefit of a huge advantage</p>
<p>They have knowledge technology that we didn&rsquo;t have before</p>
<p>And we had the the knowledge that the other generation did not have before</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I believe the best the goat is not even born yet as good as they are today. I think you</p>
<p>In sport where you can measure the performance, uh track and field</p>
<p>Olympic lifting you can you know someone</p>
<p>Is better than the other one because you can measure the performance fighting. It&rsquo;s all subjective. We always debate of who would win</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>10 the tendency in sport</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>Performance get better. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because the athlete necessarily get better</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they have access to better technology knowledge</p>
<p>And they learn from their predecessor</p>
<p>As long as that knowledge is transferred forward</p>
<p>Something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and it&rsquo;s forgotten some of the greatest warriors</p>
<p>Like you imagine the kind of grapplers. We just the history didn&rsquo;t record them</p>
<p>There could have been small tribes where they developed many ufcs</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve developed the kind of things we you have to think of like, uh, the gracies</p>
<p>Just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly</p>
<p>I often</p>
<p>As this this discussion with john and I think it&rsquo;s very important like to mention I asked you very several times like</p>
<p>What would happen if we would take?</p>
<p>A fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancration. This is an interesting question</p>
<p>And you brought some incredible good point and and people don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t realize it, you know</p>
<p>yeah, no, I think um, one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of</p>
<p>uh, the historical records of pancration like most of what we know was</p>
<p>Uh from what i&rsquo;m told is actually lost in the fires of the library of alexandria</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re left with only a pitiful amount of information on uh pancration matches</p>
<p>But what we do know is that there was a very</p>
<p>large</p>
<p>uh participation in the sport and that it was</p>
<p>Why they considered the most popular</p>
<p>Sport in the ancient olympics and that it was represented in the ancient olympics for many hundreds of years</p>
<p>Plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient olympics</p>
<p>And so the development time</p>
<p>That it may have had would have been very significant it</p>
<p>Uh as far as we know most of the development would have been in the major greek city states for</p>
<p>Uh, literally hundreds of years of development</p>
<p>Um given its prestige as an olympic sport then the best athletes would have been doing it some of the sharpest minds that we know of</p>
<p>In human history were involved in the sport. Um, plato the great philosopher</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Was a pancreasianist in his youth. In fact, his name plato is a nickname</p>
<p>platus is like plate</p>
<p>it means broad or big guy like the big guy and um</p>
<p>Uh, he spoke often about pancreasian and in his written works</p>
<p>Um, imagine people with the intelligence of plato</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>Grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular olympic sport of that time</p>
<p>significant numbers of people with</p>
<p>Financial backing as city states put great prestige upon olympic success. They would have funneled athletes in</p>
<p>And brought in the best coaches and they had that for many hundreds of years like it&rsquo;s quite conceivable that the best pancreasian athletes</p>
<p>were of the absolute first quality and um, uh, it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad to think we&rsquo;ll never know. What was their skill level and uh,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about what kind of techniques they developed whether</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff we haven&rsquo;t discovered yet in class. You&rsquo;re talking about the most effective</p>
<p>Of takedown strategy in wrestling and collegiate wrestling. So maybe let me ask first, uh, because we offline talked about this, too</p>
<p>What is the highest percentage submission in grappling overall? You have to go with the rear naked strangle strangles from the back</p>
<p>If you look at most tournaments and most rule sets</p>
<p>It has success across all rule sets. Um, all weight divisions</p>
<p>All body types. It doesn&rsquo;t require any kind of specific</p>
<p>Physical advantage such as height, uh in order to be effective</p>
<p>Um, it works equally well in both fighting and grappling. Um</p>
<p>It will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is. Okay</p>
<p>A heel hook is a very high percentage technique in in modern day competition</p>
<p>But if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he&rsquo;s not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t result in the end of a match a strangle hold by contrast will always end the match regardless of</p>
<p>Your opponent&rsquo;s mental toughness</p>
<p>So, um, I believe it&rsquo;s fair to say that at the end of the day the single most high percentage</p>
<p>method of uh submitting people and grappling is the rear naked strangle. So when you look at an athlete, maybe Gordon you could speak to this like</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best, uh, you mentioned Gary with the guillotine</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best submission to really invest in? Is it the rear naked choke?</p>
<p>To really invest your development like understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that</p>
<p>Uh, I think that I mean you have to do them all obviously</p>
<p>But if I had like one submission that I would only one submission I could pick for the rest of my life</p>
<p>It would definitely be a rear naked</p>
<p>Can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>Well as John spoke about they&rsquo;re different in joint locks. Whereas</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to tap you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangle. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no, uh,</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of that. Um, and then it&rsquo;s just an inherent</p>
<p>Advantage you have being behind someone</p>
<p>Um, whereas if you go for an armbar you stop you start from top mount and you&rsquo;re facing the guy and then you put them</p>
<p>Down and you&rsquo;re not directly behind them with leg locks. You&rsquo;re facing the guy</p>
<p>Whereas when you&rsquo;re on someone&rsquo;s back you have them in a pin where you can your chest to back</p>
<p>You have a body triangle and you&rsquo;re pinning the guy in place. He can&rsquo;t explode out. He can&rsquo;t grease his way out</p>
<p>Most of the time, uh, and there&rsquo;s an inherent advantage you have being behind them due to the fact that</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re poorly set up to deal with threats behind us</p>
<p>So would you say that&rsquo;s the most dominant position jiu jitsu like more than mount?</p>
<p>More than yeah</p>
<p>Sack control more than I think uh, if you look at most matches historically</p>
<p>Most guys who get stuck in positions</p>
<p>For long amounts of time are guys that they&rsquo;re back taking. Um, if you get</p>
<p>An explosive guy from bottom mountain bridge and he can off balance you and lock half guard maybe and then work back to guard</p>
<p>But if someone locks a body triangle on your back, um, that&rsquo;s where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long amounts of time</p>
<p>Was uh was the body triangle like a well understood thing</p>
<p>Was that an invention at some point like as a system as a as a control</p>
<p>Yeah, um, perhaps some of your your listeners can correct me on this but I believe there was a technique banned in judo called dojime</p>
<p>Which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back and it was banned in judo</p>
<p>I believe because uh of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of of judo</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>in the modern era</p>
<p>When I first began jiu jitsu body triangles were relatively rare. They were not a standard part of class</p>
<p>Um, and sometime around the late 1990s early 2000s people started to realize hey, this is a stronger method of control</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>It greatly increases the amount of control you have over your of your opponent&rsquo;s hips and torso over regular hooks</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s not for all athletes. It&rsquo;s difficult for most people who are of shorter thicker statue, uh, to</p>
<p>Employ on on on big people if your opponent&rsquo;s very broadly built through the stomach. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to apply</p>
<p>And so because it can&rsquo;t be applied by all people it tends not to be taught much at beginner level</p>
<p>So as a result, it was always seen as a</p>
<p>kind of a speciality</p>
<p>It was always seen as a kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad</p>
<p>Base move for everyone or every body type in every class to employ</p>
<p>So it just didn&rsquo;t get emphasized that much but in top level competition now</p>
<p>I think you would see that it&rsquo;s very apparent that the vast majority of athletes whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between</p>
<p>Body triangle and regular rear mounts the majority of modern athletes would use a body triangle</p>
<p>So we also had this conversation about wrestling. Maybe georgie can comment on like what what&rsquo;s the uh, the highest percentage?</p>
<p>Not statistically speaking. Perhaps that&rsquo;s also interesting as john talked about but just for you in terms of mastery of a takedown</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the best way to take down a human being?</p>
<p>in wrestling well, I</p>
<p>Personally for me, it depends</p>
<p>For every fighter are different. They have a different set of skill</p>
<p>For me, I when I look someone</p>
<p>Want to bring down a tree a big strong high tree</p>
<p>He cut it from the base</p>
<p>So the legs that that&rsquo;s what we stand on so it was to attack the leg</p>
<p>But is it single leg double leg? Is it we talked about like, uh,</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also the the john smith low single. Actually, I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s applicable for jiu jitsu at all</p>
<p>Applicable for jiu jitsu at all. You you can use it, but it runs into the problem with submission holds</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not impossible to use but without shoes and in a situation where there&rsquo;s a whole plethora of submission holds in the scoring</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little more difficult to use, you know</p>
<p>It is interesting something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that every athlete is different. But if it&rsquo;s more effective for most people</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting what john talked about is that</p>
<p>the highest percentage thing is actually, um</p>
<p>In collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is</p>
<p>On the defensive side, so blocking a takedown and spinning around to the to the back</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting idea then also there&rsquo;s all of these kind of going in for a singleness switching to a double or</p>
<p>Or wizard position and doing knee tap like there&rsquo;s all these kinds of combinations that seem to be</p>
<p>Effective when you look at the statistics and it seems like there&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s a scientific way of thinking but it seems like there is</p>
<p>Some conclusion to be drawn there. Oh, yeah, I believe you need to the high percentage move</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why it works. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>for a bigger amount of people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>For example, I one of my main</p>
<p>strength</p>
<p>Athletic strength is i&rsquo;m an explosive person</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;ll use technique that are explosive if I got a single leg my my one of my thing</p>
<p>I like to do is to go for the double power double</p>
<p>but for uh</p>
<p>Someone else we got for example in a single leg position. Maybe he likes</p>
<p>Like body throw better. He&rsquo;s more a greco guy like so or he&rsquo;s a judo guy. He&rsquo;s gonna go for something something else. So</p>
<p>But there there is move that are I would say like you just mentioned are universal like statistically speaking. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>The highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody everybody pretty much can do a an adhaka jimmy, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs</p>
<p>So so those move like a rear naked choke adhaka jimmy is the highest percentage move because it&rsquo;s maybe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe more accessible</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accessible for a bigger range. Yeah based on the physical characteristics of the people</p>
<p>Do you draw any wisdom from these high percentages john for like in terms of what to focus on? Yeah, absolutely</p>
<p>Um juditsu has an ocean of moves and you can get lost on that ocean</p>
<p>You can drift for a long period of time and and and that was very little to show for it</p>
<p>So my whole thing is focus. We only live one lifetime</p>
<p>And your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>in that time</p>
<p>I must die on the mat</p>
<p>That is the same. Yeah</p>
<p>Uh, I I put a very high value on</p>
<p>Choosing what I believe to be the most high percentage</p>
<p>Uh moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them</p>
<p>Um, the only problem is that in one generation a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be high</p>
<p>Percentage in another generation, for example</p>
<p>We talked earlier about leg locks when I was first started judice. They were considered the ultimate low percentage move and</p>
<p>Uh a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact that was</p>
<p>That was incorrect that they can be a high percentage move if we just change our approach to them</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so we can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>Follow tradition</p>
<p>And say oh, this is low percentage. This is high percentage. It has to be part of</p>
<p>a fairly systematic study where you investigate</p>
<p>What are the reasons why it&rsquo;s high percentage or low percentage with regards to takedowns?</p>
<p>If you look at what?</p>
<p>We can consider the most high percentage takedowns</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in front of someone the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs</p>
<p>And push them backwards</p>
<p>Okay, if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them</p>
<p>They can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and</p>
<p>Funk their way out of takedowns and cause all kinds of problems for you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how athletic your opponent is if you get a hold a firm grip</p>
<p>Of both of his legs and start pushing him backwards. He&rsquo;s going to fall down to his butt</p>
<p>Now he might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down</p>
<p>Even easier than that is to be behind someone</p>
<p>Takedowns from in front of someone are difficult you go right into their hips their head their hands</p>
<p>You go into all their defensive weapons. If you&rsquo;re already behind someone and you&rsquo;re doing what in america</p>
<p>They refer to as a mat return. This is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front</p>
<p>If you have control of their head in a front headlock position</p>
<p>You have already closed distance on your opponent. You already have close contact. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about shooting anymore</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sprawl out of that. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about guillotines kimoras or the uh, standard defenses</p>
<p>Those will intrinsically be easier takedowns out of front headlock</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re going to talk about high percentage technique, I always go back to the mechanics of it</p>
<p>Rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong. It was wrong about leg locks</p>
<p>It can be wrong about other things too</p>
<p>So my primary thing is okay. Talk to me about mechanics</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not. Um,</p>
<p>Gordon pointed out earlier that when you&rsquo;re behind someone you have innate physical advantages over the other guy the human</p>
<p>We the human body is set up entirely to to defend threats from the front</p>
<p>We are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. We don&rsquo;t have eyes in the back of our head</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t apply pushing strength backwards</p>
<p>If you get behind someone take downs are 10 times easier from behind someone than they are when you&rsquo;re in front of someone</p>
<p>If you have to take someone down from the front get a hold of both of their legs</p>
<p>If you can get a hold of both of their legs and impart a pushing force, you will almost always knock them down</p>
<p>If you can get a hold of their head</p>
<p>And work takedowns from there again</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier because most of their defensive apparatus is being taken away from them before the takedown even begins</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>For me, the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front double legs</p>
<p>From the front double legs from any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front</p>
<p>So all manner of matte return takedowns are going to be very high percentage</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you and you have either front headlock or front</p>
<p>Chest wrap position are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open</p>
<p>Of course, you have to consider the full</p>
<p>Full spectrum of mechanics involved here. It&rsquo;s possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is much higher percentage</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lot of chain wrestling yet</p>
<p>You know that needs to be considered as a possibility maybe a straight on and part of this cultural too</p>
<p>Are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks?</p>
<p>Are people aware of this?</p>
<p>Are they worried about this? Are they training for this to defend this?</p>
<p>And and then this opponent specific of course that um, you know with jordan boros people are preparing for the double</p>
<p>Which is why he had to develop</p>
<p>A whole other kinds of different stuff and then the head to all the different controls all the different ties</p>
<p>within the rule set</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s so fascinating to see the effect of rule set on all this judo over the past</p>
<p>I think 20 years went through this every olympics different changes to the rule set like fundamentally different</p>
<p>In terms of what&rsquo;s allowed to grip whether you&rsquo;re allowed to touch the legs at all. That was a big one in 2012, I think</p>
<p>And and that changed the sport completely and so interesting</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to watch how tiny change in the rule can change the sport</p>
<p>At the highest when you&rsquo;re talking about people competing at the highest level</p>
<p>and the cool thing there is</p>
<p>The rule change happens on a scale of every four years</p>
<p>So you get to see people that are at the top of their game have to like recompute</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. They have to figure oh shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the equivalent of saying you&rsquo;re not allowed to kick anymore in mma</p>
<p>Because you were not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo</p>
<p>interestingly if you look at the case of judo if you look at the world rankings</p>
<p>of athletes</p>
<p>When they went through one of the most significant rule changes in judo history where they banned any form of grabbing the legs</p>
<p>The ranking of athletes didn&rsquo;t change much</p>
<p>Yeah, that tells you that they&rsquo;re um, there&rsquo;s a reason why those guys are at the top</p>
<p>Yeah, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to do that. They&rsquo;re specific to a rule set</p>
<p>Yeah, think about that in terms of</p>
<p>Imagine for example in mixed martial arts if they just said hey</p>
<p>starting next week</p>
<p>Instead of having three five minute rounds. It&rsquo;s going to be 15 minutes straight</p>
<p>That would massively change the preparation of the athletes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different game at that point and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010</p>
<p>and yet</p>
<p>The international rankings didn&rsquo;t really change that much the countries that were dominant before</p>
<p>Remained dominant the athletes that remained before largely remained the same</p>
<p>You would think was such a massive change all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren&rsquo;t and uh, again</p>
<p>It goes back to this idea that there&rsquo;s a reason why the guys at the top are at the top</p>
<p>And now for something completely different we talked about aliens earlier. Yeah, so uh, george brought up babasar. I I um,</p>
<p>will likely probably talk to babasar on this podcast and then um</p>
<p>Um, and then john had this a skeptical look on his face about about aliens. So let me ask uh, john and gordon</p>
<p>Uh, do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own?</p>
<p>The universe is unimaginably large</p>
<p>the idea that we are the only life forms in a cosmos as large as this is</p>
<p>I think naive and foolish</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet that it could have done</p>
<p>So on many many other planets around the uh around the cosmos</p>
<p>I think anyone who puts even a moment&rsquo;s thought into this would realize that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Almost certainly other forms of life out there</p>
<p>the real question with regards the alien community is um, have they got here and are they</p>
<p>Yeah, circling our planet in um little silver saucers and making observations and periodically stealing people</p>
<p>For experimentation purposes doesn&rsquo;t have to be silver saucers. It could be different other color saucers</p>
<p>Um, and that question i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m not at all convinced. No, I I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>recently</p>
<p>um navy footage</p>
<p>has come out showing</p>
<p>Some very interesting phenomena if you talk to almost any experienced pilot they will tell you they&rsquo;ve seen things in the upper atmosphere</p>
<p>That are very difficult to explain</p>
<p>Uh, i&rsquo;ll be the first one to agree with you on this</p>
<p>There are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain like literally ufos unidentified</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean we just don&rsquo;t know what they are</p>
<p>but to go from the idea that there&rsquo;s things out there that we don&rsquo;t understand to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>Little creatures running around and um, uh, and these somehow exist. Uh,</p>
<p>I just reserve judgment. I just say i&rsquo;m agnostic about these things. I think it&rsquo;s possible but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all the evidence that i&rsquo;ve been showing so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until</p>
<p>Aliens land in central park on tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m</p>
<p>And get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people. I didn&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>Many of the stories that get told</p>
<p>Well, what about if it&rsquo;s not little aliens with ray guns, but something very different very very difficult to detect for us humans</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very human central creature at that point. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fascinating idea and it&rsquo;s certainly possible, but show me the evidence</p>
<p>All right, what about you gordon</p>
<p>Do you do you uh look at the cosmos and ponder the stars often? I think it&rsquo;s fair points. John raised</p>
<p>uh, something really interesting I saw the other day was uh,</p>
<p>Someone posted like if an alien organ or a civilization</p>
<p>65 million light years away</p>
<p>Somehow managed to look at earth</p>
<p>They would theoretically see the dinosaurs because they&rsquo;re 65 million light years away. So like imagine us looking at</p>
<p>Galaxies that are 100 million light years away. That&rsquo;s 100 million years ago. You have no idea what it looks like now</p>
<p>Um, so that&rsquo;s super interesting to me about it</p>
<p>Yeah, the the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there. Yeah, and um,</p>
<p>The scary thing of course is if they haven&rsquo;t visited us yet</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>There has to be a good reason for it</p>
<p>And the the set of scary reasons of all the fact that they maybe once you get sufficiently advanced in your development</p>
<p>You destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now</p>
<p>We more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely in terms of our weapon systems</p>
<p>Um, and we&rsquo;re developing them more and more and they&rsquo;re becoming better and better</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re starting to get angry and anger on twitter and instagram at each other</p>
<p>Those are good points you&rsquo;re raising</p>
<p>History has taught us that</p>
<p>Everything that lives one day will die. So we will we will perish one day. Yeah</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just the the sheer difficulty of um, of</p>
<p>Of travel through space like space is an unimaginably inhospitable</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>And to the best of our knowledge</p>
<p>This even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space even if we could</p>
<p>Travel at the speed of light. We&rsquo;re not even remotely close to that</p>
<p>Still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems. Um,</p>
<p>Very very long if you look at astronauts</p>
<p>Who have spent significant amounts of time in space just orbiting the earth?</p>
<p>It has severe health effects on them. We&rsquo;re just not built for space. We&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>In a gravitational environment, but we you&rsquo;re referring to your biological meat bag that&rsquo;s containing the essence</p>
<p>Of the mind that is john donahoe. Maybe we can transfer the mind</p>
<p>alone</p>
<p>The the the the bag the meat the meat bag is not designed for space</p>
<p>But maybe the but again, this is all that&rsquo;s of the mind. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but what do you think of concrete evidence you folks who like difficult things?</p>
<p>Uh, what do you think about uh, elon musk going to colonize mars?</p>
<p>Is this something that&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>Colonize mars. Is this something you find an interesting or a um,</p>
<p>Aimless pursuit. I think it&rsquo;s a must or a salvation</p>
<p>We need to leave at some point the planet because historically in the past we know that we&rsquo;ve been bombarded by a steroid</p>
<p>volcano</p>
<p>There are crazy things happen here. It&rsquo;s very unstable. You know, we if you look at it to</p>
<p>To a lifetime of a human being it&rsquo;s nothing but just look 12 000 years ago. What happened, you know, so so</p>
<p>There is cataclysm that happen all the time. It&rsquo;s very unstable. So</p>
<p>if we want to survive as a species, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s we need to get out to be able to get out and</p>
<p>spread our seed</p>
<p>so these are the early steps on a on a really long journey, but is there something about like</p>
<p>You know, we we don&rsquo;t get that exploration from most of modern society, you know, the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries</p>
<p>of uh, you know coming to the</p>
<p>North america just throughout we were shrouded in physical uncertainty of what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>And now we get to do the same kind of exploration with mars</p>
<p>Is there so I mean is there any aspect of you that wants to travel out to space that wants to travel to mars?</p>
<p>There, you know, the goal is to allow civilians to travel</p>
<p>Perhaps in our lifetime</p>
<p>Meaning affordably you can do so now unaffordably</p>
<p>Traveling to space and traveling to mars are two different things. I think I would like to travel into space</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would like to travel all the way to mars because of the risks involved</p>
<p>just because</p>
<p>Boring</p>
<p>Is there some part of you that enjoys the I think that if I was like towards the end of my life</p>
<p>I would like to travel to mars because it&rsquo;ll be nice just die just for the experience. Yeah, but if I go to mars</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not coming back. I think that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>one way ticket</p>
<p>May with the technology we have now maybe in the future maybe our</p>
<p>The children of our children will will be able to to experience that to go to the well the the weekend on mars</p>
<p>Uh, well the the whole design of the starship that spacex is working on is supposed to come back</p>
<p>Supposed to be reusable. So it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a one way ticket. That&rsquo;s the whole point</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always going back and forth back and forth. What&rsquo;s the time frame between two planets?</p>
<p>Like to travel from I think the current thing you&rsquo;d be stuck on mars for two years</p>
<p>But how long does it take to get from earth to mars? Oh, it&rsquo;s pretty I&rsquo;m not exactly sure but it&rsquo;s pretty quick</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty quick. Like, uh, I don&rsquo;t know and the scale of months not scale of years. You might not be healthy</p>
<p>When you come back, you know, all the astronauts they experience health issues, you know, they lose a lot of muscle mass bone density. So</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think the technology is good right now. I mean</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that it is I would love to be doing it for a weekend if it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>I would love to be the first one to do it for a professional fighter who sacrifices body for something</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sacrifice we do in life, right? I don&rsquo;t want to be the first I wouldn&rsquo;t want to I least</p>
<p>The other one but when I know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s safe. Okay, count me in</p>
<p>So one of the things that people say and this is something I wonder about is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having children or something once you see once you&rsquo;re out in space and you look out and you see earth</p>
<p>You look back at earth. That&rsquo;s an experience. It&rsquo;s not like anything else like you can&rsquo;t replicate it here</p>
<p>Um is to look back at that like blue dot</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s nerve wracking</p>
<p>Like you see like earth disappear into the distance. Yeah. Yeah disappear</p>
<p>Into the distance and then you get to actually stand on mars and see</p>
<p>And just to look you&rsquo;re standing on the ground and you&rsquo;re looking out</p>
<p>And you see the planet from which you came and where you might not be coming back</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a challenge to the whole thing. Whereas the risk is tremendous</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know I find that risk really compelling for some reason but that could be just</p>
<p>The exploration like I guess that&rsquo;s a genetic thing too. How much do you want to explore?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense though in which even in the best case scenario where they did get the technology to whisk you to mars and</p>
<p>in a</p>
<p>fairly short period of time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an inauthentic sense of exploration because</p>
<p>your participation in it is</p>
<p>no more exciting than your</p>
<p>Participation in an airline flight to a foreign country. You&rsquo;re basically you</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the creation of the of the vessel. You&rsquo;re not in command of the vessel. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>In any way shape or form important to the mission</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a person sitting in a passenger seat</p>
<p>And you get off in a destination the same way you would if you flew to singapore or london or someplace like that</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a hierarchy of there&rsquo;s a leadership and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that all have roles</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hierarchy of there&rsquo;s a leadership and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of people and they all have roles</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to go to mars without having a skill set to contribute</p>
<p>You made it sound like space tourism where you just pay a ticket</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t I think it&rsquo;s a long time before you have space tourism to mars. We have nothing to contribute</p>
<p>Okay, like you will have to tell what you do you go through like a training program you go training program and then there&rsquo;s uh,</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technical things you&rsquo;ll be contributing. So they would bring</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>You know in terms of agriculture, I don&rsquo;t know. Okay, so this is this is better</p>
<p>This sounds like they&rsquo;re actual they&rsquo;re more like explorers like if you talked before about</p>
<p>explorers and and human history where</p>
<p>Magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function. They were they were all</p>
<p>Into the mission in a very authentic fashion if they weren&rsquo;t on the boat the performance of the crew would somehow suffer</p>
<p>So this sounds much better and just with like with Magellan. I think most of the crew died</p>
<p>A significant number did yeah</p>
<p>And from uh, yeah from bacteria, I mean from things that are unexpected and so on and if we discover life on mars</p>
<p>I mean, who knows what that entails because that&rsquo;s like a manned mission to mars</p>
<p>Would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of um</p>
<p>Exploration required to find life now from uh, mr. Musk&rsquo;s, uh</p>
<p>Uh point of view as a developer presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here, too</p>
<p>is there</p>
<p>some kind of financial benefit to mars missions is is</p>
<p>presumably</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of research and development that would require</p>
<p>This is there some kind of mining on mars of minerals that would be useful</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of answers to this but the only honest answer is the one that looks back into human history</p>
<p>Where we did a lot of things just because we we could</p>
<p>A lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of innovation that ultimately made our life better</p>
<p>So this is more this is why you have nasa. This is why you have government organizations. Like what&rsquo;s the purpose of nasa?</p>
<p>NASA would answer that by saying okay. Well, we&rsquo;re helping</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re helping launch satellites up there all that they&rsquo;ll have a bunch of answers, but the reality is the programs</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown</p>
<p>and um, there&rsquo;s some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking</p>
<p>That has produced a lot of cool things along the way that were totally unexpected</p>
<p>Like uh, but nasa is funded by public funding the taxpayer</p>
<p>Uh, how is mr. Musk going to fund this? Well currently</p>
<p>most of the funding was the spacex is nasa giving</p>
<p>money</p>
<p>uh to</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re making a competition who can who can get our satellites. We need to go to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know for the space station to</p>
<p>Resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up who&rsquo;s going to carry those quote unquote payloads</p>
<p>But they just need so nasa&rsquo;s paying whoever the heck wants to</p>
<p>uh get</p>
<p>kilograms of thing up into space</p>
<p>Why did this is nasa&rsquo;s specialty? Why did they just give up on that?</p>
<p>Well, they why they realized or mr. Musk came along and then bezos and others that said we could do it for one tenth the price</p>
<p>So why did the why should the taxpayers pay for the why don&rsquo;t you nasa do what you do well?</p>
<p>You know, which is like test out cutting edge stuff. Make sure they&rsquo;re safe</p>
<p>and now</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ve developed</p>
<p>um a car</p>
<p>Let us let us ups and fedex take care of</p>
<p>Doing this at scale doing it cheaper doing it better. I mean that&rsquo;s the argument</p>
<p>And nasa took what they realized is it took way way too long to do stuff</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re investing millions if there&rsquo;s billions of dollars into a project</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the bureaucracy builds up</p>
<p>And the conservatism builds up to where you&rsquo;re I mean you really have to test everything out</p>
<p>So projects take years and then you have somebody like ilan musk coming along and says well, let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>launches every</p>
<p>Every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket. We&rsquo;ll reuse the rocket. That was one of the sort of cutting edge inventions</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dumb obvious idea</p>
<p>Like ilan says why do you throw away the play? It&rsquo;s the equivalent as if you flew a plane every time you threw it away</p>
<p>Why are we every time throwing away the plane?</p>
<p>But nasa&rsquo;s tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s</p>
<p>And yes, well, they did that with the space shuttle, but not not at the scale here that uh, it was the space shuttle was seen as this</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>Majestic amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment with ilan musk is like no every basic rocket</p>
<p>Should be reusable</p>
<p>Nice cut cut cost cut cost. Do you do you think like?</p>
<p>Like the more technology we have the more advanced we become the more</p>
<p>Specialized we need to be like is that for that reason that now they they there&rsquo;s different branch</p>
<p>Like you just explained out now that so they&rsquo;re specialized in this but they left, you know other branch</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the greater and greater specializations. We build up more stuff, which is fascinating because</p>
<p>Is it making us?</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>Dumb in a way. Do you think like like like yeah, I don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>Like you you know, but I use a cell phone, but I don&rsquo;t know how to build it up from that</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that beta males building up this whole society</p>
<p>um, because we&rsquo;re this collective intelligence we rely on each other more and more and</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>I do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>Like i&rsquo;ve been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently it&rsquo;s fascinating it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and</p>
<p>That idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas. That&rsquo;s the one that takes hold for a large number of people</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a consequence of this kind of specialization where it&rsquo;s just a huge amount of experts</p>
<p>But if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence</p>
<p>We we are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to general thinkers</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like extremely good at specific things. Are we capable now to do?</p>
<p>A robot that is self aware</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one the legged one. I uh, it&rsquo;s self aware. It&rsquo;s not self aware</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been listening, but it&rsquo;s not self aware. But do you think a human being is self aware or that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>I mean I ask this question all the time when the robots move there&rsquo;s a sense of</p>
<p>When they turn on</p>
<p>Something entered that robot</p>
<p>Wow, and when it turns off something left</p>
<p>Uh if they move in a certain kind of way and if they&rsquo;re if they surprise you there&rsquo;s certain elements that enable us</p>
<p>to see the magic in</p>
<p>In a living being and some of them I mean we can care we can maybe list them</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the ability to surprise you it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>The ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly there&rsquo;s a bunch of things that you just</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. It just feels</p>
<p>Like it has the magic of what is a living being</p>
<p>And which is what humans have and I try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine?</p>
<p>So when you turn it on enough you feel like it dies every time and he reborn</p>
<p>So for most machines, we don&rsquo;t feel that way. We don&rsquo;t when we unplug things</p>
<p>Things we don&rsquo;t feel that way. I don&rsquo;t know why we don&rsquo;t feel that way. That&rsquo;s an interesting question. But I think when</p>
<p>When the robot has certain qualities</p>
<p>like memory</p>
<p>Like ability to recognize you</p>
<p>Yeah, you start to feel like you&rsquo;re turning off an organism</p>
<p>So so whenever I have like the robots that recognize me</p>
<p>And remember this is important that all the things we&rsquo;ve experienced together</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like holy shit</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a living thing. But does he remember? It feels like a living thing. Does he remember</p>
<p>Your robot does he remember things that happened before you unplugged it? Is it like he&rsquo;s sleeping?</p>
<p>Like is he wake up or is he like that? So right now we start to zero everything. Uh, no, it doesn&rsquo;t start at zero</p>
<p>It remembers everything. That&rsquo;s the key. Every time you like you you unplug. Wow</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s storing the memory, but the memories are basic. They&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, okay, we walked around the kitchen and then</p>
<p>Um, you looked at me. I mean the memories it&rsquo;s like data. It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve experienced it&rsquo;s able to actually</p>
<p>Uh experience anything deep like we humans can but just the fact of memory</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the toaster or the microwave. Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t give a shit about me</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know me. They don&rsquo;t know me by name. They wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my face</p>
<p>As being different from gordon&rsquo;s they wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference and they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Remember the microwave currently doesn&rsquo;t remember, you know, the times i&rsquo;ve been sad or happy</p>
<p>Like what food I put into it</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t remember this when I was being a fat ass or what I was being in good shape and</p>
<p>All just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like shit</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a living that&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s a living thing disappearing. Of course, that&rsquo;s kind of an anthropomorphism we do to each other</p>
<p>But uh, that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>You know that</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that makes me believe it&rsquo;s possible to create. Um</p>
<p>Systems with which we can have a connection that are nonhuman like similar to dogs and cats and so on</p>
<p>It just makes me and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting to me because ultimately I feel like that&rsquo;ll help us understand ourselves</p>
<p>And maybe practice grappling moves anyway, um</p>
<p>Well, let me ask the uh advice question</p>
<p>Uh, now that we&rsquo;re together i&rsquo;ve asked i&rsquo;ve spoken to john. I spoke to george</p>
<p>What what advice would you give to young folks whether?</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>sport like excelling becoming great at grappling becoming great at fighting become a great at whatever sport they take on or</p>
<p>Life in general whether there may be in high school or in college</p>
<p>What advice would you give them to uh, excel?</p>
<p>At that thing they take on I don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;m qualified to answer this because i&rsquo;m only 26</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re at the top you said giving advice to young people. Um</p>
<p>for me, I think the two biggest things are</p>
<p>Are find something that you&rsquo;re both talented in and you enjoy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think that if you enjoy something, but you&rsquo;re terrible at it. It&rsquo;s going to be hard for you to be successful</p>
<p>In life at that given in that given area</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time</p>
<p>Uh if you&rsquo;re talented at it, but you don&rsquo;t enjoy doing it. Um, it&rsquo;s easy to come in</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>train hard for a month or for two months or for a year, um, you can be very talented at it</p>
<p>But if you come in it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s a different story to come in</p>
<p>every day for five years in a row for 10 years in a row for 15 years in a row, um, so I think</p>
<p>I think finding something that you&rsquo;re both talented in</p>
<p>And something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me</p>
<p>How do you find the joy in it? So you&rsquo;ve been training insane amount, you know a lot you&rsquo;ve been doing it for a long time</p>
<p>Um, is there&rsquo;s is there ways to rediscover the joy in it?</p>
<p>Yeah for me initially</p>
<p>It was just learning new stuff, you know</p>
<p>You come in as a white belt and every day you learn you see a different move and you&rsquo;re like, oh man, it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>um, and then when I started to compete more seriously towards my professional career it was</p>
<p>Uh the joy of doing camps and seeing the result of those camps and beating high level athletes</p>
<p>Um, and then it got to a point where i&rsquo;d beaten all the high level athletes already. So</p>
<p>Who am I gonna compete against? Um, so now for me the joy is just</p>
<p>being</p>
<p>The best athlete I can possibly be until I reach my pride which i&rsquo;m hoping is somewhere between 35 and 40</p>
<p>Um, so instead of competing against the other athletes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be bored already because I already beat all the rest of the guys</p>
<p>um, but</p>
<p>I know that now I know that I can be better in a year from now or two years from now</p>
<p>Than I am today and that for me is exciting</p>
<p>By the way, is there some aspect of teaching that&rsquo;s exciting to you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I because you become a better and better teacher over the years. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely uh, I enjoy teaching and</p>
<p>I used to teach</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>A lot before I met john and then I met john and I was like, yeah, I just have no idea how to teach</p>
<p>Um, so that&rsquo;s like a completely different element, uh of the sport</p>
<p>Um, you know doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning</p>
<p>uh and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to</p>
<p>To a vast amount of people is two completely different things</p>
<p>George advice for young people</p>
<p>like yourself</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>First I was I would tell them find</p>
<p>What you want to become what you want to do?</p>
<p>and long term</p>
<p>Use certain things maybe sometimes you don&rsquo;t love but where you want to propel yourself in the future?</p>
<p>Not what your parent your your friend wants you to become what you you you want to become</p>
<p>So one once you find it</p>
<p>You cannot</p>
<p>Doing it by yourself everything that are that is big achievement in life. We cannot do it doing it by ourselves</p>
<p>so what I would say is second thing is</p>
<p>Try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal</p>
<p>Of people that are competent</p>
<p>And people that you trust</p>
<p>You need both competency and trust</p>
<p>I see a lot of people sometime in business. For example, they hire people they that are that they trust but they turns out to be incompetent</p>
<p>So now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business going down the same problem</p>
<p>If you do the opposite you are you&rsquo;re someone that is competent, but you cannot trust is gonna is gonna screw you, you know</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to stay away from the negative build up your team people you trust and that are competent</p>
<p>And I would say the third one is to work to work hard to sacrifice yourself</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to go through hell sometime, but yeah, you have to see the light at the end of of it</p>
<p>You know to keep your dream in mind is going to give you the motivation to go through the tough time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing easy to go work work work. It&rsquo;s nothing you can accomplish without hard work</p>
<p>The fourth one I would say</p>
<p>To invest on yourself constantly</p>
<p>If you do not invest on yourself on whatever you are in which business and sport the game will catch up to you</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re if you become</p>
<p>Champion at something and if you stop improving the other guys that are trying to be champion, they&rsquo;re gonna catch up to you</p>
<p>So you need to invest on yourself and most people</p>
<p>Most athlete they make the mistake when they start to having money</p>
<p>They buy luxury stuff and that&rsquo;s one thing I didn&rsquo;t do when I start making money</p>
<p>I was investing of on traveling to new york trying with john gordon and the guys to learn</p>
<p>What is new in the the game of jiu jitsu? I used to go in thailand train muay thai</p>
<p>In las angeles to perfect my boxing skill</p>
<p>So instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry cars and to do what a lot of guys do because it&rsquo;s a mistake</p>
<p>I I invest it on myself because I know there were people coming they don&rsquo;t want my place</p>
<p>So I want I didn&rsquo;t want them to catch me</p>
<p>And the last one I would say it seems weird I would say</p>
<p>To give back and it&rsquo;s not because i&rsquo;m a nice guy and it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t say that to look good. I say that</p>
<p>When you you make it</p>
<p>It creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people</p>
<p>But when I say give back not give back to everybody to anybody give back only to the the cause that you want</p>
<p>I give back</p>
<p>Not because i&rsquo;m a nice guy. I&rsquo;m kind of it&rsquo;s kind of selfish</p>
<p>I only give back to the people that I want to give back</p>
<p>Because I give back to them and I know that if i&rsquo;m more successful</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be able to give back to people. I loved the cause that that that count for me</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it brings me more motivation because I don&rsquo;t compete</p>
<p>For myself anymore. I compete to help people. I love in a way</p>
<p>So when you you reach the top in your game, you need to find new motivation if you&rsquo;re satisfied is</p>
<p>The end of it your success will go down. So you need to</p>
<p>To find new motivation. What can motivate you? You know, what do you want?</p>
<p>Oh, I want to help this so I need to to be successful. I want to</p>
<p>You know, you need to find reason who what you want to do with your success</p>
<p>So when I say give back it&rsquo;s not because i&rsquo;m not because i&rsquo;m necessarily it&rsquo;s not to be to look like a nice guy</p>
<p>To keep your motivation</p>
<p>to be able to</p>
<p>Keep climbing the ladder even more</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful, george, uh, john</p>
<p>Um, first off the two responses given so far covered. I think the most important things already. Um,</p>
<p>Gordon talked about the the need for an underlying passion and enjoyment if you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build</p>
<p>Skills, which is ultimately everything&rsquo;s going to come down to your ability to build skills</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment which will keep you in the game long enough</p>
<p>To build world championship skills. It&rsquo;s going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that</p>
<p>Um, george talked about the idea of community. You&rsquo;re not going to make it by yourself</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to be able to build people around you and uh, and build a trusting environment</p>
<p>Around you to develop those skills. Um,</p>
<p>What I would add to the the excellent points that both already raised</p>
<p>Alludes to what I said at the start of this podcast. You&rsquo;ve got to be able to identify</p>
<p>some kind of undervalued</p>
<p>Elements in whatever industry you&rsquo;re in and show the world what their true value is</p>
<p>in addition</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go through life</p>
<p>Doing the same things as everybody else</p>
<p>Go through life doing the same things as everybody else</p>
<p>And expecting to get different results</p>
<p>This is straightforwardly irrational and worse. It&rsquo;s even arrogant</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially the statement that i&rsquo;m going to do the same thing as everyone else, but I believe i&rsquo;m different</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll work for me</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t work for everyone else</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying no i&rsquo;m special</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not special. We&rsquo;re all pretty much the same</p>
<p>And um in order to be special you&rsquo;re going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Thirdly I would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be able to focus on one or two things</p>
<p>That you do better than anyone else in your industry</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t learn everything but you can take one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are the better</p>
<p>And you can truly excel at them. For example at the peak of his career</p>
<p>No one in the world was better than george saint pierre at integrating striking and takedowns</p>
<p>No one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground</p>
<p>He had two things that he could confidently say</p>
<p>He could confidently say he was the best in the world at was he the best at every mma skill? Nope</p>
<p>but he was</p>
<p>Absolutely the best at those two skills and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win</p>
<p>the vast majority of his matches</p>
<p>Gordon ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say there&rsquo;s no one in the world better than me at leg locks</p>
<p>He could also say there&rsquo;s no one better in the world than me at late stage defense</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>Submission holds across the board as he went through his career. He started adding more and more elements</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten to an extraordinary degree now where you could absolutely say he&rsquo;s the best at guard passing the best at guard retention</p>
<p>the list just keeps going on and that goes back to what</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we&rsquo;re always introducing new skill sets the day you start saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored</p>
<p>and bored boredom to an athlete is a precursor to</p>
<p>Death by boredom</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re still growing in those directions you&rsquo;ll stay in the game</p>
<p>For very long periods of time. So the main thing I would add to these</p>
<p>statements by gordon and george is this idea of</p>
<p>Of finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is</p>
<p>Understanding</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else. You&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>Almost every great rise in human civilization whether it be groups of people or individuals</p>
<p>Required some kind of innovation. You&rsquo;ve got to look for that new angle</p>
<p>Okay, george st. Pierre found it with shoe boxing early on in his career</p>
<p>Gordon ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they branched out from that from that angle</p>
<p>Add to this the idea that you want to become the absolute best in the world in your industry</p>
<p>In one or two things that make a difference</p>
<p>Find out what they are and focus on those things and you&rsquo;ll go far</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>Gordon george, this is an incredible conversation. Thank you so much for your</p>
<p>Extremely valuable time george as somebody who&rsquo;s become famous in part</p>
<p>By commenting on people&rsquo;s performance</p>
<p>Um, how do you think we did?</p>
<p>How would you evaluate our performance today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not impressed by</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you. I loved it. I learned all the time. I&rsquo;ve talked to you guys. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s great. I loved it</p>
<p>I was very stimulated. I and really enjoyed it. Yeah, it&rsquo;s uh, it was it was something</p>
<p>I really was looking forward to I was hoping that would get together</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so rare that at the same time in history</p>
<p>There will be some of the greats together and the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk like this</p>
<p>This is awesome. And that gordon he would even wear a cowboy hat. I mean, this is just historic</p>
<p>This is like church. You&rsquo;re all getting together with whoever, you know, this is great and all</p>
<p>But the next one is just going to be us just quizzing john on which animals would win in fights. Yes for the whole three hours</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be just so we&rsquo;ll invite joe and you&rsquo;ll just be we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll make it a systematic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a debate between joe and john on which animal would win. John and I we have a thing that we send each other</p>
<p>Footage all the time of animal fight where we are, uh, very intrigue about animal fight</p>
<p>I get them like 3 30 am on it. He&rsquo;s like check this out</p>
<p>Like a rhino taking a like a pig like</p>
<p>Literally, it&rsquo;s not always fair. No, no, it&rsquo;s not ever but interesting stuff if you people would see what we send</p>
<p>The stuff that we they would judge you harshly. Yeah</p>
<p>Harshly. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Thanks so much guys. This is awesome</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with george saint pierre john donahue and gordon ryan to support this podcast</p>
<p>Please check out our sponsors in the description</p>
<p>And now let me leave you some words from miyamoto musashi</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better stronger richer quicker or smarter</p>
<p>Everything is within everything exists</p>
<p>Seek nothing outside of yourself</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time</p>
