    <p>Our card this week is Kyle Burtis, the Eight of Hearts from Florida.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is a special one to me for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, because Kyle&rsquo;s mom, Lynn, actually reached out to us about covering her son&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>And two, because I&rsquo;m going to tell you his story differently than I typically do.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to walk through Kyle&rsquo;s case the way Lynn had to, remaining in the</p>
<p>dark for years about so many things, and then finding out information about her son</p>
<p>and his murder the way no victim&rsquo;s loved one should.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Around 5.30 in the evening on August 15, 2013, Lynn Krieger and her husband Gary were at</p>
<p>a restaurant in Laurel, Mississippi, enjoying a nice dinner after visiting with some family,</p>
<p>when Gary got a text from an unknown number.</p>
<p>He just looks at it and says, I don&rsquo;t know who that is, because it just said, please</p>
<p>call me.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know who it was.</p>
<p>The phone rang.</p>
<p>He ignored it.</p>
<p>And it was a text message, again, if this is Kyle Burtis&rsquo; parents, please call us.</p>
<p>Lynn told Gary she&rsquo;d take care of it, so she stepped outside and called the number.</p>
<p>The man who answered identified himself as a detective with the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office in Florida, where Lynn and Gary lived.</p>
<p>He asked where we were.</p>
<p>And I said, we were in Mississippi visiting family.</p>
<p>I said, what&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>He said, well, where exactly are you?</p>
<p>And I said, we&rsquo;re in Laurel, Mississippi, at such-and-such restaurant.</p>
<p>What is the problem?</p>
<p>Can you tell me?</p>
<p>I mean, at this point in time, I started crying.</p>
<p>I said, is my son okay?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Well, where are you staying?</p>
<p>So I told him the hotel we were staying at, because we will have two local officers to</p>
<p>meet you there.</p>
<p>And I said, by this time, I was frantic.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>Their phone call ended with Lynn still in the dark.</p>
<p>Her head was spinning.</p>
<p>She knew her son was struggling recently with substance use disorder, so she was immediately</p>
<p>worried that he had overdosed.</p>
<p>That worry gnawed at her as she and Gary quickly returned to their hotel and waited for law</p>
<p>enforcement.</p>
<p>Lynn&rsquo;s stomach sank further with every passing minute.</p>
<p>After an hour of waiting for someone to knock on their hotel room door, she was tired of</p>
<p>waiting, so she called the detective back.</p>
<p>I said, nobody&rsquo;s showing up.</p>
<p>I said, what is going on?</p>
<p>I said, please, I can&rsquo;t, you know, we have to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So he said, let me call you back.</p>
<p>After another 30 minutes of waiting, the detective called Lynn.</p>
<p>He apologized and told her what he was about to do was a bit unconventional, but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want her to have to wait any longer.</p>
<p>After the phone, he delivered the devastating news that her 25-year-old son, Kyle, her only</p>
<p>child, was dead.</p>
<p>And my first thought was, was it, I said, was it a drug overdose?</p>
<p>And they said, no.</p>
<p>The second thought was, is it a self-infliction?</p>
<p>And they said, no, we believe it to be a homicide.</p>
<p>The detective asked to interview her and Gary once they got back into town so they could</p>
<p>hopefully start figuring out what happened to Kyle and why.</p>
<p>Of course, Lynn was gutted and overflowing with questions and emotions, but she wanted</p>
<p>more than anything to help find her son&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>So right then and there, she and Gary hopped in their car and drove the 11 hours through</p>
<p>the night back to their home in Lee County, Florida.</p>
<p>Once there, investigators came over to interview Lynn.</p>
<p>Police told her that Kyle had been found by a Lee County electric cooperative worker just</p>
<p>before 12.30 p.m. on the 15th.</p>
<p>He had been fatally shot and was lying in a secluded field in rural Lee County.</p>
<p>Detectives asked Lynn if she knew of anyone who had it out for Kyle recently or wanted</p>
<p>him dead.</p>
<p>But Lynn hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Kyle in two months.</p>
<p>And even then, it was just a quick call from jail.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been arrested for petty theft, and he was asking Lynn to bail him out.</p>
<p>Since Lynn hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Kyle in so long, she couldn&rsquo;t offer specific information about</p>
<p>if he had enemies or had gotten into any fights recently.</p>
<p>But she was able to shed some light on the lifestyle that he&rsquo;d been living for the past</p>
<p>few years.</p>
<p>Lynn explained that in January 2012, she got a call from a friend of Kyle&rsquo;s who said that</p>
<p>Kyle was struggling with substance use disorder and had been abusing oxycodone.</p>
<p>This was the first we ever heard of it.</p>
<p>We never, ever knew he was on any type of drugs.</p>
<p>After that, Lynn convinced Kyle to move back home and live with his grandparents for a</p>
<p>while.</p>
<p>And it seemed like things were looking up.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t long before one of Kyle&rsquo;s close friends suddenly passed away, and he turned</p>
<p>back to drugs to cope with the pain.</p>
<p>Kyle&rsquo;s struggles with oxycodone morphed into heroin use, and soon he was committing petty</p>
<p>theft to finance his addictions.</p>
<p>Lynn said he even went as far as stealing two of their guns and some of her jewelry.</p>
<p>She told investigators that the last she knew, Kyle was living in the Pine Manor area of</p>
<p>Lee County, possibly on the streets in a tent.</p>
<p>According to Southwest Florida Crimestoppers manager Trish Raut, Pine Manor is known as</p>
<p>a particularly crime-challenged part of town.</p>
<p>So Pine Manor is a part of Lee County where you&rsquo;ve got a lot of low-income families that</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t afford to live anywhere else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also an area of Lee County that drug dealers tend to gravitate to.</p>
<p>Some people have called it Crime Manor because of the people that tend to live there.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of sad because there&rsquo;s a lot of really good families who live in</p>
<p>that neighborhood, and they just don&rsquo;t have the financial wherewithal to get out.</p>
<p>And Pine Manor is literally a very small area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking maybe six, seven blocks.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like this big swath of Lee County.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very small neighborhood.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of bad stuff that happens in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now having a good understanding of who Kyle was and the people he associated with, authorities</p>
<p>kicked off their investigation.</p>
<p>And this is where the timeline gets kind of muddy.</p>
<p>The Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office backed out of doing an interview with us, so unfortunately,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t able to walk through every step of the investigation with them.</p>
<p>As far as Lynn knew, her son&rsquo;s case was creeping along at a snail&rsquo;s pace, if that.</p>
<p>Police weren&rsquo;t sharing anything with her unless she called them first.</p>
<p>So naturally, she was growing frustrated.</p>
<p>In the months following Kyle&rsquo;s death, his face disappeared from the newspapers, and</p>
<p>his story faded from the minds of the public.</p>
<p>Lynn worried that his case had been thrown to the wayside because of the high-risk lifestyle</p>
<p>that he was leading up to the point of his death.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the Kyle that Lynn had loved for 25 years.</p>
<p>Before his life became consumed by drugs, Kyle spent his days pouring love and laughter</p>
<p>into the world.</p>
<p>Lynn told us one of her favorite memories of Kyle is from elementary school.</p>
<p>He was nominated for president of his class in second grade.</p>
<p>And so he got up and stood on his chair at his desk.</p>
<p>And being that elections were right after Halloween, he had his Halloween candy.</p>
<p>And he was taking his Halloween candy and throwing it out at all the class and saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got more where this comes from.</p>
<p>Just vote for me and I&rsquo;ll share my candy with you or something like that.</p>
<p>It was really kind of funny.</p>
<p>That charm and charisma would follow him into his teenage years.</p>
<p>He was the kind of guy who got along with anybody.</p>
<p>His classmates in high school would say that he was inclusive of everyone.</p>
<p>Lynn told us that Kyle&rsquo;s friends from high school would send her messages and letters</p>
<p>detailing how big of an impact he had on their lives.</p>
<p>One friend wrote to her in part, quote, I continue to run through countless memories</p>
<p>where something would happen or someone would make a joke and we would be on the ground</p>
<p>laughing until we were crying.</p>
<p>He was almost always smiling, happy and fun to be around.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Long before Kyle&rsquo;s death, Lynn felt like she had lost the son she knew and loved to drugs.</p>
<p>A world that he quickly got swept up in after going off to college about three hours away.</p>
<p>But in the months leading up to his death, Lynn had a feeling she was so close to getting</p>
<p>the son she treasured back.</p>
<p>He had expressed interest in recovery in the past and he was on the right track until his</p>
<p>friend passed away.</p>
<p>Lynn hoped that it was just a matter of time before he was ready to turn things around</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>But whoever killed Kyle stole that opportunity from him.</p>
<p>And Lynn knew that the only way she&rsquo;d ever identify that coward was to make sure the</p>
<p>community never forgot about Kyle&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>So Lynn started meeting with Southwest Florida Crimestoppers, specifically Trish Rout, looking</p>
<p>for ways to renew the publicity and keep Kyle&rsquo;s story in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Kyle&rsquo;s family and Crimestoppers did everything they could</p>
<p>think of to get answers.</p>
<p>They increased the Crimestoppers&rsquo; reward twice, they put up a billboard in Pine Manor</p>
<p>hoping the right person would see it, they did media blitzes, and they mailed out postcards</p>
<p>about Kyle&rsquo;s case to every mailbox in Pine Manor.</p>
<p>But they got nothing.</p>
<p>The families pleased the community seemed to have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Lynn remained determined but was growing increasingly frustrated with the pace of the investigation.</p>
<p>And that frustration only grew in 2021 when she got a call.</p>
<p>A year ago, I got a call from Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, the evidence room, and they asked</p>
<p>me if I had reported a gun stolen.</p>
<p>And I said, yes.</p>
<p>I said, well, we have it here in the evidence room.</p>
<p>Do you want it back?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting ready to destroy it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, has it gone through forensic, you know, just in case?</p>
<p>I said, my son stole that from us back in 2013.</p>
<p>And he was murdered.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, oh, he was?</p>
<p>She goes, who&rsquo;s your detective?</p>
<p>So I gave her detective information.</p>
<p>And I said, how long?</p>
<p>I said, what do you mean you&rsquo;re destroying it?</p>
<p>How long have you had it?</p>
<p>How long has it been sitting here since 2015?</p>
<p>To say Lynn was speechless is the understatement of the century.</p>
<p>I mean, one of her guns that her murdered son had stolen just before his death that</p>
<p>she thought all this time was still MIA had been in evidence at the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>since 2015.</p>
<p>And not only had no one told her, which in and of itself is troublesome, it seemed like</p>
<p>no one thought of the possibility that the stolen gun could maybe be connected to her</p>
<p>son&rsquo;s 2013 homicide.</p>
<p>Like, did anyone check to see if that was the gun that killed her son?</p>
<p>Lynn did some asking around.</p>
<p>And although she never really got answers as to how this thing was overlooked, she did</p>
<p>get her biggest question answered.</p>
<p>Long story short, they did send the gun off for forensics.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the gun that killed Kyle, which part of me is glad.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want it to be our gun that killed him.</p>
<p>It was good to have that answer, but the whole fiasco really rubbed Lynn the wrong way.</p>
<p>If that slipped through the cracks, what else had?</p>
<p>The answer to that question came one year later, when she learned that the gun was only</p>
<p>the tip of the iceberg of things that she hadn&rsquo;t been told about.</p>
<p>In October 2022, the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office released an episode of their podcast</p>
<p>Seeking Closure, Lee County&rsquo;s Cold Cases.</p>
<p>The episode went in-depth about Kyle&rsquo;s case, releasing more information than ever before.</p>
<p>And most of the information released was brand new to Lynn.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story that their podcast told about Kyle&rsquo;s final days and homicide.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to Kyle&rsquo;s death, he was living in a home in Pine Manor that</p>
<p>was a well-known drug house.</p>
<p>He lived there with a few other people, but the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office specifically named</p>
<p>two of his roommates, Jesus Torres, who went by the nickname Choo-Choo, and Choo-Choo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>girlfriend, Tatiana Martinez.</p>
<p>Choo-Choo was kind of the boss of the drug house, but he answered to two other guys who</p>
<p>lived elsewhere, Luis Santiago, aka Bebe, and Bebe&rsquo;s younger brother, Carlos, who</p>
<p>went by Bebo.</p>
<p>Bebe was the underboss and Choo-Choo&rsquo;s supplier.</p>
<p>Now Choo-Choo himself struggled with substance use disorder, so at some point he started</p>
<p>using his own supply, which turned into quite the problem.</p>
<p>Since he was using the drugs he was supposed to be dealing out, he kept coming up short</p>
<p>on the money that he was supposed to be paying Bebe and Bebo.</p>
<p>As time went on, Choo-Choo was racking up quite the debt, and he simply didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the money to pay.</p>
<p>So Choo-Choo came up with a plan to just steal the cash that he needed.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t going to rob just anybody, though.</p>
<p>He wanted to rob Bebe&rsquo;s house, which he knew was ripe with wads of cash.</p>
<p>And who did Choo-Choo recruit to help him with the robbery?</p>
<p>Kyle.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of August 2013, Choo-Choo and Kyle made their move.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, they broke into Bebe&rsquo;s home and stole $3,000 cash, along</p>
<p>with roughly 400 bags of heroin.</p>
<p>Choo-Choo was smart, though.</p>
<p>Before using the money he stole from Bebe to pay back his debt, he checked the bills</p>
<p>for any kind of markings that would give it away.</p>
<p>Now, he didn&rsquo;t find any such markings, so he took some of the cash and paid back his</p>
<p>debt right away.</p>
<p>But just an hour or so after that transaction, Choo-Choo got a call that left him, Kyle,</p>
<p>and Tatiana shaking in their boots.</p>
<p>It was Bebe&rsquo;s brother, Bebo.</p>
<p>And basically, he said, the jig is up.</p>
<p>Bebe had marked the bills in a specific way so he knew that they&rsquo;d paid him back with</p>
<p>stolen money.</p>
<p>Choo-Choo, Tatiana, and Kyle were freaked out.</p>
<p>They packed up everything and moved into a hotel, hoping Bebe wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>But it turned out that that $3,000 they stole would become the least of their worries.</p>
<p>Because they had robbed Bebe, they also got blamed for another recent robbery of a different</p>
<p>big boss.</p>
<p>In the podcast episode, the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office didn&rsquo;t specify who the other big</p>
<p>boss was.</p>
<p>In a soundbite from an interview with Tatiana, it sounds like she says Danny or Daddy, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>Because the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office declined to participate in an interview for this episode,</p>
<p>we simply don&rsquo;t have the answer as to who the other boss was.</p>
<p>But whatever the case, whoever he was, the big boss&rsquo;s house was robbed of more than</p>
<p>$20,000.</p>
<p>Tatiana told the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office that she, Choo-Choo, and Kyle had nothing to do with</p>
<p>that robbery, but they were still blamed for it.</p>
<p>For days, the three of them remained on the run, hopping from hotel to hotel.</p>
<p>But eventually, they ran out of money and eventually had to return to their drug house</p>
<p>in Pine Manor.</p>
<p>As the days passed, Tatiana was getting the impression that Bebe wasn&rsquo;t mad at them</p>
<p>anymore for stealing the $3,000.</p>
<p>It seemed like he was more concerned about protecting them from the wrath of the big</p>
<p>boss.</p>
<p>Tatiana told the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office that she even got a friendly call from Bebe on August</p>
<p>14, inviting her over, but she declined.</p>
<p>She said that she was at the house with Kyle and that the two of them needed to figure</p>
<p>out what they were going to be doing the following day.</p>
<p>Little did Tatiana know, she made a grave mistake on that phone call by divulging that</p>
<p>Kyle was back to living at the drug house.</p>
<p>She was dead wrong about Bebe not being mad anymore.</p>
<p>Choo-Choo got a call from either Bebe or Bebo, and they told him that they were going to</p>
<p>hunt him down and kill him.</p>
<p>After that, Choo-Choo had had enough.</p>
<p>He fled southwest Florida immediately.</p>
<p>Tatiana took that as her cue to leave, too.</p>
<p>But as she was on her way to the airport, she was stopped by law enforcement and taken</p>
<p>into custody.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not clear what she was arrested for, like, did she have an outstanding warrant</p>
<p>for her arrest?</p>
<p>If so, for what?</p>
<p>Again, these are questions I don&rsquo;t have answers to since the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office refused to participate.</p>
<p>But even though Tatiana was arrested, the podcast indicates that Choo-Choo is still</p>
<p>on the run to this very day.</p>
<p>Now, it was the very next day, August 15, that that electric worker found Kyle.</p>
<p>That man was driving around in Lee County when he saw a bunch of buzzards all gathered</p>
<p>around in a field.</p>
<p>He thought it was just a dead animal, but as he got closer, he saw a tennis shoe.</p>
<p>So he called 911.</p>
<p>Kyle&rsquo;s hands were bound behind his back, and he had gunshot wounds to the head, torso,</p>
<p>and right forearm.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office concluded their podcast episode with theories about what happened,</p>
<p>like that Kyle was killed by the big boss for the robbery.</p>
<p>Or possibly during one of his smaller thefts, maybe he&rsquo;d stolen from the wrong person</p>
<p>and they came after him.</p>
<p>Listen, there&rsquo;s a long list of questions I have for the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office after listening</p>
<p>to their podcast.</p>
<p>Like have they ever tracked down Bebe and Bebo and talked to them?</p>
<p>What about that big boss?</p>
<p>All questions I&rsquo;m sure Lynn had as she was listening to the podcast, hearing all of this</p>
<p>information for the very first time.</p>
<p>I did not know there were multiple gunshots.</p>
<p>I did not know his hands were tied behind his back.</p>
<p>None of the names that were mentioned in the podcast, I&rsquo;d never heard them before.</p>
<p>There was one I had heard, and that was only because she put a post on Kyle&rsquo;s Facebook</p>
<p>page that says, I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re gone, I just saw you last night.</p>
<p>But yes, all of that information is mind-blowing.</p>
<p>They never called me ahead of time to tell me any of that information.</p>
<p>As a mom who spent nearly every waking moment of the last nine years thinking about her</p>
<p>son and his case, Lynn was furious that she had to learn all of this information through</p>
<p>a podcast at the same time as the rest of the world.</p>
<p>About a month after the episode was released, the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office did end up</p>
<p>having a meeting with Lynn where they apologized for publicly releasing information that she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And get this, they told her that they simply didn&rsquo;t know that she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Now, in all fairness, Lynn did say that there&rsquo;s been quite a bit of turnover as far as Lee</p>
<p>detectives on Kyle&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>So it is very possible that something could have been miscommunicated or lost in all of</p>
<p>the shuffle.</p>
<p>But that does little to cool her frustration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, don&rsquo;t you have notes of, you know, what people told me and what they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell me?</p>
<p>The way the sheriff&rsquo;s office handled their podcast episode remains a point of irritation</p>
<p>for Lynn.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it was more publicity and more media attention for her son&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Something that she is always grateful for and always seeking out in hopes of getting</p>
<p>justice for Kyle.</p>
<p>Lynn lives every day of her life thinking, what can I do today?</p>
<p>What you know, who can I talk to?</p>
<p>You know, she&rsquo;ll email me and she&rsquo;ll go, hey, you know, have you heard about this organization?</p>
<p>You know, what do you think?</p>
<p>Should we send her?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always looking for another venue, another outlet, another person to talk to, another</p>
<p>group to talk to.</p>
<p>I do admire Lynn so much and I admire her strength and I admire her tenacity.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s never going to back down.</p>
<p>That is to the case&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
<p>You know, and I pray for Lynn to finally get to a place where she sees justice served and</p>
<p>the person responsible in prison for life and she can start focusing on the healing</p>
<p>process because until that day happens, she&rsquo;s not going to be able to heal.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going on with her life as best as she can, but she can&rsquo;t go on to that next chapter</p>
<p>until this one&rsquo;s finished.</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not at a place where we&rsquo;re moving forward.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re standing still and that is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>I know for me, I can&rsquo;t even imagine, you know, Lynn&rsquo;s pain and I talk to Lynn quite often</p>
<p>and, you know, I just, as a mom, I cannot imagine the pain that she goes through.</p>
<p>Lynn told us the reason that she pushes so hard for justice and never lets up is because</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t have any other option.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one else that&rsquo;s going to do it but me.</p>
<p>Is the grief overwhelming?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe I have fully grieved yet because I&rsquo;m so focused on keeping this</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my moments and the last couple of weeks have been really rough, but now I just</p>
<p>try to find ways to keep this out here, to keep it out, you know, in the forefront.</p>
<p>Lynn and Trish hope that when people remember Kyle and think of his case, they don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>think about his struggles.</p>
<p>They hope he&rsquo;s also remembered for all the good that he brought into the world and the</p>
<p>lives of those around him.</p>
<p>Kyle was a good kid.</p>
<p>Kyle made some bad decisions, but he was a good kid.</p>
<p>He had a family and friends that loved him insanely.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to do right by Kyle.</p>
<p>With every year that passes, we hope people change, you know, people that were hanging</p>
<p>around Kyle and doing some things they shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing nine years ago, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of growing up to do in nine years.</p>
<p>And we know that the answers are out there, but the people that were involved in Kyle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>circle aren&rsquo;t ones to be good citizens and to speak up about things that they see or</p>
<p>hear or know are going wrong.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been a point of contention in this case, because when you&rsquo;re dealing with people</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t necessarily on the up and up, it&rsquo;s very difficult to get the truth.</p>
<p>And, you know, every year that passes, every August that passes, you know, we always hope</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to be here next August talking about it&rsquo;s the anniversary again, but every</p>
<p>year we find ourselves in the same position and it&rsquo;s beyond frustrating and upsetting.</p>
<p>Lynn and the rest of Kyle&rsquo;s friends and family have waited nearly a decade for justice.</p>
<p>It is time they get some answers.</p>
