    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder, co chairman,</p>
<p>and co chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates,</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>and most successful investment firms</p>
<p>that is famous for the principles of radical truth</p>
<p>and transparency that underlies culture.</p>
<p>Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the world</p>
<p>with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics</p>
<p>of how he made that wealth.</p>
<p>His ideas that are applicable to everyone</p>
<p>are brilliantly summarized in his book, Principles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also even further condensed</p>
<p>on several other platforms, including YouTube,</p>
<p>where, for example, the 30 minute video titled</p>
<p>How the Economic Machine Works</p>
<p>is one of the best educational videos</p>
<p>I personally have ever seen on YouTube.</p>
<p>Once again, you may have noticed</p>
<p>that the people I&rsquo;ve been speaking with</p>
<p>are not just computer scientists,</p>
<p>but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,</p>
<p>psychologists, physicists, economists, investors,</p>
<p>and soon, much more.</p>
<p>To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,</p>
<p>bigger than computing.</p>
<p>It is our civilization&rsquo;s journey</p>
<p>into understanding the human mind</p>
<p>and creating echoes of it in the machine.</p>
<p>That journey includes the mechanisms of our economy,</p>
<p>of our politics, and the leaders</p>
<p>that shape the future of both.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Most Bitcoin exchanges take days</p>
<p>for a bank transfer to become investable.</p>
<p>Through Cash App, it takes seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock,</p>
<p>which to me is a really interesting concept.</p>
<p>So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that many of you may know and have benefited from</p>
<p>called First, best known for their first robotics</p>
<p>and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating</p>
<p>on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use code LexPodcast, you&rsquo;ll get $10</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>which again is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen</p>
<p>inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering</p>
<p>a better world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>Truth or more precisely an accurate understanding</p>
<p>of reality is the essential foundation of any good outcome.</p>
<p>I believe you&rsquo;ve said that.</p>
<p>Let me ask an absurd sounding question</p>
<p>at the high philosophical level.</p>
<p>So what is truth?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to do something different</p>
<p>than everybody else is doing</p>
<p>and perhaps something that has not been done before,</p>
<p>how do you accurately analyze the situation?</p>
<p>How do you accurately discover the truth,</p>
<p>the nature of things?</p>
<p>Almost the way you&rsquo;re asking the question implies</p>
<p>that truth and newness have nothing, are almost at odds.</p>
<p>And I just want to say that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>So what I mean by truth is, you know, what&rsquo;s the reality?</p>
<p>How does the reality work?</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re doing something new</p>
<p>that has never been done before,</p>
<p>which is exciting and I like to do,</p>
<p>the way that you would start with that</p>
<p>is experimenting on what are the realities</p>
<p>and the premises that you&rsquo;re using on that</p>
<p>and how to stress test those types of things.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re talking about is instead</p>
<p>the fact of how do you deal with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never been done before</p>
<p>and deal with the associated probabilities.</p>
<p>And so I think in that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let something that&rsquo;s never been done before</p>
<p>stand in the way of you doing that particular thing.</p>
<p>You have, because almost the only way</p>
<p>that you understand what truth is,</p>
<p>is through experimentation.</p>
<p>And so when you go out and experiment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot more about what truth is.</p>
<p>But the essence of what I&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>when you take a look at that, use truth,</p>
<p>find out what the realities are as a foundation,</p>
<p>do the independent thinking,</p>
<p>do the experimentation to find out what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and change and keep going after that.</p>
<p>So I think that when you&rsquo;re thinking about it</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;re thinking about it,</p>
<p>that almost implies that you&rsquo;re letting people</p>
<p>almost say that they&rsquo;re reliant</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s been discovered before to find out what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s been discovered before is often not true, right?</p>
<p>Conventional view of what is true is very often wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go in ups and downs and I mean, there are fads</p>
<p>and okay, this thing, it goes this way and that way.</p>
<p>And so definitions of truths that are conventional</p>
<p>are not the thing to go by.</p>
<p>How do you know the thing that has been done before</p>
<p>that it might succeed?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to do whatever homework that you have</p>
<p>in order to try to get a foundation.</p>
<p>And then to go into worlds of not knowing</p>
<p>and you go into the world of not knowing,</p>
<p>but not stupidly, not naively, you know,</p>
<p>you go into that world of not knowing</p>
<p>and then you do experimenting and you learn what truth is</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s possible through that process.</p>
<p>I describe it as a five step process.</p>
<p>The first step is you go after your goals.</p>
<p>The second step is you identify the problems</p>
<p>that stand in the way of you getting to your goals.</p>
<p>The third step is you diagnose those</p>
<p>to get at the root cause of those.</p>
<p>Then the fourth step is then now that you know</p>
<p>the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those</p>
<p>and then you follow through and do the designs</p>
<p>you set out to do and it&rsquo;s the experimentation.</p>
<p>I think that what happens to people mostly</p>
<p>is that they try to decide whether they&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>successful or not ahead of doing it</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know how to do the process well</p>
<p>because the nature of your questions are along those lines</p>
<p>like how do you know?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t know, but a practical person</p>
<p>who is also used to making dreams happen</p>
<p>knows how to do that process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given personality tests to shapers.</p>
<p>So the person, what I mean by a shaper is a person</p>
<p>who can take something from visualization,</p>
<p>they have an audacious goal and then they go</p>
<p>from visualization to actualization, building it out.</p>
<p>That includes Elon Musk, I gave him the personality test,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given it to Bill Gates and I&rsquo;ve given it to many,</p>
<p>many such shapers and they know that process</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about, they experience it</p>
<p>which is a process essentially of knowing</p>
<p>how to go from an audacious goal</p>
<p>but not in a ridiculous way, not a dream</p>
<p>and then to do that learning along the way</p>
<p>that allows them in a very practical way</p>
<p>to learn very rapidly as they&rsquo;re moving toward that goal.</p>
<p>So the call to adventure, the adventure starts</p>
<p>not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation</p>
<p>but using what, instinct?</p>
<p>How do you dive in?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about.</p>
<p>It is being a, it&rsquo;s simultaneously being a dreamer</p>
<p>and a realist, it&rsquo;s to know how to do that well.</p>
<p>The pull comes from a pull to adventure.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s genetics and how much is environment</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a early on, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting</p>
<p>and so one feels that, then one gets in the habit</p>
<p>of doing that, okay, how do I know?</p>
<p>How do I learn very well and then how do I imagine</p>
<p>and then how do I experiment to go from that imagination?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that process that one, and then one,</p>
<p>the more one does it, the better one becomes at it.</p>
<p>You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.</p>
<p>What, who are the shapers that you find yourself</p>
<p>thinking about when you&rsquo;re constructing these ideas?</p>
<p>The ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you.</p>
<p>Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody</p>
<p>who comes up with a great visualization,</p>
<p>usually a really unique visualization</p>
<p>and then actually builds it out and makes the world different,</p>
<p>changes the world in that kind of a way.</p>
<p>So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce,</p>
<p>Chris Anderson with TED, Mohammed Yunus</p>
<p>with social enterprise and philanthropy,</p>
<p>Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone,</p>
<p>there are, all domains have shapers who have the ability</p>
<p>to visualize and make extraordinary things happen.</p>
<p>What are the commonalities between some of them?</p>
<p>The commonalities are, first of all,</p>
<p>the excitement of something new, that call to adventure,</p>
<p>and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn.</p>
<p>The capacity then, they&rsquo;re able to be,</p>
<p>in many ways, full rage.</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re able to go</p>
<p>from the big, big picture down to the detail.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, for example, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>he describes, he gets a lot of money</p>
<p>from selling PayPal, his interest in PayPal.</p>
<p>He said, why isn&rsquo;t anybody going to Mars or outer space?</p>
<p>What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?</p>
<p>And how are we gonna get that?</p>
<p>And nobody&rsquo;s paying attention to that.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>He then reads and learns and so on.</p>
<p>Says, I&rsquo;m gonna take, okay, half of my money,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna put it in there,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do this thing, and he learns,</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got creative, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one dimension.</p>
<p>So he gave me the keys to his car,</p>
<p>but this was just early days in Tesla,</p>
<p>and he then points out the details.</p>
<p>Okay, if you push this button here, it&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>the detail that, so he&rsquo;s simultaneously talking</p>
<p>about the big, the big, big, big picture.</p>
<p>Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?</p>
<p>But he will then be able to take it down into the detail</p>
<p>so he can go, let&rsquo;s call it helicoptering.</p>
<p>He can go up, he can go down,</p>
<p>and see things at those types of perspective.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve seen that with the other shapers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a common thing that they can do that.</p>
<p>Another important difference that they have in mind</p>
<p>is how they deal with people.</p>
<p>I mean, meaning there&rsquo;s nothing more important</p>
<p>than achieving the mission.</p>
<p>And so what they have in common is that there&rsquo;s a test</p>
<p>that I give these personality tests,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very helpful for understanding people.</p>
<p>And so I gave it to all these shapers.</p>
<p>And one of the things in workplace inventory test</p>
<p>is this test, and it has a category called concern for others.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all having concern for others.</p>
<p>This includes Muhammad Yunus,</p>
<p>who invented microfinance, social enterprise,</p>
<p>impact investing, as Muhammad Yunus received</p>
<p>the Nobel Peace Prize for this,</p>
<p>the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>One of the, a fortune determined,</p>
<p>one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s built all sorts of businesses to give back money</p>
<p>in social enterprise, a remarkable man.</p>
<p>He has nobody that I know practically</p>
<p>could have more concern for others.</p>
<p>He lives a life of a saint.</p>
<p>I mean, a very modest lifestyle,</p>
<p>and he puts all his money into trying to help others.</p>
<p>And he tests low on what&rsquo;s called concern for others,</p>
<p>because what it really, those questions under that</p>
<p>are questions about conflict to get at the mission.</p>
<p>So they all, Jeffrey Canada,</p>
<p>who changed Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone</p>
<p>and developed that to take children in Harlem</p>
<p>and get them well taken care of,</p>
<p>not only just in their education, but their whole lives.</p>
<p>Harlem, him also, concern for others.</p>
<p>What they mean is that they can see</p>
<p>whether though individuals are performing at a level</p>
<p>that an extremely high level</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary to make those dreams happen.</p>
<p>So when you think of, let&rsquo;s say Steve Jobs was famous</p>
<p>for being difficult with people and so on,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t speak personally to that,</p>
<p>but his comments on, do you have A players?</p>
<p>And if you have A players, if you put in B players,</p>
<p>pretty soon you&rsquo;ll have C players and so on.</p>
<p>That is a common element of them,</p>
<p>holding people to high standards</p>
<p>and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.</p>
<p>What do you think about that kind of idea?</p>
<p>Sorry to pause on that for a second,</p>
<p>that the A, B, and C players,</p>
<p>and the importance of, so when you have a mission,</p>
<p>to really only have A players</p>
<p>and be sort of aggressively filtering for that?</p>
<p>Yes, but I think that there are all different ways</p>
<p>of being A players.</p>
<p>And I think, in order to grade a great team,</p>
<p>you have to appreciate all the differences</p>
<p>in ways of being A players, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>And then you always have to be super excellent,</p>
<p>in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent</p>
<p>with people to help them understand each other themselves</p>
<p>and get in sync with them about what&rsquo;s true about them</p>
<p>and their circumstances and how they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re having a fabulous</p>
<p>personal development experience at the same time</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re dealing with them.</p>
<p>So when I say that they&rsquo;re all different ways,</p>
<p>this is one of the then qualities,</p>
<p>you asked me what are the qualities.</p>
<p>So one of the third qualities that I would say</p>
<p>is to know how to deal well with your not knowing</p>
<p>and to be able to get the best expertise</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re a great orchestrator of different ways,</p>
<p>so that the people who are really, really successful,</p>
<p>unlike most people believe that they&rsquo;re successful</p>
<p>because of what they know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re even more successful</p>
<p>by being able to effectively learn from others</p>
<p>and tap into the skills of people</p>
<p>who see things different from them.</p>
<p>Brilliant, so how do you win that personality</p>
<p>being first of all, open to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other people see things differently than you,</p>
<p>and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision?</p>
<p>Is there just the psychology of that?</p>
<p>Do you see a tension there between the confidence</p>
<p>and the open mindedness?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s funny because I think we grow up thinking</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a tension there, right?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a confidence</p>
<p>and the more confidence that you have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tension with the open mindedness</p>
<p>and not being sure, okay?</p>
<p>Confident and accurate</p>
<p>are almost negatively correlated to many people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re extremely confident and they&rsquo;re often inaccurate.</p>
<p>And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people</p>
<p>is not realizing how those things to go together</p>
<p>because instead it&rsquo;s really that by saying I know a lot</p>
<p>and how do I know I&rsquo;m still not wrong?</p>
<p>And how do I take that the best thinking available to me</p>
<p>and then raise my probability of learning?</p>
<p>All these people think for themselves, okay?</p>
<p>I mean, meaning they&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>but they take in like vacuum cleaners,</p>
<p>they take in ideas of others,</p>
<p>they stress test their ideas with others,</p>
<p>they assess what comes back to them</p>
<p>in the form of other thinking</p>
<p>and they also know what they&rsquo;re not good at</p>
<p>and what other people who are good at the things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not good at,</p>
<p>they know how to get those people</p>
<p>and be successful all around</p>
<p>because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads</p>
<p>and that I think is one of the great differences.</p>
<p>So the reason my company has been successful</p>
<p>in terms of this is because of an idea</p>
<p>meritocratic decision making a process</p>
<p>by which you can get the best ideas.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s an idea meritocracy?</p>
<p>An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas</p>
<p>that are available out there</p>
<p>and to work together with other people in the team</p>
<p>to achieve that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible process that you describe</p>
<p>in several places to arrive at the truth,</p>
<p>but I apologize if I&rsquo;m romanticizing the notion,</p>
<p>but let me linger on it.</p>
<p>Just having enough self belief,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a self delusion there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p>You talk about in the journey,</p>
<p>maybe the trials or the abyss.</p>
<p>Do you think there is value to diluting yourself?</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re calling delusion</p>
<p>is a bad word for uncertainty, okay?</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>because we keep coming back to the question,</p>
<p>how would you know and all of those things?</p>
<p>No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you,</p>
<p>that you have to find out truth, okay?</p>
<p>To deal with uncertainty, not saying,</p>
<p>listen, I have this dream</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to get that dream.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my book principles</p>
<p>and described the process in a more complete way</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;re gonna be able to go here.</p>
<p>But what happens is I say, you form your dreams first</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t judge</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re going to achieve those dreams</p>
<p>because you haven&rsquo;t learned</p>
<p>the things that you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>on the way toward those dreams, okay?</p>
<p>So that isn&rsquo;t delusion.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use delusion.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re overemphasizing the importance</p>
<p>of knowing whether you&rsquo;re going to succeed or not.</p>
<p>Get rid of that, okay?</p>
<p>If you can get rid of that and say,</p>
<p>okay, no, I can have that dream,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so realistic in the notion of finding out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, I&rsquo;m a great learner, I&rsquo;m a great experimenter.</p>
<p>Along the way, you&rsquo;ll do those experiments</p>
<p>which will teach you more truths</p>
<p>and more learning about the reality</p>
<p>so that you can get your dreams.</p>
<p>Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay?</p>
<p>And you think delusion&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>No, the delusion isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse delusion with not knowing.</p>
<p>Yes, but nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss,</p>
<p>we can look at your own that you describe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult psychologically for people.</p>
<p>So many people quit.</p>
<p>Many people choose a path that is more comfortable.</p>
<p>The heartbreak of that breaks people.</p>
<p>So if you have the dream</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this cycle of learning, setting a goal,</p>
<p>and so on, what&rsquo;s your value for the psychology</p>
<p>of just being broken by these difficult moments?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s classically the defining moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like evolution taking care of,</p>
<p>okay, now you crash, you&rsquo;re in the abyss.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And then the question is, what do you do?</p>
<p>And it sorts people, okay?</p>
<p>And some people get off the field</p>
<p>and they say, oh, I don&rsquo;t like this and so on.</p>
<p>And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis</p>
<p>and it changes their approach to learning.</p>
<p>The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.</p>
<p>You should take an audacious dreamer,</p>
<p>guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay,</p>
<p>and then come out of that crashing and saying,</p>
<p>okay, I can be audacious</p>
<p>and scared that I&rsquo;m gonna be wrong at the same time.</p>
<p>And then how do I do that?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t lose your audaciousness</p>
<p>and you keep going after your big goal,</p>
<p>and at the same time you say,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m worried that I&rsquo;m gonna be wrong,</p>
<p>you gain your radical open mindedness</p>
<p>that allows you to take in the things,</p>
<p>that allows you to go to the next level of being successful.</p>
<p>So your own process, I mean, you&rsquo;ve talked about it before,</p>
<p>but it would be great if you can describe it</p>
<p>because our darkest moments</p>
<p>are perhaps the most interesting.</p>
<p>So your own with the prediction of another depression.</p>
<p>Economic depression.</p>
<p>Yes, I apologize, economic depression.</p>
<p>Can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking,</p>
<p>planning, strategizing at those moments?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?</p>
<p>Building my little company.</p>
<p>This is in 1981, 82.</p>
<p>I had calculated that American banks</p>
<p>had given a lot more money to, lent a lot more money</p>
<p>to Latin American countries</p>
<p>than those countries were gonna pay back,</p>
<p>and that they would have a debt crisis,</p>
<p>and that this had sent the economy tumbling,</p>
<p>and that was an extremely controversial point of view.</p>
<p>Then it started to happen, and it happened,</p>
<p>and Mexico defaulted in August 1982.</p>
<p>I thought that there was gonna be an economic collapse</p>
<p>that was gonna follow</p>
<p>because there was a series of the other countries,</p>
<p>it was just playing out as I had imagined,</p>
<p>and that couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>
<p>That was the exact bottom in the stock market</p>
<p>because central banks eased monetary policy, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong,</p>
<p>and I was very publicly wrong and all of that,</p>
<p>and I lost money for me, and I lost money for my clients,</p>
<p>and I only had a small company then,</p>
<p>but these were close people, I had to let them go.</p>
<p>I was down to me as the last person.</p>
<p>I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad</p>
<p>to help to pay for my family bills, very painful,</p>
<p>and at the same time, I would say it definitely</p>
<p>was one of the best things that ever happened to me,</p>
<p>maybe the best thing from happened to me,</p>
<p>because it changed my approach to decision making.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>In other words, I kept saying, okay,</p>
<p>how do I know whether I&rsquo;m right?</p>
<p>How do I know I&rsquo;m not wrong?</p>
<p>It gave me that, and it didn&rsquo;t give up my audaciousness</p>
<p>because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Am I gonna go back, put on a tie,</p>
<p>go to Wall Street and just do those things?</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to do that, so I&rsquo;m at a juncture.</p>
<p>How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?</p>
<p>And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties,</p>
<p>and that taught me, for example, a number of techniques.</p>
<p>First, to find the smartest people I could find</p>
<p>who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement.</p>
<p>I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.</p>
<p>I learned how to produce diversification.</p>
<p>I learned how to do a number of things.</p>
<p>That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.</p>
<p>In other words, person by person, I hired them,</p>
<p>and I wanted the smartest people</p>
<p>who would be independent thinkers</p>
<p>who would disagree with each other and me well</p>
<p>so that we could be independent thinkers</p>
<p>to go off to produce those audacious dreams</p>
<p>because you have to be an independent thinker to do that,</p>
<p>and to do that independently of the consensus,</p>
<p>independently of each other,</p>
<p>and then work ourselves through that</p>
<p>because who know whether you&rsquo;re gonna have the right answer?</p>
<p>And by doing that, then that was the key to our success.</p>
<p>And the things that I wanna pass along to people,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m doing this podcast with you</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m 70 years old,</p>
<p>and that is a magical way of achieving success.</p>
<p>If you can create an idea meritocracy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much better in terms of achieving success</p>
<p>and also quality relationships with people,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what that experience gave me.</p>
<p>So if we can linger on a little bit longer,</p>
<p>the idea of an idea meritocracy, it&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>but especially because it seems to be rare,</p>
<p>not just in companies, but in society.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse</p>
<p>and politics and so on that are really stuck</p>
<p>in certain sets of ideas, whatever they are.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re confronted with an idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than your own about a particular topic,</p>
<p>what kind of process do you go through mentally?</p>
<p>Are you arguing through the idea with the person,</p>
<p>sort of present is almost like a debate,</p>
<p>or do you sit on it and consider the world</p>
<p>sort of empathetically?</p>
<p>If this is true, then what does that world look like?</p>
<p>Does that world make sense and so on?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the process of considering</p>
<p>those conflicting ideas for you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer that question,</p>
<p>but after saying first, almost implicit in your question</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not common, okay?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s common produces only common results, okay?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t judge anything that is good</p>
<p>based on whether it&rsquo;s common,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only gonna give you common results.</p>
<p>If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?</p>
<p>And so that art of thoughtful disagreement</p>
<p>is the capacity to hold two things in your mind</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>The, gee, I think this makes sense,</p>
<p>and then saying, I&rsquo;m not sure it makes sense,</p>
<p>and then try to say, why does it make sense?</p>
<p>And then to triangulate with others.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m having a discussion like that</p>
<p>and I work myself through and I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>then I have to do that in a good way.</p>
<p>So I always give attention, for example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start off, what does the other person know</p>
<p>relative to what I know?</p>
<p>So if a person has a higher expertise or things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more inclined to ask questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always asking questions.</p>
<p>If you wanna learn, you&rsquo;re asking questions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not arguing, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking in, you&rsquo;re assessing when it comes into you.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Are you learning something?</p>
<p>Are you getting epiphanies and so on?</p>
<p>And I try to then do that if the conversation,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re trying to decide what is true,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to do that together,</p>
<p>and we see truth different,</p>
<p>then I might even call in another really smart,</p>
<p>capable person and try to say, what is true</p>
<p>and how do we explore that together?</p>
<p>And you go through that same thing.</p>
<p>So I would, I said, I describe it as having open mindedness</p>
<p>and assertiveness at the same time,</p>
<p>that you can simultaneously be open minded</p>
<p>and take in with that curiosity</p>
<p>and then also be assertive and say,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Why would this be the case?</p>
<p>And you do that back and forth.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing that kind of back and forth</p>
<p>on a topic like the economy, which you have,</p>
<p>to me, perhaps I&rsquo;m naive,</p>
<p>but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex,</p>
<p>the economy, the trading, the transactions,</p>
<p>that these transactions between two individuals</p>
<p>somehow add up to this giant mechanism.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve put out a 30 minute video.</p>
<p>You have a lot of incredible videos online</p>
<p>that people should definitely watch on YouTube,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve put out this 30 minute video</p>
<p>titled How the Economic Machine Works.</p>
<p>That is probably one of the best, if not the best video</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen on the internet in terms of educational videos.</p>
<p>So people should definitely watch it,</p>
<p>especially because it&rsquo;s not that the individual components</p>
<p>of the video are somehow revolutionary,</p>
<p>but the simplicity and the clarity</p>
<p>of the different components just makes you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few light bulb moments there</p>
<p>about how the economy works as a machine.</p>
<p>So as you described, there&rsquo;s three main forces</p>
<p>that drive the economy, productivity growth,</p>
<p>short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle.</p>
<p>The former, productivity growth is how valuable things,</p>
<p>how much value people create,</p>
<p>valuable things people create.</p>
<p>The latter is people borrowing from their future selves</p>
<p>to hopefully create those valuable things faster.</p>
<p>So this is an incredible system to me.</p>
<p>Maybe we can linger on it a little bit,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also said what most people think about</p>
<p>as money is actually credit.</p>
<p>Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.</p>
<p>Total amount of money is $3 trillion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just crazy to me.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m silly, maybe you can educate me,</p>
<p>but that seems crazy.</p>
<p>It gives me just positive human civilization</p>
<p>has been able to create a system that has so much credit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long way to ask,</p>
<p>do you think credit is good or bad for society?</p>
<p>That system of that&rsquo;s so fundamentally based on credit.</p>
<p>I think credit is great,</p>
<p>even though people often overdo it.</p>
<p>Credit is that somebody has earned money.</p>
<p>And what happens is they lend it to somebody else</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got better ideas and they cut a deal.</p>
<p>And then that person with the better ideas</p>
<p>is gonna pay it back.</p>
<p>And if it works well,</p>
<p>it helps resource allocations go well,</p>
<p>providing people like the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and all of those, they need capital.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have capital themselves.</p>
<p>And so somebody is gonna give them capital</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give them credit along those lines.</p>
<p>Then what happens is it&rsquo;s not managed well</p>
<p>in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>So I did another book on principles,</p>
<p>principles of big debt crises that go into that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s free, by the way,</p>
<p>I put it free online as a PDF.</p>
<p>So if you go online and you look principles</p>
<p>of a big debt crisis is under my name,</p>
<p>you can download it in a PDF</p>
<p>or you can buy a print book of it.</p>
<p>And it goes through that particular process.</p>
<p>And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.</p>
<p>Everything, by the way,</p>
<p>almost everything happens over and over again</p>
<p>for the same reasons, okay?</p>
<p>So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again</p>
<p>for the same reasons.</p>
<p>They get it overdone.</p>
<p>In the book, it explains how you identify</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s overdone or not.</p>
<p>They get it overdone.</p>
<p>And then you go through the process</p>
<p>of making the adjustments according that</p>
<p>and it explains how they can use the levers and so on.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have credit,</p>
<p>then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck.</p>
<p>So credit is a good thing,</p>
<p>but it can easily be overdone.</p>
<p>So now we get into the, what is money?</p>
<p>What is credit?</p>
<p>Okay, you get into money and credit.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re holding credit and you think that&rsquo;s worthwhile,</p>
<p>keep in mind that the central bank,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it can print the money.</p>
<p>What is that problem?</p>
<p>You have an IOU and the IOU says</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a certain number of dollars, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or yen or euros.</p>
<p>And that is what the IOU is.</p>
<p>And so the question is, will you get that money</p>
<p>and what will it be worth?</p>
<p>And then also you have a government,</p>
<p>which is a participant in that process</p>
<p>because they are on the hook, they owe money.</p>
<p>And then will they print the money</p>
<p>to make it easy for everybody to pay?</p>
<p>So you have to pay attention to those two.</p>
<p>I would suggest like you recommend to other people,</p>
<p>just take that 30 minutes</p>
<p>and it comes across pretty clearly.</p>
<p>But my conclusion is that of course you want it.</p>
<p>And even if you understand it and the cycles well,</p>
<p>you can benefit from those cycles</p>
<p>rather than to be hurt by those cycles.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know the way the cycle works</p>
<p>is somebody gets over indebted,</p>
<p>they have to sell an asset.</p>
<p>Okay, then I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when assets become cheaper.</p>
<p>How do you acquire the asset?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole process.</p>
<p>So again, maybe another dumb question, but&hellip;</p>
<p>There are no such things as dumb questions.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>But what is money?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned credit and money.</p>
<p>Another thing that if I just zoom out</p>
<p>from an alien perspective and look at human civilization,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible that we&rsquo;ve created a thing</p>
<p>that only works because currency,</p>
<p>because we all agree it has value.</p>
<p>So I guess my question is how do you think about money</p>
<p>as this emergent phenomenon?</p>
<p>And what do you think is the future of money?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve commented on Bitcoin, other forms.</p>
<p>What do you think is its history and future?</p>
<p>How do you think about money?</p>
<p>There are two things that money is for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a medium of exchange and it&rsquo;s a storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So money, so you could say something&rsquo;s a medium of exchange,</p>
<p>and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?</p>
<p>And money is that vehicle that is those things</p>
<p>and can be used to pay off your debt.</p>
<p>So when you have a debt and you provide it,</p>
<p>it pays off your debt.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that process.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I apologize to interrupt,</p>
<p>but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth</p>
<p>when everybody recognizes it to be of value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so you see in the history around the world</p>
<p>and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific</p>
<p>in which they had as money these big stones.</p>
<p>And literally, they were taking a boat,</p>
<p>this big carved stone,</p>
<p>and they were taking it from one of the islands to the other</p>
<p>and it sank, the piece of this big stone,</p>
<p>piece of money that they had, and it went to the bottom</p>
<p>and they still perceived it as having value</p>
<p>so that it was, even though it was in the bottom</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this big hunk of rock,</p>
<p>the fact that somebody owned it,</p>
<p>they would say, oh, I&rsquo;ll own it for this and that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen beads in different places,</p>
<p>shells converted to this and mediums of exchange.</p>
<p>And when we look at what we&rsquo;ve got, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>It is the notion that if I give it to you,</p>
<p>I can then take it and I can buy something with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s a matter of perception.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then we go through then the history of money</p>
<p>and the vulnerabilities of money.</p>
<p>And what we have is there&rsquo;s, through history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been two types of money.</p>
<p>Those that are claims on something of value,</p>
<p>like the connection to gold or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That would be.</p>
<p>Or they just are money without any connection,</p>
<p>and then we have a system now,</p>
<p>which is a fiat monetary system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what money is.</p>
<p>Then it will last as long as it&rsquo;s kept a value</p>
<p>and it works that way.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say central banks, when they get in the position</p>
<p>of like they owe a lot of money,</p>
<p>like we have in the case, it&rsquo;s increasingly the case,</p>
<p>and they also in our mind and they have the printing press</p>
<p>to print the money and get out of that.</p>
<p>And you have a lot of people might be in that position.</p>
<p>Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there.</p>
<p>And so history has shown, forget about today,</p>
<p>history has shown that no currency,</p>
<p>every currency has either ended as being a currency</p>
<p>or devalued as a currency over periods of time,</p>
<p>long periods of time.</p>
<p>So it evolves and it changes,</p>
<p>but everybody needs that medium of exchange</p>
<p>and everybody needs that storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>So it keeps changing what is money over a period of time.</p>
<p>But so much is being digitized today and there&rsquo;s this ideas</p>
<p>that are based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on.</p>
<p>So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end,</p>
<p>what do you think, well, do you think something</p>
<p>like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value,</p>
<p>a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?</p>
<p>The problem with Bitcoin is that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>an effective medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not easy for me to go in there</p>
<p>and buy things with it.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not an effective storehold of value</p>
<p>because it has a volatility that&rsquo;s based on speculation</p>
<p>and the like, so it&rsquo;s not a very effective saving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different from Facebook&rsquo;s</p>
<p>of a stable value currency,</p>
<p>which would be effective as both a medium of exchange</p>
<p>and a storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>Because if you were to hold it</p>
<p>and the way it&rsquo;s linked to number of things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s linked to would mean</p>
<p>that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>And then you have a digital currency</p>
<p>that could be a very effective medium exchange</p>
<p>and storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>So in my opinion, some digital currencies</p>
<p>are likely to succeed more or less</p>
<p>based on that ability to do it.</p>
<p>Then the question is what happens?</p>
<p>Okay, what happens is do central banks</p>
<p>allow that to happen?</p>
<p>I really do believe it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to get a better form of money</p>
<p>that central banks don&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>Okay, a better force of money</p>
<p>that the central banks don&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s not yet happened.</p>
<p>And we also have to,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;ve got to go through that evolutionary process.</p>
<p>In order to go through that evolutionary process,</p>
<p>first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen,</p>
<p>which is to some extent a threat to them</p>
<p>in terms of their power.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>And then you have to also build the confidence</p>
<p>in all of the components of it</p>
<p>to say, okay, that&rsquo;s going to be effective</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t have problems owning it.</p>
<p>So I think that digital currencies</p>
<p>have some element of potential,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of hurdles</p>
<p>that are going to have to be gotten over.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;ll be a very long time,</p>
<p>possibly never, but anyway, a very long time</p>
<p>before we have that, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>get into a position that would be</p>
<p>effective means relative to gold, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>if you were to think of that.</p>
<p>Because gold has a track record of thousands of years.</p>
<p>All across countries, it has its mobility,</p>
<p>it has the ability to put it down,</p>
<p>it has certain abilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got disadvantages relative to digital currencies,</p>
<p>but central banks will hold it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s central banks that worry about others,</p>
<p>other countries, central banks might worry</p>
<p>about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not.</p>
<p>And so the thing they&rsquo;re going to go to</p>
<p>is not going to be the digital currency.</p>
<p>The thing they&rsquo;re going to go to is gold or something else,</p>
<p>some other currency, they got to pick it.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s a long way to go.</p>
<p>Well, you think it&rsquo;s possible that one day</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even have a central bank</p>
<p>because of a currency that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that cannot be controlled by the central bank</p>
<p>is the primary currency?</p>
<p>Or does that seem very unlikely?</p>
<p>It would be very remote possibility</p>
<p>or very long in the future.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one.</p>
<p>When you sit back and you look,</p>
<p>you describe these transactions between individuals,</p>
<p>somehow creating short term debt cycles,</p>
<p>long term debt cycles, there&rsquo;s productivity growth.</p>
<p>Does it amaze you that this whole thing works?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s however many million,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people in the United States,</p>
<p>globally over seven billion people,</p>
<p>that this thing between individual transactions,</p>
<p>it just, it works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It amazes me.</p>
<p>Like I go back and forth between being in it</p>
<p>and then I think, like, how did a credit card,</p>
<p>how is that really possible?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still used, I look up credit card, I put it on,</p>
<p>the guy doesn&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all strangers. It signs, okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making the digital entries.</p>
<p>Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?</p>
<p>And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears</p>
<p>and it all happens.</p>
<p>And what I marvel at that and those types of things</p>
<p>is because of the capacity of the human mind</p>
<p>to create abstractions that are true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imagination and then the ability to go from one level</p>
<p>and then if these things are true,</p>
<p>then you go to the next level and if those things are true,</p>
<p>then you go to the next level.</p>
<p>And all those miracles that we almost become common,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when I&rsquo;m flying in a plane</p>
<p>or when I&rsquo;m looking at all of the things that happen.</p>
<p>When I get communications in the middle of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Africa or Antarctica</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re communicating in the ways where I see the face</p>
<p>on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else</p>
<p>and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me.</p>
<p>So while being amazing, do you have a sense,</p>
<p>the principles you described,</p>
<p>that the whole thing is stable somehow also?</p>
<p>Or is this, are we just lucky?</p>
<p>So the principles that you described,</p>
<p>are those describing a system that is stable, robust</p>
<p>and will remain so?</p>
<p>Or is it a lucky accident of our early history?</p>
<p>My area of expertise is economics and markets</p>
<p>so I get down to like a real nitty gritty.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you whether the plane</p>
<p>is gonna fall out of the sky</p>
<p>because of its particular fundamentals.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about that</p>
<p>but it happens over and over again</p>
<p>and so on, it gives me faith, okay?</p>
<p>So without me knowing it.</p>
<p>In the markets and the economy,</p>
<p>I know those things well enough, in a sense,</p>
<p>to say that by and large, that structure is right,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing is right.</p>
<p>Now, whether there are disruptions</p>
<p>and it has effects that can come,</p>
<p>not because that structure is right,</p>
<p>and I believe it&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>but whether it can be hurt by let&rsquo;s say connectivity</p>
<p>or journal entries,</p>
<p>they could take all the money away from you</p>
<p>through your digital entries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of things that can happen in various ways</p>
<p>that means that that money is worthless or the system falls</p>
<p>but from what I see in terms of its basic structure</p>
<p>and those complexities that still take my breath away,</p>
<p>I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t worry me.</p>
<p>Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime</p>
<p>that really surprised you?</p>
<p>Major disruptions? Oh, all the time.</p>
<p>This is one of the great lessons of my life</p>
<p>is that many times I&rsquo;ve seen things</p>
<p>that I was very surprised about</p>
<p>and that I realized almost all of those</p>
<p>I was surprised about because they just,</p>
<p>they were just the first time it happened to me,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t happen in my lifetime before</p>
<p>but when I researched them,</p>
<p>they happened in other places or other people lifetimes.</p>
<p>So for example, I remember 1971, the dollar,</p>
<p>there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t experience it</p>
<p>and the dollar was connected to gold</p>
<p>and I was watching events happen</p>
<p>and then you get on and that definition of money</p>
<p>all of a sudden went out the window</p>
<p>because it was not tied to gold</p>
<p>and then you have this devaluation.</p>
<p>So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock</p>
<p>or so many of these things.</p>
<p>But almost always I realized that they,</p>
<p>when I looked in history, they happened before,</p>
<p>they just happened in other people&rsquo;s lifetimes</p>
<p>which led me to realize that I needed to study history</p>
<p>and what happened in other people&rsquo;s lifetimes</p>
<p>and what happened in other countries and places</p>
<p>so that I would have timeless and universal principles</p>
<p>for dealing with that thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>the implausible happening</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a one in a hundred year storm, okay?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s or.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve happened before.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ve happened.</p>
<p>Just not to you.</p>
<p>Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve, Bridgewater Associates manage</p>
<p>about $160 billion in assets</p>
<p>and our artificial intelligence systems algorithms</p>
<p>are pretty good with data.</p>
<p>What role in the future do you see AI play</p>
<p>in analysis and decision making</p>
<p>in this kind of data rich and impactful area of investment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer that not only in investment</p>
<p>but I give a more all encompassing rule for AI.</p>
<p>As I think you know, for the last 25 years,</p>
<p>we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms</p>
<p>and so we make decisions.</p>
<p>The computer takes those criteria, algorithms,</p>
<p>and they put them, they&rsquo;re in there and it takes data</p>
<p>and they operate as an independent decision maker</p>
<p>in parallel with our decision making.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a chess game playing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a person with my chess game</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying it made that move and I&rsquo;m making the move</p>
<p>and how do I compare those two moves?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot but let me give you a rule.</p>
<p>If the future can be different from the past</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have deep understanding,</p>
<p>you should not rely on AI, okay?</p>
<p>Those two things.</p>
<p>Deep understanding of?</p>
<p>The cause of fact relationships that are leading you</p>
<p>to place that bet in anything, okay?</p>
<p>Anything important.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say if it was do surgeries</p>
<p>and you would say, how do I do surgeries?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to do surgeries</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>to watch all the doctors do the surgeries.</p>
<p>You can put it on, take a digital camera and do that,</p>
<p>convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots</p>
<p>and have them do surgeries and I&rsquo;d be comfortable with that</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;ll do the,</p>
<p>if it keeps doing the same thing over and over again</p>
<p>and you have enough of that, that would be fine</p>
<p>even though you may not understand the algorithms</p>
<p>because if the thing&rsquo;s happening over and over again</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not asking, the future would be the same.</p>
<p>That appendicitis or whatever it is</p>
<p>will be handled the same way, the surgery, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>However, what happens with AI is for the most part</p>
<p>is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size</p>
<p>and then it puts together its own algorithms.</p>
<p>Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms.</p>
<p>You can either take your thinking</p>
<p>and express them in algorithms</p>
<p>or you can say, put the data in</p>
<p>and say, what is the algorithm?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s machine learning.</p>
<p>And when you have machine learning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll give you equations</p>
<p>which quite often are not understandable.</p>
<p>If you would try to say,</p>
<p>okay, now describe what it&rsquo;s telling you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to describe</p>
<p>and so they can escape understanding.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very good for doing those things</p>
<p>that could be done over and over again</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching and you&rsquo;re not taking that.</p>
<p>But if the future is different from the past</p>
<p>and you have that,</p>
<p>then if the future is different from the past</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have deep understanding,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get in trouble.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>As far as AI is concerned,</p>
<p>AI and let&rsquo;s say computer replications of thinking</p>
<p>in very ways, I think it&rsquo;s particularly good for processing.</p>
<p>But the notion of what you want to do</p>
<p>is better most of the time determined by the human mind.</p>
<p>What are the principles?</p>
<p>Like, okay, how should I raise my children?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a long time before AI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>it has a good enough judgment to do that.</p>
<p>Who should I marry?</p>
<p>All of those things.</p>
<p>Maybe you can get the computer to help you</p>
<p>but if you just took data and do machine learning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna find it.</p>
<p>If you were to then take one of my criteria</p>
<p>for any of those questions</p>
<p>and then say, put them into an algorithm</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it.</p>
<p>But by and large, the mind should be used</p>
<p>for inventing and those creative things.</p>
<p>And then the computer should be used for processing</p>
<p>because it could process a lot more information,</p>
<p>a lot faster, a lot more accurately</p>
<p>and a lot less emotionally.</p>
<p>So any notion of thinking</p>
<p>in the form of processing type thinking</p>
<p>should be done by a computer</p>
<p>and anything that is in the notion</p>
<p>of doing that other type of thinking</p>
<p>should be operating with the brain,</p>
<p>operating in a way where you can say,</p>
<p>ah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>You know, the process of reducing your understanding down</p>
<p>to principles is kind of like the process,</p>
<p>the first one you mentioned,</p>
<p>type of AI algorithm where you&rsquo;re encoding your expertise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to program, write a program,</p>
<p>the human is trying to write a program.</p>
<p>How do you think that&rsquo;s attainable?</p>
<p>The process of reducing principles to a computer program</p>
<p>or when you say, when you write about,</p>
<p>when you think about principles,</p>
<p>is there still a human element</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not reducible to an algorithm?</p>
<p>My experience has been that almost all things,</p>
<p>including those things that I thought</p>
<p>were pretty much impossible to express,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to express in algorithms,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t constitute all things.</p>
<p>So you can express far more</p>
<p>than you can imagine you&rsquo;ll be able to express.</p>
<p>So I use the example of,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s not, how do you raise your children?</p>
<p>Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece.</p>
<p>Okay, at what age, what school?</p>
<p>And the way to do that, in my experience,</p>
<p>is to take that and when you&rsquo;re in the moment</p>
<p>of making a decision or just past making a decision,</p>
<p>to take the time and to write down your criteria</p>
<p>for making that decision in words.</p>
<p>Okay, that way you&rsquo;ll get your principles down on paper.</p>
<p>I created an app online call,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right now just on the iPhone, it&rsquo;ll be on Android.</p>
<p>I tried getting it on Android, come on now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it on Android.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be, in a few months it&rsquo;ll be on Android.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>But it has an app in there</p>
<p>that helps people write down their own principles.</p>
<p>Because this is very powerful.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re in that moment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve just, you&rsquo;re thinking about it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking your criteria</p>
<p>for choosing the school for your child</p>
<p>or whatever that might be,</p>
<p>and you write down your criteria</p>
<p>or whatever they are, those principles,</p>
<p>you write down and that will at that moment</p>
<p>make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way.</p>
<p>And if you have the way that we operate</p>
<p>that you have easy access,</p>
<p>so then the next time that comes along,</p>
<p>you can go to that,</p>
<p>or you can show those principles to others</p>
<p>to see if they&rsquo;re the right principles.</p>
<p>You will get a clarity of that principle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really invaluable in words</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll help you a lot.</p>
<p>But then you start to think,</p>
<p>how do I express that in data?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll shock you about how you can do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll form an equation that will show the relationship</p>
<p>between these particular parts</p>
<p>and then essentially the variables</p>
<p>that are going to go into that particular equation</p>
<p>and you will be able to do that.</p>
<p>And you take that little piece</p>
<p>and you put it into the computer.</p>
<p>And then take the next little piece</p>
<p>and you put that into the computer.</p>
<p>And before you know it,</p>
<p>you will have a decision making system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of the sort that I&rsquo;m describing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re almost making an argument</p>
<p>against an earlier statement you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re convincing me.</p>
<p>At first you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way a computer could raise a child essentially.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;ve described making me think of it.</p>
<p>If you have that kind of idea meritocracy,</p>
<p>you have this rigorous approach</p>
<p>that Bridgewater takes with investment</p>
<p>and applied to raising a child.</p>
<p>It feels like through the process you just described,</p>
<p>we could as a society arrive at a set of principles</p>
<p>for raising a child and encode it into computer.</p>
<p>That originality will not come from machine learning.</p>
<p>The first time you do,</p>
<p>so that the original, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>But eventually as we together develop it</p>
<p>and then we can automate it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying the processing</p>
<p>can be done by the computer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re saying the same thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not inconsistent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying the same thing.</p>
<p>That the processing of that information</p>
<p>and those algorithms can be done by the computer</p>
<p>in a very, very effective way.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to sit there and process</p>
<p>and try to weigh all those things in your equation</p>
<p>and all those things.</p>
<p>But that notion of,</p>
<p>okay, how do I get at that principle?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;d be surprised.</p>
<p>How much you can express.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You can do that.</p>
<p>So this is where I think you&rsquo;re going to see the future.</p>
<p>And right now we go to our devices</p>
<p>and we get information to a large extent.</p>
<p>And then we get some guidance.</p>
<p>We have our GPS and the like.</p>
<p>In my opinion, principles.</p>
<p>Principles, principles, principles.</p>
<p>I wanna emphasize that.</p>
<p>You write them down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got those principles.</p>
<p>They will be converted into algorithms for decision making.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna also have the benefit</p>
<p>of collective decision making.</p>
<p>Because right now,</p>
<p>individuals based on what&rsquo;s stuck in their heads</p>
<p>are making their decisions in very ignorant ways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the best decision makers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the best criteria.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re operating.</p>
<p>When those principles are written down</p>
<p>and converted into algorithms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;ll look at that</p>
<p>and follow the instructions</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you better results.</p>
<p>Medicine will be much more like this.</p>
<p>You can go to your local doctor</p>
<p>and you could ask his point of view and whatever.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s rushed and he may not be the best doctor around.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna go to this thing</p>
<p>and give that same information</p>
<p>or just automatically have it input in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna tell you, okay, here&rsquo;s what you should go do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be much better than your local doctor.</p>
<p>And that, the converting of information into intelligence,</p>
<p>okay, intelligence is the thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming out with, again, I&rsquo;m 70</p>
<p>and I wanna pass all these things along.</p>
<p>So all these tools that I&rsquo;ve found need to develop</p>
<p>all over these periods of time,</p>
<p>all those things I wanna make available.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s gonna happen as they&rsquo;re going to see this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to see these tools</p>
<p>operating much more that way.</p>
<p>The idea of converting data into intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligence, for example, on what they are like.</p>
<p>Or what are your strengths and weaknesses?</p>
<p>Intelligence on who do I work well with</p>
<p>under what circumstances?</p>
<p>The personalized.</p>
<p>Intelligence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go from what are called systems of record,</p>
<p>which are a lot of, okay, information organized</p>
<p>in the right way, to intelligence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be the next big move, in my opinion.</p>
<p>And so you will get intelligence back.</p>
<p>And that intelligence comes from reducing things</p>
<p>down to principles into.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it happens.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition if we look at future societies?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to reduce a lot of the details</p>
<p>of our lives down to principles</p>
<p>that would be further and further automated?</p>
<p>I think the real question hinges</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s emotions and irrational behaviors.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s subliminal things that we want, okay?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s cerebral, conscious logic.</p>
<p>And the two often are at odds.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s almost like two you&rsquo;s in you, right?</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s say, what do you want?</p>
<p>And your mind will answer one thing,</p>
<p>your emotions will answer something else.</p>
<p>So when I think about it, I think emotions are,</p>
<p>I want inspiration, I want love is a good thing,</p>
<p>being able to have a good impact,</p>
<p>but it is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants</p>
<p>and your intellectual wants</p>
<p>so that you really say they&rsquo;re aligned.</p>
<p>And so to do that in a way to get what you want.</p>
<p>So irrationality is a bad thing</p>
<p>if it means that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>in getting you what you want,</p>
<p>but you better decide which you you&rsquo;re satisfying.</p>
<p>Is it the lower level you, emotional, subliminal one,</p>
<p>or is it the other?</p>
<p>But if you can align them.</p>
<p>So what I find is that by going from my,</p>
<p>you experience the decision, do this thing subliminally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing I want.</p>
<p>It comes to the surface.</p>
<p>I find that if I can align that</p>
<p>with what my logical me wants</p>
<p>and do the double check between them</p>
<p>and I get the same sort of thing,</p>
<p>that that helps me a lot.</p>
<p>I find, for example, meditation is one of the things</p>
<p>that helps to achieve that alignment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic for achieving that alignment.</p>
<p>And often then I also want to not just do it in my head.</p>
<p>I want to say, does that make sense?</p>
<p>Help you.</p>
<p>And so I do it with other people and I say, okay,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s say I want this thing and whatever.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>And when you do that kind of triangulation,</p>
<p>your two you&rsquo;s, and you do that with also the other way,</p>
<p>then you certainly want to be rational, right?</p>
<p>But rationality has to be defined by those things.</p>
<p>And then you discover sort of new ideas</p>
<p>that drive your future.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always, you&rsquo;re always at the edge</p>
<p>of the set of principles you&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing new things always.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the intellect is needed.</p>
<p>Well, and the inspiration.</p>
<p>The inspiration is needed to do that, right?</p>
<p>Like what are you doing it for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the excitement.</p>
<p>What is that thing?</p>
<p>The adventure, the curiosity, the hunger.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, if you can be Freud for a second,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in that subconscious?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thing that drives us?</p>
<p>I think you can&rsquo;t generalize of us.</p>
<p>I think different people are driven by different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a common one, right?</p>
<p>So like if you would take the shapers,</p>
<p>I think it is a combination of, subliminally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of excitement, curiosity.</p>
<p>Is there a dark element there?</p>
<p>Is there demons?</p>
<p>Is there fears?</p>
<p>Is there, in your sense, something dark that drives them?</p>
<p>Most of the ones that I&rsquo;m dealing with,</p>
<p>I have not seen that.</p>
<p>I see the, what I really see is,</p>
<p>ooh, if I can do that, that would be the most dream.</p>
<p>And then the act of creativity.</p>
<p>And you say, ooh.</p>
<p>So excitement is one of the things.</p>
<p>Curiosity is a big pull, okay?</p>
<p>And then tenacity, you know, okay, to do those things.</p>
<p>But definitely emotions are entering into it.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s an intellectual component of it too, okay?</p>
<p>It may be empathy.</p>
<p>Can I have an impact?</p>
<p>The desire to have an impact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an emotional thrill, but it also has empathy.</p>
<p>And then you start to see spirituality.</p>
<p>By spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.</p>
<p>You start to see people operate those things.</p>
<p>Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re gonna shut down this idea completely,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a notion that some of these shapers</p>
<p>really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.</p>
<p>Do you think madness has a role in any of this?</p>
<p>Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk</p>
<p>as fundamentally rational?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a continuum there.</p>
<p>And what comes to my mind is that</p>
<p>genius is often at the edge,</p>
<p>in some cases, imaginary genius,</p>
<p>is at the edge of insanity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a radio that I think,</p>
<p>okay, if I can tune it just right, it&rsquo;s playing right,</p>
<p>but if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?</p>
<p>And so you can see this.</p>
<p>Kay Jamison was studying bipolar.</p>
<p>What it shows is that that&rsquo;s definitely the case,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re going out there,</p>
<p>that imagination, whatever, is at the,</p>
<p>can be near the edge sometimes.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to always be.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about automation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been a part of public discourse recently.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view on the impact of automation,</p>
<p>of whether we&rsquo;re talking about AI</p>
<p>and more basic forms of automation on the economy</p>
<p>in the short term and the long term?</p>
<p>Do you have concerns about it, as some do,</p>
<p>or do you think it&rsquo;s overblown?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not overblown.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a giant thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come at us in a very big way in the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right at the edge of even really accelerating it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had a big impact, and it will have a big impact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a two edged sword,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll have tremendous benefits.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it has profound benefits</p>
<p>in employment and distributions of wealth,</p>
<p>because the way I think about it is,</p>
<p>there are certain things human beings can do.</p>
<p>And over time, we&rsquo;ve evolved to go</p>
<p>to almost higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re almost like, we&rsquo;re at this level.</p>
<p>You know, it used to be your labor,</p>
<p>and you would then do your labor,</p>
<p>and okay, we can get past the labor.</p>
<p>We got tractors and things,</p>
<p>and you go up, up, up, up, up,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re up over here,</p>
<p>and up to the point in our minds,</p>
<p>where okay, anything related to mental processing,</p>
<p>the computer can probably do better,</p>
<p>and we can find that.</p>
<p>And so other than almost inventing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at a point where the machines</p>
<p>and the automation will probably do it better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s accelerating, and that&rsquo;s a force,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a force for the good.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>what it does is it displaces people</p>
<p>in terms of employment and changes,</p>
<p>and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.</p>
<p>So I think the real issue is that</p>
<p>that has to be viewed as a national emergency.</p>
<p>In other words, I think the wealth gap,</p>
<p>the income gap, the opportunity gap,</p>
<p>all of those things that force</p>
<p>is creating the problems that we&rsquo;re having today,</p>
<p>a lot of the problems, the great polarity,</p>
<p>the disenfranchised,</p>
<p>not anything approaching equality of education,</p>
<p>all of these problems,</p>
<p>a lot of problems are coming as a result of that.</p>
<p>And so it needs to be viewed really</p>
<p>as an emergency situation</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s a good work,</p>
<p>good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively,</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s dealt with effectively.</p>
<p>So because it&rsquo;s good for the average,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for the impact,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not good for everyone,</p>
<p>and that creates that polarity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gotta be dealt with.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;ve talked about the American dream,</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s something that all people</p>
<p>should have an opportunity for,</p>
<p>and that we need to reform capitalism</p>
<p>to give that opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>Let me ask on one of the ideas</p>
<p>in terms of safety nets that support</p>
<p>that kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion</p>
<p>of universal basic income amongst people.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Andrew Yang, who&rsquo;s running on that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a political candidate running for president</p>
<p>on the idea of universal basic income.</p>
<p>What do you think about that,</p>
<p>giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody</p>
<p>as a way to give them the padding,</p>
<p>the freedom to sort of take leaps,</p>
<p>to take the call for adventure,</p>
<p>to take the crazy pursuits?</p>
<p>Before I get right into my thoughts</p>
<p>on universal basic income,</p>
<p>I wanna start with the notion that opportunity,</p>
<p>education, development, creating equality,</p>
<p>so that people say there&rsquo;s equal opportunity</p>
<p>and is the most important thing.</p>
<p>And then to find out what is the amount,</p>
<p>how are you going to provide that?</p>
<p>How do you get the money into a public school system?</p>
<p>How do you get the teaching?</p>
<p>The fleshing out that plan to create equal opportunity</p>
<p>in all of its various forms</p>
<p>is the most pressing thing to do.</p>
<p>And so that is that.</p>
<p>The opportunity, the most important one</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of implying is the earlier, the better.</p>
<p>Sort of like opportunity to education.</p>
<p>So in the early development of a human being</p>
<p>is when you should have the equal opportunities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important.</p>
<p>Right, in the first phase of your life,</p>
<p>which goes from birth until you&rsquo;re on your own</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re an adult and you&rsquo;re now out there.</p>
<p>And you deal with early childhood development, okay?</p>
<p>And you take the brain and you say, what&rsquo;s important?</p>
<p>The childcare, okay, it makes a world of difference,</p>
<p>for example, if you have good parents</p>
<p>who are trying to think about instilling the stability</p>
<p>in a non traumatic environment to provide them.</p>
<p>So I would say the good guidance</p>
<p>that normally comes from parents</p>
<p>and the good education that they&rsquo;re receiving</p>
<p>are the most important things in that person&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there</p>
<p>and then to go into a market</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an equal opportunity job market,</p>
<p>to be able to then go into that kind of market</p>
<p>is a system that creates not only fairness,</p>
<p>anything else is not fair.</p>
<p>And then in addition to that,</p>
<p>it also is a more effective economic system</p>
<p>because the consequences of not doing that</p>
<p>to a society are devastating.</p>
<p>If you look at what the difference in outcomes</p>
<p>for somebody who completes high school</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t complete high school,</p>
<p>or does each one of those state changes.</p>
<p>And you look at what that means</p>
<p>in terms of their costs to society, not only themselves,</p>
<p>but their cost and incarceration costs</p>
<p>and crimes and all of those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s economically better for the society</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fairer if they can get those particular things.</p>
<p>Once they have those things,</p>
<p>then you move on to other things.</p>
<p>But yes, from birth all the way through that process,</p>
<p>anything less than that is bad, is a tragedy and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what, yeah,</p>
<p>those are the things that I&rsquo;m estimating.</p>
<p>And so what I would want above all else is to provide that.</p>
<p>So with that in mind,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ll talk about universal basic income.</p>
<p>Start with that, now we can talk about UBI.</p>
<p>Right, because you have to have that.</p>
<p>Now the question is what&rsquo;s the best way to provide that?</p>
<p>So when I look at UBI,</p>
<p>I really think is what is going to happen</p>
<p>with that $1,000, okay?</p>
<p>And will that $1,000 come from another program?</p>
<p>Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?</p>
<p>Who are you giving the $1,000 to</p>
<p>and what will they do for that $1,000?</p>
<p>I mean, like my reaction would be,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great thing that everybody</p>
<p>should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on.</p>
<p>But when do they get to make decisions or who&rsquo;s the parent?</p>
<p>A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody</p>
<p>and it could have a negative result.</p>
<p>It can have, they can use that money detrimentally,</p>
<p>not just productively.</p>
<p>And if that money&rsquo;s coming away</p>
<p>from some of those other things</p>
<p>that are gonna produce the things I want</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re shifted to, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>to come in and give a check,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean its outcomes are going to be good</p>
<p>in providing those things</p>
<p>that I think are so fundamental important.</p>
<p>If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it</p>
<p>so when the time comes.</p>
<p>Use it well, right.</p>
<p>And use it well, that would be really, really good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s almost like everybody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d wish everybody could have $1,000</p>
<p>worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay.</p>
<p>And I think that would be great.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>But I wanna make sure that these other things</p>
<p>that are taken care of.</p>
<p>So if it comes out of that budget</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want it to come out of that budget</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be doing those things.</p>
<p>And so you have to figure it out.</p>
<p>And you have a certain skepticism</p>
<p>that human nature will use,</p>
<p>may not always, in fact frequently,</p>
<p>may not use that $1,000 for the optimal,</p>
<p>to support the optimal trajectory.</p>
<p>Some will and some won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>One of the big advantages of universal basic income</p>
<p>is that if you put it in the hands,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say of parents who know how to do the right things</p>
<p>and make the right choices for their children</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re responsible</p>
<p>and you say I&rsquo;m gonna give them $1,000 wiggle room</p>
<p>to use for the benefit of their children.</p>
<p>Wow, that sounds great.</p>
<p>If you put it in the hands of let&rsquo;s say an alcoholic</p>
<p>or drug addicted parent who is not making those choices</p>
<p>well for their children</p>
<p>and what they do is they take that $1,000</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t use it well,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s gonna produce more harm than good.</p>
<p>Well put.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, if I may say so,</p>
<p>one of the richest people in the world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a good person to ask.</p>
<p>Does money buy happiness?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s been shown that between,</p>
<p>once you get over a basic level of income</p>
<p>so that you can take care of the pain</p>
<p>that you can, health and whatever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no correlation between the level of happiness</p>
<p>that one has and the level of money that one has.</p>
<p>That thing that has the highest correlation</p>
<p>is quality relationships with others, community.</p>
<p>If you look at surveys of these things</p>
<p>across all surveys and all societies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>That is not in any way correlated with money.</p>
<p>You can go down to native tribes in very poor places</p>
<p>or you can go in all different communities</p>
<p>and so they have the opportunity to have that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very lucky in that I started with nothing</p>
<p>so I have the full range.</p>
<p>I can tell you I&rsquo;m not having money</p>
<p>and then having quite a lot of money</p>
<p>and I did that in the right order.</p>
<p>So you started from nothing in Long Island.</p>
<p>Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician</p>
<p>but I had all really that I needed</p>
<p>because I had two parents who loved me</p>
<p>and took good care of me and I went to a public school</p>
<p>that was a good public school</p>
<p>and basically you don&rsquo;t need much more than that</p>
<p>in order to, that&rsquo;s the equal opportunity part.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I&rsquo;m saying is I experienced the range</p>
<p>and there are many studies on the answer to your question.</p>
<p>No money does not bring happiness.</p>
<p>Money gives you an ability to make choices.</p>
<p>Does it get in the way in any way</p>
<p>of forming those deep, meaningful relationships?</p>
<p>It can.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways that it makes negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>It could stand in the way of that.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>But I could almost list the ways that it could stand.</p>
<p>It could be a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, what does it buy?</p>
<p>So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot but it takes enough</p>
<p>that you can take care of yourself and your family</p>
<p>to be able to learn,</p>
<p>do the basics of, have the relationships,</p>
<p>have healthcare, the basics of those types of things.</p>
<p>You know, you can cover the patients.</p>
<p>And then to have maybe enough security</p>
<p>but maybe not too much security.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah.</p>
<p>That you essentially are okay.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s what money will get you.</p>
<p>And everything else could go either way.</p>
<p>Well, no, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then beyond that, what it then starts to do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>But beyond that, what it starts to do</p>
<p>is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.</p>
<p>Okay, so for example, now I, you know, like in my case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like those dreams might not be just my own dreams,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re impact on others dreams, okay?</p>
<p>So my own dreams might be, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I can pass along these, at my stage in life,</p>
<p>I could pass along these principles to you</p>
<p>and I can give those things or I could do whatever.</p>
<p>I can go on an adventure, I can start a business,</p>
<p>I can do those other things, be productive,</p>
<p>I can self actualize in ways</p>
<p>that might be not possible otherwise.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s my own belief.</p>
<p>And then I can also help others.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, you know, to the extent when you get older</p>
<p>and with time and whatever, you start to feel connected,</p>
<p>spirituality, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>you can start to have an effect on others</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beneficial and so on, gives you the ability.</p>
<p>I could tell you that people who are very wealthy</p>
<p>who have that feel that they don&rsquo;t have enough money.</p>
<p>Bill Gates will feel almost broke</p>
<p>because relative to the things he&rsquo;d like to accomplish</p>
<p>through the Gates Foundation and things like that,</p>
<p>you know, oh my God, he doesn&rsquo;t have enough money</p>
<p>to accomplish the things he wishes for.</p>
<p>But those things are not, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the most fundamental things.</p>
<p>So I think that people sometimes think money has value.</p>
<p>Money doesn&rsquo;t have value.</p>
<p>Money is, like you say,</p>
<p>just a medium of exchange at a store all the while.</p>
<p>And so what you have to say is,</p>
<p>what is it that you&rsquo;re going to buy?</p>
<p>Now, there are other people who get their gratification</p>
<p>in ways that are different from me,</p>
<p>but I think in many cases,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say somebody who used money to have a status symbol,</p>
<p>what would I say?</p>
<p>Or that&rsquo;s probably unhealthy.</p>
<p>But then, I don&rsquo;t know, somebody who says,</p>
<p>I love a great, gorgeous painting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to cost lots of money.</p>
<p>In my priorities, I can&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean, who am I to judge others</p>
<p>in terms of, let&rsquo;s say, their element of the freedom</p>
<p>to do those things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit complicated.</p>
<p>But by and large, that&rsquo;s my view on money and wealth.</p>
<p>So let me ask you in terms of the idea of,</p>
<p>so much of your passions in life has been</p>
<p>through something you might be able to call work.</p>
<p>Alan Watts has this quote.</p>
<p>He said that the real key to life, secret to life,</p>
<p>is to be completely engaged with what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in the here and now.</p>
<p>And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to ask, what is the role of work</p>
<p>in your life&rsquo;s journey, or in a life&rsquo;s journey?</p>
<p>And what do you think about this modern idea</p>
<p>of kind of separating work and work life balance?</p>
<p>I have a principle that I believe in is,</p>
<p>make your work and your passion the same thing.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a similar view.</p>
<p>In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna work out great.</p>
<p>And then of course, people have different purposes of work.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna be theoretical about that.</p>
<p>People have to take care of their family.</p>
<p>So money at a certain point is the base,</p>
<p>is an important component of that work.</p>
<p>So you look beyond that, what is the money gonna get you</p>
<p>and what are you trying to achieve?</p>
<p>But the most important thing, I agree,</p>
<p>is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Like if you can get into the thing that you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>your mission that you&rsquo;re on,</p>
<p>and you are excited about that mission that you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>And then you can do that with people</p>
<p>who you have the meaningful relationships with.</p>
<p>You have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, that is fabulous for most people.</p>
<p>And it seems that many people struggle to get there,</p>
<p>not out of, not necessarily because they&rsquo;re constrained</p>
<p>by the fact that they have the financial constraints</p>
<p>of having to provide for their family and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I mean, this idea is out there</p>
<p>that there needs to be a work life balance,</p>
<p>which means that most people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna return to the same things,</p>
<p>most doesn&rsquo;t mean optimal,</p>
<p>but most people seem to not be doing their life&rsquo;s passion,</p>
<p>not unifying work and passion.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Well, the work life balance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a life arc that you go through.</p>
<p>Starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80,</p>
<p>and there is a phase.</p>
<p>And you could look at the different degrees of happiness</p>
<p>that happen in those phases.</p>
<p>I can go through that if that was interesting,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have time probably for it.</p>
<p>But you get in the part of the life,</p>
<p>that part of the life,</p>
<p>which has the lowest level of happiness is age 45 to 55.</p>
<p>And because as you move into this second phase of your life,</p>
<p>now the first phase of your life</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re learning dependent on others.</p>
<p>Second phase of your life is when you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>and others are dependent on you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to be successful.</p>
<p>And in that phase of one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>you encounter the work life balance challenge</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to be successful at work</p>
<p>and successful at parenting</p>
<p>and successful and successful in all those things</p>
<p>that take your demand.</p>
<p>And they get into that.</p>
<p>And I understand that problem in the work life balance.</p>
<p>The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?</p>
<p>So I understand it&rsquo;s stressful, it produces stress</p>
<p>and it produces bad results</p>
<p>and it produces the lowest level of happiness.</p>
<p>In one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting as you get later in life,</p>
<p>the levels of happiness rise</p>
<p>and the highest level of happiness</p>
<p>is between ages 70 and 80,</p>
<p>which is interesting for other reasons.</p>
<p>But in that spot,</p>
<p>and the key to work life balance</p>
<p>is to realize and to learn</p>
<p>how to get more out of an hour of life, okay?</p>
<p>Because an hour of work,</p>
<p>what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice</p>
<p>between one thing and another.</p>
<p>And of course they do.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t realize that if they develop the skill</p>
<p>to get a lot more out of an hour,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s why in the book principles,</p>
<p>I try to go into, okay, now,</p>
<p>how can you get a lot more out of an hour?</p>
<p>That allows you to get more life into your life</p>
<p>and it reduces the work life balance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.</p>
<p>If you could linger on that,</p>
<p>so what are the ups and downs of life</p>
<p>in terms of happiness in general</p>
<p>and perhaps in your own life</p>
<p>when you look back at the moments, the peaks?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much the same pattern.</p>
<p>Early in one&rsquo;s life tends to be a very happy period,</p>
<p>all the way up and 16 is like a really great happy,</p>
<p>I think like myself, you start to get elements of freedom,</p>
<p>you get your driver&rsquo;s license, whatever, but 16 is there.</p>
<p>Junior year in high school quite often</p>
<p>could be a stressful period</p>
<p>to try to get thinking about the high school.</p>
<p>You go into college,</p>
<p>tends to be very hot happiness, generally speaking.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>And then freedom, friendships, all of that.</p>
<p>Freedom is a big thing.</p>
<p>And then 23 is a peak point kind of in happiness,</p>
<p>that freedom.</p>
<p>Then sequentially, one has a great time,</p>
<p>they date, they go out and so on,</p>
<p>you find the love of your life,</p>
<p>you begin to develop a family.</p>
<p>And then with that, as time happens,</p>
<p>you have more of your work life balance challenges</p>
<p>that come in your responsibilities.</p>
<p>And then as you get there in that mid part of your life,</p>
<p>that is the biggest struggle.</p>
<p>Chances are you will crash in that period of time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have your series of failures,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you go into the abyss,</p>
<p>you learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,</p>
<p>you have the metamorphosis, you come out, you change,</p>
<p>you hopefully become better</p>
<p>and you take more responsibilities and so on.</p>
<p>And then when you get to the later part,</p>
<p>as you are starting to approach the transition</p>
<p>in that late part of the second phase of your life,</p>
<p>before you go into the third phase of your life,</p>
<p>second phase is you&rsquo;re working, trying to be successful.</p>
<p>Third phase of your life is you want people</p>
<p>to be successful without you, okay?</p>
<p>You want your kids to be successful without you</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re at that phase,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at making their transition</p>
<p>from the first phase to the second phase</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to be successful</p>
<p>and you want them to be successful without you</p>
<p>and your parents are gone and then you have freedom</p>
<p>and then you have freedom again.</p>
<p>And with that freedom and then you have these,</p>
<p>history has shown with this, you have friendships,</p>
<p>you have perspective on life, you have different things</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>that that later part of the life can be real.</p>
<p>On average, actually, it&rsquo;s the highest.</p>
<p>Very interesting thing, there are surveys</p>
<p>and say, how good do you look and how good do you feel?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the highest survey.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re not looking the best</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not feeling the best, right?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s 35 that they&rsquo;re actually looking the best</p>
<p>and feeling the best, but they rank the highest</p>
<p>at that point, survey results of being the highest</p>
<p>in that 70 to 80 period of time</p>
<p>because it has to do with an attitude on life.</p>
<p>Then you start to have grandkids,</p>
<p>oh, grandkids are great</p>
<p>and you start to experience that transition well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the arc of life pretty much looks like</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m experiencing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived it.</p>
<p>When you meditate, we&rsquo;re all human, we&rsquo;re all mortal.</p>
<p>When you meditate on your own mortality,</p>
<p>having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>The meaning of our short existence on earth as human beings?</p>
<p>I think that evolution is the greatest force</p>
<p>of the universe and that we&rsquo;re all tiny bits</p>
<p>of an evolutionary type of process</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just matter and machines that go through time</p>
<p>and that we all have a deeply embedded inclination</p>
<p>to evolve and contribute to evolution.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s to personally evolve</p>
<p>and contribute to evolution.</p>
<p>I could have predicted you would answer that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant and exactly right.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve said it before, but I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>You have a lot of incredible videos out there</p>
<p>that people should definitely watch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this often.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s literally the best spend of time</p>
<p>and in terms of reading principles</p>
<p>and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn</p>
<p>and so on is a really good use of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of light bulb moments,</p>
<p>a lot of transformative ideas in there.</p>
