    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Hi friends, so this week I want to talk to you about breaking out of certain mindsets</p>
<p>You know the ones that like got you trapped to shit and you don&rsquo;t know how to get out of them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to do it. I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>Certain mindset shifts I&rsquo;ve made in previous episodes</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna share with you the process I go through</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m trying to break out of a certain mindset and I&rsquo;m gonna teach you also how to identify</p>
<p>You have a mindset or a belief or something that is holding you back</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to figure out like yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>You know cuz sometimes you&rsquo;re like am I the problem or am I not bitch you are</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just gonna be real honest like I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to spot when you are the problem</p>
<p>Okay, and I am gonna give you like straight-up examples from my life and the biggest one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to break recently which was convincing myself that everybody at the gym fucking hates me, but we&rsquo;re gonna get into it</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all know my brain does its own little thing and it thinks in its own way and it just be making shit up and I have</p>
<p>To catch it all the time, but let&rsquo;s jump into this shit. Okay, so the first thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you is stop acting like you fucking know everything</p>
<p>Okay, cuz when you convince yourself that you fucking know everything you&rsquo;re gonna hurt your feelings like I do it all the time, babe</p>
<p>I get it. I&rsquo;m right there with you. Like it&rsquo;s not a fun road like this whole</p>
<p>Spirituality and like self-development like this is not a fun path to go down like it&rsquo;s a constant like attack</p>
<p>Emotionally from yourself from your higher self from everyone around you it&rsquo;s a fucking gangbang mentally</p>
<p>All right, like I get it</p>
<p>But the first thing is stop acting like you fucking know everything stop acting like you have the answers to everything</p>
<p>Because when you operate from that place when you assume something you don&rsquo;t question it</p>
<p>You just think that you&rsquo;re right and it becomes a subconscious thing</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s unpack all this shit and let&rsquo;s break it down and I&rsquo;m just gonna teach you like the process and</p>
<p>Then throw you the examples of like what I did. Okay, great. So let&rsquo;s do that</p>
<p>So the first way to know that you have something about your mindset</p>
<p>You need to shift is notice when you start feeling negatively when you have like a weird</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re drained. You&rsquo;re tired. You&rsquo;re unmotivated</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like pissy you&rsquo;re sad like any type of negative kind of feeling</p>
<p>Start paying attention to when you&rsquo;re feeling them</p>
<p>Okay, even if it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re tense like just any kind of negative feeling state that&rsquo;s your message that&rsquo;s your messenger</p>
<p>All right. I talked about this before in the being there for yourself episode about your emotions being messengers</p>
<p>But this is the signal that you need to fucking like shift something. So take note of the negative</p>
<p>All right, and then you&rsquo;re gonna ask yourself. Okay in this moment right now</p>
<p>What am I telling myself?</p>
<p>Like what am I convincing myself of so my example of this was being at the gym</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all I hate the fucking gym. I really do like I hate it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a hobby of mine to be into fitness and all but like fuck the gym, bro</p>
<p>Like I literally hate it</p>
<p>Like I have to do it cuz I want to look cute and I want to like live long not too long</p>
<p>Damn it</p>
<p>I want to be out by like 55 like put me the fuck out</p>
<p>But I have to like work out like I make myself do it cuz it&rsquo;s like I know I know I should and I do</p>
<p>It cuz it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a sick enjoyment that I get</p>
<p>Being at the gym like pushing my body cuz I go to failure on a lot of sets</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>like to push my body and like beat it the fuck up a little bit but the whole like getting ready to go to the</p>
<p>Gym and like getting in the car and then trying to find the fucking music at the gym and then being around all the fucking</p>
<p>People at the gym. I fucking hate it</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to think that I like glamorize the gym lifestyle like everyone else does that I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>I fucking don&rsquo;t like it, but I have to go so I make myself go</p>
<p>but I was at the gym the other day and I just felt so tense and like</p>
<p>Like just not good and I was on the treadmill and I was like, alright fucker</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about to go into this right here on this treadmill and I dead-ass almost stopped walking and</p>
<p>Started crying when I fucking went into this don&rsquo;t go into shit at the gym</p>
<p>alright, you don&rsquo;t look like a fucking pussy crying on the treadmill, but</p>
<p>This was the perfect time to do it</p>
<p>So like when you get triggered when you feel that negative state is when you&rsquo;re that&rsquo;s like the everything is right there</p>
<p>Like you just have to ask the right question and the awareness will like pop out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like popping a pimple that already has a head</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you have the pimple that has like it&rsquo;s just under the skin and you can&rsquo;t pop it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like to try and revisit something. You&rsquo;ve been triggered by but when</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re when you visit it in the moment when you&rsquo;re feeling it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the pimples right there</p>
<p>All you have to do is squeeze it and it&rsquo;s gonna pop like why the fuck did I just use that example?</p>
<p>Why the fuck do y&rsquo;all listen to me</p>
<p>so the awareness is right there ready for you if you</p>
<p>Have a moment like when you&rsquo;re feeling the negative emotion to question it right then and there you can just like save it for later</p>
<p>Like put it in a little to-go box and fucking take it home be like I&rsquo;ll revisit that later</p>
<p>You just have to like remember what you&rsquo;re feeling in the moment so you can question it</p>
<p>So my ass starts questioning like what am I feeling right now?</p>
<p>Cuz I noticed like I just felt like heavy and I felt tense and I felt like a lot of pressure and I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>what the fuck is causing me to feel like this and</p>
<p>I just like looking down like at my gym</p>
<p>the cardio section is on the second floor so you can see over into the gym and I was just looking around at people and</p>
<p>I just felt so like you like inside like while looking at people</p>
<p>I felt like I didn&rsquo;t belong. I felt like no one liked me. I felt like people hated me</p>
<p>I was like in my head like</p>
<p>people are probably like making fun of me and like the shit that I post on tik-tok like all this shit was like going through</p>
<p>My head and I was feeling all these things and I was like, oh my god</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize I was feeling all this</p>
<p>I just thought I didn&rsquo;t like coming to the fucking gym and then I realized I felt watched like I felt ridiculed</p>
<p>I felt like a spectacle. Is that the right word?</p>
<p>Like people were just like watching me like I felt on display. I felt watched. I don&rsquo;t like feeling like that at all</p>
<p>But I realized okay. It&rsquo;s not just like this little tense feeling</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling inside after I checked in with myself</p>
<p>I noticed I was feeling all of this and I was like what the fuck like this is why I&rsquo;m saying you always have to</p>
<p>Question how you feel look at it turn your attention toward it and just wonder about it</p>
<p>Get curious because that little tense feeling that little like</p>
<p>Tightness in my chest was all these things. I was feeling I just didn&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>So then I had to ask myself</p>
<p>Okay, what am I telling myself about being in this gym that is making me feel the way that I&rsquo;m feeling like what am I</p>
<p>Convincing myself of that is contributing to me feeling all these fucking things and then I started observing like my inner dialogue</p>
<p>of like the thoughts that I think while I&rsquo;m there and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>well telling myself that people are looking at me and</p>
<p>Ridiculing me is one thing telling myself that people don&rsquo;t like me is another thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just assuming people don&rsquo;t like me and we&rsquo;re gonna get into that comes from my childhood in a minute</p>
<p>But I was like observing that I was telling myself people were like</p>
<p>making fun of me like in their head like they&rsquo;re laughing at me because they found my tick-tock and like a lot of people know</p>
<p>It and like they&rsquo;re watching me and looking at me like they&rsquo;re ridiculing me</p>
<p>I was telling myself that like everybody looks at me like I don&rsquo;t belong there and I just felt like the odd one out</p>
<p>But I was also telling myself like I don&rsquo;t fit in. I don&rsquo;t belong here. I don&rsquo;t relate to these people</p>
<p>there was so much I was telling myself and so much going on in my inner dialogue that was contributing to</p>
<p>Me feeling all the shit. I was feeling and in the sense of belonging like you can&rsquo;t feel like you are accepted</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the word that&rsquo;s a good word to put it is that I didn&rsquo;t feel accepted at the gym and</p>
<p>A big thing that came from that was like the ridicule thing</p>
<p>it was like telling myself that people were looking at me to criticize me not looking at me to</p>
<p>Possibly admire me or possibly just see me at the gym and it&rsquo;s not like there is no thought behind it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like an observation of like, okay, there&rsquo;s a human being, you know</p>
<p>So this is where it comes in quit acting like you fucking know everything because every single thing I was telling myself</p>
<p>I had to go through and revisit</p>
<p>With telling myself that I&rsquo;m not accepted. I don&rsquo;t fit in. Why do I not fucking fit in? I look the part</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working out. I&rsquo;m not doing anything fucking weird</p>
<p>I very much fit in at the gym. Like I look normal</p>
<p>I look very much normal. Like I was convincing myself that I didn&rsquo;t but I had to question. I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>So go get in the mirror right now. Do I look like abnormal? Do I look like I don&rsquo;t fucking belong here?</p>
<p>Am I wearing a fucking tutu and have a magic wand and I&rsquo;m running around in the gym?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s someone that doesn&rsquo;t fit in in the gym. Like I&rsquo;m wearing fucking workout clothes. I&rsquo;m working out. I&rsquo;m in decent shape</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, so like where the fuck are you convincing yourself that you don&rsquo;t fit in here?</p>
<p>Cuz from the looks of it you look like you fit in fucker</p>
<p>so like where&rsquo;s that coming from, you know, and then I just had to go through each thing and</p>
<p>Kind of like nitpick myself like that. Like I had to quit acting like I know everything like telling myself. I don&rsquo;t fit in</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start questioning that voice inside your head and then the voice that was telling me people find my</p>
<p>TikToks and they don&rsquo;t like me and they&rsquo;re like ridiculing me</p>
<p>I had to think is this coming from anything? Has anyone said anything negative about my tiktoks?</p>
<p>No, has anyone ever been rude to me at the gym?</p>
<p>No, has anyone ever said there&rsquo;s something bad about my tiktoks to me in real life?</p>
<p>No, cuz they know I&rsquo;d mop the fucking floor with their ass like no one has ever said anything to me in person face-to-face</p>
<p>About my tiktoks people talk shit online, but I&rsquo;m talking like no real interaction</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had where someone has been rude to me and it&rsquo;s in their best interest</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing is like so where&rsquo;s this fucking belief coming from that people are judging my shit?</p>
<p>And then I had to think like okay the shit that I post. I like it. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not embarrassing. I don&rsquo;t let myself post embarrassing shit. So</p>
<p>That belief kind of was just like floating in fucking thin air like like for no reason like I was telling myself people were</p>
<p>ridiculing me for no fucking like</p>
<p>Point like nothing had happened to make me believe that</p>
<p>But I was still like telling myself that to begin with but that&rsquo;s when I was saying we have to go through in that one</p>
<p>Further like me getting bullied as a kid</p>
<p>My relationship to being around people was you&rsquo;re gonna be nitpicked</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be ridiculed people are gonna talk about your appearance</p>
<p>You are gonna be the spectacle people are always gonna have something to fucking say and</p>
<p>People are not just gonna like you like I was not liked when I was younger like it</p>
<p>Just I was bullied as fuck so that is something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve carried with myself until this day like the automatic assumption and throw my guard up like people don&rsquo;t like you so get ready</p>
<p>My whole point was saying all this shit is like basically from my past</p>
<p>I was taught that</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like you and you need to be ready like anytime you walk out of your bedroom</p>
<p>Your family might say some shit</p>
<p>And then when you go to school people are definitely gonna be saying shit</p>
<p>So my experience when I was younger like in school because school is your only like world</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re young like it was mine is like you go to school and you go home, and that&rsquo;s it you shut up</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you have to fucking do so my experience with the world was</p>
<p>Beyond the fucking defense people don&rsquo;t like you people are not just gonna be nice to you to be nice to you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how you&rsquo;re treated. That&rsquo;s not how the world fucking works. That&rsquo;s what I learned when I was younger</p>
<p>So that has stayed with me</p>
<p>Even when my world opened up, and I overlaid that like I took that belief and that like</p>
<p>Experience and I plastered it over my entire life</p>
<p>So when I was functioning in the real world and I was going places other than just school</p>
<p>Once I was like 15 16 I could drive</p>
<p>I had the same outlook toward the world that I did at school</p>
<p>So like people were not gonna be nice to me, and I was on guard all the time</p>
<p>And I still have that and I never questioned it so it just continued</p>
<p>This is what was contributing to me feeling like ridiculed and watched and like no one liked me at the gym</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I was convincing myself of the things I was thinking</p>
<p>but also this old belief this old mindset that I hadn&rsquo;t questioned before because I didn&rsquo;t realize it was like</p>
<p>Coming up, you know so like that mindset kept me safe and got me through school</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m noticing areas where this mindset is</p>
<p>Making things uncomfortable and now that I&rsquo;m aware enough to start questioning that and wondering where that came from I&rsquo;m seeing it</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I say your next step with all this shit is after you&rsquo;ve noticed how you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve thought of what are you convincing yourself of what are you telling yourself about the situation the things you&rsquo;re telling yourself?</p>
<p>You got to ask are these things logical like has something happened to cause me to think this way or am I assuming?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like me because of a past experience and a mindset that I&rsquo;ve been carrying for years</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been aware of because that&rsquo;s exactly what was going on with me</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way I break out of these fucking mindsets. And then my next step further is like look for proof</p>
<p>How is what I&rsquo;m assuming true or not true like at the gym? Okay, if I&rsquo;m convincing myself</p>
<p>Everybody here looks at me because they don&rsquo;t fucking like me</p>
<p>How is that true and then I thought about all the people that are giving me a bad look and I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>But has anybody said anything?</p>
<p>Has anybody done anything that was directly like unquestionable?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like me and the answer was no not a fucking thing. So</p>
<p>Then I looked for okay. So how is it not true? How is telling myself that people here don&rsquo;t like me?</p>
<p>How is that not true?</p>
<p>And then I start seeing how all the people at the front desk are always so nice to me and people smile at me and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recognized by followers and I&rsquo;m actually very welcomed and people are open and people are sweet and</p>
<p>People try to work in with me and people try to start conversation. Like I looked for all the proof that</p>
<p>Discredited what I&rsquo;ve been telling myself this whole time and I immediately felt relieved because I realized this was not true and</p>
<p>as soon as I realized that everything like all the pressure fell off like all everything fell off of me and</p>
<p>I felt a lot more relaxed and comfortable and accepted and like</p>
<p>That sigh of fucking air like just that is what I felt because all the tension all the pressure is off. I</p>
<p>Felt a lot more comfortable immediately like as soon as I started questioning all this stuff</p>
<p>I just felt relieved and that&rsquo;s what made me almost start crying on the fucking treadmill. I didn&rsquo;t cry</p>
<p>I stopped walking so I can get it together, but I didn&rsquo;t fucking cry</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I say I look at how is it true and then how is it not true and then</p>
<p>Given like the proof that I&rsquo;ve found by asking that question</p>
<p>I get to decide do I want to continue to tell myself that people don&rsquo;t like me or is it?</p>
<p>Okay for me to think the opposite</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>because it makes a lot more sense with all the things that I listed that people do like me and a lot more people are</p>
<p>Nicer to me than mean to me</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s makes more logical sense to believe that I am welcomed at the gym and that people do like me and that</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t looking at me to ridicule me</p>
<p>So the other thing I felt was very disconnected like I felt very isolated at the gym like yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people around but emotionally I felt very alone and</p>
<p>Then I had to call myself out on some shit, you know</p>
<p>So the trick that I use to feel more connected to people is looking for how we&rsquo;re similar and looking for what we have in</p>
<p>Common because you can&rsquo;t be looking for how you&rsquo;re the same as someone and feel disconnected from him at the same time doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>So I started looking around at the people on the bottom of the gym and being like, okay, how are we the same?</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>then I just let my brain kind of like go wild with all the little ways that I could relate to every person I was</p>
<p>Looking at and I immediately felt more connected to them</p>
<p>Like I felt that wall come down that I had up because I was like they don&rsquo;t fucking like me</p>
<p>Like I got that down</p>
<p>I reasoned through that and then I started looking for how I was the same as people and like well other people have needs too</p>
<p>And other people are anxious too and they want to feel included too. They want people to be nice to them, too</p>
<p>But then I started thinking okay</p>
<p>What are more ways I can feel more connected and welcomed at the gym?</p>
<p>And then I started thinking well, you could ask people if they need a spot</p>
<p>You could ask people for a spot because I&rsquo;m the motherfucker that will let the weight crush me for ask for a spot</p>
<p>Like I want to go heavier, but I don&rsquo;t want to take that risk, you know</p>
<p>But um, that&rsquo;s something I can do to help get that feeling state down of like I don&rsquo;t belong here is</p>
<p>start asking people for help help other people like</p>
<p>Interact with other people and see their response to me and see the interactions like I talk to people here and there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll interact here and there but I</p>
<p>need to make more of a practice of it and I have been since I&rsquo;ve realized all this like I&rsquo;ve been making a bigger practice of</p>
<p>just doing little things to help me feel more like included and</p>
<p>Accepted and like people like me looking for proof of that</p>
<p>Has made the experience of going to the gym a lot better. Like I&rsquo;m a lot more excited to go</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lot happier about going I still fucking hate it, but I feel a lot better emotionally</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that like tension or the pressure and I don&rsquo;t feel like the oh my god</p>
<p>I fucking hate this like and I don&rsquo;t feel like the whole I have to look like I could rip your fucking face off at</p>
<p>Any moment so people don&rsquo;t fuck with me, you know</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very unapproachable at the gym because I&rsquo;m trying to catch my breath and I&rsquo;m trying to like not die</p>
<p>You know and I do push myself to failure</p>
<p>so if you ever see me at the gym say hi like I&rsquo;m super friendly like if you come up to me like hey</p>
<p>Leo and you just like let me know you know me from online or you listen to my podcast or whatever the fuck it</p>
<p>Is like my wall is immediately gonna come down because your friend not foe</p>
<p>So like don&rsquo;t ever be scared to talk to me. Like I&rsquo;m gonna look fucking scary if I&rsquo;m by myself somewhere</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna look fucking mean I&rsquo;m gonna look scary, but I promise I&rsquo;m not gonna be mean to you</p>
<p>So I do have one more trick</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna share with you about breaking out of a mindset</p>
<p>but the biggest part of the one I just told you is becoming aware of the</p>
<p>Mindset that is causing you to feel the way that you do and then questioning does it make sense?</p>
<p>To have this mindset and then you get to decide do I want to continue forward with this mindset?</p>
<p>Or do I want to pick a different one and that&rsquo;s where your whole life&rsquo;s gonna fucking change</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just the whole basis of what I&rsquo;ve just explained</p>
<p>but my last part about flipping a mindset is</p>
<p>Educate your goddamn self like learn something and educate yourself more about</p>
<p>Something you think you already know</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s gonna be impossible for</p>
<p>Certain mindsets to exist</p>
<p>Once you gain more knowledge</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re just gonna know more and you&rsquo;re gonna realize the shit I was thinking before was fucking dumb and I&rsquo;m gonna give you an</p>
<p>Example or two maybe about this. So the first one, oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still fucking mad about it to this day</p>
<p>So when I was like 14, I think I was like kind of pudgy and I started a diet</p>
<p>Like I was just eating clean and trying to like do my thing for the first time at 14</p>
<p>like I had tried other shit at like 12, but y&rsquo;all I&rsquo;ve had like</p>
<p>Weight issues and spin self-conscious about that shit since I can remember being a chubby kid was not fun</p>
<p>But from starting at that young of an age, I have so many fucking tricks up my sleeve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a full episode about all my diet hacks and all my tips and tricks and all my shit that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>but anyway</p>
<p>my point of a story is I had just started like this diet and I was like a week into it and I was</p>
<p>Like barely fucking eating. I was eating like super super clean and my dad and my sister were like seeing me do this and</p>
<p>One day I was sitting down and I stood up and I started walking into like the living room</p>
<p>wherever the fuck I was going and I got really really lightheaded and I got dizzy and I started seeing like black spots and I</p>
<p>Was like what the fuck and then I noticed it kept happening like over a couple of days</p>
<p>I was like, oh my god</p>
<p>something must be wrong like I was laying on my bed another time and I went to go walk down the hall and I just</p>
<p>Like jumped up out of bed and took off walking down the hall and I got really really dizzy and I had to like hold</p>
<p>Myself up on the wall for a second. I was like, what the fuck and that&rsquo;s when I asked my dad and my sister</p>
<p>I was like, hey, like I think something&rsquo;s wrong with me</p>
<p>Like every time I get up I get like really dizzy and I&rsquo;ll see spots</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t see for a second and they were like, oh you need to eat sugar</p>
<p>Like you need to like have a Snickers bar whenever you&rsquo;re feeling like that because it means your sugar is low</p>
<p>So me not knowing any better. I was just like, okay, like I&rsquo;ll just eat fucking sugar</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the problem like so I ate a Snickers bar anytime. I would feel dizzy after standing up and</p>
<p>Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn&rsquo;t so I would just eat another Snickers bar</p>
<p>And I was just like eating fucking sugar anytime. I felt like that, but I was convinced that</p>
<p>that is what needed to happen like when that means my sugar is low and</p>
<p>Fast forward one of the things I learned going through nursing school was about</p>
<p>orthostatic hypotension</p>
<p>Which is basically low blood pressure whenever you stand up because whenever you&rsquo;re laying down</p>
<p>All your blood is like dispersed like all throughout your body</p>
<p>And then when you change elevations like you stand up really quick all your blood like by gravity</p>
<p>Sinks to the lower part of your body. So that means there&rsquo;s less circulating in your brain</p>
<p>So all of a sudden all the blood drops to the lower part of your body for a few seconds until your body can pump</p>
<p>The blood back up because of gravity. That&rsquo;s what makes you feel dizzy. Sometimes</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes you feel like a little lightheaded seeing black stars and shit when I learned about that</p>
<p>I was so fucking mad cuz I was like my stupid fucking ass really believed for so long</p>
<p>It was because I had low sugar like shut the fuck up. Oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still mad about it cuz like what the fuck like I know I was young and I just like believed who told me something</p>
<p>But I was still operating with that mindset and like I just fucking like believed it and then I learned</p>
<p>the truth about why your body</p>
<p>Experiences the things that it does like why when you stand up all of a sudden or you stand up too quick</p>
<p>You all of a sudden feel the way that you do. It&rsquo;s called orthostatic hypotension</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an explanation for it. Like it&rsquo;s not that your sugar is low. That doesn&rsquo;t have shit to fucking do with it</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to eat a fucking Snickers Leo like oh my god</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an example of gaining knowledge and it will immediately kill out your last mindset</p>
<p>Okay, so my last example I want to give you is about money</p>
<p>And this is the reframe and the mindset shift that like fucked my shit up in the best way possible</p>
<p>so I was always operating from a belief like since I can remember about money that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to make and like if you want to make money you have to like work your fucking ass off and</p>
<p>You have to like basically work a job</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like and like you have to kind of like suffer for money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how much you&rsquo;re willing to suffer is how much money you&rsquo;re willing to make and then I started realizing like no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really true because there&rsquo;s some people who</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>Have a fuck ton of money passively like in stocks and shit and like they don&rsquo;t have to work and they don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>Nothing, but I&rsquo;m like I could tell it it didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>but like I just kept riding on with that fucking belief but that was always weird for me because I also saw people who had</p>
<p>Stocks and had big businesses who like barely fucking worked and made a shit ton of money, you know</p>
<p>So my belief of like hard work equals money was like there for a while</p>
<p>I just really didn&rsquo;t look into it that much</p>
<p>But the thing that blew my fucking mind and completely flipped my mindset around money</p>
<p>Money is just an equal exchange in value. So in order for you to get money you need to give someone</p>
<p>Something that they value to exchange for it so you can offer a service you can offer a product</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like different shit you can offer to someone but it&rsquo;s just an exchange in value</p>
<p>So if you can contribute value to somebody you can receive money for it like it&rsquo;s just monetizing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an equal exchange and I was like, what the fuck like your ability to make money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re just cursed like I thought I was for so long</p>
<p>I thought I was just fucking cursed and like I wasn&rsquo;t able to make money doing something</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fucking hate which was like working as a nurse</p>
<p>but I heard that and</p>
<p>everything fucking shifted because my outlook was no longer about like working hard to make money or like you have to have some secret trick</p>
<p>Or like something&rsquo;s just working against me. Like it wasn&rsquo;t any of that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just offer fucking value to people who value it and they&rsquo;ll pay you for it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really that simple like meet a need for someone</p>
<p>provide them value and it&rsquo;s an equal exchange it can&rsquo;t not be like just offer someone something so fucking valuable and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll pay for it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s that fucking simple because what I do now blows my fucking mind</p>
<p>Like I do coaching calls with people and I just a heads up</p>
<p>I have cut off applications right now because I&rsquo;m at capacity and I can&rsquo;t take on anyone new</p>
<p>But if you want to submit your email for when I start taking clients again</p>
<p>You can click the link in this description and it&rsquo;ll take you to that application because I closed the other one because I have too</p>
<p>Many people right now. I&rsquo;m like fucking capacity. But anyway about what I do</p>
<p>There are people who have told me my coaching is fucking cheap. It&rsquo;s a hundred and fifty dollars per 50 minute session</p>
<p>I started at $90 a session and I&rsquo;ve had to like increase the price to keep up with demand and I thought</p>
<p>$90 was a fucking lot at the beginning because I didn&rsquo;t think people would value like what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>Like I have this weird like people have not valued me my whole life. So it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I just thought it would be the same thing</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always been able to see my value but people haven&rsquo;t so when I started my coaching I was like, okay</p>
<p>I still think 90 is high because people just don&rsquo;t seem to fucking see and appreciate what the fuck I have to offer</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just gonna do it and then I started booking up very quickly</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m at hundred and fifty dollars and like people are still telling me I&rsquo;m cheap</p>
<p>People are telling me I need to be five hundred to a thousand dollars an hour and I was like</p>
<p>What the fuck are you saying to me?</p>
<p>Like I was sitting over here thinking that</p>
<p>People were not gonna really see my value and be able to appreciate how I could change their life</p>
<p>because the shit that I say and the ways that I work through things with people like it is life-changing and</p>
<p>After giving that to so many people like seeing their response to it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like no you need to like double triple quadruple your fucking prices. Like that&rsquo;s how valuable you are to me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how what you&rsquo;ve given me. That&rsquo;s how much has changed my life and I&rsquo;m like, holy shit</p>
<p>But that is me offering value like me having a conversation with people and getting them through their problems</p>
<p>Working through it with them and offering them the insight and perspectives. They don&rsquo;t have and that they can&rsquo;t access</p>
<p>That is so valuable to the right people other people would never pay a fucking dollar to talk to me</p>
<p>Other people have told me they would pay a thousand dollars to talk to me</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just literally about exchanging value and what I provide people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re willing to pay so much more than I thought so break that fucking mindset if you have the same thing of</p>
<p>Making money is hard and you have to suffer for it</p>
<p>Like no, you just have to provide value to the amount that you want like in money</p>
<p>And you have to find the people that are willing to pay for that. So here&rsquo;s just an example say you work at fucking Target</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re providing value to your manager to your boss to the owner of Target like you giving your time</p>
<p>Dealing with customers checking them out and like working and doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>That is you offering value and you&rsquo;re offering a lot more value than they&rsquo;re fucking paying you the fucking</p>
<p>$10-$15 an hour or whatever it is, but you&rsquo;re offering value</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of what other value could I offer or how can I offer this same value to someone else who values it?</p>
<p>More because they&rsquo;ll be willing to exchange more money for it</p>
<p>You know, like just that mindset shift like will completely change everything for you. So that&rsquo;s the last one. I wanted to make</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna leave this episode off there. I hope this was helpful</p>
<p>If you want to follow me on Instagram, I will put it in the description below</p>
<p>My tick-tock will be there to the application for when I take on new clients will also be there everything you need to know</p>
<p>And if you want to keep up with me, it&rsquo;s in the description</p>
