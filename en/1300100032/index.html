<p>about pit bulls the really crazy ones</p>

<p>cheeks have you seen that</p>
<p>really yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>flashlight dot com or go to just</p>
<p>go to my website to</p>
<p>click on the</p>
<p>link there&rsquo;s like a fifteen percent discount you got</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>but you know what i would talk</p>
<p>about it anyway just if i didn&rsquo;t know and then i</p>
<p>found out people need to know yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>things are more popular</p>
<p>fantastic but yeah</p>
<p>these are little pit bulls back to</p>
<p>our story yeah i mean you had</p>
<p>you had the craziest little guy he was</p>
<p>awesome well</p>
<p>you had squeaky i remember it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>squeaky farm</p>
<p>yes squeaky farm</p>
<p>killed my dog</p>
<p>she was she was a coffee</p>
<p>table i&rsquo;ve never seen a dog that</p>
<p>she look like an alligator</p>
<p>the reason why i got this fucking dog</p>
<p>this dog was a prison dog</p>
<p>right this dog was in the</p>
<p>like literally in the the la</p>
<p>i got you from the</p>
<p>pound it was there for a</p>
<p>while nobody want this dog&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy little muscular pitbull</p>
<p>and brian calls me with his ex</p>
<p>girlfriend who&rsquo;s also fucking crazy</p>
<p>patty jenkins who</p>
<p>is the director of that</p>
<p>movie monster</p>
<p>one of the coolest</p>
<p>chicks ever</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s nuts too</p>
<p>okay so they&rsquo;re both nuts and they&rsquo;re both talking</p>
<p>about this pit bull that i have to rescue</p>
<p>so they call me</p>
<p>up and tell me i have to rescue this and i&rsquo;m like fuck</p>
<p>so i already have two dogs right</p>
<p>and i make the cardinal</p>
<p>sin of bringing a female</p>
<p>home to another</p>
<p>female you cannot do that with pit bulls anyway no way</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do with any dogs apparently</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you go to a</p>
<p>pound to get a pit bull</p>
<p>that seems like even because</p>
<p>because his</p>
<p>friend brian</p>
<p>karen took one look at the dog went</p>
<p>i said the patio go</p>
<p>if joe sees this dog</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna adopt</p>
<p>it he cannot resist</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a retard okay and he&rsquo;s a retard as well</p>
<p>and all retards</p>
<p>need is another retard to</p>
<p>agree with them and then they just do something</p>
<p>totally normal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how vegas was</p>
<p>started her</p>
<p>mentality just</p>
<p>heard exactly</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;ll buy it so just because</p>
<p>it was already in his head like i was so susceptible</p>
<p>i was like yeah really</p>
<p>what you look like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s got a fucking</p>
<p>giant head and she&rsquo;s so so solid</p>
<p>she looks like an</p>
<p>alligator she looks like an alligator with pitbull</p>
<p>lights meanwhile she was the</p>
<p>sweetest dog ever</p>
<p>but she hated other dogs</p>
<p>hated them they&rsquo;re unforgiving</p>
<p>unforgiving and ruthless she was willing to</p>
<p>fight for the death</p>
<p>fight to the</p>
<p>death for your</p>
<p>attention well i had two feet i had a female</p>
<p>police dog german shepherd</p>
<p>and a pit bull and they used to get in such bad</p>
<p>fights and for me</p>
<p>i was just looking at sixteen</p>
<p>hundred dollars there another sixteen hundred dollars</p>
<p>there as they&rsquo;re tearing each</p>
<p>other up for the vet</p>
<p>i got so good though at choking</p>
<p>just right the</p>
<p>problem is not when you&rsquo;re there the problem is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not exactly and that&rsquo;s what happened with</p>
<p>squeaky she killed one of my dogs when i wasn&rsquo;t here</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a crazy dog but she just did</p>
<p>would not tolerate any bullshit and</p>
<p>because the way they</p>
<p>raise them man you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just willing to</p>
<p>fight to the death the</p>
<p>game ones are the ones that get to</p>
<p>every other animal</p>
<p>fights out of fear of</p>
<p>dominance and</p>
<p>dominance including territorial you</p>
<p>know which is</p>
<p>under the umbrella being territorial</p>
<p>whereas pit bulls actually are bred</p>
<p>to actually</p>
<p>enjoy the fight</p>
<p>and a lot of times in the fight</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re into it they&rsquo;re wagging their tail</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great dogs if</p>
<p>you raise them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re there with them</p>
<p>all the time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super loving and really</p>
<p>loyal companions</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re dangerous as fuck when it comes to</p>
<p>other animals</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too crazy</p>
<p>having them</p>
<p>i prefer to not have them even though you know i</p>
<p>loved my dogs they were awesome dogs they were</p>
<p>super friendly and</p>
<p>obedient and</p>
<p>they were really like affectionate</p>
<p>too much man</p>
<p>too crazy too</p>
<p>dangerous you know</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s dogs get fucked up by your</p>
<p>dog and you feel like a douchebag you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t take him to the dog park</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on a leash</p>
<p>my dog bit at someone&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s dog&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>through the fence and</p>
<p>grabbed a hold of it through this dog&rsquo;s fence</p>
<p>we were walking i totally didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect it we were walking</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on a leash</p>
<p>and this dog</p>
<p>sticks his head through the fence</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like what bitch</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s locked onto</p>
<p>it so fast so</p>
<p>quick he had half of the fence in his</p>
<p>teeth and half of this dog&rsquo;s face did you have to</p>
<p>choke him off</p>
<p>yeah and pull</p>
<p>away you have to grab his collar and twist it</p>
<p>and yank on him</p>
<p>i had to put him to sleep</p>
<p>i had to put him to</p>
<p>sleep a couple times i had to put him to</p>
<p>sleep when he was trying to kill my cat</p>
<p>yeah he was fucking nuts yeah it was a</p>
<p>great yeah thanks francra</p>
<p>yeah he was a</p>
<p>great dog like with</p>
<p>people but with animals and it was not how i raised him</p>
<p>it just it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just their genetics</p>
<p>you know i raised him around his cat</p>
<p>i raised him around cats and dogs</p>
<p>the more we</p>
<p>learn was around him all the time</p>
<p>it just they&rsquo;re just too crazy</p>
<p>the more we learn</p>
<p>about genetics anyway the more we realize it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much it&rsquo;s a lot less nurture than it is nature we are</p>
<p>slaves to our</p>
<p>dna in a lot of ways there&rsquo;s a lot of that</p>
<p>going on for sure both</p>
<p>humans and in animals there&rsquo;s nothing you could tell</p>
<p>me there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all moving in a certain direction</p>
<p>for a reason okay because this is the best way</p>
<p>that the species stays strong</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking chemicals and a lot of them are</p>
<p>dictating your</p>
<p>actions all the time and if you&rsquo;re a pit bull</p>
<p>i mean how much of no no</p>
<p>no is gonna get in your head</p>
<p>very well you know</p>
<p>the reading this book we were talking</p>
<p>about it yesterday where</p>
<p>genetically</p>
<p>for thousands of years</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>learned how to</p>
<p>crossbreed you</p>
<p>know and whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plants or animals</p>
<p>and come up with what they want</p>
<p>but now with genetic engineering we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>crazy abilities</p>
<p>do this on pinpoint accuracy like combining</p>
<p>an actual like</p>
<p>alligator with you know i mean for real</p>
<p>an alligator with a lion i mean they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>crazy experiments</p>
<p>where they can</p>
<p>cross pollinate</p>
<p>dna that&rsquo;s totally inside the realm of possibility</p>
<p>yeah you know what&rsquo;s really nuts man is dogs</p>
<p>no one real there&rsquo;s no real answer</p>
<p>to how people bred dogs to be so</p>
<p>crazy different</p>
<p>and they all came from wolves</p>
<p>genetically all dogs come from wolves</p>
<p>and that was like a big</p>
<p>shock when they</p>
<p>found that out</p>
<p>because that just</p>
<p>leaves a whole lot of questions like</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the delineation</p>
<p>happened how they don&rsquo;t know they thought it was a</p>
<p>bunch of other wild cannons</p>
<p>and i would have to double check this</p>
<p>article because i don&rsquo;t really recall the details of it</p>
<p>but i remember that they were</p>
<p>shocked that they</p>
<p>found that dogs dna</p>
<p>was direct from wolves</p>
<p>and that somehow or another a wolf became a chihuahua</p>
<p>you know a wolf became a bulldog</p>
<p>you know they just slowly</p>
<p>how the fuck did that happen well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breeding that&rsquo;s thousands of years of</p>
<p>breeding that</p>
<p>seems wrong they can do that sources</p>
<p>i know i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right but it seems</p>
<p>wrong it seems like</p>
<p>if you had a bet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like how</p>
<p>could that be</p>
<p>right how is that possible</p>
<p>a fucking chihuahua came from a wolf</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>how could you make</p>
<p>something but</p>
<p>human beings as they</p>
<p>learn more about the genome</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t figure out why</p>
<p>aids never became</p>
<p>heterosexual</p>
<p>disease in this country but it was rampant in africa</p>
<p>well what they just discovered was</p>
<p>that when you have a certain mutation on your gene</p>
<p>that mutation if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>northern european</p>
<p>anybody really that you know that&rsquo;s white</p>
<p>or from of european descent</p>
<p>they are the ones that survived the bubonic plague</p>
<p>and everybody else died and the people that survived</p>
<p>that plague had a certain mutation in their gene</p>
<p>that also makes them</p>
<p>hiv resistant</p>
<p>whereas the bubonic plague did not hit africa</p>
<p>africa had its own diseases but that</p>
<p>particular plague</p>
<p>never hit africa</p>
<p>so they never even</p>
<p>they never developed a mutation in</p>
<p>their gene to survive a plague like that yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s fucking nuts i&rsquo;m smart</p>
<p>the just the diversity of it all it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>how different</p>
<p>things are happening</p>
<p>all the time there&rsquo;s different diseases we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting off and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different things we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adapting to and who knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with our</p>
<p>brains right now because of</p>
<p>the different</p>
<p>kinds of access to information that we have now</p>
<p>with the internet and you</p>
<p>know just with social networking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much more access to information</p>
<p>right now like</p>
<p>who knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changing in our minds because of that well what</p>
<p>about the fact that</p>
<p>when we create an actual neural web</p>
<p>where we have</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>genuinely connected to one specific club</p>
<p>with something in your body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so possible well</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all talking</p>
<p>about this already</p>
<p>well they already are they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>working on synthetic biology</p>
<p>dna that&rsquo;s synthetic that actually can grow</p>
<p>in a petri dish</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to</p>
<p>science talk with</p>
<p>brian callan and joe rogan</p>
<p>did you ever</p>
<p>think when you were doing</p>
<p>that you were in the hangover did you ever</p>
<p>think that movie was</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>movie of the year</p>
<p>the movie of the line no idea</p>
<p>i remember showing up there and</p>
<p>i went in for the audition for todd phillips who have</p>
<p>known for a</p>
<p>while and i was</p>
<p>planning like a new york guy you know hey how you doing</p>
<p>this is eddie</p>
<p>and he likes when i improvise</p>
<p>so i was kind of improvising and i put a girl there</p>
<p>and when i got to the reading i said you know</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;ll play him like you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m from lebanon</p>
<p>if i make a very good</p>
<p>prize laugh</p>
<p>laugh laugh</p>
<p>so i show up i do my two days of work in vegas</p>
<p>bradley cooper i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known for eight years i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known zach for 15</p>
<p>i just done a</p>
<p>movie with ed</p>
<p>helms before that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>these guys name</p>
<p>dropper yeah yeah</p>
<p>thank you so much name</p>
<p>dropper and</p>
<p>but i remember</p>
<p>saying of talking to bradley i was like how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>going he goes i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know dude i&rsquo;ve done a</p>
<p>bunch of movies i don&rsquo;t know if anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching them you know</p>
<p>wow money i&rsquo;m not making</p>
<p>and just it was this tiny</p>
<p>movie where none of them were making any</p>
<p>money i turn to todd phillips and i go</p>
<p>how much you make</p>
<p>of this movie i mean</p>
<p>he makes good</p>
<p>money he goes you&rsquo;re making more than i am</p>
<p>i say what do you mean he goes</p>
<p>i deferred my</p>
<p>salary for a backend and i remember</p>
<p>literally thinking to myself i went</p>
<p>whatever dude you&rsquo;re out of your mind</p>
<p>no stars it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>movie called hangover in vegas also</p>
<p>has to do now is be good</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s good people talk</p>
<p>about it just through networking facebook and twitter</p>
<p>and just that&rsquo;s like find out</p>
<p>about shit but</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe you can</p>
<p>maybe you have a theory on why the hangover was</p>
<p>a phenomenal</p>
<p>thing because it was awesome</p>
<p>because it was fun because people went</p>
<p>to see it and they had a good time it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>yeah it was a really</p>
<p>i mean it was</p>
<p>a really kind of almost like a cliche subject</p>
<p>going to vegas and</p>
<p>going crazy and</p>
<p>partying and</p>
<p>we wake up what happened what went wrong</p>
<p>but it was done so well</p>
<p>every part about it was great</p>
<p>the acting was</p>
<p>great the stories were fun</p>
<p>they were silly but yet believable enough todd</p>
<p>phillips knows how to make a</p>
<p>movie that guy</p>
<p>he basically</p>
<p>wrote and directed bad santa</p>
<p>and nobody knows that</p>
<p>that was him</p>
<p>they gave him a 40</p>
<p>minute like</p>
<p>thing and harvey weinstein</p>
<p>was like you</p>
<p>gotta save this</p>
<p>movie and he</p>
<p>basically went back rewrote and re</p>
<p>did the whole</p>
<p>thing and shot it that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>bob thornton</p>
<p>oh oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>i worked for</p>
<p>the nice guy really yeah</p>
<p>nice guy but you</p>
<p>see that interview in canada</p>
<p>he was on this really cool</p>
<p>radio show and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s in toronto</p>
<p>and the guy was talking to him the guy introduces</p>
<p>him in the band</p>
<p>and just for context</p>
<p>states that this guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know academy award winning actor</p>
<p>and just you know to try to like</p>
<p>layer the story that this guy&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>giving him his props</p>
<p>billy bob goes into a hissy</p>
<p>fit because the guy was not supposed to mention acting</p>
<p>so he i love actors take</p>
<p>you make believe</p>
<p>for a living dude</p>
<p>exactly you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>musician do you not</p>
<p>understand i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>musician and you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like answering</p>
<p>his questions all fucked up and we&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>throw the guy off</p>
<p>and the guy handles it amazingly the guy just</p>
<p>totally like rational</p>
<p>talking you know</p>
<p>totally calm</p>
<p>makes it through without any</p>
<p>freak outs me</p>
<p>harry&rsquo;s got this fucking</p>
<p>world famous</p>
<p>you know academy award winning actor who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly being crazy</p>
<p>like mad at him</p>
<p>because he mentioned that he happened to win an</p>
<p>oscar well he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>married i think five times</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>think about that for a</p>
<p>second you know i mean come on guys</p>
<p>how crazy is brad pitt that brad pitt does not look at</p>
<p>angelina jolie</p>
<p>and goes wait a</p>
<p>minute how nutty is this bitch</p>
<p>she fucked this guy</p>
<p>she fucked this guy and she</p>
<p>should take his</p>
<p>blood and wear it around her neck</p>
<p>okay what bumpy</p>
<p>it is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here he&rsquo;s probably really stung like</p>
<p>dude you got</p>
<p>blood around your neck you know like he&rsquo;s probably i</p>
<p>think she just worked him i</p>
<p>think she came in i</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s an alpha</p>
<p>fucking female</p>
<p>vaginal predator</p>
<p>i think she just</p>
<p>grabbed him held him down</p>
<p>and and made a</p>
<p>meter pussy</p>
<p>and that was it she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done she just shut him off</p>
<p>you listen that</p>
<p>would have ended</p>
<p>by now i know i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that power goes away</p>
<p>what power her being able to be like oh</p>
<p>no with you she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magic maybe</p>
<p>with magic no</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mean to diss brad pitt i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>you know have anything</p>
<p>against him but i was listening to</p>
<p>larry king once and</p>
<p>larry king was</p>
<p>talking this guy was like who the fuck is this dummy</p>
<p>and it turned out</p>
<p>to be brad pitt</p>
<p>i was listening in my car</p>
<p>i had no idea who the fuck it was i was this guy&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>idiot who is this guy</p>
<p>larry king&rsquo;s talking what is this guy do</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be right back with brad pitt</p>
<p>and i was like wow</p>
<p>brad pitt is dumb</p>
<p>i mean look he&rsquo;s a fucking actor he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>smart and maybe he is</p>
<p>smart nobody&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not good at talking nobody ever i always say</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>i mean some people come off badly in an interview</p>
<p>i know i have he&rsquo;s a simple guy i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a simple guy who</p>
<p>had a certain bone</p>
<p>structure that cut</p>
<p>light well and</p>
<p>his strength</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s not afraid to look bad and not afraid</p>
<p>to take chances he keeps trying to be really good</p>
<p>well i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really good actor like i thought he was awesome in</p>
<p>an interview with the</p>
<p>vampire that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like one of my favorite</p>
<p>roles ever yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also because</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t become a</p>
<p>victim to his good looks like he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>trying to do something</p>
<p>different and</p>
<p>his production company makes a lot of</p>
<p>money and does really makes really good</p>
<p>movies i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying he really is a retarded i really do</p>
<p>enjoy his acting</p>
<p>just thought a</p>
<p>fight club but</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a movie star</p>
<p>because yeah and</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just usually it&rsquo;s the ability to project</p>
<p>a lot of times people they can be smart just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not that good at stringing words together</p>
<p>and you know and coming off smart but</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>also intelligences compartmentalize you can be very</p>
<p>smart in one area and not</p>
<p>smart at all sure</p>
<p>and i think that was someone like brad pitt</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it ever made it was ever relevant for him</p>
<p>until probably</p>
<p>read a whole lot</p>
<p>about other things</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a prince in hollywood and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending a lot of time on set</p>
<p>you can create deficits that way</p>
<p>or not fill in the holes you need to that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i</p>
<p>loved about</p>
<p>brian when i</p>
<p>first met him was like here</p>
<p>was this guy who was an actor who wasn&rsquo;t like actors</p>
<p>cause i had only been in hollywood when i met</p>
<p>brian for about a year</p>
<p>and i was just sick of it i was</p>
<p>ready to go back home</p>
<p>i was ready to</p>
<p>quit acting</p>
<p>and go back to</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>new york i just didn&rsquo;t like actors</p>
<p>and then i got newsradio and then i decided to stay</p>
<p>and then i met brian</p>
<p>but he was like the</p>
<p>first actor that i met that wasn&rsquo;t like an actor you</p>
<p>guys were both on newsradio at one</p>
<p>yeah he played my</p>
<p>brother and</p>
<p>nick depalo</p>
<p>nick depaul</p>
<p>played my other brother that was awesome but</p>
<p>when i first came on the set here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>brian and i</p>
<p>were hanging out in this cafeteria and we were eating</p>
<p>and brian was doing some</p>
<p>impression or something and i was</p>
<p>laughing fucking</p>
<p>hysterically</p>
<p>it was really</p>
<p>funny shit and</p>
<p>this other guy</p>
<p>who was the actor who was on the show with us as well</p>
<p>was trying just to top brian</p>
<p>kept trying to top him</p>
<p>like everything</p>
<p>brian would say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be like nettie be like man</p>
<p>bitch i got your shit</p>
<p>right here it was like really</p>
<p>wowed and trying too hard and it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>sharp f when you&rsquo;re listening to a symphony</p>
<p>and somebody&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>with a horn</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like who&rsquo;s blowing that horn over</p>
<p>there yeah yeah it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go so</p>
<p>it was just you know immediately i</p>
<p>could see like okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an actor</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s an actor that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you know or</p>
<p>any of those</p>
<p>really creepy needy</p>
<p>hollywood people they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have to be an actor</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could be a comic and be like that you could be</p>
<p>be anything but you&rsquo;ll be a singer and be like that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that creepy needy</p>
<p>entertainment i</p>
<p>think it has</p>
<p>to do with not having perspective</p>
<p>and putting yourself at the</p>
<p>center of the universe that&rsquo;s what a lot of actors do</p>
<p>they actually</p>
<p>think that what they&rsquo;re doing and what they</p>
<p>think and what they have to say is</p>
<p>historically relevant</p>
<p>and that comes from being</p>
<p>self involved to the nth degree</p>
<p>which in some ways i feel almost unique</p>
<p>sometimes to be an actor it</p>
<p>also is because of the environment on sets</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on a set</p>
<p>everyone is kissing your ass</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the star if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>some big guy and you&rsquo;re on a set</p>
<p>everyone is</p>
<p>relying on you to pay</p>
<p>their bills</p>
<p>your success means that you know</p>
<p>they get to keep</p>
<p>their job and they get to buy a new house</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re always kissing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>treated like a prince</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re treated like real</p>
<p>ridiculous you</p>
<p>could you could be</p>
<p>wrong about</p>
<p>things people won&rsquo;t argue</p>
<p>and you see it you see</p>
<p>it like all the time yeah so people create their own</p>
<p>they create</p>
<p>their own reality and</p>
<p>and then everybody kind of</p>
<p>enters into this mutual</p>
<p>agreement that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sort of</p>
<p>keep your reality a reality</p>
<p>especially when you know if you&rsquo;re working long</p>
<p>hours which</p>
<p>they are in a lot of</p>
<p>movies and especially like a lot of hour tv shows</p>
<p>they work long ass fucking</p>
<p>hours and people get cranky</p>
<p>and when you get</p>
<p>cranky you want to just yell to get</p>
<p>things done</p>
<p>well that starts a precedent</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>get used to yelling at people and then it becomes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to yell at people then it becomes oh here&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>crazy actor he&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>everything everybody</p>
<p>quiet quiet quiet</p>
<p>so they get this</p>
<p>completely distorted perception</p>
<p>of where they fit in the real circle of life</p>
<p>well fucking pretenders</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re locked in this</p>
<p>weird social</p>
<p>system that like</p>
<p>rewards it have you guys met john lithgow</p>
<p>and what is he like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i have i read i did a</p>
<p>i auditioned</p>
<p>with him once really and he read with me it was kind of</p>
<p>exciting he was on</p>
<p>third rock from the sun when i was on news</p>
<p>radio i got</p>
<p>to meet him at one of those nbc</p>
<p>press junket</p>
<p>things yeah just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a cool dude he&rsquo;s a real actor he does a lot of</p>
<p>stage still in new york</p>
<p>and very nice guy</p>
<p>really really who&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>guy from fargo</p>
<p>the guy with joe montagne</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s that guy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>bill oh bill</p>
<p>macy bill macy</p>
<p>hilarious actor</p>
<p>really really really awesome actor</p>
<p>i met him once</p>
<p>and i said hey man i really love that</p>
<p>movie you did with joe montehania</p>
<p>and he makes this</p>
<p>joe montagne</p>
<p>how is his name</p>
<p>joe montana joe montagne</p>
<p>martini yeah</p>
<p>so he goes it&rsquo;s joe montagne</p>
<p>so he says that to me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like god i&rsquo;m that fucking</p>
<p>idiot guy who&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>you really like something joe montagne</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s like one of the few guys that</p>
<p>ever want to meet i mean fargo is one of my favorite</p>
<p>movies ever</p>
<p>so like me meeting</p>
<p>him was like wow i&rsquo;m really meeting this guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>joe antonio</p>
<p>like oh i gotta go now i&rsquo;m just such a piece of</p>
<p>shit how many</p>
<p>people go up to joey diaz</p>
<p>thinking he&rsquo;s the guy from the sopranos oh big</p>
<p>pussy yeah always</p>
<p>thinking joey</p>
<p>diaz is big</p>
<p>pussy from sopranos</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>well so what</p>
<p>i mean what was it</p>
<p>like for you coming into hollywood and dealing with all</p>
<p>these actor type</p>
<p>human beings because it is</p>
<p>like it really is</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>for people who have</p>
<p>regular jobs</p>
<p>it is shocking</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re when you</p>
<p>first get around actors it&rsquo;s shocking</p>
<p>yeah because they&rsquo;re telling you two plus two is 16</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just the weirdest</p>
<p>world and they&rsquo;re all democrats</p>
<p>all of them</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>believe that there&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>thing as being able to socially engineer</p>
<p>equality and that washington knows what to do with your</p>
<p>money i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think that i think they</p>
<p>think that the left is the best they think that</p>
<p>going left and being like this socially</p>
<p>aware person makes you look cooler in hollywood</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a mindset that they</p>
<p>adopt without really considering</p>
<p>any of the different aspects of that mindset it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hollywood</p>
<p>theme right</p>
<p>i was gonna say</p>
<p>a lot of times i find that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s an alternative out there</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know that just saying</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re not a left wing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>quote unquote republican do you not go</p>
<p>crazy when you hear wheeze</p>
<p>when you hear like people go like they talk</p>
<p>about the democratic</p>
<p>party like well we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta win this</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking like it&rsquo;s the dodgers well</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s a collectivist mindset</p>
<p>which if you look at history has</p>
<p>never really produced any results at all</p>
<p>what makes this country great is</p>
<p>individuals who take a chance and get rewarded for it</p>
<p>coming up with ideas and in a</p>
<p>way that&rsquo;s actually the best way to create a community</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s hard to rely</p>
<p>on each other there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broad spectrum</p>
<p>of ideas to lump them into two competing camps is</p>
<p>absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p>especially when people just</p>
<p>jump on either camp and</p>
<p>everything they say is gospel</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a neanderthal if you don&rsquo;t believe exactly</p>
<p>you said it you said it it&rsquo;s like team it&rsquo;s like two</p>
<p>different teams when you</p>
<p>watch the elections</p>
<p>our team versus your team and</p>
<p>any of your ideas be damned because my team&rsquo;s gonna win</p>
<p>my favorite guy that i know</p>
<p>that i used to know who was a real like</p>
<p>liberal leftist like really like</p>
<p>everything wanted</p>
<p>reparations for slavery for real</p>
<p>believed that he called himself a feminist</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not bullshitting he called himself a</p>
<p>fan of us and when he was married</p>
<p>i believe he even</p>
<p>changed his name</p>
<p>he changed his wife&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>he hyphenated and her name was last oh</p>
<p>what trying to reinvent the wheel</p>
<p>yeah he hyphenated</p>
<p>not not she hyphenated he hyphenated his own name</p>
<p>and accepted hers last is like the</p>
<p>dominant name that&rsquo;s like the hot tip time machine dude</p>
<p>this guy was like</p>
<p>his body was made of jello</p>
<p>his hands were frail</p>
<p>and tiny and his</p>
<p>hips were odd</p>
<p>he had none</p>
<p>he had none he walked funny</p>
<p>there was like a</p>
<p>funny walked him</p>
<p>he just had</p>
<p>no ability to get out of the way of anything</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s his way</p>
<p>of making himself feel significant that was his game</p>
<p>his game was</p>
<p>i am gonna support</p>
<p>your rights as a</p>
<p>woman more than a man</p>
<p>than other women will i will do it as a man yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s his rap</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that he</p>
<p>figured out that that got him laid a couple times then</p>
<p>just bought into that&rsquo;s all he had available what is he</p>
<p>gonna do is either</p>
<p>gonna do that or</p>
<p>gonna collect guns</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s gonna do</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got one or the</p>
<p>other bro you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go one extreme</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re compensating whether you like it or</p>
<p>not your dick is an inch long and you&rsquo;re made of jello</p>
<p>all right you&rsquo;re compensating what</p>
<p>a disaster yeah</p>
<p>he was my favorite example of someone</p>
<p>who was just like</p>
<p>this guy was like would</p>
<p>treat you could not</p>
<p>have a discussion</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>you could not have a</p>
<p>discussion about</p>
<p>war you could not have a discussion</p>
<p>about politics anything</p>
<p>that involved</p>
<p>the democrats and the republicans</p>
<p>could not have</p>
<p>it because as soon as you had an opposing</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>well like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that maybe it&rsquo;s a good idea to pay attention</p>
<p>to really radical</p>
<p>groups all over the</p>
<p>world you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that maybe is a good idea and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe kept people safe</p>
<p>you fucking</p>
<p>right wing neanderthal</p>
<p>so he shuts you down oh yeah immediately he</p>
<p>builds a wall around you and so now you&rsquo;re on that name</p>
<p>calling and</p>
<p>defines you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always you know</p>
<p>right wing which i&rsquo;m the last person to be</p>
<p>right wing or</p>
<p>anyway well i always i always reject i always</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m more of a</p>
<p>libertarian</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve just always believed that</p>
<p>i believe that</p>
<p>human beings know how to govern themselves i</p>
<p>think you have to have a certain amount of government</p>
<p>i believe you have to have roads and you have to have a</p>
<p>strong defense you have to have police</p>
<p>force i believe in that</p>
<p>stuff however</p>
<p>i think we are</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to say we&rsquo;re headed toward this</p>
<p>trend but i</p>
<p>think that the danger has always been and george</p>
<p>washington said that people will invent laws to take</p>
<p>their own power away from them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a danger that a centralized bureaucracy</p>
<p>will get enough power become a leviathan</p>
<p>where it just</p>
<p>starts needing more and more resources</p>
<p>and you lose your freedoms</p>
<p>you do in the name of making the</p>
<p>world a better place there&rsquo;s always a benevolent</p>
<p>concept behind it but</p>
<p>i i think that the the best way to look at things is</p>
<p>when people say you&rsquo;re conservative well i was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like that i don&rsquo;t like when people say</p>
<p>that because what they&rsquo;re saying is that i am somehow</p>
<p>it has in its connotation the idea that i am</p>
<p>very stodgy and very</p>
<p>strict and very controlling</p>
<p>whereas i&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>quite the opposite i believe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you could call me</p>
<p>right wing certainly not left wing because i believe in</p>
<p>maximum personal freedom</p>
<p>i believe you</p>
<p>should legalize drugs because i</p>
<p>think people know</p>
<p>essentially how to</p>
<p>govern themselves and if they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re people are</p>
<p>gonna do drugs anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just one example</p>
<p>but i think for the most part</p>
<p>government should be</p>
<p>treated like a necessary evil</p>
<p>not a huge engine for good the only problem with</p>
<p>legalizing drugs</p>
<p>is that if and</p>
<p>this is i mean</p>
<p>this is an argument and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not exactly sure i support it but this is the argument</p>
<p>the argument is that if you made drugs legal</p>
<p>then big corporations</p>
<p>would step in</p>
<p>and be even more out of control because they</p>
<p>would realize that the real</p>
<p>money is in selling people</p>
<p>these drugs that used to be illegal</p>
<p>and they would package them and make them very</p>
<p>cheap and very available and because of the fact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be so</p>
<p>much of it because there&rsquo;d be profit in it that people</p>
<p>would do it that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t necessarily buy it</p>
<p>but i do think that you have to be really careful of</p>
<p>allowing anybody to make a living or make</p>
<p>money or get rich</p>
<p>off of something that can fuck</p>
<p>other people up</p>
<p>like cigarettes you</p>
<p>consider about</p>
<p>cigarettes now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pimps</p>
<p>the people that are selling</p>
<p>cigarettes right now</p>
<p>look i know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>billions and billions of dollars in</p>
<p>cigarettes but</p>
<p>you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing period</p>
<p>bait anymore this isn&rsquo;t 1950s with</p>
<p>those camels on</p>
<p>tv you&rsquo;re putting yourself</p>
<p>up i recommend</p>
<p>camels yeah</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re fucking yourself for sure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>billions of dollars off people fucking themselves</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be a segment of the</p>
<p>population that is</p>
<p>going to just</p>
<p>abuse themselves i</p>
<p>think that certain</p>
<p>people do drugs and whether or not they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>legal or not it</p>
<p>would probably raise the</p>
<p>the usage maybe</p>
<p>but for the most part i</p>
<p>think when people who want to get high</p>
<p>they find a way to get high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true but the idea that you can profit off that</p>
<p>i think i don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>should be able to profit</p>
<p>off people are profiting people over people are</p>
<p>profiting now you know the</p>
<p>local drug dealer so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>should be legal</p>
<p>i think you know i&rsquo;m all for</p>
<p>drugs being</p>
<p>legal sort of as a</p>
<p>statement yeah i&rsquo;m all for drugs being legal</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not for you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m totally for social</p>
<p>darwinism but</p>
<p>i can see this as an argument</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m not saying that i support it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i can see the argument that if you did there</p>
<p>would be more access there</p>
<p>would be more of it and you</p>
<p>would have even more</p>
<p>of a problem than we have already of corporations being</p>
<p>basically sociopathic</p>
<p>you know not caring</p>
<p>is profit ahead of</p>
<p>you know these questions</p>
<p>are getting</p>
<p>only more and more relevant</p>
<p>and deeper and deeper and and</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>other issue</p>
<p>we are now coming up with</p>
<p>technology the</p>
<p>genies out of the bottle we&rsquo;re coming up with</p>
<p>technology that</p>
<p>has the potential to do incredible good but</p>
<p>also be incredibly destructive for example</p>
<p>is scientists are now</p>
<p>learning how to create new life</p>
<p>forms out of</p>
<p>synthetic material that have</p>
<p>never existed and they&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>self replicating proteins</p>
<p>what does that mean</p>
<p>that means that</p>
<p>in 20 30 40 years nobody knows but this</p>
<p>stuff is moving exponentially</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>going to have computers machines whatever</p>
<p>you want to call them that replicate themselves right</p>
<p>what do you do what is the</p>
<p>dialogue and what are the questions that accompany that</p>
<p>what is to say that</p>
<p>these machines</p>
<p>will have a respect for</p>
<p>their biological heritage</p>
<p>you tell me is there a guarantee</p>
<p>there probably is no there&rsquo;s no guarantee and if</p>
<p>they become intelligent and they develop some sort of a</p>
<p>self defense mechanism</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like skynet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it really is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>every computer scientist</p>
<p>that is the conversation that guys like ray kurzweil</p>
<p>and these computer scientists</p>
<p>are talking</p>
<p>about yeah it&rsquo;s a real conversation that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>being addressed anywhere else when people are talking</p>
<p>about lindsay</p>
<p>lohan going to jail</p>
<p>well exactly and</p>
<p>exactly and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>tidal wave that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming that nobody sees very few people see that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna i think</p>
<p>our futures are</p>
<p>gonna be so</p>
<p>radically altered in the next 20 years</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>even i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>aware of how radical the changes have been that have</p>
<p>taken place in our life</p>
<p>things are gradual you get used to it</p>
<p>we get used to the fact that we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>thing right now and</p>
<p>thousands of</p>
<p>people are listening to it live and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going out all over the world</p>
<p>as a podcast hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s through</p>
<p>just a fucking</p>
<p>sitting in a room in my</p>
<p>house well by</p>
<p>the way the internet is just it&rsquo;s 5 000 days old</p>
<p>the internet is 5 000 days old</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever realize put it into context but if you think</p>
<p>about how long it&rsquo;s been around for 15 years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 5 000 days</p>
<p>a little over 5 000 days</p>
<p>so the internet has just been around for 5 000 days</p>
<p>now what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>in 20 000 days</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>think about how fast</p>
<p>this stuff is moving yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s staggering</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to really wrap your head around</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s hard to wrap your head around the fact that</p>
<p>200 years ago</p>
<p>the best way to get around was to ride an animal</p>
<p>200 years ago if</p>
<p>you wanted a</p>
<p>picture of someone you had to draw it</p>
<p>yeah there was no cameras 200 years ago</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>just incredible that&rsquo;s two lifetimes</p>
<p>two lifetimes</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>radically changed yeah</p>
<p>the internet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally like a drug nowadays they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find a way to sell the internet</p>
<p>to you like a drug a little bit you know</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t believe that the government&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>grabbing a hold of the internet</p>
<p>and trying to make as much</p>
<p>money as possible they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t the government</p>
<p>the problem is you look at it as the government yeah</p>
<p>the government but the government it&rsquo;s like it would be</p>
<p>great if there was only like ten people on the earth</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>like two dudes and they were the government</p>
<p>then that would work</p>
<p>but the same people</p>
<p>that would profit</p>
<p>off drugs then</p>
<p>the same people have profit off</p>
<p>well how would they do that</p>
<p>they would censor it they would</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>first of all the government</p>
<p>the government is a several different</p>
<p>race is about 50 different competing entities</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that it&rsquo;s amazing that they you know</p>
<p>which brings up this subject that i wanted to talk</p>
<p>about hr five</p>
<p>seven four one slavery</p>
<p>this is that yeah</p>
<p>charlie rangale</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s how you say rangle</p>
<p>rangle yeah</p>
<p>he is proposing this</p>
<p>bill that everyone served</p>
<p>two years of service</p>
<p>mandatory service</p>
<p>whether it be in the military or military support</p>
<p>and the reason why he&rsquo;s proposing this</p>
<p>is because he believes that the war is</p>
<p>wrong and that he wants to</p>
<p>make a point by</p>
<p>if these congressmen</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t willing to go themselves</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not willing to send</p>
<p>their family</p>
<p>and their loved ones</p>
<p>then they shouldn&rsquo;t be supporting this war which is</p>
<p>very fair it makes sense but</p>
<p>the problem is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even offer that up as an option</p>
<p>as a rational option</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t offer up two years mandatory service</p>
<p>fuck you asshole</p>
<p>you know fuck you to make a</p>
<p>point you know if you want to make a</p>
<p>point do with your</p>
<p>mouth don&rsquo;t propose shit that will enslave people</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>throwback it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna work but</p>
<p>it works in</p>
<p>europe works</p>
<p>it works here israel</p>
<p>we had it here</p>
<p>for a long time we had a mandatory draft</p>
<p>until the 1960s</p>
<p>yeah but that</p>
<p>was that was a</p>
<p>draft that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit different this is mandatory service for</p>
<p>every single person</p>
<p>everyone served in certain</p>
<p>countries yeah</p>
<p>everyone served two years mandatory minimum</p>
<p>yeah but you know good luck charlie i mean</p>
<p>good luck trying to get well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna get it past and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he wants to get it passed but by</p>
<p>point he was</p>
<p>making a point but even that</p>
<p>point suggesting that is that&rsquo;s like fucking treason</p>
<p>i just agreed</p>
<p>it out there that that&rsquo;s a rational argument</p>
<p>you are lowering the</p>
<p>standards of opposition</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>if you are supposed to be the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s protecting us</p>
<p>from the military</p>
<p>industrial complex and the global machine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to be our</p>
<p>elected representatives</p>
<p>and our elected representatives are proposing</p>
<p>that everyone be enslaved by the fucking country</p>
<p>and being forced to do two years of mandatory</p>
<p>service no matter what your job is</p>
<p>fuck you exactly</p>
<p>fuck you by</p>
<p>the way by the way that&rsquo;s exactly what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about government will if you give if you</p>
<p>allow government to and i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about just any leviathan any huge</p>
<p>they will they will take your</p>
<p>power away from you</p>
<p>history shows that</p>
<p>time and time</p>
<p>again doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>right or left wing about that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>open a history book</p>
<p>yeah it runs on momentum</p>
<p>and the problem is</p>
<p>our society is so complex</p>
<p>that 90 of the people</p>
<p>90 of the time are doing shit</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want to be doing to support the machine</p>
<p>the machine is that big that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so good well</p>
<p>think about when</p>
<p>taxes are 48</p>
<p>in some brackets</p>
<p>or well actually in this country that 38</p>
<p>38 of your day is working for the government you 38</p>
<p>of your time you are working for someone else and you</p>
<p>never see the benefits of that you</p>
<p>think not only</p>
<p>that but your tax</p>
<p>money that you&rsquo;ve already paid</p>
<p>taxes on it</p>
<p>you get taxed</p>
<p>again when you buy</p>
<p>things your</p>
<p>sales tax exactly</p>
<p>oh and by the way when you</p>
<p>leave your inheritance to your kids you</p>
<p>that gets taxed oh and by the way at 60</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already been taxed yeah</p>
<p>and your social security if you die</p>
<p>before your social security the government gets that</p>
<p>money your family</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>money so all that</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;re putting away you better live</p>
<p>till you&rsquo;re 65 and then you get it in increments</p>
<p>so there are a lot of issues that</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t this the main</p>
<p>issue there&rsquo;s too many people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the main</p>
<p>issue the main</p>
<p>issue is this</p>
<p>thing is gigantic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>out of control and one of the reasons why</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s too many of us</p>
<p>people have been saying that for a long time and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s certainly an issue</p>
<p>but i happen to believe that</p>
<p>human beings with</p>
<p>technology and</p>
<p>their imagination will be able to accommodate</p>
<p>the 9 billion</p>
<p>people that are coming in the next 15 years</p>
<p>i mean 9 billion more no</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be at 9 billion in</p>
<p>about 15 years from most projections</p>
<p>in fact most of the</p>
<p>populations including the middle east the mean</p>
<p>age is 35 years old so</p>
<p>a lot of competent</p>
<p>countries are actually have</p>
<p>stable or negative</p>
<p>population growth</p>
<p>even in africa they just did a they just</p>
<p>these invest</p>
<p>like moody&rsquo;s or something said that africa</p>
<p>african bonds are actually</p>
<p>worth investing in because huge</p>
<p>swaths of africa are now seeing a middle class</p>
<p>360 million of them have cell phones</p>
<p>what comes with that</p>
<p>is less children</p>
<p>because as people</p>
<p>move into cities and away from rural areas</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have as many children</p>
<p>and so what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been surprising that nobody predicted in the 70s</p>
<p>when you had</p>
<p>things like the</p>
<p>population bomb that was written in</p>
<p>things is that</p>
<p>population in a lot of countries</p>
<p>especially europe</p>
<p>and now more and more in the middle east</p>
<p>has actually</p>
<p>started to stabilize and decline germany has a zero</p>
<p>population growth</p>
<p>really a zero zero</p>
<p>mexico mexico</p>
<p>which a lot of people</p>
<p>think well that you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exploding the</p>
<p>population because they have a lot of children here</p>
<p>mexico now is down to i believe</p>
<p>26 children</p>
<p>a couple when it used to be</p>
<p>literally you know</p>
<p>eight nine so people</p>
<p>people as they as they get access to information</p>
<p>say i want more for me why do i want 15</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s are fucking</p>
<p>crazy with kids man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like an insult somehow another you know</p>
<p>if you say something</p>
<p>about mexicans you know you say</p>
<p>which got like</p>
<p>eight kids and every</p>
<p>oh what are you racist</p>
<p>like no mexicans</p>
<p>have a lot of kids and kids are awesome</p>
<p>why is it a bad</p>
<p>thing to have a lot of kids</p>
<p>right dude you know i love</p>
<p>kids they work hard i love having kids they&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>like if you got</p>
<p>eight i&rsquo;m not hating on you</p>
<p>but why is it</p>
<p>funny that if you&rsquo;re mexican you have</p>
<p>eight kids you say that and be like oh yeah asshole</p>
<p>by saying that asshole</p>
<p>no certain cultural</p>
<p>things are very resilient it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>black people with chicken and watermelon</p>
<p>why is that bad chicken and</p>
<p>watermelon are both awesome yeah</p>
<p>you know i love them i love</p>
<p>watermelon it&rsquo;s fucking delicious and i love chicken</p>
<p>how come you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring up you know if you get</p>
<p>a black waiter</p>
<p>what would you</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;d like some chicken and</p>
<p>watermelon like that there&rsquo;ll be some tension but</p>
<p>a lot of that comes back to you know in the</p>
<p>in the 50s in the</p>
<p>south they would make posters of a</p>
<p>black you know of course i know</p>
<p>where it all comes from but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>2010 why are</p>
<p>we hanging on to that yeah man chicken is awesome</p>
<p>right fried chicken</p>
<p>tastes awesome</p>
<p>and watermelon</p>
<p>tastes awesome</p>
<p>how are those back</p>
<p>take the power away from chicken and</p>
<p>watermelon that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous i can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>till they combine the two although i&rsquo;m not a fan of the</p>
<p>grape soda huh</p>
<p>not really great</p>
<p>crush a great</p>
<p>crush in a bottle</p>

<p>elton john style sunglasses and they start</p>
<p>the trends they</p>
<p>start the fashion trends man</p>
<p>guys about that&rsquo;s gay and</p>
<p>then four years later they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>where that what&rsquo;s really funny is like</p>
<p>you know rob halford</p>
<p>is like the originator of all that</p>
<p>like leather</p>
<p>fucking dominatrix type shit</p>
<p>you know the way he dresses on stage</p>
<p>and he was gay</p>
<p>and he got all these people to</p>
<p>dress like him it&rsquo;s fantastic i mean how many people</p>
<p>dressed the way they</p>
<p>dressed you</p>
<p>know that wanted</p>
<p>to be like rockers because of rob halford</p>
<p>from judas priest yeah</p>
<p>fucking a lot of them he was gay he was gay</p>
<p>gay as fuck</p>
<p>so was pete townsend</p>
<p>pete townsend</p>

<p>pete townsend i</p>
<p>guess is i don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s gay or he did a</p>
<p>lot of gay shit he said he knows what it&rsquo;s like to be a</p>
<p>woman yeah he said i know and i remember</p>
<p>roger daltrey</p>
<p>heard that and</p>
<p>i thought we weren&rsquo;t talking about this i</p>
<p>pete townsend</p>
<p>fucked a couple of guys or got fucked i bet</p>
<p>dultry tried it too i bet they all did it i mean look i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s always that college</p>
<p>stuff i think</p>
<p>i was out of a</p>
<p>speedo all of a sudden i&rsquo;m gay</p>
<p>do we get raped on nas</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t i did not</p>
<p>we have a funny</p>
<p>story that we probably can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>probably tell that story</p>
<p>that was a weird situation</p>
<p>well you were</p>
<p>there so you saw it and i got vindicated in the end</p>
<p>of course you did</p>
<p>and i knew i was</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the situation that happened</p>
<p>brian had a friend and the friend</p>
<p>had a lady friend that happened to be an exotic dancer</p>
<p>and we went to told me to go he told him to go to</p>
<p>visit her at her</p>
<p>place of employment and you saw</p>
<p>the girl make a</p>
<p>bee line for me and</p>
<p>dance yeah not just dancing</p>
<p>she was she</p>
<p>hopped on top of brian</p>
<p>and immediately</p>
<p>straddled her vagina</p>
<p>onto his deck</p>
<p>and started</p>
<p>gyrating her</p>
<p>pussy and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>this girl wants a bang i go i know but i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>clearance for</p>
<p>my friend yet i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s allowed but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s insinuated but i</p>
<p>still wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna do it because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was ridiculous so</p>
<p>um you know i</p>
<p>think you asked me to go with you when you</p>
<p>dropped her off yes you</p>
<p>felt uncomfortable yes</p>
<p>i want you to</p>
<p>come yeah so</p>
<p>you got a headache</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m out of here i was like dude</p>
<p>you come with me because i&rsquo;m this is bad because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give me a ride</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s my girls</p>
<p>my boys girl</p>
<p>and and it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look good</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know if he turned into the wolf man</p>
<p>after i left no</p>
<p>no i was at the sheriff this is the but</p>
<p>can you say what she accused you of yeah</p>
<p>she accused me of making like getting</p>
<p>rough with her actually i found it</p>
<p>later i didn&rsquo;t even know that was the acquisition</p>
<p>shit that i actually got physical with her and</p>
<p>tried to you</p>
<p>know make her</p>
<p>kiss me and fool around with her and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>which is kind of like saying the guy</p>
<p>tried to rape me</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>at least when people hear that they go the guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>closet rapist</p>
<p>but what happened was</p>
<p>it was the hilton or the sheraton</p>
<p>and i was on the</p>
<p>third floor</p>
<p>which actually means the lobby</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>lobby the third</p>
<p>floor and so</p>
<p>i said she said let me use your bathroom and she</p>
<p>dropped me off</p>
<p>she goes i need to use your bathroom instead of</p>
<p>using the bathroom in the</p>
<p>lobby i need to use your bathroom</p>
<p>and we go to my room and i go i&rsquo;m dead</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in my room now</p>

<p>around with my friend better forgive me because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just a guy if he&rsquo;s like me</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>he shouldn&rsquo;t be attached to her anyway she&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on correct</p>
<p>but i and you thought</p>
<p>maybe that would have been the</p>
<p>you were thinking like i</p>

<p>money on you</p>
<p>which was really inappropriate anyway and</p>
<p>remember it was</p>
<p>twenty bucks i go give this to the valet</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll just say that you drop me off that</p>
<p>would be way better for me because this is already bad</p>
<p>sorry that situation</p>
<p>she gets up goes out</p>
<p>and the next day</p>
<p>or i guess that</p>
<p>weekend i booked that cbs show but i go back to do oz</p>
<p>and i literally nobody will look at me</p>
<p>and then i got written out and</p>
<p>i was the person that this happened there was a huge</p>
<p>scene he tried to</p>
<p>yeah you tried to attack him but you know he was like</p>
<p>the girl told him</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>you know he didn&rsquo;t know he thought this guy got what</p>
<p>she was crying</p>
<p>what she didn&rsquo;t want was</p>
<p>what she didn&rsquo;t want was</p>
<p>that she came back to your room she had a 12 year old</p>
<p>child she had a meal ticket</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden because she makes this mistake she had to sell</p>
<p>somebody down somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down the</p>
<p>river not her</p>
<p>daughter it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be me</p>
<p>right and so i</p>
<p>never held any i honestly</p>
<p>never held any resentment</p>
<p>i put myself in that position</p>
<p>i was responsible for it i paid a</p>
<p>price by the way i got</p>
<p>some people just can&rsquo;t help but be crazy</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very unfortunate</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a girl who&rsquo;s a you</p>
<p>know exotic dancer la</p>
<p>probably on drugs i mean a good percentage well</p>
<p>or she had a</p>
<p>twelve year old</p>
<p>daughter that that was</p>
<p>she went wow i got this chance to be with this guy</p>
<p>could be a star</p>
<p>and i just screwed that up</p>
<p>and i might have just</p>
<p>screwed that up and</p>
<p>you know i gotta silence my</p>
<p>phone i&rsquo;m sorry i thought i did</p>
<p>so i just never and we reconcile me and the guy</p>
<p>you love well he</p>
<p>found out the</p>
<p>truth and it was fine</p>
<p>yeah i saw him</p>
<p>like right after it happened</p>
<p>i know thank god what a mess</p>
<p>the whole thing was just such a mess</p>
<p>in a bad situation</p>
<p>i felt almost a little bit guilty that i had left her</p>
<p>alone with you</p>
<p>yeah because i</p>
<p>you know i knew you were</p>
<p>creeped out yeah i</p>
<p>was long as time ago</p>
<p>you were really</p>
<p>creeped out and</p>
<p>i was like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be alright</p>
<p>right and so i left i remember</p>
<p>that so well i remember you saying i have a headache</p>
<p>i go just drive</p>
<p>drive with us you know</p>
<p>like i can&rsquo;t do that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going home i remember that so well</p>
<p>yeah i just remember</p>
<p>when it was all</p>
<p>going down like when we</p>
<p>were at the club i was like this is nothing but trouble</p>
<p>this is a nightmare</p>
<p>this is a first of all she wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>attractive no</p>
<p>she was not i mean i&rsquo;m not bullshit no</p>
<p>she was an unattractive</p>
<p>girl she did not have a good body</p>
<p>did not have a good face and</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>gonna go get</p>
<p>dances there was a</p>
<p>bunch of really</p>
<p>attractive girls there</p>
<p>and you probably</p>
<p>would have picked someone else</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you were there for</p>
<p>so it was like she worked you for</p>
<p>money anyway</p>
<p>because you got in there and she</p>
<p>climbed on it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like she did she did work she did work because</p>
<p>she kept saying you want another</p>
<p>dance and you kept peeling off money i</p>
<p>remember i told you to sit next to me</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t look like you</p>
<p>just dancing on</p>
<p>me about dude you</p>
<p>gotta sit next to me because</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t want you know she&rsquo;s dancing on me the</p>
<p>whole time i even got you a</p>
<p>dance from another girl to</p>
<p>get her off your lap</p>
<p>i remember i paid a pretty girl to go over and</p>
<p>dance with him but you know what</p>
<p>now as you get older</p>
<p>you know what you do you get up and</p>
<p>leave yeah yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go there in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young we&rsquo;re such</p>
<p>idiots we were</p>
<p>such idiots</p>
<p>but we were</p>
<p>retarded but</p>
<p>sane enough to know that this was a</p>
<p>giant monster problem</p>
<p>that was just one step</p>
<p>along the way of me realizing that</p>
<p>crazy girls aren&rsquo;t really fun</p>
<p>used to think crazy</p>
<p>like remember me yeah dude i was the king of that</p>
<p>you dude no one no one</p>
<p>joe it&rsquo;s joe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sniffing out so fast he&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d i&rsquo;d be in this girl i mean dating her and like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d go she&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i go no no no no she&rsquo;s a good girl</p>
<p>no dude she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you need to run now</p>
<p>nah i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna listen joe</p>
<p>six months later pregnant what my house</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>an unusual ability to spot people who are off</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a smell that they have there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>that they communicate with me i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s cause i&rsquo;m a little aggressive</p>
<p>and even though</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really nice and friendly there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about me that just puts people on a little bit of an</p>
<p>edge you say i look like i</p>
<p>could be a douchebag</p>
<p>you saved me</p>
<p>but because of that but</p>
<p>because of that like because i have this</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>about me sometimes people get a little uneasy</p>
<p>and when people get a little uneasy just for a</p>
<p>second they reveal who they really are</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>about people when they know you&rsquo;re looking at them</p>
<p>they know you&rsquo;re paying attention to them it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re bombing on</p>
<p>stage you know that</p>
<p>hyper sensitive</p>
<p>feeling that you have of being judged and</p>
<p>watched and you&rsquo;re falling short</p>
<p>well when people are</p>
<p>crazy and you look at them funny</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>you try they&rsquo;ll just show it to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very just</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m crazy but</p>
<p>sometimes when</p>
<p>you do it to me it</p>
<p>creeps me out like alright this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna rape me</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>but used to</p>
<p>keep it together you</p>
<p>keep it together</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t snap</p>
<p>crazy people you have to</p>
<p>allow them to pretend that they&rsquo;re normal</p>
<p>you have to allow them you give them time you know</p>
<p>you have a conversation with them</p>
<p>things get rolling and you go well i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna let this guy get away with this all right bob</p>
<p>well very nice meeting you enjoy</p>

<p>this is not the girl you</p>
<p>wanna spend the</p>
<p>rest of your life with you i&rsquo;m losing you i remember</p>
<p>and i compared her to patty</p>
<p>cause his ex</p>
<p>girlfriends was like super cool</p>
<p>super intelligent like really fun to be around</p>
<p>this girl was just a zombie just a mess it was just</p>
<p>it was all bad energy</p>
<p>and fucking just</p>
<p>bad and then</p>
<p>he was like telling me that this is it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna settle</p>
<p>down i&rsquo;m like whoa you know having a kid is one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s not in your control but</p>
<p>you cannot fucking</p>
<p>marry this chick</p>
<p>like you should have</p>
<p>run away from her a long time ago yeah</p>
<p>and she was the best</p>
<p>thing i ever did</p>
<p>i was around so many of them</p>
<p>i got to smell them i got to know what they were well</p>
<p>la come on man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>place i never got used to i was</p>
<p>gonna say i</p>
<p>lived overseas the</p>
<p>point of that was</p>
<p>i can get used to anything la is the one</p>
<p>place i actually</p>
<p>never really got used to because you ran into so many</p>
<p>crazy people</p>
<p>yeah and people who</p>
<p>live in the rest of the country i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you really can understand</p>
<p>how nutty it is just</p>
<p>think of this place</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this place</p>
<p>where everyone gravitates to that has a deficit</p>
<p>like really needs</p>
<p>an incredible amount of attention</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re both guilty of it you know</p>
<p>i mean look there&rsquo;s only one way you become a comedian</p>
<p>you have to have a fucked up</p>
<p>childhood where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>loved enough</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just this fact</p>
<p>and it freaks my mom out</p>
<p>when i say that and it&rsquo;s not her and</p>
<p>she did her best</p>
<p>but my parents are divorced and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know my dad</p>

<p>but most people</p>
<p>no most people are</p>
<p>they have this</p>
<p>giant hole and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve made it to the top of the heap</p>
<p>because their</p>
<p>whole is so needy</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>stuffing things into it all the time</p>
<p>to try to stay</p>
<p>famous i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a mad sickness and an obsession</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s this one</p>
<p>place on the map</p>
<p>where everyone</p>
<p>gravitates to to try</p>
<p>to be the next that guy they want to be tom cruise or</p>

<p>of them they wanted to be a singer didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many of them it&rsquo;s like my</p>
<p>buddy was like my</p>
<p>buddy was like why does my dentist have a</p>
<p>screenplay fuck right</p>
<p>or a headshot or a headshot really jesus</p>
<p>you dig a little</p>
<p>bit and you find out everybody came out here oh</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s why you sit through traffic and</p>
<p>how many people try to get</p>
<p>you to read their shit</p>
<p>and we just had a situation</p>
<p>well dude i&rsquo;ve had so many situations</p>
<p>but guys who try to get me to produce their shit</p>
<p>like i have this idea i just want to produce a</p>
<p>pilot do you</p>
<p>think you can help me like</p>
<p>what are you talking about man</p>
<p>i deal with it</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>our favors everyone has favors to</p>
<p>like i need help can you</p>
<p>film this audition for me</p>
<p>or do this for that can you help me get in the comedy</p>
<p>a magic club</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t even know you do can i open for you</p>
<p>on the road it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s constant yeah and and</p>
<p>and you need</p>
<p>needs never good either</p>
<p>i mean did you ever</p>
<p>email someone and ask them if you can open for them</p>
<p>no especially when you were an open micer i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>open micers that ask</p>
<p>this is one kid</p>
<p>from england</p>
<p>and he sends me this</p>
<p>thing he says he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the youngest headliners ever in england</p>
<p>and he wants to co</p>
<p>headline with me</p>
<p>next time i do a gig up there</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>with this guy and that guy he&rsquo;s coming to america soon</p>
<p>what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about i need you yeah</p>
<p>you know what that&rsquo;s exactly what my show is missing</p>
<p>i need a co</p>
<p>headliner a</p>
<p>young co headliner just you</p>
<p>would decide that you</p>
<p>would attach yourself to someone else&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>i could even imagine</p>
<p>thinking like that</p>
<p>like if someone was playing in town like say</p>
<p>if when i was first</p>
<p>starting out you know bill hicks was coming into town</p>
<p>when i was an open micer</p>
<p>you know the idea that you</p>
<p>would call hey can i get</p>
<p>seven minutes on bill hicks a show</p>
<p>like what well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a question that a lot of just need a</p>
<p>constant need</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand you gotta earn</p>
<p>things and it takes time</p>
<p>yeah well there&rsquo;s plenty of</p>
<p>places to get on</p>
<p>stage the time to get on</p>
<p>stage is not during a professional show it&rsquo;s during all</p>
<p>those bringer shows and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>then you eventually put together an act and then people</p>
<p>put you on your show because they want you on the show</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go like</p>
<p>so listening forward on</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s shows but</p>
<p>stand up is also one of</p>
<p>those strange</p>
<p>things like acting but</p>
<p>especially stand up</p>
<p>where you know if you can be an actor it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you can be an actor and get away with it sometimes like</p>
<p>you can be a good looking 22 year old and get a show</p>
<p>and actually make a lot of</p>
<p>money for five years and then that parlay is no another</p>
<p>show and before you know it you&rsquo;ve got like a big</p>
<p>house and millions of dollars right</p>
<p>cause you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re somewhat emotionally available and you know but</p>
<p>a stand up is one</p>
<p>thing you cannot fake can&rsquo;t fake it</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t tell me you</p>
<p>wanna get into it when you&rsquo;re 38 it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be a waste of your time</p>
<p>see you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be willing to do the</p>
<p>things that you have to do</p>
<p>in order to get good at it</p>
<p>you have to live it</p>
<p>you have to be there</p>
<p>every night you have to perform</p>
<p>everywhere you</p>
<p>gotta do coffee shops and shitholes and</p>
<p>dive bars the only way</p>
<p>in is through and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>rhythm like i never</p>
<p>i never take</p>
<p>people ask me how come</p>
<p>i perform every week</p>
<p>well because if i take too much time off i lose my</p>
<p>rhythm like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a song in a way you know and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about it you&rsquo;re not writing new</p>
<p>stuff either you</p>
<p>gotta come you</p>
<p>gotta constantly be it&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>alive you have to keep it</p>
<p>alive if i don&rsquo;t perform every week</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go sometimes</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ll take a couple weeks off and then i do a show</p>
<p>i always feel it i always feel like a little off</p>
<p>but then when</p>
<p>you do like a weekend a long weekend somewhere</p>
<p>thursday friday saturday</p>
<p>you know by the time</p>
<p>sunday rolls around you just a juggernaut</p>
<p>yeah i liken it to sort of</p>
<p>i was in canada and it was a</p>
<p>sunday i had one of the best shows i&rsquo;ve ever had and</p>
<p>i likened to it i got this feeling i got this kind of</p>
<p>like kind of i felt like</p>
<p>this warm kind of</p>
<p>cloudy feeling</p>
<p>and i knew i didn&rsquo;t have to really do anything like</p>
<p>everything kind of took over</p>
<p>you ever feel that way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re outside</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re riding it i&rsquo;m coming up with jokes</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re coming to me on stage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that flow</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest feeling that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tuning in</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re channeling right</p>
<p>it is like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>channeling i always say that and i described this on</p>
<p>stage this way</p>
<p>that when i&rsquo;m at my best it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m a passenger</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m riding it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great story</p>
<p>about this the guy who won the</p>
<p>field medal in mathematics he was a guy</p>
<p>he figured out</p>
<p>a math equation they&rsquo;d been trying to figure out</p>
<p>since 1806 and the answer was</p>
<p>357 pages long or something like that yeah</p>
<p>gives you an idea so he wins the</p>
<p>field medal in mathematics which is</p>
<p>which is worth</p>
<p>a million dollars</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the nobel</p>
<p>prize for math</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s the fields</p>
<p>medal right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most prestigious</p>
<p>thing so this</p>
<p>genius he&rsquo;s the siberian guy</p>
<p>oh i heard about this guy he disappeared the</p>
<p>money yeah he did</p>
<p>well he disappeared</p>
<p>and they found him</p>
<p>in his aunts like</p>
<p>shack fishing shack like a year later</p>
<p>and they were like</p>
<p>you know bbc was like look you won this</p>
<p>feels metal</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you take it and he said</p>
<p>well you guys are worshipping the</p>
<p>wrong thing you</p>
<p>should be worshipping it&rsquo;s like worshipping the</p>
<p>radio the receiver instead of the actual</p>
<p>music because</p>
<p>the answer has always been in</p>
<p>the template in the sky i just happen to have a certain</p>
<p>frequency and</p>
<p>wiring that was able to channel it through my body</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worship</p>
<p>me for being</p>
<p>wired a certain way</p>
<p>i just channeled it worship</p>
<p>the actual equation i went you know what that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way of looking at</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what a lot of artists</p>
<p>believe you know</p>
<p>a lot of people call it the</p>
<p>muse and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>called it that for thousands of years that</p>
<p>you know something comes to you and gives you</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>you know like the</p>
<p>story you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna write already</p>
<p>exists what is the guy wrote the</p>
<p>war of art is that</p>
<p>press field</p>
<p>press field</p>
<p>press field</p>
<p>book great book</p>
<p>for creative people</p>
<p>who are into</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>something that gives you like inspiration to</p>
<p>write and work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good book it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the war for art and he talks</p>
<p>about war of art talks</p>
<p>about war of art talk</p>
<p>about he talks</p>
<p>about resistance</p>
<p>resistance is constant yeah but if you keep showing up</p>
<p>enough it&rsquo;ll the gods will kind of reveal</p>
<p>yeah in pieces</p>
<p>your story yes</p>
<p>and he talks very openly</p>
<p>about the idea that</p>
<p>you know amuse comes to him</p>
<p>and stephen king i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard him say something very similar as well</p>
<p>and i always say that i feel like when when my ideas</p>
<p>come to me when they come to me it&rsquo;s when i&rsquo;m empty</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m empty</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just filing in and i&rsquo;m just sort of sorting them out</p>
<p>along the way</p>
<p>when they come to me on</p>
<p>stage i&rsquo;ve had bits come to me on</p>
<p>stage full bits</p>
<p>me too me too</p>
<p>just comes to me</p>
<p>it might be two</p>
<p>three minutes long and i&rsquo;ll keep</p>
<p>going on it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s like inside of the sky</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>i allow myself</p>
<p>for that to happen on purpose i put myself in</p>
<p>tricky situations</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll put myself like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll start talking</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>where i don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>bit on it i don&rsquo;t even know what i&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll put myself in that situation so that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on my hyper comedy mode</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage and there&rsquo;s pressure</p>
<p>cause people are watching</p>
<p>and sometimes</p>
<p>it works and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>seems like i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about nonsense for</p>
<p>like a minute</p>
<p>and then i transition</p>
<p>quickly into something that i know is</p>
<p>gonna be funny let me get back but</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll go down a road and then oh look i</p>
<p>found a bag of gold and there&rsquo;s just this</p>
<p>and you almost</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take credit for that no you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>musicians talk</p>
<p>about it like</p>
<p>jazz musicians call it swinging</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;re out on that limb</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>swinging they</p>
<p>gotta find their way back in a thematic way</p>
<p>that comes back to the original tune they were playing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what milton went marseille</p>
<p>was on well you</p>
<p>know that exists in</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and that exists</p>
<p>in even in playing pool</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing in playing pool you call</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re in dead stroke</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in dead stroke</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your arm</p>
<p>is tuned into the</p>
<p>stick which is</p>
<p>tuned into the ball</p>
<p>which is tuned into the cloth</p>
<p>you know exactly how hard you</p>
<p>have to hit the ball to move it in a certain position</p>
<p>you know exactly what</p>
<p>kind of spin in english and it&rsquo;s all just automatic</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to think</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t miss</p>
<p>the stuff i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what i really</p>
<p>what drives me in art or whatever</p>
<p>you call it to</p>
<p>show up you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the flannery o&rsquo;connor is</p>
<p>great writer in the 30s died of</p>
<p>ms whatever</p>
<p>and she said i sit at my typewriter</p>
<p>every morning at 6 30 not to</p>
<p>write but in case something happens</p>
<p>sort of like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an act of</p>
<p>faith you know</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the press</p>
<p>field argument</p>
<p>that he believes that you show up and that the</p>
<p>muse will will</p>
<p>greet you that you put in the discipline</p>
<p>and it will</p>
<p>reward you you need to put in the discipline</p>
<p>the gods have to see that you are</p>
<p>worthy yeah</p>
<p>that was like</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>the first guy that i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard address resistance of the resistance to</p>
<p>right which i have very badly</p>
<p>i think everyone creative</p>
<p>does we all do it&rsquo;s like getting in the cold</p>
<p>water you know yeah</p>
<p>like you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you just you just like i</p>
<p>gotta get into this cold</p>
<p>water i know my body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna acclimate and once you</p>
<p>start flowing you&rsquo;re flowing but</p>
<p>the things i find to do every day</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>right like i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>clean the dishes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll make every</p>
<p>phone call i can</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll read articles on the</p>
<p>web that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with anything feed</p>
<p>off i&rsquo;ll find incredible websites</p>
<p>i beat off forget</p>
<p>it yeah the problem with the internet is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there on</p>
<p>your computer and so when you&rsquo;re supposed to be writing</p>
<p>i have this awesome</p>
<p>program it&rsquo;s called right room</p>
<p>check this out and</p>
<p>i have it for the mac</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>click on it</p>
<p>and it opens up</p>
<p>you lose everything on your desktop</p>
<p>see that like that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just green</p>
<p>green print</p>
<p>on a black background</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how i</p>
<p>write now because i&rsquo;m such a</p>
<p>monkey i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow myself</p>
<p>any any possible distractions i&rsquo;m just too</p>
<p>stupid you&rsquo;re in good</p>
<p>company so i but</p>
<p>why is it that so many creative people are like that</p>
<p>i mean why is it if you love</p>
<p>the idea of creating and i do</p>
<p>i love writing blogs i love putting them</p>
<p>up and getting feedback i love that people enjoy them</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m loving writing this book i love it like last</p>
<p>night i wrote a</p>
<p>bunch of good shit that i really enjoyed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>such a good feeling that i</p>
<p>go to and i go to bed like all</p>
<p>energized i feel like wow i did some good shit</p>
<p>but why is it that</p>
<p>like the next day</p>
<p>i will watch you</p>
<p>know 15 youtube</p>
<p>videos on the</p>
<p>2011 shelby mustang</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>for 45 minutes</p>
<p>550 horsepower man look at that aluminum</p>
<p>block that thing is the shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a modern muscle car</p>
<p>meanwhile i don&rsquo;t get any satisfied i leave</p>
<p>and i go to bed</p>
<p>when i do that feeling like</p>
<p>a loser stress stress yes</p>
<p>cause you haven&rsquo;t done your work exactly and</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>you know like really pretend that i&rsquo;m not disciplined</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m pretty disciplined</p>
<p>i get a lot of shit done</p>
<p>but not as much as i</p>
<p>could no i think</p>
<p>adderall i think</p>
<p>is that the key that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need that shit i know someone who&rsquo;s on that and</p>
<p>i think no pills</p>
<p>gonna take you away from the</p>
<p>human condition and the responsibility</p>
<p>of actually</p>
<p>what i think is neat</p>
<p>about art is that</p>
<p>creating things</p>
<p>usually you&rsquo;re creating something out of nothing</p>
<p>but not that it&rsquo;s not connected to</p>
<p>other things and other</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re trying to create something out of nothing</p>
<p>but the other</p>
<p>issue is that i find writing and</p>
<p>as you find your</p>
<p>voice and whatever you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually getting down and distilling</p>
<p>who you really are you get down to the core of</p>
<p>who you really are</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s way easier in life to pretend man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way easier in life to be a character it just is i</p>
<p>spent so much time</p>
<p>as a kid building</p>
<p>armor around myself because the</p>
<p>world was a dangerous place</p>
<p>and that really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>where my strength lay you know</p>
<p>but most of us are</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a saying i had</p>
<p>a teacher an old</p>
<p>teacher used to say in</p>
<p>order to be all</p>
<p>you can be you</p>
<p>got to face up to who you&rsquo;re pretending to be</p>
<p>yeah right and really i</p>
<p>think most of</p>
<p>us are walking around man playing a character and not</p>
<p>relieving you ever listen to conversations with people</p>
<p>standup exposes that but acting does not no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t acting reinforces that</p>
<p>those shields to get</p>
<p>thicker and deeper</p>
<p>probably i do</p>
<p>think that like someone like daniel day</p>
<p>lewis might be</p>
<p>he said something interesting he</p>
<p>was like why are you guys so interested in my process</p>
<p>i show up on a set having thoughts</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t belong to me</p>
<p>and talking like</p>
<p>away and he goes you know why i&rsquo;m an actor they go why</p>
<p>they go why why</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>essentially ashamed of</p>
<p>being a boring middle</p>
<p>class englishman</p>
<p>i live a boring life so i have to pretend it was so</p>
<p>great but he does in some way tap</p>
<p>into a real</p>
<p>yeah and he taps into a</p>
<p>truth within him i</p>
<p>think like he likes to find</p>
<p>that character within him that actually exists</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a past life well i</p>
<p>think what he&rsquo;s really good at he&rsquo;s really good at</p>
<p>becoming another</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real art in that you know what the</p>
<p>art is it&rsquo;s not judging that</p>
<p>other human being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the art is i</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>just becoming them</p>
<p>yeah like when you play like</p>
<p>robert duvall is playing</p>
<p>stalin and i</p>
<p>think he said well</p>
<p>how do you play a monster</p>
<p>he says he&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>monster and they said what he killed</p>
<p>40 million people he goes yeah but the actor can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that and</p>
<p>they said well what did you do and he said</p>
<p>i played a man trying to</p>
<p>solve a problem</p>
<p>and if that problem was too many people in the</p>
<p>ural mountains well i got to get</p>
<p>rid of them i&rsquo;m just trying to industrialize the soviet</p>
<p>union our problem is we&rsquo;re in the 1800s</p>
<p>i got to industrial</p>
<p>which means i got to move entire swass</p>
<p>of people over there</p>
<p>and by the way if you&rsquo;re in my way i</p>
<p>gotta i gotta kill you it&rsquo;s just easier</p>
<p>and it was really</p>
<p>interesting he said that&rsquo;s the way you can&rsquo;t judge</p>
<p>the person you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>those actors</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>breed that&rsquo;s a complete breed</p>
<p>apart from what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about we shouldn&rsquo;t even be calling them actors</p>
<p>cause they just</p>
<p>happen to choose acting the nutty people or</p>
<p>we should call them just</p>
<p>energy holes</p>
<p>you know whether they&rsquo;re actors or singers or</p>
<p>they could be</p>
<p>comic book artists or whatever the fuck they are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just those people that need</p>
<p>they just need attention</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference between that and like say a</p>
<p>somebody trying to say something yeah gary oldman</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an artist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a guy he becomes different</p>
<p>human beings i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>craft to it i</p>
<p>would probably be doing it regardless of</p>
<p>the company</p>
<p>or the he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>driven by by</p>
<p>kind of mining the</p>
<p>psyches of the</p>
<p>human mind yeah</p>
<p>the human psyche</p>
<p>and driven by you know just producing this</p>
<p>really perfect character</p>
<p>and heroin and driven by her</p>
<p>a little bit be honest is he</p>
<p>from what i</p>
<p>understand he likes it he likes his drugs</p>
<p>i guess he&rsquo;s better now it&rsquo;s amazing how much good</p>
<p>music has come from heroin</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people that were in heroin</p>
<p>you know what though there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>counter argument</p>
<p>to that and that is this that nick cantu is a rock</p>
<p>journalist in the 60s</p>
<p>wrote a book called the dark stuff</p>
<p>and a lot of people</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>what was really really</p>
<p>there was this explosion in</p>
<p>music and with the monterey</p>
<p>music festival and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>where the drug of choice at the time</p>
<p>was weed and</p>
<p>a little psychedelics hold on one</p>
<p>second key up</p>
<p>find it online</p>
<p>voodoo child</p>
<p>slight return</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a great</p>
<p>jimi hendrix is</p>
<p>if i had to choose like one</p>
<p>music to listen to for the rest of my life only one it</p>
<p>would be jimi hendrix songs as and you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>right there i&rsquo;m this guy</p>
<p>was a rabid</p>
<p>heroin user</p>
<p>he connected</p>
<p>to the fucking the vibrations</p>
<p>of the universe here&rsquo;s what here&rsquo;s what but this is</p>
<p>what here&rsquo;s what they find</p>
<p>what they believe killed that</p>
<p>music movement you had this incredible</p>
<p>successful music</p>
<p>what was heroin</p>
<p>and cocaine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>yeah and so what you had was a</p>
<p>bunch of musicians</p>
<p>in the 60s whose</p>
<p>heroes were who</p>
<p>the black blues musicians</p>
<p>and stanley crouch</p>
<p>wrote this really cool</p>
<p>essay that said</p>
<p>that what happened was guys like janis joplin</p>
<p>jim morrison</p>
<p>jimi hendrix etc</p>
<p>died all coincidentally at</p>
<p>27 was that</p>
<p>their heroes were</p>
<p>these blues</p>
<p>musicians who are doing drugs right</p>
<p>they they wanted to be like</p>
<p>their heroes</p>
<p>they were subscribing</p>
<p>they were subscribing</p>
<p>to an addiction as opposed to overcoming something</p>
<p>whereas the black</p>
<p>musicians who had to come in through the back door</p>
<p>and play for a</p>
<p>white audience</p>
<p>and eat a hot dog and a warm cup of coffee</p>
<p>they basically felt guilty as like survivor guilt</p>
<p>they were making all this</p>
<p>money and they were rich but they couldn&rsquo;t even play to</p>
<p>other black</p>
<p>people and they were living in the segregated society</p>
<p>so a lot of them went into drugs</p>
<p>as a way of dealing with that guilt</p>
<p>whereas you have</p>
<p>these white 60s</p>
<p>musicians who were like my hero did drugs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do drugs</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s part of being a rock and roller</p>
<p>problem is when</p>
<p>you choose heroin as your drug instead of weed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time staying</p>
<p>awake to write good</p>
<p>music that is true</p>
<p>what gives you</p>
<p>this inspiration and what connects you to the universe</p>
<p>utterly destroys your body</p>
<p>and makes you</p>
<p>a prisoner of it like cue it to the beginning of this</p>
<p>hit the very beginning</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the music</p>
<p>from the fucking 60s</p>
<p>especially like this kind of hendrix</p>
<p>do you know what i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something so universal</p>
<p>about it it just lasts</p>
<p>whereas like i believe they</p>
<p>were trying to say something for real and change the</p>
<p>world they were idealistic</p>
<p>to believe that they</p>
<p>could that&rsquo;s what because</p>
<p>everybody was high we live in a cynical time now</p>
<p>nothing nothing changes anything</p>
<p>right listen to this man</p>
<p>there have been nothing</p>
<p>remotely like this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>had done anything like this with a guitar before</p>
<p>have you heard anything even remotely like this</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>still to this day there&rsquo;s one guy that comes close</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a monster isn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>yeah dude it&rsquo;s just like this music is so good</p>
<p>it lasts for so long well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still awe inspiring now</p>
<p>yeah 40 years later the</p>
<p>layers to it and this is all psychedelic inspired</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s all a bunch of different drugs</p>
<p>and those drugs it&rsquo;s also 10 000 hours of practice yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that too it&rsquo;s that too it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the practice</p>
<p>makes the discipline in the practice makes the</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>the very best</p>
<p>antenna to tune in the magic of the universe</p>
<p>right and when you dissolve the ego</p>
<p>completely like when you do a lot of</p>
<p>psychedelics and you&rsquo;re an artist like jimi hendrix</p>
<p>you crush that thing</p>
<p>to the point where you just you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>open when you&rsquo;re on stage you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s doing something with a guitar in today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>world who i think is unbelievable is jack white yeah</p>
<p>from the white</p>
<p>stripes i don&rsquo;t know them enough oh oh he&rsquo;s love them</p>
<p>i know a bunch of their songs that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that i really</p>
<p>enjoy but i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know enough you got him live no no no he</p>
<p>never plays the same song</p>
<p>twice the same way ever really</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>i mean if you hear him you ever hear that song jolene</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m screaming</p>
<p>it totally or</p>
<p>that other song</p>
<p>he does stuff on a guitar that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jolene is that</p>
<p>dolly parton song</p>
<p>dolly parton</p>
<p>get the fuck out</p>
<p>of here that is</p>
<p>i mean hit the</p>
<p>queue that shit up red</p>
<p>this is the beautiful</p>
<p>thing about what we got</p>
<p>going on here dude</p>
<p>we got computers</p>
<p>it was like almost like a real radio show</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad that you know</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>greats that got into heroin</p>
<p>all wound up dying</p>
<p>you know really fucked up</p>
<p>dance janis joplin hendrix me so many</p>
<p>great musicians</p>
<p>what it did was</p>
<p>what it did was it kind of it robbed us</p>
<p>of what else they were</p>
<p>gonna be capable</p>
<p>of doing right but is the argument that it would have</p>
<p>never they would have</p>
<p>never been who they were without the drugs</p>
<p>and even though the drugs rob them it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>the amount of energy i mean</p>
<p>this is a shitty</p>
<p>argument but just for the sake of saying it</p>
<p>like think about what jimi hendrix</p>
<p>has done and the amount of impact that he had in such a</p>
<p>short life i mean i</p>
<p>think was he</p>
<p>28 or something when he died</p>
<p>he was 37 27</p>
<p>think about the amount</p>
<p>the impact that that guy had in</p>
<p>his short time on this</p>
<p>earth hold on</p>
<p>listen to this song</p>
<p>hold on a second</p>
<p>think about the impact that this guy had in a</p>
<p>short time on</p>
<p>earth in a short time</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>completely drugged out of his fucking head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this accelerated</p>
<p>burst of creativity</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>he used up all of his energy in one big explosion</p>
<p>well well is</p>
<p>it is that the case or did he already come to the</p>
<p>table before he</p>
<p>started doing drugs prodigiously</p>
<p>talented prodigiously technical on the guitar</p>
<p>and then slowly</p>
<p>eroded that</p>
<p>talent that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good possibility of that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s both</p>
<p>is the wrong song yeah no i&rsquo;ll find it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these motherfuckers what kind of a</p>
<p>radio show are we running here</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>if you are in your car</p>
<p>right now if you were at the gym</p>
<p>if you are on the</p>
<p>train on the way to work</p>
<p>i apologize</p>
<p>for the unprofessional behavior of here we go here</p>
<p>maybe worst recording of all time yeah</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m glad you guys are</p>
<p>just click on this one oh we&rsquo;ll find it</p>
<p>so this is jack</p>
<p>white and he&rsquo;s singing jolene</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>a dolly parton song that made me cry when i was 18</p>
<p>which i believe is about</p>
<p>her pleading</p>
<p>with her own addiction</p>
<p>which is jolene don&rsquo;t take my man away</p>
<p>wow i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compete with you</p>
<p>cause you what was her addiction</p>
<p>not this was she&rsquo;s writing for somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s into dig</p>
<p>okay we don&rsquo;t need this part</p>
<p>this is dumb</p>
<p>and we hear some</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the worst banter</p>
<p>ever dudes talking to the audience in between songs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got an awesome one though with paul stanley</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a compilation that some dude in</p>
<p>new york did</p>
<p>all paul stanley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cheesiest lines ever talking to the audience</p>
<p>yeah i gotta hear that it&rsquo;s fantastic i&rsquo;d love to</p>
<p>god damn watch this</p>
<p>when it goes away</p>
<p>okay dude that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a talented</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>unbelievable he filled the</p>
<p>whole kind of for me</p>
<p>that that when</p>
<p>kirk abain died he kind of replaced my kirk abain</p>
<p>for me really</p>
<p>yeah i need i need to pay attention more to them</p>
<p>i do he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total innovator and it&rsquo;s a two man band what is it</p>
<p>about someone</p>
<p>singing a really badass song that just really like</p>
<p>gives you a</p>
<p>burst in your body</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>dude it might be honestly to me the most</p>
<p>powerful art form and for that reason yeah you</p>
<p>literally feel inspiration and</p>
<p>energy yeah</p>
<p>this woman karen armstrong</p>
<p>wrote a book called a case for god and</p>
<p>it was like she was like you know people</p>
<p>while you have atheists</p>
<p>who talk they look at a</p>
<p>fundamentalist concept of god and she said look</p>
<p>she goes god is</p>
<p>not something you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to explain but</p>
<p>i can tell you when you listen to an incredible music</p>
<p>like an incredible</p>
<p>piece of music that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>profoundly sad</p>
<p>yet fills you with an inexplicable</p>
<p>joy or tabs</p>
<p>of energy or</p>
<p>quickening energy</p>
<p>that inspiration is</p>
<p>every bit as real as what you can</p>
<p>touch in front of you that is</p>
<p>maybe more real and what we stay alive for</p>
<p>and that is</p>
<p>she gives sort of a</p>
<p>she correlates that</p>
<p>with the divine</p>
<p>or the concept of a god or this benevolent</p>
<p>insane good that we can&rsquo;t really actually</p>
<p>measure or categorize</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of a cool book so what</p>
<p>music is is like an energy</p>
<p>source that we create an emotional energy source and if</p>
<p>you put the words</p>
<p>right and the</p>
<p>music right</p>
<p>and the right person delivering it with the</p>
<p>right amount of honesty</p>
<p>it just taps into</p>
<p>the very like</p>
<p>just the fiber of your being well</p>
<p>it just charges you well it&rsquo;s called harmony</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>greeks describe beauty</p>
<p>in one word socrates say how do you describe beauty</p>
<p>and aristotle</p>
<p>and socrates they always used one word harmony</p>
<p>so when you see a</p>
<p>cheater running</p>
<p>you say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful the reason you say it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>is because its body is working in such harmonious like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such lockstep with itself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i call</p>
<p>fights beautiful</p>
<p>whenever dude</p>
<p>smash guys i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>i always say look at this beautiful combination</p>
<p>and watch how he ends with this kick to the body</p>
<p>you see his</p>
<p>whole body cave in there&rsquo;s beauty in that man man</p>
<p>fighting to me</p>
<p>the reason i love watching</p>
<p>fighting and i always love to fight</p>
<p>when i was coming up and young and stuff</p>
<p>was that to me it is one of the purest</p>
<p>things someone can endeavor to do</p>
<p>because when you</p>
<p>fight like on the level like guys like nate</p>
<p>marcore anderson silva</p>
<p>it requires all of you it requires your cunning</p>
<p>your courage your strength your flexibility</p>
<p>people say oh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a horseback</p>
<p>rider you use every muscle in your body</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about get the ring and roll</p>
<p>around bro that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different muscle yeah you don&rsquo;t even have to sparr</p>
<p>anybody go punch the bag for</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>but also if you get</p>
<p>into a ring</p>
<p>and somebody&rsquo;s trying to kick you and</p>
<p>punch your head</p>
<p>you may not come out the same</p>
<p>you may be dead</p>
<p>you may be a</p>
<p>massive emotional charge connected to your performance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>fighting over</p>
<p>your very health your very health long term</p>
<p>not just tonight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you know if you</p>
<p>fight a really</p>
<p>scary dude you</p>
<p>fight in anderson silva</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>think that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change your</p>
<p>brain well if i</p>
<p>might head kick you and change your</p>
<p>brain it also faces</p>
<p>every man i believe</p>
<p>every man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biggest fear is that he&rsquo;s a coward like if you ask</p>
<p>every man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biggest aspiration as he want is to be a hero</p>
<p>and his biggest</p>
<p>fear is that he finds himself out to be a coward</p>
<p>and when you</p>
<p>fight and you put yourself</p>
<p>into a ring</p>
<p>where somebody</p>
<p>might kick and punch</p>
<p>you face up to that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why i have so much respect for fighters</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always found</p>
<p>fighting to be</p>
<p>when i watch a really</p>
<p>great fight i cry sometimes</p>
<p>because i find</p>
<p>it so dramatic and glorious do you have your pants on</p>
<p>i never wear my</p>
<p>pants i never wear my</p>
<p>pants i always wear a testicle</p>
<p>cinch though to keep myself disciplined a testicle</p>
<p>cinch it&rsquo;s made of</p>
<p>hemp rope it&rsquo;s made of hemp rope i can&rsquo;t go into it</p>

<p>of people recognize me from sex and the city but</p>
<p>they really recognize me from being an original cast</p>
<p>member on mad tv</p>
<p>the hangover did somebody just recognize me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll recognize myself sometimes</p>
<p>the mad tv thing was such a strange</p>
<p>thing man yeah you only did how many</p>
<p>seasons you do</p>
<p>two seasons</p>
<p>you got lucky</p>
<p>you escaped</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>weirdest environment</p>
<p>ever for like a talk show it was a bit of</p>
<p>yeah it was very weird</p>
<p>there was a lot of like</p>
<p>weird competition</p>
<p>and there was a lot of like</p>
<p>weird energy there yeah man</p>
<p>in a rough place you didn&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>right it was cool though i got</p>
<p>to meet artie</p>
<p>lang there too</p>
<p>yeah i didn&rsquo;t like it i</p>
<p>loved artie</p>
<p>how fucking</p>
<p>great is that guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great and how sad is his</p>
<p>whole situation man</p>
<p>well i think he</p>
<p>yeah i think artie just</p>
<p>has always struggled with</p>
<p>those demons</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know he attempted suicide and</p>
<p>stabbed himself</p>
<p>stabbed himself a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>funniest guy by the way for me</p>
<p>probably the funniest guy off the</p>
<p>cuff like the most improvisational</p>
<p>funny guy i&rsquo;ve ever met he was just</p>
<p>and a beautiful person</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy great guy always always</p>
<p>enjoyed running into him you know</p>
<p>and it made me really sad when i</p>
<p>would listen to him on the</p>
<p>stern show and i&rsquo;d hear how</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fallen</p>
<p>apart it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>very depressing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very depressing to see him that big</p>
<p>you know see</p>
<p>him not take care of himself and get that big yeah i</p>
<p>guess i don&rsquo;t know what his condition is do we know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of no i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i have no idea i have no information it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>weird situation man when you become that big fat guy</p>
<p>that everybody loves</p>
<p>because people love big fat guys that don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>and also joey</p>
<p>diaz so what happens if you lose weight does that mean</p>

<p>joey diaz is just he&rsquo;s such a character he&rsquo;s so great</p>
<p>one of the greatest</p>
<p>human beings i&rsquo;ve ever met one of the coolest</p>
<p>most interesting</p>

<p>people to hang out with yeah you know you know what man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy joey</p>
<p>diaz is a guy who&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>colorful and so</p>
<p>i see so many people who have</p>
<p>these friends</p>
<p>and you end up hanging out with a guy and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>laughing once</p>
<p>you hang around joey</p>
<p>diaz constantly</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>stare at him and listen to his amazing stories</p>
<p>our friend eddie bravo had a</p>
<p>wristband on once it was a</p>
<p>leather wristband</p>
<p>that he was wearing</p>
<p>in his rock and roll</p>
<p>man transformation</p>
<p>and he had this</p>
<p>leather wristband</p>
<p>on joey looks and goes</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>waiting for a fucking falcon to land on your arm</p>
<p>eddie got so pissed off</p>
<p>he was really</p>
<p>upset how is</p>
<p>eddie and he&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s good fucking</p>
<p>building a jujutsu empire</p>
<p>every time i see those</p>
<p>wristbands i&rsquo;m always like wow that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>what are you wearing i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find out</p>
<p>and that echoes in my</p>
<p>head that&rsquo;s one of my jokes i always talk</p>
<p>about if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna wear a cape you</p>
<p>gotta have a falcon</p>
<p>not a penguin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true right</p>
<p>accessory yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d love to i</p>
<p>think you can get laid into when</p>
<p>did the cake</p>
<p>totally fall</p>
<p>apart when was the last time someone</p>
<p>could rock a cave actually</p>
<p>have made a comeback i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the pope</p>
<p>and you can</p>
<p>bless a billion people like this you can</p>
<p>a cape other than that</p>
<p>maybe johnny depp</p>
<p>but when did it</p>
<p>go out of style</p>
<p>in the 1800s</p>
<p>1800s along with the</p>
<p>coach and buggy</p>
<p>and those crazy blonde wigs yeah dude because</p>
<p>nowadays you can&rsquo;t wear a cape</p>
<p>tape is very</p>
<p>handy you can doubles as a wrap</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bee swarm people like bees find</p>
<p>water you can</p>
<p>just be like whatever and just you know they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna sting a red tent</p>
<p>it was a mexican fear factor it was a</p>
<p>they made their own</p>
<p>stunts like really</p>
<p>dangerous low budget</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>a mexican host and the mexican guy wore a cape</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>there was one</p>
<p>that i saw well i don&rsquo;t know if you wore them in</p>
<p>every episode but mormon one that i saw</p>
<p>the guy was wearing a cape</p>
<p>and he was he had</p>
<p>these people go through</p>
<p>this burning</p>
<p>building and we did the</p>
<p>exact same stunt</p>
<p>but when we did it</p>
<p>they had fire suits on and helmets and shit and we had</p>
<p>people waiting with hoses and</p>
<p>people on standby but we lit this fucking</p>
<p>building on fire and they had to go in and rescue this</p>
<p>dummy and bring it out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult and hard to see</p>
<p>they did in shorts</p>
<p>they rebooted</p>
<p>people in fucking shorts</p>
<p>they were getting</p>
<p>third degree burns and shit running</p>
<p>through fire with shorts on</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re nuts</p>
<p>mexico doesn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fuck dude they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a shit they don&rsquo;t give a fuck they&rsquo;re tough</p>
<p>even the boxers like by the time</p>
<p>they closed down</p>
<p>they closed down a big part of arizona</p>
<p>national park in arizona because it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>too much mexican</p>
<p>gang member violence</p>
<p>from the drug cartels</p>
<p>beating over</p>
<p>in arizona well</p>
<p>the mexicans are very very much</p>
<p>like when you</p>
<p>watch the boxing</p>
<p>style they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>stand in a hole and just bang it out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no like moving out of the way just like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the punishment</p>
<p>and see who can</p>
<p>punch each other</p>
<p>well sort of</p>
<p>they enjoy vista</p>
<p>cuffs and brawls but</p>
<p>guys like chavez</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>he took a lot of shots he was very hard</p>
<p>to get he was very elusive for a guy that</p>
<p>would stay on top</p>
<p>of you mayweather</p>
<p>is always staying out of the way it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole deal before he even</p>
<p>learns how to fight it</p>
<p>mayweather is the most cautious</p>
<p>of all the boxers</p>
<p>even when he</p>
<p>hurts a guy and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pour it on</p>
<p>what would happen with him in</p>
<p>pacquiao who knows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>fight and i think</p>
<p>a lot of people want to see it it&rsquo;s a dangerous</p>
<p>fight for him</p>
<p>for mayweather it&rsquo;s dangerous is that why you</p>
<p>think he was saying</p>
<p>but pacquiao</p>
<p>could get fucked up to man mayweather is awesome</p>
<p>mayweather yeah he&rsquo;s so sharp</p>
<p>his technique is so good he has such a</p>
<p>deep knowledge of boxing he&rsquo;s also bigger than pacquiao</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s bigger</p>
<p>his technique</p>
<p>might be a little</p>
<p>cleaner a little less fat to it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>smart guy too</p>
<p>pacquiao is a wild man dude if you&rsquo;re looking like his</p>
<p>knockout of</p>
<p>ricky hatton</p>
<p>the way he took apart koto</p>
<p>dude he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>monster that little dude is so fast</p>
<p>his technique is so good too yeah</p>
<p>you know apparently</p>
<p>with kota when he was i was at that</p>
<p>fight and i was pretty</p>
<p>close to the ring and you could</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t hear this but</p>
<p>freddie roach</p>
<p>afterwards was saying that you know i was telling to</p>
<p>knock him out and</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t say this in so many words but i</p>
<p>heard this from somebody else</p>
<p>third person</p>
<p>paco kind of likes kota and didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>knock him out you</p>
<p>could see he</p>
<p>clearly had figured his number out he</p>
<p>could figure he got his whole game</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put him he didn&rsquo;t put him away he was just</p>
<p>hitting them but he he actually liked him and knew he</p>
<p>could really hurt him but didn&rsquo;t on really yeah</p>
<p>and before that</p>
<p>fight i was with some</p>
<p>people who were friends with</p>
<p>him like like jeremy piven who was doing a documentary</p>
<p>about his life</p>
<p>he looked over</p>
<p>you never see a</p>
<p>fighter do this</p>
<p>he looked over and went</p>
<p>how are you and it was doing and like</p>
<p>he was like had walked into a club he was that relaxed</p>
<p>wow and then just went in there and i remember</p>
<p>watching when</p>
<p>as soon as code i</p>
<p>think realized</p>
<p>that pacquiao had figured his game out</p>
<p>like his whole jig was up and all he had was just</p>
<p>cover and he just jab and cover</p>
<p>that must be pretty frustrating fuck</p>
<p>yeah when you see a guy all of a</p>
<p>sudden just get lit up</p>
<p>like you remember when pacquiao fought</p>
<p>oscar de la hoya</p>
<p>and you could see like somewhere in like the</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>oscar de la</p>
<p>hoya had this look in his face like what the fuck what</p>
<p>just happened</p>
<p>like i can&rsquo;t even hit this dude like</p>
<p>this dude is just</p>
<p>levels above</p>
<p>me and i just got to go into a shell here and survive</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>fights a little bit like duran did</p>
<p>yeah a little bit yeah a little bit</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>style of his own you know</p>
<p>his leg movement</p>
<p>is like he&rsquo;s ability to leap in and leap out</p>
<p>you know how fast he is and how mobile he is</p>
<p>and how hard he hits too he&rsquo;s a bad little</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s almost as hard as monogamy</p>
<p>but anyway what what the</p>
<p>fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about so you have a two and a half year old</p>
<p>right i have a two and a half year old we</p>
<p>still haven&rsquo;t gotten our kids together this is</p>
<p>ridiculous i know we</p>
<p>both have two year olds yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost exactly the same</p>
<p>chuck e cheese&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both so similar</p>
<p>in the fact that we&rsquo;re always so fucking busy we</p>
<p>never get anything</p>
<p>done that we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing yeah i know</p>
<p>we gotta do that though man it&rsquo;s always so</p>
<p>much fun yeah you&rsquo;re like one of my best friends that i</p>
<p>never say i know it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>sad how far is always</p>
<p>the same where do you live</p>
<p>venice you still live in venice</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about moving out though yeah you</p>
<p>gotta get out of gangland</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on an episode of gangland this</p>
<p>month is it</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m sure it has been</p>
<p>they have fucking tampa</p>
<p>is on gangland they find</p>
<p>gangs in tampa there&rsquo;s a lot of gangs</p>
<p>everywhere man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a dumb show boy you ever</p>
<p>watch that gangland no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary it makes you</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s gangs</p>
<p>everywhere and everyone</p>
<p>shoot everybody i like the</p>
<p>first 48 you ever</p>
<p>watch that show yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my new</p>
<p>favorite show</p>
<p>i love that show</p>
<p>those shows are all educating</p>
<p>criminals now and they know what not to do you know</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>a lot of crime though is passionate</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking and you</p>
<p>leave a trail</p>
<p>and with technology</p>
<p>the other thing is</p>
<p>about that survivor guy do you know the guy who was</p>
<p>one of the producers of survivor</p>
<p>and his wife</p>
<p>turned up missing in mexico</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>found her in a sewer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>over in america and they&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna charge him deport him to mexico and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>killed his wife</p>
<p>fucking arguing</p>
<p>screaming and yelling the people</p>
<p>heard screaming and yelling and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>she disappear</p>
<p>a little too hard</p>
<p>fuck what do i do now</p>
<p>how scary is</p>
<p>that people that are involved in relationships that are</p>
<p>they hate each</p>
<p>other so much they just resort to killing each other</p>
<p>in a marriage like</p>
<p>you gotta know why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re killing someone like oh my god my life is over</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking killing</p>
<p>this i gotta be honest</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had girls</p>
<p>bring me to that list level</p>
<p>you have i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s good i&rsquo;ve gotten out of that but i</p>
<p>have been in some awful</p>
<p>just i&rsquo;ve been outside of myself</p>
<p>watching myself just behave like a huge</p>
<p>a hole we&rsquo;re both similar also in that we have</p>
<p>we were both taking chances on a lot of really</p>
<p>crazy chicks just because it was fun yeah you</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they are fun by the way when we</p>
<p>first came to hollywood we both did the</p>
<p>exact same thing because we used to talk</p>
<p>about it all the time</p>
<p>we would date someone that was just like fucking</p>
<p>completely insane but it was like</p>
<p>eh no big deal it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>that phil hartmanship</p>
<p>cleared all that up</p>
<p>for me for good</p>
<p>when phil hartman got murdered</p>
<p>by his wife</p>
<p>i was like okay no more</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay i just figured this out</p>
<p>i thought it was fun</p>
<p>this is not fun yeah it&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>this is crazy what you bring into your life man</p>
<p>yeah and you see dudes do it</p>
<p>all the time it makes things more</p>
<p>exciting and it&rsquo;s a good distraction too</p>
<p>because especially in the stress of hollywood and</p>
<p>the stress of</p>
<p>trying to make it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sometimes the stress is so overwhelming</p>
<p>you just want to get lost in something else so you end</p>
<p>up having a lot of sex</p>
<p>or you say you call it</p>
<p>voodoo punani but</p>
<p>you know dove</p>
<p>davidoff says you know if love was a drug</p>
<p>people would be like dude stay away from that</p>
<p>stuff you could lose your house</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny it&rsquo;s the wrong kind of love</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true it is it&rsquo;s totally true well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even just a love</p>
<p>you can call it love but really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the weird connection that people have to each</p>
<p>other where they need each</p>
<p>other you become connected like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bridge</p>
<p>between you and this person</p>
<p>and you literally need them in your life</p>
<p>you can shake yourself of it but it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>getting out of a relationship i mean</p>
<p>twice how many dudes</p>
<p>have you seen that</p>
<p>their girl breaks up with them and then</p>
<p>starts dating someone else that they know and they</p>
<p>literally go insane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like someone</p>
<p>stealing happiness from you</p>
<p>right in front of your eyes</p>
<p>you can never accept the fact that this is just a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t like you anymore and likes this</p>
<p>other human being well it also comes down that a</p>
<p>lot of people i believe get into relationships just so</p>
<p>they can control someone else with</p>
<p>their emotions and with their</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other thing</p>
<p>a lot of it really is what you learn from</p>
<p>watching your parents and if your parents are</p>
<p>fucked up and a lot of people&rsquo;s ours it takes a lot to</p>
<p>a lot of people&rsquo;s parents are really fucked up</p>
<p>right it takes a lot to overcome that</p>
<p>early programming</p>
<p>absolutely man</p>
<p>i think a lot of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what you think</p>
<p>about this but i was</p>
<p>thinking about i</p>
<p>think a lot of making a relationship work is just</p>
<p>first of all having very low</p>
<p>expectations</p>
<p>and then also coming to the equation</p>
<p>and staying in the equation</p>
<p>as a very independent person</p>
<p>yeah you have</p>
<p>to be independent and you also have to grow together</p>
<p>and you also have to be really honest with each</p>
<p>other and you also have to</p>
<p>find one who&rsquo;s not nuts and you have to not be nuts too</p>
<p>in order to find one who&rsquo;s not nuts</p>
<p>you have to not be nuts as well</p>
<p>absolutely in</p>
<p>order to find a nice person you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta be nice you gotta be</p>
<p>worthy of a nice person</p>
<p>i had the best</p>
<p>advice someone ever gave me to make a relational</p>
<p>board goes he said</p>
<p>he had been</p>
<p>married for</p>
<p>25 years ago what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>secret he goes dude</p>
<p>i know we learn how to fight</p>
<p>we learned that there are</p>
<p>boundaries and</p>
<p>places you don&rsquo;t go we</p>
<p>learned how like when we were</p>
<p>frustrated or</p>
<p>angry with you</p>
<p>never get shitty with each</p>
<p>other don&rsquo;t insult each other</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get violent</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t throw</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>my stuff don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t call work and be a cunt</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get nutty don&rsquo;t interfere with</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s a way to</p>
<p>fight and if you</p>
<p>learn how to how</p>
<p>to you know</p>
<p>release the tension or whatever you&rsquo;ll you can</p>
<p>make it work for a long time are you listening my son</p>
<p>yes what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>is i was in a relationship that was so bad at one</p>
<p>point that i had to</p>
<p>start recording her</p>
<p>you know as evidence and i&rsquo;m like i remember thinking</p>
<p>going you were mel</p>
<p>gibson&rsquo;s mistress i was</p>
<p>thinking like this</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s so bad</p>
<p>that i am recording people for evidence i need to get</p>
<p>out of this relationship</p>
<p>and do you have</p>
<p>those tapes yeah</p>
<p>can we do something with</p>
<p>those well be</p>
<p>about names</p>
<p>perhaps it depends</p>
<p>yeah maybe maybe</p>
<p>about names</p>
<p>we could speed it up yeah let&rsquo;s just change the</p>
<p>sound of the</p>
<p>voice just to we</p>
<p>just a wee bit</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard about</p>
<p>these i think</p>
<p>those would be interesting</p>
<p>it would take me a</p>
<p>while to find them but yeah</p>
<p>that mel gibson one that boy whoo</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another example what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about actors being fucking</p>
<p>crazy and thinking that you know that they&rsquo;re much more</p>
<p>important and interesting than the arm because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>successful and he</p>
<p>might people kiss</p>
<p>their ass yes</p>
<p>yeah i think so too</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s an alcoholic and you</p>
<p>know dr drew was talking</p>
<p>about him and</p>
<p>he was saying that it seems like he&rsquo;s probably relapsed</p>
<p>like if you listen to the</p>
<p>way he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like and</p>
<p>he has some sort of a mental</p>
<p>issue a bipolar</p>
<p>issue or something but yeah</p>
<p>but you know how much</p>
<p>maybe that came from being an actor</p>
<p>maybe they came from</p>
<p>people kissing your ass on the set you</p>
<p>start believing it</p>
<p>i did and then the part of rational part of your</p>
<p>brain just stops working</p>
<p>just like a guy who takes</p>
<p>roids and his balls</p>
<p>shrink man i also</p>
<p>think that acting when you&rsquo;re on a set all day</p>
<p>it gets so boring</p>
<p>cause real acting on a</p>
<p>movie is waiting around all day like i did this</p>
<p>movie with nick nolte</p>
<p>in pittsburgh</p>
<p>and nick&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>is this the</p>
<p>mixed martial</p>
<p>arts yeah and he&rsquo;s been doing this is the one</p>
<p>where you play me yeah i play you oh yeah yeah oh</p>
<p>by the way by the way there&rsquo;s a movie</p>
<p>coming out called warrior</p>
<p>that just tested through the roof for lions gate</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got tom hardy and nick nolte</p>
<p>and and and</p>
<p>this guy this</p>
<p>australian actor joe lettrich</p>
<p>and and some really</p>
<p>great actors but anyway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>great movie</p>
<p>but i i play joe rogan</p>
<p>i i to prepare for the role</p>
<p>i literally</p>
<p>watched about 5</p>
<p>50 hours of you</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>on ufc remember i called you</p>
<p>about it and i</p>
<p>said you know and you said just take yourself</p>
<p>out of the equation</p>
<p>as an announcer</p>
<p>anyway i watched you and</p>
<p>watched you</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve gotten some rave reviews for my performance</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>thank you to</p>
<p>my friend joe rogan i can&rsquo;t wait to see it i</p>
<p>literally played you i was like how</p>
<p>would joe do this and then i just was you</p>
<p>give us an example like</p>
<p>were you real technical</p>
<p>or did you i used i used words like wow</p>
<p>and that there that&rsquo;s a huge move</p>
<p>cute you know just that like joe gets</p>
<p>joe really gets huge with his words</p>
<p>and by the way he loves the game</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll tell you and i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>other people say this who really know sport</p>
<p>you are as good as it gets</p>
<p>at what you do when it comes to calling those</p>
<p>fights you&rsquo;re so knowledgeable you&rsquo;re so passionate</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know of anybody who can call a fireplace well</p>
<p>thanks man but</p>
<p>you know what honestly</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just a professional fan it&rsquo;s easy because of</p>
<p>stand up because</p>
<p>stand up is so difficult</p>
<p>and you get</p>
<p>really good at communicating and you get really good at</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>economy of words and</p>
<p>how to set things up</p>
<p>and really self</p>
<p>aware of how you sound</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re amazing stand up</p>
<p>so much harder that</p>
<p>doing commentary is</p>
<p>way easy but you know who else is</p>
<p>great as goldie</p>
<p>gold&rsquo;s great he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phenomenally the poetry he</p>
<p>uses like he&rsquo;s a poet man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a poet he&rsquo;s so impressive</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>smooth you know</p>
<p>and people give him a hard time</p>
<p>about saying</p>
<p>stupid shit what you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand is how much of that he&rsquo;s just winging</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s winging</p>
<p>a big chunk of the</p>
<p>stuff that he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>and sometimes</p>
<p>when you wing shit it does always come out</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck in a bad spot and you got to</p>
<p>correct yourself a little bit</p>
<p>and we goof on each</p>
<p>other every now and then if we say</p>
<p>stupid things</p>
<p>what he does</p>
<p>is very hard to replace you know i</p>
<p>tried doing his job once and i was terrible at it no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very specific</p>
<p>skill it is it is it&rsquo;s a very specific skill</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the best there is at it so it&rsquo;s pretty fun</p>
<p>you are you</p>
<p>spent like two</p>
<p>months in pittsburgh doing that yeah</p>
<p>and you know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>worth it at the end of the day it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great movie so when does it come out</p>
<p>well they were</p>
<p>going to release</p>
<p>it september but it tested so high that i</p>
<p>think lionsgate wants to push it toward the oscars</p>
<p>from what i&rsquo;m told so</p>
<p>maybe december or something</p>
<p>do you feel like it&rsquo;s that good did you like it i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it yet i just saw clips</p>
<p>but what kind</p>
<p>you like the</p>
<p>movies that you&rsquo;re in are you one of</p>
<p>those dudes that even know that</p>
<p>you what you</p>
<p>i watch the</p>
<p>hangover once</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m almost</p>
<p>never nobody believes me but i</p>
<p>never watch what i do</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m too</p>
<p>critical of you hate</p>
<p>those guys though that if they do something all the</p>
<p>sudden it&rsquo;s awesome and they love it</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t admit like</p>
<p>bob your show sucks yeah it goes back to being</p>
<p>not honest with</p>
<p>yourself and not having perspective i mean you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>what i do because i&rsquo;m already critical enough and</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>about the movie that comes out as the</p>
<p>experience it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>sometimes you have a really good time having a</p>
<p>laugh on a set and doing</p>
<p>and acting or making believe that&rsquo;s fun for me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>i do it cause it&rsquo;s fun i think</p>
<p>where i feel artistic is when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>with stand up</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m writing my own</p>
<p>stuff and i&rsquo;m kind of expressing myself that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a different</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>motivation for it yeah fuck yeah that&rsquo;s the most fun</p>
<p>thing and by the way</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>stand up is you can</p>
<p>never lie to yourself because</p>
<p>you get up on stage</p>
<p>they either</p>
<p>laugh or they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty brutal if it</p>
<p>starts going</p>
<p>south man and you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>middle of nowhere and somebody&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t be faking what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that you</p>
<p>think you have to really be connected to it in</p>
<p>order to be good</p>
<p>and let me ask you this about stan</p>
<p>about not to pretend</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>standard thing but the</p>
<p>other thing is</p>
<p>i thought about this somebody</p>
<p>asked me some</p>
<p>advice i go well just write with</p>
<p>your what you</p>
<p>think is funny but</p>
<p>in a way if you&rsquo;re trying to be funny</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>just expressing</p>
<p>yourself honestly in a way that makes you laugh</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying the audience kind of feels you manipulating them</p>
<p>they feel the lie</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never as funny</p>
<p>do you know what i mean</p>
<p>by that and it</p>
<p>might work a little yeah it does if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing it for you did you see for a long time</p>
<p>comedian i did</p>
<p>see comedian yes i did</p>
<p>so then you saw</p>
<p>orney adams performing</p>
<p>yes i did and that&rsquo;s the kind of comedy i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s the kind of it does work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>well you know and</p>
<p>and when people don&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like that that sort of</p>
<p>style is like a style</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>style that will work in a crowd</p>
<p>but will not work one on one</p>
<p>like joey diaz can tell you something one on one</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just as fucking</p>
<p>funny as if you</p>
<p>stand in front of 300 people saying it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of comedy that&rsquo;s like rhythm</p>
<p>and premise and</p>
<p>enunciation</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a song i can</p>
<p>hear the punch line coming but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny as opposed</p>
<p>to honest expression but they</p>
<p>still work it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still work but then that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between a hack and a real</p>
<p>comic in my</p>
<p>opinion not</p>
<p>to be too much of a purist that way but yeah</p>
<p>like when someone is like on</p>
<p>stage and they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>angry at something that they&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>why do i get</p>
<p>two receipts</p>
<p>what is this it kills</p>
<p>you crazy like are you really mad it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>piece of paper you put in your pocket and you leave</p>
<p>somebody said i walked in</p>
<p>and i heard a guy like that and i went like</p>
<p>this i walked in i went oh i can&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t stay here</p>
<p>yeah and my</p>
<p>buddy comes</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be that judgmental and i go</p>
<p>dude i know that song</p>
<p>i can hear two bars of that song and i know exactly</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going i&rsquo;ve been doing it too long</p>
<p>you know and it makes you feel unfunny</p>
<p>the thing is when you</p>
<p>watch someone who</p>
<p>sucks it&rsquo;s uninspiring it takes all the energy out of</p>
<p>me exactly i worked with this guy</p>
<p>and i my opener couldn&rsquo;t make it like on a last minute</p>
<p>and so i work with this</p>
<p>local guy and this</p>
<p>local guy not</p>
<p>only did he suck he went on for 45 minutes and he did a</p>
<p>bunch of my shit</p>
<p>no yeah he did like reworked</p>
<p>bits that were like</p>
<p>from my old cds and he did this before he brought me up</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know if he was doing it</p>
<p>to be a dick and step on my material if he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t even do</p>
<p>those anymore he&rsquo;s like years and years old</p>
<p>or if he was trying to</p>
<p>fuck with my head or if he&rsquo;s so retarded that he just</p>
<p>this is what he does he just</p>
<p>steals shit</p>
<p>everywhere and he forgets</p>
<p>where it came from and</p>
<p>so i went on</p>
<p>after him and i had</p>
<p>to jolt myself to be funny</p>
<p>like i had to listen to</p>
<p>it because i wanted to know what the fuck he was saying</p>
<p>once i heard some of my material i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>now i have to listen to this guy because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want i mean what if he does something that i do do</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna repeat it</p>
<p>so i have to listen this fuck now</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m listening to this guy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sucking all the inspiration out of my brain</p>
<p>nothing he says he believes</p>
<p>everything he says is just</p>
<p>angry and stupid and</p>
<p>somebody said</p>
<p>they said how do you know this</p>
<p>woman asked how do you know gene</p>
<p>hackman&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great actor what&rsquo;s your criteria and she goes</p>
<p>cause i always believe him</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s the same kind of</p>
<p>thing yeah he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same thing with the</p>
<p>comic that you go</p>
<p>oh i always believe you like daniel day</p>
<p>lewis you don&rsquo;t have to go into it</p>
<p>do you believe him or not you know</p>
<p>yeah i mean and you know yourself</p>
<p>when stuff connects and</p>
<p>stuff is real</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a process in</p>
<p>developing material</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of times you</p>
<p>go down a path and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing there for you you thought there was you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking around with it but for whatever reason it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>that is a part of the process</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a big difference between that</p>
<p>which is just like</p>
<p>you know someone trying to find the comedy</p>
<p>and someone forcing it</p>
<p>someone like well</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve written plenty of</p>
<p>things where i know</p>
<p>people would</p>
<p>laugh i&rsquo;ll come up with</p>
<p>a thing and it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>trick and you go that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trick i can&rsquo;t do it though because it&rsquo;s not me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a trick on the audience that&rsquo;s just there to be</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s like a surprise like a</p>
<p>magic trick like oh here&rsquo;s this like</p>
<p>man i wanna be that</p>
<p>guy and that</p>
<p>that sort of</p>
<p>takes you out of who you are when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage cause then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of that</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of that then</p>
<p>it takes away from the</p>
<p>muse whatever that</p>
<p>weird connection is</p>
<p>where you feel like you&rsquo;re a passenger exactly</p>
<p>you had sex with christie</p>
<p>alley right whoa</p>
<p>i did not what the fuck</p>
<p>might have stepped up but at the hell</p>
<p>brian i did the show this is</p>
<p>great i didn&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>is this the</p>
<p>whole point i thought</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be an ambush man it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m being ambush</p>
<p>trick oh can i</p>
<p>plug that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be yeah</p>
<p>where you at</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be at the irvine improv tomorrow</p>
<p>headlining 8 o&rsquo;clock irvine improv</p>
<p>oh the irvine improv is the shit i just had a</p>
<p>whole weekend there that</p>
<p>place is awesome i love it</p>
<p>irvine is awesome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another good</p>
<p>place you might a little</p>
<p>go family man</p>
<p>joe did you</p>
<p>see the nick diaz response to last week&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>upset at mayhem</p>
<p>yeah good you know what nick diaz</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying also that mayhem</p>
<p>is too big that he wants</p>
<p>why does it mayhem come down to one</p>
<p>seventy why you picking on me i&rsquo;m you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>smaller than you</p>
<p>which is true</p>
<p>you know mayhem can</p>
<p>never make one</p>
<p>seventy i mean</p>
<p>he made it a long time ago when he fought</p>
<p>gsp but he had to starve himself and get down there</p>
<p>you know me</p>
<p>think diaz is a natural one seventy</p>
<p>what what is</p>
<p>your call if i don&rsquo;t put you on a spot but if gsp</p>
<p>fought anderson&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>well if he gained weight the correct way</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>would be very</p>
<p>very interesting because will they do that anderson</p>
<p>is definitely the best</p>
<p>wrestler that</p>
<p>or gsp rather is</p>
<p>definitely the best</p>
<p>wrestler that anderson has fought</p>
<p>but physically he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smaller man you know</p>
<p>anderson is really tall</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s tall i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s 6'3 6'2 or 6'3</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really long man he&rsquo;s really long with his</p>
<p>limbs that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he can go up to 205</p>
<p>and then down to 85</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>could make 170 though he&rsquo;s thought</p>
<p>about it he</p>
<p>might be able to but it might be</p>
<p>too much of a</p>
<p>strain on him</p>
<p>but at 185 man he&rsquo;s hard to fuck with</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so fast</p>
<p>is that what it is yeah and if he</p>
<p>stand in front of gsp and gsp you know</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take them down or if he decides to</p>
<p>trade with them and gets caught</p>
<p>and anderson</p>
<p>catches you he&rsquo;s so fucking accurate but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a big test in</p>
<p>chael sunnin</p>
<p>because chael sunnin</p>
<p>the fight that he&rsquo;s having on august 7th</p>
<p>that is the biggest guy</p>
<p>at 185 that&rsquo;s a wrestler</p>
<p>chao&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>motherfucker is he really well you saw him</p>
<p>manhandle nate markquart</p>
<p>anybody that can do that to</p>
<p>nate markquart</p>
<p>nate markquart is no joke he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beast nate markquart is a fucking</p>
<p>beast but you know</p>
<p>chelsea and handle</p>
<p>this wrestler i</p>
<p>think greco</p>
<p>roman guy yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a beast too</p>
<p>and he is his double</p>
<p>his power double</p>
<p>he runs through</p>
<p>guys it&rsquo;s like impossible to stop almost</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s gonna sum</p>
<p>up if he tries</p>
<p>to if he tries to</p>
<p>trade with yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be intrigued</p>
<p>everybody who</p>
<p>tries to trade with anderson gets fucked</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s too accurate he&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>slick he has</p>
<p>an athletic ability</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very rare he</p>
<p>has this ability to move in and out so fast</p>
<p>if you look at the damian maya</p>
<p>fight like how</p>
<p>quickly he can</p>
<p>launch an attack</p>
<p>and move forward and spring at you and tag you</p>
<p>the knee that he hit maya with</p>
<p>was like no wind up</p>
<p>he just leapt through the air and</p>
<p>smashed him with a fucking flying knee</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very few</p>
<p>humans that</p>
<p>he looks like he&rsquo;s got springs in his</p>
<p>body the way</p>
<p>he handled forrest griffin nobody&rsquo;s ever been able to</p>
<p>do that to forres griffin is huge huge huge and a good</p>
<p>punch a kicker</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>solid 230 before he cuts down at 205 he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant light</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>and anderson just</p>
<p>ate him up he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a freak</p>
<p>but the other</p>
<p>thing would</p>
<p>be can you stop the shot that</p>
<p>would be the</p>
<p>thing the other guy like that is</p>
<p>fedor i&rsquo;d love to see him</p>
<p>fight brock i know</p>
<p>i know he got caught in that and nothing</p>
<p>to take away from for doom but i mean he kind of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that anybody can get caught in but as far as</p>
<p>just timing and being able to connect</p>
<p>and counter i mean he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ridiculous i</p>
<p>would like to see him fight live</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a special athlete but he&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>small heavyweight</p>
<p>it was 2 30 or something</p>
<p>and he showed a big hole in his game with the</p>
<p>verdoon fight</p>
<p>he said he just got overconfident</p>
<p>which i could see</p>
<p>i mean why wouldn&rsquo;t he get overconfident</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t lost in 10</p>
<p>years everyone&rsquo;s fucking terrified of you</p>
<p>but he just you know he fucked up in verdun&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guard and verdun&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>nasty off of his back</p>
<p>i would like to see him</p>
<p>fight again though he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fight alstar over him</p>
<p>which is an even bigger test really i</p>
<p>think yeah what</p>
<p>about brock</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll never happen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>you know why it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen because</p>
<p>the m1 guys that control him</p>
<p>unless they all get hit by a meteor</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they just want too much</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t dana pay him</p>
<p>that much well</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all involved in some sort of a lawsuit</p>
<p>right now that i can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about but it&rsquo;s not that dana</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t pay him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing called co</p>
<p>promotion and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>these guys want they want to be able to co promote</p>
<p>ufc events and that&rsquo;s what they were offering</p>
<p>they wanted to give you phaidor</p>
<p>and they wanted all the</p>
<p>other russian guys that they handle</p>
<p>to fight in the</p>
<p>ufc as well so we</p>
<p>would take on a</p>
<p>bunch of guys that we didn&rsquo;t necessarily want</p>
<p>and then on top of it they</p>
<p>would co promote so it</p>
<p>would be ufc</p>
<p>with m1 or m1 global presents</p>
<p>ufc or whatever the fuck however they</p>
<p>would set it up</p>
<p>they would literally like</p>
<p>share 50 of the revenue</p>
<p>which is like the year</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about fifty but it&rsquo;d</p>
<p>still be cool like in a marvel</p>
<p>is a capcom</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>marvel vs capcom because</p>
<p>m1 global is its</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough to</p>
<p>bring to the</p>
<p>table all they have is one</p>
<p>fighter ufc does</p>
<p>not like even</p>
<p>dream if it was a co</p>
<p>promotion between</p>
<p>ufc and dream</p>
<p>well at least in dream</p>
<p>you got aoki you got</p>
<p>a lot of high</p>
<p>level guys over there it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>quite as high</p>
<p>level as the</p>
<p>ufc but a lot of really good guys</p>
<p>they all rest</p>
<p>over there dan</p>
<p>ouedt&rsquo;s genius has been he&rsquo;s kept the</p>
<p>ufc the superstar and no one fighter</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so good at that yeah they&rsquo;ve made a</p>
<p>bunch of guys</p>
<p>famous stars but there&rsquo;s so many of them</p>
<p>whereas with</p>
<p>boxing the unfortunate</p>
<p>thing about boxing is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really only interest on a few weight divisions</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s an interest whatever pacquiao&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting whatever</p>
<p>lloyd mayweather&rsquo;s fighting</p>
<p>whatever the clitschkos are fighting</p>
<p>and even the clitschkos not so much you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when was the last big time</p>
<p>pay per view</p>
<p>super fight with the clichskos i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>yeah exactly it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been anything i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it anyway because i</p>
<p>never thought they were</p>
<p>you know yeah well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good vladimir is a very good technical boxer but</p>
<p>the deal is that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really care enough there&rsquo;s not passion like when</p>
<p>tyson was fighting</p>
<p>or when lennox</p>
<p>lewis is fighting even or riddick</p>
<p>bow was fighting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s passion</p>
<p>a holyfield</p>
<p>title fight was a big deal as well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there was passion to those guys</p>
<p>personality yeah</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that vladimir is not a fucking awesome boxer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just for whatever reason people aren&rsquo;t passionate</p>
<p>about watching him</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s just not that mean</p>
<p>i mean people love hopkins i mean he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>throwback is an awesome</p>
<p>fighter but</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s 44 i</p>
<p>think and and took you see what he did to</p>
<p>kelly pablo</p>
<p>oh dude this</p>
<p>is unbelievable we</p>
<p>should get past hopkins who you got</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve got you</p>
<p>pacquiao you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>you know roy</p>
<p>jones jr when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still fighting at</p>
<p>least people are interesting</p>
<p>yeah i mean but roy john</p>
<p>once he lost the steps yeah</p>
<p>another guy who you know</p>
<p>once he lost that</p>
<p>speed that crazy</p>
<p>blinding speed</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that crazy to</p>
<p>watch dude the</p>
<p>thing about hopkins is that hopkins was always</p>
<p>very tight by the way</p>
<p>in the upper</p>
<p>pocket you know we&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna stop and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just stop right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s five minutes before we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop because</p>
<p>brian has to pay and we</p>
<p>stopped with</p>
<p>boxing talk</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the best</p>
<p>thing for a comedy podcast but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think this is a comedy podcast anymore it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>interesting shit</p>
<p>flashlight com</p>
<p>or go to joe&rsquo;s website and</p>
<p>click on the</p>
<p>flashlight link and you can get yourself 15</p>
<p>off it feels better than your hand</p>
<p>flashlight flashlight</p>
