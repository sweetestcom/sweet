<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>welcome back to another show today we</p>
<p>have a lot of questions from social</p>
<p>media we don&rsquo;t have any questions from</p>
<p>our green room today simply because the</p>
<p>link for some reason didn&rsquo;t work but no</p>
<p>problem because of that this way we</p>
<p>could focus more on all the all your</p>
<p>questions in social media and so you can</p>
<p>just start asking anything that I say is</p>
<p>not going to be meant to cure any</p>
<p>diseases or replace your medical care if</p>
<p>I do recommend eating a salad check with</p>
<p>your doctor first I don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>held responsible for any type of</p>
<p>consequences that occur from you eating</p>
<p>um excessive amounts of</p>
<p>Whole Foods salads Meats things like</p>
<p>that so I&rsquo;m just the messenger Steve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right so just stick to the</p>
<p>recommended by the food pyramid two cups</p>
<p>of sugar per day and see your doctor in</p>
<p>the morning</p>
<p>uh and by the way uh here&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>ways to get some non-recommended stuff</p>
<p>and that is Dr Burke&rsquo;s app and we know</p>
<p>that many of you today will be heading</p>
<p>to Grandma&rsquo;s uh for Christmas or other</p>
<p>holiday festivities and you can listen</p>
<p>by the way without watching dangerously</p>
<p>listen to Dr Berg on his app he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>some audio stuff and his soothing voice</p>
<p>will take you safely to your destination</p>
<p>so that and then when you&rsquo;re not driving</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re bored with your husband and</p>
<p>sitting in the right seat or vice versa</p>
<p>you can actually watch the video so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much great utility from this</p>
<p>uh you know you&rsquo;re going to find it just</p>
<p>a great asset uh to countering two cups</p>
<p>of sugar per day</p>
<p>Steve you know someone made it come and</p>
<p>they said</p>
<p>gosh your your voice is so soothing I</p>
<p>actually play it before I go to bed to</p>
<p>help me sleep so</p>
<p>um maybe driving and listening to my</p>
<p>voice</p>
<p>might not be a good thing but just test</p>
<p>it out if you get tired flip to the</p>
<p>radio crank up some music stay awake but</p>
<p>sometimes I listen to a lot of audio</p>
<p>audiobooks when I&rsquo;m driving</p>
<p>um and uh</p>
<p>you know if they have the certain voice</p>
<p>that they can kind of get into this</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you start dozing off it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>it really depends on that uh how the</p>
<p>book&rsquo;s laid out there&rsquo;s so many books</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve read that aren&rsquo;t that exciting</p>
<p>so I have to kind of</p>
<p>sift through a lot of the fluff to get</p>
<p>to the good stuff sometimes</p>
<p>yeah you know they actually have a</p>
<p>feature where you can put</p>
<p>1.25 or 1.5 speed it up and you know I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t figure that out I haven&rsquo;t figured</p>
<p>it out yet so I&rsquo;ll have to work on that</p>
<p>okay anyway that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s well but</p>
<p>listen folks again as uh as the good</p>
<p>doctor said we are going to just love</p>
<p>social media to death uh because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve got and so there&rsquo;ll be no</p>
<p>pesky participants in The Green Room no</p>
<p>we love them all but they&rsquo;re not on</p>
<p>today so you guys have got our full</p>
<p>attention and so why don&rsquo;t we uh start</p>
<p>off with the first question from social</p>
<p>media today and this sounds like a from</p>
<p>everyone a familiar one excuse me why do</p>
<p>I always fall off the keto wagon every</p>
<p>six weeks I usually lose about 10</p>
<p>kilograms every six weeks but I always</p>
<p>lapse after six weeks how can I maintain</p>
<p>the keto consistently</p>
<p>well I think um you know the question is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some people give give up or go off track</p>
<p>for various reasons maybe they get bored</p>
<p>maybe they stopped getting results maybe</p>
<p>you got your results were too good and</p>
<p>then you know you&rsquo;re like wow maybe I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to do this so I think in some</p>
<p>ways it&rsquo;s good to go off the keto once</p>
<p>in a while especially in the beginning</p>
<p>to prove to yourself that staying on it</p>
<p>is a good thing</p>
<p>um that way you can convince yourself</p>
<p>for me it took me many many years to</p>
<p>stay consistent because I always had a</p>
<p>reason or a justification to go off but</p>
<p>to make it more interesting you know you</p>
<p>you start watching more videos better</p>
<p>recipes that taste better higher quality</p>
<p>ingredients uh you know keto desserts</p>
<p>things like that that can make it just</p>
<p>more pleasurable if you need that</p>
<p>um but you know I&rsquo;ve eventually got to a</p>
<p>state I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else got to</p>
<p>the state yet maybe not very many people</p>
<p>but where I can kind of eat for health</p>
<p>and I can just get in this mode where I</p>
<p>can just do it consistently it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>automatic I do it especially because um</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m very very aware of foods</p>
<p>and what they do and I</p>
<p>I found out what works so I do it</p>
<p>consistently and I rarely go off the</p>
<p>program and I don&rsquo;t have a hard time</p>
<p>with that some people do</p>
<p>um so I think it&rsquo;s just learning about</p>
<p>your body also this DNA testing I think</p>
<p>will be a very huge thing for many</p>
<p>people as I&rsquo;m going to be educating</p>
<p>a lot of people on this and try to make</p>
<p>it simple but there&rsquo;s a lot there and to</p>
<p>to simplify you really have to</p>
<p>understand it so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m still chipping away but if you</p>
<p>really appreciate</p>
<p>um kind of like um</p>
<p>what makes up your genes and and your</p>
<p>weaknesses and the problems that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have</p>
<p>potentially if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be consistent that was that&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>motivation for a lot of people I mean</p>
<p>especially if you can</p>
<p>you know avoid a problem that is right</p>
<p>in your genetics and you&rsquo;re at high risk</p>
<p>like okay so I&rsquo;m gonna start now and</p>
<p>stick with it um I think that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a better</p>
<p>um motive motivator than other things</p>
<p>very good okay let&rsquo;s see uh let&rsquo;s kick</p>
<p>off with our first question uh and here</p>
<p>it is Dr Berg</p>
<p>all right what is the primary sign of a</p>
<p>carbohydrate deficiency</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s interesting I didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hear that question out of you uh but</p>
<p>anyway dig into that audience and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to uh our sole audience today</p>
<p>social media Cara from YouTube is it</p>
<p>okay to have uh broccoli Sprouts uh with</p>
<p>dairy I was told it&rsquo;s not a good</p>
<p>combination for you</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem with it unless you have a an</p>
<p>allergy to casein or lactose intolerant</p>
<p>but um no you can mix it</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t see a problem at all</p>
<p>wow I think broccoli and cheese is on</p>
<p>the periodic table I mean that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>about as normal as apple pie oops don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat that okay William from YouTube</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to treat a tongue</p>
<p>infection</p>
<p>well it sounds to me if it could be like</p>
<p>a yeast or a fungus or candida that</p>
<p>grows in the tongue but it could be some</p>
<p>other pathogen the microbiome in your</p>
<p>mouth</p>
<p>is very very important and when we use</p>
<p>too many chemicals like</p>
<p>doing fluoride treatments or over</p>
<p>sterilizing you know things like that</p>
<p>um or medications or drugs whatever or</p>
<p>lacking nutrients we start getting an</p>
<p>overgrowth of the wrong thing in our</p>
<p>mouths especially candida and fungus and</p>
<p>mold and other bacteria that shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be there so</p>
<p>um it tells us that there&rsquo;s uh you have</p>
<p>to re-establish that that microbe and um</p>
<p>I would start doing</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>probiotics starting with a raw</p>
<p>sauerkraut never consume pasteurized</p>
<p>sauerkraut because it kills the microbes</p>
<p>why would you ever take such a great</p>
<p>product that&rsquo;s so filled with microbes</p>
<p>and sterilize it by killing it with heat</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense so you want the raw</p>
<p>sauerkraut you want um the kimchi and</p>
<p>you want um maybe even some kefir</p>
<p>and down that and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>actually start to reestablish the Flora</p>
<p>now realize if you have Candida uh like</p>
<p>a white tongue whatever you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to completely avoid sugar because</p>
<p>the sugar is what they love to live on</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll keep growing unless you cut</p>
<p>that Sugar out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s I guess that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>answer I&rsquo;m sticking to it Steve well I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t blame you and I hope it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>continue to stick to William</p>
<p>you know drum roll there now get rid of</p>
<p>that that sounds awful okay prasanna I</p>
<p>hope I didn&rsquo;t butcher your name dear</p>
<p>from India on YouTube Simply wants to</p>
<p>let you know that she used to have</p>
<p>unhealthy eating habits Sleep disorders</p>
<p>and obesity after following Dr Berg</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you healthy keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for a short while I&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>lost 20 kilograms thank you she says and</p>
<p>by the way that is interesting in India</p>
<p>where uh there are a lot of vegetarians</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hopeful news</p>
<p>hey you know one thing I like about</p>
<p>India is they have very low carbs there</p>
<p>um they have very little sugar</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s really good yeah no such thing</p>
<p>as naan</p>
<p>no no not at all</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah and I&rsquo;ve heard that the some of the</p>
<p>Indian restaurants that I go to in</p>
<p>America are not quite like the foods in</p>
<p>India I think sitting with Chinese</p>
<p>restaurants you know you go to the</p>
<p>actual country like</p>
<p>Steve I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been to an Italian</p>
<p>Pizzeria or a restaurant in the states</p>
<p>right indeed</p>
<p>um well I&rsquo;m just gonna let you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely opposite or different than if</p>
<p>you actually go to the Italy and</p>
<p>actually go to one of those restaurants</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely different it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the American version of some of these</p>
<p>other foods are just ridiculous don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell me they don&rsquo;t have Pizza Hut in</p>
<p>Italy I&rsquo;m gonna die</p>
<p>oh that would be that would be really</p>
<p>really bad sacrilege huh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible okay back to social media</p>
<p>nadzia uh from YouTube please discuss</p>
<p>ways to open block fallopian tubes</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>well of course you know go go first to</p>
<p>try to um get your basic eating plan in</p>
<p>to see what happens but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>specifically for that if you have a</p>
<p>problem in the Fallopian tubes which is</p>
<p>the connection between the uterus and</p>
<p>the ovary</p>
<p>um I would consume</p>
<p>a supplement to help maybe help support</p>
<p>that called</p>
<p>over trophin PMG and eutrophin PMG these</p>
<p>are standard process products I used to</p>
<p>use them in my practice but you could</p>
<p>actually support fertility and certain</p>
<p>glands by those two products which um is</p>
<p>pretty good but again</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would I wouldn&rsquo;t I would try the</p>
<p>basics first and try to just get your</p>
<p>diet healthy because who knows your body</p>
<p>might come back and open up those</p>
<p>Fallopian tubes which</p>
<p>um I have no idea what&rsquo;s causing them I</p>
<p>like to take uh a higher look at it</p>
<p>instead of trying to</p>
<p>treat a specific symptom like what could</p>
<p>be really behind that well I know that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of problems like</p>
<p>endometriosis for example that can</p>
<p>put scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes</p>
<p>external and internal so I would just go</p>
<p>with the basics first and then um</p>
<p>and see what you can do with that before</p>
<p>you start to</p>
<p>you know try something invasive very</p>
<p>good will we certainly hope that you</p>
<p>clear that up and have some great babies</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see the audience is on it as</p>
<p>usual uh they took the first quiz</p>
<p>questions very seriously and have</p>
<p>demonstrated that by answering it and it</p>
<p>asks what is the primary sign of a</p>
<p>carbohydrate deficiency</p>
<p>and 65 percent of them said primary</p>
<p>effect is ketosis and weight loss 15 say</p>
<p>hair loss 15 say weakness or fatigue and</p>
<p>five percent say reduced brain function</p>
<p>this is interesting because um</p>
<p>if you type this up and some of you have</p>
<p>typed in Google the first I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how many pages are just filled with all</p>
<p>the the bad things the side effects and</p>
<p>I mean my whole thought is um</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>tell a lie</p>
<p>um multiple times by multiple different</p>
<p>sources does that tend to make it true</p>
<p>if you put a lie on a credible website</p>
<p>does that make it more true</p>
<p>um not if it&rsquo;s a lie and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>lying through the teeth through this</p>
<p>concept of that there&rsquo;s negative things</p>
<p>by reducing your carbs and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re pushing it&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>um and you go through like oh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start craving junk food you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start having</p>
<p>um cognitive problems you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start being hungry all the time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have constipation you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have you&rsquo;re gonna your body&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>go into a state of ketosis and we all</p>
<p>know that ketosis occurs when you in</p>
<p>during starvation and when you lose all</p>
<p>this water weight temporarily you lose</p>
<p>your electrolytes and develop</p>
<p>arrhythmias and that can lead to Strokes</p>
<p>so you could put so many doubts in</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s Mind by reading this crap and</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t know otherwise I&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>be discouraged from doing Keto</p>
<p>um the the true uh signs or symptoms of</p>
<p>low carb if you do it correctly you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lowering your car below 50 to 30</p>
<p>grams</p>
<p>um is this you lose your Cravings you</p>
<p>lose your hunger</p>
<p>you have better cognitive function you</p>
<p>have better mood</p>
<p>you lose your belly fat and you finally</p>
<p>for the first time in your life you</p>
<p>might be burning actual fat because to</p>
<p>do that you have to reduce your carbs</p>
<p>which is a New Concept for a lot of</p>
<p>people so there are so many wonderful</p>
<p>things and the opposite of what they</p>
<p>tell you</p>
<p>um I mean it&rsquo;s just if you take a look</p>
<p>at what they&rsquo;ll recommend usually by a</p>
<p>dietitian is that we need carbs because</p>
<p>our brain and our muscles require</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>um no that&rsquo;s not true any carbs that we</p>
<p>need we our bodies can make them in fact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as an essential</p>
<p>carbohydrate our bodies if we need it we</p>
<p>can get it from other things</p>
<p>the other thing is that</p>
<p>we need fat Fat&rsquo;s essential essential</p>
<p>fatty acids we also need essential amino</p>
<p>acids as protein so that&rsquo;s those two</p>
<p>foods are essential but not the carbs</p>
<p>and um so there&rsquo;s a lot of bad things</p>
<p>happen and the recommended amount of</p>
<p>carbs that they tell you to eat is</p>
<p>between</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>200 and I think it&rsquo;s uh 288 to 325 grams</p>
<p>of carbs per day if you have a 2 000</p>
<p>calorie diet I mean like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 10 times the amount of carbs that</p>
<p>you need</p>
<p>um that is guaranteed to make you</p>
<p>fat tired brain fog give you dementia</p>
<p>so anyway there&rsquo;s an interesting you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>push to get everyone to keep eating</p>
<p>carbs and I think you guys know why but</p>
<p>I will be doing a video on that today</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna talk about that but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>carb deficiency and they have carb</p>
<p>deficiency diseases</p>
<p>they talk about you can get uh ketosis</p>
<p>like ketoacidosis well first of all</p>
<p>that only occurs if you&rsquo;re a type 1</p>
<p>diabetic and you forget to take your</p>
<p>insulin they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>those little details so again you have</p>
<p>to be really</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>suspect and when you kind of go on doing</p>
<p>your searches on Google because we all</p>
<p>know that um</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s just filled with credible facts</p>
<p>incredible hey let&rsquo;s go to the The Green</p>
<p>Room after all Steve welcome to the show</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right anyway I just wanted to</p>
<p>Echo again my you can see I&rsquo;m beautiful</p>
<p>now my weight&rsquo;s down no really I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>45 pounds down since I met Dr Berg</p>
<p>however my motivation is not weight it</p>
<p>still is carbs drive me mad if I eat</p>
<p>tons of sugar and stuff it is the</p>
<p>emotional component that drives me back</p>
<p>to discipline not gaining five pounds</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so that is an absolute absurd</p>
<p>notion to suggest that you better eat</p>
<p>some more Cocoa Puffs or you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have brain fog that is the dumbest thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard in the last five minutes</p>
<p>so there you have it anyway Let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go on to the next question and</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which cell in your body</p>
<p>is responsible for the majority of</p>
<p>detoxification</p>
<p>turning poisons into harmless particles</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one specific cell that does the</p>
<p>Lion&rsquo;s Share of that work what is the</p>
<p>name of that cell</p>
<p>all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a look around the world this</p>
<p>is a big holiday a week for us here in</p>
<p>the states in some Western countries but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of celebration going</p>
<p>on around Dr Berg&rsquo;s show and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re coming from we&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>say hello to our viewers from the UK</p>

<p>across these United States be careful</p>
<p>with the traveling boy we have got some</p>
<p>blizzardy stuff going on so maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better just to stay home and watch Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s app and don&rsquo;t eat carbs so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh thank you for that let&rsquo;s go right</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>um social media which is the only place</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to go back to uh Shakila from</p>
<p>Facebook can blood cleansing help treat</p>
<p>chronic disease</p>
<p>well like I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about alternative treatments like ozone</p>
<p>therapy</p>
<p>um things like that which I actually I</p>
<p>really like that therapy</p>
<p>um I was I think I yeah I did I did have</p>
<p>it done once and uh but you know even</p>
<p>though I like it because it kind of</p>
<p>purifies the blood you know I always</p>
<p>like to it&rsquo;s kind of like a you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>treating the tip of the iceberg like how</p>
<p>do you long term fix the problem how do</p>
<p>you cleanse the blood where&rsquo;s the blood</p>
<p>come from uh the kidneys are supposed to</p>
<p>filter the blood but to make your blood</p>
<p>very uh healthy it&rsquo;s really uh it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>got to start changing your diet you get</p>
<p>it starts changing your environment</p>
<p>reduce the toxicity that you&rsquo;re exposed</p>
<p>to Steve did you realize that um</p>
<p>every single year</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just talking about in the U.S</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a production either by the U.S</p>
<p>or imported</p>
<p>27 trillion pounds of chemicals 27</p>
<p>trillion pounds of chemicals</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of chemicals and it comes</p>
<p>down to being exposed to literally 250</p>
<p>pounds of chemicals per day so so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bathing in the chemicals so guess what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen to our blood</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be situations so um of</p>
<p>course I&rsquo;m gonna stay tuned for a video</p>
<p>on that topic because</p>
<p>um there are certain things that you can</p>
<p>do very very inexpensively to keep uh</p>
<p>your your blood and your your cells</p>
<p>clean and to counter uh these chemicals</p>
<p>that are building up unfortunately</p>
<p>wow I understand that we uh we as</p>
<p>Western folks eat at least a credit</p>
<p>card&rsquo;s worth of plastic every week so</p>
<p>yeah and yeah that&rsquo;s definitely that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at least one thing yep</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know about the rest</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably really gross okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now let&rsquo;s go to Denise from</p>
<p>YouTube please discuss ways to address</p>
<p>gastroparesis did I say that right doc</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>so gastroparesis is a condition where</p>
<p>your digestive system is very very slow</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not digesting and</p>
<p>things are just not functioning they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sluggish</p>
<p>um that is really a problem with the</p>
<p>vagus nerve that controls the digestive</p>
<p>system but if we take a look at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind that</p>
<p>the number one cause</p>
<p>of the vagus nerve problem</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>a lack of B1 thymine thymine helps you</p>
<p>make acetylcholine which is the main</p>
<p>neurotransmitter for the vagus nerve so</p>
<p>that B1 you know if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough B1 which is very common uh you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get symptoms like gastroparesis</p>
<p>constipation a lack of hydrochloric acid</p>
<p>I mean the majority of your hydrochloric</p>
<p>acid is is triggered by this B1 I mean</p>
<p>so this is kind of another little link</p>
<p>that is really important and if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know about it and you&rsquo;re deficient</p>
<p>in B1 it leads to a massive bad</p>
<p>consequences through the entire</p>
<p>digestive tract especially if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>producing hydrochloric acid or you have</p>
<p>incomplete digestion now the question is</p>
<p>how do you become deficient well</p>
<p>refined carbs refined sugars drinking</p>
<p>too much coffee tea and there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>other reasons but uh</p>
<p>B1 is a probably the most important</p>
<p>water-soluble vitamin because it just</p>
<p>influences so many things but definitely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need just start taking</p>
<p>some B1 find a natural version and watch</p>
<p>what happens to your gastroparesis you</p>
<p>just may find that it might magically</p>
<p>disappear but of course don&rsquo;t mention my</p>
<p>name when you go to your doctor</p>
<p>not a word okay I always love this once</p>
<p>we give her a shout out there&rsquo;s others</p>
<p>that say hey what about us and those</p>
<p>people want to make sure that we are</p>
<p>acknowledging Cameroon Romania uh</p>
<p>Tanzania Iran Sweden Dubai turkey and</p>
<p>Ethiopia well you&rsquo;re certainly welcome</p>
<p>uh and we&rsquo;re glad to have you on board</p>
<p>uh not eating Cocoa Puffs I hope uh if</p>
<p>they have them in those various places</p>
<p>Rina however from Facebook can alcohol</p>
<p>induce gastrointestinal damage be</p>
<p>corrected with keto and if</p>
<p>I I think just to a large degree it can</p>
<p>um but I think you&rsquo;re going to need some</p>
<p>additional things to to help um correct</p>
<p>it and</p>
<p>um well you know if you do the healthy</p>
<p>version of Keto and you include more</p>
<p>probiotics</p>
<p>um and get a nice Diversified Group of</p>
<p>microbes living in your intestine</p>
<p>intestines that can actually help</p>
<p>fortify and help build up the mucous</p>
<p>layer that&rsquo;s needed in the GI tract that</p>
<p>mucous layer is really what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>with so many people and their health</p>
<p>problems and that mucous layer is</p>
<p>generated by eating healthy and having</p>
<p>enough microbes and making sure they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing their job when you lose the mucous</p>
<p>layer you lose your immune system</p>
<p>because then you have</p>
<p>um less of a buffer for these pathogens</p>
<p>to invade and then you start getting</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases and inflammatory</p>
<p>diseases so um that mucous layer is</p>
<p>going to be really</p>
<p>key to maintain your health and uh and</p>
<p>you can have a good start by doing the</p>
<p>healthy keto very good okay the audience</p>
<p>is rolling the dice with a hundred</p>
<p>percent uh agreement of the question</p>
<p>which said which cell in your body is</p>
<p>responsible for the majority of</p>
<p>detoxification and 100 of our audience</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s the micro Mite excuse me</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>oh they&rsquo;re not quite a hundred percent</p>
<p>there uh I it&rsquo;s called the hepatocyte</p>
<p>hepatocyte</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s the liver cell</p>
<p>and that liver cell</p>
<p>is very interesting it uh very robust it</p>
<p>takes a beating and it keeps on ticking</p>
<p>and it can get hammered and it can</p>
<p>regenerate uh better than many other</p>
<p>cells I mean here here you you have a</p>
<p>night out in the town you drink all this</p>
<p>alcohol kill off your liver and then the</p>
<p>next couple days grows back if if you do</p>
<p>all the right things</p>
<p>but the point is it&rsquo;s a rebro re uh a</p>
<p>robust uh cell that</p>
<p>basically has these enzymes that can</p>
<p>turn poisons into like fat soluble</p>
<p>poisons into harmless water-soluble</p>
<p>poisons</p>
<p>for the elimination so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s various things that you can do</p>
<p>to trigger it and um but we have our</p>
<p>this system inner cells right now that</p>
<p>has the ability to keep you protected</p>
<p>you just need to know what to eat to</p>
<p>trigger them and keep them working and</p>
<p>keep the poisons at a minimum but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll show you I guess um this is the</p>
<p>book that you need to read it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy reading you can do it in a</p>
<p>weekend but this is the book on</p>
<p>toxicology okay so you can read that and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>um learn about all the chemicals in the</p>
<p>environment and what they do but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of data on the liver cell and the</p>
<p>importance of</p>
<p>supporting your liver and getting it</p>
<p>healthy and I have a lot of videos in</p>
<p>the liver so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>stay tuned for more on that wow well</p>
<p>guess what I&rsquo;ve got some exciting news</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t 100 it was 99 uh Terry just</p>
<p>found out that uh Shivani on YouTube she</p>
<p>was the only one who had the correct</p>
<p>answer so good for you a Shivani you</p>
<p>should be jumping up and down uh because</p>
<p>you are one out of the crowd that stuck</p>
<p>with the correct answer besides Dr Berg</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s uh continue to sort</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>uh oh poor Carolyn from Facebook is</p>
<p>having problems with constipation and</p>
<p>irregularity I take your gallbladder</p>
<p>supplements and liver cleanse</p>
<p>um and</p>
<p>um you know she&rsquo;s constipated and had to</p>
<p>cut back on dairy uh can I be eating too</p>
<p>many cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>yeah yeah you can so so um the first</p>
<p>thing I would try if I had constipation</p>
<p>especially if it</p>
<p>you developed it when you&rsquo;re on keto is</p>
<p>either to</p>
<p>first decrease or even increase the</p>
<p>amount of vegetables that you consume</p>
<p>because if you have too much fiber or</p>
<p>not enough fiber it can create that</p>
<p>symptom so you might need to make some</p>
<p>adjustments you you know</p>
<p>what was interesting to me is that when</p>
<p>I uh because I experiment on a lot of</p>
<p>things years years ago when I even</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>um started the Atkins diet you know I</p>
<p>notice</p>
<p>when I just started eating more protein</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have any vegetables at that</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>um boy</p>
<p>my digestive system worked like a charm</p>
<p>no more constipation because I in my</p>
<p>mind I thought it&rsquo;s always the fiber</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fiber of the fiber well for</p>
<p>some people it is some people it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sometimes you just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>microbe diversity to digest the fiber so</p>
<p>this is really a very important topic if</p>
<p>we take a look at</p>
<p>50 years ago and now you know I think</p>
<p>the the biggest missing Factor</p>
<p>in our health is the missing diversity</p>
<p>of the microbiome and what it can do for</p>
<p>digestion and that of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reason why I mean like everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing right now we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sterilizing we&rsquo;re killing off things the</p>
<p>antibiotics the the foods the</p>
<p>pasteurization the steroid the canned</p>
<p>foods the cooked Foods so if you were</p>
<p>just to build up this microbiome</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and this means like slowly adding</p>
<p>a variety of different plants as well at</p>
<p>first you might follow my</p>
<p>recommendations and start adding more</p>
<p>salad and go my gosh I&rsquo;m bloated I have</p>
<p>gas we&rsquo;ll cut it back all that means is</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t have the the right</p>
<p>microbes if you start to</p>
<p>diversify and and have just a little bit</p>
<p>over a period of time all of a sudden</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start growing</p>
<p>the microbes to help you digest that</p>
<p>food as well as make the enzymes and so</p>
<p>um and this would eliminate a lot of</p>
<p>additional problems you may find you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>no longer</p>
<p>um settled to kidney stones because you</p>
<p>have the microbes to break down oxalates</p>
<p>or you have the microbes to help you</p>
<p>dismantle uric acid so you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>gout anymore</p>
<p>um I want to just share something</p>
<p>I just got the results</p>
<p>um final results from the beef study so</p>
<p>I sent in my beef it&rsquo;s called the beef</p>
<p>nutrient density study I sent my beef</p>
<p>for my farm right and</p>
<p>this is fascinating because if you look</p>
<p>at this page right here</p>
<p>can you see that okay Steve yeah I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite read the things but I see the</p>
<p>green color green bar right here yes sir</p>
<p>this is Dr Berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um cattle beef I sent in see how much</p>
<p>higher it is in the grass-fed group and</p>
<p>the grain fed group wow</p>
<p>this is for phytonutrients that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plant-based chemicals</p>
<p>who would ever know that there are</p>
<p>plant-based chemicals a lot of them in</p>
<p>beef apparently a lot more in my beef</p>
<p>they wanted to know what am I doing so</p>
<p>different than some of these other farms</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s interesting about my farm</p>
<p>is that I don&rsquo;t do the typical thing</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m growing like four different</p>
<p>grasses for the kettle</p>
<p>I let them</p>
<p>consume all the weeds there&rsquo;s a much</p>
<p>wider variety of weeds or plants and</p>
<p>herbs than actual grasses and apparently</p>
<p>that helps the diversity of microbes</p>
<p>that then build these phytonutrients so</p>
<p>the same studies are done um</p>
<p>on humans if you increase the diversity</p>
<p>of different plants and some certain</p>
<p>foods all of a sudden your microbes will</p>
<p>adapt so you might want to do it</p>
<p>gradually but you can then build up more</p>
<p>immune system more Health but it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>area that&rsquo;s very interesting and I</p>
<p>happen to just get lucky and do</p>
<p>something that showed a lot of benefits</p>
<p>for these biomarkers for your health</p>
<p>um I mean I have 500 pounds of that beef</p>
<p>in my freezers right now and I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>motivated to start eating that on a</p>
<p>regular basis now now that I know</p>
<p>how healthy it is it&rsquo;s incredibly</p>
<p>healthy so</p>
<p>um much better than the average wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible you&rsquo;ll be the next</p>
<p>Methuselah we&rsquo;ll see in a couple</p>
<p>centuries uh let&rsquo;s see Rodrigo and this</p>
<p>is an interesting question because</p>
<p>everyone has jumped on the keto wagon</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s keto candy and keto this that and</p>
<p>the other but is it really so Rodrigo</p>
<p>from Facebook&rsquo;s asking will any of these</p>
<p>ingredients raise my insulin vegetable</p>
<p>glycerin organic stevia extract</p>
<p>um natural French vanilla ethyl alcohol</p>
<p>12 ethyl alcohol</p>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>you know you got to be really careful</p>
<p>with some of these ingredients and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t really know because I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to see the label and like even some</p>
<p>of the um a lot of the flavorings</p>
<p>and the powders in the different powders</p>
<p>that people get keto or not and the</p>
<p>supplements and the flavorings</p>
<p>I recently learned of this by talking to</p>
<p>several manufacturing companies that</p>
<p>make vitamins that work with thousands</p>
<p>tens of thousands of companies</p>
<p>supplement companies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Apparently I was the only only</p>
<p>company or a person to approach them and</p>
<p>say listen I don&rsquo;t none of my products</p>
<p>can have maltodextrin or uh or corn</p>
<p>syrup and they&rsquo;re like kind of shocked</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like really this has never been</p>
<p>asked I says how many companies</p>
<p>um use this these ingredients they go</p>
<p>they they all do I said what</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>um these other ingredients in there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a little bit cheaper</p>
<p>unfortunately and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>demanding to have these maltodextrin</p>
<p>free or glucose free products so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just another interesting factoid that I</p>
<p>recently realized in uh unfortunately</p>
<p>um here you&rsquo;re getting supplements with</p>
<p>hidden sugars</p>
<p>so with these keto snacks and things</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re introducing these new</p>
<p>fibers the corn soluble fiber it&rsquo;s keto</p>
<p>friendly and the tapioca fiber I I</p>
<p>honestly I just would stay away from it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no long-term State safety</p>
<p>studies who knows what it&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>to your microbiome there&rsquo;s even a study</p>
<p>I read that it creates toxicity in mice</p>
<p>okay they haven&rsquo;t done the human studies</p>
<p>yet but</p>
<p>you know what I always like to let</p>
<p>let everyone else experiment on it for</p>
<p>for several decades and then I&rsquo;ll see if</p>
<p>it works I don&rsquo;t like to be the first</p>
<p>one experimenting to like someone I know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>has cancer and then what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re going to do enroll in</p>
<p>a cancer study personally</p>
<p>um I would prefer if someone else did</p>
<p>the study first and then tell me if it</p>
<p>worked or not then then the be one of</p>
<p>the guinea pigs so anyway</p>
<p>interesting okay and here&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting question it certainly</p>
<p>interests me and maybe others lovely</p>
<p>fish from YouTube please share your</p>
<p>opinion on the nutritional value of CBD</p>
<p>oil it seems more and more people are</p>
<p>taking it as an alternative to vitamin</p>
<p>supplements I mean I&rsquo;ve heard so many</p>
<p>people talk about it as a cure for</p>
<p>virtually everything is starting to</p>
<p>sound like snake oil a little bit but</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>well this is another one of the</p>
<p>supplements that are really everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting on the bandwagon and it&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um some of it has traces of THC and</p>
<p>maybe some of it doesn&rsquo;t you have to get</p>
<p>certified I honestly I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the research is not quite there long</p>
<p>term I know a lot of people are gonna</p>
<p>probably get pissed at me because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not some supporting it for some reason</p>
<p>but I I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I I I&rsquo;m not on the bang when I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to drink that Kool-Aid right now</p>
<p>so I just don&rsquo;t do it I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um I just don&rsquo;t I definitely don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>uh traces of THC in my uh you know even</p>
<p>with my DNA testing they actually</p>
<p>evaluate different Pathways</p>
<p>um to see what happens when</p>
<p>if you did were exposed to THC right</p>
<p>um and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like increased risk of psychosis</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like uh no thank you no thank you</p>
<p>so um anyway that&rsquo;s just my viewpoint</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not um there&rsquo;s many other things</p>
<p>that uh can help inflammation I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>interested in uh</p>
<p>getting rid of inflammation but doing in</p>
<p>a way that um it gets deeper to the root</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>so yeah</p>
<p>yeah well I think that&rsquo;s wise I I hope</p>
<p>and I pray and I think it really does</p>
<p>probably have some beneficial</p>
<p>um you know attributes but the fact that</p>
<p>people say it does virtually everything</p>
<p>uh you know starts to sound suspect it</p>
<p>will literally cure any and everything</p>
<p>and that uh in its face uh gives me</p>
<p>pause but of the people that are using</p>
<p>it and find it uh helpful continue to do</p>
<p>so uh Judy from Facebook how to best</p>
<p>treat stomach ulcers</p>
<p>some of these stomach ulcers come from H</p>
<p>pylori okay that&rsquo;s a microorganism and</p>
<p>in order for an ulcer to occur your</p>
<p>environment of the stomach has to change</p>
<p>first and I personally had an ulcer and</p>
<p>uh I know it&rsquo;s directly related to just</p>
<p>your Foods you&rsquo;re eating junk foods and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>um eating the right things so as far as</p>
<p>a remedy goes</p>
<p>um some people use zinc carnosine other</p>
<p>people use um</p>
<p>sulforaphane which is another good</p>
<p>remedy which is from broccoli Sprouts</p>
<p>you can also get sulforaphane from</p>
<p>cabbage</p>
<p>so it can actually kill off this H</p>
<p>pylori so you can get rid of the ulcer</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the remedies and then</p>
<p>of course change your diet in the</p>
<p>meantime</p>
<p>okay very good uh let&rsquo;s see one woman</p>
<p>this is interesting I&rsquo;m not sure if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any health benefits for this but</p>
<p>caring from YouTube I used to have half</p>
<p>Moons on my fingernails when I was a</p>
<p>little girl but now as an adult I no</p>
<p>longer have them and she wants them back</p>
<p>and I bet everyone in the audience is</p>
<p>looking at their fingernails because I</p>
<p>did but uh but is there is she in any</p>
<p>kind of trouble with not having half</p>
<p>Moons as an adult</p>
<p>Steve it&rsquo;s a brilliant it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>popular thing now to have those half</p>
<p>Moons</p>
<p>um this relates to an iron deficiency</p>
<p>um so what what you want to do is make</p>
<p>sure you have enough iron now how do you</p>
<p>do that do you take an iron supplement</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t do that you want to get it</p>
<p>from food and there&rsquo;s a huge difference</p>
<p>between the iron in plants versus the</p>
<p>iron in animal mates so</p>
<p>um which I have videos on but I would</p>
<p>recommend getting it from you know liver</p>
<p>or red meat things like that high</p>
<p>quality grass-fed grass finish and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the iron that you need but</p>
<p>your iron could also come from</p>
<p>another thing</p>
<p>um it could come from B12 deficiency too</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of genetic things that</p>
<p>relate to that too which I&rsquo;m not getting</p>
<p>into but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>watch my videos on all the different</p>
<p>causes of anemia and um because I think</p>
<p>that lack of that Luna Half Moon on your</p>
<p>fingernails is just the tip of the</p>
<p>iceberg I think it it goes much deeper</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see here uh</p>
<p>uh Harem or whatever your name is Sir a</p>
<p>man from YouTube How can I fix anal</p>
<p>stenosis caused by a laser hemorrhoid</p>
<p>procedure I&rsquo;m sorry for asking that Dr</p>
<p>fergon not sure that&rsquo;s such an obscure</p>
<p>question but unfortunately got zapped by</p>
<p>laser uh and uh it&rsquo;s got stenosis which</p>
<p>I guess is right the narrowing of that a</p>
<p>dilator has helped but I&rsquo;m only 22 do I</p>
<p>need a dilator for the rest of my life I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you have any comment on</p>
<p>that Dr bird but it sounds awful</p>
<p>I think you know the best thing to do is</p>
<p>to do that maybe you know topical</p>
<p>Vitamin E oil which helps reduce</p>
<p>scarring but uh anything hemorrhoid</p>
<p>related always think colonsonia root</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best remedy and that supports</p>
<p>the liver because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hemorrhoids are a problem with your</p>
<p>venous structure so it&rsquo;s a circulatory</p>
<p>issue and the um the colon Sony root</p>
<p>tends to be a really good remedy to kind</p>
<p>of fix that problem but ultimately it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a problem with the liver so it seems</p>
<p>like we all come back we finally always</p>
<p>come back to this liver as being</p>
<p>the source of so many issues wow Marsha</p>
<p>from YouTube says I&rsquo;ll take 10 pounds of</p>
<p>your beef please little roadside</p>
<p>standing you will make a fortune</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because I even I told</p>
<p>some of my friends I&rsquo;m like do you want</p>
<p>some beef in there they&rsquo;re all like no</p>
<p>no we&rsquo;re fine all of a sudden I show</p>
<p>them the report they&rsquo;re like oh where</p>
<p>can I get some beef I&rsquo;m like uh actually</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I can&rsquo;t sell it but um</p>
<p>um I I&rsquo;m just going to teach people what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing and I&rsquo;ll do videos on it so</p>
<p>you can grow your own beef in your</p>
<p>backyard and um do the same thing but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I want to do a full</p>
<p>um video on it because it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>quite fascinating some of the other</p>
<p>value I mean like there&rsquo;s this thing</p>
<p>called um Advanced glycation end</p>
<p>products now this is an a biomarker or</p>
<p>an indicator of</p>
<p>something bad in your body you know</p>
<p>chronic disease it&rsquo;s a bad indicator</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an indicator that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>poor health well</p>
<p>apparently my beef had this this the</p>
<p>lowest amounts in my question I had no</p>
<p>idea that was in beef I had no idea</p>
<p>homocysteine was in the beef so this is</p>
<p>like a B vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s um you know all the</p>
<p>bad things that we find in our body the</p>
<p>indicators they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re in animals</p>
<p>and so it would be good to know</p>
<p>if what we&rsquo;re eating are we eating</p>
<p>sick animals and plants or are we eating</p>
<p>healthy animals and plants and does that</p>
<p>relate to our health I think it might</p>
<p>Steve I think there&rsquo;s an old what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>old saying you are what you eat</p>
<p>something like that makes sense</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s exciting uh Dr Berg</p>
<p>were all anxious to see the continued</p>
<p>reports that come down from that and it</p>
<p>will just be wringing our hands with</p>
<p>jealousy that we don&rsquo;t have a slab of</p>
<p>that but maybe some people are listening</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get some better organic Meats Etc</p>
<p>in the future okay let&rsquo;s go to our next</p>
<p>Quiz question for the day and there it</p>
<p>is Dr bird</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what is the best specific specific blood</p>
<p>test</p>
<p>to test for cancer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing to know all right</p>
<p>hop on it audience</p>
<p>all right Jana tune from Facebook our</p>
<p>dairy-based probiotic safe</p>
<p>I I I like them I like them unless you</p>
<p>have a analogy to them</p>
<p>um and I don&rsquo;t know of course what</p>
<p>companies are</p>
<p>you know using good methods and things</p>
<p>like that but generally I think I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>um because they they like to eat the</p>
<p>milk sugar and you can grow these</p>
<p>microbes on Dairy</p>
<p>um hopefully it&rsquo;s a healthy version of</p>
<p>dairy</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t forget you can get a lot of</p>
<p>probiotics</p>
<p>from not only fermented foods but Raw</p>
<p>plants that come from good soils</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p>microbiome inside that plant that helps</p>
<p>to populate our guts and so this is</p>
<p>something brand new you wouldn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s actual probiotics in Plants</p>
<p>but there is but I&rsquo;m not telling you to</p>
<p>start eating</p>
<p>just a large amount but if you had that</p>
<p>like I said before the variety from like</p>
<p>the farmer&rsquo;s market I think that would</p>
<p>be really good for your gut not just</p>
<p>from the eating feeding the fiber to</p>
<p>your microbes but just giving you</p>
<p>microbes I mean that&rsquo;s what do you think</p>
<p>the cows and these other animals the</p>
<p>goats and the Sheep where do you think</p>
<p>they get their rumen or their microbiome</p>
<p>it comes right from this the plants and</p>
<p>that comes from the soil so it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>just being</p>
<p>recycled</p>
<p>um I mean if you evaluate the microbes</p>
<p>in a plant that a cow eats</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re microbiome bacteria</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bacteria that are in our gut or</p>
<p>in the guts of animals so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice recycling system</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>it kind of just got my interest in</p>
<p>creating a video on what would happen if</p>
<p>you had were completely sterile and you</p>
<p>had no microbes in your body what would</p>
<p>happen to your health how long would you</p>
<p>live</p>
<p>what would happen if you were on a</p>
<p>permanent antibiotic boy that would be</p>
<p>something else wow interesting Mike from</p>
<p>Facebook I love that you have your own</p>
<p>Farm that&rsquo;s a goal of mine and let me</p>
<p>tell you something Mike I&rsquo;ve had the</p>
<p>great honor of being there and you come</p>
<p>over this rise and look down upon the</p>
<p>most beautiful scene you&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>out in the country with these mountains</p>
<p>in the background and I mean it just</p>
<p>looks absolutely Hollywood it&rsquo;s gorgeous</p>
<p>so if you have that goal keep up with it</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um you know Dr Berg only yells at me</p>
<p>like five times a week it used to be</p>
<p>like 15 when he lived in Suburbia so it</p>
<p>is really had now he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>absolutely as mellow as you see him on</p>
<p>there but uh but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good for him</p>
<p>and he has great beef and all this stuff</p>
<p>but no it&rsquo;s a spectacular Farm uh again</p>
<p>I have no uh there&rsquo;s no question why he</p>
<p>moved there it&rsquo;s just beautiful uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see other people wanting more of your</p>
<p>beef Suddenly It&rsquo;s a big thing</p>
<p>um Let&rsquo;s see we went through the half</p>
<p>Moons uh uh oh here we go Beverly from</p>
<p>Facebook can keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting help with recovery from thyroid</p>
<p>removal</p>
<p>I would if I had my thyroid removed I</p>
<p>would uh get on keto for sure</p>
<p>um one point about that if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a thyroid I know there&rsquo;s this um</p>
<p>a push to just take synthroid But</p>
<p>realize that um you need more than just</p>
<p>the T4 you need the whole package I</p>
<p>would probably recommend finding a</p>
<p>doctor that can work with you</p>
<p>put you on the Armor Thyroid or other</p>
<p>types of thyroid that involve all the</p>
<p>all the hormones T3 as well as</p>
<p>calcitonin because um you know T4</p>
<p>in Synthroid</p>
<p>is the inactive hormone it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>inactive hormone so it has to be</p>
<p>converted so you know</p>
<p>if you can if you can do that it might</p>
<p>be a little bit better and then um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to do a video more on that but</p>
<p>yes I would do keto for sure</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um boy Kerry&rsquo;s uh power went out he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running on emergency power and still</p>
<p>working the internet so that&rsquo;s great it</p>
<p>was snowing up there I guess let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>we uh did that and let me look again uh</p>
<p>do we have any answers to questions I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure that is coming up</p>
<p>um oh here we go Jihad from Facebook</p>
<p>what are the best natural sources of</p>
<p>vitamin B1</p>
<p>um um sunflower seeds</p>
<p>okay uh that&rsquo;s a good source B1 actually</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>animal and some plant but our but our</p>
<p>guts our guts make B1 too</p>
<p>um I think if you&rsquo;re eating healthy you</p>
<p>really just need to worry about</p>
<p>um the foods that deplete B1 more than</p>
<p>the foods that have B1 and that would be</p>
<p>the high carb diet the rice</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>um like the white rice and also um</p>
<p>other things that uh deplete like tea if</p>
<p>you drink a lot of tea or coffee that</p>
<p>can deplete to be one</p>
<p>um if you drink a lot of alcohol okay</p>
<p>that can deplete B1 this is why like</p>
<p>nearly all alcoholics are very deficient</p>
<p>in B1 and then you get</p>
<p>a lot of the major diseases from that</p>
<p>um but doctors don&rsquo;t really look for the</p>
<p>B1 deficiency unless someone is an</p>
<p>advanced alcoholic and they have end</p>
<p>sage and Stage liver disease so</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>wine three times a week you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just depleting your B right down</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you find out</p>
<p>geez why am I so grouchy lately or why</p>
<p>is um why do I feel so irritated why do</p>
<p>I feel so stressful well because you</p>
<p>just depleted your B1</p>
<p>so um a lot of things can deplete B1</p>
<p>so I will you know I have videos on that</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see uh now if</p>
<p>Terry gets his internet back he said his</p>
<p>power went out</p>
<p>um we went through that</p>
<p>we love that you have a farm</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk that I&rsquo;ll talk why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for a question Steve I&rsquo;ll talk a</p>
<p>little bit about um</p>
<p>uh some videos that I&rsquo;ll be doing coming</p>
<p>up here one really interesting video is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you one of the most</p>
<p>potent</p>
<p>natural cox-2 Inhibitors so you know</p>
<p>there are people that take um aspirin</p>
<p>Tylenol</p>
<p>um non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for</p>
<p>for pain and headaches and um the</p>
<p>problem is there&rsquo;s some slight minor</p>
<p>complications</p>
<p>um like you know bleeding in your</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>internally</p>
<p>ulcers gastritis</p>
<p>cancer things like that</p>
<p>um so there just happens to be</p>
<p>um natural Cox inhibitors out there and</p>
<p>that have virtually no side effects that</p>
<p>in some studies show that they work just</p>
<p>as good</p>
<p>as these drugs now you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>saying well why aren&rsquo;t they promoted</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t patent them you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make money on them yet the studies show</p>
<p>that they work and so</p>
<p>I mean come on if you&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>choice between a natural versus uh</p>
<p>synthetic you know go for the natural</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video on</p>
<p>that this week I already did the video</p>
<p>um so if you happen to be on</p>
<p>this drug and um you want an alternative</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m going to give you an option</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh one of the best ones which is</p>
<p>actually very interesting something that</p>
<p>to replace aspirin</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean aspirin also literally destroys</p>
<p>that lining that mucous lining of your</p>
<p>of your gut</p>
<p>um probably why it causes ulcers but</p>
<p>also that happens in the large intestine</p>
<p>too so here you are really destroying</p>
<p>your immune system so unfortunately</p>
<p>these medical discoveries sometimes come</p>
<p>with a package over 50 percent</p>
<p>of all drugs were designed based on</p>
<p>these um plant chemicals and</p>
<p>phytonutrients or phytochemicals that</p>
<p>have different effects</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m very interested in</p>
<p>you know having some organized</p>
<p>booklet or something to so you can have</p>
<p>references so you can go to different</p>
<p>things to know</p>
<p>alternatives to those things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to</p>
<p>create effects on</p>
<p>okay very good I am into the raw this is</p>
<p>funny so Terry our producer feeds me</p>
<p>questions and he um allows me to avoid</p>
<p>the raw data that comes through social</p>
<p>media now boys we I know we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>fascinated since we were little kids on</p>
<p>our PPS but there&rsquo;s a lot of pp</p>
<p>questions penis questions here which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure really don&rsquo;t have any level of</p>
<p>sincerity some of them do uh one of them</p>
<p>just seems so earthy I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>ask but there&rsquo;s plenty of other</p>
<p>questions so let&rsquo;s go to one of those</p>
<p>our dark circles and hollowness</p>
<p>hollowness a result of liver kidney</p>
<p>issue or thyroid issues I guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dark circles under their eyes</p>
<p>yeah yeah</p>
<p>um it can be it can definitely be that</p>
<p>uh it it can also be a kidney problem it</p>
<p>could be anemia</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it really depends on you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as simple as having this one</p>
<p>symptom and this one cause like it could</p>
<p>be several things so this is why you</p>
<p>have to try things and</p>
<p>of course um</p>
<p>um it could be that you&rsquo;re anemic um</p>
<p>these are all common things it also can</p>
<p>be that</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re inside too much and you</p>
<p>have no son and uh you have a lack of</p>
<p>sleep and you have these bags underneath</p>
<p>your eyes</p>
<p>that could be one of the cause too</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now okay a lot of people</p>
<p>recommending pot for Stuff uh remember</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m In The Raw unedited area</p>
<p>um oh here we go do it eating eggs every</p>
<p>day cause sensitivity that&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go much details there anybody</p>
<p>allergic to egg stock</p>
<p>yeah yeah you can have it be I have an</p>
<p>allergy to the egg the protein in eggs</p>
<p>but typically though if you have a good</p>
<p>healthy egg boy is it solve a lot of</p>
<p>nutritional deficiencies there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>great things in eggs especially if you</p>
<p>get the pasture-raised eggs now this</p>
<p>year Steve I&rsquo;m going to try and</p>
<p>experiment because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard of a</p>
<p>brush hog brush hog is a something you</p>
<p>kind of you can</p>
<p>you can cut down weeds with it right and</p>
<p>when I cut down weeds um boy you start</p>
<p>seeing millions and millions and</p>
<p>millions of grasshoppers and bugs and</p>
<p>things like that so what I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m going to start putting my</p>
<p>chickens</p>
<p>in those fields with all those bugs so</p>
<p>they can start eating the bugs because I</p>
<p>bet you anything the eggs would taste</p>
<p>even better if they lived on more bugs</p>
<p>even though we let them</p>
<p>roam around but there sure is a lot more</p>
<p>bugs in the pastures than there is in</p>
<p>other places so I&rsquo;ll let you know what</p>
<p>happens on that one Steve go get them go</p>
<p>get them chickens let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is bovine collagen healthy to take</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that doc have you ever heard of</p>
<p>it yeah let&rsquo;s uh uh cow collagen</p>
<p>um some people you know</p>
<p>swear by it some people hate it</p>
<p>um if it&rsquo;s a grass-fed grass finish</p>
<p>cow I mean I think it&rsquo;d be a great thing</p>
<p>um you know people say well I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to eat the the collagen from the</p>
<p>hoof or whatever or a different part of</p>
<p>the body well nose to tail I think</p>
<p>eating the whole animal is a better</p>
<p>thing than just having the animal meat</p>
<p>itself the skeletal muscle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yeah I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>um definitely</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see uh you know we never got</p>
<p>some answers back on the best blood</p>
<p>tests for cancer because of the internet</p>
<p>problem can you maybe clue Us in Doc and</p>
<p>educate us so so there&rsquo;s a test</p>
<p>um that you sometimes you have to</p>
<p>request it okay they don&rsquo;t normally do</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s called lactate dehydrogenase</p>
<p>okay lactate</p>
<p>dehydrogenase this is a very interesting</p>
<p>test I think it&rsquo;s very valuable it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>specifics but it gives you generally</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening to your cells</p>
<p>because this enzyme is in cells it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>inside the cell and when you rupture the</p>
<p>cell because the cell is damaged or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ruptured or it dies you get an increase</p>
<p>in this enzyme and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>good indicator that there&rsquo;s cancer going</p>
<p>on and the more you have of this enzyme</p>
<p>the more you have this cancer now it</p>
<p>could mean other things too</p>
<p>could mean that you have</p>
<p>just had a heart attack stroke liver</p>
<p>disease kidney disease could mean that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a certain medication it could</p>
<p>mean that you just had an intense</p>
<p>exercise bout</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you you didn&rsquo;t have these</p>
<p>other things right it could be a real</p>
<p>simple screening of cancer that you can</p>
<p>then maybe catch it in time and do</p>
<p>something about it but it can also be</p>
<p>used as a um</p>
<p>a way to determine if a treatment any</p>
<p>treatment is working or not because if</p>
<p>that enzyme is going down it means that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less rupturing or dying of your</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll release a video on that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>important test that next time your blood</p>
<p>test is called lactate dehydrogenase</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a that enzyme is produced when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making lactase which is a</p>
<p>different pathway involved with cancer</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to get into the</p>
<p>chemical name or pathway but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cancer one thing about cancer is it it</p>
<p>uses a different uh</p>
<p>um metabolic pathway</p>
<p>and it it grows really fast it Hogs a</p>
<p>lot of the sugar and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think for those of you that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>cancer you should start to eat as if you</p>
<p>have cancer and really try to prevent it</p>
<p>because once you get it it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>harder to</p>
<p>get rid of it you can still get rid of</p>
<p>it if you do a lot of fasting</p>
<p>but boy it&rsquo;s much easier to prevent it</p>
<p>so I think</p>
<p>going forward into this next year you</p>
<p>might want to add that to your goal of</p>
<p>um being so healthy that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bulletproof against these type of</p>
<p>illnesses and with the right knowledge</p>
<p>you can do it wonderful this question</p>
<p>answered things so much fun why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>do it again doc here&rsquo;s the true false</p>
<p>story and why don&rsquo;t you educate us on</p>
<p>the answer</p>
<p>okay having normal vitamin D levels in</p>
<p>your blood</p>
<p>is the best way to ensure you have</p>
<p>adequate cellular vitamin D</p>
<p>is it true or false</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>all right well do you want me to answer</p>
<p>it now or sure no because uh we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get an answer and we&rsquo;re about a minute</p>
<p>out so okay so so you know I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>people tell me this well I don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>Vitamin D because I have normal levels</p>
<p>in my blood yet you look at their</p>
<p>symptoms and they have their parents</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>all these symptoms of vitamin D like</p>
<p>autoimmune and arthritis you know like</p>
<p>Ms and Hashimoto&rsquo;s and they have um</p>
<p>um asthma and all these symptoms of a</p>
<p>low vitamin D level yet yet the abnormal</p>
<p>levels well it just so happens that</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s in order for the cell see</p>
<p>just just because you have enough</p>
<p>vitamin D in your blood does not tell</p>
<p>you what&rsquo;s going on in the cell what</p>
<p>allows the vitamin E to go in the cell</p>
<p>is through the vitamin D receptor that</p>
<p>just so happens that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good portion of the population</p>
<p>30 of the population that has a genetic</p>
<p>problem with vitamin D receptor with</p>
<p>receiving vitamin D and I am one of them</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>um get by on a usual amount of vitamin D</p>
<p>I have to take more and that is the</p>
<p>solution is just to take more than</p>
<p>normally people would take that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you override and drive this vitamin D</p>
<p>into the cell</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s various clues that your</p>
<p>body gives you that you need Vitamin D</p>
<p>regardless of how much you have in your</p>
<p>blood like inflammation like low back</p>
<p>pain like a persistent infection</p>
<p>um also these microorganisms especially</p>
<p>viruses</p>
<p>have a strategy of they now if you get</p>
<p>enough vitamin D they&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>so what they do is they actually have a</p>
<p>way of manipulating yourselves to block</p>
