    <p>The following is a conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett,</p>
<p>her second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a neuroscientist at Northeastern University</p>
<p>and one of my favorite people.</p>
<p>Her new book called Seven and a Half Lessons</p>
<p>about the Brain is out now as of a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>so you should definitely support Lisa by buying it</p>
<p>and sharing with friends if you like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great short intro to the human brain.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, the all in one drink</p>
<p>that I start every day with</p>
<p>to cover all my nutritional bases.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself</p>
<p>and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.</p>
<p>Masterclass, online courses that I enjoy</p>
<p>from some of the most amazing people in history.</p>
<p>And BetterHelp, online therapy with a licensed professional.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Lisa,</p>
<p>just like Manolis Calles,</p>
<p>is a local brilliant mind and friend</p>
<p>and someone I can see talking to many more times.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to talk to a scientist</p>
<p>not just about their field of expertise,</p>
<p>but also about random topics, even silly ones,</p>
<p>from love to music to philosophy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about having fun,</p>
<p>something I know nothing about.</p>
<p>This conversation is certainly that.</p>
<p>It may not always work, but it&rsquo;s worth a shot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s valuable to alternate</p>
<p>along all kinds of dimensions,</p>
<p>like between deeper technical discussions</p>
<p>and more fun random discussion,</p>
<p>from liberal thinker to conservative thinker,</p>
<p>from musician to athlete, from CEO to junior engineer,</p>
<p>from friend to stranger.</p>
<p>Variety makes life and conversation more interesting.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett.</p>
<p>Based on the comments in our previous conversation,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people will be very disappointed,</p>
<p>I should say, to learn that you are in fact married.</p>
<p>As they say, all the good ones are taken.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m a fan of your husband as well, Dan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a programmer and musician,</p>
<p>so a man after my own heart.</p>
<p>Can I ask a ridiculously over romanticized question</p>
<p>of when did you first fall in love with Dan?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a really romantic story, I think.</p>
<p>So I was divorced by the time I was 26, 27, 26, I guess.</p>
<p>And I was in my first academic job,</p>
<p>which was Penn State University,</p>
<p>which is in the middle of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>surrounded by mountains.</p>
<p>So you have, it&rsquo;s four hours to get anywhere,</p>
<p>to get to Philadelphia, New York, Washington.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re basically stuck, you know.</p>
<p>And I was very fortunate to have</p>
<p>a lot of other assistant professors</p>
<p>who were hired at the same time as I was.</p>
<p>So there were a lot of us,</p>
<p>we were all friends, which was really fun.</p>
<p>But I was single and I didn&rsquo;t wanna date a student.</p>
<p>And there were no,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t gonna date somebody in my department,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>So even at 20, whatever you were,</p>
<p>you were already wise enough to know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit, maybe, yeah.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call me wise at that age.</p>
<p>But anyways, not sure that I would say that I&rsquo;m wise now,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>And so after,</p>
<p>I was spending probably 16 hours a day in the lab</p>
<p>because it was my first year as an assistant professor</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot to do.</p>
<p>And I was also bitching and moaning to my friends</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t had sex in I don&rsquo;t know how many months</p>
<p>and I was starting to become unhappy with my life.</p>
<p>And I think at a certain point,</p>
<p>they just got tired of listening to me bitch and moan</p>
<p>and said, just do something about it then,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re unhappy.</p>
<p>And so the first thing I did was I made friends</p>
<p>with a sushi chef in town.</p>
<p>And this is like a State College, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>in the early 90s was there was like a pizza shop</p>
<p>and a sub shop and actually a very good bagel shop</p>
<p>and one good coffee shop and maybe one nice restaurant.</p>
<p>I mean, there was really,</p>
<p>but there was the second son of a Japanese sushi chef</p>
<p>who was not going to inherit the restaurant.</p>
<p>And so he moved to Pennsylvania and was giving sushi lessons.</p>
<p>So I met this guy, the sushi chef</p>
<p>and we decided to throw a sushi party at the coffee shop.</p>
<p>So we basically, it was the goal was to invite</p>
<p>every eligible bachelor really within like a 20 mile radius.</p>
<p>We had a totally fun time.</p>
<p>I wore an awesome crushed velvet burgundy dress,</p>
<p>it was beautiful dress.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t meet any, I met a lot of new friends,</p>
<p>but I did not meet anybody.</p>
<p>So then I thought, okay, well,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll try the Personals ads,</p>
<p>which I had never used before in my life.</p>
<p>And I first tried the paper Personals ads.</p>
<p>Like in the newspaper?</p>
<p>Like in the newspaper, that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And then a friend of mine said,</p>
<p>oh, you know, there&rsquo;s this thing called Net News.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going, this is like 1992 maybe.</p>
<p>So there was this anonymous, you could do it anonymously.</p>
<p>So you would read, you could post or you could read ads</p>
<p>and then respond to an address which was anonymous</p>
<p>and that was yoked to somebody&rsquo;s real address.</p>
<p>And there was always a lag</p>
<p>because it was this like a bulletin board sort of thing.</p>
<p>So at first I read them over</p>
<p>and I decided to respond to one or two.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was interesting.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is not on the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is totally on the internet.</p>
<p>But it takes, there&rsquo;s a delay of a couple of days</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1992, there&rsquo;s no web, web pictures.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pictures, the web doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all done in ASCII format sort of.</p>
<p>And, you know, but the ratio,</p>
<p>but the ratio of men to women was like 10 to one.</p>
<p>I mean, there were many more men</p>
<p>because it was basically academics and the government.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>I mean, I think AOL maybe was just starting</p>
<p>to become popular, but.</p>
<p>And so the first person I met told me that he was a scientist</p>
<p>who worked for NASA and, yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways, it turned out that he didn&rsquo;t actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is how they brag is like you elevate your,</p>
<p>as opposed to saying you&rsquo;re taller than you are,</p>
<p>you say like your position is higher.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I actually, I would have been fine</p>
<p>dating somebody who wasn&rsquo;t a scientist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they have, it&rsquo;s just that whoever I date</p>
<p>has to just accept that I am and that I was pretty ambitious</p>
<p>and was trying to make my career.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s not, I think it&rsquo;s maybe more common</p>
<p>now for men to maybe accept that in their female partners,</p>
<p>but at that time, not so common.</p>
<p>It could be intimidating, I guess.</p>
<p>Yes, that has been said.</p>
<p>And so then the next one I actually corresponded with,</p>
<p>and we actually got to the point of talking on the phone,</p>
<p>and we had this really kind of funny conversation</p>
<p>where, you know, we&rsquo;re chatting and he said,</p>
<p>he introduces the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really looking for a dominant woman.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, I&rsquo;m a psychologist by training,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, he means sex roles.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m very assertive</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad you think that, you know, okay.</p>
<p>Anyways, long story short, that&rsquo;s not really what he meant.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and I just, you know,</p>
<p>that will just show you my level of naivete.</p>
<p>Like, I was like, I didn&rsquo;t completely understand,</p>
<p>but I was like, well, yeah, you know, no.</p>
<p>At one point he asked me how I felt</p>
<p>about him wearing my lingerie, and I was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even share my lingerie with my sister.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t share my lingerie with anybody, you know?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The third one I interacted with was a banker</p>
<p>who lived in Singapore, and that conversation</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t last very long because he made an analogy,</p>
<p>I guess he made an analogy between me</p>
<p>and a character in The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>the woman who&rsquo;s raped in The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>and I was like, okay, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good, no, that&rsquo;s not a good one.</p>
<p>Not that part, not that scene.</p>
<p>Not that scene.</p>
<p>So then I was like, okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna post my own ad, and so I did.</p>
<p>I posted, well, first I wrote my ad,</p>
<p>and then I, of course, I checked it with my friends</p>
<p>who were all also assistant professors.</p>
<p>They were like my little Greek chorus,</p>
<p>and then I posted it, and I got something like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 80 something responses in 24 hours.</p>
<p>I mean, it was very.</p>
<p>Do you remember the pitch?</p>
<p>Like how you, I guess, condensed yourself?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember it exactly, although Dan has it,</p>
<p>but actually for our 20th wedding anniversary,</p>
<p>he took our exchanges, and he printed them off</p>
<p>and put them in a leather bound book for us to read,</p>
<p>which was really sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I was just really direct.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m almost 30.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking, I&rsquo;m looking for something serious.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I forgot to say where my location was</p>
<p>and my age, which I forgot.</p>
<p>So I got lots of, I mean, I will say,</p>
<p>so I printed off all of the responses,</p>
<p>and I had all my friends over, and we had a big,</p>
<p>I made a big pot of gumbo,</p>
<p>and we drank through several bottles of wine</p>
<p>reading these responses.</p>
<p>And I would say for the most part, they were really sweet,</p>
<p>like earnest and genuine as much as you could tell</p>
<p>that somebody is being genuine.</p>
<p>I mean, it seemed, there were a couple of really funky ones,</p>
<p>like this one couple who told me</p>
<p>that I was their soulmate, the two of them,</p>
<p>when they were looking for a third person,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>But mostly super, seemed like super genuine people.</p>
<p>And so I chose five men to start corresponding with,</p>
<p>and I was corresponding with them.</p>
<p>And then about a week later, I get this other email.</p>
<p>And okay, and then I post something the next day</p>
<p>that said, okay, thank you so much,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna, I answered every person back.</p>
<p>But then after that, I said, okay,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna answer anymore,</p>
<p>because they were still coming in,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t, I have a job,</p>
<p>and a house to take care of and stuff.</p>
<p>So, and then about a week later, I get this other email.</p>
<p>And he says, he just describes himself,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m this, I&rsquo;m this, I&rsquo;m this, I&rsquo;m a chef,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist, I&rsquo;m a this, I&rsquo;m a this.</p>
<p>And so I emailed him back, and I said, you know,</p>
<p>you seem interesting, you can write me</p>
<p>at my actual address if you want, here&rsquo;s my address.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really responding,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really responding to other people anymore,</p>
<p>but you seem interesting, you know,</p>
<p>you can write to me if you want.</p>
<p>And then he wrote to me, and I wrote him back,</p>
<p>and it was a nondescript kind of email,</p>
<p>and I wrote him back, and I said, thanks for responding.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m really busy right now.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of writing</p>
<p>my first slate of grant applications,</p>
<p>so I was really consumed, and I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to you in a couple of days.</p>
<p>And so I did, I waited a couple days</p>
<p>till my grants were, you know, safe,</p>
<p>grant applications safely out the door.</p>
<p>And then I emailed him back, and then he emailed me,</p>
<p>and then really across two days, we sent 100 emails.</p>
<p>And text only, was there pictures or any of that stuff?</p>
<p>Text only, text only.</p>
<p>And then, so this was like a Thursday and a Friday,</p>
<p>and then Friday, he said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk on the weekend on the phone.</p>
<p>And I said, okay.</p>
<p>And he wanted to talk Sunday night,</p>
<p>and I had a date Sunday night.</p>
<p>So I said, okay, sure, we can talk Sunday night.</p>
<p>And then I was like, well, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really wanna cancel my date,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna call him on Saturday.</p>
<p>So I just called, I cold called him on Saturday,</p>
<p>and a woman answered.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>And so she says, you know, hello.</p>
<p>And I say, oh, you know, stand there.</p>
<p>And she said, sure, can I ask who&rsquo;s calling?</p>
<p>And I said, tell him it&rsquo;s Lisa.</p>
<p>And she went, oh my God, oh my God, I&rsquo;m just a friend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a friend.</p>
<p>I just need to tell you, I&rsquo;m just a friend.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is adorable, right?</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t, and then he gets on the phone,</p>
<p>not hi, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>The first thing he says to me, she&rsquo;s just a friend.</p>
<p>So I was just so charmed really by the whole thing.</p>
<p>So it was Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>It was the Jewish day of atonement that was ending</p>
<p>and they were baking cookies and going to a break fast.</p>
<p>So people, you know, as you know, fast all day,</p>
<p>and then they go to a party and they break fast.</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, I&rsquo;ll just cancel my date.</p>
<p>So I did, and I stayed home and we talked for eight hours.</p>
<p>And then the next night for six hours.</p>
<p>And basically it just went on like that.</p>
<p>And then by the end of the week, he flew to stay college.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;d gone through this whole thing</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d said, we&rsquo;re gonna take it slow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get to know each other, you know.</p>
<p>And then really by, I think we talked like two or three times</p>
<p>these like really long conversations.</p>
<p>And then he said, I&rsquo;m just gonna fly there.</p>
<p>And then, so of course there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that there were fax machines</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>Maybe there were, but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Anyway, so he, we decided we&rsquo;ll exchange pictures.</p>
<p>And so he, you know, I take my photograph</p>
<p>and I give it to my secretary.</p>
<p>And I say to my secretary.</p>
<p>Fax this.</p>
<p>I say that, send this priority mail.</p>
<p>Priority mail, yeah.</p>
<p>And he goes, okay, I&rsquo;ll send a priority mail.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s a priority mail.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I know, priority mail, okay.</p>
<p>And then, so I get Dan&rsquo;s photograph in the mail.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s him in shorts.</p>
<p>And you can see that he&rsquo;s probably somewhere</p>
<p>like the Bahamas or something like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like cropped.</p>
<p>So clearly what he&rsquo;s done is he&rsquo;s taken a photograph</p>
<p>where, you know, he&rsquo;s in it with someone else</p>
<p>who turned out to be his ex wife.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking, well, this is awesome.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, you know, very appealing to me, very attractive.</p>
<p>And then, you know, my photograph doesn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>And, you know, so like one day and then two days</p>
<p>and then, you know, he&rsquo;s like, you know, I said,</p>
<p>well, I asked my secretary to send a priority.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, you know, what he did.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I said, I&rsquo;m like, well, you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>you know, you don&rsquo;t have to come.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m gonna, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had like five dates,</p>
<p>the equivalent of five dates practically.</p>
<p>And then, so he&rsquo;s supposed to fly on a Thursday or Friday,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And I get a call like maybe an hour</p>
<p>before his flight&rsquo;s supposed to leave.</p>
<p>And he says, hi.</p>
<p>And I say, and it&rsquo;s just something in his voice, right?</p>
<p>And I say, cause at this point I think I&rsquo;ve talked to him</p>
<p>like for 25 hours, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And he says, hi.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you got the picture.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s your,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just not a good, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s probably not your best.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t have to come.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m coming.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, you don&rsquo;t have to come.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, no, no, I really wanna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m getting on the plane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you don&rsquo;t have to get on the plane.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m getting on the plane.</p>
<p>And so I go down to my, I go,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my office, this is happening, right?</p>
<p>So I go downstairs to one of my closest friends</p>
<p>who is still actually one of my closest friends,</p>
<p>who is one of my colleagues and Kevin.</p>
<p>And I say, Kevin, and I go to Kevin,</p>
<p>I go, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, he doesn&rsquo;t like the photograph.</p>
<p>And Kevin&rsquo;s like, well, which photograph should you send?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, you know the one</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re shooting pool?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you sent that photograph?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a horrible photograph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, but it&rsquo;s the only one that I had</p>
<p>that was like, where my hair was kind of similar</p>
<p>to what it is now, and he&rsquo;s like, Lisa,</p>
<p>like, do I have to check everything for you?</p>
<p>You should not have sent that, you know?</p>
<p>But still, he flew over.</p>
<p>So he flew. Where from, by the way?</p>
<p>He was in graduate school at Amherst,</p>
<p>yeah, at UMass Amherst.</p>
<p>So he flew and I picked him up at the airport</p>
<p>and he was happy, so whatever the concern was, was gone.</p>
<p>And I was dressed, you know, I carefully, carefully dressed.</p>
<p>Were you nervous?</p>
<p>I was really, really nervous.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t really believe in fate</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really think there&rsquo;s only one person</p>
<p>that you can be with.</p>
<p>But I think some people are curvy,</p>
<p>you know, people who, some people are curvy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of complicated,</p>
<p>and so the number of people who fit them</p>
<p>is maybe less than.</p>
<p>I like it, mathematically speaking, yeah.</p>
<p>And so when I was going to pick him up at the airport,</p>
<p>I was thinking, well, this could,</p>
<p>I could be going to pick up the person I&rsquo;m gonna marry.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I really, but I really, you know,</p>
<p>like, our conversations were just very authentic</p>
<p>and very moving and we really connected.</p>
<p>And I really felt like he understood me, actually,</p>
<p>in a way that a lot of people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And what was really nice was, at the time,</p>
<p>you know, the airport was this tiny little airport</p>
<p>out in a cornfield, basically.</p>
<p>And so driving back to the town,</p>
<p>we were in the car for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>completely in the dark, as I was driving.</p>
<p>And so it was very similar to,</p>
<p>we had just spent, you know, 20 something hours</p>
<p>on the telephone, sitting in the dark,</p>
<p>talking to each other.</p>
<p>So it was very familiar.</p>
<p>And we basically spent the whole weekend together</p>
<p>and he met all my friends and we had a big party.</p>
<p>And at the end of the weekend,</p>
<p>I said, okay, you know,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna give this a shot,</p>
<p>we probably shouldn&rsquo;t see other people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a risk, you know?</p>
<p>Commitment.</p>
<p>But I just didn&rsquo;t see how it would work</p>
<p>if we were dating people locally</p>
<p>and then also seeing each other at a distance.</p>
<p>Because, you know, I&rsquo;ve had long distance relationships</p>
<p>before and they&rsquo;re hard and they take a lot of effort.</p>
<p>And so we decided we&rsquo;d give it three months</p>
<p>and see what happened and that was it.</p>
<p>This is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all, what is it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several billion of us</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of roaming this world</p>
<p>and then you kind of stick together.</p>
<p>You find somebody that just like gets you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to think about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably thousands if not millions of people</p>
<p>that would be sticky to you,</p>
<p>depending on the curvature of your space.</p>
<p>But what is the, could you speak to the stickiness?</p>
<p>Like to the, just the falling in love?</p>
<p>Like seeing that somebody really gets you?</p>
<p>Maybe by way of telling, do you think,</p>
<p>do you remember there was a moment</p>
<p>when you just realized, damn it, I think I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>like I think this is the guy.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m in love.</p>
<p>We were having these conversations actually</p>
<p>from the, really from the second weekend we were together.</p>
<p>So he flew back the next weekend to State College</p>
<p>because it was my birthday.</p>
<p>It was my 30th birthday.</p>
<p>My friends were throwing me a party.</p>
<p>And we went hiking and we hiked up some mountain</p>
<p>and we were sitting on a cliff over this overlook</p>
<p>and talking to each other.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, and I actually said to him,</p>
<p>like I haven&rsquo;t really known you very long,</p>
<p>but I feel like I&rsquo;m falling in love with you,</p>
<p>which can&rsquo;t possibly be happening.</p>
<p>I must be projecting, but it certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t believe in love at first sight.</p>
<p>So this can&rsquo;t really be happening,</p>
<p>but it sort of feels like it is.</p>
<p>And he was like, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>And so for the first three months or four months,</p>
<p>we would say things to each other.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like I&rsquo;m in love with you,</p>
<p>but you know, but that can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but things don&rsquo;t really work like that.</p>
<p>So, but you know, so, and then it became a joke.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I&rsquo;m in love with you.</p>
<p>And then eventually, you know, I think,</p>
<p>but I think that was one moment</p>
<p>where we were talking about just,</p>
<p>you know, not just all the great aspirations you have</p>
<p>or all the things,</p>
<p>but also things you don&rsquo;t like about yourself,</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;re worried about,</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;re scared of.</p>
<p>And then I think that was sort of solidified</p>
<p>the relationship.</p>
<p>And then there was one weekend</p>
<p>where we went to Maine in the winter,</p>
<p>which I mean, I really love the beach always,</p>
<p>but in the winter, particularly.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just beautiful and calm and whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I also, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, so there&rsquo;s this grand majestic scene</p>
<p>of, you know, this very powerful ocean</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all these like beautiful blue grays</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just stunning.</p>
<p>And so we were sitting on this huge rock in Maine</p>
<p>and where we&rsquo;d gone for the weekend,</p>
<p>it was freezing cold.</p>
<p>And I honestly can&rsquo;t remember what he said</p>
<p>or what I said or what,</p>
<p>but I definitely remember having this feeling of,</p>
<p>I absolutely wanna stay with this person.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what my life will be like</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not with this person.</p>
<p>Like I need to be with this person.</p>
<p>Can we, from a scientific and a human perspective,</p>
<p>dig into your belief that first love at first sight</p>
<p>is not possible?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe in it?</p>
<p>Cause there is, you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s like a magic</p>
<p>where you see somebody in the Jack Kerouac way</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, wow, that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a special little glimmer or something.</p>
<p>Oh, I definitely think you can connect with someone</p>
<p>instant, in an instance.</p>
<p>And I definitely think you can say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s something there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really clicking with that person.</p>
<p>Romantically, but also just as friends,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to do that.</p>
<p>You recognize a mind that&rsquo;s like yours</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s compatible with yours.</p>
<p>There are ways that you feel like you&rsquo;re being understood</p>
<p>or that you understand something about this person</p>
<p>or maybe you see something in this person</p>
<p>that you find really compelling or intriguing.</p>
<p>But I think your brain is predictive organ, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using your past.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re projecting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using your past to make predictions</p>
<p>and I mean, not deliberately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how your brain is wired.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s filling in all of the gaps that you,</p>
<p>there are lots of gaps of information</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t, information you don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And so your brain is filling those in and.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what love is?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, to some extent, sure, you always,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s research to show that people who are in love</p>
<p>always see the best in each other</p>
<p>and when there&rsquo;s a negative interpretation</p>
<p>or a positive interpretation,</p>
<p>they choose the positive ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of positive illusion there going on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the research shows.</p>
<p>But I think that when you find somebody</p>
<p>when you find somebody who not just appreciates</p>
<p>your faults but loves you for them actually,</p>
<p>like maybe even doesn&rsquo;t see them as a fault,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, so you have to be honest enough</p>
<p>about what your faults are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to love someone for all the things</p>
<p>that they, for all the wonderful characteristics they have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder, I think, to love someone despite their faults</p>
<p>or maybe even the faults that they see</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really faults at all to you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually something really special.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that, can&rsquo;t you explain that</p>
<p>by saying the brain kind of, like you&rsquo;re projecting,</p>
<p>you have a conception of a human being</p>
<p>or just a spirit that really connects with you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re projecting that onto that person</p>
<p>and within that framework, all their faults</p>
<p>then become beautiful, like little.</p>
<p>Maybe, but you just have to pay attention</p>
<p>to the prediction error.</p>
<p>No, but maybe that&rsquo;s what love,</p>
<p>like maybe you started ignoring the prediction error.</p>
<p>Maybe love is just your ability, like.</p>
<p>To ignore the prediction error.</p>
<p>Well, I think that there&rsquo;s some research</p>
<p>that might say that, but that&rsquo;s not my experience, I guess.</p>
<p>But there is some research that says,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some research that says</p>
<p>you have to have an optimal margin of illusion,</p>
<p>which means that you put a positive spin on smaller things,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t ignore the bigger things, right?</p>
<p>And I think without being judgmental at all,</p>
<p>when someone says to me, you&rsquo;re not who I thought you were,</p>
<p>I mean, nobody has said that to me in a really long time,</p>
<p>but certainly when I was younger,</p>
<p>that was, you&rsquo;re not who I thought you were.</p>
<p>My reaction to that was, well, whose fault is that?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a pretty upfront person.</p>
<p>I mean, I will though say that in my experience,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t lie to you about who they are.</p>
<p>They lie to themselves in your presence.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you don&rsquo;t wanna get tied up in that,</p>
<p>tangled up in that.</p>
<p>And I think from the get go,</p>
<p>Dan and I were just for whatever reason,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because we both had been divorced already</p>
<p>and, you know, he told me who we thought he was</p>
<p>and he was pretty accurate as far as I could,</p>
<p>pretty much actually.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve ever come across a characteristic</p>
<p>in him that really surprised me in a bad way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know yourself.</p>
<p>It is hard to know yourself.</p>
<p>And to communicate that.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll say, you know,</p>
<p>I had the advantage of training as a therapist,</p>
<p>which meant for five years I was under a fucking microscope.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, when I was training as a therapist,</p>
<p>it was hour for hour supervision,</p>
<p>which meant if you were in a room with a client for an hour,</p>
<p>you had an hour with a supervisor.</p>
<p>So that supervisor was behind the mirror for your session.</p>
<p>And then you went and had an hour of discussion</p>
<p>about what you said, what you didn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>learning to use your own feelings and thoughts</p>
<p>as a tool to probe the mind of the client and so on.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t help but learn a lot of,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t help but learn a lot about yourself</p>
<p>in that process.</p>
<p>Do you think knowing or learning how the sausage is made</p>
<p>ruins the magic of the actual experience?</p>
<p>Like you as a neuroscientist who studies the brain,</p>
<p>do you think it ruins the magic of like love at first sight?</p>
<p>Or are you, do you consciously are still able</p>
<p>to lose yourself in the moment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely able to lose myself in the moment.</p>
<p>Is wine involved?</p>
<p>Not always, chocolate.</p>
<p>I mean, some kind of mind altering substance, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess what I would say though,</p>
<p>is that for me, part of the magic is the process.</p>
<p>Like, so I remember a day there was,</p>
<p>while I was working on this book of essays,</p>
<p>I was in New York.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember why I was in New York,</p>
<p>but I was in New York for something.</p>
<p>And I was in Central Park and I was looking</p>
<p>at all the people with their babies.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, each one of these,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tiny little brain that&rsquo;s wiring itself right now.</p>
<p>And I just, I felt in that moment,</p>
<p>I was like, I am never gonna look at an infant</p>
<p>in the same way ever again.</p>
<p>And so to me, I mean, honestly,</p>
<p>before I started learning about brain development,</p>
<p>I thought babies were cute, but not that interesting</p>
<p>until they could do interact with you and do things.</p>
<p>Of course, my own infant, I thought,</p>
<p>was extraordinarily interesting,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re kind of like lumps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s until they can interact with you,</p>
<p>but they are anything but lumps.</p>
<p>I mean, so, and part of the,</p>
<p>I mean, all I can say is I have deep affection now</p>
<p>for like tiny little babies in a way</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t really before</p>
<p>because of the, I&rsquo;m just so curious.</p>
<p>But the actual process of the mechanisms</p>
<p>of the wiring of the brain, the learning,</p>
<p>all the magic of the neurobiology.</p>
<p>Yeah, and or something like,</p>
<p>when you make eye contact with someone directly,</p>
<p>sometimes you feel something, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>And so to me, that&rsquo;s not backing away from the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like expanding the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s incredibly cool.</p>
<p>You know, when I was, I&rsquo;ll just say that</p>
<p>when I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>I also was in therapy because it&rsquo;s almost a given</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna be in therapy yourself</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna become a therapist.</p>
<p>And I had a deal with my therapist,</p>
<p>which was that I could call timeout</p>
<p>at any moment that I wanted to,</p>
<p>as long as I was being responsible about it.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t using it as a way to get out of something.</p>
<p>And he could tell me, no, he could decline and say,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re using this to get out of something.</p>
<p>But I could call timeout whenever I want</p>
<p>and say, what are you doing right now?</p>
<p>Like, what are you, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m experiencing.</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>Like I wanted to use my own experience</p>
<p>to interrogate what the process was.</p>
<p>And that made it more helpful in a way.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t think learning how something works</p>
<p>makes it less magical actually,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just me, I guess.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, would you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I tend to have two modes.</p>
<p>One is an engineer and one is a romantic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m conscious of like, there&rsquo;s two rooms.</p>
<p>You can go into the one, the engineer room.</p>
<p>And I think that ruins the romance.</p>
<p>So I tend to, there&rsquo;s two rooms.</p>
<p>One is the engineering room.</p>
<p>Think from first principles, how do we build the thing</p>
<p>that creates this kind of behavior?</p>
<p>And then you go into the romantic room</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like emotional, it&rsquo;s a roller coaster.</p>
<p>And then the thing is, let&rsquo;s take it slow.</p>
<p>And then you get married the next night</p>
<p>that you just this giant mess and you write a song</p>
<p>and then you cry and then you send a bunch of texts</p>
<p>and anger and whatever.</p>
<p>And somehow you&rsquo;re in Vegas and there&rsquo;s random people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re drunk and whatever, all that,</p>
<p>like in poetry and just mess of it, fighting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not, those are two rooms</p>
<p>and you go back between them.</p>
<p>But I think the way you put it is quite poetic.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re much better at adulting</p>
<p>with love than perhaps I am.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a magic to children.</p>
<p>I also think like of adults as children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool to see, it&rsquo;s a cool thought experiment</p>
<p>to look at adults and think like that used to be a baby.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s like a fully wired baby.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just walking around pretending to be like</p>
<p>all serious and important, wearing a suit or something.</p>
<p>But that used to be a baby.</p>
<p>And then you think of like the parenting</p>
<p>and all the experiences they had.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s cool to think of it that way.</p>
<p>But then I start thinking like</p>
<p>from a machine learning perspective.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re like the romantic moments,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, all that falls away.</p>
<p>I forget about all of that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Russian thing.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>But I also think it might be an age thing</p>
<p>or maybe an experience thing.</p>
<p>So I think we all, I mean,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re exposed to Western culture at all,</p>
<p>you are exposed to the sort of idealized,</p>
<p>stereotypic, romantic exchange.</p>
<p>And what does it mean to be romantic?</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a test.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing how to phrase it.</p>
<p>Okay, so not really a test,</p>
<p>but this tells you something about</p>
<p>your own ideas about romance.</p>
<p>For Valentine&rsquo;s Day one year,</p>
<p>my husband bought me a six way plug.</p>
<p>Is that romantic or not romantic?</p>
<p>Like, sorry, six way plug, is that like an outlet?</p>
<p>Yeah, like to put it in an outlet.</p>
<p>Is that romantic or not romantic?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends the look in his eyes when he does it.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on the conversation</p>
<p>that led up to that point.</p>
<p>Depends how much, it&rsquo;s like the music,</p>
<p>because you have a very, you&rsquo;re both from the,</p>
<p>my experiences with you as a fan,</p>
<p>you have both a romantic niche,</p>
<p>but you have a very pragmatic,</p>
<p>like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about a six way plug</p>
<p>that cuts through the bullshit</p>
<p>that connects to the human,</p>
<p>like he understands who you are.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>That was the most romantic gift he could have given me</p>
<p>because he knows me so well.</p>
<p>He has a deep understanding of me,</p>
<p>which is that I will sit and suffer and complain</p>
<p>about the fact that I have to plug and unplug things.</p>
<p>And I will bitch and moan until the cows come home,</p>
<p>but it would never occur to me to go buy</p>
<p>a bloody six way plug.</p>
<p>Whereas for him, he bought it, he plugged it in,</p>
<p>he arranged, he taped up all my wires,</p>
<p>he made it like really usable.</p>
<p>And for me, that was the best present.</p>
<p>It was the most romantic thing</p>
<p>because he understood who I was</p>
<p>and he did something very,</p>
<p>or just the casual, like we moved into a house</p>
<p>that we went from having a two car garage</p>
<p>to a one car garage.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, I&rsquo;m from Canada,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not bothered by snow.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m a little bothered by snow,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very bothered by snow.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, you can park your car in the garage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Every day when it snows, he goes out and cleans my car.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>I never asked him to do it, he just does it</p>
<p>because he knows that I&rsquo;m cutting it really close</p>
<p>in the morning, when we all used to go to work.</p>
<p>I have a time to the second</p>
<p>so that I can get up as late as possible,</p>
<p>work out as long as possible,</p>
<p>and make it into my office</p>
<p>like a minute before my first meeting.</p>
<p>And so if it snows unexpectedly or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screwed because now that&rsquo;s an added 10 or 15 minutes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be late.</p>
<p>Anyways, it&rsquo;s just these little tiny things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really easygoing guy</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t look like somebody</p>
<p>who pays attention to detail.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t fuss about detail,</p>
<p>but he definitely pays attention to detail.</p>
<p>And it is very, very romantic in the sense</p>
<p>that he loves me despite my little details.</p>
<p>And understands you.</p>
<p>Yeah, he understands me.</p>
<p>It is kind of hilarious that that is,</p>
<p>the six way plug is the most fulfilling,</p>
<p>richest display of romance in your life.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean about romance.</p>
<p>Romance is really, it&rsquo;s not all about chocolates</p>
<p>and flowers and whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, those are all nice too, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s about the six way plug.</p>
<p>So maybe one way I could ask</p>
<p>before we talk about the details,</p>
<p>you also have the author of another book</p>
<p>as we talked about how emotions are made.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about the process of writing.</p>
<p>You mentioned you were in New York.</p>
<p>What have you learned from writing these two books</p>
<p>about the actual process of writing?</p>
<p>And maybe, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the most interesting thing</p>
<p>to talk about there.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest challenges</p>
<p>or the boring, mundane, systematic,</p>
<p>like day to day of what worked for you,</p>
<p>like hacks or even just about the neuroscience</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve learned through the process</p>
<p>of trying to write them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing I learned.</p>
<p>If you think that it&rsquo;s gonna take you a year</p>
<p>to write your book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take you three years to write your book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing I learned</p>
<p>is that no matter how organized you are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always gonna take way longer than what you think</p>
<p>in part because very few people make an outline</p>
<p>and then just stick to it.</p>
<p>Some of the topics really take on a life of their own</p>
<p>and to some extent you wanna let them have their voice.</p>
<p>You wanna follow leads until you feel satisfied</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve dealt with the topic appropriately.</p>
<p>But that part is actually fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun to feel like you&rsquo;re constantly behind the eight</p>
<p>ball in terms of time.</p>
<p>But it is the exploration and the foraging for information</p>
<p>is incredibly fun.</p>
<p>For me anyways, I found it really enjoyable.</p>
<p>And if I wasn&rsquo;t also running a lab at the same time</p>
<p>and trying to keep my family going,</p>
<p>the whole thing would have just been fun.</p>
<p>But I would say the hardest thing about,</p>
<p>the most important thing I think I learned</p>
<p>is also the hardest thing and that for me,</p>
<p>which is knowing what to leave out.</p>
<p>A really good storyteller knows what to leave out.</p>
<p>In academic writing, you shouldn&rsquo;t leave anything out.</p>
<p>All the details should be there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written or participated in writing</p>
<p>over 200 papers, peer reviewed papers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty good with detail.</p>
<p>Knowing what to leave out and not harming</p>
<p>the validity of the story.</p>
<p>That is a tricky, tricky thing.</p>
<p>It was tricky when I wrote How Emotions Are Made,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a standard popular science book.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 300 something pages.</p>
<p>And then it has like a thousand end notes.</p>
<p>And then each of the end notes is attached to a web note,</p>
<p>which is also long.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s, and it start, and I mean the final draft,</p>
<p>I mean, I wrote three drafts of that book actually.</p>
<p>And the final draft, and then I had to cut by a third.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like 150,000 words or something.</p>
<p>And I had to cut it down to like 110.</p>
<p>So obviously it&rsquo;s, I struggle with what to leave out.</p>
<p>Brevity is not my strong suit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always telling people that it&rsquo;s a warning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why this book was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always been really fascinated with essays.</p>
<p>I love reading essays.</p>
<p>And after reading a small set of essays by Anne Fadiman</p>
<p>called At Large and At Small,</p>
<p>which I just love these little essays.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the topic of those essays?</p>
<p>They are, they&rsquo;re called familiar essays.</p>
<p>So the topics are like everyday topics,</p>
<p>like mail, coffee, chocolate.</p>
<p>I mean, just like, and what she does</p>
<p>is she weaves her own experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like these conversations</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so good at curating, actually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re weaving together history and philosophy and science</p>
<p>and also personal reflections.</p>
<p>And a little bit, you feel like you&rsquo;re like eavesdropping</p>
<p>on someone&rsquo;s train of thought in a way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, they&rsquo;re really compelling to me.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s just a mundane topic.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>to learn about like all of these little stories</p>
<p>in the wrapping of the history of like mail.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And so I read these essays</p>
<p>and then I wrote to her a little fan girl email.</p>
<p>This was many years ago.</p>
<p>And I said, I just love this book.</p>
<p>And how did you learn to write essays like this?</p>
<p>And she gave me a reading list of essays</p>
<p>that I should read like writers.</p>
<p>And so I read them all.</p>
<p>And anyway, so I decided it would be a really good challenge</p>
<p>for me to try to write something really brief</p>
<p>where I could focus on one or two really fascinating tidbits</p>
<p>of neuroscience, connect each one</p>
<p>to something philosophical or like just a question</p>
<p>about human nature.</p>
<p>Do it in a really brief format</p>
<p>without violating the validity of the science.</p>
<p>That was a, I just set myself this,</p>
<p>what I thought of as a really, really big challenge</p>
<p>in part because it was an incredibly hard thing</p>
<p>for me to do in the first book.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should say that this is,</p>
<p>The Seven and a Half Lessons is a very short book.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like it embodies brevity, right?</p>
<p>The whole point throughout is just,</p>
<p>I mean, you could tell that there&rsquo;s editing,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s pain in trying to bring it</p>
<p>as brief as possible, as clean as possible, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s, the way I think of it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little book of big science and big ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, really big ideas in brief little packages.</p>
<p>And I wrote it so that people could read it.</p>
<p>I love reading on the beach.</p>
<p>I love reading essays on the beach.</p>
<p>I read it, I wrote it so people could read it on the beach</p>
<p>or in the bathtub or a subway stop.</p>
<p>Even if the beach is frozen over in the snow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so my husband, Dan, calls it</p>
<p>the first neuroscience beach read.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his phrasing, yeah.</p>
<p>And like you said, you learn a lot about writing</p>
<p>from your husband, like you were saying offline.</p>
<p>Well, he is, of the two of us, he is the better writer.</p>
<p>He is a masterful writer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, I mean, he&rsquo;s a PhD in computer science.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a software engineer,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also really good at organization of knowledge.</p>
<p>So he built for a company he used to work for,</p>
<p>he built one of the first knowledge management systems.</p>
<p>And he now works at Google</p>
<p>where he does engineering education.</p>
<p>Like he understands how to tell a good story,</p>
<p>just about anything, really.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got impeccable timing, he&rsquo;s really funny.</p>
<p>And luckily for me, he knows very little</p>
<p>about psychology or neuroscience.</p>
<p>Well, now he knows more, obviously, but.</p>
<p>So when How Emotions Were Made, he was really, really helpful</p>
<p>to me because the first draft of every chapter</p>
<p>was me talking to him about what,</p>
<p>I would talk out loud about what I wanted to say</p>
<p>and the order in which I wanted to say it.</p>
<p>And then I would write it and then he would read it</p>
<p>and tell me all the bits that could be excised.</p>
<p>And sometimes we would, I should say,</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t, he and I don&rsquo;t really argue about much</p>
<p>except directions in the car.</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re gonna have an argument,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be where it&rsquo;s gonna happen, where.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of the argument about directions exactly?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know, it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that spatially,</p>
<p>I use egocentric space.</p>
<p>So I wanna say, turn left.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m reasoning in relation</p>
<p>to my own physical corporeal body.</p>
<p>So you walk to the church and you turn left and you,</p>
<p>then whatever, I&rsquo;m always like,</p>
<p>and he gives directions allocentrically,</p>
<p>which means organized around north, south, east, west.</p>
<p>So to you, the earth is at the center of the solar system</p>
<p>and to him, reasonably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the center.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the center of the solar system.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>Anyway, but here, we had some really riproaring arguments,</p>
<p>like really riproaring arguments where he would say,</p>
<p>like, who is this for?</p>
<p>Is this for the 1%?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be like, 1% meaning not wealth,</p>
<p>but like civilians versus academics.</p>
<p>Are these for the scientists</p>
<p>or is this for the civilians, right?</p>
<p>So he speaks for the people, for the civilians.</p>
<p>He speaks for the people and I&rsquo;d be like, no, you have to.</p>
<p>And so he made, after one terrible argument that we had</p>
<p>where it was really starting to affect our relationship</p>
<p>because we were so mad at each other all the time,</p>
<p>he made these little signs, writing and science.</p>
<p>And we only use them, this was like,</p>
<p>when you pulled out a sign, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like the other person just wins</p>
<p>and you have to stop fighting about it and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And so we just did that.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t really have to use it too much for this book</p>
<p>because this book was in some ways,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to learn a lot of new things for this book.</p>
<p>I had to learn some, but a lot of</p>
<p>what I learned for How Emotions Are Made</p>
<p>really stood me in good stead for this book.</p>
<p>So there was a little bit,</p>
<p>each essay was a little bit of learning.</p>
<p>A couple were, was a little more than the small amount.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t have so much trouble here.</p>
<p>I had a lot of trouble with the first book.</p>
<p>But still even here, he would tell me</p>
<p>that I could take something out</p>
<p>and I really wanted to keep it.</p>
<p>And I think we only use the signs once.</p>
<p>Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book,</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>Can we talk about, so one of the essays looks at evolution.</p>
<p>It looks at evolution.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big question.</p>
<p>Did the human brain evolve to think?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially the question that you address in the essay.</p>
<p>Can you speak to it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The big caveat here is that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know why brains evolved.</p>
<p>The big why questions are called teleological questions.</p>
<p>And in general, scientists should avoid those questions</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know really why, we don&rsquo;t know the why.</p>
<p>However, for a very long time,</p>
<p>the assumption was that evolution worked</p>
<p>in a progressive upward scale,</p>
<p>that you start off with simple organisms</p>
<p>and those organisms get more complex</p>
<p>and more complex and more complex.</p>
<p>Now, obviously that&rsquo;s true in some like really general way,</p>
<p>right, that life started off as single cell organisms</p>
<p>and things got more complex.</p>
<p>But the idea that brains evolved in some upward trajectory</p>
<p>from simple brains in simple animals</p>
<p>to complex brains in complex animals</p>
<p>is called a phylogenetic scale.</p>
<p>And that phylogenetic scale is embedded</p>
<p>in a lot of evolutionary thinking,</p>
<p>including Darwin&rsquo;s actually.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been seriously challenged, I would say,</p>
<p>by modern evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>And so thinking is something that,</p>
<p>rationality is something that humans,</p>
<p>at least in the West, really prize</p>
<p>as a great human achievement.</p>
<p>And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story</p>
<p>is that brains evolved in like sedimentary rock</p>
<p>with a layer for instincts, that&rsquo;s your lizard brain,</p>
<p>and a layer on top of that for emotions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your limbic system, limbic meaning border.</p>
<p>So it borders the parts that are for instincts.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>And then the neocortex or new cortex</p>
<p>where rationality is supposed to live.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of traditional story.</p>
<p>It just keeps getting layered on top by evolution.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you can think about, I mean,</p>
<p>sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it.</p>
<p>The way I sometimes like to think about it</p>
<p>is thinking about the cerebral cortex</p>
<p>like icing on an already baked cake,</p>
<p>where the cake is your inner beast.</p>
<p>These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions</p>
<p>that have to be contained by the cortex.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a fiction, it&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a myth that you can trace all the way back</p>
<p>to stories about morality in ancient Greece.</p>
<p>But what you can do is look at the scientific record</p>
<p>and say, well, there are other stories</p>
<p>that you could tell about brain evolution</p>
<p>and the context in which brains evolved.</p>
<p>So when you look at creatures who don&rsquo;t have brains</p>
<p>and you look at creatures who do, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>And you can look at some animals.</p>
<p>So we call, scientists call an environment</p>
<p>that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche.</p>
<p>What are the things, what are the parts</p>
<p>of the environment that matter to that animal?</p>
<p>And so there are some animals whose niche</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t changed in 400 million years.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not, these creatures are modern creatures</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re living in a niche that hasn&rsquo;t changed much.</p>
<p>And so their biology hasn&rsquo;t changed much.</p>
<p>And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes</p>
<p>that lurk deep in the molecular structure of cells.</p>
<p>And so you can, by looking at various animals</p>
<p>in their developmental state, meaning not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t look at adult animals,</p>
<p>you look at embryos of animals and developing animals,</p>
<p>you can see, you can piece together a different story.</p>
<p>And that story is that brains evolved</p>
<p>under the selection pressure of hunting.</p>
<p>That in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene</p>
<p>where animals deliberately ate one another.</p>
<p>And what, so before the Cambrian period,</p>
<p>the animals didn&rsquo;t really have,</p>
<p>well, they didn&rsquo;t have brains,</p>
<p>but they also didn&rsquo;t have senses really,</p>
<p>the very, very rudimentary senses.</p>
<p>So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons</p>
<p>is called an amphioxus or a lancelet.</p>
<p>And little amphioxus has no eyes,</p>
<p>it has no ears, it has no nose, it has no eyes.</p>
<p>It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark</p>
<p>for circadian rhythm purposes.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t hear, it has a vestibular cell</p>
<p>to keep its body upright.</p>
<p>It has a very rudimentary sense of touch</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t really have any internal organs</p>
<p>other than this like basically stomach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, just like a,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have an enteric nervous system.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have like a gut that moves like we do.</p>
<p>It just has basically a tube.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a little container, yeah.</p>
<p>And so, and really it doesn&rsquo;t move very much.</p>
<p>It can move, it just sort of wriggles.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have very sophisticated movement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this really sweet little animal.</p>
<p>It sort of wriggles its way to a spot</p>
<p>and then plants itself in the sand</p>
<p>and just filters food as the food goes by.</p>
<p>And then when the food concentration decreases,</p>
<p>it just ejects itself, wriggles to some spot randomly</p>
<p>where probabilistically there will be more food</p>
<p>and plants itself again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really aware,</p>
<p>very aware that it has an environment.</p>
<p>It has a niche, but that niche is very small</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not really experiencing that niche very much.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like a little stomach on a stick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>And, but when animals start to literally hunt each other,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it becomes important</p>
<p>to have, to be able to sense your environment.</p>
<p>Cause you need to know, is that blob up ahead</p>
<p>gonna eat me or should I eat it?</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden you want,</p>
<p>distance senses are very useful.</p>
<p>And so in the water, distance senses are vision</p>
<p>and a little bit hearing.</p>
<p>Olfaction, smelling and touch,</p>
<p>because in the water touch is a distance sense</p>
<p>cause you can feel the vibration, so it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So on land, you know, vision is a distance sense,</p>
<p>touch not so much, but for elephants maybe, right?</p>
<p>The vibrations.</p>
<p>Vibrations, olfaction definitely</p>
<p>because of the distance sense.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very important to have a sense of touch</p>
<p>and olfaction definitely because of the concentration</p>
<p>of, you know, the more concentrated something is,</p>
<p>the more likely it is to be close to you.</p>
<p>So animals developed senses.</p>
<p>They developed a head, like a literal head.</p>
<p>So amphyoxus doesn&rsquo;t even have a head really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a long.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of a head?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Is it to have a jaw?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So jaw, so yes, jaws are a major.</p>
<p>Useful feature.</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously they&rsquo;re a major adaptation</p>
<p>after there&rsquo;s a split between vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>
<p>So amphyoxus is thought to be very, very similar</p>
<p>to the animal that&rsquo;s before that split.</p>
<p>But then after the development,</p>
<p>very quickly after the development of a head</p>
<p>is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing.</p>
<p>And what goes along with that</p>
<p>is the development of a brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, is that just a coincidence</p>
<p>that the thing, the part of our body,</p>
<p>of the mammal, I think, body that we eat with</p>
<p>and attack others with is also the thing</p>
<p>that contains all the majority of the brain type of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, actually the brain goes with the development of a head</p>
<p>and the development of a visual system</p>
<p>and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on.</p>
<p>So your senses are developing</p>
<p>and the other thing that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is that animals are getting bigger</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re, and also their niche is getting bigger.</p>
<p>Well, this is the, just sorry to take a tiny tangent</p>
<p>on the niche thing is it seems like the niche</p>
<p>is getting bigger, but not just bigger,</p>
<p>like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways.</p>
<p>So predation seems to create, the whole world</p>
<p>becomes your oyster, whatever,</p>
<p>but you also start to carve out the places</p>
<p>in which you can operate the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact, that&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind,</p>
<p>your ability to make inferences</p>
<p>about the inner life of other creatures</p>
<p>actually developed under the selection pressure of predation</p>
<p>because it makes you a better predator.</p>
<p>Do you ever look at, you just said you looked at babies</p>
<p>as these wiring creatures.</p>
<p>Do you ever think of humans as just clever predators?</p>
<p>Like that there&rsquo;s, underneath it all is this</p>
<p>the Nietzschean will to power in all of its forms?</p>
<p>Or are we now friendlier?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, there are zeitgeists</p>
<p>in how humans think about themselves, right?</p>
<p>And so if you look in the 20th century,</p>
<p>you can see that the idea of an inner beast</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just predators, we&rsquo;re just basically animals,</p>
<p>baseless animals, violent animals</p>
<p>that have to be contained by culture</p>
<p>and by our prodigious neocortex</p>
<p>really took hold, particularly after World War I,</p>
<p>and really held sway for much of that century.</p>
<p>And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re talking mainly</p>
<p>about Western scientific writing,</p>
<p>Western philosophical writing.</p>
<p>And then, you know, late 90s maybe,</p>
<p>you start to see books and articles</p>
<p>about our social nature, that we&rsquo;re social animals.</p>
<p>And we are social animals,</p>
<p>but what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>And about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s us carving out different niches</p>
<p>in the space of ideas, it looks like.</p>
<p>I think so, I think so.</p>
<p>So, you know, do humans, can humans be violent?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can humans be really helpful?</p>
<p>Yes, actually.</p>
<p>And humans are interesting creatures</p>
<p>because, you know, other animals</p>
<p>can also be helpful to one another.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a whole literature, booming literature</p>
<p>on how other animals support one another.</p>
<p>They regulate each other&rsquo;s nervous systems</p>
<p>in interesting ways,</p>
<p>and they will be helpful to one another, right?</p>
<p>So for example, there&rsquo;s a whole literature on rodents</p>
<p>and how they signal one another what is safe to eat,</p>
<p>and they will perform acts of generosity</p>
<p>to their conspecifics that are related to them,</p>
<p>or who they were raised with.</p>
<p>So if an animal was raised in a litter</p>
<p>that they were raised in,</p>
<p>although not even at the same time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be more likely to help that animal.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always some kind of physical relationship</p>
<p>between animals that predicts</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;ll help one another.</p>
<p>For humans, you know, we have ways of categorizing</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in our group and who isn&rsquo;t by nonphysical ways, right?</p>
<p>Even by just something abstract, like an idea.</p>
<p>And we are much more likely to extend help</p>
<p>to people in our own group,</p>
<p>whatever that group may be at that moment,</p>
<p>whatever feature you&rsquo;re using to do that.</p>
<p>Feature you&rsquo;re using to define who&rsquo;s in your group</p>
<p>and who isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more likely to help those people</p>
<p>than even members of our own family at times.</p>
<p>So humans are much more flexible in their,</p>
<p>in the way that they help one another,</p>
<p>but also in the way that they harm one another.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I subscribe to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I subscribe to, you know,</p>
<p>we are primarily this or we are primarily that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think humans have essences in that way, really.</p>
<p>I apologize to take us in this direction</p>
<p>for a brief moment,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently</p>
<p>in terms of reading.</p>
<p>And is there something that you think about</p>
<p>in terms of the nature of evil</p>
<p>from a neuroscience perspective?</p>
<p>Is there some lessons that are sort of hopeful</p>
<p>about human civilization that we can find in our brain</p>
<p>with regard to the Hitlers of the world?</p>
<p>Do you think about the nature of evil?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that what I have to say is so useful</p>
<p>from a, I don&rsquo;t know that I can say as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s a study that, you know,</p>
<p>so I sort of have to take off my lab coat, right?</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m gonna now conjecture as a human</p>
<p>who just also, who has opinions,</p>
<p>but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not speaking as a neuroscientist when I say this,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t think neuroscientists know enough really</p>
<p>to be able to say,</p>
<p>but I guess the kinds of things I think about are,</p>
<p>what, so I have always thought,</p>
<p>even before I knew anything about neuroscience,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody could become Hitler,</p>
<p>but I think the majority of people can be,</p>
<p>can do, are capable of doing very bad things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, the question is really</p>
<p>how much encouragement does it take from the environment</p>
<p>to get them to do something bad?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I kind of, when I look at the life of Hitler,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s so many places where&hellip;</p>
<p>Something could have intervened.</p>
<p>Intervene, no, it could change completely the person.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like the caricature,</p>
<p>like the obvious places where he was an artist</p>
<p>and if he wasn&rsquo;t rejected as an artist,</p>
<p>he was a reasonably good artist.</p>
<p>So that could have changed,</p>
<p>but just his entire, like where he went in Vienna</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>like little interactions could have changed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s probably millions of other people</p>
<p>who are capable, who the environment may be able to mold</p>
<p>in the same way it did this particular person</p>
<p>to create this particular kind of charismatic leader</p>
<p>in this particular moment of time.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and I guess the way that I would say it,</p>
<p>I would agree 100% and I guess the way that I would say it</p>
<p>is like this, in the West,</p>
<p>we have a way of reasoning about causation,</p>
<p>which focuses on single, simple causes for things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an essence to Hitler,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an essence to his character.</p>
<p>He was born with that essence</p>
<p>or it was forged very, very early in his life</p>
<p>and that explains the horrible landscape of his behavior.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another way to think about it,</p>
<p>a way that actually is much more consistent</p>
<p>with what we know about biology,</p>
<p>how biology works in the physical world.</p>
<p>And that is that most things are complex,</p>
<p>not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard,</p>
<p>but complex as in complexity,</p>
<p>that is more than the sum of their parts</p>
<p>and that most phenomena have many, many</p>
<p>weak nonlinear interacting causes.</p>
<p>And so little things that we might not even be aware of</p>
<p>can shift someone&rsquo;s developmental trajectory</p>
<p>from this to that and that&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>to take it on a whole set of other paths</p>
<p>and that these things are happening all the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not random and it&rsquo;s not really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not deterministic in the sense</p>
<p>that like everything you do determines your outcome,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little more like you&rsquo;re nudging someone</p>
<p>from one set of possibilities</p>
<p>to another set of possibilities.</p>
<p>But I think the thing that I find optimistic</p>
<p>is that the other side of that coin is also true.</p>
<p>So look at all the people who risked their lives</p>
<p>to help people they didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie.</p>
<p>And the thing that I came away with,</p>
<p>but the thing I came away with was,</p>
<p>look at how generous people were in that.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s making, there are a lot of people he makes fun of</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fine, but think about like those two people</p>
<p>two guys, those.</p>
<p>The Trump supporter guys.</p>
<p>Those guys.</p>
<p>That was cool, there was kindness in them, right?</p>
<p>They took a complete stranger in a pandemic</p>
<p>into their house.</p>
<p>Who does that?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a really nice thing.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s one scene, I mean, I don&rsquo;t wanna spoil it</p>
<p>for people who haven&rsquo;t seen it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one scene where he goes in,</p>
<p>he dresses up as a Jew, I laugh myself sick at that scene,</p>
<p>seriously, but he goes in</p>
<p>and there are these two old Jewish ladies.</p>
<p>What a bunch of sweethearts, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Like really, I mean, that was what I was struck by actually.</p>
<p>I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter, right?</p>
<p>I mean, she was really kind.</p>
<p>And yeah, so that&rsquo;s really what I was more struck by.</p>
<p>Like sure, there are other people</p>
<p>who do very bad things or say bad things or whatever,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s one guy who&rsquo;s completely stoic,</p>
<p>like the guy who&rsquo;s sending the messages,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s facts or whatever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just completely stoic,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s doing his job actually.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t know what he was thinking inside his head,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s feeling,</p>
<p>but he was totally professional doing his job.</p>
<p>So I guess I just, I had a bit of a different view, I guess.</p>
<p>So I also think that about people,</p>
<p>I think everybody is capable of kindness,</p>
<p>but the question is how much does it take</p>
<p>and what are the circumstances?</p>
<p>So for some people it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot</p>
<p>and for some people it only takes a little bit,</p>
<p>but are we actually cultivating an environment</p>
<p>for the next generation that provides opportunities</p>
<p>for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness</p>
<p>or, and I&rsquo;m not saying that as like a Pollyanna ish person.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of room for competition</p>
<p>and debate and so on,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see Hitler as an anomaly and I never have,</p>
<p>that was even before I learned anything about neuroscience.</p>
<p>And now I would say knowing what we know</p>
<p>about developmental trajectories and life histories</p>
<p>and how important that is,</p>
<p>knowing what we know about that the whole question</p>
<p>of like nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question.</p>
<p>We have the kind of nature that requires nurture,</p>
<p>we have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born</p>
<p>with unfinished brains where the brains,</p>
<p>their brains are wired across a 25 year period</p>
<p>with wiring instructions from the world</p>
<p>that is created for them.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think Hitler is an anomaly,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s less probable that that would happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that it could happen again</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like, you know, he&rsquo;s a bad seed.</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t, I just wanna say for like,</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s completely 100% responsible for his actions</p>
<p>and all the bad things that happen.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not in any way, this is not me saying.</p>
<p>But the environment is also responsible in part</p>
<p>for creating the evil in this world.</p>
<p>So like Hitler&rsquo;s in different versions of even more subtle,</p>
<p>more smaller scale versions of evil.</p>
<p>But I tend to believe that there&rsquo;s a much stronger,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to talk about evolutionary advantages,</p>
<p>but it seems like it makes sense for love</p>
<p>to be a more powerful emergent phenomena</p>
<p>of our collective intelligence versus hate</p>
<p>and evil and destruction.</p>
<p>Because from a survival, from a niche perspective,</p>
<p>it seems to be like in my own life</p>
<p>and my thinking about the intuition</p>
<p>about the way humans work together to solve problems,</p>
<p>it seems that love is a very useful tool.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you.</p>
<p>But I think the caveat here is that, you know,</p>
<p>humans, the research suggests that humans are capable</p>
<p>of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity</p>
<p>to people in their in group.</p>
<p>Right, so we&rsquo;re also tribal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s the kitschy way to say it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re tribes, we&rsquo;re tribal, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kitschy way to say it.</p>
<p>What I would say is that, you know,</p>
<p>there are a lot of features</p>
<p>that you can use to describe yourself.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have one identity, you don&rsquo;t have one self,</p>
<p>you have many selves, you have many identities.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re a man, sometimes you&rsquo;re a scientist,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re a, do you have a brother or a sister?</p>
<p>Yeah, brother.</p>
<p>So sometimes you&rsquo;re a brother.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes you&rsquo;re a friend.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re a human so you can keep zooming out.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Living organism on Earth.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And so there are some people</p>
<p>who there is research which suggests</p>
<p>that there are some people who will tell you,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s appropriate and better to help.</p>
<p>I should help my family more than I should help my neighbors</p>
<p>and I should help my neighbors more than I should help</p>
<p>the average stranger.</p>
<p>And I should help, you know, the average stranger</p>
<p>in my country more than I should help</p>
<p>somebody outside my country.</p>
<p>And I should help humans more than I should help,</p>
<p>you know, other animals.</p>
<p>And I should, right, so there&rsquo;s a clear hierarchy</p>
<p>of helping and there are other people who, you know,</p>
<p>they are, their niche is much more inclusive, right?</p>
<p>And that they&rsquo;re humans first, right?</p>
<p>Or creatures of the Earth first, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we know how flexible those attitudes are</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think the research really tells us that.</p>
<p>But in any case, there are, you know,</p>
<p>and there are beliefs, people also have beliefs about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this really interesting research in,</p>
<p>really in anthropology that looks at</p>
<p>what are cultures particularly afraid of?</p>
<p>Like what the people in a particular culture</p>
<p>are organizing their social systems</p>
<p>to prevent certain types of problems.</p>
<p>So what are the problems that they&rsquo;re worried about?</p>
<p>And so there are some cultures that are much more</p>
<p>hierarchical and some cultures that are,</p>
<p>you know, much more egalitarian.</p>
<p>There are some cultures that, you know,</p>
<p>in the debate of like getting along versus getting ahead,</p>
<p>there are some cultures that really prioritize</p>
<p>the individual over the group.</p>
<p>And there are other cultures that really prioritize</p>
<p>the group over the individual.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not like one of these is right</p>
<p>and one of these is wrong, it&rsquo;s that, you know,</p>
<p>different combinations of these features</p>
<p>are different solutions that humans have come up with</p>
<p>for living in groups,</p>
<p>which is a major adaptive advantage of our species.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the case that one of these is better</p>
<p>and one of these is worse.</p>
<p>Although as a person, of course, I have opinions about that.</p>
<p>And as a person, I can say,</p>
<p>I would very much prefer certain, I have certain beliefs</p>
<p>and I really want everyone in the world</p>
<p>to live by those beliefs, you know.</p>
<p>But as a scientist, I know that it&rsquo;s not really the case</p>
<p>that for the species,</p>
<p>any one of these is better than any other.</p>
<p>There are different solutions that work differentially well</p>
<p>in particular, you know, ecological parts of the world.</p>
<p>But for individual humans,</p>
<p>there are definitely some systems that are better</p>
<p>and some systems that are worse, right?</p>
<p>But when anthropologists or when neuroscientists</p>
<p>or biologists are talking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not usually talking about the lives</p>
<p>of individual people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about, you know, the species,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s better for the species,</p>
<p>the survivability of the species.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s better for the survivability of the species</p>
<p>is variation,</p>
<p>that we have lots of cultures</p>
<p>with lots of different solutions</p>
<p>because if the environment were to change drastically,</p>
<p>some of those solutions will work better than others.</p>
<p>And you can see that happening with COVID.</p>
<p>Right, so some people might be more susceptible</p>
<p>to this virus than others.</p>
<p>And so variation is very useful.</p>
<p>Say COVID was much, much more destructive than it is.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t know, 20% of the population died.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s good to have variability</p>
<p>because then at least some percent will survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the way that I used to describe it</p>
<p>was, you know, using, you know, those movies</p>
<p>like the War of the Worlds or Pacific Rim,</p>
<p>you know, where like aliens come down from outer space</p>
<p>and they, you know, wanna kill humans.</p>
<p>And so all the humans band together as a species</p>
<p>and they all, like all the, you know,</p>
<p>little squabbling from countries and whatever</p>
<p>all, you know, goes away</p>
<p>and everyone is just one big, you know.</p>
<p>Well, that, you know, that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I mean, cause COVID is, you know,</p>
<p>a virus like COVID 19 is like a creature from outer space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what you see happening.</p>
<p>What you do see happening,</p>
<p>it is true that some people, I mean,</p>
<p>we could use this as an example of essentialism also.</p>
<p>So just to say, like exposure to the virus does not mean</p>
<p>that you will become infected with a disease.</p>
<p>So, I mean, in controlled studies,</p>
<p>one of which was actually a coronavirus, not COVID,</p>
<p>but this was, these are studies from 10 or so years ago,</p>
<p>you know, only somewhere between 20 and 40% of people</p>
<p>were developed respiratory illness</p>
<p>when a virus was placed in their nose.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dose question, all those.</p>
<p>Well, not in these studies, actually.</p>
<p>So in these studies,</p>
<p>the dose was consistent across all people</p>
<p>and everything, you know,</p>
<p>they were sequestered in hotel rooms</p>
<p>and what they ate was, you know,</p>
<p>measured out by scientists and so on.</p>
<p>And so when you hold dose, I mean,</p>
<p>the dose issue is a real issue in the real world,</p>
<p>but in these studies, that was controlled.</p>
<p>And only somewhere between 20,</p>
<p>depending on the study,</p>
<p>between 20 and 40% of people became infected with a disease.</p>
<p>So exposure to a virus doesn&rsquo;t mean de facto</p>
<p>that you will develop an illness.</p>
<p>You will be a carrier</p>
<p>and you will spread the virus to other people,</p>
<p>but you yourself may not,</p>
<p>your immune system may be in a state</p>
<p>that you can make enough antibodies</p>
<p>to not show symptoms, not develop symptoms.</p>
<p>And so, of course, what this means is,</p>
<p>again, is that, you know,</p>
<p>like if I asked you, do you think, you know,</p>
<p>a virus is the cause of a common cold or,</p>
<p>you know, most people, if I asked this question,</p>
<p>I can tell you, because I asked this question.</p>
<p>So do you think a virus is the cause of a cold?</p>
<p>Most people would say, yes, I think it is.</p>
<p>And then I say, yeah, well,</p>
<p>only 20 to 40% of people develop respiratory illness</p>
<p>in exposure to a virus.</p>
<p>So clearly it is a necessary cause,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a sufficient cause.</p>
<p>And there are other causes, again,</p>
<p>so not simple single causes for things, right?</p>
<p>Multiple interacting influences.</p>
<p>So it is true that individuals vary</p>
<p>in their susceptibility to illness upon exposure,</p>
<p>but different cultures have different sets of norms</p>
<p>and practices that allow,</p>
<p>that will slow or speed the spread.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the point that I was actually trying to make here</p>
<p>that, you know, when the environment changes,</p>
<p>that is, there&rsquo;s a mutation of a virus</p>
<p>that is incredibly infectious,</p>
<p>some cultures will succumb,</p>
<p>people in some cultures will succumb faster</p>
<p>because of the particular norms and practices</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve developed in their culture</p>
<p>versus other cultures.</p>
<p>Now, there could be some other, you know,</p>
<p>thing that changes that where those other cultures</p>
<p>or, you know, would do better.</p>
<p>So very individualistic cultures like ours</p>
<p>may do much better under other types of selection pressures.</p>
<p>But for COVID, for things like COVID,</p>
<p>you know, my colleague Michelle Gelfant,</p>
<p>her research shows that she looks at like loose cultures</p>
<p>and tight cultures,</p>
<p>so cultures that have very, very strict rules</p>
<p>versus cultures that are much more individualistic</p>
<p>and where personal freedoms are more valued.</p>
<p>And she, you know, her research suggests that</p>
<p>for pandemic circumstances, tight cultures actually,</p>
<p>the people survive better.</p>
<p>Just to linger a little bit longer,</p>
<p>we started this part of the conversation talking about,</p>
<p>you know, did humans evolve to think,</p>
<p>did the human brain evolve to think,</p>
<p>implying is there like a progress to the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always improving?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we never, yeah,</p>
<p>and so the answer is no.</p>
<p>But let me sort of push back,</p>
<p>but so your intuition is very strong here,</p>
<p>not your intuition, the way you describe this,</p>
<p>but is it possible there&rsquo;s a direction to this evolution?</p>
<p>Like, do you think of this evolution as having a direction?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like walking along a certain path</p>
<p>towards something?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, what is it?</p>
<p>Is it Elon Musk said like the Earth got bombarded</p>
<p>with photons and then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>like a Tesla was launched into space or whatever,</p>
<p>a rocket started coming?</p>
<p>Like, is there a sense in which,</p>
<p>even though in the, like within the system,</p>
<p>the evolution seems to be this mess of variation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of trying to find our niches and so on,</p>
<p>but do you think there, ultimately, when you zoom out,</p>
<p>there is a direction that&rsquo;s strong,</p>
<p>that does tend towards greater complexity and intelligence?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and again, what I would say is I&rsquo;m really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really just echoing people who are much smarter</p>
<p>than I am about this.</p>
<p>But see, you&rsquo;re saying smarter.</p>
<p>I thought it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no smarter.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s no smarter.</p>
<p>I said there&rsquo;s no direction.</p>
<p>So I think the thing to say, or what I understand</p>
<p>to be the case, is that there&rsquo;s variation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unbounded variation.</p>
<p>And there are selectors.</p>
<p>There are pressures that will select.</p>
<p>And so not anything is possible</p>
<p>because we live on a planet</p>
<p>that has certain physical realities to it, right?</p>
<p>But those physical realities</p>
<p>are what constrain the possibilities, the physical realities</p>
<p>of our genes and the physical realities</p>
<p>of our corporeal bodies and the physical realities</p>
<p>of life on this planet.</p>
<p>So what I would say is that there&rsquo;s no direction,</p>
<p>but there is, it&rsquo;s not infinite possibility</p>
<p>because we live on a particular planet</p>
<p>that has particular statistical regularities in it,</p>
<p>and some things will never happen.</p>
<p>And so all of those things are interacting</p>
<p>with our genes and so on,</p>
<p>and the physical nature of our bodies</p>
<p>to make some things more possible</p>
<p>and some things less possible.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, humans have very complex brains,</p>
<p>but birds have complex brains,</p>
<p>and so do octopuses have very complex brains.</p>
<p>And all three sets of all three of those brains</p>
<p>are somewhat different from one another.</p>
<p>Some birds have very complex brains.</p>
<p>Some even have rudimentary language.</p>
<p>They have no cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>I mean, admittedly, they have,</p>
<p>this is now lesson two, right?</p>
<p>They have, is it lesson two or lesson one?</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>No, this is lesson one.</p>
<p>They have the same neurons,</p>
<p>the same neurons that in a human</p>
<p>become the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Birds have those neurons.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t form themselves into a cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>But I mean, crows, for example,</p>
<p>are very sophisticated animals.</p>
<p>They can do a lot of the things that humans can do.</p>
<p>In fact, all of the things that humans do</p>
<p>that are very special, that seem very special,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s at least one other animal on the planet</p>
<p>that can do those things too.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s special about the human brain</p>
<p>is that we put them all together.</p>
<p>So we learn from one another.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to experience everything ourselves.</p>
<p>We can watch another animal or another human</p>
<p>experience something, and we can learn from that.</p>
<p>Well, there are many other animals</p>
<p>who can learn by copying.</p>
<p>That we communicate with each other</p>
<p>very, very efficiently.</p>
<p>We have language.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not the only animals</p>
<p>who are efficient communicators.</p>
<p>There are lots of other animals</p>
<p>who can efficiently communicate, like bees, for example.</p>
<p>We cooperate really well with one another</p>
<p>to do grand things.</p>
<p>But there are other animals that cooperate too.</p>
<p>And so every innovation that we have,</p>
<p>other animals have too.</p>
<p>What we have is we have all of those together</p>
<p>interwoven in this very complex dance</p>
<p>in a brain that is not unique exactly,</p>
<p>but that is, it does have some features</p>
<p>that make it particularly useful for us</p>
<p>to do all of these things,</p>
<p>to have all of these things intertwined.</p>
<p>So our brains are, actually the last time we talked,</p>
<p>I made a mistake because I said in my enthusiasm,</p>
<p>I said, you know, our brains are not larger,</p>
<p>or relative to our bodies,</p>
<p>our brains are not larger than other primates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not true, actually.</p>
<p>Our brains relative to our body size is somewhat larger.</p>
<p>So an ape who&rsquo;s not a human, that&rsquo;s not a human,</p>
<p>their brains are larger than their body sizes</p>
<p>than say, relative to like a smaller monkey.</p>
<p>And a human&rsquo;s brain is larger relative to its body size</p>
<p>than a gorilla.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good approximation of your, of whatever,</p>
<p>of the bunch of stuff that you can shove in there.</p>
<p>But, well, what I was gonna say is,</p>
<p>but our cerebral cortex is not larger</p>
<p>than what you would expect for a brain of its size.</p>
<p>So relative to say an ape, like a gorilla or a chimp,</p>
<p>or even a mammal like a dolphin or an elephant, you know,</p>
<p>our brains, our cerebral cortex is as large</p>
<p>as you would expect it to be for a brain of our size.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing special about our cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>And this is something I explain in the book,</p>
<p>where I say, okay, you know, like by analogy,</p>
<p>if you walk into somebody&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and you see that they have a huge kitchen,</p>
<p>you might think, well, maybe this is a place</p>
<p>I really definitely wanna eat dinner at</p>
<p>because these people must be gourmet cooks.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about what the size of their kitchen means</p>
<p>unless you consider it in relation</p>
<p>to the size of the rest of the house.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a big kitchen in a really big house,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not telling you anything special, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a big kitchen in a small house,</p>
<p>then that might be a place that you wanna eat for,</p>
<p>you wanna stay for dinner because it&rsquo;s more likely</p>
<p>that that kitchen is large for a special reason.</p>
<p>And so the cerebral cortex of a human brain</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t in and of itself special because of its size.</p>
<p>However, there are some genetic changes</p>
<p>that have happened in the human brain as it&rsquo;s grown</p>
<p>to whatever size is typical for the whole brain size, right?</p>
<p>There are some changes that do give the human brain</p>
<p>slightly more of some capacities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not special, but we can do some things</p>
<p>much better than other animals.</p>
<p>And correspondingly, other animals can do some things</p>
<p>much better than we can.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t grow back limbs,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t lift 50 times our own body weight.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, maybe you can,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t lift 50 times my own body weight.</p>
<p>Ants with that regard are very impressive.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying with the frontal cortex,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the size is not always the right measure</p>
<p>of capability, I guess.</p>
<p>So size isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>Size isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a quoted book.</p>
<p>People like it when I disagree,</p>
<p>so let me disagree with you on something</p>
<p>or just like play devil&rsquo;s advocate a little bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve painted a really nice picture</p>
<p>that evolution doesn&rsquo;t have a direction, but is it possible</p>
<p>if we just ran Earth over and over again,</p>
<p>like this video game,</p>
<p>that the final result will be the same.</p>
<p>So in the sense that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>eventually there&rsquo;ll be an AGI type,</p>
<p>HAL 9000 type system that just like flies</p>
<p>and colonizes nearby Earth like planets.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always will be the same.</p>
<p>And the different organisms</p>
<p>and the different evolution of the brain,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it has like a direction,</p>
<p>but given the constraints of Earth</p>
<p>and whatever this imperative,</p>
<p>whatever the hell is running this universe,</p>
<p>like it seems like it&rsquo;s running towards something,</p>
<p>is it possible that it will always be the same?</p>
<p>Thereby it will be a direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think as you know better than anyone else</p>
<p>that the answer to that question is,</p>
<p>of course there&rsquo;s some probability that could happen, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a yes or no answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the probability that that would happen?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole distribution of possibilities.</p>
<p>So maybe we end up, what&rsquo;s the probability we end up</p>
<p>with exactly the same compliment of creatures,</p>
<p>including us?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the likelihood that we end up with</p>
<p>creatures that are similar to humans,</p>
<p>but similar in certain ways, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>but not exactly humans or all the way</p>
<p>to a completely different distribution of creatures.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the intuition?</p>
<p>Like if you were to bet money,</p>
<p>what does that distribution look like</p>
<p>if we ran Earth over and over and over again?</p>
<p>I would say given the, you&rsquo;re now asking me questions that.</p>
<p>This is not science.</p>
<p>But I would say, okay, well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the probability that it&rsquo;s gonna be a carbon life form?</p>
<p>Probably high.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know anything about really.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not really well versed that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the probability that,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s the probability that the animals will begin</p>
<p>in the ocean and crawl out onto land?</p>
<p>Versus the other way.</p>
<p>Versus the, I would say probably high.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, but do I think what&rsquo;s the likelihood</p>
<p>that we would end up with exactly the same or very similar?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s low actually.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s low, but I would say it&rsquo;s not 100%.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;s 50%.</p>
<p>You know, I would say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re here by accident</p>
<p>because I think, like I said, there are constraints.</p>
<p>Like there are some physical constraints about Earth.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if you were a cosmologist,</p>
<p>you could say, well, the fact that the Earth is,</p>
<p>if you were to do the Big Bang over again</p>
<p>and keep doing it over and over and over again,</p>
<p>would you still get the same solar systems?</p>
<p>Would you still get the same planets?</p>
<p>Would, you know, would you still get the same galaxies,</p>
<p>the same solar systems, the same planets?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know, but my guess is probably not</p>
<p>because there are random things that happen</p>
<p>that can, again, send things in one direct, you know,</p>
<p>make one set of trajectories possible</p>
<p>and another set impossible.</p>
<p>So, but I guess my, if I were gonna bet money</p>
<p>or something valuable, I would probably say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not zero and it&rsquo;s not 100%</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably not even 50%.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some probability, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That it will be similar.</p>
<p>That it will be similar, but I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I just think there are too many degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>There are too many degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the real tensions in writing this book</p>
<p>is to, on the one hand, there&rsquo;s some truth in saying</p>
<p>that humans are not special.</p>
<p>We are just, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not special in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>All animals are well adapted.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re survived, they&rsquo;re well adapted to their niche.</p>
<p>It does happen to be the case that our niche is large.</p>
<p>For any individual human, your niche is whatever it is.</p>
<p>But for the species, right?</p>
<p>We live almost everywhere, not everywhere,</p>
<p>but almost everywhere on the planet, but not in the ocean.</p>
<p>And actually other animals like bacteria, for example,</p>
<p>have us beat miles, you know, hands down, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, by any definition,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not special.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, you know, adapted to our environment.</p>
<p>But bacteria don&rsquo;t have a podcast.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the other, so that&rsquo;s the tension, right?</p>
<p>So on the one hand, you know, we&rsquo;re not special animals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, you know,</p>
<p>particularly well adapted to our niche.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our niche is huge.</p>
<p>And we, you know, we don&rsquo;t just adapt to our environment.</p>
<p>We add to our environment.</p>
<p>We make stuff up, give it a name,</p>
<p>and then it becomes real.</p>
<p>And so no other animal can do that.</p>
<p>And so I think the thing,</p>
<p>the way to think about it from my perspective</p>
<p>or the way I made sense of it is to say,</p>
<p>you can look at any individual single characteristic</p>
<p>that a human has that seems remarkable.</p>
<p>And you can find that in some other animal.</p>
<p>What you can&rsquo;t find in any other animal</p>
<p>is all of those characteristics together</p>
<p>in a brain that is souped up in particular ways,</p>
<p>like ours is.</p>
<p>And if you combine these things,</p>
<p>multiple interacting causes, right?</p>
<p>Not one essence, like your cortex, your big neocortex,</p>
<p>but which isn&rsquo;t really that big.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just big for your big brain,</p>
<p>for the size of your big brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the size it should be.</p>
<p>If you add all those things together</p>
<p>and they interact with each other,</p>
<p>that produces some pretty remarkable results.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re aware of that,</p>
<p>then you can start asking different kinds of questions</p>
<p>about what it means to be human</p>
<p>and what kind of a human you wanna be</p>
<p>and what kind of a world do you wanna curate</p>
<p>for the next generation of humans.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the goal anyways, right?</p>
<p>Is just to have a glimpse of,</p>
<p>instead of thinking about things in a simple linear way,</p>
<p>just to have a glimpse of some of the things that matter,</p>
<p>that evidence suggests matters</p>
<p>to the kind of brain in the kind of bodies that we have.</p>
<p>Once you know that, you can work with it a little bit.</p>
<p>You write, words have power over your biology.</p>
<p>Right now, I can text the words,</p>
<p>I love you from the United States</p>
<p>to my close friend in Belgium.</p>
<p>And even though she cannot hear my voice or see my face,</p>
<p>I will change her heart rate, her breathing</p>
<p>and her metabolism.</p>
<p>By the way, beautifully written.</p>
<p>Or someone could text something ambiguous to you,</p>
<p>like, is your door locked?</p>
<p>And odds are that it would affect your nervous system</p>
<p>in an unpleasant way.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to talk about here,</p>
<p>but just one way to ask is,</p>
<p>why do you think words have so much power over our brain?</p>
<p>Well, I think we just have to look at the anatomy</p>
<p>of the brain to answer that question.</p>
<p>So, if you look at the parts of the brain,</p>
<p>the systems that are important for processing language,</p>
<p>you can see that some of these regions</p>
<p>are also important for controlling</p>
<p>your major organ systems.</p>
<p>And like your autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>that controls your cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>your respiratory system, and so on.</p>
<p>That these regions control your endocrine system,</p>
<p>your immune system, and so on.</p>
<p>So, and you can actually see this in other animals too.</p>
<p>So in birds, for example,</p>
<p>the neurons that are responsible for birdsong</p>
<p>also control the systems of a bird&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>And the reason why I bring that up is that the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some scientists think that the anatomy</p>
<p>of a bird&rsquo;s brain that control birdsong</p>
<p>are homologous or structurally have a similar origin</p>
<p>to the human system for language.</p>
<p>So, the parts of the brain that are important</p>
<p>for processing language are not unique</p>
<p>in, and specialized for language.</p>
<p>They do many things.</p>
<p>And one of the things they do is control</p>
<p>your major organ systems.</p>
<p>Do you think we can fall in love,</p>
<p>I have arguments about this all the time.</p>
<p>Do you think we can fall in love based on words alone?</p>
<p>Well, I think people have been doing it for centuries.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it used to be the case</p>
<p>that people wrote letters to each other,</p>
<p>you know, and then that was how they communicated.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s how you and Dan got it.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So is the answer a clear yes there?</p>
<p>Because I get a lot of pushback from people often</p>
<p>that you need the touch and the smell</p>
<p>and, you know, the bodily stuff.</p>
<p>I think the touch and the smell and the bodily stuff helps.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>Do you think you can have a lifelong monogamous relationship</p>
<p>with an AI system that only communicates</p>
<p>with you on text, romantic relationship?</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s an empirical question</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been answered yet.</p>
<p>But I guess what I would say is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could.</p>
<p>Could any human?</p>
<p>Could the average human?</p>
<p>Could, you know, so if I,</p>
<p>if I even, I wanna even modify that and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking now of Tom Hanks and the movie.</p>
<p>Castaway?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, with Wilson.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think if that was, if you had to make that work,</p>
<p>if you had to make that work.</p>
<p>With a volleyball, yeah.</p>
<p>If you had to make it work, could you,</p>
<p>could you, prediction and simulation, right?</p>
<p>So if you had to make it work, could you make it work?</p>
<p>Using simulation and, you know, your past experience,</p>
<p>could you make it work?</p>
<p>Could you make it work?</p>
<p>You as a human, could you, could you like?</p>
<p>Could you have a relationship literally</p>
<p>with an inanimate object and have it sustain you</p>
<p>in the way that another human could?</p>
<p>Your life would probably be shorter</p>
<p>because you wouldn&rsquo;t actually derive</p>
<p>the body budgeting benefits from, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about, you know, how your brain,</p>
<p>its most important job is to control your body</p>
<p>and you can describe that as your brain running a budget</p>
<p>for your body and there are metaphorical, you know,</p>
<p>deposits and withdrawals into your body budget</p>
<p>and you also make deposits and withdrawals</p>
<p>in other people&rsquo;s body budgets, figuratively speaking.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t have that particular benefit.</p>
<p>So your life would probably be shorter</p>
<p>but I think it would be harder for some people</p>
<p>than for other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to, my intuition is that you can have</p>
<p>a deep fulfilling relationship with a volleyball.</p>
<p>I think, I think a lot of the, the environments</p>
<p>that set up, I think that&rsquo;s a really good example.</p>
<p>Like the constraints of your particular environment</p>
<p>define the, like I believe like scarcity is a good catalyst</p>
<p>for deep, meaningful connection with other humans</p>
<p>and with inanimate objects.</p>
<p>So the less you have, the more fulfilling</p>
<p>those relationships are.</p>
<p>And I would say a relationship with a volleyball,</p>
<p>the sex is not great but everything else,</p>
<p>I feel like it could be a very fulfilling relationship</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>what to do with that.</p>
<p>And just like you said, it is an empirical question but.</p>
<p>But there are places to learn about that, right?</p>
<p>So for example, think about children and their blankets.</p>
<p>Right, so there, there&rsquo;s something tactile</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something olfactory and it&rsquo;s very comforting.</p>
<p>I mean, even for, even for nonhuman little animals, right?</p>
<p>Like puppies and so I don&rsquo;t know about cats but, but.</p>
<p>Cats are cold hearted, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing going on there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there are some cats that are very doglike.</p>
<p>I mean, really, so.</p>
<p>Some cats identify as dogs, yes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true, yeah, they&rsquo;re species fluid.</p>
<p>So you also write, when it comes to human minds,</p>
<p>variation is the norm.</p>
<p>And what we call quote, human nature</p>
<p>is really many human natures.</p>
<p>So again, many questions I can ask here.</p>
<p>But maybe an interesting one to ask is I often hear,</p>
<p>we often hear this idea of be yourself.</p>
<p>Is this possible to be yourself?</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to strive to be yourself?</p>
<p>Is it, does that even have any meaning?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very Western question, first of all,</p>
<p>because which self are you talking about?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have one self.</p>
<p>There is no self that&rsquo;s an essence of you.</p>
<p>You have multiple selves.</p>
<p>Actually, there is research on this.</p>
<p>To quote the great social psychologist, Hazel Marcus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never, you cannot be a self by yourself.</p>
<p>And so different contexts pull for</p>
<p>or draw on different features of who you are</p>
<p>or what you believe, what you feel, what your actions are.</p>
<p>A different context will put certain things,</p>
<p>make some features be more in the foreground</p>
<p>and some in the background.</p>
<p>It takes us back right to our discussion earlier</p>
<p>about Stalin and Hitler and so on.</p>
<p>The thing that I would caution,</p>
<p>in addition to the fact that there is no single self,</p>
<p>that you have multiple selves, who you can be,</p>
<p>and you can certainly choose the situations</p>
<p>that you put yourself in to some extent.</p>
<p>Not everybody has complete choice,</p>
<p>but everybody has a little bit of choice.</p>
<p>And I think I said this to you before,</p>
<p>that one of the pieces of advice that we gave Sophia</p>
<p>when she went, our daughter,</p>
<p>when she was going off to college,</p>
<p>was try to spend time around people,</p>
<p>choose relationships that allow you to be your best self.</p>
<p>We should have said your best selves, but, you know.</p>
<p>The pool of selves given the environment.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the one thing I do wanna say</p>
<p>is that the risk of saying be yourself, just be yourself,</p>
<p>is that that can be used as an excuse.</p>
<p>Well, this is just the way that I am, I&rsquo;m just like this.</p>
<p>And that, I think, should be tremendously resisted.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one, that&rsquo;s for the excuse side,</p>
<p>but, you know, I&rsquo;m really self critical often,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m full of doubt, and people often tell me,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t worry about it, just be yourself, man.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, the thing is, it almost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>does not seem like actionable advice.</p>
<p>Because, I guess, constantly worrying about who,</p>
<p>what are the right words to say</p>
<p>to express how I&rsquo;m feeling is, I guess, myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of line, I guess,</p>
<p>that this might be a Western idea,</p>
<p>but something that feels genuine</p>
<p>and something that feels non genuine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure what that means,</p>
<p>because I would like to be fully genuine and fully open,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also aware, like this morning,</p>
<p>I was very silly and giddy, I was like,</p>
<p>this is just being funny and relaxed and light,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s nothing that could bother me in the world,</p>
<p>I was just smiling and happy.</p>
<p>And then I remember last night,</p>
<p>was just feeling very grumpy,</p>
<p>like stuff was bothering me.</p>
<p>Like certain things were bothering me.</p>
<p>And like, what are those?</p>
<p>Are those different selves?</p>
<p>Like what, who am I in that?</p>
<p>And what do I do?</p>
<p>Because if we take Twitter as an example,</p>
<p>if I actually send a tweet last night</p>
<p>and a tweet this morning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be very two different people tweeting that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that,</p>
<p>because one does seem to be more me than the other,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s maybe because there&rsquo;s a story that I&rsquo;m trying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m striving to be,</p>
<p>like the ultimate human that I might become,</p>
<p>I have maybe a vision of that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to become that.</p>
<p>But it does seem like there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different minds in there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all like having a discussion</p>
<p>and a battle for who&rsquo;s gonna win.</p>
<p>I suppose you could think of it that way,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another way to think of it, I think,</p>
<p>and that is that maybe the more Buddhist way to think of it,</p>
<p>right, or a more contemplative way to think about it,</p>
<p>which is not that you have multiple personalities</p>
<p>inside your head, but you have,</p>
<p>your brain has this amazing capacity.</p>
<p>It has a population of experiences that you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>that it can regenerate, reconstitute.</p>
<p>And it can even take bits and pieces of those experiences</p>
<p>and combine them into something new.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s often doing this to predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next and to plan your actions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also happening, this also happens just,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what mind wandering is,</p>
<p>or just internal thought and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same mechanism, really.</p>
<p>And so a lot of times we hear the saying,</p>
<p>just think, if you think differently,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel differently.</p>
<p>But your brain is having a conversation continually</p>
<p>with your body, and your body,</p>
<p>your brain&rsquo;s trying to control your body,</p>
<p>well, trying, your brain is controlling your body,</p>
<p>your body is sending information back to the brain,</p>
<p>and in part, the information that your body sends back</p>
<p>to your brain, just like the information</p>
<p>coming from the world, initiates the next volley</p>
<p>of predictions or simulations.</p>
<p>So in some ways, you could also say,</p>
<p>the way that you feel, I think we talked before</p>
<p>about affective feeling or mood,</p>
<p>coming from the sensations of body budgeting,</p>
<p>influences what you think.</p>
<p>And as much as, so feelings influence thought,</p>
<p>as much as thought influence feeling, and maybe more.</p>
<p>But just the whole thing doesn&rsquo;t seem stable.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a dynamic system, Mr. Engineer, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic, it&rsquo;s a dynamical system, right?</p>
<p>Nonlinear dynamical system.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m actually writing a paper</p>
<p>with a bunch of engineers about this actually.</p>
<p>But I mean, other people have talked about the brain</p>
<p>as a dynamical system before,</p>
<p>but the real tricky bit is trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do you get mental features out of that system?</p>
<p>I guess one thing to figure out how you get</p>
<p>a motor movement out of that system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another thing to figure out</p>
<p>how you get a mental feature,</p>
<p>like a feeling of being loved</p>
<p>or a feeling of being worthwhile,</p>
<p>or a feeling of just basically feeling like shit.</p>
<p>How do you get a feeling,</p>
<p>a mental features out of that system?</p>
<p>So what I would say is that you aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the Buddhist thing to say is that you&rsquo;re not one person</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not many people.</p>
<p>You are the sum of your experiences</p>
<p>and who you are in any given moment,</p>
<p>meaning what your actions will be,</p>
<p>is influenced by the state of your body</p>
<p>and the state of the world that you&rsquo;ve put yourself in.</p>
<p>And you can change either of those things.</p>
<p>One is a little easier to change than the other, right?</p>
<p>You can change your environment</p>
<p>by literally getting up and moving,</p>
<p>or you can change it by paying attention</p>
<p>to some things differently</p>
<p>and letting some features come to the fore</p>
<p>and other features be backgrounded.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m looking around your place.</p>
<p>Oh no, this is not something you should do.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m gonna say one thing.</p>
<p>No green plants, no green plants.</p>
<p>Because green plants mean a home</p>
<p>and I want this to be temporary.</p>
<p>Fair, fair, but.</p>
<p>What goes to your mind when you see no green plants?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just making the point that what if you,</p>
<p>again, not everybody has control over their environment.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have control over the noise</p>
<p>or the temperature or any of those things.</p>
<p>But everybody has a little bit of control</p>
<p>and you can place things in your environment,</p>
<p>photographs, plants, anything that&rsquo;s meaningful to you</p>
<p>and use it as a shift of environment when you need it.</p>
<p>You can also do things to change</p>
<p>the conditions of your body.</p>
<p>When you exercise every day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making an investment in your body.</p>
<p>Actually, you&rsquo;re making an investment in your brain too.</p>
<p>It makes you, even though it&rsquo;s unpleasant</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a cost to it, if you replenish,</p>
<p>if you invest and you make up that,</p>
<p>you make a deposit and you make up what you&rsquo;ve spent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically making an investment</p>
<p>in making it easier for your brain</p>
<p>to control your body in the future.</p>
<p>So you can make sure you&rsquo;re hydrated.</p>
<p>Drink water.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to drink bottled water.</p>
<p>You can drink water from the tap.</p>
<p>This is in most places, maybe not everywhere,</p>
<p>but most places in the developed world.</p>
<p>You can try to get enough sleep.</p>
<p>Not everybody has that luxury,</p>
<p>but everybody can do something to make their body budgets</p>
<p>a little more solvent.</p>
<p>And that will also make it more likely</p>
<p>that certain thoughts will emerge</p>
<p>from that prediction machine, basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the control you do have,</p>
<p>is being able to control the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really well put.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve talked about this,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go to the biggest unanswerable questions</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>What is, you just rolled your eyes.</p>
<p>I did, that was my, yeah.</p>
<p>So what is consciousness from a neuroscience perspective?</p>
<p>I know you, I mean.</p>
<p>I made notes, you know,</p>
<p>because you gave me some questions in advance</p>
<p>and I made notes for every single.</p>
<p>Oh, except that one?</p>
<p>Yeah, well that one I had, what the fuck?</p>
<p>And then I took it out.</p>
<p>So is there something interesting,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so pragmatic.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say about intuition</p>
<p>building about consciousness?</p>
<p>Or is this something that we&rsquo;re just totally clueless about</p>
<p>that this is, let&rsquo;s focus on the body,</p>
<p>the brain listens to the body,</p>
<p>the body speaks to the brain,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just figure this piece out,</p>
<p>and then consciousness will probably emerge somehow</p>
<p>after that.</p>
<p>No, I think, you know, well, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say up front,</p>
<p>I am not a philosopher of consciousness</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist who focuses on consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense, I do study it</p>
<p>because I study affect and mood.</p>
<p>And that is the,</p>
<p>you know, to use the phrase,</p>
<p>that is the hard question of consciousness.</p>
<p>How is it that your brain is modeling your body?</p>
<p>Brain is modeling the sensory conditions of your body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being updated,</p>
<p>that model is being updated by the sense data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from your body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s happening continuously your whole life.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t feel those sensations directly.</p>
<p>What you feel is a general sense of pleasantness</p>
<p>or unpleasantness, comfort, discomfort,</p>
<p>feeling worked up, feeling calm.</p>
<p>So we call that affect, you know, most people call it mood.</p>
<p>So how is it that your brain gives you</p>
<p>this very low dimensional feeling of mood or affect</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s presumably receiving</p>
<p>a very high dimensional array of sense data?</p>
<p>And the model that the brain is running of the body</p>
<p>has to be high dimensional</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot going on in there, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not aware, but as you&rsquo;re sitting there quietly,</p>
<p>as your listeners or as our viewers are sitting.</p>
<p>They might be working out, running now,</p>
<p>or as many of them write to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re laying in bed, smoking weed</p>
<p>with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair, so maybe we should say that bit again then.</p>
<p>So if, so some people may be working out,</p>
<p>some people may be, you know, relaxing.</p>
<p>But you know, even if you&rsquo;re sitting very still</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re watching this or listening to this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole drama going on inside your body</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re largely unaware of.</p>
<p>Yet your brain makes you aware</p>
<p>or gives you a status report in a sense</p>
<p>by virtue of these mental features</p>
<p>of feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant,</p>
<p>feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable,</p>
<p>feeling energetic, feeling tired and so on.</p>
<p>And so how the hell is it doing that?</p>
<p>That is the basic question of consciousness.</p>
<p>And like the status reports seem to be,</p>
<p>in the way we experience them, seem to be quite simple.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of data.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So when you feel, when you feel discomfort,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeling basically like shit,</p>
<p>you feel like shit, what does that tell you?</p>
<p>Like, what are you supposed to do next?</p>
<p>What caused it?</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is not one thing caused it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s multiple factors probably influencing</p>
<p>your physical state.</p>
<p>Your body budget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very high dimensional, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very high dimensional.</p>
<p>And there are different temporal scales of influence, right?</p>
<p>So the state of your gut is not just influenced</p>
<p>by what you ate five minutes ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what you ate a day ago and two days ago</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So I think the, you know,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not trying to weasel out of the question,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s the hardest question actually.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever understand it as scientists?</p>
<p>I think that we will understand it</p>
<p>as well as we understand other things</p>
<p>like the birth of the universe or the, you know,</p>
<p>the nature of the universe, I guess I would say.</p>
<p>So do I think we can get to that level of an explanation?</p>
<p>I do actually, but I think that we have to start asking</p>
<p>somewhat different questions and approaching the science</p>
<p>somewhat differently than we have in the past.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s also possible that consciousness</p>
<p>is much more difficult to understand</p>
<p>than the nature of the universe.</p>
<p>It is, but I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily saying</p>
<p>that it was a question that was of equivalent complexity.</p>
<p>I was saying that I do think that we could get</p>
<p>to some, I am optimistic that I would not,</p>
<p>I would be very willing to invest the time,</p>
<p>my time on this earth as a scientist</p>
<p>in trying to answer that question</p>
<p>if I could do it the way that I wanna do it,</p>
<p>not in the way that it&rsquo;s currently being done.</p>
<p>So like rigorously?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say unrigorously.</p>
<p>I just wanna say that there are certain set of assumptions</p>
<p>that, you know, scientists have</p>
<p>what I would call ontological commitments.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re commitments about the way the world is</p>
<p>or the way that nature is.</p>
<p>And these commitments lead scientists sometimes blindly</p>
<p>without, they don&rsquo;t, scientists sometimes,</p>
<p>sometimes scientists are aware of these commitments,</p>
<p>but sometimes they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And these commitments on the list influence</p>
<p>how scientists ask questions, what they measure,</p>
<p>how they measure, and I just have very different views</p>
<p>than a lot of my colleagues about the ways to approach this.</p>
<p>Not everybody, but the way that I would approach it</p>
<p>would be different and it would cost more</p>
<p>and it would take longer.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fit very well</p>
<p>into the current incentive structure of science.</p>
<p>And so do I think that doing science</p>
<p>the way science is currently done</p>
<p>with the budget that it currently has</p>
<p>and the incentive structure that it currently has</p>
<p>will we have an answer?</p>
<p>No, I think absolutely not.</p>
<p>Good luck is what I would say.</p>
<p>People love book recommendations.</p>
<p>Let me ask what three books.</p>
<p>Oh, you can&rsquo;t just like, you can&rsquo;t just give me three.</p>
<p>I mean, like really three?</p>
<p>What seven and a half books you can recommend.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re also the author of seven and a half lessons</p>
<p>about the brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a author of how emotions are made.</p>
<p>Okay, so definitely those are the top two recommendations</p>
<p>of all, the two greatest books of all time.</p>
<p>Other than that, are there books that technical,</p>
<p>fiction, philosophical that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed</p>
<p>or you might recommend to others?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, you know, every PhD student</p>
<p>when they graduate with their PhD,</p>
<p>I give them a set, like a little library,</p>
<p>like a set of books, you know,</p>
<p>some of which they&rsquo;ve already read,</p>
<p>some of which I want them to read or,</p>
<p>but I think nonfiction books, I would read,</p>
<p>the things I would recommend are The Triple Helix</p>
<p>by Richard Lewontin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little book published in 2000,</p>
<p>which is, I think, a really good introduction</p>
<p>to complexity and population thinking</p>
<p>as opposed to essentialism.</p>
<p>So this idea, essentialism is this idea</p>
<p>that, you know, there&rsquo;s an essence to each person,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a soul or your genes or what have you,</p>
<p>as opposed to this idea that you,</p>
<p>we have the kind of nature that requires a nurture.</p>
<p>We are, we are, you are the product of a complex dance</p>
<p>between an environment, between a set of genes</p>
<p>and an environment that turns those genes on and off</p>
<p>to produce your brain and your body</p>
<p>and really who you are at any given moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good title for that, Triple Helix.</p>
<p>So playing on the double helix where it&rsquo;s just the biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bigger than the biology.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read it probably six or seven times</p>
<p>throughout the year.</p>
<p>He has another book too, which is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more, I think scientists would find it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve loved it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Biology as Ideology.</p>
<p>And it really is all about,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it one of the best books of all time,</p>
<p>but I love the book because it really does point out,</p>
<p>you know, that science is its currently practice.</p>
<p>I mean, the book was written in 1991,</p>
<p>but it actually, I think, still holds,</p>
<p>that science is a currently practice,</p>
<p>has a set of ontological commitments,</p>
<p>which are somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>So the assumptions are limiting.</p>
<p>Yeah, in ways that you, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re a fish in water and you don&rsquo;t, like,</p>
<p>okay, so, yeah, so here&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace, that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, you know, but here&rsquo;s a really cool thing</p>
<p>I just learned recently.</p>
<p>Is it okay to go off on this tangent for a minute?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, let&rsquo;s go tangents, great.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say that I just learned recently</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have water receptors on our skin.</p>
<p>So how do you know when you&rsquo;re sweating?</p>
<p>How do you know when a raindrop,</p>
<p>when, you know, when it&rsquo;s gonna rain and, you know,</p>
<p>like a raindrop hits your skin</p>
<p>and you can feel that little drop of wetness.</p>
<p>How is it that you feel that drop of wetness</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t have water receptors in our skin?</p>
<p>And I was, when I.</p>
<p>My mind&rsquo;s blown already.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, I have my reaction too, right?</p>
<p>I was like, of course we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because we evolved in the water.</p>
<p>Like, why would we need, you know, it just,</p>
<p>it was just this like, you know, you have these moments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, oh, of course, there&rsquo;s like a, yeah, so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never see rain the same way again.</p>
<p>So the answer is it&rsquo;s a combination of temperature</p>
<p>and touch, but it&rsquo;s a complex sense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only computed in your brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no receptor for it.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why like snow versus cold rain</p>
<p>versus warm rain all feel different</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to infer stuff from the temperature</p>
<p>and the size of the droplets is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, your brain is a prediction machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using lots and lots of information and combining it.</p>
<p>You know, anyway, so.</p>
<p>But so biology is ideology is,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s one of the greatest books of all time,</p>
<p>but it is a really useful book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book by,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in psychology or the mind at all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful book, a little,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fairly small book called Naming the Mind</p>
<p>by Kurt Danziger, who&rsquo;s a historian of psychology.</p>
<p>Everybody in my lab reads both of these books.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the book?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the origin of the,</p>
<p>where did we get the theory of mind that we have</p>
<p>that the human mind is populated by thoughts and feelings</p>
<p>and perceptions and where did those categories come from?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t exist in all cultures.</p>
<p>Oh, so this isn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a cultural construct?</p>
<p>The idea that you have thoughts and feelings</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very distinct is definitely a cultural construct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another mind blowing thing, just like the rain.</p>
<p>So Kurt Danziger is a,</p>
<p>the opening chapter in that book</p>
<p>is absolutely mind blowing.</p>
<p>I love it, I love it.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And I would say that there are many,</p>
<p>many popular science books that I could recommend</p>
<p>that I think are extremely well written in their own way.</p>
<p>You know, before I, maybe I said this to you,</p>
<p>but before I undertook writing How Emotions Are Made,</p>
<p>I read, I don&rsquo;t know, somewhere on the order of 50 or 60</p>
<p>popular science books to try to figure out</p>
<p>how to write a popular science book.</p>
<p>Because while there are many books about writing,</p>
<p>Stephen King has a great book about writing.</p>
<p>And, you know, where he gives tips</p>
<p>interlaced with his own personal history.</p>
<p>That was where I learned you write for a specific person.</p>
<p>You have a specific person in mind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, for me, that person is Dan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a whole nother conversation</p>
<p>to have like which popular science books,</p>
<p>like what you learned from that search.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s, I have some,</p>
<p>for me, some popular science books</p>
<p>that like I just roll my eyes, like this is too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same with TED Talks.</p>
<p>Like some of them go too much into the flowery</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t, I would say don&rsquo;t give enough respect</p>
<p>to the intelligence of the reader.</p>
<p>And, but that&rsquo;s, this is my own bias very specifically.</p>
<p>I completely agree with you.</p>
<p>And in fact, I have a colleague, his name is Van Yang,</p>
<p>who, you know, he produced a cinematic lecture</p>
<p>of how emotions are made that we wrote together</p>
<p>with Joseph Fridman, no relation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re all related.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you and I are probably,</p>
<p>you know, have some, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the memories are in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s from many, many, many generations ago.</p>
<p>Well, half my family is Russian, so from.</p>
<p>The good half.</p>
<p>The good half, right.</p>
<p>But, you know, he, his goal actually is to produce,</p>
<p>you know, videos and lectures</p>
<p>that are beautiful and educational</p>
<p>and that don&rsquo;t dumb the material down.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s really remarkable at it actually.</p>
<p>I mean, just, but again, you know,</p>
<p>that requires a bit of a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>We could have a whole conversation</p>
<p>about the split between entertainment</p>
<p>and education in this country</p>
<p>and why it is the way it is,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another conversation.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
<p>But I would say if I were to pick one book</p>
<p>that I think is a really good example</p>
<p>of good science writing, it would be The Beak of the Finch.</p>
<p>Which won a Pulitzer Prize a number of years ago.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not remembering the author&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blanking.</p>
<p>But the, I&rsquo;m guessing, is it focusing on birds</p>
<p>and the evolution of birds?</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s also The Evolution of Beauty,</p>
<p>which is, yeah, which is also a great book.</p>
<p>But no, The Beak of the Finch is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it has two storylines that are interwoven.</p>
<p>One is about Darwin and Darwin&rsquo;s explorations</p>
<p>in the Galapagos Island.</p>
<p>And then modern day researchers from Princeton</p>
<p>who have a research program in the Galapagos</p>
<p>looking at Darwin&rsquo;s finches.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a really, first of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s top notch science in there.</p>
<p>And really science, like evolutionary biology</p>
<p>that a lot of people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s told really, really well.</p>
<p>It sounds like they&rsquo;re also, there&rsquo;s a narrative in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like storytelling too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think all good popular science books</p>
<p>are storytelling, but storytelling grounded,</p>
<p>constrained by the evidence.</p>
<p>And then I just wanna say that there are,</p>
<p>for fiction, I&rsquo;m a really big fan of love stories,</p>
<p>just to return us to the topic that we began with.</p>
<p>And so my, some of my favorite love stories</p>
<p>are Major Pettigrew&rsquo;s Last Stand by Helen Simonson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love story about people</p>
<p>who you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to fall in love</p>
<p>and all the people around them</p>
<p>who have to overcome their prejudices.</p>
<p>And I love this book.</p>
<p>What do you like, like what makes a good love story?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one thing.</p>
<p>There are many different things</p>
<p>that make a good love story.</p>
<p>But I think in this case, you can feel,</p>
<p>you can feel the journey.</p>
<p>You can feel the journey that these characters are on</p>
<p>and all the people around them are on this journey too,</p>
<p>basically to come to grips with this really unexpected love,</p>
<p>really profound love that develops</p>
<p>between these two characters</p>
<p>who are very unlikely to have fallen in love, but they do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s very gentle.</p>
<p>Another book like that is the storied life of A.J. Fierke,</p>
<p>which is also a love story.</p>
<p>But in this case, it&rsquo;s a love story</p>
<p>between a little girl and her adopted dad.</p>
<p>And the dad is this like real curmudgeony, you know, guy.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s a story there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a beautiful love story.</p>
<p>But it also, it&rsquo;s like everybody in this community</p>
<p>falls in love with him because he falls in love with her.</p>
<p>And he, you know, she just gets left at his store,</p>
<p>his bookstore, he has this failing bookstore.</p>
<p>And he discovers that, you know,</p>
<p>he feels like inexplicably this need</p>
<p>to take care of this little baby.</p>
<p>And this whole life emerges out of that one decision,</p>
<p>which is really beautiful actually, very poignant.</p>
<p>Do you think the greatest stories have a happy ending</p>
<p>or a heartbreak at the end?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a Russian question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Russian tragedies, you know.</p>
<p>So I would say the answer to that for me,</p>
<p>there has to be heartbreak.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really don&rsquo;t like heartbreak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like heartbreak.</p>
<p>I want there to be a happy ending</p>
<p>or at least a hopeful ending.</p>
<p>But you know, like Dr. Chivago, like,</p>
<p>or the English patient, oh my goodness, like why?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s just, yeah, no, mm mm.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it</p>
<p>on a happy note like this.</p>
<p>Lisa, like I said, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>

<p>from Sun Tzu and the Art of War.</p>
<p>There are not more than five musical notes,</p>
<p>yet the combination of these five give rise</p>
<p>to more melodies that can ever be heard.</p>
<p>There are not more than five primary colors,</p>
<p>yet in combination they produce more hues</p>
<p>that can ever be seen.</p>
<p>There are not more than five cardinal tastes,</p>
<p>and yet combinations of them yield more flavors</p>
<p>than can ever be tasted.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
