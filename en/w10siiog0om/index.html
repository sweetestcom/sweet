are very easy to get and some that are very very difficult probably out of all the nutrients the one that is the most difficult is vitamin d in fact it&amp;rsquo;s next to impossible to get the vitamin d that you need from foods this is why we have the sun right now probably one of the vitamins that is the easiest to get is probably vitamin k1 not k2 but vitamin k1 which is has anti-clotting factors and i would say b6 is pretty easy to get to it&amp;rsquo;s in so many different foods but the problem is a requirement for potassium is so high we need 4700 milligrams that that&amp;rsquo;s another one that&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get unless you&amp;rsquo;re consuming a lot of vegetables minimally seven cups now you can also get potassium from meats as well so you want to include all of your foods to figure out your potassium levels magnesium is another one that a lot of people are deficient in but if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming enough vegetables you&amp;rsquo;re going to get magnesium but magnesium is another mineral that a lot of people are deficient in and it&amp;rsquo;s a very necessary mineral to act as a cofactor for a lot of different chemical reactions in the body all right now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about vitamin a this is a very confusing topic because you&amp;rsquo;ll see certain videos and blog articles on vitamin a is in spinach it&amp;rsquo;s in kale you have to realize that is a pre vitamin a it&amp;rsquo;s not the actual bioavailable active form of vitamin a called retinol it&amp;rsquo;s mainly in a beta-carotene form which is a precursor so you have to convert it and rarely does anyone get any significant amount of retinol from consuming vegetables because number one the conversion factor is so low and on top of that 45% of the population has a mutation with their genes that doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow them to convert the pre-vitamin a to the active form of vitamin a and one of the best sources of active retinol would be in organ meats it would be in egg yolks now the next one i want to talk about is omega-3 fatty acids another one that is a bit difficult to get unless you&amp;rsquo;re consuming fatty fish organ meats grass-fed animal products now you can get omega-3 fatty acids in algae and seafood etc but the precursor to the omega-3 fatty acid dha is something called ala which is in walnuts it&amp;rsquo;s in other plants it&amp;rsquo;s in certain seeds but the conversion factor is very very small so even though ala is an omega-3 fatty acids it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like a precursor it&amp;rsquo;s not the actual important dha omega-3 fatty acid itself now the next set of nutrients i want to talk about is trace minerals many many many people are deficient in trace minerals simply because unless you&amp;rsquo;re consuming food from the sea or sea kelp or shellfish you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get a lot of trace minerals however there are a good amount of trace minerals and organ meats as we kind of go through this list and talk about what foods have certain key nutrients that will give you a really good idea on what you should be eating or what diet you should be on and then we get to the topic of iron you have heme iron which is a bio-available iron which is in animal products and then you have non-heme iron which are in vegetables and plants like spinach for example which is not very available to you so the most bioavailable iron is from animal products so as you can see as we&amp;rsquo;re going in the list a perfect diet would be a combination of plant foods and animal foods and let&amp;rsquo;s not forget b12 b12 is in animal products now plants do give us a good amount of vitamin c and you can get a good amount of vitamin c from berries like blueberries blackberries which have a low glycemic index now many people are trying to get their vitamin c from fruit the problem is that there&amp;rsquo;s just too much sugar and fruit and the fruit nowadays has been grown with high levels of sugar carbohydrates so we&amp;rsquo;re not going to recommend that but you can get a good amount of vitamin c from vegetables which are low in sugar even though they&amp;rsquo;re high in carbohydrate but a lot of that carbohydrate is fiber which does not affect your blood sugars now even though antioxidants and phytonutrients that are in our foods are not classified as essential nutrients i&amp;rsquo;m going to add this to the list simply because there&amp;rsquo;s so many benefits of these phytonutrients for example the phytonutrients in garlic anti-cancer antimicrobial are off the charts so a lot of spices and herbs and classes of vegetables like cruciferous give you additional nutrients like phytonutrients that go way beyond just the essential nutrients that most people think with so if we take a look at the foods that are most nutrient dense at the top of the list we have organ meats grass-fed liver of course grass-fed heart and brains are loaded with bioavailable nutrients so you don&amp;rsquo;t need much of it but a little bit on a regular basis would be very very helpful plus vitamin k2 which i haven&amp;rsquo;t really talked about is in organ meats it&amp;rsquo;s in fatty meats it&amp;rsquo;s in egg yolks it&amp;rsquo;s in grass-fed dairy and then we get shellfish which not only has the omega-3 fatty acids but it&amp;rsquo;s loaded with trace minerals and vitamins and minerals salmon great source of omega-3 fatty acids plus it has trace minerals and a great source of protein as well and then before we have cruciferous vegetables so we have great amounts of phytonutrients that are anti-cancer but we also have potassium magnesium trace minerals vitamin c but we&amp;rsquo;re not getting retinol from cruciferous vegetables number five i put in here salads or leafy greens for your potassium and your magnesium plus it has vitamin c and a lot of other great nutrients as well a lot of the b vitamins as well number six grass-fed meats have a really good spectrum of nutrients a great diversity of b vitamins and minerals and even antioxidants and then we get to the topic of eggs now the protein in eggs is very different than the protein you would get from meat we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with an embryo which gives you very unique types of nutrients versus animal muscle protein but the egg yolk is loaded with the active form of vitamin a which is retinol the egg has a great balance of nutrients pretty much every nutrient except vitamin c it may have a small amount of vitamin c but nothing significant but the egg yolk has choline which prevents the fatty liver helps your nervous system it has virtually all the fat soluble vitamins including k2 so we definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to neglect the egg i already mentioned fruits have too much sugar potatoes actually have a good amount of potassium and other nutrients like vitamin c but they&amp;rsquo;re high in starch so even though it may have some nutrients i&amp;rsquo;m not going to add that to the list now even though grains have certain nutrients okay like the b vitamins they are high in phytates which block certain trace minerals so they have properties of anti-nutrients and plus they are also high in carbs there are certain vegetables that are high in oxalates like spinach for example and rhubarb which will block calcium and they can also add a lot of other problems to your life like they can give you arthritic pains as well as kidney stones so even though spinach and swiss chard has a lot of nutrients it also has anti-nutrients as well and other compounds like tannins in tea and coffee have factors that deplete nutrients as well but really only if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming large quantities in them so if you&amp;rsquo;re drinking tea all day long and coffee it could be depleting a lot of key nutrients unless you put those back in all right guys so there you have it the seven most nutrient-dense foods before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.'>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿so the topic today is on nutrient dense foods 
there are certain nutrients that are very easy  </p>
<p>to get and some that are very very difficult 
probably out of all the nutrients the one that  </p>
<p>is the most difficult is vitamin d in fact it&rsquo;s 
next to impossible to get the vitamin d that  </p>
<p>you need from foods this is why we have the sun 
right now probably one of the vitamins that is  </p>
<p>the easiest to get is probably vitamin k1 not k2 
but vitamin k1 which is has anti-clotting factors  </p>
<p>and i would say b6 is pretty easy to get to it&rsquo;s 
in so many different foods but the problem is  </p>
<p>a requirement for potassium is so high we need 
4700 milligrams that that&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>difficult to get unless you&rsquo;re consuming a lot 
of vegetables minimally seven cups now you can  </p>
<p>also get potassium from meats as well so you want 
to include all of your foods to figure out your  </p>
<p>potassium levels magnesium is another one that 
a lot of people are deficient in but if you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>consuming enough vegetables you&rsquo;re going to 
get magnesium but magnesium is another mineral  </p>
<p>that a lot of people are deficient in and it&rsquo;s a 
very necessary mineral to act as a cofactor for  </p>
<p>a lot of different chemical reactions in the 
body all right now let&rsquo;s talk about vitamin a  </p>
<p>this is a very confusing topic because you&rsquo;ll see 
certain videos and blog articles on vitamin a is  </p>
<p>in spinach it&rsquo;s in kale you have to realize 
that is a pre vitamin a it&rsquo;s not the actual  </p>
<p>bioavailable active form of vitamin a called 
retinol it&rsquo;s mainly in a beta-carotene form  </p>
<p>which is a precursor so you have to convert it and 
rarely does anyone get any significant amount of  </p>
<p>retinol from consuming vegetables because number 
one the conversion factor is so low and on top of  </p>
<p>that 45% of the population has a mutation with 
their genes that doesn&rsquo;t allow them to convert  </p>
<p>the pre-vitamin a to the active form of vitamin 
a and one of the best sources of active retinol  </p>
<p>would be in organ meats it would be in egg yolks 
now the next one i want to talk about is omega-3  </p>
<p>fatty acids another one that is a bit difficult to 
get unless you&rsquo;re consuming fatty fish organ meats  </p>
<p>grass-fed animal products now you can get 
omega-3 fatty acids in algae and seafood  </p>
<p>etc but the precursor to the omega-3 fatty acid 
dha is something called ala which is in walnuts  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in other plants it&rsquo;s in certain seeds but 
the conversion factor is very very small so even  </p>
<p>though ala is an omega-3 fatty acids it&rsquo;s kind of 
like a precursor it&rsquo;s not the actual important dha  </p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acid itself now the next set of 
nutrients i want to talk about is trace minerals  </p>
<p>many many many people are deficient in trace 
minerals simply because unless you&rsquo;re consuming  </p>
<p>food from the sea or sea kelp or shellfish you&rsquo;re 
not going to get a lot of trace minerals however  </p>
<p>there are a good amount of trace minerals and 
organ meats as we kind of go through this list and  </p>
<p>talk about what foods have certain key nutrients 
that will give you a really good idea on what you  </p>
<p>should be eating or what diet you should be on 
and then we get to the topic of iron you have  </p>
<p>heme iron which is a bio-available iron which is 
in animal products and then you have non-heme iron  </p>
<p>which are in vegetables and plants like spinach 
for example which is not very available to you so  </p>
<p>the most bioavailable iron is from animal products 
so as you can see as we&rsquo;re going in the list  </p>
<p>a perfect diet would be a combination of plant 
foods and animal foods and let&rsquo;s not forget b12  </p>
<p>b12 is in animal products now plants do give us 
a good amount of vitamin c and you can get a good  </p>
<p>amount of vitamin c from berries like blueberries 
blackberries which have a low glycemic index now  </p>
<p>many people are trying to get their vitamin c from 
fruit the problem is that there&rsquo;s just too much  </p>
<p>sugar and fruit and the fruit nowadays has been 
grown with high levels of sugar carbohydrates so  </p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to recommend that but you can 
get a good amount of vitamin c from vegetables  </p>
<p>which are low in sugar even though they&rsquo;re high 
in carbohydrate but a lot of that carbohydrate is  </p>
<p>fiber which does not affect your blood sugars now 
even though antioxidants and phytonutrients that  </p>
<p>are in our foods are not classified as essential 
nutrients i&rsquo;m going to add this to the list simply  </p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many benefits of these 
phytonutrients for example the phytonutrients  </p>
<p>in garlic anti-cancer antimicrobial are off 
the charts so a lot of spices and herbs and  </p>
<p>classes of vegetables like cruciferous give 
you additional nutrients like phytonutrients  </p>
<p>that go way beyond just the essential nutrients 
that most people think with so if we take a look  </p>
<p>at the foods that are most nutrient dense 
at the top of the list we have organ meats  </p>
<p>grass-fed liver of course grass-fed heart and 
brains are loaded with bioavailable nutrients  </p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t need much of it but a little bit 
on a regular basis would be very very helpful  </p>
<p>plus vitamin k2 which i haven&rsquo;t really talked 
about is in organ meats it&rsquo;s in fatty meats  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in egg yolks it&rsquo;s in grass-fed dairy and 
then we get shellfish which not only has the  </p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids but it&rsquo;s loaded with 
trace minerals and vitamins and minerals  </p>
<p>salmon great source of omega-3 fatty acids 
plus it has trace minerals and a great source  </p>
<p>of protein as well and then before we have 
cruciferous vegetables so we have great amounts  </p>
<p>of phytonutrients that are anti-cancer but we 
also have potassium magnesium trace minerals  </p>
<p>vitamin c but we&rsquo;re not getting retinol from 
cruciferous vegetables number five i put in here  </p>
<p>salads or leafy greens for your potassium and your 
magnesium plus it has vitamin c and a lot of other  </p>
<p>great nutrients as well a lot of the b 
vitamins as well number six grass-fed  </p>
<p>meats have a really good spectrum of nutrients 
a great diversity of b vitamins and minerals  </p>
<p>and even antioxidants and then we get to the topic 
of eggs now the protein in eggs is very different  </p>
<p>than the protein you would get from meat we&rsquo;re 
dealing with an embryo which gives you very unique  </p>
<p>types of nutrients versus animal muscle protein 
but the egg yolk is loaded with the active form  </p>
<p>of vitamin a which is retinol the egg has a great 
balance of nutrients pretty much every nutrient  </p>
<p>except vitamin c it may have a small amount of 
vitamin c but nothing significant but the egg  </p>
<p>yolk has choline which prevents the fatty liver 
helps your nervous system it has virtually all the  </p>
<p>fat soluble vitamins including k2 so we definitely 
don&rsquo;t want to neglect the egg i already mentioned  </p>
<p>fruits have too much sugar potatoes actually have 
a good amount of potassium and other nutrients  </p>
<p>like vitamin c but they&rsquo;re high in starch so even 
though it may have some nutrients i&rsquo;m not going  </p>
<p>to add that to the list now even though grains 
have certain nutrients okay like the b vitamins  </p>
<p>they are high in phytates which block certain 
trace minerals so they have properties of  </p>
<p>anti-nutrients and plus they are also high in 
carbs there are certain vegetables that are high  </p>
<p>in oxalates like spinach for example and rhubarb 
which will block calcium and they can also add a  </p>
<p>lot of other problems to your life like they can 
give you arthritic pains as well as kidney stones  </p>
<p>so even though spinach and swiss chard has a lot 
of nutrients it also has anti-nutrients as well  </p>
<p>and other compounds like tannins in tea and 
coffee have factors that deplete nutrients as well  </p>
<p>but really only if you&rsquo;re consuming large 
quantities in them so if you&rsquo;re drinking tea  </p>
<p>all day long and coffee it could be depleting a 
lot of key nutrients unless you put those back in  </p>
<p>all right guys so there you have it the seven most 
nutrient-dense foods before you go if you have a  </p>
<p>question about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto 
and you want to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>on keto and you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not 
going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing  </p>
<p>by to help you this is just for the people in 
the u.s hopefully in the future we&rsquo;ll be able  </p>
<p>to answer everyone&rsquo;s call but i put the number 
down below so you can call and get some help</p>
