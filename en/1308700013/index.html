    <p>This is a special episode of The Deck, because the story I want to tell you today is about</p>
<p>a man whose face is not in a cold case card deck.</p>
<p>But we found the case so compelling that we&rsquo;ve decided to bring you his story in what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to call a wildcard episode.</p>
<p>There will be other wildcard episodes throughout this year, mostly because when our reporters</p>
<p>travel to do an interview, sometimes they come across other cases that aren&rsquo;t featured</p>
<p>on a deck that we just can&rsquo;t shake.</p>
<p>In this instance, we actually got asked to cover this case by the department.</p>
<p>And once we started learning more and more about this case, we quickly realized why.</p>
<p>So our card this week is Shelton Sanders, a wildcard from South Carolina.</p>
<p>Shelton was a young man who disappeared 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And despite all the time that&rsquo;s gone by and all the heartache his family has experienced,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never stopped looking for him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 20th, 2001, Peggy Sanders was at home in the small town of Rembert,</p>
<p>South Carolina, when her phone started ringing.</p>
<p>She picked it up, and on the other end of the line was someone from the University of</p>
<p>South Carolina&rsquo;s School of Medicine, where her son Shelton worked.</p>
<p>This colleague asked Peggy if Shelton was running late for work that morning because</p>
<p>no one at the office had seen him.</p>
<p>Peggy was a little dumbfounded by the question because she knew that her 25-year-old son</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t home.</p>
<p>He should have left a few hours ago.</p>
<p>You see, at the time, Shelton was living at his family&rsquo;s house, and every day he made</p>
<p>the 40-minute drive to Columbia and back.</p>
<p>In between taking classes at USC to get a degree in administrative information management,</p>
<p>Shelton was working as a computer programmer in the School of Medicine&rsquo;s neuropsychiatry</p>
<p>department.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where he should have been on the morning of June 20th.</p>
<p>Peggy knew it was completely unlike her son to be late for work, let alone not show up</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>And she said as much to his co-worker who was on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>They both agreed that something felt off because Shelton just wasn&rsquo;t the type to blow off his</p>
<p>job and classes.</p>
<p>In fact, according to his family, Shelton had a habit of making a big deal when he arrived</p>
<p>to work each day.</p>
<p>He would jovially greet all of his colleagues and announce his arrival when he clocked in</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>Peggy hung up the phone with Shelton&rsquo;s employer, and in her gut, she felt like something was</p>
<p>definitely wrong with this situation.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, Shelton had gotten caught up with something that morning, she knew he</p>
<p>would have at least called her or his dad.</p>
<p>Shelton was constantly in touch with his family during the day.</p>
<p>This was one of the first things his father, William, and his sister, Wolveria, told our</p>
<p>reporter in their interview for this show.</p>
<p>He would call home every day and let us know that he&rsquo;d made it to work, made it to school,</p>
<p>and then when he was on the way back.</p>
<p>So it was a frequent conversation with my family.</p>
<p>Within minutes of Peggy hanging up with Shelton&rsquo;s employer, she did what I think is natural</p>
<p>for any mother or loved one to do when they&rsquo;ve just learned that no one knows where their</p>
<p>child is.</p>
<p>She started making phone calls.</p>
<p>She dialed family members, more co-workers, and even hospitals just in case Shelton had</p>
<p>been in a car accident or something.</p>
<p>And just to give you an idea of how determined Peggy was, she didn&rsquo;t just call hospitals</p>
<p>in her local area.</p>
<p>She called every hospital between Columbia, South Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>Like, Mom was searching hard.</p>
<p>And the reason she made inquiries so far south was because the Sanders actually had other</p>
<p>family members in Jacksonville, and she assumed that it might be possible that Shelton had</p>
<p>gone there.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s not like he had mentioned any plans to do that.</p>
<p>But Peggy just wanted to make sure she covered all the possibilities.</p>
<p>The last time anyone in Shelton&rsquo;s family had heard from him was the night before, so</p>
<p>June 19th.</p>
<p>He had called home around 8.45 p.m. and talked with his mom.</p>
<p>He wanted to let her know that he would be getting home late because he had to go reserve</p>
<p>some hotel rooms in Columbia for a friend&rsquo;s upcoming bachelor party.</p>
<p>At the time, Shelton was driving his brother Edwin&rsquo;s car because his was in the shop.</p>
<p>During that same phone call when he talked with Peggy, he&rsquo;d also spoken with Edwin</p>
<p>and told him that he&rsquo;d have his car home within two hours, so around 11 o&rsquo;clock that</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>After that, Shelton&rsquo;s family didn&rsquo;t hear from him, but they weren&rsquo;t super alarmed</p>
<p>at that point because he told them he&rsquo;d be coming home later than usual.</p>
<p>So they all just gone to bed, and no one had actually heard or seen Shelton come home that</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>When everyone woke up on the 20th and didn&rsquo;t see Shelton or his brother&rsquo;s car, they just</p>
<p>assumed Shelton had already left for work.</p>
<p>When they realized that wasn&rsquo;t the case, though, that&rsquo;s when Wilveria, William, and</p>
<p>Peggy really started to worry.</p>
<p>He could have been driving home and got into a car accident or ran off the road.</p>
<p>Every call they made to medical centers and other family members turned up nothing.</p>
<p>They drove roads, looking into ditches, but still found no clues as to where Shelton was.</p>
<p>Within a matter of hours, Shelton&rsquo;s dad, William, went to the Sumter County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office, since that&rsquo;s the county Rembert is located in, and he tried to file a missing</p>
<p>persons report.</p>
<p>Staff at the department told him he couldn&rsquo;t report his adult son missing for 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is a really common line we hear a lot in stories like this, and the reason some</p>
<p>agencies have this policy is because anyone that&rsquo;s a grown adult can technically just</p>
<p>choose to go missing if they want to.</p>
<p>The sense of urgency you&rsquo;d normally see, say, if a kid disappeared, isn&rsquo;t there when</p>
<p>a 25-year-old just doesn&rsquo;t show up for work.</p>
<p>It is such a frustrating policy, and I&rsquo;m always haunted when I think about how many</p>
<p>missing people might have had a better chance of being found if an investigation into what</p>
<p>happened to them wasn&rsquo;t delayed by two whole days.</p>
<p>But despite William telling the deputies that his son was the last person who&rsquo;d take</p>
<p>off on his own without telling anyone, the Sheriff&rsquo;s office stood by its 48-hour rule.</p>
<p>So William and the rest of Shelton&rsquo;s family was left to start dialing the phones again.</p>
<p>They got a hold of some of Shelton&rsquo;s friends to find out if any of them had seen Shelton</p>
<p>the night before.</p>
<p>William got a hold of staff at USC and one of Shelton&rsquo;s guy friends, and within a few</p>
<p>minutes he was able to piece together some really critical information.</p>
<p>He learned where Shelton was and who he was with on June 19th.</p>
<p>After attending two hours worth of classes at USC, Shelton went to work at around one</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and he got off work at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>After leaving work, he went to a friend&rsquo;s house in Columbia and talked with his friend</p>
<p>about having to go book those hotel rooms for his friend&rsquo;s bachelor party.</p>
<p>Now it might sound weird that he was planning to go in person to book these rooms, but it</p>
<p>is 2001 and online booking wasn&rsquo;t really as easy as it is today.</p>
<p>And yes, he could have called, but Shelton had mentioned to his friend that the whole</p>
<p>point of going in person to the hotels was to go scope out which locations had the best</p>
<p>room configuration for all the guys attending the bachelor party.</p>
<p>Now the friend Shelton went to see after work was initially supposed to help him scout and</p>
<p>reserve the rooms, but at the last minute he told him he couldn&rsquo;t go anymore because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d made plans to go hang out with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>While Shelton was still at this friend&rsquo;s house, one of Shelton&rsquo;s old roommates, a</p>
<p>guy named Mark Richardson, who was also a friend of the groom, showed up and volunteered</p>
<p>to help Shelton go scout hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Before Mark and Shelton left, Shelton told Mark that they&rsquo;d be taking his brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>car, and that they couldn&rsquo;t be too long because he needed to get it back to Rembert</p>
<p>that night.</p>
<p>So Shelton followed Mark, and they drove to Mark&rsquo;s house so Mark could leave his car</p>
<p>there, and the men rode together in Shelton&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s car to go look at the hotels.</p>
<p>Around that time was when Shelton made the call home to let his family know he&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>coming home late.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all the information Shelton&rsquo;s guy friend could give to William.</p>
<p>Everything after that is a complete mystery, and unfortunately William didn&rsquo;t know Mark,</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t make contact with him during this first round of phone calls looking for</p>
<p>Shelton.</p>
<p>Days passed, and Shelton&rsquo;s family was only growing more and more worried about him.</p>
<p>The moment 48 hours came and went, William reported his son as a missing person to the</p>
<p>Sumter County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, and at that point, it was now June 22nd.</p>
<p>Pretty much right away, detectives started interviewing Shelton&rsquo;s family members and</p>
<p>his friends, trying to determine his last known whereabouts.</p>
<p>Everyone cooperated and gave their statements about the last time they&rsquo;d all seen or talked</p>
<p>with Shelton.</p>
<p>The cops learned about Shelton&rsquo;s phone call home and plans to go visit hotels in Columbia.</p>
<p>What police can clearly establish is that no one had seen him since June 19th.</p>
<p>No one except Mark Richardson.</p>
<p>Staff at three different hotels confirmed to investigators that they&rsquo;d seen Shelton</p>
<p>and Mark at their front desks inquiring about booking rooms.</p>
<p>Those witness accounts established a window of time between 9pm and 11pm, in which the</p>
<p>pair was doing what they told friends that they&rsquo;d set out to do.</p>
<p>The last known sighting of Shelton and Mark was around 11pm, when a witness indicated</p>
<p>the men were wrapping up for the night and heading home.</p>
<p>As police reviewed the rough timeline of Shelton&rsquo;s last known movements, they obviously set their</p>
<p>sights on tracking down and speaking with Mark Richardson.</p>
<p>Right as they were about to do that, though, a person came forward with information that</p>
<p>made the investigation turn a corner.</p>
<p>Investigators were faced with a shocking report that Shelton might not just be missing,</p>
<p>he could have been murdered.</p>
<p>As Sumter County investigators were getting into the search for Shelton Sanders, they</p>
<p>were going door to door where they think he was last seen, and they came across some crucial</p>
<p>information from Mark Richardson&rsquo;s next door neighbors.</p>
<p>The neighbors told investigators that on the night of June 19th, between 11.30pm and midnight,</p>
<p>they heard three gunshots come from Mark&rsquo;s rental trailer in Columbia on Olympia Avenue.</p>
<p>The neighbors told police they were so jarred by the sounds that they actually went over</p>
<p>to Mark&rsquo;s trailer and asked him what was going on.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s something I would have done, like a crime junkie rule is to</p>
<p>always stay away from where gunshots come from, but they must have known Mark well enough</p>
<p>to venture over to ask him.</p>
<p>Mark reportedly told his neighbors everything&rsquo;s alright, like that sound was just my car backfiring.</p>
<p>And the neighbors really didn&rsquo;t give his answer another thought until days later when</p>
<p>police came knocking at their door to ask if they had heard anything next door on the</p>
<p>night in question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they say they couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact that what they thought they</p>
<p>heard were three gunshots.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when investigators learned this information from the neighbors, Mark</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t home, and up until that point, no one, including police, had been able to get</p>
<p>a hold of him.</p>
<p>And at this point, when the authorities did learn the suspicious information about Mark</p>
<p>from his neighbors, Shelton had been missing for a full week.</p>
<p>Mark being with Shelton on the 19th and the information about the gunshots immediately</p>
<p>made Mark a key person of interest in the case.</p>
<p>So detectives asked him to come in and answer a few questions.</p>
<p>Mark agreed to talk with police and confirm the conversation he had had with his neighbors</p>
<p>late on the night of June 19th.</p>
<p>But he insisted that the noises that sounded like gunshots were just his car backfiring.</p>
<p>Mark said after Shelton dropped him off at around 1130, he didn&rsquo;t know where Shelton</p>
<p>went.</p>
<p>Not much else came out of the interview, and police really didn&rsquo;t have a lot to go on</p>
<p>to press Mark further.</p>
<p>And no one had offered up any reasoning for why Mark would have had it out for Shelton.</p>
<p>According to all the friends and family members police had spoken with up until that point,</p>
<p>the two men had no beef whatsoever.</p>
<p>With no sign of Shelton, or his body, or Edwin&rsquo;s car, and no real motive for anyone to want</p>
<p>to hurt him, police didn&rsquo;t hold Mark or charge him with anything.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even have enough probable cause to try and get a search warrant for his trailer.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly, the investigation came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Detectives held onto hope that an actual eyewitness would come forward to give them more information,</p>
<p>or that Shelton would just turn up, but neither of those things happened.</p>
<p>Some tips did trickle in here and there during the weeks and months after Shelton vanished,</p>
<p>but none of them led anywhere.</p>
<p>Feeling like police were getting nowhere, William decided to take the investigation</p>
<p>into what happened to his son, into his own hands.</p>
<p>He started going out nightly, looking everywhere he could think, and speaking with as many</p>
<p>people as he could get to talk to him.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t afraid.</p>
<p>When it came, I got in my military mode, and I would go out, and I would walk places, and</p>
<p>I would ride places, but I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to see me leave home.</p>
<p>I would go places where I thought that I would learn something.</p>
<p>I would just sit there like a forward observer, look and sit on a target to see whether or</p>
<p>not there&rsquo;s any movement.</p>
<p>I have a sense in my mind, in my heart, a relief that I did not sit idle.</p>
<p>William kept at this for nearly two years, and he learned a lot of information, but nothing</p>
<p>that led him to finding out where his son was.</p>
<p>Finally, in April of 2003, law enforcement working the case caught a major break.</p>
<p>On April 26th, just shy of the two-year anniversary of Shelton&rsquo;s disappearance, a sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deputy in neighboring Richland County, South Carolina, was on patrol in Northeast Columbia</p>
<p>when he noticed a car at the Greenbrier apartment complex that was backed into a parking space</p>
<p>and had four flat tires.</p>
<p>The sight alone wasn&rsquo;t super alarming, but it was suspicious enough for the deputy</p>
<p>to park and check it out.</p>
<p>When he got close enough to it, he noticed that it looked as if the rubber on the tires</p>
<p>was actually melting into the pavement.</p>
<p>Like the tires weren&rsquo;t just recently flat, they looked like they had been flat for a</p>
<p>while and the rubber had sort of pooled and melted into the asphalt a little bit.</p>
<p>The deputy ran the license plate and it came back as belonging to Edwin Sanders.</p>
<p>Now, thankfully, this deputy knew enough about the Shelton Sanders case in Sumter County</p>
<p>to pick up the phone and alert that agency that he had found a car that they would definitely</p>
<p>be interested in.</p>
<p>Crime scene investigators from Sumter County responded to the apartment complex right away,</p>
<p>and they started taking photos of the car and processing potential evidence.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, the Sanders family got a phone call informing them that the car Shelton</p>
<p>had been driving had been found.</p>
<p>After two years of feeling like hope was fading, the Sanders were stunned to hear the news</p>
<p>and learn that the car had been sitting right there in plain sight the whole time.</p>
<p>I thought that a car was actually either placed in a river or in some lake or even burned.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really expect to ever, ever see that car again.</p>
<p>Investigators carefully combed through the car for clues, but found little in the way</p>
<p>of evidence.</p>
<p>According to investigators, crime scene techs found some dead flowers in the backseat and</p>
<p>a local newspaper from Columbia that was dated June 19th, 2001, the day Shelton disappeared.</p>
<p>The flowers were an odd find at first, but apparently in June of 2001, Shelton had been</p>
<p>pursuing a classmate at USC, and he had told friends and family that he planned on giving</p>
<p>this girl the flowers.</p>
<p>So based on the fact that they remained in his car, that told investigators that he likely</p>
<p>intended to make the romantic gesture on June 19th or possibly the morning of June 20th,</p>
<p>but he never got the chance.</p>
<p>Instead, the flowers died in the backseat of this abandoned car.</p>
<p>Investigators swept the trunk of the car for any further forensic evidence, but found</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>They even searched up and over a hill that was behind where the car was parked, but that</p>
<p>too led nowhere.</p>
<p>The site of the abandoned car was difficult for William to handle.</p>
<p>It was a glimmer of hope, but it only left them with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a day that I won&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll always be a day that I can&rsquo;t even tell those, I know I have words to tell you what</p>
<p>was going on when I saw the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just emotional.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Sumter County towed the car to its police impound lot in Columbia, and it&rsquo;s actually still</p>
<p>sitting there to this day.</p>
<p>Now, despite finding nothing of evidentiary value in the car, the location where it was</p>
<p>parked became a focal point for investigators.</p>
<p>And actually, it caused the case to be transferred to the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>While both agencies stayed involved with the case, and even some investigators with the</p>
<p>State Police of South Carolina lent resources, ultimately Richland County officially took</p>
<p>the lead at that point.</p>
<p>The first thing detectives wanted to know was if Shelton had any connections or acquaintances</p>
<p>at the Greenbrier Apartments.</p>
<p>And it turns out, he did have a friend who used to live there.</p>
<p>But the Greenbrier Apartments are massive, like there are multiple buildings sprawled</p>
<p>around a few different blocks.</p>
<p>And that friend who lived there didn&rsquo;t actually live in the building directly in front of</p>
<p>where the car was found.</p>
<p>He lived one building down from the car&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>Our reporter asked detectives with Richland County why this friend who lived there never</p>
<p>reported seeing the car during these two years after Shelton vanished.</p>
<p>And they said that since it was Shelton&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s car, police think that the friend</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t recognize it as being associated with Shelton.</p>
<p>But aside from even this friend, it seems odd to me that no one reported the car since</p>
<p>a be on the lookout had been circulating for such a long time.</p>
<p>And the car had apparently been sitting there for two years.</p>
<p>But police in Richland told news outlets that no reports about the car had come into them</p>
<p>during that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the car being discovered moves the investigation forward in a pretty important</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>Police had never stopped suspecting that Mark Richardson was somehow connected to what happened</p>
<p>to Shelton, but they could never prove it.</p>
<p>So now that they had a location where Shelton&rsquo;s car had been abandoned, they worked to get</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s cell phone records to see if he&rsquo;d been in that area back in late June of 2001.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, Mark&rsquo;s cell phone records showed that he was in the exact</p>
<p>same place as Shelton&rsquo;s car on the night of June 19th, 2001.</p>
<p>So if things looked bad for Mark before, now it&rsquo;s really looking bad for him.</p>
<p>Police bring him in for another round of questioning.</p>
<p>But remember, this time the case has moved to Richland County and a new set of detectives</p>
<p>get their chance to grill Mark.</p>
<p>On July 25th, 2003, the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office starred in on Mark, asking him why</p>
<p>his old roommate Shelton Sanders hasn&rsquo;t been seen since he was at Mark&rsquo;s house two</p>
<p>years prior, in 2001.</p>
<p>And detectives sort of start out slow, wanting to see if Mark would confess to anything.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So they changed tactics.</p>
<p>They informed Mark that they can now prove, based on his cell phone records, that he was</p>
<p>in the same area where Shelton&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s car was abandoned.</p>
<p>Mark explained that Edwin&rsquo;s car and him both being at the Greenbrier Apartments on</p>
<p>June 19th was just pure coincidence.</p>
<p>And then he told investigators a wild story.</p>
<p>Mark said that after Shelton left his trailer that night, Mark had gone to the laundromat</p>
<p>and tried to hook up with a girl.</p>
<p>He ended up in that woman&rsquo;s car near the Greenbrier Apartments, but then the girl bailed</p>
<p>and he was left alone needing a ride home.</p>
<p>Now, police didn&rsquo;t buy the story and pushed Mark for more information about Shelton.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at that point in the interview that Mark stopped, and he asked a strange question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he was asking the hypothetical questions about, is there such thing as an</p>
<p>accidental death in South Carolina?</p>
<p>How do you explain getting rid of a body?</p>
<p>And how do I go back to Shelton&rsquo;s parents?</p>
<p>And tell them that I&rsquo;ve already pretended like I wanted to help them.</p>
<p>Let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<p>Mark Richardson, in a police interrogation room with his head in his palms, is asking</p>
<p>police how consequences for an accidental death work in South Carolina, and how a person</p>
<p>could explain getting rid of a body.</p>
<p>In that moment, the Richland County detectives reminded Mark that Shelton&rsquo;s family has</p>
<p>been waiting two years for answers, and he owes it to them to at least tell them what</p>
<p>happened to Shelton, or where his body is.</p>
<p>But almost as quickly as it seemed he was breaking, Mark shut down and refused to say</p>
<p>anything else.</p>
<p>From there, police started moving more in the direction of trying to secure an arrest</p>
<p>warrant for Mark.</p>
<p>The problem was, he didn&rsquo;t technically go as far as to outright confess to anything.</p>
<p>He just asked really, really sketchy questions.</p>
<p>Police absolutely thought Mark was involved somehow, they just weren&rsquo;t sure exactly</p>
<p>how.</p>
<p>They theorized, based on what he said in his interview, that if he didn&rsquo;t kill Shelton</p>
<p>himself, then it was possible he at least knew who did, and he likely witnessed the</p>
<p>murder and then helped hide his body.</p>
<p>So Richland County detectives started rebuilding their case, doing more interviews, reconducting</p>
<p>old interviews, and collecting as many statements as possible.</p>
<p>And most importantly, they continued looking for Shelton&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>They searched lakes, rivers, swamps, fields, and drainage ditches all throughout Richland</p>
<p>and Sumter counties, but still there was no sign of Shelton.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2005, after a lot of things happened behind the scenes, police were granted search</p>
<p>warrants for Mark&rsquo;s trailer, the one he&rsquo;d been living in back in 2001 when Shelton</p>
<p>went missing, along with a new apartment that he&rsquo;d been living in since 2003.</p>
<p>By October 2005, whatever investigators did with the results of those search warrants</p>
<p>and all of their investigative efforts up until that point, they were able to officially</p>
<p>arrest Mark for the crime, even though Shelton was still missing.</p>
<p>Based on what Richland County told our reporter and what the Sanders were told, authorities</p>
<p>had enough to bring charges by 2005, so that&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>But the specifics of what they had and what their theory was wouldn&rsquo;t come out until</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s trial.</p>
<p>Right after Mark&rsquo;s arrest on October 7th, the Richland County Sheriff told WLTX-TV,</p>
<p>quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We know that he&rsquo;s dead and we know that Mr. Richardson is responsible,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>After that arrest, Shelton&rsquo;s family breathed a partial sigh of relief.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d long suspected Mark was involved, but like police, they couldn&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>Just the fact that prosecutors were willing to try the case without Shelton&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>was a win in their minds.</p>
<p>Plus, they hoped that maybe Mark&rsquo;s arrest would make him decide to reveal where Shelton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body was, if he was actually involved.</p>
<p>The weight of everything that had happened between 2001 and 2005 hit Wolveria hard.</p>
<p>She was only 11 when Shelton vanished, but by the time Mark was arrested and charged,</p>
<p>she was a teenager.</p>
<p>I was just getting out of elementary school, going to middle school, and in middle school</p>
<p>the kids would come to me and say things that their parents told them that I never even</p>
<p>knew.</p>
<p>And so that always worried me going to high school, especially in high school, it got</p>
<p>even worse.</p>
<p>But I never could tell my parents because I just didn&rsquo;t say anything to them, I just</p>
<p>kept it all in.</p>
<p>For years, she missed her big brother, and she longed to have the memories back that</p>
<p>were stolen from her and her family.</p>
<p>Every Saturday he would make me get up early in the morning and get on this little stool,</p>
<p>we still had this stool at home, and I would have to get up there and cook grits and he</p>
<p>would show me how to make the water in there.</p>
<p>And then if I accidentally put too much butter in it, he&rsquo;d be like, that&rsquo;s too much butter.</p>
<p>It took Richland County attorneys three more years to prepare for Mark&rsquo;s trial.</p>
<p>And finally, in April 2008, the prosecution laid out its case for a jury.</p>
<p>We were able to get the audio recordings of the trial while in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the head prosecutor&rsquo;s opening statement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to put witnesses up on this stand.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to swear it over and tell you that late the night of June 19th, 2001, they</p>
<p>heard three gunshots.</p>
<p>And those three gunshots that night happened to be in a living.</p>
<p>And they happened to be in the yard.</p>
<p>And that yard happened to be where the defendant, Mark Richardson, was living in a trailer that</p>
<p>he rented.</p>
<p>Three distinctive gunshots, June 19th, 2001.</p>
<p>The state argued throughout the trial that the neighbors hearing the gunshots and Mark&rsquo;s</p>
<p>near confession during his second police interview in 2005 were enough for a conviction.</p>
<p>Sheldon Sanders was never seen from nor heard from after those three gunshots in his yard.</p>
<p>Never heard from again, body never seen again.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s defense attorney countered, though, and chastised the government&rsquo;s case, saying</p>
<p>that it was built entirely on circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>They emphasized that if jurors wanted to see direct evidence tying Mark Richardson to the</p>
<p>disappearance and death of Sheldon Sanders, they weren&rsquo;t going to find it.</p>
<p>We will point out to you and you will see that there&rsquo;s no indication of any physical</p>
<p>evidence that Sheldon Sanders was killed on June 19th by any other day.</p>
<p>There are no eyewitnesses that can testify that Mark Richardson killed Sheldon Sanders.</p>
<p>By their own admission, they have never found Sheldon Sanders&rsquo; body.</p>
<p>In addition to the neighbor witness testimony, prosecutors presented to the jurors the testimony</p>
<p>of one of Sheldon&rsquo;s friends who said that Mark had experienced what they referred to</p>
<p>as an episode of paranoia right before Sheldon was killed, and that Mark had stated that</p>
<p>he had the desire to kill one of his friends.</p>
<p>That testimony was the closest authorities ever got to establishing a motive.</p>
<p>They could not find any other reason why Mark or anyone in Sheldon&rsquo;s life would benefit</p>
<p>from his death or want him dead.</p>
<p>The state was convinced that Mark killed Sheldon in some sort of momentary rage over something</p>
<p>that in hindsight was probably very insignificant.</p>
<p>But in all the statements taken from their friends over the years, none of Sheldon and</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s mutual acquaintances ever recalled them fighting or even having issues with each</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>The trial lasted more than a week, and after several hours of deliberation, the jury came</p>
<p>back with a surprising verdict.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a recording of the judge who presided over the trial.</p>
<p>I cannot make you deliberate any further.</p>
<p>I can ask you if you think that deliberating further would serve any useful purpose.</p>
<p>I can ask you if you think coming back tomorrow or anything else might serve any useful purpose.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t make you do anything.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman, do you think it would serve any useful purpose for the jury to come back further?</p>
<p>Do you want to discuss that with your fellow jurors or anything?</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then the court declares a mistrial in the case.</p>
<p>A mistrial because of a hung jury, meaning the majority of jurors on the panel couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>convict the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, but they didn&rsquo;t necessarily believe</p>
<p>that he should be acquitted either.</p>
<p>Simply put, the jury couldn&rsquo;t agree unanimously or with a majority.</p>
<p>The foreman said that because there was no body and no weapon, there just wasn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>evidence for them to know for sure what really happened and how involved Mark may have been.</p>
<p>After the mistrial was declared, Mark was released on bond and ordered not to have any</p>
<p>contact with the Sanders family or any witnesses who testified at trial.</p>
<p>He posted bond and was warned that he could be tried again when or if Shelton&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>was ever found and prosecutors decided to refile charges.</p>
<p>That was in 2008, 14 years ago.</p>
<p>Shelton Sanders is still a missing person and all these years later, no one in his family</p>
<p>has closure as to what happened to him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, they don&rsquo;t even know for sure if his suspected killer is Mark or if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone else who&rsquo;s still out there.</p>
<p>They told our reporter that they don&rsquo;t even feel strongly about whether or not Mark gets</p>
<p>retried.</p>
<p>They just want Shelton&rsquo;s body so they can lay him to rest properly.</p>
<p>In fact, the family has a $25,000 reward up for grabs for any information that helps them</p>
<p>find Shelton&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>I can only speak of my family and what we desire is the remains more so than the suspect.</p>
<p>We want the remains home because that&rsquo;s just how close we are.</p>
<p>We want to know what happened to our loved one.</p>
<p>Wolveria always thinks about what it would be like to have her brother around today and</p>
<p>what his life would be like.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll definitely be a computer programmer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to marry with kids by now.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s very optimistic about his future, graduating and starting a new career.</p>
<p>William has no doubt that if Shelton were still here today, they&rsquo;d be spending time</p>
<p>together watching their favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>But instead of doing that, William is left pondering the last interaction he had with Shelton.</p>
<p>I remember this conversation that we had.</p>
<p>He came to me shortly before he went missing.</p>
<p>He said, Dad, give me a big bear hug.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m going to make you very proud of me.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>And this is within days before he went missing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make you very proud.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last thing in my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget that.</p>
<p>In June of 2021, the Sanders held a 20-year commemoration for Shelton at their home in Rembert.</p>
<p>Wolveria planned the whole thing with help from her mom, Peggy, and dad, William.</p>
<p>And there was a great turnout.</p>
<p>She wanted to celebrate the milestones that Shelton did achieve in his short life</p>
<p>and bring awareness to the fact that they&rsquo;re not giving up hope that they will bring him home one day.</p>
<p>The family hopes that having events like this around the anniversary of Shelton&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>will remind people that the time to come forward is now.</p>
<p>The season for justice is now.</p>
<p>Shelton Sanders didn&rsquo;t just disappear.</p>
<p>His body is out there somewhere.</p>
<p>If you want to help the Sanders family bring Shelton home,</p>
<p>or if you have any information about the person or persons who may have been involved in his case,</p>
<p>there are a few things you can do.</p>
<p>You can call the Shelton Sanders Anonymous tip line at 803-427-4209</p>
<p>or you can call the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Cold Case Unit at 803-576-3000.</p>
