    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 17, Ancient Celts and the Latin Invasion of Gaul.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the ancient Celts, the people who once dominated</p>
<p>much of Europe.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the spread of Rome and Latin into many of the territories where the</p>
<p>Romance languages are being spoken today.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me give you an update on a couple of matters.</p>
<p>First, I sometimes neglect to mention the website for the podcast, so let me do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;ve mentioned in past episodes that I&rsquo;m working on a series dedicated to the history</p>
<p>of the alphabet from its ancient origins to modern English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s taken me a little longer than I anticipated to put that together because I&rsquo;ve been trying</p>
<p>to maintain a regular schedule for this podcast.</p>
<p>And so in order to get an episode of the podcast ready every two weeks, I&rsquo;ve not had</p>
<p>as much time to dedicate to the alphabet series.</p>
<p>But it looks like that series will be ready by the start of the new year.</p>
<p>And it will actually consist of several parts.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;ll be an overall history of the alphabet and then a look at the various letters</p>
<p>and how they got to use in their current form.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll basically be an audio book, which will be divided into several chapters.</p>
<p>So look for that in January.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn now to this episode.</p>
<p>Now last time I explored the rise of Rome from a small village in western Italy to the</p>
<p>dominant political and military power of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And with the spread of Rome, the Roman language went with it.</p>
<p>But the overall role of Latin was still limited at this point.</p>
<p>In the eastern Mediterranean, Greek was still the dominant language.</p>
<p>And it would remain the dominant language even after the Romans conquered the Macedonian</p>
<p>and Greek territories in the east.</p>
<p>In north of Italy, in the areas we know today as France and Germany and Britain, it was</p>
<p>the Celtic languages that dominated.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at these Celtic-speaking people of western Europe and try to figure out who</p>
<p>they were.</p>
<p>When we think of modern Celtic cultures, we think of places like Ireland, Scotland, and</p>
<p>Wales.</p>
<p>We can also include places like the Isle of Man and the French province of Brittany.</p>
<p>In all of these places, modern Celtic languages are still spoken.</p>
<p>But these are merely the remnants of a culture, or at least a linguistic group, that once</p>
<p>dominated most of central and western Europe.</p>
<p>In fact, during the time of the early Roman Republic, pretty much all of Europe, between</p>
<p>Italy in the south and Scandinavia in the north, was occupied by Celtic-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>And this included Britain and large portions of modern Spain.</p>
<p>So who were these ancient Celts?</p>
<p>Well, they were the linguistic descendants of the early Celtic tribes which I&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>in earlier episodes.</p>
<p>So, like the Greeks, and the Romans, and the Germanic tribes to the north in Scandinavia,</p>
<p>they all spoke languages which were descended from the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>As you may recall, I&rsquo;ve mentioned in prior episodes that late in the 2nd millennium BC,</p>
<p>there were a variety of Indo-European tribes in the region north of Greece in southeastern</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve mentioned that these tribes included the tribes that swept down into Greece and</p>
<p>caused disruptions which led to the period known as the Invasion of the Sea Peoples in</p>
<p>the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve noted that some language historians believe that these tribes may have also included</p>
<p>the ancestors of the Latin-speaking tribes and the other Italic-speaking tribes that</p>
<p>found their way into Italy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve mentioned that these tribes may have also included the ancestors of the Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s keep in mind that, as with so much of this part of ancient history, we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be too definitive about any of this.</p>
<p>There are still lots of competing theories about the specific treks taken by the various</p>
<p>Indo-European tribes.</p>
<p>By now, if you&rsquo;ve listened to the earlier episodes of the podcast, you&rsquo;ll know that</p>
<p>much of what is known about ancient history is the product of relatively recent discoveries</p>
<p>‚Äì and by relatively recent, I mean within the past couple of centuries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s generally true for our view of the ancient Celts as well.</p>
<p>In the mid-1800s, a prehistoric cemetery was discovered near Hallstatt in modern Austria.</p>
<p>And excavations revealed that this was the site of a culture that existed from around</p>
<p>the 8th century BC until the 6th century BC.</p>
<p>And it turns out this was one of the earliest Celtic settlements in Central Europe.</p>
<p>And about a decade after the discovery of the Hallstatt Cemetery, a prolonged drought</p>
<p>in Switzerland lowered the level of several lakes and revealed the remains of another</p>
<p>ancient settlement near the city of La T√®ne in Switzerland.</p>
<p>And this was a later Celtic settlement which originated near the end of the earlier Hallstatt</p>
<p>period and indicates a general westward movement of these peoples from southeastern Europe</p>
<p>into western Europe.</p>
<p>And both of these sites have revealed a tremendous amount about these early tribes.</p>
<p>These Celtic tribes also existed at a time when early Greek and Roman historians encountered</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>In addition to the archaeological evidence, we also have some contemporary accounts of</p>
<p>these Celts by these ancient historians.</p>
<p>So if we put all these pieces together, we can get a general sense of who these people</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, it&rsquo;s likely that the linguistic ancestors of the Celts were located in southeastern</p>
<p>Europe in the area north of Greece late in the 2nd millennium BC.</p>
<p>From here, they began a migration northwestward along the southern side of the Carpathian</p>
<p>Mountains into the area of modern Hungary and then further westward into modern Austria.</p>
<p>Remember this is where the Celtic cemetery was discovered in Hallstatt in Austria.</p>
<p>And this site represented one of the earliest of the ancient Celtic settlements.</p>
<p>And so historians call this the Hallstatt culture.</p>
<p>And we can think of it as the Hallstatt phase of the overall Celtic culture.</p>
<p>Now this Hallstatt phase begins around 750 BC.</p>
<p>So to put that into some perspective, that was around the time that the ancient Greeks</p>
<p>were emerging from the Greek Dark Age, having just adopted the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>And that was around the same time that the first Latin speaking tribes were settling</p>
<p>into the community that would become known as Rome.</p>
<p>So at this very early stage, these early Celts were just another group of tribes settling</p>
<p>into Western Europe and speaking an Indo-European dialect or language.</p>
<p>And by this point, there may have been enough of a distinction between the languages of</p>
<p>these tribes and the other Indo-European tribes that we can say that we have a distinct Celtic</p>
<p>language in place.</p>
<p>But linguists are not in universal agreement on that point.</p>
<p>So regardless, if the Celtic language didn&rsquo;t exist yet, it was quickly emerging.</p>
<p>And by this point, these early Celts had discovered the first organized farming in northern Europe.</p>
<p>And archaeologists who study this part of Europe call the people who lived there before</p>
<p>the Celts the Urnfield culture because they cremated their dead and they interred them</p>
<p>in urns.</p>
<p>And around the time that this Hallstatt phase began, around 750 BC, this pre-existing Urnfield</p>
<p>culture began to morph into the emerging Celtic culture.</p>
<p>So we probably have native peoples in these regions who were beginning to adopt some of</p>
<p>the Celtic cultural characteristics, including the Celtic dialects.</p>
<p>Remember that there&rsquo;s a difference between the spread of a language or culture and the</p>
<p>spread of ethnicity.</p>
<p>So this early Celtic culture was spreading throughout Central Europe, perhaps by invasion,</p>
<p>perhaps by migration, perhaps by assimilation of native cultures, but it was spreading and</p>
<p>it was spreading very quickly.</p>
<p>And these tribes continued their westward expansion so that by the time we get to the</p>
<p>La T√®ne settlement in modern Switzerland, say around 450 BC, we can say with some certainty</p>
<p>that we have a distinct Celtic language in place among these peoples.</p>
<p>And by this point, Celtic tribes occupied or they were in the process of occupying much</p>
<p>of the territory of modern Germany and Austria and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Now during this so-called La T√®ne period from around 450 BC until about 200 BC, these</p>
<p>tribes were spreading throughout Western Europe, eventually occupying all of modern</p>
<p>France and the British Isles and large portions of modern Spain.</p>
<p>So what we really have is a group of tribes spread out over a broad swath of Central and</p>
<p>Western Europe.</p>
<p>At one time, early historians were reluctant to group all these people together as part</p>
<p>of some larger unified cultural group.</p>
<p>The fact is these tribes were often at war with each other and there&rsquo;s no indication</p>
<p>that these people saw themselves as part of some larger interconnected culture.</p>
<p>But as modern scholars have examined these peoples more closely, and with the benefit</p>
<p>of hindsight, they&rsquo;ve begun to focus on the similarities between these people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve increasingly concluded that we do in fact have a common culture among these</p>
<p>people that we can now call the ancient Celtic culture.</p>
<p>There was no unified government among these peoples, instead it was really more like a</p>
<p>confederation of independent tribes.</p>
<p>But they had a common material culture, and they had a common religion, and they had a</p>
<p>common language, or at least a common family of languages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s these three things, material objects, religion, and language, that allows us to</p>
<p>group these people together and call them the Celts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the material objects.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have determined that these ancient Celts were the first people of Europe</p>
<p>to master the use of iron.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve discovered amazing artwork and tools and weapons, all made from iron and all of</p>
<p>a very similar style.</p>
<p>Now once these people had mastered iron, they exported the technology throughout Western</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And like their Indo-European ancestors, the Celts were well equipped for mobility with</p>
<p>horses and wagons and carts and chariots.</p>
<p>But they were not nomadic.</p>
<p>They were farmers who lived in settled communities.</p>
<p>Now farming was certainly not unique to the Celts.</p>
<p>Most ancient people by this point were engaging in some type of farming.</p>
<p>But again, unlike other peoples of Northern Europe, these early Celts were renowned for</p>
<p>their mastery of iron, and their ability to forge iron tools for farming.</p>
<p>And this use of iron technology was widespread among these tribes, but not nearly as common</p>
<p>among non-Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said, this mastery of iron extended to iron weapons and jewelry and other items.</p>
<p>So this early use of iron and mastery of iron is the first thing that linked these</p>
<p>early tribes together.</p>
<p>The second major unifying factor was religion, and specifically the class of religious leaders</p>
<p>which these tribes utilized.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve probably heard of these religious leaders before.</p>
<p>They were called the Druids.</p>
<p>The Druids were Celtic priests and they conducted a wide variety of religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>They officiated at the worship of gods and they regulated private and public sacrifices.</p>
<p>They also acted as judges in disputes between both individuals and tribes.</p>
<p>They had a very special status in Celtic society.</p>
<p>They came from leading families and they were exempted from paying taxes or taking part</p>
<p>in fighting.</p>
<p>And they were basically the teachers and the judges within Celtic society.</p>
<p>And the key here is that you don&rsquo;t really find Druids outside of these Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>The later Romans noted that the Germanic tribes, further north in Scandinavia and into northern</p>
<p>Europe, they didn&rsquo;t have Druid priests.</p>
<p>So the Druids were unique to the Celtic culture.</p>
<p>And that fact provides another unifying link between them.</p>
<p>Now at the height of Celtic power, it was possible to cross the entire continent of</p>
<p>Europe from east to west without ever leaving Celtic territory.</p>
<p>Remember that the Germanic tribes occupied the territory to the north in northern Europe</p>
<p>and the Romans were expanding throughout the Mediterranean to the south.</p>
<p>But the vast territory in the middle was occupied by the Celts.</p>
<p>And even though they were not a cohesive group of tribes, the Druids within these various</p>
<p>tribes did communicate with each other over vast distances.</p>
<p>According to the later Romans, the Druids of Gaul, which is in modern France, they communicated</p>
<p>with the Druids of Britain.</p>
<p>So again, we do see a type of networking between these groups.</p>
<p>And this is even more evidence of a common culture.</p>
<p>Now the word Druid comes from the Indo-European root word for oak tree.</p>
<p>And oak trees had very mystical, sacred properties to the ancient Celts.</p>
<p>So the term Druid reflected a connection between the priests and the sacred oaks.</p>
<p>The rituals performed by Druids often took place outside, especially in the woods.</p>
<p>And since mistletoe often grew in trees, especially oak trees, the Celts soon came to believe</p>
<p>that mistletoe was sacred as well.</p>
<p>They thought that mistletoe had healing properties and could fend off evil spirits.</p>
<p>It was thought to be a sign of good luck and blessings.</p>
<p>It was so sacred that when the enemies happened to meet and pass under mistletoe in the forest,</p>
<p>they would lay down their weapons and agree to a truce, at least until the next day.</p>
<p>And this was the origin of hanging mistletoe above a doorway as a sign of peace and good</p>
<p>will.</p>
<p>And of course, that tradition later passed into Christianity many centuries later.</p>
<p>By the way, the Germanic tribes also held mistletoe in high regard and the tradition</p>
<p>of kissing under the mistletoe comes from those tribes.</p>
<p>So we see many similarities between the ancient Celts and the ancient Germanic tribes during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to deal with the Germanic tribes in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>And speaking of holiday traditions rooted in ancient Celtic culture, many of our modern</p>
<p>Halloween traditions can also be traced back to the Celts, specifically the Celts of the</p>
<p>British Isles.</p>
<p>But that was a much later borrowing that occurred during the Middle Ages, so I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>going to go into that here.</p>
<p>So the use of iron and the creation of specific iron objects helps to establish a connection</p>
<p>between these people and certain religious practices, especially the existence of Druids,</p>
<p>marks another cultural connection.</p>
<p>But one of the most important connections between these people, especially for our purposes,</p>
<p>was the fact that they all spoke closely related languages, which we call Celtic today.</p>
<p>And again, these were ancient versions of the modern Celtic languages, like Gaelic</p>
<p>and Breton.</p>
<p>But like many ancient people, the Celts were illiterate, meaning simply they didn&rsquo;t write</p>
<p>down their language.</p>
<p>So that obviously makes the study of the early Celtic languages very difficult.</p>
<p>And the major point here is that by the 2nd century BC, Celtic languages were widely spoken</p>
<p>across Western and Central Europe, and even though those languages were quite likely diverse</p>
<p>and may not have been mutually intelligible, they still reflect a common linguistic ancestry.</p>
<p>So all of these factors allow historians and linguists to lump these various European tribes</p>
<p>together under the general heading of the Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>Now by 400 BC, these tribes had already spread across much of Western Europe, and they were</p>
<p>also probably filtering into the British Isles at this time as well.</p>
<p>They brought with them all of the cultural factors I just discussed, ironworking, druids,</p>
<p>and Celtic languages.</p>
<p>Now as I mentioned earlier, archaeologists call the earliest Celtic culture the Hallstatt</p>
<p>culture, based around what they&rsquo;ve unearthed at Hallstatt in Austria.</p>
<p>And then there was this later Celtic culture exemplified by the site at La T√®ne in Switzerland.</p>
<p>But these later artifacts, discovered at La T√®ne, have much more elaborate designs, and</p>
<p>they reflect influences from trading with the Greeks and the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And this would have been a time when ancient Greece was flourishing and the Etruscan culture</p>
<p>was still prominent in Italy.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at the early contacts between these Celtic tribes and their neighbors.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the Celtic tribes were illiterate, but the Greeks and the Etruscans,</p>
<p>and the later Romans, they were literate.</p>
<p>They had written languages, and they also had writers and historians.</p>
<p>And since they encountered the Celts, and since their writers sometimes wrote about</p>
<p>the Celts, we can get a glimpse of these ancient Celtic people from these limited written accounts</p>
<p>which do exist.</p>
<p>But one of the problems we have is that we&rsquo;re getting the perspective of outsiders who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always have a positive view of the Celts.</p>
<p>So we have to keep that in mind as we review these writings.</p>
<p>It was in fact the Greeks who coined the term Celt.</p>
<p>The Greeks called these Central European tribes the Keltoi.</p>
<p>And some linguists believe that the term Keltoi may have simply been a generic term for the</p>
<p>people who they considered to be barbarians in the north.</p>
<p>So it may not have referred to any particular cultural or linguistic group.</p>
<p>Now the later Romans also encountered the same Celtic tribes as they ventured north</p>
<p>across the Alps into the heart of Europe.</p>
<p>But the Romans coined their own term for these people.</p>
<p>They called them the Galli.</p>
<p>And unlike the term used by the Greeks, which was probably more of a generic term, many</p>
<p>linguists believe that the Roman term Galli initially referred to a specific tribe.</p>
<p>But it eventually came to be used to describe the entire region, which they called Gallia,</p>
<p>and which we would come to know as Gaul.</p>
<p>And the area of Gaul roughly corresponds to modern France.</p>
<p>So the term Gauls can be a little confusing.</p>
<p>The Romans used it to refer to the people who inhabited the region of Gaul.</p>
<p>And these people were Celts.</p>
<p>But for the early Romans, they generally just called them Gauls.</p>
<p>But Julius Caesar did note that some of the Celts living in Gaul called themselves Celti.</p>
<p>So there does appear to be a connection between this word Celti and the Greek term Keltoi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the early Greeks and the Romans had each encountered the same tribe</p>
<p>or groups of tribes which used that term to refer to themselves.</p>
<p>But the major point here is that these terms, Celts and Gauls, they often get used interchangeably</p>
<p>by historians.</p>
<p>But technically speaking, the Gauls represented only a portion of the overall Celtic people</p>
<p>of Europe.</p>
<p>Now in 324 BC, the Greek explorer Pythias traveled all the way to the British Isles.</p>
<p>And he referred to Ireland and Britain as the Britannic Islands.</p>
<p>What the Celtic inhabitants referred to as the Britanni.</p>
<p>And the Britannic Islands became known as Britannia.</p>
<p>And eventually, in the hands of the Romans, it was called Britannia.</p>
<p>And according to Pythias, the Celtic residents of Britannia, they mined tin and iron, they</p>
<p>made pottery, they weaved cloth, and they raised large herds of cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>So this was an ancient culture that still resembled the original Indo-European culture</p>
<p>in many respects.</p>
<p>And speaking of the connection between the early Indo-Europeans and the ancient Celts,</p>
<p>they both revered horses and they placed them in very high regard.</p>
<p>The ancient Celts held annual parades and chariot races.</p>
<p>And in times of war, they fought on horseback and were especially skilled at using horses</p>
<p>in their cavalry.</p>
<p>In fact, the Celtic cavalry was capable of intimidating the Roman infantry.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until the Romans finally developed a disciplined, professional army that they</p>
<p>were able to routinely defeat the Celts in battle.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>And by the way, some historians believe that these ancient Celts invented horseshoes.</p>
<p>Remember the Celts were some of the first people of Europe to master the use of iron.</p>
<p>So what else did the Greeks and the Romans have to say about the Celts?</p>
<p>Well, they described the physical appearance of the Celts.</p>
<p>Supposedly, they were tall people and they were fair-haired.</p>
<p>So that means they had light-colored hair.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have unearthed graves with Celtic warriors and chiefs who were in excess</p>
<p>of six feet tall, which was very tall for that period of time.</p>
<p>They were also said to bear large mustaches with neck rings made of gold, silver and bronze.</p>
<p>They wore colorful clothing and they loved to fight in battle.</p>
<p>The colorful clothing attributed to these ancient Celts also provides a cultural and</p>
<p>historical link to modern tartan and plaid fabrics associated with Celtic societies.</p>
<p>And speaking of Celtic clothing, the Romans were amused by the fact that the Celts wore</p>
<p>pants instead of tunics.</p>
<p>And in fact, the word breeches, or as we say in the American South, britches, may have</p>
<p>been one of the oldest Celtic words in the English language.</p>
<p>That word actually predates Old English.</p>
<p>It goes all the way back to the original Germanic language spoken in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>But the ancient Celtic language had a very similar word.</p>
<p>The original Germanic word was something like broches.</p>
<p>And the Celtic word used in Gaul was bracha.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s believed that one of the tribes borrowed the word from the other.</p>
<p>And remember that by this point, the Celts and the Germanic tribes were neighbors and</p>
<p>sometimes rivals fighting for the same territory.</p>
<p>So words would have likely passed between them, both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>If the Germanic tribes borrowed it from the Celtic Gauls, then that would make it one</p>
<p>of the first Celtic words to arrive within English, or actually in this case, the ancestor</p>
<p>of English.</p>
<p>By the way, the Celtic term bracha passed into Latin after the Romans conquered Gaul</p>
<p>and eventually passed into French as braguette, which meant codpiece armor to protect the</p>
<p>crotch area.</p>
<p>And this word, braguette, eventually gave us the word bracket, due to some resemblance</p>
<p>in shape between early brackets and the French braguette.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound very comfortable, but think of the braguette as the connecting point between</p>
<p>the two legs.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the term bracket makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>Now according to these early Greek and Roman writers, women held many positions of equality</p>
<p>with men in Celtic culture.</p>
<p>They fought alongside men in battle, and they retained control of their personal possessions</p>
<p>after marriage.</p>
<p>They also wore makeup, and they placed their hair in braids.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve discussed what the Greeks and the Romans wrote about the Celts, but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>explore the relationship between them a little further.</p>
<p>First I mentioned in the last episode that Celtic tribes from Gaul crossed the Alps and</p>
<p>traveled down into northern Italy where they sacked the early city of Rome around 391 BC.</p>
<p>And I noted that it had a tremendous psychological impact on the Romans.</p>
<p>It shaped the way they viewed the Celts, or the Gauls, going forward.</p>
<p>The Romans basically viewed them as savage barbarians and as a lingering threat in the</p>
<p>north.</p>
<p>And following the conflicts with the Romans, some Celts moved to the east, into the Balkans</p>
<p>and eventually to Macedon and Thrace in modern day Greece.</p>
<p>About 25 years after Rome was sacked, there were reports of Celts fighting as mercenaries</p>
<p>in the wars between Sparta and Thebes in Greece.</p>
<p>And a few years later, in 335 BC, Alexander the Great fought a brief skirmish against</p>
<p>the Celtic tribe in the Danube Valley region to shore up the northern territory before</p>
<p>he moved on to Anatolia and the Middle East and eventually India.</p>
<p>So even Alexander had to deal with Celts on his northern border.</p>
<p>And in fact about a century later, well after the death of Alexander, and with Greek power</p>
<p>waning, another group of Celtic tribes invaded Greece and they sacked the city of Delphi.</p>
<p>Now this was around the time when the Romans were fighting the Punic Wars with Carthage</p>
<p>to gain control of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And I mentioned Hannibal&rsquo;s famous trek from Spain through southern Gaul and across the</p>
<p>Alps on his way into northern Italy.</p>
<p>Now this trek took Hannibal through Celtic territory in northern Spain and southern Gaul</p>
<p>‚Äì remember, that&rsquo;s modern France.</p>
<p>So along the way, Hannibal actually retained Celts as mercenaries in his army.</p>
<p>And large numbers of them fought as part of Hannibal&rsquo;s army against the Romans in Italy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that Hannibal had about 10,000 Celtic mercenaries from Spain alone.</p>
<p>So you can probably see why the Greeks and the Romans had a generally negative view of</p>
<p>the Celts.</p>
<p>And you can see why the Romans really wanted to eliminate this northern threat.</p>
<p>But this was barbarian territory to the Romans.</p>
<p>They mainly wanted security from the Celtic threat in Gaul, but that could only be accomplished</p>
<p>by actually conquering Gaul.</p>
<p>And up to this point, Rome had been occupied by its quest to conquer Italy and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Now at this point in history, in the 2nd century BC, western Europe can be roughly divided</p>
<p>into three distinct territories.</p>
<p>Around the Mediterranean was the Roman Republic, where Latin was spreading and becoming a lingua</p>
<p>franca, except in the east where Greek held on.</p>
<p>And far to the north were the Germanic tribes, which included the ancient ancestors of the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And this is where the early Germanic languages were being spoken.</p>
<p>But the vast territory in the middle was occupied by Celtic-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>And a series of events were about to transpire which would mark the beginning of the end</p>
<p>of the Celts as a distinct culture in continental Europe.</p>
<p>And it would pave the way for the Romans and the Germanic tribes to take over in these</p>
<p>Celtic areas.</p>
<p>Shortly after Rome began to establish trading posts up the Rhone River in Gaul, a situation</p>
<p>developed in northern Europe which caused a great deal of concern in Rome.</p>
<p>This was around 120 BC, and at this point, a group of tribes from Jutland and the North</p>
<p>Sea coast began to migrate southward, possibly as a result of a flash flood in their Jutland</p>
<p>homeland.</p>
<p>Now you may remember from way back in episode 3 that Jutland means home of the Jutes.</p>
<p>And the Jutes were part of the Anglo-Saxon tribes who brought Old English to Britain.</p>
<p>But since there were a lot more Angles and Saxons than there were Jutes, the Jutes didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get their name in that label.</p>
<p>But there were enough Jutes to establish their own territory which eventually became Kent</p>
<p>in England.</p>
<p>So a group of tribes from this region around Jutland in modern-day Denmark, they began</p>
<p>to move southward into southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>And this confederation of tribes was led by two specific tribes, the Teutons and the Cimbri.</p>
<p>Now remember Jutland is in modern Denmark, and it&rsquo;s the same region, as I said, that</p>
<p>produced the Jutes, a Germanic-speaking tribe.</p>
<p>So this is Germanic territory, not Celtic territory.</p>
<p>And in fact, the Teutons were a Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s debate about that other tribe, the Cimbri.</p>
<p>Based upon the location of their homeland, some historians think that they were also</p>
<p>a Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>But their name, Cimbri, is definitely Celtic, not Germanic.</p>
<p>And many of the tribal leaders also had Celtic names.</p>
<p>So most modern historians consider them to have been a Celtic tribe.</p>
<p>But it shows you how the distinction between Celtic and Germanic was sometimes blurred</p>
<p>in many of these areas.</p>
<p>To emphasize that point, the name of that Germanic tribe, the Teutons, it&rsquo;s the origin</p>
<p>of the modern term Teutonic, which is usually used as a term for things associated with</p>
<p>Germany.</p>
<p>But even though the Teutons were a Germanic tribe, their name actually comes from the</p>
<p>Celtic word for people, which was Teuto.</p>
<p>And initially it was applied to this unnamed Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>Over time, the term was applied by the Romans collectively to all of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But what about that term Germanic?</p>
<p>Well, it, too, comes from the name of a Celtic tribe which lived east of the Rhine known</p>
<p>as the Germani.</p>
<p>The Romans applied this term to all of the people who lived north and east of the Rhine.</p>
<p>However, many of those people were Germanic, not Celtic, because they spoke Germanic languages.</p>
<p>To the Romans, the distinction was largely irrelevant, because the Romans considered</p>
<p>them all to be barbarians.</p>
<p>But over time, the name Germania stuck with regard to the people who inhabited this region</p>
<p>beyond the Rhine.</p>
<p>So non-Celtic peoples in this region simply became known as the Germanic peoples.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s also the root of the modern word Germany.</p>
<p>So the great irony is that all of these terms which mean Germanic today, words like Teutonic</p>
<p>and Germanic in Germany, they are all of Celtic origin.</p>
<p>So you can see how these distinctions between Celtic and Germanic were often blurred, especially</p>
<p>from the perspective of the Romans who were often unconcerned about those distinctions.</p>
<p>So we have the two tribes, the Teutons and the Kimberi, both Germanic or both Celtic</p>
<p>or perhaps one of each, you take your pick.</p>
<p>But they were moving southeastward to the region around modern Hungary.</p>
<p>But then all of a sudden, around 113 BC, they turned westward, and they soon approached</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>And as they came closer to Italy, a Roman army intervened, but the Roman army was defeated</p>
<p>by those migrating tribes.</p>
<p>And then many of the citizens of Rome began to panic, as they began to think back to Rome</p>
<p>being sacked by the Celts from Gaul a couple of centuries earlier.</p>
<p>But these migrating tribes didn&rsquo;t move south into Italy.</p>
<p>Instead they continued to move westward into Gaul.</p>
<p>And the Romans could actually breathe a sigh of relief for a while, as they were apparently</p>
<p>spared by those barbarian tribes.</p>
<p>And the Romans actually continued to engage those tribes in Gaul for the next few years,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really have any success against them.</p>
<p>And eventually, for some reason, the Teutons and the Kimberi decided to divide their armies.</p>
<p>And the old divide and conquer strategy finally came to the Romans&rsquo; rescue.</p>
<p>The Roman legions finally defeated the Teutons in southern Gaul in 102 BC, and they defeated</p>
<p>the Kimberi tribe in northern Italy in 101 BC.</p>
<p>But the Celtic threat didn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>By this point, the Germanic tribes in northern Europe were expanding southward into the Celtic</p>
<p>territory.</p>
<p>And in the east, the new kingdom of Dacia, formed in the Balkans, well, it was expanding</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>And a Celtic tribe in Switzerland, called the Helvetii, outgrew its homeland, and it</p>
<p>began to spread westward as well.</p>
<p>And all of this expansion on the northern and eastern sides of the Celtic lands was</p>
<p>having a domino effect.</p>
<p>And it was pushing more and more Celtic tribes westward and southward into the fringes of</p>
<p>the Roman territory.</p>
<p>And skirmishes were starting to break out between the Celtic tribes on the northern</p>
<p>border of Rome.</p>
<p>Now all of this uncertainty and instability caused more and more concern within Rome itself.</p>
<p>The Romans already had a deep fear of the Celtic tribes since the initial sacking of</p>
<p>Rome.</p>
<p>And now the fear of invasion was a frightening reality.</p>
<p>The stage was set for someone who could take advantage of the situation by leading a Roman</p>
<p>expedition against the Celtic tribes and delivering peace and security to Rome.</p>
<p>And when Rome had such a person, his name was Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>Now Julius Caesar was an aspiring politician looking for a great propaganda victory to</p>
<p>match the exploits of his rival Pompey who had acquired territory for Rome in the east.</p>
<p>And Gaul was an obvious target.</p>
<p>Now Caesar also had a professional army which he needed to keep employed.</p>
<p>So in 59 BC Caesar steered a special law through the Roman Senate which gave him a five-year</p>
<p>command over Gaul.</p>
<p>He argued that the Germanic tribes to the far north were beginning to threaten the states</p>
<p>allied with Rome in the region of Gaul.</p>
<p>And he said that Gaul would either become Roman or it would be overrun by those Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And the next year he began his conquest of Gaul.</p>
<p>He began by attacking the Helvetii tribe which I mentioned earlier, which had been expanding</p>
<p>into Gaul from its homeland in modern day Switzerland.</p>
<p>And he defeated the Helvetii and then he focused his efforts in northern Gaul and he finally</p>
<p>subdued the tribes there.</p>
<p>Now Caesar completed his conquest of Gaul, at least temporarily, in 55 BC.</p>
<p>Estimates, some based on Caesar&rsquo;s own accounts, are that hundreds of thousands of Celts, perhaps</p>
<p>more than a million, were killed as a result of Caesar&rsquo;s conquest.</p>
<p>It was a nasty and brutal business.</p>
<p>But everything didn&rsquo;t go well for Caesar.</p>
<p>In that same year, 55 BC, Caesar attempted to invade Britain for the first time with</p>
<p>two legions.</p>
<p>But the conquest of Britain turned out to be a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>Britain was considered the very edge of the Roman world.</p>
<p>And you had to get there by boat which was never really the forte of the Romans.</p>
<p>Now this first invasion was really more of an expedition.</p>
<p>The Romans didn&rsquo;t intend to establish a permanent settlement there.</p>
<p>It was partly a show of force to discourage the British Celts from supporting their fellow</p>
<p>Celts in Gaul who they routinely traded with and aided.</p>
<p>Now except for a few skirmishes with some southern Celts, the expedition didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have any military consequences.</p>
<p>But a year later, in 54 BC, Caesar tried again.</p>
<p>And this second invasion of Britain was a proper invasion with intentions of establishing</p>
<p>a permanent Roman settlement there.</p>
<p>But the native Celts were prepared this time.</p>
<p>And Caesar fought the Celts in Britain but he could never secure a decisive victory there</p>
<p>after three months of fighting.</p>
<p>And at this time, there was a revolt of Celtic tribes back in Gaul.</p>
<p>So Caesar withdrew from Britain to deal with the uprising in Gaul.</p>
<p>And he never returned to Britain.</p>
<p>And Britain would remain outside of the Roman Empire for almost another century until the</p>
<p>Emperor Claudius finally returned to conquer Britain for Rome.</p>
<p>Now this revolt that was happening back in Gaul was a very big deal.</p>
<p>Remember that the various Celtic tribes shared some common cultural characteristics but there</p>
<p>was no political cohesion there.</p>
<p>They were more likely to fight against each other than unify as a common military force.</p>
<p>And this gets back to the divide and conquer approach which the Romans used to great effect</p>
<p>against the Celts.</p>
<p>But now, in 53 BC, they had finally started to unite under a single leader named Vercingetorix.</p>
<p>And Vercingetorix was the chieftain of a tribe in central Gaul.</p>
<p>He had encouraged the various Celtic tribes to unify against the Romans.</p>
<p>And he soon emerged as the supreme military commander of the Celts.</p>
<p>And as the leader, he actually burned Celtic towns and crops to prevent the Romans from</p>
<p>accessing the food.</p>
<p>And he adopted guerrilla tactics to interrupt and cut off Roman supplies.</p>
<p>His rebellion was initially successful against the Roman army and their Germanic mercenaries.</p>
<p>But the Romans eventually got the upper hand due to their superior discipline and organization.</p>
<p>And the Romans were finally able to surround Vercingetorix and force him to surrender.</p>
<p>And this effectively marked the end of any real Celtic threat to Roman power in Gaul.</p>
<p>Now Caesar&rsquo;s conquest of Gaul had taken eight years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredibly short period of time to conquer such a large territory.</p>
<p>And needless to say, it was a huge political victory for Caesar.</p>
<p>But politics is a messy business.</p>
<p>And Caesar&rsquo;s political rival back in Rome, remember, was Pompey.</p>
<p>And Pompey recognized what Caesar&rsquo;s victory meant for Caesar, and therefore meant for</p>
<p>Pompey himself.</p>
<p>Now technically, Caesar&rsquo;s term as the governor of Gaul had expired.</p>
<p>So Pompey was able to get the Roman Senate to order Caesar to disband his army and return</p>
<p>to Rome.</p>
<p>But Caesar was having none of it.</p>
<p>Pompey had accused Caesar of insubordination and treason.</p>
<p>And Caesar suspected that he would be prosecuted if he returned to Rome as a civilian.</p>
<p>So he took his army and headed for Rome with his army in tow.</p>
<p>And in 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, which was the northern boundary of Roman territory</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>Now, by crossing this river, Caesar was entering Rome with his own army in violation of the</p>
<p>Senate&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>And for Caesar, crossing the river was basically a point of no return.</p>
<p>He knew that it would mean civil war.</p>
<p>And this is where we get the modern English phrase, crossing the Rubicon, to mean going</p>
<p>beyond the point of no return.</p>
<p>Now civil war in Rome did ensue, and Caesar emerged victorious.</p>
<p>He also emerged as the dictator of Rome in 48 BC.</p>
<p>And we can now start to speak of the Roman Empire as opposed to the earlier Roman Republic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk a lot more about Caesar and the Roman Empire in the next episode.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s turn our attention back to Gaul, because that&rsquo;s the focus of this episode.</p>
<p>Now, after the Romans finally subdued the Celts in Gaul, the Celts there were largely</p>
<p>assimilated into the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Rome began an extended period of Romanization, which I described a little bit in the last</p>
<p>episode.</p>
<p>Now, Rome promoted trade and farming and industry within Gaul.</p>
<p>But the most important part of this story for our purposes is that the native Celtic</p>
<p>languages began to disappear in Gaul, and Latin gradually began to replace those languages.</p>
<p>The Latin dialect spoken in this region would eventually evolve into an early form of French.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve noted throughout this podcast series, this was the avenue by which English</p>
<p>inherited a very large portion of its modern vocabulary.</p>
<p>The Latin words evolved into French and then passed into English with the Norman invasion</p>
<p>of England in 1066.</p>
<p>So the Roman conquest of Gaul was a crucial event in the overall story of English.</p>
<p>But what about those Celtic languages that were now being replaced by Latin?</p>
<p>What was the long-term impact of those languages on English?</p>
<p>The answer is not very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned a few Celtic words that have found their way into English.</p>
<p>But the fact is that most of the Celtic tribes were eventually conquered by the Romans in</p>
<p>the west and by the Germanic tribes in the north and east.</p>
<p>They were basically caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>And after the Celts were conquered in continental Europe, their languages largely disappeared.</p>
<p>Of course, the Celts held on in the British Isles, at least for a while, until the Romans</p>
<p>returned there under Claudius.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll look at that part of the story next time.</p>
<p>So there was some Celtic influence on English from the lingering Celtic languages which</p>
<p>were still being spoken when the Anglo-Saxons arrived in Britain.</p>
<p>And of course, some of those languages have held on to this very day in places like Ireland</p>
<p>and Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>So there was some limited Celtic influence on English when the Anglo-Saxons encountered</p>
<p>those Celts in Britain.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll address those influences when we get to the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>The other Celtic influence on English comes in the form of a few words used by those continental</p>
<p>Celts in Gaul which were adopted by the Romans and the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And a few of those words have found their way into modern English through Latin or through</p>
<p>the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned a few words like britches and bracket, Teutonic and Germanic, all of</p>
<p>which have roots in the ancient Celtic languages of Gaul.</p>
<p>We also get lots of place names from the original Celts.</p>
<p>For example, the names of London and Paris are both rooted in Celtic names, as is the</p>
<p>Thames River which runs through London and the River Seine which runs through Paris.</p>
<p>And since Gaul eventually evolved into the territory we know today as France, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>surprising that we can find a fair amount of Celtic words in modern French.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that there are about 500 Celtic words in modern French, and there may actually</p>
<p>be quite a bit more than that.</p>
<p>But what about English?</p>
<p>Well, the Latin word bulga, meaning a leather bag or knapsack, came from a Celtic term used</p>
<p>in Gaul.</p>
<p>And the word came into English from French as baguette, and later becoming budget.</p>
<p>It originally retained its meaning as a small bag, then a leather purse or wallet, then</p>
<p>it came to mean the collection of papers in the wallet, and much later in the 18th century</p>
<p>it came to be used in its sense as a financial record or document today.</p>
<p>So budget comes from Celtic origins.</p>
<p>And the Old English word riche, which is the original version of our modern word rich,</p>
<p>also came from Celtic origins.</p>
<p>I mentioned this word back in the episode I did on the letter C. Well, this word riche</p>
<p>was almost certainly borrowed from the Celts by the early Germanic tribes on the continent</p>
<p>before they migrated to Britain.</p>
<p>The word meant kingdom in Old English, and it&rsquo;s directly connected to the Germanic word</p>
<p>reich, as in third reich.</p>
<p>It eventually came to also serve as an adjective, meaning rich or powerful, and that&rsquo;s the sense</p>
<p>that we have it today.</p>
<p>So again, the word riche comes to us indirectly from these ancient Celts.</p>
<p>Another very common English word which comes from these Celts is the word car.</p>
<p>And this word comes from early Roman contact with the Celts.</p>
<p>The Celts in Gaul had used the term for their war chariots, and Julius Caesar borrowed the</p>
<p>term during his wars there.</p>
<p>The term passed through Latin and French before finally making it into English.</p>
<p>And the English word bin, B-I-N, as in trash bin, may have come from a word used by the</p>
<p>Celts in Gaul as well.</p>
<p>The word was bin, and it was a type of cart which usually carried a woven wicker form</p>
<p>which was made to look like a person.</p>
<p>And these forms may have been used to contain bodies that were sacrificed by burning.</p>
<p>And the term was adopted into Middle English to mean crib or manger.</p>
<p>And it eventually came to mean a type of storage container.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s the sense that we have it today, as in trash bin.</p>
<p>Now beyond those words, we get a few words from the Celts in Britain after the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>arrived there.</p>
<p>A word like ass, for example, was probably adopted from a Celtic word by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s estimated that no more than a dozen or so Celtic words, other than place names,</p>
<p>were adopted by the Anglo-Saxons prior to the Norman invasion.</p>
<p>So in terms of vocabulary, Celtic influence on English is very limited.</p>
<p>Now there may be some Celtic influences on English grammar, but again, I&rsquo;ll deal with</p>
<p>that topic when we get to Old English and the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Now I should re-emphasize the fact that Celtic languages are still being spoken in parts</p>
<p>of the British Isles and northern France.</p>
<p>And a few of those words have passed into English mainly during the late Middle Ages</p>
<p>and thereafter.</p>
<p>This includes words like bard, bog, glen, banshee, flannel, clan, whiskey, plaid, lock,</p>
<p>galore, brogue, shamrock, and leprechaun.</p>
<p>There was also a Gaelic term which combined the Gaelic words for war and cry.</p>
<p>It was something like slraigam, like I don&rsquo;t speak Gaelic so sorry for butchering that,</p>
<p>but it literally meant war cry or shout of the troops.</p>
<p>And it was the rallying cry of a Celtic chieftain in battle, and it was used in the middle of</p>
<p>a battle to rally the troops and bring them together.</p>
<p>And it came into modern English as the word slogan in the 1700s.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s about it for Celtic influences on English vocabulary.</p>
<p>But as I said earlier, the biggest impact of this episode on the overall story of English</p>
<p>is the fact that much of Western Europe was now under Roman control, and that meant the</p>
<p>spread of Latin.</p>
<p>So next time I&rsquo;m going to look at this later period of Roman history and the large number</p>
<p>of Latin words from this period which have found their way into modern English.</p>
<p>This is also the story of the Roman conquest of Britain and the rise of the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>in the north.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be setting the stage for the fall of Rome and the Germanic invasions of Europe.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
