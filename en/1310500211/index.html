    <p>The following is a conversation with Chris Duffin, the mad scientist of strength.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the strongest people in the world, but is also an engineer of some of the most</p>
<p>innovative strength equipment I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Check out his company Kabuki Strength.</p>
<p>He is the only person who squatted and deadlifted 1000 pounds for multiple reps, and achieved</p>
<p>many other amazing feats of strength.</p>
<p>He has lived one hell of a life of hardship and triumph, as he writes about in his book</p>
<p>called The Eagle and the Dragon.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Headspace, Magic Spoon, Sun Basket, and Ladder.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I was always a fan of strength, both powerlifting and Olympic</p>
<p>weightlifting, both as a fan and practitioner.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;m a fan of people who are willing to put in years of hard work towards finding</p>
<p>out what the limits of their body is, and then smashing past those limits.</p>
<p>People like Chris Duffin, or on the Olympic weightlifting side, people like Dmitri Klokov.</p>
<p>That guy is great.</p>
<p>This is why I love watching the Olympics, both the heartbreaks and the triumphs.</p>
<p>They all reveal the incredible heights that the human mind and the human body can reach.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Chris Duffin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a part of several incredible feats of strength.</p>
<p>Which was the hardest, or maybe one you&rsquo;re most proud of?</p>
<p>Definitely the one I&rsquo;m most proud of is that journey for the grand goals.</p>
<p>It was like a five year scope that I chased this.</p>
<p>And so when you think about training, it took more than five years, obviously.</p>
<p>By that point, I&rsquo;d been training for over 25 years.</p>
<p>But it makes me proud.</p>
<p>I mean, there were three distinct things that I wanted to accomplish out of this.</p>
<p>So it was really thought out.</p>
<p>And this was kind of my exit from being a competitive lifter.</p>
<p>And basically saying, hey, I&rsquo;m going to be an Instagram lifter, an exhibition lifter,</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this for 16 years, I was number one in the world for like eight years straight,</p>
<p>all time world records.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not going to do that anymore.</p>
<p>What I want to do is just something deep down to me that is really important.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s three things that were driving this.</p>
<p>And this is a five year journey that I went through to do this.</p>
<p>I really wanted to showcase that you could do something that is well beyond the scope</p>
<p>of what people think is humanly possible.</p>
<p>So just this inspiration thing, this grand over the top, like if you set your mind to</p>
<p>a single minded goal, you can go so much further.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even say what the goal was upfront, because it was so far out there, I would have</p>
<p>been laughed at.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think big goals should be kept pretty damn close to start with for that reason</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>But and then the second piece was to walk the walk to show like the principles of what</p>
<p>I believed in around human movement, the ability to manage and control the spinal mechanics</p>
<p>and the output that can have on the body.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to take the two most basic movements that every able bodied person should</p>
<p>be able to do.</p>
<p>So fundamental movement patterns, the squat, which is like, in the developmental approach</p>
<p>is around nine months as a baby from a developmental kinesiology standpoint, and a really basic</p>
<p>pattern that every able bodied person should be able to master the other one being the</p>
<p>hip hinge, being able to pick something up off the ground, a deadlift.</p>
<p>And I wanted to do those two, not just one, because I wanted to show the principles that</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t built for one, I wasn&rsquo;t a specialist because of my lever links, torso links, all</p>
<p>that, any outliers, because nobody had ever done a thousand pound squat.</p>
<p>So this is it is and a thousand pound deadlift.</p>
<p>It was outside of the scope of what anybody&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s like half a dozen people that have</p>
<p>done one or the other, but nobody&rsquo;s ever done both.</p>
<p>And I wanted to do something unique.</p>
<p>I wanted to do them, not only do it, but do them for reps to leave literally no question</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no competition for that.</p>
<p>So it was this is what I&rsquo;m going to go do.</p>
<p>And to pull it off, I had some past issues with my elbows and stuff that I couldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>So I had to wear straps, which was another reason I couldn&rsquo;t do it in the competition</p>
<p>setting.</p>
<p>So the first year I worked up and I did a thousand and two pound deadlift plates were</p>
<p>weighed afterwards.</p>
<p>It was a couple a little bit over and I did it for almost three reps.</p>
<p>And that still stands as a Guinness world record.</p>
<p>Just the one rep does is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted.</p>
<p>And one other person has deadlifted a thousand for reps at this point.</p>
<p>And that was a Thor Bjornsson from Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a thousand for a double as well.</p>
<p>So then the next four years and I did a bunch of feats of strength on the way, but it was</p>
<p>all about building that axial loading capacity, the strength that because now I&rsquo;m moving the</p>
<p>weight from my hands up to my shoulders.</p>
<p>And so to do it for reps is like so much harder than a single like five to 10 seconds versus</p>
<p>30 plus seconds to be able to buffer and manage all that with that kind of load is just crazy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally about the duration that your body is carrying the load.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you have to you&rsquo;re using the resource of the diaphragm for stabilization.</p>
<p>And so it it&rsquo;s also responsible for respiration and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>So even when you&rsquo;re not squatting, you&rsquo;ve got to be handling those loads.</p>
<p>Just holding that weight is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s fascinating that the human body can do that, can can maintain that structure,</p>
<p>just everything working together, that the biology, the skeletal structure, the the musculature</p>
<p>on top of that can hold the weight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>Everything is very intentful about positioning and how you&rsquo;re creating pressure and all this</p>
<p>sort of stuff, especially for me.</p>
<p>So when I mentioned that half a dozen people have squatted it and half a dozen people have</p>
<p>deadlifted it.</p>
<p>You understand those people all weigh three hundred and eighty to four hundred and forty</p>
<p>pounds.</p>
<p>I weighed to sixty five to two eighty five, depending on where I was between the two.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that as well.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So big, big difference.</p>
<p>And over the course of that, I did a lot of other feats of strength that fit in that capacity.</p>
<p>And we can skip over those.</p>
<p>But that was hugely invested as far as, you know, what I put into being able to accomplish</p>
<p>that, because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s over the top, which means the other stuff had to shift and I had</p>
<p>to learn.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that came into place to pull that off.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, last March, two days before the world shut down, I did it.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be at the largest equipment exhibition in the world down in San Diego</p>
<p>as an event.</p>
<p>And that got shut down a week beforehand, obviously.</p>
<p>So we moved to let&rsquo;s do it in my gym and invite people.</p>
<p>And that was on a Saturday and Thursday or Friday, they limited it to twenty five people</p>
<p>for gatherings.</p>
<p>I did it on Saturday and then Monday, everything shut down.</p>
<p>So it was kind of surreal for timing wise.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so if I hadn&rsquo;t done it, it would have never got done like because I I&rsquo;d pushed to</p>
<p>the limit.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t come back and do it.</p>
<p>It was at the total limitation of my capabilities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty I&rsquo;m pretty proud of it.</p>
<p>And the last piece was a every one of these feats along the way.</p>
<p>I collaborated with a charity that I believed in.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of those tied to my life story, which we probably will get into.</p>
<p>So it was threefold.</p>
<p>So that inspiration piece, inspiration, motivation, walking the walk and showing like just these</p>
<p>methodologies that a guy that had to learn to walk again can do something like this with</p>
<p>no back pain.</p>
<p>So if you if you there is a way.</p>
<p>And the third one is is to provide awareness and recognition around a lot of key charities.</p>
<p>So so your heart was in this journey, but also your mind is just you&rsquo;re like a scholar</p>
<p>of strength, a scientist of strength, an engineer of strength for reps do a thousand pounds</p>
<p>squat and deadlift.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk through the actual day you did it.</p>
<p>What does it take to lift that much for reps?</p>
<p>The day of is really easy.</p>
<p>The really the lift itself.</p>
<p>Other than a few seconds is really easy and not challenging.</p>
<p>People always ask me, what was it like?</p>
<p>How beat up were you after that?</p>
<p>And the deadlift.</p>
<p>And the simple fact is, it was easy.</p>
<p>The work to get there was horrendous.</p>
<p>So so even the psychology of the day you weren&rsquo;t there was not a fear.</p>
<p>There was not a nervousness.</p>
<p>There is not a doubt in your mind.</p>
<p>There were certainly doubts on that day from some training history.</p>
<p>So there was some major breaks to my confidence in the couple months leading up where I had</p>
<p>issues with passing out under the bar.</p>
<p>So completely losing consciousness.</p>
<p>And this was on weight less than a thousand pounds even.</p>
<p>So that was like all this buildup in me going, what if what if I think I have this resolved?</p>
<p>But what if I get up there and I can&rsquo;t even do a rep?</p>
<p>How embarrassing will this be that I&rsquo;ve been talking about this and planning for this for</p>
<p>so long?</p>
<p>But outside of that, I knew I could do it.</p>
<p>In fact, I wanted to do even more even up to the second rep.</p>
<p>Training is about, you know, working into a fatigue state.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re building an amount of fatigue in your system.</p>
<p>And then when you let off of it, that&rsquo;s when you get a compensation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you stairstep training.</p>
<p>This is periodization.</p>
<p>But leading into a big event, you&rsquo;re accumulating this massive amount of fatigue.</p>
<p>And so I was performing at a level that I could do it.</p>
<p>And so I knew I was going to be able to on me because then you then you give yourself</p>
<p>that window to be able to recover and supercompensate and be able to do a little bit more.</p>
<p>So like that first rep when I did it strengthwise, I went, I could do this for five reps like</p>
<p>it went through my head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like feeling I mean, it was easy and it was fast and it felt like amazing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to crush this.</p>
<p>And then set rep to the realization kicked in as like, oh, this is for reps with a thousand</p>
<p>pounds on your back.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re fatiguing just like and then the third one was every last thing I could muster</p>
<p>to just finish.</p>
<p>I mean, I just barely got it done because it&rsquo;s the strength is like there.</p>
<p>But like that capacity to be able to manage all those resources for that amount of time</p>
<p>because not just leg strength when we&rsquo;re talking about this stuff.</p>
<p>So what does it take to go from the from I don&rsquo;t know what like from five hundred to</p>
<p>a thousand?</p>
<p>That feels like a journey that&rsquo;s like exponential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it gets exponentially harder.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, like I said, I started lifting in 1988.</p>
<p>But my first meet in the early 2000s, my my max deadlift was five twenty three and my</p>
<p>first squat was five hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the heck of a journey.</p>
<p>It is a journey for people that like to lift.</p>
<p>What should they understand about the difference between doing five hundred and a thousand in</p>
<p>terms of the actual lift that you were experiencing that day in terms of the mechanics, in terms</p>
<p>of all the things you have to be like the neurological adaptation?</p>
<p>You mentioned the breathing, the core strength, like techniques, like little tricks, psychological</p>
<p>tricks, anything that kind of stands out to you.</p>
<p>The level of intent and the opportunity for error are at a different level.</p>
<p>So just the minutest changes of position by quarter inch, half inch can be make or break</p>
<p>at that level.</p>
<p>So these things, everything gets amplified.</p>
<p>So the ability to start with having the pelvis just in the right orientation to the diaphragm</p>
<p>before we start initiating what we call the the eccentric loading of the abdominal cavity</p>
<p>to create this intra abdominal pressure of working against this outward expansion, working</p>
<p>against the outer sheath of abdominal thoracolumbar musculature obliques, causing the co contraction</p>
<p>at the pelvic floor, all this stuff and how you cue that because you can&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>all this stuff.</p>
<p>You need to break it down and distill and practice to like it&rsquo;s one simple cue that</p>
<p>we now lock down and control this torso stability because this is what these fundamental movements</p>
<p>are about, is being able to control our spinal mechanics and then now be able to maintain</p>
<p>that while articulating the joints around that through a range of motion and then using</p>
<p>the main power drivers.</p>
<p>So in this instance, both instances, it&rsquo;s the, you know, the hip complex to generate</p>
<p>that power and transfer it from how we&rsquo;re rooted and connected to the floor through</p>
<p>to the distal end, you know, which would be the barbell on the shoulder.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a couple key concepts.</p>
<p>So one is that what we just talked through is how to actually maintain that stability.</p>
<p>So if you have either the diaphragm, so which is connected at the rib cage.</p>
<p>So out of alignment in any position, it needs to be in alignment with the pelvic, the pelvis.</p>
<p>So those two in opposition.</p>
<p>So this is simple engineering here because what we&rsquo;re going to do is eccentrically load</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to use the diaphragm just like you would in a diaphragm pump where it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to press down on all the tissue in there.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not using breath.</p>
<p>So our breath was actually a lot of times a default pattern when people do that because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll bring it into their chest and raise their rib cage.</p>
<p>So what we want to do is just initiate the diaphragm air can be used as well over the</p>
<p>top at the final to create just a little bit more downward pressure.</p>
<p>But if we have out of alignment there, we have a pressure leak where it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>push out the front or the rear if you&rsquo;re either inflection or extension.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then that causes this co contraction and all this pressure of the organs essentially</p>
<p>against outward against all those tissue for the co contraction as well as surrounding</p>
<p>the spine to be able to stabilize that.</p>
<p>And then it puts all the muscles on both sides of the body in what we call the best length</p>
<p>tension relationship.</p>
<p>So if you think about a curl and we reach our arm out at the extended length, our bicep</p>
<p>is not as strong and then all the way in the curl position, it&rsquo;s not in strong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somewhere in here that&rsquo;s this control of both.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re sitting there arched or bent over, we have muscles that are past either</p>
<p>one of those ranges.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got a lot of tension, which then will create relaxation on the other side.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we want to have an all of that needs to be working.</p>
<p>And now the next important thing is the foot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually this connection to the ground and how we&rsquo;re actually using the foot and</p>
<p>ankle complex to grab and grip this connection to the ground and elicit an effect.</p>
<p>And because of this and then the everything between will naturally kind of do what it</p>
<p>needs to do.</p>
<p>So people like to focus on it, knee position or how far out their hips are or all this</p>
<p>other stuff, which is outputs of this.</p>
<p>So if we control the torso and the knee, the only thing that can happen from that point</p>
<p>is for the squat to happen.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this allows us to use this massive, you know, the hip complex for all the muscles</p>
<p>around that that are built to drive through hip extension to complete the squat.</p>
<p>I did actually miss one thing in there.</p>
<p>So this torso people often miss the lat is a spinal stabilizer as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s key in controlling function at the the T.L. Junction, which is just above the</p>
<p>lumbar spine.</p>
<p>So kind of right opposite where your sternum is and you&rsquo;ll see people kind of roll over</p>
<p>sometimes like an Olympic squad or something like that, where they lose position.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s often because they&rsquo;re close grip because you can&rsquo;t engage the lats very well</p>
<p>that way and they&rsquo;re pushing up in the bar.</p>
<p>But you want to be able to drive and pull the bar to your center.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to create and use the lats now to drive and connect the shoulder into</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of compressing and tightening all this stuff towards that center to create that</p>
<p>entire torso stability.</p>
<p>So I was using torso stability, not just core stability in my conversation earlier.</p>
<p>Torsus.</p>
<p>OK, so there&rsquo;s all these like modules of the body then connected to the grounding with</p>
<p>like your feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;re speaking to.</p>
<p>How do you work each of those modules?</p>
<p>Is this over time you kind of develop the feel that ultimately boils down to this one</p>
<p>simple cue that you mentioned?</p>
<p>Or do you can you like literally study each particular module in yourself and see how</p>
<p>it affects the lift?</p>
<p>So the best way and I believe it&rsquo;s because I hate just like people getting out and just</p>
<p>doing just movement stuff and not actually adding load because we only adapt when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>load.</p>
<p>Maybe we can get some, you know, some proprioception or awareness of position and other stuff,</p>
<p>doing some some corrective patterns and other stuff.</p>
<p>But this is basic physiology is that there must be an imposed demand for us to have adaptation.</p>
<p>And this is mental.</p>
<p>This is emotional.</p>
<p>This is all these areas.</p>
<p>But and people miss that.</p>
<p>So I prefer to be able to look at a person and this is our methodology and do the assessment</p>
<p>in any basic loaded movement.</p>
<p>So with developing an eye for that, you can actually see and go, OK, we&rsquo;ve got a fault</p>
<p>pattern right here in the foot and use a cue or a set of cues.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter till we find the one that works and bring that.</p>
<p>And now we know we want to simplify this stuff.</p>
<p>I just walk through.</p>
<p>That sounds really complicated.</p>
<p>And it it is if we try to break down and distill it all.</p>
<p>But like, let&rsquo;s just find the basic stuff that gets us in the range, start working and</p>
<p>then find the next as we add load.</p>
<p>Now we find where&rsquo;s our next area that we&rsquo;re starting to fault that and then go there again</p>
<p>next.</p>
<p>So this is what we do, what we teach in our educational platform.</p>
<p>So we are the only I believe everybody wants to do a lot of these like assessments, you</p>
<p>know, on a bench, on a table body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go squat.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go deadlift.</p>
<p>If you do strongman and it&rsquo;s a yoke carry, let&rsquo;s yoke carry because these are basic human</p>
<p>fundamentals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not powerlifting like this is how we function.</p>
<p>This is why we we work with 29 of the 30 major league baseball teams and 90 percent of all</p>
<p>professional sports out there in North America.</p>
<p>Sorry, although we do some work with Tour de France and other stuff as well.</p>
<p>And North America, I do mean hockey, too.</p>
<p>But these principles like, you know, if if the Dodgers won&rsquo;t bring us in, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>learning how to power lift.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re going to obviously will probably be do we do a little bit more shoulder focus</p>
<p>than hip focus with their athletes or their coaches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re usually working with the coaches, not the athletes.</p>
<p>And so you help them.</p>
<p>And then the same thing on yourself to understand the role that these different muscle groups</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>On the holistic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about getting the joints in the appropriate position so that we can do that.</p>
<p>We can manage load so that we&rsquo;re not putting undue stress on the joint.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting the proper link tension.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting these basic fundamental things with the body.</p>
<p>And so the the largest global impact that you will have is through spinal mechanics.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look at a shoulder if I&rsquo;m not managing this because it&rsquo;s your spine.</p>
<p>So for those who are just listening, like I&rsquo;m arching and then and then flexing, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to affect shoulder extension, flexion, all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>So it could even affect things down of what&rsquo;s looking at dorsiflexion issues on the foot.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s why I go to the foot next, because it has the second largest global impact.</p>
<p>And then from there, now I&rsquo;m going to look at the big energy drivers, which is the hip</p>
<p>complex, shoulder complex.</p>
<p>And then we can start looking at kind of the peripheral things.</p>
<p>But usually that&rsquo;s some sort of output of the other.</p>
<p>But the knees, the elbows, the things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about getting the stack, which affects neurology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk in engineering terms.</p>
<p>You get in a car, modern car today, and a lot of them will have this traction control</p>
<p>button in there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big misconception that, you know, I&rsquo;m out and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s snowy or here</p>
<p>in Austin, only rainy.</p>
<p>Well, it probably doesn&rsquo;t rain much, but you&rsquo;re going around a corner, start slipping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s going to send the powers from the wheels that are slipping to the ones</p>
<p>that are gripping and keep me from crashing and dying a fiery death.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exact same.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got we&rsquo;ve got the we&rsquo;ve got the tires, which are our foot, you know, the connection</p>
<p>to the ground.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the power driver, which is, you know, the the engine, the transmission delivering,</p>
<p>you know, the power through it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got the stability or suspension.</p>
<p>And then we have the neurology.</p>
<p>And what the neurology is doing, it&rsquo;s sensing that we don&rsquo;t have good stability or loss</p>
<p>of connection somewhere.</p>
<p>And so I need to save you from crashing and hurting yourself.</p>
<p>And so it goes to the engine and says, let&rsquo;s retard the timing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s reduce the shift patterns.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just reducing the power output.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s straight how the human body works.</p>
<p>So when I do this stuff, it&rsquo;s actually affecting that.</p>
<p>I mean, I can take somebody and do some minute changes with the neck position at the thoracic</p>
<p>outlet.</p>
<p>OK, and immediately see an enhancement in power output.</p>
<p>And I can measure it.</p>
<p>We measure this stuff with velocity devices and see like a 10 percent jump.</p>
<p>And so think about that.</p>
<p>What about all your training through the years where you actually had additional capacity?</p>
<p>But you weren&rsquo;t using it because your traction control was on.</p>
<p>Now you figure this out stuff and now you start stacking it.</p>
<p>Now you can see so much greater.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just injury prevention.</p>
<p>This is performance and additive performance over time.</p>
<p>This is huge.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t really think about this stuff.</p>
<p>But we can turn that stuff off, which is actually going to also, again, make us make us safer.</p>
<p>But what we want to do is the performance tuned race car.</p>
<p>Do they have a traction control button?</p>
<p>No, they got some amazing tires to grip the ground, a performance tuned suspension, and</p>
<p>that driver is going to put what his foot to the metal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to put it to the floor.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s a performance vehicle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want to be.</p>
<p>I want to continue on that line.</p>
<p>But first I have to ask, like, how did it feel to accomplish the grand goal?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>OK, when you just stand back.</p>
<p>Oh, my thousand pounds for reps.</p>
<p>What it feel like?</p>
<p>Anybody can go watch the video online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well filmed, by the way.</p>
<p>Got me all like excited.</p>
<p>Oh, well, the movies.</p>
<p>So we actually have the final footage of that, the good footage not posted yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally just an Instagram video or a phone video right now.</p>
<p>The only one online.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dramatic.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Came out just time to the music perfectly, too, which is I listened to some odd music,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s some reason behind that.</p>
<p>OK, but I liked it, though.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s full length footage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a documentary that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s got a little slowed because of covid, because it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a backstory of the eagle and the dragon.</p>
<p>My book about why I do kind of the things that I&rsquo;ve done in my life or that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming the director is working on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have the control of the movie, right?</p>
<p>But but OK, but the video&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>How did it feel?</p>
<p>I started crying.</p>
<p>It was overwhelming to have worked so intensely and so long and hard at something that pushed</p>
<p>every ounce of me to the limit that and and I did it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a little emotional.</p>
<p>I did exactly what I said I was going to fucking do like and it was it was overpowering.</p>
<p>I mean, I was just crying uncontrollably just with a mixture of I.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the mixture of emotions is hard to explain because it was the completion</p>
<p>of something.</p>
<p>It was a new phase of my life.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many things here.</p>
<p>So when you set an impossible goal and you accomplished it, one, two is like on the broader</p>
<p>humanity aspect, like how many humans in this world accomplish perfection in a particular</p>
<p>direction required to do this?</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re basically representing like one little like like little glimmer of excellence</p>
<p>of the human spirit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always more.</p>
<p>So understand this is a basic fundamental.</p>
<p>You can always do better.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as perfection.</p>
<p>You could always there is always more.</p>
<p>So anytime you reach something, any amazing workout or accomplishment in life, could you</p>
<p>have put more into it?</p>
<p>Could you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I left on my terms.</p>
<p>I said, this is it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work towards I&rsquo;ve been training for 30 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this thing that is like I couldn&rsquo;t even say that I was going to do it</p>
<p>years before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it and then I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t leave from an injury.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t forced.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I left on.</p>
<p>I did exactly what I said.</p>
<p>I went to a level that I.</p>
<p>I left on my terms and that&rsquo;s unique because that&rsquo;s usually not the case.</p>
<p>Sometimes you kind of either taper out or it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking like anything in life in general, right?</p>
<p>Like you taper out, you fail, you hurt, like you lose.</p>
<p>Like something, you know, you roll into retirement.</p>
<p>You accomplish something truly great and you walked away on your own terms.</p>
<p>Is there a sadness completing something like that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s in one perspective, the greatest thing you&rsquo;ll ever do.</p>
<p>And like when you accomplish such a great height, in some sense, you have to face your</p>
<p>mortality at that point.</p>
<p>So good question, but it is certainly not the greatest thing that I&rsquo;ll ever do.</p>
<p>The greatest physical street I&rsquo;ll ever do.</p>
<p>The greatest physical street, yes.</p>
<p>But that was an expression of some of my values and the way that I want to live.</p>
<p>It was a way of expressing it.</p>
<p>So understanding that is hugely fundamental because we do see so many athletes get to</p>
<p>the end of a career and then they fall into a depressive state and struggle with drugs,</p>
<p>alcohol, depression, and so on because they lost how they identified themselves and trying</p>
<p>to figure out where to turn, what to do.</p>
<p>But a big central component of their identity is lost.</p>
<p>So I knew that this was one way to express that and my grand goals have shifted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shifted to other outlets that allow me to express that.</p>
<p>Like my companies, Kabuki Strength, I&rsquo;m going to change the face of fitness as well as all</p>
<p>the way through with its integration with clinical medicine and telemedicine.</p>
<p>And I got another five years before even people see what I&rsquo;m working on, five years in right</p>
<p>now because I had to invent equipment, I have to develop methodologies that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>I had to do this stuff that ground layer wasn&rsquo;t done to create a cohesive ecosystem of training</p>
<p>methodology tied to the tools that we&rsquo;re using today, to the environment, tied to the clinical</p>
<p>practice assessment, tied to the interaction between all those and how that actually needs</p>
<p>to be reframed because so much of this is broken.</p>
<p>But there is sadness.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t deny that.</p>
<p>And the sadness comes in the singularity of focus that I had at that time, the being in</p>
<p>the process.</p>
<p>Not necessarily doing it, but like having being in this place that the rest of the world</p>
<p>kind of fell away from me in those final phases to have something so intense, to have a team</p>
<p>around me so focused on supporting and like it took me a couple of months after that squad.</p>
<p>But I finally one day I woke up and I was like, oh, welcome back to the world.</p>
<p>Like I was in such a mental fog.</p>
<p>Like I was, it took me a while to climb out of that.</p>
<p>But that space, that level of intensity and drive and living and being in that space,</p>
<p>I do miss that.</p>
<p>But I also, I can&rsquo;t continue that.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t continue.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a point of like, you push it so hard, the level to try to go from there</p>
<p>is not acceptable for what you, the impacts that&rsquo;ll have on your life or how you want</p>
<p>to live.</p>
<p>And it was taking away those final, like I had to do extreme things and live in an extreme</p>
<p>way to get there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a genius in this whole space of strength and health and almost like biology</p>
<p>that this strength feat is just one representation of that.</p>
<p>But this particular strength, it required that kind of singular focus, which I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s something beautiful about that singular focus that&rsquo;s often only</p>
<p>truly perfected in athletics.</p>
<p>I see it with the greatest Olympic athletes as well.</p>
<p>The kind of singular focus required there is incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow some of the most beautiful things that humans can do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, that must be it.</p>
<p>That singularity of focus, it&rsquo;s not like, here&rsquo;s it, because it covers a vast array</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>Like I was working with people, you know, all, well, yeah, all around North America.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say anybody around the globe, but professionals coming in, working on different</p>
<p>aspects of rehab and, and recovery.</p>
<p>And like, I mean, I&rsquo;m tapping all sorts of stuff in so many platforms from nutrition</p>
<p>to drugs to, again, like, you know, various Chinese medicine, you know, as far as, you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>But also the humans in your life, just love and positivity and just inspiration, all those</p>
<p>kinds of aspects.</p>
<p>I mean, you probably would have done much more if you went outside North America and</p>
<p>talked to some Russians, just between you and I.</p>
<p>Some Russians.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>They give you some, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s some incredible strength athletes in Eastern</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the best one coming in September to get fixed.</p>
<p>So what do you mean by fixed?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure what his particular issues are, but he has held the all time world record</p>
<p>repeatedly for a long time and he hasn&rsquo;t competed for some time.</p>
<p>And he just reached out saying he would like to come and have me take a look and see if</p>
<p>I can get him fixed because he needs to return.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more injury centric versus like form and a fundamental centric combination of everything.</p>
<p>Everybody always wants to focus on the output.</p>
<p>How do you give me the fix for that?</p>
<p>But it ties right back into all those other things, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, the Eastern block continued to be a dominant force in regards to athletics and</p>
<p>strength athletes without a doubt.</p>
<p>Some of my big rivals in my competitive days were, that&rsquo;s who it was.</p>
<p>Rivalry brings out the best in us.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story of your childhood?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely outside the scope of the norm.</p>
<p>Not today, maybe not 150 or 200 years ago, but my parents, highly intelligent people</p>
<p>coming out of the Bay area.</p>
<p>My mom was going to school to be a chemical engineer.</p>
<p>She was a top, top student athlete, graduated out of her school.</p>
<p>My father was a member of Mensa and my stepfather was just a genius, but not able to really</p>
<p>function in society.</p>
<p>But my mom was, she had some demons and some other stuff and just, she just said one day,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, I just don&rsquo;t want to be part of society.</p>
<p>She still isn&rsquo;t, lives out in the desert, but has her minds, but she wanted to figure</p>
<p>out a way to make a life outside of that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where we ended up is up in the mountains in Northern California.</p>
<p>And a lot of that was them trying to get into successfully growing marijuana, which back</p>
<p>in that wasn&rsquo;t legal back then, highly illegal.</p>
<p>And in fact, those areas were, some of the areas where we lived were quite dangerous.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a documentary Murder Mountain that came out recently.</p>
<p>If you watch that, you&rsquo;ll tie into my book, just the understanding of the stuff that I</p>
<p>was talking about dealing with serial killers, human trafficking, police corruption, murderers,</p>
<p>like just how real that stuff is if it doesn&rsquo;t capture you from the book.</p>
<p>The book, by the way, is the Eagle and the Dragon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a terrible salesperson.</p>
<p>Like I told you.</p>
<p>But a good, it&rsquo;s a good title.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you came up with it, but, so yeah, we&rsquo;ll talk about that anyway.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living by a stream off a meadow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no roads into where you have to hike in.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got beams lashed into the trees up above us because that&rsquo;s where our bedding</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s rattlesnake dens all around and six years old, I&rsquo;m being taught how to</p>
<p>capture and handle live rattlesnakes because that&rsquo;s what I need to do to be safe.</p>
<p>And you can imagine six years old, sitting there with a live rattlesnake in your hand,</p>
<p>grabbing it, you know, by the side of the head, controlling so it can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t bite</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just wrapping itself around your arm and you&rsquo;re staring at like, it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>intent is right then is to kill you.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>You want to take a bath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s filling up the jug in the stream and setting it out on the rocks during the, during</p>
<p>the sun.</p>
<p>So you dump it over your head and you know, not all the living was that way.</p>
<p>You know, good part was similar to that tent living, living in a 16 foot trailer with a</p>
<p>family of six, which is not much bigger than the space that we&rsquo;re sitting here.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking hard winters with feet of snow on the ground, nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m living in the back of the pickup truck and just a standard sleeping bag that we get</p>
<p>from the Salvation Army, not the, not the blow zero.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not sleeping well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s living in homes that were maybe condemned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, no doors even on them, no electricity or running water or one or the other or both.</p>
<p>And sometimes a little bit better by the time we got to high school we had a mobile home.</p>
<p>So my stepfather had won a disability payment cause he had a broken arm that whole time</p>
<p>from a accident a long time ago and finally got an award and got a down payment on this</p>
<p>mobile home that didn&rsquo;t have again, doors on the inside.</p>
<p>It did have running water, did have electricity, didn&rsquo;t have a kitchen, you know, the windows</p>
<p>would crank close and open, but they wouldn&rsquo;t close all the way.</p>
<p>So the trim them in with a plastic to be able to try to protect from the elements.</p>
<p>That was my environment, like learning how to forge for mushrooms.</p>
<p>I mean, there were summers I would send and my parents would be out, they were in the</p>
<p>drug trade earlier.</p>
<p>We got taken by the, by the police and put into foster care for a while, which ties into</p>
<p>some of the stories with human trafficking.</p>
<p>And honestly it&rsquo;s in my book, but it&rsquo;s really hard for me to talk about that stuff and obviously</p>
<p>not all that&rsquo;s in the book.</p>
<p>So but they got us back and we moved to Oregon and they stayed out of the drug trade from</p>
<p>that time to ensure that they didn&rsquo;t lose us again, but quickly we kind of fell back</p>
<p>into the same thing.</p>
<p>So at that point it was learning about geology and starting to do mining and firewood cutting,</p>
<p>but mostly the mining because Pat&rsquo;s broken arm chainsaw made a little tough.</p>
<p>If you remember just the sequence of moments, do you, are you haunted by the darker moments</p>
<p>of your childhood?</p>
<p>Do you remember moments of simple joy and happiness?</p>
<p>Outside of the living around dangerous people and the interactions that came from that,</p>
<p>we were a family.</p>
<p>Like we were a cohesive unit battling against the world together.</p>
<p>We spent all our time together, work, play.</p>
<p>I was there.</p>
<p>I was helping raise my, my siblings or I was working with them and you know, it was a constant,</p>
<p>like I said, we were very physically active.</p>
<p>So you know, I had that in my upbringing, um, that plug for my shoe company, barefoot,</p>
<p>B E A R I ran around the wilderness and bare feet all the time, you know, but it was, I</p>
<p>had a lot of great moments and I&rsquo;m thankful for a lot of that childhood once we take out</p>
<p>the trauma and the other stuff associated with it, right?</p>
<p>And so the connection that I have with my sisters, um, is, is, is huge.</p>
<p>Um, that goes a bit further to cause I am kind of like a, a little bit of a father figure</p>
<p>because I was at home raising them and then later I took custody of them, uh, while I</p>
<p>was going to school because the environment at home deteriorated further.</p>
<p>Their stepfather, stepfather, like I said, was, he wasn&rsquo;t capable of managing life.</p>
<p>And uh, my mom had a mental breakdown and took off to Montana and he descended into</p>
<p>madness even worse, uh, actually took my, my 13 year old sister and kicked her out in</p>
<p>the middle of winter, a couple of feet of snow on the ground because he thought she</p>
<p>stole his favorite cereal bowl, um, type.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I took in and I was going to college, putting myself through college and</p>
<p>I started taking custody of my sisters and raising them.</p>
<p>So anyway, we&rsquo;re still like very, very tight family.</p>
<p>Um, it took, there was a few years later in life, like that the connection with my mother</p>
<p>was kind of broken.</p>
<p>Um, I didn&rsquo;t speak to her for years because of her basically abandoning my sisters and</p>
<p>me having to come in.</p>
<p>But that we&rsquo;ve worked through that as best we can.</p>
<p>So you anger on your part?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, there might&rsquo;ve been some anger.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Did you always love her?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I still do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so, she&rsquo;s taught me basically everything I know about strength and perseverance and</p>
<p>living life on your terms and being able to create that.</p>
<p>And so much of what I am is from that, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had to learn to be okay with the way she is because she is just blunt, but</p>
<p>you know, she&rsquo;s the one that figured out that the human trafficking situation and got, uh,</p>
<p>got the da involved and got all the, she&rsquo;s the one that I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from her.</p>
<p>And uh.</p>
<p>Did you inherit some of the demons?</p>
<p>Oh, most certainly.</p>
<p>And I, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve continued like in my father&rsquo;s side of has been really tough</p>
<p>on that because some of it is just based genetic as well.</p>
<p>So my, my stepfather made I think six or seven attempts on his life during his lifetime.</p>
<p>One of those in front of me, uh, his mother blew her head off with a shotgun.</p>
<p>Uh, her brother jumped out a window in LA, uh, their father did something similar and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far back it goes because there is no family except for me and my children.</p>
<p>You spoke about going through depression yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you, um, talk about some of the darker moments of that?</p>
<p>Have you ever like many in your family, have you ever considered suicide?</p>
<p>Yes I have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve achieved a lot of exceptional things in your life.</p>
<p>Can you talk about those early days of depression and how you overcame it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the things that I did that people give me accolades for are the things that I did</p>
<p>selfishly to save myself.</p>
<p>The things like taking custody of my sisters, being the person that everybody around, you</p>
<p>know, the, the important people relied on the fact that I had to step to the plate and</p>
<p>be present and be that person because if I failed, they failed.</p>
<p>They would be like the people that I grew up with that are dead or in prison or on drugs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re either way to one of those, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where everybody ended and I wasn&rsquo;t going to let that happen.</p>
<p>What about saving yourself?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how in those early days, that&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>
<p>Not saying it&rsquo;s the best approach, but it was survivor mentality.</p>
<p>It was, I can&rsquo;t selfishly do that because I have them to take care of, right?</p>
<p>And then that continued where I would keep putting myself in these leadership roles or</p>
<p>other things and just always being this person that was at the center, at the hub that forced</p>
<p>me to be there.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s only in the more recent, you know, last decade or so that I have had to really</p>
<p>learn how to come and start confronting some of those demons and think, man, why is the</p>
<p>guy so successful?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, and we haven&rsquo;t talked about all the stuff that I&rsquo;ve done, but like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen a lot of success in both business, leadership, athletics, academics, entrepreneurship, all</p>
<p>these sorts of things, right?</p>
<p>But if it wasn&rsquo;t for having kids and the same being in the position, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m learning to come and manage those as best I can.</p>
<p>Learning to meditate into those things and really feel what the driver is so I can get</p>
<p>to those root understanding and having some guidance doing so.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;ve got mental health issues, this isn&rsquo;t something that you need to tackle on</p>
<p>your own.</p>
<p>Like having a professional that can help guide you on that introspective journey is something</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s not like, hey, I&rsquo;m big, tough guy.</p>
<p>I can handle everything.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that you saved yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite powerful to save yourself by having others depend on you.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fuck it up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a reason to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, that&rsquo;s not addressing the darkness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And it probably not a sustainable strategy either, right?</p>
<p>So I recognize these things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is sustainable.</p>
<p>Perhaps that, I mean, there&rsquo;s something beautiful about giving yourself basically in service</p>
<p>of others and thereby creating purpose.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s almost like fake it till you make it and then you make it eventually.</p>
<p>That is purpose though.</p>
<p>That is purpose.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to, to me, life is about taking your cup and how you choose to pour</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>How you choose to give.</p>
<p>What is your purpose?</p>
<p>What is that connection with everybody around you?</p>
<p>This is, that&rsquo;s the intent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what life is about.</p>
<p>How are you going to help those around you?</p>
<p>How are you going to help the world?</p>
<p>Your purpose is right here, figuring out what this is and then how to do that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you can&rsquo;t let that run dry.</p>
<p>So you have to make sure that you&rsquo;re filling that up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other side, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to your engineering degree, which you&rsquo;re obviously scientifically engineering</p>
<p>minded, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Your book is titled the Eagle and the Dragon.</p>
<p>What do the Eagle and the Dragon symbolize?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty big symbols for me.</p>
<p>In fact, that covers my entire body as a tattoo.</p>
<p>So the first one I had done at around 19 years old.</p>
<p>And so this is, or started at 19.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an eagle that covers my entire front, you know, my stomach, rib cage, and one that</p>
<p>was on my back that covered most of my back.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s chained at the, well, at the claw, I guess.</p>
<p>And the chain wraps down around and attaches to my ankle and there&rsquo;s a shackle there.</p>
<p>And so this was something that I had done at that age because it was, to me, it was</p>
<p>a representation of your potential, your strengths, your abilities that you can fly to whatever</p>
<p>height that you want in this world.</p>
<p>The only thing holding you back at the end of the day is yourself.</p>
<p>And this was, I hadn&rsquo;t necessarily accomplished a whole lot at that time.</p>
<p>I mean, I was valedictorian for high school, small high school.</p>
<p>Does that even count?</p>
<p>I was a state level wrestler.</p>
<p>This was my belief.</p>
<p>And you sense that there was a potential in you and the only thing that could stop you</p>
<p>from realizing that potential was yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a heck of a tattoo to get, by the way, at 19, but 40 hours went into that thing.</p>
<p>It shows you got some guts.</p>
<p>And then the next tattoo, so I only have two, I had done in 2015, 2016 when I, so at this</p>
<p>point in my life, so I had done that.</p>
<p>I had flown to whatever heights, right?</p>
<p>So I had, I had proven to myself and maybe done what I thought I needed to do to show</p>
<p>the world that this poor kid from the sticks, this kid growing up in the mountains with</p>
<p>nothing could achieve the American dream.</p>
<p>I was a corporate executive sought after that I&rsquo;d come in, I&rsquo;d fix companies, I&rsquo;d turn around</p>
<p>and prep them for sale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d take a company and grow it from a regional to a national to a global presence.</p>
<p>I did this in the automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, high tech, heavy</p>
<p>industry and I had a house with a white picket fence.</p>
<p>I was a successful athlete with all time world records.</p>
<p>I owned a gym on the side where I coached people and I had a comfortable marriage that</p>
<p>everything was hunky dory with no arguments at home and I walked away from all of it.</p>
<p>I left everything behind except for my kids.</p>
<p>I wanted to chase what I was meant to do and chase what I was capable of doing.</p>
<p>I wanted to become a better version of myself, but very intentfully and that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>I sold, I had multiple homes, sold my homes.</p>
<p>I cashed in all my retirement that I&rsquo;d earned for 20, nearly 20 years and I lost all that.</p>
<p>I leveraged myself millions of dollars of personal debt so that if I failed, there was</p>
<p>no way out.</p>
<p>Even going back to that old career that I did well, I&rsquo;d be living in an apartment the</p>
<p>rest of my life paying it off.</p>
<p>Old question, people questioned me at the time because I had a comfortable, easy marriage</p>
<p>and I chose to ask for a divorce and I ended up living in an apartment for a couple of</p>
<p>years with no income, selling off every last thing that I had except for my two vehicles</p>
<p>that I built and with my kids and I started my businesses to help people live a better</p>
<p>quality of life, to get them out of pain, to help them live better through strength,</p>
<p>to realize that stress, demand, those things, they don&rsquo;t have to be the thing that if you</p>
<p>look back, made you had the bad back, made you have the bad deeds, but they do the opposite.</p>
<p>They get you out of pain and then I started working my book to hit on those other things,</p>
<p>the mental, the emotional, maybe even spiritual, I don&rsquo;t touch on that one too much in there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all the same, that things that happen around you, to you, like maybe they&rsquo;re bad,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take away that, but why can&rsquo;t you use what you have of it to become a stronger</p>
<p>and better person, to become more resilient, to be able to take the things that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that are coming in the future and so this is very intentful and that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>second long winded answer in your question here.</p>
<p>The dragon.</p>
<p>The dragon is an Ouroboros and so it is, it circles my entire upper body, my shoulders,</p>
<p>my back, my chest, everything, it&rsquo;s right here, there&rsquo;s this big dragon head and its</p>
<p>tail is right there in its mouth that&rsquo;s eating itself and it may sound a bit graphic or whatever,</p>
<p>but it is, it&rsquo;s the eating of the old becoming the new, it is the purposeful reinvention</p>
<p>of oneself, it is the deciding, not realizing just your potential, but deciding specifically</p>
<p>who you want to be in this fucking world and becoming that person.</p>
<p>Can you comment on the value and the power of putting a flame to your old life, your</p>
<p>old self, just destroying all of it as you walk into the new life, did you have to do</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend this, by the way, because when you put yourself in no way out, there</p>
<p>is no way out, okay?</p>
<p>You got to really, but I can be an overconfident individual at times and I live through extremes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great way of actually finding your real values and how you want to live,</p>
<p>honestly, to chase having absolutely perfect squat technique, but chase putting every freaking</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;ve got in it, which most people would say, those are opposite, those are diametrically</p>
<p>opposed.</p>
<p>I wanted a better home life, I wanted to do more in the world through my work and the</p>
<p>burning the bridges mentality is not necessarily the best.</p>
<p>There was some temperament in that though, because I was slow to make the shift for a</p>
<p>long time because I&rsquo;d been thinking about doing it, but I was thinking about doing it</p>
<p>in a healthcare perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go back to school to be a surgeon or a physical therapist or a Cairo because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where all my research and stuff was in this human movement and rehab and recovery.</p>
<p>This is the mentors that I&rsquo;ve been developing were the best in the world in these things,</p>
<p>in these disciplines, those were my friends, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to compromise my family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain quality of life.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep that.</p>
<p>So it was slow and hard for me to make that transition, but I didn&rsquo;t do it until I had</p>
<p>a platform built enough that those first few years I did have an income, I was able to</p>
<p>make enough from the business until it grew so fast that I needed so much more needed</p>
<p>to come in.</p>
<p>The living in the apartment piece and doing all that, that was actually a couple of years</p>
<p>into that process, maybe like two years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually going through that very process now.</p>
<p>I put everything, I quit everything, gave away everything and starting a new and unfortunately</p>
<p>or fortunately this podcast somehow became quite popular.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s getting in the way of my burning everything to the ground.</p>
<p>But in that it&rsquo;s a source of joy.</p>
<p>But the main thing I&rsquo;m after is the similar project as you is building a business sense</p>
<p>of joy.</p>
<p>So this, this is the point I want to drive home right now, right now.</p>
<p>Because when I say burn, I learned that burning the bridges works because that&rsquo;s how I had</p>
<p>to succeed when I was earlier.</p>
<p>The bridges weren&rsquo;t burnt.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>There was no couch to go home to.</p>
<p>There was no, there was no fall back plan and it forced me and gave me the confidence</p>
<p>to know that I can pull it off.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t encourage people because there&rsquo;s so much out there of this hustle porn and</p>
<p>other stuff going just grind, just go after it, get in and start your, like you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>there and it&rsquo;s all about the output to make money, to be somebody, to do this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, that is some short term motivation right there.</p>
<p>I feel like dropping a few swear words, but</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always welcome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already done a few, so we&rsquo;ll bounce it out.</p>
<p>That is short term.</p>
<p>That is not going to keep you going.</p>
<p>This need, if you&rsquo;re going to go that approach, it needs to be because this is your North</p>
<p>star.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be so much hard work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be years of just pushing through where your question, not only is everybody</p>
<p>around you questioning you and your family&rsquo;s questioning you, you&rsquo;re questioning yourself</p>
<p>going, man, I don&rsquo;t know if I can pull this off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be stressed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be pulled to the max.</p>
<p>If somebody comes up to me and says, should I start a business?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say no.</p>
<p>And oh, you&rsquo;re supposed to motivate me.</p>
<p>If you need me to motivate you, this is the wrong damn approach for you.</p>
<p>This is going to be hard.</p>
<p>This is going to be harder than you expect, even with me telling you this.</p>
<p>And so it better damn well be worth it.</p>
<p>This better be your North fucking star.</p>
<p>This better live and be a way for you to be able to articulate or realize those values</p>
<p>that you want to live.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something to make money.</p>
<p>This is a way for you to live the life and be able to share the values that you have</p>
<p>with the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that, which is going to give you joy, then we can walk away.</p>
<p>This is not some way to make some money and be known.</p>
<p>I mean, this, this includes both like simple day to day joy and also deep meaning the whole</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>It allows you to overcome all the, all the pain along the way.</p>
<p>But I got to say, I mean, it&rsquo;s a difficult thing because you run a business.</p>
<p>This podcast and a lot of things I do research wise is full of joy, but it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Running a business is hard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m very hesitant about in that to almost push back a little bit.</p>
<p>I think if I do get the guts to start the business, it will not be because I&rsquo;m not choosing</p>
<p>a more joyful life because I&rsquo;m already truly happy.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;ll choose is because I just can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, I&rsquo;ve always had this dream and I know it&rsquo;s going to lead to suffering and</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s going to be a life that has less happiness in it.</p>
<p>As sad as this to say, but it won&rsquo;t be, it won&rsquo;t be less happiness because we talk about</p>
<p>this cup and where you choose to pour it and what you choose to do with it.</p>
<p>And when you look back on things, the things that are going to give you the most joy, the</p>
<p>most proud, the things that are going to stand out in your life that you really remember</p>
<p>are going to be those days and your, those years you struggle, you&rsquo;re going to look back</p>
<p>on 10 years later and go, fuck, those were the glory days.</p>
<p>Those were the glory days.</p>
<p>And it won&rsquo;t feel like it at the time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what life&rsquo;s made of.</p>
<p>And so this is your, this is your opportunity.</p>
<p>You feel that.</p>
<p>So right now you&rsquo;ve got this, when you think about it, you&rsquo;ve got this little thing twisting</p>
<p>up in your gut, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a mixture of anxiety and fear as well as excitement in that is that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>signal that this is your opportunity for that personal growth, the challenge yourself.</p>
<p>This is your going for a run or working out in the heat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s those things.</p>
<p>It is your opportunity to go back.</p>
<p>Maybe it even fails.</p>
<p>Maybe it even fails, but by turning into that, you&rsquo;re going to learn so much and it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to make you so much better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the path that you should take when you have this stuff rolling around in there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, it could just be a hard conversation with your partner or your boss.</p>
<p>It could be taking on a project that, you know, you know, that your boss has thrown</p>
<p>out to the team and you&rsquo;re like, Oh, I&rsquo;m going to hide in the back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, maybe, maybe you do.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s going back to school.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s making that career move that you always wanted, but you&rsquo;re just a, you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>afraid of all these things.</p>
<p>Those are your opportunity for you to turn into that.</p>
<p>It is your workout.</p>
<p>It is your practice because if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get soft and who knows what&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to be ready for it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to run right over the top of you because you&rsquo;re going to be weak.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be soft.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect in which choosing that hard path is actually the, the way to arrive</p>
<p>at the richest kind of happiness, the greatest fulfillment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the funny thing about just the human.</p>
<p>Just make sure you&rsquo;re filling the cup as you&rsquo;re going through it and not pouring it all out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the part to figure out, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, life is short anyway.</p>
<p>Eventually, eventually the cup will be empty.</p>
<p>So maybe time the refilling of the cup correctly so you maximize the little time you got.</p>
<p>Let me talk to you about strength a little bit first, high level.</p>
<p>What are the differences in the different disciplines of strength?</p>
<p>So power lifting, we talked about maybe just to clarify for people, power lifting, Olympic</p>
<p>lifting, just regular gym fitness, bodybuilding, doing curls in front of the mirror for hours</p>
<p>like I do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the difference between all of these?</p>
<p>Oh, and also strong man.</p>
<p>Every one of those, as far as the athletic disciplines are different qualities.</p>
<p>So we want to think about things as terms of quality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s strength, there&rsquo;s power, there&rsquo;s endurance, there&rsquo;s the ability to be coordinated</p>
<p>and athletic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things and they&rsquo;re different, they&rsquo;re different qualities.</p>
<p>So your training as it relates to that is how you cycle in the development of those qualities.</p>
<p>What we want to think about is there&rsquo;s a lot of different frames of thought, some very</p>
<p>classical, maybe not classical Russian approach because there&rsquo;s a lot of different approach</p>
<p>from the Eastern block, but one of the ones is developing all the qualities at once, focusing</p>
<p>on building those more of a periodization effect would be focusing on one quality at</p>
<p>a time or one quality while maintaining other qualities and then shifting that around.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just going to be a little different based on what the output is and what the desired.</p>
<p>So like powerlifting is actually, power is the wrong word.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually no power in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just brute, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s strength, um, application of force, um, Olympic lifting</p>
<p>would actually be a better name for powerlifting because that is more explosive development.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s um, strongman is again, now we&rsquo;re getting a little bit more athletic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equipment based on the implements and stuff that are used, how fast you can move</p>
<p>your feet and run mixed with more endurance, but still very strength focused.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things with strongman that is straight.</p>
<p>Like each one of these is very also focused on different genetic dispositions.</p>
<p>So actually if you look at the history of sports, you&rsquo;ll find that they&rsquo;re a lot of</p>
<p>times based on different populations and it sounds like it&rsquo;s very unPC, but like a Highland</p>
<p>games, um, they&rsquo;ve got deep, deeper hip sockets that are shallow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to see a lot of short hip hinge movements like the, the caber toss and</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>Muay Thai wrestling, they&rsquo;ve got a completely different hip joint.</p>
<p>And so strongman itself is going to be for very large frame individuals.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not well over six foot and a large person, you&rsquo;re probably not going to perform</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sub six foot have ever done well at strongman just because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s leverage based, right?</p>
<p>Um, Olympic lifting, we see consistently in, in Europe, uh, the, the history tells us a</p>
<p>high level of hip, uh, and back issues because of the depth that that hip socket has to go</p>
<p>in to be able to complete that lift.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re going to see issues with populations that don&rsquo;t have the ability to do that.</p>
<p>So, so we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about training as well as disposition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, and also cross head fits into that, that&rsquo;s more like strongman, but for a wider variety</p>
<p>of bodies, I suppose.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And definitely more metabolic conditioning focus than the, than the strength aspect of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Um, and, and, and conditioning is an interesting thing too.</p>
<p>So that quality in my opinion can be developed a lot faster, but kind of peaks much faster</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Um, where strength, we can continue to add and add and add over time.</p>
<p>Uh, so it&rsquo;s for me, like for conditioning with any strength athlete, I don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>spend as much time on that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll cycle, uh, the conditioning work for our strength athletes and then taper that</p>
<p>off leading into meat.</p>
<p>So the more metabolic work, that means the more capacity in strength training that you</p>
<p>can accomplish, which is the goal, um, and recover from.</p>
<p>But then as we lead to a competition, we want to spend more time on recovering from that.</p>
<p>So we have to pull things out.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d pull out less.</p>
<p>So like a typical approach would be like taking a six week cycle for conditioning and ramping,</p>
<p>ramping up over three weeks periods time, then dropping back down again and ramping</p>
<p>up and being slightly offset by like a week or two from your strength peaks so that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>actually tapered the week prior in your conditioning work to your strength work.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not hitting conditioning hard all the time, which is a common, common, uh, misstep</p>
<p>that people make is going, well, I need conditioning.</p>
<p>So they just hammer that at a base level over the top instead of cycling that.</p>
<p>If we talk about powerlifting in terms of regimen, in terms of exercise, in terms of</p>
<p>the process, the wood consistent with what, is there something to be said about general</p>
<p>qualities of the consistency of the regimen required to get strong?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some training principles as a whole.</p>
<p>And this will, I think this will break down what you&rsquo;re, what you&rsquo;re one, the more work</p>
<p>that we can fit into a given time, the more progress we&rsquo;re going to make.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean doing the max amount of work possible at any given time.</p>
<p>So we know that we&rsquo;re always to, to, to accomplish more, we&rsquo;re always going to have more.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain ceiling that you&rsquo;re going to hit that you&rsquo;re not going to be able</p>
<p>to add more.</p>
<p>So you want to start and get the most amount of results that you can with the least amount</p>
<p>of work, because you&rsquo;re going to have to do it again, like this stair step over and over</p>
<p>year, decade, so on.</p>
<p>So when people is a big miss, people got, they look at a Chico program from Russia or</p>
<p>so on and they go, I&rsquo;m going to follow this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that was specifically written for somebody with 20 years of experience that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already built the capacities to be at that level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about building that work capacity.</p>
<p>So how much work can you give in a given time?</p>
<p>So now we want to look at some research is it relates to injuries because injuries are</p>
<p>going to be a big driver over time of what holds you back.</p>
<p>So when we talk consistency, training hard for three years, five years, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be really good.</p>
<p>But what we find is a lot of people train really hard for nine months, have to slow</p>
<p>back for a month, get back into it and miss another week because, and so on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always like this little nagging, that little nagging.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s pretty clear in the research we want to, we&rsquo;re looking at when we&rsquo;re stair</p>
<p>stepping this stuff, we&rsquo;re looking at acute and chronic loading.</p>
<p>So some fancy words for average and like what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>So this given week would be our acute, chronic would be what is our average loading let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say over the last six months.</p>
<p>So the more that we can move the chronic loading up, the more work we&rsquo;re getting done on as</p>
<p>a whole over time, we&rsquo;re going to get stronger.</p>
<p>The way that we build the capacity to do that is having spikes in acute loading.</p>
<p>Now as we do this, the, the acute loading, if it spikes more than 10, maybe 15% from</p>
<p>what the chronic loading has been, that accounts for 80% of injuries out there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not actually the movement quality or this misstep or the other may usually happens</p>
<p>about four or five, six weeks later, it&rsquo;s like, Oh, this nagging and then it gets worse.</p>
<p>And then now you got to, you got to do some rehab, your training sessions aren&rsquo;t as good</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re starting to look at this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I want to do the, I want to do the least amount of work where I can still</p>
<p>progress.</p>
<p>I want to be able to have spikes in my weekly demand that don&rsquo;t go above 10 to 15% of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been averaging for the last month.</p>
<p>But every time I do a spike, my, my average goes up, right?</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>And then that becomes very particular also when you take, when you do take plantain time</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>So a lot of people, uh, training session, maybe they&rsquo;re doing a five week block with</p>
<p>a, uh, a deload week or you go on vacation for a week or any of those things that were</p>
<p>a downward.</p>
<p>What does that do to your average and chronic loading?</p>
<p>It brings it down.</p>
<p>And then what does the person want to do when they come back, make up for it.</p>
<p>Now they have a huge spike above five weeks later, we&rsquo;re dealing with all this elbow,</p>
<p>this wrist, whatever&rsquo;s kind of bothering me and now you&rsquo;re not performing as much.</p>
<p>So these are some really fundamental pieces of, of, of, of training.</p>
<p>And then now we can start overlaying the qualities that we&rsquo;re trying to develop that we were</p>
<p>talking about earlier.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s talk about my deadlift, my thousand pound deadlift.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the training cycles for both the thousand deadlift and squat.</p>
<p>So backing up a year out from the deadlift, knowing I was training at the time, heavy</p>
<p>deadlifts once a week and usually it was two of those sessions a month were really heavy</p>
<p>and the others weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, how can we get this up to where I&rsquo;m deadlifting twice a week?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where I want to be, uh, to be able to accomplish this.</p>
<p>I need to be loading about that much with frequency, with a certain volume to be able</p>
<p>to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to go through all the math and stuff like that and how that&rsquo;s arrived,</p>
<p>but there is math behind this.</p>
<p>And so instead of just like, oh, well, let&rsquo;s start deadlifting twice a week.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So we start and we take the one session that we&rsquo;ve got and we split it, part of it, take</p>
<p>part of it away and put it in the second half of the week.</p>
<p>So the total volume is still the same.</p>
<p>And then, um, we start adding some volume, but I&rsquo;m doing it at a off a block so that</p>
<p>the actual load is accumulative load is less cause I have less range of motion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then we start building that closer to the ground, closer to the ground and so on.</p>
<p>And now we start getting to where I&rsquo;m almost doing two sessions, full sessions a week.</p>
<p>And then we start adding a little bit of load.</p>
<p>And so at my level, this isn&rsquo;t talking about adding another set or another day a week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking like in my squat, it might be one rep instead of doing three sets of three</p>
<p>at one week, I do two doubles or two triples, then two doubles to give me one more rep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re doing that from one week to the next.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a cycle training cycle.</p>
<p>It might be five, six weeks and then so on and the next one and slowly bringing that</p>
<p>average load up.</p>
<p>So the last phases of the squat, for example, we took the average loading every week.</p>
<p>So my, of my heavy sets.</p>
<p>Once we developed all this stuff over the last year to get to this point, now it is</p>
<p>taking and going, okay, my average load this week is eight reps at nine hundred and fifty</p>
<p>five pounds.</p>
<p>And then the next week, let&rsquo;s get it to nine, nine fifty seven, nine sixty three.</p>
<p>And this was pretty aggressive working up to where my average loading the final that</p>
<p>the final was nine hundred and eighty five pounds average load for eight to nine reps.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I said.</p>
<p>This is the intense part.</p>
<p>This is the day of was much easier that week over week is pretty brutal.</p>
<p>May not sound well, you&rsquo;re just squatting.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s back up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the quality development.</p>
<p>So a year out from the squat, obviously, I&rsquo;ve been working on developing axial load capacity,</p>
<p>my capacity to withstand load from top to bottom.</p>
<p>So I like thinking about things and movement vectors.</p>
<p>So this vector is an axial loaded vector is the hardest to recover from that was axial.</p>
<p>Like is deadlift, are they both or both?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So a horizontal front to back would be like a row or a press.</p>
<p>Why is the axial hardest to recover because it&rsquo;s entire body, the entire entire body,</p>
<p>just anything that is that taxes the the spinal mechanics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I could tell you my beliefs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s studied.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>OK, we can just keep the discussion on that short like that.</p>
<p>Well, so we start looking at those different vectors that we&rsquo;re training in.</p>
<p>And so this is why this is important to understand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not just getting into nuance here.</p>
<p>So, hey, squatting is going to make me make me jump further because it&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>Well, squatting is an axial load vector and jumping is a vector this way.</p>
<p>So actually, hip thrust would help with your and this is proven in science with your forward</p>
<p>jumping ability.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both working similar muscles.</p>
<p>The glute extension, but they&rsquo;re working it in those different platforms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important to understand because people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building my work capacity by doing sled process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not developing your work capacity for squatting.</p>
<p>Most movements, even ones as holistic as a as a squat, require specialization.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get strong at the squat by doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have some carry over, right, obviously.</p>
<p>But because taking an untrained person that hasn&rsquo;t done it is still not going to do as</p>
<p>good as somebody that&rsquo;s done nonspecific work, but done work.</p>
<p>So but yes, for the most part, to get truly strong, you need to specialize.</p>
<p>So but not all the time.</p>
<p>So now we talk about quality.</p>
<p>So and if we specialize in the same thing too long, we stagnate because the body adapts</p>
<p>to a certain point and just can&rsquo;t make progress.</p>
<p>So we wanted to save the actual squatting in the pattern with the bar that I was doing</p>
<p>for the very end.</p>
<p>So starting a year out, I started doing work front squatting like a squat axial loaded</p>
<p>pattern and worked on maximizing that up.</p>
<p>Then I started shifting to doing transformer bar squat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this bar I developed that actually change manipulates spinal mechanics.</p>
<p>So I started loading in these more forward positions and being able again.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m getting closer than a front squat, but not quite squatting.</p>
<p>And then I would start adjusting that bar every training cycle to closer to a squat</p>
<p>toaster to a squat till it finally was right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a front squat and a regular like a back squat?</p>
<p>Like in terms of the stress on the body, the mechanics, was there something interesting</p>
<p>to be said about like how fundamentally different are they?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>People think about the weight and imposition to them like, oh, the bars in front of me,</p>
<p>the bars behind me, which is not the case.</p>
<p>The bar is above your midfoot.</p>
<p>The load is above your midfoot.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually manipulating the spine behind the bar.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re causing spinal uprighting behind the bar, getting in a more erect position,</p>
<p>which is going to change the relationship of the hip angle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to change our ability to maintain the spine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to change how much the core comes in, how hard it is to maintain that sternum</p>
<p>to diaphragm relationship that we talked about.</p>
<p>All this stuff starts changing.</p>
<p>So the bar stays in the same place.</p>
<p>Bar is still behind you, but the load moves around.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re actually manipulating the spine around the load.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>We can tailor it to an athlete, which is great when you got a seven foot plus tall baseball</p>
<p>player or basketball player.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we work with all these teams.</p>
<p>Anyway, so it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re taking something and getting closer and closer to it.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&rsquo;re looking at the quality.</p>
<p>So like I needed to be able to really hold this torso position with the weight moving</p>
<p>up here.</p>
<p>Unlike the deadlift, the ability to manage this TL position becomes much more challenging.</p>
<p>So that was also why I was choosing the transformer bar, because it actually challenges that more</p>
<p>in those big forward positions.</p>
<p>I was also working on my back strength tremendously to be able to hold the maintain position.</p>
<p>So there was a lot of like I chose a bent over rows.</p>
<p>So bent over row is a mixed vector.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a forward to back.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&rsquo;t have as much carrier, but it&rsquo;s also got some axial loading component in it</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working on that.</p>
<p>And then as we get closer and closer to competition, I&rsquo;m developing those strengths.</p>
<p>But now I need to start tapering those out.</p>
<p>So all of my recovery needs can now go into the more specific that I&rsquo;m actually ramping</p>
<p>the load up.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m ramping the load on the weight, I&rsquo;m able to ramp it a lot faster because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tapering out the other stuff.</p>
<p>So I can still keep my total load high, but now get it very, very specific.</p>
<p>So everything that I&rsquo;ve done has always been kind of an annual training cycle.</p>
<p>And then again, this was like this was a five year training cycle, but we just kind of walked</p>
<p>through the last year of each and you can see how these concepts play out in reality.</p>
<p>So in the cycling.</p>
<p>So this is both for you, but also for more recreational strength athletes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s variety injected into this.</p>
<p>You need variety.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you will basically stagnate at some level, right?</p>
<p>So you should always be kind of shifting a little bit.</p>
<p>So three to four month blocks in general for an average, you know, just a gen pop fitness</p>
<p>is pretty good where you&rsquo;re going to spend more time maybe in a higher rep range or lower</p>
<p>rep range, a little bit more work on endurance capacity or maybe some more time.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m playing around with boxing or jujitsu or something like that.</p>
<p>Bring that a little bit more to the front for a while and bring the other out.</p>
<p>But like mixing mixing those variables up, but trying to keep the total load the same</p>
<p>and always kind of like, you know, do we add a little more?</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be major and it shouldn&rsquo;t be major.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want these big jumps.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go, oh, my God, let&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into squatting every day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to build the capacity to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>What role would you say strength has in sports that combine skill and strength?</p>
<p>So for me personally, maybe I&rsquo;ll just ask it selfishly, which is grappling, wrestling,</p>
<p>MMA.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How about I start with baseball?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The sport.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Baseball and golf are two of my favorite sports.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be in shape at all to excel at those sports.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get this argument.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got a perfect example, because this is why I sell so many Transformer bars</p>
<p>into the Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>So they get these people that come in, these athletes, that have been baseball their whole</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>It is part of the culture.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re great athletes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got all this skill.</p>
<p>The only thing they have to do is develop a little bit more resilience so that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the injury.</p>
<p>They can push their training a little bit more, that they can add a little bit more</p>
<p>force output and be able to recover from it.</p>
<p>So the only thing they&rsquo;ve got to do is add some training.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no training culture there, so they don&rsquo;t have any experience, which is why</p>
<p>they love the Transformer bar, because they don&rsquo;t have to worry about teaching the technique.</p>
<p>We can actually set the bar on a setting that makes their squats perfect by cueing all the</p>
<p>stuff with actually not having to coach it.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re coaching a roomful of athletes, it&rsquo;s really hard to teach the nuance</p>
<p>of all this and not sure that all that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all that they have to do with these players with a huge level of skill.</p>
<p>So once you reach a certain level of skill, adding strength is the only real forward path.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the basic, simple answer to that.</p>
<p>So one of the benefits there being injury prevention, actually.</p>
<p>Injury prevention.</p>
<p>Resilience.</p>
<p>Because especially fighting sports, you&rsquo;re going to be challenged and thrown and other</p>
<p>things happen to you.</p>
<p>And the more resilient you can make your structures, the better you&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>Even a cyclist, mountain biking.</p>
<p>Why would they need it?</p>
<p>Why would they need to do upper body training?</p>
<p>Take a crash, your shoulder&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Your career&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve done a little training.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s value in all this stuff.</p>
<p>But the resilience, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And then we can overlay strength.</p>
<p>Where we miss is this focus on strength when we haven&rsquo;t developed quality motor patterns</p>
<p>first.</p>
<p>So this is a huge thing with children.</p>
<p>Because people want to know what&rsquo;s the appropriate training age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have had my daughter training before my son.</p>
<p>Because she developed movement patterns that have better quality earlier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no age.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going to be very dependent on the individual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in having adaptation if we don&rsquo;t have the right thing to adapt to yet.</p>
<p>And that applies to general movement, but also to sport.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the skills should be developed first and then the strength applied on top</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Maybe you can educate me, but I actually quit lifting and powerlifting for a long time</p>
<p>after I started Judo, Jiu Jitsu, grappling, all this sort of combat sports.</p>
<p>Because I found that it was preventing me from relaxing my body enough to load in the</p>
<p>skill.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t a problem with the training.</p>
<p>This is a problem with you.</p>
<p>So this is actually really, really important.</p>
<p>The first product I ever released was a loadable mace, a swinging mace.</p>
<p>And because every power lifter and body, well, not every, but most serious power lifters</p>
<p>and bodybuilders, like shoulders, mobility is pretty limited.</p>
<p>And most of them really, really struggle with this.</p>
<p>The problem is they&rsquo;ve been taught to have tension all the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>So when we talk about the joint positions that we were talking about earlier and having</p>
<p>those and the muscles in the right length and tension relationship, athleticism is the</p>
<p>speed to relaxation because the counter is speed to contraction.</p>
<p>Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.</p>
<p>And so what a mace can do is use that because this ties back into a developmental kinesiology</p>
<p>because a lot of like reset patterns are getting back into these basic movements, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as much about relaxation as it is contraction.</p>
<p>So a mace, we have this weight on a big long lever.</p>
<p>So if I grab a kettlebell and this would be like the same movement as a kettlebell halo,</p>
<p>it is the same movement as a, but here in the halo, I&rsquo;m on the whole time with the mace</p>
<p>at the proper length, with the right distribution, you cannot do the movement.</p>
<p>You could not move force your way through it.</p>
<p>The only way that you can accomplish that is by relaxing.</p>
<p>And then now we, now we can contract all the muscles related around that shoulder girdle</p>
<p>all at once.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on, off, on, off, on, off with moving and contracting.</p>
<p>And now, so what happens a lot of times as we, you know, this stiffness and tightness</p>
<p>happens.</p>
<p>So in four positions, we start using stabilizer muscles to do the movement.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where this stiffness come from.</p>
<p>So it means that in some of whatever training that you&rsquo;re doing, there&rsquo;s a deficit in the</p>
<p>movement quality, okay.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a deficit in the training program and you&rsquo;re not recovering from an 80% of the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the right answer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s where the, where the gap is and learning how to relax and the way a</p>
<p>lot of the exercises are taught and have been taught for a long time, which is why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big gap.</p>
<p>And this is why both clinical rehab and all these other components are mixed in my philosophy</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m trying to do with Kabuki strength, because I&rsquo;m looking at holistic movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking at powerlifting based movements are what I want to load and be able to assess</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>But this affects all sports, all activities and strength doesn&rsquo;t have to be that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m freaking a thousand pound squatter and deadlifter.</p>
<p>If you watch any of my videos where I do like complete quad fallbacks, I don&rsquo;t stretch at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>I can usually get close to a full split.</p>
<p>Like if I want to.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, I did not see those videos.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s hard to believe.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well actually I do.</p>
<p>I just did one recently, a quad fallback with my, with my mace loaded way out to the end</p>
<p>torsioning on both ends of the other.</p>
<p>And like I do a lot of, I do a lot of weird stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But squatting doesn&rsquo;t make your hips tight.</p>
<p>Squatting like shit makes your hips tight.</p>
<p>And so, but there is no perfect world where always our training program isn&rsquo;t quite perfect.</p>
<p>Our movement isn&rsquo;t necessarily perfect.</p>
<p>Like so you&rsquo;re going to have the needs for this stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re always have to do some soft tissue work to loosen up the same one for</p>
<p>that exercise, to be able to get a joint in position, there is a problem.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t do it, do it because I don&rsquo;t want you to have a joint.</p>
<p>Like if I can&rsquo;t get my shoulders in a position, I can&rsquo;t do overhead presses because I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to compromise my spine position.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to end up with some other problems.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So go ahead and clean that up so you can get in position, but go figure out why it is and</p>
<p>fix it.</p>
<p>And then maybe next, you know, three, four months from now, they&rsquo;re going to get a little</p>
<p>something else going on, fix it, but go understand the deeper root reason of why.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, I believe I am the only company manufacturing and selling, you know, fascial soft tissue</p>
<p>tools.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, I don&rsquo;t want you to use them.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not helping you get to the why, why it was caused in the first place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The goal, the goal, the perfect state is not having to use them.</p>
<p>Reality is you&rsquo;re going to have to use them from time to time because the world&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So your discovery is a hundred percent on point.</p>
<p>Well there&rsquo;s another side to combat sports when you&rsquo;re beginning a particular combat</p>
<p>sport, strength can be a negative because human psychology, because you can get away</p>
<p>with a lot when you&rsquo;re strong.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>So if your mind is strong enough to where you can just turn off that advantage and be</p>
<p>a beginner, truly in a particular art, that&rsquo;s probably the best way to do it.</p>
<p>But you can get away and then you don&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s hard not to use the little advantages you have because like jujitsu is a big hit</p>
<p>on an, on the ego for, you know, especially guys, you know, when like a smaller person</p>
<p>just destroys you, dominates you when you can, uh, I don&rsquo;t know, deadlift whatever number</p>
<p>of pounds.</p>
<p>And uh, it&rsquo;s hard not to use that strength to then resist the slow, the ultimate destruction</p>
<p>by like 120 pound, but that, and that&rsquo;s why I recommend developing the skill quality first,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, you can still do it so that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take it as a like, oh, I can&rsquo;t go that direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But understand those things and then also understand the jujitsu is additional load</p>
<p>on the body.</p>
<p>So you have to, you can&rsquo;t just add it on top.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to taper back the other, you&rsquo;re going to have to make a, I&rsquo;m sorry, you may</p>
<p>not want to hear it, but you&rsquo;re not going to be able to do as much and add that here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a compromise because your total volume still has to be there and there&rsquo;s not, unfortunately,</p>
<p>not really a way to measure what the jujitsu volume is with this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to take a look at that and that&rsquo;s where like measuring like heart rate variability</p>
<p>or other stuff can be useful so you can see what is happening from me from a sympathetic</p>
<p>versus parasympathetic nervous system standpoint.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Making sure your body recovers sufficiently and trying to put numbers to it.</p>
<p>You mentioned Kabuki strength.</p>
<p>You run the Kabuki strength lab previously called the elite performance center in Oregon.</p>
<p>You called it the perfect gym.</p>
<p>What makes for the perfect strength training gym?</p>
<p>Where I called it the perfect gym?</p>
<p>In a video somewhere I watched.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s where my testing grounds for developing all this stuff was through the</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>And, and so this is, like I said, I started developing relationships with the best developmental</p>
<p>kinesiologist in the, in the U S the best, arguably the best or most well known physical</p>
<p>therapist in the world, the best spine biomechanist in the world.</p>
<p>I started doing continuing education with these clinical courses and learning this stuff</p>
<p>and going, but how does it work in my world?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then I started lecturing with them and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>But the lab was like, where do we test this stuff?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so let me get to a point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always three things.</p>
<p>So to be a success, to achieve success, I believe there&rsquo;s three things that really,</p>
<p>really come into place and it&rsquo;s the right methodology, the right tools and the right</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>And so it was all about building that.</p>
<p>And so the methodologies came from a lot of that different, that gray area interaction</p>
<p>of clinical with sports science, right?</p>
<p>And then the tools I had to start creating and designing, and then the environment is</p>
<p>having this, you know, focused environment of people that want to do better and push</p>
<p>each other and having community and culture, right?</p>
<p>I ended up building these connections, this network, everything that I&rsquo;m doing with my</p>
<p>businesses is trying to create that into a scalable fashion.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m building the groundwork because to have a system that like, yeah, I had clinicals</p>
<p>on site that knew exactly what we were doing.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s me and a few people in a small team and all this stuff, we&rsquo;re all just like</p>
<p>easy to manage.</p>
<p>And you can see these, there&rsquo;s other models around this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been other areas since maybe whenever it was I filmed that video that said that,</p>
<p>that they have that same model and it&rsquo;s taken probably about a decade usually to develop</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>You know, and having the right people in this community, they can create this, this network</p>
<p>and the tool and all this stuff, right?</p>
<p>Except they still don&rsquo;t have the best tools because Kibuki strength didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>But but and so out of that was, is essentially I started building this business and people</p>
<p>like, when did you know how all this stuff was connected?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I just started creating on the outset the things that worked until finally I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recreating a scalable version of this stuff.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the methodologies and a coaching platform that we can manage clients around the globe</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;s working and not based on the scientific principles of training, right?</p>
<p>How do we create that into a database that now we can train new coaches and they can</p>
<p>use those same metrics and tools to create programs that are tailored to fit person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>individual needs, right?</p>
<p>Now how do we integrate that with assessment and clinical care assessment and all these</p>
<p>other pieces?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of work in that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where Kibuki strength is the genesis.</p>
<p>But we have, we call our gym the Kibuki strength lab.</p>
<p>Literally people find about our gym in the neighborhood and they&rsquo;re like, how long have</p>
<p>you been here?</p>
<p>Why, why do I not know about this?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t advertise our gym at all.</p>
<p>So like that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s because the only reason is to have a testing environment for the tools and</p>
<p>methodology and having enough people to have the culture and fit and to be able to be part</p>
<p>of the experiment.</p>
<p>What about the environment of the, the feel of it, the actual gym?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know, a grunginess to it.</p>
<p>I recently became a member of planet fitness for, for reasons that have to do more with</p>
<p>the heat in Austin that sometimes I need to put in time in the treadmill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any judgment, honestly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, the best gyms I&rsquo;ve been in are kind of dirty.</p>
<p>You walk in and you know that work is to be done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not another reason to do there.</p>
<p>It is the, the environment is tight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big piece of that.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s studied sociologically, I believe.</p>
<p>I just, I just pictured that word too, but the intensity, when you start growing a space,</p>
<p>the intensity drops.</p>
<p>And so I, I had that experience when we grew, we went from a 4,000 foot to a 9,000 square</p>
<p>foot gym at one time.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t feel the same.</p>
<p>Like people are complaining for years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve shrunk it back down whenever down to 3,500 square feet.</p>
<p>And it creates that intensity.</p>
<p>It creates the closest, the connection with the people around you.</p>
<p>And then like I said, the grunginess, like you go in, you know, the intention when you</p>
<p>walk in that environment creates that tension.</p>
<p>But when I speak environment, it&rsquo;s not just the, it&rsquo;s not the physical, it&rsquo;s the people.</p>
<p>But you know, when the gym is a little bit beat up, it also tells a story.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a history to it.</p>
<p>You could tell that not only is there work to be done, that work has been done here.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like battles have been fought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that where you&rsquo;re just in a long line of people, you know, that fought</p>
<p>and won.</p>
<p>And we could get into a whole nother space, there&rsquo;d be a whole nother topic, but that</p>
<p>existing energy of a space.</p>
<p>I mean, we mentioned offline, Joe Rogan, he talks about the same with comedy clubs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain, there&rsquo;s certain clubs that just have a history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an energy there.</p>
<p>You can get all woo woo, but you know, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>I think you walk in and you can feel it.</p>
<p>You feel it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That makes me feel that somehow all of us humans are connected in a ways that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to describe, even the ones who are no longer here.</p>
<p>Just the greatness that once was is still in the walls, in the space, present there.</p>
<p>And we somehow can plug into that energy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we can go down a, go down a path there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really powerful there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also mentioned a bunch of cool equipment that you&rsquo;ve developed as part of Kabuki Strength.</p>
<p>Probably a little bit of that has to do with your engineering education, but also just</p>
<p>generally with the spirit of the innovator that you are.</p>
<p>What are some cool, maybe revolutionary pieces of equipment that you&rsquo;re particularly proud</p>
<p>of or just you&rsquo;ve been obsessed with recently that you&rsquo;re developing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Love to talk about that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got some wild crazy stuff that just came out and is coming out too.</p>
<p>So everything that we create and release at Kabuki Strength, the industry hasn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff that&rsquo;s basic foundational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around forever because it works, but there&rsquo;s always more.</p>
<p>It could be better.</p>
<p>And why are we not looking at these things, these foundational things?</p>
<p>So when people are coming up with novel things, they ended up being way different outside</p>
<p>the perspective.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m coming up with things that are way different that are plays on what we already</p>
<p>know works.</p>
<p>So we talked about the transform bar, the only bar in the world.</p>
<p>We can manipulate spinal mechanics.</p>
<p>We can, so everything, everything for me from a design concept that we develop is all about</p>
<p>creating products that can rapidly accommodate to the variability of an individual&rsquo;s leverages,</p>
<p>mobility and training needs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to also create and distill down the size and scope of space that we need,</p>
<p>which is going to be, continue to be an ongoing thing.</p>
<p>Check out my Instagram after this and you&rsquo;ll see, I put an entire gym on the bed of my</p>
<p>truck and went on vacation last week, drove to the desert and by entire gym, I mean a</p>
<p>squat rack, full compliment of our specialty bars, a horizontal and vertical pulley system,</p>
<p>handheld weights, shoulder rock, like a complete, an entire gym in product that took up the</p>
<p>space the size of this bed right here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Because of the design scope of what we have.</p>
<p>So the cool thing is that there&rsquo;s two other bars that fit our biomechanically sound barbell</p>
<p>designs.</p>
<p>We talked about the transformer bar.</p>
<p>The other two are built on this thing I called playground physics.</p>
<p>So we have these bars with handles that are off parallel with the axis.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve been around the market for a long time.</p>
<p>One is a hex bar or a trap bar.</p>
<p>Another one is a, it&rsquo;s a pressing bar with the handles turned as well.</p>
<p>And both of them suck.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re horrible.</p>
<p>Any lifter knows if you pick it up, it&rsquo;s going to break your wrist and crush into your face.</p>
<p>And it just, it just doesn&rsquo;t feel good pressing, but it alleviates the strain on the wrist.</p>
<p>So people use it for that reason.</p>
<p>And the, the, the trap bar, same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always diving forward in your hand.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of limited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also limited in use because you can&rsquo;t, you could do a lot more with it.</p>
<p>So these bars are really cool playground physics.</p>
<p>So as soon as the center of rotation is on the same axis as the center of mass and the</p>
<p>handle is off center, you have, you have a teeter totter.</p>
<p>So a teeter totter has a balance point, but it&rsquo;s infinitely perfect.</p>
<p>So technically you can never find it.</p>
<p>So always going to be sitting on one side or the other in a playground.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what these bars are designed.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got instability right here.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t find the center of the bars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always trying to tip in your hands on the trap bar.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t do carries with it cause you&rsquo;re doing for momentum and it wants to, it wants</p>
<p>to dip on you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, the Swiss bar wants to crush your face.</p>
<p>Well, what do we do?</p>
<p>We just make a swing, but center of mass below center of rotation.</p>
<p>And what does it do?</p>
<p>Oh, it always finds center.</p>
<p>So, so the handles on the, our pressing bar it&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>So the handles are above center of rotation and then, and then every angle, instead of</p>
<p>just being a certain fixed angles, each angle is based on the width, the average width of</p>
<p>an individual.</p>
<p>So the internal and external rotational bias is based of the shoulder is based on the width,</p>
<p>leaving just a little bit left because we talked about the lap being a stabilizer.</p>
<p>You still need to have a little bit of cue of external rotation to engage that as a stabilizer.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden you have a bar and I kid you not, this is a great story.</p>
<p>Major league baseball.</p>
<p>When I presented it, every head strength coach for a major league baseball team, maybe not</p>
<p>every, but damn near most of them have bad shoulders.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t press.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotten shoulder surgeries, so on.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re showing them, they love all our stuff and I&rsquo;m like, Hey, I&rsquo;ve got this cool</p>
<p>prototype I want to show you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pressing bar.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, Oh, you know, major league baseball is a little hesitant on pressing</p>
<p>because the dangers for the shoulder and I can&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t been able to take a bar to</p>
<p>my chest.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d really love to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been five years since I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve been able to to XX train and I&rsquo;m like, just try</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Put a bar on my chest without pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, just try it.</p>
<p>Put it in there.</p>
<p>Ooh, that feels good.</p>
<p>Now the arc makes it actually three inches deeper.</p>
<p>So people are automatically scared.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s an extra range of motion.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, Ooh, put a plate on there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>By the time the staff&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re all standing around, you see like, what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on?</p>
<p>Put two plates on.</p>
<p>You see the, just like he gets up.</p>
<p>How do you feel like, I feel fine.</p>
<p>No pain at all.</p>
<p>I did this with five teams with five of the, it happening repeatedly five times that they</p>
<p>and every one of them worked up to two plates and did reps varied with zero pain to a three</p>
<p>inch range or greater range of major.</p>
<p>Cause what did we do?</p>
<p>We stacked all the joints and we provided stability at the end that we balanced internal</p>
<p>and external rotation.</p>
<p>I mean just basic playground physics and it changed the game.</p>
<p>Now we get a greater range of motion with a greater training effect with the negative</p>
<p>stresses removed.</p>
<p>Our trap bar opened up one side, which there was already some like that out there created.</p>
<p>It pops up so you can pick up, take the weights on and off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a built in Jack and then created the high handle position, which already did.</p>
<p>Everybody uses the high handle on a trap bar.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t know why they like it.</p>
<p>The handle that&rsquo;s on center, we offset just a little bit, not enough to make a difference</p>
<p>on the range of motion lift or even notice visibly, but it still has the same effect.</p>
<p>So both handles now have that.</p>
<p>We added the option of different handle sizes based on whatever your needs are.</p>
<p>One that rolls to develop a grip and then different widths that you could choose from</p>
<p>based on whether you&rsquo;re training a teen athlete or a seven foot six NBA player or a NFL lineman</p>
<p>so that we can accommodate for all these differences.</p>
<p>Now it becomes the most functional all around bar around because now you can do carries</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>You can do split squats with it.</p>
<p>You could do curls with it because it goes around the body.</p>
<p>You can do overhead presses because you don&rsquo;t have a thing that gets in your way and you</p>
<p>can flip it up into position.</p>
<p>You can do bent over rows and not run into your shins.</p>
<p>You can do seal rows off of a bench.</p>
<p>You can do ab rollouts.</p>
<p>You could, should I go on?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can use it as like the main bar.</p>
<p>The best multi purpose bar around.</p>
<p>You got a home gym, one bar.</p>
<p>Like how do you develop totally new equipment like this?</p>
<p>I scratch it on paper.</p>
<p>Maybe weld some cut up and weld up a prototype, but usually I just hand the scratched up paper</p>
<p>to my engineering manager and that&rsquo;s what he says his job is to distill my chicken scratch</p>
<p>into something real and then that team picks it up.</p>
<p>But in the old days, starting out, I just walk out, I just walk out and do it.</p>
<p>You talk about engineering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually more, I work more of an artist fashion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in my head and I just go create with no plans.</p>
<p>And so they have to pick that up and actually do the engineering and testing and all that.</p>
<p>And then we got two other products came out this year.</p>
<p>Freaking wild.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with training with a flywheel?</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s a flywheel.</p>
<p>A flywheel is a spinning object that creates an inertial mass and then it reverses direction.</p>
<p>So whatever you put into it and there&rsquo;s ones out there.</p>
<p>But ours is the first patent pending.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all everything all in one unit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a floor based as well as a horizontal.</p>
<p>So you can basically do any pulley movement in the world.</p>
<p>And now everything that you put into it on a concentric force, it whips right back as</p>
<p>a peak centric load.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an accelerating whipping motion.</p>
<p>It just yeah, basically, yeah, I mean, okay, I have to have trouble imagining exactly many</p>
<p>of the things you&rsquo;re describing, I suppose, have to be experienced, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a magic and there&rsquo;s a lot of research.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been around.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re adopted more heavily in Europe, quite heavily in Europe, but not as much in the</p>
<p>US because they sell them as a be all end all tool, which they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re crazy for what they do, but it&rsquo;s not the it&rsquo;s another tool.</p>
<p>And so we have a very high quality unit now that is half the cost of everybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because the innovation of a movable mount point that you for them, you have to have</p>
<p>two pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>We have one.</p>
<p>So and then a few other things, better platform to be able to do things and that we can do</p>
<p>what we call off platform work, which allows us to do movements like punches and standups,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got a handheld weight coming out next month that we can actually play with.</p>
<p>So varying the load with it, never leaving your hand by changing the leverage point.</p>
<p>And so what do we think?</p>
<p>What exercise are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Anything that would be a dumbbell or a kettlebell movement.</p>
<p>So it functions, it does the function of a kettlebell, a dumbbell and what we call a</p>
<p>center mass bell, as well as provides variable loading within a range.</p>
<p>So how can you change like how can you change the load?</p>
<p>Because load.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t actually change the load.</p>
<p>We change the torque on the on the joint that we&rsquo;re working, which is the same.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what is creating the force.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m doing a front raise, it&rsquo;s where this this downward force is times the distance</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which also then makes it no force when I&rsquo;ve got at the bottom of the front raise, which</p>
<p>is why it&rsquo;s so easy with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a kettlebell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s offset, except it has three different handles.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s offset just that a kettlebell, you can&rsquo;t do it because the offset so far it becomes</p>
<p>a wrist movement.</p>
<p>So ours has three different sizes and the offset just enough so that you can pick.</p>
<p>If I put it in a front raise position or curl position, I could put it in outward position</p>
<p>and the force is almost what it is at the at the top.</p>
<p>Then I get the top and it&rsquo;s the same exact or the curl.</p>
<p>So I can actually change the force curve in the movement and then I can just release the</p>
<p>pressure a little bit and let it swing into position and keep doing a drop set with never</p>
<p>letting it down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got a really nice texture grip that allows you to hold it in different positions.</p>
<p>And then the load offset is just enough that it doesn&rsquo;t overpower the wrist.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got different hand sizes so that you can maximize this relationship and</p>
<p>hit whatever joint that you&rsquo;re applying.</p>
<p>So sounds incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really freaking well, it&rsquo;s awesome because you can because the variable load.</p>
<p>Now I could go straight from front raises to side raises or rear or curl because without</p>
<p>like because I don&rsquo;t have to put it down.</p>
<p>So now my time under tension goes through the roof.</p>
<p>And by the way, the same effect with a flywheel trainer because the variable whatever you</p>
<p>put into it is what it kicks back.</p>
<p>So you have a constant time under tension because there&rsquo;s no rest points either.</p>
<p>So all this stuff is working on maximizing time under tension, which anyway, it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, I get excited.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about another thing you&rsquo;ve already mentioned, but I find this really</p>
<p>interesting, which is barefoot running and you&rsquo;re sort of a company, Barefoot Athletics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the tagline is optimizing the human to ground interface.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit with the power lifting.</p>
<p>How do you think about the the foot ground interface?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that we know that we should train all these parts of our body to be able</p>
<p>to be stronger, be more resilient.</p>
<p>But we think that the foot is different, that we need to package it and modify it.</p>
<p>And somehow that that&rsquo;s the science of making it healthy where I challenge people think</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>Like first thing you do in the morning is roll out of bed and put your weightlifting</p>
<p>belt on and wrap it on tight and wear it till you go to bed at night.</p>
<p>Do it with your shoulders, your knees, wake up and put some knee wraps on an elbow wraps</p>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ll get weaker, you&rsquo;ll lose movement capacity and you&rsquo;ll start affecting other</p>
<p>areas of the body very negatively because they will start picking up the compensation</p>
<p>for those joints that are not moving properly.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>What shoes are for is to protect you from the environment, from cuts and abrasions and</p>
<p>heat and things like that.</p>
<p>But the foot, let me the mind blowing is like every other area of the body.</p>
<p>You need to use it and you need to strengthen it and you need to learn to control it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I have to say about the subject.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>But somehow we have been sold entire industries like the orthotics industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely false.</p>
<p>Meta analysis of the data shows that orthotics do nothing beyond temporary relief from pain</p>
<p>over a six, eight week period of time and provide no long term benefit.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people I&rsquo;ve eliminated back or knee or hip pain from getting</p>
<p>from working on strengthening and controlling the foot and ankle complex.</p>
<p>We believe we&rsquo;ve villainized and said a low arch is a condition that needs fixed.</p>
<p>Like when it really is just controlling the foot and ankle complex and how they relate</p>
<p>to each other and how we use that.</p>
<p>Is it like go put on boxing gloves in the morning and do that for the next 20 years</p>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about finding the right shoe that fits because your foot has been deformed.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not like some wacky go like, oh, you got to be barefoot forever.</p>
<p>Do this like, no, I&rsquo;m just saying go spend some time using it, strengthen it, learn to</p>
<p>control it and you will work better in a shoe.</p>
<p>But the whole running shoe movement with the raised heel, that was the person that that</p>
<p>suggested that that in to Nike way back when they were trying to figure out what to do,</p>
<p>the reason, and he says it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that he ever did.</p>
<p>Because we were coming from an era of people wearing heeled shoes, which by the way came</p>
<p>from stirrups way back in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the whole heel came from is to go into stirrup, but then it went into fashion.</p>
<p>And then the running craze started coming around in the seventies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re starting to push this, the general mass population.</p>
<p>And they realized that they were causing injuries and like, what are we going to do?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because everybody was in this position and had a shortened, a shortened</p>
<p>calf muscle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, the work around, let&rsquo;s just put a heel on it so we don&rsquo;t injure them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And now because the raised heel, you got to raise the toe.</p>
<p>And then now with that, if you go stand on something and pull your inner toe in and in</p>
<p>a squat position, just reach down and do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that you have no control over internal or next door and rotation of your, of, of</p>
<p>your leg.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t and, or your foot and you actually have to put a support in for the arch to be</p>
<p>able to passively control those structures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just bandaid on top of bandaid on top of bandaid.</p>
<p>Use it, strengthen it.</p>
<p>If you want to wear some shoes cause they look good or fancy, I&rsquo;m like, I have no problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I go out on a wife.</p>
<p>My wife will put on some high heels every now and again.</p>
<p>But all I&rsquo;m saying is use your foot.</p>
<p>My thousand pound squat, my thousand pound deadlift, we&rsquo;re done barefoot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to sell you shoes.</p>
<p>Go do it with no shoe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been promoting.</p>
<p>I did that for six years and I promoted it, but people ask me like, well, what do I do?</p>
<p>Because my gym requires shoes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do I go?</p>
<p>And uh, and then I go, well, you know, you could pick up these other finger shoes or</p>
<p>whatever and they go, man, my wife won&rsquo;t have sex with me if I do that.</p>
<p>And I go, I know mine either.</p>
<p>Like trust me, I&rsquo;m not making this up.</p>
<p>Basically in that market markets to one segment and they&rsquo;re still missing some gaps because</p>
<p>they, they still have a little bit too narrow of a toe box.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re lifting, you have the opportunity to really get that splay and start working</p>
<p>on this stuff better.</p>
<p>So, um, I just wanted to create a shoe.</p>
<p>These ones are odd colored cause it&rsquo;s a partnership with Kabuki.</p>
<p>Normally we&rsquo;ve got a black or a gray, uh, low top, high top sticks to the ground for</p>
<p>lifting so we can do that and very pliable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moccasin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a modern day moccasin, but looks okay that you can wear it around in other areas.</p>
<p>If you, if you so choose, like, you know what the number one healthcare costs in America</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that diabetes, uh, heart disease, cancer, low back pain.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Now, what do you attribute a little back pain to?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s attributed to a lot of things, um, but inability to control spinal position,</p>
<p>um, which starts happening from, uh, some breathing issues.</p>
<p>Uh, it also happens from the foot.</p>
<p>Um, so there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff, but everything that I do actually focus on improving this.</p>
<p>Uh, that, and it all starts with this is one thing, like this doesn&rsquo;t affect breathing,</p>
<p>but, um, so it does actually affect breathing to some extent and spinal stabilization.</p>
<p>So the raised heel and toe will make you stride further, um, because of just how it operates,</p>
<p>but that overstride is a result of opening this.</p>
<p>So we opened the pelvis and diaphragm.</p>
<p>Did we talk about that and the impact that that has for controlling and spine?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we touched on that.</p>
<p>Um, but it, it&rsquo;s all this stuff plays together.</p>
<p>So the gait affects that.</p>
<p>And so the shoe affects the gait and then, so it&rsquo;s all connected.</p>
<p>All connected.</p>
<p>Let me be very purposeful with some conversation here though.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about periodization.</p>
<p>This was a big gap.</p>
<p>So, um, people go, yeah, well when people started running with those, they started having</p>
<p>injuries back when, uh, the finger, uh, company produced those and didn&rsquo;t do the education</p>
<p>around this very simple concept.</p>
<p>You do not walk into the gym if you haven&rsquo;t squatted and start squatting 225 from, from</p>
<p>max recs every week, day or every day over day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people did because they didn&rsquo;t weren&rsquo;t told that you need to build the capacity</p>
<p>to do this.</p>
<p>You go wear these and walk around in your office or wherever all day long, your feet</p>
<p>are going to hurt.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be sore.</p>
<p>Do it for 10% of your time.</p>
<p>Do that for a month, then add some.</p>
<p>That will build the capacity to do this.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s going to start having the ability to strengthen, manage the foot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole lot of other stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got videos on things that you can do by whatever you want or just, just spend some</p>
<p>time out of them.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s all that I want people to do because it is so simple and it has such a</p>
<p>profound impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>I, what I did, uh, I noticed when you walked out, when I walked in, I was like, Oh, Hey,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re spending some time without the last shoes on.</p>
<p>Uh, well, what I did, um, I think it&rsquo;s already now two years ago and I was doing a lot of</p>
<p>running.</p>
<p>I do like a 10 mile run.</p>
<p>I would take my shoes off for the last like half mile and I run like that.</p>
<p>And that was for me really helpful to ensure that I have proper form.</p>
<p>Form that minimizes pain on the way I run.</p>
<p>I still like shoes.</p>
<p>I benefit a lot from shoes, the protection they provide, but it&rsquo;s for running we&rsquo;re referring</p>
<p>to, uh, especially trail running and so on.</p>
<p>And in the city when there&rsquo;s glass and all those kinds of things, uh, but it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important to have minimal sort of protection on your feet.</p>
<p>For me, at least it was to figure out the ways that my form basic movement and like</p>
<p>the positioning in the foot, the impact of the foot and everything, you know, the, the,</p>
<p>the lower leg, the entirety of the torso, really how it&rsquo;s improperly positioned in</p>
<p>terms for the objective of minimizing pain and the barefoot running really helped fix</p>
<p>that for me.</p>
<p>Cause I figured out that I need to take shorter steps, more frequent, you know, all those</p>
<p>kinds of things.</p>
<p>And that really helps you figure that out.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s be realist about stuff, like, um, spend some time using it, strengthen it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got some great ways to do that and learn how to do that.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>What is a good diet for strength development?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just to give you some context, I&rsquo;ve been eating mostly meat, not for strength, mostly</p>
<p>for mental performance.</p>
<p>I just enjoy it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You need to have a base level of protein building blocks for tissue, right?</p>
<p>We need to have enough fats to be able to have hormones work and key processes in the</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>We need to have, well, you don&rsquo;t need to have from a performance aspect carbohydrates necessarily</p>
<p>because the other ones can convert into injury sources, but for a performance athlete, carbohydrates</p>
<p>can be very beneficial, uh, as well.</p>
<p>So, um, so I look at it as you want, you need a base level fats, you need a base level of</p>
<p>proteins and then you adjust the carbohydrate intake based on the needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not anti carbohydrate by any means, um, cause a lot of people will, they look at me</p>
<p>now when they see like how lean I am and they, they jump to a conclusion, you must be keto.</p>
<p>You must be carnivore.</p>
<p>You must be whatever.</p>
<p>Like, so losing and gaining weight is simply eating less or eating more.</p>
<p>I mean it, ah, and it, we get so complicated.</p>
<p>Oh, that my fat, they&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s your fasting window?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m, if I&rsquo;m doing fasting, it&rsquo;s just because it works with my, my environment.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>All that does is control how much calories that you take big success with keto and carnivore</p>
<p>diets.</p>
<p>A lot, uh, and, and put on weight with those, with those diets, um, you know, protein actually</p>
<p>has a thermogenic effect.</p>
<p>And so you have to have a massive amount of fats if you have a only meat diet because</p>
<p>you can literally starve to death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a show where they put people out in the wilderness and this guy, the one</p>
<p>that won, one of the ones I looked on, they threw him way like up in the, uh, uh, past</p>
<p>a lot, you know, out the way out there, there was nothing, but he somehow got a caribou</p>
<p>and killed it.</p>
<p>And he still lost a pound a day for 30 days with the caribou because his fat was stolen</p>
<p>by a, uh, uh, and, and he could eat all the meat he wanted and then he almost got pulled</p>
<p>because his weight loss.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, but that isn&rsquo;t actually a performance.</p>
<p>So those types of keto and carnivore are not performance diets.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not going to be as effective at supplying, uh, the energy needs for high capacity</p>
<p>training.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, you can be a successful, like elite athlete with a, with a vegan diet, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as easy to do it with other diets.</p>
<p>So on you&rsquo;re missing some base nutrients, so many nutrients and meat, I believe, uh,</p>
<p>having greens in your diet is really beneficial.</p>
<p>Lots of research, but there&rsquo;s people in the other worlds that argue that they don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>them, but they help clear organs, provide micronutrients, all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>So I eat simply a whole well rounded diet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gone from, I can go from 285 pounds squat and a ton of weight to eating less and</p>
<p>dropping all the way down to, you know, seven, 8% body fat with veins standing out everywhere</p>
<p>without a tissue on me, just with amazing, great tasting food to lose weight or be healthy</p>
<p>does not mean that you need to eat flavorless bland food.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main thing I try to get across.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Eat less to lose weight.</p>
<p>Eat more to gain weight.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Make sure that you&rsquo;ve got enough protein.</p>
<p>Make sure that you&rsquo;ve got your micronutrients covered, which is going to cover by eating</p>
<p>real food.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go low fat, no fat.</p>
<p>If you want a performance, don&rsquo;t go no carb, but if it works, any of those things.</p>
<p>So diet approach, when you look at diets, understand that they&rsquo;re how aggressive they</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>So like keto can make you lose a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Carnivore can make you lose a lot of weight.</p>
<p>A lot of that upfront is actually dropping glycogen stores.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually just reducing water in your muscle and fat tissue.</p>
<p>So which is why it doesn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t as great for a performance diet.</p>
<p>But understand that every diet also has a level of discipline and does it fit your lifestyle?</p>
<p>So I suggest people don&rsquo;t find a diet.</p>
<p>You need to find a lifestyle because that&rsquo;s what sustainable, I hate the word diet to</p>
<p>begin with.</p>
<p>But behaviors are sustainable and then do that and then over time the things you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get to where you need to get.</p>
<p>Diet itself, just by the name of it is not sustainable because it is a short term thing</p>
<p>to get somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to try to measure it because I definitely have a love heat relationship</p>
<p>with food.</p>
<p>I tend to look back and say like by following this particular protocol, lifestyle, whatever,</p>
<p>what was the level of happiness?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So not like weight loss or weight gain or all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the entirety of the picture, productivity, just feeling good throughout the day, socially</p>
<p>also, like interacting with people.</p>
<p>Because so much of a human connection, like I mentioned before, is over food.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to limit yourself in that regard, you&rsquo;re limiting a certain fundamental</p>
<p>aspect of life.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, I did like 20 to 22 hour fasts every day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, this doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do business lunches and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So when I was in my fasting thing, I went to a 16 so I could have a light lunch just</p>
<p>for the social aspect of it and perform that.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s why the typical bodybuilding, like the eight meal a day diet has never worked</p>
<p>for me because I&rsquo;ve always been a very bit like trying to fit that between meetings and</p>
<p>other stuff.</p>
<p>What that diet provides is it just you get less bloat in distention of a larger meal.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, you get the same exact results.</p>
<p>Pick a lifestyle, live that you can have really great tasting food.</p>
<p>And that to me is the same thing.</p>
<p>And this is why I&rsquo;m like really hitting this point, because also with the dieting and like</p>
<p>the approach like, oh, I&rsquo;m going to do this and people pick these chicken and broccoli</p>
<p>recipes and guess what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to break.</p>
<p>If you do not, if you do not enjoy it, you will break.</p>
<p>So it is a very important point.</p>
<p>Well, I also slightly push back or maybe to elaborate, if you don&rsquo;t enjoy moderation,</p>
<p>for me particularly, I have trouble moderating certain things, most foods, I would say.</p>
<p>So my source of happiness comes with foods, even if they&rsquo;re bland, the ones that can enjoy,</p>
<p>but enjoy moderation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I mean, I enjoy every piece of food.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s if you can enjoy the full lifestyle, it&rsquo;s not just the particular experience,</p>
<p>but like the full journey.</p>
<p>Does it fit your lifestyle?</p>
<p>So let me ask about a complicated topic that&rsquo;s sometimes a bit controversial, which is steroids</p>
<p>and maybe TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>What role does that play in strength training?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an important discussion to have.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s something that I can be more transparent on.</p>
<p>In my past, I wasn&rsquo;t able to do to the career that I had.</p>
<p>So just like covering that stuff in a, you know, one of the, on a public forum when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>highly looked at being an executive for recruiting and other stuff, like it was an area I had</p>
<p>to just kind of pass on, right?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve used steroids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them since I was 33 and I basically just use TRT now after my big squat.</p>
<p>So for 10 years I used them and there&rsquo;s some interesting components to this.</p>
<p>So one is just the gray area of what we call performance enhancing supplements.</p>
<p>So performance was a PEDs that the line of what defines a PED is ever shifting and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shifting based on society norms, cultural norms, government body agencies, all these</p>
<p>sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not making excuses here.</p>
<p>So I just want to elaborate before I actually start digging into the details here because</p>
<p>performance enhancing, I could take sodium bicarbonate and enhance my ability to perform</p>
<p>deadlifts for reps.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>I did that for my Guinness world record for deadlifts in a minute.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>People do it for rowing or other, they use a high capacity type stuff.</p>
<p>It is performance enhancing.</p>
<p>It is a chemical, it is baking soda, all right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not able to make it illegal because everybody eats bread, well, not everyone.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a little hard to test for no matter what you do at any level.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an extreme example, but other examples, you&rsquo;re drinking an energy drink in that cup</p>
<p>there a little while ago and in America you can get an energy drink with 240 milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine in it.</p>
<p>In Canada, that&rsquo;s too dangerous.</p>
<p>You can only get 140, but you can go buy a ephedra and ephedra is illegal in America.</p>
<p>And so these things bounce back and forth all the time.</p>
<p>I could take Yohimbi and in Europe or Australia, it is a drug and classified and America, it</p>
<p>is not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an herbal root in a lot, I actually have one of my supplements except for the overseas</p>
<p>version.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point I&rsquo;m getting is no matter what you do at some point, by someone&rsquo;s standards,</p>
<p>you are cheating.</p>
<p>And because it is, you&rsquo;re taking something that, but you could work around these things</p>
<p>with nutritional ways or other ways versus taking a chemical strip and there&rsquo;s whole</p>
<p>lots of ways to do this, but it&rsquo;s like, oh no, it&rsquo;s steroids, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s injectable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So somewhere there&rsquo;s a culture or a person that will say you&rsquo;re cheating no matter what.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a self defined, you need to define it for yourself unless you&rsquo;re competing in</p>
<p>an organization that has testing, then it&rsquo;s a straight ethical thing and it&rsquo;s either right</p>
<p>or wrong in my opinion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the overall dilemma of it is if you want to see what you&rsquo;re totally capable</p>
<p>of, you have to decide yourself what&rsquo;s okay or not to that level.</p>
<p>There is no body that can say something yes or no.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s an event like the Olympics, maybe then you have a standard that you&rsquo;re all trying</p>
<p>to adhere to and then it makes sense to keep a certain, like to be within, there&rsquo;s an ethical</p>
<p>imperative.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m not talking about that, I&rsquo;m agreeing to compete in this by these rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, but when you&rsquo;re trying to maximize your own performance, whatever that journey is,</p>
<p>whatever that goal is, that&rsquo;s a different story and it&rsquo;s not easy to figure that out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like dancing around the subject, whatever.</p>
<p>Well guess what, I&rsquo;ve got a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s legal for me to take and you know what?</p>
<p>A lot of the people that are in front of the camera in the media, politicians and news</p>
<p>people and the people that are there saying the no drug stuff, they&rsquo;re going to anti aging</p>
<p>clinics to look better and they have a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone themselves.</p>
<p>But in their eyes, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It is a prescription from their doctor because they have the money to do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s legal and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If I is interesting in Oregon, anybody and I don&rsquo;t know what other states over the age</p>
<p>of 16 can without parents permission by the way, walk into a gender clinic and as a female</p>
<p>and get a prescription for testosterone.</p>
<p>But as an athlete, if I&rsquo;ve got low testosterone, I am so flow, I&rsquo;ve got depression, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have sex with my wife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s affecting my quality of life.</p>
<p>I will have to fight tooth and nail to get testosterone just as a prescription and then</p>
<p>I will get kicked out of my organization for competing.</p>
<p>So you understand how gray this stuff gets.</p>
<p>Do you think the stigma on testosterone is the reason we&rsquo;re not having like a healthy</p>
<p>conversation about when it&rsquo;s proper?</p>
<p>Like what are the proper uses of testosterone in an athlete&rsquo;s life and just the regular</p>
<p>human life?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I said, it is lines that we pick and draw.</p>
<p>Anytime you put that out there, people are going to have different opinions where those</p>
<p>lines are.</p>
<p>So now when it comes to strength, here&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>In powerlifting, there&rsquo;s tested federations and non tested federations.</p>
<p>So we can literally look at the statistical data and actually find out what do steroids</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s pretty clear that steroids provide about a 10% increase in strength on average</p>
<p>over not.</p>
<p>Now that does take out the fact that steroids will put you in, allow you to put on more</p>
<p>mass so you&rsquo;ll go up a weight class a lot of times.</p>
<p>So as a whole, you could definitely lift more probably than the 10% over time, right?</p>
<p>And then we think about steroids as the ability to just put on muscle.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where things get a little interesting, even with people that use steroids is not</p>
<p>understanding the neurological impacts that steroids have.</p>
<p>Because you could take some steroids right now and be stronger in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly not done anything, you know, from a physiology standpoint to make you stronger.</p>
<p>But we have a tapped in neurologically to to elicit those games.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole lot that happens neurologically.</p>
<p>Like how much science is there in terms of all the different ways you could take steroids,</p>
<p>which kinds of steroids, the timing, the dose, the all of those things to develop the neurological,</p>
<p>the physical, the skeletal, like all the, you know, you&rsquo;ve talked with such depth about</p>
<p>the science of strength building in terms of form, in terms of the equipment that you</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>It seems like a component, you know, the use of steroids should be an equal level of scientific</p>
<p>rigor when applying them.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Now, the research is harder to get because of what it is.</p>
<p>But there is a lot of research that was done when they were legal.</p>
<p>So they were legal up in through the through, I think, the mid 80s.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the classical high, high benefit to low risk steroids were studied.</p>
<p>And then since then, there&rsquo;s a lot of like designer steroids or new steroids that have</p>
<p>come up that don&rsquo;t have a lot of research around safety and risk and things of that</p>
<p>nature.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t do that because it&rsquo;s, you know, because of the legality around these things.</p>
<p>But some of the stuff on the neurological function is really just understanding how</p>
<p>that chemical structure works and what it&rsquo;s doing to the neurotransmitters, what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>And so some of it is is really talking to people that have experience with it.</p>
<p>And the other is understanding those structures and what they do.</p>
<p>The neurological component, I think, is more interesting than than most, because the most</p>
<p>steroids act through increasing muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you add more muscle is they have an anti catabolic effect and they have a muscle</p>
<p>protein synthesis enhancing effect.</p>
<p>So it reduces the amount of muscle that you waste and increases the amount of muscle that</p>
<p>you put on.</p>
<p>But the neurological component is is tremendously valuable for what it can do for your training</p>
<p>workout.</p>
<p>Like if I handle more load over time, I&rsquo;m going to make more progress.</p>
<p>If I can actually just stimulate more neurological effects for a specific event, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>have an impact.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other ways that you can tap into this, too.</p>
<p>Things that you can tap into mentally with great practice, with meditation and other</p>
<p>stuff that will have the same effect.</p>
<p>People probably think I&rsquo;m over speaking, especially steroid users that are listening to this.</p>
<p>Well, at least I&rsquo;m talking out my ass, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Because I I have experience with this stuff on both ends.</p>
<p>And some of those areas, a lot of people don&rsquo;t have the experience with that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve kind of heard from people is the confidence that comes with steroids.</p>
<p>It feels like not to call it placebo, but it seems like the psychological benefits of</p>
<p>steroids is huge and that you feel like there&rsquo;s a confidence that seems to be coupled with</p>
<p>the actual biological and chemical effects.</p>
<p>I have actually a neurological condition.</p>
<p>So I actually don&rsquo;t feel a lot of that stuff that people because there are certain steroids</p>
<p>that like people like you&rsquo;re like very extreme ones, like that would make somebody bite someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ear off in a fight, for example, almost like aggression that and they literally do nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like always just chillin and I don&rsquo;t like that effect.</p>
<p>But but neurologically, they&rsquo;re still having those effects, but I don&rsquo;t get those feels</p>
<p>that other people have from those.</p>
<p>But yes, there&rsquo;s that immediate boost in aggression and a confidence and stuff that come with</p>
<p>a lot of those ones that deal on the neurological overall as good sense of well being, just</p>
<p>like from being on testosterone, like it&rsquo;s going to affect your mood.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So testosterone replacement therapy, if we walk down that path now and kind of switch</p>
<p>gears, you know, we find that men today have declining testosterone over what has historically</p>
<p>been in the past.</p>
<p>So right now, I think a thirty five year old testosterone is shown to be about half what</p>
<p>it was just 50 years ago.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if we could argue the point.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have the science to validate any of it, but it could be society as far</p>
<p>as the impact that it&rsquo;s having on the mental health for men.</p>
<p>It could be the the estrogens floating around in the water from all the chemicals and birth</p>
<p>control and all this sort of stuff could be a lot of things.</p>
<p>But it is a fact that average testosterone is significantly lower and that is going to</p>
<p>end up affecting life, quality of life, as well as your longevity, because it will affect</p>
<p>those things.</p>
<p>But on the other end, steroids and TRT, particularly steroids, come with a lot of negative health</p>
<p>benefits, not benefits, a lot of negative health ramifications.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if I knew what I know now, I don&rsquo;t know that I would have gone that path.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t till I was thirty three, which is kind of an outlier for a strength athlete.</p>
<p>I was I was a four times body weight deadlifter, eight hundred plus pounds at one ninety eight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty dang strong before I went down that path.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I wanted to see what I was capable of.</p>
<p>But I was reaching a point that it was either I need to do that or not.</p>
<p>My testosterone, my natural testosterone levels were actually I think below 300 is actually</p>
<p>the threshold.</p>
<p>So I was being told to go on TRT for the last couple of years, probably just because I was</p>
<p>pushing so hard and the stress level was driving my test down.</p>
<p>So it was self imposed more than likely.</p>
<p>But I put it off because I wanted to set all the drug free records and I set the ones that</p>
<p>I wanted.</p>
<p>And then it was thirty three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, entering the age category and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to go on TRT.</p>
<p>I did not feel like I should be with TRT personally.</p>
<p>My ethical standard was I shouldn&rsquo;t be competing in tested events anymore.</p>
<p>There are federations that will allow you with your you show up with your script and</p>
<p>you do your test and you&rsquo;re below a certain level, but you&rsquo;re still on.</p>
<p>But for me, I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, I may as well at this point use steroids.</p>
<p>But since then, you know, understanding all those ramifications, you know, I might not</p>
<p>have gone down that route quite so fast and easily.</p>
<p>But I continued because I also have a lot of resources that other people don&rsquo;t and being</p>
<p>able to assess and understand and put things in place to mitigate that.</p>
<p>So you need to be.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, once you go on, it&rsquo;s literally a decision for life.</p>
<p>Not just but realistically is because your your quality of life, your feeling is going</p>
<p>to be enhanced quite a bit and you&rsquo;re not going to want to go back.</p>
<p>And if you go back, it&rsquo;s going to be less than it was before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the endocrine system works.</p>
<p>There are ways to try to recover and bring that up, but it might be a while.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve been on for a while, it definitely is not an option.</p>
<p>So those are big things that people need to understand that you&rsquo;re going to have some</p>
<p>things in there.</p>
<p>And even TRT has some potential, especially at higher levels, that it&rsquo;s going to, you</p>
<p>know, increase the risk for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to potentially cause some hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart and some</p>
<p>potential plaque buildup of some of those key arteries around there that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>have an impact on your cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that you can do again, but everything is like the shoe story, right?</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m anti anti shoe, but I&rsquo;m going, well, we could put band aids on this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a quality of life that comes with it, the increase in quality of life.</p>
<p>And if you do it correctly, I think for me, for me, I definitely would not live without</p>
<p>TRT, even with knowing what I know now.</p>
<p>It this age and the quality of life and being able to be there, have the energy, the recovery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big thing where all this, though, I talked about muscle protein synthesis and</p>
<p>anti catabolism as being big drivers.</p>
<p>But recovery is the other big aspect that they that they offer probably as a result</p>
<p>of those, but that&rsquo;s going to those are going to be the big enhancement.</p>
<p>So just doing steroids, steroids is going to increase all the other stuff that you do.</p>
<p>So if you if you have good training, if good diet, good quality of sleep, like all this</p>
<p>other stuff, then you can take advantage of that.</p>
<p>But you could choose steroids and nobody would know.</p>
<p>And honestly, you go down to 24 hour fitness and you&rsquo;ll see a bunch of, you know, late,</p>
<p>you know, 19 to 21 year old kids that are all kind of red and one hundred and fifty</p>
<p>pounds that look like that don&rsquo;t look like anything.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re a bunch of them will be using steroids because they&rsquo;re not like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the it&rsquo;s not going to make a champion, like you said, it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to at most.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>I was already at an elite level.</p>
<p>I was one of the best in the world before I started using it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It does a 10 percent increase at best.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s proven in the statistics, which is interesting because most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>Like it the data is right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m often saddened by maybe the negative view of somebody like Lance Armstrong,</p>
<p>who is one of the greatest athletes in history and everybody else that he was competing against.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I hate to blow anybody&rsquo;s bubble.</p>
<p>But regardless, if I told you my ethical pieces with saying that you&rsquo;re going to be at something</p>
<p>at an elite level.</p>
<p>You look at most a lot of those big figures out there.</p>
<p>When their income in your life relies on it, yeah, you&rsquo;re going to push those limits.</p>
<p>So maybe maybe my ethical would change if if if I was in that position, too, because</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing where I believe like someone is.</p>
<p>I think people should avoid steroids.</p>
<p>TRT, probably something worth taking a look at what your levels are when you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>thirty five to forty five range and see what decision you decide to make from there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a decision that you make for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The only times that you should be taking a look at steroids is if it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s funding your</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating that it is your job and it&rsquo;s doing like and honestly, it was for me.</p>
<p>I so was it the only thing?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>If you want to get into neurology, it&rsquo;s neurotransmitters and alcohol is really interesting discussion</p>
<p>on performance enhancement.</p>
<p>So when I lift heavy and so I always promote it, like not more than a drink or two, like</p>
<p>once or twice a month is what all I&rsquo;m talking about when I&rsquo;m what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the timing of the drink?</p>
<p>Are we talking about three to five minutes before?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about beer.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter the the source.</p>
<p>So I shots are the easiest.</p>
<p>You want something that is not going to have some sort of regurgitory effect or bloating</p>
<p>effect or anything like that, but you want to have the quick hit of energy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a preferential energy source moves above ketones, carbs, everything at seven</p>
<p>calories per gram.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s some really interesting things that happen, spikes blood pressure, which</p>
<p>is going to make weights feel lighter.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re in your early 20s and you&rsquo;re trying to hit up, you know, some attractive</p>
<p>person at the bar, you&rsquo;re with your buddies and you&rsquo;re like, you know, and you got second</p>
<p>guess.</p>
<p>Oh, should I?</p>
<p>Should I?</p>
<p>And they go, have a shot of liquid courage and you have one.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden the second thoughts, the second guessing all that drops away.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re focused in the moment and you walk over and you actually perform a little</p>
<p>better like conversation wise than you normally would.</p>
<p>Now if you have five or six and then go over, you&rsquo;re gonna make a fool of yourself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about timing and amount.</p>
<p>But there is a reason that that happens.</p>
<p>So anyway, I&rsquo;m known for promoting this whiskey and deadlift concept.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>But it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Eastern block.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it came.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I stole it from.</p>
<p>Because I was watching all these Russian lifters would have a shot of vodka or something before</p>
<p>they go lift.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>So I started experimenting with it and I&rsquo;m like, that works.</p>
<p>And then I started researching.</p>
<p>Nobody talks about this stuff.</p>
<p>So it takes a while to start piecing together all the stuff that actually happens to make</p>
<p>that happen.</p>
<p>But it moves away the things that you&rsquo;re going to, the concerns about the ramifications in</p>
<p>the future and the other stuff.</p>
<p>So the, um, but brings you into the moment and then the dopamine hit and the other, and</p>
<p>then it enhances whatever mood that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden you get in the state much easier.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really, really interesting, but it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s a very small amount needed</p>
<p>and very time sensitive, but it can be so much more powerful than like drugs people</p>
<p>use for this stuff.</p>
<p>It ties really together with meditative state and other pieces to, to, to get you into that</p>
<p>flow state, those thoughts about failure, what if, what, like all that you, you get</p>
<p>into that zone, that moment, that time anyway.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>An alcoholic is promoting out, you know, but there&rsquo;s an important point here, which not</p>
<p>often talked about.</p>
<p>I think it is fascinating that because you can get into so much trouble with alcohol</p>
<p>when used in excess, people don&rsquo;t often talk about the, the positive aspects of alcohol,</p>
<p>even in your college years.</p>
<p>It had a, it had a lasting effect on who I am as a person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people give enough credit to the positive aspect.</p>
<p>See, you could have accomplished a lot of those same things with a little more moderation,</p>
<p>which I think people should talk about more, which is like the way to open up a personality,</p>
<p>like the flowering of the full character and the weirdness and the, the, the, like the</p>
<p>beauty of who you are as a human being could be opened up with alcohol.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>You should try some podcasts with a, with a shot and, and these, I do this sometimes</p>
<p>with myself and guests and it will change the conversation, lubricates the conversation.</p>
<p>Definitely not the excess and which is what I learned because I went all the way in because</p>
<p>I do everything at extremes.</p>
<p>So it was a really hard lesson that took me a lot of time to unwind, but it is interesting</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t discuss those things because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s either this or this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the greatest strength athletes of all time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider how you optimize the, the feats of strength that you reach</p>
<p>for with things like steroids.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense and I think that was a, from my perspective, I think it was probably</p>
<p>the right decision.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve achieved something incredible that inspires a huge number of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve shown to yourself and to the world, but what the human body can accomplish.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And no matter if I push to a less weight and if I disclosed everything that I did and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, when I wasn&rsquo;t using steroids, in my opinion, if we went through everything,</p>
<p>there would people that would say, you&rsquo;re using performance enhancing, no matter what,</p>
<p>like it is, it&rsquo;s straight up.</p>
<p>So you just need to be okay with it yourself.</p>
<p>And so I had to make the call, I want to see what the true potential is of every, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throw everything out the window that I feel unless I feel it&rsquo;s a risk from a, from a health</p>
<p>standpoint that I&rsquo;m not willing to take on.</p>
<p>And because that&rsquo;s, how do I like, it&rsquo;s just picking and choosing and it&rsquo;s just picking</p>
<p>and choosing.</p>
<p>I here&rsquo;s what I want to know.</p>
<p>This is what I want to be able to try to achieve.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And what you did is incredible.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just awe inspiring.</p>
<p>And what Lance Armstrong did was incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that, and that, and that aged me up.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s funny is the people that bash them are like on the media or politicians or maybe</p>
<p>some actors and guess what?</p>
<p>A ton of them are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hypocrisy at its finest.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>But how many, how many of those figures you&rsquo;re watching in movies that love to talk, you</p>
<p>know, be, you know, be political and do this and the news and all this, I&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re anti aging clinics, like all over California and everywhere else.</p>
<p>Who do you think is, keeps them in business?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the competitive lifter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re using peptides and also, and SARMs and all sorts of like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking to the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I also want to speak to the fact, you know, somebody who&rsquo;s a friend of mine, David Goggins.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know what that is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ultra marathon runner, Navy seal.</p>
<p>He gets.</p>
<p>Pretty incredible person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible human being.</p>
<p>And he gets criticism like, you know, what you&rsquo;re doing is, is bad for the body.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re pushing yourself too far.</p>
<p>I find that the people that criticize are often people that haven&rsquo;t truly pushed themselves</p>
<p>to the limit.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t actually worked hard in their life.</p>
<p>When you work hard, you realize how incredible it is that a human being can dedicate themselves</p>
<p>so fully to an effort the way you did, the way David Goggins does the way, the way the</p>
<p>greatest athletes do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing that should be said beyond just sitting back in awe that humans can achieve</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>That inspires me to do the best, whatever the hell I do, to be the best version of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about like athletic feats, especially like strength that just inspire</p>
<p>us to do the best, to be the best version of ourselves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing you should be saying as opposed to criticizing some little detail</p>
<p>of this and that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just awe inspiring that you push yourself to anybody that is at that level.</p>
<p>And this is funny, like in competitive sports, like you go online and people, it&rsquo;s just bash,</p>
<p>bash, bash, bash, bash, bash, bash.</p>
<p>You go talk to anybody, anybody, anybody that&rsquo;s a high level athlete within that field.</p>
<p>And nobody has a single bad thing to say about each other.</p>
<p>But all this chitter chatter down there, I mean, I know exactly what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So if you, I would say, cause I have love for all those folks, especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>younger, you have a little bit of that desire to criticize others.</p>
<p>I think that should be channeled in improving your own life.</p>
<p>Anytime that you feel that way, that is when you need to turn inward and it&rsquo;s hard to do,</p>
<p>but there is a reason that you have those emotions around someone else and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that you have an opportunity to look at yourself and know why you feel that way.</p>
<p>And that, guess what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the hard thing to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the thing.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s stirring you a little bit because it&rsquo;s so much easier to sit there and, or talk</p>
<p>to your confidant or whatever instead of go, why does that bother me?</p>
<p>Why does what that person doing or what that person&rsquo;s achieving bother me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a difficult question that I often ask others, whether it&rsquo;s better to work hard</p>
<p>or work smart.</p>
<p>I like to ask that question because it helps me get a sense of the human being.</p>
<p>And I think I, let me just say like, I often, I often like people that answer that would</p>
<p>work hard.</p>
<p>Even though the quote unquote right answer is work smart, meaning like finding the optimal</p>
<p>efficient way to achieve a certain goal, I find that people that answer work smart don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually find the optimal efficient way to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>It seems like the people that at least certainly early in life strive to work their ass off,</p>
<p>even that means doing the inefficient, the dumb thing, just to learn the mistake.</p>
<p>The spirit behind the human spirit behind the person that says, or a card is the one</p>
<p>I connect with, but I&rsquo;m torn, especially in the, in the war culture, in the tech sector</p>
<p>where people answer work smart, what would you, what would you say about that tension?</p>
<p>This definitely encompasses like, I&rsquo;m the intellectual and I&rsquo;m the meathead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the work around the clock and go fix the processes and make it so much better type</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s me in a whole, that&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my life story.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Busting your ass to find the easiest way possible to both.</p>
<p>So like I will, I will build a custom hydraulic cart that will lift my plates up to the height</p>
<p>of my, my squat.</p>
<p>So that I can minimize a roll it over next to it and then minimize the effort of it going</p>
<p>on and off to be able to lift the most amount of weight as possible so, so that I can save</p>
<p>the energy from here, from lifting those up and the fatigue of my back being in bad position.</p>
<p>So I can nearly kill myself over here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I, my wife, anybody will say, I&rsquo;m a workaholic.</p>
<p>And the first thing that I would do when it would be doing a company, a company turnaround,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d hire me, come in and I would be taking over.</p>
<p>So for someone that wasn&rsquo;t successful, but it was usually hardly ever for lack of want</p>
<p>or trying.</p>
<p>So a lot of times they knew they were unsuccessful and they were running around working six,</p>
<p>seven days a week, 12 hour days doing so much and it&rsquo;d be like, well, you need to do this.</p>
<p>And they train me on like all the reports and this and all the things and like, good</p>
<p>luck, good luck.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And the first thing I would do is nothing.</p>
<p>I would do nothing because then I would find what actually keeps coming back, the things</p>
<p>that I need to do and how much of it was filling the space.</p>
<p>Because so much of human nature when you&rsquo;re failing is to make yourself feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>accomplishing thing.</p>
<p>This is when things go on your list, on your checklist and you start like rolling up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re running around just getting shit done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Being busy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, but at the same time, like find somewhere in my career, something I&rsquo;ve done where I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t outworked everybody, just so much on distilling things down to what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to make time to sit back and assess and think and be introspective.</p>
<p>You have to make time for this because if not, you&rsquo;re going to waste so much time sitting</p>
<p>there walking sideways when all you got to do is move just one step in front of the other</p>
<p>each day.</p>
<p>Just one.</p>
<p>And I say, because it&rsquo;s going to add up, but you could spend six months knocking shit out,</p>
<p>doing your routine, busting your ass and not take that one step.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to distill stuff down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to really understand like what&rsquo;s important to you in life and where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going.</p>
<p>And, uh, when you&rsquo;re looking at anything in your life, the first thing that you need to</p>
<p>do is figure out, do I need to do it and just quit doing it, just quit doing things in your</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see that a lot of stuff that you think has to be done, doesn&rsquo;t have to be done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised.</p>
<p>And then from there, this is the tech.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then of that, what can I, what can I automate?</p>
<p>What can I not have to do in a repeated fashion?</p>
<p>And then the last one, yeah, wherever possible, if it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m adding tremendous</p>
<p>value to, like my uniqueness, people are like, oh, you must like do the auto work on your</p>
<p>vehicles cause you love working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, fuck that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, I love creating things, but I don&rsquo;t want to do that stuff.</p>
<p>So you could use delegating if you&rsquo;re a manager position, but it&rsquo;s outsourcing, whatever it</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>But there are also so many things this, and this, this ties back to your point, uh, around</p>
<p>just doing it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a point to like experiencing all levels to really understand things.</p>
<p>You need to spend time at the same time doing all those things.</p>
<p>Cause there could be good, huge, massive gaps in there that you&rsquo;re not aware of that are</p>
<p>key for you or key to be having done different or so on.</p>
<p>So um, like in my company days, I was one of the few executives that came in that could</p>
<p>do anything on the floor from code to machine, run away, the mill weld, do all step into</p>
<p>engineering, like, and, and that added tremendous value to me to having had spent time being</p>
<p>a doer and not enough people want to be, you&rsquo;ve got to just go do shit.</p>
<p>You need to spend time in your life chopping wood, you need to have experience trying and</p>
<p>doing all these things that you would never like my skillset is massive because I want</p>
<p>to know, like you need to have those touch points.</p>
<p>My job, my title is chief visionary, but I&rsquo;ve spent time doing everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about just like creating this amazing strategy or vision.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to be there in this person that directs and like, like you can&rsquo;t be effective.</p>
<p>You cannot connect the dots unless you&rsquo;ve been in the moment with everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Low level stuff.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s doing stupid shit that you&rsquo;re not uniquely qualified to do that anybody</p>
<p>could do, but you did it anyway.</p>
<p>Just the training environment.</p>
<p>People hit me up at a, at a, at a school or wherever like, Hey, how do I get into, I want</p>
<p>to grow my, grow my brand online.</p>
<p>I want to do this.</p>
<p>Like, where do I, where do I start?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, go get a job at planet fitness or 24 hour fitness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, but I want to, you know, where, how do I get, you know, recognized and write</p>
<p>articles and be an online coach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you need to go spend a few years one on one training people to learn like the</p>
<p>interaction, how people respond, there&rsquo;s base levels you have to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to go work your way up from the ground.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I truly believe it.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s the hard work piece that I&rsquo;m speaking to that I like it when people</p>
<p>have been humbled by the hardness of life, like how difficult it is to do stuff.</p>
<p>And it does, I went and got my MBA, I went to MIT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to do that stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m above that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And since you&rsquo;ve been humbled by doing those things, I feel like you can truly explore</p>
<p>the optimization that you&rsquo;re talking to, finding the ways where you&rsquo;re uniquely capable to</p>
<p>add value to the world.</p>
<p>And then, and then again, work your ass off to be the best in the world at that thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>But then don&rsquo;t waste your time on shit that&rsquo;s not aligned.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only, so that&rsquo;s, I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of context I put around that, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was like a long answer to a, a long, beautiful answer to an unanswerable</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Do you have advice outside of all this discussion to young people today about career, about</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve done so many things, you&rsquo;ve overcome a lot of things.</p>
<p>Think high school, college student, thinking about what to do in their life.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for those guys and girls?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First is you don&rsquo;t have it figured out, so don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Just jump in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We talked, you know, a lot about understanding your values and aligning all that stuff, but</p>
<p>you got to have a base level of start exploring and learning and just spending the time doing</p>
<p>like pick something, let me elaborate a little bit.</p>
<p>No, you know what?</p>
<p>A lot of people struggle with that aspect now because the choice, there&rsquo;s so much choice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to pick something, but I think it does blow down to you should pick something</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>And then, but within that you can start discovering the things that are there for you.</p>
<p>Like I, I talked about, I made this huge shift, I threw away whole life, but I don&rsquo;t regret</p>
<p>anything about that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I was if I didn&rsquo;t walk through and learn those things.</p>
<p>And in fact, in the course of that, I learned just how much that inspiring people and helping</p>
<p>them realize the potential far beyond what they thought was capable.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>That was leadership 101 in managing people base level, floor level, right?</p>
<p>And I got a lot out that was perfectly aligned with what, and that&rsquo;s what I realized.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter what industry I was in or any of those other things, but I was able,</p>
<p>you can see so many things, there&rsquo;s so many paths that you can go down to help you realize</p>
<p>what those things are.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be able to find a lot of those nuggets and develop those.</p>
<p>Do you think that I could have just gone to school and got out and started a globally</p>
<p>recognized brand within a few years without having been schooled in business while getting</p>
<p>paid for it by others for years?</p>
<p>And in fact, that entire time I knew that that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do, but I didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>out on it.</p>
<p>I mentored some of my friends along the same path to go, no, they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go do this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, now you need to go get a job.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, engineering management, design, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Go get a job as a manager now.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that&rsquo;s a step down.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, go try it.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, oh my God, that was such a good move.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re an executive for freaking a fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>And the same thing, like I sat there knowing that I was getting a free education.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stress yourself out as my, that&rsquo;s my advice.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stress yourself out that you&rsquo;ve got to have this perfect thing because this process</p>
<p>of understanding your values and the introspect, that takes time.</p>
<p>You can get a job where you&rsquo;re getting paid to learn.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good deal before you launch on your own.</p>
<p>You mentioned going back to darkness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, so I like going back to darkness.</p>
<p>You suffer from depression.</p>
<p>You consider suicide.</p>
<p>Do you ponder your own death these days?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I definitely think about mortality.</p>
<p>And am I afraid of my own death?</p>
<p>It depends on the moment.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m in the middle of a project, I definitely want to finish that project, man.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t fear it so much.</p>
<p>I fear leaving my kids or my wife and not being able to be there for them.</p>
<p>That bothers me.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I know that I put everything into the life that I&rsquo;ve lived.</p>
<p>Like you said, there&rsquo;s always more, but I&rsquo;ve lived hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved hard.</p>
<p>Every moment in my life, I&rsquo;ve made connections and impacted people around me for the better.</p>
<p>And this tracks back, which is crazy when we were doing the documentary and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interviewing people through my whole life and the consistency of the themes of anyone,</p>
<p>like anything for Duffin, like just sure, I&rsquo;ll fly in from Boston.</p>
<p>These people, it was crazy.</p>
<p>Everybody had a story about me giving, just over and over.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way you were.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been all in.</p>
<p>I have a lot more I want to do, but I don&rsquo;t have things that regret have not done in like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fear it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the, I don&rsquo;t know if you know the Bukowski poem, go all the way, otherwise don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even try.</p>
<p>It seems like you embody that poem and you&rsquo;ve accomplished some incredible things and serve</p>
<p>as an inspiration to a huge number of people.</p>
<p>Chris, you&rsquo;re an amazing human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored that you would spend your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking with me today.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to check out all the cool stuff you&rsquo;ve engineered with Kabuki Strength.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m obviously, I love the, I love strength.</p>
<p>I love strength training.</p>
<p>I love the idea of strength.</p>
<p>I love the equipment and the engineering approach that you take to strength.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human, both on the things you&rsquo;ve accomplished in terms of your own strength</p>
<p>feats and the kind of science and engineering you bring to the field that many others could</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>That was quite the final thing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Duffin and thank you to Headspace,</p>
<p>Magic Spoon, Sun Basket and Ladder.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Strength does not come from winning.</p>
<p>Your struggles develop your strengths.</p>
<p>When you go through hardship and decide not to surrender, that is strength.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
