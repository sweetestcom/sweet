    <p>Hi friends, I&rsquo;m back</p>
<p>Pastor Leo had to take a little trip. I took two trips. Actually. I went to Texas to go see my family</p>
<p>And then I went to TNC. I took my sale to fucking hick ass</p>
<p>Tennessee y&rsquo;all and it was shit. Okay, Nashville. Don&rsquo;t go Nashville is not fun</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fucking vibe but Texas bitch College Station. I want to go see my family. It&rsquo;s always a blast. It&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>So much fine</p>
<p>I had the best time but American Airlines dicked me the fuck around and that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t put out a podcast episode</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>They kept canceling and changing my flights</p>
<p>So the day I was supposed to come home and record a podcast and then edit it and upload it to schedule it</p>
<p>American Airlines canceled my fucking flight. So I lost that whole day at home</p>
<p>Between my next trip like I literally got home and went to the next trip</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to fucking play with my dick</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to fiddle my ditto. I didn&rsquo;t have time to fucking breathe barely</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m sorry. I had no podcast episode</p>
<p>American Airlines can suck a fat one because they hurt my feelings one too many fucking times when my flight changes like y&rsquo;all piss me</p>
<p>the fuck off and I tried to call and like bitch at them and</p>
<p>They hung up on me</p>
<p>So they just gave me the finger right the fuck back. So I&rsquo;m done flying with American American. Fuck you</p>
<p>I will never fly with you again. So whatever my Texas trip was a blast</p>
<p>But the flights were fucked and then we went to Nashville, bro. We went for two concerts me and my friends</p>
<p>We went for LS dream and hippie sabotage and bitch. Those two concerts were so good. I</p>
<p>Was expecting it to be like mediocre to be like not that fun</p>
<p>I was more just going to be with my friends and hang out with them</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really going for the concerts because I don&rsquo;t know much of LS dreams music</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much of hippie sabotage is new music</p>
<p>I know some of the old shit, but I did not think it was gonna be fine. It was fine. It was very much fun</p>
<p>Like the concerts were so much better than I could have imagined</p>
<p>10 out of 10</p>
<p>But then going out in Nashville like we like went so we could stay the weekend and then go out because everybody hypes up</p>
<p>Nashville&rsquo;s like a party town. So I&rsquo;m like, yeah, let&rsquo;s go the fuck out. Let&rsquo;s go Jersey Shore this ho</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the vibe of Nashville. Nashville is not the vibe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking ghetto my friend&rsquo;s car got broken into at our Airbnb. We stayed at a nice Airbnb, but</p>
<p>Nashville is just fucking ghetto is shit. Like I don&rsquo;t know why people hype it up. I didn&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too honky-tonk at the bars. Like let me set the scene for you</p>
<p>So when you go to the bars on</p>
<p>Broadway every every bar is like five floors and there&rsquo;s a thousand fucking flights of stairs and I wish I was being dramatic</p>
<p>Girl, you will be huffing and puffing like you&rsquo;re on the fucking Stairmaster when you try to go to the bar</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun. You&rsquo;re gonna sober up in the stairwell. You&rsquo;re not even gonna be fucked up anymore</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna breathe out your alcohol. You&rsquo;re gonna go in debt trying to get drunk again like, uh, anyway</p>
<p>The first couple floors of all the bars is like honky-tonk yeehaw shit, which is expected</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Nashville, but no one is having fun. They&rsquo;re just standing around with a beer in their hand fucking just being hicks</p>
<p>Like they just stand around so I&rsquo;m like no we go to the top floor because most of the bars have a rooftop and bitch</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like EDM house music and me and my friend group when we got up there</p>
<p>We were like finally we can fucking live a little we get to fucking dancing. My friend gets on the table</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a fucking blast and then I realized</p>
<p>We the only ones dancing</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a ton of people on the rooftop bar</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the type people that are just there to look hot like they just want to look cute. They&rsquo;re not dancing</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not having fun</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just standing there with their fucking drink like a dick just like bopping their heads in the music and like we&rsquo;re fucking throwing down</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like sweating. We&rsquo;re having a fucking blast like when you see the cast of Jersey Shore go out on the TV show</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we behave when we go out. I like to get ugly. That&rsquo;s how I was raised</p>
<p>I was raised watching that show. So that is my expectation for going to the club</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a good fucking time every time and that is very much not the vibe of</p>
<p>Nashville like everybody on the rooftop. The music is really good. But the people are not fine</p>
<p>So they just be watching you they just watch you dance like a fool and I don&rsquo;t like that and it wasn&rsquo;t just like we</p>
<p>Tried one bar. We tried multiple but she&rsquo;s just not the vibe. She not fine. I don&rsquo;t like Nashville</p>
<p>I met a couple of my followers from tik-tok and I asked them because they were locals</p>
<p>I asked them where like the good bars and they told us a few that weren&rsquo;t on</p>
<p>Broadway because we did not like Broadway the little strip of bars. It&rsquo;s shit</p>
<p>No to touristy not the vibe honky-tonk not for me and like people passed out on the side of the fucking road because they&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>drunk like please</p>
<p>So we go to the local bars</p>
<p>We try the other ones that my followers told me about and they were a little more fun</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna be honest</p>
<p>They were a little more fun, but they still were just like not doing it for me</p>
<p>I dig it on the stripper pole and climb up to the top and then slide down like them strippers do but it just wasn&rsquo;t fine</p>
<p>Like the vibe was just not there. I</p>
<p>Did have fun the second night we went out, but I</p>
<p>Would just pass on Nashville if anyone tries to get you to go, babe</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go for the nightlife. Don&rsquo;t go thinking it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>Go for the nature and shit go play with a cow go fucking hike</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t go to go out because it&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>If you like me, that means you party like me. You&rsquo;re not gonna like it. Hey, we want them the same</p>
<p>Let me save you some money. Don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>The only thing that saved my trip was I liked the people I was with so if you do go</p>
<p>Take people you like because I had fun with my friends. I enjoyed being around my little group and</p>
<p>That was there because everything else was fucking moot</p>
<p>Okay, so my trips were fun and cutesy but I need to tell you my realization I had and the realization like hasn&rsquo;t stopped</p>
<p>Happening since it started in Texas and I&rsquo;m gonna make sense of it</p>
<p>Just holds on but anyone that listens to this podcast bro</p>
<p>Like this is what you need to pay attention to and this is something that&rsquo;s gonna help every single person</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made me cry too many times. I&rsquo;m sick of it. Y&rsquo;all I don&rsquo;t cry a lot</p>
<p>I joke about crying a lot, but this one has like made me cry a couple a few times. Maybe</p>
<p>possibly</p>
<p>so my first realization a</p>
<p>Way that I&rsquo;ve started to see things about me that are lovable and why people would love them</p>
<p>Basically that I&rsquo;m worth being loved and I&rsquo;m gonna give you a few examples of this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to go really around the bush, but I&rsquo;m gonna bring it back</p>
<p>So when I was in Texas, my cousin Anissa is dating this boy like Kiki, I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re a thing or they&rsquo;re dating or not dating, but they boot up</p>
<p>Okay, she&rsquo;s like boot up with this boy named Christian and it was my first time meeting Christian and we had a blast together</p>
<p>like we</p>
<p>Got along so fucking well, I&rsquo;ve never really like</p>
<p>Gotten along with someone instantly like a guy I don&rsquo;t get along with guys usually but like me and him instantly just clicked</p>
<p>We was like friends as fuck</p>
<p>Like we was very much bros</p>
<p>Like I felt like he was like a brother to me because of how he treated me. So when we would go to the bar</p>
<p>he was so conscious of</p>
<p>Me like the way that I am to other people</p>
<p>He would wait for me like if I was in the bathroom</p>
<p>He would wait for me before he went back to everybody else if I was going somewhere. He would check on me</p>
<p>He would like be checking on me just to make sure I&rsquo;m doing. Okay, he would never leave me alone</p>
<p>he would never like wander off like he would always just make sure I was considered and with everyone and</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>Had that before like people do that to me</p>
<p>Occasionally, but I&rsquo;m always the one that&rsquo;s like looking out for everybody else</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always like the protector of the guard or the fucking you know, but for him to do it to me, bro</p>
<p>like it was so fucking just like eye-opening and we got into a couple of like</p>
<p>Tiffy&rsquo;s not really Tiffy&rsquo;s but like anytime that there was a potential problem going on. He was right there like had my fucking back. I</p>
<p>Felt protected like that&rsquo;s weird for me because I&rsquo;m the one that protects everybody</p>
<p>Usually like I&rsquo;m always the protector</p>
<p>But he just had my fucking back and like he was he cared about me. He like worried about me</p>
<p>He wanted to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t left alone</p>
<p>Like when we would go walking in somewhere</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I usually hold the door for everybody and they walk in but he would hold the door and make sure I got in</p>
<p>Like there was just so many little things he would do that made me feel so</p>
<p>cared about and like considered and I felt important and it felt so fucking nice and</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t like experienced that</p>
<p>Before to that extent like there&rsquo;s people in my life that do these things for me</p>
<p>But like my first time meeting someone and he was just he was everything that I do to other people and it shocked the shit</p>
<p>out of me because I realized</p>
<p>The way that Christian made me feel is the way that I make other people feel and I started bawling my fucking</p>
<p>Eyes out when I realized this because I was like, bro</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I met a little version of myself and it&rsquo;s like I got to see myself and</p>
<p>experience myself for the first time and</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t explain to you how good it felt to like</p>
<p>See myself. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain this y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna have to like go off the fucking seat of my pants, but I got to feel how I make other people feel and</p>
<p>It was so nice and it just made me so happy</p>
<p>Because if I make people feel the way that he made me feel</p>
<p>Like I see that I&rsquo;m so much more important than I thought I&rsquo;m so much more valuable than I thought I&rsquo;m so much more like</p>
<p>Lovable</p>
<p>than I thought but I saw myself for the first time it was just through him and</p>
<p>That was the realization. I can finally see the things about me that are lovable and I could see why someone</p>
<p>Would love me and it&rsquo;s because the way that I make them feel like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Totally worth loving because like Christian the way that I feel toward him</p>
<p>To imagine someone feeling that way towards me and like seeing the reason that they could feel that way towards me</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying it</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t keep telling myself that I&rsquo;m unlovable and I&rsquo;m fucked up and I&rsquo;m all this and that and like why would someone love</p>
<p>me when I can feel it so</p>
<p>Paying attention to this is like completely changing everything for me and it&rsquo;s changing the way that I see myself and the way I feel</p>
<p>About myself because now I feel valuable now</p>
<p>I see how people are attached to me now</p>
<p>I can see the value that I contribute to people out of just being who I am and the way that I make others</p>
<p>Feel around me if this is like some next-level fucking shit</p>
<p>Like I said the realization kept going that was in Texas and then in</p>
<p>Nashville I was with my friend cat like she was one of the people that was with the group of mine and</p>
<p>when our other friends car got broken into it was like 3 in the morning and</p>
<p>We go busting down the fucking stairs like running outside</p>
<p>I go grab a knife and I&rsquo;m ready to gut this motherfucker</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m running out the front door and cat was right there next to me</p>
<p>Like she came running right out the fucking door with me. Like I was in my underwear. Yo, it&rsquo;s like 3 30 in the morning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s freezing fucking cold in Nashville teeny-tee and I come running the fuck out the house and cat is right next to me and</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t describe to you</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>good it felt to have someone like</p>
<p>Be by my side like that</p>
<p>Like I just met cat a few months ago and like this bitch was ready to fucking go with me at any</p>
<p>Second like bitch had my back like we were both kind of like what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>Like she was scared and I was a little like panicked but I&rsquo;m used to that</p>
<p>I am able to handle shit like this. Like that&rsquo;s kind of like my forte</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when something goes down Leo handles it, but I still get scared too</p>
<p>And I know she was scared</p>
<p>But to have her like run out next to me and like be by my side during that</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain to you how good that fucking felt</p>
<p>Like her being there for me and was like right we didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck we were running into</p>
<p>But like she was there with me to go through it and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different when it&rsquo;s a friend because I have my family like my family is the same as me</p>
<p>We will all run the fuck out in the middle of anything with each other</p>
<p>We got each other&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>but like in that moment like cat had my fucking back like my family does and I have my friend Genevieve and summer and the</p>
<p>Other same way like those two bitches are fucking crazy and my family in Houston</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s an established like we all just know that like we all just got each other like that</p>
<p>But yo like cat surprised the fuck out of me</p>
<p>The way that cat made me feel like she had my back is how I make everybody else feel</p>
<p>Like cat felt the same way about me in that moment</p>
<p>Like she was scared and I was there for her just like I was kind of scared and she was there for me</p>
<p>I saw myself again of how I&rsquo;m protective and I make people feel safe</p>
<p>And I make people feel like I have their back and how that is a feeling that you can give someone that can never be</p>
<p>Repaid like people would pay money for that shit, but you can&rsquo;t like that&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>Like you just have it or you don&rsquo;t like people just have your back or they don&rsquo;t they can&rsquo;t give you that sense of safety</p>
<p>and security</p>
<p>So like I saw myself again</p>
<p>Through cat like the way that she had my fucking back and it like bonded me to her so much more than she even knows</p>
<p>And when she listens to this like oh my god, hey, bitch</p>
<p>Like I love you so much. I</p>
<p>Have a couple more examples</p>
<p>But when you go out in your life</p>
<p>I want y&rsquo;all to start fucking looking for</p>
<p>The way that other people make you feel that you like and then be like is that something I do because I have that you</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t I mean like look for yourself in others and experience the way that you make other people feel because once you feel</p>
<p>yourself</p>
<p>Yo, there&rsquo;s no better feeling. I can&rsquo;t describe it to you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna have to do it and like once you have this realization</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never gonna stop and you are gonna develop a new like appreciation for yourself</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell it&rsquo;s better than fucking jerking off. It is better than fucking drugs and trust me. I know</p>
<p>So another example from Nashville is my other friend Kate so first was cat now we got Kate</p>
<p>When we were at the concerts</p>
<p>Kate would randomly</p>
<p>Turn around and hold my hand or like reach out to me and</p>
<p>Just hold my hand for a second and like would look at me and I can&rsquo;t explain to you how</p>
<p>fucking important</p>
<p>That is and how much I love that like it makes my fucking broken little heart</p>
<p>So happy because it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s checking on me and thinking of me</p>
<p>Like she randomly would just like check on me throughout the concert</p>
<p>Like and just make sure I&rsquo;m okay</p>
<p>she would think of me and like her reaching out her hand was like showing that she&rsquo;s thinking of me like hi and</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t speak. We didn&rsquo;t say nothing</p>
<p>She would just like hold my hand for a second and we would just like beat bop and have a good time</p>
<p>Like it was a positive thing. It wasn&rsquo;t like I was sad and she was holding my hand</p>
<p>It was like we&rsquo;re both having fun. She just grabs my hand and we like vibe for a second together. I</p>
<p>experienced myself in that too because the way that I think of other people and</p>
<p>The way that I like check on others and I try to make sure everybody&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>she did that to me and I felt myself again like how good it feels to be checked on I</p>
<p>Do that to others and I make others feel the exact same way like bro</p>
<p>There it&rsquo;s the little things I swear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the big things where it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re running out with me ready to fucking fight everybody or</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like holding my hand and like letting me know you think of me like there&rsquo;s so many little things</p>
<p>That I do that are so much more important that I don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>And these are the things about me that make me lovable and make me worth being loved</p>
<p>Like how could you not love someone that has these traits?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even like I have to earn people&rsquo;s love and like I&rsquo;m forcing these traits</p>
<p>Like these are just traits that I have like I&rsquo;m just a naturally</p>
<p>Considerate person like I just think of others</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of the way other people are feeling like I just consider them. That&rsquo;s just a part of me. It&rsquo;s part of my character</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s who I am</p>
<p>the way that I&rsquo;m loyal the way that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Protective the way that I think of everybody the way that I can read a fucking room and I have situational awareness the way that</p>
<p>I care for people</p>
<p>just the way that I have a</p>
<p>Genuine interest and what people are saying and that I want to make sure they feel special and feel like they&rsquo;re heard I try</p>
<p>To understand people before I judge them</p>
<p>You know, like just these little traits about me that I&rsquo;ve overlooked for so long. That&rsquo;s all the lovable shit</p>
<p>So all the things about you that you&rsquo;re overlooking is all the reasons that you&rsquo;re lovable. So if you don&rsquo;t feel lovable</p>
<p>Stop overlooking shit. You&rsquo;re overlooking all of the reasons why people will love you and why people do love you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only one that doesn&rsquo;t see it and I&rsquo;m talking to myself when I say this, too</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only one that thinks you&rsquo;re unlovable</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t fathom why someone would love you and that&rsquo;s why you feel the way that you do sometimes</p>
<p>But as soon as you start to see it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start feeling worthy of love and you&rsquo;re gonna have to start treating yourself a lot better because how can someone that&rsquo;s worthy?</p>
<p>Of love be treated so bad by their self</p>
<p>This is like some life-changing shit, and I know I&rsquo;m just like throwing it out there. But here it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different to logically</p>
<p>Like understand, okay, I do this this and that and this is why I should be valuable to other people</p>
<p>It is so much different when you feel it like logic and reason is one thing</p>
<p>But when you feel something it&rsquo;s totally fucking different</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m dead ass like start looking for the shit that you do for other people and then feel it like when they do it</p>
<p>Back or someone does it to you sit in it for a second sit in it and enjoy that feeling and then remind yourself</p>
<p>This is how I make other people feel</p>
<p>Another example of something like this is my sister and my mom</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like my voice of reason when I&rsquo;m freaking the fuck out</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in a high</p>
<p>Emotional like disarray and I&rsquo;m like freaking the fuck out or I&rsquo;m like panicking or I&rsquo;m upset</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call either of them and they&rsquo;re always like my voice of reason like they&rsquo;re my logic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the situation depends of like who I&rsquo;m gonna call it&rsquo;s just random</p>
<p>But I know that when I&rsquo;m really upset or I&rsquo;m really fucking mad or I&rsquo;m scared and I don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>I can call them and I can trust their judgment like they&rsquo;re they have my best interest at heart</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna tell me something bad and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be able to think logically when I can&rsquo;t and they&rsquo;re gonna remind me of things and</p>
<p>Guide me in the right direction. And when you are in a super emotional place</p>
<p>That person that you can call is so much more important than you realize so I realized with my mom and my sister</p>
<p>Like the way that I can call them is the way that they call me because when they&rsquo;re upset about something</p>
<p>They call me and I&rsquo;m their voice of reason so I saw myself again like and I felt myself for the first time</p>
<p>Through them of how I make them feel and how I&rsquo;m like that safety net for them where when you&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>you have somewhere to go because there&rsquo;s been a lot of times where I&rsquo;ve been really really upset or really really scared and had</p>
<p>Nowhere to go and no one to turn to but myself and I can&rsquo;t explain to you</p>
<p>how good it feels to actually have someone there to kind of like comfort you when you&rsquo;re upset or</p>
<p>Be your voice of reason or just someone to be there to fucking give you a new opinion or a new perspective or like hey</p>
<p>Help me see the situation different cuz I&rsquo;m fucking pissed, you know</p>
<p>But I am that like just like they&rsquo;re that for me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not for them and you listening to this podcast you you you&rsquo;re that for somebody else. I</p>
<p>Kind of want to make this podcast episode really fucking long because I have two more realizations that I can go into</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if I should save one for</p>
<p>Another episode and make it its own episode or not</p>
<p>No, fuck it. We&rsquo;re just gonna throw it in this one cuz I owe y&rsquo;all from last week</p>
<p>Like we just need a long podcast. So I had a realization about traveling and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>Getting new ideas and getting into new frequencies</p>
<p>So where you live now and where you spend your daily life or like most of your life, it&rsquo;s the same vibrations</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same shit. And if you notice you&rsquo;re like thinking</p>
<p>The same way in the same thoughts and you&rsquo;re seeing the same perspectives</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to trigger you to see anything new. So like when you travel</p>
<p>Different locations hold different frequencies and</p>
<p>Different frequencies are gonna give you different thoughts and different ideas</p>
<p>so if you want to think in a new way or you want to have a new idea get the fuck out of where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at and I&rsquo;m not talking like</p>
<p>travel</p>
<p>Hours and hours away or spend thousands of dollars to go travel somewhere like just drive an hour away from where you live</p>
<p>Go see something different go feel something different go get in different frequencies get in different vibrations get in different shit</p>
<p>Because it will automatically start shifting your thoughts. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything</p>
<p>It will just start changing by itself because you&rsquo;re gonna be a match to different</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re in a new fucking frequency</p>
<p>I know this is kind of spiritual and it&rsquo;s a little bit out there</p>
<p>But I promise like it&rsquo;s the fucking truth like your brain is just gonna automatically</p>
<p>Start working differently if you&rsquo;re in a different location</p>
<p>It makes so much sense because in science class you learned everything fucking vibrates solid liquids and gases</p>
<p>You know the little particles and it would like show that it moves like in a solid it moves a little bit slower</p>
<p>But in a gas the like particles or the atoms</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck it was like move really really fast in the gas</p>
<p>everything vibrates</p>
<p>Everything and so do thoughts and emotions like they are all energy too. They all vibrate</p>
<p>So by switching the frequency or the vibration that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s gonna switch all of the vibrations in your body are gonna be matches to different things</p>
<p>so your thought process is automatically gonna be one of those and</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s about traveling because every time I travel I have some like life-changing fucking revelation or</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get a new idea for something or I&rsquo;ll see a new perspective on something. I wasn&rsquo;t seeing before and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m out of what I know it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m out of the perspectives</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to I&rsquo;m out of the way. I&rsquo;ve usually been thinking like it&rsquo;s not a coincidence. It&rsquo;s not an accident</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking real. But anytime I have a problem like I&rsquo;ve always just been drawn to</p>
<p>Driving somewhere or going somewhere even if I just go to the beach</p>
<p>Which is like 25 minutes away from me or I go downtown and I go walk around</p>
<p>I do like just random-ass shit</p>
<p>Like every time I have a problem or I have like something I&rsquo;m thinking about or I need like insight on something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to a new location</p>
<p>So I can be a match to new ideas because you&rsquo;re not gonna think of anything new sitting in the same shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. That sounds kind of like wacky, but it&rsquo;d be it&rsquo;d be the truth bitch. I swear to God. It&rsquo;d be the truth Ruth</p>
<p>Okay, so moving on to the next realization, this is something I realized yesterday after getting into like kind of like a pit of</p>
<p>Sadness. Um, I don&rsquo;t know if it was come-down feels or it was just a mix</p>
<p>But I was pushed to a new realization bitch, and I&rsquo;m annoyed by it</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically that nothing is as easy as you think it is</p>
<p>So on social media like the vibe now is to look like you&rsquo;re not trying it&rsquo;s to look effortless</p>
<p>Motherfuckers are trying so much more than you realize people are putting so much more effort into</p>
<p>Everything they do then you realize they&rsquo;re just not telling you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cool in our generation for some reason to care or to try or to put effort into something</p>
<p>everybody kind of just hides that and</p>
<p>For someone like me. I&rsquo;m watching everyone have all it just seems like all this great shit</p>
<p>Is happening to so many people it&rsquo;s not just happening to them. They&rsquo;re working for it</p>
<p>They are fucking putting so much more effort into things</p>
<p>then I even realized then I even know because I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish similar things and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard fucking time</p>
<p>I ran up against this realization because I started to have like a fucking meltdown about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why the fuck does shit not just happen for me like it does for everybody else</p>
<p>The shit not just happened for me like it does for everybody else and then I realized bro, it&rsquo;s not just happening to them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>So much harder than you realize they&rsquo;re just not showing that they&rsquo;re trying like that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to make it look effortless</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hiding that part and they might not even be hiding that part because they want to paint the illusion that it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>They might just be hiding the part where they put in a lot of effort because who wants to see that, you know?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not the pretty part of social media. That&rsquo;s not like what people want to fucking click on and see they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>See you</p>
<p>Doing all the boring work. They just want to see the success. They just want to see like the benefit of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna be really honest with you guys about what I&rsquo;m trying to do right now and</p>
<p>Get mad if you want</p>
<p>but I have to share this because it goes with the realization and it&rsquo;s like what pushed me to it and I&rsquo;m gonna be fucking</p>
<p>Open and honest because nobody else is so I have two tik-tok accounts and they both just hit over</p>
<p>130,000 followers. I have not had a single brand reach out to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one and then they told me they were gonna send me something and</p>
<p>They never did but I have not had any actual like brand deal opportunities</p>
<p>I have not had a single brand reach out to me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>Like I thought brands just reached out to you once you like had some followers and once you had really high engagement</p>
<p>I thought they just reached out to you. They just found you know, maybe some people but not me apparently</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, what the fuck like I want to start making money off of</p>
<p>Tick-tock and my podcast like this shit like this is an example</p>
<p>It takes so much more energy from me to do these things than it seems like my podcast takes me</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>To do because I have to record it and then I have to edit it which takes me a few hours</p>
<p>Then I have to listen to it and then I have to schedule it and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot more work than you think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just fucking come in here and record something and then throw it up</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy as it seems like let me just assure you of that and then tick tocks</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re a lot easier. There&rsquo;s so much fucking easier, but I want to start making money from this shit</p>
<p>I want to figure out how to monetize this because I feel like it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t like I am NOT just like some fucking rich kid who just gets to live off a trust fund</p>
<p>I wish bitch I would fucking suck God&rsquo;s dick if he would make me Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s kid like oh my god</p>
<p>Anyway, I have made like pennies on fucking tick-tock. But with tick-tock the way that they pay you is like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking stupid like you can&rsquo;t touch the money that you make until 30 days after you make it</p>
<p>Okay, so like money doesn&rsquo;t post to your account to be withdrawn for 30 days</p>
<p>And then you have to wait 30 days after that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a 60-day waiting period and I just had a video go viral on my life coach tick-tock and it got like</p>
<p>2.7 million views in a week and all I made was like $83. So</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of fucking views</p>
<p>For only 83 measly fucking bucks</p>
<p>you know like people that are making a living off of social media are not doing it just from like tick-tock money and little tick-tock</p>
<p>Coins because it&rsquo;s not shit</p>
<p>Like what people are doing is like brand deals affiliate links shit like that like sponsored post sponsored ads</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the money is and that&rsquo;s where you can make a lot of fucking money. So my ass is like, okay</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it because my app is not</p>
<p>Making me a lot of money like I put</p>
<p>$25,000 into it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making shit. Like I&rsquo;m making less than</p>
<p>$500 a month</p>
<p>From that like I&rsquo;m already $25,000 in the fucking bucket with this goddamn app</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to make it as cheap as possible because I made it as a resource like I was making it like</p>
<p>Genuine to try to help people but it&rsquo;s like at the same time</p>
<p>I have to watch out for myself financially because I just threw 25 grand into something. That&rsquo;s not having any return</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, let me go try and find some like brand deals or find out like what the fuck people are doing and</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve been researching it like a lot of people have a manager like a social media manager who links them up with brands</p>
<p>that pay them to do shit and they get like PR and all this shit and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people that have</p>
<p>50,000 followers getting a shit ton of PR and I&rsquo;m like how bro like I have</p>
<p>130,000 followers on both accounts and I haven&rsquo;t gotten anything</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because brands are not just reaching out to them and sending them shit and ask in offering to pay them money</p>
<p>Like some of them might but it&rsquo;s not as common as you think</p>
<p>these people have managers and their managers are hooking them up and reaching out to these brands and</p>
<p>Connecting them so that they can get these opportunities</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just falling in their lap and I was under the illusion of like, oh</p>
<p>Once you just get a certain amount of followers</p>
<p>Shit&rsquo;s just gonna start coming to you. Like people are just gonna start wanting to pay you. No, bitch</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it has been for me. If it is like that for other people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s not like that for me. But from my experience</p>
<p>This is some bullshit. Okay, cuz the way I thought it was supposed to go versus how it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking a lot more effort</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m trying to like look for a social media manager so I can get like</p>
<p>Advertisements for my podcast for my tick-tock so I can make some money off this shit, bitch</p>
<p>Like why not? It&rsquo;s a literal missed opportunity</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t ever got to worry about me selling out like I will never come on here talking about no stupid shit</p>
<p>And I will never rep a product that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Believe in or like anything anything</p>
<p>You will never be able to pay me a certain amount to lie to you fucking guys because I&rsquo;m very honest</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open and</p>
<p>All I want is to find someone online that I know I can trust and I am that I have a level of trust</p>
<p>Built with you guys and I will never fucking break that because I&rsquo;m very big on trust. I&rsquo;m very big on like</p>
<p>Reliability and being able to count on someone</p>
<p>So if the fact that you guys trust me and rely on me, that is my number one priority</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never sell the fuck out like I&rsquo;d rather make zero dollars and keep doing this shit</p>
<p>Then lose the relationship that I have with you guys of like the trust, you know</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m doing it right now. Like I make fucking jack shit from this</p>
<p>I have not made a dollar from this podcast. I have made like a</p>
<p>Hundred and something dollars off tick-tock off both my accounts combined because I&rsquo;m banned on not Leo for legal reasons</p>
<p>I got banned from the Creator Fund for seven months, and I&rsquo;m still not off fucking probation</p>
<p>So that account I make no money from absolutely zero my life coach one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made like a hundred and something dollars, but all that&rsquo;s available to withdraw right now is like 40 bucks</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t withdraw the rest of it for another goddamn two months. Anyway</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find out how to get a social media manager and I&rsquo;ve started looking into it and it&rsquo;s a lot of fucking scams</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of bullshit</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t understand how so many people have managers and so many people are making this shit work when</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t like trust anything you that there is online like you have to have connections and I don&rsquo;t have any so if anyone</p>
<p>Listening to this knows a social media manager or knows</p>
<p>Anything about what I can do to start monetizing my shit. Will you please let me know because I&rsquo;m struggling</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what if I&rsquo;m going out and I don&rsquo;t trust anything. I don&rsquo;t trust anyone</p>
<p>So my skepticism and my paranoia is shooting me in the fucking ass right now</p>
<p>I would say sure to me in the foot, but it&rsquo;s really shooting me in the fucking ass</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my realization like this shit is not as easy as</p>
<p>people make it seem or that you would assume because</p>
<p>Them just not talking about it makes us assume a certain thing. So</p>
<p>Girl, it&rsquo;s a lot harder than you fucking think like just having followers does not</p>
<p>Mean you&rsquo;re gonna instantly make money because I&rsquo;m not making shit like it&rsquo;s fucking pathetic</p>
<p>I see people with so many less followers than me that are making so much fucking money and I&rsquo;m like so confused</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like what like I&rsquo;m not like acting like an entitled fucking prick. Like I have more I deserve more. It&rsquo;s like no my</p>
<p>Presence online is not brand friendly and I get that because I&rsquo;m gonna be honest</p>
<p>No matter what and brands want to be able to pay people that will fucking lie and hype their shit up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the guy for that</p>
<p>But if you have a good product, I&rsquo;m the guy to come to because everyone trusts me, you know</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not gonna ever get on here and run my mouth about some stupid shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe and I&rsquo;m not gonna hype up a product</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking like like in the kombucha video that I made on tik-tok that went viral</p>
<p>I said it tastes like fucking shit</p>
<p>It tastes like vinegar</p>
<p>But you got to do what you got to do and drink it cuz it&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>Like everybody was like, oh my god, they were pissing their self and they were like laughing at me</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh my god, you&rsquo;re never gonna get sponsored by kombucha and I was like no shit</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t care make something better and then sponsor me, you know</p>
<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m just trying to take my social media to a like profitable</p>
<p>Standpoint and I I&rsquo;m not figuring out the best way to do that</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m trying but like I said</p>
<p>If y&rsquo;all know anybody like DM me on Instagram and let&rsquo;s talk because I need a little bit of help with this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like disappointed because I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;ve been thinking this whole time something has gone wrong</p>
<p>Because shit&rsquo;s not working for me and opportunities are not just falling in my lap like they are for everybody else</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the reality of it. Shit&rsquo;s not just falling into people&rsquo;s lap. They&rsquo;re having to go out and get it</p>
<p>So now that I&rsquo;m facing the new reality of like hey, it&rsquo;s not as easy as you think now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to like face it and go after it and like figure it out. That&rsquo;s no problem with me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna use my platform and ask for help if I can</p>
<p>Cuz I really don&rsquo;t have connections like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all would probably assume that like</p>
<p>So much more about my social media than is real like I don&rsquo;t make fucking money. I don&rsquo;t have connections</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really talk to people. I like I don&rsquo;t collab with anybody. I don&rsquo;t fucking like nothing like I just</p>
<p>Do it I guess</p>
<p>But that was just my example, but this whole realization is about everything</p>
<p>Like everything is a lot harder than you&rsquo;d expect and nothing has gone wrong</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re busting your ass for something and you&rsquo;re like goddamn like why does this seem so hard it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s meant to</p>
<p>Everyone struggles and no one posts it. No one shares that part. They just show the fruits of their labor</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t show the fucking labor</p>
<p>People are not showing how they had to hunt for a social media manager and how they got fucking scammed</p>
<p>Four times before they found a good one. Like no one&rsquo;s posting that we&rsquo;re just posting that they got PR</p>
<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even know that they have a manager, but they do</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t compare your experience of like what you&rsquo;re trying to do against everyone else&rsquo;s because everybody</p>
<p>Puts in a lot more work into things than you think like these effortless posts on Instagram</p>
<p>Like Emma Chamberlain is the queen of that shit</p>
<p>Like I love that fucking bitch and all her pictures on Instagram looks so like effortless and like she just isn&rsquo;t trying</p>
<p>But let me tell you I know that bitch is trying</p>
<p>I know</p>
<p>Like the effortless look is never effortless like if you just take your phone out and take a random fucking picture of something</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it doesn&rsquo;t look good. Like if you want a picture to look good, but be effortless you have to put effort into it</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just randomly put your phone out and get a great picture</p>
<p>And if you do it&rsquo;s once in a blue fucking moon</p>
<p>Not where you can post three times a week with multiple slideshows of fucking pictures of like air quote</p>
<p>Effortless pictures like these bitches be trying</p>
<p>There be trifling and they be trying like they&rsquo;re trying a lot more than you think to look effortless</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing with social media is everybody makes everything seem so easy and it&rsquo;s not I promise you and it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>Just social media. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>everything in life is not as easy as you&rsquo;d fucking think like everything takes more effort and more energy from you and</p>
<p>Has a lot more obstacles than people are gonna warn you about or tell you and I&rsquo;m gonna reveal a lot of that when I</p>
<p>Make the episode eventually about how I started my app. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all the fucking</p>
<p>Obstacles that were in my goddamn way all the things I had a mental fucking breakdowns about all the emotions</p>
<p>I was feeling what I was thinking what I was doing how I&rsquo;ve gotten it to where it is</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna reveal it all to you and you&rsquo;re gonna be like you</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t fucking realize starting an app was that hard. I didn&rsquo;t realize starting a business was that hard. Yeah, bitch</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real fucking difficult and it&rsquo;s a lot harder than people make it seem</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna run right back to the Instagram thing really fast, you know, I love to talk shit on social media, okay</p>
<p>These people like with their outfits</p>
<p>Yo</p>
<p>These people are putting so much more work and effort into their outfits than you can even fucking imagine</p>
<p>Like the baggy clothes and the whole like I don&rsquo;t even know what to call it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to like mark the trend but like the thrifters</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll call them is like the thrifters</p>
<p>The ones that are always thrifting and have all like the vintage looking clothes and they just like have their messy little outfits</p>
<p>But they look good. It&rsquo;s like the shit that doesn&rsquo;t match but it looks cute the way that they wear it. These people are</p>
<p>Planning them shits a week in advance. They got their fucking clothes laid out like the first day of school, bitch</p>
<p>They are picking those fits so much harder than you think</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just waking up in the morning and throwing some shit together and going out the door</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re spending like an hour two hours on that shit. Okay, and then to get pictures in it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been another fucking hour with a tripod in the middle of a parking garage by herself</p>
<p>Frustrated try to fucking brush before the Sun goes down</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just setting the scene for you</p>
<p>People be trying so much more than you think</p>
<p>This effortless look like girls be putting on makeup to look like they&rsquo;re wearing no makeup</p>
<p>My sister taught me that a long time ago</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the no makeup makeup look and people be putting on outfits to look like they&rsquo;re not trying like the effortless outfit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not effortless</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to look effortless</p>
<p>The people that actually look effortless are crackheads or the people on the side of the fucking road</p>
<p>That really aren&rsquo;t trying with the fucking tutu and the goddamn Dora backpack</p>
<p>Those are the tweakers are the ones that actually don&rsquo;t give a fuck and I actually don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>The people that are trying to look effortless</p>
<p>Are not actually effortless just remind yourself of that</p>
<p>Let me be the reassurance because I need to hear it too</p>
<p>Like I get down on myself because I be wearing like the same outfit three four fucking times if it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not dirty bitch. I&rsquo;m not gross like it&rsquo;s so clean. I&rsquo;m still wearing it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just difficult for me to pick outfits like to find outfits. It just seems like everybody just throws them together real quick</p>
<p>No, bitch, not for me. It takes me like a while to make an outfit. That&rsquo;s why I be recycling it</p>
<p>And when I do find a really good outfit, it&rsquo;s usually by accident like I&rsquo;ll stumble upon it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just randomly be throwing shit on and then it just looks good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, okay, or I&rsquo;ll change the shoe and I&rsquo;m like, all right, let&rsquo;s do this. That&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have so many shoes. I just wear the same fucking outfit with a new shoe done. Oh</p>
<p>Skincare is another thing</p>
<p>People with good-ass skin online you&rsquo;d be shocked at how many more people be trying as fuck with their skin</p>
<p>Cuz like there was this boy that I follow on tik-tok and he&rsquo;s not very big</p>
<p>He has like 20 something thousand followers, but this one fuckers cute. Okay, like he&rsquo;s like weird</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like one of them little like I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like an indie boy. I don&rsquo;t know what indie boy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the word indie means, but that just sounds like if it&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;s real cute. He&rsquo;s blonde</p>
<p>He got nice lips for a white boy</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s like real cute really really good fucking skin and he went on live</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like a shoemaker. He&rsquo;s like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know what he does</p>
<p>Like he makes really cool ass shoes and like he&rsquo;s just doing his little thing</p>
<p>But everything he posts is about it&rsquo;s like the effortless look it&rsquo;s like that I&rsquo;m not trying shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just naturally cool vibe. So he was on his live and</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Commented like yo drop the skincare routine because that shit&rsquo;s impeccable and he like laughed and was like yo</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on accutane for however long and I use this this and this for my skin and my fucking jaw dropped</p>
<p>Like this boy put in so much more effort into his skin</p>
<p>Making it look the way it does than I thought like you just know what a straight boy</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck a toner is. They don&rsquo;t know what moisturizer is</p>
<p>They use a fucking bar soap in the shower and some goddamn</p>
<p>Air to moisturize when they get out that towel</p>
<p>They just wipe their face with a towel and they&rsquo;re done like that&rsquo;s how they do their fucking skin</p>
<p>But this boy like I just was not expecting it cuz his whole brand is so effortless</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying and then when I asked about his skin and homie like revealed himself. I was like, oh you low-key a faggot, huh?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just kidding when I say shit like that. I&rsquo;d be joking</p>
<p>okay, but yeah, like the whole point is like people put so much more effort than you think and just cuz they&rsquo;re not posting that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying don&rsquo;t mean they ain&rsquo;t trying they&rsquo;d be trying bitch</p>
<p>but my</p>
<p>reassuring message to you is</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up or think something&rsquo;s gone wrong because you&rsquo;re struggling. It&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s fucking struggling. You just don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not cute to struggle like</p>
<p>Society does not make it like where you&rsquo;re allowed to struggle if you voice that you&rsquo;re struggling people will think you&rsquo;re complaining and that you&rsquo;re bitching</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why no one talks about it</p>
<p>But everyone is struggling</p>
<p>Every single fucking person is struggling with something that they&rsquo;re dealing with going through or working towards</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot fucking harder than you think for everyone. It&rsquo;s not just you that it&rsquo;s hard for</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my reassuring message that&rsquo;s what you need to fucking hear and replay that shit bitch cuz that was great</p>
<p>Pastor Leo&rsquo;s awesome shit came back from some trips and here I am Sunday service, bitch</p>
<p>Okay, this episode is not that long</p>
<p>Like I thought it was gonna be longer</p>
<p>Cuz I covered so many fucking big-ass topics and like realizations in one episode</p>
<p>I thought this would be so much longer. I just talked fast like I&rsquo;d be getting to the point</p>
<p>Sometimes I repeat the point but I get to the point, you know</p>
<p>Like shit, I want to make this longer. I wanted this like an hour and 20 minutes speech</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t even gonna be like 40 something</p>
<p>All right. That&rsquo;s all I got for this episode. I think that&rsquo;s all my brain can fucking handle for this week</p>
<p>Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed this leave me a five-star rating, but only five stars</p>
