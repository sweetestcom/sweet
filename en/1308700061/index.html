    <p>Our card this week is Joseph Polici, the Jack of Hearts from Connecticut.</p>
<p>Joe was a father of three and a successful restaurateur when he was abducted and shot</p>
<p>to death in 1973.</p>
<p>Everyone in Stanford seems to know who&rsquo;s responsible.</p>
<p>The real mystery is, why hasn&rsquo;t anyone ever been charged with Joe&rsquo;s murder?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was early afternoon on Sunday, February 4, 1973, and in Stanford, Connecticut, a young</p>
<p>woman named Toni was headed home after church.</p>
<p>She was a couple of blocks away, driving on Windover Lane, when something caught her eye.</p>
<p>Parked by the side of the road at the corner of the intersection was her red Pontiac, which</p>
<p>she had loaned to her big brother, 32-year-old Joseph Polici.</p>
<p>She was surprised to see it, because this isn&rsquo;t a road that people typically park on,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really no space to park.</p>
<p>But she also knew the Pontiac was having some transmission problems, so she figured maybe</p>
<p>it just broke down.</p>
<p>In which case, Joe would have made the quick walk back to their parents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p>But when she got home, only their father was there.</p>
<p>When she asked about Joe, her dad told her that he left the house about an hour and a</p>
<p>half ago, like around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>She knew he had plans to visit his three children and then go work at Polici&rsquo;s, which was this</p>
<p>popular Italian restaurant that had been owned by their family for decades, and Joe tended</p>
<p>bar and helped operate the place.</p>
<p>So Toni called him there to find out what had happened with the car.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t Joe who picked up the phone.</p>
<p>It was her other brother.</p>
<p>He told Toni that Joe never showed up.</p>
<p>And that is when Toni started to get really worried.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like Joe to just pull a no-call, no-show.</p>
<p>So next, the family reached out to Joe&rsquo;s wife, Frances.</p>
<p>Even though they didn&rsquo;t live together at the moment because of some marital trouble,</p>
<p>Joe and Frances shared kids, and they were trying to see if they wanted to reconcile.</p>
<p>So they were in touch.</p>
<p>And again, he had planned to go see the kids before work.</p>
<p>But just like Joe didn&rsquo;t show up for his shift, when they got Frances on the phone,</p>
<p>they learned that Joe didn&rsquo;t show up to see his kids either.</p>
<p>And that is when Toni&rsquo;s worry turned to fear.</p>
<p>As time went by, the phone calls kept escalating.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t get here.</p>
<p>We were a close family.</p>
<p>We only went home and to work at the restaurant, which was five minutes away.</p>
<p>We never deviated.</p>
<p>And you just knew in your heart, you knew something bad happened.</p>
<p>By now, the whole family was on high alert.</p>
<p>And not knowing where Joe might be, his brother Anthony turned to the only physical thing</p>
<p>that pointed to Joe&rsquo;s last whereabouts, the abandoned car.</p>
<p>When he went to check out the Pontiac, the car was locked up tight.</p>
<p>But he noticed something alarming.</p>
<p>The center console was open.</p>
<p>And that, he knew, is where Joe kept a gun.</p>
<p>You see, Joe had actually been on high alert lately.</p>
<p>He was having an affair with a woman named Aida.</p>
<p>And his wife knew about it by that point, which probably wasn&rsquo;t helping with any potential</p>
<p>reconciliation.</p>
<p>In fact, it had caused a lot of drama for him.</p>
<p>With his wife, sure, but also with Aida&rsquo;s ex-husband, 33-year-old Fernando Merry.</p>
<p>Fernando couldn&rsquo;t stand Joe.</p>
<p>He had been threatening him for months.</p>
<p>And while the threats didn&rsquo;t stop the affair, they must have really bothered him.</p>
<p>Because according to Stanford Advocate reporter Angela Carella, Joe had been acting strange</p>
<p>over the past winter.</p>
<p>He was nervous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d like look out his window and check the street before leaving the house.</p>
<p>He had gotten two guns, one for the car and another that he kept on him.</p>
<p>He just wasn&rsquo;t acting like the upbeat, happy-go-lucky guy that everyone was used to.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s family was aware of the situation.</p>
<p>And right away, they started wondering if Fernando was behind Joe&rsquo;s strange disappearance.</p>
<p>Especially because Fernando was acting sketchy that day.</p>
<p>Tony said that he kept calling the restaurant that day, Sunday, and asking for Joe.</p>
<p>And Fernando made it a point to let people there know, or to think anyway, that he himself</p>
<p>was out of the state, which he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Francis and Tony went to the Stanford Police Department and tried to report Joe missing.</p>
<p>But Tony said that they were told to come back in 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, someone might have taken the report because an article in the Stanford Advocate</p>
<p>says that Joe was officially reported missing by his brother that Sunday at 5.30 p.m.</p>
<p>And the Connecticut Sunday Herald reported that an all-points bulletin was issued for</p>
<p>Fernando that very night.</p>
<p>Police were especially interested in finding Fernando after they spoke with Aida.</p>
<p>According to former Stanford Sergeant Butch Lupinacci, Aida told investigators that Fernando</p>
<p>had visitation with his daughter from 1 to 6 p.m. that Sunday.</p>
<p>Instead, he showed up to her house around 11 a.m. and insisted on taking her early.</p>
<p>But within minutes, he brought her back and said that she wanted to play with her friends.</p>
<p>So he left again and then returned at 1, like he was supposed to in the first place.</p>
<p>Then he only kept her until 3 that afternoon.</p>
<p>To Butch, this is weird, and he wonders if all that back and forth was part of some bigger</p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p>Is he alibis-ing himself?</p>
<p>Because the wife had him there.</p>
<p>He picked up the daughter for a short time and brought her right back.</p>
<p>And then came back again and picked her up.</p>
<p>Is he just getting an alibi because he helped set up the homicide?</p>
<p>Plus Aida told investigators about a disturbing conversation that they had when he dropped</p>
<p>their daughter off.</p>
<p>By then, she knew Joe was MIA, and she told her ex he better not be involved.</p>
<p>Fernando reportedly told her that if he did something to Joe, no one would ever find him</p>
<p>because he would throw him over a wall.</p>
<p>Not exactly a reassuring denial.</p>
<p>But even with the family and police focused on Fernando, rumors started flying immediately</p>
<p>that Joe&rsquo;s disappearance had nothing to do with the love triangle, and everything</p>
<p>to do with the mob.</p>
<p>According to Daily Advocate reporter Carrie Tessarero, word on the street was that Joe</p>
<p>had gambling debts and owed money to some dangerous people.</p>
<p>And there were plenty of dangerous people around.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Stanford was essentially controlled by the mob, specifically the infamous Genovese</p>
<p>and Gambino New York crime families, who ran the local drug, gambling, loan sharking, and</p>
<p>extortion rings.</p>
<p>But police maintained that the rumors about Joe had no merit, and Butch added that money</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t an issue for the Policis.</p>
<p>Their restaurant, located on the city&rsquo;s predominantly Italian west side, was thriving,</p>
<p>and it was frequented by the rich and famous like Joe DiMaggio, Tony Bennett, Danny Glover,</p>
<p>and Walter Cronkite.</p>
<p>It was the busiest restaurant in Fairfield County at the time, practically.</p>
<p>If you went there on a Saturday night back in that day, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;re standing</p>
<p>But the gossip was persistent.</p>
<p>And it probably didn&rsquo;t help that Stanford PD put Lieutenant Larry Hogan in charge of</p>
<p>the investigation.</p>
<p>According to Daily Advocate reporter Frank M. Fideli, he led the department&rsquo;s special</p>
<p>services squad, which handled cases involving drugs and illegal gambling.</p>
<p>He was also the founder and commander of a regional narcotics squad.</p>
<p>Police told the Sunday Herald that Lieutenant Hogan was a member of the group, and that</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t knowledge of the west side that yielded a startling find the day after</p>
<p>Joe vanished, Monday, February 5th.</p>
<p>A man walking by a partially frozen reservoir in the nearby town of Greenwich spotted three</p>
<p>guns and some keys laying on the ice.</p>
<p>And I just have to pause here really quick and say, there&rsquo;s been a ton of conflicting</p>
<p>between the two sides of the story.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to note that the two sides of the story are very different</p>
<p>from one another.</p>
<p>And I just have to pause here really quick and say, there&rsquo;s been a ton of conflicting</p>
<p>news coverage about the guns, actually not just the guns, but Joe&rsquo;s entire case.</p>
<p>Butch told us that several key details that were reported are wrong.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re primarily going with his information, which comes from official records.</p>
<p>And what he told us is when investigators collected everything from the ice, they determined</p>
<p>two of the guns, both loaded, were registered to Joe, and the keys were to the Pontiac.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t tell who owned the third gun, a five-shot .38 caliber revolver.</p>
<p>But they knew it had been fired because there were five spent shell casings in the chamber.</p>
<p>Revolvers don&rsquo;t eject those.</p>
<p>That same day, Lieutenant Hogan got in touch with Fernando&rsquo;s lawyer, who arranged for</p>
<p>him to come in for questioning.</p>
<p>And he denied any involvement in Joe&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is Fernando actually used to be a family friend of the Pellicci&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>at least until Joe and Aida got together.</p>
<p>But while Fernando admitted to reporters that he didn&rsquo;t like Joe, he said he still</p>
<p>respected the Pellicci&rsquo;s and sympathized with their grief over his disappearance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if police believed Fernando, but I do know that they had already started</p>
<p>to eye other potential suspects who took the investigation in a whole different direction.</p>
<p>Because witnesses told officers about an unusual car on or near Wendover Lane around the time</p>
<p>Joe vanished on Sunday.</p>
<p>A newspaper delivery man reported seeing a powder blue Cadillac parked on a side street</p>
<p>near Wendover that morning, just before 11.</p>
<p>There was a man sitting inside of it wearing dark sunglasses, and the delivery man said</p>
<p>he seemed out of place.</p>
<p>A woman who lived right next to where the Pontiac was found told police that she also</p>
<p>saw a powder blue Cadillac.</p>
<p>It was parked on the side of Wendover Lane at the corner of the intersection when she</p>
<p>left her house at around 11.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, cars don&rsquo;t generally park on this road, so the Cadillac caught</p>
<p>her attention, and she too saw a man inside wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p>She even took note of the personalized license plate.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t recall the whole thing, but she was able to give police most of the letters.</p>
<p>Police asked Aida about the Cadillac, wondering if Fernando ever drove one like it.</p>
<p>She told them he didn&rsquo;t, but she did know someone who did, and that someone just happened</p>
<p>to despise Joe.</p>
<p>That person was Joe&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Francis&rsquo; younger brother, a 28-year-old man that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna call Joshua.</p>
<p>He was reportedly furious on his sister&rsquo;s behalf about the affair and unofficial separation.</p>
<p>Police were able to quickly confirm that Joshua owned the Cadillac.</p>
<p>And Joe&rsquo;s sister, Toni, grew suspicious when she heard about his Cadillac being in</p>
<p>the area.</p>
<p>So in an effort to do a little of her own investigative work, the next time Francis</p>
<p>came over to the Policis&rsquo; house, Toni listened as she called her brother.</p>
<p>Joshua told his sister that he was in New York.</p>
<p>He had gotten hurt somehow and needed to see a doctor, but he admitted that he had been</p>
<p>in the Westover neighborhood that Sunday when Joe went missing.</p>
<p>He said that he and a buddy of his were testing out some walkie-talkies.</p>
<p>Francis asked him if he saw anything unusual while he was out and about, but he said no.</p>
<p>When police interviewed Joshua a couple of days later, he initially denied being anywhere</p>
<p>near Wendover on Sunday.</p>
<p>But when they told him that his car had been spotted by multiple people, he finally conceded</p>
<p>that he had been in the general vicinity, although he claimed that he didn&rsquo;t recall</p>
<p>going on that specific road.</p>
<p>He gave them the same walkie-talkie story and said he dropped off his friend at a nearby</p>
<p>school and drove around trying to connect with him from various locations.</p>
<p>His friend is this 31-year-old man that we&rsquo;re going to call Alfred.</p>
<p>Anyway, after that, they went back to Alfred&rsquo;s place and washed the Cadillac, inside and</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if investigators asked him why he decided to wash his car, inside and</p>
<p>out, in February, in Connecticut, in the freezing cold, but apparently the car still wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>clean enough for his taste because he said he also took it to a nearby car wash on Monday</p>
<p>and forgot to close one of the windows when he went through.</p>
<p>You get where this is going, right?</p>
<p>Joshua gave permission for police to search his car, but the right back seat was still</p>
<p>soaking wet from the car wash debacle.</p>
<p>The trunk was, too, although he told police that the car leaked back there, which they</p>
<p>verified with the dealership he bought it from.</p>
<p>Now, it was notable that Joshua mentioned hanging out with another guy, again, this</p>
<p>friend that we&rsquo;re calling Alfred, because there&rsquo;s this thing that Butch told us.</p>
<p>There was a man who was new to the neighborhood who reported seeing three guys on the side</p>
<p>of the road, outside of a car, talking.</p>
<p>Now, again, this guy&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know any of them.</p>
<p>But if one of those guys was Joe, it means that Joe was last seen with two men.</p>
<p>But why would he be stopped in a weird area talking to two guys outside of his car, especially</p>
<p>if one of those guys was someone who hated him?</p>
<p>Well, Butch has a theory.</p>
<p>Basically, his theory is that Joshua approached him with some kind of excuse about going with</p>
<p>him, and he thinks that Joe would have done this because when he talked to Joe&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>and friends, everybody that knew Joe said that even though he knew Joshua hated him,</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t have had a problem going with him.</p>
<p>He would have just gone.</p>
<p>Despite all the bizarre circumstances of Joe&rsquo;s disappearance that would have any crime junkie</p>
<p>sounding the alarm, the Stanford PD insisted to reporters at the time that there were no</p>
<p>signs of foul play.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hogan told the Sunday Herald that Joe might just be on vacation.</p>
<p>But the Pellicci family didn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like many other people did either.</p>
<p>Joe had never done anything like this before, and there was no logical explanation for his</p>
<p>guns and keys turning up a town away, dumped by someone who hadn&rsquo;t realized the reservoir</p>
<p>was mostly frozen.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t comforted when the police searched that same area and didn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a body, because Joe&rsquo;s family believed that he had been abducted.</p>
<p>Every step of the way, it just got more dismal.</p>
<p>Now, the Pellicci&rsquo;s relationship with Frances, Joe&rsquo;s wife, hadn&rsquo;t been great before all</p>
<p>of this.</p>
<p>And honestly, that&rsquo;s kind of an understatement.</p>
<p>His marriage was so toxic.</p>
<p>She was not only toxic for him, she was toxic for our entire family.</p>
<p>She made every year they were together completely miserable for all of us.</p>
<p>She would get to the point where she wouldn&rsquo;t allow Joe to talk to us, to see us, or bring</p>
<p>his children.</p>
<p>He would have to sneak his children to come see my mother and father.</p>
<p>But things got worse once Joe disappeared.</p>
<p>Because while Toni said Frances seemed genuinely upset, she also rallied to her brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>side after police quickly started homing in on him.</p>
<p>Frances said she didn&rsquo;t believe Joshua was involved, and he even moved in with her and</p>
<p>the kids for a while.</p>
<p>For nearly a month, Joe&rsquo;s loved ones waited and worried.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t sit idly by.</p>
<p>They conducted their own searches throughout Stamford and Greenwich, canvassed neighborhoods,</p>
<p>and put up a reward for information.</p>
<p>And on Friday, March 2nd, about 20 miles away in Westchester County, New York, a Town</p>
<p>Highway Department employee driving a road grader in North Salem made a gruesome discovery.</p>
<p>According to the Sunday Herald, behind a crumbling stone wall and wire fence in a desolated wooded</p>
<p>area was the body of a man.</p>
<p>Joe had finally been found.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t look like he was supposed to be found.</p>
<p>The employee only saw him because of the high seat on the road grader that he was driving.</p>
<p>Joe was on his back, fully clothed, with a blanket secured around his head using green</p>
<p>twine.</p>
<p>He still had his wallet with him, $55 in it and all.</p>
<p>The medical examiner estimated that he had been out there for a few weeks, and the autopsy</p>
<p>determined that he had been shot six times in the head and back.</p>
<p>Since he was found in Westchester County, the homicide investigation fell to New York</p>
<p>State Police.</p>
<p>And even though law enforcement told reporters that there were no quote-unquote gangland</p>
<p>overtones to the murder, back home in Stamford, those old rumors started bubbling up again,</p>
<p>and everyone assumed Joe&rsquo;s death was a mob hit.</p>
<p>Everyone except his heartbroken family.</p>
<p>The rumors circulating in the community were salt in already terrible wounds as they planned</p>
<p>a funeral.</p>
<p>Now, you might remember that Fernando, who is Aida&rsquo;s husband, Aida is the woman Joe</p>
<p>was having an affair with, he made a very specific comment about throwing Joe over a</p>
<p>wall.</p>
<p>So, you might think Joe being found behind a wall would at least warrant some sort of</p>
<p>follow-up conversation with him.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>They never bothered with him again.</p>
<p>Never questioned him about it.</p>
<p>Investigators at the time only focused on Joshua and his buddy Alfred.</p>
<p>Joshua had gotten himself a lawyer since his initial conversation with police.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t speak with investigators again, and he refused to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>But Alfred was another story.</p>
<p>Police had questioned him while Joe was still a missing person, and he sat down for another</p>
<p>interview, this time with the New York State Police.</p>
<p>He denied having anything to do with the murder and agreed to take a polygraph that same day.</p>
<p>The polygraphist thought Alfred was being deceptive, but the machine malfunctioned at</p>
<p>some point during the exam, so they couldn&rsquo;t get full results.</p>
<p>Alfred said that he&rsquo;d take another one, but within days he hired a lawyer, and he</p>
<p>never did actually take another one.</p>
<p>He did, however, discuss a deal with authorities that would grant him immunity in exchange</p>
<p>for his cooperation.</p>
<p>The problem was the wording of the proposal.</p>
<p>It was almost like they were discouraging him from being a state&rsquo;s witness.</p>
<p>He will not be prosecuted based on any statements which he makes to representatives of the Stanford</p>
<p>Police or New York State Police.</p>
<p>But this will not bar prosecution based on facts which are discovered completely and</p>
<p>far and independent of his testimony.</p>
<p>If we find through an independent investigation you&rsquo;re involved, any involvement, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be charged.</p>
<p>So where is the immunity?</p>
<p>Plus, Alfred could still be charged if he had quote-unquote intentionally helped anyone</p>
<p>kill Joe, which is exactly what they wanted him to admit to.</p>
<p>My opinion, right between the lines, they&rsquo;re telling him not to cooperate.</p>
<p>Butch said there&rsquo;s no record of Alfred ever admitting to anything, even during the discussion</p>
<p>about this potential deal.</p>
<p>After he saw the sort of but not really immunity terms they were offering, he and his lawyer</p>
<p>stopped communicating with authorities.</p>
<p>But even without Alfred&rsquo;s testimony, investigators were at an advantage because they had physical</p>
<p>evidence and lots of it.</p>
<p>The blanket that Joe&rsquo;s head was wrapped in was especially helpful.</p>
<p>It held a treasure trove of clues.</p>
<p>There was actually a name embroidered on it.</p>
<p>Police found out who that person was, tracked him down, and learned from his mother that</p>
<p>she had given the blanket away a while back.</p>
<p>They followed the trail of the blanket to the superintendent of an apartment building,</p>
<p>who just happened to be, drumroll please, Alfred&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Alfred&rsquo;s mother told police that they had given the blanket to their son.</p>
<p>Investigators also learned that Alfred&rsquo;s father had been hospitalized recently and</p>
<p>a friend gave him a get well soon gift, a plant that was held together with green twine.</p>
<p>The circumstantial evidence was piling up, so police were able to get a search warrant</p>
<p>for Joshua&rsquo;s Cadillac for physical evidence.</p>
<p>They processed it and found fibers that, when tested, matched the blanket and the green</p>
<p>twine, along with hairs that were microscopically similar to Joe&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>And speaking of physical evidence, ballistics testing determined that the .38 caliber five</p>
<p>shot revolver found at the reservoir was the murder weapon used to shoot Joe six times,</p>
<p>which meant that whoever shot Joe had to reload it.</p>
<p>Police managed to trace the gun to a shop in Scranton, Pennsylvania, just a few miles</p>
<p>from Joshua&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s hometown.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t determine exactly who the gun was sold to, but they were confident all the</p>
<p>evidence was strongly pointing toward Joshua and Alfred.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Policis waited, for updates, for information, for someone to be held accountable</p>
<p>for Joe&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>They were well aware of the developments that had been made up to this point, and knowing</p>
<p>that investigators had so much evidence, they couldn&rsquo;t understand why no arrests were</p>
<p>being made.</p>
<p>And same, no one could understand it, not the community, not Joe&rsquo;s loved ones, not</p>
<p>even the police.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering, hey Ashley, what the f*** are we doing here?</p>
<p>How did this guy&rsquo;s face end up on a deck of cold case playing cards?</p>
<p>Well, this is where it gets ugly.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s story was supposed to be featured on a TV show called Justice Delivered, a docu-series</p>
<p>about an investigative team trying to reopen and solve cold cases.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the show never aired, but according to a write-up for it, there</p>
<p>are three main reasons Joe&rsquo;s murder went unsolved.</p>
<p>For starters, Lieutenant Hogan, who was still supervising Stamford&rsquo;s end of the investigation,</p>
<p>was a little busy with other things at the time.</p>
<p>If you recall, he was in charge of the regional narcotics squad, and in the years following</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s murder, he told the Stamford advocate that heroin use was on the rise in the city.</p>
<p>Which he would know, because as it turns out, Hogan was also running a drug ring for the</p>
<p>mob.</p>
<p>Stamford in the 1970s was notoriously corrupt.</p>
<p>Organized crime infiltrated City Hall, and government departments were rife with bribery,</p>
<p>embezzlement, nepotism, and other wrongdoings.</p>
<p>It was so blatant that, according to Angela Carrello&rsquo;s reporting, officials would meet</p>
<p>weekly with mobsters to go over city business.</p>
<p>And this corruption was most rampant in the Stamford Police Department.</p>
<p>In his book, Law and Justice in Everyday Life, Andy Tebow detailed how cops robbed</p>
<p>liquor stores, burglarized homes, ran guns to Ireland.</p>
<p>One sergeant was even a suspect in as many as five murders.</p>
<p>I mean, s**t was out of control.</p>
<p>And Hogan allegedly wore a lot of criminal hats for the Gambino crime family.</p>
<p>The guy was involved in homicides, drugs, taking money from illegal car thieves.</p>
<p>You name it, he was involved as long as he could get a dollar from.</p>
<p>This was sort of an open secret.</p>
<p>People in the streets knew, lots of cops knew, but everyone was afraid to tell on Hogan,</p>
<p>and no one knew who to trust.</p>
<p>Officers who tried to quietly complain to higher-ups about what was going on were outed</p>
<p>as snitches by those same higher-ups.</p>
<p>But you know what they say, what&rsquo;s done in the dark will come to light.</p>
<p>It turned out that federal and state authorities were watching the Stamford PD.</p>
<p>One cop even pretended to quit the force so he could go undercover and investigate his</p>
<p>own department, although a mobster&rsquo;s sister who worked in city payroll blew his cover</p>
<p>when she revealed that he was still getting paychecks.</p>
<p>But honest police officers and other government employees who were sick of the BS started</p>
<p>to contact Stamford advocate reporter Anthony Dolan.</p>
<p>His articles eventually led to 15 city and state officials resigning, getting fired,</p>
<p>arrested, or indicted, and he won a Pulitzer Prize for his work.</p>
<p>As for Hogan, he retired in 1977 under a cloud of suspicion, and in 1981, he was convicted</p>
<p>on a heroin conspiracy charge and sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
<p>But two years later, a federal appeals court voided the indictment after deciding the prosecutor</p>
<p>prejudiced the grand jury by bringing up unrelated and unproven allegations.</p>
<p>Court records show the prosecutor suggested Hogan was guilty of misconduct when he was</p>
<p>a police officer, and let it be known that authorities were investigating him in connection</p>
<p>with two murders.</p>
<p>Hogan was re-indicted on the heroin charge in 1984, along with one of those murders and</p>
<p>another drug charge.</p>
<p>According to Hartford Courant reporter George Gambasi, he was accused of being part of a</p>
<p>scheme to steal cocaine from a drug dealer, and authorities said he was there when the</p>
<p>guy was shot and killed.</p>
<p>But he never had his day in court.</p>
<p>He died that same year of cancer.</p>
<p>Now Butch was not on the police force when all of this was going down.</p>
<p>He joined the Stamford PD in 79.</p>
<p>And in a first ever twist for the deck, he actually married Joe&rsquo;s sister, Toni.</p>
<p>So needless to say, he became very familiar with the case.</p>
<p>And when he joined the detective bureau, he was allowed to help New York State Police</p>
<p>work it off and on.</p>
<p>But he also grew frustrated because what he quickly found out was that even though police</p>
<p>were convinced from near day one that they knew what led up to Joe&rsquo;s murder, who was</p>
<p>behind it, and to some extent how it happened, the aftermath of it was steeped in mystery.</p>
<p>For instance, it was never clear why Hogan was put in charge of the case.</p>
<p>Butch said Hogan later claimed it was because he knew the Policis well.</p>
<p>But if he did, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a reason to assign him the case.</p>
<p>Not to mention, Butch said that the family couldn&rsquo;t stand him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the midst of this investigation, while the family is heartbroken and everything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asking Toni Polici to go away with him for the weekend.</p>
<p>Because if that isn&rsquo;t a creepy enough thing to do to someone while you&rsquo;re supposedly</p>
<p>trying, but maybe just pretending to investigate their brother&rsquo;s murder, when Toni turned</p>
<p>him down, he made sure to let her know that some lab results from Joe&rsquo;s evidence were</p>
<p>due to come in soon.</p>
<p>The implication being, you scratch my back, I&rsquo;ll scratch yours.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is some investigators said they were able to work the case until</p>
<p>it seemed like they were getting close to an arrest.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be taken off with little explanation.</p>
<p>And we know certain leads were never followed up on.</p>
<p>Take the Fernando situation, for example.</p>
<p>Toni doesn&rsquo;t think that he was directly involved, but she does think that he might</p>
<p>have known about what was happening.</p>
<p>And Butch speculated that Fernando could have shown Joshua and Alfred where to dump Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll probably never know since police apparently never revisited him as a suspect.</p>
<p>There are also questions surrounding Joe&rsquo;s wife, Frances.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always maintained that she had no involvement whatsoever in Joe&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And we know she gave a statement to police.</p>
<p>But Butch said there&rsquo;s really no documentation laying out how she was questioned or what</p>
<p>she was asked, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Butch spoke with Frances himself decades after Joe&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He said that she told him early on she didn&rsquo;t think her brother Joshua was involved.</p>
<p>But as the years passed, she came to believe that he was, and she cut ties with him.</p>
<p>As for Joe&rsquo;s sister, Toni, she doesn&rsquo;t think Frances ever intended for Joe to get</p>
<p>killed.</p>
<p>But she does think Frances&rsquo;s actions led to the outcome.</p>
<p>But Joe&rsquo;s wake, she just was hysterical.</p>
<p>She was saying, I wanted you back, but not like this.</p>
<p>And I remember her saying to somebody, I just wanted him to get a good beating on the corner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what she said, a good beating on the corner.</p>
<p>And they got him on the corner, but they did more than just give him a good beating.</p>
<p>Do you believe that she did ask her brother to approach him and like maybe put the scare</p>
<p>in him a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>The point is, these are questions police should have been more concerned with back when everything</p>
<p>was happening.</p>
<p>But assuming the murder had nothing to do with Joe owing money to the mob, why wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Hogan want it solved?</p>
<p>Well, there are some theories.</p>
<p>Like there was a rumor that Joshua&rsquo;s family had some organized crime connections in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>and they had Hogan shut the investigation down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also talk that Hogan was paid off.</p>
<p>So reason number one, why this case is unsolved, possible police corruption in the case.</p>
<p>And to be clear, there was for sure police corruption happening right and left, but here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a theory.</p>
<p>But that theory doesn&rsquo;t explain why authorities in New York didn&rsquo;t move ahead and press charges.</p>
<p>Stamford had a missing person slash abduction case that stayed open even after Joe&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>was found, but the homicide was New York&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That segues into the second reason.</p>
<p>As per Justice Delivered, that is a lack of cooperation from both law enforcement jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Now Butch said the departments did work together and New York State Police tried to reopen</p>
<p>the case once.</p>
<p>But I think Stamford always had more of a vested interest in solving it.</p>
<p>After all, Joe was abducted in their backyard.</p>
<p>And for all we know, he might have been killed there too.</p>
<p>That could help explain why the murder weapon was dumped in a Connecticut reservoir.</p>
<p>Maybe they were done using it by the time they got to New York.</p>
<p>They should have took the case back here immediately.</p>
<p>Butch isn&rsquo;t sure if the Westchester County D.A. ever put the case to a grand jury.</p>
<p>But he presented everything he had to the D.A.&rsquo;s office at some point, and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>move forward with it.</p>
<p>Which brings us to cold case reason number three.</p>
<p>According to Justice Delivered, evidence went missing over the years.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, DNA testing started getting popular.</p>
<p>Butch and a New York investigator made plans to bring the blanket to a lab to see if the</p>
<p>newer forensic technology could help out.</p>
<p>But when the New York investigator went to retrieve it from storage, it wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Butch was floored.</p>
<p>Departments don&rsquo;t just toss out key pieces of evidence in homicides.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how it could have happened or even when.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen an investigation with so many available answers leave behind</p>
<p>so many questions.</p>
<p>But there is still hope for this case.</p>
<p>Because while Alfred died in 1997, Joshua is still alive.</p>
<p>Which means that if he was involved in what happened to Joe in any way, he can still be</p>
<p>held responsible.</p>
<p>Joshua is still living in Stanford today.</p>
<p>He lives actually just a mile from the restaurant.</p>
<p>And Butch actually ran into him one time at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Joshua initiated a conversation by saying, I know you, you&rsquo;re that s**t detective.</p>
<p>Butch replied by saying, I&rsquo;m a s**t cop, you&rsquo;re an effing murderer.</p>
<p>And his only response was prove it in court.</p>
<p>Not I didn&rsquo;t do it or this or that.</p>
<p>Prove it in court.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what Butch is trying to do even though he&rsquo;s retired now.</p>
<p>He lobbied authorities in New York to transfer the homicide over to Stanford PD, which they</p>
<p>did in March of 2018.</p>
<p>And even without the blanket, there&rsquo;s still physical evidence police can work with.</p>
<p>It has been 50 years since Joe was killed.</p>
<p>But to his sister, Toni, it sometimes feels like it happened just yesterday.</p>
<p>Joe was her best friend.</p>
<p>We were really close.</p>
<p>We did everything together.</p>
<p>When he had his first child, I was only 10.</p>
<p>At that time, the restrictions were pretty harsh in bringing children into hospitals</p>
<p>for visitation.</p>
<p>But he got me a pair of high heels and he snuck me in to see his firstborn.</p>
<p>Very protective, very loving.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have him long enough, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s loved ones have kept his memory alive, from tributes in the restaurant, which is</p>
<p>still open, to an annual memorial golf tournament to raise money for charity.</p>
<p>And after years of estrangement, the family was thrilled to reconnect with Joe&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve lost a lot over the years.</p>
<p>Toni and her sister are the last Polici siblings left.</p>
<p>Their other brother died in 2014.</p>
<p>And their parents died years before that.</p>
<p>Every time we think we have something, some spark, a hole, it dies out.</p>
<p>Maybe you can help keep the spark lit.</p>
<p>Stamford police say that the case is open but not active since they haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>any new leads.</p>
<p>But anyone with information is encouraged to call them.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s you, if you know anything about the murder of Joe Polici, contact Stamford</p>
<p>Police at 203-977-4444.</p>
