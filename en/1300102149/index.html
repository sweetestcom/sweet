with led zeppelin</p><p>yeah who did this</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t even say</p><p>pretty fucking badass</p><p>yeah it doesn&rsquo;t even say who did it</p><p>that&rsquo;s weird</p><p>ladies and gentlemen</p><p>welcome to the podcast our guest</p><p>today is the one and only mr</p><p>al madrigal</p><p>longtime friend</p><p>al and i first</p><p>worked together in san francisco at the old old cops</p><p>tiny cops hundred</p><p>and fifty seaters</p><p>even see a hundred</p><p>fifty probably two hundred tops tops</p><p>we&rsquo;re squeezing</p><p>chairs really</p><p>illegally i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think it got all</p><p>kinds of fire codes violations let&rsquo;s say</p><p>let&rsquo;s say two hundred let&rsquo;s say one</p><p>fifty so we don&rsquo;t get anybody in</p><p>trouble but it was a</p><p>fucking awesome little club</p><p>and then now it&rsquo;s</p><p>like totally different now it&rsquo;s like this big gigantic</p><p>we did new years yeah</p><p>first new years remember that</p><p>a lot of gigs</p><p>a lot of gigs</p><p>same after go from</p><p>going way back to like what 2000</p><p>maybe 2000 i</p><p>think something like that yeah</p><p>yeah 11 years</p><p>i haven&rsquo;t been doing</p><p>i met you when i had just been you know</p><p>started to do</p><p>stand up comedy</p><p>a year in yeah</p><p>we worked together at the old cobs</p><p>you&rsquo;re funny back then even yeah</p><p>a little fuck</p><p>and that it&rsquo;s</p><p>funny because i just</p><p>think i just figured it out</p><p>i just feel like</p><p>my latest stuff has been clearly</p><p>how many years you in now</p><p>12 years 12</p><p>years that&rsquo;s what they say they say 10 years</p><p>takes 10 years for you to become a real comic</p><p>yeah you know like by that</p><p>about that totally you</p><p>know i heard it put</p><p>that 20 it takes</p><p>seven years to get your law degree</p><p>and then another</p><p>seven years for you to become a good lawyer so</p><p>that&rsquo;s the same</p><p>thing with standout</p><p>yeah practicing as</p><p>a professional comedian for x amount of years and then</p><p>becoming really good at it</p><p>finding your own space</p><p>finding who the fuck you are without</p><p>influence of</p><p>other comedians</p><p>and actually having your real personality be you on</p><p>stage that shit takes a long ass time it really does</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re distracted if you have</p><p>other things</p><p>going on oh and it&rsquo;s easy for also you lose your way</p><p>as a stand up and a lot of guys</p><p>you know just stop trying</p><p>my big pitfalls have always been tv shows</p><p>like they&rsquo;ve been great</p><p>you know like news</p><p>radio especially</p><p>like when i was on news</p><p>radio we worked we worked</p><p>some serious long</p><p>hours so you&rsquo;re</p><p>working and you&rsquo;re taking away from your</p><p>standup you&rsquo;re not</p><p>able to hit the clubs as much as you like i&rsquo;ve been on</p><p>i&rsquo;ve done six pilots</p><p>and two that made it on</p><p>the air and so i you know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about because

all about me</p><p>having allergies in front of</p><p>black people</p><p>feels my inferior yeah hey</p><p>sorry here&rsquo;s a fascinating</p><p>thing that i read</p><p>about the h1n1</p><p>virus the flu virus</p><p>they&rsquo;re saying now that the people that survived it</p><p>the people that got it and survived it they have like</p><p>super immune</p><p>systems now</p><p>and now they don&rsquo;t get any flows</p><p>they don&rsquo;t get any of the flows it&rsquo;s like</p><p>they think that they may</p><p>be able to come up with a universal vaccine for flus</p><p>based on the h1n1 wow</p><p>based on the</p><p>people that survived it</p><p>pretty fascinating shit man yeah use em those</p><p>a motherfucker of a flu</p><p>the thing about</p><p>those flus is they&rsquo;re getting better</p><p>they&rsquo;re getting</p><p>stronger they evolve just like</p><p>everything else</p><p>evolves and when</p><p>these assholes take</p><p>their fucking</p><p>medicine they don&rsquo;t take it all</p><p>especially this is</p><p>especially true</p><p>about antibiotics</p><p>people who get sick and they take antibiotics and</p><p>they only take it for like</p><p>until they feel better</p><p>like say if you&rsquo;re supposed to take it for 10 days</p><p>the bacteria that survive is like</p><p>super powerful</p><p>antibiotic resistant bacteria so that becomes like this</p><p>strain that&rsquo;s almost impossible to kill</p><p>that&rsquo;s where this</p><p>mercy shit comes from</p><p>now the people are</p><p>dying from these</p><p>crazy staff infections it&rsquo;s because assholes</p><p>don&rsquo;t take their fucking pills</p><p>they take like</p><p>a percentage of them and then they quit</p><p>and they develop this new fucking</p><p>super virus because of that</p><p>these cunts</p><p>so you got to finish all your</p><p>medication finish your</p><p>medication bitches</p><p>you&rsquo;re not smarter than the scientists who</p><p>corolla shit</p><p>so what we&rsquo;re asking</p><p>people to do is</p><p>use the flashlight</p><p>yeah coconut</p><p>juice beat off into that shit</p><p>just use your</p><p>medication take the all of it take all that shit</p><p>i&rsquo;m really bad at that i</p><p>admit it i get down to the</p><p>last one or two</p><p>and yeah shouldn&rsquo;t do that i&rsquo;m just as guilty</p><p>as anybody else for</p><p>humanity for</p><p>humanity take that shit</p><p>they should give two extra</p><p>just so i don&rsquo;t take this</p><p>too oh god they</p><p>should treat you like a</p><p>child you know what i mean</p><p>i&rsquo;d be bad at</p><p>birth control</p><p>but yeah they should do</p><p>oh you&rsquo;d be pregnant</p><p>yeah i would be totally</p><p>knocked out</p><p>yeah for sure</p><p>abortions all day long</p><p>you know they say that a big</p><p>supply of pharmaceutical drugs are in the</p><p>water supply</p><p>there&rsquo;s not a big</p><p>supply but a big percentage</p><p>like you know there&rsquo;s measurable amounts</p><p>of everything</p><p>everything from antidepressants to</p><p>birth control</p><p>pills in water</p><p>supply yeah</p><p>cause people</p><p>flush their shit</p><p>people flush their</p><p>stuff down the toilet</p><p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p><p>where your water</p><p>supply is coming from a lot of it&rsquo;s coming from</p><p>reconstituted poop</p><p>water you know</p><p>in some places</p><p>right isn&rsquo;t that</p><p>where they get their</p><p>water supply</p><p>they fucking fix up the poop</p><p>water water</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere it&rsquo;s</p><p>never gonna die it&rsquo;s the same water</p><p>jesus christ</p><p>how much can you fool to filter out</p><p>where you&rsquo;re leaving in the</p><p>birth control pills but giving me no poop</p><p>you&rsquo;re sure there&rsquo;s no poop in this there&rsquo;s</p><p>gotta be some poop in there you fuck</p><p>i&rsquo;d like some poop free water</p><p>if the same</p><p>water is coming our way</p><p>that birth control pills get into</p><p>unless i&rsquo;m ignorant</p><p>about how birth control pills get into</p><p>water and they&rsquo;re not being dumped off what</p><p>is the amount of</p><p>birth pills or</p><p>like anything</p><p>going into the</p><p>water system is that really i mean</p><p>large enough to affect it i mean i don&rsquo;t</p><p>know it&rsquo;s a good question but i</p><p>would like zero percent of</p><p>birth control pills of diet not even</p><p>point zero zero</p><p>one there&rsquo;s no pregnant</p><p>water anymore at least</p><p>hmm what what</p><p>yeah i think you know we got to be real careful</p><p>about that shit man you know the idea that</p><p>water is 96</p><p>of our bodies and it&rsquo;s the one</p><p>thing that we love to</p><p>throw things into it&rsquo;s so fucking stupid</p><p>you know we need</p><p>water obviously</p><p>humans need water</p><p>always dumping shit in the</p><p>water because it&rsquo;s so easy</p><p>we&rsquo;re such cunts yeah</p><p>i do a lot of like vigilante</p><p>dumping whatever</p><p>just dumping</p><p>oil and shit no or you know</p><p>i say i&rsquo;m guilty because when i see a dumpster near my</p><p>house i&rsquo;m like i</p><p>gotta put a fucking that</p><p>chair in there</p><p>well there&rsquo;s nothing</p><p>wrong with that but i think</p><p>all countries in</p><p>these companies are actually talking</p><p>oh you know like</p><p>1 800 junk what</p><p>is that yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s where the coming</p><p>they come and get your shit</p><p>they&rsquo;re shipping it to fucking china</p><p>where they&rsquo;re paying for</p><p>cheap landfill</p><p>so huge huge like a</p><p>secret in the</p><p>night fucking barges full</p><p>of our shit</p><p>shows up in</p><p>china and there&rsquo;s a</p><p>landfill all over the</p><p>place and so</p><p>i mean a flushing</p><p>pills down there i mean that&rsquo;s the</p><p>least of our</p><p>trouble it&rsquo;s all</p><p>these foreign</p><p>countries that don&rsquo;t have any luck</p><p>and laws that are just</p><p>allowing you to dump and</p><p>bury and look</p><p>and

love it</p><p>yeah now&rsquo;s not</p><p>the time to have it so just put it in that&rsquo;s my</p><p>first one do</p><p>do you wig out on people that film you</p><p>um i make i make them stop</p><p>some people are just so blatant</p><p>with it they&rsquo;re like sitting</p><p>right in the</p><p>front row and they&rsquo;re</p><p>pointing a camera and you filming like just flip</p><p>video camera just straight up silly</p><p>and i usually</p><p>point it out but sometimes people don&rsquo;t care</p><p>yeah you wanna go just</p><p>enjoy the fucking moment</p><p>enjoy the show i</p><p>like everything</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have to go on youtube i do the</p><p>laugh factory and you&rsquo;re</p><p>standing on the stage</p><p>and there&rsquo;s two monitors on the side you&rsquo;ve done that</p><p>close sure and</p><p>i sometimes look in the audience</p><p>people are watching me on the fucking monitor</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p><p>right here lady</p><p>what the fuck</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>weird people do that at the</p><p>ufc all the time too they watch the</p><p>fights on the monitor</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s in</p><p>front of you

little</p><p>thirteen inch monitor in</p><p>front of me</p><p>well sometimes you get a better perspective yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m doing it</p><p>but it&rsquo;s still</p><p>funny that i&rsquo;m doing it yeah</p><p>right there it&rsquo;s</p><p>right there and i&rsquo;m</p><p>watching a tv</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p><p>i like it on the</p><p>ufc just because it&rsquo;s like the different camera</p><p>angles especially when</p><p>you get on the ground you can&rsquo;t see anything on the</p><p>floor close yeah</p><p>totally yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s real confusing too</p><p>if you&rsquo;re in the</p><p>stands and you don&rsquo;t have commentary</p><p>like a lot of times you don&rsquo;t see what guys are</p><p>going for you don&rsquo;t see</p><p>how a guy so i&rsquo;m trying to set something up you know</p><p>you just went</p><p>out first you</p><p>could see right</p><p>my very first one was the</p><p>las vegas palms</p><p>real recently</p><p>fox fight spike</p><p>night fights</p><p>spike fight</p><p>fight fight fight</p><p>yeah couldn&rsquo;t get it out</p><p>yeah yeah this is the</p><p>finals of the ultimate fighter and

so</p><p>until he was</p><p>like really</p><p>yeah rampage</p><p>rampage was behind them</p><p>because i&rsquo;m in</p><p>front of rampage</p><p>oh yeah you</p><p>couldn&rsquo;t believe</p><p>so he was all</p><p>about his location very</p><p>funny guy he was like a little kid in a</p><p>candy store he</p><p>said he was just loving life that was</p><p>dressed up he wore a blazer</p><p>team with the blazer</p><p>and rainbow socks job</p><p>teams a good dude yeah</p><p>very funny very</p><p>funny guy very smart</p><p>and he&rsquo;s been around for a long time and</p><p>hilarious frustrating when you know you see god</p><p>like that&rsquo;s not getting anywhere and you like how come</p><p>you know what&rsquo;s going on</p><p>yeah what&rsquo;s happening</p><p>why is it war</p><p>of our team</p><p>famous you know</p><p>strange world we live in this comedy world</p><p>so when i met</p><p>you you&rsquo;d only been doing it like what two years</p><p>even less than that less</p><p>than that wow dude i met you in the day son and then</p><p>you recommended me for the comedy</p><p>story yeah sorry</p><p>with it was you and freddy</p><p>soto and it&rsquo;s like oh this is the best</p><p>and i go in and</p><p>and then we were doing the fridays and saturday</p><p>nights there</p><p>until everything blew up over there and then</p><p>i&rsquo;ve worked with you</p><p>quite a bit</p><p>a lot of comedy</p><p>store gigs man</p><p>yeah and you used to have that</p><p>you put in the recorder what i always appreciated</p><p>that joe bought a digital recorder not a digital</p><p>cd burner for the club</p><p>and so i&rsquo;d go</p><p>in there with a cd just constantly on a friday</p><p>night and just show up</p><p>handle my cd</p><p>i have all well i had</p><p>three different</p><p>things that i bought i</p><p>started out with a dat</p><p>player a dat</p><p>recorder i had</p><p>digital audio tape installed there</p><p>but the problem with that is that no one had a dat</p><p>player yeah</p><p>so then i said okay we&rsquo;ll get mini discs</p><p>because that seems like a good format but a problem</p><p>was mini disc died out sure so then i</p><p>switched it to cd</p><p>so so i put</p><p>three different</p><p>systems in there yeah</p><p>the cd and then you had all of like</p><p>those live moments that you</p><p>never really get on a comedy</p><p>album yeah i&rsquo;ll record it</p><p>at the comedy</p><p>store yeah it was perfect yeah</p><p>well you know it&rsquo;s just like</p><p>we needed to have it there and</p><p>there was a</p><p>budget issue</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p><p>at least the comedy</p><p>store appreciated</p><p>after you did all these nice</p><p>well mitzi did</p><p>the real comedy store did</p><p>you know that</p><p>was that was</p><p>where my loyalty was in the</p><p>first place now they</p><p>put it in a</p><p>kitchen over there</p><p>yeah good good good</p><p>place to get food poisoning</p><p>20 years too late</p><p>what the fuck</p><p>you know how many how much</p><p>money they lost for not having</p><p>just not chose</p><p>yeah but you know what dude is the comedy</p><p>story this was supposed to be</p><p>it the real</p><p>issue there was that they stopped</p><p>nurturing good comedy and they had a lot of this</p><p>the issues that</p><p>alan i were talking</p><p>about right before the show</p><p>that he&rsquo;s dealing with there right now</p><p>they don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>right intentions</p><p>they don&rsquo;t have they&rsquo;re not looking out for comedy</p><p>they&rsquo;re not even looking</p><p>out for the club anymore they&rsquo;re just looking out for</p><p>short dollars they&rsquo;re looking out for what&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna work and what&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna get the</p><p>money right now yeah</p><p>it&rsquo;s tough because i really i mean on</p><p>those friday and saturdays i remember</p><p>those i honestly</p><p>want some of the best</p><p>nights you were there for all of those</p><p>some of the best nights</p><p>that i&rsquo;ve ever had as a</p><p>comic that place</p><p>packed and it&rsquo;s like that old cops you were talking</p><p>about when you get that</p><p>150 to 200 seater</p><p>really packed it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p><p>great that was</p><p>a fun gig man because when i was doing fear factor</p><p>i i couldn&rsquo;t really travel</p><p>and so i just set up shop at the comedy</p><p>store and i set it up so that</p><p>i paid for everything i paid for the</p><p>sound system</p><p>i did i advertised</p><p>everything on myspace i</p><p>never asked for a time</p><p>pack the place</p><p>every weekend and work totally for free</p><p>yeah and when that was happening man</p><p>that was like</p><p>the most fun time ever for comedy for me you know</p><p>we had some good times in that</p><p>crazy weekends</p><p>crazy weekends</p><p>at least 10 times</p><p>i bought the entire audience&rsquo;s</p><p>shots oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>crazy at least</p><p>about times remember that the</p><p>whole audience</p><p>had shots whenever i</p><p>would kick somebody out</p><p>i would go look</p><p>i know that we just went through this douchey</p><p>moment together but we can change this we can get out</p><p>of this feeling i know this feels terrible we had some</p><p>drunk assholes yelling</p><p>things and they got kicked out</p><p>and everybody feels</p><p>weird like what the fuck man</p><p>you know and there&rsquo;s a few people</p><p>going well they paid to you know it&rsquo;s just stop</p><p>those are douchebags</p><p>right let&rsquo;s</p><p>we&rsquo;re not douchebags we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna change all this shit</p><p>so i would like to buy you guys a</p><p>drink everybody and</p><p>and you know kind of</p><p>bring the mood back and everybody</p><p>would cheer</p><p>and we&rsquo;d all wait i</p><p>would say that&rsquo;s the one</p><p>thing that we</p><p>gotta wait we</p><p>gotta wait and everybody waited man</p><p>every time we</p><p>never had an</p><p>issue with people</p><p>drinking their shots</p><p>early the waitresses they hustled they came</p><p>back and forth they had to do like fucking 10 15 trips</p><p>you know with big trays full of shots</p><p>but we gave shots to everybody that wanted them yeah</p><p>probably a few alcoholics fell off the wagon</p><p>but you guys</p><p>were like well fuck it man he&rsquo;s giving me a shot</p><p>i don&rsquo;t want to be a dick and</p><p>next thing he&rsquo;s</p><p>blacked out with his</p><p>pants down you know</p><p>a lot of people</p><p>shots for everybody but</p><p>that was a shitload</p><p>of people yeah</p><p>it was thousands of dollars</p><p>every time it wasn&rsquo;t shots</p><p>for everybody and there was 10 people there in the bar</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what</p><p>shots for everybody in a big fucking room</p><p>but it was you know and</p><p>it worked though it totally restored the vibe because</p><p>first of all everybody knew that i was paying for it so</p><p>you know it was</p><p>gonna cost real money</p><p>and you know</p><p>and it was just</p><p>all for the vibe to fix it</p><p>cause we can</p><p>you know all that was the</p><p>whole attitude</p><p>about it and that</p><p>should be the</p><p>attitude of comedy you know it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p><p>it&rsquo;s about getting into it and</p><p>finding you know finding what&rsquo;s fucking fun</p><p>about and taking everybody to what&rsquo;s fun</p><p>you know and when you</p><p>you have an opportunity to correct the vibe of the room</p><p>you know if</p><p>you can do it like that that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s all</p><p>about right</p><p>now you said you had</p><p>used to do a podcast like</p><p>five years ago when the podcast</p><p>first came out and</p><p>those were really big back in the day and they</p><p>kinda died and it was there</p><p>yeah there was like a podcast</p><p>you know it was four years ago i don&rsquo;t even know what</p><p>you know your own podcast</p><p>is called i did 17 episodes that&rsquo;s a lot</p><p>you think it&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>did a tv show 1994</p><p>only did six episodes yeah</p><p>i could tell you a lot about it it was um</p><p>it was we had sort of</p><p>many names for the thing but it was the</p><p>i would did it with</p><p>peter miriad a comedy writer and so it was just</p><p>he&rsquo;s half mexican and i&rsquo;m half mexican</p><p>and it was to</p><p>combine fulton</p><p>together you&rsquo;re</p><p>one mexican together we are one mexican</p><p>that would be a good name for it together one mexican</p><p>together we are one mexican and we</p><p>still don&rsquo;t speak spanish</p><p>you don&rsquo;t speak anything no not really it&rsquo;s horrible</p><p>beers must get mad at you yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>just like the allergies put me</p><p>it&rsquo;s in i&rsquo;m in a</p><p>weird spot with the big guy with the laker jersey</p><p>the big guys at the</p><p>lakers you know and that&rsquo;s my problem also was that the</p><p>in la they segment you when</p><p>i was working with joe in san francisco

it&rsquo;s an easy</p><p>little alien logo on the headphones you can</p><p>smoke em when</p><p>you&rsquo;re done listening</p><p>yeah right we could</p><p>store a stash like</p><p>there&rsquo;s an extra</p><p>battery area</p><p>to the show</p><p>would have a set of</p><p>those joe rogan</p><p>headphones that</p><p>would be weird that</p><p>would be step one of the cult</p><p>step one step two purple nikes step three</p><p>alien logo tattooed somewhere in your body step four</p><p>trying to empty</p><p>step five you embrace twitter</p><p>out of are you</p><p>are you addicted to it</p><p>you know what</p><p>i read a lot more than</p><p>i post just you like</p><p>someone&rsquo;s a lurker</p><p>i&rsquo;m not that much of a lurk</p><p>so tell me this</p><p>problem that you&rsquo;re having at the comedy</p><p>store they were talking about</p><p>well you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>i guess when you stay in one</p><p>place for too long you sort</p><p>of it&rsquo;s with your job or with anything else you just</p><p>start to realize that the people if you start</p><p>associating with the same people over and over</p><p>again sometimes you need to get a little negative</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s always been a real negative vibe there and</p><p>but the stage time is amazing</p><p>and we just were talking</p><p>about it&rsquo;s like running with weights on</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about we had some great times there</p><p>definitely working out there is</p><p>harder than working out anywhere else yeah i</p><p>think blaine compass</p><p>is a very funny comedian said</p><p>if this was if comedy codes were a video game</p><p>then the comedy</p><p>store would be one of the hardest</p><p>levels boss</p><p>level boss level and</p><p>then you&rsquo;d go like a la factory improv</p><p>and then when you get down easy</p><p>would be like the ucb</p><p>and all those</p><p>things because they&rsquo;re very very supportive and like</p><p>smart and everyone&rsquo;s paying attention</p><p>and at the comedy</p><p>store i have russian guys yelling out at you constantly</p><p>yeah but you know what though</p><p>the sad part</p><p>about that store is when it reveals its</p><p>true side when someone goes up who&rsquo;s not good and kills</p><p>someone goes up with some really dumb hacky shit when</p><p>they destroy that&rsquo;s</p><p>when you go</p><p>oh you guys aren&rsquo;t cool</p><p>you&rsquo;re just in the dark</p><p>that&rsquo;s what i was talking you&rsquo;re just</p><p>dummies in the dark</p><p>sort of makes you feel bad</p><p>about yourself when you go up and you</p><p>think you had a good set</p><p>and then just the worst</p><p>comic in the</p><p>world goes up</p><p>fucking two three</p><p>after you and just murders well you know</p><p>that&rsquo;s a symptom of what you were talking</p><p>about with like the</p><p>ucb well the</p><p>ucp is very well organized</p><p>they&rsquo;ve got a very</p><p>clear ethic</p><p>they&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>put out good</p><p>art they&rsquo;re trying to put out good comedy to support it</p><p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s very obvious what they&rsquo;re up to</p><p>and so because of that that&rsquo;s the kind of</p><p>crowd they attract</p><p>the comedy store is just people are just walking by</p><p>you know and they&rsquo;ve</p><p>heard the name</p><p>and they stumble in and they don&rsquo;t know any better or</p><p>they know who&rsquo;s the advertised you</p><p>know or it could be hey i&rsquo;ll</p><p>magical put it on twitter he&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be the comedy</p><p>store tonight let&rsquo;s go down and</p><p>check it out but</p><p>you get such a hodgepodge it is</p><p>it is like a vortex of</p><p>crazy people for whatever reason</p><p>crazy people are</p><p>drawn to that spot</p><p>like i don&rsquo;t</p><p>wanna believe in energy i don&rsquo;t</p><p>wanna believe in any of that fucking crystal sucking</p><p>astrological bullshit</p><p>i don&rsquo;t wanna believe in that i</p><p>wanna take things on face</p><p>value but if</p><p>ever there was a fucking there was some evidence</p><p>for a place having like</p><p>crazy energy and having like a weird</p><p>attraction to it</p><p>that fucking comedy</p><p>store was that man i&rsquo;m the same way i feel like</p><p>i don&rsquo;t believe in any of that crap</p><p>but if there was ever a</p><p>place for that</p><p>to exist it</p><p>would have to be something</p><p>weird just happened yeah maybe its</p><p>effects are over exaggerated like it&rsquo;s not the</p><p>only you can&rsquo;t only have shitty times at a</p><p>place like that but</p><p>you know when you find out the history of that</p><p>place and you know</p><p>it was bugsy seagulls nightclub</p><p>back in the</p><p>prohibition</p><p>days yeah we&rsquo;re still</p><p>heroes yeah they yeah</p><p>who said that eliza</p><p>yeah schlesinger</p><p>so they were doing abortions in the basement</p><p>but we always get in the subject</p><p>about how fucking</p><p>crazy that place is and how</p><p>creepy it is but they kill people there for sure and</p><p>maybe there&rsquo;s like a little shred of that is</p><p>still in the room it&rsquo;s no</p><p>funny bone you</p><p>know corporate</p><p>like comedy</p><p>club that&rsquo;s a little bit different than</p><p>those yeah there&rsquo;s no</p><p>animated microphone</p><p>with another microphone</p><p>standing in the back yeah</p><p>showing you who&rsquo;s coming up next week and</p><p>that&rsquo;s the other</p><p>thing when you get used to being in</p><p>other clubs</p><p>get used to like working for the improv</p><p>and you see how fucking organized they are</p><p>you know and they have posters of guys that are</p><p>gonna be there</p><p>next week and you know with supporting acts and they</p><p>show times and they have a you know online</p><p>where you can buy tickets it&rsquo;s all in the poster</p><p>and they&rsquo;re just like way in advance</p><p>you go to the</p><p>store there&rsquo;s a piece of</p><p>paper that fucking</p><p>tommy&rsquo;s got</p><p>spilled coffee on</p><p>you know and has everybody&rsquo;s name written on it</p><p>you know and</p><p>if you call in and you ask oh who&rsquo;s up tonight like</p><p>um um who&rsquo;s up</p><p>where&rsquo;s the fucking list</p><p>um

ha</p><p>cafe and he&rsquo;s another one of</p><p>these guys that&rsquo;s blatantly on purpose</p><p>looking to steal people&rsquo;s material and use it</p><p>but i have to be very clear and</p><p>i

of it but i don&rsquo;t know how many people</p><p>wanna watch it but i&rsquo;m surprised</p><p>like comics</p><p>mixed comedy and porno together yeah</p><p>well you know what&rsquo;s his face</p><p>thomas ward who does a fantastic</p><p>bill cosby bill cosby</p><p>was in a couple of porns</p><p>right cosby type</p><p>where he didn&rsquo;t</p><p>bang anybody but you know</p><p>he does his</p><p>acting in the</p><p>background thomas</p><p>ward is another one man i got that guy</p><p>introduced that guy to my manager</p><p>many many years ago</p><p>because i was</p><p>like this kid has got something he&rsquo;s like real raw</p><p>and he&rsquo;s got a good way of looking at</p><p>things and he&rsquo;s fucking just a natural on stage</p><p>but for whatever reason</p><p>just happened</p><p>didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t</p><p>click with him yeah</p><p>you know colleges</p><p>so goddamn tricky yeah</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s like you picked the</p><p>wrong wave you&rsquo;re not in the</p><p>right mindset</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re not</p><p>you can never really get your life in</p><p>order whatever the fuck it is that</p><p>keeps you from getting it right</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of guys that we know</p><p>you know holtzman&rsquo;s name</p><p>comes up all the time yeah but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just</p><p>allowing yourself not to get distracted</p><p>just staying on</p><p>point you know</p><p>holzman&rsquo;s kind of job that he works i</p><p>think he was a</p><p>mechanic for</p><p>aircraft at some point</p><p>yeah and so he&rsquo;s got all these</p><p>other life distractions and you got to be fucking on it</p><p>if you wanna go get something you</p><p>gotta be on it 100</p><p>and that&rsquo;s it and i</p><p>think these guys are half ass</p><p>and if they got themselves to a position of comfort</p><p>see that&rsquo;s what happens with any sort of fucking</p><p>dream is you get yourself to a</p><p>point you&rsquo;re like oh you</p><p>start sacrificing</p><p>it by compromising and you go oh i don&rsquo;t really need</p><p>fucking that</p><p>i&rsquo;m happy with this and you get just richard</p><p>reach the point</p><p>where you settled</p><p>you know you don&rsquo;t give a shit anymore</p><p>so just like i&rsquo;m cool with this this is a</p><p>great life right here</p><p>i can just fucking stop trying and i got this and</p><p>that&rsquo;s totally what i did man yeah when i was on news</p><p>radio did i i didn&rsquo;t</p><p>write anything</p><p>and here&rsquo;s one reason one of the</p><p>things that turned it around</p><p>i did sets and when i</p><p>would do these sets i would</p><p>basically do the same</p><p>fucking material</p><p>that i had had for years and years and years before</p><p>i would just go up on the weekends because it was</p><p>easy because it was something to do you know i</p><p>had this tv show</p><p>so i was doing the tv show all the time in the weekends</p><p>i&rsquo;d only been</p><p>in la a year i didn&rsquo;t really know that many people so</p><p>my social life was</p><p>going to the comedy clubs</p><p>so i would go up and i</p><p>would just do</p><p>the same act pretty much just over and over and over</p><p>again nobody knew who i was</p><p>i didn&rsquo;t have any responsibility i didn&rsquo;t have</p><p>any fans i had no responsibility to give them new shit</p><p>and i lost my feeling for it</p><p>like it wasn&rsquo;t real anymore to me</p><p>i wasn&rsquo;t in the comedy</p><p>mode for real</p><p>because i was just reiterating the same shit</p><p>and a few writers from the tv</p><p>show from newsradio came to see me at the comedy store</p><p>and i had a really late night set</p><p>it was really late</p><p>night in the main room</p><p>when you have</p><p>those late nights at the main room</p><p>the energy just gets sucked out of the room</p><p>where there&rsquo;s nothing</p><p>and i went on like next to last and i ate a dick</p><p>i just was i felt like</p><p>while i was saying it that what i was saying was</p><p>stupid and it just felt</p><p>empty to me i could feel</p><p>reciting the words yeah i</p><p>could feel them feeling bad for me</p><p>i could feel them</p><p>judging me and not liking what they see i just did not</p><p>have it i just wasn&rsquo;t in the groove and then i realized</p><p>i&rsquo;m like slacking like i&rsquo;m not really</p><p>writing i&rsquo;m not really performing i&rsquo;m putting any</p><p>effort into it for over a year</p><p>for maybe it</p><p>might have been two years</p><p>over a year at</p><p>least i just</p><p>would go up and do the same fucking</p><p>tired shit over and over again</p><p>but that bad set</p><p>made me completely refocus and then like within a year</p><p>i did my first cd</p><p>because i just</p><p>started going</p><p>crazy then i</p><p>would go to</p><p>stand up i would do it</p><p>every night i was doing it every</p><p>night i was doing it at the la factory and the improv</p><p>and i was just trying to get in as many sets as i</p><p>could and write as much new shit as i</p><p>could i just realized like you can&rsquo;t</p><p>just keep doing this anymore at some</p><p>point that goes off and then you&rsquo;re just trying to</p><p>i also try to</p><p>work new stuff in constantly</p><p>i&rsquo;m always adding just little</p><p>chunks here and there</p><p>not even a whole</p><p>new bit but just adding to the old shit that i have</p><p>right and always growing and</p><p>evolving that&rsquo;s</p><p>why i have a hard time putting out bits too quickly</p><p>like if you do something and then you know</p><p>you put it out you put out like a dvd</p><p>and the next year you want to do another one like louis</p><p>ck&rsquo;s doing which is</p><p>you know really</p><p>super ambitious but in my</p><p>like what&rsquo;s in my career like the</p><p>things that</p><p>i&rsquo;ve done they&rsquo;ve always gotten way way way better</p><p>as i kept doing them like over a long period of time</p><p>and sort of completely</p><p>tweaked them</p><p>and got them to the</p><p>place where</p><p>you know i have just the</p><p>right punch lines in the</p><p>right places the</p><p>right setup</p><p>the right think</p><p>about the right</p><p>material to do before you do it you know yeah i got an</p><p>album that i just put out and</p><p>i felt exactly the same way when i locked it</p><p>you&rsquo;re like oh shit</p><p>and a couple</p><p>jokes i&rsquo;m trying just not to do any of that</p><p>stuff anymore so i won&rsquo;t feel bad</p><p>about it right and just put it away</p><p>but yeah once i do it yeah i</p><p>think that&rsquo;s how you have to do it</p><p>bill bird on this</p><p>bill bird does that</p><p>what does he do he once he does it on tv or on an</p><p>album it goes bye bye</p><p>and just starts</p><p>fresh well that&rsquo;s the louis cqa</p><p>too that&rsquo;s what</p><p>louis&rsquo;s doing</p><p>you know and i think</p><p>i think you have to do that</p><p>if you really want</p><p>to keep moving there&rsquo;s no way you can just do the same</p><p>thing for it i&rsquo;ll do a few bits of</p><p>people call them out like when i do a q amp a sometimes</p><p>especially for</p><p>about a couple of cocktails</p><p>and i&rsquo;m prey on it but</p><p>you know that&rsquo;s</p><p>the hardest</p><p>part of our comedy is just to keep that momentum</p><p>going and keep finding out new and interesting</p><p>things to talk about</p><p>yeah you know</p><p>now it&rsquo;s tough</p><p>to you know just let</p><p>go no way if</p><p>it&rsquo;s so hard to stay</p><p>like grow attached to some bits to yeah</p><p>yeah man there&rsquo;s</p><p>some good one i</p><p>fucking love</p><p>my bit about</p><p>tigers fucking</p><p>i used to love doing it</p><p>i still love</p><p>everything about it was my my favorite bit of all time</p><p>but like all of them</p><p>put those bitches aside</p><p>there&rsquo;s gotta be shit</p><p>sorry make the</p><p>tough decision</p><p>put it behind you</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about how bill bird just</p><p>every single time he does something on tv</p><p>or on an album goes</p><p>gone just because</p><p>starts fresh</p><p>completely yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the george carlin way</p><p>you know george carlin</p><p>style of doing comedy louis ck</p><p>adopted it and bill burrs pretty much doing it too</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s the way to do it</p><p>just keep him keep</p><p>pounding out shit</p><p>just very hard to do when you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>other things as well yeah that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about earlier</p><p>when you do a</p><p>tv show and you&rsquo;re working a lot</p><p>and then cranking out i mean it&rsquo;s hard to you</p><p>gotta sleep</p><p>and shit too</p><p>yeah would you recommend comedy to people like</p><p>if your child wants to be a comic</p><p>would you say hey</p><p>i would recommend comedy</p><p>or would you</p><p>scare people away it&rsquo;s hard my son was already</p><p>asked what he</p><p>wants to be when he grows up and he looked at</p><p>a group of people and he goes</p><p>i just want to tell jokes</p><p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you recommend one of the</p><p>great jobs of all time</p><p>i mean i get to write i&rsquo;ve written for a couple of</p><p>other people you know and just i have a great time just</p><p>doing what i&rsquo;m doing you</p><p>seem to think that you wouldn&rsquo;t brian</p><p>you know what you&rsquo;re saying well</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know if i</p><p>would or wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>i do see just being in it how competitive</p><p>it is and how it really is hard to get to a certain</p><p>point of where you can survive</p><p>like higher up than</p><p>the normal comic</p><p>there&rsquo;s so many really good</p><p>comics but they seem like they all get to a certain</p><p>level and then they kind of balance off you</p><p>know where yeah they&rsquo;re making</p><p>money and stuff but a lot of them are</p><p>still kind of struggling here and there</p><p>but it seems like it&rsquo;s really hard to get to the next</p><p>level where you&rsquo;re just like</p><p>you know use the baseball</p><p>analogy or any pro football or anything like that any</p><p>sporting thing</p><p>is like you know certain amount of people get just</p><p>certain distance in the you know there&rsquo;s</p><p>levels of professional</p><p>and people just</p><p>climb up that</p><p>level of professional</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p><p>things to think</p><p>about because it&rsquo;s not just being a comedian</p><p>and being funny it&rsquo;s also the</p><p>marketing of yourself</p><p>which is very</p><p>alien from the creative aspect of</p><p>stand up comedy</p><p>so it&rsquo;s real tricky</p><p>like what gets you to the next</p><p>levels a lot of times</p><p>has nothing to do with your proficiency as a comedian</p><p>right you know there&rsquo;s a lot of comedians</p><p>that we know of that you know they&rsquo;re really good</p><p>they&rsquo;re really</p><p>solid but for whatever reason they</p><p>never enter into the oh you&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about brian</p><p>holzman yeah</p><p>for example the zeitgeist</p><p>never accepts them for whatever reason nothing</p><p>you know they</p><p>never figure out how to get</p><p>promoted correctly</p><p>and also they</p><p>sabotage your own career i mean</p><p>did you hear i remember i don&rsquo;t even know if i have the</p><p>story right but holtzman</p><p>jumping in martin lawrence came in the audience and</p><p>holtzman had people there to see him it was a big deal</p><p>and he was finally</p><p>gonna get a shot</p><p>and then martin lawrence&rsquo;s</p><p>bouncer came in and said something and yeah i guess</p><p>holzman just</p><p>looks and says fuck it and just jumps in and</p><p>i guess the</p><p>bouncer just knocks him</p><p>right out and fucking</p><p>flattens him</p><p>right in front of all</p><p>these people yeah</p><p>i think what was was martin lawrence was</p><p>heckling yeah</p><p>wow and brian</p><p>holzman was on</p><p>stage and martin lawrence was</p><p>heckling and martin lawrence went offstage and was good</p><p>saying ladies gentlemen this is martin lawrence can</p><p>you believe this i&rsquo;m getting hecked by martin lawrence</p><p>and the bouncer gets up and</p><p>punches him are you</p><p>serious serious yeah</p><p>he can&rsquo;t too</p><p>close to like</p><p>that yeah he has</p><p>stuff like that happens that</p><p>sucks i wish</p><p>tom leto would have</p><p>taken off if he had been around</p><p>agents and managers and</p><p>stuff too that&rsquo;s the</p><p>other thing about the</p><p>store no one&rsquo;s</p><p>going there to hang out because they have to pay</p><p>if you go to the improv</p><p>everybody gets in free</p><p>managers agents they&rsquo;re all hanging out there</p><p>it used to be an</p><p>issue to try to get people to come and</p><p>put them on the list to come see people</p><p>you know it&rsquo;d be hard people couldn&rsquo;t just</p><p>you know couldn&rsquo;t show</p><p>up hey a mic from ibm can we come in and see the show</p><p>yeah sure 20</p><p>bucks each bitch</p><p>when you&rsquo;re saying</p><p>about the marketing</p><p>thing it&rsquo;s also it&rsquo;s</p><p>that book that</p><p>malcolm gladwell book the outliers you ever see that</p><p>where it&rsquo;s very good</p><p>but it talks</p><p>about people not being able to express themselves like</p><p>there was a story of a</p><p>genius this kid was just i mean he went to iowa</p><p>state but his mom didn&rsquo;t turn in his</p><p>paperwork they were just sort</p><p>of dumb about</p><p>speaking to people</p><p>and this kid was there and didn&rsquo;t go talk to anybody</p><p>clearly they wanted him at the</p><p>school and what are</p><p>gonna keep him at the school</p><p>all he had to do was know to go and talk to somebody or</p><p>like people are just</p><p>socially unable</p><p>and how he didn&rsquo;t talk</p><p>to anybody so</p><p>school and he</p><p>does you know he&rsquo;s a manager somewhere does</p><p>this kid has</p><p>the guy has the man has the highest iq</p><p>almost imaginable</p><p>well there was some guy that got tested</p><p>for the highest iq ever</p><p>in america and he was a</p><p>bouncer he was a</p><p>bouncer in long island or something like that</p><p>and it was really</p><p>weird man cause he was</p><p>like really kind of full of himself a bit and like we</p><p>would talk about</p><p>things he would talk</p><p>about things like really pompous</p><p>and you&rsquo;re just</p><p>gonna go hey back the fuck up you&rsquo;re a</p><p>bouncer dude like</p><p>if you&rsquo;re so</p><p>smart and fucking</p><p>smug about everything</p><p>what are you out there</p><p>swimming in the</p><p>human condition</p><p>every day as a bouncer</p><p>getting to know the dark side of humanity</p><p>are you a fucking charles bukowski poet type character</p><p>or are you the</p><p>smartest man in the</p><p>world cause something there&rsquo;s a</p><p>disconnect there fella</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re living</p><p>life like a dummy</p><p>not not that</p><p>bouncers are</p><p>dummies i know a lot of guys that are</p><p>bouncers like him and</p><p>they guys good job</p><p>a lot of power and</p><p>bouncers yeah you get</p><p>power and you do don&rsquo;t do shit</p><p>yeah but i mean why</p><p>would you do that if you&rsquo;re a fucking</p><p>super genius and you&rsquo;re like</p><p>forty all right you know it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s some</p><p>twenty year old kid paying for his college education</p><p>need some money on the weekends no</p><p>fucking forty year old</p><p>genius character working as a</p><p>bouncer okay</p><p>his services</p><p>should be used</p><p>elsewhere totally like if he&rsquo;s that fucking</p><p>smart like that&rsquo;s getting working on</p><p>your socially there&rsquo;s the needs</p><p>social intelligence</p><p>needs to be</p><p>factored into the</p><p>whole idea of intelligence</p><p>you know your iq does not include your ability to</p><p>fucking maneuver around</p><p>human beings that&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about and then a</p><p>similar kid with a big upgrade you know</p><p>really wealthy upbringing that had the same iq</p><p>went you know that many times further</p><p>in his life and became just great</p><p>you know i had a friend</p><p>when i was living in new york who was a pool hustler</p><p>and he was a brilliant guy</p><p>not just socially he&rsquo;s like he had</p><p>a brilliant mathematical mind as well but he was the</p><p>first guy that i had ever met socially</p><p>that would look for traits</p><p>in someone look for</p><p>things that people are doing look for ego things</p><p>he could do</p><p>impressions of people like really good</p><p>impressions of them they</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t sound like the person but it</p><p>would be exactly the type of shit that that person</p><p>would say because he&rsquo;s always</p><p>analyzing people&rsquo;s</p><p>personalities and looking for weaknesses</p><p>i did not know</p><p>until i met</p><p>this guy that people were out there that did that that</p><p>would look for a weakness</p><p>in your game look for weakness in how you talk</p><p>look for a weakness in how you behave</p><p>and then they find that little spot and that&rsquo;s</p><p>where they start picking you</p><p>start picking on whatever got you to say that in the</p><p>first place</p><p>whatever got you to</p><p>stand up for</p><p>yourself whatever got you to make an excuse</p><p>about something that happened</p><p>yeah it was kind of sick that day normally that</p><p>would never go</p><p>down like that oh really yeah normally you&rsquo;re the best</p><p>right the best ever</p><p>like you would just find the spot find whatever it was</p><p>and just start picking</p><p>his opportunity</p><p>yeah they&rsquo;re out there man fuck yeah they&rsquo;re</p><p>out there man but that&rsquo;s a lot of what comedy is too</p><p>it&rsquo;s finding that little that little spot</p><p>seeing that little</p><p>thing that other people</p><p>might not have saw</p><p>now it&rsquo;s and then also</p><p>getting that out and reflecting that in a creative way</p><p>that it has not really been done before</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>fucking go regurgitate some of the old yeah</p><p>tired shit i know so it</p><p>it&rsquo;s also like there&rsquo;s a couple rules in</p><p>place where not only have you had that thought and</p><p>found that opportunity but now you&rsquo;ve</p><p>got to put this through this filtering process to</p><p>determine whether</p><p>or not it&rsquo;s okay to fucking make it up on stage</p><p>and then there&rsquo;s the saying it the right way and</p><p>you know figuring out the best</p><p>economy of words</p><p>there&rsquo;s like a lyrical aspect to it at that</p><p>point so now you&rsquo;re fucking</p><p>putting shit together like</p><p>you know i try to do that a lot</p><p>in my act when i&rsquo;m talking about actually</p><p>tell that whole banana cry story</p><p>on stage as a bit</p><p>and leading into it and i said this by</p><p>the way i don&rsquo;t believe that you didn&rsquo;t get jerked off</p><p>just want you to know i love you but</p><p>i&rsquo;m maria keep saying what you said you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>to say anything keep going</p><p>okay go ahead so</p><p>the banana cry</p><p>lady i goes this is not the</p><p>first time i</p><p>found myself in english as the</p><p>second language sexy talk situation</p><p>you know and so i say shit like that so this</p><p>has to come out like it can</p><p>be lyrical at the same time you can use alliteration</p><p>and fuck around with it from there so then you</p><p>gotta put it through all</p><p>these steps and then it finally makes it out</p><p>and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re</p><p>tough to give up</p><p>yeah i know</p><p>they&rsquo;re like</p><p>babies hard yeah</p><p>they like your</p><p>babies man so</p><p>when she get good at them and get them all tight</p><p>and you know exactly how to hit them and they have all</p><p>these fucking</p><p>punch lines one</p><p>after the other</p><p>bang bang bang bang bang bang</p><p>you know that was the boston</p><p>style of comedy to boston</p><p>the the best guys for whatever reason</p><p>didn&rsquo;t really</p><p>write new material</p><p>they just had a gang of</p><p>stuff that was</p><p>so devastating</p><p>yeah like if you want there&rsquo;s</p><p>still guys like</p><p>that you just go out and just they&rsquo;re just</p><p>crushing yeah</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s guys like that</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to do now though</p><p>because of the internet it&rsquo;s just not the same thing</p><p>you know when people and</p><p>these guys didn&rsquo;t have cds out so</p><p>people couldn&rsquo;t go and replay</p><p>their bits you had to go see it again</p><p>you know you couldn&rsquo;t play it over and over</p><p>again so it&rsquo;s like you know you know the</p><p>exact timing for when the</p><p>punch line comes and yeah it&rsquo;s not like that</p><p>people are still</p><p>going out though i mean yeah</p><p>comedy still the most fun</p><p>thing for me to go see</p><p>you know if i know that stanhope&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna perform or you know</p><p>the louis ck&rsquo;s in</p><p>town or you know nick apollo or someone that i really</p><p>think is really</p><p>funny i fucking have a great time</p><p>still the most fun</p><p>thing to see who were you saying

a</p><p>out of a homeless guy and he&rsquo;s got like you know a</p><p>bunch of shit plan that he can say like that and so</p><p>this became an internet</p><p>thing it got huge and then from it</p><p>this guy gets a</p><p>bunch of different job offers so now he&rsquo;s on</p><p>dr phil and so what happened</p><p>dr phil sits down with him and discusses</p><p>all the challenges he had in

crazy man</p><p>yep yeah that&rsquo;s a new thing man</p><p>who was the first internet celebrity like going back</p><p>justin bieber&rsquo;s like the best</p><p>one right no no i mean first like ten years</p><p>first 15 years ago like was there an aol</p><p>celebrity back in the day well when youtube</p><p>first started was the history of the</p><p>dance guy became one of the ones that was the</p><p>first youtube sensation really to</p><p>start commanding high dollar</p><p>right for the</p><p>goatsy guy was the from most famous guy on the internet</p><p>the go to guy yeah</p><p>his but i wonder who that guy is i mean you know that</p><p>it&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got his butthole</p><p>face in the camera is wearing a wedding ring</p><p>and he&rsquo;s stretching his asshole out</p><p>like pulling it like it&rsquo;s rubber</p><p>yeah it depends</p><p>peering into the darkness into the event</p><p>horizon of his butthole</p><p>and it&rsquo;s you</p><p>know an internet meme it&rsquo;s been on a million different</p><p>things it&rsquo;s all over the place yeah</p><p>people make</p><p>photoshops of it in in</p><p>cloud patterns and shit it&rsquo;ll make your banana cry</p><p>but no seriously if you think of like the first real</p><p>legit celebrity that was made off of the internet it&rsquo;s</p><p>tequila it&rsquo;s pretty yeah</p><p>tequila is a perfect one</p><p>she&rsquo;s straight you know</p><p>just right from the internet nothing but right</p><p>you&rsquo;ve got mail she actually</p><p>might have been the first no no no there has to i mean</p><p>you&rsquo;re talking about like</p><p>seven years ago i&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about like the internet came out a long ass time</p><p>right but there was no one like tequila</p><p>tequila that made</p><p>their way into the public and became well we</p><p>never had a video</p><p>like that before</p><p>and social networks yeah i&rsquo;m just</p><p>thinking about the internet had</p><p>was always a spot for celebrity</p><p>to go like i used to look up</p><p>like some of the celebrities have</p><p>brothers and shit like that and there&rsquo;s like rickie</p><p>leach revolta</p><p>john travolta&rsquo;s brother</p><p>and so he has</p><p>a website and i was like there was a lot of</p><p>funny shit on it</p><p>back then but</p><p>nothing like there is now with the content and the</p><p>audio there&rsquo;s a</p><p>sound you can go to</p><p>soundcloud and youtube i mean</p><p>people are putting up nobody had the devices</p><p>either nobody had flip</p><p>video cameras and so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a whole new</p><p>age of when you introduce the</p><p>small camera that&rsquo;s one</p><p>and easy to upload with the uc</p><p>usb connector might</p><p>just right in immediately hd</p><p>phones and so</p><p>you didn&rsquo;t have to have that</p><p>technology available</p><p>to just a regular guy so now that they</p><p>it&rsquo;s easier to launch a login</p><p>video and look how</p><p>when she goes</p><p>viral i mean a lot of people are talking about</p><p>the voice yeah yeah</p><p>and antoine thompson</p><p>that&rsquo;s a lot of fucking</p><p>money to buy your mama</p><p>house i don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s in alabama</p><p>well yeah it was really</p><p>because of that song</p><p>those guys who created that</p><p>that auto tune song</p><p>guys are very talented musicians</p><p>sure and then</p><p>just auto tune i mean auto tunes fucking hilarious</p><p>every time yeah you</p><p>heard carl sagan&rsquo;s auto

putting</p><p>these mufflers on</p><p>oh yeah woo woo</p><p>yeah and they go down and it&rsquo;s</p><p>local news auto tune for that so that&rsquo;s hilarious</p><p>it&rsquo;s all anything auto</p><p>tuning the news is funny</p><p>yeah can&rsquo;t deny</p><p>it i think garageband&rsquo;s pretty amazing too</p><p>the program</p><p>where you can pretty much</p><p>make your own song</p><p>pretty easily</p><p>don&rsquo;t they have programs like that for your phone now</p><p>oh yeah yeah</p><p>absolutely absolutely</p><p>like there was i don&rsquo;t know if we ever talked</p><p>about there was this</p><p>back in the day in myspace somebody linked</p><p>one of my songs on their</p><p>myspace page and like</p><p>stole it from my web host</p><p>so like when he went to the myspace page it</p><p>automatically played a song from your show from myself</p><p>so i what i did is i took</p><p>that file took it down</p><p>and then made up a</p><p>quick song and garage band</p><p>about like oh</p><p>stacy from you</p><p>know hollywood california</p><p>i want you to suck my dick and made a</p><p>whole song just</p><p>about how i wanted to fuck this girl

that&rsquo;s</p><p>great yeah and</p><p>i just love i don&rsquo;t know how</p><p>i even thought</p><p>about that but</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p><p>funny video</p><p>that&rsquo;s funny when

some</p><p>double arp meeting</p><p>and they&rsquo;re all in my business and</p><p>at one point</p><p>i had three cars i</p><p>still have three cars</p><p>right now and</p><p>then i have i got gm was

colorado</p><p>it was the perfect</p><p>place for me oh</p><p>when i was driving up it was like this is how you do it</p><p>i have old people on my shed</p><p>and then also you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s sort of a little gangy</p><p>ish sometimes so</p><p>like somebody will ride a mini</p><p>truck will go</p><p>you know down the street</p><p>and you have that guy like driving by with</p><p>really fast you</p><p>worry about that with your kids the gang you part</p><p>well it&rsquo;s not</p><p>it&rsquo;s gang adjacent</p><p>it&rsquo;s not really gang</p><p>adjacent it&rsquo;s not</p><p>right in the shit</p><p>but it&rsquo;s close</p><p>enough where it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna become an</p><p>issue in their life if they</p><p>walk on well yeah</p><p>you can definitely</p><p>stumble down to the</p><p>wrong area and just get</p><p>anywhere you can get caught at the</p><p>wrong time but here it&rsquo;s highly unlikely</p><p>you know i mean</p><p>i have a more realistic chance of running into</p><p>some bad people in my neighborhood</p><p>yeah hmm and yeah i worry</p><p>about my wife being</p><p>alone when i go to</p><p>stand up and shit like that all the time yeah</p><p>yeah i know that feeling</p><p>and even with</p><p>household shit if anything</p><p>breaks you know we&rsquo;ve had</p><p>stuff where i&rsquo;ve been on the road doing</p><p>stand up i travel all over</p><p>just like not as much but</p><p>i go out a fair amount</p><p>and yeah my wife&rsquo;s home with two kids and luckily</p><p>you know we got filipino</p><p>frank there</p><p>so tell me how what&rsquo;s your issues with</p><p>your war oh let&rsquo;s try to come and trim my shit like</p><p>you know how you have</p><p>hedges yeah my dog was running out and barking the</p><p>other day and my neighbor was</p><p>secretly trying to trim my fucking hedge</p><p>why was he trimming your head just</p><p>old and drunk and</p><p>crazy like just wasted</p><p>did you talk to him</p><p>no i they put it

that but</p><p>that&rsquo;s how i feel</p><p>i like they will get all pissed been out of</p><p>shape if i&rsquo;m</p><p>not talking to a neighbor for two years because</p><p>over parking</p><p>we had construction people over our</p><p>house and the</p><p>latino guys parked there</p><p>and he came running back to the old guy</p><p>and fucking</p><p>started yelling at the</p><p>latino guys to move</p><p>their car it&rsquo;s a public street</p><p>anybody can fucking park there i&rsquo;m at war</p><p>yeah i won&rsquo;t even talk to the fucking guys</p><p>suburban war</p><p>really is people</p><p>claim their</p><p>turf and the real</p><p>issue is people are not supposed</p><p>to be on top of each other like</p><p>they really</p><p>this is nothing compared to</p><p>apartments man</p><p>apartments are where it&rsquo;s really bright on top of each</p><p>other i had an</p><p>apartment in north hollywood</p><p>where i had a pool table</p><p>okay and i lived on the second</p><p>floor and there was this</p><p>crazy gay couple that lives in the</p><p>first floor and he was like the landlord to</p><p>the what is it called the the</p><p>super intent</p><p>so you know he was always</p><p>controlling things and</p><p>he didn&rsquo;t own the building but he ran it</p><p>so i had a pool table</p><p>installed in my living room i had a big living room</p><p>and the reason</p><p>why i got this big living room was because i</p><p>could get a pool</p><p>table i wanted a pool</p><p>table in the living room</p><p>so i had installed then he comes</p><p>knocking on the door</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on in there there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of movement there&rsquo;s a lot of movement up here</p><p>and i go oh i got a pool</p><p>table he goes</p><p>are you jumping</p><p>around are you working out or something i go no no no</p><p>i&rsquo;m just walking around the pool looking</p><p>for it look in as</p><p>he&rsquo;s talking making shots</p><p>and he goes okay i&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna have to ask you to not do that</p><p>when i&rsquo;m home</p><p>because it&rsquo;s</p><p>just like i&rsquo;m in the living room and all i hear is</p><p>creek creek</p><p>creek creek</p><p>creek creek</p><p>and i&rsquo;m like so you&rsquo;re saying that because of the</p><p>structural instability of this shithead fucking</p><p>apartment building</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want me walking</p><p>in my living room because it&rsquo;s annoying</p><p>yeah i started</p><p>changing my wireless password</p><p>it&rsquo;s cause they&rsquo;re</p><p>right on top of you right</p><p>right so everybody in my so i</p><p>changed my wireless</p><p>now my network name</p><p>i can change</p><p>it to anything i want</p><p>right so i put like ouija</p><p>lawn yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>hilarious i</p><p>changed my network</p><p>and then they looked on and they were like hey</p><p>we link sis</p><p>or fucking weed</p><p>your lawn hey</p><p>hey hey son</p><p>of a bitch yeah quit</p><p>trimming my fucking hedges</p><p>oh that&rsquo;s great i</p><p>like that that&rsquo;s</p><p>funny they try to</p><p>steal off your fucking wireless yeah</p><p>yeah man that&rsquo;s</p><p>creepy when you have neighborhoods man there&rsquo;s always</p><p>that one kid that lives down the brock that&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>steal your fucking shit when</p><p>you&rsquo;re not looking yeah</p><p>it was someone has some</p><p>troubled 16 year old</p><p>troubled youth walking around always man</p><p>my friend of mine got his fucking bike stolen</p><p>some fucking kid down the</p><p>street i saw this kid</p><p>just walking up the</p><p>block just walking up</p><p>just you know just looking around not doing i was like</p><p>where&rsquo;s that guy fucking</p><p>going you know</p><p>he&rsquo;s walking up</p><p>right but he&rsquo;s</p><p>first of all in la very few people without a dog</p><p>walking and i don&rsquo;t have you know</p><p>chicks have lululemon</p><p>on or something like that and you know they&rsquo;re</p><p>dressed in outfits</p><p>when you see just a lone fucking thug</p><p>it&rsquo;s like seeing an ant</p><p>just away from the rest</p><p>of it so important to live in a nice spot</p><p>it&rsquo;s really important to live in a</p><p>quiet spot just try to find a</p><p>quiet nice spot and that&rsquo;s why so many people</p><p>go to the suburbs yeah like you go to</p><p>downtown cleveland it&rsquo;s shut down there&rsquo;s nothing there</p><p>every single</p><p>store is released</p><p>and shit like that i couldn&rsquo;t find a department</p><p>store my wife</p><p>sometimes helps me pack</p><p>no underwear</p><p>so i go to buy</p><p>underwear in downtown cleveland</p><p>not a department</p><p>store no it&rsquo;s like</p><p>walgreens or</p><p>brooks brothers that&rsquo;s the only</p><p>scary little</p><p>things that they had</p><p>cleveland&rsquo;s weird</p><p>yeah because everybody</p><p>moved out to a</p><p>quieter place</p><p>you know what it is yeah</p><p>what&rsquo;s also</p><p>the jobs disappeared</p><p>right you know what happened with well</p><p>well plants got shut down or something yeah and detroit</p><p>you know people went south</p><p>went to columbus and cincinnati</p><p>because just i mean</p><p>cleveland used to be</p><p>the biggest</p><p>city in ohio</p><p>it used to be like the flats it used to be the</p><p>place to be</p><p>the cool part of ohio</p><p>now it&rsquo;s scary they were</p><p>gonna impromp</p><p>down there that&rsquo;s a real dump yeah</p><p>even one i think</p><p>they did it once</p><p>well they have</p><p>they just gave out so many passes they</p><p>completely ruined</p><p>the room that&rsquo;s what a lot of comedy clubs</p><p>do is that just</p><p>the quality they&rsquo;re just giving out passing</p><p>so you have</p><p>free passes</p><p>so the tickets are free so they&rsquo;re selling booze</p><p>and the tickets have no</p><p>value a lot of</p><p>places believe that they&rsquo;re in the liquor business not</p><p>the comedy business and they just want people inside</p><p>drinking so well</p><p>i see their</p><p>point man you gotta</p><p>keep the fucking</p><p>wolves away sure</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s like for a lot of these</p><p>places like in the middle of nowhere it&rsquo;s real hard and</p><p>a lot of the</p><p>comics that are getting</p><p>shipped down there are terrible yeah</p><p>how many times have you like been in a club</p><p>and you look at the lineup and be like what do you got</p><p>going on here</p><p>and you read</p><p>their calendar and you&rsquo;re like oh shit jesus</p><p>fuck and you just imagine</p><p>these poor people having to come and sit and</p><p>watch this some kid told me a quote that</p><p>i was working with he said he was at a show</p><p>and this comic was so bad some old</p><p>black lady yells out</p><p>you&rsquo;re ruining my free passes</p><p>oh my god that was the best talking with</p><p>thing that sums</p><p>everything else</p><p>hilarious you&rsquo;re ruining my free passes</p><p>that&rsquo;s hilarious i got this for free and i hate it</p><p>this is horrible</p><p>that&rsquo;s so funny and that&rsquo;s why a lot of</p><p>people get you know when you&rsquo;re</p><p>a comedy promoter you do free beer</p><p>like there&rsquo;s</p><p>always got to be something else that will justify</p><p>and i can move</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p><p>tough fucking business man</p><p>any sort of bar restaurant business own a pool hall</p><p>anything like that night</p><p>night time business</p><p>those fucking</p><p>things are hard man</p><p>and when times are</p><p>tough like they are now</p><p>the economy gets shitty</p><p>and then it&rsquo;s</p><p>becomes you know like then they really don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>go out they want to take a chance to just go see comedy</p><p>you know if you know they know someone is</p><p>going to be there you know</p><p>bill burrs in town okay let&rsquo;s go see</p><p>him you know i know who he is stan help has that joke</p><p>that he&rsquo;s just</p><p>like how many people are</p><p>here to see me how many people are here to see comedy</p><p>and then half of them reply</p><p>and it&rsquo;s like</p><p>don&rsquo;t do that</p><p>with anything else you don&rsquo;t goes roll into you know</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s also</p><p>you know i&rsquo;ve said this before but i&rsquo;ll say it again</p><p>the real problem is the generic</p><p>label comedy</p><p>it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t go to see live</p><p>music in not knowing if you&rsquo;re gonna get</p><p>barry manilow</p><p>or guns n roses or you know a rap band you</p><p>know but with comedy you</p><p>could get that</p><p>and you could get that on the same</p><p>night you can get</p><p>like five different comments can go out at the improv</p><p>and they all have five different</p><p>totally different acts and sure</p><p>yeah john reap</p><p>and eddie griffin</p><p>maybe yeah exactly</p><p>the polar opposites bob ozark</p><p>you know just these</p><p>drastic different</p><p>you know bob</p><p>ozark can&rsquo;t call into the</p><p>store anymore</p><p>really yeah</p><p>they told him he&rsquo;s too old why are you</p><p>serious but yet</p><p>then his want what&rsquo;s his name</p><p>still can go there every day</p><p>he&rsquo;s got his thing</p><p>wow yep yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s</p><p>a very funny comedy writer and a very</p><p>funny comedian i mean you just look him up he&rsquo;s</p><p>incredible and also when you</p><p>sit and listen to guy like</p><p>that is a perfect talk about alliteration and the</p><p>story and i mean just</p><p>he&rsquo;s a great character top notch yeah</p><p>he would be a great talk show host</p><p>he was i think for a while that&rsquo;s when he</p><p>moved to florida and he was working on one of</p><p>those good morning shows as the what was he doing this</p><p>he moved away from la i&rsquo;d say</p><p>three years ago really and once you go</p><p>you can type in bob o&rsquo;shack on youtube and see</p><p>him as morning correspondent</p><p>wow and so that fell</p><p>apart and it was</p><p>a big gig and they just</p><p>moved back to los angeles yeah so bob</p><p>ozark in the morning or whatever do you have kids</p><p>yeah he has two kids</p><p>about the same age as mine you know in that</p><p>eight and four range</p><p>i can&rsquo;t believe it tell him not to get spots</p><p>did he play david letterman in that old</p><p>movie about no no no but he always he has this look</p><p>about him like</p><p>where he really looks like a</p><p>young dave letterman you know</p><p>voted by oprah</p><p>to be one of the top</p><p>speaking of oprah</p><p>and we were talking</p><p>about that&rsquo;s how we first met</p><p>over some old oprahs</p><p>watching well we did</p><p>stand up together and we went up to my house</p><p>just sat there baked</p><p>11 years ago</p><p>watching old oprah footage yeah we were doing bong hits</p><p>in al magical&rsquo;s couch</p><p>watching oprah from like the 80s</p><p>when she had big hair and shit do you</p><p>think she&rsquo;s rich</p><p>or did she have plastic surgery what&rsquo;s happening</p><p>right now why</p><p>just sitting there</p><p>and i think there were people around us</p><p>but me and you were just sitting</p><p>watching the</p><p>opera like there was a little</p><p>bit of a gathering and people were talking is your</p><p>brother and i</p><p>think you&rsquo;re your wife</p><p>before she was your wife and</p><p>some other but</p><p>one other person</p><p>a couple of people and she</p><p>would just go</p><p>completely focused on this old oprah</p><p>and we were barbecued</p><p>and you know how when something you barbecued something</p><p>like all of a</p><p>sudden like</p><p>why have i never seen it like this before</p><p>it was so strange it was like we were</p><p>watching like an alien film</p><p>it didn&rsquo;t even look real anyway o shak</p><p>was on oprah</p><p>and touted as one of the next</p><p>great communities</p><p>and nobody knows comedy like that bitch</p><p>it&rsquo;s what a whole new network&rsquo;s</p><p>about watch out comedy central yeah own girl</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s like the white version of def jam what</p><p>so nothing on</p><p>those shacks you find</p><p>we don&rsquo;t have to pull them over it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t matter that&rsquo;s</p><p>right it&rsquo;s just another one of those stories</p><p>you know there&rsquo;s another story it&rsquo;s</p><p>been the interesting thing about being</p><p>a comedian and living in la is watching</p><p>the whole story of</p><p>humanity unfold for many different</p><p>people and many different players and they all just you</p><p>know they take</p><p>their part in</p><p>the game and they all go through it and you get to</p><p>watch them and</p><p>a lot of them you get to</p><p>learn from too just</p><p>learn from their fuck ups and</p><p>learn from them you</p><p>can sort of pick</p><p>the path that you want to go it&rsquo;s like choose your own</p><p>adventures like am i</p><p>gonna be like that dude</p><p>or am i gonna end up like that dude</p><p>and then you get to go</p><p>am i gonna go into the cave am i</p><p>gonna choose to go to</p><p>space like you have to make choices</p><p>along the way</p><p>and if you fuck up</p><p>then you might go off in some</p><p>other positive direction</p><p>but not necessarily i mean there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of choices to be made i&rsquo;ve been on</p><p>like i was talking about</p><p>on function six</p><p>pilots or something like that at this</p><p>point since i&rsquo;ve</p><p>taught you know we&rsquo;ve met</p><p>and not one of them is really</p><p>taken off it&rsquo;s been</p><p>weird and one of them</p><p>could have taken off immediately</p><p>yeah you can end up like you</p><p>could get super</p><p>duper lucky</p><p>and not to see we&rsquo;re</p><p>lucky at all</p><p>i was lucky</p><p>news radio look there&rsquo;s</p><p>no doubt i was</p><p>lucky the first two</p><p>things i ever auditioned for i got</p><p>the first two shows</p><p>i didn&rsquo;t go on</p><p>a bunch of auditions like a lot of actors</p><p>i auditioned for one</p><p>thing when i</p><p>was living in new york i got it came out to california</p><p>that got cancelled</p><p>i auditioned for newsradio i got that bam</p><p>no acting experience at all</p><p>it&rsquo;s total luck</p><p>there&rsquo;s no getting away from it</p><p>it was just i was in the</p><p>right place at the right time</p><p>when they were looking for</p><p>stand ups on sitcoms</p><p>that&rsquo;s all it is so it&rsquo;s a lot of luck</p><p>you know i could have had the same</p><p>thing as you</p><p>could have been six different</p><p>pilots and nothing happened or</p><p>could have been one and and ray</p><p>romano actually had that part</p><p>before you talked</p><p>to newsradio yeah yeah</p><p>he had it but i didn&rsquo;t take</p><p>it from him i took it from the guy who took it from him</p><p>aha that&rsquo;s even better they decided somewhere</p><p>along the line that they were</p><p>gonna go some in some different direction</p><p>and you know meanwhile it turned out to be the</p><p>greatest thing ever for ray</p><p>romano fuck news</p><p>radio ray romano</p><p>made like 800</p><p>million dollars or something we saw him the</p><p>other night did</p><p>you know him yeah</p><p>no real well yeah and he was</p><p>seem like he&rsquo;s incredibly humble and</p><p>cool he&rsquo;s a very cool guy he&rsquo;s as down to</p><p>earth as possible he hasn&rsquo;t</p><p>changed at all he&rsquo;s the same guy</p><p>and he was talking</p><p>about something that i can totally relate to too when</p><p>we were at the taping of paul preventes&rsquo;s green room</p><p>he did it the</p><p>night before i did it</p><p>and by the way kitties</p><p>i had a conversation with mark mayer and we&rsquo;re both</p><p>gonna do each</p><p>other&rsquo;s podcasts yeah i think</p><p>there&rsquo;s no real beef there yeah</p><p>this is a big twitter issue</p><p>but so anyway</p><p>he yeah people keep</p><p>asking me to do it whatever</p><p>that&rsquo;s right with the</p><p>other thing i don&rsquo;t want any</p><p>beefs i hear you</p><p>oh i hear it&rsquo;s distracting it&rsquo;s a</p><p>waste of time that&rsquo;s all it is a</p><p>waste of time and you really</p><p>think about a</p><p>pride and shit like that it&rsquo;s like shut up</p><p>what a who yeah</p><p>just go to work you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s like the world</p><p>want to do my shit yeah</p><p>i hear you i&rsquo;m</p><p>exactly the same way</p><p>anyway ray romano was talking</p><p>about how you</p><p>know you know</p><p>even after all</p><p>these years</p><p>i do these shortly</p><p>it sounds like</p><p>kermit the frog</p><p>he said even</p><p>after he does</p><p>all these years and he goes to</p><p>shows the mirage in</p><p>vegas or wherever he goes</p><p>and you know</p><p>massive fucking</p><p>crowd he said he</p><p>still feels like a</p><p>fraud imposter</p><p>yeah he feels like when he gets</p><p>stepping out there that all</p><p>these people are sure i</p><p>think he goes i</p><p>think at any moment we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna just turn around and just</p><p>point a finger at me and go you&rsquo;re a dick</p><p>we don&rsquo;t really like you yeah</p><p>yeah you know</p><p>and that is what it feels like it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a weird</p><p>thing like as yeah</p><p>you know i do comedy all</p><p>these years and you</p><p>know and people are there to see you and they&rsquo;re all</p><p>psyched up and they&rsquo;re</p><p>cheering when they&rsquo;re</p><p>bringing your name and as you&rsquo;re walking to the</p><p>stage you&rsquo;re like what the fuck am i even</p><p>doing tom papa told me</p><p>great stories</p><p>about that like</p><p>he&rsquo;d worked to sell out comedy clubs and he</p><p>started selling out some comedy</p><p>clubs and then he</p><p>moved to the</p><p>smaller theaters</p><p>and then as a guy in a</p><p>smaller theater he didn&rsquo;t take</p><p>a moment to go this is it i&rsquo;m in the</p><p>smaller theater</p><p>he started thinking</p><p>about getting</p><p>in bigger theaters like that was really like</p><p>we fill in this one</p><p>okay we&rsquo;re filling this theater</p><p>and then we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna move to a bigger theater you know</p><p>if he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied</p><p>right with the little theater</p><p>yeah where i&rsquo;m</p><p>thinking oh my god if i can</p><p>get to a theater i don&rsquo;t give a shit what size it is</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s like the jump off</p><p>point yeah for comics</p><p>so you always want aspire to get her</p><p>yeah exactly</p><p>theaters are a lot of work</p><p>though man sure it&rsquo;s a lot of work to try to sell them</p><p>unless you got this</p><p>giant following you know</p><p>i was on the road with mitch hedberg and he</p><p>told a story</p><p>about him and</p><p>lynn trying to</p><p>think they could do a theater on their own</p><p>and they didn&rsquo;t need a promoter</p><p>and it was sold out at this comedy club forever</p><p>and they were just</p><p>gonna try to</p><p>do it and he said it was an absolute disaster</p><p>really like</p><p>half full lost</p><p>money or barely</p><p>broke even well they</p><p>probably didn&rsquo;t have the internet</p><p>in full effect no not</p><p>all mitch hedberg&rsquo;s</p><p>website was bunk it was like like looked like</p><p>somebody put it together out of netscape</p><p>navigation that</p><p>build a

in dallas is</p><p>actually really fucking nice and beautiful</p><p>not like that not like the</p><p>place of the old</p><p>there&rsquo;s a tricky</p><p>thing man with old dudes man old dudes like</p><p>they get taken at trip clubs all the time</p><p>you know they become like</p><p>a part of the landscape</p><p>when eddie bravo used to be a dj</p><p>at his trip club i used to go and</p><p>visit him of course he was</p><p>and for years</p><p>for like 10 years it&rsquo;s awesome and i&rsquo;ll go and</p><p>visit him at work and he had</p><p>like you get to know the ecosystem of the</p><p>place you get to know how it works</p><p>and you get to see like</p><p>he was dating this girl right</p><p>and the girl was over by the dj</p><p>booth and i&rsquo;m talking to her</p><p>and i&rsquo;m like yeah so what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on blah blah</p><p>blah blah you know we&rsquo;re just talking</p><p>and she&rsquo;s talking totally normal like this and all of a</p><p>sudden this guy walks in and the guy had like a poster</p><p>poster workers jacket on</p><p>she&rsquo;s not a guy who makes a ton of</p><p>money right</p><p>as you know works for the post office</p><p>so he comes in he&rsquo;s got a</p><p>you know baseball hat on looks like he&rsquo;s probably</p><p>about 50 and she all of a</p><p>sudden turns it on and i saw it and it was like it was</p><p>shocking it was like when you see your cat kill a mouse</p><p>for the first time</p><p>you ever see a cat kill a</p><p>mouse and you love that cat</p><p>but all sudden bang that cat is</p><p>fucking this</p><p>mouse up and it&rsquo;s</p><p>you&rsquo;re like whoa you evil</p><p>bitch like i</p><p>never knew this about you</p><p>well you know</p><p>i&rsquo;m talking to her she seems totally normal</p><p>and this guy comes in she&rsquo;s like hey baby</p><p>and she comes running over to this guy and you can see</p><p>this poor fuck is just smitten</p><p>it&rsquo;s just so sad she&rsquo;s like oh my god you&rsquo;re here</p><p>and she puts her one hand on his</p><p>lower back and one hand on his</p><p>chest and he&rsquo;s got his arms around her both of them</p><p>clasp behind him and she&rsquo;s like rubbing up</p><p>against him</p><p>oh i&rsquo;m watching</p><p>i&rsquo;m watching a</p><p>victim like she&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna inject him with</p><p>venom and suck all the</p><p>money out of him</p><p>but this guy had bought her a truck</p><p>he bought her a yukon denali</p><p>she was having problems with her car</p><p>so he bought</p><p>her a fucking car and an expensive one one of those</p><p>super luxuried aldenolities</p><p>there just like cadillacs</p><p>escalade no it&rsquo;s just as nice but just</p><p>trunk space dude</p><p>it was the craziest</p><p>thing ever was</p><p>watching it was like whoa like this is like</p><p>this is nature man</p><p>this is just as natural as any</p><p>other thing</p><p>just as natural as</p><p>a bug that gets</p><p>caught in a spider&rsquo;s web and gets zapped with</p><p>venom and alien</p><p>and also marriage</p><p>a lot of these guys</p><p>married way too</p><p>early i mean just</p><p>think back then they were getting</p><p>married to 20</p><p>25 so they&rsquo;re</p><p>trapped in these relations</p><p>as they grow into different people</p><p>right no wonder there&rsquo;s so much divorce</p><p>so then you&rsquo;re</p><p>trapped with this</p><p>woman who just becomes fucking</p><p>nasty and then they</p><p>get those mom</p><p>haircuts so they all look like they have that little</p><p>lesbian mom haircut</p><p>about like denim</p><p>jeans and all kinds of fun</p><p>they give up all together on</p><p>their bodies</p><p>and then he can go to</p><p>strip club and be with a ten</p><p>and all it costs is</p><p>maybe twenty two thousand dollars</p><p>after you get that car</p><p>wholesale like</p><p>that and here he&rsquo;s got this ten that&rsquo;s</p><p>just all over him on a regular basis that was his</p><p>apparently his modus operandi</p><p>this guy&rsquo;s thing</p><p>was to come there</p><p>after work and just hang out and</p><p>hang out for</p><p>hours and hours and</p><p>hours and just give this</p><p>chick all of his money</p><p>like literally gave this</p><p>chick all of his money</p><p>every day was like a new thousand</p><p>thousand here thousand there thousand here yeah i</p><p>can never do</p><p>that&rsquo;s another part with</p><p>strip clubs is i&rsquo;m too</p><p>worried like i</p><p>started thinking like</p><p>if i took this</p><p>money and went to osh</p><p>i could get i really just</p><p>yeah osh orchard</p><p>supply hardware like</p><p>house supplies</p><p>yeah i get that</p><p>yeah work on my place</p><p>stripper when</p><p>it gets into</p><p>my home yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s mad money that&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p><p>you know that&rsquo;s</p><p>i&rsquo;m a ball seriously yeah taking it and</p><p>throwing it away let&rsquo;s</p><p>throw away all this yeah</p><p>i think about that all the time even if it&rsquo;s</p><p>like going out</p><p>drinking or something like that</p><p>much shit i just</p><p>you know i went out to eat and i</p><p>spent you know</p><p>sixty dollars i</p><p>could have went and bought a</p><p>you know fucking groceries</p><p>up i hate that you</p><p>know the best</p><p>steak ever at a</p><p>supermarket for</p><p>twenty bucks</p><p>yeah not even cook it</p><p>not even twenty</p><p>bucks yeah well</p><p>if you get a big fat</p><p>thick one are they like</p><p>twenty bucks yeah</p><p>like twenty</p><p>bucks well that&rsquo;s like also is like riding the wave of</p><p>these comedy careers because sometime point</p><p>you can get like look at like a guy like elon gold</p><p>you know the</p><p>comic he&rsquo;s always been on shows he was in that show</p><p>stacked with pamela anderson he</p><p>was on you know he&rsquo;s been on sitcom she&rsquo;s got four kids</p><p>wow does it really yeah</p><p>he&rsquo;s got an</p><p>impressionist you look like elon</p><p>gold seinfeld and shit like that he does a lot of good</p><p>he&rsquo;s a very good</p><p>impressions very funny</p><p>good impressions of</p><p>comics yeah</p><p>he&rsquo;s very funny anyway so</p><p>he like is on</p><p>these shows</p><p>then the shows go away</p><p>and he has to sort of</p><p>ride it out and save as much</p><p>money as he possibly</p><p>can i&rsquo;m in the same boat it&rsquo;s like i got a deal</p><p>then i have nothing</p><p>you know well</p><p>the key is to keep the</p><p>stand up going so that you always have something</p><p>yeah you know</p><p>if your stand up is</p><p>strong and you headline all over</p><p>the country and you get a big following and you know</p><p>especially develop</p><p>an internet presence then you don&rsquo;t have to ever worry</p><p>about things</p><p>because you always got</p><p>money coming in and you can order</p><p>sort of hustle i mean i&rsquo;m not making a</p><p>ton of money doing</p><p>stand up but</p><p>i can make a living</p><p>i can definitely</p><p>make what somebody that guy in the post office</p><p>but you could</p><p>but listen you</p><p>could be making a</p><p>ton of money doing</p><p>stand up you have the</p><p>the comedy chops</p><p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of getting</p><p>your comedy out there to more people yeah that&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing you don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>great product no no no that&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing people come out to see me live</p><p>it&rsquo;s nothing but good shows</p><p>bill burrow i talked to him a lot</p><p>and he told me it&rsquo;s killing and obscurity he goes</p><p>2001 to 2006 was my killing and obscurity phase</p><p>because i was just</p><p>crushing it</p><p>everywhere you go</p><p>nobody knows who the fuck you are</p><p>and then it just</p><p>starts to snowball and</p><p>snowball and you get on this</p><p>thing and that</p><p>thing happens</p><p>and it&rsquo;s just getting the people in notoriety</p><p>to have people be familiar</p><p>with your shit and then you know it will just all</p><p>start to fucking happen yeah</p><p>the key is just to keep doing comedy when i was on news</p><p>radio like i was always constantly</p><p>getting encouraged by people to not do it anymore</p><p>they were like a lot of</p><p>comedy you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re an actor now</p><p>look at like a</p><p>paul riser who&rsquo;s just</p><p>could have been you know stop</p><p>seinfeld kept</p><p>going all these guys</p><p>raven mono still does</p><p>stand up kevin</p><p>james i think it&rsquo;s</p><p>still going</p><p>riser doesn&rsquo;t do it at all anymore</p><p>riser just stopped all together he&rsquo;s like</p><p>thank god you</p><p>know what working with helen hunt for 10 years</p><p>crushes every comedy instinct you have</p><p>every day you&rsquo;re probably like what the fuck am i</p><p>doing for money</p><p>mean michael keaton</p><p>was a stand up there&rsquo;s all</p><p>these actors dead</p><p>michael keaton</p><p>i haven&rsquo;t seen any michael keaton</p><p>stand up batman was a stand up</p><p>what happened to michael keaton</p><p>stopped he still</p><p>shit no he&rsquo;s working for a long</p><p>time we stopped</p><p>he stopped yeah</p><p>he dropped off and then</p><p>dropped off and</p><p>became like this</p><p>kind of like character actor guy</p><p>he went from being like this main</p><p>movie star to like a</p><p>break and then now he&rsquo;s a character actor</p><p>which was really kind of a fascinating</p><p>transition well he was in the</p><p>movie the good guys with</p><p>the other guys with</p><p>will ferrell</p><p>ferrell i didn&rsquo;t see that mark</p><p>he&rsquo;s really</p><p>funny that he&rsquo;s</p><p>bringing up</p><p>tlc references</p><p>it&rsquo;s just weird that you know he was he was a</p><p>giant movie star at one point in time remember the the</p><p>clone movie fucking batman yeah</p><p>three men and a baby remember was he in that wasn&rsquo;t he</p><p>tom gutenberg was in that with</p><p>steve gutenberg</p><p>steve gutenberg</p><p>sorry and here&rsquo;s a steve comes our story</p><p>steve gutenberg</p><p>you know he&rsquo;s lost his mind</p><p>and he used to be another one

was</p><p>taken off he had a million</p><p>things going on</p><p>he was one of</p><p>those guys who</p><p>would talk to him and he was</p><p>just so obsessed with it he was like well we got a deal</p><p>right now at universal</p><p>and if that</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t get picked up we got</p><p>more he was</p><p>hustling and bustling</p><p>yeah he was making it happen so for him</p><p>that hour and a</p><p>half sitting in that waiting room was just killing him</p><p>so he leaves and he fucking dies you know</p><p>shit and you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p><p>fly with a sinus</p><p>infection they tell you that all the time you&rsquo;re not</p><p>supposed to fly with that</p><p>i flew i flew once when i had pneumonia</p><p>oh my god when i because i got to get to a stupid gig</p><p>yeah and i just want</p><p>you know i&rsquo;ll fly when i go to the pacific</p><p>northwest it feels like my head&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna fucking explode</p><p>wow so you do that shit all the time and do</p><p>i mean you got it</p><p>i sometimes</p><p>get a little overboard hypochondriac a little bit</p><p>well you know</p><p>i got sick for the</p><p>first time this year in fucking years i</p><p>haven&rsquo;t gotten sick</p><p>and i slacked off and here&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p><p>i take a lot of probiotics a</p><p>drink like kombucha</p><p>this kombucha</p><p>tea is fucking</p><p>super good for your health</p><p>is healthy coconut</p><p>juice is great too</p><p>but what happened with kombucha is</p><p>they got in</p><p>trouble with</p><p>whole foods because</p><p>their shit was more than one half of 1</p><p>alcohol so it has to be</p><p>labeled so they</p><p>watered the fuck down</p><p>there watered</p><p>their formula like seriously water</p><p>down where it</p><p>tastes like shit it does not</p><p>taste near its gts kombucha it used to</p><p>taste awesome it was like very carbonated very</p><p>strong and i really</p><p>enjoyed the flavor</p><p>but then it became like this like</p><p>it literally it feels like it&rsquo;s half</p><p>water and half what it used to be and</p><p>i just i think it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p><p>nearly as active like the the probiotics in and i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think they&rsquo;re nearly as strong</p><p>so i got sick like for the</p><p>first time ever do you really</p><p>think that&rsquo;s why you got sick yeah you know why</p><p>absolutely this is why i</p><p>think it because i&rsquo;ve</p><p>never been sick before and i&rsquo;ve been</p><p>drinking that shit almost</p><p>every day so it</p><p>it changes within</p><p>a month of it</p><p>changing i go and i get sick for the</p><p>first time i really</p><p>think that makes</p><p>sense i went to a vitamin shop</p><p>and i walked in there and i was</p><p>deathly ill</p><p>and i said what are you selling all the time</p><p>that works for immunity and</p><p>stuff flying off the</p><p>shelf what is it and he took me to a</p><p>thing called sambucall</p><p>black elderberry shit that you</p><p>drank and there&rsquo;s pills for it i</p><p>would take down on a regular basis whenever i get sick</p><p>cleaned right up</p><p>i mean it really does work it&rsquo;s there are</p><p>definitely probiotics and what they do is they attack</p><p>all the negative shit in your body all the unhealthy</p><p>bacteria you know it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re keeping healthy</p><p>troops on hand acidophilus is a big one i hadn&rsquo;t</p><p>taken acidophilus in forever i</p><p>would see that</p><p>reason why is because i was</p><p>drinking this kombucha</p><p>all the time i was like i don&rsquo;t need to supplement with</p><p>acidophilus i&rsquo;m getting plenty of probiotics from this</p><p>so then once this</p><p>stuff went bad</p><p>i started taking acidophilus</p><p>again now i take acidopus every day</p><p>that&rsquo;s in milk</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s a milk</p><p>culture yogurt</p><p>you can buy</p><p>it in pills you can buy it on</p><p>live form you have to keep it</p><p>refrigerated</p><p>you know but</p><p>it&rsquo;s you know</p><p>especially if you get</p><p>older man you</p><p>start being real cognizant</p><p>of your health</p><p>yeah i start thinking</p><p>about it i go to a gym and i&rsquo;ve been trying to go</p><p>every single day</p><p>my resolution is holding up so far</p><p>and even if i can just go for a little bit i get my</p><p>heart going and i stretch</p><p>just trying to keep</p><p>everything in</p><p>shape because i&rsquo;m all</p><p>you know you don&rsquo;t talk into the</p><p>microphone dude your</p><p>voice varies</p><p>oh is this significantly</p><p>sorry i&rsquo;m looking at you at</p><p>the same time</p><p>no i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>let&rsquo;s turn so we don&rsquo;t have to do that because</p><p>it&rsquo;s like your</p><p>voice is like real low and then all of a</p><p>sudden it&rsquo;s real high so the people on the</p><p>ecliptical machine</p><p>right now with</p><p>their headphones in and like this fucking</p><p>magical tell them</p><p>where the mic is</p><p>see where the sign is</p><p>where the words are yeah that&rsquo;s the part we should talk</p><p>to perfect i was on the top of it</p><p>you were ready dude</p><p>you were right there</p><p>anyway so you go to the gym yeah</p><p>taking taking a better care of myself i feel like i</p><p>could when i saw that</p><p>ufc fight for the first you</p><p>ready felt like i</p><p>could fucking get in there</p><p>somebody up</p><p>i certainly feel like</p><p>i have the mindset for it like i really feel like i</p><p>could kick somebody</p><p>kill her i used to</p><p>fire people you know that was my job when you first met</p><p>me is that i like up in the air with george clooney</p><p>yeah i used to be</p><p>i terminated over a thousand people</p><p>really yeah</p><p>i&rsquo;m just like that was</p><p>my job at my parents family businesses that i used to</p><p>the fucking hatchet man you got some negative</p><p>karma shit going</p><p>on well now they deserved it for the most part</p><p>so but sometimes you had</p><p>to you&rsquo;d send</p><p>an unfortunate time it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s like</p><p>a privilege to be working and having somebody pay you</p><p>if you had a fucking employee and you didn&rsquo;t have the</p><p>money anymore</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing else we can do</p><p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p><p>bunch of different ways of looking at this economy</p><p>being all fucked up and i see some people are very</p><p>pragmatic look at it like hey you know what these jobs</p><p>these jobs at</p><p>these people are losing</p><p>these jobs weren&rsquo;t important in the</p><p>first place these</p><p>motherfuckers</p><p>you know we lost all our jobs overseas and what we</p><p>need to do is strengthen our economy and this is just</p><p>a symptom of a bigger evil</p><p>i see that but an</p><p>individual one on one basis man whenever i</p><p>think about</p><p>these people that are</p><p>going broke and people that are losing their</p><p>houses and people that don&rsquo;t know what to do</p><p>especially if i</p><p>think that they&rsquo;re dumb</p><p>and that they&rsquo;re you know</p><p>their occupation options are</p><p>limited and</p><p>then they have children and shit to it&rsquo;s like fuck man</p><p>these poor fucks were led to believe that this</p><p>whole thing</p><p>that this ship was</p><p>gonna sail it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be fine</p><p>well also it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about with</p><p>stand up if you just decide to</p><p>check out and work and you just like you reach a</p><p>thirty thousand dollar job and you say this is it</p><p>is all i need</p><p>right my father</p><p>in law did that shit he&rsquo;s the type of guy who would go</p><p>and sit in a big recliner</p><p>and get like a thirsty two ouncer</p><p>just fucking sit there and watch tv</p><p>no aspirations to do anything</p><p>and he please go but</p><p>people are fucking like that there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of people like that</p><p>a lot of people like that you just become complacent</p><p>you&rsquo;re like this is good</p><p>right here i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s bad</p><p>i think there&rsquo;s a machine</p><p>going on man i</p><p>think we&rsquo;re all little</p><p>pieces of this fucking</p><p>giant machine</p><p>you know and i</p><p>think you can look at it like</p><p>what you&rsquo;re doing is very important</p><p>and that what you&rsquo;re doing has meaning to it but</p><p>really it has meaning to you and as meaning</p><p>to the people who like it but what is what is its</p><p>place in the overall</p><p>grand scheme i don&rsquo;t know man</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>these people sitting there with</p><p>drinks they</p><p>might be on to something</p><p>they might be on to something the guy who&rsquo;s the</p><p>bouncer just</p><p>sat there with the</p><p>power and no job</p><p>that guy was not on something</p><p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t believe that</p><p>i think that guy needs to get a real fucking job</p><p>certainly 40 year old</p><p>super genius yeah</p><p>we need all the</p><p>super geniuses tell</p><p>people not to puke on his</p><p>shoes yeah working a</p><p>good project</p><p>yeah no hats

it&rsquo;s the same way</p><p>i describe people who are doucheed you on the internet</p><p>that it&rsquo;s like a little bit of</p><p>snake venom</p><p>a little bit of</p><p>snake venom gets you immune to</p><p>snake venom</p><p>so that snake</p><p>after it bites you</p><p>three or four times</p><p>after a while like hey</p><p>get the fuck</p><p>out of here you&rsquo;re not poisoning me anymore</p><p>yeah she was one of</p><p>those relationships</p><p>where like we</p><p>would break up</p><p>and then you know something happened and then i</p><p>would take her</p><p>back just because i know how broken she is</p><p>and then this third time</p><p>was just like so</p><p>quick in fact like we</p><p>started dating again</p><p>next thing i know she&rsquo;s almost</p><p>moved in she&rsquo;s talking</p><p>about getting</p><p>married and like this is like in two weeks</p><p>and she just got out of a relationship</p><p>where this guy like</p><p>cheated on her or something like that</p><p>and it was the most intense</p><p>zero to 60 in two weeks</p><p>and then one day it was just out of nowhere she just</p><p>started going</p><p>crazy picking</p><p>fights with me out of nowhere i&rsquo;m like what the fuck is</p><p>going on next</p><p>thing i notice</p><p>next day she&rsquo;s</p><p>tweeting her ex boyfriend like</p><p>pictures together</p><p>like are you</p><p>what the fuck is going on</p><p>and i keep on finding all this shit she left at my</p><p>house and one of the</p><p>thing is is like she had a memory card in my camera</p><p>that she must have used my camera and the funniest</p><p>thing is is like</p><p>pictures of her in this guy</p><p>and then the next day</p><p>pictures of me and her</p><p>it&rsquo;s like doing the</p><p>exact same poses</p><p>like arms around each other</p><p>and it was like two days it was</p><p>actually two days it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p><p>photoshopped in over that</p><p>other guy wow</p><p>yeah matter</p><p>well you know what it is and</p><p>this is how i describe it to you</p><p>there&rsquo;s some people that are addicted</p><p>to that charge of an initial</p><p>relationship when someone is just in love with you</p><p>right you know when you meet</p><p>someone man and you you know you fucking really click</p><p>and you&rsquo;re hanging out and you&rsquo;re fucking like four or</p><p>five times a day and you just kissing all the time you</p><p>can&rsquo;t wait to see him</p><p>that&rsquo;s like an intense</p><p>fucking you know</p><p>intense romantic thing</p><p>and then i got</p><p>married yeah</p><p>it works that way sometimes yeah</p><p>and then when you&rsquo;re in a situation</p><p>where let&rsquo;s</p><p>be quite honest about this</p><p>the girl perhaps</p><p>might be a bit</p><p>above you on the food chain</p><p>right not a lot but a bit</p><p>right happens</p><p>well then you&rsquo;re</p><p>stepping on eggshells because you&rsquo;re afraid</p><p>of offending her</p><p>because you&rsquo;re in the situation where like</p><p>jesus i don&rsquo;t want to fuck this up like this</p><p>is the greatest</p><p>thing of all</p><p>time this is so perfect</p><p>she&rsquo;s got the perfect body</p><p>not gonna find another</p><p>one of these</p><p>again i&rsquo;m telling all my friends dude look at this</p><p>picture can you believe i&rsquo;m fucking this this is insane</p><p>wow and so then</p><p>they get addicted</p><p>to that really intense part of the relationship</p><p>where you just enamored by them</p><p>and then as time goes on</p><p>you get comfortable with each</p><p>other and then she becomes your</p><p>girlfriend and when she becomes your girlfriend</p><p>then you just kind of like lack of days ago around each</p><p>other you don&rsquo;t care if your</p><p>hair is fucked up you don&rsquo;t care if your breath smells</p><p>you know you</p><p>pee with the door open</p><p>hot box each</p><p>other and she</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck either</p><p>and so you know it</p><p>some weird thing</p><p>where you just get real comfortable with each other and</p><p>you don&rsquo;t fuck as much</p><p>and then some</p><p>other guy comes</p><p>along and that</p><p>other guy shows the same potential</p><p>for being the guy that&rsquo;s</p><p>so in love with you and this is it it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p><p>about us we&rsquo;ve had some problems in the past</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna fucking</p><p>stick together forever for till</p><p>death we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have babies yes</p><p>and then the rage is on</p><p>again and it&rsquo;s just this</p><p>mad fucking</p><p>crazy dash from one person to the next</p><p>who can provide the next charge the next</p><p>beginning of the relationship is thunderous</p><p>orgasmic type of</p><p>interaction and it sucks because i&rsquo;ve gotten to the</p><p>age where i totally know that you know and</p><p>so i am like</p><p>this person gets hurt and i&rsquo;m like you know</p><p>i want you to know</p><p>i can tell you what happened to our relationship and</p><p>we can really work this together and i&rsquo;ll do the</p><p>stupid take girl back i

razor</p><p>you know like</p><p>a video game</p><p>no he left me a video game i hate the shit that girls</p><p>leave over how old are</p><p>these relationships 36</p><p>that&rsquo;s good how old are

sometimes people can keep it</p><p>together for long stretches</p><p>where they really are the perfect girlfriend</p><p>for like two weeks this crazy</p><p>bitch really is the perfect</p><p>girlfriend she&rsquo;s a lot of fun she wants to cook</p><p>she&rsquo;s hilarious she</p><p>cracks jokes i look forward to seeing her</p><p>then after that two weeks the fucking</p><p>crazy comes out</p><p>and

mushrooms</p><p>are very similar</p><p>and then if you&rsquo;ve</p><p>never experienced it if you</p><p>never had your own kid and if you&rsquo;ve</p><p>never really done mushrooms shut the</p><p>fuck up you really don&rsquo;t know i used to talk about kids</p><p>you know i didn&rsquo;t</p><p>understand what it was</p><p>until you have a kid</p><p>and the other</p><p>thing that you</p><p>understand is that</p><p>stop doing that whatever you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>the other thing</p><p>that you realize when you have a kid is that you change</p><p>and you hit some</p><p>weird new next</p><p>level of evolution</p><p>where there&rsquo;s so much more at</p><p>stake now and there&rsquo;s some</p><p>you become a more serious person it&rsquo;s really</p><p>weird i feel like a real man too</p><p>i feel like a man exactly</p><p>i mean i&rsquo;m still very</p><p>silly and i obviously make a living</p><p>sure sure sure sure</p><p>you know and i still</p><p>smoke a lot of weed</p><p>which is also a</p><p>weird thing with a lot of people that&rsquo;s like they</p><p>think some for some reason or</p><p>other you&rsquo;re not supposed to smoke weed</p><p>you know that like smoking</p><p>weed when you&rsquo;re a father like set some sort of a</p><p>weird example</p><p>or that it&rsquo;s a bad</p><p>thing but but</p><p>i&rsquo;ll go well how come i can go to a restaurant and</p><p>order a beer and nobody even blinks</p><p>that&rsquo;s fine nobody says a word</p><p>about that i go and get some wine</p><p>with dinner and</p><p>nobody looks at me</p><p>they ask me if i want it</p><p>if i said no but you guys got a</p><p>place where i can hit this joint</p><p>they&rsquo;d be like whoa what the</p><p>fuck your children are here either way if you&rsquo;re too</p><p>baked though if you get

not what i&rsquo;m saying</p><p>but i&rsquo;m saying like i&rsquo;m not</p><p>gonna change like who i am you know</p><p>i don&rsquo;t have to like become</p><p>this fucking straight edge person just because all of a</p><p>sudden i have children</p><p>if i thought there was something</p><p>wrong with smoking pot i</p><p>would have stopped doing it because i</p><p>think it&rsquo;s bad for you</p><p>if like it was detrimental</p><p>to my health or to my mental well being or something</p><p>if i thought it was something</p><p>an issue that i needed to deal with i</p><p>would deal with it as an</p><p>issue but i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think there&rsquo;s an</p><p>issue i think it&rsquo;s</p><p>beneficial i</p><p>think it helps my personality</p><p>it helps me</p><p>enjoy life it helps me write like</p><p>crazy it is like</p><p>steroids for writing</p><p>when i get high and i</p><p>write i am just i just strap in</p><p>and ride this wave that i connect to i get</p><p>high and i go into the isolation tank and i rethink my</p><p>whole life and it</p><p>i come up with new strategies and new ways of behaving</p><p>and i have a new appreciation for</p><p>everything and a new</p><p>respect and love</p><p>for my friends and my family</p><p>i end up calling people that i</p><p>haven&rsquo;t talked to in months</p><p>just getting out of the tank</p><p>dude i just want to tell you</p><p>man i mean we don&rsquo;t hang out but i love you man we&rsquo;re</p><p>friends and you know i get these</p><p>crazy conversations like</p><p>i just gotta make sure i say all</p><p>these things that i need to say it&rsquo;s like it</p><p>re invigorates</p><p>me but also being a dad hopes that i mean that does</p><p>too yeah i mean</p><p>the combination of the two</p><p>things people don&rsquo;t realize that</p><p>that&rsquo;s there is that</p><p>you do feel</p><p>like taking a step back and not taking</p><p>things so seriously either</p><p>even though i still get</p><p>fired up i keep</p><p>everything in perspective</p><p>very well too i mean</p><p>i&rsquo;m not making too many fucking</p><p>stupid decisions over here</p><p>yeah you get more in tune with love</p><p>you know and that</p><p>sounds fucking very gay</p><p>super gay but it is what it is man it&rsquo;s like you get</p><p>more in tune with love and that&rsquo;s honestly that&rsquo;s what</p><p>what weed is all</p><p>about too weed is</p><p>about getting you in tune</p><p>with love getting you in tune with happiness weed is a</p><p>happy drug it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s about</p><p>friendships and and hugs and having a good time and</p><p>laughing and giggling together</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a bad drug</p><p>it&rsquo;s an theogen</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what people have to understand</p><p>everything is lumped together in this one big</p><p>stupid group called drugs</p><p>and included our</p><p>caffeine and</p><p>alcohol and then dangerous shit like heroin and fucking</p><p>you know and math and all</p><p>those are drugs but there&rsquo;s also drugs that literally</p><p>change the way your fucking mind works</p><p>and in a good way</p><p>and they&rsquo;re here to make you</p><p>more humble make you feel better</p><p>and the reason why people have bad trips</p><p>is because there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p><p>about your life that&rsquo;s douchey man</p><p>you need to</p><p>clean that shit up</p><p>why are you paranoid</p><p>why are you</p><p>freaking out well you</p><p>should be freaking out</p><p>that&rsquo;s why people</p><p>do a lot of drugs in college too when you&rsquo;re younger</p><p>and you don&rsquo;t have as much responsibility but</p><p>more and more responsibility you have and then</p><p>when you do drugs you</p><p>start thinking</p><p>about all that shit that&rsquo;s why people</p><p>to freak out sure but if you&rsquo;re just more carefree</p><p>person in the</p><p>first place and the college is a perfect example</p><p>cause you really don&rsquo;t have too many responsibilities</p><p>you can go home by yourself for the</p><p>first time and</p><p>not have anybody scrutinize you once you get there</p><p>and so it&rsquo;s an opportunity</p><p>no no real bills to fucking pay</p><p>i mean if somebody&rsquo;s taking care of it</p><p>so less responsibility</p><p>and you can&rsquo;t just fucking let go</p><p>completely but</p><p>more and more shit that you got</p><p>going on like a daughter</p><p>and we talked</p><p>about the porn</p><p>thing with the data</p><p>like you just</p><p>start to put</p><p>you have more shit</p><p>built up the thing</p><p>about porn is you know i don&rsquo;t</p><p>wanna say why anybody gets into porn</p><p>cause i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m not a girl</p><p>i&rsquo;m not a girl that&rsquo;s getting fucked on camera i don&rsquo;t</p><p>understand you</p><p>maybe you really are</p><p>a healthy person it&rsquo;s just fun for you that&rsquo;s possible</p><p>doctor drew says no</p><p>but like then</p><p>again i said i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not a</p><p>woman i&rsquo;m not</p><p>a doctor i don&rsquo;t really</p><p>understand but</p><p>i think are the ones that i&rsquo;ve come in contact with</p><p>almost all of them had some fucked up childhood</p><p>almost all of them</p><p>i think it&rsquo;s pretty much mandatory yeah there&rsquo;s no</p><p>other way to do it</p><p>right right</p><p>it&rsquo;s like the reason why you got into it in the</p><p>first place is not</p><p>a healthy reason so it&rsquo;s just this massive evidence and</p><p>even if you&rsquo;re the coolest person to hang out with ever</p><p>like a lot of them</p><p>are you know a lot of them really fun to hang out with</p><p>you&rsquo;re still you&rsquo;re this way because somebody</p><p>was shitty to you that&rsquo;s what</p><p>they were talking</p><p>about think</p><p>about yeah they were talking</p><p>about that on that</p><p>green room show</p><p>with paul province</p><p>of before the one you were on</p><p>and they were talking</p><p>about how everybody&rsquo;s</p><p>all comics dads</p><p>or some shit</p><p>like that like yeah</p><p>there is some</p><p>comics some dad shit</p><p>dad shit always yeah well</p><p>you don&rsquo;t ever become a</p><p>comic or anything like that a singer or</p><p>anything where</p><p>you&rsquo;re asking for this exorbitant amount of attention</p><p>like this really unbalanced amount of attention</p><p>to say i want</p><p>to be a comedian is to say i want to be the one with a</p><p>light shining on me</p><p>while everyone else is in the dark</p><p>with my voice amplified</p><p>and i wanna be</p><p>above them i wonder</p><p>if standing</p><p>above their heads</p><p>never think of it like that at all yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s what it is that&rsquo;s what it is that&rsquo;s what it is</p><p>you wanna be</p><p>above the crowd you know</p><p>nobody wants to do a show where</p><p>everyone is</p><p>in the balcony staring down on you and you&rsquo;re one level</p><p>below them you</p><p>would feel disconnected if you didn&rsquo;t have that</p><p>floor filled in</p><p>you would feel</p><p>disconnected</p><p>the whole thing is a really</p><p>ridiculous request</p><p>and so to wanna do that for a living</p><p>you have to have some</p><p>giant deficit you&rsquo;re trying to make up for some fucking</p><p>crazy hole in your childhood</p><p>you know but</p><p>none of us really</p><p>think i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think i have it that bad you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have to have it that bad now</p><p>and i think one of the reasons why is because you&rsquo;re</p><p>self healed when you have</p><p>a family of your own and you have your own children</p><p>all of a sudden that shit goes away</p><p>you don&rsquo;t need your</p><p>daddy anymore man i don&rsquo;t need my</p><p>dad can get hit in the head by a fucking meteor not my</p><p>stepdad who raised me my real dad who i don&rsquo;t even know</p><p>i wouldn&rsquo;t give a fuck like</p><p>i don&rsquo;t need a dad you know</p><p>i&rsquo;m a dad myself thanks</p><p>thanks take care</p><p>i gotta know</p><p>sorry sorry you got hit in the head by a meteor</p><p>you know what i mean</p><p>but when i was</p><p>seven it was devastating when i was</p><p>seven like that guy like the fact that</p><p>my dad wasn&rsquo;t in my life anymore was just like whoa</p><p>just crushing</p><p>and so that</p><p>whatever sets you off when you&rsquo;re</p><p>seven or whatever it is whatever</p><p>age it is you have</p><p>this dad issue</p><p>that&rsquo;s what</p><p>gives you this incredible energy and desire to pursue</p><p>this stand up comedy thing</p><p>the key is somewhere</p><p>along the line you have to</p><p>shift your motivation</p><p>and your motivation has to go from</p><p>i want all this attention to i</p><p>wanna produce all this art and make people happy</p><p>i wanna produce all this shit that people love i want</p><p>people to come see how</p><p>magical and concert i&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna give them a fucking rocking show</p><p>where they get all</p><p>excited and can&rsquo;t wait to see me</p><p>again i think</p><p>about what my</p><p>one of my kids i can&rsquo;t help but think</p><p>about this i think</p><p>about my kids looking at my</p><p>standup when</p><p>they&rsquo;re 18 years</p><p>old and looking back and seeing what i did are you</p><p>still smoking cigarettes</p><p>no i&rsquo;m done you&rsquo;re done yeah completely</p><p>i quit almost</p><p>i feel like a year ago</p><p>right around now</p><p>how many times a day do you</p><p>think about it</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know why this</p><p>motherfucker he quits</p><p>and his cat hurts her foot</p><p>the cat hurt her foot</p><p>so he was it her yeah</p><p>yeah cat hurt her foot</p><p>she jumped off the refrigerator and hurt her foot</p><p>so he got so stressed out he</p><p>started smoking</p><p>cigarettes again</p><p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s always something for me</p><p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p><p>if it&rsquo;s a relationship problem or if it&rsquo;s my</p><p>cat get hurt problem it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all excuses i mean</p><p>cigarettes i even</p><p>i know you just you say that you&rsquo;re over and</p><p>stuff like that</p><p>but most people when they even if it&rsquo;s been a year</p><p>i still thought</p><p>about it at</p><p>least once a week</p><p>and then the reason</p><p>i saw actually i saw a commercial that made me quit</p><p>wow one of those non smoking commercials</p><p>and it was great one it said</p><p>it was there for you then</p><p>you know you did it</p><p>after you smoked in the morning you smoked at</p><p>night you smoked after</p><p>lunch you smoked when your</p><p>daughter was born you smoked here you</p><p>smoke there</p><p>because you did it you tried</p><p>now you&rsquo;re done</p><p>like that and just put it you gave it a shot</p><p>like i smoked</p><p>i really did</p><p>smoke and i&rsquo;m just done with it i</p><p>think if i have kids that&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be a real big pushy</p><p>thing but when you&rsquo;re hanging out at a comedy club</p><p>drinking and</p><p>every single person&rsquo;s smoking it is almost</p><p>impossible to fucking quit smoking</p><p>unless you have something like a kid at home</p><p>that you&rsquo;re like okay i&rsquo;m doing anything for this is</p><p>especially when you get a couple of</p><p>drinks and you like fuck yeah but</p><p>everybody else</p><p>is smoking and you&rsquo;re sitting around it&rsquo;s also an</p><p>easy way to step away from a situation like if i&rsquo;m at a</p><p>party one of the best things</p><p>about smoking for me is that you were in a party</p><p>and i get to walk outside and just sort</p><p>of collect my thoughts and be by myself</p><p>right and then</p><p>maybe he&rsquo;s out there and it&rsquo;s cool another cool smoker</p><p>guy what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up you see that chicken there</p><p>whatever is</p><p>and so you have a tiny meeting away</p><p>from the fucking event i used</p><p>to see that back in boston</p><p>when they had to do it and it was fucking zero degrees</p><p>on green and</p><p>these poor junkies were</p><p>standing outside</p><p>these fucking queer laws</p><p>smoke in the city we</p><p>fucking can&rsquo;t even</p><p>smoke inside anymore what&rsquo;s next yeah</p><p>you just go</p><p>it&rsquo;s the ability to step away from shit</p><p>yeah i really did miss that&rsquo;s what all meetings</p><p>little tiny meeting</p><p>little tiny meetings that&rsquo;s funny</p><p>so you&rsquo;re in a little tiny club</p><p>that&rsquo;s kind of interesting when you look and a club</p><p>where you meet with</p><p>the regular people at the regular time so you see t bow</p><p>who i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had</p><p>cigarettes with have you had</p><p>cigarettes with</p><p>jason tebow oh</p><p>yeah all the time all the time he&rsquo;s one of my favorite</p><p>cigarette smoker guys exactly so he has his regular</p><p>cigarette guys that he</p><p>sees and he knows if he sees corp mccown he can get a</p><p>cigarette off him he knows if he sees</p><p>this guy renezezie used to</p><p>smoke and he just quit so if you see</p><p>steve renezezie</p><p>you can smoke to you know he&rsquo;s got</p><p>cigarettes isn&rsquo;t</p><p>that a part of it too that you support each</p><p>other like you</p><p>give each other</p><p>can i bomb a cigarette</p><p>you always give the guy a cigarette</p><p>cause you know</p><p>that if you see him and you have a cigarette</p><p>he&rsquo;s got a cigarette</p><p>and you&rsquo;re good a</p><p>lot of watering</p><p>and i see you people do that at bars</p><p>too that don&rsquo;t even know people you got a spare yeah</p><p>they&rsquo;ll ask you for a fucking free cigarette</p><p>like that&rsquo;s like saying</p><p>can i have a dollar</p><p>you know i was a take two guy</p><p>because i knew he&rsquo;d need one for later</p><p>really one for</p><p>later generous</p><p>motherfucker yeah</p><p>he did that a</p><p>lot did that to daryl last</p><p>night yeah you know what</p><p>you like a guy a lot you see you see a</p><p>tebow right</p><p>here you know what</p><p>tebow i have another one</p><p>i fucking bust out</p><p>three you know</p><p>yeah no just put one behind the ear</p><p>did you did you ever go the natural</p><p>cigarettes route</p><p>where you try to get</p><p>those american</p><p>spirits i smoked</p><p>a parliament</p><p>light hardback and i smoked a marble</p><p>light hardback</p><p>and that was it</p><p>and what happened brian</p><p>those natural acts and not the way to go they</p><p>supposedly are better for you because they have</p><p>only tobacco in it and no pesticides and none of the</p><p>whatever 102 chemicals but</p><p>they&rsquo;re taking</p><p>a drag of a twig</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s so hard and rough</p><p>that i actually felt like more shit the next day waking</p><p>up on that it takes 15 minutes this one on regular</p><p>cigarettes in</p><p>about seven</p><p>minutes not even</p><p>half of it is just expensive</p><p>explosive chemicals you&rsquo;re sucking in yeah</p><p>you know there&rsquo;s 599 fda</p><p>approved chemical additives that are in cigarettes</p><p>joe was always on me not to smoke</p><p>you have children i know i know i know you were</p><p>on it and then also when i did before i had children i</p><p>you hear that sound</p><p>before you had children</p><p>the volcano</p><p>i&rsquo;m not doing that&rsquo;s the volcano</p><p>it&rsquo;s come alive</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s got a request</p><p>answer quest is to fuck you up</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about smoking</p><p>and there&rsquo;s a you know a lot</p><p>of people say well marijuana you know you&rsquo;re smoking</p><p>that&rsquo;s bad for you that&rsquo;s not good</p><p>well there&rsquo;s a</p><p>thing called the</p><p>vaporizer ladies and gentlemen</p><p>and what it is is it looks like a ufo</p><p>and it&rsquo;s jiffy pop</p><p>yeah it looks like it&rsquo;s making</p><p>jiffy pop but what it&rsquo;s really doing is</p><p>taking my ground up</p><p>plant material</p><p>and vaporizing it so that there&rsquo;s no smoke</p><p>but instead it&rsquo;s a mist and it&rsquo;s a thc mist</p><p>and what it does is it fills</p><p>this bag up with this thc mist oh it&rsquo;s filling up now</p><p>it&rsquo;s looking good how long have you had that leg in it</p><p>i&rsquo;ve had it for a</p><p>while man i</p><p>think i got it a few years ago</p><p>and because your bag leaks a little bit you know</p><p>bad then we&rsquo;re gonna do</p><p>gift idea if you wanted to</p><p>get you a new bag i really</p><p>i need a new bag is it turn off by itself</p><p>no you just wait is it</p><p>gonna pop look at it no not ready</p><p>it&rsquo;s not ready yet</p><p>looking good though</p><p>scary yeah this is</p><p>don&rsquo;t be a bit</p><p>like walking</p><p>around balloons and not hitting the ceiling</p><p>it&rsquo;s vapor bro it&rsquo;s thc</p><p>vapor and the</p><p>thing is it looks like</p><p>nothing like when you breathe</p><p>it in and breathe it out y&rsquo;all sometimes you know you</p><p>think you got anything</p><p>you want with the</p><p>clear bag but all bags are pretty much</p><p>clear so you can see the</p><p>mist in these</p><p>exactly well</p><p>this is just the same bag that i&rsquo;ve had for years i&rsquo;m</p><p>probably supposed to be replacing that no that&rsquo;s why</p><p>ladies i mean yeah it is a good gift idea</p><p>if you&rsquo;re thinking</p><p>about gifting</p><p>this volcanoes are fucking expensive yeah i</p><p>think like six hundred dollars or something like that</p><p>yeah i was thinking</p><p>about getting one and then i was like</p><p>this is the this is what you get out of it this</p><p>strange thing and inside this strange</p><p>thing is i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>jesus you&rsquo;re going crazy</p><p>and that just sticks around for a</p><p>while you can use that later yeah that&rsquo;s it bam son</p><p>pure thc you don&rsquo;t have to worry about smoke</p><p>if you worry about shit being bad for you how magical</p><p>you&rsquo;re still going on the children are you</p><p>still going on the road</p><p>yeah yeah you go you go with ari</p><p>yeah ari comes all the time</p><p>joey when you can count on them</p><p>you never know what joey</p><p>is because he might pull a joey</p><p>i just know shell</p><p>what&rsquo;s that and just no show</p><p>um i actually</p><p>started taking two people on the road with me</p><p>for the very reason</p><p>that i never knew of joey diaz is gonna show up</p><p>so joey diaz is the reason</p><p>was that did you hear that</p><p>did you hear uh</p><p>feedback no do you hear us yeah</p><p>hmm was that just you rustling</p><p>maybe you just kick something we sat down maybe</p><p>anyway i used to</p><p>take joey diaz</p><p>on the road all the time</p><p>until we worked in rascals</p><p>and worked in</p><p>rascals in new jersey and joey just didn&rsquo;t show up</p><p>he just never flew to new jersey</p><p>and he didn&rsquo;t answer his</p><p>phone he had a pager</p><p>back then it&rsquo;s impossible to get in</p><p>touch with them</p><p>and then finally we got in</p><p>touch with him the next day</p><p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m coming tonight don&rsquo;t</p><p>worry about it i&rsquo;ll be there don&rsquo;t worry</p><p>about it i&rsquo;m there don&rsquo;t</p><p>worry i miss my flight i fucked up i got</p><p>stuck in vegas</p><p>so it&rsquo;s maybe</p><p>an hour before the show</p><p>and we finally get a hold of joey</p><p>diaz and he&rsquo;s</p><p>still back in la or</p><p>vegas i forget</p><p>where he was like i ain&rsquo;t got a lot of your doors done</p><p>vegas i never got on the plane</p><p>just he just</p><p>he just whatever reason</p><p>he just decided to go off and do his own joey diaz</p><p>world that&rsquo;s</p><p>great and he&rsquo;s done that so many times</p><p>he did that in phoenix</p><p>he just he just fucking vanish i&rsquo;m telling you that</p><p>story of him at the</p><p>marilyn martinez</p><p>maybe there&rsquo;s somebody who talked</p><p>about that but</p><p>i mean it was just really one of the best</p><p>things i&rsquo;ve ever witnessed</p><p>just telling somebody off at a memorial</p><p>those fucking memorials</p><p>they bought me out man</p><p>yeah i went to mitch</p><p>yeah mitch was</p><p>i mean i don&rsquo;t</p><p>go to anybody&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t like funerals either</p><p>i don&rsquo;t like the idea behind if i want to celebrate</p><p>somebody i want to celebrate it on my own and to</p><p>think about</p><p>their life and you know my personal relationship</p><p>with them and if i mean if i mean it&rsquo;s cool</p><p>with you if you want to meet up with everybody and talk</p><p>about how great the guy was and</p><p>celebrate them i get it i totally</p><p>understand it</p><p>but to me it&rsquo;s just like man it&rsquo;s such a personal thing</p><p>when someone dies</p><p>i wouldn&rsquo;t have</p><p>public official died in</p><p>tucson i mean</p><p>they saw all the people in</p><p>obama spoke</p><p>yeah that was a lot</p><p>of people how many people were at that event you know</p><p>no it&rsquo;s a shitload</p><p>of people and a</p><p>university arizona</p><p>probably in the</p><p>basketball stadium</p><p>easily about</p><p>eight thousand people it&rsquo;s</p><p>weird right</p><p>and well you know in that case though it&rsquo;s like</p><p>those people need healing</p><p>you know those people are going oh</p><p>absolutely yeah</p><p>with something that</p><p>happened like that little girl got shot like that that</p><p>thing is so devastating</p><p>and apparently cops have been called to this guy&rsquo;s</p><p>house the guy who did that</p><p>shooting in arizona</p><p>well they pulled it over on</p><p>right there</p><p>jesus did they really they</p><p>pulled away he got arrested for</p><p>yeah he had</p><p>some sort of</p><p>violation he got pulled over oh my god they didn&rsquo;t</p><p>check that he&rsquo;s got guns</p><p>guns in a bag</p><p>jesus fucking christ</p><p>when anyone goes</p><p>to load up and went to walmart and bought a shitload</p><p>of bullets too i</p><p>think it&rsquo;s just</p><p>gotta be some</p><p>check like don&rsquo;t</p><p>you think so</p><p>like somebody just</p><p>let&rsquo;s take a</p><p>picture and send it</p><p>i&rsquo;m sure all that&rsquo;s being done i don&rsquo;t even know i feel</p><p>i feel bad for the cop that pulled him over</p><p>who has to think that you know</p><p>had he done a little bit more of an investigation</p><p>i just looked into this he probably had some</p><p>inkling but he&rsquo;s probably you know whatever</p><p>leave the guy alone</p><p>other people talking</p><p>about that or</p><p>they to people talking</p><p>about the fact that he was stopped and i</p><p>never heard it i didn&rsquo;t hear</p><p>until you just brought it up</p><p>that&rsquo;s crazy though the</p><p>photos of that kid the mugshot</p><p>photos looks</p><p>just as bananas as anybody</p><p>could look yeah i can&rsquo;t look any crazy yeah</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s but that&rsquo;s me</p><p>again with the payphone shit is like i would yeah</p><p>inspect them</p><p>you know well then the</p><p>other thought is that you know if you look at</p><p>the whole machine of life if you look at all</p><p>these different</p><p>things in life the good and the bad</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p><p>of people that believe and this is you know</p><p>this is sort of a staple in eastern religion</p><p>said almost you sort of have to have</p><p>negative in your life to recognize</p><p>the positive and the yin and yang the reason why it</p><p>exists because</p><p>that&rsquo;s the only way ever anything ever gets done</p><p>and like even events like 9 11</p><p>like they&rsquo;re terrible events but</p><p>in some ways they</p><p>bring people together</p><p>like new york after 9 11</p><p>after that was like the friendliest fucking</p><p>place in the</p><p>world for the longest time</p><p>senators holding hands with</p><p>on top of it was just different man people were you</p><p>know everyone was devastated people</p><p>were shell shocked they were horrified</p><p>but there was this</p><p>weird feeling and air of</p><p>a group of people that are all cool</p><p>motherfucker i&rsquo;m weak</p><p>now i feel better about mine</p><p>text earlier</p><p>somebody just call me once i</p><p>swear to god i unplug that fucking</p><p>thing anyway</p><p>there was a</p><p>sense of community there that didn&rsquo;t</p><p>exist and it fazed</p><p>away now we&rsquo;re</p><p>back back to douchiness</p><p>but for the longest</p><p>time man everyone was so fucking cool there so positive</p><p>we went there we filmed a fear factor i</p><p>think it was right</p><p>after september or whatever</p><p>there wasn&rsquo;t far</p><p>after it like</p><p>maybe a year or two after</p><p>everybody was in it was back when firemen</p><p>were fucking</p><p>heroes and firemen were just getting</p><p>pussy thrown at them everywhere</p><p>women wanted to go fuck firemen</p><p>they wanted to go fuck</p><p>heroes you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s weird how that changed</p><p>but for that</p><p>long time so it&rsquo;s like almost like a negative</p><p>thing like can</p><p>often times</p><p>inspire like this positive reaction the opposite way</p><p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p><p>think that all</p><p>these things are in</p><p>place and all</p><p>these fucked up people are in</p><p>place and fucked up situations</p><p>to get us to</p><p>appreciate the situations that aren&rsquo;t</p><p>you know to get us to really you know to really try to</p><p>be better and</p><p>and help us evolve so that we can get past</p><p>these unfortunate but</p><p>unavoidable situations</p><p>where they&rsquo;ve been</p><p>said yeah i</p><p>we need homeless people without homeless people</p><p>mean you no longer</p><p>you&rsquo;d have you need sort of</p><p>somebody on the bottom</p><p>this will not well</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t necessarily</p><p>agree with that but it&rsquo;s also</p><p>like you know to</p><p>watch something really terrible like that sort of like</p><p>motivates you to not let that happen to you</p><p>people can accept a lot of shit</p><p>a lot of things can happen to you</p><p>and you just sort of accept your situation and it gets</p><p>worse you sort</p><p>of accept that</p><p>yeah yeah exactly hoard is a perfect example</p><p>and you know because of that you just sort of</p><p>just all of a</p><p>sudden you find yourself</p><p>you know many</p><p>levels of accepting this bullshit in a</p><p>place where you</p><p>never would have just accepted it straight up</p><p>right off the bat</p><p>you just kind of</p><p>let it happen</p><p>like that next day</p><p>know your home</p><p>builds and builds and your credit gets out of control</p><p>and all you&rsquo;re</p><p>evicted and you just fucking</p><p>don&rsquo;t handle your shit</p><p>yeah you do look at that to get</p><p>motivated because this is the bottom</p><p>i&rsquo;ve seen the bottom</p><p>and i don&rsquo;t want to be near the fucking bottom exactly</p><p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p><p>i do not want that when i</p><p>watch a hoarders me and my wife actually</p><p>watch one the</p><p>other night in this show</p><p>is difficult to</p><p>watch because it was you</p><p>you&rsquo;re right that they do</p><p>gradually accept</p><p>that they have to shit on top of fucking capri</p><p>sun boxes or something in</p><p>their way and shit</p><p>stacks up around them</p><p>and they&rsquo;re just shifting</p><p>you know then we just</p><p>started living in one room</p><p>they say that all the time</p><p>also i think we</p><p>moved to this room</p><p>yeah we all recognize that our own</p><p>brains are just as vulnerable as</p><p>these people&rsquo;s brains</p><p>oh sure we just</p><p>a lot of people choose to</p><p>fight a little bit harder you</p><p>know you can just keep their shit</p><p>clean and it takes work</p><p>everything takes</p><p>work just life&rsquo;s maintenance needs to be</p><p>fucking done you can&rsquo;t let shit get out of control but</p><p>we&rsquo;ve all gone into this</p><p>weird spiral</p><p>i think anybody that i&rsquo;ve ever met</p><p>especially anybody</p><p>that&rsquo;s ever been in a tumultuous relationship</p><p>you go into this</p><p>weird spiral</p><p>where you don&rsquo;t feel like you</p><p>have that much control over your thoughts and actions</p><p>you know when guys get in like</p><p>a devastating relationship you get your</p><p>heart broken you can&rsquo;t</p><p>sleep you can&rsquo;t</p><p>think you know</p><p>especially when that happens</p><p>young in your life</p><p>you don&rsquo;t really</p><p>haven&rsquo;t mastered yet you don&rsquo;t really</p><p>understand who the fuck you are</p><p>you know that shit can send you on some kind of crazy</p><p>spiral you know</p><p>and if you go</p><p>through all that and you got some sort of a history of</p><p>mental illness in your family and</p><p>you know next</p><p>thing you know</p><p>done you&rsquo;re</p><p>cracked yeah</p><p>i mean you don&rsquo;t want ever accept that it</p><p>could happen to</p><p>you but you look at someone who&rsquo;s really devastated by</p><p>by any sort of a fucking obsession like that</p><p>gambling obsessions</p><p>hey do you know gambling people dude</p><p>my in laws live in</p><p>dirty vegas so you out near the airport</p><p>base out and</p><p>where there&rsquo;s all of</p><p>those poker</p><p>places and it&rsquo;s</p><p>pawn shop poker place</p><p>just shut down</p><p>fast food fast food pawn shop poker poker poker</p><p>and you go into one of</p><p>those places like a terribles casino</p><p>and shit like that there&rsquo;s</p><p>those car washes</p><p>and you going like a pjs poker</p><p>place and you just see</p><p>these just guys</p><p>you think like an</p><p>indian casino is bad there&rsquo;s regular casino really nice</p><p>then there&rsquo;s the</p><p>lower level downtown casinos</p><p>then there&rsquo;s like an indian casino that&rsquo;s</p><p>out in the middle of fucking nowhere and like why</p><p>would you go there</p><p>and they say it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a</p><p>morongo casino it&rsquo;s where real</p><p>nightlife is and you go in and it&rsquo;s just like</p><p>grouping of</p><p>chinese people to</p><p>morongo if you say anything</p><p>wrong be cool</p><p>right here there&rsquo;s a lot of money in</p><p>morongo come to</p><p>morongo yeah</p><p>there&rsquo;s so many hot</p><p>chicks and i love</p><p>going to morango man</p><p>thinking about getting</p><p>these commercials that come on</p><p>like the nightclubs and shit like that</p><p>it ends up being old chinese</p><p>ladies in like mystical wolf</p><p>t shirts fucking just walking around</p><p>with those walkers with the</p><p>tennis balls in the</p><p>bottom of the feet</p><p>it&rsquo;s fucking disgusting it&rsquo;s depressing shit</p><p>that gambling addiction is a strange one man</p><p>anybody spouse there&rsquo;s</p><p>homeless people in my neighborhood who bought a car</p><p>what i watched them be homeless</p><p>i knew they were</p><p>going around collecting cans</p><p>and just one day</p><p>you know how</p><p>you got your eye on the same homeless people</p><p>all the time you seen them around for a regular basis</p><p>these two i reckon</p><p>it&rsquo;s like a couple</p><p>frumpy looking</p><p>weird white lady</p><p>and this tall</p><p>black guy who wears a top hat sometimes</p><p>they start driving around a</p><p>green minivan</p><p>fucked up green minivan</p><p>but they got there and</p><p>saved up enough cans like marble</p><p>miles to buy they&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping in his van now</p><p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p><p>cheating they&rsquo;re</p><p>cheating in my neighborhood because they have a</p><p>place where you</p><p>can turn recyclables into</p><p>money and then</p><p>every night i see them just fucking</p><p>going through all</p><p>my everyone&rsquo;s recycle bins</p><p>and just taking out all the</p><p>shit from the recycle bins and then selling it down the</p><p>street yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>cheating is that cheating</p><p>no that&rsquo;s like the marble</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t starwood</p><p>points for homeless people</p><p>well i think that makes</p><p>sense because</p><p>one way you&rsquo;re not</p><p>gonna make any money</p><p>just put your recyclables on the</p><p>street you&rsquo;re not</p><p>gonna make any</p><p>money and for them it&rsquo;s like free money</p><p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p><p>cheating at all</p><p>yeah get out of my fucking</p><p>trash i don&rsquo;t want you in my</p><p>trash somebody was telling me well</p><p>as long as i do a good job</p><p>the downtown</p><p>they don&rsquo;t make</p><p>something your</p><p>identity they were in a downtown la like</p><p>shopping mall or something like that they saw</p><p>or an office complex and they saw one of</p><p>these fountains</p><p>where people throw</p><p>money in the fountain</p><p>and they were just</p><p>standing there</p><p>going oh my god what a beautiful fountain</p><p>and then this</p><p>latino family came in just rolled up all</p><p>their sleeves and went in the fountain just</p><p>started taking all the money whoa</p><p>and just say because it&rsquo;s free</p><p>money we&rsquo;re throwing</p><p>money in water</p><p>yeah what do you say to that how do you stop</p><p>that i have zero money</p><p>and there&rsquo;s money just</p><p>right there yeah you got</p><p>a foot of water</p><p>right and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a</p><p>weird thing like is it illegal to take the money yeah</p><p>yeah is it i</p><p>think so is it</p><p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be</p><p>no i think a lot of</p><p>these fountains</p><p>usually have a charity booked around behind it</p><p>like the mall gives it to a charity or something so i</p><p>think once it&rsquo;s that</p><p>it&rsquo;s considered giving to a charity</p><p>and it&rsquo;s stealing but it is no charity sign take</p><p>their money</p><p>right i need a</p><p>maybe they started</p><p>doing it to a charity just because people were doing it</p><p>right it&rsquo;s like the mexican soccer yeah</p><p>it is ridiculous that that&rsquo;s</p><p>how fucking rich this country is people can throw</p><p>money in a fountain</p><p>a fountain enough</p><p>money for food</p><p>like there&rsquo;s enough</p><p>money in that fountain</p><p>for you definitely to get something to eat</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s always</p><p>quarters and nickels there&rsquo;s</p><p>a comic that</p><p>is a conan writer that actually does that as a bit i&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry i forget his name but</p><p>imagine coming from another country</p><p>like where they have no</p><p>water where you have to go to a well</p><p>i don&rsquo;t really</p><p>just out in the middle of nowhere and there&rsquo;s one</p><p>water hole and there&rsquo;s a fucking</p><p>tiger there yeah</p><p>and then you come to this country</p><p>and you going to like</p><p>a place like</p><p>the city center</p><p>with city walk city walk universal city walk</p><p>and there&rsquo;s fucking water</p><p>shooting up</p><p>out of the ground kids are fucking frolicking</p><p>we&rsquo;re taking our</p><p>extra money</p><p>and throwing it in the fucking fountain</p><p>just like here&rsquo;s our</p><p>money and our</p><p>water it&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>right really crazy</p><p>it really is</p><p>well we don&rsquo;t realize how rich this country is</p><p>until you watch</p><p>you even talk to some of the people that are in certain</p><p>european countries</p><p>where there&rsquo;s no resources and</p><p>nothing to do like</p><p>there&rsquo;s a real</p><p>issue in
