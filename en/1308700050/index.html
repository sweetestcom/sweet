    <p>Our card this week is Katherine Sjoberg, the aid of hearts from Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In June 1974, 17-year-old Kathy was enjoying all the festivities of prom night when a heated</p>
<p>argument with her boyfriend at the post-prom dance sent her storming off into the cool</p>
<p>summer night, never to be seen or heard from again.</p>
<p>For nearly 50 years, law enforcement in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, have been haunted by Kathy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ve tried to find answers to the nagging questions still weighing on the community</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>How does someone vanish into thin air?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Just after midnight on Friday, June 7th, 1974, law enforcement in Jefferson County, Wisconsin,</p>
<p>got a call from a worried mother.</p>
<p>Her name was Ruth, and she was calling to report her 17-year-old daughter Kathy missing.</p>
<p>Ruth said that no one had seen Kathy since her high school&rsquo;s post-prom party in rural</p>
<p>Jefferson County in the wee morning hours of June 6th, which meant that she had been</p>
<p>missing for nearly 24 hours at this point.</p>
<p>Ruth said Kathy&rsquo;s prom date and boyfriend had come over to her house earlier in the</p>
<p>day looking for Kathy, and he told her that she had vanished from post-prom.</p>
<p>She stormed off into the dark at around 3 a.m. on the 6th after they got into a heated</p>
<p>argument, and no one had seen her since.</p>
<p>Ruth told law enforcement that she didn&rsquo;t think it was likely that her daughter had</p>
<p>run away because she had several things to look forward to in the near future, including</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s own wedding that Kathy was to be the maid of honor in.</p>
<p>Additionally, she&rsquo;d never run away like this before.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes she&rsquo;d go places without telling her mom, but she&rsquo;d always call home</p>
<p>pretty quickly to let Ruth know where she was and that she was safe, and at this point</p>
<p>it had been hours with no call.</p>
<p>Once the report was filed, the Jefferson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office wasted no time getting</p>
<p>the investigation started.</p>
<p>They jumped right into interviews, starting with the last person who saw Kathy, her boyfriend</p>
<p>Tim.</p>
<p>They got him to sit down for an interview at 9.30 that morning, and they asked him to</p>
<p>walk them through prom night.</p>
<p>He said that the night was supposed to start at 4 p.m. with him picking Kathy up, but the</p>
<p>tuxedo place was experiencing some kind of delay, he had to wait on that, but once he</p>
<p>got his tux, he picked up Kathy, and off they went to prom at their school.</p>
<p>But Tim said that him being late to pick up Kathy set them off on a bad foot, and it was</p>
<p>the start of a rather rocky night.</p>
<p>He told police that he and Kathy didn&rsquo;t hang out much at the dance, and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really see her except for a few times when he went up and kissed her to, quote, make</p>
<p>sure she wouldn&rsquo;t be mad.</p>
<p>Now part of the reason they weren&rsquo;t hanging out much was because Tim was on prom court,</p>
<p>so he had to be on the dance floor a lot.</p>
<p>He said sometime during that part of prom, Kathy disappeared.</p>
<p>He was worried that he hadn&rsquo;t seen her in a while, so he went searching for her, and</p>
<p>he actually found her hanging out in the restroom.</p>
<p>Tim noticed that she&rsquo;d been running off to the restroom quite a bit during the dance</p>
<p>and confronted her about it, which led to an intense argument.</p>
<p>Tim said that he then stormed outside, Kathy followed him, and they argued some more.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t remember exactly about what, but he said that he was so pissed that he just</p>
<p>left her outside and went back to the dance.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t see her again until after the dance was over when he reconnected with her</p>
<p>and their two friends, Bob and Julie.</p>
<p>The plan was for all four of them to ride together to the post-prom party at the Concord</p>
<p>House, which is like this event hall about 13 minutes away.</p>
<p>So the four of them piled into Bob&rsquo;s car and pulled up to the Concord House at around</p>
<p>12.20 a.m.</p>
<p>They had some drinks and stood around kind of mingling for a bit, and after that Tim</p>
<p>and Kathy once again split ways because Tim wanted to go play some games and Kathy just</p>
<p>wanted to sit down and relax.</p>
<p>All was fine until around 3 a.m. when someone came up and told Tim that they found Kathy</p>
<p>crying in the bathroom because she&rsquo;d lost her garter.</p>
<p>Tim was a bit confused because he had the garter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d taken it off of her on the drive there just a little while ago, so he went looking</p>
<p>for her and ended up finding her away from the crowd like just by herself.</p>
<p>And this is what Tim said happened.</p>
<p>He told Kathy that he had the garter the whole time.</p>
<p>She said she didn&rsquo;t remember him taking it, so Tim asked if she was drunk, and then</p>
<p>she yelled back that she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tim then got mad and told Kathy that he was upset that she was just wanting to like sit</p>
<p>around all the time and that whenever she got drunk, she acted stupid, to which she</p>
<p>again replied that she wasn&rsquo;t drunk.</p>
<p>At some point, the two of them ended up outside, and Tim kept pushing, saying that every time</p>
<p>Kathy had two drinks, she started acting weird.</p>
<p>So Kathy then responded, fuck you, and this set Tim off.</p>
<p>He told investigators that he slapped Kathy.</p>
<p>He claimed it wasn&rsquo;t a hard slap, but obviously it greatly upset her, so much so that she</p>
<p>took off running.</p>
<p>Tim watched her sprint away and go around the corner of the building.</p>
<p>He started to walk back inside, but after a few moments, he decided to go look for her</p>
<p>and see if she was okay.</p>
<p>He went around the corner of the building where he saw her run, but she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Our reporting team actually paid a visit to the Concord House, and you can see photos</p>
<p>of it in the blog post for this episode on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still an event venue today, and it&rsquo;s out in the middle of nowhere, secluded down</p>
<p>a long gravel driveway and surrounded by some marshy areas and lots of open fields.</p>
<p>There are a handful of homes nearby, and Interstate 94 practically sits right in its backyard,</p>
<p>so close that you can hear the cars whizzing by.</p>
<p>So with this terrain, it&rsquo;s not like there were many places for Kathy to run off to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when Tim went back inside and started asking around, but nobody had seen Kathy.</p>
<p>At this point, he was starting to get pretty worried, so he asked his friend Bob if he</p>
<p>could borrow his car to go looking for her.</p>
<p>He drove the car around, but still couldn&rsquo;t find Kathy anywhere.</p>
<p>At that point, word had spread at the party that Kathy was missing, so that&rsquo;s when everyone</p>
<p>joined in on the search.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Kevin Dobreiner with the Jefferson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>All throughout that night, it sounded like Tim was also going with other friends and</p>
<p>searching like some wooded area, and there&rsquo;s a marsh down there that they were like canvassing</p>
<p>all over the place.</p>
<p>And later on, ends up over at Kathy&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house, helping to look for her.</p>
<p>At some point later that day, Tim even went knocking on doors of Kathy&rsquo;s closest friends</p>
<p>to see if she&rsquo;d stayed there, but no one had seen her.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what law enforcement was running into as well.</p>
<p>While Tim&rsquo;s interview was going on, sheriff&rsquo;s deputies were canvassing the area around the</p>
<p>Concord House.</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner said that there were even fewer houses back then than there are today</p>
<p>in that area, so there weren&rsquo;t a ton of doors to even knock on, and the ones they</p>
<p>did knock on hadn&rsquo;t seen anything.</p>
<p>The deputies also checked a few vacant houses in the area for any signs of Kathy, but they</p>
<p>came up empty.</p>
<p>After investigators talked with Tim, they wanted to chat with everyone else who was</p>
<p>at the post-prom party.</p>
<p>They thought maybe someone else had seen Kathy run away and could tell them which way she</p>
<p>went.</p>
<p>Or at the very least, maybe someone could corroborate Tim&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Police started by talking to a post-prom chaperone named Ronald, who said that he remembered</p>
<p>Tim trying to leave the building by himself at around 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Ronald stopped Tim and asked where he was going, and he said that his girlfriend Kathy</p>
<p>had taken off and he needed to go look for her.</p>
<p>So Ronald gave him the green light to leave.</p>
<p>This matched up with Tim&rsquo;s story, giving his narrative more credibility.</p>
<p>Investigators also interviewed a woman named Gail, who said that she actually saw Kathy</p>
<p>outside jumping a fence sometime in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner couldn&rsquo;t find much information in the case file about who Gail was, like</p>
<p>whether she was a chaperone or if she was a student herself.</p>
<p>And when our reporting team went to the Concord House, it looked like whatever fence Gail</p>
<p>saw Kathy scaling had been torn down in the nearly 50 years since.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not clear where that whole thing happened or what direction that meant Kathy</p>
<p>was heading.</p>
<p>But it seems like Gail wasn&rsquo;t the last person to see Kathy.</p>
<p>The owner of a nearby bar came forward to police and said that when he was opening his</p>
<p>bar the following morning at around 7 a.m., he saw a girl in a blue formal dress walking</p>
<p>across the street alone.</p>
<p>For some reason, investigators didn&rsquo;t consider this sighting reliable, and it was never confirmed.</p>
<p>So to authorities, the last confirmed sighting of Kathy was actually Gail back at the Concord</p>
<p>House.</p>
<p>All of the eyewitness accounts, confirmed and unconfirmed, were lining up with the narrative</p>
<p>that Kathy had run away of her own accord.</p>
<p>So for the time being, authorities kind of unofficially labeled her a runaway, believing</p>
<p>that she would just pop back up soon.</p>
<p>But even as the days dragged by with no sign of Kathy, some of those closest to her still</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d been abducted or killed.</p>
<p>Kathy&rsquo;s father, Marvin Sjoberg, told the Waukesha Daily Freeman on June 10th that he</p>
<p>thought his daughter took off on her own that night and just hadn&rsquo;t come back yet.</p>
<p>But he did add that she&rsquo;d never run away like this before and that everyone was still</p>
<p>searching for her day and night.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what authorities were doing.</p>
<p>Even though they thought she probably ran away, that didn&rsquo;t stop them from looking</p>
<p>for her.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, upwards of 70 law enforcement officers searched high and low</p>
<p>for any sign of Kathy.</p>
<p>According to the Capital Times, on June 12th, investigators used a helicopter for aerial</p>
<p>searches of the whole east end of the county, and police scoured the area on foot.</p>
<p>But they found nothing.</p>
<p>In that same article, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Chief Deputy Harry Berger reiterated just</p>
<p>how clueless law enforcement felt, even with five days of searching under their belts.</p>
<p>He said, quote,</p>
<p>Authorities were still clinging to the hope that Kathy would suddenly call her mom and</p>
<p>all of this would be over.</p>
<p>Ruth was holding on to that same hope too.</p>
<p>She remained confident that Kathy would pop back up, if for no other reason than for Ruth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>upcoming wedding on June 15th.</p>
<p>Ruth told the Waukesha Daily Freeman, quote,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not changing my plans.</p>
<p>If Kathy&rsquo;s around any place, she&rsquo;ll be at the wedding.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>But June 15th came and went and Kathy didn&rsquo;t show.</p>
<p>It had been nine days since she was last seen.</p>
<p>And with each passing hour, it became more and more painfully apparent that she hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just up and run away for good.</p>
<p>Something terrible had happened to her.</p>
<p>Investigators kept searching, but as the days passed by with no sign of her, they got tired</p>
<p>of just waiting for something to pop up.</p>
<p>So they turned to polygraphs, starting with the last person Kathy had talked to before</p>
<p>she disappeared, Tim.</p>
<p>He agreed to take the polygraph.</p>
<p>So on June 21st, he sat down with a polygrapher and answered a series of questions.</p>
<p>But he failed.</p>
<p>The test detected deception on his answer to perhaps the most important question.</p>
<p>Do you know where Kathy is?</p>
<p>To which he responded, no.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that in several sources I found, including a published book titled</p>
<p>101 Wisconsin Unsolved Mysteries, they claimed Tim took three separate polygraphs and passed</p>
<p>them all.</p>
<p>But Detective Dobreiner said that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Records indicate that this was the only polygraph Tim took, which, like I said, he failed.</p>
<p>Anyway, even after Tim was told that he failed the polygraph, his statement didn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>He denied up and down knowing anything about where Kathy was.</p>
<p>So the detective let him go.</p>
<p>Tim didn&rsquo;t take the failed polygraph well.</p>
<p>Later that day, the sheriff&rsquo;s office got a call from Tim&rsquo;s mom, who told them just how</p>
<p>upset Tim was that investigators didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner said it&rsquo;s hard to know if Tim&rsquo;s frustration was because he was telling</p>
<p>the truth or because he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think that would be one of the most frustrating things if you&rsquo;re telling the truth to somebody</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being told that, you know, I don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do I prove to you that I&rsquo;m telling the truth?</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner said there was something he found odd about Tim&rsquo;s story to police that</p>
<p>some might see as a red flag, especially paired with the failed polygraph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that Tim openly admitted to assaulting Kathy before she vanished.</p>
<p>Which to me, going through some of the interview and interrogation classes and studying that</p>
<p>kind of stuff, I mean, you take it for what it is, a lot of people aren&rsquo;t going to include</p>
<p>themselves in additional crimes, like battery to somebody, which would be weird, but certainly</p>
<p>not unheard of for somebody to, you know, admit to buying pot or something before they</p>
<p>went and did a homicide to maybe, you know, look at buying the pot instead of the homicide.</p>
<p>So whether or not that&rsquo;s something that he added to try and take away from what otherwise</p>
<p>might have happened, take it for what it is, it goes both ways, but certainly admitting</p>
<p>to committing a battery to somebody.</p>
<p>After Tim&rsquo;s polygraph, investigators decided to test other people close to the investigation</p>
<p>to see if anyone else was hiding something.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Kathy&rsquo;s dad, mom, sister, and some of her friends took tests.</p>
<p>Kathy&rsquo;s dad Marvin was up first, and he passed.</p>
<p>No deception indicated.</p>
<p>Next was Kathy&rsquo;s sister Wendy.</p>
<p>And she failed.</p>
<p>She was shown to be lying on three pertinent questions of, do you know where your sister</p>
<p>Kathy is?</p>
<p>Have you talked with Kathy since she disappeared?</p>
<p>And did you tell the truth to all these questions?</p>
<p>The next day, Kathy&rsquo;s mom, Ruth, agreed to take a polygraph, and she too failed.</p>
<p>According to the polygraph results, Ruth and Wendy both possibly knew something about where</p>
<p>Kathy was and had possibly even heard from her.</p>
<p>But the failed polygraphs didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Later on in July, one of Kathy&rsquo;s closest friends, Sue, agreed to a polygraph.</p>
<p>And just like Tim, Wendy, and Ruth, Sue failed too.</p>
<p>Deception was indicated on the questions, do you know where Kathy is?</p>
<p>And has Kathy gotten in touch with you?</p>
<p>We asked Detective Dobreiner that with all of these people close to Kathy failing, if</p>
<p>he thought the polygraph machine was malfunctioning, or maybe the polygrapher was interpreting</p>
<p>things incorrectly.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s something wrong with the test.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that it was probably interpreted properly.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a reason why polygraph is not allowed in court.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reliable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally a tool to try and point investigators in a right direction or, you know, open up</p>
<p>a conversation that there might be something more there.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s not 100% that it shows that you are lying.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, I think that if somebody is stressed or they&rsquo;ve got anxiety, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to breathe funny.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to sweat a little differently.</p>
<p>You might have those little shakiness and your voice is going to show something different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not reliable, but it opens up additional conversation with somebody.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>These failed tests didn&rsquo;t really open up conversations with anyone.</p>
<p>Just like Tim, everyone else was also adamant that they were telling the truth, even after</p>
<p>their failed polygraphs.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, there were a few leads that popped up here and there.</p>
<p>With every tip that came in, investigators vetted, but nothing panned out.</p>
<p>It was amazing how many people came forward with like, oh, I think that I saw her, or</p>
<p>I took a picture of this girl who looked like her.</p>
<p>Oh, I was driving in Milwaukee and I saw a girl ducked down in a car.</p>
<p>All kinds of these like random, weird little, everybody seemed to know the case and saw her.</p>
<p>As the months faded into years, potential leads still trickled in, each one getting</p>
<p>investigators hopes up as much as the last.</p>
<p>Every time an article of clothing was found that even halfway resembled what Kathy was</p>
<p>last seen wearing, Jefferson County detectives were notified and they&rsquo;d ask Kathy&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>to confirm whether or not it was her daughter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And each time, Ruth said it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For years, these small dead-end leads were all investigators had.</p>
<p>Until 1980, six years after Kathy&rsquo;s disappearance, when two more people mysteriously vanished</p>
<p>from the Concord House.</p>
<p>On August 9th, 1980, 19-year-old high school sweethearts, Timothy Hack and Kelly Drew,</p>
<p>had made plans to meet up with some friends after attending a wedding at the Concord House,</p>
<p>but they never showed up.</p>
<p>According to Pioneer Press, Timothy&rsquo;s car was found parked at the Concord House with</p>
<p>his jacket, checkbook, and his wallet still inside.</p>
<p>A few days after their disappearance, Kelly&rsquo;s mangled clothes were found alongside a nearby</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>In the days and weeks following Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s disappearance, local newspapers documented</p>
<p>the uneasy feeling in the Jefferson County community.</p>
<p>According to Winona Daily News, local teens were hesitant to go on dates alone for fear</p>
<p>of meeting whatever fate Timothy, Kelly, and possibly Kathy met.</p>
<p>For months, the search for Timothy and Kelly continued, with hope waning every day that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be found alive.</p>
<p>Then in October of that year, which is two months after they disappeared, some hunters</p>
<p>found two severely decomposed bodies about eight miles away from the Concord House.</p>
<p>Those two were later identified as Timothy and Kelly.</p>
<p>According to that same article by Pioneer Press that I mentioned earlier, their bodies</p>
<p>were too badly decomposed to determine a cause of death, but the medical examiner was able</p>
<p>to rule the manner of death, homicide, and there was semen found on Kelly&rsquo;s clothes,</p>
<p>which led investigators to suspect that she&rsquo;d been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Finding Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s bodies didn&rsquo;t seem to bring investigators any closer to</p>
<p>solving the case, but according to the Capital Times, it brought a certain level of closure</p>
<p>to their families.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s mom said, quote, we didn&rsquo;t want it to end this way, but eventually, yes, it</p>
<p>will put our minds to ease, end quote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that sense of closure that Kathy&rsquo;s mom, Ruth, still longed for.</p>
<p>At this point, it had been six years, six long years of not knowing where Kathy was,</p>
<p>whether she&rsquo;d been kidnapped, whether she&rsquo;d run away, whether she was dead.</p>
<p>In the next few years that followed, Kathy&rsquo;s case sat right alongside Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and growing colder as the days ticked by.</p>
<p>Tips still trickled in slowly with possible sightings of Kathy from nearby Delafield,</p>
<p>Wisconsin, even tips from all the way out in California.</p>
<p>But just like with all the previous sightings, each one was false or unable to be proven.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just the supposed sightings that kept getting investigators&rsquo; hopes up.</p>
<p>Every time they got a call about unidentified skeletal remains found anywhere in the country</p>
<p>that matched Kathy&rsquo;s description, they were optimistic that they&rsquo;d finally get</p>
<p>some answers.</p>
<p>But each and every time, Kathy was ruled out as a match by dental records or some other</p>
<p>method.</p>
<p>By the time 1995 rolled around, Kathy&rsquo;s family had run out of hope that Kathy would</p>
<p>turn up alive.</p>
<p>It had been 21 years since Ruth last talked to or hugged her daughter, and she was ready</p>
<p>to publicly say goodbye.</p>
<p>So in June, she arranged for a memorial service to be held for her daughter at the same church</p>
<p>where Kathy had been baptized.</p>
<p>It was there that Ruth finally let go of the hope she&rsquo;d been holding on to, that her</p>
<p>daughter would come walking through the door at any moment.</p>
<p>Ruth told the Oshkosh Northwestern, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Everyone that knew her knew she didn&rsquo;t run away.</p>
<p>She was a happy teenager.</p>
<p>There was no reason why she would,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>According to that same article, Ruth was still wondering if her daughter&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>was connected to Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s slayings in 1980.</p>
<p>But even if it could have been proven that they were linked, that would have done little</p>
<p>for catching Kathy&rsquo;s kidnapper, because Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s case remained hopelessly</p>
<p>unsolved too.</p>
<p>And both cases would stay that way for another 14 years, until 2009, when DNA led to a shocking</p>
<p>breakthrough in Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>A swab taken from a man named Edward Edwards matched the semen found on Kelly&rsquo;s clothes</p>
<p>all those years ago.</p>
<p>You see, Ed was a handyman at the Concord House back when Kelly and Timothy went missing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d actually been questioned back in the day, and according to NBC News, shortly after</p>
<p>talking with police back then, Ed just uprooted his whole family and left Wisconsin.</p>
<p>According to Oxygen, in 2008, when Kelly and Timothy&rsquo;s unsolved murder was reopened</p>
<p>and detectives were revisiting everyone who&rsquo;d been interviewed decades ago, Ed came back</p>
<p>on the radar.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;d fled the area after the murders, he stood out to investigators.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not the only reason detectives found him noteworthy.</p>
<p>You see, Ed had quite the criminal history.</p>
<p>According to Investigation Discovery, he got arrested in 1955 for a break-in, then escaped</p>
<p>from jail and wasn&rsquo;t recaptured until 1962, when he was jailed for some armed robberies.</p>
<p>After that, he supposedly turned a corner and became this upstanding citizen.</p>
<p>He even wrote a book about his crimes, became a motivational speaker, and grew into a popular</p>
<p>media personality because of how he turned his life around.</p>
<p>But despite his reformed appearance, investigators on Timothy and Kelly&rsquo;s case were suspicious,</p>
<p>so they tracked Ed down to get a DNA swab.</p>
<p>And like I said, it was a match.</p>
<p>This meant that he was good for the double murder, and I&rsquo;m sure everyone in Jefferson</p>
<p>County was holding their breath that investigators would connect him to Kathy&rsquo;s murder, too.</p>
<p>But when police questioned him about her disappearance, things weren&rsquo;t so cut and dry.</p>
<p>Ed had an alibi for June 6, 1974, the day Kathy vanished.</p>
<p>So Ed effectively dropped off the suspect list for Kathy&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what gets me.</p>
<p>What Ed&rsquo;s alibi was, nobody seems to know.</p>
<p>Like, Detective Dobreiner couldn&rsquo;t find that info in the case file, so our reporting</p>
<p>team posed the question to a retired detective who was familiar with Kathy&rsquo;s case and familiar</p>
<p>with Ed.</p>
<p>But he told our reporters that he was retired and didn&rsquo;t do this kind of thing anymore,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not sure if that means he didn&rsquo;t remember Ed&rsquo;s alibi, he didn&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>or just didn&rsquo;t want to say.</p>
<p>The former detective was kind enough to answer one question.</p>
<p>He said that Ed was not incarcerated at the time of Kathy&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>So to me, incarceration is one of the few alibis good enough to make such an obvious</p>
<p>suspect just drop off the list, especially in the 70s.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like investigators had cell phone and GPS data at their fingertips</p>
<p>to prove that Ed was across the country or something.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that there wasn&rsquo;t surveillance footage placing him</p>
<p>somewhere else either.</p>
<p>So what was his alibi?</p>
<p>And how is it good enough to make a known killer with connections to the Concord House</p>
<p>be cleared as a suspect?</p>
<p>It kind of blows my mind, and I think it&rsquo;s something that will keep gnawing at me until</p>
<p>I know the answer, especially since Ed&rsquo;s murders didn&rsquo;t stop with Kelly and Timothy.</p>
<p>In 2010, Ed pled guilty to their killings and to other murders.</p>
<p>An Ohio couple named William Billy Lavaco and Judy Straub, who he killed in 1977.</p>
<p>And in March 2011, Ed was sentenced to death for another horrific crime, the murder of</p>
<p>Danny Glockner, aka Danny Boy Edwards, who was Ed&rsquo;s own foster son.</p>
<p>But Ed didn&rsquo;t live to see his August 2011 execution date.</p>
<p>Less than a month after his sentencing, Ed died in prison of natural causes.</p>
<p>So if Ed was responsible for Kathy&rsquo;s disappearance, that&rsquo;s something investigators may never</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that secret died along with Ed.</p>
<p>I want to take a second to note that Ed is a killer that many people in the true crime</p>
<p>community know well, not only because of the murders he was convicted of, but because his</p>
<p>victim count is speculated to be far beyond these five murders.</p>
<p>In 2014, a retired police detective named John A. Cameron released a book alleging that</p>
<p>Ed was behind a ton of murders, like the Zodiac murders and at least a dozen other</p>
<p>killings.</p>
<p>But since Ed&rsquo;s not officially a suspect in Kathy&rsquo;s case, we aren&rsquo;t going to go into</p>
<p>all of that here.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s book is called It&rsquo;s Me, Edward Wayne Edwards, The Serial Killer You Never Heard</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>And it goes into great detail about John&rsquo;s theories.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just that, theories.</p>
<p>Nothing has been proven and the book has been heavily critiqued as many people find it to</p>
<p>be far-fetched.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ed&rsquo;s connection to Kelly and Timothy&rsquo;s murder was really the last major development</p>
<p>in Kathy&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>And even that didn&rsquo;t pan out as investigators might have hoped.</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner took over Kathy&rsquo;s case in 2012, and he said that since then, there</p>
<p>have been glimmers of hope here and there, like small tips and leads trickling in, but</p>
<p>nothing that has led anywhere.</p>
<p>Investigators have been left wanting for answers in the case that&rsquo;s going on 50 years old.</p>
<p>Detective Dobreiner said the amount of evidence they have in the case today is virtually the</p>
<p>same as what they had nearly five decades ago when Kathy vanished.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a body.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have injuries.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have blood or semen or anything that gives us anything additional besides</p>
<p>the last person saw her going this way and that&rsquo;s the last anybody saw her.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just terrible that there&rsquo;s such a lack of evidence or knowledge of what so many</p>
<p>questions that we want answered that nobody&rsquo;s able to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why maybe something with like this podcast that somebody is able to, you know,</p>
<p>sparks a memory or, you know, they remember seeing something or maybe they&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>with somebody named Kathy that, hmm, maybe something turns up, you know, it should be</p>
<p>nice to provide some closure to the family or something because there&rsquo;s so lack of anything.</p>
<p>We asked Detective Dobreiner what he thinks happened to Kathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a tough question because there&rsquo;s no information.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many possibilities given the location where she&rsquo;s at with the interstate</p>
<p>right there.</p>
<p>If she left, is she that highly intoxicated that she goes out onto the interstate and</p>
<p>gets hit by a car by another drunk person driving?</p>
<p>Oh, geez, I just hit somebody and they throw her into the car and they drive away and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to take care of it.</p>
<p>Is she picked up by somebody who was a serial killer that ended up doing something and disposed</p>
<p>of her body?</p>
<p>Is she one that just disappeared and, you know, I&rsquo;m just going to disappear and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never coming back and nobody&rsquo;s going to know nothing?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s her own decision.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many possibilities.</p>
<p>And of course, doing this now for 22 years, truth is stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>So what really happened?</p>
<p>I wish I had a better theory, but I&rsquo;m open to whatever possibilities are out there.</p>
<p>Whether or not I know back in the 70s, it was more prevalent for people to go hitchhiking</p>
<p>and stuff that it&rsquo;s totally possible that she hitched a ride with somebody.</p>
<p>And I know that that kind of brings up the whole Edward Edwards thing that I questioned</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>For nearly 50 years, Kathy&rsquo;s family and friends have grieved the loss of a life gone far too</p>
<p>soon.</p>
<p>Kathy&rsquo;s pain is only amplified by the lack of answers surrounding her disappearance.</p>
<p>But someone out there knows something that can help detectives solve this case and give</p>
<p>Kathy the justice she deserves.</p>
<p>If that person is you, if you know anything about the disappearance or murder of Katherine</p>
<p>Sjoberg in June of 1974, it is time to speak up.</p>
<p>Call Detective Doe Briner at the Jefferson County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 920-674-8624.</p>
<p>Kathy was last seen in a long, light blue formal gown.</p>
<p>She had long, light brown hair parted in the middle, and she had green eyes.</p>
<p>She was about 5'4 or 5'5, and she would be 65 years old today.</p>
<p>The Deck is an AudioChuck production with theme music by Ryan Lewis.</p>
